'''AXIOM''' is an [[open hardware]] and [[free software]] [[digital cinema camera]] family of devices being developed by a [[DIY]] community around the apertus° project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.zeit.de/2014/26/open-source-patente-industrie/seite-2 | title=Open Source: Eine Revolution mit Lötkolben und Schraubenzieher (German) | publisher=zeit.de | year=2014 | accessdate=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The community’s second generation camera, AXIOM Beta Compact, is presently in development.

== History ==
In 2006 Oscar Spierenburg, a Dutch film director,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6814696/ | title=Oscar Spierenburg IMDB | publisher=imdb.com | year=2017 | access-date=October 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; noticed a discussion taking place on DVInfo.net entitled “3 channel 36 bit 1280 X 720 low $ camera”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dvinfo.net/forum/alternative-imaging-methods/25296-3-channel-36-bit-1280-x-720-low-camera-viper-21.html#post433657 |title=3 channel 36 bit 1280 X 720 low $ camera viper - The Digital Video Information Network |date=February 18, 2006 |access-date=April 18, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006212612/http://www.dvinfo.net/forum/alternative-imaging-methods/25296-3-channel-36-bit-1280-x-720-low-camera-viper-21.html#post433657 |archivedate=2017-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; inside which [[Elphel]] cameras, which are typically used in scientific applications, had been mentioned.

In the same year a discussion thread entitled "High Definition with Elphel model 333 camera"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dvinfo.net/conf/showthread.php?t=63677 |title=High Definition with Elphel model 333 camera - The Digital Video Information Network |date=2007-07-01 |access-date=2017-04-18 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701143201/http://dvinfo.net/conf/showthread.php?t=63677 |archivedate=2007-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was posted on the DVInfo.net forum, whereupon the forum’s members discussed how best to adapt Elphel open hardware camera devices for use in film production. Sebastian Pichelhofer discovered this thread in 2008 and assisted with the project by developing an Elphel camera internal hard-disk recorder user interface.

By early 2009, and because over the course of three years upwards of 1000 posts had been submitted to this thread, the community realised that it was going to be difficult to maintain a full overview of the project in this way, and consequently a dedicated website was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=https://apertus.org/history | title=apertus° History | publisher=apertus.org | year=2014 | accessdate=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the decision making and naming/logo design was decided upon by the community.

After having done some contracting work with Elphel, Pichelhofer focused full-time on the project across 2011 and in July 2012 the plan to create an AXIOM camera hardware prototype from scratch, and thereby overcome some of the limitations that were found to be inherent with Elphel hardware at the time (mainly due to Elphel Inc. having shifted the company's core business focus towards development of a panoramic camera solution), was announced at the Libre Software Meeting in Geneva.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://schedule2012.rmll.info/Apertus-The-birth-of-a-completely-open-digital-cinema-camera?lang=en | title= Apertus - The birth of a completely open digital cinema camera  | publisher=Libre Software Meeting | year=2012 | accessdate=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prototype became known as AXIOM Alpha and was intended to gather feedback from typical shooting scenarios with a view to incorporating ideas into a future, more modular, kit version of the camera aimed at developers and early adopters (AXIOM Beta I Developer Kit).

Shortly after development on the AXIOM Alpha began, a [[nonprofit organization]] was established to provide legal shelter for the community, and an apertus° [[company]] was registered by Spierenburg in order to facilitate responsibilities that had been neglected up to this point, e.g. signing contracts with electronic part/service providers, paying for prototype manufacturing etc. Because of his drive and enthusiasm for the project Pichelhofer was elected apertus° Association chairman.

After reading a local [[hackerspace]] forum post in May 2013 Herbert Pötzl became aware of the community's efforts and met with Pichelhofer shortly thereafter. Pötzl had an extensive background in electronics engineering and software development and was appointed AXIOM Technical Lead. After Pötzl helped to develop critical aspects of hardware and software the AXIOM Alpha prototype was showcased at the Vienna Hackerlab in March 2014 whilst rough planning for a more modular and powerful camera was well underway.

In 2014, after [[crowdfunding]] the research and development through [[Indiegogo]], work began on creating AXIOM Beta - a five [[printed circuit board]] stack, [[FOSS]] and [[open-source hardware]], digital cinema camera incorporating the ams Sensors Belgium CMV12000 [[CMOS]] image sensor.

In recent times, and because existing manufacturers have proved reluctant to open their protocols up to the wider world, user groups have accepted responsibility and contributed to what became known as the ‘DSLR revolution’ first-hand e.g. the [[Magic Lantern (firmware)]] community. Magic Lantern is a free and open source software add-on that runs from a camera’s SD/CF card. It added a host of new features to Canon’s DSLRs that weren't included from the factory by Canon. Because the AXIOM Beta concept is essentially the hardware equivalent of the software they originally pioneered, Magic Lantern partnered with the apertus° Association in September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=https://www.apertus.org/axiom-team-talk-video-volume1-article | title= AXIOM Team Talk - Volume 1  | publisher=apertus.org | year=2015 | accessdate=January 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the Magic Lantern community has been involved with various colour science experiments using the camera.

Research on an AXIOM Gamma started in March 2015 after the project was awarded funding from the [[European Union|EU]]'s [[Horizon 2020|Horizon2020]] programme.

AXIOM Alpha was a digital cinema camera [[proof of concept]] prototype.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.heise.de/open/artikel/Axiom-Alpha-Die-Open-Hardware-Kamera-2194752.html | title=Axiom Alpha: Die Open-Hardware-Kamera (German) | publisher=heise.de | year=2014 | accessdate=July 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two units were built in 2013 and the second revision model was presented at the [[Metalab]] (a Vienna-based [[Hackerspace]]) in spring 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=https://metalab.at/wiki/Metaday_65 | title=Metaday 65: Building an open source digital cinema camera - Functional Prototype Presentation | publisher=Metalab | year=2014 | accessdate=July 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main components included a Zedboard using a [[Xilinx]] [[Zynq-7000|Zynq-7020]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forums.xilinx.com/t5/Xcell-Daily-Blog/Zynq-based-Axiom-Alpha-open-4K-cine-camera-proto-debuts-in/ba-p/430066 |title=Zynq-based Axiom Alpha open 4K cine camera proto debuts in Vienna hackerspace |date=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[System on a chip|System on a chip (SoC)]] and a [[4K resolution|4K]] [[35mm#Super 35|Super35mm]] [[image sensor]] designed by the Belgian company CMOSIS (later renamed to ''ams Sensors Belgium'' after being acquired by ams &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.cmosis.com/news/press_releases/ams_acquires_cmosis_a_leading_supplier_of_high-end_area_scan_and_miniature | title=ams acquires CMOSIS, a leading supplier of high-end area scan and miniature medical image sensors | publisher=ams | year=2015 | accessdate=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://forums.xilinx.com/t5/Xcell-Daily-Blog/Zynq-based-ZedBoard-CMOSIS-Super35-Image-Sensor-Apertus/ba-p/398425 | title=Zynq-based ZedBoard + CMOSIS Super35 Image Sensor + Apertus Engineering = Axiom Open 4K Cinema Camera | publisher=Xilinx | year=2014 | accessdate=July 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technical specifications ===
The ams Sensors Belgium CMV12000 [[APS-C|Super35/APS-C]] image sensor has a resolution of 4096×3072 pixels, a [[color depth]] of 12&amp;nbsp;bits/pixel and is able to capture at a maximal frame rate of 300 frames/sec in 10-bit mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cmosis.com/products/product_detail/cmv12000 |title=Cmosis CMV12000 product page |date=2016-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is connected to the ZedBoard over [[FMC – FPGA Mezzanine Card|FMC]].
The Xilinx Zynq Z-7020 combines a [[ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore|Cortex-A9]] dual-core with an [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]].
The ZedBoard contains the Zynq Z-7020 and all the necessary interfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zedboard.org/product/zedboard |title=ZedBoard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Software ===
The operating system is [[Linux kernel]]-based ([[Arch Linux]]) and composed entirely of free and open-source software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.apertus.org/index.php?title=AXIOM_Beta_Software|title=AXIOM Beta/AXIOM Beta Software - apertus° wiki|website=wiki.apertus.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''AXIOM Beta Developer Kit (DK)''' - apertus° offers AXIOM Beta Developer Kit without an enclosure either in kit form or readily assembled. The AXIOM Beta DK provides easy access to the camera’s printed circuit boards and is aimed at those who want to work on software related development. With this in mind all associated design files, BOMs, and STL files (for CAD or 3D printing components such as a lightweight enclosure), software source code repositories, etc. are made freely available. First AXIOM Beta DK's began shipping in October 2016.

'''AXIOM Beta Compact (CP)''' - A more user-friendly version of the camera suited to photo and video production environments is intended to ship with a CNC-milled aluminium enclosure and a web-based GUI (graphical user interface) for controlling camera functions through a [[Wi-Fi]] connection. AXIOM Beta CP is in development.

'''AXIOM Beta Extended (EX)''' - A Shoulder mounted rig incorporating AXIOM Beta, larger cooling fans, data storage facilities and an on-board PC. At time of writing (November 2017) AXIOM Beta EX is presently in concept phase.

'''Adaptive bias''' is the idea that the [[human brain]] has [[evolution|evolved]] to [[reason]] adaptively, rather than truthfully or even rationally, and that [[cognitive bias]] may have evolved as a mechanism to reduce the overall '''cost''' of cognitive errors as opposed to merely reducing the '''number''' of cognitive errors, when faced with [[decision-making|making a decision]] under conditions of [[uncertainty]].

==Error Management Theory==
According to [[Error Management Theory]], when making decisions under conditions of uncertainty, two kinds of errors need to be taken into account—"[[false positive]]s", i.e. deciding that a risk or benefit exists when it does not, and "[[false negative]]s", i.e. failing to notice a risk or benefit that exists. False positives are also commonly called "Type I errors", and false negatives are called "Type II errors".

Where the cost or impact of a Type I error is much greater than the cost of a Type II error (e.g. the water is safe to drink), it can be worthwhile to bias the decision-making system towards making fewer Type I errors, i.e. making it less likely to conclude that a particular situation exists. This by definition would also increase the number of Type II errors. Conversely, where a false positive is much less costly than a false negative (blood tests, smoke detectors), it makes sense to bias the system towards maximising the probability that a particular (very costly) situation will be recognised, even if this often leads to the (relatively un-costly) event of noticing something that is not actually there. This situation is exhibited in modern airport screening—maximising the probability of preventing a high-cost terrorist event results in frequent, low-cost screening hassles for harmless travelers who represent a minimal threat.

{{harvtxt|Haselton|Buss|2003}} state that cognitive bias can be expected to have developed in humans for cognitive tasks where:
* decision-making is complicated by a significant signal-detection problem (i.e. when there is uncertainty)
* the solution to the particular kind of decision-making problem has had a recurrent effect on survival and [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] throughout evolutionary history
* the costs of a "false positive" or "false negative" error dramatically outweighs the cost of the alternative type of error

==The costly information hypothesis==
The costly information hypothesis is used to explore how adaptive biases relate to cultural evolution within the field of [[dual inheritance theory]]. The focus is on the evolutionary trade-offs in cost between individual learning, (e.g., [[operant conditioning]]) and [[Social learning theory|social learning]]. If more accurate information that could be acquired through individual learning is too costly, evolution may favor learning mechanisms that, in turn, are biased towards less costly, (though potentially less accurate), information via social learning.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1127">An '''algorithmic paradigm''', '''algorithm design paradigm''', '''algorithmic technique''', or '''algorithmic strategy''' is a generic method or approach which underlies the design of a class of [[algorithm]]s. It is an abstraction higher than the notion of an algorithm, just as an algorithm is an abstraction higher than a [[computer program]].  &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=M2viBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA702 p. 702]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=McPJt_eBgnoC&amp;pg=SA1-PA9 p. 9]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of algorithmic paradigms include the [[greedy algorithm]]  in [[optimization problem]]s,  [[dynamic programming]], [[prune and search]], and [[divide and conquer algorithms]]. More specialized algorithmic paradigms used in [[parameterized complexity]] include [[kernelization]] and [[iterative compression]]. In [[computational geometry]], additional algorithmic paradigms include [[sweep line algorithm]]s, [[rotating calipers]], and [[Randomized algorithm#Randomized incremental constructions in geometry|randomized incremental construction]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3636">'''Anal eroticism''' is erotic activity focusing on the [[anus]], and sometimes the [[rectum]].  
[[Sigmund Freud]] hypothesized that the [[anal stage]] of childhood [[psychosexual development]] was marked by the predominance of anal eroticism.&lt;ref&gt;P. Gay, ''Freud'' (1989) p. 281-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexological==
Since the mid-twentieth century, English speaking sex manuals like ''[[The Joy of Sex]]'' have acknowledged the erogenous sensitivity of the anus, and its role in love play.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Comfort, ''The Joy of Sex'' (1974) p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Its author, [[Alex Comfort]], recognised that [[anal intercourse]] was part of many heterosexual as well as homosexual relationships&lt;ref&gt;Alex Comfort, ''The Joy of Sex'' (1974) p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; (as indeed had Freud at the start of the century).&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) p. 64-5&lt;/ref&gt; Comfort also stressed the importance (in the French tradition) of [[postillionage]] or [[Fingering (sexual act)#Anal fingering|anal fingering]] prior to orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Comfort, ''The Joy of Sex'' (1974) p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

Some decades after Comfort, [[Margot Anand]] explored how liberating anal eroticism might contribute to [[peak experience]] in sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;Margot Anand, ''The Art of Sexual Ecstasy'' (1990) p. 1-2 and p. 336-345&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developmental==
[[D. W. Winnicott]] would speak accordingly of "the tremendous pleasure that belongs to the doing of a motion just exactly when the impulse comes...another little orgy that enriches the life of the infant".&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Winnicott, ''The Child, the Family, and the Outside World'' (1973) p. 43-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud in his 1908 article ''Character and Anal Erotism'' argued that, through reaction formations and sublimation, anal eroticism could turn in later life into character traits such as obstinacy, orderliness and meanness.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) p. 208-15&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sándor Ferenczi]] extended his findings to cover the sublimation of anal eroticism into aesthetic experiences such as painting and sculpture, as well as into an interest in money.&lt;ref&gt;Sandor Ferenczi, 'The Ontogenesis of the Interest in Money' in J. Halliday/P. Fuller eds., ''The Psychology of Gambling'' (1974) p. 264-272&lt;/ref&gt; [[Otto Fenichel]] linked anal eroticism to feelings of [[disgust]], to [[Sadomasochism|masochism]], and to [[pornography]].&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 139, 351 and 359-60&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Julia Kristeva]] would subsequently explore anal eroticism in connection with her concept of [[abjection]].&lt;ref&gt;F. L. Restuccia, ''Melancholics in Love'' (2000) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Appropriation of knowledge''' is the process of constructing [[knowledge]] from social and cultural sources, and integrating it into pre-existing schemas.&lt;ref&gt;Billett (1998), Johnson et al (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[developmental process]] that comes about through socially formulated, goal-directed, and tool-mediated actions.&lt;ref&gt;Cook et al (2002), Grossman et al (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Appropriation draws on the developmental theories of [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]] and [[Lev Vygotsky|Vygotsky]], as both the cognitive and social-constructivist views of learning are equally emphasized.&lt;ref&gt;Billett (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Jenkins]], discusses appropriation as "the ability to meaningfully sample and remix the content(s)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jenkins|first=Henry|title=Multiculturalism, Appropriation, and the New Media Literacies|url=http://henryjenkins.org/2009/06/multiculturalism_appropriation.html|publisher=Henry Jenkins|accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of our culture for new expressive purposes. Jenkins noted that many literature classes in schools are embracing appropriation. A common example of appropriation at its finest is [[Ricardo Pitts-Wiley]]'s "Moby-Dick: Then and Now", a contemporary reworking of Herman Melville's [[Moby-Dick]] narrative. Fundamental to appropriation is the idea that knowledge is socially constructed and that the student plays an active role in its construction.&lt;ref&gt;Cook et al (2002), Grossman et al (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Appropriation has occurred when the student has adapted the information in a way that is meaningful to them and they can use the knowledge as their own.&lt;ref&gt;Cook et al (2002), Grossman et al (1999), Johnson et al (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activity theory==

Appropriation in [[education]] is often understood and analyzed through [[activity theory]]. This theory was developed by [[Aleksei N. Leontiev]] and focuses on understanding the socio-cultural context (specifically the setting) learning occurs in.&lt;ref&gt;Cook et al (2002), Hung (1999), Johnson et al (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Activity theory is predicated on the assumption that a person's frameworks for thinking are developed and carried out in specific settings,&lt;ref&gt;Grossman et al (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; and that these settings mediate [[cognitive development]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnson et al (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Since appropriation also places a strong emphasis on setting, these theories complement each other when being used to analyze learning environments.

==Process of appropriating knowledge==

Hung&lt;ref&gt;Hung (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; has developed steps through which the appropriation of knowledge usually occurs. The process is as follows:

; 1. Growing into {{Interlanguage link multi|social dependency|wikt|3=dependency|lt=dependency}} (''submitting''): the [[student]] recognizes the differences between their beliefs/knowledge and the beliefs/knowledge of the [[teacher]]. The student accepts the teacher as the leader and submits to their beliefs, knowledge and rules.
; 2. Dependency (''mirroring''): The student adapts strategies to help submit to the beliefs, knowledge and rules of the teacher. The student questions the teacher and other students and begins to co-construct and negotiate meanings.
; 3. Growing out of dependency (''constructing''): the student experiments with the beliefs, knowledge and rules co-constructed with the teacher and other students and uses these ideas outside of the classroom. The student discovers patterns, ideas, concepts and beliefs inherent to the [[learning community]] and applies them to other environments.

==Five degrees of appropriation==

Through research with English teachers, Grossman ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Grossman et al (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; developed a theory to describe the varying levels of appropriation. The degrees 
; Lack of appropriation: the student has not appropriated the knowledge. This may occur because the [[concept]] being taught is too difficult for the student to comprehend or is too foreign to fit into the learner’s prior frameworks at that point in their development.
; Appropriating a label: the student knows the name of the concept but knows none of the features.
; Appropriating surface features: the student knows most of the features of the concept, but does not understand how those features contribute to the conceptual whole.
; Appropriating conceptual underpinnings: the student grasps the theoretical basis that informs and motivates the use of the concept and is able to make use of the concept in new contexts and for solving new problems. This is the level of appropriation that teachers and students should strive for.
; Achieving mastery: the student has the skills to use the concept effectively and to its fullest effect. This should also be strived for, but would likely to years of practice to achieve.

===Factors affecting the degree of appropriation===
There are a variety of factors that can affect the level of appropriation that the student achieves. Some of these factors are:

*The role the student plays in the [[learning process]]: students that play an active role in their learning process are more likely to appropriate knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman et al (1999), Johnson et al (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[social context]] of learning: this refers to the environment where the student learning, the values and expectations implied in the learning environment, how the knowledge is introduced by the teacher, and the social practices that occur in the learning environment. A more positive learning environment will most likely result in higher degrees of appropriation.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman et al (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Individual characteristics of the student: this includes the beliefs, goals, expectations, and motives of the student. The closer a student’s values align with those of the teacher, the more likely a student will appropriate the knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Billett (1998), Grossman et al (1999), Johnson et al (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; A student’s motives also affect the degree of appropriation. Students who are intrinsically motivated are more likely to reach a higher level of appropriation.&lt;ref&gt;Poleman (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Interest and knowledge of the teacher: a teacher who appears more interested and/ or knowledgeable in the content being taught is more likely to influence appropriation in their students.&lt;ref&gt;Poleman (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes of appropriation==

Through appropriation students construct their own versions of knowledge, allowing [[internalization]] of the information they have learned.&lt;ref&gt;Billett (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Their beliefs and behaviours concerning the concepts learned also change.&lt;ref&gt;Poleman (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; These transformations alter the student’s conception of the information, which will affect how that information is given to others interacting with the student.&lt;ref&gt;Billett (1998), Cook et al (2002), Johnson et al (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; How knowledge is transferred from one person to the next is an important aspect of appropriation and demonstrates the collaborative aspect of appropriation, where knowledge is constantly being negotiated with other.&lt;ref&gt;Billett (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Collaboratively, students and teachers construct knowledge in a way that is meaningful to them.

[[File:NewDealNRA.jpg|thumb|upright|NRA Blue Eagle]]
The '''Blue Eagle''' was a symbol used in the United States by companies to show compliance with the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]], a part of President Franklin Roosevelt's "New Deal" program. The NIRA authorized the creation of the NRA (National Recovery Administration), which was used to exercise control over business and industry, focusing on regulations and price controls, and was later found to be unconstitutional.

The blue eagle was proclaimed the symbol of industrial recovery on July 20, 1933 by [[Hugh S. Johnson]], the head of the [[National Recovery Administration]].&lt;ref name="Schlesinger"&gt;Schlesinger, Jr., Arthur M. ''The Age of Roosevelt, Vol. 2: The Coming of the New Deal''. Paperback ed.

All companies that accepted President [[Franklin D.

: &lt;math&gt;u_I = 1_A&lt;/math&gt; (this is actually a consequence of the first axiom).

An arrow from ''(A,u)'' to ''(B,v)'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Z(C)}&lt;/math&gt; consists of an arrow &lt;math&gt;f:A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;v_X (f \otimes 1_X) = (1_X \otimes f) u_X&lt;/math&gt;.

The category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Z(C)}&lt;/math&gt; becomes a [[braided monoidal category]] with the tensor product on objects defined as

:&lt;math&gt;(A,u) \otimes (B,v) = (A \otimes B,w)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;w_X = (u_X \otimes 1)(1 \otimes v_X)&lt;/math&gt;, and the obvious braiding.

'''Clever Bins Limited''' was UK company that provided [[solar energy|solar]]-powered street [[litter bin]] that displayed digital [[outdoor advertising]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipo.gov.uk/domestic?domesticnum=2515319 "Clever Bins a trademarked term"], ''Intellectual Property Office'', Published 5 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clever Bin==
The 'Clever Bins' came with [[A2 paper size|A2]] sized display panels that were lit up by directional [[LED]] beams. The panels came with military standard [[Riot shield]]ing. Some models of the bin could broadcast messages to nearby [[mobile device]]s.

The bins used solar power that, even in cloudy conditions, could charge the units for up to 7 hours of illumination. The level of illumination was regulated depending on the power available.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Funding==

In August 2009, Sachiti failed to find an investor on the BBCs TV show [[Dragons' Den (UK TV series)|Dragons' Den]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dragonsden/entrepreneurs/williamsachiti.shtml "BBC Dragons Den Pitch"]''BBC Dragons Den Pitch '', Broadcast August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Clever Bins was partnered with [[Keep Britain Tidy]] in July 2010.&lt;ref name="keepbritaintidy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keepbritaintidy.org/News/Default.aspx?newsID=944 |title=News |publisher=web.archive.org |accessdate=18 August 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314053650/http://www.keepbritaintidy.org/News/Default.aspx?newsID=944 |archivedate=14 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; on a study for which Keep Britain tidy will release the results later in 2011.

Traditionally, the theory of [[retributive justice]] is based on the ideas of [[revenge|retaliation]] ([[punishment]]), which is valuable in itself, and also provides [[Deterrence (legal)|deterrent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Retributive Justice|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-retributive/|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the police, [[Sentence (law)|sentences]] of execution or imprisonment were thought pretty efficient at this, while at the same time removing the threat criminals pose to the public (protection). Alternative sentences add to these goals, trying to reform the offender ([[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]]), and put right what he did ([[Reparation (legal)|reparation]]).

Traditionally, [[Victimology|victims of a crime]] only played a small part in the criminal justice process, as this breaching the rules of the society. The [[restorative justice|restorative approach to justice]] approach often makes it a part of a sentence for the offender to apologize, compensate the damage they have caused or repair it with their own labour.

The shift towards alternative sentencing means that some offenders avoid imprisonment with its many unwanted consequences. This is beneficial for the society, as it may prevent them from getting into the so-called [[Recidivism|the revolving door syndrome]], the inability of a person to go back to normal life after leaving a prison, becoming a [[Habitual offender|career criminal]]. Furthermore, there are hopes that this could alleviate [[prison overcrowding]] and reduce the cost of punishment.

Instead of depriving those who commit less dangerous offences (such as [[summary offence]]s) of their freedom, the courts put some limitations on them and give them some duties. The list of components that make up a community sentence is of course different in individual countries, and will be combined individually by the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Sentences|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/criminal_law/criminal_trial/types_of_sentences.html|website=Citizens Information|publisher=Citizens Information Board, Ireland|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-custodial sentences can include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Sentencing in Criminal Cases - Fines, Probation and Jail|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal/sentences.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Alternative Sentencing|journal=ABA Journal|date=1 November 1987|volume=73|issue=13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s2yX6rsuuJ4C&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Computational sociology''' is a branch of [[sociology]] that uses computationally intensive methods to analyze and model social phenomena. Using [[computer simulation]]s, [[artificial intelligence]], complex statistical methods, and analytic approaches like [[social network analysis]], computational sociology develops and tests theories of complex social processes through bottom-up modeling of social interactions.&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.28.110601.141117|title=From Factors to Actors: Computational Sociology and Agent-Based Modeling |first1=Michael W. |last1=Macy |first2=Robert |last2=Willer |journal=Annual Review of Sociology |volume=28 |pages=143–166 |jstor=3069238|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It involves the understanding of social agents, the interaction among these agents, and the effect of these interactions on the social aggregate.&lt;ref name="SfSS1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilbert |first1=Nigel |last2=Troitzsch |first2=Klaus |year=2005 |title=Simulation for Social Scientists |edition=2 |chapter=Simulation and social science |publisher=Open University Press |url=http://cress.soc.surrey.ac.uk/s4ss/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the subject matter and methodologies in [[social science]] differ from those in [[natural science]] or [[computer science]], several of the approaches used in contemporary [[social simulation]] originated from fields such as [[physics]] and [[artificial intelligence]].&lt;ref name="Artificial Societies"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Epstein |first1=Joshua M. |last2=Axtell |first2=Robert |year=1996 |title=Growing Artificial Societies: Social Science from the Bottom Up |location=Washington DC |publisher=Brookings Institution Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xXvelSs2caQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooperation"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Axelrod |first1=Robert |year=1997 |title=The Complexity of Cooperation: Agent-Based Models of Competition and Collaboration |location=Princeton, NJ |publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the approaches that originated in this field have been imported into the natural sciences, such as measures of [[centrality|network centrality]] from the fields of [[social network analysis]] and [[network science]].

In relevant literature, computational sociology is often related to the study of [[social complexity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Casti |first=J |year=1999 |title=The Computer as Laboratory: Toward a Theory of Complex Adaptive Systems |journal=Complexity |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=12–14 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-0526(199905/06)4:5&lt;12::AID-CPLX3&gt;3.0.CO;2-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social complexity concepts such as [[complex systems]], [[non-linear]] interconnection among macro and micro process, and [[emergence]], have entered the vocabulary of computational sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldspink |first=C |year=2002 |title=Methodological Implications of Complex Systems Approaches to Sociality: Simulation as a Foundation for Knowledge |url=http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/5/1/3.html |publisher=Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation |volume=5 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A practical and well-known example is the construction of a computational model in the form of an "[[artificial society]]", by which researchers can analyze the structure of a [[Social structure|social system]].&lt;ref name="SfSS1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Generative"&gt;{{cite book|last=Epstein |first=Joshua |year=2007 |title=Generative Social Science: Studies in Agent-Based Computational Modeling |location=Princeton, NJ |publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

==History==
{{see also|Sociology and complexity science}}
[[File:Complexity-map-with-sociolo.png|thumb|right|300px|Historical map of research paradigms and associated scientists in [[sociology and complexity science]].]]

=== Background ===

In the past four decades, computational sociology has been introduced and gaining popularity {{According to whom|date=June 2017}}.  This has been used primarily for modeling or building explanations of social processes and are depending on the emergence of complex behavior from simple activities.&lt;ref name="EACICS"&gt;Salgado, Mauricio, and Nigel Gilbert. "Emergence and communication in computational sociology." Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour 43.1 (2013): 87-110.&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea behind emergence is that properties of any bigger system don't always have to be properties of the components that the system is made of.&lt;ref&gt;Macy, Michael W., and Robert Willer. "From factors to factors: computational sociology and agent-based modeling." Annual review of sociology 28.1 (2002): 143-166.&lt;/ref&gt;  The people responsible for the introduction of the idea of emergence are Alexander, Morgan, and Broad, who were classical emergentists.  The time at which these emergentists came up with this concept and method was during the time of the early twentieth century.  The aim of this method was to find a good enough accommodation between two different and extreme ontologies, which were reductionist materialism and dualism.&lt;ref name="EACICS"/&gt; 

While emergence has had a valuable and important role with the foundation of Computational Sociology, there are those who do not necessarily agree.  One major leader in the field, Epstein, doubted the use because there were aspects that are unexplainable.  Epstein put up a claim against emergentism, in which he says it "is precisely the generative sufficiency of the parts that constitutes the whole's explanation".&lt;ref name="EACICS"/&gt;

Agent-based models have had a historical influence on Computational Sociology.   These models first came around in the 1960s, and were used to simulate control and feedback processes in organizations, cities, etc.  During the 1970s, the application introduced the use of individuals as the main units for the analyses and used bottom-up strategies for modeling behaviors.  The last wave occurred in the 1980s.  At this time, the models were still bottom-up; the only difference is that the agents interact interdependently.&lt;ref name="EACICS"/&gt;

===Systems theory and structural functionalism===
{{main|Systems theory|Structural functionalism}}
In the post-war era, [[Vannevar Bush]]'s [[differential analyser]], [[John von Neumann]]'s [[Von Neumann cellular automata|cellular automata]], [[Norbert Wiener]]'s [[cybernetics]], and [[Claude Shannon]]'s [[information theory]] became influential paradigms for modeling and understanding complexity in technical systems. In response, scientists in disciplines such as physics, biology, electronics, and economics began to articulate a [[systems theory|general theory of systems]] in which all natural and physical phenomena are manifestations of interrelated elements in a system that has common patterns and properties. Following [[Émile Durkheim]]'s call to analyze complex modern society ''[[sui generis]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Émile |last=Durkheim |title=The Division of Labor in Society |location=New York, NY |publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; post-war structural functionalist sociologists such as [[Talcott Parsons]] seized upon these theories of systematic and hierarchical interaction among constituent components to attempt to generate grand unified sociological theories, such as the [[AGIL paradigm]].&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Kenneth D. |last1=Bailey |editor=Jonathan H. Turner |chapter=Systems Theory |title=Handbook of Sociological Theory |publisher=Springer Science |year=2006 |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-387-32458-5 |pages=379–404}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologists such as [[George Homans]] argued that sociological theories should be formalized into hierarchical structures of propositions and precise terminology from which other propositions and hypotheses could be derived and operationalized into empirical studies.&lt;ref name="Blackwell"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007 |title=Computational Sociology |last=Bainbridge |first=William Sims |encyclopedia=Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology |publisher=Blackwell Reference Online |url=http://www.sociologyencyclopedia.com/subscriber/tocnode?id=g9781405124331_chunk_g97814051243319_ss1-85 |doi=10.1111/b.9781405124331.2007.x |editor=Ritzer, George|isbn=978-1-4051-2433-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because computer algorithms and programs had been used as early as 1956 to test and validate mathematical theorems, such as the [[four color theorem]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crevier |first=D. |year=1993 |title=AI: The Tumultuous History of the Search for Artificial Intelligence |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; some scholars anticipated that similar computational approaches could "solve" and "prove" analogously formalized problems and theorems of social structures and dynamics.

===Macrosimulation and microsimulation===
{{main|System dynamics|Microsimulation}}
By the late 1960s and early 1970s, social scientists used increasingly available computing technology to perform macro-simulations of control and feedback processes in organizations, industries, cities, and global populations. These models used differential equations to predict population distributions as holistic functions of other systematic factors such as inventory control, urban traffic, migration, and disease transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jay |last=Forrester |year=1971 |title=World Dynamics |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1287/opre.26.2.237|title=Using Simulation to Develop and Validate Analytic Models: Some Case Studies |first1=Edward J. |last1=Ignall |first2=Peter |last2=Kolesar |first3=Warren E. |last3=Walker |journal=Operations Research |volume=26 |issue=2 |year=1978 |pages=237–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although simulations of social systems received substantial attention in the mid-1970s after the [[Club of Rome]] published reports predicting that policies promoting exponential economic growth would eventually bring global environmental catastrophe ,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Dynamics of Growth in a Finite World |last1=Meadows |first1=DL |last2=Behrens |first2=WW |last3=Meadows |first3=DH |last4=Naill |first4=RF |last5= Randers |first5=J |last6=Zahn |first6=EK |year=1974 |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; the inconvenient conclusions led many authors to seek to discredit the models, attempting to make the researchers themselves appear unscientific.&lt;ref name="SfSS1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Computer View of Disaster Is Rebutted |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 18, 1974|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/18/archives/computer-view-of-disaster-is-rebutted.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoping to avoid the same fate, many social scientists turned their attention toward micro-simulation models to make forecasts and study policy effects by modeling aggregate changes in state of individual-level entities rather than the changes in distribution at the population level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0167-2681(90)90038-F|title=From engineering to microsimulation : An autobiographical reflection |journal=Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization |year=1990 |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=5–27 |first=Guy H. |last=Orcutt}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these micro-simulation models did not permit individuals to interact or adapt and were not intended for basic theoretical research.&lt;ref name="MW"/&gt;

===Cellular automata and agent-based modeling===
{{main|Cellular automata|agent-based modeling}}
The 1970s and 1980s were also a time when physicists and mathematicians were attempting to model and analyze how simple component units, such as atoms, give rise to global properties, such as complex material properties at low temperatures, in magnetic materials, and within turbulent flows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cellular automata machines: a new environment for modeling |first1=Tommaso |last1=Toffoli |first2=Norman |last2=Margolus | author2-link = Norman Margolus |year=1987 |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using cellular automata, scientists were able to specify systems consisting of a grid of cells in which each cell only occupied some finite states and changes between states were solely governed by the states of immediate neighbors. Along with advances in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[microcomputer]] power, these methods contributed to the development of "[[chaos theory]]" and "[[complex systems|complexity theory]]" which, in turn, renewed interest in understanding complex physical and social systems across disciplinary boundaries.&lt;ref name="SfSS1"/&gt; Research organizations explicitly dedicated to the interdisciplinary study of complexity were also founded in this era: the [[Santa Fe Institute]] was established in 1984 by scientists based at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] and the BACH group at the [[University of Michigan]] likewise started in the mid-1980s.

This cellular automata paradigm gave rise to a third wave of social simulation emphasizing agent-based modeling. Like micro-simulations, these models emphasized bottom-up designs but adopted four key assumptions that diverged from microsimulation: autonomy, interdependency, simple rules, and adaptive behavior.&lt;ref name="MW"/&gt; Agent-based models are less concerned with predictive accuracy and instead emphasize theoretical development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A simulation of the structure of academic science |journal=Sociological Research Online |volume=2 |issue=2 |year=1997 |first=Nigel |last=Gilbert |url=http://www.socresonline.org.uk/socresonline/2/2/3.html |doi=10.5153/sro.85}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, mathematician and political scientist [[Robert Axelrod]] and evolutionary biologist [[W.D. Hamilton]] published a major paper in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' titled "The Evolution of Cooperation" which used an agent-based modeling approach to demonstrate how social cooperation based upon reciprocity can be established and stabilized in a [[prisoner's dilemma]] game when agents followed simple rules of self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Evolution of Cooperation |first1=Robert |last1=Axelrod |first2=William D. |last2=Hamilton |journal=Science |volume=211 |issue=4489 |pages=1390–1396 |doi=10.1126/science.7466396|pmid=7466396 |date=March 27, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Axelrod and Hamilton demonstrated that individual agents following a simple rule set of (1) cooperate on the first turn and (2) thereafter replicate the partner's previous action were able to develop "norms" of cooperation and sanctioning in the absence of canonical sociological constructs such as demographics, values, religion, and culture as preconditions or mediators of cooperation.&lt;ref name="Cooperation"/&gt; Throughout the 1990s, scholars like [[William Sims Bainbridge]], [[Kathleen Carley]], [[Michael Macy]],  and [[John Skvoretz]] developed multi-agent-based models of [[generalized reciprocity]], [[prejudice]], [[social influence]], and organizational [[information processing]]. In 1999, [[Nigel Gilbert]] published the first textbook on Social Simulation: ''Simulation for the social scientist'' and established its most relevant journal: the [[Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation]].

===Data mining and social network analysis===
{{main|Data mining|Social network analysis}}
Independent from developments in computational models of social systems, social network analysis emerged in the 1970s and 1980s from advances in graph theory, statistics, and studies of social structure as a distinct analytical method and was articulated and employed by sociologists like [[James Samuel Coleman|James S. Coleman]], [[Harrison White]], [[Linton Freeman]], [[J. Clyde Mitchell]], [[Mark Granovetter]], [[Ronald Burt]], and [[Barry Wellman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Development of Social Network Analysis: A Study in the Sociology of Science |first=Linton C. |last=Freeman |publisher=Empirical Press |location=Vancouver, BC |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing pervasiveness of computing and telecommunication technologies throughout the 1980s and 1990s demanded analytical techniques, such as [[network theory|network analysis]] and [[multilevel modeling]], that could scale to increasingly complex and large data sets. The most recent wave of computational sociology, rather than employing simulations, uses network analysis and advanced statistical techniques to analyze large-scale computer databases of electronic proxies for behavioral data. Electronic records such as email and instant message records, hyperlinks on the [[World Wide Web]], mobile phone usage, and discussion on [[Usenet]] allow social scientists to directly observe and analyze social behavior at multiple points in time and multiple levels of analysis without the constraints of traditional empirical methods such as interviews, participant observation, or survey instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/323/5915/721 |title=Life in the network: the coming age of computational social science|first9=J|last10=Gutmann|first10=M.|last11=Jebara|first11=T.|last12=King|first12=G.|last13=Macy|first13=M.|last14=Roy|first14=D.|last15=Van Alstyne|first15=M.|last9=Fowler|first8=N|last8=Contractor|first7=N|last7=Christakis|first6=D|last6=Brewer|first5=AL|last5=Barabasi|first4=S |journal=Science|last4=Aral |date=February 6, 2009|first3=L |volume=323|pmid=19197046 |issue=5915|last3=Adamic |pages=721–723|pmc=2745217 |doi=10.1126/science.1167742 |first1=David |last1=Lazer |first2=Alex |last2=Pentland |display-authors=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continued improvements in [[machine learning]] algorithms likewise have permitted social scientists and entrepreneurs to use novel techniques to identify latent and meaningful patterns of social interaction and evolution in large electronic datasets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Jaideep |last1=Srivastava |first2=Robert |last2=Cooley |first3=Mukund |last3=Deshpande |first4=Pang-Ning |last4=Tan |journal=Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining |title=Web usage mining: discovery and applications of usage patterns from Web data|volume=1 |year=2000 |pages=12–23 |doi=10.1145/846183.846188|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0169-7552(98)00110-X|title=The anatomy of a large-scale hypertextual Web search engine |first1=Sergey |last1=Brin |first2=Lawrence |last2=Page |journal=Computer Networks and ISDN Systems |volume=30 |issue=1–7 |pages=107–117 |date=April 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The automatic parsing of textual corpora has enabled the extraction of actors and their relational networks on a vast scale, 
turning textual data into network data.  The resulting networks, which can contain thousands of nodes, are then analysed by using tools from Network theory to identify the key actors, the key communities or parties, and general properties such as robustness or structural stability of the overall network, or centrality of certain nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Network analysis of narrative content in large corpora|author1=S Sudhahar|author2=G De Fazio|author3=R Franzosi|author4=N Cristianini|journal=Natural Language Engineering|volume=21|issue=1|pages=1–32|year=2013|doi=10.1017/S1351324913000247 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This automates the approach introduced by quantitative narrative analysis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quantitative Narrative Analysis|author=Roberto Franzosi|publisher=Emory University|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereby subject-verb-object triplets are identified with pairs of actors linked by an action, or pairs formed by actor-object.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Computational content analysis===
[[Content analysis]] has been a traditional part of social sciences and media studies for a long time. The automation of content analysis has allowed a "[[big data]]" revolution to take place in that field, with studies in social media and newspaper content that include millions of news items. [[Gender bias]], [[readability]], content similarity, reader preferences, and even mood have been analyzed based on [[text mining]] methods over millions of documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=I.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
Computational sociology, as with any field of study, faces a set of challenges.&lt;ref name="MCSS"&gt;Conte, Rosaria, et al. "Manifesto of computational social science." The European Physical Journal Special Topics 214.1 (2012): 325-346.&lt;/ref&gt; These challenges need to be handled meaningfully so as to make the maximum impact on society.

===Levels and their interactions===
Each society that is formed tends to be in one level or the other and there exists tendencies of interactions between and across these levels. Levels need not only be micro-level or macro-level in nature. There can be intermediate levels in which a society exists say - groups, networks, communities etc.&lt;ref name="MCSS" /&gt;

The question however arises as to how to identify these levels and how they come into existence? And once they are in existence how do they interact within themselves and with other levels?

If we view entities(agents) as nodes and the connections between them as the edges, we see the formation of networks. The connections in these networks do not come about based on just objective relationships between the entities, rather they are decided upon by factors chosen by the participating entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Egu´ıluz|first1=V. M.|last2=Zimmermann|first2=M. G.|last3=Cela-Conde|first3=C. J.|last4=San Miguel|first4=M.|title=American Journal of Sociology|issue=2005|pages=110, 977}}&lt;/ref&gt; The challenge with this process is that, it is difficult to identify when a set of entities will form a network. These networks may be of trust networks, co-operation networks, dependence networks etc. There have been cases where heterogeneous set of entities have shown to form strong and meaningful networks among themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sichman|first1=J. S.|last2=Conte|first2=R.|title=Computational &amp; Mathematical Organization Theory|issue=2002|pages=8(2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ehrhardt|first1=G.|last2=Marsili|first2=M.|last3=Vega-Redondo|first3=F.|title=Physical Review E|issue=2006|pages=74(3)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As discussed previously, societies fall into levels and in one such level, the individual level, a micro-macro link&lt;ref&gt;Billari, Francesco C. Agent-based computational modelling: applications in demography, social, economic and environmental sciences. Taylor &amp; Francis, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the interactions which create higher-levels. There are a set of questions that needs to be answered regarding these Micro-Macro links. How they are formed? When do they converge? What is the feedback pushed to the lower levels and how are they pushed?

Another major challenge in this category concerns the validity of information and their sources. In recent years there has been a boom in information gathering and processing. However, little attention was paid to the spread of false information between the societies. Tracing back the sources and finding ownership of such information is difficult.

===Culture modeling===
The evolution of the networks and levels in the society brings about cultural diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Centola|first1=D.|last2=Gonz´alez-Avella|first2=J. C.|last3=Egu´ıluz|first3=V. M.|last4=San Miguel|first4=M.|title=Journal of Conflict Resolution|issue=2007|pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; A thought which arises however is that, when people tend to interact and become more accepting of other cultures and beliefs, how is it that diversity still persists? Why is there no convergence? A major challenge is how to model these diversities. Are there external factors like mass media, locality of societies etc. which influence the evolution or persistence of cultural diversities?{{Citation needed|reason=Sounds just like personal thoughts|date=May 2017}}

===Experimentation and evaluation===
Any study or modelling when combined with experimentation needs to be able to address the questions being asked. [[Computational social science]] deals with large scale data and the challenge becomes much more evident as the scale grows. How would one design informative simulations on a large scale? And even if a large scale simulation is brought up, how is the evaluation supposed to be performed?

===Model choice and model complexities===
Another challenge is identifying the models that would best fit the data and the complexities of these models. These models would help us predict how societies might evolve over time and provide possible explanations on how things work.&lt;ref&gt;Weisberg, Michael. When less is more: Tradeoffs and idealization in model building. Diss. stanford university, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Generative models====
Generative models helps us to perform extensive qualitative analysis in a controlled fashion. A model proposed by Epstein, is the agent-based simulation, which talks about identifying an initial set of heterogeneous entities(agents) and observe their evolution and growth based on simple local rules.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Joshua M. Generative social science: Studies in agent-based computational modeling. Princeton University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

But what are these local rules? How does one identify them for a set of heterogeneous agents? Evaluation and impact of these rules state a whole new set of difficulties.

====Heterogeneous or ensemble models====
Integrating simple models which perform better on individual tasks to form a Hybrid model is an approach that can be looked into{{Citation needed|reason=unsupported claims|date=May 2017}}. These models can offer better performance and understanding of the data. However the trade-off of identifying and having a deep understanding of the interactions between these simple models arises when one needs to come up with one combined, well performing model. Also, coming up with tools and applications to help analyse and visualize the data based on these hybrid models is another added challenge.

==Impact==
Computational sociology can bring impacts to science, technology and society.&lt;ref name="MCSS" /&gt;

===Impact on science===
In order for the study of computational sociology to be effective, there has to be valuable innovations. These innovation can be of the form of new data analytics tools, better models and algorithms. The advent of such innovation will be a boon for the scientific community in large. {{Citation needed|reason=citation for claim on innovation and the type of innovation|date=May 2017}}

===Impact on society===
One of the major challenges of computational sociology is the modelling of social processes {{Citation needed|reason=to support the claim for need of modeling of social processes|date=May 2017}}. Various law and policy makers would be able to see efficient and effective paths to issue new guidelines and the mass in general would be able to evaluate and gain fair understanding of the options presented in front of them enabling an open and well balanced decision process. {{Citation needed|reason=unsupported claims|date=May 2017}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14650">The '''Cultural Olympiad Digital Edition''', or '''CODE''', was a digital art showcase at the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in Vancouver, Canada. The festival, which lasted from February 4 to 21, was the first of its kind at a major sporting event, showcasing the new digital media styles in art, music, and film.

First conceived in 2007, the growth of social networking sites contributed to the eventual popularity of the event. One of the installations, Vectorial Elevation (a spotlight-based light installation over Vancouver's English bay), had over 20,000 individual design submissions.

CODE Live was curated by digital artist Malcolm Levy.&lt;ref name=whitehotinterview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whitehotmagazine.com/articles/curator-code-live-2010-olympics/2027|title=March 2010: Interview with Malcolm Levy, Curator, Code Live, 2010 Olympics|last=Kordoski|first=Kyra|publisher=White Hot Magazine|date=March 2010|accessdate=2012-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vancouver public spaces==
Throughout the time of the CODE festival, not only a number of small areas turned into exhibition areas, but the city itself was transformed by digital art displays. Some of these pieces were: 
*Vectorial Elevation: Rafael Lozano-Hemmer (Canada)
*Fearless Mobile, OMG IM ON DOT TV, Untold Histories: W2 Community Media Arts Society (Canada)
*Glocal Urban Screen Project: Surrey Art Gallery (Canada)
*Intersection 2010: Bright Light: Presented by the City of Vancouver (Canada)
*NeoGrafik: NomIg (Ed Jordan, Stephanie MacKay), Alexis Laurence
*PaCuBoxes: Tom Kuo, co-presentation with the Canadian Film Centre (Canada)

All these installations are attempting to connect to the largest audiences possible, unlike the smaller exhibits.

==CODE Collections==
One internet Installation, CODE collections, showcased various aspects of landscape, culture, and people of Canada. Each collection was prefaced by a short introduction in both English and French, followed by pages of submitted photographs.

==CODE screen==
Accessible wherever one could find a computer screen, this section of CODE showcased creations of Canada's visual artists. Nearly 20 recipients of the [[Governor General's Awards]] for Visual and Media Arts had work on display. Using an application, users were able to use an interactive catalog to easily find something they could enjoy.

Some pieces are:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12730">In [[combinatorics]], a '''Davenport–Schinzel sequence''' is a [[sequence]] of symbols in which the number of times any two symbols may appear in alternation is limited. The maximum possible length of a Davenport–Schinzel sequence is bounded by the number of its distinct symbols multiplied by a small but nonconstant factor that depends on the number of alternations that are allowed. Davenport–Schinzel sequences were first defined in 1965 by [[Harold Davenport]] and [[Andrzej Schinzel]] to analyze [[linear differential equation]]s. Following {{harvtxt|Atallah|1985}} these sequences and their length bounds have also become a standard tool in [[discrete geometry]] and in the analysis of [[Computational geometry|geometric algorithms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sharir|Agarwal|1995}}, pp. x and 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
A finite sequence ''U'' = ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''u''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is said to be a Davenport–Schinzel sequence of order ''s'' if it satisfies the following two properties:
#No two consecutive values in the sequence are equal to each other.
#If ''x'' and ''y'' are two distinct values occurring in the sequence, then the sequence does not contain a subsequence ... ''x'', ... ''y'', ..., ''x'', ..., ''y'', ... consisting of ''s''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2 values alternating between ''x'' and ''y''.

For instance, the sequence
:1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 4, 5, 2, 3
is a Davenport–Schinzel sequence of order 3: it contains alternating subsequences of length four, such as ...1, ... 2, ... 1, ... 2, ... (which appears in four different ways as a subsequence of the whole sequence) but it does not contain any alternating subsequences of length five.

If a Davenport–Schinzel sequence of order ''s'' includes ''n'' distinct values, it is called an (''n'',''s'') Davenport–Schinzel sequence, or a ''DS''(''n'',''s'')-sequence.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvtxt|Sharir|Agarwal|1995}}, p. 1, for this notation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Length bounds==
The complexity of ''DS''(''n'',''s'')-sequence has been analyzed [[asymptotics|asymptotically]] in the limit as ''n'' goes to infinity, with the assumption that ''s'' is a fixed constant, and nearly tight bounds are known for all ''s''. Let λ&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') denote the length of the longest ''DS''(''n'',''s'')-sequence. The best bounds known on λ&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; involve the [[Ackermann function#Inverse|inverse Ackermann function]]
:&amp;alpha;(''n'') = min { ''m'' | ''A''(''m'',''m'') ≥ ''n'' },
where ''A'' is the Ackermann function. Due to the very rapid growth of the Ackermann function, its inverse α grows very slowly, and is at most four for problems of any practical size.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sharir|Agarwal|1995}}, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using [[big O notation|big O and big &amp;Theta; notation]], the following bounds are known:
*&lt;math&gt;\lambda_0(n)=1&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;\lambda_1(n)=n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="DS12"&gt;{{harvtxt|Sharir|Agarwal|1995}}, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\lambda_2(n)=2n-1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="DS12" /&gt;

==Application to lower envelopes==
[[Image:Line segment lower envelope.svg|thumb|300px|A Davenport–Schinzel sequence of order 3 formed by the lower envelope of line segments.]]
The ''lower envelope'' of a set of functions ƒ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') of a [[Function of a real variable|real variable]] ''x'' is the function given by their pointwise minimum:
:&amp;fnof;(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;min&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;fnof;&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'').
Suppose that these functions are particularly well behaved: they are all [[continuous function|continuous]], and any two of them are equal on at most ''s'' values. With these assumptions, the real line can be partitioned into finitely many [[interval (mathematics)|intervals]] within which one function has values smaller than all of the other functions. The sequence of these intervals, labeled by the minimizing function within each interval, forms a Davenport–Schinzel sequence of order ''s''. Thus, any upper bound on the complexity of a Davenport–Schinzel sequence of this order also bounds the number of intervals in this representation of the lower envelope.

In the original application of Davenport and Schinzel, the functions under consideration were a set of different solutions to the same homogeneous [[linear differential equation]] of order ''s''. Any two distinct solutions can have at most ''s'' values in common, so the lower envelope of a set of ''n'' distinct solutions forms a ''DS''(''n'',''s'')-sequence.

The same concept of a lower envelope can also be applied to functions that are only [[piecewise]] continuous or that are defined only over intervals of the real line; however, in this case, the points of discontinuity of the functions and the endpoints of the interval within which each function is defined add to the order of the sequence. For instance, a non-vertical line segment in the plane can be interpreted as the [[graph of a function]] mapping an interval of ''x'' values to their corresponding ''y'' values, and the lower envelope of a collection of line segments forms a Davenport–Schinzel sequence of order three because any two line segments can form an alternating subsequence with length at most four.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2201">In [[psychoanalysis]], '''decathexis''' is the withdrawal of [[cathexis]] from an idea or [[Instinct#In psychology|instinctual]] object.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/decathexis-reference/decathexis Paul Denis, 'Decathexis']&lt;/ref&gt;

Decathexis is the process of dis-investment of mental or emotional energy in a person, object, or idea.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Calvin S. ''A Primer of Freudian Psychology''. New York: Mentor, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narcissism==

In [[narcissistic neurosis]], cathexis is withdrawn from external instinctual objects (or rather their unconscious representations)&lt;ref&gt;J-M Quinodoz, ''Reading Freud'' (2005) p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; and turned on the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] - a process Freud highlighted in the [[Daniel Paul Schreber|Schreber]] case, and linked to the subject's ensuing [[megalomania]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (PFL 9) p. 208-11&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar decathexis of energy has been linked to the emergence of symptoms of [[hypochondriasis]],&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; as well as of [[melancholia]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 266-7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[André Green (psychoanalyst)|André Green]] saw decathexis as the product of the [[death drive]], blanking out the possibility of thinking by a process of what he called de-objectilizing.&lt;ref&gt;J-M Quinodoz, ''Reading Freud'' (2005) p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grief==
Decathexis of the lost person in grief was seen as a regular part of the mourning process by Freud, although later analysts have argued that such decathexis was rather the result of inhibited or partial mourning, not of successful mourning.&lt;ref&gt;Lora H. Tessman, ''The Analyst's Analyst Within'' (2003) p. 236-7&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6396">In [[mathematics]], and particularly in [[axiomatic set theory]], the '''diamond principle''' {{math|◊}} is a [[combinatorial principle]] introduced by [[Ronald Jensen]] in {{harvtxt|Jensen|1972}} that holds in the [[constructible universe]] ({{math|''L''}}) and that implies the [[continuum hypothesis]]. Jensen extracted the diamond principle from his proof that the [[Axiom of constructibility]] ({{math|''V'' {{=}} ''L''}}) implies the existence of a [[Suslin tree]].

== Definitions ==
The diamond principle {{math|◊}} says that there exists a '''{{vanchor|◊-sequence}}''', in other words sets {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;'' ⊆ ''α''}} for {{math|''α'' &lt; ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} such that for any subset {{math|''A''}} of [[First uncountable ordinal|ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]] the set of {{math|''α''}} with {{math|''A'' ∩ ''α'' {{=}} ''A&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;''}}  is [[Stationary set|stationary]] in {{math|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

There are several equivalent forms of the diamond principle. One states that there is a countable collection {{math|'''A'''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of subsets of {{math|''α''}} for each countable ordinal {{math|''α''}} such that for any subset {{math|''A''}} of {{math|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} there is a stationary subset {{math|''C''}} of {{math|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} such that for all {{math|''α''}} in {{math|''C''}} we have {{math|''A'' ∩ ''α'' ∈ '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''C'' ∩ ''α''  ∈ '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Another equivalent form states that there exist sets {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt; ⊆ ''α''}} for {{math|''α'' &lt; ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} such that for any subset {{mvar|''A''}} of {{mvar|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} there is at least one infinite {{mvar|''α''}} with {{mvar|''A'' ∩ ''α'' {{=}} ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

More generally, for a given [[cardinal number]] {{math|''κ''}} and a [[stationary set]] {{math|''S'' ⊆ ''κ''}}, the statement {{math|◊&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (sometimes written {{math|◊(''S'')}} or {{math|◊&lt;sub&gt;''κ''&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'')}}) is the statement that there is a [[sequence]] {{math|⟨''A&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''α'' ∈ ''S''⟩}} such that

* each {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;'' ⊆ ''α''}}
* for every {{math|''A'' ⊆ ''κ''}}, {{math|{''α'' ∈ ''S'' : ''A'' ∩ ''α'' {{=}} ''A&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} is stationary in {{math|''κ''}}

The principle {{math|◊&lt;sub&gt;''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the same as {{math|◊}}.

The diamond-plus principle {{math|◊&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}} says that there exists a '''{{math|◊&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}}-sequence''', in other words a countable collection {{math|'''A'''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of subsets of {{math|''α''}} for each countable ordinal α such that for any subset {{math|''A''}} of {{math|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} there is a closed unbounded subset {{math|''C''}} of {{math|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} such that for all {{math|''α''}} in {{math|''C''}} we have {{math|''A'' ∩ ''α'' ∈ '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''C'' ∩ ''α'' ∈ '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

== Properties and use ==

{{harvtxt|Jensen|1972}} showed that the diamond principle {{math|◊}} implies the existence of [[Suslin tree]]s. He also showed that [[V=L|{{math|''V'' {{=}} ''L''}}]] implies the diamond-plus principle, which implies the diamond principle, which implies [[continuum hypothesis|CH]]. In particular the diamond principle and the diamond-plus principle are both [[Independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] of the axioms of ZFC. Also {{math|[[clubsuit|♣]] + CH}} implies {{math|◊}}, but [[Saharon Shelah|Shelah]] gave models of {{math|♣ + ¬ CH,}} so {{math|◊}} and {{math|♣}} are not equivalent (rather, {{math|♣}} is weaker than {{math|◊}}).

The diamond principle {{math|◊}} does not imply the existence of a [[Kurepa tree]], but the stronger {{math|◊&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}} principle implies both the {{math|◊}} principle and the existence of a Kurepa tree.

{{harvtxt|Akemann|Weaver|2004}} used {{math|◊}} to construct a [[C* algebra|{{math|''C''*}}-algebra]] serving as a [[counterexample]] to [[Naimark's problem]].

For all cardinals {{math|''κ''}} and [[stationary subset]]s {{math|''S'' ⊆ ''κ''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|◊&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;}} holds in the [[constructible universe]]. {{harvtxt|Shelah|2010}} proved that for {{math|''κ'' &gt; ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|◊{{su|b=''κ''|p=+}}(''S'')}} follows from {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''κ''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''κ''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}} for stationary {{math|''S''}} that do not contain ordinals of cofinality {{math|''κ''}}.

Shelah showed that the diamond principle solves the [[Whitehead problem]] by implying that every [[Whitehead problem|Whitehead group]] is free.

'''''Evolution and the Humanities''''' is a 1987 book by [[David Holbrook]] that attacks [[Darwinism|Darwinian evolution]]. The book rejects [[Reductionism|reductionist biology]] and takes influence from [[Michael Polanyi]] and [[Vitalism|vitalist]] philosophy.&lt;ref name="ncse"&gt;[http://ncse.com/cej/8/2/evolution-humanities "Evolution and the Humanities"]. [[National Center for Science Education]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Reception==

The book has been heavily criticized by academics. [[Martin Stuart-Fox]] noted that Holbrook's criticism of [[natural selection]] was a "cobble together, in a sort of scissors-and-paste criticism... the book contains no vigorous argument at all. Not only is Holbrook very obviously no scientist, he is no philosopher either."&lt;ref&gt;Stuart-Fox, Martin. (1988). ''Evolution and the Humanities by David Holbrook''. ''The Centennial Review''. Vol. 32, No. 3, pp. 318-319.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecologist [[Arthur M. Shapiro]] in a review for the [[National Center for Science Education]] commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;David Holbrook, Fellow of Downing College, Cambridge, has written a polemic not so much against evolution as against scientific reductionism (which he sees incarnate in neo-Darwinism). He proceeds from revulsion at the existentialist vision of "life as a 'scientific accident.' " He's no creationist but, rather, a from-the-gut free-form vitalist—just as preoccupied with the perceived moral consequences of the Darwinian revolution as any Bible-thumping moralist could be. As usual, he conflates science with scientism and evolution with evolutionism, materialism, and atheism."&lt;ref name="ncse"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book is said to have been poorly edited and riddled with errors.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, Ruth. (1989). ''Reviewed Works: Theories of Human Evolution: A Century of Debate, 1844-1944 by Peter J. Bowler; Evolution and the Humanities by David Holbrook; The Age of Science: The Scientific World-View in the Nineteenth Century by David Knight''. ''[[Victorian Studies]]''. Vol. 32, No. 2, pp. 276-278.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26923">The '''face inversion effect''' is a phenomenon where identifying inverted (upside-down) [[face]]s compared to upright faces is much more difficult than doing the same for non-facial objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281640103_The_face_inversion_effect-Parts_and_wholes_Individual_features_and_their_configuration|title=The face inversion effect—Parts and wholes: Individual features and their configuration|last=Civile|first=Ciro|last2=Mclaren|first2=Rossy|last3=Mclaren|first3=I.P.L.|date=2013-09-23|volume=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yin|first=Robert K.|date=1969|title=Looking at upside-down faces.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/h0027474|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=81|issue=1|pages=141–145|doi=10.1037/h0027474|issn=0022-1015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical study examining the face inversion effect would have images of the inverted and upright object presented to participants and time how long it takes them to recognise that object as what it actually is (i.e. a picture of a face as a face). The face inversion effect occurs when, compared to other objects, it takes a disproportionately longer time to recognise faces when they are inverted as opposed to upright.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farah|first=M.

Faces are normally processed in the special face-selective regions of the brain, such as the [[fusiform face area]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kanwisher|first=Nancy|last2=Yovel|first2=Galit|date=2006-12-29|title=The fusiform face area: a cortical region specialized for the perception of faces 9|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences |volume=361|issue=1476|pages=2109–2128|doi=10.1098/rstb.2006.1934 |pmc=1857737|pmid=17118927}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, processing inverted faces involves both face-selective regions and the scene and object recognition regions of the [[Parahippocampal Place Area|parahippocampal place area]] and lateral [[occipital cortex]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; There seems to be something different about inverted faces that requires them to also involve these scene and object processing mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pitcher|first=David|last2=Duchaine|first2=Bradley|last3=Walsh|first3=Vincent|last4=Yovel|first4=Galit|last5=Kanwisher|first5=Nancy|date=2011|title=The role of lateral occipital face and object areas in the face inversion effect|url=https://doi-org.ezproxy.canterbury.ac.nz/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.08.020|journal=Neuropsychologia|volume=49|issue=12|pages=3448–3453|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.08.020|issn=0028-3932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most supported explanation for why faces take longer to recognise when they are inverted is the configural information hypothesis. The configural information hypothesis states that faces are processed with the use of configural information to form a [[holistic]] (whole) representation of a face. Objects, however, are not processed in this configural way. Instead, they are processed featurally (in parts). Inverting a face disrupts configural processing, forcing it to instead be processed featurally like other objects. This causes a delay since it takes longer to form a representation of a face with only local information.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Neural systems of face recognition ==
[[File:Fusiform Face Area.png|thumb|Location of the Fusiform Face Area]]Faces are processed in separate areas of the brain to other stimuli, such as scenes or non-facial objects. For example, the [[fusiform face area]] (FFA) is a face-selective region in the brain that is only used for facial processing.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The FFA responds more to upright but not inverted faces, demonstrating that inverted faces are not detected the same way that upright faces are.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yovel|first=Galit|last2=Kanwisher|first2=Nancy|date=2005|title=The Neural Basis of the Behavioral Face-Inversion Effect|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982205014107|journal=Current Biology|volume=15|issue=24|pages=2256–2262|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2005.10.072|issn=0960-9822}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scene-selective [[Parahippocampal gyrus|parahippocampal place area]] (PPA) processes places, or scenes of the visual environment.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Epstein|first=Russell|last2=Kanwisher|first2=Nancy|date=1998|title=A cortical representation of the local visual environment|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/33402|journal=Nature|volume=392|issue=6676|pages=598–601|doi=10.1038/33402|pmid=9560155|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; The object recognition area in the lateral [[occipital cortex]] (LOC) is involved in the processing of objects.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malach|first=R|last2=Reppas|first2=J B|last3=Benson|first3=R R|last4=Kwong|first4=K K|last5=Jiang|first5=H|last6=Kennedy|first6=W A|last7=Ledden|first7=P J|last8=Brady|first8=T J|last9=Rosen|first9=B R|date=1995-08-29|title=Object-related activity revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging in human occipital cortex.|pmc=41110|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=92|issue=18|pages=8135–8139|issn=0027-8424|pmid=7667258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, these regions are used to process inverted, but not upright faces. This suggests that there is something special about inverted compared to upright faces that requires them to involve object and scene processing regions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There is still some activity in face recognition regions when viewing inverted faces.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haxby|first=James V|last2=Ungerleider|first2=Leslie G|last3=Clark|first3=Vincent P|last4=Schouten|first4=Jennifer L|last5=Hoffman|first5=Elizabeth A|last6=Martin|first6=Alex|date=1999|title=The Effect of Face Inversion on Activity in Human Neural Systems for Face and Object Perception|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/s0896-6273(00)80690-x|journal=Neuron|volume=22|issue=1|pages=189–199|doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(00)80690-x|issn=0896-6273}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence has found that a face-selective region in the brain known as the [[Occipital lobe|occipital]] face area (OFA) is involved in the processing of both upright and inverted faces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Overall, face and object processing mechanisms seem to be separate in the brain. Recognising upright faces involves special facial recognition regions, but recognising inverted faces involves both face and non-facial stimuli recognition regions.

== Face vs. object recognition processes ==

=== Face recognition ===

==== Configural information ====
Configural information, also known as relational information, helps people to quickly recognise faces. It involves the arrangement of [[facial feature]]s, such as the [[eye]]s and [[nose]]. There are two types of configural information: first-order relational information and second-order relational information.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Civile|first=Ciro|last2=McLaren|first2=Rossy|last3=McLaren|first3=Ian P. L.|date=2016|title=The Face Inversion Effect: Roles of First and Second-Order Configural Information|jstor=10.5406/amerjpsyc.129.1.0023|journal=The American Journal of Psychology|volume=129|issue=1|pages=23–35|doi=10.5406/amerjpsyc.129.1.0023|pmid=27029104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First-order relational information consists of the spatial relationships between different features of the face. These relationships between facial features are common to most people, for example, having the mouth located under the nose. First-order relational information therefore helps to identify a face as a face and not some other object.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Second-order relational information is the size of the relationships between the features of the face, relative to a prototype (a model of what a face should look like). This type of information helps to distinguish one face from another because it differs between different faces.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Holistic processing ====
The [[holistic]] processing of faces describes the perception of faces as wholes, rather than the sum of their parts. This means that facial features (such as the eyes or nose) are not explicitly represented in the brain on their own, rather, the entire face is represented.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tanaka|first=James W.|last2=Farah|first2=Martha J.|date=1993|title=Parts and wholes in face recognition|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14640749308401045|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=46|issue=2|pages=225–245|via=|doi=10.1080/14640749308401045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the configural information hypothesis of [[Face perception|face recognition]], recognising faces involves two stages that use configural information to form holistic representations of faces.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taubert|first=Jessica|last2=Apthorp|first2=Deborah|last3=Aagten-Murphy|first3=David|last4=Alais|first4=David|date=2011|title=The role of holistic processing in face perception: Evidence from the face inversion effect|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.visres.2011.04.002|journal=Vision Research|volume=51|issue=11|pages=1273–1278|doi=10.1016/j.visres.2011.04.002|issn=0042-6989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study demonstrated that face-selective activity in the brain was delayed when the configural information of faces was disrupted (for example, when faces were inverted).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1999-07-01|title=Spatio-temporal localization of the face inversion effect: an event-related potentials study|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301051199000137|journal=Biological Psychology|volume=50|issue=3|pages=173–189|doi=10.1016/S0301-0511(99)00013-7|issn=0301-0511|last1=Rossion|first1=B}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that it took longer for the participants to recognise the faces they were viewing as faces and not other (non-facial) objects. The configural information explanation for facial recognition is therefore supported by the presence of the face inversion effect (a delay when faces are inverted).

==== Stages of face recognition ====
The first stage of recognising faces in the configural information hypothesis is first-level information processing. This stage uses first-order relational information to detect a face (i.e. to determine that a face is actually a face and not another object). Building a holistic representation of a face occurs at this early stage of face processing, to allow faces to be detected quickly.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

The next stage, second-level information processing, distinguishes one face from another with the use of second-order relational information.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Object recognition ===
An inversion effect does not seem to occur for non-facial objects, suggesting that faces and other objects are not processed in the same way.

Face recognition involves configural information to process faces holistically. However, object recognition does not use configural information to form a holistic representation. Instead, each part of the object is processed independently to allow it to be recognised. This is known as a featural recognition method.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Additionally, an explicit representation of each part of the object is made, rather than a representation of the object as a whole.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

== Theories ==

=== Configural information hypothesis ===
According to the configural information hypothesis, the face inversion effect occurs because configural information can no longer be used to build a holistic representation of a face. Inverted faces are instead processed like objects, using local information (i.e. the individual features of the face) instead of configural information.

A delay is caused when processing inverted faces compared to upright faces. This is because the specific holistic mechanism (see [[#Holistic processing|holistic processing]]) that allows faces to be quickly detected is absent when processing inverted faces. Only local information is available when viewing inverted faces, disrupting this early recognition stage and therefore preventing faces from being detected as quickly. Instead, independent features are put together piece-by-piece to form a representation of the object (a face) and allow the viewer to recognise what it is.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freire|first=Alejo|last2=Lee|first2=Kang|last3=Symons|first3=Lawrence A|date=2000|title=The Face-Inversion Effect as a Deficit in the Encoding of Configural Information: Direct Evidence|url=https://doi-org.ezproxy.canterbury.ac.nz/10.1068/p3012|journal=Perception|volume=29|issue=2|pages=159–170|doi=10.1068/p3012|issn=0301-0066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alternate hypotheses ===
Although the configural processing hypothesis is a popular explanation for the face inversion effect, there have been some challenges to this theory. In particular, it has been suggested that faces and objects are both recognised using featural processing mechanisms, instead of holistic processing for faces and featural processing for objects.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matsuyoshi|first=Daisuke|last2=Morita|first2=Tomoyo|last3=Kochiyama|first3=Takanori|last4=Tanabe|first4=Hiroki C.|last5=Sadato|first5=Norihiro|last6=Kakigi|first6=Ryusuke|date=2015-03-11|title=Dissociable Cortical Pathways for Qualitative and Quantitative Mechanisms in the Face Inversion Effect|url=http://www.jneurosci.org/content/35/10/4268|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|volume=35|issue=10|pages=4268–4279|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3960-14.2015|issn=0270-6474|pmid=25762673}}&lt;/ref&gt; The face inversion effect is therefore not caused by delay from faces being processed as objects. Instead, another element is involved. Two potential explanations follow.

==== Perceptual learning ====
[[Perceptual]] learning is a common alternative explanation to the configural processing hypothesis for the face inversion effect. According to the perceptual learning theory, being presented with a stimulus (for example, faces or cars) more often makes that stimulus easier to recognise in the future.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wallis|first=Guy|date=2013|title=Toward a unified model of face and object recognition in the human visual system|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00497/full|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00497|issn=1664-1078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most people are highly familiar with viewing upright faces. It follows that highly efficient mechanisms have been able to develop to the quick detection and identification of upright faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gold|first=J.|last2=Bennett|first2=P. J.|last3=Sekuler|first3=A. B.|date=1999|title=Signal but not noise changes with perceptual learning|url=https://dx.doi.org.ezproxy.canterbury.ac.nz/10.1038/46027|journal=Nature|volume=402|issue=6758|pages=176–178|doi=10.1038/46027|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the face inversion effect would therefore be caused by an increased amount of experience with perceiving and recognising upright faces compared to inverted faces.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sekuler|first=Allison B|last2=Gaspar|first2=Carl M|last3=Gold|first3=Jason M|last4=Bennett|first4=Patrick J|date=2004|title=Inversion Leads to Quantitative, Not Qualitative, Changes in Face Processing|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2004.02.028|journal=Current Biology|volume=14|issue=5|pages=391–396|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.02.028|issn=0960-9822}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Face-scheme incompatibility ====
The face-scheme incompatibility model has been proposed in order to explain some of the missing elements of the configural information hypothesis. According to the model, faces are processed and assigned meaning by the use of schemes and prototypes.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rakover|first=Sam S.|date=2013-08-01|title=Explaining the face-inversion effect: the face–scheme incompatibility (FSI) model|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-013-0388-1|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|volume=20|issue=4|pages=665–692|doi=10.3758/s13423-013-0388-1|issn=1069-9384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model defines a scheme as an abstract representation of the general structure of a face, including characteristics common to most faces (i.e. the structure of and relationships between facial features). A prototype refers to an image of what an average face would look like for a particular group (e.g. humans or monkeys). After being recognised as a face with the use of a scheme, new faces are added to a group by being evaluated for their similarity to that group's prototype.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

There are different schemes for upright and inverted faces: upright faces are more frequently viewed and thus have more efficient schemes than inverted faces. The face inversion effect is thus partly caused by less efficient schemes for processing the less familiar inverted form of faces.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This makes the face-scheme incompatibility model similar to the perceptual learning theory, because both consider the role of experience important in the quick recognition of faces.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Integration of theories ===
Instead of just one explanation for the face inversion effect, it is more likely that aspects of different theories apply. For example, faces could be processed with configural information but the role of experience may be important for quickly recognising a particular type of face (i.e. human or dog) by building schemes of this facial type.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

== Development ==
The ability to quickly detect and recognise faces was important in early human life, and is still useful today. For example, facial expressions can provide various signals important for [[communication]].&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=Karen L.|last2=Cohn|first2=Jeffrey F.|date=2001|title=Human Facial Expressions as Adaptations: Evolutionary Questions in Facial Expression Research|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=Suppl 33|pages=3–24|doi=10.1002/ajpa.2001|issn=0002-9483|pmc= 2238342|pmid=11786989|doi-broken-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldman|first=Alvin I.|last2=Sripada|first2=Chandra Sekhar|date=2005|title=Simulationist models of face-based emotion recognition|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2004.01.005|journal=Cognition|volume=94|issue=3|pages=193–213|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2004.01.005|pmid=15617671|issn=0010-0277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Highly efficient facial recognition mechanisms have therefore developed to support this ability.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

As [[human]]s get older, they become more familiar with upright human faces and continuously refine the mechanisms used to recognise them.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Passarotti|first=A.M.|last2=Smith|first2=J.|last3=DeLano|first3=M.|last4=Huang|first4=J.|date=2007|title=Developmental differences in the neural bases of the face inversion effect show progressive tuning of face-selective regions to the upright orientation|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.07.045|journal=NeuroImage|volume=34|issue=4|pages=1708–1722|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.07.045|issn=1053-8119}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process allows people to quickly detect faces around them, which helps with [[social interaction]].&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

By about the first year of life, [[infant]]s are familiar with faces in their upright form and are thus more prone to experiencing the face inversion effect. As they age, they get better at recognising faces and so the face inversion effect becomes stronger.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The increased strength of the face inversion effect over time supports the perceptual learning hypothesis, since more experience with faces results in increased susceptibility to the effect.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The more familiar a particular type of face (e.g. human or dog) is, the more susceptible one is to the face inversion effect for that face. This applies to both humans and other species. For example, older [[chimpanzee]]s familiar with human faces experienced the face inversion effect when viewing human faces, but the same result did not occur for younger chimpanzees familiar with chimpanzee faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dahl|first=Christoph D.|last2=Rasch|first2=Malte J.|last3=Tomonaga|first3=Masaki|last4=Adachi|first4=Ikuma|date=2013-08-27|title=The face inversion effect in non-human primates revisited - an investigation in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes)|url=https://doi.org/10.1038/srep02504|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=3|issue=1|pages=2504|doi=10.1038/srep02504|issn=2045-2322|pmc=3753590|pmid=23978930}}&lt;/ref&gt; The face inversion effect was also stronger for [[dog]] faces when they were viewed by dog experts.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This evidence demonstrates that familiarity with a particular type of face develops over time and appears to be necessary for the face inversion effect to occur.

== Exceptions ==
There are a number of conditions that may reduce or even eliminate the face inversion effect. This is because the mechanism used to recognise faces by forming holistic representations is absent or disrupted. This can cause faces to be processed the same way as other (non-facial) objects.  [[File:Prosopagnosia.jpg|thumb|Prosopagnosia: face blindness]]

=== Prosopagnosia ===
[[Prosopagnosia]] is a condition marked by an inability to recognise faces.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Busigny|first=Thomas|last2=Rossion|first2=Bruno|date=2010|title=Acquired prosopagnosia abolishes the face inversion effect|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2009.07.004|journal=Cortex|volume=46|issue=8|pages=965–981|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2009.07.004|issn=0010-9452}}&lt;/ref&gt; When those with prosopagnosia view faces, the [[fusiform gyrus]] (a facial recognition area of the brain) activates differently to how it would in someone without the condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grüter|first=Thomas|last2=Grüter|first2=Martina|last3=Carbon|first3=Claus-Christian|date=2008|title=Neural and genetic foundations of face recognition and prosopagnosia|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1348/174866407X231001|journal=Journal of Neuropsychology|volume=2|issue=1|pages=79–97|doi=10.1348/174866407x231001|issn=1748-6645}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, non-facial object recognition areas (such as the [[Anatomical terms of location|ventral]] occipitotemporal [[extrastriate cortex]]) are activated when viewing faces, suggesting that faces and objects are processed similarly.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Individuals with prosopagnosia can be unaffected or even benefit from face inversion in facial recognition tasks.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1995-07-01|title=The inverted face inversion effect in prosopagnosia: Evidence for mandatory, face-specific perceptual mechanisms|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004269899400273O|journal=Vision Research|volume=35|issue=14|pages=2089–2093|doi=10.1016/0042-6989(94)00273-O|issn=0042-6989|last1=Farah|first1=Martha J|last2=Wilson|first2=Kevin D|last3=Maxwell Drain|first3=H|last4=Tanaka|first4=James R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally, they process upright faces featurally, like objects. Inverted faces are also processed featurally rather than holistically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Avidan|first=Galia|last2=Tanzer|first2=Michal|last3=Behrmann|first3=Marlene|date=2011|title=Impaired holistic processing in congenital prosopagnosia |journal=Neuropsychologia|volume=49|issue=9|pages=2541–2552|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.05.002 |pmc=3137703|pmid=21601583}}&lt;/ref&gt; This demonstrates that there is no difference between the processing of upright and inverted faces, which explains why there is no disproportionate delay for recognising inverted faces.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Autism Spectrum Disorder ===
Like those with prosopagnosia, individuals with [[Autism-spectrum disorder|autism spectrum disorder]] (ASD) do not use a configural processing mechanism to form a holistic representation of a face.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van der Geest|first=J.N.|last2=Kemner|first2=C.|last3=Verbaten|first3=M.N.|last4=van Engeland|first4=H.|date=2002|title=Gaze behavior of children with pervasive developmental disorder toward human faces: a fixation time study|url=https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy.canterbury.ac.nz/doi/abs/10.1111/1469-7610.00055|journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry|volume=43|issue=5|pages=669–678|doi=10.1111/1469-7610.00055|issn=0021-9630}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they tend to process faces with the use of local or featural information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Behrmann|first=Marlene|last2=Avidan|first2=Galia|last3=Leonard|first3=Grace Lee|last4=Kimchi|first4=Rutie|last5=Luna|first5=Beatriz|last6=Humphreys|first6=Kate|last7=Minshew|first7=Nancy|date=2006|title=Configural processing in autism and its relationship to face processing |journal=Neuropsychologia|volume=44|issue=1|pages=110–129|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2005.04.002 |pmid=15907952}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the same featural mechanisms are used between processing upright faces, inverted faces, and objects. Consequentially, the face inversion effect is less likely to occur in those with ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Falck-Ytter|first=Terje|date=2008|title=Face inversion effects in autism: a combined looking time and pupillometric study |journal=Autism Research|volume=1|issue=5|pages=297–306|doi=10.1002/aur.45 |pmid=19360681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is some evidence that the development of a holistic facial recognition mechanism in those with ASD is simply delayed, rather than missing. This would mean that there would actually be a difference between the processing of upright and inverted faces. Those with ASD may therefore eventually become susceptible to the face inversion effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hedley|first=Darren|last2=Brewer|first2=Neil|last3=Young|first3=Robyn|date=2014-10-31|title=The Effect of Inversion on Face Recognition in Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder|url=https://doi-org.ezproxy.canterbury.ac.nz/10.1007/s10803-014-2297-1|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|volume=45|issue=5|pages=1368–1379|doi=10.1007/s10803-014-2297-1|issn=0162-3257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9418">'''Fire class''' is a term used to denote the type of [[fire]], in relation to the combustion materials which have (or could be) ignited.  This has onward impacts on the type of suppression or extinguishing materials which can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Fire Detection and Suppression Systems |edition=Third | publisher=International Fire Service Training Association | year=2005 | location=Stillwater, OK | page=9 | isbn=0-87939-267-3 |oclc=62785313}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Class letters are often assigned to the different types of fire, but these differ between territories.  There are separate standards in the United States, Europe, and Australia.

== Ordinary combustibles ==
[[File:Fire type A.svg|left|60px]]
Class A fires consist of ordinary combustibles such as wood, paper, fabric, and most kinds of trash.&lt;ref name=IFSTA-10&gt;{{cite book | title=Fire Detection and Suppression Systems |edition=Third | publisher=International Fire Service Training Association | year=2005 | location=Stillwater, OK | page=10 | isbn=0-87939-267-3 |oclc=62785313}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

== Flammable liquid and gas==
[[File:Fire type B.svg|left|60px]]
[[File:Extincteur-p1010032.jpg|thumb|upright|A carbon dioxide fire extinguisher rated for flammable liquids and gasses]]

These are fires whose fuel is flammable or combustible liquid or gas.  The US system designates all such fires "Class B".  In the European/Australian system, flammable liquids are designated "Class B" having flash point less than 100&amp;nbsp;°F (38°C), while burning gases are separately designated "Class C".  These fires follow the same basic fire tetrahedron (heat, fuel, oxygen, chemical reaction) as ordinary combustible fires, except that the fuel in question is a flammable liquid such as gasoline, or gas such as [[natural gas]]. A solid stream of water should never be used to extinguish this type because it can cause the fuel to scatter, spreading the flames. The most effective way to extinguish a liquid or gas fueled fire is by inhibiting the chemical chain reaction of the fire, which is done by dry chemical and [[Halomethane|Halon]] extinguishing agents, although smothering with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or, for liquids, foam is also effective. Halon has fallen out of favor in recent times because it is an ozone-depleting material; the Montreal Protocol declares that Halon should no longer be used. Chemicals such as [[FM-200]] are now the recommended halogenated suppressant.

== {{anchor|Electrical}} Electrical ==
[[File:Class C fire icon.svg|left|60px]]
Electrical fires are fires involving potentially energized [[Electricity|electrical]] equipment.  The US system designates these "Class C"; the Australian system designates them "Class E".  This sort of fire may be caused by short-circuiting machinery or overloaded electrical cables. These fires can be a severe hazard to firefighters using water or other conductive agents, as electricity may be conducted from the fire, through water, to the firefighter's body, and then [[ground (electrical)|earth]].  [[Electrical shocks]] have caused many firefighter deaths.

Electrical fire may be fought in the same way as an ordinary combustible fire, but water, foam, and other conductive agents are not to be used.  While the fire is or possibly could be electrically energized, it can be fought with any extinguishing agent rated for electrical fire. [[Carbon dioxide]] CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NOVEC 1230, [[FM-200]] and dry chemical powder extinguishers such as [[Purple-K|PKP]] and even baking soda are especially suited to extinguishing this sort of fire. PKP should be a last resort solution to extinguishing the fire due to its corrosive tendencies.  Once electricity is shut off to the equipment involved, it will generally become an ordinary combustible fire.

In Europe, "electrical fires" are no longer recognized as a separate class of fire as electricity itself cannot burn. The items around the electrical sources may burn. By turning the electrical source off, the fire can be fought by one of the other class of fire extinguishers{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}.

== Metal ==

Class D fires involve combustible metals - especially [[alkali metal]]s like [[lithium]] and [[potassium]], [[alkaline earth metal]]s such as [[magnesium]], and [[group 4 element]]s such as [[titanium]] and [[zirconium]].&lt;ref name=IFSTA-10/&gt;

Metal fires represent a unique hazard because people are often not aware of the characteristics of these fires and are not properly prepared to fight them. Therefore, even a small metal fire can spread and become a larger fire in the surrounding ordinary combustible materials. Certain metals [[Pyrophoricity|burn in contact with air]] or water (for example, [[sodium]]), which exaggerate this risk. Generally speaking, masses of combustible metals do not represent great fire risks because heat is conducted away from hot spots so efficiently that the heat of combustion cannot be maintained. In consequence, significant heat energy is required to ignite a contiguous mass of combustible metal.  Generally, metal fires are a hazard when the metal is in the form of sawdust, machine shavings or other metal "fines", which combust more rapidly than larger blocks. Metal fires can be ignited by the same ignition sources that would start other common fires.

Care must be taken when extinguishing metal fires. Water and other common firefighting agents can excite metal fires and make them worse. The [[National Fire Protection Association]] recommends that metal fires be fought with dry powder extinguishing agents that work by smothering and heat absorption.  The most common agents are [[sodium chloride]] granules and [[graphite]] powder. In recent years, powdered [[copper]] has also come into use. These ''dry powder'' extinguishers should not be confused with those that contain ''dry chemical'' agents.  The two are not the same, and only dry powder should be used to extinguish a metal fire.  Using a dry chemical extinguisher in error, in place of dry powder, can be ineffective or actually increase the intensity of a metal fire.

== Cooking oils and fats (kitchen fires) ==
[[File:Class K fire icon.svg|left]]
[[File:Chip-pan-fire.jpg|upright|thumb|Laboratory simulation of a chip pan fire: a beaker containing wax is heated until it catches fire.  A small amount of water is then poured into the beaker. The water sinks to the bottom and vaporizes instantly (''[[boilover]]''), ejecting a plume of burning liquid wax into the air.]]

Class K fires involve unsaturated cooking oils in well-insulated cooking appliances located in commercial kitchens.&lt;ref name=IFSTA-10/&gt;

Fires that involve [[cooking oil]]s or fats are designated “Class K” under the American system, and “Class F” under the European/Australian systems.  Though such fires are technically a subclass of the flammable liquid/gas class, the special characteristics of these types of fires, namely the higher flash point, are considered important enough to recognize separately.  Water mist can be used to extinguish such fires. As with Class B fires, a solid stream of water should never be used to extinguish this type because it can cause the fuel to scatter, spreading the flames. Appropriate fire extinguishers may also have hoods over them that help extinguish the fire. Sometimes [[fire blanket]]s are used to stop a fire in a kitchen or on a stove.

==1964–1965==

===Background===
In 1958, activist students organized [[SLATE]], a campus political party meaning a "slate" of candidates running on the same level – a same "slate." The students created SLATE to promote the right of student groups to support off-campus issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first = Dayna | last = Holz |url=http://www.slatearchives.org/history.htm |title=SLATE History |publisher= SLATE Archives |accessdate= 2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the fall of 1964, student activists, some of whom had traveled with the [[Freedom Riders]] and worked to register [[African American]] voters in Mississippi in the [[Freedom Summer]] project, set up information tables on campus and were soliciting donations for causes connected to the [[Civil Rights Movement]].  According to existing rules at the time, fundraising for political parties was limited exclusively to the Democratic and Republican school clubs.  There was also a mandatory "[[loyalty oath]]" required of faculty, which had led to dismissals and ongoing controversy over academic freedom.  [[Sol Stern]], a former radical who took part in the Free Speech Movement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/hearing-echoes-berkeley-student-activism-today/|title=Hearing echoes of Berkeley in student activism today|date=October 16, 2014|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated in a 2014 [[City Journal (New York City)|City Journal]] article that the group viewed the United States to be both racist and imperialistic and that the main intent after lifting Berkeley's loyalty oath was to build on the legacy of [[C. Wright Mills|C Wright Mills]] and weaken the Cold War consensus by promoting the ideas of the [[Cuban Revolution]].&lt;ref name="cityjournal"/&gt;

On September 14, 1964, Dean [[Katherine Towle]] announced that existing University regulations prohibiting advocacy of political causes or candidates, outside political speakers, recruitment of members, and fundraising by student organizations at the intersection of Bancroft and [[Telegraph Avenue|Telegraph]] Avenues would be "strictly enforced."&lt;ref name="uic.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/jofreeman/sixtiesprotest/berkeley.htm|title=Sixties Protest|work=uic.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jack Weinberg and sit-in===

On October 1, 1964, former graduate student [[Jack Weinberg]] was sitting at the [[Congress of Racial Equality|CORE]] table. He refused to show his identification to the campus police and was arrested. There was a spontaneous movement of students to surround the police car in which he was to be transported. The police car remained there for 32 hours, all while Weinberg was inside it. At one point, there may have been 3,000 students around the car.
The car was used as a speaker's podium and a continuous public discussion was held which continued until the charges against Weinberg were dropped.&lt;ref name="uic.edu"/&gt;
[[File:MarioSavio.JPG|thumb|right|[[Mario Savio]] leading a rally on the steps of [[Sproul Hall]] in 1966]]
On December 2, between 1,500 and 4,000 students went into [[Sproul Hall]] as a last resort in order to re-open negotiations with the administration on the subject of restrictions on political speech and action on campus.&lt;ref name="uic.edu"/&gt; Among other grievances was the fact that four of their leaders were being singled out for punishment. The demonstration was orderly; students studied, watched movies, and sang folk songs. [[Joan Baez]] was there to lead in the singing, as well as lend moral support. "Freedom classes" were held by teaching assistants on one floor, and a special Channukah service took place in the main lobby. On the steps of Sproul Hall, [[Mario Savio]]&lt;ref name=berk1960s&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailycal.org/2013/08/28/berkeley-in-the-sixties-aims-to-affect-the-present |title='Berkeley in the Sixties' aims to affect the present |first=Grace |last=Lovio |date=August 28, 2013 |work=[[The Daily Californian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave a famous speech:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;But we're a bunch of raw materials that don't mean to be — have any process upon us. Don't mean to be made into any product! Don't mean — Don't mean to end up being bought by some clients of the University, be they the government, be they industry, be they organized labor, be they anyone! We're human beings! ... &amp;nbsp;There's a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious — makes you so sick at heart — that you can't take part. You can't even passively take part. And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you've got to make it stop. And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it, that unless you're free, the machine will be prevented from working at all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mariosaviosproulhallsitin.htm American Rhetoric - Mario Savio].  See also Robert Cohen, '' Freedom's Orator,'' pp. 178-179.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At midnight, Alameda County deputy district attorney [[Edwin Meese|Edwin Meese III]] telephoned Governor [[Pat Brown|Edmund Brown Sr.]], asking for authority to proceed with a [[mass arrest]]. Shortly after 2 a.m. on December 4, 1964, police cordoned off the building, and at 3:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. began the arrest. Close to 800 students were arrested,&lt;ref name="uic.edu"/&gt; most of which were transported by bus to [[Santa Rita Jail]] in [[Dublin, California|Dublin]], about 25 miles away. They were released on their own recognizance after a few hours behind bars. About a month later, the university brought charges against the students who organized the [[sit-in]], resulting in an even larger student protest that all but shut down the university.

===Aftermath===
After much disturbance, the University officials slowly backed down.  By January 3, 1965, the new acting chancellor, [[Martin Meyerson]] (who had replaced the previous resigned [[Edward Strong]]), established provisional rules for political activity on the Berkeley campus. He designated the Sproul Hall steps an open discussion area during certain hours of the day and permitting tables. This applied to the entire student political spectrum, not just the liberal elements that drove the Free Speech Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt9h4nb3hd/ |title=Time, Place and Manner Statement |publisher=Content.cdlib.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most outsiders, however, identified the Free Speech Movement as a movement of the Left.  Students and others opposed to U.S. foreign policy did indeed increase their visibility on campus following the FSM's initial victory.  In the spring of 1965, the FSM was followed by the [[Vietnam Day Committee]],&lt;ref name="uic.edu"/&gt; a major starting point for the [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam war]] movement.

===Achievements===
For the first time, disobedience tactics of the Civil Rights Movement were brought by the Free Speech Movement to a college campus in the 1960s. Those approaches gave the students exceptional leverage to make demands of the university administrators, and build the foundation for future protests, such as the against the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fsm.berkeley.edu/free-speech-movement-timeline/|title=Visual History: Free Speech Movement, 1964 {{!}} Berkeley FSM|website=fsm.berkeley.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1966–1970==

The Free Speech Movement had long-lasting effects at the Berkeley campus and was a pivotal moment for the civil liberties movement in the 1960s.  It was seen as the beginning of the famous student activism that existed on the campus in the 1960s, and continues to a lesser degree today.  There was a substantial voter backlash against the individuals involved in the Free Speech Movement.  [[Ronald Reagan]] won an unexpected victory in the fall of 1966 and was elected [[Governor of California|Governor]].&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2004/06/08_reagan.shtml |title=Ronald Reagan launched political career using the Berkeley campus as a political target |publisher=Berkeley.edu |date=2004-06-08 |accessdate=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then directed the [[Regents of the University of California|UC Board of Regents]] to dismiss UC President [[Clark Kerr]] because of the perception that he had been too soft on the protesters. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] kept secret files on Kerr and Savio, and subjected their lives and careers to interference under [[COINTELPRO]].

Reagan had gained political traction by campaigning on a platform to "clean up the mess in Berkeley".&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"/&gt; In the minds of those involved in the backlash, a wide variety of protests, concerned citizens, and [[activist]]s were lumped together.  Furthermore, [[television news]] and [[documentary film]]making had made it possible to photograph and broadcast moving images of protest activity.  Much of this media is available today as part of the permanent collection of the Bancroft Library at Berkeley, including iconic photographs of the protest activity by student Ron Enfield (then chief photographer for the Berkeley campus newspaper, the ''[[The Daily Californian|Daily Cal]]'').&lt;ref name="bancroft.berkeley.edu"&gt;{{cite web|author=Elizabeth Stephens |url=http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/FSM/fsm_ead.html |title=Free Speech Movement Archival Collection Guides |publisher=Bancroft.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reproduction of what may be considered the most recognizable and iconic photograph of the movement, a shot of suit-clad students carrying the Free Speech banner through the University's [[Sather Gate]] in Fall of 1964, now stands at the entrance to the college's [[Moffitt Library#Free Speech Movement Cafe|Free Speech Movement Cafe]].&lt;ref name="bancroft.berkeley.edu"/&gt;

Earlier protests against the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]] meeting in [[San Francisco]] in 1960 had included an iconic scene as protesters were literally washed down the steps inside the Rotunda of [[San Francisco City Hall]] with fire hoses.  The anti-Communist film ''Operation Abolition''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeiW63M3bcI "Operation Abolition," 1960 - YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,894425-1,00.html Operation Abolition]", ''Time'' magazine, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsCfYYi2FE Operation Abolition (1960) - YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://matiane.wordpress.com/2010/08/19/operation-abolition/ Operation Abolition]", video.google.com and ''Time'' magazine, Friday, Mar. 17, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; depicted this scene and became an organizing tool for the protesters.

==Reunions==
The 20th anniversary reunion of the FSM was held during the first week of October, 1984, to considerable media attention.  A rally in Sproul Plaza featured FSM veterans Mario Savio, who ended a long self-imposed silence, Jack Weinberg, and Jackie Goldberg.  The week continued with a series of panels open to the public on the movement and its impact.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Ludlow, "Savio Breaks 20-year silence about Free Speech Movement," ''San Francisco Examiner'', September 30, 1984, p. A10; Stacy E. Palmer, "Berkeley, Birthplace of 1960's Unrest, Tries to Preserve Its Activist Image," ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', September 26, 1984, pp. 12-14; and Lynn Ludlow, "The Free Speech revolutionaries, 20 years later,"  the first of six parts, ''San Francisco Examiner'', December 9, 1984, pp. A1, A14-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 30th anniversary reunion, held during the first weekend of December 1994, was also a public event, with another Sproul Plaza rally featuring Savio, Weinberg, Goldberg, panels on the FSM, and current free speech issues.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Herscher, "Echoes of Free Speech Movement Heard 30 Years Later," ''San Francisco Chronicle'', December 2, 1994, pp. A19, A23.&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2001, UC's [[Bancroft Library]] held a symposium celebrating the opening of the Free Speech Movement Digital Archive.  Although not a formal FSM reunion, many FSM leaders were on the panels and other participants were in the audience.&lt;ref&gt;"Taking Part: FSM and the Legacy of Social Protest," brochure published by the Bancroft Library for the April 13–14, 2001 symposium.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 40th anniversary reunion, the first after Savio's death in 1996, was held in October 2004. It featured columnist [[Molly Ivins]] giving the annual Mario Savio Memorial Lecture, followed later in the week by the customary rally in Sproul Plaza and panels on civil liberties issues.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Burress, "UC's change of heart - celebrating transformation of a pariah into an icon," ''San Francisco Chronicle'', October 6, 2004, p. B1, B5; Charles Burress, "Celebrating 4 decades of mouthing off," ''San Francisco Chronicle'', October 8, 2004, p. B5; Charles Burress, "Free speech returns to Sproul," ''San Francisco Chronicle'', October 9, 2004, p. B1,B5; Meredith May, "40 years on Free Speechers talk all they want," ''San Francisco Chronicle'', October 11, 2004, p. B5.&lt;/ref&gt;  A Sunday meeting was a more private event, primarily a gathering for the veterans of the movement, in remembrance of Savio and of a close FSM ally, professor Reginald Zelnik, who had died in an accident in May.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Saxon, "Reginald Zelnik, 68, Historian of Labor Movements in Russia," ''The New York Times'', June 1, 2004, p. C13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==
[[File:Free Speech Monument Sproul Plaza Berkeley California.jpg|thumb|Free Speech Monument Sproul Plaza Berkeley California]]

Today, Sproul Hall and the surrounding [[Sproul Plaza]] are active locations for protests and marches, as well as the ordinary daily tables with free literature from anyone of any political orientation who wishes to appear. A wide variety of groups of all political, religious and social persuasions set up tables at Sproul Plaza. The Sproul steps, now officially known as the "Mario Savio Steps", may be reserved by anyone for a speech or rally.&lt;ref name="uic.edu"/&gt;  An on-campus restaurant commemorating the event, the Mario Savio Free Speech Movement Cafe, resides in a portion of the [[Moffitt Library|Moffitt Undergraduate Library]].

The Free Speech Monument, commemorating the movement, was created in 1991 by artist Mark Brest van Kempen.  It is located, appropriately, in Sproul Plaza.  The monument consists of a six-inch hole in the ground filled with soil and a granite ring surrounding it.  The granite ring bears the inscription, "This soil and the air space extending above it shall not be a part of any nation and shall not be subject to any entity's jurisdiction."  The monument makes no explicit reference to the movement, but it evokes notions of free speech and its implications through its rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;[http://greenmuseum.org/content/work_index/work_id-99__artist_id-51.html Free Speech Monument, Mark Brest Van Kempen]&lt;/ref&gt;

In human populations, the generation time typically ranges from 22 to 33 years.&lt;ref name="OECD2015" /&gt; [[Historian]]s sometimes use this to date events, by converting generations into years to obtain rough estimates of time.

== Definitions and corresponding formulas ==

The existing definitions of the generation time fall into two categories: those that treat the generation time as a renewal time of the population, and those that focus on the distance between individuals of one generation and the next. Below are the three most commonly used definitions:&lt;ref name="Coale1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Charlesworth1994" /&gt;

=== The time it takes for the population to grow by a factor of its net reproductive rate ===

The [[net reproduction rate|net reproductive rate]] ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of offspring an individual is expected to produce during its lifetime (a net reproductive rate of 1 means that the population is at its demographic equilibrium). This definition envisions the generation time as a renewal time of the population. It justifies the very simple definition used in [[microbiology]] ("the time it takes for the population to double", or [[doubling time]]) since one can consider that during the exponential phase of bacterial growth mortality is very low and as a result a [[bacterium]] is expected to be replaced by two bacteria in the next generation (the mother cell and the daughter cell). If the population dynamic is exponential with a growth rate ''r'' (i.e. ''n''(''t'') ~ α.e&lt;sup&gt;''rt''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''n''(''t'') is the size of the population at time ''t''), then this measure of the generation time is 
given by:
:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{\log R_0}{r}&lt;/math&gt;.
Indeed, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle T&lt;/math&gt; is such that ''n''(''t'' + ''T'') = ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ''n''(''t''), i.e. e&lt;sup&gt;''rT''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== The average difference in age between parent and offspring ===

This definition is a measure of the distance between generations rather than a renewal time of the population. Since many demographic models are female-based (that is, they only take females into account), this definition is often expressed as a mother-daughter distance (the "average age of mothers at birth of their daughters"). However, it is also possible to define a father-son distance (average age of fathers at the birth of their sons) or not to take sex into account at all in the definition. In age-structured population models, an expression is given by:&lt;ref name="Coale1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Charlesworth1994" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T = \int_0^{\infty} x e^{-rx} \ell(x) m(x) \, \mathrm{d}x&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''r'' is the growth rate of the population, ''ℓ''(''x'') is the survivorship function (probability that an individual survives to age ''x'') and ''m''(''x'') the maternity function (or birth function, or age-specific fertility). For [[matrix population models]], there is a general formula:&lt;ref name="BienvenuLegendre2015" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{ \lambda \mathbf{v w}}{\mathbf{v F w}} = \frac{1}{\sum e_{\lambda}(f_{ij})}&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''λ'' = e&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; is the discrete-time growth rate of the population, '''F''' = (''f&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'') is its fertility matrix, '''v''' its reproductive value (row-vector) and '''w''' its stable stage distribution (column-vector); the &lt;math&gt;\textstyle e_{\lambda}(f_{ij}) = \frac{f_{ij}}{\lambda} \frac{\partial \lambda}{\partial f_{ij}}&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Elasticity of a function|elasticities]] of ''λ'' to the fertilities.

=== The age at which members of a given cohort are expected to reproduce ===

This definition is very similar to the previous one but the population need not be at its stable age distribution. Moreover, it can be computed for different cohorts and thus provides more information about the generation time in the population. This measure is given by:&lt;ref name="Coale1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Charlesworth1994" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{\int_{x=0}^{\infty} x \ell(x) m(x) \, \mathrm{d}x}{\int_{x=0}^{\infty} \ell(x) m(x) \, \mathrm{d}x}&lt;/math&gt;.
Indeed, the numerator is the sum of the ages at which a member of the cohort reproduces, and the denominator is  ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the average number of offspring it produces.

'''The Hockerton Housing Project''' is a small community of five [[earth sheltering|earth sheltered]] homes on the outskirts of [[Hockerton]], Nottinghamshire, UK.

The houses were designed by ‘green’ [[architects]] [[Brenda and Robert Vale|Professor Brenda Vale and Dr Robert Vale]].&lt;ref&gt;Energy Saving Trust, The Hockerton Housing Project: a case study&lt;/ref&gt; Low carbon living is facilitated through the use of renewable energy, the water system, food grown on site, and the community's approach to work and transport.&lt;ref&gt;East Midlands Regional Assembly, "UK’s first earth-sheltered, self-sufficient ecological housing development", www.emra.gov.uk, last accessed 25 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The homes were completed in September 1998 after three years of planning and 18 months of construction, at a cost of about £65,000.&lt;ref&gt;Ecology Building Society, Hockerton housing: low impact living, http://www.ecology.co.uk/html/aboutus/casestudies/hockerton.htm, last accessed 25 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Two homes have since changed ownership on the open property market.

==Layout==
The development consists of a terrace of five single story dwellings which are earth-sheltered at the rear (North), so that the ground surface slopes and blends smoothly into the field at the back. The houses have [[passive solar]] heating (a combination of high [[thermal mass]] and the south-facing conservatory) removing the need for a space heating system and the greatest factor in lowering energy use.

Each house is 6 metres deep with a 19 metre conservatory to the south. This runs the full width of each dwelling. A repeated modular bay system of 3.2m in width was used for ease and cost of construction. Most of the internal rooms have 3 metre high French windows linking them to the conservatory. Those rooms that are not so dependent on natural light, such as utility and bathing areas are located towards the rear of the homes.

The surrounding 40,000 square metre site allows for crop cultivation, the rearing of sheep and chickens, and self-sufficiency in water and energy.&lt;ref&gt;EST,ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy generation and use==
Two [[wind turbines]] and a [[solar photovoltaic]] system provide most of the energy required to run the homes. All systems are grid linked, which allows for both import of energy during periods of supply shortfall, and export for periods of excess energy production. The excess exported offsets the imported energy from the grid.

•	6&amp;nbsp;kW proven [[wind turbine]] installed early 2002 year (upgraded in 2008) &lt;br /&gt;
•	7.65&amp;nbsp;kW peak array of [[photovoltaics]] (solar electric) installed August 2002 complimenting wind power.&lt;br /&gt;
•	5&amp;nbsp;kW Iskra [[wind turbine]] installed in 2005 – installed as part of construction of a community building

The typical energy use for the house is about 10kWhrs/day (all electric). This is about 10% of a typical UK home. The majority of the electricity use is generated by the on-site renewables which has reduced energy bills to about £100/annum. This is offset by income from [[Renewables Obligation]] certificates, and may in future benefit from [[feed-in tariff]]s.

==Water capture, use and processing&lt;ref&gt;NARYANAN, Narvi, WHITE, Trudi, KRAUSS, Terry, JONES-Lofting, Chris, "Water Supply and Irrigation Systems", Geographical, Mar2000, Vol. 72 Issue 3, p90, 2p&lt;/ref&gt;==
There are two water capture and treatment systems.

'''Non-drinking water:'''Rainfall on the fields is channeled to a sump from where it is pumped to a reservoir to the north of the buildings. This reservoir holds enough water for 250 days. The water is sand filtered and treated with chlorine before entering the homes.

'''Drinking or potable water:'''Drinking water is captured from the conservatory roofs in copper pipes, which are slightly antiseptic, and stored in a tank that holds at least 100 days worth of drinking water. The water is passed through 3 filters before it enters the homes: a five-micrometre string filter, a carbon filter and then a UV-light filter which kills bacteria and viruses.

'''Water use''' is reduced through low-flush toilets and flow-restrictors on shower heads. Detergent free laundry balls keep the water unpolluted.

'''Processing waste water:'''A [[reed bed]] sewage system is in place to process waste water. Solid waste is captured in a septic tank. This is emptied each quarter and waste is composted on-site. Liquid waste then takes 100 days to pass through the reed-bed, with the reeds roots breaking down the liquid effluent.

==Co-operation and community==
All residents own their homes but are also members of a co-operative.&lt;ref&gt;Ecology Building Society, ibid&lt;/ref&gt; Each home, as part of the lease, undertakes to spend 300 unpaid hours per year on managing and maintaining the site, from the infrastructure of the energy and water systems through to lambing and growing food; and 300 paid hours per year supporting the joint business which runs tours and educational events, hosts away-days and consulting on both new and retrofit energy efficient building.&lt;ref&gt;Hockerton Housing Project, FAQ, http://www.hockertonhousingproject.org.uk/SEFS/ID.780/SEFE/ViewItem.asp, last accessed 25 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cannes_beach_1980_6.jpg|thumb|Topless sunbathing in France. In certain cultures, public nudity (partial or total) is accepted in certain contexts]]
'''Indecent exposure''' is the deliberate exposure in public or in view of the general public by a person of a portion or portions of their body, in circumstances where the exposure is contrary to local moral or other standards of appropriate behavior. The term ''indecent exposure'' is a legal expression. Social and community attitudes to the exposing of various body parts and laws covering what is referred to as indecent exposure vary significantly in different countries. It ranges from outright prohibition to prohibition of exposure of certain body parts, such as the [[genital area]], [[buttock]]s or [[breast]]s.

Decency is generally judged by the standards of the local community, which are seldom codified in specifics in law. Such standards may be based on religion, morality or tradition, or justified on the basis of "necessary to [[public order]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary |edition=Tenth |publisher=Merriam-Webster |year=2001 |chapter=Indecent exposure |page=589 |isbn=0-87779-713-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-sexual [[exhibitionism]] or [[public nudity]] is sometimes considered indecent exposure. If [[Human sexual activity|sexual act]]s are performed, with or without an element of nudity, this can be considered [[gross indecency]], which is usually a more serious criminal offence. In some countries, exposure of the body in breach of community standards of [[modesty]] is also considered to be public indecency.

The legal and community standards of what states of undress constitute indecent exposure vary considerably and depend on the context in which the exposure takes place. These standards have also varied over time, making the definition of indecent exposure itself a complex topic.

== Overview ==
It is generally accepted, at least in [[western countries]], that a naked human body is not in itself indecent. That principle is reflected, for example, in [[depictions of nudity|depiction of the human form]] in art of various forms. Nevertheless, as a general rule, it is also commonly expected that people when they appear in a public place will be appropriately attired. Inappropriateness is viewed in context, so that, for example, what may be appropriate on a beach may be inappropriate in a street, school or workplace. Depending on the context, some degree of inappropriateness may be tolerated, and perhaps described as [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]], but in extreme cases of inappropriateness it may be regarded as "crossing the line". Besides the social disapproval of such a state of dress, most jurisdictions have laws to "maintain social order", variously described as [[public nudity]], indecent exposure, as an affront to [[public morality]], public nuisance, besides others. What is an inappropriate state of dress in a particular context depends on the standards of [[decency]] of the community where an exposure takes place. These standards vary from time to time and can vary from the very strict standards of [[modesty]] in places such as Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, which require most of the body to be covered, to tribal societies such as the [[Pirahã people|Pirahã]] or [[Mursi people|Mursi]] where full nakedness is the norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/1416/legality-of-nudism-in-public-places/1524#1524|title=Legality of Nudism in Public Places?|website=politics.stackexchange.com|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is generally no implication that the state of dress objected to is of a sexual nature; and if such an allegation were to be made, the act would generally be described as "[[gross indecency]]".

The standards of decency have varied over time. During the [[Victorian era]], for example, exposure of a woman's legs and some extent the arms,  was considered indecent in much of the [[Western world]].  Hair was sometimes required to be covered in formal occasions as in a form a hat or bonnet. As late as the 1930s and to some extent, the 1950s,  both women and men were expected to bathe or swim in public places wearing [[bathing suit]]s that covered above the waist. An adult woman exposing her [[navel]] was also considered indecent in the West into the 1960s and 1970s, and even as late as the 1980s.  Moral values changed drastically during the 1990s and 2000s, which in turn changed the criteria for indecent exposure.  Public exposure of the navel has been accepted during the 1990s, such as in beaches,  while in the 2000s, the buttocks can be exposed while wearing a thong.  Today, however, it is quite common for women to go topless at public beaches throughout Europe and South America and even some parts of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3834365/map-topless-laws/|title=Here's Where It's Legal for Women to Go Topless in the U.S.|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the phenomenon widely known as [[exhibitionism|flashing]], involving a woman exposing bare nipples by suddenly pulling up her shirt and [[bra]], may be free from sexual motive or intent, it nonetheless is public exposure and is therefore defined by statute in many states of the United States as prohibited criminal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/topics/state_statutes2.html#criminal_code |title=Criminal Code |author= |date= |work=Topical Index: State Statutes 2 |publisher=Cornell University Law School |accessdate=2010-09-14}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The motivation of the exposure is sometimes based on it being unusual, attention-getting, [[sexual arousal|sexually arousing]], or separately, as in a public policy protest, inappropriate and to show disrespect to the enemy side. The effects (including negative consequences) may be enhanced by intended or unintended publication of a photograph or film of the act, which would also include [[mooning]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

[[Breastfeeding in public]] does not constitute indecent exposure under the laws of the United States, Canada, Australia, or Scotland.&lt;ref name="Scotlandact"&gt;{{cite web| authorlink = Queen's Printer for Scotland | title = Breastfeeding etc. (Scotland) Act 2005. | url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/acts2005/20050001.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [[Government of the United States|federal government]] and all 50 states&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/life/allthemoms/2018/07/25/public-breastfeeding-now-legal-all-50-states/835372002/|title=Finally!

Legislation ranges from simply exempting breastfeeding from laws regarding indecent exposure, to outright full protection of the right to nurse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/01/map-where-its-legal-to-breastfeed-in-public_n_5637301.html|title=These Are All The States Where It's Legal To Breastfeed In Public|last=Samakow|first=Jessica|date=2014-08-01|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public clothing==

Public clothing varies by country and may be regulated by law. What parts of the body must be covered varies by region. Although genitals are usually expected to be covered in public in almost all societies, when it comes to other parts of the body such as female breasts, midriff, legs or shoulders, norms vary. For example, in some African cultures, it is the thighs, not the breasts, which must be covered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3031969.stm|title=MPs defend Swazi bare breasts|author=Tom Holloway |date=15 May 2003|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some societies, the head hair, especially female, must be covered, usually with a scarf. The vast majority of cultures accept that the face can and must be seen, but some cultures (especially in the [[Middle East]]), require that it be covered under a [[burqa]]. In conservative societies, appearing in a public place in clothing that is deemed 'indecent' is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6919581.stm|title=Nigerian skimpy dressers arrested|author=|date=27 July 2007|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-44628887|title=Inquiry into Saudi TV presenter's clothing|author=|date=27 June 2018|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6596933.stm|title=Crackdown in Iran over dress codes|author=Frances Harrison |date=27 April 2007|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries there are exceptions to the general rules (social or legal) regarding clothing. For instance, a country which generally prohibits full nudity may allow it in designated places, such as [[nude beaches]], or during various social events such as festivals or nude protests.

==Europe==
Attitudes towards nudity vary by country and are generally most relaxed in [[Scandinavia]], 
where genitals and breasts are not normally considered indecent or obscene. Hence, laws and societal views on public nudity are generally relaxed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Welfare States: Scandinavian Politics and Policy in the Global Age |page=309 |first=Eric S. |last=Einhorn |first2=John |last2=Logue |year=2003 |location=Oxford |publisher=Harcourt |isbn=0-275-95044-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Finland, it is very typical for patrons to bathe nude in the intense heat of [[sauna]]s. 

In the [[Netherlands]], public nudity is allowed at sites that have been assigned by the local authorities and "other suitable places."&lt;ref&gt;[http://213.10.84.49/Home/Content/The_Law.html Nudity and the law&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012081745/http://213.10.84.49/Home/Content/The_Law.html |date=12 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On nudist beaches, in unisex saunas and in swimming pool changing rooms, remaining partially clothed is frowned upon and the social norm is to undress. 

In [[Barcelona]], public nudity was a recognised right. However, on 30 April 2011, the Barcelona City Council voted a by-law forbidding walking "naked or nearly naked in public spaces" and limiting the wearing of bathing costumes to pools, beaches, adjacent streets and sea-side walks.&lt;ref&gt;[[APNEL]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other countries, such as the UK, Ireland or Poland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/classified-odd/11/08/08/model-fined-sunbathing-topless-ombudsman-appeal-mulled|title=Model fined for sunbathing topless; Ombudsman appeal mulled|agency=AFP|date=8 November 2008|website=ABS-CBN News}}&lt;/ref&gt; are more conservative. 

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom during the 19th and 20th centuries, indecent exposure was prosecuted under either section 28 of the [[Town Police Clauses Act 1847]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1847/89/pdfs/ukpga_18470089_en.pdf|title=Town Police Clauses Act 1847 (as enacted)|last=|first=|date=|website=Legislation.Gov.Uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or section 4 of the [[Vagrancy Act 1824]]. The latter was a piece of legislation that made it an offence to sleep rough or beg and contained a provision for the prosecution of:
:every person wilfully openly, lewdly, and obscenely exposing his person in any street, road, or public highway, or in the view thereof, or in any place of public resort, with intent to insult any female...
This provision was repealed by section 66 of the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]] which replaced the offence of "indecent exposure" and other sexual offences with legislation that is more specific and explicit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Public Indecency in England 1857-1960: 'A Serious and Growing Evil’|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K1HeCQAAQBAJ|first1=David J.|last1=Cox|first2=Kim|last2=Stevenson|first3=Candida|last3=Harris|first4=Judith|last4=Rowbotham|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9781317573838|volume=Volume 6|series=SOLON Explorations in Crime and Criminal Justice Histories|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current laws apply only to genital exposure with intent to shock those who do not want to see them. The maximum penalty is two years' imprisonment, but this is extremely rare as most cases are dealt with by a fine or through community service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/ukpga_20030042_en_5#pt1-pb18-l1g66 |title=Sexual Offences Act 2003 |author=Legislation.gov.uk |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=2010-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=The National Archives|title=Equality Act 2010|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; People convicted of exposure contrary to section 66 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 must sign the [[Violent and Sex Offender Register]] if they are sentenced to a term of imprisonment or a [[community order]] in excess of 12 months, or if the person they exposed themselves to was aged under 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex Offenders Register|url=http://ukcriminallawblog.com/sex-offenders-register/|work=UK Criminal Law Blog|author=Dan Bunting|date=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public nudity in England and Wales can also be punished as "disorderly behaviour" under the [[Public Order Act 1986]], sections 4A and 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2013/10/31/freedom-of-expression-nakedness-in-a-public-place/|title=Freedom of expression – nakedness in a public place  - UK Human Rights Blog|work=UK Human Rights Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scotland and Northern Ireland the situation is more complex, as some sections of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 extend to these places and some do not. Under [[Scots law]], indecent exposure is considered to be a form of public indecency and is regarded as a [[crimes of indecency|crime of indecency]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Scots law has been known to respond differently from English and Welsh law in cases of indecent exposure. [[Stephen Gough]], a man known as the "Naked Rambler" who hikes across Britain wearing only shoes, has been arrested in both jurisdictions with different consequences in each. The [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] has considered the introduction of new legislation.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

{{Main article|Indecent exposure in the United States}}
The laws governing indecent exposure in the United States vary according to location. In most states [[public nudity]] is illegal. However, in some states it is only illegal if it is accompanied by an intent to shock, arouse or offend other persons.  Some states permit local governments to set local standards. Most states exempt [[breastfeeding]] mothers from prosecution.

==Canada==
In Canada, s.173 of the ''Criminal Code''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efc.ca/pages/law/cc/cc.part-v.html |title=Criminal Code of Canada, 1985, Part V, Sexual Offences |publisher=Efc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; prohibits "indecent acts".&lt;ref&gt;Part 173(1)(a) of the Criminal Code provides, in part - Indecent acts - 173. (1) Every one who wilfully does an indecent act (a) in a public place in the presence of one or more persons...is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no statutory definition in the Code of what constitutes an indecent act, other than the exposure of the genitals and/or female nipples for a sexual purpose to anyone under 16 years of age.  Thus, the decision of what states of undress are "indecent", and thereby unlawful, is left to judges. Judges have held, for example, that [[nude sunbathing]] is not indecent.&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Beaupré'', 1971, British Columbia Supreme Court. Held: "the phrase 'indecent act' connotes something more active, with greater moral turpitude than the mere state of being nude in a public place."&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[streaking]] is similarly not regarded as indecent.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Springer'', 1975, Saskatchewan District Court&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''R v Niman'', 1974, Ontario Provincial Court&lt;/ref&gt; Section 174 prohibits nudity if it offends "against public decency or order" and in view of the public.  The courts have found that nude swimming is not offensive under this definition.&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Benolkin'', 1977, Saskatchewan Court of the Queen's Bench. It was found that "It cannot be an offence to swim in the nude at a lonely place in Canada in summer. That is part of the pleasure of summer in Canada, particularly to young males. If somebody comes along unexpectedly or if the swimmer misjudged the loneliness of the place the act cannot suddenly become criminal.".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Toplessness]] is also not an indecent act under s.173. In 1991, Gwen Jacob was arrested for walking in a street in [[Guelph, Ontario]] while topless. She was acquitted in 1996 by the Ontario Court of Appeal on the basis that the act of being topless is not in itself a sexual act or indecent.&lt;ref name="QueenvsJacob"&gt;{{Cite journal| url = http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1996/1996canlii1119/1996canlii1119.html | title = Judgment C12668, R. vs. Jacob | date = 1996-12-09 | publisher = Province of Ontario Court of Appeal | accessdate = 2009-02-16| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case has been referred to in subsequent cases for the proposition that the mere act of public nudity is not sexual or indecent or an offense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canlii.org/eliisa/highlight.do?language=en&amp;searchTitle=1996+CanLII+1119+%28ON+CA%29&amp;origin=%2Fen%2Fon%2Fonca%2Fdoc%2F1996%2F1996canlii1119%2F1996canlii1119.html&amp;path=/en/bc/bcsc/doc/2000/2000bcsc902/2000bcsc902.html District of Maple Ridge v.

==Australia==
[[File:Banner protesting vehicle emissions at the World Naked Bike Ride, Auckland, New Zealand - 20050217.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Protesters gathered outside a courthouse to protest against the arrest of [[Simon Oosterman]] (second from left), Auckland's 13 Feb 2005 WNBR organizer.]]
In Australia, it is a [[Summary judgment|summary]] or [[criminal]] offence in some [[States and territories of Australia|States and Territories]] to expose one's genitals (also referred to as - 'his or her person')&lt;ref name="ReginaVEyles"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|452|1997|litigants=R v Eyles |date=1 October 1997 |courtname=[[NSW Court of Criminal Appeal|Court of Criminal Appeal]] (NSW, Australia)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in a public place or in view of a public place. In some jurisdictions exposure of the genitals alone does not constitute an offence unless accompanied by an indecent act, indecent behaviour, grossly indecent behaviour, [[obscenity]], intention to cause offence or deliberate intention. The applicable law is different in each jurisdiction and in several jurisdictions the offence of indecent exposure does not apply.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Penalties vary between jurisdictions and are summarised below. Specific state [[Act of Parliament|Acts]], are as follows:
*Australian Capital Territory – ''Crimes Act'' 1900, section 393 – 'indecent exposure' – penalty 12 months. Under the ''Nudity Act'' 1976, the responsible minister may declare a public area where public nudity is permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|ACT|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|393}} Indecent exposure.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|ACT|act|na1976108|Nudity Act 1976}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*New South Wales – ''Summary Offences Act'' 1988, section 5 – 'wilful and obscene exposure' – penalty six months.&lt;ref name="SOA1988"&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|soa1988189|Summary Offences Act 1988|5}} Obscene exposure.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Northern Territory – ''Summary Offences Act'', section 50 – 'indecent exposure' – penalty 6 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NT|act|soa189|Summary Offences Act|50}} Penalty for indecent exposure of the person.&lt;/ref&gt;
*South Australia – ''Summary Offences Act'' 1953, section 23 – 'Indecent behaviour and gross indecency' – penalty three months and six months respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|SA|act|soa1953189|Summary Offences Act 1953|23}} Indecent behaviour and gross indecency .&lt;/ref&gt;
*Queensland – ''Summary Offences Act'' 2005 No. 4, section 9 – 'wilful exposure' – penalty 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Qld|act|soa2005189|Summary Offences Act 2005|9}} Wilful exposure.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Tasmania – ''Police Offences Act'' 1935, section 21 – 'Prohibited behaviour' – penalty 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Tas|act|poa1935140|Police Offences Act 1935|21}} Prohibited behaviour.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Police Offences Act'' 1935, section 14 – 'Public decency' – one penalty unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Tas|act|poa1935140|Police Offences Act 1935|14}} Public decency.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Western Australia – ''Criminal Code'', section 203 – 'Indecent acts in public' – criminal penalty two years. Summary conviction penalty: 9 months and fine of $9,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|WA|act|ccaca1913252/notes.html#appendixb|Criminal Code}} section 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definition of ''person''===
The laws of New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory use the term "person", while in the other States the exposure refers to the [[genitalia|genital area]]. It has been noted that a term such as "exposing one's person" relates back to the United Kingdom [[Vagrancy Act 1824|''Vagrancy Act'' 1824]] and ''Evans v Ewels'' (1972)&lt;ref&gt;''Evans v Ewels'' [1972] 1 [[Weekly Law Reports|WLR]] 671.&lt;/ref&gt; where it was said that the word "person" was a [[euphemism|genteel synonym]] for "penis" or "vulva". However, it has been held that the word "person" in s5 of the (NSW) ''Summary Offences Act'' is not limited to "penis" or "vulva". For example, in ''R v Eyles'' (1997) the offender was seen masturbating in his front garden and charged with obscene exposure under the NSW Act.&lt;ref name="ReginaVEyles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SOA1988" /&gt;

:In the case of both males and females, the parts of the body which are capable of being employed for the purpose of obscene exposure are limited. The concepts of obscenity and exposure in a practical sense restrict the potential operation of the provision. There is a question as to whether there is any further restriction to be found in the word "person". The [[Crown Advocate]] has submitted that there may be circumstances in which the exposure of the breasts of a woman is capable of being regarded as obscene, and that it is not difficult to imagine circumstances in which the exposure of a person's buttocks could be obscene.&lt;ref name="ReginaVEyles" /&gt;

However &amp;ndash;

:It is unnecessary and inappropriate to decide in the present case whether her submissions in that regard are correct. The jurisdiction which this Court is exercising is a jurisdiction confined to determining questions of law which arise in the case before the District Court. No question arises in the present case as to whether there are any circumstances in which the exposure by a female of breasts, or by a female or male of buttocks, could involve a contravention of s5. The prosecution case against the appellant was that he obscenely exposed his penis and other genitals. It is sufficient for resolution of the present case to say that this was capable of constituting exposure of "his person" for the purposes of the proceedings against him.&lt;ref name="ReginaVEyles" /&gt;

The [[Indian Penal Code]] (IPC) is often used to charge [[sex worker]]s with vague crimes such as "public indecency" or being a "public nuisance" without explicitly defining what these consist of.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Women in Saudi Arabia are legally required to wear robes and a headscarf when in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Saudi woman arrested for wearing a skirt is released without charge|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/20/saudi-woman-arrested-for-wearing-a-skirt-is-released-without-charge|newspaper=The Guardian|date=20 July 2017|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''invincible ignorance fallacy'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081002080428/http://www.cuyamaca.edu/brucethompson/Fallacies/invincible_ignorance.asp "Invincible Ignorance" by Bruce Thompson, Department of Humanities (Philosophy), Cuyamaca College]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[deductive fallacy]] of [[circular reasoning|circularity]] where the person in question simply refuses to believe the argument, ignoring any evidence given. It is not so much a fallacious tactic in argument as it is a refusal to argue in the proper sense of the word, the method instead being to either make assertions with no consideration of objections or to simply dismiss objections by calling them excuses, conjecture, etc. or saying that they are proof of nothing; all without actually demonstrating how the objection fit these terms (see [[Argumentum ad lapidem|ad lapidem fallacy]]).

==History==
The term "invincible ignorance" has its roots in [[Catholic theology]], where — as the opposite of the term [[vincible ignorance]] — it is used to refer to the state of persons (such as pagans and infants) who are ignorant of the [[Christianity|Christian]] message because they have not yet had an opportunity to hear it. The first Pope to use the term officially seems to have been [[Pope Pius IX]] in the [[allocution]] ''Singulari Quadam'' (9 December 1854) and the [[encyclical]]s ''Singulari Quidem'' (17 March 1856) and ''Quanto Conficiamur Moerore'' (10 August 1863). The term, however, is far older than that. [[Aquinas]], for instance, uses it in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' (written 1265–1274),&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas, [http://www.op.org/summa/a4/summa-I-IIq76a2.pdf ''Summa Theologica'' Ia IIae q.76 a.2]&lt;/ref&gt; and discussion of the concept can be found as far back as [[Origen]] (3rd century). When and how the term was taken by logicians to refer to the very different state of persons who deliberately refuse to attend to evidence remains unclear, but one of its first uses was in the book ''Fallacy: The Counterfeit of Argument '' by W. Ward Fearnside and William B. Holther&lt;ref&gt;Fearnside, W. Ward and William B. Holther, ''Fallacy: The Counterfeit of Argument'', 1959. {{ISBN|978-0-13-301770-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1959.

When the case went before the Supreme Court, Jordan argued that the poll tax laws had successfully barred black people not only from voting, but from holding office.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ideastations.org/radio/news/patriotism-perseverance-and-end-poll-tax|title=Patriotism, Perseverance and the End of the Poll Tax|last=Komp|first=Catherine|date=2016-03-17|work=Community Idea Stations|access-date=2018-02-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan said, "Almost like a magic wand after the passage of this law, these poll tax laws, not a single Negro has sat in the Virginia General Assembly, and not a single Negro has held a single elected state office in the state of Virginia."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The decision was made by the Supreme Court in two months and they decided that the poll tax or voting fee did violate the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 1968, Jordan was elected to the Norfolk City Council and became the first black person to hold the seat since 1889.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17452005/the_progressindex/|title=400 Marchers Hit Norfolk|last=|first=|date=1968-05-17|work=The Progress-Index|access-date=2018-02-14|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=6|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, Jordan was the only black member of the city council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17426032/the_corpus_christi_callertimes/|title=Busing Blamed for Flight of Whites from Norfolk|last=|first=|date=1971-12-10|work=The Corpus Christi Caller-Times|access-date=2018-02-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=2|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, he became the vice-mayor of Norfolk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RcrzCQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=%22joseph%20a%20jordan%22&amp;pg=PA83#v=onepage&amp;q=%22joseph%20a%20jordan%22&amp;f=false|title=On This Day in Norfolk, Virginia History|last=Downing|first=Sarah|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|year=2015|isbn=9781626197039|location=|pages=83|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, Jordan resigned as vice-mayor in protest, "saying the city is being run by the Norfolk Redevelopment Authority rather than City Council."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17452088/the_news_leader/|title=Norfolk Vice Mayor Resigns|last=|first=|date=1974-11-06|work=The News Leader|access-date=2018-02-14|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=15|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Korean units of measurement''', called '''''cheokgwan-beop''''' ({{Korean|hangul=척관법|hanja=尺貫法|labels=no}}) or '''''cheokgeun-beop''''' ({{Korean|hangul=척근법|hanja=尺斤法|labels=no}}) in Korean, is the [[Customary units|traditional]] system of measurement used by the people of the [[Korean peninsula]]. It is largely based on the [[Chinese units of measurement|Chinese system]], with influence from [[Japanese units of measurement|Japanese standards]] imposed following [[Japanese occupation of Korea|its annexation]] of the [[Korean Empire]] in 1910. Both [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]] currently employ the [[metric system]]. Since 2007, South Korea has criminalized the use of Korean units in commercial contexts but informal use continues, especially of the ''[[pyeong]]'' as a measure of residential and commercial floorspace. North Korea continues to use the traditional units, although their standards are now derived from metric conversions.

==History==
===Ancient Korea===
Customary Korean units are a local adaption of the [[Chinese units of measurement|traditional Chinese system]], which was adopted at a very early date.{{sfnp|Ledyard|1994|p=285}} They were imposed and adjusted at various times by royal statutes.{{sfnp|Kim|2010}} The details of the system have varied over time and location in Korea's history.{{sfnp|Fessley|2009|p=1}}{{sfnp|Gwon|2010}} Standardization—to the extent it occurred—was accomplished by officially sanctioned rulers, ropes, [[odometer]]s, [[trigonometry|triangulation]] devices,{{sfnp|Ledyard|1994|p=284}} weights, cups, and basins.

Although most of the measures operate on a [[decimal]] system, the standard form was to read out the units of each place (as, e.g., 3{{nbsp}}''cheok'', 1{{nbsp}}''chon'', 4{{nbsp}}''bun'', 1{{nbsp}}''ri'') rather than list them as a single number of the largest unit (as 3.141{{nbsp}}''cheok'').{{sfnp|Ledyard|1994|p=285}}

===Joseon Kingdom===
[[Taejo of Joseon|Yi Dan]] established a Market Bureau ({{lang|ko|{{linktext|시사}}}}, {{lang|ko|{{linktext|市司}}}}) or Bureau of Weights and Measures ({{lang|ko|{{linktext|평시서}}}}, {{lang|ko|{{linktext|平市署}}}}) at the foundation of the [[Joseon dynasty]] in 1392.{{sfnp|NIKH|2017}} The [[Joseon Kingdom]] later attempted a standardization of length based on square brass rulers, which were used by [[yangban|magistrates]] and the [[Secret royal inspector|secret police]] to fight commercial fraud.{{sfnp|Kim|2015}} Under the [[Joseon]], different classes of society were permitted different numbers of ''[[kan (unit)|kan]]'' in their homes, but in its traditional sense—like the Japanese ''[[ken (unit)|ken]]''—of a [[bay (architecture)|bay]] between two [[pillar (architecture)|pillar]]s rather than as a set unit of length.{{sfnp|Kim|2015}}

The 1496 Great Codex of State Administration (''Kyŏngguk Taejŏn'') included a section on approved measures and their verification.{{sfnp|Ledyard|1994|p=285}} It employed a [[li (unit)|li]] of 360{{nbsp}}paces or 2160{{nbsp}}feet, but did not explicitly mention that conversion until its 1746 supplement.{{sfnp|Ledyard|1994|p=285}}

The 1897 Law on Weights and Measures uniting Korea's various local systems was the first legislation enacted upon the Joseon's establishment of the [[Korean Empire]].{{sfnp|Jo|2006}} 

{{anchor|Japanese occupation|Japanese Chosen|Chōsen|Chosen}}
===Japanese Chōsen===
During [[Japanese occupation of Korea|its long occupation]], Japan imposed [[Japanese units|its standards]] on Korea. Two of the most common "traditional" units in South Korea—the ''pyeong'' of [[floorspace]] and the jeweler's ''don''—were among those given their modern value by the Japanese.{{sfnp|Hong|2007}}

===South Korea===
[[South Korea]] signed the [[Meter Treaty]] in 1959&lt;ref name=lordylordy/&gt; and notionally [[metrification|adopted the metric system]] under [[Park Chung-hee]] on 10 May 1961,{{sfnp|DBI|1985|p=837}}{{sfnp|HMC|23 June 2007}} with a strict law banning the use of the Korean pound, li, ''gwan'', and ''don''&lt;ref name=applerok/&gt; effective as of 1 January 1964{{sfnp|DBI|1985|p=837}} and—after metric conversion of the [[land registry|land registries]]—the ''pyeong''.{{sfnp|Jo|2006}} The metrication was not applied to imported or exported goods{{sfnp|DBI|1985|p=837}} and remained so generally spotty as to be considered a failure,{{sfnp|Hong|2007}} with the government abandoning its attempts to enforce the statute by 1970.{{sfnp|Jo|2006}} The traditional units feature in many [[Korean language|Korean]] sayings{{efn|See, e.g., the proverbs on the importance of flattery and lying in [[Jeyseon Lee|Lee]].{{sfnp|Lee|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=H4CsWDEi52IC&amp;pg=PA82 82]}}}} and much of its literature and poetry, including the [[Aegukga|national anthem]], which mentions Korea's "three thousand lis of rivers and mountains".{{sfnp|Hong|2007}} Further attempts to fully metricate occurred in 1983,&lt;ref name=spy/&gt;&lt;ref name=applerok/&gt; 2000,{{sfnp|Jo|2006}} and 2001,{{sfnp|Hong|2007}} with publicity campaigns praising the [[metric system]] and condemning traditional units through TV and radio ads, brochures, signs, and contests.{{sfnp|Fessley|2009|p=4}} A common theme was the origin of the present values of the units under [[Japanese occupation of Korea|Japanese occupation]]; Yun Byeong-su of the [[Korea Association of Standards &amp; Testing Organizations]] noted that "even Japan has forsaken the ''don'' for the units of grams and ounces but here we are standing around like idiots still blathering on about ''don''."{{sfnp|Jo|2006}} Nonetheless, strong opposition from the construction and jewelry industries and negative media coverage forced Korean politicians to avoid the topic and regulators to settle for dual use of conventional and metric measures.{{sfnp|Jo|2006}}

A 2006 study found 88% of real estate companies and 71% of jewelers in 7 major markets were still using the ''pyeong'' and ''don'',{{sfnp|Hong|2007}} after which the [[South Korean government|government]] decided to simply criminalize further commercial use of traditional units. (Another important factor was the [[European Union]] regulation mandating the use of metric in all imported goods by 2010.){{sfnp|HMC|22 July 2007}} The sale of [[ruler (tool)|ruler]]s marking Korean feet was ended{{sfnp|Jo|2006}} and a Measure Act effective 1 July 2007 empowered the [[Korean Agency for Technology and Standards]]&lt;ref name=applerok/&gt; of the [[South Korean Ministry of Commerce|Ministry of Commerce]] to begin immediately levying fines of up to [[₩]]500,000 for commercial use of the ''pyeong'' and ''don'', with less common units enjoying a longer [[grace period]].{{sfnp|Hong|2007}} The ban also included use of [[American units]], such as describing the [[display size]] of televisions and [[computer monitor]]s in terms of inches.&lt;ref name=aak/&gt;{{efn|A particular exception to this policy was made for the continued use of [[Pound (mass)|pound]]s for [[bowling ball]] sizes and yards on [[golf course]]s, owing to the international conventions of those sports.{{sfnp|Jo|2006}}}} The "serving size" used as an informal and variable measure of meat cuts was standardized to 100{{nbsp}}g.{{sfnp|Jo|2006}} Knowledge of the fine remained low for years, and it was later increased to a maximum of [[₩]]1,000,000 (about [[USD|$]]800) for users of illegal units{{sfnp|Fessley|2009|p=4}} and [[₩]]3,000,000 for sellers of measuring devices marked with unapproved units.&lt;ref name=applerok&gt;{{harvp|APLMF|2015|loc="[http://www.aplmf.org/republic-of-korea.html Republic of Korea]"}}.&lt;/ref&gt; South Korea's measurement standards are now maintained by the [[Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science]].&lt;ref name=applerok/&gt;

Despite this strong official discouragement, some use continues in retail, manufacturing, and farming.{{sfnp|Fessley|2009|p=4}} Even among those who adopt metric units, cheeky use of awkward metric fractions equivalent to round amounts of the former units is common, especially with regard to the very common ''pyeong'' of [[floorspace]].&lt;ref name=aak/&gt;{{sfnp|Jo|2006}} (Such treatment was avoided in the gold market by laws requiring pricing and denomination in even amounts of grams.){{sfnp|Jo|2006}} Another dodge has been to treat the traditional units as a nondescript 'unit', such as marketing an air conditioner appropriate for a 20{{nbsp}}py home as a "20-Type".&lt;ref name=aak&gt;{{citation |title=Ask a Korean! |contribution=Pyeong, and Old Habits Dying Hard |contribution-url=http://askakorean.blogspot.com/2012/07/pyeong-and-old-habits-dying-hard.html |date=21 July 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Korea===
Despite the importance of the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Division of Korea|establishing North Korea]], [[Kim Il-sung]] continued official use of Korean units until the DPRK's notional [[metrication]] under National Standard 4077-75 in 14 April 1975.&lt;ref name=applenork&gt;{{harvp|APLMF|2015|loc="[http://www.aplmf.org/dpr-korea.html DPR Korea]"}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|This standard was subsequently superseded by National Standard 4077-91 in 1991,&lt;ref name=applenork/&gt; but that standard continued the use of the metric system as well.}} It joined the [[Meter Treaty]] in 1982&lt;ref name=lordylordy&gt;{{harvp|Lord|2001|loc="[https://sizes.com/units/General/met_sys_spred.htm Spread of the Metric System]"}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or 1989,{{sfnp|BIPM|2007|p=194}} although it was removed from the [[International Bureau for Weights and Measures]] and related organizations in 2012 for its years of failure to pay the necessary fees.{{sfnp|BIPM|2014|p=5}} North Korea has long used the metric system in its state-run media and international publications,{{sfnp|YNA|2013}} but continues to use traditional units alongside the metric system{{sfnp|TEG|2017}} in sectors approved by the government.{{sfnp|DPRK|1993|loc=Ch. II, §§13–15}} North Korea's standards are administered by the [[Central Institute of Metrology]]&lt;ref name=applenork/&gt; under the [[State Administration of Quality Management]] in accordance with the Law on Metrology{{sfnp|DPRK|1993}} ratified by the [[Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea|Supreme People's Assembly]] on 3 February 1993.{{sfnp|CooMet|2013}} North Korea uses the ''pyeong'' in various regulations, such as the 50{{nbsp}}py per person allowed for private farming in 1987,{{sfnp|Park &amp; al.|2014|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mW2EBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33 33]}} despite guides who disparage the unit as a historical relic of the South to foreign tourists visiting the country.{{sfnp|Burdick|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=g3TJ_-Tw3q0C&amp;pg=PA150 150]}} The metric system is thought not to have spread to domestic factories or stores prior to [[Kim Jong-un]]'s metrification initiative, announced in May 2013.{{sfnp|YNA|2013}} The change was part of Kim's policy of stressing the importance of science and technology and its "universal trends".{{sfnp|YNA|2013}} His announcement in the state-run quarterly ''Cultural Language Study'' said that increasing use of the metric system would "strengthen international exchange and cooperation... in the fields of industry, science, and technology and even in the area of general social life".{{sfnp|YNA|2013}}

==Length==
The base unit of Korean length is the foot,{{sfnp|Kim|2007}} with other units changing over time based on its dimensions and multiples. Different ancient Korean kingdoms had different exact measurements;{{sfnp|Kim|2015}} that of [[Sejong the Great]] ({{abbr|r|ruled}}.{{nbsp}}1418–1450) was 31.22{{nbsp}}cm.{{sfnp|Kim|2007}} Under the early [[Joseon Kingdom]], the value of the foot varied by trade, with different lengths used for the carpentry foot and the fabric foot.{{sfnp|Kim|2015}}

The biggest difference between the traditional Korean and Chinese units of length is that the Korean equivalent of the ''[[bu (unit)|bu]]'' uses a different character and its pre-[[Tang dynasty|Tang]] composition of six Korean feet rather than five. (The ''bu'' was usually treated as a synonym of this unit within Korea but sometimes distinguished as a length of 4{{nbsp}}feet.) In {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}369, during the reign of [[Geunchogo of Baekje|King Geunchogo]] of [[Baekje]], his realm seems to have used a foot of about 28.85{{nbsp}}cm.{{sfnp|Gwon|2010}}

The Korean li previously bore values around 434.16{{nbsp}}m (3rd century), 531.18{{nbsp}}m (6th–7th), 559.8{{nbsp}}m (7th–10th), 552.96{{nbsp}}m (10th–14th),&lt;ref name=sly/&gt; and 450{{nbsp}}m (19th);&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;{{citation|title=Oxford English Dictionary|url=http://www.oed.com/|ref={{harvid|OED}}|contribution=ri, ''n.''|contribution-url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/165428|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press}}.&lt;/ref&gt; it was also reckoned based on travel time and therefore varied in length between the plains and mountains.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; It was standardized as {{sfrac|10}}{{nbsp}}of the [[Japanese ri]] of {{nowrap|3{{sfrac|51|55}} km}} in 1905.&lt;ref name=sly&gt;{{harvp|Lord|2006|loc=[https://sizes.com/units/li.htm#Korea "Li"]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Both the 1955&lt;ref name="un" /&gt; and 1966 editions of the UN's report on national measurement systems report the Korean li as precisely equal to the Japanese ri, but this seems to be in error.&lt;ref name=sly/&gt;}}

==Area==
The base unit of Korean area is the ''pyeong'',{{sfnp|Kim|2007}} equivalent to a square ''kan'' or 36 square Korean feet. It comprised about 3.158{{nbsp}}m² during [[Korea's Three Kingdoms Era]];{{sfnp|Kim|2015}} the present value derives from the units established by the Japanese.{{sfnp|Kim|2015}} Despite being notionally illegal, the ''pyeong'' remains particularly common when discussing residential and commercial [[floorspace]]{{sfnp|Fessley|2009|p=5}}{{sfnp|Zatko|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2fU5TgWBTecC&amp;pg=PA204 204]}}&lt;ref name=aak/&gt; and tiles.&lt;ref name=spy/&gt; A separate ''pyeong'' of 0.09{{nbsp}}m² was used for selling glass.{{sfnp|Jo|2006}} The floorspace ''pyeong'' is still prevalent enough that it continues to be glossed in the government's promotional material for foreign investors.{{sfnp|KOTRA|2010}}

Farms and large estates were formerly generally measured in ''majigi'', which is notionally not based on multiples of the ''pyeong'' but on the amount of land suitable for the planting of one ''mall'' of rice or grain seed.&lt;ref name="yu2"&gt;{{harvp|Yu &amp; al.|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=CcqBYxSpvb8C&amp;pg=PA178 178]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, it was standardized to the ''pyeong'' system but varied in size from province to province based on the average richness of their soil.

==Weight==
The base unit of Korean weight is the ''gwan''.{{sfnp|Kim|2007}} At the time of Korea's metrification, however, the pound was in more common use. Although it was usually taken as equivalent to 600{{nbsp}}g,{{sfnp|HMC|22 July 2007}} as with [[Crushed red pepper|red pepper]] and meats,{{sfnp|Jo|2006}}{{sfnp|Kim|2015}} a separate pound of 400{{nbsp}}g was used for fruits{{sfnp|Jo|2006}}{{sfnp|Kim|2015}} and another of 375{{sfnp|Kim|2007}} or 200{{nbsp}}g was used for vegetables.{{sfnp|Jo|2006}} The ''nyang'' also sees some use among Korea's vendors of [[traditional Chinese medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=B. |first=Paul |title=An Acorn in the Dog's Food |contribution=Measurements |contribution-url=http://samedi.livejournal.com/369252.html |url=http://samedi.livejournal.com/ |publisher=LiveJournal |date=21 February 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "bag" (''kama'') was a variable unit usually figured as 54{{nbsp}}kg of [[rice husk|unhusked]] rice or 60{{nbsp}}kg of [[rice polishing|polished]] rice, although 90{{nbsp}}kg "bags" were also used.&lt;ref name=sorry/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7061">'''Llewelyn Powys''' (13 August 1884 – 2 December 1939) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] essayist, [[novelist]] and younger brother of [[John Cowper Powys]] and [[Theodore Francis Powys|T. F. Powys]].

==Life==

Powys was born in [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]], the son of the Reverend Charles Francis Powys (1843&amp;ndash;1923), who was vicar of [[Montacute]], Somerset for thirty-two years, and Mary Cowper Johnson, a descendant of the poet [[William Cowper]]. He came from a family of eleven children, many of whom were also talented. Two brothers [[John Cowper Powys]] and [[Theodore Francis Powys]] were also well-known writers, while his sister [[Philippa Powys|Philippa]] published a novel and some poetry. Another sister Marian Powys was an authority on lace and lace-making and published a book on this subject. His brother A. R. Powys was Secretary of the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]], and published a number of books on architectural subjects.

He was educated at [[Sherborne School]] 1899-1903 and [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]] 1903-1906. While lecturing in the [[United States]] he contracted [[tuberculosis]]. After his return in 1909, he travelled again, living for a while in [[Switzerland]]. His time spent in [[Africa]], farming with his brother William near [[Gilgil]] in [[British East Africa]] (now in [[Kenya]]) from 1914 to 1919.
 
In 1920 he went again to America to work as a [[journalist]].  While living in [[New York City]] he met and married, in 1924, the novelist [[Alyse Gregory]] (1884-1967), editor of the journal ''[[The Dial]]''. In 1925 the couple moved to Dorset: firstly to the Coastguard Cottages on White Nothe and then to nearby farmhouse Chydyok, where his two sisters, the poet and novelist, Philippa Powys, and the artist, Gertrude Powys, occupied the adjacent cottage. This was close to  village of [[East Chaldon]] where his brother, the author [[Theodore Powys]], lived from 1904 until 1940. Various other writers and artists lived in the village at different times, such as [[Sylvia Townsend Warner]] and [[David Garnett]], the poets [[Valentine Ackland]] and [[Gamel Woolsey]], and the sculptors Elizabeth Muntz and Stephen Tomlin.

[[Gamel Woolsey]] met [[John Cowper Powys]] when she lived in [[Patchin Place]], [[Greenwich Village]], and, through him, his brother Llewelyn and his wife, [[Alyse Gregory]]. She and Alyse became friends for life, while with Llewelyn she had a passionate and painful love affair.&lt;ref name="bert"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Kenneth Hopkins |title= Bertrand Russell and Gamel Woolsey |pages= 50–58 |date= Summer 1985 |work= Russell: the Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies |publisher= [[McMaster University]] |url= http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1488&amp;context=russelljournal }}&lt;/ref&gt; She left New York for England in 1929, settling in [[Dorset]] to be near Llewelyn, where she came to know the whole Powys family and their circle. Parting from Llewelyn in 1930, she married the [[historian]] and writer [[Gerald Brenan]] in a private ceremony, and they lived together, mainly in Spain, until her death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theolivepress.es/spain-news/2007/10/15/the-queen-of-spains-literary-past/ The Queen of Spain's Literary Past] The Olive Press, October 15, 2007. Retrieved February 11, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Powys traveled with his wife, paying visits to [[Mandatory Palestine]] (1928), the West Indies (1930) and Switzerland (1937). He died in Clavadel, Switzerland from complications related to an ulcer.&lt;ref name="Elwin1953"&gt;{{cite book|author=Malcolm Elwin|title=The Life of Llewelyn Powys|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=25MIAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=18 July 2013|year=1953|publisher=Macdonald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His writings include a novel, ''Apples Be Ripe'' (1930), and a biography of [[Henry Hudson]] (1927). He was very friendly with Hamilton Rivers Pollock, Barrister, owner from 1928, of [[Urchfont Manor]].

==Rationalism==

Powys identified as a rationalist and wrote articles critical of religion in [[freethought]] journals such as the ''[[Rationalist Association|Rationalist Annual]]'' and ''[[New Humanist|The Literary Guide]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Foss, Peter John. (1991). ''A Study of Llewelyn Powys: His Literary Achievement and Personal Philosophy''. Edwin Mellen Press. p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

He was an [[atheism|atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34054057 "A Point of View: Does atheism have to be anti-religious?"]. BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=November 2015}}
A {{nihongo|'''local hero'''|ローカルヒーロー|rōkaru hīrō|also written as {{nihongo3||ご当地ヒーロー|gotōchi hīrō}}}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[superhero]] who is created to represent a particular region of Japan, such as a [[Prefectures of Japan|prefecture]] or city. They often perform in special [[martial arts]] [[stage show]]s. Created either by local groups or the [[local government]], a local hero is modeled after the superheroes of Japanese [[tokusatsu]]. A local hero is often themed around the city or prefecture's local mythologies or industries, are created to teach the children who watch the stage shows certain things (like {{nihongo|Recycle Sentai Wakerunger|リサイクル戦隊ワケルンジャー|Risaikuru Sentai Wakerunjā}} of [[Fukui, Fukui|Fukui]], [[Fukui Prefecture]]), or are themed after the event that they are used to promote (the {{nihongo|Traffic Sentai Anzenger|トラフィック戦隊アンゼンジャー|Torafikku Sentai Anzenjā}} group performed at the [[Tokyo Motor Show]] to act in both the latter forms for [[road traffic safety]]).

Although local heroes are produced to act in a local area, some gain fame throughout Japan by performing at other local heroes' shows or being featured in mainstream media. {{nihongo|[[Chōjin Neiger]]|超神ネイガー|Chōjin Neigā|extra=translated as "Super-God Neiger" or "Neiger The Hero"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage1.nifty.com/nexus/neiger/|title=超神ネイガー|accessdate=2007-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Nikaho, Akita|Nikaho]], [[Akita Prefecture]], has had two theme songs recorded by [[anison]] recording artist [[Ichirou Mizuki]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neiger.la.coocan.jp/kirokuhtmls/kiroku1a.htm|title=活動記録 平成19年10月|date=October 2007|accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the first of which was previously available on the Japanese [[iTunes Store]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yaplog.jp/allenkk/archive/796|title=豪石！超神ネイガー-ALLEN's BLOG|date=2007-08-14|accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and a subsequent EP featuring [[Mitsuko Horie]]'s vocals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage1.nifty.com/nexus/neiger/products/music_radio.htm|title=【関連商品】■音楽／ラジオ|accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.jp.msn.com/news/2776.htm|title=秋田のヒーロー"超神ネイガー"、ミニアルバム発売　MSNミュージック 音楽ニュース|date=2007-06-07| accessdate=2010-01-12| archivedate=2008-06-16| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616205623/http://music.jp.msn.com/news/2776.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{nihongo|[[Ryujin Mabuyer]]|琉神マブヤー|Ryūjin Mabuyā}} from [[Okinawa Prefecture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mabuyer.com/index.html|title=琉神マブヤー公式WEBサイト：ニライカナイからやってきた魂の戦士「琉神マブヤー」|accessdate=2010-01-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127112237/http://www.mabuyer.com/index.html|archivedate=2010-01-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was featured in his own [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] television series. {{nihongo|[[Maburittokiba]]|マブリットキバ}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maburittokiba.web.fc2.com/index.html|title=マブリットキバ：公式サイト　トップ|accessdate=2007-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Tōno, Iwate|Tōno]], [[Iwate Prefecture]], was featured in an episode of the [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] program ''Kizuna Dining'' when they visited Tōno and appears at hero shows throughout Japan. The [[Marimokkori]] of [[Hokkaidō]] has become a popular character throughout Japan, sold as [[mobile phone charms]], [[Claw vending machine|claw machine prizes]], among other [[merchandise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsservice.com/archives/jan55.htm|title=Anime News Service - January 18 - May 7 Anime News|date=2006-05-04|accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Independent film]] releases also use the "local hero" motif to present their characters. {{nihongo|[[Crusher Kazuyoshi]]|クラッシャーカズヨシ|Kurasshā Kazuyoshi}} is portrayed as a local hero for [[Tokyo]], and is portrayed by [[Kazuyoshi Sakai]] of ''[[Hyakujuu Sentai Gaoranger]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crusher.exblog.jp/|title=クラッシャーカズヨシ|accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anison artist [[Takayuki Miyauchi]] performs the second film's theme song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.tanuki.co.jp/?eid=889509|title= {{!}} 宮内タカユキ熱唱！「クラッシャーカズヨシ -怒る-」主題歌「炎」販売開始!! {{!}} 20世紀たぬき　おしらせ・ニュース {{!}}|accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{nihongo|''[[Zan Saber]]''|斬セイバー|Zan Seibā}} is a series of DVDs that feature the heroes (Zan Saber, Zan Dagger, Zan Axe) as local heroes of [[Osaka]], starring [[Ryunosuke Kawai]] of ''[[Tenimyu]]'' fame as the lead character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://west-power.co.jp/gaion/zan/whatsnew.html|title=斬セイバー|accessdate=2010-01-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107220225/http://west-power.co.jp/gaion/zan/whatsnew.html|archivedate=2006-11-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anime ''[[Tentai Senshi Sunred]]'' is based on the local hero theme, featuring the title character as the protector of the city of [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]] in [[Kanagawa Prefecture]].

Another TV tokusatsu series, [[Houjin Yatsurugi]] was shown as the local hero in Chiba.

In 2008, [[Symantec]] created the character of {{nihongo|[[Norton Fighter]]|[[:ja:ノートンファイター|ノートンファイター]]|Nōton Faitā}} for its Japanese advertising campaign alongside celebrity otaku [[Shoko Nakagawa]] for their new software, including several other characters to go with him. [[Hironobu Kageyama]] has recorded a song for Norton Fighter as well titled {{nihongo|"Bōei Senshi! Norton Fighter"|防衛戦士！ノートン・ファイター|Bōei Senshi! Nōton Faitā}}. As a local hero, Norton Fighter is based in the [[Akihabara]] region of [[Tokyo]].

{{more footnotes|date=April 2016}}

In [[mathematics]], a '''structure''' on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] is an additional [[mathematical object]] that, in some manner, attaches (or relates) to that set to endow it with some additional meaning or significance.

A partial list of possible structures are [[Measure theory|measures]], [[algebraic structure]]s ([[group (mathematics)|group]]s, [[field (mathematics)|field]]s, etc.), [[Topology|topologies]], [[Metric space|metric structures]] ([[Geometry|geometries]]), [[Order theory|orders]], [[Event structure|events]], [[equivalence relation]]s, [[differential structure]]s, and [[Category (category theory)|categories]].

Sometimes, a set is endowed with more than one structure simultaneously; this enables mathematicians to study it more richly. For example, an ordering imposes a rigid form, shape, or topology on the set. As another example, if a set has both a topology and is a group, and these two structures are related in a certain way, the set becomes a [[topological group]].

[[Map (mathematics)|Mappings]] between sets which preserve structures (so that structures in the source or [[Domain of a function|domain]] are mapped to equivalent structures in the destination or [[codomain]]) are of special interest in many fields of mathematics. Examples are [[homomorphism]]s, which preserve algebraic structures; [[homeomorphism]]s, which preserve topological structures; and [[diffeomorphism]]s, which preserve differential structures.

==History==
In 1939, the French group with the pseudonym [[Nicolas Bourbaki]] saw structures as the root of mathematics. They first mentioned them in their "Fascicule" of ''Theory of Sets'' and expanded it into Chapter IV of the 1957 edition.&lt;ref name=Corry&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Corry|first1=Leo|title=Nicolas Bourbaki and the concept of mathematical structure|journal=Synthese|date=September 1992|volume=92|issue=3|pages=315&amp;ndash;348|jstor=20117057|doi=10.1007/bf00414286}}&lt;/ref&gt; They identified three ''mother structures'': algebraic, topological, and order.&lt;ref name=Corry/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wells&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wells|first1=Richard B.|title=Biological signal processing and computational neuroscience|date=2010|pages=296&amp;ndash;335|url=http://www.mrc.uidaho.edu/~rwells/techdocs/Biological%20Signal%20Processing/Chapter%2010%20Mathematical%20Structures.pdf|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example: the real numbers==
The set of [[real number]]s has several standard structures:
*an order: each number is either less or more than any other number.
*algebraic structure: there are operations of multiplication and addition that make it into a [[Field (mathematics)|field]].
*a measure: intervals along the real line have a specific [[length]], which can be extended to the [[Lebesgue measure]] on many of its subsets.
*a metric: there is a notion of [[Metric (mathematics)|distance]] between points.
*a geometry: it is equipped with a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] and is [[Flatness (mathematics)|flat]].
*a topology: there is a notion of open sets.
There are interfaces among these:
*Its order and, independently, its metric structure induce its topology.
*Its order and algebraic structure make it into an [[ordered field]].
*Its algebraic structure and topology make it into a [[Lie group]], a type of [[topological group]].

He is the host of ''[[The Savage Nation]]'', a [[Broadcast syndication#Radio syndication|nationally syndicated]] talk show that aired on [[Talk Radio Network]] across the United States until 2012, and in 2009 was the second most listened-to radio talk show in the country with an audience of over 20&amp;nbsp;million listeners on 400 stations across the United States.&lt;ref name="Hinckley"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hinckley |first=David |title=Barack Obama critics, like Rush Limbaugh, top annual list of influential radio hosts |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2010/02/24/2010-02-24_righties_lead_talk_allstar_team.html |access-date=June 26, 2011 |newspaper=New York Daily News |date=February 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marinucci"&gt;{{cite news |last=Marinucci |first=Carla |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/nov05election/detail?entry_id=39618 |title=Politics Blog : SF radio host Michael Savage, banned from Britain: "Will they ban my listeners too?" |publisher=SFGate |date=May 5, 2009 |access-date=October 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since October 23, 2012, Michael Savage has been syndicated by [[Cumulus Media Networks]]. He holds [[master's degree]]s from the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa|University of Hawaii]] in medical [[botany]] and [[medical anthropology]], and a Ph.D. from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in [[nutrition]]al [[ethnomedicine]]. As Michael Weiner, he has written books on [[nutrition]], [[Herbalism|herbal medicine]], and [[homeopathy]]; as Michael Savage, he has written four political books that have reached ''[[The New York Times Best Seller list]]''.

Savage has summarized his political philosophy in three words: [[border]]s, language, and culture. Savage has characterized his views as conservative [[American nationalism|nationalism]], while critics have characterized them as "fostering [[extremism]]."&lt;ref name="least wanted"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8033060.stm | work=BBC News | title=UK 'least wanted' list published | date=May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He supports the [[English-only movement]] and argues that [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberalism]] and [[Progressivism in the United States|progressivism]] are degrading [[Culture of the United States|American culture]]. Although his radio delivery is mainly characterized as politically themed, he also often covers topics such as medicine, nutrition, music, literature, history, theology, philosophy, sports, business, economics, and culture, and tells personal anecdotes.

Since 2009, Savage has been [[List of people banned from entering the United Kingdom|barred from entering the United Kingdom]] for "seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred."{{refn|&lt;ref name="least wanted" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Savage forbidden from Britain: "Britain...published its first list of people barred from entering the country" [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/05/05/michael-savage-banned-fro_n_196631.html The Huffington Post]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanthinker.com/2009/05/michael_savage_banned_in_the_u.html Document quotes:] "Home Office name promoters of hate excluded from the United Kingdom," Savage "seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering [[hatred]] which might lead to inter-community violence."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC: "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8035114.stm%20 US 'hate list' DJ to sue Britain]" May 6, 2009,&lt;/ref&gt;}} &lt;!--  see [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (lead section)]] "Provide an accessible overview"  " It should define the topic, establish context, explain why the subject is interesting or notable, and summarize the most important points—including any prominent controversies.

==Early life and education==
Savage was born Michael Alan Weiner&lt;ref name="newyorker.com" /&gt; in [[the Bronx]], New York, one of three children of Benjamin and Rae Weiner,&lt;ref name="mother" /&gt; [[History of the Jews in Russia|Jewish]] emigrants from Russia.&lt;ref name="mother" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sfsavage"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ron |last=Russell |title=Inside the Savage Nation |url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2006-07-19/news/inside-the-savage-nation/full |work=[[SF Weekly]] |date=July 19, 2006 |access-date=September 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New Yorker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="man behind"&gt;{{cite news |first=Mark |last=de la Viña |title=The Man Behind the "Savage Nation": Neo-Conservative Host Once Embraced the Counterculture |url=http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/entertainment/television/6336570.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030801234541/http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/entertainment/television/6336570.htm |archivedate=August 1, 2003 |work=[[The Mercury News|San Jose Mercury News]] |date=July 20, 2003 |access-date=September 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He described his childhood as difficult.&lt;ref name="sfsavage" /&gt;  His little brother, Jerome, was born with developmental disabilities and was unable to hear or speak.  Jerome died in 1969.  His father, the owner of an antiques shop, died of a heart attack at age 57&lt;ref name="New Yorker" /&gt; in 1970,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael Savage|work=[[NNDB]]|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/588/000044456/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother died in 2003.&lt;ref name="mother"&gt;{{cite news|title=Paid Notice: Deaths Savage, Rae|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/16/classified/paid-notice-deaths-savage-rae.html|access-date=July 12, 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 16, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from [[Jamaica High School (New York City)|Jamaica High School]] in 1958,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Noteworthy alumni|url=http://www.jamaicahighschool.org/ALUM/notealum.htm|publisher=Jamaica High School (New York City)|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904080202/http://www.jamaicahighschool.org/ALUM/notealum.htm|archivedate=September 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Otterman|first=Sharon|title=Jamaica High May Close, but Memories Will Live On|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/24/nyregion/24jamaica.html|access-date=July 21, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Savage attended [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College]], where he earned a bachelor's degree in [[biology]] in 1963.&lt;ref name="New Yorker" /&gt; After college Savage taught high school for several years in New York City. His first marriage in 1964 to Carol Ely ended in divorce, and he remarried in 1967 after meeting his current wife, Janet. During this time Savage also worked for famous [[psychedelic drug]] advocate [[Timothy Leary]] as keeper of the stone gatehouse on the Hitchcock Cattle Company estate in [[Millbrook, New York]], to which Leary had been given access. Leary hired him to the post because Savage did not use [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]].&lt;ref name="sfsavage" /&gt; Savage then studied at the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]], earning a [[Master of Science]] in [[botany]] in 1970 and a [[Master of Arts]] in [[anthropology]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weiner|first=Michael Alan|title=Medicinal plants of Tonga|url=http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/36042/Weiner_1970_r.pdf|publisher=University of Hawaii at Manoa|year=1970|format=Thesis (M.A.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Graduate Degrees Awarded in Anthropology: MAs - 1970 to 1979|url=http://www.anthropology.hawaii.edu/people/alumni/mas1970-1979.html|publisher=University of Hawaii at Manoa|access-date=June 3, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150825092120/http://anthropology.hawaii.edu/people/alumni/mas1970-1979.html|archivedate=August 25, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in 1978 from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in [[nutrition]]al [[ethnomedicine]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name="UCBL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sunsite5.berkeley.edu:8000/WebZ/FETCH?sessionid=01-49886-1724585769&amp;recno=14&amp;resultset=2&amp;format=F&amp;next=html/record.html&amp;bad=error/badfetch.html&amp;:entitytoprecno=14:entitycurrecno=14 |title="UC Berkeley Pathfinder" |access-date=October 5, 2006 |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;&lt;ref name=mrangry&gt;{{cite news | title = Michael Savage: Mr Angry | author=Guy Adams | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/michael-savage-mr-angry-1681844.html | work=The Independent | publisher=Independent News &amp; Media PLC | location = London | date = May 9, 2009 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716195310/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/michael-savage-mr-angry-1681844.html|archivedate=July 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[thesis]] was titled ''Nutritional Ethnomedicine in [[Fiji]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weiner|first=Michael Alan|year=1978|title=Nutritional ethnomedicine in Fiji|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/3287378|work=Dissertation Abstracts International|volume=41|issue=12|page=4468|format=Thesis (Ph.D.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shift in political opinions==
Savage introduced himself to certain writers in the [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]] neighborhood of San Francisco in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2003/03/05/savage_11/singleton/ |title=Michael Savage's long, strange trip |access-date=November 10, 2011 |last=Gilson |first=David |date=March 5, 2003 |publisher=Salon.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121163922/http://www.salon.com/2003/03/05/savage_11/singleton/ |archivedate=November 21, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He befriended and traveled with [[Beat Generation|Beat]] poets [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]]. Savage maintained a correspondence with Ginsberg consisting of ten letters and three postcards across four years, which is maintained with Ginsberg's papers at [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref name="sfsavage" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GQ"&gt;{{cite news |last=Tapper |first=Jake |authorlink=Jake Tapper |date=September 2003 |title=The Savage Mind |work=[[GQ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; One letter asked for Ginsberg and Ferlinghetti to come do a poetry reading, so others could "hear and see and know why I adore your public image."&lt;ref name="man behind" /&gt; Another acquaintance was poet and author [[Neeli Cherkovski]], who says that Savage dreamed of becoming a [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comic]] in the mold of [[Lenny Bruce]].&lt;ref name="sfsavage" /&gt;

Acquaintance Robert Cathcart says that by 1980, in his private conversations with Savage, he knew him to have conservative political views.&lt;ref name="salon" /&gt; Schwartz stated Savage became alienated from the North Beach scene in the early 1980s. Savage had intense arguments with his liberal friends.&lt;ref name="salon" /&gt; When asked about his shift in politics and other views, Savage replied, "I was once a child; I am now a man."&lt;ref name="man behind" /&gt; Savage has cited many occurrences in his life that helped shape his conservative views. Savage states that his opinions on [[welfare]] were partly shaped by his first job out of college as a [[social work]]er.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Savage |first = Michael |title = The Savage Nation |publisher=[[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson]] |year= 2002 |page = 181 |isbn = 0-7852-6353-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He described one incident in which his supervisor had him deliver a check to a welfare client to furnish their apartment, while his own apartment was furnished with cardboard boxes.&lt;ref name="Playboy" /&gt; Another turning point occurred for him as a writer of health and nutrition books in the 1980s, when he experienced what he saw as "political opposition" after making the suggestion that the closure of homosexual bathhouses might be necessary in response to the emerging [[HIV/AIDS]] epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Savage |first = Michael A. |title = Maximum Immunity |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin]] |year= 1986 |page = 207 |isbn = 0-395-37910-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 his final health and nutrition manuscript, ''Immigrants and Epidemics'', was rejected by publishers for being inflammatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Hirsen |first = James L. |title = Savage Exposes 'The Enemy Within' |publisher=FirstLiberties.com |date = January 28, 2004|url = http://www.firstliberties.com/savage_exposes_enemy.html |access-date = September 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Savage applied to become the Dean of the [[UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism|Graduate School of Journalism]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. The University instead selected award-winning journalist and China scholar [[Orville Schell]]. Savage sued the University, contending discrimination for being conservative.&lt;ref name="salon" /&gt; Savage later dropped the lawsuit.&lt;ref name="Savage Talk" /&gt;

==Career as commentator==
{{Main|The Savage Nation}}

===Radio===
The rejection by publishers of his 1994 manuscript about [[illegal immigration]] and [[epidemic]]s prompted Savage to record a demo tape with a mock radio talk show about the contents of the work. He mailed this tape to 250 radio stations in an attempt to change careers and become a radio talk show host.&lt;ref name="salon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="barbs"&gt;{{Cite AV media |people = Michael Savage |title = The Best of the Savage Nation – Volume 2: Barbs on the Berries |medium = CD |publisher=Savage Productions |date= 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 21, 1994, Savage began his radio career on [[KGO (AM)|KGO]] (a San Francisco news/[[talk radio]] station) as a fill-in host for the liberal [[Ray Taliaferro]] and later as a weekend host. At the time, his slogan was "To the right of [[Rush Limbaugh|Rush]] and to the left of God." On January 1, 1995, he was given his own show during the drive-time hours on sister station KSFO. The show quickly became a local hit. During his time at KSFO, Savage reached #1 in [[Nielsen Audio|Arbitron]] ratings among both adult men and women over 18 during afternoon drive-time in San Francisco and became top talk host in his time-slot.

In mid 2006, Savage had 8–10&amp;nbsp;million listeners per week,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = The Top Talk Radio Audiences |publisher=Talkers Magazine  |date= September 2007 |url = http://www.talkers.com/main/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=17&amp;Itemid=34|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061114200439/http://www.talkers.com/main/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=17&amp;Itemid=34|archivedate = November 14, 2006|access-date = June 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which made his show the third most widely heard broadcast in the United States at that time. Savage has described his listeners as "literate callers with intelligence, wit, and energy." He has described his show's production as one with a "...&amp;nbsp;hard edge combined with humor and education&amp;nbsp;... Those who listen to me say they hear a bit of [[Plato]], [[Henry Miller]], [[Jack Kerouac]], [[Moses]], [[Jesus]], and [[Frankenstein]]."&lt;ref name="MSB" /&gt; Mark de la Viña of the ''[[The Mercury News|San Jose Mercury News]]'' wrote of Savage: "In contrast to Rush Limbaugh, [[Sean Hannity]] and [[Laura Schlessinger]], Bay Area-based Savage mixes conservative diatribe and blunt observations with acerbic humor and the gift of gab."&lt;ref name="man behind" /&gt;

By 2009, ''The Savage Nation'' had an audience of 8 to 10&amp;nbsp;million listeners on 400 stations across the United States, making it the second most listened-to radio talk show in the country at the time.&lt;ref name="Hinckley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marinucci" /&gt; Around that time, Savage asked his audience for their opinion prior to consenting to a profile interview by [[Kelefa Sanneh]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]''; Savage eventually accepted that offer and the ''New Yorker'' profile, titled "Party of One", was published in the August 3, 2009, issue, which covered Savage's life and personality in great detail.&lt;ref name="New Yorker"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sanneh |first=Kelefa |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/08/03/090803fa_fact_sanneh?currentPage=all |title=Party of One: Michael Savage, Unexpurgated |work=The New Yorker |date=August 3, 2009|pages=50–57|volume=85|issue=23|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

On September 10, 2009, [[KNEW (AM)|KNEW-AM]] (910&amp;nbsp;kHz) in Savage's home market of San Francisco announced that it was dropping his program and replacing him with [[John and Ken]] from sister station [[KFI]]-AM (640&amp;nbsp;kHz)/Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fong-Torres|first=Ben|title=Rothmann named as Ward's replacement|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/entertainment/article/Rothmann-named-as-Ward-s-replacement-3285100.php|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=October 4, 2009|pages=Q40}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Scott, program director of KNEW said in an e-mail that the station was headed "...&amp;nbsp;in a different philosophical and ideological direction, featuring more contemporary content and more local information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Michael Savage off the air in S.F.|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/article/Michael-Savage-off-the-air-in-S-F-3217723.php|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=September 11, 2009|pages=D4|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914115152/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2009%2F09%2F11%2FBAEC19LCOS.DTL|archivedate=September 14, 2009|deadurl=no|access-date=May 2, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Arbitron monthly ratings, [[KNEW (AM)|KNEW-AM]] dropped in the ratings since Savage was let go. San Francisco station [[KTRB]] picked up the program for the San Francisco market, and saw a ratings boost in the afternoon drive. However, the program was among the first casualties when KTRB went into receivership in September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/athletics/article/A-s-radio-flagship-goes-bust-3175177.php | work=San Francisco Chronicle | first=Susan | last=Slusser | title=A's radio flagship goes bust | date=September 12, 2010 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105095606/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2010%2F09%2F11%2FSPLP1FCB39.DTL | archivedate=November 5, 2010 | deadurl=no | page=B5 | access-date=May 2, 2018 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 22, 2010, Savage revealed to his audience that a writer for ''[[Playboy]]'' had contacted him via email to do a lengthy interview, and again asked his listeners if he should accept the offer. During the show, Savage read from personal emails between the ''Playboy'' writer and himself. The writer admitted to being a listener of the ''[[The Savage Nation|Savage Nation]]'' but a critic of the profile done by ''The New Yorker''. The writer also stated that the purpose of the interview was to "rattle" ''Playboy''{{'}}s readers. On May 12, 2010, Savage revealed that he had granted the interview at his home. ''Playboy'' published the interview in June 2010.&lt;ref name="Playboy"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hochman |first=David |title=Michael Savage: Playboy interview |url=http://www.playboy.com/articles/michael-savage-playboy-interview/ |work=Playboy |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511092038/http://www.playboy.com/articles/michael-savage-playboy-interview/ |archivedate=May 11, 2011 |date=June 2010 |deadurl=no }} .&lt;/ref&gt; He read from a pre-publication copy of the 8,000-word ''Playboy'' interview, in which the writer expressed animosity for Savage and his views. Savage said that he was disappointed at the lack of [[journalistic objectivity]], but did not harbor hatred for the writer. He referred back to the ''New Yorker'' interview by Kelefa Sanneh, and praised Sanneh as a "real writer" who had understood his subject.

On September 27, 2012, Savage's talk show left the airwaves after he won a legal battle with [[Talk Radio Network]], his longtime employer, and his attorney said discussions with new networks were under way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCartney|first=Anthony|title=Michael Savage leaves radio show after legal win|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_PEOPLE_MICHAEL_SAVAGE?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2012-09-27-22-07-27|publisher=Associated Press|access-date=September 28, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928071952/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_PEOPLE_MICHAEL_SAVAGE?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2012-09-27-22-07-27|archivedate=September 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Savage began an occasional series of video webcasts via [[Ustream]] on September 30, 2012. On October 17, 2012, Savage and his new syndicator [[Cumulus Media Networks]] announced that they had made a deal and the program, after several weeks off the air, would be returning as of October 23, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Marcucci, Carl.

===MSNBC television show===
Savage was hired by [[MSNBC]] president Erik Sorenson to do a one-hour show beginning March 8, 2003, despite Savage's previous criticism of the network in his book ''[[The Savage Nation (book)|The Savage Nation]]'' and the objections of [[NBC]] employees including news anchor [[Tom Brokaw]], who asked NBC executives, "Is this the sort of man who embodies the values of NBC?"&lt;ref name="GQ" /&gt; Sorenson, at the time, called Savage "brash, passionate and smart," and promised that he would provide "compelling opinion and analysis with an edge."&lt;ref name="FAIR" /&gt;

Four months later, on July 7, Savage was fired from his MSNBC television show after remarks made in response to a caller, later identified as [[prank call]]er Bob Foster, who insulted Savage's teeth. Savage then asked if Foster was a "[[sodomy|sodomite]]", to which the caller answered, "Yes, I am." Savage then said to the caller,

{{quote|Oh, so you're one of those sodomites. You should only get [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] and die, you pig; how's that? Why don't you see if you can sue me, you pig?

Now do we have another nice caller here who's busy because he didn't have a nice night in the bathhouse who's angry at me today?

The day after being fired, Savage apologized on his radio program and on his website. He explained that he believed that MSNBC had gone to commercial to cover the gaffe of the attempted sabotage by a prank caller and that he was off the air at the time of the offensive comments, despite the fact that clips of the segment show Savage going to commercial after he made the comments. He also said his remarks were meant only to insult the caller, not all people with AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fost |first=Dan |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/07/09/MN158024.DTL&amp;ao=all |title=Savage Says He's Sorry But Stays Fired |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=July 9, 2003 |access-date=September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
Michael Savage calls himself an "independent-minded individualist" and says that he "fits no stereotype."&lt;ref name="MSB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael Savage : The Compassionate Conservative |publisher=WOR |url=http://www.wor710.com/pages/10608313.php |access-date=November 11, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025112722/http://www.wor710.com/pages/10608313.php |archivedate=October 25, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also cited [[Barry Goldwater]] as an influence.&lt;ref name="Savaged NR"&gt;{{cite web|last=Klinghoffer|first=David|title=Savaged|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/219016/savaged/david-klinghoffer|work=National Review|access-date=July 10, 2011|date=October 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Savage criticizes [[big government]] as well as [[Liberalism in the United States|liberalism]] and liberal activism, and accuses the [[Mainstream media|mainstream news media]] of [[Media bias|liberal bias]].

=== European Union ===
Savage describes the [[European Union]] as "Hitler's dream of a united Europe under German control." He equates Britain's [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|vote to leave the Union]] with the Second World War, saying it was "in many ways the [[Battle of Britain]] all over again." Savage foresees that, after [[Brexit]], the E.U. risks igniting a civil war to gain total control of the population for their plans of "a new Soviet-style superstate, which have been long on the drawing books."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTcet3vbaiA|title=The Savage Nation – Episode 19|last=Savage|first=Michael|date=|website=YouTube|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
===Legal defense contributions===
Savage has regularly donated money toward the legal defense of the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] accused of [[Haditha massacre|murdering civilians]] in [[Haditha|Haditha, Iraq]]; occasionally, Savage will offer proceeds from any sales through his website.

===Criticism===
In July 2005, former CBS reporter [[Bernard Goldberg]] ranked Savage as number 61 in his book ''[[100 People Who Are Screwing Up America]]''. Goldberg wrote that "Savage's brand of over-the-top [[bile]]&amp;nbsp;... puts him right in there with the angriest haters of the [[Left-wing politics|Left]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Dhingra | first =Philip | title =''Who is in Bernard Goldberg's 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America?

On April 17, 2006, Savage was seriously criticized worldwide after he said on the topic of Muslims, "They say, 'Oh, there's a billion of them.'

In March 2006, Savage criticised [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] assistance to illegal immigrants (in response to statements by Cardinal [[Roger Mahony]] of Los Angeles calling it "pastoral support").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2006/4/3/162352.shtml |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120910220924/http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2006/4/3/162352.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 10, 2012 |title=Savage Remarks Anger Catholics |publisher=[[Newsmax Media]] |date=April 3, 2006 |access-date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Donohue]] of the [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]] canceled an appearance on the show, saying "what is not fine is Savage's diatribe about the 'greedy pigs' in the Catholic Church and how 'the institution is rotten from the top to the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.catholicleague.org/release.php?id=1107 |title=Michael Savage's Catholicism |access-date=July 9, 2011 |date=March 30, 2006 |author=[[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120234511/http://catholicleague.org/release.php?id=1107 |archivedate=November 20, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 28, 2006, Savage encouraged his listeners to burn [[Flag of Mexico|Mexican flags]] to counter pro-immigration rallies in [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Kim|last=Myung Oak|title=Foreign flags create flap Mexican banners at recent rallies prompt backlash|publisher=''Rocky Mountain News''|date=March 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====C-SPAN broadcast of Talkers Award====
When ''[[Talkers Magazine]]'' awarded Savage with the publication's annual "Freedom of Speech Award," [[C-SPAN]] opted not to broadcast a pre-recorded speech that had been sent by Savage.&lt;ref name="newsblaze.com" /&gt; Although the award ceremony had received coverage in previous years, C-SPAN did not televise it due to its policy of televising such speeches only when delivered in person. Savage told his listeners to express their ire to C-SPAN through calls and e-mails to the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2007/06/c-span-shares-lamb-skewers-on-air-004576?paginate=false|title=C-SPAN shares Lamb skewers on air|author=Mortman, Howard|work=Politico|date=June 21, 2007|access-date=August 13, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625212709/http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=4AFF492C-3048-5C12-0025D780C6B9F45C|archivedate=June 25, 2007|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dispute with CAIR====
In early November 2007, the [[Council on American–Islamic Relations]] (CAIR) called on radio listeners to contact companies that advertise on Savage's program to express their concerns about his comments concerning Muslims. Savage was quoted as saying Muslims "need [[deportation]]", and that adherents of Islam would do well to "take your religion and shove it up your behind" because "I'm sick of you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/17/arts/17sava.html|title=Boycotted Radio Host Remains Unbowed|first=Jacques|last=Steinberg|date=December 17, 2007|work=The New York Times|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221095258/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/17/arts/17sava.html?ei=5088&amp;en=0052db888e9244dc&amp;ex=1355547600&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all|archivedate=December 21, 2007|access-date=February 11, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his show and website, Savage answered by accusing CAIR of supporting [[Hamas]].

On November 5, 2007, following a campaign by CAIR meant to get Savage off the air by alerting his sponsors to the nature of his comments, [[Citrix Systems|Citrix Systems, Inc.]] pulled its advertisements from his show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McClellan|first=Steve|url=http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/citrix-pulls-spots-savage-nation-91037/ |title=Citrix Pulls Spots From ‘Savage Nation’|work=Adweek|date=November 13, 2007|accessdate=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Savage sued CAIR for [[copyright]] infringement for using excerpts from his show on CAIR's website.&lt;ref&gt;Judi McLeod, [http://www.canadafreepress.com/index.php/article/927 "One for Savage, zero for CAIR"],  canadafreepress.com, December 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The suit alleged that CAIR's repackaging of Savage's comments was "deliberately designed to obscure the specific message conveyed by Michael Savage". The excerpts included Savage's characterization of the [[Quran|Qur'an]] as "a throwback document" and a "book of hate". CAIR called the suit "bizarre, sloppy and baseless".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Curtis| first =Kim | title =Radio host Michael Savage sues Islamic organization over ads | publisher=[[The Press-Enterprise]]| date =December 3, 2007| url =http://www.pe.com/ap_news/California/CA_Radio_Host_Lawsuit_317999C.shtml| access-date =December 4, 2007}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 25, 2008, [[United States district court]] Judge [[Susan Illston]] dismissed Savage's suit against CAIR, holding that the posting of the audio clip was protected under [[fair use]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Egelko|first=Bob|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Suit-against-Savage-Nation-radio-host-tossed-3275816.php|title=Suit against 'Savage Nation' radio host tossed|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=July 26, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731003952/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2008%2F07%2F25%2FBA2111VQOI.DTL|archivedate=July 31, 2008|deadurl=no|accessdate=May 2, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court gave Savage the opportunity to file an amended complaint if he wanted to try to cure the defects in his suit. That amended complaint alleged that CAIR was a RICO conspirator in support of terror, including the 9/11 terror attack on the World Trade Center. Permission was granted to allow that filing but on August 14, 2008, however, Savage's lawyer, [[Daniel Horowitz]], announced that Savage would not file an amended complaint and would drop the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Egelko| first = Bob| title = Radio host drops lawsuit against Islamic group| newspaper = [[San Francisco Chronicle]]| pages = B–4| date = August 15, 2008| url = https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Radio-host-drops-lawsuit-against-Islamic-group-3273421.php| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080815135155/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2008%2F08%2F14%2FBAPR12BDPO.DTL| archivedate = August 15, 2008| deadurl = no| access-date = May 2, 2018| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; CAIR then sought attorneys fees against Savage, Judge Illston denied that request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rbr.com/michael-savage-beats-cair-again-in-court-ruling/|title=Michael Savage beats CAIR again in court ruling|work=Radio Business Report|date=January 28, 2009|volume=26|issue=18|accessdate=May 2, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604224117/http://rbr.com/radio/12543.html|archivedate=June 4, 2009|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Autism====
In July 2008, Savage said that the increasing rate of [[autism]] diagnoses was the result of "a racket" designed to get disability payments for "poorer families who have found a new way to be parasites on the government."&lt;ref name=NYDN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/radio-host-michael-savage-incites-protests-autism-comments-article-1.350990|title=Radio host Michael Savage incites protests with autism comments|last=Sandoval|first=Edgar|last2=Kennedy|first2=Helen|work=[[New York Daily News]]|date=July 21, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724233046/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2008/07/21/2008-07-21_radio_host_michael_savage_incites_protes.html|archivedate=July 24, 2008|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the subject on his July 16, 2008, show with the following remarks:

On that show Savage stated that his remarks had been "ripped out of context" by "far left [[Stalinism|Stalinists]]" who want him off of the air. He appeared on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' with [[Glenn Beck]] as the substitute host for [[Larry King]], and said that the real issue he was commenting on was the [[overdiagnosis]] of children due to [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical companies]]' drive to drug children for higher profits.&lt;ref name=NYDN /&gt; On July 25, 2008, Autism United advocates gathered to announce that several advertisers, including [[RadioShack]], [[Sears]], [[The Home Depot]], and [[DirectBuy]], will discontinue their support for Savage's show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Autism group: Advertisers dropping Savage |last=Rosen |first=Daniel |newspaper=Newsday |date=July 25, 2008 |access-date=July 25, 2008 |url=http://www.newsday.com/news/local/newyork/ny-nysava0726,0,3274609.story |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080728100819/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/newyork/ny-nysava0726%2C0%2C3274609.story |archivedate=July 28, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Savage's syndicator, [[Talk Radio Network]], has responded by releasing a lengthy statement, along with a selection of 20 audio clips drawn from Savage's discussions of autism, to show that the comments were taken out of context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080728072736/http://www.savageonautism.com/|archivedate=July 28, 2008|title=20 audio clips of Michael Savage's comments on Autism|publisher=Talk Radio Network|url=http://www.savageonautism.com|access-date=September 20, 2018|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Banned from entering the United Kingdom====
On May 5, 2009, it was announced by then-[[Home Secretary]] [[Jacqui Smith]] that Savage was on a [[list of people banned from entering the United Kingdom]] as he is "considered to be engaging in unacceptable behaviour by seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering [[hatred]] which might lead to inter-community violence".&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |title=UK 'least wanted' list published |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8033060.stm |publisher=BBC |date=May 5, 2009 |access-date=May 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCNews"&gt;{{cite news |title= 'Who is on UK least wanted list' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8033319.stm |publisher=BBC |date=May 5, 2009 |access-date=May 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/5282245/US-talkshow-host-to-sue-Jacqui-Smith-over-ban-from-Britain.html US talkshow host Michael Savage to sue Jacqui Smith over ban from Britain] Alex Spillius, telegraph.co.uk, May 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.homeoffice.gov.uk/press-releases/hate-promoters-banned-UK-named |title=Home Office name hate promoters excluded from the UK |date=May 5, 2009 |access-date=May 6, 2009 |publisher=UK Home Office |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507181855/http://press.homeoffice.gov.uk/press-releases/hate-promoters-banned-UK-named |archivedate=May 7, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his radio broadcast on that same day, Savage declared that he would sue Smith personally for [[defamation]], calling her a "lunatic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8035114.stm |title=US 'hate list' DJ to sue Britain |publisher=BBC News |work=|access-date=May 5, 2009 | date=May 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a subsequent [[NPR]] talk show, Savage said that he has never advocated violence and repeatedly invoked the [[United States Constitution]]'s [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. After host [[Neal Conan]] pointed out that the U.S. Constitution does not apply to the United Kingdom, Savage replied, "No. Thank God I'm an American. But for this lunatic&amp;nbsp;... to link me up with [[White power skinhead|Nazi skinheads]] who are killing people in [[Russia]]&amp;nbsp;... to put me in league with [[Hamas]] murderers who killed Jews on buses, is astonishing".&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite news |title=Michael Savage Banned in The UK |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=103819122 |work=[[NPR]] |date=May 5, 2009 |access-date=August 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Savage also called on his listeners to support him by canceling travel and business in Britain as well as by boycotting British-made goods, commenting, "If they want to play hardball, we'll play hardball."&lt;ref&gt;Kate Kelland

You're nobody and I'm not going to talk to you!" At that point, Neal Conan invited him to leave.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt;

Of the banning, the [[Mayor of London]], [[Boris Johnson]], wrote:
"America still has a constitutional protection of free speech, and I have been amazed&amp;nbsp;... to see how few people in this country are willing to stick up for that elementary principle&amp;nbsp;... a country once famous for free speech is now hysterically and expensively sensitive to anything that could be taken as a slight."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/borisjohnson/5304788/Michael-Savage-poses-no-risk-to-British-security-so-why-wont-MPs-say-so.html Michael Savage poses no risk to British security so why won't MPs say so?] Boris Johnson, The Daily Telegraph, May 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Catherine Bennett (journalist)|Catherine Bennett]] wrote: "The ban on Savage is so far from being a comprehensible act, so staggeringly capricious and stupid, as to defy evaluation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/may/10/michael-savage-radio-homeopathy-jacqui-smith Yes Jacqui, let's keep out those dangerous homeopaths] Catherine Bennett, ''The Guardian'', May 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; While Sam Leith wrote: "Barring this shock-jock from Britain risks turning a rabid blabbermouth into a beacon for free speech."&lt;ref name="Ref-4" /&gt;

====Veteran PTSD====
On October 14, 2014, Savage criticized veteran sufferers of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], accusing them of "weakness". According to Savage, "Everyone has depression in their life. But if the whole nation is told, 'boo-hoo-hoo, come and get a medication, come and get treatment, talk about mental illness.' You know what you wind up with? You wind up with Obama in the White House and liars in every phase of the government. That's what you wind up with. It's a weak, sick, nation. A weak, sick, broken nation. And you need men like me to save the country. You need men to stand up and say stop crying like a baby over everything&amp;nbsp;... No wonder we're being laughed at around the world.

In total, Savage has written 40 books, twenty under his real name of Michael Weiner, and twenty under his pseudonym of Michael Savage. As Michael Savage, his works include two #1 ''New York Times'' Best Sellers and three additional books which made ''[[The New York Times Best Seller list]]''.&lt;ref name="Ref-1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Hawes New York Times Best Seller list |url=http://www.hawes.com/2004/2004-01-18.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106021054/http://www.hawes.com/2004/2004-01-18.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 6, 2009 |access-date=May 9, 2009 |publisher=[[Hawes]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref-2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Hawes New York Times Best Seller list |url=http://www.hawes.com/2005/2005-05-01.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006150437/http://www.hawes.com/2005/2005-05-01.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 6, 2008 |access-date=May 9, 2009 |publisher=[[Hawes]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref-3"&gt;{{cite web |title=Hawes New York Times Best Seller list |url=http://www.hawes.com/2006/2006-05-14.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121012104/http://www.hawes.com/2006/2006-05-14.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 21, 2008 |access-date=May 9, 2009 |publisher=[[Hawes]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; have also been reprinted under his alias of Michael Savage.

His earlier books as Michael A. Weiner, Ph.D., are focused around his doctoral expertise in the field of [[nutrition]]al [[ethnomedicine]]. In them, he advocates [[nutrition]]al, [[Herbalism|herbal]], and [[Homeopathy|homeopathic]] options to approach the prevention and treatment of diseases such as [[Malnutrition|poor diet]], [[Ageing|aging]], [[arthritis]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[cancer]], [[Allergy|allergies]], [[Cocaine dependence|cocaine addiction]], the [[common cold]], and [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref name="amazon.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Michael-A.-Weiner/e/B001HCYZ9W|title=Michael A. Weiner|website=www.amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also written about [[tree planting]], [[Beer sommelier#Beer tasting|beer-tasting]], and [[Nutrition|nutritional cooking]].&lt;ref name="amazon.com" /&gt;

His more recent books as Michael Savage are political in nature and published by a variety of different companies. His recent works also include holiday family stories and thrillers.

In 1991, Savage self-published ''The Death of the White Male'', an argument against [[affirmative action]], through Quantum Books.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite web|title =Entry for: ''The death of the white male'' |work=[[WorldCat]].org |url =http://worldcat.org/oclc/54958700?tab=holdings |access-date =January 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Savage, calls affirmative action "[[reverse discrimination]]", and demonstrates his emerging philosophy. This eventually led to his starting the Paul Revere Society and he continues to sell the book to raise money for this group.&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sponsor the Paul Revere Society |work=Paul Revere Society website |url=http://www.olsenclan.com/clients/savage/prs_sponsor.shtml |access-date=January 18, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211084614/http://www.olsenclan.com/clients/savage/prs_sponsor.shtml |archivedate=December 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2003, Savage published ''The Savage Nation: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Borders, Language and Culture'', his first major book under the pseudonym Michael Savage. The book quickly reached the top of ''The New York Times Best Seller list]'', earning Savage, as noted above, a commentary show on MSNBC. The book directs attacks at "liberal [[media bias]]", the "dominating culture of 'she-ocracy'", [[LGBT rights by country or territory|gay activists]], and liberals.

In January 2004, Savage published his second political book ''[[The Enemy Within (Savage book)|The Enemy Within: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Schools, Faith, and Military]]''. His next book, ''[[Liberalism Is a Mental Disorder]]'', was released on April 12, 2005. Unlike ''The Savage Nation'', both of these books cited sources for some of the more controversial claims made.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In April 2006, Savage released ''[[The Political Zoo]]''. The book contains [[Satire|satirical]] profiles and cartoons of different public figures, most of whom are liberal political figures and celebrities, depicted in [[caricature]] as animals in the "Political Zoo", with Savage portrayed as the zoo keeper.

In October 2010, Savage released ''Trickle Up Poverty: Stopping Obama's Attack on Our Borders, Economy, and Security''. Released through the [[HarperCollins]] imprint of [[William Morrow and Company]], Savage argues in the book that "Americans are boiling mad over the way Congress and this [[Marxism|Marxist]]/[[Leninism|Leninist]]-oriented President are manipulating the current economic crisis to nationalize businesses."&lt;ref&gt;Boog, Jason. "[http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/michael-savage-sells-trickle-up-poverty-to-william-morrow_b11988 Michael Savage Sells 'Trickle Up Poverty' to William Morrow]". ''Galleycat''. Media Bistro. June 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, it was confirmed that Savage had signed a deal to write two thrillers for publisher St. Martin's Press. The first political thriller, ''[[Abuse of Power]]'', was released on September 13, 2011. The novel is based on "My fictionalized account of being banned from Britain and hunted by overbearing governments is set in the San Francisco only I know", said Savage. It is set in [[San Francisco]], mainly in [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]], as well as [[London]], and [[Tel Aviv]]. It tells the story of a failed carjacking that reveals a government cover-up. A dark plot involving British officials and a terrorist group known as "the Hand of Allah". The publisher has described the novel by saying, "will make 9/11 look like child's play".&lt;ref&gt;Bosman, Julie.

In 2014, Savage released ''Stop the Coming Civil War: My Savage Truth'', in which Savage writes in part, "We are under assault from both inside and out as our government moves to consolidate its domestic power, while at the same time weakening our defenses against the growing power of our enemies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/18/book-review-how-a-divided-nation-can-proceed/|last=Vernon|first=Wes|work=The Washington Times|date=November 18, 2014|accessdate=May 2, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141119203910/http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/18/book-review-how-a-divided-nation-can-proceed/?page=all|archivedate=November 19, 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Savage released another New York Times Best Seller titled ''Government Zero: No Borders, No Language, No Culture.'' It tells of how the country has been left without the founding principles of his radio show, "borders, language and culture," and the destruction the Obama Presidency brought to the country. Savage offered several solutions as to how to rebuild the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/23/inside-the-beltway-new-book-from-michael-savage-go/|title=New book from Michael Savage: ‘Government Zero: No Borders, No Language, No Culture’|last=Harper|first=Jennifer|work=The Washington Times|date=September 23, 2015|accessdate=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 Savage released "Scorched Earth: Restoring The Country After Obama". This New York Times best seller was a blueprint for how then candidate Donald Trump could help get the country back on the right track should he win the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sadar|first=Anthony J.|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/sep/21/book-review-scorched-earth-restoring-the-country-a/|title=Book Review: 'Scorched Earth: Restoring the Country After Obama'|work=[[The Washington Times]]|date=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, Savage released what he said would be his last political book, ''Trump's War: His Battle For America''. The book debuted at number one on The New York Times Best Seller List.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/mar/27/michael-savage-new-book-trumps-war-hits-no-1-on-ne/|title=Michael Savage new book 'Trump’s War' hits No. 1 on New York Times Best Seller list|last=Harper|first=Jennifer|work=[[The Washington Times]]|access-date=May 10, 2017|date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017 Dr. Savage released a non-political book based on his lifelong quest for spiritual truth titled, "God, Faith, and Reason." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harper|first=Jennifer|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/nov/13/inside-the-beltway-michael-savage-leaps-into-faith/|title=Inside the Beltway: Michael Savage leaps into faith with new book|work=[[The Washington Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Myth of Redemptive Violence''' is an archetypal [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] in [[literature]], especially in [[empire|imperial]] cultures.  One of the oldest versions of this story is the [[creation myth]] of [[Babylon]] (the [[Enûma Elish]]) from around 1250 B.C.  [[Walter Wink]] coined the term as part of an analysis of its impact on modern culture and its role in maintaining oppressive power structures in his book ''The Powers That Be''.

==Narrative and effect==
While contrasting the Enûma Elish with the [[Genesis creation myth]] found in the [[Book of Genesis]], Wink examines the psychological effects of each phase of the story.  He asserts that every phase of the narrative serves to reinforce the ideology of the status quo and convince us to perpetuate the ruling power structure:

===Primal chaos===
The primacy of [[Tiamat]] suggests that chaos and evil are the original and natural state of the universe.  This can be used to convince us to fear and oppose any threat to the current order, under the assumption that things can only get worse.  Superheroes especially have dark origins (for example, the murder of [[Bruce Wayne]]'s parents and the destruction of [[Krypton (comics)|planet Krypton]]), and the pervasiveness of evil is depicted by the resurrection of villains in [[horror movies]] and [[cartoons]], the exaggerated presence of violent crime in [[news]] coverage, and the overwhelming number and variety of bad creatures in [[The Lord of the Rings]].

===Tammuz===
Tiamat and her allies oppress the other gods, who, at first, seem powerless to resist.  This acknowledges the effectiveness of alternative systems, and gives us the guilty pleasure of vicariously harming our "betters" and breaking their rules.  However, all this is constrained by the exaggerated flaws of the antagonists, which foreshadow their failure and make us ashamed to identify with them.  [[Horror films]] tend to emphasize this part of the narrative to the extreme, whereas [[superhero]] stories often marginalize it.

===Heroism===
[[Marduk]] offers to defeat Tiamat in exchange for absolute rule over the remaining gods, and they all agree.  This elevates "[[might makes right]]" to a contract made at the beginning of the universe.  People are inclined to identify with the hero because of his privileges and his good attributes, and to sympathize with any subsequent oppression.  Modern examples include [[James Bond]]'s license to kill, the gold mine given to [[Doc Savage]]'s father, Friday's loyalty to [[Robinson Crusoe]], the brazen dishonesty of [[Jedi]] knights, the extremes of [[Jack Bauer]], etc.

===Triumph===
Marduk slays his enemies in creative, gory, and intricate ways, then goes on to enslave their underlings.  This shows that good prevails and evil suffers; the corollary to this is that those who prevail are good.  This gives us the catharsis of vengeance and indignation.  Once again we can sadistically enjoy a character's suffering, but this time in a sanctioned, acceptable context.  The spectacular downfall and glorious victory prompt us to reject the antagonist and  reaffirm our commitment to the winning party, respectively.  [[Action movies]] and [[video games]] tend to have a decisive final battle.  An opposition leader's death scene often includes ridiculously thorough destruction of his or her body, property, and/or organization, such as [[Julius No|Dr. No]] drowning in the core of his nuclear reactor, which then melts down.

===Redemption===
Marduk makes the world from Tiamat's corpse and humanity from the blood of [[Kingu]].  This leaves us with the message that our prosperity and even our very existence required past violence and destruction; as Wink puts it, "We are the outcome of deicide."  This helps justify recent and ongoing violence by appealing to our self-interest.  The death or defeat of the antagonist tends to be immediately followed by an idyllic happy ending in simple, violent plots of all stripes.  Current examples include the [[Ewok]] percussion instrument made from [[Imperial stormtrooper|Storm Trooper]] and other Imperial helmets (or heads) at the end of [[Return of the Jedi]], and the brain surgery Doc Savage uses to turn criminals into productive citizens.

==Opposing views==
Traditionally, [[anthropology|anthropologists]] have noted that myths transmit elements of culture and shape the listener's worldview without making value judgments as to the merit of a given culture or the validity of its worldview.  Wink's analysis is predicated on the notion that Babylonian society and pagan religion, as well as Western society and popular culture, are intrinsically less valid than his notion of first century [[Christian]] society and "pure" [[monotheism]].

It has also been postulated that the creation story of Genesis was developed in reaction to earlier stories, including the Enûma Elish, since the stories share common elements that other creation beliefs lack.  Adherents of [[meme]] theory see the similarity as more fundamental: each story advocates a certain power structure, which has led people in power to support the story that favors them, often oppressively and often using violence.  Whether or not a myth directly advocates violence and oppression, it may still foster misery and destruction.

== The Two Brothers ==

{{Cleanup|section|reason=needs proper citations &amp; formatting|date=October 2014}}

The [[Tale of Two Brothers]] is an ancient Egyptian story from around the 13th century BCE. The narrative is preserved on the [[Papyrus D'Orbiney]]. [Tale of Two Brothers] which had belonged to Seti II (1209-1205 B.C.) of the nineteenth Egyptian dynasty when he was crown prince [William Matthew Flinders Petrie, Egyptian Tales: Translated from the Papyri, 1895, p.&amp;nbsp;66 ] and may have been a political satire based in part on his own difficulties with his half brother, the usurper Amenmesse[J. H. Breasted Ancient Records of Egypt, Part Three, §§ 239ff. ], but the historical facts concerning this period are so uncertain as to render such a conclusion speculative. The text has similarities to the story of Joseph in the house of Potiphar, in Genesis 39:1-20, however the relation between the two texts is unclear, if, indeed, there is one.[Shaw, Ian. &amp; Nicholson, Paul. The Dictionary of Ancient Egypt, p.&amp;nbsp;54. The British Museum Press, 1995] Further elements of the story seem to be derived from the myths concerning Osiris' death and resurrection.[Erman, Adolph. Life in Ancient Egypt. p.&amp;nbsp;379. Dover Publications, 1971. ] The protagonists Anpu and Bata both bear names of gods of the 17th nome of Upper Egypt.

===Synopsis===
Bata lives with his married brother Anpu. One day, when Anpu is not at home, his wife tries to seduce Bata, and, having been repelled, accuses Bata of having made advances towards her. Anpu grows angry and wants to kill his younger brother who flees. Pre-Harakhte saves him by creating a body of water full of crocodiles between him and his brother. Bata tells his brother what has occurred and, as proof of his sincerity, cuts off his genitals which are swallowed by a fish. Anpu returns home and kills his wife. Bata lives alone in the wilderness until the gods create a wife for him. Bata loves her very much and reveals to her that his heart is hidden in a pine. Pharaoh, on learning of her existence has her brought to his court. She tells him Bata's secret and he has the pine cut down, killing Bata. Anpu goes to look for his brother, and after finding his body he searches for his heart and finds it after years of searching. Bata is revived and wants to take revenge on his wife. He changes himself into a beautiful bull and his brother takes him to Pharaoh. Bata reveals himself to his wife who has him killed. Two drops of his blood are spilled and from them grow two persea trees, incarnations of Bata. His wife has them felled, but a splinter of their wood enters her mouth, she swallows it and becomes pregnant. She gives birth to a boy, a reincarnation of Bata, who is acknowledged as the Pharaoh's heir. When Pharaoh dies and he becomes king, he has the queen tried and killed.

'''Neuroheuristics''' (or '''Neuristics''') studies the dynamic relations between the complex knowledge acquired by [[neuroscience]] by means of an approach not reducible in an expertise since it is continuously renewed at every stage of progress towards scientific discovery.

==Etymology==
The word comes from the Greek νεύρον ([[neuron]], which refers to the nerve cell&lt;ref name="Neuron"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/410669/neuron|title=Neuron |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and εύρισκω ("euriskein" [[heuristic]], which refers to a [[problem-solving]] procedure that is often characterized by its informal, intuitive and speculative features&lt;ref name="Heuristics"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/593468/thought/275926/Structures-of-problems|title=Structure of problems in thought |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Paradigm==
Neuroheuristics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Neuro Heuristic paradigm |publisher=Neuroheuristic Research Group  | url=http://neuroheuristic.org/nhrg/docs/def/NHparadigm.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines a [[scientific paradigm]] aimed to develop strategies that can be enabled to understand brain and mind following subsequent problems emerging from [[transdisciplinary studies]] including [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], [[pharmacology]], [[physics]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[engineering]], [[computer science]], [[economics]] and [[mathematics]].

The neuroheuristic paradigm was presented for the first time at the conference ''Entrer dans le XXIe siècle : de l'apoptose à la métamorphose'', held in 1994 at the Centro Stefano Franscini [[Monte Verità]], under the auspice of the XV Videart Festival Locarno.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.davel.vd.ch/qfpdavel/0/D3963.pdf|title=Vers un nouveau paradigme en neurosciences|publisher=Archives cantonales vaudoises, document reference PP 525/806.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2015}}

The research framework introduced by the neuroheuristic paradigm appears as an essential step for the investigation of the information processing effected by the brain because it is the outcome of [[nature and nurture]], at the crossing of [[top-down and bottom-up design]].

The neurobiologists apply a "bottom-up" research strategy in their studies. This strategy seems to prove necessary and sufficient to understand a brain in its entirety after the impressive achievements in studying the entire nervous system of a simple model organism, such as ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A database featuring behavioral and structural anatomy of ''Caenorhabditis elegans''|url=http://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/nervous/Neuroframeset.html}} {{cite web |title=Specification of the nervous system of ''C. elegans''| url=http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_specnervsys/specnervsys.html}} {{cite journal |last1=White |first1=J.G. |last2=Southgate |first2=E. |last3=Thomson |first3=J.N. |last4=Brenner |first4=S.|title= The Structure of the Nervous System of the Nematode ''Caenorhabditis elegans'' |journal= Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B |volume=314 |issue=1165 |pages=1–340 |year=1986 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1986.0056 |pmid=22462104}} {{cite news|last=Jabr|first=Ferris|title=The Connectome Debate: Is Mapping the Mind of a Worm Worth It?|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=c-elegans-connectome|newspaper=Scientific American}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it is not wholly viable to actual experimentation considering the impossibility of simultaneously examining all cellular elements of the brain and all variables that affect those elements.

The "top-down" strategy with the assistance of [[black box theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Botterill|first1=George|last2=Carruthers|first2=Peter|title=The Philosophy of Psychology|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521559157|url=http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780511037986}} {{cite journal|last=Von Hilgers| first=Philipp| title=The History of the Black Box: The Clash of a Thing and its Concept| journal=Cultural Politics| year=2011| volume=7| issue=1| pages=41–58| url=http://culturalpolitics.dukejournals.org/content/7/1/41.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;  appears easier to bring to fulfillment but insufficient and irrelevant in understanding the mechanisms coordinating the local networks of cellular elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burke|first=Robert E.|title=Sir Charles Sherrington's the integrative action of the nervous system: a centenary appreciation|journal=Brain|year=2007|volume=130|issue=4|pages=887–894|doi=10.1093/brain/awm022|pmid=17438014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''neuroheuristic'' (or ''neuristic'') paradigm offers as a needed and possible distinct approach to the study of brain and mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=John G.|last2=Villa|first2=Alessandro E.P.|title=The "Conscious I": A Neuroheuristic Approach to the Mind| year=2001| volume=3| series=Frontiers of Life| pages=349–368| isbn=9780120773404 | url=http://neuroheuristic.org/nhrg/msps/_01cftv.zip }} {{cite journal| last=Villa| first=Alessandro E.P.| title=Neuroheuristics, a new paradigm in neuroscience|journal=Rev Med Suisse Romande| year=2000| volume=120| issue=9| pages=743–748| pmid=11094540 |url=http://neuroheuristic.org/nhrg/msps/_00v1.zip }} {{cite journal|last=Villa|first=Alessandro E.P.|title=Neural Coding in the Neuroheuristic Perspective| year=2008| volume=1| series=Biosemiotics| pages=357–377| doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-6340-4_16}} {{cite journal|last1=Villa|first1=Alessandro E.P.|last2=Missonnier|first2=Pascal|last3=Lintas|first3=Alessandra|title=Neuroheuristics of Decision Making: From Neuronal Activity to EEG |year=2012| volume=28| series=Intelligent Systems Reference Library |pages=159–194| doi=10.1007/978-3-642-24647-0_7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this framework, a "result" cannot be simply positive or negative because the process itself cannot be reduced to proficiency as such. Dynamics is an essential feature of the neuroheuristic paradigm, but it cannot be merely considered as the neurobiological facet of [[holism]] as opposed to [[reductionism]].

[[File:Panopticon.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Multiview orthographic projection#Elevation|Elevation]], [[Multiview orthographic projection#Section|section]] and [[Multiview orthographic projection#Plan|plan]] of Jeremy Bentham's Panopticon penitentiary, drawn by [[Willey Reveley]], 1791]]
The '''Panopticon''' is a type of institutional building and a system of control designed by the English philosopher and social theorist [[Jeremy Bentham]] in the late 18th century. The scheme of the design is to allow all (''pan-'') [[inmate]]s of an institution to be observed (''-opticon'') by a single watchman without the inmates being able to tell whether or not they are being watched. Although it is physically impossible for the single watchman to observe all the inmates' cells at once, the fact that the inmates cannot know when they are being watched means that they are motivated to act as though they are being watched at all times. Thus, they are effectively compelled to regulate their own behaviour. The name may also allude to the many-eyed giant [[Panoptes]] in [[Greek mythology]], some of whose eyes were always awake, making him a highly effective watchman.

The design consists of a circular structure with an "inspection house" at its centre, from which the manager or staff of the institution is able to watch the inmates. The inmates, who are stationed around the perimeter of the structure, are unable to see into the inspection house. Bentham conceived the basic plan as being equally applicable to hospitals, schools, sanatoriums, and asylums, but he devoted most of his efforts to developing a design for a Panopticon prison. It is his prison that is now most widely meant by the term "panopticon".

Bentham described the Panopticon as "a new mode of obtaining power of mind over mind, in a quantity hitherto without example".{{Sfn |Bentham |1843d |p=39}} Elsewhere, in a letter, he described the Panopticon prison as "a mill for grinding rogues honest".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Works |volume=10. Memoirs Part I and Correspondence |year=1843 |first=Jeremy |last=Bentham |publisher=Liberty fund |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/bentham-the-works-of-jeremy-bentham-vol-10-memoirs-part-i-and-correspondence?q=a+mill+for+grinding+rogues+honest#Bentham_0872-10_1504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conceptual history ==
{{quote |Morals reformed—health preserved—industry invigorated—instruction diffused—public burthens lightened—Economy seated, as it were, upon a rock—the [[Gordian Knot]] of the [[Poor Law|poor-law]] not cut, but untied—all by a simple idea in Architecture!{{Sfn | Bentham | 1843d | p = 39}}}}

In 1786 and 1787, Bentham travelled to [[Krychaw|Krichev]] in White Russia (modern [[Belarus]]) to visit his brother, [[Samuel Bentham|Samuel]], who was engaged in managing various industrial and other projects for [[Grigory Potemkin|Prince Potemkin]]. It was Samuel (as Jeremy later repeatedly acknowledged) who conceived the basic idea of a circular building at the hub of a larger compound as a means of allowing a small number of managers to oversee the activities of a large and unskilled workforce.{{Sfn | Semple | 1993 | pp = 99–100}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Prisons and prison systems: a global encyclopedia| first = Mitchel P | last = Roth |year= 2006 |publisher=Greenwood |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RTH31DgbTzgC&amp;pg=PA33|page= 33| isbn = 9780313328565 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeremy began to develop this model, particularly as applicable to prisons, and outlined his ideas in a series of letters sent home to his father in England.{{Sfn | Semple | 1993 | pp = 99–101}}  He supplemented the supervisory principle with the idea of ''contract management''; that is, an administration by contract as opposed to trust, where the director would have a [[pecuniary]] interest in lowering the average rate of mortality.{{Sfn | Semple | 1993 | pp = 134–40}}

The Panopticon was intended to be cheaper than the prisons of his time, as it required fewer staff; "Allow me to construct a prison on this model," Bentham requested to a Committee for the Reform of Criminal Law, "I will be the [[gaoler]]. You will see&amp;nbsp;... that the gaoler will have no salary—will cost nothing to the nation." As the watchmen cannot be seen, they need not be on duty at all times, effectively leaving the watching to the watched.  According to Bentham's design, the prisoners would also be used as menial labour, walking on wheels to spin [[loom]]s or run a [[water wheel]]. This would decrease the cost of the prison and give a possible source of income.{{Sfn | Bentham | 1995 | pages = 29–95}}

== Abortive prison project ==
On his return to England from Russia, Bentham continued to work on the idea of a Panopticon prison, and commissioned drawings from an architect, [[Willey Reveley]].{{Sfn | Semple | 1993 | p = 118}}  In 1791, he published the material he had written as a book, although he continued to refine his proposals for many years to come. He had by now decided that he wanted to see the prison built: when finished, it would be managed by himself as contractor-governor, with the assistance of Samuel. After unsuccessful attempts to interest the authorities in Ireland and revolutionary France,&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 102–4, 107–8.&lt;/ref&gt; he started trying to persuade the prime minister, [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]], to revive an earlier abandoned scheme for a National Penitentiary in England, this time to be built as a Panopticon. He was eventually successful in winning over Pitt and his advisors, and in 1794 was paid £2,000 for preliminary work on the project.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 108–10, 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

The intended site was one that had been authorised (under an [[List of Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain, 1760–1779|act]] of 1779) for the earlier Penitentiary, at [[Battersea]] Rise; but the new proposals ran into technical legal problems and objections from the local landowner, [[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer|Earl Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 169–89.&lt;/ref&gt; Other sites were considered, including one at Hanging Wood, near [[Woolwich]], but all proved unsatisfactory.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 194–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually Bentham turned to a site at Tothill Fields, near [[Westminster]]. Although this was common land, with no landowner, there were a number of parties with interests in it, including [[Richard Grosvenor, 1st Earl Grosvenor|Earl Grosvenor]], who owned a house on an adjacent site and objected to the idea of a prison overlooking it. Again, therefore, the scheme ground to a halt.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 197–217.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, however, it became clear that a nearby site at [[Millbank]], adjoining the [[River Thames|Thames]], was available for sale, and this time things ran more smoothly. Using government money, Bentham bought the land on behalf of the Crown for £12,000 in November 1799.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 217–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

From his point of view, the site was far from ideal, being marshy, unhealthy, and too small. When he asked the government for more land and more money, however, the response was that he should build only a small-scale experimental prison—which he interpreted as meaning that there was little real commitment to the concept of the Panopticon as a cornerstone of penal reform.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 226–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations continued, but in 1801 Pitt resigned from office, and in 1803 the new [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth|Addington]] administration decided not to proceed with the project.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 236–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Bentham was devastated: "They have murdered my best days."&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, a few years later the government revived the idea of a National Penitentiary, and in 1811 and 1812 returned specifically to the idea of a Panopticon.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 265–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Bentham, now aged 63, was still willing to be governor. However, as it became clear that there was still no real commitment to the proposal, he abandoned hope, and instead turned his attentions to extracting financial compensation for his years of fruitless effort. His initial claim was for the enormous sum of nearly £700,000, but he eventually settled for the more modest (but still considerable) sum of £23,000.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 279–81.&lt;/ref&gt; An Act of Parliament in 1812 transferred his title in the site to the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;Penitentiary House, etc. Act: 52 Geo. III, c. 44 (1812).&lt;/ref&gt;

Bentham remained bitter throughout his later life about the rejection of the Panopticon scheme, convinced that it had been thwarted by the King and an aristocratic elite. It was largely because of his sense of injustice and frustration that he developed his ideas of "sinister interest"—that is, of the vested interests of the powerful conspiring against a wider public interest—which underpinned many of his broader arguments for reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Philip |last=Schofield |title=Bentham: a guide for the perplexed |year=2009 |place=London |publisher= Continuum |isbn=978-0-8264-9589-1 |pages= 90–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Millbank Prison|National Penitentiary]] was indeed subsequently built on the Millbank site, but to a design by William Williams that owed little to the Panopticon, beyond the fact that the governor's quarters, administrative offices, and chapel were placed at the centre of the complex. It opened in 1816.

Although most prison designs have included elements of surveillance, the essential elements of Bentham's design were not only that the custodians should be able to view the prisoners at all times (including times when they were in their cells), but also that the prisoners should be unable to see the custodians, and so could never be sure whether or not they were under surveillance. This objective was extremely difficult to achieve within the constraints of the available technology, which explains why Bentham spent so many years reworking his plans.  Subsequent 19th-century prison designs enabled the custodians to keep the doors of cells and the outsides of buildings under observation, but not to see the prisoners in their cells. Something close to a realization of Bentham's vision only became possible through 20th-century technological developments—notably [[closed-circuit television]] (CCTV)—but these eliminated the need for a specific architectural framework.

It has been argued that the Panopticon influenced the radial design of 19th-century prisons built on the principles of the "[[separate system]]" (including [[Eastern State Penitentiary]] in [[Philadelphia]], opened in 1829, and the later [[HM Prison Pentonville|Pentonville Prison]] in London and [[Armagh Women's Prison|Armagh Gaol]] in Northern Ireland).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Andrzejewski |first= Anna Vemer |title= Building Power: Architecture and Surveillance in Victorian America |place= Knoxville |publisher= University of Tennessee Press |year= 2008 |isbn= 978-1-57233631-5 |pages= 18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these prisons control was exercised through strict prisoner isolation rather than surveillance, but they also incorporated a design of radiating wings, allowing a centrally located guard to observe the door of every cell.

===Claimed influence===
As noted, none of these prisons—with the arguable exceptions mentioned above—are true Panopticons in the Benthamic sense. In some cases, the claims for any influence are very dubious indeed, and seem to be based on little more than the fact that (for example) the design is circular.

Bentham always conceived the Panopticon principle as being beneficial to the design of a variety of institutions in which surveillance was important, including hospitals, schools, workhouses, and lunatic asylums, as well as prisons.

A wooden Panopticon factory, capable of holding 5000 workers, was constructed by [[Samuel Bentham]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], on the banks of the [[Neva River]], between 1805 and 1808: its purpose was to educate and employ young men in trades connected with the navy. It burned down in 1818.{{Sfn|Semple|1993|pp=214–5.}} The Round Mill in [[Belper]], Derbyshire, England, is supposed to have been built on the Panopticon principle with a central overseer.

It was considered a model facility at the time.

The Panopticon has been suggested as an "open" hospital architecture:

The [[Akron Plan]] common in American Protestant church buildings in the late 19th and early 20th centuries is based on similar principles to the panopticon, although there is no evidence of direct influence.

[[File:Contrasted Residences for the Poor.jpg|thumb|right|upright|"Contrasted Residences for the Poor": a plate from [[Augustus Pugin]]'s ''Contrasts'' (1841)]]
Despite the fact that no Panopticon was built during Bentham's lifetime (and virtually none since), his concept has prompted considerable discussion and debate. Whereas Bentham himself regarded the Panopticon as a rational, enlightened, and therefore just, solution to societal problems, his ideas have been repeatedly criticised by others for their reductive, mechanistic and inhumane approach to human lives. Thus, in 1841, [[Augustus Pugin]] published the second edition of his work ''[[Augustus Pugin#Contrasts|Contrasts]]'' in which one plate showed a "Modern Poor House" (clearly modelled on a Panopticon), a bleak and comfortless structure in which the pauper is separated from his family, subjected to a harsh discipline, fed on a minimal diet, and consigned after death to medical dissection, contrasted with an "Antient Poor House", an architecturally inspiring religious institution in which the pauper is treated throughout with humanity and dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Margaret |last= Belcher |chapter=Pugin Writing |editor1-first=Paul |editor1-last= Atterbury |editor2-first= Clive |editor2-last=Wainwright |title=Pugin: a Gothic Passion |publisher=Yale University Press |place= London |year= 1994 |isbn=0-30006012-2 |pages=105–16 (108–9) }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, American historian [[Gertrude Himmelfarb]] published an essay, "The Haunted House of Jeremy Bentham", in which she depicted Bentham's mechanism of surveillance as a tool of oppression and social control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gertrude |last= Himmelfarb |authorlink=Gertrude Himmelfarb |chapter=The Haunted House of Jeremy Bentham |editor1-first= Richard |editor1-last= Herr |editor2-first=Harold T. |editor2-last=Parker |title=Ideas in History: essays presented to Louis Gottschalk by his former students |publisher=Duke University Press |place=Durham, NC |year= 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parallel arguments were put forward by French psychoanalyst [[Jacques-Alain Miller]] in an essay entitled "Le despotisme de l'utile: la machine panoptique de Jeremy Bentham", written in 1973 and published in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jacques-Alain |last= Miller |authorlink= Jacques-Alain Miller |trans-title=The despotism of the useful: Jeremy Bentham’s panoptical machine | title=La despotisme de l'utile: la machine panoptique de Jeremy Bentham | language = fr | journal=Ornicar? |volume=3 |year=1975 |pages= 3–36}}; published in English as {{cite journal |first= Jacques-Alain |last= Miller |authorlink= Jacques-Alain Miller |title= Jeremy Bentham's Panoptic Device |journal= October |volume= 41 |year= 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Martin |last= Jay |authorlink= Martin Jay |title=Downcast eyes: the denigration of vision in twentieth-century French thought |place= Berkeley |publisher= University of California Press |year= 1993 |isbn= 0-52008154-4 |pages= 381–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most influentially, the idea of the panopticon was invoked by French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]], in his ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' (1975), as a metaphor for modern "disciplinary" societies and their pervasive inclination to observe and normalise. This means that the Panopticon operates as a power mechanism. "On the whole, therefore, one can speak of the formation of a disciplinary society in this movement that stretches from the enclosed disciplines, a sort of social 'quarantine', to an indefinitely generalizable mechanism of 'panopticism'".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Foucault|1995|pp=195–210}}: quotation at p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; The Panopticon is an ideal architectural figure of modern disciplinary power which Foucault proposes had existed before it was named as such. Foucault references quarantine procedures in response to the plague at the end of the seventeenth century, which predate the model of the panopticon but resemble the control dynamic closely. A plague-ridden town would be partitioned, then each house would be locked with guards on each street end in a similar design to the later-theorized panopticon. The Panopticon creates a consciousness of permanent visibility as a form of power, where no bars, chains, and heavy locks are necessary for domination any more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Thomas |last=Allmer |year=2012 |title=Towards a Critical Theory of Surveillance in Informational Capitalism |place=Frankfurt am Main |publisher=Peter Lang |page=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of actual surveillance, the mere threat of surveillance is what disciplines society into behaving according to rules and norms. Furthermore, the spectator of the panopticon changes in Foucault's account, for the idea that fellow people are watching and spectating reinforces the disciplinary society. Foucault proposes that not only prisons but all [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] structures like the army, schools, hospitals and factories have evolved through history to resemble Bentham's Panopticon. The notoriety of the design today (although not its lasting influence in architectural realities) stems from Foucault's famous analysis of it.

[[File:CCTV graffiti - geograph.org.uk - 977154.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Anti-CCTV graffiti]]
Building on Foucault, contemporary social critics often assert that technology has allowed for the deployment of panoptic structures invisibly throughout society. [[Surveillance]] by [[closed-circuit television|CCTV]] cameras in public spaces is an example of a technology that brings the gaze of a superior into the daily lives of the populace. Furthermore, a number of cities in the United Kingdom, including Middlesbrough, Bristol, Brighton and London have added loudspeakers to a number of their existing CCTV cameras. They can transmit the voice of a camera supervisor to issue audible messages to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.thehoya.com/viewpoint/092206/view4.cfm | title = Cameras Help Stop Crime | newspaper = The Hoya | date = 22 September 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2006/09/351051.html | title = 2006, But Has 1984 Finally Arrived? | publisher = Indymedia | place = UK | date = 19 September 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, critical analyses of internet practice have suggested that the internet allows for a panoptic form of observation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://theoryandscience.icaap.org/content/vol003.001/brignall.html | title = The New Panopticon: The Internet Viewed as a Structure of Social Control | journal = Theory &amp; science | volume = 3 | number = 1 | publisher = ICAAP}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Internet Service Providers|ISP]]s are able to track users' activities, while user-generated content means that daily social activity may be recorded and broadcast online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://mobimundi.net/ | title=Workshop: Exploring the Impact of User-generated Mobile Content – The Participatory Panopticon | publisher = Mobi mundi | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120311061007/http://mobimundi.net/ | deadurl=yes| archivedate= 11 March 2012| accessdate= 25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shoshana Zuboff]] used the metaphor of the panopticon in her book ''In the Age of the Smart Machine: The Future of Work and Power'' (1988) to describe how computer technology makes work more visible. Zuboff examined how computer systems were used to track the behavior and output of workers. She used the term panopticon because the workers could not tell that they were being spied on, while the manager was able to check their work continuously. As the book was written in 1988, Zuboff's arguments were based on the online information service [[Dialog (online database)|Dialog]] rather than the [[World Wide Web]]. Zuboff argued that there is a collective responsibility formed by the hierarchy in the Information Panopticon that eliminates subjective opinions and judgements of managers on their employees. Because each employee's contribution to the production process is translated into objective data, it becomes more important for managers to be able to analyze the work rather than analyze the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= In the Age of the Smart Machine: The Future of Work and Power | first = Shoshana | last = Zuboff |year=1988 | place =New York | publisher = Basic Books | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] | url= https://courses.lis.illinois.edu/pluginfile.php/227065/mod_resource/content/1/zuboff_info_panopticon.pdf |pages= 315–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lang|isbn=9780820415611|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Derrick Jensen]] and Gerge Draffan's 2004 book ''Welcome to the Machine: Science, Surveillance, and the Culture of Control'' seeks to demonstrate how our society, by techniques like the use of biometric passports to identity chips in consumer goods, from [[nanoparticle]] weapons to body-enhancing and mind-altering drugs for soldiers, is being pushed towards a panopticon-like state. In his 1998 essay, "The Baha’i Faith in America as Panopticon, 1963–1997", academic [[Juan Cole]] compares the [[Bahá'í administration]]'s control over members of the [[Baha'i faith]] to panopticon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cole |first=Juan |date=June 1998 |title=The Baha’i Faith in America as Panopticon, 1963-1997 |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/bahai/1999/jssr/bhjssr.htm |journal=The Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=234–238| access-date=May 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The panopticon has also become a symbol of the extreme measures that some companies take in the name of efficiency as well as to guard against employee theft, documented in a 2009 paper by Max Haiven and Scott Stoneman entitled ''[[Walmart|Wal-Mart]]: The Panopticon of Time''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | format = PDF | url = http://www.opencircle.mcmaster.ca/institute-on-globalization-and-the-human-condition/documents/IGHC-WPS_09-1_HaivenStoneman.pdf | last1 = Haiven | first1 = Max | last2 = Stoneman | first2 = Scott | year = 2009 |title=Wal-Mart: The Panopticon of Time |pages=3–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2014 book by Simon Head, ''Mindless: Why Smarter Machines Are Making Dumber Humans''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Simon |last=Head |chapter=Walmart and Amazon |editor-first=Tim |editor-last=Bartlett |title=Mindless: Why Smarter Machines Makes Dumber Humans |publisher=Basic Books |place=New York, NY |year=2014 |isbn= 0-46501844-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; that describes conditions at an [[Amazon.com]] depot in [[Augsburg]], Germany. Both argue that catering at all times to the desires of the customer can lead to increasingly oppressive corporate environments and [[production quota|quotas]] in which many warehouse workers can no longer keep up with demands of management.

Social theorist [[Simone Browne (sociologist)|Simone Browne]] reviews Bentham's theories in her book ''Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness'' (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Simone |last=Browne |authorlink=Simone Browne (sociologist) |title=Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness |publisher=Duke University Press |place=Durham NC|year=2015 |isbn=9780822359197 |url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/dark-matters }}&lt;/ref&gt; She notes that Bentham travelled on a ship carrying a cargo of what he calls "18 young Negresses" while drafting his Panopticon proposal, and argues that the structure of chattel slavery haunts the theory of the Panopticon. She proposes that the plan of the slave ship ''[[Brookes (ship)|Brookes]]'', produced and distributed by the [[Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade]] in 1789, should be regarded as the paradigmatic blueprint for what she calls "racializing surveillance".

== The Panopticon of Social Media ==

The concept of Panopticon has been referenced in discussions about of the impact of social media. Jake Goldenfein, researcher at the University of Melbourne's Centre for Media and Communications Law explains that, "The relevance of the panopticon as a metaphor begins to wither when we start thinking about whether contemporary types of visuality (effectively digital and data-driven) are analogous to the central tower concept. For example, whether this type of visuality is as asymmetrical, and – I think more importantly – being co-opted for the same political exercise. Does the fact that we don’t know we’re being watched mean we are being normalized in the way the panopticon was intended to correct behaviour?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Thomas|title=What does the panopticon mean in the age of digital surveillance?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/23/panopticon-digital-surveillance-jeremy-bentham|website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A brawl occurred between players of the [[Philippines men's national basketball team|Philippine]] and [[Australia men's national basketball team|Australian]] men's national basketball teams during a match held on July 2, 2018 at the [[Philippine Arena]] in [[Bocaue]], [[Bulacan]], Philippines. The match was part of the [[2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup qualification (Asia)|2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup Asian qualification]] process.

The brawl caused a disruption of the game in the third quarter lasting more than 30 minutes. Officials suspended 4 Australian players and 9 Filipino players and the game was briefly resumed. All but one of the three remaining Filipino players intentionally fouled out prematurely, ending the game within the same quarter. The Philippines lost by default in favour of Australia.

FIBA imposed sanctions on both sides; game suspensions were given to 10 Filipino players (for a maximum of 6 games) and 3 Australian players (maximum of 5 games). The Philippines' head coach and assistant coach were also sanctioned. Both the national federations of the Philippines and Australia were fined. The three referees who officiated at the match were also suspended for a year. Despite the brawl, both Australia and the Philippines advance to the second round of the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup Asian qualifiers.

The Philippine national team is obliged to play their next home match in the second round of the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup Asian qualifiers behind closed doors with the succeeding two home games being placed under probation. The brawl also played a part in their withdrawal from the [[Basketball at the 2018 Asian Games – Men's tournament|2018 Asian Games]], a decision which was later reversed.

==Background==
===Road to 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup===
For the [[2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup]], members of [[FIBA Asia]] and [[FIBA Oceania]] confederations participated in one qualification process.
For the first round of the [[2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup qualification (Asia)|joint Asia and Oceania qualifiers]], the [[Philippines men's national basketball team|Philippines]] and [[Australia men's national basketball team|Australia]] were drawn part of Group B along with [[Chinese Taipei men's national basketball team|Chinese Taipei]] and [[Japan men's national basketball team|Japan]].

The Philippines and Australia first played against each other in the qualifiers in [[Melbourne]]. The home side, Australia won over the visitors 84–68. Prior to the start of their second face off, this time in [[Bocaue]], Philippines, the two teams has already qualified for the second round of the FIBA Basketball World Cup qualifiers.

The last FIBA Basketball World Cup qualifier match of the Philippines prior to their second match-up against Australia was against Chinese Taipei away from home. They won the game by 22 points. The Philippines decided to retain 10 players from the Chinese Taipei game for their next match replacing [[Jio Jalalon]] and [[Allein Maliksi]] with [[Baser Amer]] and [[Carl Bryan Cruz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lintag |first1=Paul |title=Amer added to Gilas for Australia rematch |url=https://sports.abs-cbn.com/basketball/news/2018/07/01/fiba-amer-added-gilas-australia-rematch-43779 |accessdate=July 6, 2018 |work=ABS-CBN Sports |date=July 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia suffered a 78-79 defeat to Japan prior to their second Philippines game but decided to retain the 12 players in their roster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Zarate |first1=Noel |title=Australia to use same lineup in Japan loss against Gilas |url=http://tv5.espn.com/basketball/gilas/story/_/id/23968195/australia-use-same-lineup-japan-loss-gilas |accessdate=July 6, 2018 |work=ESPN |date=July 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closed door practice===
There were already tensions between the Australian and Philippine side prior to the start of the brawl-marred game.&lt;ref name="naredo"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Naredo |first1=Camille |title=FIBA World Cup: After bench-clearing brawl, Gilas loses by default to Australia |url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/07/02/18/fiba-world-cup-after-bench-clearing-brawl-gilas-loses-by-default-to-australia |accessdate=July 3, 2018 |work=ABS-CBN News |date=July 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the closed-door practice by the Australia national team on July 1, 2018,&lt;ref name="dioquino"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dioquino |first1=Delfin |title=SBP accepts Australia apology for PH Arena incident |url=https://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/gilas-pilipinas/206296-sbp-accepts-australia-apology-removing-sponsors-decals-philippine-arena |accessdate=July 3, 2018 |work=Rappler |date=July 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australians removed the decals of corporate sponsors [[PLDT]] and [[Chooks-to-Go]] on the court reportedly due to player safety issues. Officials from the Philippines national basketball association, the [[Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas]] (SBP) criticized the move stating that the Australians should have asked permission. Philippine head coach [[Chot Reyes]] said that the Australians removed the decals for being slippery and added that the decals were approved to use by FIBA. He also mentioned that SBP and FIBA officials were at the venue. Reyes along with SBP official [[Manny V. Pangilinan]] posted the video of the act through [[Twitter]] expressing displeasure of the move saying that they will "not back down" from the Australians.&lt;ref name="removes"&gt;{{cite news |title=Australians remove PLDT decals from PH Arena court |url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/07/01/18/watch-australians-remove-pldt-decals-from-ph-arena-court |accessdate=July 3, 2018 |work=ABS-CBN News |date=July 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia apologized for the incident and the SBP accepted the apology. The SBP however maintained that the actions of the Australian side were unacceptable. The decals were restored two hours prior to tip-off.&lt;ref name="dioquino"/&gt;

===Pre-game confrontations===
During the pre-game warm-ups, Philippine players began crowding onto the Australian half of the court. [[Calvin Abueva]], a member of the Philippine national basketball team, attempted to trip Australian player Daniel Kickert who countered back by pushing and shoving another member of the Philippine basketball team whom he mistook for Abueva. A short confrontation between the two teams resulted thereafter which had to be defused by the referees before the start of the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news.com.au/sport/basketball/video-shows-pregame-incident-sparked-philippines-brawl/news-story/4909ca06a912a0d6d1c4a7d57346b81e|title=What really sparked brawl madness|work=NewsComAu|access-date=2018-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abueva admitted to trying to trip Kickert but insisted that the Australians were already 'bullying' them even before he did so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.spin.ph/basketball/fiba/abueva-admits-tripping-kickert-but-insists-sila-nagsimula-a2437-20180704?ref=site_search|title = Abueva admits tripping Kickert but insists: 'Sila nagsimula'|date =July 4, 2018|accessdate = July 8, 2018|website = [[Sports Interactive Network Philippines|Spin]]|publisher = |last = Leongson|first = Randolph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Match details==
The Australians dominated the match, outscoring the Philippines in all three quarters played. The host was competitive against the visitors in the first quarter until Australia gained a 9-point lead by second quarter. The Philippines never recovered as Australia later achieved a double-digit lead against the hosts. [[Chris Goulding]] led the Australians in the scoring by contributing 20 points while [[Andray Blatche]] led the Philippines with 12 points.&lt;ref name="gilasloses"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lintag |first1=Paul |title=Gilas loses to Australia by default after fight-marred game |url=https://sports.abs-cbn.com/basketball/news/2018/07/02/fiba-gilas-loses-aus-default-fight-marred-game-43830 |accessdate=July 6, 2018 |work=ABS-CBN Sports |date=July 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three referees who officiated the match were Ahmed Al Bulushi of Oman, Hatim Alharbi of Saudi Arabia and Paul Skayem of Lebanon. Jordanian official Fadi Adnan As’Ad Sabbah was the FIBA game commissioner.&lt;ref name=reffire&gt;{{cite news |last1=Henson |first1=Joaquin |title=Refs under fire for losing control |url=https://www.philstar.com/sports/2018/07/04/1830471/refs-under-fire-losing-control |accessdate=July 6, 2018 |work=The Philippine Star |date=July 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippines was trailing 48–79 when the brawl began.

The brawl caused a 30-minute stoppage of the match.&lt;ref name="sbs"&gt;{{cite news |title='Sickening': Australia's Boomers in wild qualifier brawl with Philippines |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/sickening-australia-s-boomers-in-wild-qualifier-brawl-with-philippines |accessdate=July 3, 2018 |work=SBS News |date=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The referees along with security officials left the court and went to the [[OB Van]] of [[ESPN 5]] outside the arena, which was covering the match, to review the brawl from different camera angles. They returned to the court to announce sanctions.&lt;ref name=reffire/&gt;

Match officials ruled that 13 players should be ejected before play was resumed. Officials [[Ejection (sports)|ejected]] four Australian players&lt;ref name="sbs"/&gt; and nine Filipino players&lt;ref name=dioquino2&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dioquino |first1=Delfin |title=Gilas loses to Australia by default in World Cup Qualifiers |url=https://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/gilas-pilipinas/206321-philippines-australia-game-july-2-2018 |accessdate=July 3, 2018 |work=Rappler |date=July 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This meant that the Philippine national team was left with only three players. The match was resumed despite this since FIBA rules state that play should continue as long as both teams have more than one player.&lt;ref name="sbs"/&gt;  [[June Mar Fajardo]], [[Gabe Norwood]] and [[Baser Amer]] were the only Philippine players to remain. Fajardo intentionally [[Foul out (basketball)|fouled out]] and was followed by Norwood leaving Amer as the last Filipino player on the court&lt;ref name="philstar"/&gt; to prematurely end the game with one minute and fifty-seven seconds remaining in the third quarter.&lt;ref name="gilasloses"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
{{expand section|date=July 2018}}
The Philippines lost [[Forfeit (sport)|by default]] due to a lack of eligible players because of the ejection of nine of its players and the remaining players intentionally fouling out. The result of the Philippines-Australia game was allowed to stand. The Philippines ended its first round campaign with four wins and two defeats, both against Australia, settling for second place in Group B while Australia lost only one of its six games topping the group. Both teams advanced to the second round of the qualifiers.&lt;ref name=dioquino2/&gt;

Fearing for their own safety, the Australia national team remained in the Philippine Arena for several hours after the match. They also changed hotels following the game.&lt;ref name="video"&gt;{{cite news |last1=McKern |first1=James |title=Video shows pre-game incident sparked Philippines brawl |url=https://www.news.com.au/sport/basketball/video-shows-pregame-incident-sparked-philippines-brawl/news-story/4909ca06a912a0d6d1c4a7d57346b81e |accessdate=July 3, 2018 |work=News.com.au |date=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Basketball Australia]] apologized for the brawl, accepting the Australia national team's role in the incident but expressing concern for the involvement of officials and fans in the fight.&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite news |title=Basketball Australia apologises for Boomers 'unsavoury' brawl with Philippines, says players 'bruised and battered' |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-07-03/boomers-left-bruised-and-battered-after-brawl-in-philippines/9934478 |accessdate=July 3, 2018 |work=ABC.net |date=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas]] apologized to Filipino fans and to the international basketball community for the brawl saying that the incident "breached the bounds of traditional Filipino hospitality" and asserting that "violence has no place in sports".&lt;ref name="sbpsorry"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Saldajeno |first1=Ivan |title=SBP says sorry after it "breached the bounds of traditional Filipino hospitality" |url=https://www.dugout.ph/2018/07/sbp-says-sorry-after-it-breached-bounds.html |accessdate=July 3, 2018 |work=Dugout Philippines |date=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both federations later issued a joint statement apologizing for the brawl and admitting full responsibility for the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=SBP, Basketball Australia apologize for Gilas-Boomers ‘basketbrawl’ |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/basketball/659321/sbp-basketball-australia-apologize-for-gilas-boomers-basketbrawl/story/ |accessdate=July 9, 2018 |work=GMA News |date=July 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other reactions====
Australia's [[National Basketball League (Australia)|National Basketball League]] on their part said while the Australia national team should accept consequences regarding the brawl, they also condemned players, officials, and fans of the Philippine national team, stating what happened to the Australian side following the brawl is unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bacnis |first1=Justine |title=Aussie league NBL condemns Boomers actions, Filipino fans |url=https://tiebreakertimes.com.ph/tbt/aussie-league-nbl-condemns-boomers-actions-filipino-fans/120399 |accessdate=July 4, 2018 |work=Tiebreaker Times |date=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Philippine Basketball Association]] on 3 July 2018 invited players of the Philippine national team for a closed-door meeting scheduled on July 5, 2018 to discuss the incident, which could possibly impose its own fines and suspensions to members of the Philippine basketball team who were involved. No similar actions as of late were to be seen from Basketball Australia.&lt;ref name="pbameeting"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bacnis |first1=Justine |title=PBA sets up meeting with Gilas regarding brawl |url=https://tiebreakertimes.com.ph/tbt/pba-sets-meeting-gilas-regarding-brawl/120361 |accessdate=July 4, 2018 |work=Tiebreaker Times |date=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group selfie took by Filipino player Marc Pingris with the rest of the Philippine national team was criticized as insensitive but head coach [[Chot Reyes]] and [[Quinito Henson]] said that based on how they knew Pingris personally that the selfie was an attempt to defuse tension.&lt;ref name=sawit/&gt;&lt;ref name=insensitive/&gt; Reyes said that he would have stopped Pingris from taking the selfie given the circumstances.&lt;ref name=sawit/&gt;

According to Australia head coach [[Andrej Lemanis]], the brawl may cause the [[National Basketball Association]], who is already reluctant to release its players for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup qualifiers, to hesitate even more about releasing its players for international play short of the [[FIBA Basketball World Cup]] or the [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NBA may react badly to Philippines brawl, says Australia coach |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jul/04/daniel-kickert-admits-his-elbow-in-filipino-basketball-brawl-was-regrettable |accessdate=July 4, 2018 |work=The Guardian |agency=Australian Associated Press |date=July 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Further allegations====
=====Close door practice sabotage=====
After the brawl-marred game, Australia's coach [[Andrej Lemanis]] accused the Philippines of sabotaging his side's training the day before the match. He stated that when the Australian team went to the training venue, one of the courts in the venue had a rim which was "obviously too high" and when officials came to measure the rim it was too high by {{convert|6|to|7|in|cm}}. Lemanis then alleged that the people helping them in the court disappeared from the venue. He added that it was then that it became evident to his team that the court was unsafe to play on because of the way the decals were installed while reiterating Australia's early acknowledgement of not following the "correct process" in removing the decals. Lemanis said they decided to remove the decals due to time constraints caused by their limited practice time.&lt;ref name=sabotage&gt;{{cite news |title=Boomers coach Andrej Lemanis accuses Philippines of sabotaging Australia’s training session |url=https://www.foxsports.com.au/basketball/boomers-coach-andrej-lemanis-accused-philippines-of-sabotaging-australias-training-session/news-story/63f83b1fc0d52b2286f09e658102839b |accessdate=July 6, 2018 |work=Fox Sport |date=July 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Racism=====
Alleged incidents of [[racism]] were raised after the brawl. Winston Baltasar, a Filipino freelance photographer covering the event, alleged that Australian players had used [[racial slurs]] [[Anti-Filipino sentiment|against Filipinos]] during an interview at ''The Ticket'', a radio program of Australia's [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]. He said that Filipino players had been called "monkeys". The Australian Basketballers' Association and Basketball Australia issued a joint statement calling Baltasar's remarks as "unsubstantiated and highly defamatory" and expressed disappointment with ABC's decision to publish material relating to the remark. In an earlier interview on ''SportsCenter Philippines'', Philippine coach [[Chot Reyes]] said that he hadn't heard any incident of Australian players hurling derogatory remarks towards their Filipino counterparts during the half-time of the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Basketball Australia issues statement on allegation |url=http://tv5.espn.com/basketball/gilas/story/_/id/24039686/basketball-australia-issues-statement-allegation |accessdate=July 9, 2018 |work=ESPN5 |date=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigation===
[[FIBA]] opened disciplinary proceedings against both Australia and the Philippines following the brawl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Philippines v Australia basketball: Mass brawl at World Cup qualifier |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/basketball/44688264 |accessdate=July 3, 2018 |work=BBC Sport |date=July 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The referee of the match submitted statements and presented evidence to FIBA regarding the match and the brawl&lt;ref name="fibaaskms"&gt;{{cite news |title=FIBA asks Gilas PH to explain side |url=http://manilastandard.net/sports/basketball/269698/fiba-asks-gilas-ph-to-explain-side.html |accessdate=6 July 2018 |work=Manila Standard |date=July 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and both the basketball federations of Australia and the Philippines were given video copies recording the incident. Both the Australian and Philippine federation were asked by FIBA to submit their own positions stating their sides regarding the brawl by July 10, 2018 but the deadline was later extended to midnight of July 13, 2018 ([[GMT+6]]).&lt;ref name=extend&gt;{{cite news |last1=Terrado |first1=Jonas |title=FIBA extends deadline for SBP, Basketball Australia |url=https://sports.mb.com.ph/2018/07/12/fiba-extends-deadline-for-sbp-basketball-australia/ |accessdate=July 12, 2018 |work=Manila Bulletin |date=July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sanctions===
Prior to the imposition of sanctions by FIBA, [[Al Panlilio]] of Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas (SBP) expressed hope that FIBA would view the incident as an isolated case and not affect the hosting rights of the Philippines for the [[2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup]]. He also expected that both federations of Australia and the Philippines would be fined and that it would be a surprise if FIBA would choose to impose indefinite suspensions of the respective basketball federations of Australia and the Philippines. He pointed to [[2010 Acropolis International Basketball Tournament|the incident]] between [[Serbia men's national basketball team|Serbia]] and [[Greece men's national basketball team|Greece]] in 2010 as a precedent for his expectation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Galvez |first1=Waylon |title=Panlilio hopes Gilas-Boomers brawl won’t affect 2023 FIBA World Cup PH hosting |url=https://sports.mb.com.ph/2018/07/04/panlilio-hopes-gilas-boomers-brawl-wont-affect-2023-fiba-world-cup-ph-hosting/ |accessdate=July 4, 2018 |work=Manila Bulletin |date=July 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 July, FIBA handed down their decision after conducting disciplinary investigation. 10 players from the Philippine basketball team, its coach [[Chot Reyes]] and assistant coach [[Jong Uichico]], as well as 3 players from Australia were given suspension from playing future games in the qualifiers (six games maximum).&lt;ref name=handsout&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv5.espn.com/basketball/gilas/story/_/id/24002291/fiba-hands-sanctions-gilas-boomers-brawl|title=FIBA hands out sanctions over Gilas-Boomers brawl|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reyes was suspended for a single match while Uichico was suspended for three games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Diamond |first1=James |title=Players, coaches and referees banned after mass brawl in FIBA World Cup qualifier |url=https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1067672/players-coaches-and-referees-banned-after-mass-brawl-in-fiba-world-cup-qualifier |accessdate=July 19, 2018 |work=Inside the Games |date=July 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the SBP, FIBA was clear that the ban imposed on the Philippine players does not apply to the national team's planned participation in the [[Basketball at the 2018 Asian Games|2018 Asian Games]] in Indonesia, as well as their participation with their respective teams in the [[Philippine Basketball Association]], and that the match suspensions are to served in the 2019 FIBA World Cup qualifiers.&lt;ref name="asiangamessanc"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Naredo |first1=Camille |title=SBP assures FIBA sanctions won’t apply to Asian Games |url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/07/19/18/sbp-assures-fiba-sanctions-wont-apply-to-asian-games |accessdate=July 19, 2018 |work=ABS-CBN Sports |date=July 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippines played their next home court match [[Behind closed doors (sport)|behind closed doors]] (against Qatar on September 17, at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]] in [[Quezon City]], with media coverage{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}), while a ban for two more home games as the country have been placed under a probationary period of three years. However, Samahang Basketball ng Pilipinas executive director Sonny Barrios stated if the behind-closed-doors game went well, the homecourt game ban can be possibly lifted and will be open for fans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/07/20/18/fiba-world-cup-ph-hoops-exec-saddened-to-lose-6th-man-in-closed- FIBA World Cup: Philippine hoops exec saddened to lose 6th man in closed door game] [[ABS-CBN News]] Accessed July 21, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The country's co-hosting of the [[2023 FIBA World Cup]] is not affected by the sanctions.&lt;ref name=handsout/&gt;

===Impact===
====Philippines' Asian Games participation====
The brawl played a part in the Philippines' withdrawal from the [[Basketball at the 2018 Asian Games|basketball competition of the 2018 Asian Games]]. Before the brawl incident, the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas (SBP) planned to send a national team composed of the core of the [[TNT KaTropa]] of the Philippine Basketball Association. However such plan was cancelled after several players of the ball club along with naturalized player Andray Blatche got involved in the brawl. Though the player suspensions has no bearing in the Asian Games since the sanctions will be served in the next round of the FIBA Basketball World Cup qualifiers, the SBP decided not to include any of players suspended due to the brawl in the Philippines' Asian Games roster.&lt;ref name="clarkson"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Naredo |first1=Camille |title=Clarkson included in Gilas line-up, but will he play in Asian Games? |url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/07/24/18/clarkson-included-in-gilas-line-up-but-will-he-play-in-asian-games |accessdate=July 27, 2018 |work=ABS-CBN News |date=July 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A plan was devised to send a national team composed of the core of the [[Rain or Shine Elasto Painters]] instead of TNT with [[NLEX Road Warriors]] coach Yeng Guiao to mentor the team. The Philippine Basketball Association officially announced the participation of Rain or Shine in the Asian Games on July 26, 2018 with the SBP declaring on the same day that the Philippine national team's withdrawal from the continental games saying that it and the national team intends "regroup, prepare for the process of appealing the FIBA Disciplinary Panel's recent decision, and aim for sustainable success in future tournaments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sarmenta |first1=Yoyo |title=SBP withdraws national basketball team from Asian Games |url=http://tv5.espn.com/basketball/story/_/id/24199532/sbp-withdraws-national-basketball-team-asian-games |accessdate=July 27, 2018 |work=ESPN 5 |date=July 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision to withdraw was reversed on August 5, 2018 due to "clamor from fans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Manglinong|first=Dan |title=Gilas Pilipinas will compete in 2018 Asian Games after clamor against withdrawal |url=http://www.interaksyon.com/gilas-pilipinas-will-compete-in-2018-asian-games-after-clamor-against-withdrawal/ |accessdate=August 10, 2018 |work=InterAksyon |date=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Jainism}}
'''''Pratikramana''''' ({{lang-sa|प्रतिक्रमण}}; also spelled ''Pratikraman'') (lit. "introspection"), is a ritual during which [[Jainism|Jains]] repent (''prayaschit'') for their sins and non-meritorious activities committed knowingly or inadvertently during their daily life through thought, speech or action. 

Pratikramana also refers to a combition of six ''avashyaks'' (essential rituals), being ''[[Samayik]]'' (state of total equanimity), ''Chauvisantho'' (honoring the 24 [[Tirthankar]]s), ''Vandana'' – (offering salutations to [[Jain monks|''sadhus'' (monks) and ''sadhvis'' (nuns)]]), ''Pratikramana'' (introspection and repentance), ''[[Kayotsarga]]'' (meditation of the soul) and ''Pratyakhyan'' (renunciation).

Although frequency of repenting varies, devout Jains often practice Pratikraman at least twice a day. It is one of the 28 primary attributes (''mūla guņa'') of both [[Śvētāmbara]] and [[Digambara]] monks.

== Etymology ==
''Pratikramana'' is the combination of two words, ''Pra'' meaning "return" and
''atikramana'' meaning "violation". Literally, it means "returning from
violations".&lt;ref&gt;http://umich.edu/~umjains/jainismsimplified/chapter18.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of ''Pratikramana''==
There are five types of ''Pratikramana'':
#Devasi
#Rayi
#Pakhi
#Chaumasi
#[[Samvatsari]]

===''Devasi Pratikramana'' ===
''Devasi Pratikramana''' is performed daily in the evening.

=== ''Rayi Pratikramana'' ===
''Rayi Pratikramana'' is performed in the early morning.

===''Pakhi Pratikramana''===
''Pakhi Pratikramana'' is done once every fifteen days. 

===''Chaumasi Pratikramana''===
''Chaumasi Pratikramana'' is done once in four months on the [[Purnima (day)|Purnima]] (full moon) of the [[Kartika (month)|Kartik]], [[Falgun]] and [[Asharh|Aṣaṛh]] months of the [[Vira Nirvana Samvat]] calendrical year for the sins committed during that period.

=== ''Samvatsari Pratikramana''===
{{Expand section|date=March 2018}}
[[Samvatsari]] Pratikraman is done once per year on the last day of [[Paryushana]] mahaparv for the [[sin]]s committed during the whole year.

Samvatsari Pratikraman includes all six things a ''[[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|Śrāvaka]]'' (householders) must do:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umich.edu/~umjains/jainismsimplified/chapter18.html |title=Jainism Simplified Chapter 18 – Pratikraman |publisher=Umich.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Jainism considers the soul, in its pure form, to have infinite perception, knowledge, and vigor, and to be non-attached. These attributes are not seen in a worldly soul because it is soiled with karmas. By following religious principles principals and activities, Jains believe they overcome karmas and promote liberation of the soul. There are various rituals, of which Pratikraman is the most important. During pratikraman, Jains repent for non-meritorious activities on a daily basis.

''Pratikraman'' must be performed twice every day, or at least once every day after sunset. If that is not possible, at least on every Pakkhi (24 times in a year).

== Sāmāyika ==
{{Main|Samayik}}
''Pratikramana'' is also done while performing the ''sāmāyika'' (periodic concentration). In performing ''sāmāyika'', the ''śrāvaka'' has to stand facing north or east and bow to the ''[[Pañca-Parameṣṭhi]]''.&lt;ref name=Householder/&gt; He then sit down and recites the [[Namokara mantra]] a certain number of times, and finally devotes himself to holy meditation. This consists in:&lt;ref name=Householder&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kLAlAQAAIAAJ | title=The Householder's Dharma: English Translation of The Ratna Karanda Sravakachara | publisher=The Central Jaina Publishing House | date=1917 | author=Jain, Champat Rai|authorlink=Champat Rai Jain|p=44–45, 61}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#''pratikramana'', recounting the sins committed and repenting for them,
#''pratyākhyanā'', resolving to avoid particular sins in future,
#''sāmāyika karma'', renunciation of personal attachments, and the cultivation of a feeling of regarding every body and thing alike,
#''stuti'', praising the four and twenty Tīrthankaras,
#''vandanā'', devotion to a particular Tīrthankaras, and
#''kāyotsarga'', withdrawal of attention from the body (physical personality) and becoming absorbed in the contemplation of the spiritual Self.

==Chauvisantho==
Chauvisantho, also called Chaturvinshatistava, means adoration of the twenty-four [[Tirthankara]]s. While reciting it, Jains show their respect for the Tirthankaras and are reminded of how victorious these [[Arihant (Jainism)|Jina]]s were, who overcame inner enemies like anger, ego, greed, deceit, etc. Chauvisantho encourages Jains to emulate [[Tirthankar]]s and strive to be like them.

==Pratyakhyan==
This is a formal renunciation of certain activities, which stops or reduces the inflow of karmas to a great extent. This activity helps us to learn to control our desires and prepares us for a much bigger renunciation.

'''Proactive policing''' is the practice of deterring criminal activity by showing police presence and engaging the public to learn their concerns, thereby preventing crime from taking place in the first place. In contrast, responding to a complaint after a crime has been committed is reactive policing.&lt;ref name=ankony1&gt;Ankony, Robert C., "The Impact of Perceived Alienation on Police Officers' Sense of Mastery and Subsequent Motivation for Proactive Enforcement." ''Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management,'' vol. 22. no. 2 (1999): 120-32.[http://www.robertankony.net/publications/impact-perceived]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2017 report by the [[National Academy of Sciences]], there is "evidence that a number of proactive policing practices are successful in reducing crime and disorder, at least in the short term, and that most of these strategies do not harm communities' attitudes toward police. However, the effects of proactive policing on other important outcomes—such as on the legality of police behavior and on racially biased behavior—are unclear because of gaps in research... Moreover, evidence on many proactive strategies is limited to near-term, localized impacts. Little is known about the strategies' long-term effects on crime or other outcomes, and about whether and to what extent they will offer crime control benefits at a larger jurisdictional level—for example, across an entire precinct or city."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/24928/proactive-policing-effects-on-crime-and-communities|title=Proactive Policing: Effects on Crime and Communities|last=Crime|first=Committee on Proactive Policing: Effects on|last2=Communities|last3=Liberties|first3=and Civil|last4=Justice|first4=Committee on Law and|last5=Education|first5=Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and|last6=Sciences|first6=National Academies of|last7=Engineering|last8=Medicine|first8=and|date=2017-11-09|isbn=9780309467100|language=en|doi=10.17226/24928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:California Highway Patrol.jpg|left|thumb|California Highway Patrol]]

Individual officers wields an enormous amount of discretion in enforcing the law (esp, non-dispatched runs like traffic enforcement or street crime). What is surprising is the public belief that police are usually eager and motivated to do their job. Thus, when a particular crime problem becomes apparent, it is often approached by monetary related arguments, such as the need for more police, equipment, training etc.; rather than by non-monetary related approaches, such as recognizing how a high perception of [[social alienation|alienation]] among police officers from the citizens of the community where they patrol reduces morale and spawns police indifference, inactivity, and apathy.&lt;ref name=ankony2&gt;Ankony, Robert C., "Community Alienation and Its Impact on Police," ''Police Chief,'' Oct. 1999: 150-53. [http://www.robertankony.net/publications/the-impact-of-community-alienation-on-police-officers]&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of alienation is especially relevant as the contemporary [[community policing]] movement emphasizes proactive law enforcement strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Bobinsky, Robert, "Reflections on Community-Oriented Policing," FBI Law Enforcement Journal Bulletin, Mar. 1994: 15-19.[https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/147475NCJRS.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mastrofski, Stephen, Robert Worden, and Jeffery Snipes, "Law Enforcement in a time of Community Policing, " ''Criminology'' (Nov. 1995):539-563.&lt;/ref&gt; Effective community policing requires that police officers work closely with local citizens in designing and implementing a variety of proactive crime prevention and control measures. To accomplish these initiatives, it is crucial that officers feel closely integrated with the majority of citizens in the community they serve. Typically, this means that officers perceive themselves as sharing important community values and beliefs and ''being confident of community support'' in the decisions they make.&lt;ref name=ankony2/&gt;

As the perception of community alienation increases among police officers, their sense of confidence or mastery in decision making will decrease, and so too their motivation for proactive enforcement. The impact of highly publicized "pro-police" verdicts of brutality incidents (i.e., Rodney King, Los Angeles 1991; Malice Green, Detroit 1992; O.J. Simpson, Los Angeles 1994; Michael Brown, Ferguson 2014; Eric Garner, New York 2014; and Freddie Gray, Baltimore 2015) are related to the level of perceived alienation experienced by police and thus their willingness to respond proactively to serious crime.&lt;ref name=ankony2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mortaz, C., "Alienation among Police Officers," Journal of Police Science and Administration, Mar. 1983: 23-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pogrebin, M, "Alienation among Veteran Police Officers," ''Police Chief,'' Feb. 1987: 38-42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The New National Crime Wave," ''Wall Street Journal'', Ms. Mac Donald, May 30, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; FBI Director James Comey and DEA chief Chuck Rosenberg suggested the "[[Ferguson effect]]" as the cause to recent spikes in crime in several large cities, especially Baltimore, Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Louis.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Kevin, "DEA chief: Comey 'spot on' linking Ferguson impact to crime surge," ''USA Today'', November 4, 2015. [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/11/04/comey-chuck-rosenberg-dea-ferguson/75160884/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentially a sociological concept developed by several classical and contemporary theorists, alienation is a condition in social relationships reflected by a low degree of integration or common values and a high degree of distance or isolation between individuals, or between an individual and a group of people in a community or work environment. Alienation is closely aligned with the concept of mastery. Mastery is typically defined as a state of mind in which an individual feels autonomous and experiences confidence in his or her ability, skill, and knowledge to control or influence external events. The greater the level of alienation an individual experiences in a community or work setting, the weaker will be their sense of mastery.&lt;ref name=ankony2/&gt;

For police officers, a strong sense of mastery is particularly vital in relation to proactive law enforcement. Proactive enforcement is usually defined as the predisposition of a police officer to be actively involved in preventing and investigating crime. Because police patrol work is highly unsupervised, most officers have considerable discretion or personal initiative regarding their level of proactive behavior on the streets. Again, it would seem logical that the stronger the level of perceived community alienation among police officers, the weaker will be their sense of mastery and motivation to engage in proactive law enforcement behavior.&lt;ref name=ankony2/&gt;

==Elements==

Proactive policing is closely related to the practice of community policing.&lt;ref&gt;Burden, O. "Community Policing," ''National Fraternal Order of Police Journal,'' Fall/Winter: 31-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Community policing's goal is "problem solving." Community policing emphasizes proactive enforcement that proposes street crime can be reduced through greater community involvement and integration between citizens and police. Community policing departments and officers must commit time to develop a "partnership" with the community to: 1) Prevent and counter crime; 2) Maintain order; and 3) Reduce the fear of crime.&lt;ref name=ankony1/&gt; Police organization is decentralized with every police officer and detective having a neighborhood to patrol with agreed upon goals and objectives to solve. Police officers must feel integrated with the majority of the citizens of the community where they patrol, and that they perceive themselves as sharing similar values and beliefs so they are confident in their decision making ability. Each police officer must get out of their cars (not just drive by and grin and wave) to visit with citizens and businesses to learn the residents concerns and show they're a friend and protector—in contrast to "strict law enforcement" or "reactive policing" which doesn't view the citizens as customers.&lt;ref name=ankony1/&gt;

==Criticisms==
Some people argue that policing should rightfully be restricted to reactive policing with a corollary that proactive policing is improper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://reason.com/archives/2013/03/27/when-proactive-policing-becomes-harassme|title=When Proactive Policing Becomes Harassment|work=Reason.com|date=2013-03-27|first=Jacob|last=Sullum}}&lt;/ref&gt; if not illegal.

&lt;!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;
'''Purposive behaviorism''' is a branch of psychology that was introduced by [[Edward Tolman]]. It combines the objective study of behavior while also considering the purpose or goal of behavior.&lt;ref name="schultz"&gt;Schultz, D.P. &amp; Schultz, S.E. (2012). ''A history of modern psychology.'' (10). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; Tolman thought that learning developed from knowledge about the environment and how the organism relates to its environment.&lt;ref name="muskingum.edu"&gt;http://www.muskingum.edu/~psych/psycweb/history/tolman.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Tolman’s goal was to identify the complex cognitive mechanisms and purposes that guided behavior.&lt;ref name="Eichenenbaum, H. 2001"&gt;Eichenenbaum, H. (2001). The hippocampus and declarative memory: Cognitive mechanisms and neural codes. ''Behavioural Brain Research 127(1)'', 199-207.&lt;/ref&gt; His theories on learning went against the traditionally accepted stimulus-response connections (see [[classical conditioning]]) at this time that were proposed by other psychologists such as [[Edward Thorndike]]. Tolman disagreed with Watson’s behaviorism, so he initiated his own behaviorism, which became known as purposive behaviorism.

Tolman's purposive behaviorism focused on meaningful behavior, or [[Behaviourism#Molecular versus molar behaviourism|molar behavior]], such as kicking a ball. This focus was in contrast to simple muscle movements aka molecular behavior such as flexing of the leg muscle. Tolman regarded the molecular behavior as fairly removed from human perceptual capacities for a meaningful analysis of behavior. This approach of Tolman’s was first introduced in his book, ''Purposive Behavior in Animals and Men'', published in 1932.&lt;ref name="schultz"/&gt; To Tolman, it was obvious that all actions of behavior are goal-oriented, including those for animals.&lt;ref name="schultz"/&gt; The main difference between behaviorism and Tolman's purposive behaviorism is that behavior is goal oriented.

== Tolman's cognitive maps, 1948 ==

=== Tolman's experiment ===
Tolman’s investigation used rats to represent clinical behaviors of men. He had the rats go through mazes. A hungry rat was put at the entrance of a maze, wandering through it until he gets to the food. In the maze, there are true segment paths and blind alleys. Trials for every rat reoccurred every 24 hours. The more trials the rats completed, the fewer errors, which he characterized by the rat avoiding the blind alleys. They made as well as taking less time to complete the maze and get to their goal which was their food.&lt;ref&gt;Tolman, E. (1948). Cognitive maps in rats and men. Psychological Review 55, 189-208.&lt;/ref&gt;

A maze was used by Tolman in the following experiment: at point A, a hungry rat was placed as the starting point; point B was where the food for the rat was placed. The rat learned to get to B for food throughout the trials.

In these experiments, Tolman was looking at how the reinforcement in the trials contributed to the rat learning their way through the maze and to the food with fewer errors.&lt;ref name="muskingum.edu"/&gt; Tolman’s evaluation of these experiments led to his theory of [[latent learning]].

=== Tolman's interpretation of the experiment ===
Tolman wondered what the rat had learned when he quickly discovered how to go through the maze to get to the food. Tolman believed that the rat had developed a cognitive map of his maze, with knowledge of where the food was located. With this research, he believed this experiment supported his notion that this learning was not rooted in stimulus-response connections but in the nervous system of sets which are to function like [[cognitive maps]]. Also, Tolman assumed that these cognitive maps vary from a narrow strip of variety to a broader, comprehensive variety. Tolman showed in his study that the rats exhibited a capability of latent learning. The results showed that the rats used [[Problem solving#Psychology)|problem solving]] because of the absence of reinforcement, which could not have been resolved by S-R representations.&lt;ref name="Eichenenbaum, H. 2001"/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Tolman’s followers, also referred to as Tolmaniacs, developed a test to further support Tolman’s findings and again refute the stimulus-response explanation of the experiment. Once a rat had learned to run from A to B, the starting point was changed from point A to point C. According to the stimulus-response theory, the rat has learned to simply move to the right in the A to B trials, so it the new starting point was C, the rat would go to D. In contrast, Tolman’s cognitive map explanation predicted the rat would return to point B even if starting at the new point, C. The new tests supported Tolman’s findings of a cognitive map, for the rat continued to reach point B.&lt;ref name="muskingum.edu"/&gt;

== Tolman's published works on purposive behaviorism ==
From 1920 to 1928, Tolman published numerous articles in the Psychological Review that attempted to objectively define such concepts as instinct, consciousness, emotions, purpose, and cognition. Tolman coined the term "purposive behaviorism" when he published "Purposive Behavior in Animals and Men" (1932), which summarized these theoretical concepts and supported them with data he obtained from numerous studies. In this publication, Tolman demonstrated that insight, or our cognitive control of learning, was not restricted by evolutionary capabilities.&lt;ref name="muskingum.edu"/&gt;

Like many other behaviorists in his time, he carried out these studies with rats, believing that "everything important in psychology can be investigated in essence through the continued experimental and theoretical analysis of the determiners of rat behavior at a choice point in a maze." In this book, he described purposive behavior as behavior directed toward some ultimate goal. Examples he gave of this kind of behavior were "a rat running a maze, a man driving home to dinner, a child hiding from a stranger, a woman gossiping over the telephone, etc." Tolman's purposive behaviorism was not as widely received in its day as other psychological theories. This was largely due to the fact that many did not consider its foundation to being in line with behaviorism at all, which was the dominating force in psychology at the time. However, the insistence on studying implicit mental concepts as opposed to looking solely at explicit behavior was an idea that opened the door to the school of cognitive psychology. While much work in purposive behaviorism was dismissed by the mainstream of psychologists in its time, many of Tolman's publications, most notably "Purposive Behavior in Animals and Men" and "Cognitive Maps in Rats and Men", continue to be cited in today's research.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11807">In [[mathematics]], a '''quiver''' is a [[directed graph]] where loops and multiple arrows between two [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] are allowed, i.e. a [[multidigraph]]. They are commonly used in [[representation theory]]: a representation&amp;nbsp;''V'' of a quiver assigns a [[vector space]]&amp;nbsp;''V''(''x'') to each vertex&amp;nbsp;''x'' of the quiver and a [[linear map]]&amp;nbsp;''V''(''a'') to each arrow&amp;nbsp;''a''.

In [[category theory]], a quiver can be understood to be the underlying structure of a [[category (mathematics)|category]], but without composition or a designation of identity morphisms.  That is, there is a [[forgetful functor]] from '''Cat''' to '''Quiv'''.  Its [[left adjoint]] is a [[free functor]] which, from a quiver, makes the corresponding [[free category]].

==Definition==

A quiver Γ consists of:
* The set ''V'' of vertices of Γ
* The set ''E'' of edges of Γ
* Two functions: ''s'': ''E'' → ''V'' giving the ''start'' or ''source'' of the edge, and another function, ''t'': ''E'' → ''V'' giving the ''target'' of the edge.

This definition is identical to that of a [[multidigraph]].

A [[morphism]] of quivers is defined as follows.  If &lt;math&gt;\Gamma=(V,E,s,t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma'=(V',E',s',t')&lt;/math&gt; are two quivers, then a morphism &lt;math&gt;m=(m_v, m_e)&lt;/math&gt; of quivers consist of two functions &lt;math&gt;m_v: V\to V'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_e: E\to E'&lt;/math&gt; such that following [[commuting diagram|diagrams commute]]:  
:&lt;math&gt;m_v \circ s = s' \circ m_e&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;m_v \circ t = t' \circ m_e&lt;/math&gt;

==Category-theoretic definition==
The above definition is based in [[set theory]]; the category-theoretic definition generalizes this into a [[functor]] from the ''free quiver''  to the [[category of sets]].

The '''free quiver''' (also called the '''walking quiver''', '''Kronecker quiver''', '''2-Kronecker quiver''' or '''Kronecker category''') ''Q'' is a category with two objects, and four morphisms: The objects are ''V'' and ''E''.  The four morphisms are ''s'': ''E'' → ''V'', ''t'': ''E'' → ''V'', and the [[identity morphism]]s id&lt;sub&gt;''V''&lt;/sub&gt;: ''V'' → ''V'' and id&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt;: ''E'' → ''E''.  That is, the free quiver is

:&lt;math&gt;E 
\;\begin{matrix}  s \\[-6pt] \rightrightarrows \\[-4pt] t \end{matrix}\; V&lt;/math&gt;

A quiver is then a [[functor]] Γ: ''Q'' → '''Set'''.

More generally, a quiver in a category ''C'' is a functor Γ: ''Q'' → ''C''.  The category '''Quiv'''(''C'') of quivers in ''C'' is the [[functor category]] where:

* objects are functors Γ: ''Q'' → ''C'',
* morphisms are [[natural transformation]]s between functors.

Note that '''Quiv''' is the [[category of presheaves]] on the [[opposite category]] ''Q''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Path algebra==
If Γ is a quiver, then a '''path''' in Γ is a sequence of arrows ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt; such that the head of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt; =&amp;nbsp;tail of&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, using the convention of concatenating paths from right to left.

If ''K'' is a [[field (mathematics)|field]] then the '''quiver algebra''' or  '''path algebra''' ''K''Γ is defined as a vector space having all the paths (of length&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0) in the quiver as basis (including, for each vertex ''i'' of the quiver Γ, a ''trivial path'' &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt; of length 0; these paths are ''not'' assumed to be equal for different ''i''), and multiplication given by concatenation of paths. If two paths cannot be concatenated because the end vertex of the first is not equal to the starting vertex of the second, their product is defined to be zero. This defines an [[associative algebra]] over ''K''. This algebra has a unit element if and only if the quiver has only finitely many vertices. In this case, the [[module (mathematics)|modules]] over ''K''Γ are naturally identified with the representations of Γ. If the quiver has infinitely many vertices, then ''K''Γ has an [[approximate identity]] given by &lt;math&gt;e_E:=\sum_{v\in E} 1_v&lt;/math&gt; where ''E'' ranges over finite subsets of the vertex set of Γ.

If the quiver has finitely many vertices and arrows, and the end vertex and starting vertex of any path are always distinct (i.e. ''Q'' has no oriented cycles), then ''K''Γ is a finite-[[dimension of a vector space|dimensional]] [[hereditary algebra]] over ''K''. Conversely, if ''K'' is algebraically closed, then any finite-dimensional, hereditary, associative algebra over ''K'' is [[Morita equivalence|Morita equivalent]] to the path algebra of its [[Ext quiver]] (i.e., they have equivalent module categories).

== Representations of quivers ==

A representation of a quiver ''Q'' is an association of an ''R''-module to each vertex of ''Q'', and a morphism between each module for each arrow.

A representation ''V'' of a quiver ''Q'' is said to be ''trivial'' if ''V''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 for all vertices ''x'' in&amp;nbsp;''Q''.

A ''morphism'', ''f'':&amp;nbsp;''V''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''V′'', between representations of the quiver ''Q'', is a collection of linear maps &lt;math&gt;f(x):V(x)\rightarrow V'(x)&lt;/math&gt; such that for every arrow ''a'' in ''Q'' from ''x'' to ''y'' &lt;math&gt;V'(a) f(x) = f(y) V(a) &lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the squares that ''f'' forms with the arrows of ''V'' and ''V′'' all commute.  A morphism, ''f'', is an ''isomorphism'', if ''f''(''x'') is invertible for all vertices ''x'' in the quiver.  With these definitions the representations of a quiver form a [[Category (mathematics)|category]].

If ''V'' and ''W'' are representations of a quiver ''Q'', then the direct sum of these representations, &lt;math&gt;V\oplus W&lt;/math&gt;, is defined by &lt;math&gt;(V\oplus W)(x)=V(x)\oplus W(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all vertices ''x'' in ''Q'' and &lt;math&gt;(V\oplus W)(a)&lt;/math&gt; is the direct sum of the linear mappings ''V''(''a'') and&amp;nbsp;''W''(''a'').

A representation is said to be ''decomposable'' if it is isomorphic to the direct sum of non-zero representations.

A [[Category theory|categorical]] definition of a quiver representation can also be given.  The quiver itself can be considered a category, where the vertices are objects and paths are morphisms.  Then a representation of ''Q'' is just a covariant [[functor]] from this category to the category of finite dimensional [[vector space]]s.  Morphisms of representations of ''Q'' are precisely [[natural transformations]] between the corresponding functors.

For a finite quiver Γ (a quiver with finitely many vertices and edges), let ''K''Γ be its path algebra.  Let ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; denote the trivial path at vertex&amp;nbsp;''i''.  Then we can associate to the vertex&amp;nbsp;''i'' the [[projective module|projective]] ''K''Γ-module ''K''Γ''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' consisting of linear combinations of paths which have starting vertex&amp;nbsp;''i''.  This corresponds to the representation of Γ obtained by putting a copy of ''K'' at each vertex which lies on a path starting at ''i'' and 0 on each other vertex.  To each edge joining two copies of ''K'' we associate the identity map.

== Quiver with relations ==
To enforce commutativity of some squares inside a quiver a generalization is the notion of quivers with relations (also named bound quivers).
A relation on a quiver &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; linear combination of paths from &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.
A quiver with relation is a pair &lt;math&gt;(Q, I)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; a quiver and &lt;math&gt;I \subseteq K\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; an
ideal of the path algebra. The quotient &lt;math&gt;K\Gamma/I&lt;/math&gt; is the path algebra of &lt;math&gt;(Q, I)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Quiver Variety===

Given the dimensions of the vector spaces assigned to every vertex, one can form a variety which characterizes all representations of that quiver with those specified dimensions, and consider stability conditions. These give quiver varieties, as constructed by {{harvtxt|King|1994}}.

== Gabriel's theorem ==

{{main|Gabriel's theorem}}
A quiver is of '''finite type''' if it has only finitely many isomorphism classes of indecomposable representations. {{harvtxt|Gabriel|1972}} classified all quivers of finite type, and also their indecomposable representations. More precisely, Gabriel's theorem states that:

# A (connected) quiver is of finite type if and only if its underlying graph (when the directions of the arrows are ignored) is one of the [[ADE classification|ADE]] [[Dynkin diagram]]s: &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;D_n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E_6&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E_7&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E_8&lt;/math&gt;.
# The indecomposable representations are in a one-to-one correspondence with the positive roots of the [[root system]] of the Dynkin diagram.

{{harvtxt|Dlab|Ringel|1973}} found a generalization of Gabriel's theorem in which all Dynkin diagrams of finite dimensional semisimple Lie algebras occur.

[[File:Sláinte Mhath .- Bonne santé.jpg|thumb|{{lang|ga|Sláinte Mhath}} — Good health — {{lang|fr|Bonne santé}}]]
{{lang|ga|Sláinte}} is the basic form in [[Irish language|Irish Gaelic]]. Variations of this toast include {{lang|ga|sláinte mhaith}} "good health" in Irish Gaelic ({{lang|ga|mhaith}} being the [[lenition#Grammatical lenition|lenited]] form of {{lang|ga|maith}} "good"). In Irish Gaelic, the response to {{lang|ga|sláinte}} is {{lang|ga|sláinte agad-sa}}, which translates "to your health as well".

The basic [[Scottish Gaelic]] equivalent is {{lang|gd|slàinte (mhath)}}, with the same meaning, to which the normal response is {{lang|gd|do dheagh shlàinte}} "your good health".&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|ga|Ó Maolalaigh, R.}} ''Scottish Gaelic in three months'' Hugo Language Books, 1996 {{ISBN|0-85285-234-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are other variations such as:
* {{lang|gd|air do shlàinte}} "on your health!" with the response {{lang|gd|slàinte agad-sa}} "health at yourself!"&lt;ref&gt;Dwelly, E. ''{{lang|gd|Faclair Gàidhlig gu Beurla le Dealbhan}} / The Illustrated [Scottish] Gaelic–English Dictionary'' 4th edition 1941&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{lang|gd|slàinte mhòr}} "great health" which is also used as a [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] toast with the alternative meaning of "health to Marion", Marion ({{lang|gd|Mòr}}) being a Jacobite code name for [[Charles Edward Stuart|Prince Charles Edward Stuart]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcal.ac.uk/politicalsong/songs/macneil5.html "Lady Traquair's Brew"] Glasgow Caledonian University: Centre for Political Song. Retrieved 9 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Manx language|Manx Gaelic]] form is {{lang|gv|slaynt (vie)}}&lt;ref&gt;Gunn, M. {{lang|gv|Da Mihi Manum}} Everson Gunn Teo., Dublin 1994 {{ISBN|1-899082-00-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; or {{lang|gv|shoh slaynt}}.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, S. ''Manx Fairy Tales'' (reprint) 2002 {{ISBN|1-873120-01-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, {{lang|gv|corp slaynt}} "healthy body" is also used in Manx.&lt;ref name="Brod"/&gt;

==Etymology==
The word is an [[abstract noun]] derived from the [[Old Irish]] [[adjective]] {{lang|sga|slán}} "whole, healthy" plus the Old Irish [[suffix]] {{lang|sga|tu}}, resulting in {{lang|sga|slántu}} "health" and eventually [[Middle Irish]] {{lang|mga|sláinte}}.&lt;ref&gt;MacBain, A. (1911) ''An Etymological Dictionary of the Gaelic Language'' [[Stirling]] Eneas MacKay, 1982 edition by Gairm {{ISBN|0-901771-68-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oftedal, M. (1956) ''The Gaelic of Leurbost''. Oslo. Norsk Tidskrift for Sprogvidenskap.&lt;/ref&gt; The root {{lang|sga|slán}} is derived from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European root]] ''*slā-'' "advantageous" and linked to words like [[German language|German]] {{lang|de|selig}} "blessed" and the [[Latin]] {{lang|la|salus}} "health".&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius Pokorny|Pokorny, J.]] {{lang|de|Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch}} Online Edition [http://www.indo-european.nl/cgi-bin/startq.cgi?flags=endnnnl&amp;root=leiden&amp;basename=\data\ie\pokorny] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210072140/http://www.indo-european.nl/cgi-bin/startq.cgi?flags=endnnnl&amp;root=leiden&amp;basename=%5Cdata%5Cie%5Cpokorny |date=2010-12-10 }} retrieved 8 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In some modern [[Romance language]]s, words descended from the Latin word {{lang|la|salus}} (such as {{lang|it|salute}} in [[Italian language|Italian]], {{lang|ca|salut}} in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]], {{lang|es|salud}} in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) are similarly used as a toast. (However, {{lang|ro|sănătate}} in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], {{lang|oc|santat}} in [[Occitan language|Occitan]] and {{lang|fr|santé}} in [[French language|French]] are rather from Latin {{lang|la|sanitas}} "health.")

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5471">{{About|changes in market dynamics and economic systems|structural change in statistical and econometric models|Structural break}}
In economics, '''structural change''' is a shift or change in the basic ways a market or economy functions or operates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/structural_change.asp|title = Structural Change Definition {{!}} Investopedia|last = root|website = Investopedia|language = en-US|access-date = 2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such change can be caused by such factors as [[economic development]], global shifts in capital and labor, changes in resource availability due to war or natural disaster or discovery or depletion of natural resources, or a change in political system. For example, a [[subsistence economy]] may be transformed into a [[manufacturing]] economy, or a regulated [[mixed economy]] may be liberalized.&lt;ref&gt;Etchemendy, Sebastian, Models of Economic Liberalization: Regime, Power and Compensation in the Iberian-American Region (2009). APSA 2009 Toronto Meeting Paper. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1449085&lt;/ref&gt; A current driver of structural change in the world economy is [[globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Margaret |last=Sharp |title=The challenge of long-term structural change |journal=Futures |volume=12 |issue=5 |year=1980 |pages=370–385 |doi=10.1016/0016-3287(80)90091-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Structural change is possible because of the dynamic nature of the [[economic system]].&lt;ref name="llp"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pasinetti |first=Luigi L. |year=1981 |title=Structural Change and Economic Growth |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-27410-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patterns and changes in sectoral employment drive demand shifts through the [[income elasticity]]. Shifting demand for both locally sourced goods and for imported products is a fundamental part of development.&lt;ref&gt;[[Allan George Barnard Fisher|Fisher, A]] (1939) Production: Primary, Secondary and Tertiary, Economic Record, June&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, C (1940) The Conditions of Economic Progress&lt;/ref&gt; The structural changes that move countries through the development process are often viewed in terms of shifts from primary, to secondary and finally, to tertiary production. Technical progress is seen as crucial in the process of structural change as it involves the [[obsolescence]] of skills, vocations, and permanent changes in spending and production resulting in [[structural unemployment]].&lt;ref name="llp" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leon, P. (1967) Structural Change and Growth in Capitalism, Johns Hopkins, Baltimore&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Historically, structural change has not always been strictly for the better. The [[division of Korea]] and the separate paths of development taken by each [[sovereign state|state]] exemplifies this. [[Korea under Japanese rule]] was relatively uniform in economic structure, but after [[World War II]], the two countries underwent drastically different structural changes due to drastically different political structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Foley |first=James A. |title=Korea's divided families: fifty years of separation |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=2003 |isbn=0-415-29738-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[South Korea]]'s economy before the 1950s mostly consisted of [[agriculture]]. During the 1960s and 1970s, Korea began to change their structure to [[IT]], [[micro systems technology]], and also [[Service (economics)|services]]. More than 50% of the world uses a [[Samsung]] smartphone, whose headquarters are located there. Today, South Korea's economy is the 15th strongest economy system.

In the [[Ruhr|Ruhr Area (Ruhrgebiet)]] in [[Germany]], the economy was mostly marked by [[coal and steel industry]]. During and after the coal crisis began in the 1960s and 1970s, this area started to change its economic structures to services, IT and [[logistics]]. The city [[Dortmund]] opened the first technology center named "Technologiepark Dortmund" in the 1980s. Companies including [[Signal Iduna]] and [[Wilo]] are based there.

Structural change can be initiated by policy decisions or permanent changes in resources, population or the society. The [[Revolutions of 1989|downfall of communism]], for example, is a political change that has had far-reaching economic implications.

==Structural changes in employment==
&lt;imagemap&gt;
Image:US employment by sectors, both genders.png|thumb|US employment by sectors, both genders [https://web.archive.org/web/20141117072912/http://www.bluenomics.com/data#!data/national_accounts_gdp/gdp_production_approach/structure_of_gross_value_added_by_sectors_gva_/structure_of_gross_value_added_by_sectors_gva_annual_of_gdp%7Cchart/line$countries=usa&amp;sorting=list//title]
&lt;/imagemap&gt;

Economic structural changes impact also on employment. A developing economy typically reveals a high share of employment in the [[primary sector]], while the share of employment in the [[tertiary sector]] is high in an advanced/developed economy.

==Testing econometric models for structural change==

Structural change tests are a type of [[econometrics|econometric]] [[Statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis test]]. They are used to verify the equality of coefficients across separate [[Replication (statistics)|subsamples]] of a [[data set]].

In [[psychology]], '''sublimation''' is a [[Defense mechanism#Level 4: Mature|mature type]] of [[defense mechanism]], in which socially unacceptable impulses or idealizations are transformed into socially acceptable actions or behavior, possibly resulting in a long-term conversion of the initial impulse.

[[Sigmund Freud]] believed that sublimation was a sign of [[Maturity (psychological)|maturity]] and [[civilization]], allowing people to function normally in culturally acceptable ways. He defined sublimation as the process of deflecting sexual instincts into acts of higher social valuation, being "an especially conspicuous feature of cultural development; it is what makes it possible for higher psychical activities, scientific, artistic or ideological, to play such an "important" part in civilized life".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, '[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]' (1930) in The Standard Edition Of ''The Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud&amp;nbsp;– The Future of an Illusion, Civilization and its Discontents, and Other Works'', trans. by James Strachey (Hogarth Press; London, 1961), vol. XXI, 79–80&lt;/ref&gt; Wade and Travis present a similar view, stating that sublimation is when [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]] "serves a higher cultural or socially useful purpose, as in the creation of art or inventions".&lt;ref&gt;Wade, Carol and Carol Travis, ''Psychology'', Sixth Edition (Prentice Hall, 2000) 478. {{ISBN|0-321-04931-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
&lt;ref&gt;Walter Arnold Kaufmann, Nietzsche: philosopher, psychologist, Antichrist, Chapter 7, section II, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; In the opening section of ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'' entitled 'Of first and last things', Nietzsche wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is, strictly speaking, neither unselfish conduct, nor a wholly disinterested point of view. Both are simply sublimations in which the basic element seems almost evaporated and betrays its presence only to the keenest observation. All that we need and that could possibly be given us in the present state of development of the sciences, is a chemistry of the moral, religious, aesthetic conceptions and feeling, as well as of those emotions which we experience in the affairs, great and small, of society and civilization, and which we are sensible of even in solitude. But what if this chemistry established the fact that, even in its domain, the most magnificent results were attained with the basest and most despised ingredients? Would many feel disposed to continue such investigations? Mankind loves to put by the questions of its origin and beginning: must one not be almost inhuman in order to follow the opposite course?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38145/38145-h/38145-h.htm|title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of Human, All Too Human, by Friedrich Nietzsche.|work=gutenberg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Psychoanalytic theory ==
In Freud's psychoanalytical theory, erotic energy is allowed a limited amount of expression, owing to the constraints of human society and civilization itself. It therefore requires other outlets, especially if an individual is to remain psychologically balanced.

Sublimation ({{lang-de|Sublimierung}}) is the process of transforming [[libido]] into "socially useful" achievements, including artistic, cultural and intellectual pursuits. Freud considered this psychical operation to be fairly salutary compared to the others that he identified, such as [[Psychological repression|repression]], [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]], [[denial]], [[reaction formation]], [[intellectualisation]], and [[Psychological projection|projection]]. In ''The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence'' (1936), his daughter, Anna, classed sublimation as one of the major 'defence mechanisms' of the psyche.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Freud, The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence (Karnac Books, 2011), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud got the idea of '''sublimation''' while reading ''[[Die Harzreise|The Harz Journey]]'' by [[Heinrich Heine]]. The story is about [[Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach]] who cut off the tails of dogs he encountered in childhood and later became a surgeon. Freud concluded that sublimation could be observed in an action performed many times throughout one's life, which firstly appears sadistic, though is ultimately refined into an activity which is of benefit to mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Geller, J.(2009). "Of Snips... and Puppy Dog Tails": Freud's Sublimation of Judentum. American Imago66(2), 169-184. The Johns Hopkins University Press. Retrieved April 6, 2012, from Project MUSE database.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interpersonal psychoanalysis ===
[[Harry Stack Sullivan]], the pioneer of [[interpersonal psychoanalysis]], defined sublimation as the unwitting substitution of a partial satisfaction with social approval for the pursuit of a direct satisfaction which would be contrary to one's ideals or to the judgment of social censors and other important people who surround one. The substitution might not be quite what we want, but it is the only way that we can get part of our satisfaction and feel secure, too. Sullivan documented that all sublimatory things are more complicated than the direct satisfaction of the needs to which they apply. They entail no disturbance of consciousness, no stopping to think why they must be done or what the expense connected with direct satisfaction would be. In successful sublimation, Sullivan observed extraordinarily efficient handling of a conflict between the need for a satisfaction and the need for security without perturbation of awareness.

== Sexual sublimation ==
'''Sexual sublimation''', also known as '''sexual transmutation''', is the act, especially among some religious traditions, to transform sexual impulses or "sexual energy" into creative energy. In this context, sublimation is the [[transference]] of sexual energy, or [[libido]], into a physical act or a different emotion in order to avoid confrontation with the sexual urge, which is itself contrary to the individual's belief or ascribed religious belief. It is based on the idea that "sexual energy" can be used to create a spiritual nature which in turn can create more sensual works, instead of one's sexuality being unleashed "raw".&lt;ref name="Sivananda1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Swami Sivananda Saraswati|authorlink=Swami Sivananda Saraswati|title=Brahmacharya (Celibacy)|url=http://www.sivanandadlshq.org/teachings/brahmacharya.htm|accessdate=2006-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Samael Aun Weor|authorlink=Samael Aun Weor|title=The Transmutation of Sexual Energy|url=http://www.gnosticteachings.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=143&amp;Itemid=43|accessdate=2006-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami|authorlink=Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami|title=Cognizantability: Section 2, The Basic Laws of Transmutation|url=http://www.himalayanacademy.com/resources/books/mws/mws_cgz_sect-02.html|accessdate=2006-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classical example in [[Western religions]] is [[clerical celibacy]].

As espoused in the [[Tanya]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Likkutei Amarim Tanya I|last=|first=R. Schneur Zalman of Liadi|publisher=Kehot|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=ch. 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hasidic]] Jewish mysticism views sublimation of the animal soul as an essential task in life, wherein the goal is to transform animalistic and earthy cravings for physical pleasure into holy desires to connect with God.

Different schools of thought describe general sexual urges as carriers of spiritual essence, and have the varied names of vital energy, vital winds ([[prana]]), spiritual energy, [[ojas]], [[shakti]], [[tummo]], or [[Kundalini energy|kundalini]]. It is also believed that undergoing sexual sublimation can facilitate a mystical awakening in an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Swami Sivananda Saraswati|authorlink=Swami Sivananda Saraswati|title=Techniques of Sex Sublimation|url=http://atmajyoti.org/sw_techniques_sex_sublimation.asp|accessdate=2006-07-27 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060717184624/http://www.atmajyoti.org/sw_techniques_sex_sublimation.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Swami Krishnananda Saraswati|url=http://www.atmajyoti.org/sw_brahmacharya_outlook_consciousness.asp|title=Brahmacharya&amp;nbsp;– An Outlook of Consciousness|accessdate=2006-07-27 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060615043338/http://atmajyoti.org/sw_brahmacharya_outlook_consciousness.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Swami Chidananda|authorlink=Swami Chidananda Saraswati|url=http://www.atmajyoti.org/sw_role_of_celibacy_in_spiritual_life.asp|title=The Role of Celibacy in the Spiritual Life|accessdate=2006-07-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041226120409/http://www.atmajyoti.org/sw_role_of_celibacy_in_spiritual_life.asp|archivedate=2004-12-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== According to Jung ==

[[C. G. Jung]] believed sublimation to be mystical in nature, thus differing fundamentally from Freud's view of the concept. For Freud, sublimation helped explain the plasticity of the sexual instincts (and their convertibility to non-sexual ends). The concept also underpinned his psychoanalytical theories, which showed the human psyche at the mercy of conflicting impulses (such as the [[super-ego]] and the [[Id, ego and super-ego|id]]). Jung criticized Freud for obscuring the alchemical origins of sublimation and for attempting instead to make the concept appear scientifically credible:

&lt;blockquote&gt; Sublimation is part of the royal art where the true gold is made. Of this Freud knows nothing; worse still, he barricades all the paths that could lead to true sublimation. This is just about the opposite of what Freud understands by sublimation. It is not a voluntary and forcible channeling of instinct into a spurious field of application, but an alchymical transformation for which fire and prima materia are needed. Sublimation is a great mystery. Freud has appropriated this concept and usurped it for the sphere of the will and the bourgeois, rationalistic ethos.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Jung, Letters, ed. By G. Adler and A. Jaffé (Princeton University Press; Princeton, 1974), vol. 1, 171,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This criticism extends from the private sphere of his correspondence (as above) to specific papers he published on psychoanalysis:

&lt;blockquote&gt; Freud invented the idea of sublimation to save us from the imaginary claws of the unconscious. But what is real, what actually exists, cannot be alchemically sublimated, and if anything is apparently sublimated it never was what a false interpretation took it to be.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, Dreams: (From Volumes 4, 8, 12, and 16 of the Collected Works of C. G. Jung), Princeton University Press (2012), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== According to Lacan ==

=== ''Das Ding'' ===

Lacan's exposition of sublimation is framed within a discussion about the relationship of psychoanalysis and ethics within the seventh book of his seminars.&lt;ref&gt;The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII.&lt;/ref&gt; Lacanian sublimation is defined with reference to the concept ''Das Ding'' (later in his career Lacan termed this ''[[objet petit a]]''); ''Das Ding'' is German for 'the thing' though Lacan conceives it as an abstract notion and one of the defining characteristics of the human condition. Broadly speaking it is the vacuum one experiences as a human being and which one endeavours to fill with differing human relationships, objects and experiences all of which serve to plug a gap in one's psychical needs. For this reason Lacan also considers ''Das Ding'' to be a non-Thing or vacuole.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 134, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; The relationships which one relies on to overcome the vacuity of ''Das Ding'' are always insufficient in wholly satisfying the individual.

Lacan considers ''Das Ding'' a lost object ever in the process of being recuperated by Man. Temporarily the individual will be duped by his or her own psyche into believing that this object, this person or this circumstance can be relied upon to satisfy his needs in a stable and enduring manner when in fact 'it is in its nature that the object as such is lost. It will never be found again. Something is there while one waits for something better, or worse, but which one wants'&lt;ref name="Jacques Lacan p. 52"&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; and again '[Das Ding] is to be found at the most as something missed. One doesn't find it, but only its pleasurable associations.'&lt;ref name="Jacques Lacan p. 52"/&gt; Human life unravels as a series of detours in the quest for the lost object or the absolute Other of the individual: 'The pleasure principle governs the search for the object and imposes detours which maintain the distance to ''Das Ding'' in relation to its end.'&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lacanian sublimation ===

Lacanian sublimation centres to a large part on the notion of ''Das Ding''. His general formula for sublimation is that 'it raises an object ... to the dignity of The Thing.&lt;ref name="Jacques Lacan p. 112"&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan considers these objects (whether human, aesthetic, credal or philosophical) to be signifiers which are representative of ''Das Ding'' and that 'the function of the pleasure principle is, in effect, to lead the subject from signifier to signifier, by generating as many signifiers as are required to maintain at as low a level as possible the tension that regulates the whole functioning of the psychic apparatus.'&lt;ref name="Jacques Lacan p. 119"&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, man is the 'artisan of his support system',&lt;ref name="Jacques Lacan p. 119"/&gt; in other words, he creates or finds the signifiers which delude him into believing he has overcome the emptiness of ''Das Ding''.

Lacan also considers sublimation to be process of creation ''ex nihilo''&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, pp. 115-127.&lt;/ref&gt; (creating out of nothing), whereby an object, human or manufactured, comes to be defined in relation to the emptiness of ''Das Ding''. Lacan's prime example of this is the courtly love of the troubadours and ''Minnesänger''&lt;ref name="Jacques Lacan p. 112"/&gt; who dedicated their poetic verse to a love-object which was not only unreachable (and therefore experienced as something missing) but whose existence and desirability also centred around a hole (the vagina&lt;ref name="Jacques Lacan p. 163"&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;). For Lacan such courtly love was 'a paradigm of sublimation'.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; He affirms that the word 'troubadour' is etymologically linked to the Provençal verb ''trobar'' (like the French ''trouver'') 'to find.'&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; If we consider again the definition of ''Das Ding'', it is dependent precisely on the expectation of the subject to re-find the lost object in the mistaken belief that it will continue to satisfy him (or her).

Lacan maintains that creation ''ex nihilo'' operates in other noteworthy fields as well. In pottery for example vases are created around an empty space.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; They are primitive and even primordial artefacts which have benefited mankind not only in the capacity of utensils but also as metaphors of (cosmic) creation ''ex nihilo''. Lacan cites Heidegger who situates the vase between the earthly (raising clay from the ground) and the ethereal (pointing upwards to receive).&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; In architecture, Lacan asserts, buildings are designed around an empty space and in art paintings proceed from an empty canvas,&lt;ref name="Jacques Lacan p. 130"&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; and often depict empty spaces through perspective.

In myth, Pan pursues the nymph Syrinx who is transformed into hollow reeds in order to avoid the clutches of the God, who subsequently cuts the reeds down in anger and transforms them into what we today call panpipes&lt;ref name="Jacques Lacan p. 163"/&gt; (both reeds and panpipes rely on their hollowness for the production of sound).

Lacan briefly remarks that religion and science are also based around emptiness. In regard to religion, Lacan refers the reader to Freud, stating that much obsessional religious behaviour can be attributed to the avoidance of the primordial emptiness of ''Das Ding'' or in the respecting of it.&lt;ref name="Jacques Lacan p. 130"/&gt; As for the discourse of science this is based on the notion of ''Verwerfung''&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; (the German word for 'dismissal') which results in the dismissing, foreclosing or exclusion of the notion of ''Das Ding'' presumably because it defies empirical categorisation.

==Empirical research==
A study by Kim, Zeppenfeld, and Cohen studied sublimation by empirical methods.&lt;ref name="kim13"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim |first1=Emily |last2=Zeppenfeld |first2=Veronika |last3=Cohen |first3=Dov|title=Sublimation, culture, and creativity.|journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|date=2013 |volume=105 |issue=4 |pages=639–666 |doi=10.1037/a0033487}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These investigators view their research, published in the ''[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]'', as providing "possibly the first experimental evidence for sublimation and [suggesting] a cultural psychological approach to defense mechanisms".&lt;ref name="kim13"/&gt;{{rp|639}}

== In fiction ==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
*One of the best known examples in Western literature is in [[Thomas Mann]]'s novella, ''[[Death in Venice]]'', where the protagonist Gustav von Aschenbach, a famous writer, sublimates his desire for an adolescent boy into writing [[poetry]].
*In [[Alberto Moravia]]'s novel, [[Io e lui (novel)|''Io e lui'' (''Him and Me'', 1971)]], the protagonist is in a constant unsuccessful quest to overcome the power of his large [[penis]], so he sublimates into a serious [[film director]].
*In ''Psychological Science: Mind, Brain and Behavior,'' by [[Michael Gazzaniga]] and [[Todd Heatherton|Todd F. Heatherton]], a more sinister example is given in which a [[sadistic personality disorder|sadist]] becomes a [[surgeon]] or a [[dentist]]. A direct example of this is in the musical and movie ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (musical)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'' characterized in the descriptively sadistic character of Orin Scrivello who follows his mother's advice to become a dentist, quoting her "You'll find a way/to make your natural tendencies pay ... Son, be a dentist/People will pay you to be inhumane."
*[[Agatha Christie]]'s novel ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' features a villain whose line of work as a judge, dealing out harsh sentences to guilty criminals, had previously permitted him to sublimate his homicidal urges.
* Sexual transmutation was quoted in [[Napoleon Hill]]'s book ''[[Think and Grow Rich]]'' (1937), and was illustrated as a principle of success.
* In the ''[[Criminal Minds]]'' episode "[[Criminal Minds (season 7)|The Bittersweet Science]]", it's mentioned that children with a violent past grow up to be police officers or soldiers, not necessarily boxers.
* In ''[[The Diamond Age]]'' by [[Neil Stephenson|Neal Stephenson]], sublimation is presented as the source of the [[Neo-Victorian|Neo-Victorians']] dominance: "...it was precisely their emotional repression that made the Victorians the richest and most powerful people in the world. Their ability to submerge their feelings, far from pathological, was rather a kind of mystical art that gave them nearly magical power over Nature and over the more intuitive tribes. Such was also the strength of the Nipponese."

In [[espionage]] and [[counterintelligence]], '''surveillance''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ər|ˈ|v|eɪ|.|ə|n|s}} or {{IPAc-en|s|ər|ˈ|v|eɪ|l|ə|n|s}})&lt;ref&gt;OED&lt;/ref&gt; is the monitoring of [[behavior]], activities, or other changing information for the purpose of influencing, managing, directing, or protecting people.&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, David. 2007. Surveillance Studies: An Overview. Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This can include observation from a distance by means of electronic equipment (such as [[closed-circuit television]] (CCTV) cameras)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/surveillance-cameras-and-crime |title=The effect of CCTV on public safety: Research roundup |authors=Leighton Walter Kille and Martin Maximino |date=11 February 2014 |work=Journalists Resource |publisher=Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center and the Carnegie-Knight Initiative |accessdate=2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; or interception of electronically transmitted information (such as [[Internet traffic]] or phone calls). It can also include simple no- or relatively low-technology methods such as [[Human intelligence (intelligence gathering)|human intelligence agent]] and [[postal interception]]. The word ''[[Wikt:surveillance|surveillance]]'' comes from a [[French language|French]] phrase for "watching over" (''sur'' means "from above" and ''veiller'' means "to watch") and is in contrast to more recent developments such as [[sousveillance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eyetap.org/papers/docs/IEEE_ISTAS13_Sensularity_Minsky_etal.pdf Minsky M, Kurzweil R, Mann S (2013). "The Society of Intelligent Veillance", ''Proceedings of the IEEE ISTAS'' 2013, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, pp&amp;nbsp;13–17]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, R. (1988). Information technology and dataveillance. Communications of the ACM, 31(5), 498–512.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2510&amp;context=infopapers Michael, K., Roussos, G., Huang, G.

Surveillance is used by governments for intelligence gathering, prevention of crime, the protection of a process, person, group or object, or the investigation of crime. It is also used by criminal organisations to plan and commit crimes, such as robbery and kidnapping, by businesses to gather intelligence, and by [[private investigator]]s.

Surveillance can be viewed as a violation of [[privacy]], and as such is often opposed by various [[civil liberties]] groups and activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/oppose-video-surveillance-our-nations-capital |title=Oppose video surveillance in our nation's capital |publisher=ACLU. org |accessdate=2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rally.stopwatching.us/ |title=Stop watching us – A rally against mass surveillance |publisher=stopwatching.us |accessdate=2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liberal democracy|Liberal democracies]] have laws which restrict domestic government and private use of surveillance, usually limiting it to circumstances where public safety is at risk. [[Authoritarian]] government seldom have any domestic restrictions, and international [[espionage]] is common among all types of countries.

The area of surveillance is increasingly a topic of academic study,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080970868640254|title=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences (Second Edition)|last=Marx|first=Gary T.|date=2015|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780080970875|editor-last=Wright|editor-first=James D.|location=Oxford|pages=733–741|doi=10.1016/b978-0-08-097086-8.64025-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; including through research centers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sscqueens.org/|title=The Surveillance Studies Centre {{!}} A multi-disciplinary &amp; international research centre at Queen's University|website=www.sscqueens.org|access-date=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; books,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/145121196|title=Surveillance studies : an overview|last=1948–|first=Lyon, David,|date=2007|publisher=Polity|isbn=9780745635927|oclc=145121196}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crcpress.com/Introduction-to-Surveillance-Studies/Petersen/p/book/9781466555099|title=Introduction to Surveillance Studies|website=CRC Press|language=en|access-date=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/883647071|title=Feminist surveillance studies|last=E.|first=Dubrofsky, Rachel|last2=Shoshana.|first2=Magnet,|isbn=9780822358923|oclc=883647071}}&lt;/ref&gt; and peer-reviewed academic journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ojs.library.queensu.ca/index.php/surveillance-and-society|title=Surveillance &amp; Society|website=ojs.library.queensu.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; "In the future, intelligence services might use the [[internet of things]] for identification, surveillance, monitoring, location tracking, and targeting for recruitment, or to gain access to networks or user credentials," Clapper said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US intelligence chief: we might use the internet of things to spy on you |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/09/internet-of-things-smart-home-devices-government-surveillance-james-clapper|website=Make a contribution News|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is far too much data on the Internet for human investigators to manually search through all of it. Therefore, automated Internet surveillance computers sift through the vast amount of intercepted Internet traffic to identify and report to human investigators the traffic that is considered interesting or suspicious. This process is regulated by targeting certain "trigger" words or phrases, visiting certain types of web sites, or communicating via email or online chat with suspicious individuals or groups.&lt;ref name="usatoday-chatroom"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/surveillance/2004-10-11-chatroom-surv_x.htm|title=Government funds chat room surveillance research|last=Hill|first=Michael|date=October 11, 2004|agency=Associated Press|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=March 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Billions of dollars per year are spent by agencies, such as the [[NSA]], the [[FBI]] and the now-defunct [[Information Awareness Office]], to develop, purchase, implement, and operate systems such as [[Carnivore (FBI)|Carnivore]], [[Narus (company)|NarusInsight]], and [[ECHELON]] to intercept and analyze all of this data to only extract the information which is useful to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.&lt;ref name="zdnet-fbi"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/news/fbi-turns-to-broad-new-wiretap-method/151059 |title=FBI turns to broad new wiretap method|last=McCullagh|first=Declan|date=January 30, 2007|work=ZDNet News|accessdate=September 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computers can be a surveillance target because of the personal data stored on them.

===Telephones===
{{Main|Phone surveillance|Lawful interception}}
The official and unofficial tapping of telephone lines is widespread. In the [[United States]] for instance, the [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act|Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act (CALEA)]] requires that all telephone and VoIP communications be available for real-time wiretapping by Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies.&lt;ref name="eff-calea-archive"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eff-calea-summary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eff-calea-faq"/&gt; Two major telecommunications companies in the U.S.—[[AT&amp;T Inc.]] and [[Verizon]]—have contracts with the FBI, requiring them to keep their phone call records easily searchable and accessible for Federal agencies, in return for $1.8 million per year.&lt;ref name="threatlevel-exigent"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/09/rogue-fbi-lette.html#previouspost|title=Rogue FBI Letters Hint at Phone Companies' Own Data Mining Programs – Updated|last=Singel|first=Ryan|date=September 10, 2007|work=Threat Level|publisher=Wired|accessdate=March 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2003 and 2005, the FBI sent out more than 140,000 "[[National Security Letter]]s" ordering phone companies to hand over information about their customers' calling and Internet histories. About half of these letters requested information on U.S. citizens.&lt;ref name="fbi-national-letters"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aBd9Zzld22w0&amp;refer=home|title=Mueller Orders Audit of 56 FBI Offices for Secret Subpoenas |last=Roland|first=Neil|date=March 20, 2007|work=Bloomberg News|accessdate=March 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human agents are not required to monitor most calls. [[Speech-to-text]] software creates machine-readable text from intercepted audio, which is then processed by automated call-analysis programs, such as those developed by agencies such as the [[Information Awareness Office]], or companies such as [[Verint]], and [[Narus (company)|Narus]], which search for certain words or phrases, to decide whether to dedicate a human agent to the call.&lt;ref name="latimes-fbi-intel-analysis"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jul/29/nation/na-technology29|title=FBI Plans to Fight Terror With High-Tech Arsenal|last=Piller|first=Charles|author2=Eric Lichtblau |date=July 29, 2002|work=LA Times|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law enforcement and intelligence services in the United Kingdom and the United States possess technology to activate the microphones in cell phones remotely, by accessing phones' diagnostic or maintenance features in order to listen to conversations that take place near the person who holds the phone.&lt;ref name="schneier-roving-bugs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/12/remotely_eavesd_1.html|title=Remotely Eavesdropping on Cell Phone Microphones|last=Schneier|first=Bruce|date=December 5, 2006|work=Schneier On Security|accessdate=December 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="roving-bugs"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/FBI-taps-cell-phone-mic-as-eavesdropping-tool/2100-1029_3-6140191.html |title=FBI taps cell phone mic as eavesdropping tool |last=McCullagh |first=Declan |author2=Anne Broache |date=December 1, 2006 |work=CNet News |accessdate=March 14, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110182623/http://news.cnet.com/FBI-taps-cell-phone-mic-as-eavesdropping-tool/2100-1029_3-6140191.html |archivedate=November 10, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uk-mobile-bug"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.ft.com/cms/s/7166b8a2-02cb-11da-84e5-00000e2511c8.html|title=Use of mobile helped police keep tabs on suspect |last=Odell|first=Mark|date=August 1, 2005|work=Financial Times|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="noaa-phone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrc.noaa.gov/wrso/security_guide/telephon.htm|title=Telephones|year=2001|work=Western Regional Security Office (NOAA official site)|accessdate=March 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="can-you-hear-me"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2006/12/can_you_hear_me.html |title=Can You Hear Me Now? |work=ABC News: The Blotter |accessdate=December 13, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825102123/http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2006/12/can_you_hear_me.html |archivedate=August 25, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seattle-times-roving"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003474824_bugs130.html|title=Even if they're off, cellphones allow FBI to listen in|last=Coughlin|first=Kevin|date=December 13, 2006|work=The Seattle Times|accessdate=December 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Stingray phone tracker|StingRay]] tracker is an example of one of these tools used to monitor cell phone usage in the United States and the United Kingdom. Originally developed for counterterrorism purposes by the military, they work by broadcasting powerful signals that cause nearby cell phones to transmit their [[Mobile identification number|IMSI number]], just as they would to normal cell phone towers. Once the phone is connected to the device, there is no way for the user to know that they are being tracked. The operator of the stingray is able to extract information such as location, phone calls, and text messages, but it is widely believed that the capabilities of the StingRay extend much further. A lot of controversy surrounds the StingRay because of its powerful capabilities and the secrecy that surrounds it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hampton|first=Brittany|year=2012|title=From Smartphones to Stingrays: Can the Fourth Amendment Keep up with the Twenty-First Century Note|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/branlaj51&amp;amp;div=8&amp;amp;g_sent=1&amp;amp;collection=journals|journal=University of Louisville Law Review|volume=Fifty One|pages=159–176|via=Law Journal Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobile phones are also commonly used to collect location data. The geographical location of a mobile phone (and thus the person carrying it) can be determined easily even when the phone is not being used, using a technique known as [[multilateration]] to calculate the differences in time for a signal to travel from the cell phone to each of several [[cell towers]] near the owner of the phone.&lt;ref name="bbc-phone-locate"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4738219.stm|title=Tracking a suspect by mobile phone|date=August 3, 2005|work=BBC News|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="foxnews-phone-locate"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,509211,00.html|title=Cell Phone Tracking Can Locate Terrorists – But Only Where It's Legal|last=Miller|first=Joshua|date=March 14, 2009|work=FOX News|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legality of such techniques has been questioned in the United States, in particular whether a court warrant is required.&lt;ref name="nyu-lawrev"&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=1092293|title=Warrantless Location Tracking|year=2008|work=N.Y.U.

The phone encrypts e-mails, contacts, and photos with a code generated by a complex mathematical algorithm that is unique to an individual phone, and is inaccessible to Apple.&lt;ref name="new-iphone-locks-out-nsa"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/27/technology/iphone-locks-out-the-nsa-signaling-a-post-snowden-era-.html?r=0=home|title=Signaling Post-Snowden Era, New iPhone Locks Out N.S.A|last=Sanger|first=David|date=Sep 26, 2014|work=New York Times|accessdate=November 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[encryption]] feature on the iPhone 6 has drawn criticism from FBI director James B. Comey and other law enforcement officials since even lawful requests to access user content on the iPhone 6 will result in Apple supplying "gibberish" data that requires law enforcement personnel to either break the code themselves or to get the code from the phone's owner.&lt;ref name="new-iphone-locks-out-nsa" /&gt; Because the Snowden leaks demonstrated that American agencies can access phones anywhere in the world, privacy concerns in countries with growing markets for smart phones have intensified, providing a strong incentive for companies like [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] to address those concerns in order to secure their position in the global market.&lt;ref name="new-iphone-locks-out-nsa" /&gt;

Although the [[Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act|CALEA]] requires [[telecommunication]] companies to build into their systems the ability to carry out a lawful wiretap, the law has not been updated to address the issue of smart phones and requests for access to [[e-mails]] and [[metadata]].&lt;ref name="nsa-tracking-cellphone-locations"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-tracking-cellphone-locations-worldwide-snowden-documents-show/2013/12/04/5492873a-5cf2-11e3-bc56-c6ca94801fac_story.html?r=0=home|title=NSA tracking cellphone locations worldwide, Snowden documents show|last=Gellman|first=Barton|date=Dec 4, 2013|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=November 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Snowden leaks show that the [[NSA]] has been taking advantage of this ambiguity in the law by collecting metadata on "at least hundreds of millions" of "incidental" targets from around the world.&lt;ref name="nsa-tracking-cellphone-locations"/&gt; The NSA uses an analytic tool known as CO-TRAVELER in order to track people whose movements intersect and to find any hidden connections with persons of interest.&lt;ref name="nsa-tracking-cellphone-locations"/&gt;

The Snowden leaks have also revealed that the British [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ) can access information collected by the NSA on American citizens. Once the data has been collected, the GCHQ can hold on to it for up to two years. The deadline can be extended with the permission of a "senior UK official".&lt;ref name="british-spies-can-go-through-americans-calls"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2812728/British-spies-American-s-telephone-calls-emails-without-warrant-reveals-legal-challenge-UK.html?r=0=home|title=British spies can go through Americans' telephone calls and emails without warrant revelas legal challenge in the UK |last=Nye|first=James|date=Oct 26, 2014|work=Mail Online|accessdate=November 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cameras===
{{Main|Closed-circuit television}}
[[File:Cairns-Lagoon.JPG|thumb|right|A surveillance camera in [[Cairns, Queensland]]]]
[[File:Three Surveillance cameras.jpg|thumb|right|Surveillance cameras such as these are installed by the millions in many countries, and are nowadays monitored by automated computer programs instead of humans.]]
Surveillance cameras are video cameras used for the purpose of observing an area. They are often connected to a recording device or [[IP network]], and may be watched by a [[security guard]] or [[law enforcement officer]]. Cameras and recording equipment used to be relatively expensive and required human personnel to monitor camera footage, but analysis of footage has been made easier by automated software that organizes digital video footage into a searchable [[database]], and by video analysis software (such as [[VIRAT]] and [[Human Identification at a Distance|HumanID]]). The amount of footage is also drastically reduced by motion sensors which only record when motion is detected. With cheaper production techniques, surveillance cameras are simple and inexpensive enough to be used in home security systems, and for everyday surveillance.

There are about 350 million surveillance cameras worldwide as of 2016. About 65% of these cameras are installed in Asia. The growth of CCTV has been slowing in recent years.&lt;ref name="SDM2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdmmag.com/articles/92407-rise-of-surveillance-camera-installed-base-slows|title=Rise of Surveillance Camera Installed Base Slows|date=5 May 2016|accessdate=5 January 2017|publishersdm magazine=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, China was reported to have a huge surveillance network of over 170 million CCTV cameras with 400 million new cameras expected to be installed in the next three years, many of which use [[Facial recognition system|facial recognition technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-43751276|title=Smart cameras catch man in 60,000 crowd|date=2018-04-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], the [[Department of Homeland Security]] awards billions of dollars per year in [[Homeland Security grants]] for local, state, and federal agencies to install modern video surveillance equipment. For example, the city of [[Chicago]], Illinois, recently used a $5.1 million Homeland Security grant to install an additional 250 surveillance cameras, and connect them to a centralized monitoring center, along with its preexisting network of over 2000 cameras, in a program known as [[Operation Virtual Shield]]. Speaking in 2009, Chicago Mayor [[Richard M. Daley|Richard Daley]] announced that Chicago would have a surveillance camera on every street corner by the year 2016.&lt;ref name="sun-times"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/politics/1440402,|title=Surveillance cams help fight crime, city says|last=Spielman|first=Fran|date=February 19, 2009|work=Chicago Sun Times|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="were-watching"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/09/05/five_years/main1968121.shtml|title=We're Watching: How Chicago Authorities Keep An Eye On The City|last=Schorn|first=Daniel|date=September 6, 2006|work=CBS News|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], the vast majority of video surveillance cameras are not operated by government bodies, but by private individuals or companies, especially to monitor the interiors of shops and businesses. According to 2011 [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] requests, the total number of local government operated CCTV cameras was around 52,000 over the entirety of the UK.&lt;ref name=BBW2012&gt;{{cite web|title=The Price of Privacy: How local authorities spent £515m on CCTV in four years|url=http://www.bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/files/priceofprivacy/Price_of_privacy_2012.pdf|publisher=Big Brother Watch|accessdate=4 February 2015|date=February 2012|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of video surveillance in the UK is often overstated due to unreliable estimates being requoted;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/society/factcheck+how+many+cctv+cameras/2291167|title=FactCheck: how many CCTV cameras?|publisher=Channel 4 News|date=18 June 2008|accessdate=8 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian2011&gt;{{cite news|title=You're being watched: there's one CCTV camera for every 32 people in UK – Research shows 1.85m machines across Britain, most of them indoors and privately operated|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/02/cctv-cameras-watching-surveillance|accessdate=7 January 2017|work=The Guardian|date=2 March 2011|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|title=In the press: How the media is reporting the 1.85 million cameras story|url=http://www.securitynewsdesk.com/in-the-press-how-the-media-is-reporting-the-1-85-million-cameras-story/|accessdate=7 January 2017|work=Security News Desk|date=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example one report in 2002 extrapolated from a very small sample to estimate the number of cameras in the UK at 4.2 million (of which 500,000 in [[London|Greater London]]{{refn|group=Note|Furthermore, the figure of 500,000 for Greater London is often confused with the figure for the local government and police operated cameras in the [[City of London]], which was about 650 in 2011.&lt;ref name=BBW2012 /&gt;}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbaneye.net/results/ue_wp6.pdf|title=CCTV in London|accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; More reliable estimates put the number of private and local government operated cameras in the United Kingdom at around 1.85 million in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cctvusergroup.com/art.php?art=94|title=How many cameras are there?|publisher=CCTV User Group|date=18 June 2008|accessdate=8 May 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023191646/http://www.cctvusergroup.com/art.php?art=94|archive-date=October 23, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Netherlands, one example city where there are cameras is The Hague. There, cameras are placed in city districts in which the most illegal activity is concentrated. Examples are the [[red-light district]]s and the train stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denhaag.nl/en/residents/relocation-and-settling/to/Camera-surveillance.htm|title=Camera surveillance|first=Den|last=Haag|date=|publisher=|accessdate=December 2, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008030841/http://www.denhaag.nl/en/residents/relocation-and-settling/to/Camera-surveillance.htm|archivedate=October 8, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of China's [[Golden Shield Project]], several U.S. corporations, including [[IBM]], [[General Electric]], and [[Honeywell]], have been working closely with the [[Politics of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] to install millions of surveillance cameras throughout [[People's Republic of China|China]], along with advanced [[video analytics]] and facial recognition software, which will identify and track individuals everywhere they go. They will be connected to a centralized database and monitoring station, which will, upon completion of the project, contain a picture of the face of every person in China: over 1.3 billion people.&lt;ref name="rollingstone-china"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/20797485/chinas_allseeing_eye/print|title=China's All-Seeing Eye|last=Klein|first=Naomi|date=May 29, 2008|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=March 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lin Jiang Huai, the head of China's "Information Security Technology" office (which is in charge of the project), credits the surveillance systems in the United States and the U.K. as the inspiration for what he is doing with the Golden Shield Project.&lt;ref name="rollingstone-china"/&gt;

[[File:DSTAMP Controp Camera.jpg|thumb|left|A payload surveillance camera manufactured by Controp and distributed to the U.S. government by ADI Technologies]]
The [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) is funding a research project called [[Combat Zones That See]] that will link up cameras across a city to a centralized monitoring station, identify and track individuals and vehicles as they move through the city, and report "suspicious" activity (such as waving arms, looking side-to-side, standing in a group, etc.).&lt;ref name="wired-cts"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/big-brother-to-see-all-everywhere/ |title=Big Brother To See All, Everywhere |date=July 1, 2003|agency=Associated Press|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=September 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, Washington, D.C. had 5,000 "traffic" cameras installed under this premise, and then after they were all in place, networked them all together and then granted access to the Metropolitan Police Department, so they could perform "day-to-day monitoring".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/trapwire-everything-you-need-to-know-2012-8|title=WIKILEAKS: Surveillance Cameras Around The Country Are Being Used In A Huge Spy Network|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One common form of surveillance is to create maps of [[Social network analysis|social networks]] based on data from [[social networking sites]] such as [[Facebook]], [[MySpace]], [[Twitter]] as well as from [[traffic analysis]] information from phone call records such as those in the [[NSA call database]],&lt;ref name="keefe"&gt;{{cite news|title= Can Network Theory Thwart Terrorists?|last=Keefe|first=Patrick |date=March 12, 2006|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

Many U.S. government agencies such as the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA), the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), and the [[Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) are investing heavily in research involving social network analysis.&lt;ref name="pentagon-social-networks"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19025556.200?DCMP=NLC-nletter&amp;nsref=mg19025556.200|title=Pentagon sets its sights on social networking websites |last=Marks|first=Paul|date=June 9, 2006|work=New Scientist|accessdate=March 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nsa-myspace"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-6082047-7.html|title=Is the NSA reading your MySpace profile?|last=Kawamoto|first=Dawn|date=June 9, 2006|work=CNET News|accessdate=March 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intelligence community believes that the biggest threat to U.S. power comes from decentralized, leaderless, geographically dispersed groups of [[terrorists]], [[subversives]], [[extremists]], and [[dissidents]].

Jason Ethier of Northeastern University, in his study of modern social network analysis, said the following of the Scalable Social Network Analysis Program developed by the [[Information Awareness Office]]:

{{quote|The purpose of the SSNA algorithms program is to extend techniques of social network analysis to assist with distinguishing potential terrorist cells from legitimate groups of people....

AT&amp;T developed a programming language called "Hancock", which is able to sift through enormous databases of phone call and Internet traffic records, such as the [[NSA call database]], and extract "communities of interest"—groups of people who call each other regularly, or groups that regularly visit certain sites on the Internet. AT&amp;T originally built the system to develop "marketing leads",&lt;ref name="hancock"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/10/att-invents-pro.html|title=AT&amp;T Invents Programming Language for Mass Surveillance|last=Singel|first=Ryan|date=October 29, 2007|work=Threat Level|publisher=Wired|accessdate=March 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the FBI has regularly requested such information from phone companies such as AT&amp;T without a warrant,&lt;ref name="hancock"/&gt; and, after using the data, stores all information received in its own databases, regardless of whether or not the information was ever useful in an investigation.&lt;ref name="threatlevel-fbi-phonerecords"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/10/legally-questio.html#previouspost|title=Legally Questionable FBI Requests for Calling Circle Info More Widespread than Previously Known|last=Singel|first=Ryan|date=October 16, 2007|work=Threat Level|publisher=Wired|accessdate=March 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people believe that the use of social networking sites is a form of "participatory surveillance", where users of these sites are essentially performing surveillance on themselves, putting detailed personal information on public websites where it can be viewed by corporations and governments.&lt;ref name="part-surv"/&gt; In 2008, about 20% of employers reported using social networking sites to collect personal data on prospective or current employees.&lt;ref name="havenstein"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9114560|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923065244/http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9114560|dead-url=yes|archive-date=September 23, 2008|title=One in five employers uses social networks in hiring process|last=Havenstein|first=Heather|date=September 12, 2008|work=Computer World|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biometric===
[[File:US-VISIT (CBP).jpg|thumb|right|Fingerprints being scanned as part of the [[US-VISIT]] program]]
{{Main|Biometrics}}

Biometric surveillance is a technology that measures and analyzes human physical and/or behavioral characteristics for authentication, identification, or screening purposes.&lt;ref name="rand-facial"&gt;{{cite book|last=Woodward|first=John|author2=Christopher Horn |author3=Julius Gatune |author4=Aryn Thomas |title=Biometrics: A Look at Facial Recognition |publisher=RAND Corporation|year=2003|isbn=0-8330-3302-6|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA414520 |accessdate=March 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of physical characteristics include fingerprints, DNA, and facial patterns. Examples of mostly behavioral characteristics include gait (a person's manner of walking) or voice.

[[Facial recognition system|Facial recognition]] is the use of the unique configuration of a person's facial features to accurately identify them, usually from surveillance video. Both the Department of Homeland Security and [[DARPA]] are heavily funding research into facial recognition systems.&lt;ref name="usatoday-facial"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-05-10-facial-recognition-terrorism_N.htm|title=Face recognition next in terror fight|last=Frank|first=Thomas|date=May 10, 2007|work=USA Today|accessdate=March 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Information Processing Technology Office]] ran a program known as [[Human Identification at a Distance]] which developed technologies that are capable of identifying a person at up to {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on}} by their facial features.

Another form of behavioral biometrics, based on [[affective computing]], involves computers recognizing a person's emotional state based on an analysis of their facial expressions, how fast they are talking, the tone and pitch of their voice, their posture, and other behavioral traits. This might be used for instance to see if a person's behavior is suspect (looking around furtively, "tense" or "angry" facial expressions, waving arms, etc.).&lt;ref name="pop-mech-cameras"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/military_law/4236865.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219164859/http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/military_law/4236865.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-12-19|title=Surveillance Society: New High-Tech Cameras Are Watching You|last=Vlahos|first=James|date=January 2008|work=Popular Mechanics|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent development is [[DNA profiling]], which looks at some of the major markers in the body's DNA to produce a match.

===Aerial{{anchor|Aerial surveillance}}===
{{Further|Surveillance aircraft}}
[[File:MicroAirVehicle.jpg|thumb|right|Micro Air Vehicle with attached surveillance camera]]

Aerial surveillance is the gathering of surveillance, usually visual imagery or video, from an airborne vehicle—such as an [[unmanned aerial vehicle]], [[helicopter]], or [[surveillance aircraft|spy plane]]. Military [[surveillance aircraft]] use a range of sensors (e.g. radar) to monitor the battlefield.

Digital imaging technology, miniaturized computers, and numerous other technological advances over the past decade have contributed to rapid advances in aerial surveillance hardware such as [[micro-aerial vehicles]], [[forward-looking infrared]], and high-resolution imagery capable of identifying objects at extremely long distances. For instance, the [[MQ-9 Reaper]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.military.com/equipment/mq-9-reaper|title=MQ-9 Reaper|last=Boyd|first=Ryan|language=en|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; a U.S. drone plane used for domestic operations by the [[Department of Homeland Security]], carries cameras that are capable of identifying an object the size of a milk carton from altitudes of 60,000 feet, and has [[forward-looking infrared]] devices that can detect the heat from a human body at distances of up to 60 kilometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/the-rapid-rise-of-federal-surveillance-drones-over-america/473136/|title=The Rapid Rise of Federal Surveillance Drones Over America|last=Friedersdorf|first=Conor|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an earlier instance of commercial aerial surveillance, the [[Killington Mountain]] ski resort hired 'eye in the sky' aerial photography of its competitors' parking lots to judge the success of its marketing initiatives as it developed starting in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Bruce, [http://www.vermonttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/RH/20121109/BUSINESS03/711099916 "Killington co-founder Sargent dead at 83"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904091030/http://www.vermonttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2FRH%2F20121109%2FBUSINESS03%2F711099916 |date=September 4, 2015 }}, Rutland ''Herald'', November 9, 2012.

The [[United Kingdom]], as well, is working on plans to build up a fleet of surveillance UAVs ranging from [[micro-aerial vehicles]] to full-size [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]], to be used by police forces throughout the U.K.&lt;ref name="uk-uav-fleet"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/07/17/215507/uk-home-office-plans-national-police-uav-fleet.html|title=UK Home Office plans national police UAV fleet |last=La Franchi|first=Peter|date=July 17, 2007|work=Flight International|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to their surveillance capabilities, MAVs are capable of carrying [[taser]]s for "[[crowd control]]", or weapons for killing enemy combatants.&lt;ref name="uav-tazers"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.policeone.com/police-products/less-lethal/articles/99337-No-Longer-Science-Fiction-Less-Than-Lethal-Directed-Energy-Weapons/|title=No Longer Science Fiction: Less Than Lethal &amp; Directed Energy Weapons|date=February 22, 2005|work=International Online Defense Magazine|accessdate=March 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Programs such as the [[Heterogeneous Aerial Reconnaissance Team]] program developed by [[DARPA]] have automated much of the aerial surveillance process. They have developed systems consisting of large teams drone planes that pilot themselves, automatically decide who is "suspicious" and how to go about monitoring them, coordinate their activities with other drones nearby, and notify human operators if something suspicious is occurring. This greatly increases the amount of area that can be continuously monitored, while reducing the number of human operators required. Thus a swarm of automated, self-directing drones can automatically patrol a city and track suspicious individuals, reporting their activities back to a centralized monitoring station.&lt;ref name="hart-overview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/programs/hart/docs/HART_Overview.pdf|title=HART Overview|date=August 2008|work=IPTO (DARPA) – Official website|accessdate=March 15, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205233843/http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/programs/hart/docs/HART_Overview.pdf|archivedate=December 5, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hart-proposal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/solicit/baa/BAA-04-05_PIP.pdf |title=BAA 04-05-PIP: Heterogeneous Airborne Reconnaissance Team (HART) |date=December 5, 2003 |work=Information Processing Technology Office (DARPA) – Official Website |accessdate=March 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081127074930/http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/solicit/baa/BAA-04-05_PIP.pdf |archivedate=November 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="defense-daily"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6712/is_40_236/ai_n29399227 |title=DARPA, Northrop Grumman Move Into Next Phase of UAV Control Architecture |last=Sirak |first=Michael |date=Nov 29, 2007 |work=Defense Daily |accessdate=March 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309060941/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6712/is_40_236/ai_n29399227/ |archivedate=March 9, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data mining and profiling===
[[Data mining]] is the application of statistical techniques and programmatic algorithms to discover previously unnoticed relationships within the data. [[Data profiling]] in this context is the process of assembling information about a particular individual or group in order to generate a profile&amp;nbsp;— that is, a picture of their patterns and behavior. Data profiling can be an extremely powerful tool for psychological and [[social network analysis]]. A skilled analyst can discover facts about a person that they might not even be consciously aware of themselves.&lt;ref name="profiling-euro"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink1=Mireille Hildebrandt|last=Hildebrandt|first=Mireille|author2=Serge Gutwirth |title=Profiling the European Citizen: Cross Disciplinary Perspectives|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4020-6913-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic (such as credit card purchases) and social (such as telephone calls and emails) transactions in modern society create large amounts of stored [[data]] and records. In the past, this data was documented in paper records, leaving a "[[paper trail]]", or was simply not documented at all. Correlation of paper-based records was a laborious process—it required human intelligence operators to manually dig through documents, which was time-consuming and incomplete, at best.

But today many of these records are electronic, resulting in an "[[Digital footprint|electronic trail]]". Every use of a bank machine, payment by credit card, use of a phone card, call from home, checked out library book, rented video, or otherwise complete recorded transaction generates an electronic record. Public records—such as birth, court, tax and other records—are increasily being digitized and made available online. In addition, due to laws like [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act|CALEA]], web traffic and online purchases are also available for profiling. Electronic record-keeping makes data easily collectable, storable, and accessible—so that high-volume, efficient aggregation and analysis is possible at significantly lower costs.

Information relating to many of these individual transactions is often easily available because it is generally not guarded in isolation, since the information, such as the title of a movie a person has rented, might not seem sensitive. However, when many such transactions are [[government databases|aggregated]] they can be used to assemble a detailed profile revealing the actions, habits, beliefs, locations frequented, [[social network analysis|social connections]], and preferences of the individual. This profile is then used, by programs such as [[ADVISE]]&lt;ref name="data-sweep"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0209/p01s02-uspo.html|title=US Plans Massive Data Sweep|last=Clayton|first=Mark|date=February 9, 2006|work=Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[TALON (database)|TALON]], to determine whether the person is a military, criminal, or political threat.

In addition to its own aggregation and profiling tools, the government is able to access information from third parties&amp;nbsp;— for example, banks, credit companies or employers, etc.&amp;nbsp;— by requesting access informally, by compelling access through the use of subpoenas or other procedures,&lt;ref name="cdt-fbi-subpoenas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdt.org/security/usapatriot/030924cdt.shtml |title=Administrative Subpoenas for the FBI: A Grab for Unchecked Executive Power |last=Flint |first=Lara |date=September 24, 2003 |work=The Center For Democracy &amp; Technology (official site) |accessdate=March 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308183232/http://cdt.org/security/usapatriot/030924cdt.shtml |archivedate=March 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or by purchasing data from commercial data aggregators or data brokers. The United States has spent $370 million on its 43 planned [[fusion centers]], which are national network of surveillance centers that are located in over 30 states. The centers will collect and analyze vast amounts of data on U.S. citizens. It will get this data by consolidating personal information from sources such as state driver's licensing agencies, hospital records, criminal records, school records, credit bureaus, banks, etc. – and placing this information in a centralized database that can be accessed from all of the centers, as well as other federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies.&lt;ref name="epic-fusion-centers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epic.org/privacy/surveillance/spotlight/0607/default.html|title="National Network" of Fusion Centers Raises Specter of COINTELPRO|date=June 2007|work= EPIC Spotlight on Surveillance|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under ''[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=425&amp;invol=435 United States v. Miller]'' (1976), data held by third parties is generally not subject to [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] warrant requirements.

===Corporate===
Corporate surveillance is the monitoring of a person or group's behavior by a corporation. The data collected is most often used for marketing purposes or sold to other corporations, but is also regularly shared with government agencies. It can be used as a form of [[business intelligence]], which enables the corporation to better tailor their products and/or services to be desirable by their customers. Although there is a common belief that monitoring can increase productivity, it can also create consequences such as increasing chances of deviant behavior and creating punishments that are not equitable to their actions. Additionally, monitoring can cause resistance and backlash because it insinuates an employer’s suspicion and lack of trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anthony|first=Denise|date=2017|title="Toward a Sociology of Privacy"|url=|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=43(1)|pages=249-269|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Business Intelligence====
Data collected on individuals and groups can be sold to other corporations, so that they can use it for the aforementioned purpose. It can be used for [[direct marketing]] purposes, such as targeted advertisements on Google and Yahoo. These ads are tailored to the individual user of the search engine by analyzing their search history and emails&lt;ref name="nytimes-onlineads"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/01/technology/01Privacy.html?_r=1|title=F.T.C. to Review Online Ads and Privacy|last=Story|first=Louise|date=November 1, 2007|work=New York Times|accessdate=March 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (if they use free webmail services), which is kept in a database.&lt;ref name="surv-in-society"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestarphoenix.com/Technology/Surveillance+society/1322333/story.html|title=Surveillance in society|last=Butler|first=Don|date=February 24, 2009|work=The Star Phoenix|publisher=CanWest|accessdate=March 17, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, [[Google]], the world's most popular search engine, stores identifying information for each web search. An [[IP address]] and the search phrase used are stored in a database for up to 18 months.&lt;ref name="cnet-googlelogs"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13739_3-10038963-46.html|title=Debunking Google's log anonymization propaganda|last=Soghoian|first=Chris|date=September 11, 2008|work=CNET News|accessdate=March 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google also scans the content of emails of users of its Gmail webmail service, in order to create targeted advertising based on what people are talking about in their personal email correspondences.&lt;ref name="joshi"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/every-move-you-make-google-will-be-watching-you/57071/on|title= Every move you make, Google will be watching you|last=Joshi|first=Priyanki|date=March 21, 2009|work=Business Standard|accessdate=March 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google is, by far, the largest Internet advertising agency. Their revenue model is based on receiving payments from advertisers for each page-visit resulting from a visitor clicking on a Google [[AdWords]] ad, hosted either on a Google service or a third-party website. Millions of sites place Google's advertising banners and links on their websites, in order to share this profit from visitors who click on the ads. Each page containing Google advertisements adds, reads, and modifies [[HTTP cookie|"cookies"]] on each visitor's computer.&lt;ref name="google-adprivacy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html|title=Advertising and Privacy|year=2009|work=Google (company page)|accessdate=March 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cookies track the user across all of these sites, and gather information about their web surfing habits, keeping track of which sites they visit, and what they do when they are on these sites. This information, along with the information from their email accounts, and search engine histories, is stored by Google to use for building a profile of the user to deliver better-targeted advertising.&lt;ref name="joshi"/&gt;

====Intra-Corporate Surveillance====
According to the [[American Management Association]] and the ePolicy Institute that undertake an annual quantitative survey about electronic monitoring and surveillance with approximately 300 U.S. companies, "more than one fourth of employers have fired workers for misusing e-mail and nearly one third have fired employees for misusing the Internet".&lt;ref name="stacy"&gt;American Management Association and the ePolicy Institute (2008). [http://press.amanet.org/press-releases/177/2007-electronic-monitoring-surveillance-survey Electronic Monitoring and Surveillance 2007 Survey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801095437/http://press.amanet.org/press-releases/177/2007-electronic-monitoring-surveillance-survey/ |date=August 1, 2012 }}. Retrieved July 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 40% of the companies monitor e-mail traffic of their workers, and 66% of corporations monitor Internet connections. In addition, most companies use software to block non-work related websites such as sexual or pornographic sites, game sites, social networking sites, entertainment sites, shopping sites, and sport sites. The American Management Association and the ePolicy Institute also stress that companies "tracking content, keystrokes, and time spent at the keyboard ... store and review computer files ... monitor the blogosphere to see what is being written about the company, and ... monitor social networking sites".&lt;ref name="stacy"/&gt; Furthermore, about 30% of the companies had also fired employees for non-work related email and Internet usage such as "inappropriate or offensive language" and "viewing, downloading, or uploading inappropriate/offensive content".&lt;ref name="stacy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allmer, Thomas (2012). Towards a Critical Theory of Surveillance in Informational Capitalism. Frankfurt am Main: Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Government Use of Corporate Surveillance Data====
The United States government often gains access to these databases, either by producing a warrant for it, or by simply asking. The [[Department of Homeland Security]] has openly stated that it uses data collected from consumer credit and direct marketing agencies—such as Google—for augmenting the profiles of individuals whom it is monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nation.time.com/2013/08/01/the-surveillance-society/|title=The Surveillance Society|last=Drehle|first=David Von|newspaper=Time|issn=0040-781X|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI, Department of Homeland Security, and other intelligence agencies have formed an "information-sharing" partnership with over 34,000 corporations as part of their [[Infragard]] program.

The U.S. Federal government has gathered information from grocery store "discount card" programs, which track customers' shopping patterns and store them in databases, in order to look for "terrorists" by analyzing shoppers' buying patterns.&lt;ref name="fox-store-cards"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,59262,00.html|title=Store Customer Cards a Source for FBI?|last=Vlahos|first=Kelley|date=August 1, 2002|work=FOX News|accessdate=March 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human operatives===
Organizations that have enemies who wish to gather information about the groups' members or activities face the issue of infiltration.&lt;ref name="fbi-anna"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://portland.indymedia.org/en/2006/01/332735.shtml|title=Information on the Confidential Source in the Auburn Arrests|last=anonymous|date=Jan 26, 2006|work=Portland Indymedia|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pentagon-infiltration"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10454316|title=Is the Pentagon spying on Americans?|last=Myers|first=Lisa|date=December 14, 2005|work=NBC Nightly News|publisher=msnbc.com|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to operatives' infiltrating an organization, the surveilling party may exert pressure on certain members of the target organization to act as [[informants]] (i.e., to disclose the information they hold on the organization and its members).&lt;ref name="senate-hearing-informants"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/churchfinalreportIIId.htm|title=The Use of Informants in FBI Domestic Intelligence Investigations |work=Final Report: Book III, Supplementary Detailed Staff Reports on Intelligence Activities and the Rights of Americans |pages=225–270 |date=April 23, 1976 |publisher=U.S. Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities |accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2010/jun/15/secret-justice-criminal-informants-and-americas-underground-legal-system/ |title= Secret Justice: Criminal Informants and America's Underground Legal System {{!}} Prison Legal News |website= www.prisonlegalnews.org |access-date= 2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fielding operatives is very expensive, and for governments with wide-reaching electronic surveillance tools at their disposal the information recovered from operatives can often be obtained from less problematic forms of surveillance such as those mentioned above. Nevertheless, human infiltrators are still common today. For instance, in 2007 documents surfaced showing that the [[FBI]] was planning to field a total of 15,000 undercover agents and informants in response to an anti-terrorism directive sent out by George W. Bush in 2004 that ordered intelligence and law enforcement agencies to increase their [[HUMINT]] capabilities.&lt;ref name="fbi-informant-network"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2007/07/fbi-proposes-bu.html|title=FBI Proposes Building Network of U.S. Informants|last=Ross|first=Brian|date=July 25, 2007|work=Blotter|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Satellite imagery===
{{Main|Reconnaissance satellite}}
On May 25, 2007 the U.S. [[Director of National Intelligence]] [[John Michael McConnell|Michael McConnell]] authorized the [[National Applications Office|National Applications Office (NAO)]] of the [[Department of Homeland Security]] to allow local, state, and domestic Federal agencies to access imagery from [[military intelligence]] [[Reconnaissance satellite]]s and [[Reconnaissance aircraft]] sensors which can now be used to observe the activities of U.S. citizens. The satellites and aircraft sensors will be able to penetrate cloud cover, detect chemical traces, and identify objects in buildings and "underground bunkers", and will provide real-time video at much higher resolutions than the still-images produced by programs such as [[Google Earth]].&lt;ref name="ns-archive-domestic-sat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB229/index.htm|title=U.S. Reconnaissance Satellites: Domestic Targets|work=National Security Archive|accessdate=March 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj-domestic-sat"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118714764716998275 |title=U.S. to Expand Domestic Use Of Spy Satellites|last=Block|first=Robert|date=August 15, 2007|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj-sat-program-approved"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122282336428992785?mod=googlenews_wsj|title=Satellite-Surveillance Program to Begin Despite Privacy Concerns |last=Gorman|first=Siobhan|date=October 1, 2008|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=March 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dhs-nao-factsheet"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dhs.gov/xnews/releases/pr_1187188414685.shtm |title=Fact Sheet: National Applications Office |date=August 15, 2007 |work=Department of Homeland Security (official website) |accessdate=March 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311151910/http://www.dhs.gov/xnews/releases/pr_1187188414685.shtm |archivedate=March 11, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washpost-sat"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/15/AR2007081502430_pf.html|title=Domestic Use of Spy Satellites To Widen|last=Warrick|first=Joby|date=August 16, 2007|work=Washington Post|pages=A01|accessdate=March 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday-spysat"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/surveillance/2004-09-26-civilian-spying_x.htm|title=Spy imagery agency watching inside U.S.|last=Shrader|first=Katherine|date=September 26, 2004|agency=Associated Press|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=March 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identification and credentials===
[[File:Social Security card.jpg|thumb|right|A card containing an identification number]]

One of the simplest forms of identification is the carrying of credentials. Some nations have an [[Identity document|identity card]] system to aid identification, whilst others are considering it but face public opposition. Other documents, such as [[passport]]s, driver's licenses, library cards, banking or credit cards are also used to verify identity.

If the form of the identity card is "machine-readable", usually using an encoded magnetic stripe or identification number (such as a [[Social Security number]]), it corroborates the subject's identifying data. In this case it may create an electronic trail when it is checked and scanned, which can be used in profiling, as mentioned above.

===RFID and geolocation devices===
[[File:RFID hand 1.jpg|thumb|right|Hand with planned insertion point for Verichip device]]

====RFID tagging====
[[Radio Frequency Identification]] (RFID) tagging is the use of very small electronic devices (called "RFID tags") which are applied to or incorporated into a product, animal, or person for the purpose of identification and tracking using radio waves. The tags can be read from several meters away. They are extremely inexpensive, costing a few cents per piece, so they can be inserted into many types of everyday products without significantly increasing the price, and can be used to track and identify these objects for a variety of purposes.

Some companies appear to be "tagging" their workers by incorporating RFID tags in employee ID badges. Workers in U.K. considered [[strike action]] in protest of having themselves tagged; they felt that it was [[dehumanisation|dehumanizing]] to have all of their movements tracked with RFID chips.&lt;ref name="rfid-strike-uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/article/print/6294|title=Two Stories Highlight the RFID Debate|date=July 19, 2005|work=RFID Journal|accessdate=March 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{vague|date=March 2012}} Some critics have expressed fears that people will soon be tracked and scanned everywhere they go.&lt;ref name="usatoday-verichip"/&gt;  On the other hand, RFID tags in newborn baby ID bracelets put on by hospitals have foiled kidnappings.&lt;ref name="rfid-strike-uk" /&gt;

[[File:Paypass chip front.png|thumb|upright|left|RFID chip pulled from new credit card]]
[[Verichip]] is an RFID device produced by a company called Applied Digital Solutions (ADS). Verichip is slightly larger than a grain of rice, and is injected under the skin. The injection reportedly feels similar to receiving a [[Injection (medicine)|shot]]. The chip is encased in glass, and stores a "VeriChip Subscriber Number" which the scanner uses to access their personal information, via the Internet, from Verichip Inc.'s database, the "Global VeriChip Subscriber Registry". Thousands of people have already had them inserted.&lt;ref name="usatoday-verichip"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/surveillance/2007-07-21-chips_N.htm|title=Microchips in humans spark privacy debate|last=Lewan|first=Todd|date=July 21, 2007|agency=Associated Press|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=March 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mexico, for example, 160 workers at the Attorney General's office were required to have the chip injected for identity verification and [[access control]] purposes.&lt;ref name="mex-pig-verichip"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/global-cio/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=23901004|title= RFID Chips Implanted In Mexican Law-Enforcement Workers|last=Gardener|first=W.

In a 2003 editorial, CNET News.com's chief political correspondent, Declan McCullagh, speculated that, soon, every object that is purchased, and perhaps ID cards, will have RFID devices in them, which would respond with information about people as they walk past scanners (what type of phone they have, what type of shoes they have on, which books they are carrying, what credit cards or membership cards they have, etc.). This information could be used for identification, tracking, or [[targeted marketing]]. {{as of|2012}}, this has largely not come to pass.&lt;ref name="mccullagh-rfid"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/2010-1069-980325.html|title=RFID Tags: Big Brother in small packages|last=McCullagh |first=Declan|date=January 13, 2003|work=CNET News|accessdate=July 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Global Positioning System====
[[File:ConstellationGPS.gif|thumb|right|Diagram of GPS satellites orbiting Earth]]

{{see also|GPS tracking}}

In the U.S., police have planted hidden [[Global positioning system|GPS]] tracking devices in people's vehicles to monitor their movements,&lt;ref&gt;Lyman, D., Micheal.

''Ethical Justice: Applied Issues for Criminal Justice Students and Professionals''. 1st ed.  Academic Press, 2013. p150. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2009, they were arguing in court that they have the right to do this.&lt;ref name="fbi-warrantless-gps"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/government/federal/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=215800542|title=Court Asked To Disallow Warrantless GPS Tracking |last=Claburn|first=Thomas|date=March 4, 2009| work=Information Week |accessdate=March 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several cities are running pilot projects to require parolees to wear GPS devices to track their movements when they get out of prison.&lt;ref name="verichip-legal"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/LAW/05/columns/fl.hilden.chip/index.html|title=What legal questions are the new chip implants for humans likely to raise?| last=Hilden| first=Julie| work=CNN.com (FindLaw)| accessdate=March 17, 2009| date=April 16, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mobile phones====
Mobile phones are also commonly used to collect geolocation data. The geographical location of a mobile phone (and thus the person carrying it) can be determined easily (whether it is being used or not), using a technique known [[multilateration]] to calculate the differences in time for a signal to travel from the cell phone to each of several [[cell towers]] near the owner of the phone.&lt;ref name="bbc-phone-locate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foxnews-phone-locate"/&gt; Dr. Victor Kappeler&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kappeler|first=Victor|title=Forget the NSA: Police May be a Greater Threat to Privacy|url=http://www.plsonline.eku.edu/insidelook/forget-nsa-police-may-be-greater-threat-privacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of Eastern Kentucky University indicates that police surveillance is a strong concern, stating the following statistics from 2013:
{{quote|Of the 321,545 law enforcement requests made to Verizon, 54,200 of these requests were for "content" or "location" information—not just cell phone numbers or IP addresses. Content information included the actual text of messages, emails and the wiretapping of voice or messaging content in real-time.}}
A comparatively new off-the-shelf surveillance device is an [[IMSI-catcher]], a [[Telephone tapping|telephone eavesdropping]] device used to intercept mobile phone traffic and track the movement of mobile phone users. Essentially a "fake" [[cell site|mobile tower]] acting between the target mobile phone and the service provider's real towers, it is considered a [[man-in-the-middle attack|man-in-the-middle]] (MITM) attack. IMSI-catchers are used in some countries by [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] and [[Intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]], but their use has raised significant civil liberty and privacy concerns and is strictly regulated in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | chapter=Section 100i – IMS I-Catcher | title=The German Code Of Criminal Procedure | url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stpo/german_code_of_criminal_procedure.pdf | pages=43–44 | year=2014 | access-date=November 27, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925164238/http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stpo/german_code_of_criminal_procedure.pdf | archive-date=September 25, 2015 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human microchips===
{{Main|Microchip implant (human)}}

A human microchip implant is an identifying integrated circuit device or [[RFID]] transponder encased in [[silicate glass]] and implanted in the body of a human being.  A [[subdermal implant]] typically contains a unique ID number that can be linked to information contained in an external database, such as personal identification, medical history, medications, allergies, and contact information.

Several types of microchips have been developed in order to control and monitor certain types of people, such as criminals, political figures and spies,{{Clarify|date=February 2016}} a "killer" tracking chip patent was filed at the German Patent and Trademark Office (DPMA) around May 2009.

===Devices===
{{See also|United States v. Spy Factory, Inc.}}
[[Covert listening device]]s and video devices, or "bugs", are hidden electronic devices which are used to capture, record, and/or transmit data to a receiving party such as a law enforcement agency.

The U.S. has run numerous domestic intelligence operations, such as [[COINTELPRO]], which have bugged the homes, offices, and vehicles of thousands of U.S. citizens, usually [[political activists]], [[subversives]], and [[criminals]].&lt;ref name="wolf-cointelpro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/cointel.htm|title=COINTELPRO|last=Wolf|first=Paul|work=(online collection of historical documents)|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law enforcement and intelligence services in the U.K. and the United States possess technology to remotely activate the microphones in cell phones, by accessing the phone's diagnostic/maintenance features, in order to listen to conversations that take place nearby the person who holds the phone.&lt;ref name="roving-bugs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="uk-mobile-bug"/&gt;&lt;ref name="noaa-phone"/&gt;

===Postal services===
As more people use faxes and e-mail the significance of surveilling the postal system is decreasing, in favor of Internet and telephone surveillance. But interception of post is still an available option for law enforcement and intelligence agencies, in certain circumstances.{{citation needed |date=May 2015}} This is not a common practice, however, and entities like the US Army require high levels of approval to conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/pdf/r381_10.pdf |title=U.S. Army Intelligence Activities |accessdate=25 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150808002021/http://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/pdf/r381_10.pdf |archivedate=August 8, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] have performed twelve separate mail-opening campaigns targeted towards U.S. citizens. In one of these programs, more than 215,000 communications were intercepted, opened, and photographed.&lt;ref name="senate-mail-opening"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/pdfs94th/94755_III.pdf |title=Domestic CIA and FBI Mail Opening Programs |work=Final Report: Book III, Supplementary Detailed Staff Reports on Intelligence Activities and the Rights of Americans |pages=559–678 |date=April 23, 1976 |publisher=U.S. Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities |accessdate=March 13, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505050256/http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/pdfs94th/94755_III.pdf |archivedate=May 5, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="political-repression"&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldstein|first=Robert|title=[[Political Repression in Modern America]]|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|isbn=978-0-252-06964-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stakeout===
{{Redirect|Stakeout}}
A '''stakeout''' is the coordinated surveillance of a location or person. Stakeouts are generally performed [[covert]]ly and for the purpose of gathering [[evidence]] related to [[criminal activity]]. The term derives from the practice by [[land surveyor]]s of using [[survey stakes]] to measure out an area before the main building project is commenced.

=== Wildlife ===

Supporters of surveillance systems believe that these tools can help protect society from [[terrorists]] and [[criminals]]. They argue that surveillance can reduce crime by three means: by deterrence, by observation, and by reconstruction. Surveillance can deter by increasing the chance of being caught, and by revealing the [[modus operandi]]. This requires a minimal level of [[invasive observation|invasiveness]].&lt;ref name ="Deviant Behaviour - Socially accepted observation of behaviour for security"&gt;[http://www.fp7-tactics.eu/files/documents/Deviant%20Behaviour-Socially%20accepted%20observation%20of%20behaviour%20for%20security.pdf Deviant Behaviour – Socially accepted observation of behaviour for security], Jeroen van Rest&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method on how surveillance can be used to fight criminal activity is by linking the information stream obtained from them to a recognition system (for instance, a camera system that has its feed run through a facial recognition system). This can for instance auto-recognize fugitives and direct police to their location.

A distinction here has to be made however on the type of surveillance employed. Some people that say support video surveillance in city streets may not support indiscriminate telephone taps and vice versa. Besides the types, the way in how this surveillance is done also matters a lot; i.e. indiscriminate telephone taps are supported by much fewer people than say telephone taps only done to people suspected of engaging in illegal activities.

Surveillance can also be used to give human operatives a tactical advantage through improved situational awareness, or through the use of automated processes, i.e. [[video analytics]]. Surveillance can help reconstruct an incident and prove guilt through the availability of footage for forensics experts. Surveillance can also influence subjective security if surveillance resources are visible or if the consequences of surveillance can be felt.

Some of the surveillance systems (such as the camera system that has its feed run through a facial recognition system mentioned above) can also have other uses besides countering criminal activity. For instance, it can help on retrieving runaway children, abducted or missing adults and mentally disabled people. 
Other supporters simply believe that there is nothing that can be done about the loss of privacy, and that people must become accustomed to having no privacy. As [[Sun Microsystems]] CEO [[Scott McNealy]] said: "You have zero privacy anyway. Get over it."&lt;ref name="sun-getoverit"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/1999/01/17538|title=Sun on Privacy: 'Get Over It'|last=Sprenger|first=Polly|date=January 26, 1999|work=Wired Magazine|accessdate=March 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bw-getoverit"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/1999/99_14/b3623028.htm |title=Privacy |last=Baig |first=Edward |author2=Marcia Stepanek |author3=Neil Gross |date=April 5, 1999 |work=Business Week |accessdate=March 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017102602/http://www.businessweek.com/1999/99_14/b3623028.htm |archivedate=October 17, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common argument is: "[[nothing to hide argument|If you aren't doing something wrong then you don't have anything to fear]]." Which follows that if one is engaging in unlawful activities, in which case they do not have a legitimate justification for their privacy. However, if they are following the law the surveillance would not affect them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Daniel J. Solove|Solove, Daniel]]|title='I've Got Nothing to Hide' and Other Misunderstandings of Privacy|journal=San Diego Law Review|year=2007|volume=44|page=745|ssrn=998565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition===
[[File:UncleSamListensIn.jpg|thumb|upright|An elaborate [[Sgraffito|graffito]] in Columbus, Ohio, depicting state surveillance of [[telecommunications]] ]]

With the advent of programs such as the [[Total Information Awareness]] program and [[ADVISE]], technologies such as [[NarusInsight|high speed surveillance computers]] and [[Surveillance#Biometric|biometrics]] software, and laws such as the [[Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act]], governments now possess an unprecedented ability to monitor the activities of their subjects.&lt;ref name="us-surveillance-soc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/privacy/gen/index.html|title=Is the U.S. Turning Into a Surveillance Society?|work=American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[civil rights]] and [[privacy]] groups, such as the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] and [[American Civil Liberties Union]], have expressed concern that by allowing continual increases in government surveillance of citizens we will end up in a [[mass surveillance]] society, with extremely limited, or non-existent political and/or personal freedoms. Fears such as this have led to numerous lawsuits such as ''[[Hepting v. AT&amp;T]]''.&lt;ref name="us-surveillance-soc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bigger-monster"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/FilesPDFs/aclu_report_bigger_monster_weaker_chains.pdf|title=Bigger Monster, Weaker Chains: The Growth of an American Surveillance Society|date=January 15, 2003|work=American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics state that the claim made by supporters should be modified to read: "As long as we do what we're told, we have nothing to fear.".&lt;!-- [103] --&gt; For instance, a person who is part of a political group which opposes the policies of the national government, might not want the government to know their names and what they have been reading, so that the government cannot easily subvert their organization, arrest, or kill them.&lt;!-- [104] --&gt; Other critics state that while a person might not have anything to hide right now, the government might later implement policies that they do wish to oppose, and that opposition might then be impossible due to mass surveillance enabling the government to identify and remove political threats.&lt;!-- [103] --&gt;&lt;!-- [105] --&gt; Further, other critics point to the fact that most people ''do'' have things to hide.&lt;!-- [102] --&gt;&lt;!-- [104] --&gt; For example, if a person is looking for a new job, they might not want their current employer to know this.&lt;!-- [106] --&gt; Also if an employer wishes total privacy to watch over their own employee and secure their financial information it may become impossible, and they may not wish to hire those under surveillance. The most concern of detriment is securing the lives of those who live under total surveillance willingly, educating the public to those under peaceful watch while identifying terrorist and those who use the same surveillance systems and mechanisms in opposition to peace, against civilians, and to disclose lives removed from the laws of the land.

In addition, a significant risk of private data collection stems from the fact that this risk is too much unknown to be readily assessed today. Storage is cheap enough to have data stored forever, and the models using which it will be analyzed in a decade from now cannot reasonably be foreseen.&lt;ref name="privacy-hbarel"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hbarel.com/index.php/against-the-collection-of-private|title=Against the collection of private data: The unknown risk factor|date=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, the Government of China took steps to oppose widespread surveillance by security-company cameras, webcams, and [[IP Camera]]s after tens-of-thousands were made accessible for internet viewing by IT company [[Qihoo]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2124158/chinese-tech-firm-told-stop-watching-us-after-footage-security&lt;/ref&gt;

====Totalitarianism====
[[File:Sur-veillance-trafficcam-glog.jpg|thumb|upright|A traffic camera atop a high pole oversees a road in the Canadian city of Toronto]]

Programs such as the [[Total Information Awareness]] program, and laws such as the [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act]] have led many groups to fear that society is moving towards a state of [[mass surveillance]] with severely limited personal, social, political freedoms, where dissenting individuals or groups will be strategically removed in [[COINTELPRO]]-like purges.&lt;ref name="us-surveillance-soc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bigger-monster"/&gt;

Kate Martin, of the Center For National Security Studies said of the use of military spy satellites being used to monitor the activities of U.S. citizens: "They are laying the bricks one at a time for a police state."&lt;ref name="washpost-sat"/&gt;

Some point to the blurring of lines between public and private places, and the privatization of places traditionally seen as public (such as shopping malls and industrial parks) as illustrating the increasing legality of collecting personal information.&lt;ref name="Marx et al, 2007"&gt;Marx, G. T., &amp; Muschert, G. W. (2007). [http://www.users.miamioh.edu/muschegw/Personal%20Info%20Borders%20Surveillance%20Marx%20Muschert.pdf Personal information, borders, and the new surveillance studies]. Annual Review of Law and Social Science, 3, 375–395.&lt;/ref&gt; Traveling through many public places such as government offices is hardly optional for most people, yet consumers have little choice but to submit to companies' surveillance practices.&lt;ref name="Agre, 2003"&gt;Agre, Philip E. (2003), [http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/bar-code.html "Your Face is not a bar code: arguments against automatic face recognition in public places"]. Retrieved November 14, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Surveillance techniques are not created equal; among the many [[biometric]] identification technologies, for instance, [[face recognition]] requires the least cooperation. Unlike automatic fingerprint reading, which requires an individual to press a finger against a machine, this technique is subtle and requires little to no consent.&lt;ref name="Agre, 2003" /&gt;

====Psychological/social effects====
{{See also|Hawthorne effect}}
Some critics, such as [[Michel Foucault]], believe that in addition to its obvious function of identifying and capturing individuals who are committing undesirable acts, surveillance also functions to create in everyone a feeling of always being watched, so that they become self-policing. This allows the State to control the populace without having to resort to physical force, which is expensive and otherwise problematic.&lt;ref name="foucault-discipline"&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|title=Discipline and Punish|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|year=1979|pages=201–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of panopticism is a means of indirect control over a large populace through the uncertainty of surveillance. Michel Foucault analyzed the architecture of the prison panopticon, and realized that its success was not just in its ability to monitor but also its ability to not monitor without anyone knowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|title=Discipline and Punish|date=1995|publisher=Random House|location=New York|pages=200–203}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Critics such as Derrick Jensen and George Draffan, argue that panopticism in the United States began in World War I when the issuing of passports became important for the tracking of citizens and possibly enemies of the state. Such surveillance continues today through government agencies in the form of tracking internet usage and library usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jensen|first=Derrick|title= Welcome to the Machine: Science, Surveillance and the Culture of Control|date=2004|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|location=Vermont|pages=112–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the development of digital technology, individuals have become increasingly perceptible to one another, as surveillance becomes virtual. Online surveillance is the utilization of the internet to observe one's activity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Superconnected: the internet, digital media, and techno-social life|last=Chayko|first=Mary|publisher=Sage Publications|year=2017|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations, citizens, and governments participate in tracking others' behaviours for motivations that arise out of business relations, to curiosity, to legality. In her book ''Superconnected'', Chayko differentiates between two types of surveillance: vertical and horizontal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Vertical surveillance occurs when there is a dominant force, such as the government that is attempting to control or regulate the actions of a given society. Such powerful authorities often justify their incursions as a means to protect society from threats of violence or terrorism. Some individuals question when this becomes an infringement on civil rights.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Horizontal diverges from vertical surveillance as the tracking shifts from an authoritative source to an everyday figure, such as a friend, coworker, or stranger that is interested in one's mundane activities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Individuals leave traces of information when they are online that reveal their interests and desires of which others observe. While this can allow people to become interconnected and develop social connections online, it can also increase potential risk to harm, such as [[cyberbullying]] or censoring/stalking by strangers, reducing privacy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Michel Foucault has expanded literature on discipline and power structures within society, specifically by developing Jeremy Bentham's notion of the [[panopticon]]. This metaphor has been used to illustrate the influence of surveillance on the individual, in addition to society as a collective. The panopticon is a circular prison design in which prison guards are located within the center of the facility, monitoring the prisoners who are invisible to one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discipline and Punish: The Birth of Prison|last=Foucault|first=Michel|publisher=Vintage|year=1977|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the inmates are not consistently observed, they are nevertheless obliged to abide by the rules due to the perception that they are under surveillance. This is similar to the contemporary prevalence of undercover police and highway trackers. An example of video surveillance is called closed-circuit television ([[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]]), which are used to reduce crime and increase public safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheldon|first=Barrie|date=October 2011|title=Camera surveillance within the UK: Enhancing public safety or a social threat?|url=|journal=International Review of Law, Computers &amp; Technology|volume=25|pages=193–203|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulation is maintained both through vertical and self-surveillance.

====Privacy====
Numerous [[civil rights]] groups and [[privacy]] groups oppose surveillance as a violation of people's right to privacy. Such groups include: [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]], [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], [[American Civil Liberties Union]]

There have been several lawsuits such as [[Hepting v. AT&amp;T]] and [[EPIC v. Department of Justice]] by groups or individuals, opposing certain surveillance activities.

Legislative proceedings such as those that took place during the [[Church Committee]], which investigated domestic intelligence programs such as [[COINTELPRO]], have also weighed the pros and cons of surveillance.

;Court Cases

[[People v. Diaz|People vs. Diaz (2011)]] was a court case in the realm of cell phone privacy, even though the decision was later overturned. In this case, Gregory Diaz was arrested during a sting operation for attempting to sell ecstasy.  During his arrest, police searched Diaz's phone and found more incriminating evidence including SMS text messages and photographs depicting illicit activities.  During his trial, Diaz attempted to have the information from his cell phone removed from evidence, but the courts deemed it as lawful and Diaz's appeal was denied on the California State Court level and, later, the Supreme Court level.  Just three short years after, this decision was overturned in the case Riley vs. California (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-court-of-appeal/1033744.html|title=People vs. Diaz|last=Court of Appeal, Second District, Division 6, California.|first=|date=July 30, 2008|website=FindLaw|access-date=Feb 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Riley v. California|Riley vs. California (2014)]] was an extremely vital [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] case in which a man was arrested for his involvement in a drive-by shooting.  A few days after the shooting the police made an arrest of the suspect (Riley), and, during the arrest, the police searched him.  However, this search was not only of Riley's person, but also the police opened and searched his cell phone, finding pictures of other weapons, drugs, and of Riley showing gang signs.  In court, the question arose whether searching the phone was lawful or if the search was protected by the 4th amendment of the constitution.  The decision held that the search of Riley's cell phone during the arrest was illegal, and that it was protected by the 4th Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/2013/13-132|title=Riley v.

==Countersurveillance, inverse surveillance, sousveillance==
[[Countersurveillance]] is the practice of avoiding surveillance or making surveillance difficult. Developments in the late twentieth century have caused counter surveillance to dramatically grow in both scope and complexity, such as the Internet, increasing prevalence of electronic [[security systems]], high-altitude (and possibly armed) [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAVs]], and large corporate and government computer databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stratfor.com/secrets_countersurveillance|title=The Secrets of Countersurveillance|publisher=Security Weekly|date=June 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Inverse surveillance]] is the practice of the reversal of surveillance on other individuals or groups (e.g., citizens photographing police). Well-known examples are [[Rodney King|George Holliday]]'s recording of the [[Rodney King]] beating and the organization [[Copwatch]], which attempts to monitor police officers to prevent [[police brutality]].  Counter-surveillance can be also used in applications to prevent corporate spying, or to track other criminals by certain criminal entities. It can also be used to deter stalking methods used by various entities and organizations.

''[[Sousveillance]]'' is inverse surveillance, involving the recording by private individuals, rather than government or corporate entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Popular culture==
===In literature===
* [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' portrays a fictional [[totalitarian]] surveillance society with a very simple (by today's standards) [[mass surveillance]] system consisting of human operatives, informants, and two-way "telescreens" in people's homes. Because of the impact of this book, mass-surveillance technologies are commonly called "Orwellian" when they are considered problematic.
* The novel ''[[mistrust]]'' highlights the negative effects from the overuse of surveillance at Reflection House. The central character Kerryn installs secret cameras to monitor her housemates – see also [[Paranoia]].
* The book ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'', as well as a film based on it, portray a totalitarian [[Christian]] [[theocracy]] where all citizens are kept under constant surveillance.
* In the book ''[[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]'', [[Lisbeth Salander]] uses computers to get information on people, as well as other common surveillance methods, as a freelancer.
* [[Dave Eggers|David Egger's]] novel ''[[The Circle (Eggers novel)|The Circle]]'' exhibits a world where a single company called "The Circle" produces all of the latest and highest quality technologies from computers and smartphones, to surveillance cameras known as "See-Change cameras". This company becomes associated with politics when starting a movement where politicians go "transparent" by wearing See-Change cameras on their body to prevent keeping secrets from the public about their daily work activity. In this society, it becomes mandatory to share personal information and experiences because it is The Circle's belief that everyone should have access to all information freely. However, as Eggers illustrates, this takes a toll on the individuals and creates a disruption of power between the governments and the private company. The Circle presents extreme ideologies surrounding mandatory surveillance. Eamon Bailey, one of the Wise Men, or founders of The Circle, believes that possessing the tools to access information about anything or anyone, should be a human right given to all of the world's citizens.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Circle|last=Eggers|first=David|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf, McSweeney's Books|year=2013|isbn=978-0-385-35139-3|location=New York|pages=288, 290–291, 486}}&lt;/ref&gt; By eliminating all secrets, any behaviour that has been deemed shameful will either become normalized or no longer considered shocking. Negative actions will eventually be eradicated from society altogether, through the fear of being exposed to other citizens&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This would be achieved in part by everyone going transparent, something that Bailey highly supports, although it's notable that none of the Wise Men ever became transparent themselves. One major goal of The Circle is to have all of the world's information filtered through The Circle, a process they call "Completion".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A single, private company would then have full access and control over all information and privacy of individuals and governments. Ty Gospodinov, the first founder of The Circle, has major concerns about the completion of the circle. He warns that this step would give The Circle too much power and control, and would quickly lead to [[totalitarianism]].

===In music===
* The [[Dead Kennedys]]' song "I Am The Owl" is about government surveillance and [[Social engineering (security)|social engineering]] of political groups.
* The [[Vienna Teng]] song "Hymn of Acxiom" is about corporate data collection and surveillance.

===Onscreen===
{{Main|List of films featuring surveillance}}

* The film ''[[Gattaca]]'' portrays a society that uses [[biometric]] surveillance to distinguish between people who are genetically engineered "superior" humans and genetically natural "inferior" humans.
* In the movie ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', the police and government intelligence agencies use [[micro aerial vehicles]] in [[SWAT]] operations and for surveillance purposes.
* [[HBO]]'s crime-drama series ''[[The Sopranos]]'' regularly portrays the FBI's surveillance of the [[DiMeo Crime Family]]. Audio devices they use include "[[Covert listening device|bugs]]" placed in strategic locations (e.g., in "[[I Dream of Jeannie Cusamano]]" and "[[Mr. Ruggerio's Neighborhood]]") and hidden microphones worn by operatives (e.g., in "[[Rat Pack (The Sopranos)|Rat Pack]]") and informants (e.g., in "[[Funhouse (The Sopranos)|Funhouse]]", "[[Proshai, Livushka]]" and "[[Members Only (The Sopranos)|Members Only]]"). Visual devices include [[hidden cameras|hidden still cameras]] (e.g., in "[[Pax Soprana]]") and video cameras (e.g., in "[[Long Term Parking]]").
* The movie ''[[THX-1138]]'' portrays a society wherein people are drugged with sedatives and antidepressants, and have surveillance cameras watching them everywhere they go.
* The movie ''[[The Lives of Others]]'' portrays the monitoring of [[East Berlin]] by agents of the [[Stasi]], the [[East Germany|GDR]]'s secret police.
* The movie ''[[The Conversation]]'' portrays many methods of [[Eavesdropping|audio surveillance]].

== Sustainable communities ==
Scotland's first dedicated programme for sustainable communities was delivered by Forward Scotland between 1997-1999 as part of a UK wide initiative led by Encams. Partnerships with a number of local authorities were developed and dedicated officers recruited to work with communities. This programme piloted the Community Eco-cal a forerunner of ecological footprinting. This programme was evaluated by Professor Michael Carley, Heriot-Watt University and the lessons learned informed a successor programme, 2000-2002, where community groups themselves were the focus. This produced the very first handbook for sustainable communities and a series of highly successful community projects. During this time the first community grants programme for sustainable communities was launched funded by the New Opportunities Fund (now the Big Lottery Fund). This programme funded some pioneering projects in areas such as community renewables, local food, community waste management and the first ecological footprinting projects in Scotland.

[[Community Energy Scotland]] is a charity that provides free advice, grant funding and finance for [[renewable energy]] projects developed by community groups in Scotland. The main aim of the company is to enable all communities to generate and use renewable energy for their long term and collective benefit.&lt;ref name=HICEC&gt;HICEC. (2006) ''Highlands and Islands Community Energy Company Annual Review''. Inverness. [http://www.hie.co.uk/HICEC/HICEC-Annual_review.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010 the local [[development trust]] on the island of [[Tiree]] commissioned a 950&amp;nbsp;kW community-owned wind turbine project, the fourth such large-scale project in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tireerenewableenergy.co.uk/ "Tiree renewable energy"]. tireerenewableenergy.co.uk.

In August 2010 the historian [[James Hunter (historian)|James Hunter]] stated that the transfer of ownership into community control had brought about "a spectacular reversal of [[Gigha|Gigha's]] slide towards complete population collapse" and suggested that the UK Government should  learn lessons from this and other community buy-outs in places such as [[Assynt]], [[Eigg]], and [[Knoydart]] to inform their [[Big Society]] plans.&lt;ref&gt;"Ross, David (20 August 2010) "Cameron should visit Gigha to see the Big Society in action, says historian". Glasgow: ''The Herald''.&lt;/ref&gt; These successes notwithstanding, civil servants have been criticised for impeding community buy-outs of land via the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]]. For example, the proposed community purchase of the former [[RAF Machrihanish]] base was thwarted due to technical problems with the application despite 97.4% local support in a referendum.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, David (1 September 2010).

==Public sector==

===Government policy===
The first serious policy was written in 1998 in anticipation of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, by the Secretary of State's Advisory Group for Sustainable Development. This was followed by strategy that focussed on Waste, Energy and Travel in 2002 and Choosing our Future in 2005, which was written in association with the UK shared framework for sustainable development. In 2007 the Scottish National Party took office in a minority government pursuing 5 strategic objectives that encompass sustainable development but do not specifically reference it. Instead the government has adopted sustainable economic growth as its principal target.

In June 2007 [[John Swinney]], the new Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth in the [[Scottish Government]], announced plans for a Climate Change Bill that would include an intention to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Kevin (22 June 2007). [http://www.theherald.co.uk/politics/news/display.var.1490712.0.0.php "Scotland could be ‘world leader’ in fighting climate change".] Glasgow. ''The Herald''.

In August 2007 the Scottish Government announced the creation of a [[Saltire Prize]] for innovation in industry, which will reward excellence in developing new renewable energy technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hi-energy.org.uk/Default.aspx.LocID-%20%20%2006gnew02i%20%20%20.RefLocID-06g008001.Lang-EN.htm "Green energy excellence to be rewarded": John Swinney announces Saltire Prize] Hi-Energy (15 August 2007) Press release.

The passage of the [[Climate change in Scotland#Mitigation|Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009]] has a created and informed a wide variety of initiatives. The Climate Change Delivery Plan sets out what needs to be done to achieve emissions reductions to meet the statutory targets that are included in the Act. The Climate Change Adaptation Framework, published in December 2009  aims to build resilience and capacity for change. Other public sector initiatives  include:
* The Renewable Energy Framework, the Renewables Action Plan, and the Renewable Heat Action Plan
* The [[Flood Risk Management (Scotland) Act 2009]]
* Scotland's Climate Change Declaration
* The Rural Land Use Study
* The Scottish Climate Change Impact Partnership

===Scottish Sustainable Development Forum===
The Scottish Sustainable Development Forum (SSDF) is a group the focussed on promoting debate and action on sustainable development issues in Scotland. Forum membership is open to any individual who wishes to make Scotland more sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssdforum.org.uk/ "About Us"] Scottish Sustainable Development Forum. Retrieved 22 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public bodies===
In January 2010 it emerged that [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency|SEPA]], the government body responsible for protecting the environment had failed to reach its carbon emissions targets. Its aim is to cut CO2 emissions from business activities by 25% by 2012 compared with 2006 but a report showed that they had risen by 10% in the past year.&lt;ref&gt;Fyall, Jenny (29 January 2010) '' 'Green police' fail to hit own targets".''The Scotsman''.

==Energy production and distribution==
{{Main|Renewable energy in Scotland}}
[[File:Windmills and Ailsa Craig aka Paddy's Milestone rotated.jpg|thumb|right|Wind, wave and tide make up more than 80% of Scotland's renewable energy potential.]]
The natural resource base for [[renewable energy|renewables]] is extraordinary by [[Renewable energy in the European Union|European]], and even global standards. In addition to an existing installed capacity{{Ref label|A|a|none}} of 1.3 [[watt|Gigawatts]] (GW) of [[hydroelectricity|hydro-electric]] schemes, Scotland has an estimated potential of 36.5 GW of [[wind power|wind]] and 7.5 GW of [[tidal power]], 25% of the estimated total capacity for the [[European Union]] and up to 14 GW of [[wave power]] potential, 10% of EU capacity.&lt;ref name=Pow&gt;RSPB Scotland, WWF Scotland and FOE Scotland (February 2006) ''The Power of Scotland: Cutting Carbon with Scotland's Renewable Energy''. RSPB et al.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SER/&gt; The renewable electricity generating capacity may be 60 GW or more, considerably greater than the existing capacity from all Scottish fuel sources of 10.3 GW.&lt;ref name=Pow/&gt;&lt;ref name=SRF4&gt;Scottish Renewables (January 2006) ''Market and Planning Report''. Issue No 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of this potential remains untapped, but continuing improvements in engineering are enabling more of the [[renewable resource]]s to be utilised. Fears regarding "[[peak oil]]" and [[climate change]] have driven the subject high up the political agenda and are also encouraging the use of various [[biofuel]]s. Although the finances of many projects remain either speculative or dependent on [[subsidy|subsidies]], it is probable that there has been a significant, and in all likelihood long-term change, in the underpinning economics.&lt;ref name=Monbiot&gt;Monbiot, George (2006) ''Heat: How to Stop the Planet Burning''. London. Allen Lane.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to planned increases in both large-scale generating capacity and microsystems using renewable sources, various related schemes to reduce [[greenhouse gas|carbon emissions]] are being researched.&lt;ref name=BPPH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peterheadhydrogenpower.com/|title=Peterhead hydrogen project|publisher=[[BP]]|accessdate=2007-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is significant support from the public, private and community-led sectors, concerns about the effect of the technologies on the natural environment have been expressed. There is also an emerging political debate about the relationship between the siting, and the ownership and control of these widely distributed resources.&lt;ref&gt;HICEC.

===Wind power===
{{Main|Wind power in Scotland}}
Wind power in Scotland is an area of considerable activity, with 1550 MW of installed capacity as at October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/south_of_scotland/7695508.stm Turbines achieve energy landmark]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wind power]] is the fastest growing of the renewable energy technologies in Scotland and the world's largest [[wind turbine]] generator (5 MW) is currently undergoing testing in the North Sea, 15 miles off the east coast. There are numerous large wind farms as well as a number, both planned and operating, which are in community ownership. The siting of turbines is sometimes an issue, but surveys have shown high levels of community acceptance for wind power in Scotland. There is further potential for expansion, especially offshore, given the high average wind speeds.

In May 2008 Scottish and Southern Energy confirmed it was proceeding with the Greater Gabbard wind farm, located off the south coast of England. However, they sold their stake in this project, expected to become the largest wind farm in the world, to [[npower (UK)|Npower]] some six months later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/story?id=52579 "Greater Gabbard Wind Project Gets Go-ahead "] (27 May 2008) Renewable Energy World.com.

===Lower carbon power stations===
In May 2007 Scottish Power announced that Alstom Power and Doosan Babcock had been commissioned to design plans for "clean coal" technology at [[Longannet]] and [[Cockenzie power station|Cockenzie]] power stations. This would have become the largest project of its kind in Europe&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, Alistair (18 May 2007). [http://news.scotsman.com/scotland.cfm?id=771022007 " 'Dinosaur' power stations in line for £1bn green revamp"]. Edinburgh. ''The Scotsman''. Retrieved on 31 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but it was cancelled in 2011 after the Westminster Government withdrew funding.&lt;ref&gt;Currie, Brian (19 Oct 2011) "Scots £1bn climate change plant is axed". Glasgow. ''The Herald''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scottish Power]] have also announced that they wished to reduce carbon emissions by using biomass products such as willow or cereals at Longannet and Cockenzie. This could save up to 300,000 tonnes (330,000&amp;nbsp;tons) of carbon emissions per annum. However, the challenge of replacing large-scale power production with renewables was highlighted by the fact that to replace 5% of the fuel from these plants, fully 12% of Scotland's agricultural land would be required.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6905893.stm "Crop energy power plan unveiled".] BBC online (July 19, 2007). Retrieved on 27 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carbon sequestration===
The [[British Geological Survey]] estimate that potentially 755 billion tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; could be stored in [[carbon dioxide sink]]s in the [[North Sea]] (Scotland's annual CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; output is circa 50 million tonnes). The process also aids the recovery of oil and gas as it increases pressure in the oil field. The [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|DTI]] estimate that as much as 2 billion additional barrels of oil could be recovered as a result of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; injection.&lt;ref name=SER&gt;''A Scottish Energy Review''. (November 2005) Scottish National Party Framework Paper. Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this process could reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from conventional power plants by as much as 80–90%, if combined with increased oil recovery the net savings in carbon emissions may be much less as the total volume of oil and gas used from that field would increase.&lt;ref name=Monbiot /&gt;

===Electricity distribution===
However, controversy has arisen about [[Ofgem]]'s proposed plans to increase transmission charges for distant electrical generation. This was widely seen as placing renewable energy production in Scotland at a considerable disadvantage. Jason Ormiston, the chief executive of [[Scottish Renewables]] was quoted as saying "At a time when the UK government's chief scientific adviser has said that climate change is the greatest threat to humanity, here we have the industry regulator penalising renewable electricity generators for generating where the resource is greatest."&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Ian (27 July 2007). [http://news.scotsman.com/scotland.cfm?id=1170522007 " 'Mad' fines of £200,000 jeopardise Scots green energy sector"]. Edinburgh. ''The Scotsman''. Retrieved on 27 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was highlighted the following month when leaked Department of Trade and Industry documents indicated that, despite Scottish successes, under current policies Britain would miss the EU's 2020 target of 20% energy from renewables by a considerable margin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/aug/13/renewableenergy.energy "Revealed: cover-up plan on energy target".] London. ''Guardian Unlimited'' (13 August 2007). Retrieved on 13 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month a report by [[Xero Energy Limited]] into these 'use of system' transmission charges across Europe indicated that the UK system creates costs that are up to thirty times higher in Scotland than elsewhere in Europe and that charges for the [[List of islands of Scotland|islands]] are "almost certainly higher than any other European country". [[Rob Gibson]] an [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]] for the Highlands and Islands described the charges as "a tax on geography", and Elaine Hanton of [[Highlands and Islands Enterprise|HIE]] claimed the report raised "serious concerns".&lt;ref&gt;Ross, John (14 September 2007) "Green energy in Highlands being hampered by 'tax on geography' ".

===Hydrogen economy===
An innovative approach was proposed by [[BP]] in partnership with [[Scottish and Southern Energy]] for the creation of a hydrogen-based power station at [[Peterhead]]. The project would have taken natural gas extracted from the [[North Sea oil|North Sea]], [[cracking (chemistry)|crack]] the gas to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide, and burn the hydrogen as the fuel source to create electricity in a 475 MW power station. The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; would then have been returned to the Miller field reservoir more than {{convert|4|km|mi|0}} under the seabed in a process called carbon sequestration (see above). The scheme was expected to be in production by 2009 at a projected cost of $600&amp;nbsp;million, although it fell through as it failed to gain sufficient support from the UK government to enable this to occur. Had it been completed, the plant would have been the first industrial-scale, hydrogen power station in the world.&lt;ref name=BPPH /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;There are ongoing attempts to keep the project alive—see for example Perry, David (25 May 2007) "Last-ditch fight on to save green gas project". Aberdeen. ''Press and Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007 a joint venture was announced by the PURE Energy Centre and the Hjaltland Housing Association to create two “unplugged” hydrogen houses on a remote site in Eshaness, [[Northmavine]], in [[Shetland]]. The installation will involve two combined heat and power systems, wind turbines and a hydrogen fuel cell to heat the houses at times when the wind is not blowing. There is also the possibility of a hydrogen refuelling station 
at the site for hydrogen-powered cars. A spokesman for PURE said “Forty per cent of the world-wide population lives with no access to 
electricity and heat. The CHP scheme will provide these populations with such access. There will be no impact on the environment whatsoever. This is totally clean energy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hie.co.uk/HICEC/HICEC-News-Oct07.pdf "‘Unplugged Houses’ at Northmavine"] (pdf) (October 2007) ''Community Energy News No 6''. Dingwall. HICEC.

In 2013 [[Baron Wallace of Tankerness]] sided with liquidators [[KPMG]] who are arguing UK insolvency law has precedence over  Scottish environmental regulations. Wallace's position, taken "on behalf of the UK Government" is that the liquidators have the power to abandon environmental clean-up costs after the company with the responsibility for them has gone bust. KPMG estimates the liquidation of Scottish Coal will leave up to £30m that would be paid to creditor [[Lloyds Banking Group|Lloyds Bank]] rather go towards the restoration of disused mines in [[Ayrshire]] and [[Lanarkshire]]. Opponents of KPMG include the [[Scottish Government]], the [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency]], [[South Lanarkshire Council]] and [[East Ayrshire Council]].&lt;ref&gt;Vass, Stephen (11 August 2013) "Scots rules attacked by UK Government in clean-up battle over open-cast mines".

'''The Lexington Principles on the Rights of Detainees''' ('''Lexington Principles''') is a body of international '''[[due process]]''' principles that reflect the prevailing transnational norms in the area of detainee treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.wlu.edu/lexingtonprinciples |title=The Lexington Principles on the Rights of Detainees :: The Lexington Principles Project :: W&amp;L Law School |publisher=Law.wlu.edu |date=2009-04-01 |accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Lexington Principles''' were completed and published on April 1, 2009. The instrument consists of 45 principles and countless annotations prepared by the project's law student editorial board. A primary purpose of the drafters of the Lexington Principles was to assist the jurisprudential evolution of American constitutional due process standards after the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]'s decision in ''[[Boumediene v. Bush]]''. While each Principle is based on '''[[international law]]''', all provisions have been drafted to facilitate vertical norm internalization into the domestic legal system of the '''[[United States]]''' and other '''[[common law]]''' countries.

==History==

===Mission of the Lexington Principles Project===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The mission of the Lexington Principles Project is to engage the international community to clarify and strengthen transnational norms pertaining to due process of law and the treatment of persons detained on suspicion of terrorist activities, and to foster a common approach to these matters, in keeping with the recommendation of the 9/11 Commission on this subject.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lexington Principles Website, Mission Statement|url=http://law.wlu.edu/lexingtonprinciples/page.asp?pageid=760|publisher=Law.wlu.edu|accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The 9/11 Commission===
{{main|9/11 Commission}}
On July 22, 2004, the '''[[9/11 Commission]]''' issued its [[9/11 Commission Report|report]] on the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. In this report, the Commission made numerous recommendations to U.S. government officials on how to better defend the United States against the spread of [[international terrorism]]. In reference to detainee treatment standards, the Commission recommended that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"(t)he United States should engage its friends to develop a common coalition approach toward the detention and humane treatment of captured terrorists. New principles might draw upon Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions on the law of armed conflict. That article was specifically designed for those cases in which the usual laws of war did not apply. Its minimum standards are generally accepted throughout the world as customary international law.".&lt;ref&gt;The 9/11 Commission Report: Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, Ch 12 p 380&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[White House]] responded to the 9-11 Commission's recommendation with the following statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The United States has worked closely with its coalition partners regarding the detention and treatment of captured terrorists, and is open to exploring whether a "common coalition approach" is feasible and consistent with our national security.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White House Press Release, Bush Administration Actions Consistent with 9/11 Recommendations|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/07/20040730-18.html|publisher=Whitehouse.gov|accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Seventeen months later the 9/11 Commission met again to grade the government's progress on implementing each of the 41 recommendations detailed in its Report. The Commission gave an "F" to the Commission's recommendation regarding "Coalition Standards for Terrorist Detention.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Report on 9/11 Commission Recommendations, 1-Page Grade Sheet|date=December 5, 2005|url=http://www.9-11pdp.org/press/2005-12-05_summary.pdf|publisher=9-11pdp.org|accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To explain its issuance of a failing grade with respect to the government's compliance with this recommendation, the Commission stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The U.S. has not engaged in a common coalition approach to developing standards for detention and prosecution of captured terrorists. Indeed, U.S. treatment of detainees has elicited broad criticism, and makes it harder to build the necessary alliances to cooperate effectively with partners in a global war on terror.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Report on 9/11 Commission Recommendations, Page 7|date=December 5, 2005|url=http://www.9-11pdp.org/press/2005-12-05_report.pdf|publisher=9-11pdp.org|accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Washington and Lee University===
Several professors and alumni at '''[[Washington and Lee University]]''' sought to assist the process of implementing the 9/11 Commission's recommendation by initiating a scholarly dialogue between military practitioners and legal experts aimed at identifying the high end of prevailing transnational norms pertaining to detainee treatment. They created '''The Lexington Principles Project''' and began the lengthy process of research and analysis that culminated in the publication of the '''Draft Lexington Principles on the Rights of Detainees''' on September 25, 2008. These draft principles were approved and published in final form on April 1, 2009 along with student-edited annotations.

==Methodology==

===Codifying the Gold Standard in Transnational Detainee Treatment Standards===
The Lexington Principles Project's participants did not want simply to restate existing international norms. Many groups had already aptly performed that function and such an effort would have been redundant, and possibly even counterproductive to developing a universal approach to detainee treatment. The Lexington Principles Project therefore aimed to develop a progressive set of principles recognizing the highest standards set forth in international law and the domestic legal systems of foreign nations.

===Transnational Legal Process Approach===
To overcome the difficulties inherent in applying international law in domestic courts, the Lexington Principles Project structured its efforts in accordance with the theory of [[Transnational Legal Process]] developed by '''[[Harold Hongju Koh]]''', the Dean of '''[[Yale Law School]]'''. The Project's use of this approach was facilitated by the availability of the considerable transnational law resources of the '''[[Transnational Law Institute]]''' at '''[[Washington and Lee University School of Law]]'''.

===Due Process Paradigm===
The Transnational Legal Process approach required the group to focus on vertical process throughout all stages of norm definition. The result was the creation of an innovative conceptual framework based on the familiar common law due process paradigm. Accordingly, the bulk of detainee rights under international law are categorized into one of three groups:

# General Provisions
# Procedural Due Process
# Substantive Due Process

===Normative Translation===
The term "due process" is unique to common law legal systems, and is not generally found in the text of international human rights and humanitarian law treaties. Due process is a powerful concept at common law, so it was important for the Lexington Principles to be phrased in those terms. All of the transnational norms discovered during the lengthy research phase of the Lexington Principles Project needed to be translated into aspects of due process. This was accomplished by distilling all points of mutuality in the law governing detainee treatment under both international law and domestic U.S. law down to one central right: the right to physical liberty. Principle 1 of the Lexington Principles on the Rights of Detainees codified this right, and all other rights were drafted as essentially derivative of this central guarantee. 

'''Principle 1''' states, "Physical liberty is a fundamental human right and may not be denied to any person without due process of law.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Principle 1, The Lexington Principles on the Rights of Detainees (Draft Principles, September 25, 2008)|url=http://law.wlu.edu/lexingtonprinciples/page.asp?pageid=769|publisher=Law.wlu.edu|accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transnational Incorporation Doctrine===
The '''[[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|Transnational Incorporation Doctrine]]''', first developed for the Lexington Principles, asserts that there are some principles of international law that are so fundamental to accepted global standards of justice that they should be implied as part the right to '''[[due process of law]]''' under the '''[[Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]]'''. This is a new progressive theory that has yet to be adopted by the '''[[United States Supreme Court]]'''. The theory was constructed by the professors drafting the Lexington Principles as a means of offering modern judges a jurisprudential concept that could afford them the opportunity to recognize a host of modern human rights that have developed in legal systems around the world since the American Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791. This conceptual mechanism for transnational norm internalization, if adopted by the U.S. Supreme Court, would give progressive American judges the opportunity to protect individual liberty by incorporating into the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause a variety of new and emerging human rights protections that pertain to modern American life in the Information Age. Liberty rights associated with privacy and personal autonomy in cyberspace were inconceivable in 1791 during the drafting of the original Bill of Rights. The Transnational Incorporation Doctrine would provide a way for courts to modernize the rights all American citizens enjoy vis-a-vis their government without the need to amend the Constitution through the cumbersome process prescribed in Article V. The formal amendment process makes meaningful change practically impossible to achieve, which is why the Lexington Principles Project crafted this new mechanism to facilitate bringing Americans rights up to the highest transnational standards.

===Moving Beyond Nationality and Territoriality===
A significant ancillary consequence of the novel and still unadopted Transnational Incorporation Doctrine would be its effect on the rights afforded to non-United States persons under U.S. law. Presently, United States citizens and permanent residents are afforded full protection under the United States Constitution both at home and abroad, with limited exceptions. Persons who are not American citizens or permanent residents are afforded no protection under the U.S. Constitution outside of U.S. borders and substantially diminished rights while on U.S. soil. The Transnational Incorporation Doctrine, if adopted, would change the American understanding of Constitutional rights making them "human" rights rather than rights tied to nationality or territorial location. 

Support for this result comes from the emerging transnational trend toward '''[[universal jurisdiction|universality]]''' of [[international human rights law]]. Because international human rights are universal, the Transnational Incorporation Doctrine's new interpretation of the Fifth Amendment's '''[[Due Process Clause]]''' could result in universal application of all incorporated rights regardless of nationality or physical location. With respect to these newly domesticated transnational rights, former barriers to rights recognition based on [[nationality]] and [[territoriality]] would no longer affect applicability. Any rights incorporated through the Transnational Incorporation Doctrine would likely have to be universally afforded to all human beings by the '''[[U.S. government]]'''. 

These new transnational rights likely would not be nearly as extensive as those offered to U.S. citizens in the United States, but at a minimum they would ensure that the most fundamental due process rights are always afforded in all instances where a human being is detained by the U.S. government for any reason anywhere in the world.

[[File:The Lexington Principles on the Rights of Detainees.pdf|thumb|The Lexington Principles on the Rights of Detainees]]

===I. Part I: General Provisions===

====A. Section A: Fundamental Right to Physical Liberty and Due Process of Law====

=====1. Principle 1: Right to Physical Liberty and Due Process of Law=====
Physical liberty is a fundamental human right and may not be denied to any person without due process of law.

====B. Section B: Scope of Application====

=====2. Principle 2: General Statement of Universal Applicability=====
The fundamental protections inherent in the right to due process of law are universal and apply in all situations where a person has been detained by a State or its agents regardless of the reasons for, or circumstances surrounding, the detention.

=====3. Principle 3: Irrelevance of Geography=====
The fundamental protections inherent in the right to due process of law are universal and should be afforded to all persons detained by a State or its agents without regard to the location of capture or detention.

=====4. Principle 4: Nondiscrimination=====
The fundamental protections inherent in the right to due process of law are universal and should be afforded to all persons detained by a State or its agents without regard to nationality, national origin, ethnic origin, race, color, descent, language, religion, faith, sex, age, birth, parentage, wealth, or any other such criteria.

====C. Section C: State Responsibility====

=====5. Principle 5: General Statement of State Responsibility to Protect=====
Each State has the responsibility to protect the right to physical liberty for all persons within its territory or otherwise under its control except insofar as they are properly detained in accordance with Principle 1.

=====6. Principle 6: Commencement of State Responsibility to Protect=====
At a minimum, a State's responsibility to protect the due process rights of a person begins at the moment the person is detained by its agents.

=====7. Principle 7: Duration of State Responsibility to Protect=====
Once initiated, a State's responsibility to protect the due process rights of a person continues until that individuals physical liberty is ultimately restored.

=====8. Principle 8: State Responsibility to Protect upon Transfer=====
Transfer of a Person to the custody of another State does not terminate the transferring States responsibility to protect the rights of the transferee. The transferring State should maintain an active interest in the rights of the transferee and seek periodic assurances that due process rights are continuously afforded until the transferees physical liberty is ultimately restored.

====D. Section D: International Obligation====

=====9. Principle 9: Statement of Universal Concern=====
A State's compliance with its responsibility to protect the fundamental rights of persons it deprives of physical liberty is a concern of humankind and therefore should be of interest to all members of the international community.

====E. Section E: Relationship to Other Laws====

=====10. Principle 10: Rules of Construction=====
These Principles should not be construed to diminish any human right or protection afforded by any other source of law.

===II. Part II: Procedural Due Process===

====A. Section A: General Statement of Procedural Rights====

=====11. Principle 11: Right to Procedural Due Process=====
Procedural due process is a human right requiring that all persons be afforded notice of, and an opportunity to challenge, any State action substantially affecting their fundamental right to physical liberty in a fair and public hearing before an impartial adjudicator with the independent authority to remedy violations through direct action and without undue restrictions.

=====12. Principle 12: Prohibition of Extralegal Arrest and Detention=====
Due process requires that no deprivation of liberty occur outside of a legal process designed and equipped to assess the legality of the deprivation before, after, and during the period of detention.

=====13. Principle 13: Prohibition of Extralegal Rendition=====
No State should subject any person to nonconsensual transfer from one national jurisdiction to another unless such transfer is performed pursuant to judicial process.

====B. Section B: Notice====

=====14. Principle 14: Notice of Reasons for Deprivation and Procedural Rights=====
When a State substantially impairs the right to physical liberty of any person it should provide that person with effective written notice of the reasons for the impairment and the procedural mechanisms through which the person may challenge the deprivation.

=====15. Principle 15: Sufficiency of Notice=====
The required notice should be sufficient to inform the person of the laws authorizing the impairment and the nature of the evidence justifying its use in the specific case, described with sufficient particularity to allow the person to evaluate the factual and legal basis for the deprivation. If full disclosure of the evidence underlying the factual basis for the detention would result in a substantial risk of harm to individuals or national security, the detainee may be informed of the general nature of the States justification for the detention sufficient to allow the detainee to communicate relevant information to the detaining authorities which might assist them in determining whether continued detention is justified.

====C. Section C: Opportunity to be Heard====

=====16. Principle 16: Right to Challenge Substantial Deprivations=====
All persons should have the right to challenge any substantial State deprivations of their right to physical liberty before a fair and impartial decision maker with the authority to remedy undue infringements without unnecessary delay.

=====17. Principle 17: Right to Presumption of Innocence in Criminal Hearings=====
All persons charged with a criminal offense should be presumed innocent until proven guilty through an adjudicative process conducted in accordance with the requirements of due process.

All persons should be afforded the opportunity to participate in legal proceedings adjudicating matters directly affecting their right to physical liberty.

=====19. Principle 19: Right to Counsel=====
All persons should be afforded the opportunity to consult legal counsel before and during legal proceedings adjudicating matters pertaining to substantial deprivations of their right to physical liberty.

====D. Section D: Fair and Impartial Decision Maker====

=====20. Principle 20: Composition of Adjudicative Mechanism=====
Decision makers charged with adjudicating matters affecting a person's fundamental rights should be impartial and adequately educated to properly perform that function.

=====21. Principle 21: Right of Adjudicators to Report Suspected Abuses=====
Adjudicators should have the means to report their concerns regarding suspected rights violations to appropriate authorities outside of the control of the governmental entity suspected of committing the violations.

===III. Part III: Substantive Due Process===

====A. Section A: General Statement of Substantive Rights====

=====22. Principle 22: Right to Substantive Due Process=====
Implicit in the fundamental right to due process of law is the requirement that no State should deprive any person of life, liberty, or security of person in violation of any right fundamental to accepted principles of global justice.

====B. Section B: Prohibition of Arbitrary Deprivations of Physical Liberty====

=====23. Principle 23: Prohibition of Arbitrary Arrest and Detention=====
No State should arrest or detain any person for reasons that are arbitrary. An arrest or detention is arbitrary if it is not performed pursuant to law or if it is incompatible with the fundamental principles of global justice.

=====24. Principle 24: Right to the Rule of Law=====
No person should be deprived of the right to physical liberty except pursuant to the rule of law. State actors should never deprive any person of physical liberty except pursuant to specific and demonstrable legal authority governed by written laws and procedures.

=====25. Principle 25: Prohibition of Detention Based on the Exercise of Fundamental Rights=====
No State should detain any person based solely on that persons exercise of a fundamental human right.

=====26. Principle 26: Prohibition of Detention Based on Discriminatory Animus=====
No State should detain any person based solely on that persons nationality, national origin, ethnic origin, race, color, descent, language, religion, faith, sex, age, birth, parentage, wealth, or any similar criteria.

=====27. Principle 27: Prohibition of Ex Post Facto Application of Penal Law=====
No State should try any person for a penal offense based on acts or omissions which did not constitute a penal offense at the time they were committed.

=====28. Principle 28: Prohibition of Double Jeopardy=====
No State should detain, try, or punish any person for an offence for which the person has already been finally convicted or acquitted.

=====29. Principle 29: Prohibition of Deprivations Based on the Actions of Third Parties=====
No State should deprive any person of liberty based solely on the alleged or actual wrongdoing of a third party.

=====30. Principle 30: Prohibition of Indefinite Non-Punitive Detention=====
Extrajudicial detention beyond the time necessary to serve a compelling and current state objective is inconsistent with the principles of due process. No State should detain any person outside the judicial process unless such detention is conducted in accordance with substantial procedural safeguards narrowly tailored to ensure the detention is strictly limited to the time necessary to serve a compelling and current state objective.

=====31. Principle 31: Right to Repatriation Following Detention=====
All persons should be afforded the right to return to their country of nationality or citizenship upon the cessation of detention by a foreign State.

====C. Section C: Prohibition of Incommunicado Detention====

=====32. Principle 32: Prohibition of Incommunicado Detention=====
Prolonged incommunicado detention is incompatible with the substantive liberty guarantees inherent in the fundamental right to due process of law.

=====33. Principle 33: Right to Communicate with Relatives=====
Persons subjected to prolonged detention should be allowed to communicate with their family at regular intervals, subject to the supervision of the detaining authorities, unless the State demonstrates that the denial of such communication is necessary based on a demonstrable risk to national security or the safety of any person.

=====34. Principle 34: Right to Communicate with Diplomatic or Consular Representatives=====
All persons deprived of their liberty by the government of a foreign State should be allowed reasonable opportunities to communicate with the diplomatic or consular representatives of their home State as soon as practicable after the deprivation and periodically throughout the period of detention as needed to ensure they are afforded the full benefits of the protections guaranteed to foreign nationals under international law.

All persons who are refugees, stateless persons, or nationals of States without diplomatic or consular representation in the detaining State should be allowed reasonable opportunities to communicate with the diplomatic and consular representatives of the State which takes charge of their interests or any national or international authority whose task it is to protect such persons.

=====35. Principle 35: Right to Unmonitored Communication with Physicians=====
All persons subjected to prolonged deprivations of liberty should be afforded the right to periodic unmonitored communications with the physicians charged with providing their medical care in order to allow the disclosure of allegations of abuse by the detaining authorities.

=====36. Principle 36: Right of Physicians to Report Suspected Rights Violations=====
Physicians charged with providing medical care for persons deprived of their liberty should be afforded a mechanism for disclosure of suspected detainee abuse to an authority outside the control of the entity committing the abuse, under conditions affording the physician adequate protection against retribution.

=====37. Principle 37: Right to Information about the Outside World=====
All persons deprived of their liberty for an extended time should be given regular access to periodicals, books, educational materials, audio programs, writing materials, and other such items intended to keep them mentally engaged, informed of world events, and to allow them to make productive use of their time while in detention.

=====38. Principle 38: Right of Public Access to Facility Procedures=====
A detaining State should make the general procedures governing the operation of its detention facilities available to the public. Sensitive security information may be exempted from public disclosure, although such procedures should be subject to review through an independent mechanism within the detaining government.

=====39. Principle 39: Rights of Relief Organizations to Inspect Prisoners and Facilities=====
No State should unduly restrict the ability of the International Committee of the Red Cross and other appropriate relief organizations to inspect detention facilities and to engage in unmonitored communication with individual detainees for the purpose of monitoring the States compliance with its responsibility to protect the fundamental rights of detainees under its control.

====D. Section D: Prohibition of Offenses to Personal Welfare and Human Dignity====

=====40. Principle 40: Prohibition of Grave Breaches=====
No State should subject any person to torture, cruel treatment, biological experiments, murder, mutilation, maiming, rape, sexual abuse, or the intentional infliction of serious bodily or psychological injury.

=====41. Principle 41: Prohibition of Extra-Legal Interrogation Methods=====
No State should interrogate any person employing methods that have not been approved for use by law.

=====42. Principle 42: Duty to Maintain Records of Physical Interrogations=====
A State employing physical interrogation methods on any person should be required to maintain records detailing the specific dates, times, and duration of each physical interrogation session and specifying all of the physical methods employed together with the written legal authorization approving their use. Such records should be maintained for a period of fifty years, and destruction of such records should be a criminal offense.

=====43. Principle 43: Right of Access to Records of Physical Interrogations=====
All persons subjected to physical interrogation methods by a State should be given full access to the records pertaining to such interrogations.

=====44. Principle 44: Right to Adequate Healthcare, Nutrition, and Exercise=====
All persons deprived of their liberty should be afforded adequate healthcare, nutrition, and opportunities for physical exercise necessary for the maintenance of both physical and mental fitness during the period of detention.

=====45. Principle 45: Right to Religious Observance=====
All persons deprived of their liberty should be afforded reasonable accommodations necessary to permit religious observance in accordance with the tenets of their faith or dictates of their conscience.

'''Washing out mouth with soap''' is a traditional form of [[physical punishment]] that consists in placing [[soap]], or a similar cleansing agent, inside a person's mouth so that the person will taste it, inducing what most people consider an unpleasant experience.  This form of punishment was especially common in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] from the late 19th century through the 1960s.

Washing out mouth with soap is most often used as a response to [[profanity]], [[Lie|lying]], [[biting]],&lt;ref&gt;Old Remedy Not Advised. Portsmouth Daily Times - May 3, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; [[tobacco use]], or verbal disrespect. It functions both as a symbolic "cleansing" following the infraction, as well as acting as a deterrent due to the foul [[aftertaste]]. It is commonly used as [[child discipline]] or [[school discipline]], and is more frequently employed by mothers than fathers.&lt;ref&gt;Dimensions of discipline by fathers and mothers as recalled by university students http://gauss.unh.edu/~mas2/DD03%20Draft%20D9.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407082144/http://gauss.unh.edu/~mas2/DD03%20Draft%20D9.pdf |date=2014-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This punishment still has advocates today, even though its use has diminished considerably in recent years in favour of [[discipline]] methods that are not considered [[violence|violent]] or [[humiliation|humiliating]]. Additionally, ingestion of [[soap]]s and [[detergent]]s can have potentially serious health consequences, and persons utilizing this form of punishment may face legal sanctions.

==Technique==
Washing out mouth with soap is essentially defined by the introduction of soap, or a soap-like cleansing agent, into the [[oral cavity]].  Methods commonly used for this purpose include placing a bar of soap in a person's mouth and forcing them to hold it there, chew it, and/or swallow it; forcing a person to drink liquid soap or another liquid cleanser or to swish such liquids in their mouth; and using a toothbrush to brush the used cleaning product onto a person's teeth and oral tissues.

===Safety===
Washing out mouth with soap is meant to be unpleasant, but is usually not intended to cause death or serious harm.  Nonetheless, many people employ the aforementioned techniques with extremely limited knowledge regarding the safety of ingesting their chosen cleansing agents.  Agents likely to cause serious harm if swallowed include many [[automatic dishwasher detergent]]s and [[laundry detergent]]s.  Even ordinary bar soaps and liquid hand soaps may cause harmful effects including [[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]], irritation of the lining of the mouth and [[digestive tract]], and in rare instances, [[pulmonary aspiration]].  This is especially true if these products are ingested in large quantities.

==History==
{{rquote|left|A friend of mine was horrified one day by hearing her little boy make use of a very bad word [...] Turning to the maid she said, "Jane, you may take Master Dick up stairs and wash his mouth out with soap and water. It is too soiled for him to sit at the table with us..."|[[Good Housekeeping]], 1889&lt;ref&gt;Good Housekeeping: Volume 9 - Page 276. 1889&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One of the earliest recorded uses of forcing another to ingest soap as punishment appeared in the 1832 [[Legal Examiner]], in which it was noted that a married couple "were constantly quarrelling ; and that one evening, on the man's return home, he found his wife intoxicated, [...] perceiving a piece of kitchen soap lying on the ground near the spot, he crammed it into his wife's mouth, saying, "She has had plenty of water to wash with, she ought now to have a little soap".&lt;ref&gt;The Legal examiner: Volume 1 - Page 508. Great Britain. Courts - 1832&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1860s, the periodical [[Aunt Judy's Annual Volume]] featured the main characters forced to eat a bar of soap as punishment for constantly failing to wash up, as the [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] to a story entitled "Scaramouches at School".&lt;ref&gt;Volume 6, Issue 32 (Aunt Judy's Annual Volume)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872, [[The Chinese Recorder and Missionary Journal]] stated that the practice of washing out the mouth of a child heard to swear was noted by an American colleague, and should be recommended to colleagues in the Orient as well.&lt;ref&gt;The Chinese recorder and missionary journal - Page 452. ''A friend of the writer in America called into the bath room a little son who was heard for the first time to swear, and scrubbed his mouth out with soap and a nail brush''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873, a schoolmistress in [[Mahaska County, Iowa|Mahaska, Iowa]] was noted to have punished a boy in her class for indulging in [[chewing tobacco]] by washing his mouth out with soap.&lt;ref&gt;The New York State educational journal: devoted to popular ...: Volumes 2-3 - Page 607books.google.comO. R. Burchard, New York State Teachers Association - 1873&lt;/ref&gt;  Much later examples tell how [[Filipino people|Filipino]] or [[Lakota people|Lakota]] aboriginals were punished for speaking their native language with a similar punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Styles of speaking: an analysis of Lakota communication alternatives ES Grobsmith - Anthropological Linguistics, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Man in the Outhouse: How Western Colonization Silenced the Filipino Imagination. P Abarquez-Delacruz - Amerasia Journal, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

An 1898 "study in moral education", published by the [[Journal of Genetic Psychology]], noted that whipping, withdrawal of privileges, lectures, being sent alone to a room and washing out a subject's mouth with either soap, salt or pepper, were the most likely punishments to deter future abuses.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of genetic psychology: Volume 5. [[Granville Stanley Hall]], [[Carl Allanmore Murchison]] - 1898&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, a New York State Department of Social Welfare officer submitted a complaint against the [[Rochester Orphan Asylum]] noting that "I find, as charged, that children's mouths have been washed with soap-suds, but not, as also charged, with ashes and water; that such punishments were ordered for obscene or profane language".&lt;ref&gt;Report. New York (State). Dept. of Social Welfare - 1890&lt;/ref&gt; By the start of the 20th century, the practice was also noted at the [[Maryland State Reformatory for Women]] as punishment for any infraction of the rules.&lt;ref&gt;Initiated Water Cure. The Sun (1837-1985) - Baltimore, Md. Date: Dec 21, 1919&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s, washing out mouth with soap was a [[hazing ritual]] in the British [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalnavyresearcharchive.org.uk/SLINGER/SLING-1.HTM|title=Birth of SLINGER|website=www.royalnavyresearcharchive.org.uk|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, several American schoolboards ruled in favour of washing out a pupil's mouth with soap as a legitimate punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Washing Mouth With Soap Ruled Okay .St. Petersburg Times - Dec 14, 1955&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mouth-Washing Of Pupil Seen As Not Violating School Policy -Hartford Courant - Apr 29, 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, Wisconsin judge Harvey L. Neelan fined a Miss Mertz $25 for her drunken obscenities and noted that she should be required to wash her mouth with soap.&lt;ref&gt;The Milwaukee Journal - Jan 16, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1963, Michigan judge Francis Castellucci ordered Louis Winiarski, who had been found using obscene language around women and children, to wash his mouth with soap before leaving the courtroom.&lt;ref&gt;Kentucky New Era - Jul 10, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; A similar case in October 1979 saw a New York resident choose to wash his mouth out with soap, rather than serve ten days in prison for his disorderly conduct and obscenities.&lt;ref&gt;The Press-Courier - Oct 19, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, the [[National Criminal Justice Reference System]] published a report defending the use of corporal punishment in schools, in which a school administrator noted that he documented 200 cases, over his 13-year career, of using corporal punishmenting, noting "That's not just using paddles in every instance, but if you shake a student, if you grab a student, if you wash a student's mouth out with soap, that's corporal punishment under the definition of the law".&lt;ref&gt;A practical defense of corporal punishment in the schools[PDF] from ncjrs.govLK Reinholz - Hyman, IA, &amp; Wise, JH (1979). Corporal punishment in schools, 1977. https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/51400NCJRS.pdf#page=37&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the [[Journal of Youth and Adolescence]] listed the practise, alongside [[Paddle (spanking)|paddling]] and [[hairpulling]] as a "moderate" punishment for children, beneath the realm of "severe" punishment such as [[Flagellation|whipping]].&lt;ref&gt;Corporal punishment: Normative data and sociological and psychological correlates in a community college population. JW Bryan… - Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly in 1996, the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] classified it as an alternative to [[spanking]].&lt;ref&gt;A review of the outcomes of parental use of nonabusive or customary physical punishment. RE Larzelere - Pediatrics, 1996 - Am Acad Pediatrics&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, students at the [[Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts]] carried out a [[peer-reviewed]] study on the ability of punishment to curb the use of profanity by interviewing colleagues on their remembered upbringings, and noted that the most commonly reported parental reaction was a verbal reprimand (41%). Soap in the mouth was mentioned in 20% of the episodes, and physical punishments were described in 14%.&lt;ref&gt;Memories of punishment for cursing. T Jay, K King… - Sex roles, 2006 www.mcla.edu/Undergraduate/uploads/textWidget/1457.00013/documents/tj_mem_punish.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal ramifications==

In [[computational science]], '''wildfire modeling''' is concerned with [[numerical weather prediction|numerical simulation]] of [[wildland fire]]s in order to understand and predict fire behavior. Wildfire modeling can ultimately aid [[wildland fire suppression]], namely increase safety of [[firefighter]]s and the public, reduce risk, and minimize damage. Wildfire modeling can also aid in protecting [[ecosystem]]s, [[Drainage basin|watershed]]s, and [[air quality]].

==Objectives of wildfire modeling==

Wildfire modeling attempts to reproduce fire behavior, such as how quickly the fire spreads, in which direction, how much heat it generates. A key input to behavior modeling is the [[Fuel model|Fuel Model]], or type of fuel, through which the fire is burning.  Behavior modeling can also include whether the fire transitions from the surface (a "surface fire") to the tree crowns (a "crown fire"), as well as extreme fire behavior including rapid rates of spread, [[fire whirl]]s, and tall well-developed convection columns. Fire modeling also attempts to estimate fire effects, such as the [[ecology|ecological]] and [[hydrology|hydrological]] effects of the fire, fuel consumption, tree mortality, and amount and rate of smoke produced.

==Environmental factors==

Wildland fire behavior is affected by [[weather]], [[fuel]] characteristics, and [[topography]].

Weather influences fire through [[wind]] and [[moisture]].  [[Wind]] increases the fire spread in the wind direction, higher [[temperature]] makes the fire burn faster, while higher [[relative humidity]], and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] (rain or snow) may slow it down or extinguish it altogether. Weather involving fast wind changes can be particularly dangerous, since they can suddenly change the fire direction and behavior. Such weather includes [[cold front]]s, [[foehn wind]]s, [[thunderstorm]] [[downdrafts]], [[sea breeze|sea and land breeze]], and [[Daytime (astronomy)|diurnal]] [[slope wind]]s.

Wildfire fuel includes grass, wood, and anything else that can burn. Small dry twigs burn faster while large logs burn slower; dry fuel ignites more easily and burns faster than wet fuel.

Topography factors that influence wildfires include the orientation toward the sun, which influences the amount of energy received from the sun, and the slope (fire spreads faster uphill). Fire can accelerate in narrow canyons and it can be slowed down or stopped by barriers such as creeks and roads.

These factors act in combination. Rain or snow increases the fuel moisture, high [[relative humidity]] slows the drying of the fuel, while winds can make fuel dry faster. Wind can change the fire-accelerating effect of slopes to effects such as downslope windstorms (called [[Santa Ana winds|Santa Ana]]s, foehn winds, East winds, depending on the geographic location). Fuel properties may vary with topography as plant density varies with elevation or aspect with respect to the sun.

It has long been recognized that "fires create their own weather." That is, the heat and moisture created by the fire feed back into the atmosphere, creating intense winds that drive the fire behavior. The heat produced by the wildfire changes the temperature of the atmosphere and creates strong updrafts, which can change the direction of surface winds. The water vapor released by the fire changes the moisture balance of the atmosphere. The water vapor can be carried away, where the [[latent heat]] stored in the vapor is released through [[condensation]].

==Approaches to fire modeling==

Like all models in computational science, fire models need to strike a balance between fidelity, availability of data, and fast execution. Wildland fire models span a vast range of complexity, from simple cause and effect principles to the most physically complex presenting a difficult supercomputing challenge that cannot hope to be solved faster than real time.

[[Forest-fire model]]s have been developed since 1940 to the present, but a lot of chemical and thermodynamic questions related to fire behaviour are still to be resolved. Scientists and their forest fire models from 1940 till 2003 are listed in article.&lt;ref&gt;E. Pastor, L. Zarate, E. Planas and J. Arnaldos. Mathematical models and calculation systems for the study of wildland fire behaviour. Progress in Energy and Combustion Science, 29:139–153, 2003.  Doi:10.1016/S0360-1285(03)00017-0)&lt;/ref&gt; Models can be divided into three groups: Empirical, Semi-empirical, and Physically based.

===Empirical models===

Conceptual models from experience and intuition from past fires can be used to anticipate the future. Many semi-empirical fire spread equations, as in those published by the USDA Forest Service,&lt;ref name="Rothermel-1972-MMP"&gt;Richard C. Rothermel.

Certain assumptions must be made in models such as FARSITE and Prometheus to shape the fire growth. For example, Prometheus and FARSITE use the Huygens principle of wave propagation. A set of equations that can be used to propagate (shape and direction) a fire front using an elliptical shape was developed by Richards in 1990.&lt;ref name="Richards-1990-EGM"&gt;G.D. Richards, “An Elliptical Growth Model of Forest Fire Fronts and Its Numerical Solution”, Int. J. Numer. Meth. Eng.,. 30:1163-1179, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Although more sophisticated applications use a three-dimensional numerical weather prediction system to provide inputs such as wind velocity to one of the fire growth models listed above, the input was passive and the feedback of the fire upon the atmospheric wind and humidity are not accounted for.

===Physically based models and coupling with the atmosphere===

A simplified physically based two-dimensional fire spread models based upon conservation laws that use radiation as the dominant heat transfer mechanism and convection, which represents the effect of wind and slope, lead to [[reaction–diffusion system]]s of [[partial differential equation]]s.&lt;ref name="Asensio-2002-WFM"&gt;M.

The cost of added physical complexity is a corresponding increase in computational cost, so much so that a full three-dimensional explicit treatment of [[combustion]] in wildland fuels by [[direct numerical simulation]] (DNS) at scales relevant for atmospheric modeling does not exist, is beyond current supercomputers, and does not currently make sense to do because of the limited skill of weather models at spatial resolution under 1&amp;nbsp;km. Consequently, even these more complex models parameterize the fire in some way, for example, papers by Clark&lt;ref name="Clark-1996-CAFb"&gt;T. L. Clark, M. A. Jenkins, J. Coen, and David Packham. A coupled atmospheric-fire model: Convective Froude number and dynamic fingering. ''International Journal of Wildland Fire'', 6:177--190, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark-1996-CAF"&gt;Terry L. Clark, Marry Ann Jenkins, Janice Coen, and David Packham. A coupled atmospheric-fire model: Convective feedback on fire line dynamics. ''J. Appl. Meteor'', 35:875--901, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; use equations developed by Rothermel for the USDA forest service&lt;ref name="Rothermel-1972-MMP"/&gt; to calculate local fire spread rates using fire-modified local winds. And, although FIRETEC and WFDS carry prognostic conservation equations for the reacting fuel and oxygen concentrations, the computational grid cannot be fine enough to resolve the reaction rate-limiting mixing of fuel and oxygen, so approximations must be made concerning the subgrid-scale temperature distribution or the combustion reaction rates themselves. These models also are too small-scale to interact with a weather model, so the fluid motions use a computational fluid dynamics model confined in a box much smaller than the typical wildfire.

Attempts to create the most complete theoretical model were made by Albini F.A. in USA and Grishin A.M.&lt;ref&gt;A.M. Grishin. Mathematical models of forest fires and New Methods of Fighting Them. Publishing House of the Tomsk University, Tomsk, Russia, 1997. (edited by F.A. Albini)&lt;/ref&gt; in Russia. Grishin's work is based on the fundamental laws of physics, conservation and theoretical justifications are provided. The simplified two-dimensional model of running crown forest fire was developed in [[Belarusian State University]] by Barovik D.V.&lt;ref&gt;Barovik, D.; Taranchuk, V. 2010. Mathematical modelling of running crown forest fires. Mathematical Modelling and Analysis 15(2):161-174 [http://elib.bsu.by/bitstream/123456789/10110/1/TVB_2010.pdf fulltext]&lt;/ref&gt; and Taranchuk V.B..

==Data assimilation==

[[Data assimilation]] periodically adjusts the model state to incorporate new data using statistical methods. Because fire is highly nonlinear and irreversible, data assimilation for fire models poses special challenges, and standard methods, such as the [[ensemble Kalman filter]] (EnKF) do not work well. Statistical variability of corrections and especially large corrections may result in nonphysical states, which tend to be preceded or accompanied by large spatial [[gradient]]s. In order to ease this problem, the [[Regularization (mathematics)|regularized]] EnKF&lt;ref name="Johns-2008-TEK"&gt;Craig J. Johns and Jan Mandel. A two-stage ensemble Kalman filter for smooth data assimilation. ''Environmental and Ecological Statistics'', 15:101--110, 2008. Proceedings of Conference on New Developments of Statistical Analysis in Wildlife, Fisheries, and Ecological Research, Oct 13-16, 2004, Columbia, MI. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10651-007-0033-0 fulltext] [http://math.ucdenver.edu/~jmandel/papers/cjjm-fires-revised.pdf preprint]&lt;/ref&gt; penalizes large changes of spatial gradients in the Bayesian update in EnKF. The regularization technique has a stabilizing effect on the simulations in the ensemble but it does not improve much the ability of the EnKF to track the data: The posterior ensemble is made out of [[linear combination]]s of the prior ensemble, and if a reasonably close location and shape of the fire cannot be found between the linear combinations, the data assimilation is simply out of luck, and the ensemble cannot approach the data. From that point on, the ensemble evolves essentially without regard to the data. This is called filter divergence. So, there is clearly a need to adjust the simulation state by a position change rather than an additive correction only. The ''morphing EnKF''&lt;ref name="Beezley-2008-MEK"&gt;Jonathan D. Beezley and Jan Mandel. Morphing ensemble Kalman filters. ''Tellus'', 60A:131--140, 2008 [https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0870.2007.00275.x fulltext] [https://arxiv.org/abs/0705.3693 preprint]&lt;/ref&gt; combines the ideas of data assimilation with [[image registration]] and [[morphing]] to provide both additive and position correction in a natural manner, and can be used to change a model state reliably in response to data.&lt;ref name="Mandel-2007-DAW"/&gt;

==Limitations and practical use==

The limitations on fire modeling are not entirely computational. At this level, the models encounter limits in knowledge about the composition of [[pyrolysis]] products and [[reaction pathway]]s, in addition to gaps in basic understanding about some aspects of fire behavior such as fire spread in live fuels and surface-to-crown fire transition.

Thus, while more complex models have value in studying fire behavior and testing fire spread in a range of scenarios, from the application point of view, FARSITE and [[Palm (PDA)|Palm]]-based applications of BEHAVE have shown great utility as practical in-the-field tools because of their ability to provide estimates of fire behavior in real time. While the coupled fire-atmosphere models have the ability to incorporate the ability of the fire to affect its own local weather, and model many aspects of the explosive, unsteady nature of fires that cannot be incorporated in current tools, it remains a challenge to apply these more complex models in a faster-than-real-time operational environment. Also, although they have reached a certain degree of realism when simulating specific natural fires, they must yet address issues such as identifying what specific, relevant operational information they could provide beyond current tools, how the simulation time could fit the operational time frame for decisions (therefore, the simulation must run substantially faster than real time), what temporal and spatial resolution must be used by the model, and how they estimate the inherent uncertainty in numerical weather prediction in their forecast. These operational constraints must be used to steer model development.

[[File:Wish list.jpg|thumb|A child's Christmas wish list from 1990]]
A '''wish list''' or '''want list''' is an itemization of goods or services that a person or organization desires. The author may distribute copies of their list to family, friends, and other [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s who are likely to purchase gifts for the would-be recipient, or to offer some of the listed items for sale. The goal of a wish list is to facilitate communication between the gift receiver and the gift giver. Wish lists often contain items that a gift purchaser can obtain from a variety of retailers.  Some wish lists are specialized for particular purposes or concentrated at individual retailers, such as [[gift registry|gift registries]] (e.g., [[bridal registry|bridal registries]]).

==Occasions==
In some cultures, people often exchange wish lists before major holidays that include gift giving, such as [[Christmas]] and [[birthday]]s. Other common occasions for issuing wish lists include [[baby shower]]s, [[housewarming party|housewarming]]s, [[wedding]]s, and [[drive (charity)|charity drives]].

== Types ==

* A [[gift registry]] is a type of wish list that contains only items that can be purchased at the store which manages the registry.
* An online wish list is a type of wish list that is hosted on the Internet. Online wish lists can be associated with a retailer or universal. 
* A product wish list is similar to a list of functional [[requirement]]s. The difference is mainly the importance of the requested functionality. Items that might be on the wish list at one time may be expected to be requirements later.
* A software user wishlist is a type of wish list that is created by the software manufacturer (such as the software development company or the website owner) or by user groups.
* A "bucket list" is a type of personal wish list consisting of things a person wishes to do before they die (e.g., "[[kick the bucket]]") or before they reach a life stage milestone (e.g., the end of childhood; the end of high school, etc.)

==Online==
An online wish list typically allows a registered user to create a wish list, add wishes to it and then spread a link to the wish list via email or social media like [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]]. Visitors to the published wish list can in most cases comment wishes and reserve them. This adds a collaborative perspective among the viewers that would be much harder to achieve for analog wish lists. Online wish lists on retailer websites allow you to save items you prefer from that retailer's site for future reference. Universal online wish lists allow you to add items from multiple retailers and even non-retail ideas &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Online Wish List Best Practices |url=https://www.dreamlist.com/best/ |website=DreamList.com |accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Software users==
Software user wish lists are a compilation of user suggestions for requested features. Many enterprise websites and software packages offer users the option to add a "wish" - a suggestion for improvement or change - and to vote on the importance of suggestions supplied by the publisher or author of the website or software, and they attempt to give a quick response to the suggestions.  For example, [[Microsoft Visual Studio]] has a "community" menu, and [[Facebook]] has a "suggestions" section.

In many cases, when a company fails to supply such a framework, users create their own lists, in [[Internet forum]]s or in [[blog]]s. When such a list becomes popular, the company must respond to the common requests.

Having software user wish lists has become popular since 2007 when a football gaming community FIFPlay started collecting fans wishlist for [[Electronic Arts]] for pre-development of [[FIFA (video game series)]] and it has collected over 10,000 ideas and suggestions for [[FIFA 08]].

'''Women's Global Network for Reproductive Rights''' (WGNRR) is an international [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) that advocates for sexual and [[reproductive health]] and rights worldwide. Based in the Global South, they are a membership-driven organization that "works within the rights, justice and [[feminist]] frameworks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WGNRR: Vision, Mission and Values|url=http://www.wgnrr.org/who-we-are|publisher=WGNRR|accessdate=June 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; WGNRR works towards the realization of the full sexual and reproductive health and rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.defendingwomen-defendingrights.org/about/members/womens-global-network-for-reproductive-rights/|title=Women’s Global Network for Reproductive Rights {{!}}|website=www.defendingwomen-defendingrights.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; WGNRR has consultative status with [[ECOSOC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NGO Branch: UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs|url=http://esango.un.org/civilsociety/showProfileDetail.do?method=showProfileDetails&amp;profileCode=603827|publisher=ECOSOC|accessdate=June 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

WGNRR was founded at the fourth International Women and Health Meeting in 1984.&lt;ref name="cccg.umontreal"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Estrada-Claudio|first=Sylvia|title=THE INTERNATIONAL WOMEN AND HEALTH MEETINGS:  CATALYST AND END PRODUCT OF THE  GLOBAL FEMINIST HEALTH MOVEMENT|date=April 26, 2006|url=http://www.cccg.umontreal.ca/pdf/Sylvia%20Estrada-Claudio_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was themed "No to Population Control... Women Decide!" and saw the formation of other important international networks including Women Living Under Muslim Laws (WLUML) and Latin American Women and Health Network.&lt;ref name="cccg.umontreal" /&gt; In 1987, at another IWHM conference, WGNRR partnered with the Latin America and Caribbean Women’s Health Network to launch a campaign addressing maternal mortality and declared May 28 the International Day of Action for Women's Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Portugal|first=Ana Maria|title=Highlights of the Latin American and Caribbean Women's Health Movement|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0MDX/is_2-3_2004/ai_n27847398/|accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using human rights to improve maternal and neonatal health: history, connections and a proposed practical approach|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/8/07-050500/en/index.html|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=June 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; WGNRR was an active participant in the International Conference “Reinforcing Reproductive Rights”, held in Madras, India in 1993. It was this year that WGNRR began campaigning for safe and legal [[abortion]].&lt;ref name="wgnrr"&gt;{{cite web|title=WGNRR: History|url=http://www.wgnrr.org/history|accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; WGNRR's position on abortion was critical during the [[International Conference on Population and Development]] (ICPD) in 1994. According to their website, "WGNRR was part of a coalition – the Women’s Alliance – to ensure that women’s voices were heard and represented at the conference. that protested the population control theories that abounded at the time. WGNRR was also involved in workshops protesting the use of anti-fertility “vaccines”.  WGNRR’s support of the ICPD’s inclusion of right to access of safe abortion was still tempered by its concern over the language and the fear of the misuse of such a document by proponents of coerced population control."&lt;ref name="wgnrr" /&gt; In 1995, WGNRR undertook campaigns to address the [[feminisation of poverty]] and was an active participant in the development of the [[Programme of Action]] for the Women’s World Conference in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/pad.305 | volume=24 | title=Interpreting reproductive rights: institutional responses to the agenda in the 1990s | journal=Public Administration and Development | pages=41–50 | last1 = Xiaoquan Zhang | first1 = Heather}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Cairo Consensus, WGNRR held a 1996 Regional Members' Meeting in Amsterdam. Between 2003 to 2007, WGNRR collaborated with the People’s Health Movement on the Women’s Access to Health campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women's Access to Health Campaign|url=http://www.phmovement.org/en/campaigns/33/page|publisher=People's Health Movement|accessdate=June 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  WGNRR then relocated its main office to the Global South and by 2009, the main office was transferred from the [[Netherlands]] to the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name="wgnrr" /&gt;

== Campaigns ==
WGNRR has facilitated several international campaigns on a wide range of issues including [[maternal mortality]] and morbidity, poverty, [[forced sterilization]] and the sexual and [[reproductive rights]] of youth. Since its inception, WGNRR has used "Calls for Action" to mobilize members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Humble|first=Morag|title=Window on the World: Reproductive Rights and Health Movements|journal=Development|year=2005|volume=48|issue=4|doi=10.1057/palgrave.development.1100196|url=http://www.palgrave-journals.com/development/journal/v48/n4/full/1100196a.html|accessdate=June 13, 2012|pages=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;  WGNRR's two primary campaigns are the International Day of Action for Women's Health (May 28) and the International Day of Action for Access to Safe and Legal Abortion (September 28).

=== Global Day of Action for Access to Safe and Legal Abortion ===
September 28 was chosen as the date for the Latin American and Caribbean Campaign for the Decriminalization of Abortion in 1990.&lt;ref name="wgnrr_a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wgnrr.org/current-campaigns|title=WGNRR: Current Campaigns|accessdate=June 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the name of the day was changed to [[International Safe Abortion Day]] in an attempt to have a simpler, easier to remember name and to advocate for the day to become an official UN day.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.safeabortionwomensright.org/international-safe-abortion-day/&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Funders ==
WGNRR works in partnership with and has received recent funding from [[Oxfam Novib]] and The Safe Abortion Action Fund (SAAF).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wgnrr.org/funders/|title=Funders {{!}} WGNRR|website=wgnrr.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
