'''12AX7''' (also known as ECC83)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thetubestore.com/Tubes/12AX7-ECC83-Tube-Types&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[vacuum tube]] that is a miniature dual [[triode]] - [[6AV6]] with high voltage [[gain (electronics)|gain]]. It was developed around 1946 by [[RCA]] engineers&lt;ref name="vintage"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jung|first=David|title=Draw! A 12AX7 'Shootout'|journal=[[Vintage Guitar (magazine)|Vintage Guitar]]|date=September 2010|pages=114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Camden, New Jersey]], under developmental number A-4522.  It was released for public sale under the 12AX7 identifier on September 15, 1947. The 12AX7 was originally intended as replacement for the [[6SL7]] family of dual-triode amplifier tubes for audio applications. It is popular with tube amplifier enthusiasts, and its ongoing use in such equipment makes it one of the few small-signal vacuum tubes in continuous production since it was introduced.

== History ==
The 12AX7 is basically two of the triodes from a 6AV6 - a double diode triode.  The 6AV6 is a miniature repackaging (with just a single cathode) of the triode and twin diodes from the octal [[6SQ7]] (a double-diode triode used in AM radios), which itself is very similar to the older type 75 triode-diode dating from 1930.

{{As of|2012}} the 12AX7 was made in various versions by two factories in [[Russia]] (Winged C, formerly Svetlana, and [[Sovtek|New Sensor]], which produces tubes under the Sovtek, Electro-Harmonix, Svetlana, [[Tung-Sol]], and other brands for which the firm has acquired trademark rights), one in [[China]] ([[Shuguang (Company)|Shuguang]]), and one in [[Slovakia]] ([[JJ Electronic]]), for a total annual production estimated at two million units.  The vast majority are used in new-production [[guitar amplifier]]s or for replacements in [[guitar]] and audio equipment.

== Application ==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}
The 12AX7 is a high-gain (typical amplification factor 100), low-plate-current [[triode]] best suited for low-level audio voltage amplification.  In this role it is widely used for the preamplifier (input and mid-level) stages of audio amplifiers. It has relatively high [[Miller effect|Miller]] capacitance, making it unsuitable for radio-frequency use.

Typically a 12AX7 triode is configured with a high-value plate resistor, 100k ohms in most guitar amps and 220k ohms or more in high-fidelity equipment. Grid bias is most often provided by a cathode resistor.  If the cathode resistor is unbypassed, negative feedback is introduced and each half of a 12AX7 provides a typical voltage gain of about 30; the amplification factor is basically twice the maximum stage gain, as the plate impedance must be matched.  Thus half the voltage is across the tube at rest, half across the load resistor. The cathode resistor can be bypassed to reduce or eliminate AC negative feedback and thereby increase gain; maximum gain is about 60 times.

&lt;math&gt;A_v&lt;/math&gt; = µ * Rtot / ( rP + Rtot + ( RK * ( µ + 1 )))

Where &lt;math&gt;A_v&lt;/math&gt; = voltage gain, µ is the amplification factor of the valve, rP is the internal plate resistance,
RK is the cathode resistor and Rtot is the parallel combination of RP (external plate resistor) and Rload.
If the cathode resistor is bypassed, use RK = 0.

The initial "12" in the designator implies a 12-volt heater requirement; however, the tube has a center-tapped heater so it can be used in either 6.3V or 12.6V heater circuits.

== Characteristics ==
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Similar twin-triode designs ==
The 12AX7 is the most common member of what eventually became a large family of twin-triode vacuum tubes, manufactured all over the world, all sharing the same pinout (EIA 9A). Most use heaters which can be optionally wired in series (12.6V, 150&amp;nbsp;mA) or parallel (6.3V, 300&amp;nbsp;mA).  Other tubes, which in some cases can be used interchangeably in an emergency, include the [[12AT7]], [[12AU7]], [[12AV7]], 12AY7, and the low-voltage 12U7, plus many 4-digit EIA series dual triodes.  They span a wide range of voltage gain and transconductance. Different versions of each were designed for enhanced ruggedness, low [[microphonics]], stability, lifespan, etc.

Those other designs offer lower voltage gain (traded off for higher plate current) than the 12AX7 (which has a voltage gain or &lt;math&gt;A_v&lt;/math&gt; of 100), and are more suitable for high-frequency applications.

Some American designs similar to the 12AX7:
* 12AX7-HD (Tube 1965 Created 2015  &lt;math&gt;A_v&lt;/math&gt; = 90 ultra low noise. This is a 5755/420A with a PCB attached to change pinout.)
* 12AD7 (October 10, 1955 - 225mA heater - low hum)
* [[12AT7]] (May 20, 1947, dual 6AB4, &lt;math&gt;A_v&lt;/math&gt; = 60)
* [[12AU7]] (October 18, 1946, dual 6C4,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thetubestore.com/Tubes/6C4-M8080-Tube-Types&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;A_v&lt;/math&gt; = 17-20)
* 12AV7 (February 14, 1950 - dual 6BC4, &lt;math&gt;A_v&lt;/math&gt; = 37-41)
* '''12AX7''' (September 15, 1947 - dual 6DR4, also like miniature 6SL7, &lt;math&gt;A_v&lt;/math&gt; = 100)
* 12AY7 (December 7, 1948 - &lt;math&gt;A_v&lt;/math&gt; = 44, for audio preamp use)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thetubestore.com/Tubes/12AY7-6072-Tube-Types&lt;/ref&gt;
* 12AZ7 (March 2, 1951 - 225mA heater, &lt;math&gt;A_v&lt;/math&gt; = 60)
* 12DF7 (&lt;math&gt;A_v&lt;/math&gt; = 100, low microphonics)
* 12DT7 (&lt;math&gt;A_v&lt;/math&gt; = 100)
* 12DW7 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.thetubestore.com/Tubes/12DW7-7247-Tube-Types&lt;/ref&gt;(First triode: &lt;math&gt;A_v&lt;/math&gt; = 100, Second triode: &lt;math&gt;A_v&lt;/math&gt; = 17)
* 12U7  (&lt;math&gt;A_v&lt;/math&gt; = 20, for use in automotive radios on 12-volt plate supply)

Although commonly known in Europe by its [[Mullard–Philips tube designation]] of ECC83, other European variations also exist including the low-[[signal noise|noise]] versions 12AX7A, 12AD7, 6681, 7025, and 7729; European versions B339, B759, CV492, CV4004, CV8156, CV8222, ECC803, ECC803S, E2164, and M8137; and the lower-gain low-noise versions 5751 and 6851, intended for avionics equipment.

In European usage special-quality valves of some sort were often indicated by exchanging letters and digits in the name: the E83CC was a special-quality ECC83.
In the US a "W" in the designation, as in 12AX7WA, designates the tube as complying with military grade, higher reliability specifications.

The 'E' in the European designation classifies this as having a 6.3 volt heater, whereas the American designation of 12AX7 classifies it as having a 12.6 volt heater.  It can, of course, be wired for operation off either voltage.

'''α-Linolenic acid''' ('''ALA''') is an ''n''−3 fatty acid.  It is one of two [[essential fatty acids]] (the other being [[linoleic acid]]), so called because they are necessary for health and cannot be produced within the human body. They must be acquired through diet. ALA is an [[omega-3]] [[fatty acid]] found in seeds ([[Chia seed|chia]], [[flaxseed]], [[hemp]], see also table below), nuts (notably walnuts), and many common [[vegetable oil]]s.  In terms of its [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry|structure]], it is named ''all''-''cis''-9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid.&lt;ref name=Beare&gt;{{cite web

α-Linolenic acid is a [[carboxylic acid]] with an 18-carbon chain and three ''[[Cis-trans isomerism|cis]]'' [[double bond]]s. The first double bond is located at the third carbon from the methyl end of the fatty acid chain, known as the ''n'' end. Thus, α-linolenic acid is a [[polyunsaturated fatty acid|polyunsaturated]] [[omega-3 fatty acid|''n''−3]] (omega-3) fatty acid. It is an [[isomer]] of  [[gamma-linolenic acid]] (GLA), a polyunsaturated [[omega-6 fatty acid|''n''−6]] (omega-6) fatty acid.

==History==
α-Linolenic acid was first isolated by Rollett&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rollett, A. | journal = [[Z. Physiol. Chem.]] | volume = 62 | pages = 422–431 | year = 1909 | doi = 10.1515/bchm2.1909.62.5-6.422 | title = Zur kenntnis der linolensäure und des leinöls | issue = 5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; as cited in J. W. McCutcheon's synthesis in 1942,&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | prep=cv3p0531 | author = J. W. McCutcheon | title = Linolenic acid | collvol = 3 | collvolpages = 351 | year = 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; and referred to in Green and Hilditch's 1930s survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Green | first1 = TG | last2 = Hilditch | first2 = TP | title = The identification of linoleic and linolenic acids | journal = [[Biochem.

A Wittig reaction of the phosphonium salt of [(''Z-Z'')-nona-3,6-dien-1-yl]triphenylphosphonium bromide with methyl 9-oxononanoate, followed by [[saponification]], completed the synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sandri, J. |author2=Viala, J. | year = 1995 | title = Direct preparation of (Z,Z)-1,4-dienic units with a new C6 homologating agent: synthesis of alpha-linolenic acid | pages = 271–275 | journal = [[Synthesis (journal)|Synthesis]] | volume = 3 | doi = 10.1055/s-1995-3906 | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dietary sources==
Seed oils are the richest sources of α-linolenic acid, notably those of hempseed, [[Salvia hispanica|chia]], [[Perilla oil|perilla]], [[flaxseed]] ([[linseed oil]]), [[rapeseed]] ([[canola]]), and [[soybean]]s. α-Linolenic acid is also obtained from the [[thylakoid|thylakoid membranes]] in the leaves of ''[[Pisum sativum]]'' (pea leaves).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Potential role in nutrition and health==
[[Image:Beklädnadsväxter, Linum usitatissimum, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|100px|right|Flax is a rich source of α-linolenic acid.]]
Although the best source of ALA is seeds, most seeds and seed oils are much richer in an ''n''−6 fatty acid, [[linoleic acid]]. Exceptions include flaxseed (must be ground for proper nutrient absorption) and chia seeds. Linoleic acid is the other essential fatty acid, but it, and the other ''n''−6 fatty acids, compete with ''n''−3s for positions in cell membranes and have very different effects on human health. There is a complex set of [[essential fatty acid interactions]].

α-Linolenic acid can only be obtained by humans through their diets because the absence of the required 12- and 15-desaturase enzymes makes ''de novo'' synthesis from [[stearic acid]] impossible. [[Eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA; 20:5, ''n''−3) and [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA; 22:6, ''n''−3) are readily available from fish and algae oil and play a vital role in many metabolic processes. These can also be synthesized by humans from dietary α-linolenic acid, but with an efficiency of only a few percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Breanne M Anderson |author2=David WL Ma | year = 2009

Because the efficacy of ''n''−3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) synthesis decreases down the cascade of α-linolenic acid conversion, DHA synthesis from α-linolenic acid is even more restricted than that of EPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Stability and hydrogenation===
α-Linolenic acid is relatively more susceptible to oxidation and will become rancid more quickly than many other oils. [[Rancidification|Oxidative instability]] of α-linolenic acid is one reason why producers choose to partially [[Hydrogenation|hydrogenate]] oils containing α-linolenic acid, such as [[soybean oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Soybean]]s are the largest source of edible oils in the U.S., and 40% of soy oil production is partially hydrogenated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.truthabouttrade.org/article.asp?id=6669 |title=Ban on trans fat could benefit Iowa |journal=Truth About Trade and Technology |accessdate=2007-01-03 |author1=Fitzgerald, Anne  |author2=Brasher, Philip |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927012419/http://www.truthabouttrade.org/article.asp?id=6669 |archivedate=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when partially hydrogenated, part of the unsaturated fatty acids become unhealthy [[trans fats]]. Consumers are increasingly avoiding products that contain trans fats, and governments have begun to ban trans fats in food products. These regulations and market pressures have spurred the development of low-α-linolenic acid soybeans. These new soybean varieties yield a more stable oil that doesn't require hydrogenation for many applications, thus providing trans fat-free products, such as frying oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Several consortia are bringing low-α-linolenic acid soy to market.  [[DuPont]]'s effort involves [[Gene silencing|silencing]] the FAD2 gene that codes for [[Desaturase|Δ&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-desaturase]], giving a soy oil with very low levels of both α-linolenic acid and linoleic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Arid Land Ecology Reserve''' is the largest tract of [[shrub-steppe]] ecosystem remaining in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. It is managed for the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] by the [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]] (which is operated for the U.S. Department of Energy by [[Battelle Memorial Institute]]). The 320&amp;nbsp;km² area is a portion of the 1500&amp;nbsp;km² National Environmental Research Park located on the [[Hanford Site]] on the northwest boundary of [[Richland, Washington]].

On June 27, 2000, a range fire destroyed most of the native [[sagebrush]] and [[Tussock (grass)|bunchgrass]].  Though the US Fish and Wildlife Service has attempted to re-introduce native flora, the Arid Lands Ecology Reserve is currently dominated by non-native species such as [[Bromus tectorum|cheatgrass]], [[Centaurea|knapweeds]], and Russian thistle ([[tumbleweed]]) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fws.gov/hanfordreach/weeds.html Hanford Reach National Monument - Weeds&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706052309/http://www.fws.gov/hanfordreach/weeds.html |date=July 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which flourished after the 2000 fire.

In chemistry, an '''arsenide''' is a compound of [[arsenic]] with a less [[electronegative]] element or elements.  Many metals form [[binary compound]]s containing arsenic, and these are called arsenides. They exist with many [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometries]], and in this respect arsenides are similar to [[phosphide]]s.&lt;ref name="Greenwood" &gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alkali metal and alkaline earth arsenides==
The group 1 [[alkali metal]]s and the group 2, [[alkaline earth metal]]s, form arsenides with isolated arsenic atoms.  They form upon heating arsenic powder with excess sodium gives [[sodium arsenide]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;As). The structure of Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;As is complex with unusually short Na–Na distances of 328–330&amp;nbsp;pm which are shorter than in sodium metal.  This short distance indicates the complex bonding in these simple phases, i.e. they are not simply salts of As&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; anion, for example.&lt;ref name="Greenwood"/&gt;  The compound LiAs, has a metallic lustre and electrical conductivity indicating some metallic bonding.&lt;ref name="Greenwood"/&gt;  These compounds are mainly of academic interest.  For example, "sodium arsenide" is a structural motif adopted by many compounds with the A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B stoichiometry.

Indicative of their salt-like properties, hydrolysis of alkali metal arsenides gives [[arsine]]:
:Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;As  +  3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O   →   AsH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  3 NaOH

[[Image:Nickeline.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Nickel arsenide is a common impurity in ores of nickel.  It is also a prototype of a class of structures.]]

==III–V Compounds==
{{main|List of semiconductor materials}}
Many arsenides of the [[group 13 elements]] (group III) are valuable semiconductors. [[Gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) features isolated arsenic centers with a [[Zincblende (crystal structure)|zincblende]] structure ([[wurtzite]] structure can eventually also form in nanostructures), and with predominantly covalent bonding – it is a III–V semiconductor.

==Polyarsenides==
===Transition metal arsenides===
Arsenic anionics are known to catenate, that is, form chains, rings, and cages.  The mineral [[skutterudite]] (CoAs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) features  rings that are usually described as {{chem|As|4|4-}}.&lt;ref name="Greenwood"/&gt; Assigning formal [[oxidation numbers]] is difficult because these materials are highly covalent and often are best described with [[band theory]].  [[Sperrylite]] (PtAs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is usually described as {{chem|Pt|4+|As|2|4−}}. The arsenides of the transition metals are mainly of interest because they contaminate sulfidic ores of commercial interest.  The extraction of the metals – nickel, iron, cobalt, copper – entails chemical processes such as smelting that poses environmental risks.  In the mineral, arsenic is immobile and poses no environmental risk.  Released from the mineral, arsenic is poisonous and mobile.

===Zintl phases===
[[File:423080Asonly.png|thumb|right|Structure of [As&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; subunit in the [[Zintl phase]] Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NaAs&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=New compounds with (As&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; Clusters: Synthesis and Crystal Structures of the Zintl Phases Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NaAs&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, Cs&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;ZnAs&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; and Cs&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;CdAs&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;|authors=He, Hua; Tyson, C.-T.; Bobev, S.|journal=Crystals|year=2011|pages=87-p98|doi=10.3390/cryst1030087}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Partial reduction of arsenic with alkali metals (and related electropositive elements) affords polyarsenic compounds, which are members of the [[Zintl phase]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2690">[[File:Butterfly-joint.JPG|thumb|Butterfly joint]]
A  '''Dovetail key''', '''Dutchman Joint''',  or '''Butterfly joint'''   is a type of [[Woodworking joints|joint]] used either to hold two or more wooden boards together or to keep two halves of a board that have already started to split from splitting further. They may also be used to stabilize the core of a knothole, preventing it from dropping out over time. They are also commonly used as decorative inlays for non structural aesthetic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.canadianwoodworking.com/tipstechniques/butterfly-key&lt;/ref&gt;

A Dovetail Key resembles two [[Dovetail joint|dovetails]] connected at the narrow part. A negative of the hole is cut out of the board the butterfly will be placed in and the butterfly is then fitted, keeping the joint together. The wood used for the butterfly is usually a contrasting wood, often walnut.

== History ==
Dovetail keys or Butterfly joints have been used both in decorative and structural joints since ancient times. They were prominently used in construction of the Cairo Dahshur Boats,  a type of [[Khufu ship]] from the Egyptian middle kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pearce Paul Creasman]]. "The Cairo Dahshur Boats." TAMU, 2005. http://repository.tamu.edu/bitstream/handle/1969.1/4852/etd-tamu-2005C-ANTH-Creasman.pdf?sequence=10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Creasman |first=Pearce Paul |year= |title=Dovetails or Lashings: A Case Study in Middle Kingdom Ship Construction (The Cairo Dahshur Boats) |journal=The 58th Annual Meeting of the American Research Center in Egypt |page=4 |publisher= |doi= |pmid= |pmc= |date=April 18, 2007 |url=http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/8/1/6/6/pages181664/p181664-4.php |accessdate=25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also historically used in repairing cracks in Dutch tabletops in the 18th century. This is where the term Dutchman joint originates. The dovetail key was installed across the crack to stabilize and inhibit further movement of the crack.

== Modern use ==
Contemporary decorative dovetail keys are commonly seen in and associated with the work of [[George Nakashima]].&lt;ref&gt;Hargreaves, Andrea. "George Nakashima." Woodworkers Institute, 2008. http://www.woodworkersinstitute.com/page.asp?p=624&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carbon''' (from {{lang-la|carbo}} "coal") is a [[chemical element]] with [[Symbol (chemistry)|symbol]] '''C''' and [[atomic number]] 6. It is [[nonmetal]]lic and [[tetravalence|tetravalent]]—making four [[electron]]s available to form [[covalent bond|covalent]] [[chemical bond]]s. It belongs to group 14 of the periodic table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=carbon {{!}} Facts, Uses, &amp; Properties|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/carbon-chemical-element|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024183827/https://www.britannica.com/science/carbon-chemical-element|archivedate=2017-10-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three [[Isotopes of carbon|isotopes]] occur naturally, [[Carbon-12|{{sup|12}}C]] and [[Carbon-13|{{sup|13}}C]] being stable, while [[Carbon-14|{{sup|14}}C]] is a [[radionuclide]], decaying with a [[half-life]] of about 5,730&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name="isotopes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webelements.com/webelements/elements/text/C/isot.html|title=Carbon&amp;nbsp;– Naturally occurring isotopes|publisher=WebElements Periodic Table|accessdate=2008-10-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908030327/http://www.webelements.com/webelements/elements/text/C/isot.html|archivedate=2008-09-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon is one of the [[Discoveries of the chemical elements|few elements known since antiquity]].&lt;ref name=D2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caer.uky.edu/carbon/history/carbonhistory.shtml|title=History of Carbon|accessdate=2013-01-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101085829/http://www.caer.uky.edu/carbon/history/carbonhistory.shtml#|archivedate=2012-11-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon is the 15th [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|most abundant element in the Earth's crust]], and the [[Abundance of the chemical elements|fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass]] after [[hydrogen]], [[helium]], and [[oxygen]]. Carbon's abundance, its unique diversity of [[organic compound]]s, and its unusual ability to form [[polymer]]s at the temperatures commonly encountered on [[Earth]] enables this element to serve as a common element of [[Carbon-based life|all known life]]. It is the second most abundant element in the [[human body]] by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Campbell Biology|last=Reece|first=Jane B.|date=31 October 2013|publisher=[[Pearson Education|Pearson]]|isbn=9780321775658|edition=10|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The atoms of carbon can bond together in different ways, termed [[allotropes of carbon]]. The best known are [[graphite]], [[diamond]], and [[amorphous carbon]].&lt;ref name="therm prop"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://invsee.asu.edu/nmodules/Carbonmod/point.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010531203728/http://invsee.asu.edu/nmodules/Carbonmod/point.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2001-05-31|title=World of Carbon&amp;nbsp;– Interactive Nano-visulisation in Science &amp; Engineering Education (IN-VSEE)|accessdate=2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[physical property|physical properties]] of carbon vary widely with the allotropic form. For example, graphite is [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] and black while diamond is highly [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]]. Graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper (hence its name, from the [[Greeks|Greek]] verb "γράφειν" which means "to write"), while diamond is the hardest naturally occurring material known. Graphite is a good [[electrical conductor]] while diamond has a low [[electrical conductivity]]. Under normal conditions, diamond, [[carbon nanotube]]s, and [[graphene]] have the highest [[thermal conductivity|thermal conductivities]] of [[List of thermal conductivities|all known materials]]. All carbon allotropes are solids under normal conditions, with graphite being the most [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|thermodynamically stable]] form at standard temperature and pressure. They are chemically resistant and require high temperature to react even with oxygen.

The most common [[oxidation state]] of carbon in [[inorganic compound]]s is +4, while +2 is found in [[carbon monoxide]] and [[transition metal]] [[Metal carbonyl|carbonyl]] complexes. The largest sources of inorganic carbon are [[limestone]]s, [[dolomite]]s and [[carbon dioxide]], but significant quantities occur in organic deposits of [[coal]], [[peat]], [[petroleum|oil]], and [[methane clathrate]]s. Carbon forms a vast number of [[chemical compound|compounds]], more than any other element, with almost ten million compounds described to date,&lt;ref name=lanl&gt;{{cite web|author=Chemistry Operations|date=December 15, 2003|url=http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/6.html|title=Carbon|publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory|accessdate=2008-10-09|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913063402/http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/6.html |archivedate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and yet that number is but a fraction of the number of theoretically possible compounds under standard conditions. For this reason, carbon has often been referred to as the "king of the elements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Deming |first=Anna |date=2010 |title=King of the elements? |journal=Nanotechnology |volume=21 |issue=30 |pages=300201 |doi=10.1088/0957-4484/21/30/300201 |pmid=20664156 |bibcode=2010Nanot..21D0201D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[File:Carbon-phase-diagramp.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Theoretically predicted phase diagram of carbon]]
The [[allotropes of carbon]] include [[graphite]], one of the softest known substances, and [[diamond]], the hardest naturally occurring substance. It [[Chemical bond|bonds]] readily with other small [[atom]]s, including other carbon atoms, and is capable of forming multiple stable [[covalent]] bonds with suitable multivalent atoms. Carbon is known to form almost ten million different compounds, a large majority of all [[chemical compounds]].&lt;ref name=lanl/&gt; Carbon also has the highest [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] point of all elements. At [[atmospheric pressure]] it has no melting point, as its [[triple point]] is at {{val|10.8|0.2|u=MPa}} and {{convert|4600|±|300|K|C F|-1}},&lt;ref name=triple2/&gt;&lt;ref name=triple3/&gt; so it sublimes at about 3,900&amp;nbsp;K.&lt;ref name="triple"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Nature |volume=276 |pages=695–696 |date=1978 |doi=10.1038/276695a0 |title=The controversial carbon solid−liquid−vapour triple point |first=A. |last=Greenville Whittaker |issue=5689 |bibcode=1978Natur.276..695W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://lbruno.home.cern.ch/lbruno/documents/Bibliography/LHC_Note_78.pdf |title=On Graphite Transformations at High Temperature and Pressure Induced by Absorption of the LHC Beam |first=J.

For example, graphite can be oxidised by hot concentrated [[nitric acid]] at standard conditions to [[mellitic acid]], C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, which preserves the hexagonal units of graphite while breaking up the larger structure.&lt;ref name=Greenwood289&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 289–292.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon sublimes in a carbon arc, which has a temperature of about 5800 K (5,530&amp;nbsp;°C or 9,980&amp;nbsp;°F). Thus, irrespective of its allotropic form, carbon remains solid at higher temperatures than the highest-melting-point metals such as [[tungsten]] or [[rhenium]]. Although thermodynamically prone to [[Redox|oxidation]], carbon resists oxidation more effectively than elements such as [[iron]] and [[copper]], which are weaker reducing agents at room temperature.

Carbon is the sixth element, with a ground-state [[electron configuration]] of 1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2p&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, of which the four outer electrons are [[valence electron]]s. Its first four ionisation energies, 1086.5, 2352.6, 4620.5 and 6222.7&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol, are much higher than those of the heavier group-14 elements. The electronegativity of carbon is 2.5, significantly higher than the heavier group-14 elements (1.8–1.9), but close to most of the nearby nonmetals, as well as some of the second- and third-row [[transition metal]]s. Carbon's [[covalent radius|covalent radii]] are normally taken as 77.2&amp;nbsp;pm (C−C), 66.7&amp;nbsp;pm (C=C) and 60.3&amp;nbsp;pm (C≡C), although these may vary depending on coordination number and what the carbon is bonded to. In general, covalent radius decreases with lower coordination number and higher bond order.&lt;ref name=Greenwood276&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 276–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon compounds form the basis of all known life on [[Earth]], and the [[CNO cycle|carbon–nitrogen cycle]] provides some of the energy produced by the [[Sun]] and other [[star]]s. Although it forms an extraordinary variety of compounds, most forms of carbon are comparatively unreactive under normal conditions. At standard temperature and pressure, it resists all but the strongest oxidizers. It does not react with [[sulfuric acid]], [[hydrochloric acid]], [[chlorine]] or any [[Alkali metals|alkalis]]. At elevated temperatures, carbon reacts with [[oxygen]] to form [[Oxocarbon|carbon oxides]] and will rob oxygen from metal oxides to leave the elemental metal. This [[exothermic reaction]] is used in the iron and steel industry to [[Smelting|smelt]] iron and to control the carbon content of [[steel]]:

:{{chem|Fe|3|O|4}} + 4 C{{sub|(s)}} → 3 Fe{{sub|(s)}} + 4 CO{{sub|(g)}}

Carbon monoxide can be recycled to smelt even more iron:

:{{chem|Fe|3|O|4}} + 4 CO{{sub|(g)}} → 3 Fe{{sub|(s)}} + 4 {{chem|C|O|2}}{{sub|(g)}}

with [[sulfur]] to form [[carbon disulfide]] and with steam in the coal-gas reaction:
:C{{sub|(s)}} + H{{sub|2}}O{{sub|(g)}} → CO{{sub|(g)}} + H{{sub|2(g)}}.
Carbon combines with some metals at high temperatures to form metallic carbides, such as the iron carbide [[cementite]] in steel and [[tungsten carbide]], widely used as an [[abrasive]] and for making hard tips for cutting tools.

The system of carbon allotropes spans a range of extremes:

[[Atomic carbon]] is a very short-lived species and, therefore, carbon is stabilized in various multi-atomic structures with different molecular configurations called [[allotropes]]. The three relatively well-known allotropes of carbon are [[amorphous carbon]], [[graphite]], and [[diamond]].

[[File:Glassy carbon and a 1cm3 graphite cube HP68-79.jpg|thumb|left|A large sample of glassy carbon]]
The [[amorphous]] form is an assortment of carbon atoms in a non-crystalline, irregular, glassy state, not held in a crystalline macrostructure. It is present as a powder, and is the main constituent of substances such as [[charcoal]], [[lampblack]] ([[soot]]) and [[activated carbon]]. At normal pressures, carbon takes the form of graphite, in which each atom is bonded trigonally to three others in a plane composed of fused [[hexagon]]al rings, just like those in [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The polymorphism of elements and compounds |last=Jenkins |first=Edgar |date=1973 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-423-87500-3 |page=30 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XNYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA30 |accessdate=2011-05-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123204229/http://books.google.com/books?id=XNYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA30 |archivedate=2012-11-23 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting network is 2-dimensional, and the resulting flat sheets are stacked and loosely bonded through weak [[van der Waals force]]s.&lt;!-- no evidence for upper case van der Waals; see [[Talk:Van der Waals#Van should be capitalized unless preceded by first name]] rebuttal --&gt; This gives graphite its softness and its [[Cleavage (crystal)|cleaving]] properties (the sheets slip easily past one another). Because of the delocalization of one of the outer electrons of each atom to form a [[Delocalized electron|π-cloud]], graphite conducts [[electricity]], but only in the plane of each [[covalent bond|covalently bonded]] sheet. This results in a lower bulk [[electrical conductivity]] for carbon than for most [[metal]]s. The delocalization also accounts for the energetic stability of graphite over diamond at room temperature.

At very high pressures, carbon forms the more compact allotrope, [[diamond]], having nearly twice the density of graphite. Here, each atom is bonded [[tetrahedron|tetrahedrally]] to four others, forming a 3-dimensional network of puckered six-membered rings of atoms. Diamond has the same [[cubic crystal system|cubic structure]] as [[silicon]] and [[germanium]], and because of the strength of the carbon-carbon [[chemical bond|bonds]], it is the hardest naturally occurring substance measured by [[Mohs scale|resistance to scratching]]. Contrary to the popular belief that ''"diamonds are forever"'', they are thermodynamically unstable (Δ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;''G''°(diamond, 298&amp;nbsp;K) = 2.9&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rossini |first=F.

The bottom left corner of the phase diagram for carbon has not been scrutinized experimentally.  However, a recent computational study employing [[density functional theory]] methods reached the conclusion that as {{nobr|''T'' → 0 K}} and {{nobr|''p'' → 0 Pa}}, diamond becomes ''more stable'' than graphite by approximately 1.1&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Grochala |first=Wojciech |date=2014-04-01 |title=Diamond: Electronic Ground State of Carbon at Temperatures Approaching 0 K |journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition |language=en |volume=53 |issue=14 |pages=3680–3683 |doi=10.1002/anie.201400131 |pmid=24615828 |issn=1521-3773}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under some conditions, carbon crystallizes as [[lonsdaleite]], a [[hexagonal]] [[crystal]] lattice with all atoms covalently bonded and properties similar to those of diamond.&lt;ref name="lonsdaletite"/&gt;

[[Fullerene]]s are a synthetic crystalline formation with a graphite-like structure, but in place of [[hexagonal crystal system|hexagons]], fullerenes are formed of pentagons (or even heptagons) of carbon atoms. The missing (or additional) atoms warp the sheets into spheres, ellipses, or cylinders. The properties of fullerenes (split into buckyballs, buckytubes, and nanobuds) have not yet been fully analyzed and represent an intense area of research in [[nanomaterials]]. The names ''"fullerene"'' and ''"buckyball"'' are given after [[Buckminster Fuller|Richard Buckminster Fuller]], popularizer of [[geodesic dome]]s, which resemble the structure of fullerenes. The buckyballs are fairly large molecules formed completely of carbon bonded trigonally, forming [[spheroid]]s (the best-known and simplest is the soccerball-shaped C{{sub|60}} [[buckminsterfullerene]]).&lt;ref name="buckyballs"/&gt; Carbon nanotubes are structurally similar to buckyballs, except that each atom is bonded trigonally in a curved sheet that forms a hollow [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]].&lt;ref name="nanotubes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nanotubes2"/&gt; Nanobuds were first reported in 2007 and are hybrid bucky tube/buckyball materials (buckyballs are covalently bonded to the outer wall of a nanotube) that combine the properties of both in a single structure.&lt;ref name="nanobuds"/&gt;

Of the other discovered allotropes, [[carbon nanofoam]] is a [[ferromagnetic]] allotrope discovered in 1997. It consists of a low-density cluster-assembly of carbon atoms strung together in a loose three-dimensional web, in which the atoms are bonded trigonally in six- and seven-membered rings. It is among the lightest known solids, with a density of about 2&amp;nbsp;kg/m{{sup|3}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.aip.org/pnu/2004/split/678-1.html|title=Carbon Nanofoam is the World's First Pure Carbon Magnet|volume=678|issue=1|date=March 26, 2004|author=Schewe, Phil|author2=Stein, Ben|last-author-amp=yes|journal=Physics News Update|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307104655/http://www.aip.org/pnu/2004/split/678-1.html|archivedate=March 7, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[glassy carbon]] contains a high proportion of closed [[porosity]],&lt;ref name="glassy carbon"/&gt; but contrary to normal graphite, the graphitic layers are not stacked like pages in a book, but have a more random arrangement.

[[Coal]] is very rich in carbon ([[anthracite]] contains 92–98%)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Coal Mining Technology: Theory and Practice|author=Stefanenko,  R.|publisher=Society for Mining Metallurgy|date=1983|isbn=978-0-89520-404-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the largest commercial source of mineral carbon, accounting for 4,000&amp;nbsp;gigatonnes or 80% of [[fossil fuel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=James|last=Kasting|date=1998|title=The Carbon Cycle, Climate, and the Long-Term Effects of Fossil Fuel Burning|journal=Consequences: The Nature and Implication of Environmental Change|volume=4|url=http://gcrio.org/CONSEQUENCES/vol4no1/carbcycle.html|issue=1|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024152448/http://gcrio.org/CONSEQUENCES/vol4no1/carbcycle.html|archivedate=2008-10-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for individual carbon allotropes, graphite is found in large quantities in the [[United States]] (mostly in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Texas]]), [[Russia]], [[Mexico]], [[Greenland]], and [[India]]. Natural diamonds occur in the rock [[kimberlite]], found in ancient [[volcano|volcanic]] "necks", or "pipes". Most diamond deposits are in [[Africa]], notably in [[South Africa]], [[Namibia]], [[Botswana]], the [[Republic of the Congo]], and [[Sierra Leone]]. Diamond deposits have also been found in [[Arkansas]], [[Canada]], the Russian [[Arctic]], [[Brazil]], and in Northern and Western [[Australia]]. Diamonds are now also being recovered from the ocean floor off the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. Diamonds are found naturally, but about 30% of all industrial diamonds used in the U.S. are now manufactured.

Carbon-rich asteroids are relatively preponderant in the outer parts of the [[asteroid belt]] in our [[solar system]]. These asteroids have not yet been directly sampled by scientists.

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of carbon}}
[[Isotope]]s of carbon are [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] that contain six [[proton]]s plus a number of [[neutron]]s (varying from 2 to 16). Carbon has two stable, naturally occurring [[isotope]]s.&lt;ref name="isotopes"/&gt; The isotope [[carbon-12]] ({{sup|12}}C) forms 98.93% of the carbon on Earth, while [[carbon-13]] ({{sup|13}}C) forms the remaining 1.07%.&lt;ref name="isotopes"/&gt; The concentration of {{sup|12}}C is further increased in biological materials because biochemical reactions discriminate against {{sup|13}}C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gannes|first=Leonard Z.|last2=Del Rio|first2=Carlos Martı́nez|last3=Koch|first3=Paul|title=Natural Abundance Variations in Stable Isotopes and their Potential Uses in Animal Physiological Ecology|journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology&amp;nbsp;– Part A: Molecular &amp; Integrative Physiology|volume=119|issue=3|pages=725–737|date=1998|doi=10.1016/S1095-6433(98)01016-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) adopted the isotope [[carbon-12]] as the basis for [[atomic weight]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bipm.org/en/si/base_units/|title=Official SI Unit definitions|accessdate=2007-12-21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014094602/http://www.bipm.org/en/si/base_units/|archivedate=2007-10-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Identification of carbon in [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) experiments is done with the isotope {{sup|13}}C.

[[Carbon-14]] ({{sup|14}}C) is a naturally occurring [[radioisotope]], created in the [[upper atmosphere]] (lower [[stratosphere]] and upper [[troposphere]]) by interaction of [[nitrogen]] with [[cosmic ray]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=S.|last=Bowman|date=1990|title=Interpreting the past: Radiocarbon dating|publisher=British Museum Press|isbn=978-0-7141-2047-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is found in trace amounts on Earth of 1 part per [[10^12|trillion]] (0.0000000001%) or more, mostly confined to the atmosphere and superficial deposits, particularly of [[peat]] and other organic materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Tom|date=March 1, 2006|url=http://www.llnl.gov/str/March06/Brown.html|title=Carbon Goes Full Circle in the Amazon|publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|accessdate=2007-11-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922031202/https://www.llnl.gov/str/March06/Brown.html|archivedate=September 22, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This isotope decays by 0.158&amp;nbsp;MeV [[beta decay|β{{sup|−}} emission]].

The amount of {{sup|14}}C in the [[atmosphere]] and in living organisms is almost constant, but decreases predictably in their bodies after death. This principle is used in [[radiocarbon dating]], invented in 1949, which has been used extensively to determine the age of carbonaceous materials with ages up to about 40,000&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Libby|first=W.

There are 15 known isotopes of carbon and the shortest-lived of these is {{sup|8}}C which decays through [[proton emission]] and [[alpha decay]] and has a half-life of 1.98739x10{{sup|−21}} s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barwinski.net/isotopes/query_select.php|title=Use query for carbon-8|accessdate=2007-12-21|publisher=barwinski.net|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050207020143/http://barwinski.net/isotopes/query_select.php|archivedate=2005-02-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exotic {{sup|19}}C exhibits a [[nuclear halo]], which means its [[radius]] is appreciably larger than would be expected if the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] were a [[sphere]] of constant [[density]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/286/5437/28?ck=nck|title=Beaming Into the Dark Corners of the Nuclear Kitchen|doi=10.1126/science.286.5437.28|pages=28–31|date=1999|last1=Watson|first1=A.|journal=Science|volume=286|issue=5437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation in stars===
{{main|Triple-alpha process|CNO cycle}}
Formation of the carbon atomic nucleus occurs within a [[giant star|giant]] or [[supergiant]] star through the [[triple-alpha process]]. This requires a nearly simultaneous collision of three [[alpha particle]]s ([[helium]] nuclei), as the products of further [[nuclear fusion]] reactions of helium with hydrogen or another helium nucleus produce [[isotopes of lithium|lithium-5]] and [[isotopes of beryllium|beryllium-8]] respectively, both of which are highly unstable and decay almost instantly back into smaller nuclei.&lt;ref name="Audi"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Audi|first1=G.|doi=10.1016/S0375-9474(97)00482-X|title=The Nubase evaluation of nuclear and decay properties|date=1997|pages=1–124|volume=624|issue=1|journal=Nuclear Physics A|url=http://amdc.in2p3.fr/nubase/nubase97.pdf|bibcode=1997NuPhA.624....1A|last2=Bersillon|first2=O.|last3=Blachot|first3=J.|last4=Wapstra|first4=A.

The [[CNO cycle]] is an additional hydrogen fusion mechanism that powers stars, wherein carbon operates as a [[catalyst]].

Rotational transitions of various isotopic forms of carbon monoxide (for example, {{sup|12}}CO, {{sup|13}}CO, and {{sup|18}}CO) are detectable in the [[submillimetre astronomy|submillimeter]] wavelength range, and are used in the study of [[Star formation|newly forming stars]] in [[molecular clouds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pikelʹner, Solomon Borisovich|title=Star formation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qbGLgcxnfpIC&amp;pg=PA38|accessdate=2011-06-06|date=1977|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-277-0796-3|pages=38–|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123220424/http://books.google.com/books?id=qbGLgcxnfpIC&amp;pg=PA38|archivedate=2012-11-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carbon cycle===
{{main|Carbon cycle}}
[[File:Carbon cycle-cute diagram.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Diagram of the carbon cycle. The black numbers indicate how much carbon is stored in various reservoirs, in billions tonnes ("GtC" stands for gigatonnes of carbon; figures are circa 2004). The purple numbers indicate how much carbon moves between reservoirs each year. The sediments, as defined in this diagram, do not include the ≈70&amp;nbsp;million GtC of carbonate rock and [[kerogen]].]]
Under terrestrial conditions, conversion of one element to another is very rare. Therefore, the amount of carbon on Earth is effectively constant. Thus, processes that use carbon must obtain it from somewhere and dispose of it somewhere else. The paths of carbon in the environment form the [[carbon cycle]]. For example, [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] plants draw [[carbon dioxide]] from the atmosphere (or seawater) and build it into biomass, as in the [[Calvin cycle]], a process of [[carbon fixation]]. Some of this biomass is eaten by animals, while some carbon is exhaled by animals as carbon dioxide. The carbon cycle is considerably more complicated than this short loop; for example, some carbon dioxide is dissolved in the oceans; if bacteria do not consume it, dead plant or animal matter may become [[petroleum]] or [[coal]], which releases carbon when burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Science|date=2000|volume=290|issue=5490|pages=291–296|doi=10.1126/science.290.5490.291|title=The Global Carbon Cycle: A Test of Our Knowledge of Earth as a System|pmid=11030643|last1=Falkowski|first1=P.|last2=Scholes|first2=R.

Carbon can form very long chains of interconnecting [[carbon–carbon bond]]s, a property that is called [[catenation]]. Carbon-carbon bonds are strong and stable. Through catenation, carbon forms a countless number of compounds. A tally of unique compounds shows that more contain carbon that those that do not.&lt;ref name="Burrows Holman Parsons Pilling 2017 p. 70"&gt;{{cite book | last=Burrows | first=A. | last2=Holman | first2=J. | last3=Parsons | first3=A. | last4=Pilling | first4=G. | last5=Price | first5=G. | title=Chemistry3: Introducing Inorganic, Organic and Physical Chemistry | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2017 | isbn=978-0-19-873380-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YzbjDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA70 | accessdate=2017-05-07 | page=70 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171122173131/https://books.google.com/books?id=YzbjDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA70 | archivedate=2017-11-22 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar claim can be made for hydrogen because most organic compounds also contain hydrogen.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The simplest form of an organic molecule is the [[hydrocarbon]]—a large family of [[organic molecule]]s that are composed of [[hydrogen]] atoms bonded to a chain of carbon atoms. A hydrocarbon backbone can be substituted by other atoms, known as heteroatoms.  Common heteroatoms that appear in organic compounds include oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, and the nonradioactive halogens, as well as the metals lithium and magnesium.  Organic compounds containing bonds to metal are known as organometallic compounds (''see below'').  Certain groupings of atoms, often including heteroatoms, recur in large numbers of organic compounds.  These collections, known as [[Functional group|''functional groups'']], confer common reactivity patterns and allow for the systematic study and categorization of organic compounds.  Chain length, shape and functional groups all affect the properties of organic molecules.

In most stable compounds of carbon (and nearly all stable ''organic'' compounds), carbon obeys the [[octet rule]] and is ''tetravalent'', meaning that a carbon atom forms a total of four covalent bonds (which may include double and triple bonds).  Exceptions include a small number of stabilized ''carbocations'' (three bonds, positive charge), ''radicals'' (three bonds, neutral), ''carbanions'' (three bonds, negative charge) and ''carbenes'' (two bonds, neutral), although these species are much more likely to be encountered as unstable, reactive intermediates.    

Carbon occurs in all known [[organic material|organic]] life and is the basis of [[organic chemistry]]. When united with [[hydrogen]], it forms various hydrocarbons that are important to industry as [[refrigerant]]s, [[lubricant]]s, [[solvent]]s, as chemical feedstock for the manufacture of [[plastic]]s and [[petrochemical]]s, and as [[fossil fuel]]s.

When combined with oxygen and hydrogen, carbon can form many groups of important biological compounds including [[sugar]]s, [[lignan]]s, [[chitin]]s, [[alcohol]]s, [[fat]]s, and aromatic [[ester]]s, [[carotenoid]]s and [[terpene]]s. With [[nitrogen]] it forms [[alkaloid]]s, and with the addition of sulfur also it forms [[antibiotic]]s, [[amino acid]]s, and [[rubber]] products. With the addition of phosphorus to these other elements, it forms [[DNA]] and [[RNA]], the chemical-code carriers of life, and [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), the most important energy-transfer molecule in all living cells.

===Inorganic compounds===
Commonly carbon-containing compounds which are associated with minerals or which do not contain bonds to the other carbon atoms, halogens, or hydrogen, are treated separately from classical [[organic compounds]]; the definition is not rigid, and the classification of some compounds can vary from author to author (see reference articles above). Among these are the simple oxides of carbon. The most prominent oxide is [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}). This was once the principal constituent of the [[paleoatmosphere]], but is a minor component of the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1982|title=The prebiological paleoatmosphere: stability and composition|journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres|volume=12|pages=245–259|doi=10.1007/BF00926894|issue=3|bibcode=1982OrLi...12..245L|last1=Levine|first1=Joel S.|last2=Augustsson|first2=Tommy R.|last3=Natarajan|first3=Murali}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dissolved in [[water (molecule)|water]], it forms [[carbonic acid]] ({{chem|H|2|C|O|3}}), but as most compounds with multiple single-bonded oxygens on a single carbon it is unstable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Loerting, T.|date=2001|title=On the Surprising Kinetic Stability of Carbonic Acid|journal=Angew.

Some important minerals are carbonates, notably [[calcite]]. [[Carbon disulfide]] ({{chem|C|S|2}}) is similar.&lt;ref name=Greenwood289/&gt;  Nevertheless, due to its physical properties and its association with organic synthesis, carbon disulfide is sometimes classified as an ''organic'' solvent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/carbon-disulfide|title=Carbon disulfide - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|website=www.sciencedirect.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other common oxide is [[carbon monoxide]] (CO). It is formed by incomplete combustion, and is a colorless, odorless gas.

A few carbides are covalent lattices, like [[Silicon carbide|carborundum]] (SiC), which resembles [[diamond]]. Nevertheless, even the most polar and salt-like of carbides are not completely ionic compounds.&lt;ref name=Greenwood297&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 297–301&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organometallic compounds===
{{main|Organometallic chemistry}}
Organometallic compounds by definition contain at least one carbon-metal covalent bond. A wide range of such compounds exist; major classes include simple alkyl-metal compounds (for example, [[tetraethyllead]]), η{{sup|2}}-alkene compounds (for example, [[Zeise's salt]]), and η{{sup|3}}-allyl compounds (for example, [[allylpalladium chloride dimer]]); [[metallocene]]s containing cyclopentadienyl ligands (for example, [[ferrocene]]); and [[transition metal carbene complex]]es. Many [[metal carbonyl]]s and [[Cyanometalate|metal cyanides]] exist (for example, [[tetracarbonylnickel]] and [[potassium ferricyanide]]); some workers consider metal carbonyl and cyanide complexes without other carbon ligands to be purely inorganic, and not organometallic.  However, most organometallic chemists consider metal complexes with any carbon ligand, even 'inorganic carbon' (e.g., carbonyls, cyanides, and certain types of carbides and acetylides) to be organometallic in nature.  Metal complexes containing organic ligands without a carbon-metal covalent bond (e.g., metal carboxylates) are termed ''metalorganic'' compounds.

While carbon is understood to strongly prefer formation of four covalent bonds, other exotic bonding schemes are also known.  An interesting compound containing an octahedral hexacoordinated carbon atom has been reported. The cation of the compound is [(Ph{{sub|3}}PAu){{sub|6}}C]{{sup|2+}}. This phenomenon has been attributed to the [[aurophilicity]] of the gold ligands, which provide additional stabilization of an otherwise labile species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/anie.198815441|author=Scherbaum, Franz|journal=[[Angew.

In 2016, it was confirmed that, in line with earlier theoretical predictions, [[hexamethylbenzene|hexamethylbenzene dication]] contains a carbon atom with six bonds, with the formulation [MeC(η&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, making it an "organic [[metallocene]]".  Thus, a MeC&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; fragment is bonded to a η&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; fragment through all five of the carbons of the ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cen.acs.org/articles/94/i49/Six-bonds-carbon-Confirmed.html?type=paidArticleContent|title=Six bonds to carbon: Confirmed|first=Stephen K.|last=Ritter|publisher=Chemical &amp; Engineering News|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109183800/http://cen.acs.org/articles/94/i49/Six-bonds-carbon-Confirmed.html?type=paidArticleContent|archivedate=2017-01-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that in the cases above, each of the bonds to carbon contain less than two formal electron pairs, making them hypercoordinate, but not hypervalent.  Even in cases of alleged 10-C-5 species (that is, a carbon with five ligands and a formal electron count of ten), as reported by Akiba and co-workers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yamashita|first=Makoto|last2=Yamamoto|first2=Yohsuke|last3=Akiba|first3=Kin-ya|last4=Hashizume|first4=Daisuke|last5=Iwasaki|first5=Fujiko|last6=Takagi|first6=Nozomi|last7=Nagase|first7=Shigeru|date=2005-03-01|title=Syntheses and Structures of Hypervalent Pentacoordinate Carbon and Boron Compounds Bearing an Anthracene Skeleton − Elucidation of Hypervalent Interaction Based on X-ray Analysis and DFT Calculation|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=127|issue=12|pages=4354–4371|doi=10.1021/ja0438011|pmid=15783218|issn=0002-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt; electronic structure calculations conclude that the total number of electrons around carbon is still less than eight, as in the case of other compounds described by [[three-center bond]]ing.

==History and etymology==
[[File:Antoine lavoisier.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Antoine Lavoisier]] in his youth]]
The [[English language|English]] name ''carbon'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''carbo'' for coal and charcoal,&lt;ref&gt;Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; whence also comes the [[French language|French]] ''charbon'', meaning charcoal. In [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Danish language|Danish]], the names for carbon are ''Kohlenstoff'', ''koolstof'' and ''kulstof'' respectively, all literally meaning [[coal]]-substance.

Carbon was discovered in prehistory and was known in the forms of [[soot]] and [[charcoal]] to the earliest [[human]] [[civilization]]s. Diamonds were known probably as early as 2500&amp;nbsp;BCE in China, while carbon in the form of [[charcoal]] was made around Roman times by the same chemistry as it is today, by heating wood in a [[pyramid]] covered with [[clay]] to exclude air.&lt;ref name=ancient_China&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4555235.stm|title=Chinese made first use of diamond|publisher=BBC News|date=17 May 2005|accessdate=2007-03-21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320064349/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4555235.stm|archivedate=20 March 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elements.vanderkrogt.net/element.php?sym=C|title=Carbonium/Carbon at Elementymology &amp; Elements Multidict|author=van der Krogt, Peter|accessdate=2010-01-06|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123003310/http://elements.vanderkrogt.net/element.php?sym=C|archivedate=2010-01-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Carl Wilhelm Scheele from Familj-Journalen1874.png|thumb|upright|[[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]]]]
In 1722, [[René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur]] demonstrated that iron was transformed into steel through the absorption of some substance, now known to be carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferchault de Réaumur|first=R.-A.|date=1722|title=L'art de convertir le fer forgé en acier, et l'art d'adoucir le fer fondu, ou de faire des ouvrages de fer fondu aussi finis que le fer forgé (English translation from 1956)|location=Paris, Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1772, [[Antoine Lavoisier]] showed that diamonds are a form of carbon; when he burned samples of charcoal and diamond and found that neither produced any water and that both released the same amount of [[carbon dioxide]] per [[gram]].

In their publication they proposed the name ''carbone'' (Latin ''carbonum'') for the element in graphite which was given off as a gas upon burning graphite. Antoine Lavoisier then listed carbon as an [[chemical element|element]] in his 1789 textbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Senese, Fred|date=2000-09-09|url=http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/inorganic/faq/discovery-of-carbon.shtml|title=Who discovered carbon|publisher=Frostburg State University|accessdate=2007-11-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071207230348/http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/inorganic/faq/discovery-of-carbon.shtml|archivedate=2007-12-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==

===Graphite===
{{main|Graphite}}
Commercially viable natural deposits of graphite occur in many parts of the world, but the most important sources economically are in [[China]], [[India]], [[Brazil]] and [[North Korea]]. Graphite deposits are of [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] origin, found in association with [[quartz]], [[mica]] and [[feldspar]]s in schists, [[gneiss]]es and metamorphosed [[sandstone]]s and [[limestone]] as [[lens (geology)|lenses]] or [[vein (geology)|veins]], sometimes of a metre or more in thickness. Deposits of graphite in [[Borrowdale]], [[Cumberland]], [[England]] were at first of sufficient size and purity that, until the 19th century, [[pencil]]s were made simply by sawing blocks of natural graphite into strips before encasing the strips in wood. Today, smaller deposits of graphite are obtained by crushing the parent rock and floating the lighter graphite out on water.&lt;ref name=USGS&gt;[http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/graphite USGS Minerals Yearbook: Graphite, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916114706/http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/graphite/ |date=2008-09-16 }} and Graphite: Mineral Commodity Summaries 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three types of natural graphite—amorphous, flake or crystalline flake, and vein or lump. Amorphous graphite is the lowest quality and most abundant. Contrary to science, in industry "amorphous" refers to very small crystal size rather than complete lack of crystal structure. Amorphous is used for lower value graphite products and is the lowest priced graphite. Large amorphous graphite deposits are found in China, Europe, Mexico and the United States. Flake graphite is less common and of higher quality than amorphous; it occurs as separate plates that crystallized in metamorphic rock. Flake graphite can be four times the price of amorphous. Good quality flakes can be processed into expandable graphite for many uses, such as [[flame retardant]]s. The foremost deposits are found in Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany and Madagascar. Vein or lump graphite is the rarest, most valuable, and highest quality type of natural graphite. It occurs in veins along intrusive contacts in solid lumps, and it is only commercially mined in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=USGS/&gt;

According to the [[USGS]], world production of natural graphite was 1.1&amp;nbsp;million tonnes in 2010, to which China contributed 800,000&amp;nbsp;t, India 130,000 t, Brazil 76,000&amp;nbsp;t, North Korea 30,000&amp;nbsp;t and Canada 25,000 t. No natural graphite was reported mined in the United States, but 118,000 t of synthetic graphite with an estimated value of $998&amp;nbsp;million was produced in 2009.&lt;ref name=USGS/&gt;

===Diamond===
{{main|Diamond}}
[[File:Global Diamond Output in 2005.png|thumb|upright=2.0|Diamond output in 2005]]

The diamond supply chain is controlled by a limited number of powerful businesses, and is also highly concentrated in a small number of locations around the world (see figure).

Only a very small fraction of the diamond ore consists of actual diamonds. The ore is crushed, during which care has to be taken in order to prevent larger diamonds from being destroyed in this process and subsequently the particles are sorted by density. Today, diamonds are located in the diamond-rich density fraction with the help of [[X-ray fluorescence]], after which the final sorting steps are done by hand. Before the use of [[X-ray]]s became commonplace, the separation was done with grease belts; diamonds have a stronger tendency to stick to grease than the other minerals in the ore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=223|title=The nature of diamonds|author=Harlow, G. E.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1998|isbn=978-0-521-62935-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically diamonds were known to be found only in alluvial deposits in [[southern India]].&lt;ref name=Catelle1&gt;{{cite book|last=Catelle|first=W. R.|title=The Diamond|publisher=John Lane Company|date=1911|page=159}}  discussion on Alluvial diamonds in India and elsewhere as well as earliest finds&lt;/ref&gt; India led the world in diamond production from the time of their discovery in approximately the 9th century BC&lt;ref name=Ball&gt;{{cite book|last=Ball|first=V.|title=Diamonds, Gold and Coal of India|publisher=London, Truebner &amp; Co.|date=1881}} Ball was a Geologist in British service. Chapter I, Page 1&lt;/ref&gt; to the mid-18th century AD, but the commercial potential of these sources had been exhausted by the late 18th century and at that time India was eclipsed by Brazil where the first non-Indian diamonds were found in 1725.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=28|title=The Book Of Diamonds: Their Curious Lore, Properties, Tests And Synthetic Manufacture|first=J. W.|last=Hershey|publisher=Kessinger Pub Co.|isbn=978-1-4179-7715-4|date=1940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diamond production of primary deposits (kimberlites and lamproites) only started in the 1870s after the discovery of the Diamond fields in South Africa. Production has increased over time and now an accumulated total of 4.5&amp;nbsp;billion carats have been mined since that date.&lt;ref name=giasummer2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Janse|first=A. J.

Australia has the richest diamantiferous pipe with production reaching peak levels of {{convert|42|MT}} per year in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=DGemGLorenz/&gt; There are also commercial deposits being actively mined in the [[Northwest Territories]] of [[Canada]], [[Siberia]] (mostly in [[Sakha Republic|Yakutia territory]]; for example, [[Mir Mine|Mir pipe]] and [[Udachnaya pipe]]), Brazil, and in Northern and Western [[Australia]].

Carbon is essential to all known living systems, and without it life as we know it could not exist (see [[alternative biochemistry]]). The major economic use of carbon other than food and wood is in the form of hydrocarbons, most notably the [[fossil fuel]] [[methane]] gas and [[crude oil]] (petroleum). [[Petroleum|Crude oil]] is [[distillation|distilled]] in [[Oil refinery|refineries]] by the [[petrochemical industry]] to produce [[gasoline]], [[kerosene]], and other products. [[Cellulose]] is a natural, carbon-containing polymer produced by plants in the form of [[wood]], [[cotton]], [[linen]], and [[hemp]]. [[Cellulose]] is used primarily for maintaining structure in plants. Commercially valuable carbon polymers of animal origin include [[wool]], [[Cashmere wool|cashmere]] and [[silk]]. [[Plastics]] are made from synthetic carbon polymers, often with oxygen and nitrogen atoms included at regular intervals in the main polymer chain. The raw materials for many of these synthetic substances come from crude oil.

The uses of carbon and its compounds are extremely varied. It can form [[alloys]] with [[iron]], of which the most common is [[carbon steel]]. [[Graphite]] is combined with [[clay]]s to form the 'lead' used in [[pencil]]s used for [[writing]] and [[drawing]]. It is also used as a [[lubricant]] and a [[pigment]], as a molding material in [[glass]] manufacture, in [[electrodes]] for dry [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] and in [[electroplating]] and [[electroforming]], in [[brush (electric)|brushes]] for [[electric motors]] and as a [[neutron moderator]] in [[nuclear reactors]].

[[Charcoal]] is used as a drawing material in [[art]]work, barbecue [[grilling]], [[iron smelting]], and in many other applications. Wood, coal and oil are used as [[fuel]] for production of energy and [[heating]]. Gem quality [[diamond]] is used in jewelry, and [[industrial diamond]]s are used in drilling, cutting and polishing tools for machining metals and stone. Plastics are made from fossil hydrocarbons, and [[carbon fiber]], made by [[pyrolysis]] of synthetic [[polyester]] [[fiber]]s is used to reinforce plastics to form advanced, lightweight [[composite materials]].

[[Carbon fiber]] is made by pyrolysis of extruded and stretched filaments of [[polyacrylonitrile]] (PAN) and other organic substances. The crystallographic structure and mechanical properties of the fiber depend on the type of starting material, and on the subsequent processing. Carbon fibers made from PAN have structure resembling narrow filaments of graphite, but thermal processing may re-order the structure into a continuous rolled sheet. The result is fibers with higher [[specific strength|specific tensile strength]] than steel.&lt;ref name="cantwell"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=W. J.|last1=Cantwell|first2=J.|last2=Morton|title=The impact resistance of composite materials&amp;nbsp;– a review|journal=Composites|date=1991|volume=22|issue=5|pages=347–62|doi=10.1016/0010-4361(91)90549-V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carbon black]] is used as the black [[pigment]] in [[printing]] [[ink]], artist's oil paint and water colours, [[carbon paper]], automotive finishes, [[India ink]] and [[laser printer]] [[toner]].

===Diamonds===
The [[diamond]] industry falls into two categories: one dealing with gem-grade diamonds and the other, with industrial-grade diamonds. While a large trade in both types of diamonds exists, the two markets act in dramatically different ways.

Unlike [[precious metal]]s such as [[gold]] or [[platinum]], gem diamonds do not trade as a [[commodity]]: there is a substantial mark-up in the sale of diamonds, and there is not a very active market for resale of diamonds.

Industrial diamonds are valued mostly for their hardness and heat conductivity, with the gemological qualities of clarity and color being mostly irrelevant. About 80% of mined diamonds (equal to about 100 million carats or 20&amp;nbsp;tonnes annually) are unsuitable for use as gemstones are relegated for industrial use (known as ''[[bort]])''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Turning And Mechanical Manipulation|first=Ch.|last=Holtzapffel|publisher=Charles Holtzapffel|date=1856|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=omwPAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428063201/https://books.google.com/books?id=omwPAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover|archivedate=2016-04-28|df=}} [https://archive.org/details/turningmechanica02holtuoft Internet Archive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326085110/https://archive.org/details/turningmechanica02holtuoft |date=2016-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[synthetic diamond]]s, invented in the 1950s, found almost immediate industrial applications; 3&amp;nbsp;billion carats (600&amp;nbsp;[[tonne]]s) of synthetic diamond is produced annually.&lt;ref name="usgs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/diamond/|accessdate=2009-05-05|title=Industrial Diamonds Statistics and Information|publisher=United States Geological Survey|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506221551/http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/diamond/|archivedate=2009-05-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dominant industrial use of diamond is in cutting, drilling, grinding, and polishing. Most of these applications do not require large diamonds; in fact, most diamonds of gem-quality except for their small size can be used industrially. Diamonds are embedded in drill tips or saw blades, or ground into a powder for use in grinding and polishing applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=R.

A '''carbon offset''' is a reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide or [[greenhouse gas]]es made in order to compensate for or to offset an emission made elsewhere.&lt;ref name='wri'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wri.org/publication/bottom-line-offsets |title=Bottom Line on Offsets |publisher=World Resources Institute |first=Jenna |last=Goodward |first2=Alexia |last2=Kelly |date=August 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='ced'&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon offsets are measured in tonnes of [[carbon dioxide-equivalent]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e). One tonne of carbon offset represents the reduction of one tonne of carbon dioxide or its equivalent in other greenhouse gases.

There are two markets for carbon offsets. In the larger, compliance market, companies, governments, or other entities buy carbon offsets in order to comply with [[Emissions trading|caps]] on the total amount of carbon dioxide they are allowed to emit. For instance, an entity could be complying with obligations of Annex 1 Parties under the [[Kyoto Protocol]] or of liable entities under the [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|EU Emission Trading Scheme]], among others. In 2006, about $5.5 billion of carbon offsets were purchased in the compliance market, representing about 1.6 billion metric tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e reductions.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://carbonfinance.org/docs/Carbon_Trends_2007-_FINAL_-_May_2.pdf |title=State and Trends of the Carbon Market |year=2007 |publisher=World Bank}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the much smaller, voluntary market, individuals, companies, or governments purchase carbon offsets to mitigate their own greenhouse gas emissions from transportation, electricity use, and other sources. For example, an individual might purchase carbon offsets to compensate for the greenhouse gas emissions caused by personal air travel. Carbon offset vendors offer direct purchase of carbon offsets, often also offering other services such as designating a carbon offset project to support or measuring a purchaser's carbon footprint. In 2016, about $705 million of carbon offsets were purchased in the voluntary market, representing about 123.4 million metric tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e reductions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://www.forest-trends.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/doc_5591.pdf | title=Unlocking Potential: State of the Voluntary Carbon Markets 2017 |publisher=Ecosystem Marketplace |date=2018-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Offsets typically support projects that reduce the emission of greenhouse gases in the short- or long-term. A common project type is [[renewable energy]],&lt;ref name="carbonretirement.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbonretirement.com/Offsetting%20in%20the%20FTSE%20100|title=Carbon Retirement report: The state of voluntary carbon offsetting in the FTSE 100|date=2011-04-18|accessdate=2011-05-24}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as wind farms, biomass energy, or hydroelectric dams. Others include [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] projects, the destruction of industrial pollutants or agricultural byproducts, destruction of landfill methane, and forestry projects.&lt;ref name="CDM projects by type"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cdmpipeline.org/cdm-projects-type.htm |title=UNEP Risoe CDM/JI Pipeline Analysis and Database |publisher=UNEP Risoe Centre |date=2010-02-01 |accessdate=2010-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most popular carbon offset projects from a corporate perspective are energy efficiency and wind turbine projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecosecurities.com/Standalone/Carbon_Offsetting_Trends_Survey_2008/default.aspx EcoSecurities, ClimateBiz, Carbon Offsetting Trends Survey 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417032716/http://www.ecosecurities.com/Standalone/Carbon_Offsetting_Trends_Survey_2008/default.aspx |date=2009-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kyoto Protocol]] has sanctioned offsets as a way for governments and private companies to earn [[carbon credits]] that can be traded on a marketplace. The protocol established the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM), which validates and measures projects to ensure they produce authentic benefits and are genuinely "additional" activities that would not otherwise have been undertaken. Organizations that are unable to meet their emissions quota can offset their emissions by buying CDM-approved Certified Emissions Reductions.

Offsets may be cheaper or more convenient alternatives to reducing one's own fossil-fuel consumption. However, some critics object to carbon offsets, and question the benefits of certain types of offsets.&lt;ref name="Gillenwater et al."&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 6| issue = 711| pages = 85–87| last = Gillenwater

[[Due diligence]] is recommended to help businesses in the assessment and identification of "good quality" offsets to ensure offsetting provides the desired additional environmental benefits, and to avoid reputational risk associated with poor quality offsets.&lt;ref name="carbon-trust" /&gt;

Offsets are viewed as an important policy tool to maintain stable economies and to improve sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.emisoft.com/how-carbon-offsets-and-data-management-improve-sustainability/|title=How Carbon Offsets &amp; Environmental Data Management Improve Sustainability|last=|first=|date=|website=www.emisoft.com|publisher=Emisoft|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the hidden dangers of climate change policy is unequal prices of carbon in the economy, which can cause economic collateral damage if production flows to regions or industries that have a lower price of carbon—unless carbon can be purchased from that area, which offsets effectively permit, equalizing the price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview: Neal Dikeman Co-founder of Carbonflow on web technology's role in addressing climate change |url=http://www.carbonoffsetsdaily.com/carbonindustryinterviews/interview-neal-dikeman-co-founder-of-carbonflow-on-web-technologys-role-in-addressing-climate-change-10176.htm |publisher=Carbon Offsets Daily|date=2009-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==

Carbon offsets may represent six primary categories of greenhouse gases:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/tar/wg1/020.htm |title=Working Group I: The Scientific Basis |publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |year=2001 |accessdate=2010-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}), [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), [[perfluorocarbons]] (PFCs), [[hydrofluorocarbons]] (HFCs), and [[sulfur hexafluoride]] (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Friend, G. (2009). The Truth about Green Business. Upper Saddle River, NJ: FT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon offsets have several common features:

* ''Vintage.'' The vintage is the year in which the carbon reduction takes place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoclimatex.com/offsets/projectReport.jsf|title=ICE|publisher=|accessdate=6 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305231801/http://www.chicagoclimatex.com/offsets/projectReport.jsf|archive-date=2011-03-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Source.'' The source refers to the project or technology used in offsetting the carbon emissions. Projects can include land-use, methane, biomass, renewable energy and industrial energy efficiency. Projects may also have secondary benefits (co-benefits). For example, projects that reduce agricultural greenhouse gas emissions may improve water quality by reducing fertilizer usage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/sequestration/water_quality.html United States Environmental Protection Agency, Carbon Sequestration in Agriculture and Forestry]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Certification regime.'' The certification regime describes the systems and procedures that are used to certify and register carbon offsets. Different methodologies are used for measuring and verifying emissions reductions, depending on project type, size and location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdm.unfccc.int/methodologies/index.html|title=CDM: Methodologies|author=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|publisher=|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the CDM uses another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/pac/howto/index.html|title=CDM: How To ...|author=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|publisher=|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the voluntary market, a variety of industry standards exist. These include the [[Verified Carbon Standard]] and the [[Gold_Standard_(carbon_offset_standard)|Gold Standard]] that are implemented to provide third-party verification of carbon offset projects.&lt;ref name="carbon-trust"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbontrust.com/resources/reports/advice/offsetting-strategy-carbon-trust-three-stage-approach|title=Developing a robust carbon offsetting strategy|date=November 2006|publisher=Carbon Trust|language=English|accessdate=14 August 2012|location=[[United Kingdom]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some additional standards for the validation of co-benefits, including the CCBS, issued by [http://www.verra.org Verra] and the Social Carbon Standard,&lt;ref name="Social-Carbon-Standard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shapingsustainablemarkets.iied.org/socialcarbon |title=Social Carbon profile on database of market governance mechanisms|accessdate=9 May 2014|location=[[United Kingdom]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; issued by Ecologica Institute.

==Markets==

===Global market===
In 2009, 8.2 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent changed hands worldwide, up 68 per cent from 2008, according to the study by carbon-market research firm Point Carbon, of Washington and Oslo. But at EUR94 billion, or about $135 billion, the market's value was nearly unchanged compared with 2008, with world carbon prices averaging EUR11.40 a ton, down about 40 per cent from the previous year, according to the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Cassandra |last=Sweet |url=https://www.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20100106-712782.html |title=UPDATE: Global Carbon Trading Up In 2009, Though Prices Lower |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=2010-01-06 |accessdate=2010-03-03 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank's "State and Trends of the Carbon Market 2010"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/ENVIRONMENT/EXTCARBONFINANCE/0,,contentMDK:22592488~pagePK:64168445~piPK:64168309~theSitePK:4125853,00.html | title = State and Trends of the Carbon Market 2010 |publisher=World Bank Group |accessdate=2010-08-26}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; put the overall value of the market at $144 billion, but found that a significant part of this figure resulted from manipulation of a VAT loophole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.carbontradewatch.org/articles/carbon-market-growth-is-mainly-fraudulent-world-bank-report.html | title = Carbon market "growth" is mainly fraudulent, World Bank report shows |publisher=Carbon Trade Watch |last=Reyes |first=Oscar |date=2010-07-20 |accessdate=2010-08-26}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

* 90% of voluntary offset volumes were contracted by the private sector—where corporate social responsibility and industry leadership were primary motivations for offset purchases.&lt;ref name=market&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 Voluntary Carbon Markets Report|url=http://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/pages/dynamic/article.page.php?page_id=9789|website=Ecosystem Marketplace|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Offset buyers' desire to positively impact the climate resilience of their supply chain or sphere of influence was evident in our data which identifies a strong relationship between buyers’ business sectors and the project categories from which they contract offsets.&lt;ref name=market /&gt;

===E.U. market===
The global carbon market is dominated by the [[European Union]], where companies that emit greenhouse gases are required to cut their emissions or buy pollution allowances or carbon credits from the market, under the [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme]] (EU ETS). Europe, which has seen volatile carbon prices due to fluctuations in energy prices and supply and demand, will continue to dominate the global carbon market for another few years, as the U.S. and China—the world's top polluters—have yet to establish mandatory emission-reduction policies.

===U.S. market===
On the whole, the U.S. market remains primarily a voluntary market, but multiple cap and trade regimes are either fully implemented or near-imminent at the regional level. The first mandatory, market-based cap-and-trade program to cut CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the U.S., called the [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]] (RGGI), kicked into gear in Northeastern states in 2009, growing nearly tenfold to $2.5 billion, according to [http://www.pointcarbon.com Point Carbon]. [[Western Climate Initiative]] (WCI)—a regional cap-and-trade program including seven western states (California notably among them) and four Canadian provinces—has established a regional target for reducing heat-trapping emissions of 15 percent below 2005 levels by 2020.  A component of California's own [[Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006]], kicked off in early 2013, requires high-emissions industries to purchase carbon credits to cover emissions in excess of 25,000 CO2 metric tons.

===Voluntary market===
; Participants : A wide range of participants are involved in the voluntary market, including providers of different types of offsets, developers of quality assurance mechanisms, third party verifiers, and consumers who purchase offsets from domestic or international providers. Suppliers include for-profit companies, governments, charitable non-governmental organizations, colleges and universities, and other groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Carbon Offsets: The U.S. Voluntary Market Is Growing, but Quality Assurance Poses Challenges for Market Participants |url=https://www.gao.gov/new.items/d081048.pdf |pages=3&amp;ndash;4,10 |publisher=GAO |date=August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Motivations : According to industry analyst [[Ecosystem Marketplace]], the voluntary markets present the opportunity for citizen consumer action, as well as an alternative source of carbon finance and an incubator for carbon market innovation. In their survey of voluntary markets, data has shown that "[[Corporate Social Responsibility]]" and "Public Relations/Branding" are clearly in first place among motivations for voluntary offset purchases, with evidence indicating that companies seek to offset emissions "for goodwill, both of the general public and their investors".

: In addition, regarding market composition, research indicates: "Though many analysts perceive pre-compliance buying as a dominant driving force in the voluntary market, the results of our survey have repeatedly indicated that precompliance motives (as indicated by 'investment/resale and 'anticipation of regulation') remain secondary to those of the pure voluntary market (companies/individuals offsetting their emissions)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/documents/cms_documents/StateOfTheVoluntaryCarbonMarkets_2009.pdf New Carbon Finance 2009 State Of Voluntary Carbon Markets] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122070446/http://ecosystemmarketplace.com/documents/cms_documents/StateOfTheVoluntaryCarbonMarkets_2009.pdf |date=2009-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Pre-compliance &amp; trading : The other main category of buyers on the voluntary markets are those engaged in pre-compliance and/or trading. Those purchasing offsets for pre-compliance purposes are doing so with the expectation, or as a hedge against the possibility, of future mandatory cap and trade regulations. As a mandatory cap would sharply increase the price of offsets, firms—especially those with large carbon footprints and the corresponding financial exposure to regulation—make the decision to acquire offsets in advance at what are expected to be lower prices.

: The trading market in offsets in general resembles the trade in other commodities markets, with financial professionals including hedge funds and desks at major investment banks, taking positions in the hopes of buying cheap and selling dear, with their motivation typically short or medium term financial gain.

; Retail : Multiple players in the retail market have offerings that enable consumers and businesses to calculate their [[carbon footprint]], most commonly through a web-based interface including a calculator or questionnaire, and sell them offsets in the amount of that footprint.&lt;ref&gt;For a list of commercial offset retailers, refer to {{cite web |url=http://www.carboncatalog.org/ |title= Carbon Directory |publisher=Carbon Catalog |date=2010-10-04 |accessdate=2010-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition many companies selling products and services, especially carbon-intensive ones such as airline travel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishairways.com/travel/csr-your-footprint/public/en_gb|title=Customer Carbon Fund|publisher=|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.continental.com/web/en-US/content/company/globalcitizenship/offset.aspx|title=United Airlines - Airline Tickets, Travel Deals and Flights on united.com|publisher=|accessdate=6 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302194628/http://www.continental.com/web/en-US/content/company/globalcitizenship/offset.aspx|archive-date=2012-03-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; offer options to bundle a proportional offsetting amount of carbon credits with each transaction.

: Suppliers of voluntary offsets operate under both [[nonprofit]] and [[social enterprise]] models, or a blended approach sometimes referred to as [[triple bottom line]]. Other suppliers include broader environmentally focused organizations with website subsections or initiatives that enable retail voluntary offset purchases by members, and government created projects.

; Features of companies that voluntarily offset emissions : Companies that voluntarily offset their own emissions tend to be of relatively low [[carbon intensity]], as they can offset a significant proportion of their emissions at relatively low cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Tierney|url=http://www.climateactionprogramme.org/news/only_0.1_per_cent_of_ftse_100_emissions_are_offset/|title=Only 0.1 per cent of FTSE 100 emissions are offset|publisher=Climate Action|date=2011-04-18 |accessdate=2011-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voluntary offsetting is particularly common in the financial sector. 61 per cent of financial companies in the FTSE 100 offset at least a portion of their 2009 emissions. Twenty-two per cent of financial companies in the FTSE 100 considered their entire 2009 operations to be carbon neutral.&lt;ref name="carbonretirement.com"/&gt;

In 2015, the UNFCCC created a dedicated website where organizations, companies, but also private persons are able to offset their footprint with the aim of facilitating everyone's participation in the process of promoting sustainability on a voluntary basis.&lt;ref&gt;https://offset.climateneutralnow.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of offset projects==
The CDM identifies over 200 types of projects suitable for generating carbon offsets, which are grouped into broad categories. These project types include renewable energy, methane abatement, energy efficiency, reforestation and fuel switching.&lt;ref name="CDM projects by type"/&gt;

===Renewable energy===
[[Renewable energy]] offsets commonly include [[wind power]], [[solar power]], [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]] and [[biofuel]]. Some of these offsets are used to reduce the cost differential between renewable and conventional energy production, increasing the commercial viability of a choice to use renewable energy sources.  Emissions from burning fuel, such as red diesel, has pushed one UK fuel supplier to create a carbon offset fuel named [[Fuel dyes#Carbon Offset Red Diesel|Carbon Offset Red Diesel]].

[[Renewable Energy Credits]] (RECs) are also sometimes treated as carbon offsets, although the concepts are distinct. Whereas a carbon offset represents a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, a REC represents a quantity of energy produced from renewable sources. To convert RECs into offsets, the clean energy must be translated into carbon reductions, typically by assuming that the clean energy is displacing an equivalent amount of conventionally produced electricity from the local grid. This is known as an indirect offset (because the reduction doesn't take place at the project site itself, but rather at an external site), and some controversy surrounds the question of whether they truly lead to "additional" emission reductions and who should get credit for any reductions that may occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Gillenwater| first = Michael| title = Redefining RECs—Part 1: Untangling attributes and offsets| journal = Energy Policy| year = 2008 |doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2008.02.036| volume = 36| pages = 2109| issue = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Gillenwater| first = Michael| title = Redefining RECs (Part 2): Untangling certificates and emission markets| journal = Energy Policy| year = 2008 |doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2008.02.019| volume = 36| pages = 2120| issue = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intel corporation is the largest purchaser of renewable power in the US.&lt;ref&gt;E. Curry, B. Guyon, C. Sheridan, and B. Donnellan, [http://www.edwardcurry.org/publications/MISQE_SustainableIT_Intel_2012.pdf "Developing an Sustainable IT Capability: Lessons From Intel's Journey"], MIS Quarterly Executive, vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 61–74, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methane collection and combustion===
Some offset projects consist of the combustion or containment of [[methane]] generated by farm animals (by use of an [[anaerobic digester]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnproject.org/e-haubenschildfarm.html|title=Haubenschild Dairy Farm Digester|publisher=|accessdate=6 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150730030658/http://www.mnproject.org/e-haubenschildfarm.html|archive-date=2015-07-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; landfills&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/climateleaders/docs/ClimateLeaders_DraftLandfillOffsetProtocol.pdf EPA Draft Offset Protocol] [pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; or other industrial waste. Methane has a [[global warming potential]] (GWP) 23 times that of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; when combusted, each molecule of methane is converted to one molecule of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, thus reducing the global warming effect by 96%.

An example of a project using an [[anaerobic digester]] can be found in Chile where in December 2000, the largest pork production company in Chile, initiated a voluntary process to implement advanced waste management systems (anaerobic and aerobic digestion of hog manure), in order to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dcarbon8.com/supply-chain-network/carbonexchange/projectsandblends.php|title=dcarbon8.com|publisher=|accessdate=6 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923113359/http://dcarbon8.com/supply-chain-network/carbonexchange/projectsandblends.php|archive-date=2015-09-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy efficiency===
[[File:2009-11-30 - Chicago Climate Justice activists in Chicago - Cap'n'Trade protest 011.jpg|thumb|right|Chicago Climate Justice activists protesting cap and trade legislation in front of [[Chicago Climate Exchange]] building in Chicago Loop]]

{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2008}}
While carbon offsets that fund renewable energy projects help lower the [[carbon intensity]] of energy ''supply'', energy conservation projects seek to reduce the overall ''demand'' for energy. Carbon offsets in this category fund projects of several types:

# [[Cogeneration]] plants generate both electricity and heat from the same power source, thus improving upon the energy efficiency of most power plants, which waste the energy generated as heat.
# Fuel efficiency projects replace a combustion device with one using less fuel per unit of energy provided. Assuming energy demand does not change, this reduces the carbon dioxide emitted.
# [[Green building|Energy-efficient buildings]] reduce the amount of energy wasted in buildings through efficient heating, cooling or lighting systems. In particular, the replacement of incandescent [[light bulb]]s with [[compact fluorescent lamp]]s can have a drastic effect on energy consumption. New buildings can also be constructed using less carbon-intensive input materials.

===Destruction of industrial pollutants===
Industrial pollutants such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs) have a [[Global-warming potential|GWP]] many thousands of times greater than carbon dioxide by volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/highgwp/scientific.html |title=F-gases Emissions - Climate Change - US EPA |publisher= |accessdate=6 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018211612/http://www.epa.gov/highgwp/scientific.html |archivedate=18 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because these pollutants are easily captured and destroyed at their source, they present a large and low-cost source of carbon offsets. As a category, HFCs, PFCs, and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O reductions represent 71 per cent of offsets issued under the CDM.&lt;ref name="CDM projects by type"/&gt;

===Land use, land-use change and forestry===
Land use, land-use change and forestry ([[LULUCF]]) projects focus on natural [[carbon sink]]s such as forests and soil. Deforestation, particularly in Brazil, Indonesia and parts of Africa, account for about 20 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rainforests.mongabay.com/0801.htm|title=Deforestation|work=Mongabay.com|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deforestation can be avoided either by paying directly for forest preservation, or by using offset funds to provide substitutes for forest-based products. There is a class of mechanisms referred to as REDD schemes ([[Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation]]), which may be included in a post-Kyoto agreement. REDD credits provide carbon offsets for the protection of forests, and provide a possible mechanism to allow funding from developed nations to assist in the protection of native forests in developing nations.

Almost half of the world's people burn wood (or fiber or [[Feces|dung]]) for their cooking and heating needs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Fuel-efficient cook stoves can reduce fuel wood consumption by 30 to 50%, though the warming of the earth due to decreases in particulate matter (i.e. smoke) from such fuel-efficient stoves has not been addressed. There are a number of different types of LULUCF projects:

* '''Avoided [[deforestation]]''' is the protection of existing forests.
* '''[[Reforestation]]''' is the process of restoring forests on land that was once forested.
* '''[[Afforestation]]''' is the process of creating forests on land that was previously unforested, typically for longer than a generation.
* '''[[Soil management]]''' projects attempt to preserve or increase the amount of carbon sequestered in soil.

===Purchase of carbon allowances from emissions trading schemes===
Voluntary purchasers can offset their carbon emissions by purchasing carbon allowances from legally mandated cap-and-trade programs such as the [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]] or the European [[Emissions Trading Scheme]]. By purchasing the allowances that power plants, oil refineries, and industrial facilities need to hold to comply with a cap, voluntary purchases tighten the cap and force additional emissions reductions.

Voluntary purchases can also be made through small-scale and sometimes uncertified schemes such as those offered at South African based Promoting Access to Carbon Equity Centre (PACE),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carbon.org.za/] Carbon Equity Centre (PACE)&lt;/ref&gt; which nevertheless offer clear services such as poverty alleviation in the form of renewable energy development. Also, as "easy carbon credits are coming to an end",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altenergymag.com/news_detail.php?pr_id=5079] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161225003137/http://www.altenergymag.com/news_detail.php?pr_id=5079 |date=2016-12-25 }} The latest analysis from New Carbon Finance confirms that many of the low hanging fruit of cheap carbon credits in the developing world have now been harvested. Further opportunities for reducing emissions will require more effort, spurring investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency.
Submitted on 07/29/08, 10:26 AM&lt;/ref&gt; these projects have the potential to develop projects that are either too small or too complicated to benefit from legally mandated cap-and-trade programs.

===Links with emission trading schemes===
{{Main| Carbon Credit }}

Once it has been accredited by the [[UNFCCC]] a carbon offset project can be used as [[carbon credit]] and linked with official emission trading schemes, such as the [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/sb22/application/pdf/agenda_round_table_24_may.pdf] Round-Table Discussion on Policies and Measures-Source-UNFCCC Official Website&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Kyoto Protocol]], as [[Certified Emission Reduction]]s. European emission allowances for the 2008–2012 second phase were selling for between 21 and 24 Euros per metric ton of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as of July 2007.

The voluntary [[Chicago Climate Exchange]] also includes a carbon offset scheme that allows offset project developers to sell emissions reductions to CCX members who have voluntarily agreed to meet emissions reduction targets.

The [[Western Climate Initiative]], a regional greenhouse gas reduction initiative by states and provinces along the western rim of North America, includes an offset scheme. Likewise, the [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]], a similar program in the northeastern U.S., includes an offset program. A credit mechanism that uses offsets may be incorporated in proposed schemes such as the Australian Carbon Exchange.

===Other===
A UK offset provider set up a carbon offsetting scheme that set up a secondary market for [[treadle pump]]s in developing countries. These pumps are used by farmers, using human power, in place of [[Diesel engine|diesel]] pumps.&lt;ref name="treadle"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/carbonoffsetting-all-credit-to-them-430740.html |title=Carbon-offsetting: All credit to them |newspaper= The Independent |date=2007-01-04 |accessdate=2010-02-23 |first=James |last=Hopkirk | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, given that treadle pumps are best suited to pumping shallow water, while diesel pumps are usually used to pump water from deep boreholes, it is not clear that the treadle pumps are actually achieving real emissions reductions. Other companies have explored and rejected treadle pumps as a viable carbon offsetting approach due to these concerns.

===Carbon retirement===

[[Carbon retirement]] involves retiring allowances from [[Emissions trading#Trading systems|emission trading schemes]] as a method for offsetting carbon emissions. Under schemes such as the [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme]], EU Emission Allowances (EUAs), which represent the right to release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, are issued to all the largest polluters. The theory is that by buying these allowances and permanently removing them, the price of EUAs increases and provides an incentive for industrial companies to reduce their emissions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.carbonretirement.com/content/how-it-works Carbon Retirement website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accounting for and verifying reductions==

Due to their indirect nature, many types of offset are difficult to verify. Some providers obtain independent certification that their offsets are accurately measured, to distance themselves from potentially fraudulent competitors. The credibility of the various certification providers is often questioned. Certified offsets may be purchased from commercial or non-profit organizations for US$2.75–99.00 per [[tonne]] of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref name="priceoverview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecobusinesslinks.com/surveys/carbon-offsetting-price-survey/ |title=Carbon Offsetting + Price Survey!  |accessdate=11 August 2016 |date=11 August 2016 |publisher=EcoBusinessLinks }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to fluctuations of market price. [[List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions per capita|Annual carbon dioxide emissions]] in developed countries range from 6 to 23 tons per capita.

Accounting systems differ on precisely what constitutes a valid offset for voluntary reduction systems and for mandatory reduction systems. However formal standards for quantification exist based on collaboration between emitters, regulators, environmentalists and project developers. These standards include the [[Voluntary Carbon Standard]], Green-e Climate, Chicago Climate Exchange and the [[Gold_Standard_(carbon_offset_standard)|Gold Standard]], the latter of which expands upon the requirements for the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] of the [[Kyoto Protocol]].

=== Criteria for quality offsets ===
Accounting of offsets may address the following basic areas:

* Baseline and Measurement—What emissions would occur in the absence of a proposed project? And how are the emissions that occur after the project is performed going to be measured?
* Additionality—Would the project occur anyway without the investment raised by selling carbon offset credits? There are two common reasons why a project may lack additionality: (a) if it is intrinsically financially worthwhile due to energy cost savings, and (b) if it had to be performed due to environmental laws or regulations.
* Permanence—Are some benefits of the reductions reversible? (for example, trees may be harvested to burn the wood, and does growing trees for fuel wood decrease the need for [[fossil fuel]]?) If woodlands are increasing in area or density, then [[carbon dioxide sink|carbon is being sequestered]]. After roughly 50 years, newly planted forests will reach maturity and [[carbon dioxide sink|remove carbon dioxide]] more slowly.
* [[Carbon leakage|Leakage]]—Does implementing the project cause higher emissions outside the project boundary?
* Co-benefits—Are there other benefits in addition to the carbon emissions reduction, and to what degree?

=== Co-benefits ===
While the primary goal of carbon offsets is to reduce global carbon emissions, many offset projects also claim to lead to improvements in the quality of life for a local population. These additional improvements are termed ''co-benefits'', and may be considered when evaluating and comparing carbon offset projects. For example, possible co-benefits from a project that replaces wood-burning stoves with ovens using a less carbon-intensive fuel could include:

* Lower non–greenhouse gas pollution (smoke, ash, and chemicals), which improves health in the home.
* Better preservation of forests, which are an important habitat for wildlife.

Offset projects can also lead to co-benefits such as better air and water quality, and healthier communities.&lt;ref name=benefits&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pacific Carbon Trust |title=What are the benefits of offsets? |url=http://www.pacificcarbontrust.com/what-we-do/offsets-and-climate-change/what-is-a-carbon-offset/ |website=Pacific Carbon Trust |accessdate=27 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707073809/http://pacificcarbontrust.com/what-we-do/offsets-and-climate-change/what-is-a-carbon-offset |archivedate=7 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent survey conducted by EcoSecurities, Conservation International, CCBA and ClimateBiz, of the 120 corporates surveyed more than 77 per cent rated community and environmental benefits as the prime motivator for purchasing carbon offsets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecosecurities.com/Standalone/Forest_Carbon_Offsetting_Trends_Survey_2009/default.aspx EcoSecurities, Conservation International, CCBA, ClimateBiz, Forest Carbon Offsetting Trends 2009 Survey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517113556/http://www.ecosecurities.com/Standalone/Forest_Carbon_Offsetting_Trends_Survey_2009/default.aspx |date=2009-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon offset projects can also negatively affect quality of life. For example, people who earn their livelihoods from collecting firewood and selling it to households could become unemployed if firewood is no longer used. A July 2007 paper from the [[Overseas Development Institute]] offers some indicators to be used in assessing the potential developmental impacts of voluntary carbon offset schemes:&lt;ref name="developmentbenefits"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.odi.org/publications/11-can-standards-voluntary-carbon-offsets-ensure-development-benefits |title=Can standards for voluntary carbon offsets ensure development benefits? |accessdate=2018-11-19 |date=July 2007 |publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* What potential does the project have for income generation?
* What effects might a project have on future changes in land use and could conflicts arise from this?
* Can small-scale producers engage in the scheme?
* What are the 'add on' benefits to the country—for example, will it assist capacity-building in local institutions?&lt;ref name="carbonmarketspoor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=23&amp;title=making-voluntary-carbon-markets-work-poor-case-forestry-offsets |title=Making Voluntary Carbon Markets work better for the Poor: the case of Forestry Offsets |accessdate=2007 |year=2006 |publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307113714/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=23&amp;title=making-voluntary-carbon-markets-work-poor-case-forestry-offsets |archivedate=2012-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Putting a price on carbon encourages '''innovation''' by providing funding for new ways to reduce greenhouse gases in many sectors. Carbon reduction goals drive the demand for offsets and carbon trading, encouraging the development of this new industry and offering opportunities for different sectors to develop and use innovative new technologies.&lt;ref name=benefits /&gt;

Carbon offset projects also provide savings – energy efficiency measures may reduce fuel or electricity consumption, leading to a potential reduction in maintenance and operating costs.&lt;ref name=benefits /&gt;

The UNFCCC has created a dedicated website where CDM activities and prior consideration projects are able to report their co-benefits on a voluntary basis.&lt;ref&gt;http://cdmcobenefits.unfccc.int/Pages/SD-Reports.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quality assurance schemes==

===Quality Assurance Standard for Carbon Offsetting (QAS)===

In an effort to inform and safeguard business and household consumers purchasing Carbon Offsets, in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;DECC to close carbon offset accreditation scheme: {{cite web |url=http://www.greenwisebusiness.co.uk/news/decc-to-close-carbon-offset-accreditation-scheme-2356.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005094244/http://www.greenwisebusiness.co.uk/news/decc-to-close-carbon-offset-accreditation-scheme-2356.aspx |archivedate=2014-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[UK Government]] has launched a scheme for regulating Carbon offset products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://offsetting.defra.gov.uk/ The UK Government's Quality Assurance Scheme for Carbon Offsetting] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091224192831/http://offsetting.defra.gov.uk/ |date=2009-12-24 }} UK Government DEFRA, 9 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[DEFRA]] have created the "Approved Carbon Offsetting" brand to use as an endorsement on offsets&lt;ref&gt;[http://offsetting.defra.gov.uk/cms/approved-offsets/ List of DEFRA QAS approved Offsets] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921050744/http://offsetting.defra.gov.uk/cms/approved-offsets/ |date=September 21, 2009 }} UK Government DEFRA, 9 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; approved by the UK government.
The Scheme sets standards for best practice in offsetting. Approved offsets have to demonstrate the following criteria:
* Accurate calculation of emissions to be offset
* Use of good quality carbon credits i.e. initially those that are Kyoto compliant
* Cancellation of carbon credits within a year of the consumers purchase of the offset
* Clear and transparent pricing of the offset
* Provision of information about the role of offsetting in tackling climate change and advice on how a consumer can reduce his or her carbon footprint
The first company to qualify for the scheme was [[Clear (UK company)|Clear]], followed by Carbon Footprint, Carbon Passport, Pure, [[British Airways]] and [[Carbon Retirement Ltd]].

On 20 May 2011 the [[Department of Energy and Climate Change]] announced that the Quality Assurance Scheme would close on 30 June 2011.&lt;ref name="offsetting.decc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://offsetting.decc.gov.uk/|title=Closure of the Quality Assurance Scheme for Carbon Offsetting|publisher=Department of Energy and Climate Change|date=2011-05-20|accessdate=2011-05-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616150734/http://offsetting.decc.gov.uk/|archive-date=2011-06-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stated purpose of the Quality Assurance Scheme was 'to provide a straightforward route for those wishing to offset their emissions to identify quality offsets'.&lt;ref name="offsetting.decc" /&gt; Critics of the closure therefore argued that without the scheme, businesses and individuals would struggle to identify quality carbon offsets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Will Nichols|url=http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2072949/cancellation-offset-assurance-scheme-leave-businesses-dark|title=Cancellation of offset assurance scheme could leave businesses in the dark|publisher=businessGreen|date=2011-05-23|accessdate=2011-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the scheme was relaunched as the Quality Assurance Standard (QAS).&lt;ref&gt;QAS: http://qascarbonneutral.com&lt;/ref&gt; The QAS is now run independently by Quality Assurance Standard Ltd which is a company limited by guarantee based in the United Kingdom. The Quality Assurance Standard is a comprehensive independent audit system for carbon offsets. Approved offsets are checked against a 40-point checklist&lt;ref&gt;40 Point Check List: http://qascarbonoffsetting.com/qas-40-point-carbon-offset-checklist/&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure they meet the very highest standards in the world.

On 17 July 2012, the first organisations were approved as meeting the new QAS.

===Australian Government National Carbon Offset Program===

The Australian government is currently in a consultation period on the regulation of Carbon Offsets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.climatechange.gov.au/nav/carbon_offset.html Australian Government National Carbon Offset ] Australian Government, 9 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
On 20 December 2013, the Australian Government released the Emissions Reduction Fund Green Paper outlining its preferred design options for the Emissions Reduction Fund: a carbon buy-back model. The Government invites public comment and written submissions on the Green Paper by 5pm on Friday 21 February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/66237232-3042-4cd8-99a3-040705fead3b/files/erf-green-paper_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
{{Criticism section|date=May 2013}}

===Project-offsetting===

Less than 30 pence in every pound spent on some carbon offset schemes goes directly to projects designed to reduce emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.carbonretirement.com/project-offsetting-costs |title=Carbon Retirement report: The efficiency of carbon offsetting through the CDM |date=2009-12-07 |accessdate=2011-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figures reported by the BBC&lt;ref&gt;

The project's investors take 19p, with smaller amounts of money being distributed between organisations involved in brokering and auditing the carbon credits. In that respect carbon Offsets are similar to most consumer products, with only a fraction of sale prices going to the off-shore producers, the rest being shared between investors and distributors who bring it to the markets, who themselves need to pay their employees and service providers such as advertising agencies most of the time located in expensive areas.

===Indulgence controversy===

Some activists disagree with the principle of carbon offsets, likening them to Roman Catholic [[indulgence]]s, a way for the guilty to pay for absolution rather than changing their behavior. [[George Monbiot]], an English environmentalist and writer, says that carbon offsets are an excuse for business as usual with regard to pollution.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of offsets claim that third-party certified carbon offsets are leading to increased investment in renewable energy, energy efficiency, methane biodigesters and reforestation and avoided deforestation projects{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}, and claim that these alleged effects are the intended goal of carbon offsets. On October 16, 2009 [[responsibletravel.com]], once a strong voice in favour of carbon offsetting, announced that it would stop offering carbon offsetting to its clients, stating that "too often offsets are being used by the tourism industry in developed countries to justify growth plans on the basis that money will be donated to projects in developing countries. Global reduction targets will not be met this way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

===Effectiveness of tree-planting offsets===
Some environmentalists have questioned the effectiveness of [[Treeplanting|tree-planting projects]] for carbon offset purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.davidsuzuki.org/Climate_Change/What_You_Can_Do/trees3.asp |title=The Problems with Offsets from Tree Planting |publisher=David Suzuki Foundation |year=2009 |accessdate=2010-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212232904/http://www.davidsuzuki.org/Climate_Change/What_You_Can_Do/trees3.asp |archivedate=2010-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics point to the following issues with tree planting projects:

* '''Timing.''' Trees reach maturity over a course of many decades. Project developers and offset retailers typically pay for the project and sell the promised reductions up-front, a practice known as "forward selling".
* '''Permanence.''' It is difficult to guarantee the permanence of the forests, which may be susceptible to clearing, burning, or mismanagement. The well-publicized instance of the "Coldplay forest", in which a forestry project supported by the British band [[Coldplay]] resulted in a grove of dead mango trees, illustrates the difficulties of guaranteeing the permanence of tree-planting offsets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Amrit |last=Dhillon |first2=Toby |last2=Harnden |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/1517031/How-Coldplays-green-hopes-died-in-the-arid-soil-of-India.html |title=How Coldplay's green hopes died in the arid soil of India |newspaper=Telegraph |date=2006-04-30 |accessdate=2010-02-23 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; When discussing "tree offsets, forest campaigner Jutta Kill of European environmental group [[FERN]], clarified the physical reality that "Carbon in trees is temporary: Trees can easily release carbon into the atmosphere through fire, disease, climatic changes, natural decay and timber harvesting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newint.org/features/2006/07/01/carbon-cycle/ |title=10 things you should know about tree 'offsets' |author=Jutta Kill |date=July 2006 |work= |publisher= [[New Internationalist]]|accessdate=21 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Monocultures and invasive species.''' In an effort to cut costs, some tree-planting projects introduce fast-growing invasive species that end up damaging native forests and reducing biodiversity. For example, in Ecuador, the Dutch [[FACE Foundation]] has an offset project in the Andean [[Páramo]] involving 220 square kilometres of [[eucalyptus]] and pine planted. The NGO [[Acción Ecológica]] criticized the project for destroying a valuable Páramo ecosystem by introducing exotic tree species, causing the release of much soil carbon into the atmosphere, and harming local communities who had entered into contracts with the FACE Foundation to plant the trees.&lt;ref name="FACE-PROFAFOR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrm.org.uy/countries/Ecuador/face.html |title=Carbon Sink Plantations in the Ecuadorian Andes: Impacts of the Dutch FACE-PROFAFOR monoculture tree plantations project on indigenous and peasant communities |accessdate=2007 |author=Acción Ecológica Ecuador |date=May 2005 |format=PDF |publisher=World Rainforest Movement |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209141916/http://www.wrm.org.uy/countries/Ecuador/face.html |archivedate=2012-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some certification standards, such as the Climate Community and Biodiversity Standard require multiple species plantings.
* '''[[Methane]].''' A recent study has claimed that plants are a significant source of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, raising the possibility that trees and other terrestrial plants may be significant contributors to global methane levels in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Keppler et al."&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Keppler F, Hamilton JT, Brass M, Röckmann T |year= 2006|title=Methane emissions from terrestrial plants under aerobic conditions|journal=Nature|volume=439|pages=187–191|pmid=16407949|doi=10.1038/nature04420|issue=7073|bibcode=2006Natur.439..187K}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this claim has been disputed recently by findings in another study.&lt;ref name="Dueck et al."&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dueck TA|year= 2007|title=No evidence for substantial aerobic methane emission by terrestrial plants: a 13C-labelling approach|journal=New Phytologist|volume=175|pages=29–35|pmid=17547664|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2007.02103.x|issue=1|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Albedo|The albedo effect]].''' Another study suggested that "high latitude forests probably have a net warming effect on the Earth's climate", because their absorption of sunlight creates a warming effect that balances out their absorption of carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/324200.pdf Climate Effects of Global Land Cover Change]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Necessity.''' Corporate tree-planting is not a new idea; farming operations have been used by companies making [[paper]] from trees for a long time. If farmed trees are replanted, and the products made from them are placed into [[landfills]] rather than [[recycled]], a very safe, efficient, economical and time-proven method of [[Carbon sink#Geological sequestration|geological sequestration]] of greenhouse carbon is the result of the paper product use cycle. This only holds if the paper in the land fill is not decomposted. In most landfills, this is the case and leads to the fact that more than half of the [[greenhouse gas]] emissions from the life cycle of paper products occur from landfill [[methane emissions]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

===Indigenous land rights issues===
Tree-planting projects can cause conflicts with indigenous people who are displaced or otherwise find their use of forest resources curtailed. For example, a [[World Rainforest Movement]] report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrm.org.uy/countries/Uganda/Place_Store_Carbon.pdf |title=A funny place to store carbon: UWA-FACE Foundation's tree planting project in Mount Elgon National Park, Uganda |accessdate=2007 |author=Chris Lang |author2=Timothy Byakola |date=December 2006 |format=PDF |publisher=[[World Rainforest Movement]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209141920/http://www.wrm.org.uy/countries/Uganda/Place_Store_Carbon.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; documents land disputes and [[human rights]] abuses at [[Mount Elgon]]. In March 2002, a few days before receiving Forest Stewardship Council certification for a project near Mount Elgon, the [[Uganda Wildlife Authority]] evicted more than 300 families from the area and destroyed their homes and crops. That the project was taking place in an area of on-going land conflict and alleged human rights abuses did not make it into project report.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}
A 2011 report by [[Oxfam International]] describes a case where over 20,000 farmers in Uganda were displaced for a FSC-certified plantation to offset carbon by London-based New Forests Company&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redd-monitor.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/cs-new-forest-company-uganda-plantations-220911-en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225103422/http://www.redd-monitor.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/cs-new-forest-company-uganda-plantations-220911-en.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additionality and lack of regulation in the voluntary market===

Several certification standards exist, offering variations for measuring emissions baseline, reductions, [[additionality]], and other key criteria. However, no single standard governs the industry, and some offset providers have been criticized on the grounds that carbon reduction claims are exaggerated or misleading. Problems include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/48e334ce-f355-11db-9845-000b5df10621.html |title=Industry caught in carbon 'smokescreen' |first=Fiona |last=Harvey |first2=Stephen |last2=Fidler |newspaper=Financial Times |date=2007-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Other periodicals that have covered these issues include the ''Christian Science Monitor'' [http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0110/p13s02-sten.html], ''The Guardian'' [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/jun/16/climatechange.climatechange], ''Mother Jones'' [https://www.motherjones.com/commentary/columns/2007/05/practical_values.html], and ''The New York Times'' [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/29/weekinreview/29revkin.html?ex=1335499200&amp;en=d9e2407e4f1a20f0&amp;ei=5124].

&lt;blockquote&gt;
*Widespread instances of people and organizations buying worthless credits that do not yield any reductions in carbon emissions.
*Industrial companies profiting from doing very little – or from gaining carbon credits on the basis of efficiency gains from which they have already benefited substantially.
*Brokers providing services of questionable or no value.
*A shortage of verification, making it difficult for buyers to assess the true value of carbon credits.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Perverse incentives===

Because offsets provide a revenue stream for the reduction of some types of emissions, they can in some cases provide incentives to emit more, so that emitting entities can later get credit for reducing emissions from an artificially high baseline. This is especially the case for offsets with a high profit margin. For example, one Chinese company generated $500 million in carbon offsets by installing a $5&amp;nbsp;million incinerator to burn the [[haloalkane#HFC|HFC]]s produced by the manufacture of refrigerants. The huge profits provided incentive to create new factories or expand existing factories solely for the purpose of increasing production of HFCs and then destroying the resultant pollutants to generate offsets. Not only is this outcome environmentally undesirable, it undermines other offset projects by causing offset prices to collapse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdm.unfccc.int/public_inputs/inputam0001/Comment_AM0001_Schwank_081004.pdf Concerns about CDM projects based on decomposition of HFC-23 emissions from 22 HCFC production sites]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Keith |last=Bradsher |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/21/business/21pollute.html |title=Outsize Profits, and Questions, in Effort to Cut Warming Gases |newspaper=The New York Times |date=2006-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice had become so common that offset credits are now no longer awarded for new plants to destroy [[Fluoroform|HFC-23]].&lt;ref name=" Mukerjee "&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mukerjee | first = Madhussree | year = 2009 |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=a-mechanism-of-hot-air&amp;print=true |title = A Mechanism of Hot Air | journal = [[Scientific American]] | volume = | issue = June | pages = 9–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Nigeria]] oil companies ''[[Gas flare|flare off]]'' 40 per cent of the [[natural gas]] found. The [[Agip|Agip Oil Company]] plans to build plants to generate electricity from this gas and thus claim 1.5 million offset credits a year. United States company [[Pan Ocean Oil Corporation]] has also applied for credits in exchange for processing its own waste gas in Nigeria. Oilwatch.org's Michael Karikpo calls this "outrageous", as flaring is illegal in Nigeria, adding that "''It's like a criminal demanding money to stop committing crimes''".&lt;ref name=" Mukerjee "/&gt;

===Other negative impacts from offset projects===

Although many carbon offset projects tout their environmental co-benefits, some are accused of having negative secondary effects. Point Carbon has reported on an inconsistent approach with regard to some [[hydro-electric]] projects as carbon offsets; some countries in the EU are not allowing large projects into the [[EU ETS]], because of their environmental impacts, even though they have been individually approved by the UNFCCC and [[World Commission on Dams]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rivernet.org/prs07_04.htm#091007 ECX bans CERs from big hydro projects over EU eligibility uncertainty] Point Carbon via River News, 9 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult to assess the exact results of carbon offsets given the fact that they are a relatively new form of carbon reduction, and it is possible that some carbon offset purchases are made in an attempt to increase positive business public relations rather than to help solve the issue of greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=Charles|title=Carbon Offsets: Growing Pains in a Growing Market.|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|year=2009|volume=11|issue=2|pages=62–68|doi=10.1289/ehp.117-a62}}&lt;!--|accessdate=8 October 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Offset projects may also have negative social impacts, for example when local residents are evicted to enable a National Park to be marketed as a carbon offset.&lt;ref&gt;''[[CounterPunch]]'', 9 September 2009, [http://www.counterpunch.org/checker09092009.html Double Jeopardy: Carbon Offsets and Human Rights Abuses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912080347/http://www.counterpunch.org/checker09092009.html |date=2009-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dockworkers in Cap-Haitien.jpg|thumb|A [[Haiti]]an hand cart.]]
A '''cart''' is a [[vehicle]] designed for [[transport]], using two [[wheel]]s and normally pulled by one or a pair of [[draught animal]]s.  A ''handcart'' is pulled or pushed by one or more people. It is different from a dray or [[wagon]], which is a heavy transport vehicle with ''four'' wheels and typically two or more horses, or a [[carriage]], which is used exclusively for transporting humans.

Over time, the term "cart" has come to mean nearly any small conveyance, from [[shopping cart]]s to [[golf cart]]s or [[Side by Side (UTV)|UTVs]], without regard to number of wheels, load carried, or means of propulsion.

The draught animals used for carts may be [[horse]]s, [[donkey]]s or [[mule]]s, [[ox]]en, and even smaller animals such as [[goat]]s or large [[dog]]s.

==History==
[[File:Hand-propelled wheel cart from Indus Valley Civilization.GIF|thumb|Hand-propelled wheel cart, [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (3000–1500 BCE). Housed at the [[National Museum, New Delhi]].]]

Carts have been mentioned in literature as far back as the second millennium B.C. The Indian sacred book [[Rigveda]] states that men and women are as equal as two wheels of a cart. Hand-carts pushed by humans have been used around the world. In the 19th century, for instance, some [[Mormon handcart pioneers|Mormon]]s travelling across the plains of the [[United States]] between 1856 and 1860 used handcarts.&lt;ref&gt;Lyndia Carter, “Handcarts,” in ''Encyclopedia of Latter-day Saint History'', 461–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of the cart is closely tied to the [[Wheel#History|history of the wheel]].

Carts were often used for judicial punishments, both to transport the condemned &amp;ndash; a [[public humiliation]] in itself (in [[Ancient Rome]] defeated leaders were often carried in the victorious general's [[Roman triumph|triumph]]) &amp;ndash; and even, in England until its substitution by the [[pillory|whipping post]] under [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]], to tie the condemned to the ''cart-tail'' and administer him or her a public whipping.

==Types of carts==

Larger carts may be drawn by [[animal]]s, such as [[horse]]s, [[mule]]s, or [[ox]]en. They have been in continuous use since the invention of the wheel, in the 4th millennium BC. Carts may be named for the animal that pulls them, such as ''horsecart'' or ''oxcart''. In modern times, horsecarts are used in competition while [[draft horse showing]]. A ''[[dogcart]]'', however, is usually a cart designed to ''carry'' [[hunting dog]]s: an open cart with two cross-seats back to back; the dogs could be penned between the rear-facing seat and the back end.

The term "cart" (synonymous in this sense with ''chair'') is also used for various kinds of lightweight, two-wheeled [[carriages]], some of them ''[[sprung cart]]s'' (or ''spring carts''), especially those used as open pleasure or sporting vehicles. They could be drawn by a horse, pony or dog. Examples include:

*''cocking cart'': short-bodied, high, two-wheeled, seat for a groom behind the box; for [[tandem]] driving&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caaonline.com/caa_content.asp?PageType=Dept&amp;Key=15&amp;MCat=16 CAAOnline: Carriage Tour.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027142119/http://www.caaonline.com/caa_content.asp?PageType=Dept&amp;Key=15&amp;MCat=16 |date=October 27, 2007 }} The Carriage Association of America, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''dead cart'' to carry victims of the plague&lt;ref&gt;[http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Proceedings%20of%20History%20Week/PHW%201983/04s.pdf pp. 61-62].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.04(1964-67)/MH.4(1967)4/orig05.pdf p. 279].&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[dogcart]]'': light, usually one horse, commonly two-wheeled and high, two transverse seats set back to back
*''donkey cart'': underslung axle, two lengthwise seats; also called ''pony cart, tub-cart''
*''&lt;span id="float" &gt;[[Float (horse-drawn)|float]]&lt;/span&gt;'': a dropped axle to give an especially low loadbed, for carrying heavy or unstable items such as [[milk churn]]s. The name survives today as a [[milkfloat]].
*''[[governess cart]]'': light, two-wheeled, entered from the rear, body partly or wholly of [[wickerwork]], seat for two persons along each side; also called ''governess car, tub-cart''
*''[[ralli car]]t'': light, two-wheeled, horse-drawn, for two persons facing forward, or four, two facing forward and two rearward.  The seat is adjustable fore-and-aft to keep the vehicle balanced for two or four people.
*''stolkjaerre'': two-wheeled, front seat for two, rear seat for the driver; used in Norway

* ''Pushcart'', a cart that is pushed by one or more persons:
** ''[[Baggage cart]]'', pushed by travelers to carry individual luggage
** ''Serving cart'', also named ''pushcart or'' ''go-cart'' is a hand-cart used for serving:
*** ''[[Food cart]]'', a mobile kitchen that is set up on the street to facilitate the sale and marketing of street food to people from the local pedestrian traffic.
*** ''Food service cart'', also named ''serving trolley'', for serving the food in a restaurant
*** ''Pastry cart'', for serving pastry
*** ''Tea cart'', also named ''teacart'', ''tea trolley'' and ''tea wagon'', for serving tea or other drinks

The builder of a cart may be known as a ''cartwright''; the surname "Carter" also derives from the occupation of transporting goods by cart or wagon.
Carts have many different shapes, but the basic idea of transporting material (or maintaining a collection of materials in a portable fashion) remains. Carts may have a pair of shafts, one along each side of the draught animal that supports the forward-balanced load in the cart. The shafts are supported by a saddle on the horse. Alternatively (and normally where the animals are oxen or buffalo), the cart may have a single pole between a pair of animals.  The draught traces attach to the axle of the vehicle or to the shafts. The traces are attached to a collar (on horses), to a yoke (on other heavy draught animals) or to a harness on dogs or other light animals.

Traces are made from a range of materials depending on the load and frequency of use. Heavy draught traces are made from [[iron]] or [[steel]] chain. Lighter traces are often leather and sometimes hemp [[rope]], but plaited horse-hair and other similar decorative materials can be used.

The dray is often associated with the transport of [[barrel (storage)|barrels]], particularly of [[beer]].

Of the cart types not animal-drawn, perhaps the most common example today is the [[shopping cart]] ([[British English]]: shopping [[wiktionary:trolley|trolley]]), which has also come to have a [[metaphor]]ical meaning in relation to online purchases (here, British English uses the metaphor of the shopping [[basket]]). Shopping carts first made their appearance in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]] in 1937.

In [[golf]], both manual push or pull and [[electric golf trolley]]s are designed to carry a [[golf]]er's bag, clubs and other equipment. Also, the [[golf cart]], car, or buggy, is a powered vehicle that carries golfers and their equipment around a golf course faster and with less effort than walking.

A ''[[Porter (carrier)|Porter's trolley]]'' is a type of small, hand-propelled wheeled platform. This can also be called a [[baggage cart]].
since the 13th century.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Autocarts are a type of small, hand-propelled wheeled utility carts having a pivoting base for collapsible storage in vehicles. They eliminate the need for plastic or paper shopping bags and are also used by [[tradesperson]]s to carry tools, equipment or supplies.

A [[soap-box cart]] (also known as a Billy Cart, Go-Cart, Trolley etc.) is a popular children's construction project on wheels, usually pedaled, but also intended for a test race. Similar, but more sophisticated are modern-day pedal cart toys used in general recreation and racing.

An electric cart is an [[electric vehicle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alaskaair.com/content/travel-info/accessible-services/specialservices-wheelchair.aspx |title=Mobility and Wheelchair Assistance - Alaska Airlines |publisher=Alaskaair.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[Go-Kart]]", which exists since 1959, also shortened as "[[Kart]]", an alternative spelling of "cart", refers to a tiny [[race car]] with frame and [[two-stroke engine]]; the old term ''go-cart'' originally meant a [[sedan chair]] or an [[infant walker]]

The '''Center for Biofilm Engineering''' ('''CBE''') is an interdisciplinary research, education, and technology transfer institution located on the central campus of [[Montana State University]] in [[Bozeman, Montana]]. The center was founded in April 1990 as the '''Center for Interfacial Microbial Process Engineering''' with a grant from the [[Engineering Research Centers]] (ERC) program of the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF).&lt;ref name=charter&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.biofilm.montana.edu/files/CBE/NSF-awd-lttr_CIMPEwb.pdf |title=Original Charter |publisher=National Science Foundation |date=April 15, 1990 |format=pdf |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CBE integrates faculty from multiple university departments to lead multidisciplinary research teams—including graduate and undergraduate students—to advance fundamental [[biofilm]] knowledge, develop beneficial uses for microbial biofilms, and find solutions to industrially relevant biofilm problems. The center tackles biofilm issues including [[chronic wounds]], [[bioremediation]], and [[microbial corrosion]] through cross-disciplinary research and education among [[engineers]], [[microbiologists]] and industry.&lt;ref name=Invade/&gt;&lt;ref name=CBEResearch/&gt;

==History==
The center originated as the Institute for Chemical and Biological Process Analysis (IPA) in 1983.&lt;ref name=CBE1990/&gt; In 1990, the center became a national ERC as the Center for Interfacial Microbial Process Engineering based on a $7.2 million grant from the NSF.&lt;ref name="Environment/Ecology Grants"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/11538/title/Science-Grants/ |title=Environment/Ecology Grants |journal=The Scientist |volume=4 |number=24 |page=25 |date=December 10, 1990 |accessdate=2015-02-27|quote=To establish new Center for Interfacial Microbial Process Engineering; work will focus on biofouling and biocorrosion, bioremediation, and biohydrometallurgy. $7.2 million from NSF to Montana State University, Bozeman. |publisher=LabX Media Group |location=Midland, Ontario, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 the center assumed its current name-Center for Biofilm Engineering. The original grants expired in 2001 and the center became self-sufficient. The center celebrated its 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary as an NSF ERC in 2015.

===Institute for Chemical and Biological Process Analysis (1979–1990)===
In 1979 W.G. (Bill) Characklis came to Montana State University from [[Rice University]] as a professor in civil (environmental) and chemical engineering. He assembled a multidisciplinary team of [[engineer]]s, [[microbiologist]]s and [[chemist]]s to study the processes and effects of microbial growth at interfaces&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=InProcess |title=Center for Interfacial Microbial Process Engineering Newsletter |date=Fall 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; He established a cross-disciplinary environmental biotechnology institute to address the needs of industry in the areas of [[biofouling]], [[microbial corrosion]] and biofilm technology.&lt;ref name=CBE1990&gt;{{cite report |title=Report on Research 1990, Montana State University |pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute for Chemical and Biological Process Analysis (IPA) was chartered by the [[Montana University System|Montana Board of Regents]] in 1983 within the Montana State University College of Engineering. Bill Characklis was its first director. The IPA provided the foundation for eventual Engineering Research Center status in several ways. The IPA conducted fundamental research, development, and testing for industry and government agencies and it pursued biofilm projects that crossed traditional scientific discipline boundaries.&lt;ref name=news1983&gt;Brochure: "Montana State University introduces The Institute for Biological and Chemical Process Analysis." 1983&lt;/ref&gt; The IPA established an Industrial Associates membership program and by 1989 the program had 12 participating members, each contributing $10,000 annually to the center. Membership benefits provided them the opportunity to assist in critiquing and defining the IPA research programs. Members included oil/gas/power companies, a chemical manufacturer, a pulp and paper company and partnership with the [[Idaho National Engineering Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;Report: "Strategic Plan of the Institute for Biological and Chemical Process Analysis." February 1989, p 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Center for Interfacial Microbial Process Engineering (1990–1993)===
[[File:Confocal Microscopes Center for Biofilm Research MSU.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=photograph of microscope|Leica [[Confocal laser scanning microscopy|confocal microscope systems]]]]
In 1989, the IPA applied to the NSF for Engineering Research Center status, which was granted in April 1990.&lt;ref name=charter/&gt; The Center for Interfacial Microbial Process Engineering was established as one of three national Engineering Research Centers out of 48 applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Strategic Plan of the Institute for Biological and Chemical Process Analysis |date=February 1989 |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an ERC, the new organization was charged with building a cross-disciplinary research and education program at Montana State University, as well as increasing U.S. industrial competitiveness in biofilm related technologies. The center's charter mandated that research, education, and technology transfer programs would be fully integrated within the center's program planning. The Industrial Associates program continued to be used as a mechanism for the center to get information from industry about significant biofilm-related problems and collaborate on center research initiatives designed to address biofilm issues. The center’s education program recruited students to participate on interdisciplinary research teams and to interact with industry representatives.&lt;ref name=CBE1990/&gt;

The provision of $7.2 million in grants from the NSF during the first five years enabled the expansion of center research into new areas, notably [[bioremediation]] and [[biohydrometallurgy]]. The center's industrial focus expanded from biofilm control and mitigation to include positive use of biofilm processes to break up soil and water contaminants as well as extracting minerals from low-grade ores.&lt;ref name=CBE1990/&gt; Center projects were designed to span scales of inquiry from fundamental bench-scale to applied field-scale experiments. These projects enabled the continued development of microsensors to measure gradients of gases and pH within biofilm communities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lewandowski Z, Lee W, Characklis WG, Little BJ | year = 1989 | title = Dissolved oxygen and pH microelectrode measurements at water-immersed metal surfaces | url = | journal = Corrosion Science | volume = 45 | issue = 2| pages = 92–98 | doi=10.5006/1.3577838}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[microscopy]] to elucidate physiological activity of community organisms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Wentland, Eric J.; Stewart, Philip S.; Huang, Ching-Tsan; McFeters, Gordon A. |title=Spatial variations in growth rate within Klebsiella pneumoniae colonies and biofilm |journal=Biotechnology Progress |date=1996 |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=316–321 |accessdate=2015-03-06 |publisher=American Institute of Chemical Engineers |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1021/bp9600243/abstract |doi=10.1021/bp9600243}}&lt;/ref&gt; and modeling to predict biofilm behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bit.260411005/abstract |authors=Jones, Warren L.; Dockery, Jack D.; Vogel, Curtis R.; Sturman, Paul J. |title=Diffusion and reaction within porous packing media: A phenomenological model |journal=Biotechnology and Bioengineering |date= April 25, 1993 |volume=41 |issue=10 |pages=947–956 |accessdate=2015-03-06 |publisher=Wiley Periodicals, Inc. |doi=10.1002/bit.260411005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Center for Biofilm Engineering (1993–present)===
In 1992, two years after its establishment, the center's first director, Bill Characklis, died. Montana State University signaled its commitment to the center by hiring J.W. (Bill) Costerton, a professor of microbiology from the [[University of Calgary]], as Executive Director and James Bryers, a professor of biochemical engineering from [[Duke University]], as Director of Research for the center. In 1993 the center’s name was changed to Center for Biofilm Engineering (CBE).&lt;ref&gt;Center for Biofilm Engineering News, 1993 April;1(1):1-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Costerton's direction the center continued to fulfill its charter and began expanding its scope of inquiry. Costerton encouraged exploration of the [[bioelectric]] effect,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Costerton J.William; Ellis, Brian; Lam, Kan; Johnson, Frank; Khoury, Antoine E. |title=Mechanism of the electrical enhancement of the efficacy of antibiotics in killing biofilm bacteria |journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy |date=December 1994 |volume=38 |issue=12 |pages=2803–2809 |publisher=American Society for Microbiology |url=http://aac.asm.org/content/38/12/2803.full.pdf+html |accessdate=2015-02-28 |doi=10.1128/aac.38.12.2803|pmc=188289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the phenomenon of cell-cell signaling and its relation to biofilm structure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Davies, D.G.; Geesey, G.G.|title=Regulation of the alginate biosynthesis gene algC in Pseudomonas aeruginosa during biofilm development in continuous culture |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC167351/pdf/610860.pdf |format=pdf |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |date=March 1995 |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=860–7 |accessdate=2015-03-02 |publisher=American Society for Microbiology |pmc=167351 |pmid=7793920}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsurface biobarrier technologies to protect water and soils from mining contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=James, Garth A., Warwood, Bryan K.; Cunningham Alfred B.; Sturman, Paul J.; Hiebert, Randall; Costerton J.W. |url=http://www.engg.ksu.edu/HSRC/95Proceed/james.pdf |format=pdf |date=May 24, 1995 |title=Evaluation of subsurface biobarrier formation and persistence |journal=Proceedings of the 10th Annual Conference on Hazardous Waste Research, Manhattan, KS. |pages=82–91 |accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial interest and membership grew in response to more diversified research topics. By 1996 Industrial Associate membership had grown to 19 diversified members including members representing water treatment, mining, government labs, specialty chemicals, consumer products, and oil/energy companies.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Biofilm Engineering Year Seven Report and Renewal Proposal, February 1997; Table 9.3.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1996 the National Science Foundation renewed its commitment to the Center for Biofilm Engineering with a new five year grant of $7.6 million.&lt;ref name=Invade&gt;{{cite journal |title=Biofilms Invade Microbiology-Linking Microbiology and Engineering |author=Potera, Carol |journal=Science |date=September 27, 1996 |volume=273 |issue=5283 |pages=1795–1796 |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |doi=10.1126/science.273.5283.1795 |jstor=2891076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 the national profile of the CBE and biofilm research was on the rise. Numerous scientific and mass media publications began to address biofilm technology in ernest. An article in the September 1996 issue of ''Science'', entitled "Biofilms Invade Microbiology" featured the work and history of the Center for Biofilm Engineering.&lt;ref name=Invade/&gt; Other magazines and newspapers featuring biofilms and CBE research included ''[[New Scientist]]'' (cover article, August 31, 1996),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Coghlan, Andy |title=Slime City |journal=New Scientist |date=August 31, 1996 |number=2045 |pages=32–36 |issn=0262-4079 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15120454.500-slime-city.html |accessdate=2015-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Science News]]'' (April 26, 1997),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Material Gives Bacterial Films the Heave-Ho |journal=Science News |date=April 26, 1997 |author=Wu, Corinna |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Material+gives+bacterial+films+the+heave-ho.-a019377784 |accessdate=2015-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' (May 17, 1998),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The tooth of the matter: Dental infections implicated in other illnesses. |journal=Chicago Sun-Times. |date=May 17, 1998 |author=Sternberg, Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Science'' (March 19, 1999),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Forging a link between biofilms and disease |journal=Science |volume=283 |issue=5409 |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|pages=1837–1839 |date=March 19, 1999 |author=Potera, Carol |jstor=2896613 |doi=10.1126/science.283.5409.1837}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Businessweek]]'' (September 12, 1999),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Getting a grip on bacterial slime |journal=Businessweek |date=September 12, 1999 |author=Licking, Ellen |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/1999-09-12/getting-a-grip-on-bacterial-slime |accessdate=2015-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Knight Ridder|Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service]]'' (January 7, 2000),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=’Slimy, horrible biofilms’ pervade everyday life |journal=Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service |date=January 7, 2000 |author=Boyd, Robert S. |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-58947124.html |accessdate=2015-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nature'' (November 16, 2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Slime Busters, number 408 |date=November 16, 2000 |journal=Nature |pages=284–286 |author=Chicurel, Marina |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v408/n6810/full/408284a0.html |accessdate=2015-03-01 |volume=408 |issue=6810 |doi=10.1038/35042737}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' (May 28, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Culprit in ear infections is a ‘biofilm’ that protects bacteria |journal=The Boston Globe |date=May 28, 2002 |author=Delude, Cathryn Delude |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-7722547.html |accessdate=2015-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 Costerton and CBE Deputy Director Philip S.

===Self-sufficiency (2001–)===
The NSF ERC program was designed to create institutional centers that would be self-sufficient within ten years. The Center for Biofilm Engineering at Montana State University started planning for self-sufficiency in 1998 through the establishment of a Self-sufficiency Task Force at the university.

====Undergraduate studies====
The Center for Biofilm Engineering's Undergraduate Research Experience (URE) was founded by Director J.W. (Bill) Costerton and Ryan Jordan in the late 1990s. PhD candidate (and subsequent Senior Research Engineer at the CBE)  Jordan directed the CBE's first URE students as part of a backcountry water quality program in Yellowstone National Park and the Bridger-Teton Wilderness where URE students under Jordan's direction became the first researchers to identify the role of biofilm in the failure of portable water treatment filters used in disaster relief, military, and outdoor recreation applications.

Undergraduate students are hired as undergraduate research assistants and work in CBE laboratories as members of research teams on interdisciplinary biofilm projects. CBE undergraduates are encouraged to acquire competence in laboratory skills, experimental design and group communication. By 2017, over 785 undergraduates from 11 disciplines had worked on laboratory biofilm projects under the direction of CBE-affiliated faculty members. Twenty-nine of 62 undergraduates (46%) in the 2016-17 academic year were female.&lt;ref name="2014AR"&gt;{{cite report |title=MSU Center for Biofilm Engineering 25 years and growing |date=2014 |pages=1–24 |url=http://www.biofilm.montana.edu/files/CBE/documents/2014_and_25-YrReport_CBE.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2014ARappx" /&gt;

Graduate students pursue their degree in a discipline offered through one of the science, agriculture, or engineering departments at Montana State University while they conduct their research in CBE laboratories. Student graduate committees are typically interdisciplinary. The student and graduate committee members select coursework appropriate for the student’s interests and degree program. Engineering students are encouraged to take microbiology courses; science students are encouraged to take relevant engineering coursework. Graduate students acquire experience by designing and performing research that crosses traditional academic discipline boundaries and has direct impact on current environmental, industrial, and medical issues. Students work on projects that range from fundamental to applied topics. In addition, the CBE’s Industrial Associates program brings students into working relationships with potential employers. Graduate students are encouraged to develop their communication and leadership skills by presenting at research conferences, mentoring undergraduate students, organizing the CBE’s seminar series, and assisting with outreach efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CBE Graduate Education |url=http://www.biofilm.montana.edu/node/2184 |publisher=Montana State University |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2017, 256 graduate students had received advanced degrees, including 30 with doctorate degrees and 22 with masters degrees . During the 2016-17 academic year 53% graduate students were female.&lt;ref name=2014AR/&gt;&lt;ref name=2014ARappx/&gt;

&lt;!--==Proposed DYK==
… that the '''[[Center for Biofilm Engineering]]''' at [[Montana State University|MSU]] uses interdisciplinary research &amp; education to tackle biofilm issues including [[chronic wounds]], [[bioremediation]], and [[microbial corrosion]]?--&gt;

&lt;!--Text of source for DYK Hook:

Biofiims were once considered chiefly a practical problem, the province of industrial engineers concerned about corroded pipes and fouled equipment. So in the 1980s, when William Characklis spoke about biofilms at microbiology conferences, the biologists he addressed were not a receptive audience: He was considered a "microbiologist who had fallen amongst engineers," recalls biofilm expert William Costerton. In reality, Characklis, who died an untimely death in 1992 at age 50, was a chemical engineering professor at Montana State University in Bozeman. But he had become convinced that a more biological perspective was needed to understand the puzzling nature of biofilms. Costerton and other biofilm leaders credit Characklis for almost single-handedly bridging biology and engineering, tirelessly crisscrossing the boundary between the two camps by training himself in microbiology, attending meetings, and teaching diverse graduate students. In 1990 Characklis won National Science Foundation (NSF) support to start an Engineering Research Center on biofilms at Montana State. Under his leadership, the center, then called the Center for Microbial Interfacial Process Engineering, drew students and faculty from engineering, science, mathematics, and agricultural departments. After Characklis's death, the center's name changed to the Center for Biofilm Engineering (CBE), but his interdisciplinary vision is thriving under the leadership of microbiologist Costerton. The center's original 5-year NSF grant was renewed in June, for $7.6 million for the next 5 years. One of the center's crucial jobs is to develop tools to study biofilms. For example, early researchers thought that the bacteria grew uniformly in a polysaccharide envelope, a view that stemmed from drying or treating biofilms before studying them. Then in 1991, researchers at the CBE and the University of Saskatchewan in Canada used confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) to examine successive planes in living biofilms in real time. CSLM 
clearly showed that biofilm bacteria grow as remarkably complex microcolonies, crisscrossed by water channels that comprise up to 60% of the biofilm's volume. CBE scientists, led by Zbigniew Lewandow- ski, are now further refining this method with new probes and software for mapping interactions among bacteria. Today the CBE is a haven of interdisciplinary work, with graduate students from 10 departments working in interdisciplinary teams. Engineering students clone genes, microbiologists construct mathematical models, and mathematicians letnm biochemistrv. all to solve real-world problems. "The center has evolved a system that works," says Costerton, who thinks the key to success is the interdisciplinary research teams. A microbiologist may help an engineer do taxonomic mapping of a mixed-species biofilm, then the engineer might help the microbiologist scan the surface of a medical device with a scanning vibrating electrode to measure the extent of biofilm- induced corrosion. Another part of the CBE's mission is to advance industrial competitiveness, by transferring technology to industrial associates such as oil companies or municipal water districts. Microbiologist Rod Donlan of Calgon Corp. in Pittsburgh, for example, has used the center's expertise to find chemical disinfectants that can kill biofilms in industrial water systems. He adopted a CBE- developed staining technique to identify the kinds of bacteria and their metabolic activity inside a biofilm, and this helps him deter- mine which bacteria are harmed by disinfectants. "That's why we're part of the center-because they do basic research that helps us develop new applications," he says. And it's clear that Characklis's cross-disciplinary spirit lives on. During a recent NSF site review, an eminent microbiologist was convinced that two students presenting a project about biofilms degrading trichloroethylene were microbiologists. "They were, in fact, both engineers," says Costerton. -CP--&gt;

==Hatchery production techniques==
A range of microalgae species are produced in hatcheries and are used in a variety of ways for commercial purposes. Studies have estimated main factors in the success of a microalgae hatchery system as the dimensions of the container/bioreactor where microalgae is cultured, exposure to light/[[irradiation]]  and concentration of cells within the reactor.&lt;ref name=" Tredici &amp; Materassi 1992"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M. Tredici |author2=R. Materassi |year=1992 |title=From open ponds to vertical alveolar panels: the Italian experience in the development of reactors for the mass cultivation of phototrophic microorganisms |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/h3440817l4628j56/ |journal=Journal of Applied Phycology |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=221–231 |doi=10.1007/BF02161208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open pond system===
This method has been employed since the 1950s. There are two main advantages of culturing microalgae using the [[Raceway pond|open pond]] system.&lt;ref name="Richmond 1986"&gt;{{cite book |author=Amos Richmond |year=1986 |title=Handbook of Microalgal Mass Culture |location=Florida |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=0-8493-3240-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, an open pond system is easier to build and operate.&lt;ref name="Richmond 1986"/&gt; Secondly, open ponds are cheaper than closed bioreactors because closed [[bioreactors]] require a cooling system.&lt;ref name="Richmond 1986"/&gt; However, a downside to using open pond systems is decreased productivity of certain commercially important strains such as ''Arthrospira sp.'', where optimal growth is limited by temperature.&lt;ref name=" Tredici &amp; Materassi 1992"/&gt;

===Air-lift method===
This method is used in outdoor cultivation and production of microalgae; where air is moved within a system in order to circulate water where microalgae is growing.&lt;ref name="Richmond 1986"/&gt; The culture is grown in transparent tubes that lie horizontally on the ground and are connected by a network of pipes.&lt;ref name="Richmond 1986"/&gt; Air is passed through the tube such that air escapes from the end that rests inside the reactor that contains the culture and creates an effect like stirring.&lt;ref name="Richmond 1986"/&gt;

===Closed reactors===
The biggest advantage of culturing microalgae within a closed system provides control over the physical, chemical and biological environment of the culture.&lt;ref name=" Tredici &amp; Materassi 1992"/&gt; This means factors that are difficult to control in open pond systems such as evaporation, temperature [[gradients]] and protection from ambient contamination make closed reactors favoured over open systems.&lt;ref name=" Tredici &amp; Materassi 1992"/&gt; Photobioreactors are the primary example of a closed system where abiotic factors can be controlled for. Several closed systems have been tested to date for the purposes of culturing microalgae, few important ones are mentioned below:

====Horizontal photobioreactors====
This system includes tubes laid on the ground to form a network of loops. Mixing of microalgal suspended culture occurs through a pump that raises the culture vertically at timed intervals into a [[photobioreactor]]. Studies have found pulsed mixing at intervals produces better results than the use of continuous mixing. Photobioreactors have also been associated with better production than open pond systems as they can maintain better temperature gradients.&lt;ref name=" Tredici &amp; Materassi 1992"/&gt; An example noted in higher production of ''Arthrospira sp.'' used as a dietary supplement was attributed to higher productivity because of a better suited temperature range and an extended cultivation period over summer months.&lt;ref name=" Tredici &amp; Materassi 1992"/&gt;

====Vertical systems====
These reactors use vertical [[polyethylene]] sleeves hung from an iron frame. Glass tubes can also be used alternatively.
Microalgae are also cultured in vertical alveolar panels (VAP) that are a type of [[photobioreactor]].&lt;ref name=" Tredici &amp; Materassi 1992"/&gt; This photobioreactor is characterised by low productivity. However, this problem can be overcome by modifying the [[surface area]] to [[volume]] ratio; where a higher ratio can increase productivity.&lt;ref name=" Tredici &amp; Materassi 1992"/&gt; Mixing and [[deoxygenation]] are drawbacks of this system and can be addressed by bubbling air continuously at a mean flow rate. The two main types of vertical photobioreactors are the Flow-through VAP and the Bubble Column VAP.&lt;ref name=" Tredici &amp; Materassi 1992"/&gt;

===Flat plate reactors===
Flat plate reactors(FPR) are built using narrow panels and are placed horizontally to maximise sunlight input to the system.&lt;ref name="Carvalho"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ana P. Carvalho |author2=Luís A. Meireles |author3=F. Xavier Malcata |year=2006 |title=Microalgal reactors: a review of enclosed system designs and performances |journal=Biotechnology Progress |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1021/bp060065r/full |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=1490–1506 |pmid=17137294 |doi=10.1021/bp060065r}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept behind FPR is to increase the surface area to volume ratio such that sunlight is efficiently used.&lt;ref name="Richmond 1986"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carvalho"/&gt; This system of microalgae culture was originally thought to be expensive and incapable of circulating the culture.&lt;ref name="Carvalho"/&gt; Therefore, FPRs were considered to be unfeasible overall for the commercial production of microalgae. However, an experimental FPR system in the 1980s used [[circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]] within the culture from a gas exchange unit across horizontal panels.&lt;ref name="Carvalho"/&gt; This overcomes issues of circulation and provides an advantage of an open gas transfer unit that reduces oxygen build up.&lt;ref name="Carvalho"/&gt; Examples of successful use of FPRs can be seen in the production of ''Nannochloropsis sp.'' used for its high levels of [[astaxanthin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Amos Richmond |author2=Zhang Cheng-Wu |year=2001 |title=Optimization of a flat plate glass reactor for mass production of ''Nannochloropsis'' sp. outdoors |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168165600003539 |journal=Journal of Biotechnology |volume=85 |issue=3 |pages=259–269 |pmid=11173093 |doi=10.1016/S0168-1656(00)00353-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fermentor-type reactors===
Fermentor-type reactors (FTR) are bioreactors where [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] is carried out. FTRs have not developed hugely in the cultivation of microalgae and pose a disadvantage in the surface area to volume ratio and a decreased efficiency in utilizing sunlight.&lt;ref name="Richmond 1986"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carvalho"/&gt; FTR have been developed using a combination of sun and artificial light have led to lowering production costs.&lt;ref name="Carvalho"/&gt; However, information available on large scale counterparts to the laboratory-scale systems being developed is very limited.&lt;ref name="Carvalho"/&gt; The main advantage is that extrinsic factors i.e. light can be controlled for and productivity can be enhanced so that FTR can become an alternative for products for the [[pharmaceutical]] industry.&lt;ref name="Carvalho"/&gt;

==Commercial applications==

===Aquaculture===
[[File:Brine shrimp cyst.jpg|frame|Microalgae is used to culture [[brine shrimp]], which produce dormant eggs (pictured). The eggs can then be hatched on demand and feed to cultured fish larvae and crustaceans.]]

Microalgae is an important source of nutrition and is used widely in the [[aquaculture]] of other organisms, either directly or as an added source of basic nutrients.&lt;ref name=" Muller-Feuga, 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Arnaud Muller-Feuga |year=2000 |title=The role of microalgae in aquaculture: situation and trends |journal=Journal of Applied Phycology |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=527–534 |doi=10.1023/A:1008106304417 |url=http://archimer.ifremer.fr/doc/2000/publication-497.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquaculture farms rearing larvae of [[Mollusca|molluscs]], [[echinoderm]]s, [[crustacean]]s and [[fish]] use microalgae as a source of nutrition.&lt;ref name=" Muller-Feuga, 2000"/&gt; Low bacteria and high microalgal biomass is a crucial food source for shellfish aquaculture.&lt;ref name=" Muller-Feuga, 2000"/&gt;

Microalgae can form the start of a chain of further aquaculture processes. For example, microalgae is an important food source in the [[aquaculture of brine shrimp]]. Brine shrimp produce dormant eggs, called [[cyst]]s, which can be stored for long periods and then hatched on demand to provide a convenient form of live feed for the aquaculture of [[fish larva|larval fish]] and crustaceans.&lt;ref name=R3&gt;{{cite book |author=Martin Daintith |year=1996 |title=Rotifers and ''Artemia'' for Marine Aquaculture: a Training Guide |oclc=222006176 |publisher=[[University of Tasmania]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zmora"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Odi Zmora |author2=Muki Shpigel |year=2006 |title=Intensive mass production of ''Artemia'' in a recirculated system |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0044848606000342 |journal=[[Aquaculture (journal)|Aquaculture]] |volume=255 |issue=1–4 |pages=488–494 |doi=10.1016/j.aquaculture.2006.01.018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other applications of microalgae within aquaculture include increasing the [[aesthetic]] appeal of finfish bred in captivity.&lt;ref name=" Muller-Feuga, 2000"/&gt; One such example can be noted in the [[aquaculture of salmon]], where microalgae is used to make salmon flesh pinker.&lt;ref name=" Muller-Feuga, 2000"/&gt; This is achieved by the addition of natural pigments containing [[carotenoids]] such as [[astaxanthin]] produced from the microalgae ''Haematococcus'' to the diet of farmed animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=R. Todd Lorenz |author2=Gerald R. Cysewski |year=2000 |title=Commercial potential for ''Haematococcus'' microalgae as a natural source of astaxanthin |journal=[[Trends in Biotechnology]] |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=160–167 |pmid=10740262 |doi=10.1016/S0167-7799(00)01433-5 |url=http://www.ruscom.com/cyan/web02/pdfs/naturose/nrtl02.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biofuel production===
In order to meet the demands of [[fossil fuels]], alternate means of fuels are being investigated. [[Biodiesel]] and [[bioethanol]] are renewable fuels with much potential that are important in current research. However, [[agriculture]] based [[renewable fuels]] may not be completely sustainable and thus may not be able to replace fossil fuels.&lt;ref name="Chisti 2008"/&gt; Microalgae can be remarkably rich in oils (up to 80% dry weight of [[biomass]]) suitable for conversion to fuel.&lt;ref name="Chisti 2008"/&gt; Furthermore, microalgae are more productive than land based agricultural crops and could therefore be more sustainable in the long run.&lt;ref name="Chisti 2008"/&gt; Microalgae for [[biofuel]] production is mainly produced using tubular [[photobioreactors]].&lt;ref name="Chisti 2008"/&gt;

===Cosmetic and health benefits===
The main species of microalgae grown as health foods are ''Chlorella sp.'' and ''Spirulina sp.'' The main forms of production occur in small scale ponds with artificial mixers.&lt;ref name="Borowitzka_1999"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Michael A.

===Biofertilizer===
Blue green alga was first used as a means of fixing nitrogen by allowing cyanobacteria to multiply in the soil. [[Nitrogen fixation]] is important as a means of allowing [[inorganic compounds]] such as [[nitrogen]] to be converted to [[organic compounds|organic]] forms which can then be used by plants.&lt;ref name="Saadatnia and Riahi 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=H.

===Other uses===
Microalgae are a source of valuable molecules such as [[isotopes]] i.e. chemical variants of an element that contain different neutrons. Microalgae can effectively incorporate isotopes of [[carbon]] (&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C), [[nitrogen]] (&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N) and [[hydrogen]] (&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H) into their biomass.&lt;ref name="Radmer"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Richard Radmer |author2=Bruce Parker |year=1994 |title=Commercial applications of algae: opportunities and constraints |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/l7n41517525128q0/ |journal=Journal of Applied Phycology |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=93–98 |doi=10.1007/BF02186062}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N are used to track the flow of carbon between different trophic levels/food webs.&lt;ref name=" Peterson 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |author=B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3034">[[Real-time computing]] of [[Curing (chemistry)|cure]] monitoring is an essential component for the control of the manufacturing process of [[composite materials]]. The rationale for cure monitoring relies on the various physical or chemical properties that can be used to follow the transformation of an initially liquid [[thermoset]] [[resin]] into its final rigid solid form ([[Curing (chemistry)|curing]]). The relationship between the monitoring output and the requirements for feedback-loop control is the subject of extended research activities including considerations of the modelling of the cure reaction.

== Techniques ==
*Dielectrometry: The technique of conventional dielectrometry carried out typically in a parallel plate configuration of the [[dielectric]] [[sensor]] ([[Capacitance probe]]), has the capability of monitoring the resin cure throughout the entire cycle, from the liquid to the rubber to the solid state and remains the only technique capable of monitoring phase separation in complex resin blends curing within a fibrous perform. The same attributes belong to the more recent development of the dielectric technique, namely microdielectrometry. Several versions of dielectric sensors are available commercially. The most suitable format for use in cure monitoring applications are the flat interdigital capacitive structures bearing a sensing grid on their surface. Depending on their design (specifically those on durable substrates) they have some reusability, while flexible substrate sensors can be used also in the bulk of the resin systems as embedded sensors.
*[[Optical fiber]] cure monitoring is performed by measuring
**changes in the concentration of specific reactive resin species using [[spectroscopy]] methods (FTIR &amp; Raman)
**changes in the [[refractive index]] or [[fluorescence]] of the resin (optical property)
**changes in internal resin [[strain (materials science)|strain]] (mechanical property) with the use of [[Fiber Bragg Grating]] (FBG) sensors
*[[Ultrasound|Ultrasonic]] cure monitoring methods based on relationships between changes in the characteristics of propagating ultrasound and the real-time mechanical properties of a component by measuring:
**ultrasonic time of flight, both in through-transmission and pulse-echo modes
**natural frequency using impact excitation and [[laser]]-induced surface [[acoustic wave]] velocity measurement.
*Thermal cure monitoring methods based on the amount of [[heat]] produced during the thermoset cure reaction by measuring:
**the amount of [[heat flux]] per second through a given surface
**the change in heat capacity for small resin quantities

The '''Early January 2014 nor'easter''' was a major [[winter storm]] that affected much of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] with snow, and frigid temperatures following the storm. The storm had dumped up to {{convert|2|ft|m|abbr=on}} of snow in some areas, especially around [[Boston, Massachusetts]].

== Meteorological synopsis ==
Late on December 30, a weak [[clipper]] system moved southward from [[Canada]]. The system produced light snow in the [[Midwest]] around areas like [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] with only light accumulations.

Starting on New Year's Day, however, the clipper began to strengthen and take an eastward turn. It would produce more moderate to heavy snow around areas like [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], with accumulations of roughly 4-6 inches. The storm then continued to move eastwards towards the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], where it would continue to intensify.

Early on January 2, the system started to become more complex as a new [[low pressure]] area had formed in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] along a stationary front. Winter storm warnings began to be issued by roughly mid-day from eastern [[New England]] to as far west as [[Pennsylvania]] as the storm closed in on the Northeast. By 3:00 p.m, the northern low began to weaken as the southern one began to take over as it continued to pull moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. This was the start of the storm's transition to a [[nor'easter]].

Later that night, the low pressure began to strengthen off the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]] coast and move out to sea as it dumped snow on its northwestern side over the [[Northeastern United States]] and [[New England]]. Snow continued to fall into the early hours of January 3 even as it pulled away from the coastline.

After it had left the coast early that morning, it continued to strengthen and turn to the northeast, and late on January 4, it reached its peak intensity of {{convert|936|mbar|inHg}} while situated near [[Greenland]]. It was then absorbed into another [[extratropical cyclone]], which later developed into [[Cyclone Christina]] which brought high winds to western Europe several days later.

== Aftermath and cold wave ==
[[File:Christina 4 January 2014.jpg|thumb|[[Cyclone Christina]] (seen east of Newfoundland on January 4) later developed from the remnants of the nor'easter, bringing high winds and flooding to Western Europe.]]
{{main|Early 2014 North American cold wave}}
After the storm passed, an arctic front associated with it passed through the region, bringing record cold temperatures in the eastern half of the [[United States]].

On January 3, [[Boston]] had a temperature of {{convert|2|°F|°C}} with a {{convert|-20|°F|°C}} [[wind chill]], and over {{convert|7|in}} of snow. [[Boxford, Massachusetts]] recorded {{convert|23.8|in}}. [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]] had a record low of {{convert|-10|°F|°C}}. In [[Michigan]], over {{convert|11|in}} of snow fell outside Detroit and temperatures around the state were near or below {{convert|0|°F|°C}}. [[New Jersey]] had over {{convert|10|in}} of snow, and schools and government offices closed.&lt;ref name=BostonAP&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/weather/2014/01/03/snow-cold-temps-disrupt-life-several-states/ZyFIVTLFhvz4miIVrTs2LO/story.html |title=Snow, cold disrupt large swath of US; more to come |work=Boston Globe |agency=Associated Press |date=January 3, 2014 |accessdate=January 10, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114072632/http://www.boston.com/news/weather/2014/01/03/snow-cold-temps-disrupt-life-several-states/ZyFIVTLFhvz4miIVrTs2LO/story.html |archivedate=January 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over a dozen deaths were attributed to the cold wave, with dangerous roadway conditions and extreme cold cited as causes.&lt;ref name=FOX_DeMarche&gt;{{cite news|last=DeMarche|first=Edmund|title='Polar vortex' set to bring dangerous, record-breaking cold to much of US|url=http://www.foxnews.com/weather/2014/01/04/polar-vortex-to-blast-frigid-air-over-much-us/|work=FoxNews.com|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=January 6, 2014|date=January 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC_Castellano&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/11-died-winter-storm-dumped-feet-snow-northeast/story?id=21407724 |title=At Least 13 Died in Winter Storm That Dumped More Than 2 Feet of Snow Over Northeast |newspaper=ABC News |date=January 3, 2014 |last=Castellano |first=Anthony}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc-arctic-blast&gt;{{cite news |title=North America arctic blast creeps east |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-25632586 |work=BBC News |accessdate=January 7, 2014 |date=January 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An electrothermal-chemical gun uses a plasma cartridge to ignite and control the ammunition's propellant, using electrical energy to trigger the process.  ETC increases the performance of conventional solid propellants, reduces the effect of temperature on propellant expansion and allows for more advanced, higher density propellants to be used.

The technology has been under development since the mid-1980s and at present is actively being researched in the United States by the [[Army Research Laboratory]], [[Sandia National Laboratories]] and defense industry contractors, including [[FMC Corporation]], [[General Dynamics Land Systems]], [[Olin Corporation|Olin Ordnance]], and [[Soreq Nuclear Research Center]].&lt;ref&gt;Taulbee, Steve (1993). [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.c2979777;view=1up;seq=7 ARL Ballistics Research], U.S. Army Research Laboratory, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is possible that electrothermal-chemical gun propulsion will be an integral part of US Army's future combat system and those of other countries such as [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]].  
Electrothermal-chemical technology is part of a broad research and development program that encompasses all electric gun technology, such as [[railgun]]s and [[coil gun]]s.

== Background ==
[[Image:XM360.png|right|thumb|305px|The XM360.]]

The constant battle between [[vehicle armour|armour]] and armor-piercing round has led to continuous development of the main battle tank design. The evolution of American anti-tank weapons can be traced back to requirements to combat [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] tanks.  In the late 1980s, it was thought that the protection level of the Future Soviet Tank (FST) could exceed 700&amp;nbsp;mm of rolled homogeneous armour equivalence at its maximum thickness, which was effectively immune against the contemporary [[M829|M-829]] [[kinetic energy penetrator|armour piercing fin stabilized discarding sabot]].&lt;ref&gt;Ropelewski, ''Soviet Gains in Armor/Antiarmor Shape US Army Master Plan'', p.69&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1980s the most immediate method available to NATO to counter Soviet advances in armour technology was the adoption of a 140&amp;nbsp;mm main gun, but this required a redesigned turret that could incorporate the larger breech and ammunition, and it also required some sort of automatic loader.&lt;ref&gt;Schemmer, ''Army, SecDef's Office at Loggerheads over Antiarmor'', p.53&lt;/ref&gt; Although the 140&amp;nbsp;mm gun was considered a real interim solution it was decided after the fall of the Soviet Union that the increase in muzzle energy it provided was not worth the increase in weight. Resources were therefore spent on research into other programs that could provide the needed muzzle energy. One of the most successful alternative technologies remains electrothermal-chemical ignition.

Most proposed advances in gun technology are based on the assumption that the solid propellant as a stand-alone propulsion system is no longer capable of delivering the required muzzle energy.  This requirement has been underscored by the appearance of the Russian [[T-90]] main battle tank.  Even the elongation of current gun tubes, such as the new German 120&amp;nbsp;mm L/55,&lt;ref&gt;The length of the cannon can be found by multiplying the diameter of the barrel and the caliber length.  For example, the M256, which is a 120 mm L/44, has a total length of 5.28 m, while the 120 mm L/55 has a total length of 6.6 m.&lt;/ref&gt; which was introduced by Rheinmetall is considered only an interim solution as it does not offer the required increase in muzzle velocity.&lt;ref&gt;Sharoni, ''The Future Combat System'', p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;  Even advanced kinetic energy ammunition such as the United States' [[M-829A3]] is considered only an interim solution against future threats.&lt;ref&gt;Pengelley, ''The new era in tank main armament'', p.1522&lt;/ref&gt; To that extent the solid propellant is considered to have reached the end of its usefulness, although it will remain the principal propulsion method for at least the next decade{{clarify|date=July 2015}} until newer technologies mature.&lt;ref&gt;Sharoni, ''The Future Combat System'', p.30&lt;/ref&gt;  To improve on the capabilities of a solid propellant weapon the electrothermal-chemical gun may see production as early as 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Kruse, ''Studies on Germany's Future 140 mm Tank Gun System'', p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

ETC technology offers a medium-risk upgrade and is developed to the point that further improvements are so minor that it can be considered mature.{{cn|date=July 2015}}  The lightweight American 120&amp;nbsp;mm XM-291 came close to achieving 17 MJ of muzzle energy, which is the lower-end muzzle energy spectrum for a 140&amp;nbsp;mm gun.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, ''Electro Thermal Chemical Gun Technology Study'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the success of the XM-291 does not imply the success of ETC technology as there are key parts of the propulsion system that are not yet understood or fully developed, such as the plasma ignition process.  Nevertheless, there is substantial existing evidence that ETC technology is viable and worth the money to continue development.  Furthermore, it can be integrated into current gun systems.&lt;ref&gt;Sauerwein, ''Rheinmetall's NPzK''&lt;/ref&gt;

== How it works ==
[[Image:ETC.png|right|thumb|305px|A diagram of a working electrothermal-chemical gun.]]

An electrothermal-chemical gun uses a plasma cartridge to ignite and control the ammunition's propellant, using electrical energy as a catalyst to begin the process.  Originally researched by Dr. Jon Parmentola for the U.S. Army, it has grown into a very plausible successor to a standard solid propellant tank gun.  Since the beginning of research the United States has funded the XM-291 gun project with USD 4,000,000, basic research with USD 300,000, and applied research with USD 600,000.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}  Since then it has been proven to work, although efficiency to the level required has not yet been accomplished.  ETC increases the performance of conventional solid propellants, reduces the effect of temperature on propellant expansion and allows for more advanced, higher density propellants to be used.  It will also reduce pressure placed on the barrel in comparison to alternative technologies that offer the same muzzle energy given the fact that it helps spread the propellant's gas much more smoothly during ignition.&lt;ref&gt;Hilmes, ''Aspects of future MBT conception''&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, there are two principal methods of plasma initiation: the flashboard large area emitter (FLARE) and the triple coaxial plasma igniter (TCPI).

=== Flashboard large area emitter ===
Flashboards run in several parallel strings to provide a large area of plasma or ultraviolet radiation and uses the breakdown and vaporization of gaps of diamonds to produce the required plasma.  These parallel strings are mounted in tubes and oriented to have their gaps azimuthal to the tube's axis. It discharges by using high pressure air to move air out of the way.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, ''Electro Thermal Chemical Gun Technology Study'', p.11-12&lt;/ref&gt;  FLARE initiators can ignite propellants through the release of plasma, or even through the use of ultraviolet heat radiation.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, ''Electro Thermal Chemical Gun Technology Study'', p.13-15&lt;/ref&gt;   The absorption length of a solid propellant is sufficient to be ignited by radiation from a plasma source.  However, FLARE has most likely not reached optimal design requirements and further understanding of FLARE and how it works is completely necessary to ensure the evolution of the technology.  If FLARE provided the XM-291 gun project with the sufficient radiative heat to ignite the propellant to achieve a muzzle energy of 17 MJ one could only imagine the possibilities with a fully developed FLARE plasma igniter.  Current areas of study include how plasma will affect the propellant through radiation, the deliverance of mechanical energy and heat directly and by driving gas flow.  Despite these daunting tasks FLARE has been seen as the most plausible igniter for future application on ETC guns.&lt;ref&gt;For further technical information on FLARE ''see:'' P. Diamond&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Triple coaxial plasma igniter ===
A coaxial igniter consists of a fully insulated conductor, covered by four strips of aluminum foil.  All of this is further insulated in a tube about 1.6&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter that is perforated with small holes.  The idea is to use an electrical flow through the conductor and then exploding the flow into vapor and then breaking it down into plasma.  Consequently, the plasma escapes through the constant perforations throughout the insulating tube and initiates the surrounding propellant.  A TCPI igniter is fitted in individual propellant cases for each piece of ammunition.  However, TCPI is no longer considered a viable method of propellant ignition because it may damage the fins and does not deliver energy as efficiently as a FLARE igniter.&lt;ref&gt;TCPI is also covered in ''Electro Thermal Chemical Gun Technology Study'' by P. Diamond&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feasibility ==
[[Image:60mmETC.PNG|right|thumb|305px|The 60 mm ETC gun developed by the US Navy at FMC as an ETC CIWS proof of principle demonstrator.]]

The XM-291 is the best existing example of a working electrothermal-chemical gun.  It was an alternate technology to the heavier caliber 140&amp;nbsp;mm gun by using the dual-caliber approach.  It uses a breech that is large enough to accept 140&amp;nbsp;mm ammunition and be mounted with both a 120&amp;nbsp;mm barrel and a 135&amp;nbsp;mm or 140&amp;nbsp;mm barrel.  The XM-291 also mounts a larger gun tube and a larger ignition chamber than the existing M256 L/44 main gun.&lt;ref&gt;Pengelley, ''A new era in tank main armament'', p. 1522&lt;/ref&gt;  Through the application of electrothermal-chemical technology the XM-291 has been able to achieve muzzle energy outputs that equate that to a low-level 140&amp;nbsp;mm gun, while achieving muzzle velocities greater than those of the larger 140&amp;nbsp;mm gun.&lt;ref&gt;Sharoni, ''The Future Combat System'', p.31&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the XM-291 does not mean that ETC technology is viable it does offer an example that it is possible.

ETC is also a more viable option than other alternatives by definition. ETC requires much less energy input from outside sources, like a battery, than a [[railgun]] or a [[coilgun]] would.  Tests have shown that energy output by the propellant is higher than energy input from outside sources on ETC guns.&lt;ref&gt;P. Diamond, ''Electro Thermal Chemical Gun Technology Study''&lt;/ref&gt;  In comparison, a railgun currently cannot achieve a higher muzzle velocity than the amount of energy input.  Even at 50% efficiency a rail gun launching a projectile with a kinetic energy of 20 MJ would require an energy input into the rails of 40 MJ, and 50% efficiency has not yet been achieved.&lt;ref&gt;Horst, ''Recent Advances in Anti-Armor Technology'', p.6&lt;/ref&gt;  To put this into perspective, a rail gun launching at 9 MJ of energy would need roughly 32 MJ worth of energy from capacitors.  Current advances in energy storage allow for energy densities as high as 2.5 MJ/dm³, which means that a battery delivering 32 MJ of energy would require a volume of 12.8 dm³ per shot; this is not a viable volume for use in a modern main battle tank, especially one designed to be lighter than existing models.&lt;ref&gt;Zahn, ''The Future Combat System: Minimizing Risk While Maximizing Capability'', p.20&lt;/ref&gt;  There has even been discussion about eliminating the necessity for an outside electrical source in ETC ignition by initiating the plasma cartridge through a small explosive force.&lt;ref&gt;Yangmeng, ''A Novel Concept of Electrothermal Chemical Gun without Power Supply'', p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, ETC technology is not only applicable to solid propellants.  To increase muzzle velocity even further electrothermal-chemical ignition can work with liquid propellants, although this would require further research into plasma ignition.  ETC technology is also compatible with existing projects to reduce the amount of recoil delivered to the vehicle while firing.  Understandably, recoil of a gun firing a projectile at 17 MJ or more will increase directly with the increase in muzzle energy in accordance to [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's third law of motion]] and successful implementation of recoil reduction mechanisms will be vital to the installation of an ETC powered gun in an existing vehicle design.  For example, [[OTO Melara]]'s new lightweight 120&amp;nbsp;mm L/45 gun has achieved a recoil force of 25 t by using a longer recoil mechanism (550&amp;nbsp;mm) and a pepperpot muzzle brake.&lt;ref&gt;Hilmes, ''Arming Future MBTs'', p.79&lt;/ref&gt;  Reduction in recoil can also be achieved through mass attenuation of the thermal sleeve.  The ability of ETC technology to be applied to existing gun designs means that for future gun upgrades there's no longer the necessity to redesign the turret to include a larger breech or caliber gun barrel.

Several countries have already determined that ETC technology is viable for the future and have funded indigenous projects considerably.  These include the United States, Germany&lt;ref&gt;Hilmes, ''Modern German Tank Development'', p.20-21.&lt;/ref&gt; and the United Kingdom, amongst others.  The United States' XM360, which is planned to equip the [[Future Combat Systems]] [[Mounted Combat System]] light tank and may be the [[M1 Abrams]]' next gun upgrade, is reportedly based on the XM291 and may include ETC technology, or portions of ETC technology. Tests of this gun have been performed using "precision ignition" technology, which may refer to ETC ignition.

'''Excon Worldwide, Inc.''' is a Canadian energy, commodities, equities, and services company based in [[Toronto]] with other offices worldwide. Its main location is in Toronto, [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. The group comprises many specialized international offices and [[Subsidiary|subsidiaries]]. Excon Worldwide has more than seven thousand employees around North America and participates in markets around the world, including Canada, the United States, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, and the Middle East. Excon Worldwide has offices around the world including Toronto, [[Los Angeles]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[New York City]], [[Houston, Texas]] and [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.excon.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Excon Worldwide, Inc. brand is used by the commodity trading divisions. The [[mortgage]], [[insurance]], and [[real estate development]] divisions are managed under a different brand. The only subsidiaries which kept the same name after being acquired by Excon Worldwide, Inc. were Cannix Energy Corporation and Excon Online.

Excon Worldwide is one of the largest commodity trading companies in North America. Excon Worldwide employs approximately 12,500 staff.{{when|date=January 2016}}

==History==
Excon Worldwide was launched in 1987 as an energy trading and communications company. Since then, Excon has branched out into mortgages, insurance, and real estate development services. Excon opened its first American location in Los Angeles, the second location which followed was its Las Vegas executive office.

==Structure==
Excon Worldwide owns several subsidiaries which have been renamed to fit under the Excon brand name. These subsidiaries include; [[Excon Mortgages]], [[Excon Insurance Group]], and [[Excon Development Group]]. The trading operations fit under the Excon brand name as well.

===Excon Mortgages===
The company, known previously as TTL Mortgage International, was founded on October 17, 1968.

In September 1990, Excon Worldwide announced that it would buy out TTL Mortgage International and relocate its headquarters to Los Angeles. These plans were suspended in January 1991, when the company announced its Los Angeles branch was moving to its new offices at 811 Wilshire Blvd, Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="excon.com"&gt;http://www.excon.com/acquisitions.php&lt;/ref&gt;

===Excon Insurance Group===
On December 21, 1999, Excon Worldwide bought all of the insurance operations of Ross &amp; White Insurance Company. The company announced plans to complete the rebranding of Ross &amp; White branches to Excon by late 2000. Since 2001 all Ross &amp; White branches and offices have been rebranded Excon Insurance Group.

Chief executive Jacob White was flown in from Seattle to New York on the day the acquisition was completed, and eventually received a $5.5 million sign-on bonus and cash severance of $8.1 million after signing up as Excon Insurance Group's CEO.&lt;ref name="excon.com"/&gt;

===Excon Development Group===
In 2003, Excon Worldwide bought Las Vegas-based real estate development company [[Nevada Realty Developers Corporation]], bringing on current chairman Jonathan Dimon as President and COO and designating him as CEO Gregory Harrilson's successor. Dimon's pay pegged at 90% of Harrilson's. Dimon quickly made his influence felt by embarking on a cost-cutting strategy, and replaced former Excon Worldwide, Inc. executives in key positions with Nevada Realty Developers Corporation executives-many of whom were with Dimon since the beginning of his career at Nevada Realty Developers Corporation. Dimon became CEO in January 2006 and Chairman in December 2006. When Nevada Realty Developers Corporation was bought out by Excon Worldwide then CEO Gregory Harrilson was informed to change the name of the company to Excon Development Group, this allowed the real estate development giant to fit under Excon's branding web, and allowed the company to issue real estate development loans to other development companies for Excon Worldwide.&lt;ref name="excon.com"/&gt;

===Cannix Energy Corporation===
[[Cannix Energy Corporation]] is an energy and natural gas corporation based in [[Houston]], [[Texas]]. The company specializes in the energy industry by investing or developing energy power plants around the world. The company also specializes in the purchase and resale of energy treating it as a commodity. Founded in September 1971 Cannix Energy grew into one of the most profitable corporations based in Nebraska, the company employs over 500 people who specialize in the energy sector. In March 2005, Excon Worldwide acquired Cannix Energy for $602,070,000.

===Excon Online===
Excon Online is an internet company which specializes in [[internet advertising]], [[Computer programming|programming]], [[web development]], and is an [[internet service provider]]. The company was founded in late 2009 in Toronto, and was sold in 2011 to Excon Worldwide. Excon Online offers [[internet services]], [[web development]], [[Computer programming|programming]], [[internet advertising]], [[mobile advertising]], [[Search Engine Optimization]] (SEO).

==Offices==
Although the old Excon headquarters were located in [[Mississauga]], Ontario, the current world headquarters for Excon are located at a new downtown office downtown Toronto.

The bulk of North American operations take place in two office locations, one in Toronto and the other in Calgary. The sales and trading operations take place in its Montreal head office. The operations involved in energy take place in Calgary and Los Angeles. Excon's subsidiary Cannix Energy Corporation is based in [[Houston, Texas]].

The mortgage operations for Excon Worldwide are headquartered in New York City at the [[1221 Avenue of the Americas]].

The Asia Pacific headquarters for Excon Worldwide are ilocated in Hong Kong.

==Services==
Excon Worldwide, Inc. offers a variety of services; [[insurance]], [[mortgages]], [[real estate development]] [[internet services]], and [[natural gas]] services. In early 2000s Excon Worldwide, Inc. began offering [[insurance]] and [[mortgage]] services around the world. In 2005 Excon Worldwide, Inc. purchased energy giant Cannix Energy Corporation, this put Excon Worldwide, Inc. in the energy wholesale business.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.excon.com/our-services.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
Excon Worldwide is a member of the [[Business Energy Advisor Program]].

==Partnerships==
Excon Worldwide partners with [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce|CIBC]], [[BMO Capital Markets]], [[GoldStone Investments]], and [[TD Canada Trust]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.excon.com/our-partners.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''February 5–6, 2010 North American blizzard''', commonly referred to as ''[[Snowmageddon]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/os/presto/presto2010/2010feb.pdf|title=FEBRUARY 2010: Snowmageddon, Blizzard of 2010 WINTER: Unprecedented Snowfall Impacts Region|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=NOAA|access-date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a paralyzing and crippling [[blizzard]] that had major and widespread impact in the [[Northeastern United States]]. The storm's center tracked from [[Baja California Sur]] on February 2nd, 2010 to the East coast on February 6, 2010, before heading east out into the Atlantic.  Effects were felt to the north and west of this track in northern Mexico, California, and the Southwestern, Midwestern, Southeastern, and most notably [[Mid-Atlantic States]].  Severe weather, including extensive flooding and landslides in Mexico, and historic snowfall totals in every one of the [[Mid-Atlantic states]], brought deaths to [[Mexico]], [[New Mexico]], [[Virginia]], [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Maryland]].&lt;ref name="DCist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dcist.com/2010/02/comparative_snowpocalypse_analysis.php|title=Welcome to Comparative Snowpocalypse Analysis 101|date=2010-02-06|publisher=DCist|accessdate=8 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209022207/http://dcist.com/2010/02/comparative_snowpocalypse_analysis.php|archivedate=9 February 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most crippling was the widespread 20 to 35 in (50 to 90&amp;nbsp;cm) of snow accumulated across southern [[Pennsylvania]], the [[Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia]], [[northern Virginia]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Maryland]], [[Delaware]], and [[southern New Jersey]], bringing air and [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate Highway]] travel [[weather-related cancellation|to a halt]]. While rail service south and west of Washington, D.C. was suspended, rail travel between D.C. and Boston was available with limited service.&lt;ref name="Reuters snowstorm"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0614831920100206|title=Powerful snowstorm hits U.S. East Coast|authors=David Morgan and Eric Beech|date=2010-02-06|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=6 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Blizzard]] conditions were reported in a relatively small area of [[Maryland]], but near-blizzard conditions occurred across much of the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic region]].&lt;ref name="nwsblizzard"&gt;{{cite web|title=February 6, 2010 Blizzard Conditions|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/er/lwx/feb_6_2010_blizzard.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This event was the second of four [[nor'easters]] during the 2009-2010 winter that brought heavy snow to enough of the Northeast's population to be numerically recognized by [[NOAA]]'s [[NESIS]] intensity rating.  The first and third of these systems, the [[December 2009 Nor'Easter]] and the [[February 9–10, 2010 North American blizzard]], respectively, combined with this event to bring the snowiest winter on record to much of the Mid-Atlantic.  Additionally, this event was the second of three major Mid-Atlantic snowstorms that occurred over a 12-day period; each subsequent storm focused its heaviest snow slightly farther north: the January 30, 2010 storm (not recognized by NESIS) dropped more than a foot of snow across Virginia and the lower Chesapeake Bay region, while the [[February 9–10, 2010 North American blizzard]] bulls-eyed the [[Mason–Dixon line|Maryland-Pennsylvania]] border with as much as 38.3 inches.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc5.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc5.html|title=STORM SUMMARY MESSAGE|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Weather Prediction Center - NOAA|access-date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meteorological history==
[[File:Eastcoast after early February 2010 blizzard.jpg|thumb|Snow-covered Mid-Atlantic region of the United States]]
The main storm system originated in the Pacific Ocean, bringing heavy rain and mountain snow to [[California]] and [[Arizona]] on February 2.  The storm center moved east through northern Mexico on February 3.  The system produced over one foot of snowfall in the higher elevations and the eastern plains of [[New Mexico]], shutting down major highways including [[Interstate 40]] east of [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] for several hours on February 3.  The storm's center then advanced across [[Texas]] to the [[Louisiana]] Gulf Coast on February 4, while dropping rain and snow in [[Oklahoma]] and northern [[Texas]], and severe [[thunderstorm]]s further south.  Meanwhile, a second, more-northern disturbance tracked from the central Rockies to the lower [[Missouri River Valley]], bringing light snow showers to [[Montana]], the [[Dakotas]], parts of [[Minnesota]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Iowa]], and [[Illinois]].
[[File:Feb 7 2010 neusa snowfall.JPG|thumb|right|February 5–6, 2010 North American blizzard Mid Atlantic snowfall accumulation (from the [[National Weather Service]]).]]
On February 5, the two systems phased together, resulting in a band of heavy snow across [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Ohio]], and [[Pennsylvania]].  That evening, the northern system's energy was absorbed into the main southern circulation, promoting fast intensification.  Heavy snow subsequently developed over the [[Mid-Atlantic states]] as the storm's center tracked across [[North Carolina]] towards the Atlantic Coast.

[[File:NEXRAD 5 Feb 2010.png|thumb|right|[https://web.archive.org/web/20110720085816/http://asl.umbc.edu/~schou/Feb2010/ NEXRAD Animation from 5 February 2010.]]]
An antecedent and nearly-stationary upper-level trough over the Maritime Provinces of Canada served to block the storm system from following the traditional northeast track into New England.  Instead, during the AM hours of February 6th, the storm center slowed its northeasterly movement as it continued to deepen east of Virginia Beach, before it eventually was forced eastward.  The blocking pattern was reflected on the storm's snowfall map by a sharp northern gradient in northern New Jersey and by the axis of heaviest snow running WNW-ESE through Maryland and Delaware (opposed to the SW-NE pattern found from most Nor'Easters).  Only moderate accumulations reached the southern suburbs of New York City, with no more than light snow falling in the city itself. [[Upstate New York]] and [[New England]] were spared from this system, receiving little more than isolated snow flurries in southern sections. Easterly winds and onshore flow contributed to light snow accumulations of less than one inch in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Cape Cod]], and parts of coastal [[Rhode Island]].

According to the blog of [[Weather Channel]] senior meteorologist [[Stu Ostro]], the storm formed from "Miller Type B" cyclogenesis: a storm centered over the Ohio river runs into a blocking ridge and redevelops along the Carolina coast.  (This differed from the [[North American blizzard of 2009]], of "Miller Type A" cyclogenesis where a storm center develops over the eastern Gulf of Mexico and strengthens while tracking north to a latitude of greater temperature contrast.) This storm was carrying an enormous amount of moisture drawn from both the [[Gulf of Mexico]] (as seen on February 3 satellite imagery over Mexico), and from the Atlantic (as seen in [[radar]] imagery from early on February 5).  Ostro characterized the storm as having "strong dynamics" and expected the snowfall to be of long duration, typically leading to large accumulations.&lt;ref name="TWC Ostro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/blog/weather/8_21189.html|title=Early-mid February is going to do it *yet again*!|last=Ostro|first=Stu|date=2010-02-05|publisher=The Weather Channel|accessdate=6 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209013619/http://www.weather.com/blog/weather/8_21189.html|archivedate=9 February 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Capital Weather Gang'' blog on ''[[The Washington Post]]'' website ran an online poll on February 4, 2010, asking for reader feedback prior to the blizzard,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/capitalweathergang/2010/02/poll_storm_nametwitter_hashtag.html|accessdate=February 11, 2010|title=Vote for storm name, Twitter hashtag &amp; snow total|date=February 4, 2010|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several [[blog]]s, including the paper's own blog, followed that up by using either "Snowmageddon" and/or "Snowpocalypse" during the following days, before, during, and after the storm hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/06/us/06storm.html|accessdate=February 11, 2010|title=East Coast Is Hit by ‘Potentially Epic Snowstorm’|first1=John M.|last1=Broder|first2=Jack|last2=Healy|date=February 5, 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|location=[[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]|quote=bracing for what newspapers and bloggers have been calling the "snowpocalypse," or "snowmageddon,"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pittsburgh#Climate|Pittsburgh]] with 21.1", was the first major city to experience the storm's heavier snowfall, separating sub-20" amounts over Indiana and Ohio from 20-35" readings found in the Laurel Highlands and east.  This was Pittsburgh's 4th greatest snow event since records began in 1871.  Areas south of Pittsburgh received up to 26" of snowfall. Although initially forecast to bring only 4-8" of snow to the area, the storm's track farther to the north lead to the explosive accumulations.  The National Weather Service in Pittsburgh office recorded 7" of snow over 700P-1159P February 5 and 5.3" over 300A-600A on February 6.

[[File:Snow in Pittsburgh 2010.JPG|thumb|right|In [[Pittsburgh]], over {{Convert|20|in|cm}} of snow fell causing numerous powerlines and tree branches to buckle.]]

The swath of heaviest snowfall then crossed the [[Appalachians]] and squeezed between [[Washington, D.C.#Climate|Washington, D.C.]] and [[Baltimore#Climate|Baltimore]].  The District of Columbia's totals were generally near 20", ranging from 18 to 28".  Baltimore City's totals were around 25", ranging from 21 to 28".  Dulles
[[File:1600 block of 19th Street, N.W. - 2010 blizzard.JPG|thumb|left|19th Street in Dupont Circle, [[Washington D.C.]], [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|Northwest]], where ~24" of snow had fallen on February 6th by day's end.]]
International Airport's 32.9" set all-time records (since 1962) for most 2-day and 3-day snowfall, shattering the old records from the [[Blizzard of 1996]] of 23.2" and 24.6", respectively.  Dulles received 17.5" on February 6, however, making the day's total only the 3rd greatest 24-hour snowfall amount.  Baltimore Washington International Airport, despite being near numerous 30"+ reports, saw a relatively tame 25".  This 2-day total was 2nd greatest (since 1892), behind 26.3" from the 1922 [[Knickerbocker Storm]].  Reagan National Airport's 17.8" was one of the metro region's lowest, but still ranked as Washington's 4th greatest (since 1871) in both 2-day and 3-day totals.

Additional local reports from Maryland include: Edgemere, 35.4"; Clarksville, 34.9"; Crofton, 34.0"; Columbia, 33.8"; Laurel, 32.9"; Pasadena, 31.0"; Dundalk, 30.5"; [[Ellicott City]], 30.2"; Frederick, 29.0";  Olney, 28.0"; Germantown, 27.4"; and [[Catonsville]], 22.9".

[[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania#Climate|Philadelphia]]'s 28.5" ranked the storm as the city's 2nd greatest on record (since 1872), falling not far behind the [[Blizzard of 1996]]'s 30.7".  This made for Philadelphia's first winter with multiple 20"+ storms, following the 23.2" from the [[North American blizzard of 2009]].  Wilmington, DE's 25.8" was their greatest storm total of all-time (since 1894), passing the 1996 storm's 22".

Many counties, including the rural areas across the Appalachian mountains and Delmarva averaged over two feet of snow.

The storm was well spotted by the winter storm reconnaissance (WSR) program at National Center of Environmental Predictions (NCEP). Two aircraft missions were deployed over the Pacific regions on February 1, 2010. Accurate measurement in the cloudy regions were taken, the data were assimilated by the global forecast models in different numerical forecast prediction centers.

The [[WSR program]] is led by [[Dr. Yucheng Song]] from the [[National Centers for Environmental Prediction]] (NCEP).

==Impact==

===Mexico===
Freak winter rains across Mexico collapsed hillsides, sent rivers over their banks and left at least 15 people dead, officials said on Friday, February 5. The rain, which began early in the week and peaked on Thursday, February 4, had relented by Friday morning, providing officials with their first good look at the damage. More than half of the country was affected. The hardest area hit by the storm was the western state of [[Michoacán]], a famous reserve for [[monarch butterflies]], where at least 13 people were killed by landslides and flooding. An unknown number of people were missing Friday.&lt;ref name="LATimes Ellingwood"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-fg-mexico-rains6-2010feb06,0,4225487.story |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |title=Mexico rainstorms leave at least 15 dead |first=Ken |last=Ellingwood |date=February 6, 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other areas that were hard hit by flooding was the eastern Mexico City borough of [[Iztapalapa]] and municipalities in eastern [[State of Mexico]] such as [[Ciudad Nezahualcóyotl]] and [[Ecatepec de Morelos]].&lt;ref name="robles"&gt;{{cite news |title=Baja probabilidad de lluvia en Valle de México |first=Johana |last=Robles |url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/656537.html |newspaper=El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=2010-02-05 |accessdate=2010-02-07 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Low probability of rain in the Valley of Mexico}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rain broke records for February in Michoacán, the State of Mexico and Mexico City, with twice the normal amount for the entire month falling in 24 hours.&lt;ref name="cutzamala"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lluvia histórica sube nivel del Cutzamala |url=http://mx.news.yahoo.com/s/04022010/90/n-mexico-lluvia-historica-sube-nivel-cutzamala.html |newspaper=El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=2010-02-04 |accessdate=2010-02-07 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Historic rain raises level of the Cutzamala |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208193502/http://mx.news.yahoo.com/s/04022010/90/n-mexico-lluvia-historica-sube-nivel-cutzamala.html |archivedate=February 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a silver lining: Officials said the copious rain had filled reservoirs outside [[Mexico City]] that are a key source of water for the metropolis.

Prolonged rains from Thursday morning through Thursday evening (February 4), produced widespread rainfall totals of {{Convert|1|in|cm}} – {{Convert|4|in|cm}} statewide with flooding reported in portions of Central and Southern [[Mississippi]].

====Midwest====
Heavy snowfall occurred in [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], and [[Ohio]] February 4–6. Snowfall totals ranged from {{Convert|6|in|cm}} to over {{Convert|1|ft|m}} across the region. Drifts of up to {{Convert|4|ft|m}} were reported in central Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/ind/?n=feb052010snow|title=Indianapolis, IN|first=US Department of Commerce, NOAA, National Weather|last=Service|website=www.crh.noaa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heavy snow, [[ice storms]] and low temperatures of January the 26th led to [[Interstate 90]] being closed from [[Chamberlain, South Dakota]] to the [[Minnesota]] border.&lt;ref name="rapidcityjournal.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rapidcityjournal.com/news/article_6dd91054-09fb-11df-8bdc-001cc4c03286.html|title=Power and water shortages cripple reservation|first=Andrea J.

In the Dakotas a number of Indian Reservations were left without power or running water.

"There's been winters this bad before, but not with rain so bad it freezes the power lines and snaps the poles", said Joseph Brings Plenty, the 38-year-old chairman of the Cheyenne River Sioux tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704094304575029450101290726 | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Storm Takes Steep Toll on Destitute Tribe | first=Joel | last=Millman | date=January 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Power outages began with a storm in December knocking down around 5,000 power poles, and was accelerated by an ice storm Jan. 22 knocking down another 3,000 power lines on the reservation.

Among the tribes of South Dakota who suffered from the multiple storms were [[Cheyenne River Sioux]], [[Crow Creek Sioux Tribe]], [[Flandreau-Santee Sioux Tribe]], [[Lower Brule Sioux Tribe]], [[Rosebud Sioux Tribe]], [[Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate]] and [[Standing Rock Sioux Tribe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiancountrytoday.com/national/plains/83646472.html|title=Indian Country Media Network - Native News, Art &amp; Traditions|website=www.indiancountrytoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mid-Atlantic====
The [[United States Government]] implemented an unscheduled leave policy for federal employees on Friday February 5 and shut down four hours early in an effort to clear metropolitan Washington before substantial snow accumulations began. Numerous school districts in the metro DC area announced closures for Friday February 5 well in advance, although [[District of Columbia Public Schools]] and some Maryland schools held a half day of class. Many districts had used all their built-in snow days and some began scheduling classes on upcoming holidays (for example, [[Fairfax County]] on February 15, the Monday of [[President's Day]] weekend).&lt;ref name="WashPost Halsey Weil"&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/06/AR2010020600683.html |title=Snowstorm's intensity has D.C. region hunkering down |first=Ashley III |last=Halsey |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Martin |last2=Weil |newspaper=Washington Post |date=February 6, 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Late on Sunday February 7, the [[Office of Personnel Management]] announced that the [[United States Government]] would again be closed on Monday February 8, with only emergency/essential personnel required to report, and numerous school districts again canceled classes between February 9–11.

As of shortly after midnight on February 6, more than 50,000 homes and businesses in the [[Washington, D.C.]] metropolitan area were without electricity. In northern Virginia, the total was 33,000 and in northern Maryland and the [[District of Columbia]] the total was 19,000. Roadways were blanketed with snow, [[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority|Metro]] bus service ended at 9&amp;nbsp;pm EST, and above ground Metro rail service had also ended. Flights were canceled at the Washington-Baltimore area's three main airports and at [[Philadelphia International Airport]]. [[Delta Air Lines]] had suspended flights in and out of Washington, Baltimore, and Philadelphia.

In Maryland, the [[Maryland Transit Administration]] ran special snow trains on its heavy rail and light rail lines to keep tracks clear. [[Delaware]] Gov. [[Jack Markell]] declared a state of emergency Friday night and ordered all vehicles off the roads by 10&amp;nbsp;p.m. EST (this was in addition to an earlier state of emergency declared by Virginia Gov. [[Bob McDonnell]] and snow emergencies declared in the [[District of Columbia]] and some Maryland counties).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Morrison|first=Greg|title=Travel grinds to halt after powerful mid-Atlantic snowstorm|date=February 6, 2010|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/weather/02/06/winter.storm/index.html|work=CNN}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Maryland was under a state of emergency as of mid-day on February 6, as state and county road crews said they were struggling to keep even one lane open on major roads and 151,000 customers were without power in Maryland, including 34,000 [[Baltimore Gas and Electric]] Co. customers in the region.

In [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], both the impact and severity of the storm caught many by surprise.  Snow began falling in earnest late Friday morning.  The sudden onset of the storm forced many local school districts, especially districts south of the city, to close early due to rapidly deteriorating road conditions; this is an extremely uncommon event for schools in southwestern Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thepittsburghchannel.com/news/22472114/detail.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206222419/http://www.thepittsburghchannel.com/news/22472114/detail.html |archivedate=2010-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nearly all schools, including the [[Pittsburgh Public Schools]], cancelled classes the following week.  Most local universities were also forced to cancel classes for much of the following week due to the storm's effects.  Additionally, over 130,000 people in the Pittsburgh area were without power as a result of the heavy, wet snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kdka.com/local/power.outages.update.2.1475372.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313054330/http://kdka.com/local/power.outages.update.2.1475372.html |archivedate=2010-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For many residents, power was not restored until Monday, February 15.

In New Jersey, the southern part of the state got hit with areas of 20+ inches of snow and some parts of the north got 0 to trace. Many reports of sleet and snow were coming in by the thousands in the state of NJ.

'''''Fort McMoney''''' is a 2013 [[web documentary]] and [[strategy video game]] about [[Fort McMurray]], [[Alberta]], Canada and [[Athabasca oil sands]] development, directed by {{Interlanguage link multi|David Dufresne|fr}}. The documentary uses interactive game elements to allow users to decide the city's future and attempt to responsibly develop the world's largest [[oil sands]] reserves.

==Game play==
The game consists of three episodes, each played in real-time over a four-week period. Starting November 25, users will decide on the virtual future of the city, while exploring the social, economic, political and cultural history of Fort McMurray. Players will be able to virtually walk around the city, meet residents and ask them questions. Each week, they'll be able to vote in referendums and surveys that will affect the city's virtual future, engage in debates, and attempt to win other players over to their "worldview" in order influence the city's development. The game is trilingual: available in English, French, and German.&lt;ref name="Chapsal"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.journaldemontreal.com/2013/11/20/le-jeu-au-service-du-documentaire|title=Le jeu au service du documentaire|last=Chapsal|first=Agnès|date=20 November 2013|work=QMI Agency|format=Interview|publisher=[[Journal de Montréal]]|language=French|accessdate=21 November 2013|location=Montreal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cooke&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mymcmurray.com/nfbs-fort-mcmoney-documentary-game-released-online-november-25/|title=NFB’s "Fort McMoney" documentary game released online November 25|last=Cooke|first=Evan|date=4 November 2013|work=MyMcMurray.com|publisher=[[Rogers Media]]|accessdate=21 November 2013|location=Fort McMurray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
''Fort McMoney'' incorporates 60 days of filming in more than 22 locations in the city, including 55 interviews.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1004">'''Gas focusing''', also known as '''ionic focusing'''.  

Rather than being dispersed, a beam of charged particles travelling in an [[inert gas]] environment sometimes becomes narrower.  This is ascribed to the generation of gas ions which diffuse outwards, neutralizing the particle beam globally, and producing an intense radial [[electric field]] which applies a radially inward force to the particles in the beam.

[[File:Global Wind Atlas 2.2.png|thumb|Screenshot of the Global Wind Atlas website (version 2.2)]]

The '''Global Wind Atlas''' is a web-based application developed to help policymakers and investors identify potential high-wind areas for [[wind power]] generation virtually anywhere in the world, and perform preliminary calculations. It provides free access to data on wind power density and wind speed at multiple heights using the latest historical weather data and modeling, at an output resolution of 250 meters. It was developed and is maintained by the Wind Energy Department of the [[Technical University of Denmark]] (DTU Wind Energy) in partnership with the [[World Bank]], with funding provided by the [[Energy Sector Management Assistance Program]] (ESMAP).

== History ==
The original version of the Global Wind Atlas (GWA 1.0) was developed by DTU Wind Energy under the framework of the [[Clean Energy Ministerial]] (CEM) and, in particular, the CEM Working Group on Solar and Wind Technologies, led by Germany, Spain and Denmark. The Technology Development and Demonstration Program of the [[Danish Energy Agency]] (EUDP 11-II, 64011-0347) funded GWA 1.0 as the Danish contribution to the objectives of the working group. GWA 1.0 was launched in 2015, and benefited from collaboration with the [[International Renewable Energy Agency]] (IRENA) and the [[MASDAR Institute]]. The IRENA Global Atlas of Renewable Energy created a dedicated platform to serve GWA 1.0 data to a worldwide audience.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irena.org/newsroom/articles/2015/Oct/Seeing-the-Wind-with-the-New-Global-Wind-Atlas&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2017, DTU Wind Energy entered into discussions with ESMAP at the World Bank to update and improve the Global Wind Atlas, and bring it into line with the Global Solar Atlas that was launched by the World Bank in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New World Bank Tool Helps Map Solar Potential |url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2017/01/17/new-world-bank-tool-helps-map-solar-potential |accessdate=30 November 2018 |agency=[[World Bank]] |date=17 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Utilizing funding provided under ESMAP's existing initiative on renewable energy resource assessment and mapping,&lt;ref name="ESMAP_RE_Mapping"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the company VORTEX FDC was commissioned to carry out a global mesoscale wind energy modeling exercise at 9 km resolution. This data was provided to DTU Wind Energy for further microscale modeling, initially down to 1 km resolution. In November 2018 a new version of the Global Wind Atlas (GWA 2.0) was launched by DTU Wind Energy and the World Bank at the Wind Europe 2018 conference in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, based on a completely redesigned user interface developed by the company Nazka Mapps. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2017/11/28/mapping-the-worlds-wind-energy-potential Mapping the World's Wind Energy Potential] ''[[World Bank]]'', 28 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vindenergi.dtu.dk/english/news/2017/11/new-global-wind-atlas-to-be-presented-at-windeurope-conference New Global Wind Atlas to be presented at WindEurope Conference] ''[[Technical University of Denmark]]'', 21 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wind Power Monthly. 2017.[https://www.windpowermonthly.com/article/1451718/windeurope-2017-global-wind-atlas-launched WindEurope 2017: Global Wind Atlas launched].&lt;/ref&gt;

Following further modeling work, a new version of the microscale modeling data was released in July 2018 (GWA 2.1), bringing the resolution down to 250 meters. This was followed by a further release in September 2018 (GWA 2.2) that included a number of improvements to the user interface, a new tool for preparing and downloading poster maps, and various bug fixes. The most recent release, in November 2018 (GWA 2.3) introduced three capacity factor layers, new wind roses, and improved calculation of power density, and the ability to download GIS files, among other features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About: Release Notes |url=https://globalwindatlas.info/about/ReleaseNotes |website=Global Wind Atlas |publisher=DTU Wind Energy |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==
The Global Wind Atlas is based on a coupling of mesoscale to microscale modeling. The mesoscale modeling carried out by Vortex uses [[ECMWF re-analysis|ERA Interim]] meteorological re-analysis data provided by the [[European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts]]. While tools such as the Global Wind Atlas can provide useful data to support planning and initial site scoping, they are no replacement for the more detailed analysis needed when evaluating actual wind farm projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ioannis |first1=Papadopoulos |title=Wind atlases no substitute for on-ground experience |url=https://www.windpowermonthly.com/article/1519111/wind-atlases-no-substitute-on-ground-experience |accessdate=30 November 2018 |work=Wind Power Monthly |date=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the data available via the Global Wind Atlas website, users may also download poster maps, GIS data, and Generalized Wind Climate (GWC) files for use in commercial wind resource assessment software such as [[WAsP]].

GIS data from the Global Wind Atlas is available via the by the IRENA Global Atlas for Renewable Energy, and has been included as the core wind data in the [[RETScreen]] software.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6465643559537176577/&lt;/ref&gt; It is used by governments, renewable energy developers, and academics, and has an average of 7,500 unique users per month as of October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;http://cphpost.dk/news/south-korea-eyeing-danish-energy-solutions.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2944">In [[theoretical physics]], a '''graviphoton''' or '''gravivector''' is a hypothetical particle which emerges as an excitation of the [[metric tensor]] (i.e. gravitational field) in spacetime dimensions higher than four, as described in [[Kaluza–Klein theory]].
However, its crucial physical properties are analogous to a (massive) [[photon]]: it induces a "vector force", sometimes dubbed a "[[fifth force]]". The [[electromagnetic potential]] &lt;math&gt;A_\mu&lt;/math&gt; emerges from an extra component of the metric tensor &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu 5}&lt;/math&gt;, where the figure 5 labels an additional, [[Five-dimensional space|fifth dimension]].&lt;ref name="maa" /&gt;

In gravity theories with [[extended supersymmetry]] ([[Supergravity|extended supergravities]]), a graviphoton is normally a [[superpartner]] of the [[graviton]] that behaves like a photon, and is prone to couple with gravitational strength, as was appreciated in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="zac" /&gt; Unlike the graviton, however, it may provide a ''repulsive'' (as well as an attractive) force, and thus, in some technical sense, a type of [[anti-gravity]]. Under special circumstances, then, in several natural models, often descending from five-dimensional theories mentioned, it may actually cancel the gravitational attraction in the static limit.&lt;ref name="zac" /&gt;  [[Joël Scherk]] investigated semirealistic aspects of this phenomenon,&lt;ref name="sch" /&gt;  thereby opening up an ongoing search&lt;ref  name="poll" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fabbrichesi | first1 = M. | last2 = Roland | first2 = K. | doi = 10.1016/0550-3213(92)90626-M | title = Strong anti-gravity | journal = Nuclear Physics B | volume = 388 | issue = 2 | pages = 539 | year = 1992 |arxiv = hep-th/9205033 |bibcode = 1992NuPhB.388..539F }}&lt;/ref&gt; for physical manifestations of the mechanism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12899">'''Hans Grassmann''' (Bamberg, 21 May 1960) is a [[:Category:German physicists|German physicist]], writer and entrepreneur, who teaches and works in [[Italy]]. Grassmann is the author of four books and more than 250 scientific publications, and is the founder and managing director of the research company Isomorph srl.

His main contributions to physics include the development of a (Tl) [[calorimeter]] with a [[photodiode]]; developing the analysis of asymmetry in the production of the [[W and Z bosons|W particle]]; a contribution to the discovery of the [[top quark]], the development of a physics theory of information; the design and development of a [[wind turbine]] with an external duct; and the realization of the [[linear mirror]] for the concentration of solar energy. Grassmann has worked in Italy since 1988.

==Life and work==

===Study of physics===
From 1979 to 1984, Grassmann studied physics at the [[University of Erlangen]] and the [[University of Hamburg]]. For his [[laurea]] thesis, he developed a detection method for high energy photons using a [[Scintillator|scintillating crystal]] (CsI(Tl)) [[calorimeter]] with [[photodiode]] readout. Advanced scientific experiments make use of this technology, including the [[Crystal-Barrel]], the [[BaBar]], the [[CLEO (particle detector)|CLEO]], the [[Belle experiment]]s and the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope|Glast]] satellite.

From 1984 to 1988, Grassmann was part of the [[UA1 experiment]] at [[CERN]] in Geneva, where he wrote his PhD thesis.

From 1987 to 1999, Grassmann worked with the [[CDF collaboration]] at the [[Tevatron collider]] in the Fermi National Laboratory ([[Fermilab]]), close to Chicago and at the [[Superconducting Super Collider]] laboratory (Dallas).

In 1988 with his student, [[S. Leone (person)|S. Leone]], he developed the study of the asymmetry in production and decay of the [[W-boson]] at the [[Tevatron]] [[proton]]–[[antiproton]] collider. [[W boson]]s are predominantly produced in collisions of [[valence quark]]s; therefore, one can determine the kinematic properties of the [[up quark|up]] and [[down quarks]] in the [[proton]] and [[antiproton]] from the observation of W production. By analyzing the relative difference in the production of W&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and W&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; particles, one can substantially reduce the effects of systematic uncertainties in the experimental device.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1994, this analysis was successfully applied by Grassmann, G. Bellettini and M. Cobal. The top quark was observed in Tevatron collider data.&lt;ref&gt;

The variable entropy used in information theory is not a state function; therefore, it is not the thermodynamic entropy used in physics. Grassmann made use of existing and established concepts, such as message, amount of information or complexity, but set them in a new mathematical framework. His approach is based on vector algebra or on [[Boolean algebra (introduction)|Boolean algebra]] instead of probability theory.

===Renewable Energies===

Grassmann also developed an approach for studying shrouded [[wind turbines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V4S-44R2ND5-1&amp;_user=3718927&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000061208&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=3718927&amp;md5=78b50edc9c028e30a2734b59a5c2773b|title=Upgrading conventional wind turbines |accessdate=2009-02-10|author1=F.

[[File:LinearMirror.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Linear mirror]]

In 2006 Isomorph undertook the development of a system of mirrors - the so-called [[Linear mirror]] - for the concentration of solar energy. This system is a  very simple and therefore inexpensive structure, which allows to create a full-scale prototype without the need of outside partners. In 'October 2008, the Linear mirror received its first award from the [[Italian Physical Society]], which honors [[Alessandro Prest]], an employee of the Isomorph, for the presentation of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sif.it/attivita/congresso/xciv/comunicazioni |title=Migliori comunicazioni 2008 |author=Società Italiana di Fisica |deadurl=no |accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mirror came into operation for the first time in autumn 2008, fulfilling all the expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isomorph.it/solutions/renewable-energies/solar-thermal/power-measurement |title=Measurement of the power transfer in a Linear mirror with 20 mirror elements |author=Isomorph srl |deadurl=no |accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010 the first [[Linear mirror]] was installed by the town of Pontebba&lt;ref&gt;http://www.comune.pontebba.ud.it/Progetto-specchio-lineare.3774.0.html?&amp;L=0|titolo=Progetto specchio lineare)&lt;/ref&gt; to provide thermal energy to the local kindergarten. In the same year the town of Pontebba  successfully participated to the National contest for the election of the most virtuous municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comunivirtuosi.org |title=Ass. dei Comuni Virtuosi |publisher=Comunivirtuosi.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011 Hans Grassmann has received the "[[Nuclear-Free Future Award]], with the motivation that the [[Linear mirror]] can be able to contribute to the replacement of nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuclear-free.com/eng/release.htm |title=Nuclear-Free Future Award Announcements |publisher=Nuclear-free.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012 the [[Linear mirror]] received the [[Solar keymark]] certificate by CERTCO DIN (DIN EN 12795-1:2006-06 and DIN EN 12795-2:2006-06).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isomorph.it/solutions/renewable-energies/solar-thermal/Linear%20Mirror/certco&lt;/ref&gt; Tests for the Solar Keymark were carried out by the Fraunhofer Institute Freiburg.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isomorph.it/solutions/renewable-energies/solar-thermal/resolveuid/1da56c7c5ff66e2ca6b054dd73d937e0&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entrepreneurship===
In 2004, Grassmann founded Isomorph, which creates scientific concepts, procedures and devices based on physics research. Isomorph's research is independent of the scientific-administrative complex.

Isomorph developed an innovative [[Concentrating solar power|concentrating mirror]] system to make economic use of [[solar energy]]. It is a simple system and cheap to produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isomorph.it/solutions/renewable-energies/solar-thermal/power-measurement|title=Measurement of the power transfer in a Linear mirror with 20 mirror elements|accessdate=2009-02-10|author=Isomorph srl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Prest, H. Grassmann, "The linear mirror for solar energy exploitation", submitted to Nuovo Cimento Letters on 30-12-2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books===
Grassmann has explained physics to the general public in books and newspaper articles, noting that "everybody can understand physics. What cannot be understood is not physics."&lt;ref&gt;Grassmann, H.: ''Ahnung von der Materie – Physik für alle.'', Dumont, 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-8321-8082-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; His books about the relationship between science and society are available in several translations.

'''''Killer Company: James Hardie Exposed''''' is a 2009 Australian book by journalist [[Matt Peacock (journalist)|Matt Peacock]]. 

==Overview==
The book documents how the use of harmful [[asbestos]] fibre in building materials produced by [[James Hardie Industries]] "led to the deaths of thousands of workers and customers, who were never informed of the dangers".&lt;ref name=walk/&gt; Working with asbestos products, such as "[[fibro]]", resulted in medical abnormalities, such as [[asbestosis]]. The book opens with the story of [[Bernie Banton]], former James Hardie employee, who suffered from asbestos-induced [[fibrosis]] and later died.&lt;ref name=walk&gt;Angela Welsh. [http://www.walkleys.com/books/490/ Review: Killer Company] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221234530/http://www.walkleys.com/books/490/ |date=2011-02-21 }} ''The Walkley Foundation'', 27 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Peacock, James Hardie Industries circumvented the rules and regulations designed to protect the community from serious health hazards.&lt;ref name=walk/&gt; Peacock states that "Hardie embarked on a cold, calculated strategy to maximise profits, minimise compensation and conceal the culprits".&lt;ref&gt;Matt Peacock.

==Awards and Legacy==
''Killer Company'' was a finalist for the [[Walkley Award|Walkley]] non-fiction book of the year in 2009.&lt;ref name=walk/&gt;
''[[Devil's Dust]]'', a docudrama based on ''Killer Company'', was released in 2012, with [[Ewen Leslie]] portraying Peacock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/devil-is-in-the-detail-20121107-28x5k.html|title=Devil is in the detail|author=Tim Elliott|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=8 November 2012|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Large Plasma Device''' (often stylized as '''LArge Plasma Device''' or '''LAPD''') is an experimental physics device housed at the Basic Plasma Science Facility at [[UCLA]].

== Machine overview ==

[[Image:Lapd interior.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Photo taken through an end port with the plasma off, showing the thermionic cathode.]]
The LAPD is a linear pulsed-discharge device operated at a high (1&amp;nbsp;Hz) repetition rate, producing a strongly magnetized background plasma which is physically large enough to support [[Alfvén waves]].  Plasma is produced from a [[barium oxide]] (BaO) cathode-anode discharge at one end of a 20-meter long, 1 meter diameter cylindrical vacuum vessel ([https://web.archive.org/web/20060908110756/http://plasma.physics.ucla.edu/bapsf/pages/diag2.html diagram]).  The resulting plasma column is roughly 16.5 meters long and 60&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter.  The background magnetic field, produced by a series of large electromagnets surrounding the chamber, can be varied from 400 gauss to 2.5 kilogauss (40 to 250 [[millitesla|mT]]).

=== Plasma parameters ===

Because the LAPD is a general-purpose research device, the plasma parameters are carefully selected to make diagnostics simple without the problems associated with hotter (e.g. fusion-level) plasmas, while still providing a useful environment in which to do research. The typical operational parameters are:  

* Density: ''n'' = 1–4 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;
* Temperature: ''T''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = 6 eV, T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 eV
* Background field: ''B'' = 400–2500 gauss (40–250 mT)

In principle, a plasma may be generated from any kind of gas, but inert gases are typically used to prevent the plasma from destroying the coating on the barium oxide cathode. Examples of gases used are [[helium]], [[argon]], [[nitrogen]] and [[neon]]. [[Hydrogen]] is sometimes used for short periods of time. Multiple gases can also be mixed in varying ratios within the chamber to produce multi-species plasmas.

At these parameters, the ion [[Larmor radius]] is a few millimeters, and the [[Debye length]] is tens of micrometres.  Importantly, it also implies that the Alfvén wavelength is a few meters, and in fact shear Alfvén waves are routinely observed in the LAPD.  This is the main reason for the 20-meter length of the device.

=== Plasma sources ===

The main source of plasma within the LAPD is produced via discharge from the barium oxide (BaO) coated cathode, which emits electrons via [[thermionic emission]].  The cathode is located near the end of the LAPD and is made from a thin nickel sheet, uniformly heated to roughly 900°C.  The circuit is closed by a molybdenum mesh anode a short distance away.  Typical discharge currents are in the range of 3-8 [[kiloampere]]s at 60-90 volts, supplied by a custom-designed transistor switch backed by a 4-[[farad]] capacitor bank.

A secondary cathode source made of [[lanthanum hexaboride]] (LaB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) was developed in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=C. M.|last2=Gekelman|first2=W.|last3=Pribyl|first3=P.|last4=Lucky|first4=Z.|date=16 Aug 2010|title=A new large area lanthanum hexaboride plasma source|journal=Review of Scientific Instruments|language=en|volume=81|issue=8|pages=083503|doi=10.1063/1.3471917|pmid=20815604|issn=0034-6748|bibcode=2010RScI...81h3503C}}&lt;/ref&gt; to provide a hotter and denser plasma when required. It consists of four square tiles joined to form a 20 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt;20 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area and is located at the other end of the LAPD.  The circuit is also closed by a molybdenum mesh anode, which may be placed further down the machine, and is slightly smaller in size to the one used to close the BaO cathode source.  The LaB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; cathode is typically heated to temperatures above 1750°C by a graphite heater, and produces discharge currents of 2.2 kiloamperes at 150 volts.

The plasma in the LAPD is usually pulsed at 1&amp;nbsp;Hz, with the background BaO source on for 10-20 milliseconds at a time.  If the LaB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; source is being utilized, it typically discharges together BaO cathode, but for a shorter period of time (about 5–8 ms) nearing the end of each discharge cycle.  The use of an oxide-cathode plasma source, along with a well-designed transistor switch for the discharge, allows for a plasma environment which is extremely reproducible shot-to-shot.

One interesting aspect of the BaO plasma source is its ability to act as an "Alfvén [[Maser]]", a source of large-amplitude, coherent shear Alfvén waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maggs|first=J. E.|last2=Morales|first2=G. J.|last3=Carter|first3=T. A.|date=14 Dec 2004|title=An Alfvén wave maser in the laboratory|journal=Physics of Plasmas|language=en|volume=12|issue=1|pages=013103|doi=10.1063/1.1823413|issn=1070-664X|bibcode=2005PhPl...12a3103M}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The resonant cavity is formed by the highly reflective nickel cathode and the semitransparent grid anode.  Since the source is located at the end of the [[solenoid]] which generates the main LAPD background field, there is a gradient in the magnetic field within the cavity.  As shear waves do not propagate above the ion [[gyrofrequency|cyclotron frequency]], the practical effect of this is to act as a filter on the modes which may be excited.  Maser activity occurs spontaneously at certain combinations of magnetic field strength and discharge current, and in practice may be activated (or avoided) by the machine user.

== Diagnostic access and probes ==

=== Probes ===
The main diagnostic is the movable probe.  The relatively low electron temperature makes probe construction straightforward and does not require the use of exotic materials.  Most probes are constructed in-house within the facility and include magnetic field probes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Everson|first=E. T.|last2=Pribyl|first2=P.|last3=Constantin|first3=C. G.|last4=Zylstra|first4=A.|last5=Schaeffer|first5=D.|last6=Kugland|first6=N. L.|last7=Niemann|first7=C.|date=18 Nov 2009|title=Design, construction, and calibration of a three-axis, high-frequency magnetic probe (B-dot probe) as a diagnostic for exploding plasmas|journal=Review of Scientific Instruments|language=en|volume=80|issue=11|pages=113505|doi=10.1063/1.3246785|pmid=19947729|issn=0034-6748|bibcode=2009RScI...80k3505E}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Langmuir probe]]s, Mach probes (to measure flow), electric dipole probes and many others.  Standard probe design also allows external users to bring their own diagnostics with them, if they desire.  Each probe is inserted through its own vacuum interlock, which allows probes to be added and removed while the device is in operation. 

A 1&amp;nbsp;Hz rep-rate, coupled with the high reproducibility of the background plasma, allows the rapid collection of enormous datasets.  An experiment on LAPD is typically designed to be repeated once per second, for as many hours or days as is necessary to assemble a complete set of observations.  This makes it possible to diagnose experiments using a small number of movable probes, in contrast to the large probe arrays used in many other devices.

The entire length of the device is fitted with "ball joints," vacuum-tight angular couplings (invented by a LAPD staff member) which allow probes to be inserted and rotated, both vertically and horizontally.  In practice, these are used in conjunction with computer-controlled motorized probe drives to sample "planes" (vertical cross-sections) of the background plasma with whatever probe is desired.  Since the only limitation on the amount of data to be taken (number of points in the plane) is the amount of time spent recording shots at 1&amp;nbsp;Hz, it is possible to assemble large volumetric datasets consisting of many planes at different axial locations.

Visualizations composed from such volumetric measurements can be seen at [http://plasma.physics.ucla.edu/page/gallery.html the LAPD gallery].

Including the ball joints, there are a total of 450 access ports on the machine, some of which are fitted with windows for optical or microwave observation.

=== Other diagnostics ===
A variety of other diagnostics are also available at the LAPD to compliment probe measurements. These include [[photodiode|photodiodes]], microwave [[interferometer|interferometers]], a high speed camera (3 ns/frame) and [[laser-induced fluorescence]].

'''Linolelaidic acid''' is an [[omega-6]] [[trans fat|trans fatty acid]] (TFA) and is a geometric [[isomer]] of [[linoleic acid]]. It is found in partially [[Hydrogenation|hydrogenated]] vegetable oils.  It also comprises 12.39% of the fats from the fruit of the [[durian]] species ''[[Durio graveolens]]''.&lt;ref name="Nasaruddin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nasaruddin|first1=Mohd hanif|last2=Noor|first2=Noor Qhairul Izzreen Mohd|last3=Mamat|first3=Hasmadi|title=Komposisi Proksimat dan Komponen Asid Lemak Durian Kuning (Durio graveolens) Sabah|journal=Sains Malaysiana|date=2013|volume=42|issue=9|pages=1283–1288|url=http://www.ukm.my/jsm/pdf_files/SM-PDF-42-9-2013/11%20Mohd%20Hanif.pdf|accessdate=28 November 2017|trans-title=Proximate and Fatty Acid Composition of Sabah Yellow Durian (''Durio graveolens'')|language=Malay|format=PDF|issn=0126-6039|oclc=857479186}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a white (or colourless) viscous liquid.

TFAs are classified as conjugated and nonconjugated, corresponding usually to the structural elements -CH=CH-CH=CH- and -CH=CH-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH=CH-, respectively. Nonconjugated TFAs are represented by [[elaidic acid]] and linolelaidic acid. Their presence is linked heart diseases. The TFA [[vaccenic acid]], which is of animal origin, poses less of a health risk.&lt;ref&gt;Park, Yeonhwa "Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA): Good or bad trans fat?"

'''Luxgen M7''', previously the '''Luxgen7 MPV''' is a 7-passenger [[Taiwan]]ese [[automobile]] produced by [[Luxgen]] beginning from 2009. The vehicle was developed under [[Yulon]]'s R&amp;D center, [[Hua-chuang Automobile Information Technical Center|HAITEC]]. It was officially shown to the public on 19 August 2009, and hit showrooms on 9/19/2009. The car is powered by a 2.2 L [[Inline-4 engine|I-4]] MEFI turbocharged engine developed by tuned by [[Delphi (auto parts)|Delphi]]. The platform is derived from the [[Renault Espace]]. The turbocharger is supplied by [[Garrett AiResearch|Garrett]] and powers the engine up to {{convert|175|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5,200 rpm and {{convert|28|kgm|Nm lbft|abbr=on}} of torque from 2,500 to 4,000 rpm. The 5-speed [[Manumatic]] transmission is supplied by [[Aisin]]. Pricing starts at NT$798,000 up to NT$1,068,000. [[Antilock braking system|ABS]], [[Electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]], [[Brake assist system|BAS]], and the Think+ Multi-purpose system(slightly different by trim level) are all standard equipment. The targeted competitor is the [[BYD M6]]. In 2014, the Luxgen7 MPV received a facelift and name change to Luxgen M7 to fit the new Luxgen naming theme.

The [[voice control]]led ''Luxgen Think+'' system (co-developed with [[HTC Corporation|HTC]]) combines the on-board [[Windows CE]] computer with the [[Electronic Stability Control]] system and it provides 3.5G mobile internet connection, [[GPS navigation device|GPS navigation]], along with travel, shop, and traffic information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.product-reviews.net/2009/08/25/taiwans-new-luxgen-7-mpv-features-htc-think-computer/ Taiwan’s new LUXGEN 7 MPV features HTC THINK+ computer]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Luxgen M7 Turbo EcoHyper facelift.jpg|thumb|left|Facelifted Luxgen M7 Turbo (Asia)]]
A facelift was done in 2014 with a redesigned front bumper, dark head lamps with DRL, and a new set of LED tail lamps. The name was changed from Luxgen7 MPV to Luxgen M7 turbo Eco hyper, and the engine was also updated with a retuned 2.2- liter I4 turbo one with improved horsepower of 202PS and {{convert|30|kgm|Nm lbft|abbr=on}}  of torque from 2,400 to 4,000 rpm. The fuel efficiency was also improved to 13.57&amp;nbsp;km/l(EPA) and 11.8&amp;nbsp;km/l(EU).

==EV+==
Luxgen also introduced the world's first electric MPV, Luxgen7 MPV [[electric vehicle]] co-developed by [[AC Propulsion]]. The top speed is {{convert|145|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} and the electric range is {{convert|350|km}} at {{convert|40|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luxgen-motor.com.tw/cars/EV/ Luxgen EV (Chinese)]&lt;/ref&gt;
While most of the exterior was based on the regular Luxgen7 MPV, the EV+ receives a different front bumper and grille compartment design and clear tail lamp clusters in a lightly tinted blue color.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1740">In [[electronics]], a '''micropup''' is a style of triode  [[vacuum tube]] (valve) developed during World War II for use at very high frequencies such as those used in [[radar]]. They are characterized by an external [[anode]] block, which allows better heat dissipation. These tubes could deliver radio frequency power on the order of kilowatts at wavelengths as short as 25 cm.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.ase-museoedelpro.org/Museo_Edelpro/Catalogo/tubes/Family_descr_doc/coll_P5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;, and on the order of 100 kW at 200 MHZ in pulses. Micropup tubes used very high voltages to minimize the transit time of electrons between anode and cathode.&lt;ref&gt;United States Department of the Army ''Generation and Transmission of Microwave Energy'', Technical Manual TM 11-673, June 1953, pp. 114-116 &lt;/ref&gt; 

The development of the micropup vacuum tube was made possible by the development of vacuum-tight joining of copper to glass, around 1939. The designs used a cylindrical anode and a concentric cylindrical grid electrode; the cathode was directly heated thoriated tungsten wires, which after the first types were all oxide coated to improve electron emission. One type, the NT99 developed by [[General Electric Company|GEC]] could produce up to 200 kW peak output (for a pair of tubes) when used in 600 MHZ radar sets. Although widely used in "metre-band" radar systems, the [[cavity magnetron]] was able to produce significant power at much higher frequencies, as radar systems developed during the war. &lt;ref&gt; F.A.

'''Nuclear material''' refers to the metals [[uranium]], [[plutonium]], and [[thorium]], in any form, according to the [[IAEA]].  This is differentiated further into "source material", consisting of natural and depleted uranium, and "special fissionable material", consisting of [[enriched uranium]] ([[U-235]]), [[uranium-233]], and [[plutonium-239]]. Uranium ore concentrates are considered to be a "source material", although these are not subject to safeguards under the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/nvs-3-cd/PDF/NVS3_scr.pdf IAEA Safeguards Glossary, sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.5]&lt;/ref&gt;

Different countries may use different terminology: in the [[United States of America]], "nuclear material" most commonly refers to "[[special nuclear material]]s" (SNM), with the potential to be made into [[nuclear weapon]]s as defined in the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1954]]. The "special nuclear materials" are also plutonium-239, uranium-233, and enriched uranium (U-235).

Note that the 1980 [[Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material]] definition of nuclear material does not include thorium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Infcircs/Others/inf274r1.shtml Convention text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213062700/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Infcircs/Others/inf274r1.shtml |date=2008-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

|quote=[quoting Fouad Zakariyya ("a secular democratic thinker")]`A specific type of Islam has been gathering momentum of late, and the appropriate name that applies to it is `Petro-Islam.` The first and last goal of `Petro-Islam` has been to protect the petroleum wealth or, more correctly, the types of social relations underlying those [tribal] societies that possess the lion's share of this wealth. It is common knowledge that the principle of the `few dominating the largest portion of this wealth` permeates the social structure [of the Gulf region]. ... these petro-Islamites are exploiting the religious sensitivities of the masses for the purpose of `spreading a unique brand of Islam never seen before in history; the Islam of the veil, beard, and the Jilbab; the Islam that permits the stoppage of work during prayers' time, and prohibits women from driving automobiles.`

==Usage and definitions==
The use of the term to refer to "Wahhabism" (the dominant interpretation of Islam in Saudi Arabia) is widespread but not universal. Variations on, or different uses of, the term include:
*Use of resources by Saudi Arabia "to project itself as a major player in the Muslim world". The distribution of large sums of money from public and private sources in Saudi Arabia to advance Wahhabi doctrines and pursue the Saudi Arabian foreign policy.&lt;ref name=Hussain&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hussain|first=Hamid|title=Politicization of Islam or Islamization of Politics: Saudi Arabian Experiment|journal=Defense Journal of Pakistan|date=September 2004|volume=8|issue=2|page=104|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IKjfAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22hamid+hussain%22+petro-islam%22&amp;dq=%22hamid+hussain%22+petro-islam%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=m4NaU66pJY2ayQGWkYCgDQ&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA&amp;surl=1|quote=Saudis have used their resources; mainly cash to project itself as a major player in Muslim world.

* Attempts by the Saudi rulers to use both Islam and its wealth to win the loyalty of the [[Muslim world]].&lt;ref name=Abu-Rabi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mackey-quote/&gt;

*A "hugely successful" enterprise made up of a "colossal ensemble" of media and other cultural organs that has broken the "[[secular]]ist and [[nationalist]]" monopoly of the state on culture, media and, "to a lesser extent", education; and is supported by both Islamists and socially conservative business "elements", who opposed the [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalist]] ideologies of [[Nasserism]] and [[Baathism]].&lt;ref name="ʻAẓmah"&gt;{{cite book|last=ʻAẓmah|first=ʻAzīz|title=Islams and Modernities|year=1993|publisher=Verso|page=32|quote=Islamic discourse ... started in the 1950s and 1960s, as a local Arab purveyance of the Truman Doctrine, and was sustained initially by Egyptian and Syrian Islamists -- both earnest ones, and socially conservative, pro-Saudi business and other elements opposed to Nasserism and Baathism. This was indeed the first great cultural and ideological enterprise of Petro-Islam, along with ideas of pan-Islamism as a force counterbalancing Arab nationalism, and Islamic authenticity combating `alien` ideologies. &lt;BR&gt;The Petro-Islamic enterprises has been hugely successful, especially with the substantial influx of the Arab intelligentsia to the relatively backward countries of the Arabian Peninsula, and the colossal ensemble of mediatic and other cultural organs that Petro-Islam has built up, and with which, most importantly, it has broken the secularist and nationalist cultural, mediatic and, to a lesser extent, the educational monopoly of the modern Arab state.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*More conservative Islamic cultural practices ([[Gender segregation and Islam|separation of the sexes]], [[hijab]] or more complete hijab) brought back (to Egypt) from Gulf oil states by migrant workers.&lt;ref name=Sengers&gt;{{cite book|last=Sengers|first=Gerda|title=Women and Demons: Cultic Healing in Islamic Egypt|publisher=Brill|year=2002|page=240|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ypbI7LHzv3MC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;dq=%22petro-islam%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YGxaU_HuO-OiyAGKkYHgBw&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwADge#v=onepage&amp;q=%22petro-islam%22&amp;f=false|quote=Migration can also have other consequences for the lives of women.

In Egypt this is mockingly called `petro-Islam`.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*A term used by secularists, particularly in Egypt, to refer to efforts to require the enforcement of [[sharia]] (Islamic law).&lt;ref name=Monshipouri&gt;{{cite book|last=Monshipouri|first=Mahmood|title=Muslims in Global Politics: Identities, Interests, and Human Rights|page=86|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aWErJvWJlbcC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=%22petro-islam%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=C2taU7qNM4WMyQG8uICIBw&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22petro-islam%22&amp;f=false|quote=The shari'a has been the primary target of attacks by the secularists [in Egypt].

Clerics looked to their different schools of [[fiqh]] (the four [[Sunni]] [[Madhhab]]s: [[Hanafi]]  in the Turkish zones of South Asia, [[Maliki]] in Africa, [[Shafi'i]] in Southeast Asia, plus Shi'a [[Ja'fari jurisprudence|Ja'fari]], and "held Saudi inspired puritanism" (using another school of fiqh, [[Hanbali]]) in "great suspicion on account of its sectarian character," according to Gilles Kepel.

|quote=Prior to 1973, Islam was everywhere dominated by national or local traditions rooted in the piety of the common people, with clerics from the different schools of Sunni religious law established in all major regions of the Muslim world (Hanafite in the Turkish zones of South Asia, Malakite in Africa, Shafeite in Southeast Asia), along with their Shiite counterparts. This motley establishment held Saudi inspired puritanism in great suspicion on account of its sectarian character. But after 1973, the oil-rich Wahhabites found themselves in a different economic position, being able to mount a wide-ranging campaign of proselytizing among the Sunnis. (The Shiites, whom the Sunnis  considered heretics, remained outside the movement.) The objective was to bring Islam to the forefront of the international scene, to substitute it for the various discredited nationalist movements, and to refine the multitude of voices within the religion down to  the single creed of the masters of Mecca. The Saudis' zeal now embraced the entire world ... [and in the West] immigrant Muslim  populations were their special target." 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the 1973 War (also called the Yom Kippur War) was started by Egypt and Syria to take back land won by Israel in 1967, the "real victors" of the war were the Arab "oil-exporting countries", (according to Gilles Kepel), whose [[1973 oil crisis|embargo]] against Israel's western allies stopped Israel's counter offensive.&lt;ref name=kepel-69/&gt;

The embargo's political success enhanced the prestige of the embargo-ers and the reduction in the global supply of oil sent oil prices soaring (from US$3 per [[barrel (unit)|barrel]] to nearly $12&lt;ref name=cbc&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/oil/|title=The price of oil – in context|accessdate=May 29, 2007 | work=CBC News| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070609145246/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/oil/| archivedate= June 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and with them, oil exporter revenues. This put Muslim oil exporting states in a "clear position of dominance within the Muslim world". The most dominant was Saudi Arabia, the  largest exporter by far (see bar chart).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kepel|first=Gilles|title=Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam|year=2006|publisher=I.B.

This show of international power, along with the nation's astronomical increase in wealth, allowed Saudi Arabia's puritanical, conservative Wahhabite faction to attain a preeminent position of strength in the global expression of Islam. Saudi Arabia's impact on Muslims throughout the world was less visible than that of Khomeini's Iran, but the effect was deeper and more enduring.  The kingdom seized the initiative from progressive nationalism, which had dominated the 1960s, it reorganized the religious landscape by promoting those associations and ulemas who followed its lead, and then, by injecting substantial amounts of money into Islamic interests of all sorts, it won over many more converts. Above all, the Saudis raised a new standard -- the virtuous Islamic civilization -- as a foil for the corrupting influence of the West ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kepel-69&gt;

Saudi Arabians viewed their oil wealth not as an accident of geology or history, but connected to religion—a blessing by God of them, to "be solemnly acknowledged and lived up to" with pious behavior.&lt;ref name=Ayubi&gt;{{cite book|last=Ayubi|first=Nazih N.|title=Over-stating the Arab State: Politics and Society in the Middle East|publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YkYBAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA233&amp;dq=%22petro-islam%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jU0vU_PLO-XEyQHHz4CwAg&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22petro-islam%22&amp;f=false|page=232|quote=The ideology of such regimes has been pejoratively labelled by some `petro-Islam.` This is mainly the ideology of Saudi Arabia but it is also echoed to one degree or another in most of the smaller Gulf countries.

By becoming the managers of a huge empire of charity and good works, the Saudi government sought to legitimize a prosperity it claimed was manna from heaven, blessing the peninsula where the Prophet Mohammed had received his Revelation. Thus, an otherwise fragile Saudi monarchy buttressed its power by projecting its obedient and charitable dimension internationally.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sayeed&gt;Gilles Kepel and Nazih N. Ayubi both use the term Petro-Islam, but others subscribe to this view as well, example: {{cite book|last=Sayeed|first=Khalid B.|title=Western Dominance and Political Islam: Challenge and Response|year=1995|publisher=SUNY Press|page=95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p-ACeRAH5J0C&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=%22oil+wealth+that+was+in+saudi+arabia+was+a+gift+of+god%22+Khalid+B.+Sayeed&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3pw9U8eBPIGGyAHvkIDIDg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22oil%20wealth%20that%20was%20in%20saudi%20arabia%20was%20a%20gift%20of%20god%22%20Khalid%20B.%20Sayeed&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With its new wealth the rulers of Saudi Arabia sought to replace nationalist movements in the Muslim world with Islam, to bring Islam "to the forefront of the international scene",  and to unify Islam worldwide under the "single creed" of Wahhabism, paying particular attention to Muslims who had immigrated to the West (a  "special target")."&lt;ref name=kepel-70/&gt;

==Influence of "Petro-dollars"==

According to scholar [[Gilles Kepel]], (who devoted a chapter of his book ''[[Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam|Jihad]]'' to the subject -- "Building Petro-Islam on the Ruins of Arab Nationalism"),&lt;ref name=Kepel73/&gt; in the years immediately after the [[Yom Kippur War|1973 War]], `petro-Islam` was a "sort of nickname" for a "constituency" of Wahhabi preachers and Muslim intellectuals who promoted "strict implementation of the [[sharia]] [Islamic law] in the political, moral and cultural spheres".&lt;ref name=Kepel51/&gt;

In the coming decades, Saudi Arabia's interpretation of Islam became influential (according to Kepel) through 
*the spread of Wahhabi religious doctrines via Saudi charities; an
*increased migration of Muslims to work in Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf states; and 
*a shift in the balance of power among Muslim states toward the oil-producing countries.&lt;ref name=Kepel73&gt;{{cite book|last=Kepel|first=Gilles|title=Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam|year=2006|publisher=I.B.

Author Sandra Mackey describes the [[Petrodollar recycling|use of petrodollars]] on facilities for the [[hajj]]—for example leveling hill peaks to make room for tents, providing electricity for tents and cooling pilgrims with ice and air conditioning—as part of "Petro-Islam", which she describes as a way of building the Muslim faithful's loyalty toward the Saudi government.&lt;ref name=Mackey-quote&gt;{{cite book|last=Mackey|first=Sandra|title=The Saudis: Inside the Desert Kingdom|origyear=1987|year=2002|publisher=W.W.Norton|page=327|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BsGD6Dao_AgC&amp;pg=PA327&amp;dq=petro-islam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KPU6U4aqB8a9yAGUpYD4AQ&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=petro-islam&amp;f=false|quote=The House of Saud believed that by coupling its image as the champion of Islam with its vast financial resources, petro-Islam could mobilize the approximately six hundred million Moslem faithful worldwide to defend Saudi Arabia against the real and perceived threats to its security and its rulers.

The House of Saud has embraced the hajj ... as a major symbol of the kingdom's commitment to the Islamic world. ... These `guest of God` are the beneficiaries of the enormous sums of money and effort that Saudi Arabia expends on polishing it image among the faithful. ... brought in heavy earth-moving equipment to level millions of square meters of hill peaks to accommodate pilgrims' tents, which were then equipped with electricity. One year the ministry had copious amounts of costly ice carted from Mecca to wherever the white-robed hajjis were performing their religious rites.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kepel-hegem&gt;Kepel describes Saudi control of the two holy cities as "an essential instrument of hegemony over Islam".

Imtiyaz Ahmed, a religious scholar and professor of International Relations at [[University of Dhaka]] sees changes in religious practices in Bangladesh as linked to Saudi Arabia's efforts to promote Wahhabism through the financial help it provides countries like Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=dw-hijab&gt;{{cite news|title='Petro-Islam' on the rise in Bangladesh|url=http://www.dw.de/petro-islam-on-the-rise-in-bangladesh/a-6552859-1|accessdate=23 March 2014|newspaper=DW|date=2011-06-20|quote="Many women have started wearing black Middle Eastern burqas, as it makes them feel 'safer'.

"Saudi Arabia is giving oil, Saudi Arabia would definitely want that some of their ideas to come with oil."

====Mosques====

More than 1,500 mosques were built around the world from 1975 to 2000 paid for by Saudi public funds.
The Saudi-headquartered and financed [[Muslim World League]] played a pioneering role in supporting Islamic associations, mosques, and investment plans for the future. It opened offices in "every area of the world where Muslims lived."&lt;ref name=Kepel-WML/&gt;   The process of financing mosques usually involved presenting a local office of the Muslim World League with evidence of the need for a mosque/Islamic center to obtain the offices 'recommendation' (''tazkiya'') to "a generous donor within the kingdom or one of the emirates".&lt;ref name=Kepel-WML-73&gt;{{cite book

They would then seek a `recommendation` (tazkiya) from the local office of the Muslim World League to a generous donor within the kingdom or one of the emirates. This procedure was much criticised over the years ... The Saudi leadership's hope was that these new mosques would produce new sympathizers for the Wahhabite persuasion.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saudi-financed mosques were generally built using marble 'international style' design and green neon lighting, in a break with most local Islamic architectural traditions, but following Wahhabi ones.&lt;ref name=Kepel-72/&gt;

===Islamic banking===
{{Main|Islamic banking}}
One mechanism for the redistribution of (some) oil revenues from Saudi Arabia and other Muslim oil-exporters, to the poorer Muslim nations of African and Asia, was the [[Islamic Development Bank]]. Headquartered in Saudi Arabia, it opened for business in 1975. Its lenders and borrowers were member states of [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] (OIC) and it strengthened "Islamic cohesion" between them.

Saudi Arabians also helped establish Islamic banks with private investors and depositors.  [[DMI Trust|DMI]] (Dar al-Mal al-Islami: the House of Islamic Finance), founded in 1981 by Prince [[Mohammed bin Faisal Al Saud]],&lt;ref&gt;son of the assassinated King Faisal&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Dallah Al-Baraka|Al Baraka group]], established in 1982 by Sheik [[Saleh Abdullah Kamel]] (a Saudi billionaire), were both transnational holding companies.&lt;ref name=Kepel-79&gt;{{cite book

===Migration===

By 1975, over one million workers—from unskilled country people to experienced professors from [[Sudan]], [[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Southeast Asia]], [[Egypt]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Syria]]—had moved the [[Saudi Arabia]] and the [[Persian Gulf]] states to work and returned after a few years with savings. A majority of these workers were Arab and most were Muslim. Ten years later the number had increased to 5.15 million and Arabs were no longer in the majority. 43% (mostly [[Muslim]]s) came from the [[South Asia]]. In one country, [[Pakistan]], in a single year, (1983),&lt;ref name=kepel-71-stats/&gt;

Muslims who had moved to Saudi Arabia, or other "oil-rich monarchies of the peninsula" to work, often returned to their poor home country following religious practice more intensely, particularly practices of Wahhabi Muslims. 
Having "grown rich in this Wahhabi milieu" it was not surprising that the returning Muslims believed there was a connection between that milieu and "their material prosperity", and that on return they followed religious practices more intensely and that those practices followed Wahhabi tenants.&lt;ref name=Kepel-71&gt;{{cite book

This break with the local Islamic architectural traditions illustrates how Wahhabite doctrine achieved an international dimension in Muslim cities.

===State leadership===

In the 1950s and 1960s [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Gamal Abdul-Nasser]], the leading exponent of Arab nationalism and the president of the Arab world's largest country had great prestige and popularity.
 
However, in 1967 Nasser led the [[Six-Day War]] against Israel which ended not in the elimination of Israel but in the decisive defeat of the Arab forces&lt;ref name=kepel-63/&gt; and loss of a substantial chunk of Egyptian territory. This defeat, combined with the economic stagnation from which Egypt suffered, were contrasted with  the perceived victory of the [[Yom Kippur War|October 1973 war]] whose pious battle cry of ''[[Takbir|Allahu Akbar]]''  replaced `Land! Sea! Air!` slogan of the 1967 war,&lt;ref name=kepel-63&gt;

However it was interpreted, the 1967 defeat seriously undermined the ideological edifice of nationalism and created a vacuum to be filled a few years later by Qutb's Islamist philosophy, which until then had been confined to small circles of Muslim Brothers, prisoners, ..."

==Criticism==
At least one observer—''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine's investigative journalist [[Seymour Hersh]]—has suggested that petro-Islam is being spread by those whose motivations are less than earnest/pious.&lt;ref&gt;(writing in the New Yorker magazine and quoted by Indian lawyer Menaka Guruswamy, in an article in ''The Hindu'' newspaper which in turn was quoted by BBC Monitoring South Asia)&lt;/ref&gt; Petro-Islam funding following the [[Gulf War]], according to Hersh, "amounts to [[Protection racket|protection money]]" from the Saudi regime "to fundamentalist groups that wish to overthrow it."&lt;ref name=Guruswamy&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guruswamy|first=Menaka|title=Financing terror: the Lashkar and beyond|journal=The Hindu|date=December 5, 2008|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/financing-terror-the-lashkar-and-beyond/article1388901.ece|quote=[Menaka Guruswamy, in an article "Financing Terror: the Lashkar and Beyond", published by Indian newspaper ''The Hindu'', and quoted by BBC Monitoring South Asia [London] 05 Dec 2008.] According to The New Yorker's investigative journalist Seymour Hersh, the Saudi regime is "increasingly corrupt, alienated from the country's religious rank and file, and so weakened and frightened that it has brokered its future by channeling hundreds of millions of dollars in what amounts to protection money to fundamentalist groups that wish to overthrow it." This is a practice that has been referred to as "Petro-Islam." |accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egyptian [[ existentialism|existentialist]] [[Fouad Zakariyya]] has accused purveyors of Petro-Islam as having as their objective the protection of the oil wealth and "social relations" of the "tribal societies that possess the lion's share of this wealth", at the expense of the long term development of the region and the majority of its people.&lt;ref&gt;(note: link has been messed with to prevent blocking) {{cite journal|last=Zaidi|first=Syed Manzar Abbas|title=Tribalism, Islamism, Leadership and the Assabiyyas|journal=Journal for the Study of Religions and Ideologies|date=Spring 2010|volume=9|issue=25|pages=133-154 (145-6)|url=http://www.go.ogle.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CDYQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fjsri.ro%2Fnew%2F%3Fdownload%3D25_Syed_Manzar_Abbas_Zaidi.pdf&amp;ei=UOJPU8bgGpKiyAS_toCIBA&amp;usg=AFQjCNFeSF_1v4plrGdeMzP4AQbLOsMLBA&amp;sig2=Jm9Yg-cqnqZELFeUSQFm3w&amp;bvm=bv.64764171,d.aWw|accessdate=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further states that it is a "brand of Islam" that bills itself as "pure" but rather than being the Islam of the early Muslims has  "never" been "seen before in history".&lt;ref name=Abu-Rabi/&gt;

They argue that in Egypt, Sudan and Jordan, "Islamic movements have demonstrated a high level of autonomy from their original patrons." The strength and growth of [[Muslim Brotherhood]], and other forces of conservative political Islam in Egypt can be explained (Beinin and Stork believe), by internal forces—the historical strength of the Muslim Brotherhood, sympathy for the "martyred" [[Sayyid Qutb]], anger with the "autocratic tendencies" and  failed promises of prosperity of the [[History of Egypt under Anwar Sadat|Sadat government]].&lt;ref name=Beinin-Stork&gt;{{cite book|editors=Joel Beinin, Joe Stork|title=Political Islam: Essays from Middle East Report|year=1997|publisher=I.B.Tauris|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fblv_CWayasC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=%22petro-islam%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jU0vU_PLO-XEyQHHz4CwAg&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22petro-islam%22&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Magnetic confinement fusion|Magnetically confined]] fusion [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]s such as those generated in [[tokamak]]s and [[stellarator]]s are characterized by a typical shape. '''Plasma shaping''' is the study of the plasma shape in such devices, and is particularly important for next step fusion devices such as [[ITER]]. This shape is conditioning partly the performance of the plasma. Tokamaks, in particular,  are [[axisymmetric]] devices, and therefore one can completely define the shape of the plasma by its [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-section]].

==History==
Early fusion reactor designs tended to have circular cross-sections simply because they were easy to design and understand. Generally, fusion machines using a toroidal layout, like the [[tokamak]] and most [[stellarator]]s, arrange their magnetic fields so the ions and electrons in the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] travel around the torus at high velocities. However, as the circumference of a path on the outside of the plasma area is longer than one on the inside, this caused several effects that disrupted the stability of the plasma.

During the 1960s a number of different methods were used to try to address these problems. Generally they used a combination of several magnetic fields to cause the net magnetic field inside the device to be twisted into a helix. Ions and electrons following these lines found themselves moving to the inside and then outside of the plasma, mixing it and suppressing some of the most obvious instabilities.

In the 1980s, further research along these lines demonstrated that further advances were possible by using external current-carrying coils to make the lines not just helical, but non-symmetric as well. This led to a series of experiments using C and D-shaped plasma volumes.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}.

By increasing the current in one (or more) shaping coils to a high enough degree, one (or more) 'X-points' can be created.  An X-point is defined as a point in space at which the poloidal field has zero magnitude.  The magnetic flux surface that intersects with the X-point is called the separatrix, and, as all flux surfaces external to this surface are unconfined, the separatrix defines the last closed flux surface (LCFS).  Formerly, the LCFS was established by inserting a material limiter into the plasma, which fixed the plasma temperature and potential (among other quantities) to be equal to that of the limiter.  Plasma that escaped the LCFS would do so with no preferential direction, potentially damaging instruments.  By establishing an X-point and separatrix, the plasma edge is uncoupled from the vessel walls, and exhausted heat and plasma particles are preferentially diverted towards a known region of the vessel near the X-point.

==Cross-section==
In the simple case of a plasma with up-down symmetry, the plasma cross-section is defined using a combination of four parameters:{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}
* the plasma '''elongation''', &lt;math&gt;\kappa={b \over a}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the plasma minor radius, and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is the height of the plasma measured from the [[equatorial plane]],
* the plasma '''triangularity''', &lt;math&gt;\delta &lt;/math&gt;, defined as the horizontal distance between the plasma major radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and the X point,
* the angle between the horizontal and the plasma [[last closed flux surface]] (LCFS) at the low field side,
* the angle between the horizontal and the plasma last closed flux surface (LCFS) at the high field side.

In general (no up-down symmetry), there can be an upper-triangularity, and a lower-triangularity.&lt;ref name=WFT&gt;[http://fusionwiki.ciemat.es/wiki/Triangularity Triangularity]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tokamaks can have negative triangularity.&lt;ref name=NT&gt;[http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0029-5515/55/6/063013 The negative triangularity tokamak: stability limits and prospects as a fusion energy system]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Medvedev&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276429151_The_negative_triangularity_tokamak_Stability_limits_and_prospects_as_a_fusion_energy_system The negative triangularity tokamak: Stability limits and prospects as a fusion energy system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="59890">A '''quartz crystal microbalance''' ('''QCM''') measures a mass variation per unit area by measuring the change in [[frequency]] of a [[quartz crystal]] resonator.  The [[resonance]] is disturbed by the addition or removal of a small mass due to oxide growth/decay or film deposition at the surface of the acoustic resonator. The QCM can be used under vacuum, in gas [[phase (matter)|phase]] ("gas sensor", first use described by King&lt;ref name=king64&gt;{{cite journal | author= W.H. King, Jr.| title = Piezoelectric sorption detector | journal = Analytical Chemistry|issue=9|pages=1735––1739|year= 1964|volume= 36 | doi= 10.1021/ac60215a012}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and more recently in liquid environments. It is useful for monitoring the rate of deposition in [[Thin-film deposition|thin film deposition]] systems under vacuum. In liquid, it is highly effective at determining the [[chemical affinity|affinity]] of molecules ([[protein]]s, in particular) to surfaces functionalized with recognition sites.  Larger entities such as [[virus]]es or [[polymer]]s are investigated, as well.  QCM has also been used to investigate interactions between biomolecules. Frequency measurements are easily made to high precision (discussed below); hence, it is easy to measure mass densities down to a level of below 1 μg/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In addition to measuring the frequency, the [[dissipation]] factor (equivalent to the resonance bandwidth) is often measured to help analysis. The dissipation factor is the inverse quality factor of the resonance, Q&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = w/f&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; (see below); it quantifies the [[damping]] in the system and is related to the sample's [[Viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] properties.

== General ==
[[Quartz]] is one member of a family of [[crystals]] that experience the [[Piezoelectricity|piezoelectric effect]]. The piezoelectric effect has found applications in high power sources, sensors, actuators, frequency standards, motors, etc., and the relationship between applied [[voltage]] and mechanical deformation is well known; this allows probing an acoustic resonance by electrical means.  Applying alternating current to the quartz crystal will induce oscillations. With an alternating current between the electrodes of a properly cut crystal, a standing [[shear wave]] is generated.  The [[Q factor]], which is the ratio of frequency and [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], can be as high as 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.  Such a narrow resonance leads to highly stable oscillators and a high accuracy in the determination of the resonance frequency.  The QCM exploits this ease and precision for sensing. Common equipment allows resolution down to 1&amp;nbsp;Hz on crystals with a fundamental [[resonant frequency]] in the 4 – 6&amp;nbsp;MHz range.  A typical setup for the QCM contains water cooling tubes, the retaining unit, frequency sensing equipment through a microdot feed-through, an oscillation source, and a measurement and recording device.

The frequency of oscillation of the quartz crystal is partially dependent on the thickness of the crystal. During normal operation, all the other influencing variables remain constant; thus a change in thickness correlates directly to a change in frequency. As mass is deposited on the surface of the crystal, the thickness increases; consequently the frequency of oscillation decreases from the initial value. With some simplifying assumptions, this frequency change can be quantified and correlated precisely to the mass change using the [[Sauerbrey equation]].&lt;ref name=sauerbrey&gt;{{cite journal | author =  G. Sauerbrey | title = Verwendung von Schwingquarzen zur Wägung dünner Schichten und zur Mikrowägung| journal =  Z.

Other techniques for measuring the properties of thin films include [[ellipsometry]], [[surface plasmon resonance]] (SPR) [[spectroscopy]], [[Multi-Parametric Surface Plasmon Resonance]] and [[dual polarisation interferometry]].

== Gravimetric and non-gravimetric QCM ==
The classical sensing application of quartz crystal resonators is microgravimetry.&lt;ref name=lu&gt;{{cite book | editor =  C. Lu, A. W.

These devices exploit the Sauerbrey relation.&lt;ref name=sauerbrey /&gt; For thin films, the resonance frequency is usually inversely proportional to the total thickness of the plate.  The latter increases when a film is deposited onto the crystal surface.  [[Monolayer]] sensitivity is easily reached.  However, when the film thickness increases, viscoelastic effects come into play.&lt;ref name=lu1972&gt;{{cite journal |author1=C.S. Lu  |author2=O.

Today, microweighing is one of several uses of the QCM.&lt;ref name=PCCP&gt;{{cite journal | author=  D. Johannsmann|title=Viscoelastic, mechanical, and dielectric measurements on complex samples with the quartz crystal microbalance| journal =  Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics|pages= 4516–34|year=2008 | volume = 10 | doi=  10.1039/b803960g | pmid=  18665301 | issue=  31|bibcode = 2008PCCP...10.4516J }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Measurements of [[viscosity]] and more general, viscoelastic properties, are of much importance as well.  The “non-gravimetric” QCM is by no means an alternative to the conventional QCM.  Many researchers, who use quartz resonators for purposes other than gravimetry, have continued to call the quartz crystal resonator “QCM”.  Actually, the term "balance" makes sense even for non-gravimetric applications if it is understood in the sense of a [[force]] balance.  At resonance, the force exerted upon the crystal by the sample is balanced by a force originating from the shear gradient inside the crystal.  This is the essence of the small-load approximation.
  
Crystalline α–quartz is by far the most important material for thickness-shear resonators.  [[Lanthanum gallium silicate|Langasite]] (La&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;, “LGS”) and [[Gallium phosphate|
gallium-orthophosphate]] (GaPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) are investigated as alternatives to quartz, mainly (but not only) for use at high temperatures.&lt;ref name=fritze&gt;{{cite journal |author1=H.

== Surface acoustic wave-based sensors ==
The QCM is a member of a wider class of sensing instruments based on acoustic waves at surfaces.  Instruments sharing similar principles of operation are shear horizontal [[surface acoustic wave]] (SH-SAW) devices,&lt;ref name=martin&gt;{{cite journal |author1=F. Martin |author2=M.I.

(Some acoustic sensors for temperature or pressure make use of the fact that the speed of sound inside the crystal depends on temperature, pressure, or bending.  These sensors do not exploit surface effects.)  In the context of surface-acoustic wave based sensing, the QCM is also termed “bulk acoustic wave resonator (BAW-resonator)” or “thickness-shear resonator”.  The displacement pattern of an unloaded BAW resonator is a standing shear wave with [[node (physics)|anti-nodes]] at the crystal surface.  This makes the analysis particularly easy and transparent.

== Instrumental ==

=== Resonator crystals ===
[[Image:quartz resonators with front and back electrodes.jpg|thumb|400px|Photograph of typical quartz crystal resonators as used for QCM, metallised with gold electrodes (left: front electrode, right: back electrode) by vapor deposition.]]

When the QCM was first developed, natural quartz was harvested, selected for its quality and then cut in the [[laboratory|lab]].  However, most of today’s crystals are grown using [[seed crystal]]s.  A seed crystal serves as an anchoring point and template for crystal growth.  Grown crystals are subsequently cut and polished into hair-thin discs which support thickness shear resonance in the 1-30&amp;nbsp;MHz range.   The "AT" or "SC" oriented cuts (discussed below) are widely used in applications.&lt;ref name=techcrystal&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electromechanical coupling ===
The QCM consists of a thin piezoelectric plate with electrodes evaporated onto both sides.  Due to the piezo-effect, an AC voltage across the electrodes induces a shear deformation and vice versa.  The electromechanical coupling provides a simple way to detect an acoustic resonance by electrical means.  Otherwise, it is of minor importance.  However, electromechanical coupling can have a slight influence on the resonance frequency via piezoelectric stiffening.  This effect can be used for sensing,&lt;ref name=zhang&gt;{{cite journal |author1=C. Zhang  |author2=J.F. Vetelino |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Chemical sensors based on electrically sensitive quartz resonators| journal = Sens. Actuators B|page= 320|year=2003|volume= 91 | doi=  10.1016/S0925-4005(03)00094-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is usually avoided.  It is essential to have the electric and [[dielectric]] boundary conditions well under control.  Grounding the front electrode (the electrode in contact with the sample) is one option.  A π-network sometimes is employed for the same reason.&lt;ref name=iec&gt;IEC standard 60444-1&lt;/ref&gt; A π-network is an arrangement of [[resistor]]s, which almost [[short circuit|short-circuit]] the two electrodes.  This makes the device less susceptible to electrical perturbations.

=== Shear waves decay in liquids and gases ===
Most acoustic-wave-based sensors employ shear (transverse) waves.  Shear waves decay rapidly in liquid and gaseous environments.  [[longitudinal wave|Compressional (longitudinal) waves]] would be radiated into the bulk and potentially be reflected back to the crystal from the opposing cell wall.&lt;ref name=lin&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Z.X. Lin  |author2=M.D. Ward |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Role of Longitudinal Waves in Quartz Crystal Microbalance Applications in Liquids| journal = Anal. Chem.|page= 685|year=1995|volume= 67 | doi=  10.1021/ac00100a001 | issue=  4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eggers&gt;{{cite journal |author1=F. Eggers  |author2=Th. Funck |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Method for measurement of shear-wave impedance in the MHz region for liquid samples of approximately 1 ml|journal = J. Phys. E: Sci. Instrum.|page= 523|year=1987|volume= 20 | doi=  10.1088/0022-3735/20/5/011|bibcode = 1987JPhE...20..523E | issue=  5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such reflections are avoided with transverse waves.  The range of penetration of a 5&amp;nbsp;MHz-shear wave in water is 250&amp;nbsp;nm.  This finite penetration depth renders the QCM surface-specific.   Also, liquids and gases have a rather small shear-acoustic impedance and therefore only weakly damp the oscillation.  The exceptionally high Q-factors of acoustic resonators are linked to their weak coupling to the environment.

=== Modes of operation ===
Economic ways of driving a QCM make use of oscillator circuits.&lt;ref name=horowitz&gt;{{cite book |author1=P. Horowitz  |author2=W. Hill |lastauthoramp=yes |title= The Art of Electronics|edition = 2|publisher= Cambridge University Press|place= New York|year= 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=arnau2002&gt;{{cite journal |author1=A.

Other modes of operation are impedance analysis,&lt;ref name=beck&gt;{{cite journal |author1=R. Beck, U. Pittermann  |author2=K.G. Weil |lastauthoramp=yes |title=| journal = Ber. Bunsen-Ges. Phys.

In impedance analysis, the [[electrical conductance|electric conductance]] as a function of driving frequency is determined by means of a [[network analyzer (electrical)|network analyzer]].  By fitting a resonance curve to the conductance curve, one obtains the frequency and bandwidth of the resonance as fit parameters.  In ring-down, one measures the voltage between the electrodes after the exciting voltage has suddenly been turned off.  The resonator emits a decaying [[sine wave]], where the resonance parameters are extracted from the period of oscillation and the decay rate.

[[Image:QCM principle.gif|framed|Impedance analysis is based on electrical conductance curve. The central parameters of measurement are the resonance frequency f&lt;sub&gt;res&lt;/sub&gt; and the bandwidth w.]]
[[Image:QCM ringdown.gif|framed|Ring-down yields the equivalent information in time-domain measurements. The dissipation factor ''D'' is equal to ''Q''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.]]

=== Energy trapping ===
The electrodes at the front and the back of the crystal usually are key-hole shaped, thereby making the resonator thicker in the center than at the rim.  This confines the displacement field to the center of the crystal by a mechanism called energy trapping.&lt;ref name=bottom&gt;{{cite journal | author=  V.E. Bottom|title=Introduction to Quartz Crystal Unit Design|publisher= Van Nostrand Reinhold|place= New York|year= 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The crystal turns into an acoustic lens and the wave is focused to the center of the crystal.  Energy trapping is necessary in order to be able to mount the crystal at the edge without excessive damping.  Energy trapping slightly distorts the otherwise planar wave fronts.  The deviation from the plane thickness-shear mode entails flexural contribution to the displacement pattern.  Flexural waves emit compressional waves into the adjacent medium, which is a problem when operating the crystal in a liquid environment.

=== Overtones ===
Planar resonators can be operated at a number of [[overtone]]s, typically indexed by the number of nodal planes parallel to the crystal surfaces.  Only odd [[harmonic]]s can be excited electrically because only these induce charges of opposite sign at the two crystal surfaces.  Overtones are to be distinguished from anharmonic side bands (spurious modes), which have nodal planes perpendicular to the plane of the resonator.  The best agreement between theory and experiment is reached with planar, optically polished crystals for overtone orders between ''n'' = 5 and ''n'' = 13.  On low harmonics, energy trapping is insufficient, while on high harmonics, anharmonic side bands interfere with the main resonance.&lt;ref name=goka&gt;{{cite journal |author1=S. Goka |author2=K. Okabe |author3=Y. Watanabe |author4=H. Sekimoto |title=Multimode Quartz Crystal Microbalance| journal = Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. PART 1|page= 3073|year=2000|volume= 39 | doi=  10.1143/JJAP.39.3073|bibcode = 2000JaJAP..39.3073G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Amplitude of motion ===
The [[amplitude]] of lateral displacement rarely exceeds a nanometer.  More specifically one has

&lt;math&gt;u_0=\frac 4{\left( n\pi \right) ^2}dQU_{\mathrm{el}}
&lt;/math&gt;

with ''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; the amplitude of lateral displacement, ''n'' the overtone order, ''d'' the piezoelectric strain coefficient, ''Q'' the quality factor, and ''U''&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt; the amplitude of electrical driving.  The piezoelectric strain coefficient is given as ''d''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3.1·10&lt;sup&gt;‑12&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m/V for AT-cut quartz crystals.  Due to the small amplitude, [[Stress (physics)|stress]] and [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] usually are proportional to each other.  The QCM operates in the range of linear acoustics.

=== Effects of temperature and stress ===
The resonance frequency of acoustic resonators depends on temperature, pressure, and bending stress.  Temperature-frequency coupling is minimized by employing special crystal cuts.  A widely used temperature-compensated cut of quartz is the AT-cut.  Careful control of temperature and stress is essential in the operation of the QCM.

AT-cut crystals are singularly rotated Y-axis cuts in which the top and bottom half of the crystal move in opposite directions (thickness shear vibration)&lt;ref name=epsontoyocom&gt;{{cite web|title=Who needs crystal devices |url=http://www.epsontoyocom.co.jp/english/special/crystal/timing_04.html |accessdate=2007-05-30 |date=2007-03-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718103339/http://www.epsontoyocom.co.jp/english/special/crystal/timing_04.html |archivedate=2007-07-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=icmfg&gt;{{cite web |title=Quartz crystal FAQs from International Crystal|url= http://www.icmfg.com/crystalfaqs.html#q4|accessdate=2007-05-30|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; during oscillation.  
The AT-cut crystal is easily manufactured. However, it has limitations at high and low temperature, as it is easily disrupted by internal stresses caused by temperature gradients in these temperature extremes (relative to room temperature, ~25&amp;nbsp;°C).  These internal stress points produce undesirable frequency shifts in the crystal, decreasing its accuracy.  The relationship between temperature and frequency is [[cubic function|cubic]].  The cubic relationship has an [[inflection point]] near room temperature.  As a consequence the AT-cut quartz crystal is most effective when operating at or near room temperature.  For applications which are above room temperature, water cooling is often helpful.

Stress-compensated (SC) crystals are available with a doubly rotated cut that minimizes the frequency changes due to temperature gradients when the system is operating at high temperatures, and reduces the reliance on water cooling.&lt;ref name=ballato&gt;{{cite journal |author1=A. Ballato |author2=T. J. Lukaszek |author3=E. P. Eernisse  |last-author-amp=yes |title=| journal = IEEE Transactions on Sonics and Ultrasonics|page= 163|year=1979|volume= 26}}&lt;/ref&gt; SC-cut crystals have an inflection point of ~92&amp;nbsp;°C.  In addition to their high temperature inflection point, they also have a smoother cubic relationship and are less affected by temperature deviations from the inflection point.  However, due to the more difficult manufacturing process, they are more expensive and are not widely commercially available.

=== Electrochemical QCM ===
The QCM can be combined with other surface-analytical instruments.  The [[electrochemistry|electrochemical]] QCM (EQCM) is particularly advanced.&lt;ref name=schumacher&gt;{{cite journal | author=  R. Schumacher|title=The Quartz Microbalance: A Novel Approach to the In-Situ Investigation of Interfacial Phenomena at the Solid/Liquid Junction[New Analytical Methods(40)]|journal= Angew. Chem. Int.

Rev.|page= 1335|year=1992|volume= 92 | doi=  10.1021/cr00014a006 | issue=  6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using the EQCM, one determines the ratio of mass deposited at the electrode surface during an electrochemical reaction to the total charge passed through the electrode.  This ratio is called the current efficiency.

== Quantification of dissipative processes ==
For advanced QCMs, both the resonance frequency, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, and the bandwidth, ''w'', are available for analysis.  The latter quantifies processes which withdraw energy from the oscillation.  These may include damping by the holder and [[ohm's law|ohmic]] losses inside the electrode or the crystal.  In the literature some parameters other than ''w'' itself are used to quantify bandwidth.  The Q-factor (quality factor) is given by ''Q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;/''w''.  The “dissipation factor”, ''D'', is the inverse of the Q-factor: ''D''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''Q''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''w''/''f''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;.  The half-band-half-width, Γ, is Γ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''w''/2.  The use of Γ is motivated by a complex formulation of the equations governing the motion of the crystal.  A [[complex number|complex]] resonance frequency is defined as ''f''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;iΓ, where the [[imaginary part]], Γ, is half the bandwidth at half maximum.  Using a complex notation, one can treat shifts of frequency, Δ''f'', and bandwidth, ΔΓ, within the same set of (complex) equations.

The motional resistance of the resonator, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, is also used as a measure of dissipation.  ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is an output parameter of some instruments based on advanced oscillator circuits.  ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; usually is not strictly proportional to the bandwidth (although it should be according to the BvD circuit; see below).  Also, in absolute terms, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – being an electrical quantity and not a frequency – is more severely affected by [[calibration]] problems than the bandwidth.&lt;ref name="JohannsmannBook2007"&gt;{{cite book

== Equivalent circuits ==
Modeling of acoustic resonators often occurs with equivalent [[electrical circuits]].&lt;ref name=thurston&gt;{{cite book|author= R.N. Thurston|editor= C.

These representations are not just cartoons.  They are tools to predict the shift of the resonance parameters in response to the addition of the load.

Equivalent circuits build on the electromechanical [[analogy]].  In the same way as the current through a network of resistors can be predicted from their arrangement and the applied voltage, the displacement of a network of mechanical elements can be predicted from the [[topology]] of the network and the applied force.  The electro-mechanical analogy maps forces onto voltages and speeds onto currents.  The ratio of force and speed is termed “[[mechanical impedance]]”.  Note:  Here, speed means the time derivative of a displacement, not the speed of sound.  There also is an electro-acoustic analogy, within which stresses (rather than forces) are mapped onto voltages.  In acoustics, forces are normalized to area.  The ratio of stress and speed should not be called "[[acoustic impedance]]" (in analogy to the mechanical impedance) because this term is already in use for the material property ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;ac&lt;/sub&gt; = ρ''c'' with ρ the [[density]] and ''c'' the speed of sound).  The ratio of stress and speed at the crystal surface is called load impedance, ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.  Synonymous terms are "surface impedance" and "acoustic load."&lt;ref name=arnau2002 /&gt; The load impedance is in general not equal to the material constant ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;ac&lt;/sub&gt; = ρ''c'' = (''G''ρ)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;. Only for propagating plane waves are the values of ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;ac&lt;/sub&gt; the same.

The electro-mechanical analogy provides for mechanical equivalents of a resistor, an [[inductance]], and a [[capacitance]], which are the [[dashpot]] (quantified by the [[drag coefficient]], ξ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;), the point mass (quantified by the mass, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;), and the [[spring (device)|spring]] (quantified by the [[hooke's law|spring constant]], κ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;).  For a dashpot, the impedance by definition is ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;=''F'' / (d''u''/d''t'')=ξ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; with ''F'' the force and (d''u''/d''t'') the speed).  For a point mass undergoing oscillatory motion ''u''(''t'') = ''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; exp(iω''t'') we have ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; = iω''m''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;.  The spring obeys ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; =κ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;/(iω).  Piezoelectric coupling is depicted as a [[transformer]]. It is characterized by a parameter φ.  While φ is dimensionless for usual transformers (the turns ratio), it has the dimension charge/length in the case of electromechanical coupling. The transformer acts as an impedance converter in the sense that a mechanical impedance, ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, appears as an electrical impedance, ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt;, across the electrical ports. '' Z''&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt; is given by ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt; = φ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;.  For planar piezoelectric crystals, φ takes the value φ = ''Ae''/''d''&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''A'' is the effective area, ''e'' is the piezoelectric stress coefficient&lt;ref name=beck /&gt; (''e'' = 9.65·10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; C/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for AT-cut quartz) and ''d''&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; is the thickness of the plate.  The transformer often is not explicitly depicted.  Rather, the mechanical elements are directly depicted as electrical elements (capacitor replaces a spring, etc.).

There is a pitfall with the application of the electro-mechanical analogy, which has to do with how networks are drawn.  When a spring pulls onto a dashpot, one would usually draw the two elements in series.  However, when applying the electro-mechanical analogy, the two elements have to be placed in parallel.  For two parallel electrical elements the currents are additive.  Since the speeds (= currents) add when placing a spring behind a dashpot, this assembly has to be represented by a parallel network.

[[File:QCM BvD equivalent circuit.gif|framed|right|Butterworth-van-Dyke (BvD) equivalent circuit. ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the electrical (parallel) capacitance across the electrodes. ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the motional inductance (proportional to the mass). ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the motional capacitance (inversely proportional to the stiffness) and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the motional resistance (quantifying dissipative losses). ''A'' is the effective area of the crystal, ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is the load impedance, and φ converts between electrical and mechanical impedance.]]

The figure on the right shows the Butterworth-van Dyke (BvD) equivalent circuit.  The acoustic properties of the crystal are represented by the motional inductance, ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the motional capacitance, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and the motional resistance ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.  ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is the load impedance.  Note that the load, ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, cannot be determined from a single measurement.  It is inferred from the comparison of the loaded and the unloaded state.  Some authors use the BvD circuit without the load ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.  This circuit is also called “four element network”.  The values of ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; then change their value in the presence of the load (they do not if the element ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is explicitly included).

== Small-load approximation ==
The BvD circuit predicts the resonance parameters.  One can show that the following simple relation holds as long as the frequency shift is much smaller than the frequency itself:&lt;ref name="JohBook" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta f^{*}}{f_f}=\frac i{\pi Z_q}Z_L&lt;/math&gt;

''f''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is the frequency of the [[fundamental frequency|fundamental]]. ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; is the acoustic impedance of material.  For AT-cut quartz, its value is ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; = 8.8·10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; kg m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

The small-load approximation is central to the interpretation of QCM-data.  It holds for arbitrary samples and can be applied in an average sense.&lt;ref name=heteorogeneous_note&gt;Heterogeneous samples will, in general, lead to scattering of acoustic waves, which is not captured by just calculating the average stress.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=laschitsch&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A. Laschitsch  |author2=D. Johannsmann |lastauthoramp=yes |title=High frequency tribological investigations on quartz resonator surfaces|journal= J. Appl. Phys.|page= 3759|year=1999|volume= 85|doi=10.1063/1.369745|bibcode = 1999JAP....85.3759L|issue=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assume that the sample is a complex material, such as a [[cell culture]], a sand pile, a froth, an assembly of spheres or [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]], or a droplet.  If the average stress-to-speed ratio of the sample at the crystal surface (the load impedance, ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) can be calculated in one way or another,&lt;ref name=johannsmann2008&gt;{{cite journal|author1=D. Johannsmann |author2=I. Reviakine |author3=E. Rojas |author4=M. Gallego  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Effect of sample heterogeneity on the interpretation of QCM data: comparison of combined quartz crystal microbalance/atomic force microscopy measurements with finite element method modeling|journal=Analytical Chemistry|page= 8891|year=2008|volume= 80|doi=10.1021/ac8013115|pmid=18954085|issue=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; a quantitative analysis of the QCM experiment is in reach.  Otherwise, the interpretation will have to remain qualitative.

The limits of the small-load approximation are noticed either when the frequency shift is large or when the overtone-dependence of Δ''f'' and Δ(''w''/2) is analyzed in detail in order to derive the viscoelastic properties of the sample.  A more general relation is

&lt;math&gt;Z_L=-iZ_q\tan \left( \pi \frac{\Delta f}{f_f}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

This equation is [[implicit function|implicit]] in Δ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, and must be solved numerically.  Approximate solutions also exist, which go beyond the small-load approximation.  The small-load approximation is the first order solution of a [[perturbation theory|perturbation analysis]].&lt;ref name=johannsmann2001&gt;{{cite journal|author=D. Johannsmann|title=Derivation of the shear compliance of thin films on quartz resonators from comparison of the frequency shifts on different harmonics: A perturbation analysis|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|page= 6356|year=2001|volume= 89|doi=10.1063/1.1358317|bibcode = 2001JAP....89.6356J|issue=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of the load impedance implicitly assumes that stress and speed are proportional and that the ratio therefore is independent of speed.  This assumption is justified when the crystal is operated in liquids and in air.  The laws of linear acoustics then hold.  However, when the crystal is in contact with a rough surface, stress can easily become a [[nonlinear system|nonlinear function]] of strain (and speed) because the stress is transmitted across a finite number of rather small load-bearing asperities.  The stress at the points of contact is high, and phenomena like slip, partial slip, yield, etc. set in.  These are part of non-linear acoustics.  There is a generalization of the small-load equation dealing with this problem.  If the stress, σ(''t''), is periodic in time and synchronous with the crystal oscillation one has

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta f}{f_f}=\frac 1{\pi Z_q}\,\frac 2{\omega u_0}\left\langle
\sigma \left( t\right) \cos \left( \omega t\right) \right\rangle _t&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta (w/2) }{f_f}=\frac 1{\pi Z_q}\,\frac 2{\omega u_0}\left\langle
\sigma \left( t\right) \sin \left( \omega t\right) \right\rangle _t&lt;/math&gt;

Angular brackets denote a time average and σ(''t'') is the (small) stress exerted by the external surface.  The function σ(t) may or may not be harmonic.  One can always test for nonlinear behavior by checking for a dependence of the resonance parameters on the driving voltage.  If linear acoustics hold, there is no drive level-dependence.  Note, however, that quartz crystals have an intrinsic drive level-dependence, which must not be confused with nonlinear interactions between the crystal and the sample.

== Viscoelastic modeling ==

=== Assumptions ===
For a number of experimental configurations, there are explicit expressions relating the shifts of frequency and bandwidth to the sample properties.&lt;ref name=nakamoto&gt;{{cite journal|author1=T.

* The resonator and all cover layers are laterally homogeneous and infinite.
* The distortion of the crystal is given by a transverse plane wave with the [[wave vector|wave-vector]] perpendicular to the surface normal (thickness-shear mode).

* Piezoelectric stiffening may be ignored.

=== Semi-infinite viscoelastic medium ===
For a semi-infinite medium, one has&lt;ref name=mason&gt;{{cite book|author=W.P. Mason|title=Piezoelectric Crystals and their Applications to Ultrasonics|publisher= Van Nostrand|place= Princeton|year=1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kanazawa&gt;{{cite journal|author1=K.K. Kanazawa  |author2=J.G. Gordon II |lastauthoramp=yes |title=|journal= Anal. Chim. Acta|page= 175|year= 1985|volume= 99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=borovikov1976&gt;{{cite journal|author=A.P. Borovikov|title=|journal= Instruments and Experimental Techniques|page= 223|year=1976|volume= 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta f^{*}}{f_f}=\frac i{\pi Z_q}\,\frac \sigma {\dot{u}}=\frac
i{\pi Z_q}Z_{\mathrm{ac}}=\frac i{\pi Z_q}\sqrt{\rho i\omega \eta }&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=\frac 1{\pi Z_q}\,\frac{-1+i}{\sqrt{2}}\sqrt{\rho \omega
\left( \eta ^{\prime }-i\eta ^{\prime \prime }\right) }=\frac i{\pi Z_q} 
\sqrt{\rho \left( G^{\prime }+iG^{\prime \prime }\right) }&lt;/math&gt;

η’ and η’’ are the [[real part|real]] and the [[imaginary part]] of the viscosity, respectively.  ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;ac&lt;/sub&gt; = ρ''c'' =(''G'' ρ)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; is the acoustic impedance of the medium. ρ is the density, ''c'', the speed of sound, and ''G'' = i&amp;nbsp;ωη is the [[shear modulus]].
For [[newtonian fluid|Newtonian liquids]] (η’ = const, η’’ = 0), Δ''f'' and Δ(''w''/2) are equal and opposite.  They scale as the square root of the overtone order, ''n''&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;.  For viscoelastic liquids (η’ = η(ω), η’’≠ 0), the complex viscosity can be obtained as

&lt;math&gt;\eta ^{\prime }=-\frac{\pi Z_q^2}{\rho _{\mathrm{Liq}}\,f}\,\frac{\Delta
f\Delta \left( w/2\right) }{f_f^2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\eta ^{\prime \prime }=\frac 12\frac{\pi Z_q^2}{\rho _{\mathrm{Liq}}\,f}\,\frac{\left( \left( \Delta \left( w/2\right) \right) ^2-\Delta f^2\right) }{f_f^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Importantly, the QCM only probes the region close to the crystal surface.  The shear wave evanescently decays into the liquid.  In water the penetration depth is about 250&amp;nbsp;nm at 5&amp;nbsp;MHz.  Surface roughness, nano-bubbles at the surface, slip, and compressional waves can interfere with the measurement of viscosity.  Also, the viscosity determined at MHz frequencies sometimes differs from the low-frequency viscosity.  In this respect, torsional resonators&lt;ref name=stokich /&gt; (with a frequency around 100&amp;nbsp;kHz) are closer to application than thickness-shear resonators.

=== Inertial loading (Sauerbrey equation) ===
The frequency shift induced by a thin sample which is rigidly coupled to the crystal (such as a thin film), is described by the Sauerbrey equation.  The stress is governed by [[inertia]], which implies σ = -ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''m''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the amplitude of oscillation and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is the (average) mass per unit area.  Inserting this result into the small-load-approximation one finds

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta f^{*}}{f_f}\approx \frac i{\pi Z_q}\frac{-\omega ^2u_0m_{\%
\mathrm{F}}}{i\omega u_0}=-\frac{2\,f}{Z_q}m_{\mathrm{F}}&lt;/math&gt;

If the density of the film is known, one can convert from mass per unit area, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;, to thickness, ''d''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;.  The thickness thus derived is also called the Sauerbrey thickness to show that it was derived by applying the Sauerbrey equation to the frequency shift.
The shift in bandwidth is zero if the Sauerbrey equation holds.  Checking for the bandwidth therefore amounts to checking the applicability of the Sauerbrey equation.

The Sauerbrey equation was first derived by G. Sauerbrey in 1959 and correlates changes in the oscillation frequency of a piezoelectric crystal with mass deposited on it. He simultaneously developed a method for measuring the resonance frequency and its changes by using the crystal as the frequency-determining component of an oscillator circuit. His method continues to be used as the primary tool in quartz crystal microbalance experiments for conversion of frequency to mass.

Because the film is treated as an extension of thickness, Sauerbrey’s equation only applies to systems in which (a) the deposited mass has the same acoustic properties as the crystal and (b) the frequency change is small (Δ''f'' / ''f'' &amp;lt; 0.05).

If the change in frequency is greater than 5%, that is, Δ''f'' / ''f'' &amp;gt; 0.05, the Z-match method must be used to determine the change in mass.&lt;ref name=lu1972 /&gt;&lt;ref name=borovikov1976 /&gt; The formula for the Z-match method is:

&lt;math&gt;\tan \left( \frac{\pi \Delta f}{f_f}\right) =\frac{-Z_{\mathrm{F}}}{Z_q}\tan
\left( k_{\mathrm{F}}d_{\mathrm{F}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

''k''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is the wave vector inside the film and ''d''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; its thickness.  Inserting ''k''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; = 2·π·''f'' /c&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; = 2·π·''f''·ρ&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; / ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; as well as ''d''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; = ''m''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; / ρ&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; yields

&lt;math&gt;\Delta f=-\frac{f_f}\pi \left( \arctan \frac{Z_{\mathrm{F}}}{Z_q}\tan \left( 
\frac{2\pi f}{Z_{\mathrm{F}}}m_{\mathrm{F}}\right) \right)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Viscoelastic film ===
For a viscoelastic film, the frequency shift is

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta f^{*}}{f_f}=\frac{-1}{\pi Z_q}Z_{\mathrm{F}}\tan \left( k_{\mathrm{F}}d_{\mathrm{F}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is the acoustic impedance of the film (''Z''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; = ρ&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;''c''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; = (ρ&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;''G''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;)= (ρ&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;/''J''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;), ''k''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is the wave vector and ''d''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is the film thickness.  ''J''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is the film's viscoelastic compliance, ρ&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is the density.

The poles of the [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangent]] (''k''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; ''d''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; = π/2) define the film resonances.&lt;ref name=granstaff&gt;{{cite journal|author1=V.E.

The agreement between experiment and theory is often poor close to the film resonance.  Typically, the QCM only works well for film thicknesses much less than a quarter of the wavelength of sound (corresponding to a few micrometres, depending on the softness of the film and the overtone order).

Note that the properties of a film as determined with the QCM are fully specified by two parameters, which are its acoustic impedance, ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; = ρ&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;''c''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; and its mass per unit area, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; = ''d''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;/ρ&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;.  The wave number ''k''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; = ω/''c''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is not algebraically independent from ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;.  Unless the density of the film is known independently, the QCM can only measure mass per unit area, never the geometric thickness itself.

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta f^{*}}{f_f}=\frac{-Z_{\mathrm{F}}}{\pi Z_q}\frac{Z_{\mathrm{F}}\tan \left(
k_{\mathrm{F}}d_{\mathrm{F}}\right) -iZ_{\mathrm{Liq}}}{Z_{\mathrm{F}}+iZ_{\mathrm{Liq}}\tan \left(
k_{\mathrm{F}}d_{\mathrm{F}}\right) }&lt;/math&gt;

The indices ''F'' and ''Liq'' denote the film and the liquid.  Here, the reference state is the crystal immersed in liquid (but not covered with a film).  For thin films, one can [[taylor series|Taylor-expand]] the above equation to first order in ''d''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;, yielding

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta f^{*}}{f_f}=\frac{-m_{\mathrm{F}}}{\pi Z_q}\left( 1-\frac{Z_{
\mathrm{Liq}}^2}{Z_{\mathrm{F}}^2}\right)=\frac{-m_{\mathrm{F}}}{\pi Z_q}\left( 1-J_{\mathrm{F}}\frac{Z_{\mathrm{Liq}}^2}{\rho_{\mathrm{F}}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Apart from the term in brackets, this equation is equivalent to the Sauerbrey equation.  The term in brackets is a viscoelastic correction, dealing with the fact that in liquids, soft layers lead to a smaller Sauerbrey thickness than rigid layers.

=== Derivation of viscoelastic constants ===
The frequency shift depends on the acoustic impedance of the material; the latter in turn depends on the viscoelastic properties of the material.  Therefore, in principle, one can derive the complex shear modulus (or equivalently, the complex viscosity).  However, there are certain caveats to be kept in mind:

* The viscoelastic parameters themselves usually depend on frequency (and therefore on the overtone order).
* It is often difficult to disentangle effects of inertia and viscoelasticity.  Unless the film thickness is known independently, it is difficult to obtain unique fitting results.
* Electrode effects can be of importance.
* For films in air, the small-load approximation must be replaced by the corresponding results from perturbation theory unless the films are very soft.

For thin films in liquids, there is an approximate analytical result, relating the elastic compliance of the film, ''J''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;’ to the ratio of Δ(w/2); and Δ''f''.  The shear compliance is the inverse of the shear modulus, ''G''.  In the thin-film limit, the ratio of Δ(w/2) and –Δ''f'' is independent of film thickness.  It is an intrinsic property of the film.  One has&lt;ref name=du&gt;{{cite journal|author1=B. Y. Du  |author2=D. Johannsmann |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Operation of the Quartz Crystal Microbalance in Liquids: Derivation of the Elastic Compliance of a Film from the Ratio of Bandwidth Shift and Frequency Shift|journal= Langmuir|pages= 2809–12|year=2004|volume= 20|doi=10.1021/la035965l|pmid=15835157|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta \left( \omega /2\right) }{-\Delta f}\approx \eta \omega
J_F^{\,\prime }&lt;/math&gt;

For thin films in air an analogous analytical result is&lt;ref name=johannsmann1999&gt;{{cite journal|author=D. Johannsmann|title=Viscoelastic analysis of organic thin films on quartz resonators|journal=Macromolecular Chemistry and Physics|page= 501|year=1999|volume= 200|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-3935(19990301)200:3&lt;501::AID-MACP501&gt;3.0.CO;2-W|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Delta \left( \omega /2\right) =\frac 8{3\rho _{\mathrm{F}}Z_q}f_f^{\,4}m_{ 
\mathrm{F}}^3n^3\pi ^2J^{\prime \prime }&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''J''’’ is the viscous shear compliance.

=== Interpretation of the Sauerbrey thickness ===
The correct interpretation of the frequency shift from QCM experiments in liquids is a challenge.  Practitioners often just apply the Sauerbrey equation to their data and term the resulting areal mass (mass per unit area) the  "Sauerbrey mass" and the corresponding thickness "Sauerbrey thickness".  Even though the Sauerbrey thickness can certainly serve to compare different experiments, it must not be naively identified with the geometric thickness.  Worthwhile considerations are the following:

a) The QCM always measures an areal mass density, never a geometric thickness.  The conversion from areal mass density to thickness usually requires the physical density as an independent input.
  
b) It is difficult to infer the viscoelastic correction factor from QCM data.  However, if the correction factor differs significantly from unity, it may be expected that it affects the bandwidth Δ(w/2) and also that it depends on overtone order.  If, conversely, such effects are absent (Δ(''w''/2) « Δ''f'', Sauerbrey thickness same on all overtone orders) one may assume that (1-''Z''&lt;sub&gt;Liq&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''Z''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)≈1.

c) Complex samples are often laterally heterogeneous.

d) Complex samples often have fuzzy interfaces.  A "fluffy" interface will often lead to a viscoelastic correction and, as a consequence, to a non-zero Δ(''w''/2) as well as an overtone-dependent Sauerbrey mass.  In the absence of such effects, one may conclude that the outer interface of film is sharp.

e) When the viscoelastic correction, as discussed in (b), is insignificant, this does by no means imply that the film is not swollen by the [[solvent]].  It only means that the (swollen) film is much more rigid than the ambient liquid.  QCM data taken on the wet sample alone do not allow inference of the degree of swelling.  The amount of swelling can be inferred from the comparison of the wet and the dry thickness.  The degree of swelling is also accessible by comparing the acoustic thickness (in the Sauerbrey sense) to the optical thickness as determined by, for example, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy or ellipsometry.  Solvent contained in the film usually does contribute to the acoustic thickness (because it takes part in the movement), whereas it does not contribute to the optic thickness (because the electronic [[polarizability]] of a solvent molecule does not change when it is located inside a film). The difference in dry and wet mass is shown with [[Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring|QCM-D]] and [[Multi-Parametric Surface Plasmon Resonance|MP-SPR]] for instance in protein adsorption on nanocellulose&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vuoriluoto|first1=Maija|last2=Orelma|first2=Hannes|last3=Johansson|first3=Leena-Sisko|last4=Zhu|first4=Baolei|last5=Poutanen|first5=Mikko|last6=Walther|first6=Andreas|last7=Laine|first7=Janne|last8=Rojas|first8=Orlando J.|title=Effect of Molecular Architecture of PDMAEMA–POEGMA Random and Block Copolymers on Their Adsorption on Regenerated and Anionic Nanocelluloses and Evidence of Interfacial Water Expulsion|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry B|date=10 December 2015|volume=119|issue=49|pages=15275–15286|doi=10.1021/acs.jpcb.5b07628}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mohan|first1=Tamilselvan|last2=Niegelhell|first2=Katrin|last3=Zarth|first3=Cíntia Salomão Pinto|last4=Kargl|first4=Rupert|last5=Köstler|first5=Stefan|last6=Ribitsch|first6=Volker|last7=Heinze|first7=Thomas|last8=Spirk|first8=Stefan|last9=Stana-Kleinschek|first9=Karin|title=Triggering Protein Adsorption on Tailored Cationic Cellulose Surfaces|journal=Biomacromolecules|date=10 November 2014|volume=15|issue=11|pages=3931–3941|doi=10.1021/bm500997s}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in other soft materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Emilsson|first1=Gustav|last2=Schoch|first2=Rafael L.|last3=Feuz|first3=Laurent|last4=Höök|first4=Fredrik|last5=Lim|first5=Roderick Y.

== Point contacts ==
The equations concerning viscoelastic properties assume planar layer systems.  A frequency shift is also induced when the crystal makes contact with discrete objects across small, load-bearing asperities.  Such contacts are often encountered with rough surfaces.  It is assumed that the stress–speed ratio may be replaced by an average stress–speed ratio, where the average stress just is the lateral force divided by the active area of the crystal.

Often, the external object is so heavy that it does not take part in the MHz oscillation of the crystal due to inertia.  It then rests in place in the laboratory frame.  When the crystal surface is laterally displaced, the contact exerts a restoring force upon the crystal surface.  The stress is proportional to the number density of the contacts, ''N''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;, and their average spring constant, κ&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;.  The spring constant may be complex (κ&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = κ&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;’ + iκ&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;’’), where the imaginary part quantifies a withdrawal of energy from the crystal oscillation (for instance due to viscoelastic effects).  For such a situation, the small-load approximation predicts

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta f^{*}}{f_f}=\frac{N_S}{\pi Z_q}\frac{\kappa _S^{*}}\omega&lt;/math&gt;

The QCM allows for non-destructive testing of the shear stiffness of multi-asperity contacts.

The '''Saab 9-5''' is an [[executive car]] that was produced by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] automobile maker [[Saab Automobile|Saab]].

The first generation 9-5 was introduced in 1997, for the 1998 [[model year]], as the replacement to the [[Saab 9000]]. At the time, the car represented a significant development for the manufacturer. In the United States, the 9-5 was introduced in the spring of 1998, for the 1999 model year.

On September 15, 2009, the second generation was presented at the Frankfurt Motor Show and production began in June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saabsunited.com/2009/09/2010-saab-9-5---you-must-see-this-vehicle.html |title=2010 Saab 9-5 – You must see this vehicle |publisher=SaabsUnited.com |date=2009-09-15 |accessdate=2010-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first Saab to be launched under Spyker Cars' ownership, even though it was developed almost completely under GM's ownership.

==Overview==
Saab badged the model as the '''Saab 9&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;''', but consistently advertised it as the '''Saab 9-5''', pronounced "nine five" rather than "ninety-five". This model should not be confused with the [[Saab 95]], produced from 1959 to 1978.

The first generation 9-5 was available with [[sedan (car)|sedan]] and [[station wagon]] [[body style]]s. Aerodynamically, the sedan's [[Automobile drag coefficient|drag coefficient]] is 0.29, and the station wagon's is 0.31 (U.S. version 0.33). Introduced in 1999, the wagon features innovations such as floor tracks to secure cargo and a sliding load floor to make loading easier.

The 9-5 was the first production vehicle to offer ventilated seats, as well as asymmetrical turbocharging in the case of the 3.0L V6 engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tunberg|first1=Anders|title=Saab 9-5: a Personal Story|date=1997|publisher=Norden Publishing House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last 9-5 sedan of the first generation rolled off the [[Trollhättan]] production line at the beginning of July 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/saab-builds-last-9-5-begins-retooling-for-new-model.html |title=Saab builds last 9-5, begins retooling for new model |publisher=Leftlanenews.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the last wagon was assembled on February 1, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saabhistory.com/2010/02/01/final-saab-9-5-sportcombi-model-rolls-off-assembly-line |title=Final Saab 9-5 SportCombi Model Rolls Off Assembly Line |publisher=SaabHistory.com |date=2010-02-01 |accessdate=2010-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the summer of 1997, when 9-5 production began, and 2010, 252,236 sedans, and 231,357 wagons were built. The total production 483,593 units, was narrowly beaten by its predecessor, the 9000, of which 503,000 were built.

Production equipment for the first-generation 9-5 was sold by General Motors to [[BAIC]] of China in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyteknik.se/nyheter/fordon_motor/bilar/article688675.ece |title=Ny Teknik avslöjar: Saab-affär med kineserna klar |publisher=Talentum Media AB |date= |accessdate=2012-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606234429/http://www.nyteknik.se/nyheter/fordon_motor/bilar/article688675.ece |archivedate=2012-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engines===
The first-generation 9-5 was powered by Saab's [[Saab H engine|B205 and B235]] [[straight-4]] [[Internal combustion engine|engines]], and from 2002 in Europe by an [[Opel]] Ecotec X22DTH 2.2 diesel engine (Saab D223L), replaced in 2006 by [[Fiat Automobiles|Fiat]]'s 1.9 [[JTD]] 16V [[diesel engine|diesel]] [[straight-4]]. A turbocharged version of the [[General Motors|GM]] [[GM 54-Degree V6 engine|54° V6 engine]], designated by Saab as B308, had a unique asymmetrical low-pressure [[turbocharger]] and was available from 1999 to 2003.  This engine was available only with an automatic transmission, and cars with this engine installed are distinguishable by their twin tailpipes. The V6 was only available on Arc, SE, and Griffin models. In 2004, the V6 engine was replaced by a high pressure turbo straight-4 engine producing {{convert|220|hp|abbr=on}}. By 2006 this engine was producing {{convert|260|hp|abbr=on}} even in the non-Aero or non-sport models (US models).

The B205 &amp; B235-based 9-5 models have suffered a high rate of engine failures due to engine oil sludge.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} This primarily affected the 1999–2003 models. Saab refined the engine's positive crankcase ventilation system (PCV) for the 2004 and later model years and required use of fully synthetic oil, virtually eliminating the problem. Additionally, SAAB created update kits to retrofit to the 1999–2003 cars since they cannot be easily modified to accept the 2004 and later system. Mounting complaints by 9-5 owners forced GM to offer an eight-year warranty on the engine in 4-cylinder models for original owners, provided the owner can produce proof that they followed the manufacturer's oil change intervals. Saab recommended the use of fully synthetic or synthetic-blend oil as a preventative measure.

===Transmissions===
The 9-5 was available with an [[Aisin]] AW 4-speed (50-42LE) [[automatic transmission]] saab reference FA47; from 1997 until 2001, when a new Aisin AW unit replaced the dated four-speed automatic with a five-speed automatic. A five-speed [[manual transmission]] is fitted as standard to the base models and the Aero. Six-speed manual transmission was not offered in first-generation 9-5s.

====Alternative propulsion====

=====E85=====
In 2005, an updated version of the 2.0&amp;nbsp;L turbocharged [[Straight-4|I4]] was introduced in the European market together with the 2006 9-5. The engine was sold as ''2.0T BioPower'', optimized to run on [[E85]] producing 132&amp;nbsp;[[Kilowatt|kW]] (180&amp;nbsp;[[Horsepower|hp]]) at 5500&amp;nbsp;rpm. There was also a 2.3T BioPower version sold from 2007. It was also introduced in Australia.

=====E100=====
There is a Saab 9-5 [[Neat ethanol fuel|E100]] Concept, based on the turbo 2.0.

===Safety===
The 9-5 introduced Saab's Active Head Restraints (SAHR), which moved up and forward to prevent [[whiplash (medicine)|whiplash]] when the car was struck from the rear. This feature won technology and safety awards in Australia, Denmark, and the United Kingdom. The Saab 9-5 also was one of the first cars to have extensive side-crash protection.

The front seats featured [[torso airbag]]s and [[head airbag]]s even on even the earliest models, which few contemporary vehicles did in the late 1990s. The basic structure included a robust passenger [[safety cage]], front and rear [[deformation zone]]s, reinforced door posts and pillars, as well as the "Pendulum B-Pillar", which combined [[high-strength low-alloy steel]] at chest and head height with [[tailored blank]] steel at the floorpan, designed to direct the crash forces down toward the floor. The design was proven by the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] (IIHS) to protect occupants in side crashes, even without the addition of curtain airbags or rear side airbags. From 2002, ESP ([[electronic stability control]]) was included as standard.

Another Saab feature, the "[[Saab 900 (NG)#Black Panel|Night Panel]]", permitted dousing of the instrument panel lighting, except for essential information, for less distraction when driving at night. Once activated, only essential information such as current speed is displayed except, for example, if the car requires fuel or the engine overheats.

In the United States [[OnStar]] was available, and provided as standard equipment in selected 9-5's from 2001 onward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saabusa.com/saabjsp/95s/features/safety_security.jsp |title=2008 Saab 9-5 Sedan: Safety Features and Specifications |publisher=Saabusa.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comfort ===
The 9-5 had various comfort features both as standard and cost options over the years.

While early models frequently had dash mounted cassette decks, CD changers were standard features on many cars and in-dash satellite navigation was also available. Factory-fitted phone kits were similarly optional.

Many models featured leather or part-leather upholstery and both front and rear heated seats were also available. A few models were shipped with the optional ventilated seats.

Cruise control was available on various models and xenon headlamps were fitted as standard on high-end variants.

===Aero===
The performance 9-5 Aero, the earliest versions of which were sometimes referred to as the HOT Aero, was first released in 2000 with a 2.3T [[Saab H engine|B235R]] engine. The B235R engine of the 9-5 Aero was capable of providing immense torque and, in terms of acceleration, outperformed the contemporary Porsche 911 Turbo from 40-90&amp;nbsp;mph.

Initially badged as a 230ps engine, Saab later conceded that the 230&amp;nbsp;hp power figure was quite conservative, with the manual versions rated 250&amp;nbsp;hp and having more torque than stated. This flagship model had a long list of standard features, a sport tuned suspension, and body side moldings. In 2002 a {{convert|253|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} 2.3 turbo engine was made standard, which allowed for more torque after 4500 rev/min. All Aero models from 2002-2005 have an identical engine layout and management system, with the 2002-05 models just having a slightly remapped version of that ECU from factory. The high-powered version of the 9-5 in the final form produces {{convert|264|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|350|Nm|lb·ft|abbr=on}} of [[torque]] ({{convert|370|Nm|lb·ft|abbr=on}} with its 20-second overboost function accessible on the manual transmission equipped version.

From model year 2006 to end of production, the {{convert|264|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} B235R was the standard engine in the 9-5 in both the 2.3T and Aero trims. 2006 had only one badge designation, the 2.3T and appointments normally found on the Aero could be added via a "Sport Package".

From 2007 onwards, SAAB added an Aero badge to the trunk lid to distinguish from regular 2.3T models. In addition, almost all standard features on the Aero were standard on the 2.3T, the exceptions being sport-tuned chassis, two-tone leather upholstery, "Anniversary" wheels and brushed aluminum interior trim, all of which were standard on Aero and not available on the 2.3T.

===Police car===
[[File:Swedish police SAAB 9-5 88124.jpg|thumb|right|Saab 9-5 with the [[Swedish Police]]]]The 9-5 was used as a liveried patrol vehicle, as well as undercover, in several parts of its native Sweden, alongside the [[Volvo V70]]. Several police forces in the UK also used the 9-5 in their fleets, mostly in Aero specification. The city of [[Aspen, Colorado]], used Saabs as patrol cars from early 1970s until 2005, when the 9-5 was discontinued in favor of [[Volvo XC90]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aspenpitkin.com/depts/53/divisions_patrol.cfm City of Aspen – Police Department – Patrol Division] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005062837/http://www.aspenpitkin.com/depts/53/divisions_patrol.cfm |date=October 5, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The town of [[Vail, Colorado]] likewise used Saabs from 1980 onwards, but in 2005, the black 9-5 patrol cars were replaced by [[Ford Explorer]]s, due to budget reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/offbeat/2003-09-23-vail-saab_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Vail police switch from Saab to Ford | date=2003-09-23 | accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Lothian and Borders Police in Edinburgh, Scotland, began operating three Saab 9-5 Aero 2.3T patrol cars as part of a fleet of 580 vehicles. These 9-5s were customised to police specifications by the Saab, Vauxhall and Chevrolet Special Vehicles Operation (SVO) in Papworth, [[Cambridgeshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/news.cfm/newsid/2060922.005/country/saab/saab/saab-9-5-2.3t-police-model-uk |title=Saab 9-5 2.3t Police Model (UK) |publisher=Worldcarfans.com |date=2006-09-21 |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In undercover guise, these cars were outwardly identical to the Linear Sport models, but featured the 260&amp;nbsp;bhp Aero drivetrain.

In Poland, an unmarked 9-5 is used as a video-pursuit vehicle, in the Płock area&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://poboczem.pl/news/czym-jezdzi-video-drogowka,1312448 |title=Czym jeździ video-drogówka – Poboczem.pl – Nie tylko wiejski tuning i tragiczne wypadki drogowe |publisher=Poboczem.pl |date= |accessdate=2009-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A next generation 9-5 built on the [[GM Epsilon II platform|Global Epsilon platform]] was presented at the [[Frankfurt Auto Show|Frankfurt International Auto Show]] in September 2009. The vehicle had its North American debut in October 2009 at the [[South Florida Auto Show]] in [[Miami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.gm.com/servlet/GatewayServlet?target=http://image.emerald.gm.com/gmnews/viewpressreldetail.do?domain=502&amp;docid=57450 |title=GM Media Online |publisher=Media.gm.com |date=2009-10-16 |accessdate=2009-10-23}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On November 24, 2009, the first pre-series Saab 9-5 of the new generation rolled off the [[Trollhättan]] production line.

With the announcement of the sale of Saab to Spyker on January 26, 2010, it was confirmed that the new generation Saab 9-5 was already taken into production at the Saab plant in Trollhättan. Full production began in April 2010, with the cars appearing in dealerships on June 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://hugin.info/136917/R/1377452/338364.pdf|format=PDF|title=Spyker press release |publisher=Spyker N.V. |date=2010-01-26 |accessdate=2010-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saab introduced a wagon variant of the new 9-5, dubbed "SportCombi," at the 2011 [[Geneva Motor Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.saab.com/news/news/allnewsaab95sportcombitodebutatgenevamotorshow.5.5e4ba22d12bd45ed89a7ffe964.html |title=All-new Saab 9-5 SportCombi to Debut at Geneva Motor Show - Saab Newsroom |publisher=Newsroom.saab.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110122061020/http://newsroom.saab.com/news/news/allnewsaab95sportcombitodebutatgenevamotorshow.5.5e4ba22d12bd45ed89a7ffe964.html |archivedate=2011-01-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Saab 9-5 Sedan 2.8V6 Turbo was named [[Car of the Year]] in [[Singapore]] by "Wheels Asia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.saab.com/press-releases/2011-10-07/saab-9-5-named-car-year-singapore |title=Saab 9-5 named Car of the Year in Singapore |publisher=Media.saab.com |date=2011-10-07 |accessdate=2011-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125055804/http://media.saab.com/press-releases/2011-10-07/saab-9-5-named-car-year-singapore |archivedate=2011-11-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Saab's business issues came to a head, production of 2011 9-5 models essentially ended in March 2011, when the production line in Trollhättan was stopped due to supply chain issues that were related to the company's lack of [[Accounting liquidity|liquidity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110330/COPY01/303309842/1198 |title=Saab output suspended again over supplier payments |publisher=Crain Communications, Inc. |date=2011-03-30 |accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Total production numbers of the Gen II Saab 9-5 ended at 11,280 units. 

Although some prototype pilots and a number of production SportCombis were produced, the official variant did not enter serial production prior to Saab's bankruptcy in December 2011, and the vehicles never reached dealerships.

=== Trim levels ===
Trim/equipment levels vary from country to country.

In the US Saab 9-5 trim levels were: Turbo4, Turbo4 Premium, Turbo6 XWD, and Aero. Turbo4 models come with a turbocharged four-cylinder and features that included power adjustable driver and passenger’s seats, leather upholstery, five-spoke alloy wheels, fog lamps, and rain-sensing wipers. 
The Turbo4 Premium added a panoramic sunroof, headlamp washers, Saab parking assistance, keyless entry and start, memory seats, and 18-inch alloy wheels, while the Turbo6 XWD was powered by a turbocharged six-cylinder engine and features an all-wheel-drive system. 
The top trim Aero featured 15-spoke “Rotor” 18-inch alloy wheels, leather-trimmed sports seats, a multi-color central information display, Bi-Xenon SmartBeam headlamps, dark titanium-effect interior trim, aluminum sports pedals, a sports-tuned suspension system with real-time damping, and Aero exterior elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/new-car-buying/saab/9-5/# |title=Saab 9-5 Information |publisher=LeftLane News |accessdate=2012-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203182323/http://www.leftlanenews.com/new-car-buying/saab/9-5/ |archivedate=2012-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

UK equipment levels for the 2012 model year included the Vector SE and Aero and both sedan and estate. The previous base models, Linear and Vector were replaced by the Vector SE model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.saab9-5.com/?p=183 |title=SAAB 9-5 2012 model year UK specs &amp; prices|publisher=blog.Saab9-5 |date=2011-06-16 |accessdate=2012-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia the base trim (Linear) was not part of the line up, only the Vector and Aero trims were available.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bilsvar.se/sv/Sok-bil/?pageNumber=1&amp;brand=SAAB&amp;model=9-5&amp;year&gt;2009&amp;body=Sedan&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engines===
In North America, the engine choices were either a turbocharged V6 or an Ecotec I4. Other countries also had an optional turbodiesel I4 engine. Engine performance upgrades that were available from Hirsch Performance (Saab's only factory approved tuner) increased the power of the V6 engine to {{cvt|330|bhp|kW PS}} from {{cvt|296|bhp|kW PS}} and the I4 engine to {{cvt|260|bhp|kW PS}} from {{cvt|220|bhp|kW PS}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3861">'''Silver mica capacitors''' are high [[Accuracy and precision|precision]], stable and reliable [[capacitor]]s. They are available in small values, and are mostly used at high frequencies and in cases where low losses ([[Q factor|high Q]]) and low capacitor change over the time is desired.

==History==
Cornell Dubilier Electronics, Inc. was the inventor of the mica capacitor. RF mica capacitors feature high Q performance without the cracking associated with ceramic and porcelain capacitors. They are still used in military, aerospace, medical and audio applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cde.com/capacitors/mica |title=MICA CAPACITORS |website=cde.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
There are 2 distinct types of mica capacitor.

===Clamped Mica capacitors===
Now obsolete, these were in use in the early 20th century. They consisted of sheets of [[mica]] and [[copper]] foil sandwiched together and [[clamp (tool)|clamp]]ed. These had even worse tolerance and stability than other clamped capacitors since the mica surface is not perfectly flat &amp; smooth. References to mica capacitors from the 1920s always refers to this type.

===Silver Mica capacitors===
[[File:Silver mica capacitors.jpg|thumb|left|A lot of 1nF x 500VDC rated Silver Mica Capacitors]]Commonly known as '''silver mica capacitors''', these rendered clamped mica capacitors obsolete. Instead of being clamped with [[metal leaf|foil]]s these are assembled from sheets of mica coated on both sides with deposited [[metal]]. The assembly is dipped in [[epoxy]]. The advantages are:
* Greater stability, since there are no capacitive airgaps that can change [[dimension]]
* Airtight enclosure removes the risk of [[oxidation]] or [[corrosion]] of plates or connections
* Greater capacitance per [[volume]], since there are no airgaps between plates and [[mica]], the conducting surfaces can be thinner
** No [[clamp (tool)|clamp]]ing mechanism is needed

They are sometimes informally referred to as mica capacitors. Any modern reference to mica capacitors can be assumed to mean these, unless pre-war equipment is being discussed. Even though these capacitors are extremely useful, Silver mica capacitors are less commonly used today due to bulkiness and high cost. There is a high level of compositional variation in the raw material leading to higher costs in relation to inspection and sorting. They are getting closer to obsolescence as advances are made in ceramic and porcelain materials.

Silver mica capacitors are still indispensable in some custom applications. Circuit designers still turn to mica capacitors for high-power applications such as RF transmitters and electric instruments and amplifiers because cheaper ceramic and porcelain capacitors can't withstand heat as well. Silver mica remains widely used in high-voltage applications, due to mica’s high breakdown voltage. Silver Mica capacitors are used at 100V to 10KV, ranging from 47pf to 3000dpf and the average temperature coefficient is around 50 ppm/°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capacitorguide.com/mica-capacitor/ |title=Mica Capacitor |website=capacitorguide.com}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Silver Mica capacitors in electric instruments==
Silver Mica capacitors are soldered to volume potentiometers in some electric guitars to prevent treble bleed (loss) when the volume is lowered. By using a particular capacitance range (pF) mica capacitor, the higher frequencies pass through the volume potentiometer providing very little tonal coloration and clear harmonics. Values such as 180pf and 280pf at 400V and 500V are often used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://reverb.com/marketplace?query=Silver%20Mica%20Capacitor%2C%20epoxy%20dipped%20500V |title=Silver Mica Capacitor, epoxy dipped 500V |website=reverb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2900">[[File:Dönüş-kayış göstergesi - skid.png|thumbnail|Airplane in a right turn skid]]
In a straight flight, the [[Stabilizer (aircraft)|tail]] of the airplane aligns the [[fuselage]] into the [[relative wind]]. However, in the beginning of a turn, when the [[aileron]]s are being applied in order to bank the airplane, the ailerons also cause an [[adverse yaw]] of the airplane. For example, if the airplane is [[Flight dynamics|rolling]] clockwise (from the pilot point of view), the airplane yaws to the left. It assumes a crab-like attitude relative to the wind. This is called a [[Slip (aerodynamic)|slip]]. The air is flowing crosswise over the fuselage. In order to correct this adverse slip, the pilot must apply [[rudder]] (right rudder in this example). If the pilot applies too much rudder, the airplane will then slip to the other side. This is called a '''skid'''.

==Stall==
The skid is more dangerous than the slip if the airplane is close to a [[Stall (flight)|stall]]. In the slip, the raised wing &amp;mdash; the left one if the airplane is turning to the right &amp;mdash; will stall before the lowered one, and the airplane will reduce the bank angle, which prevents the stall. In the skid, the lowered wing will stall before the raised one, and the airplane will tighten the turn, and the stall can develop to a [[Spin (flight)|spin]].

At high altitudes, there is plenty of space for recovery. But during the final approach, when the airplane is close to the ground, a stall-spin accident is often fatal. A common cause of this accident is to enter a skidding turn in the [[airfield traffic pattern]] on the turn from base leg to final approach, unconsciously using excessive rudder in an attempt to tighten the turn and avoid overshooting the runway centreline.&lt;ref name="SHIF"&gt;John S. Denker, ''See How It Flies''. http://www.av8n.com/how/htm/snaps.html#sec-skids&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deliberate skid==
[[File:Turn coordinators-en.svg|thumb|[[Turn coordinator]]s indicating different kinds of turns]]
Deliberate skids are used in [[aerobatics]] and [[aerial warfare|aerial combat]]. Deliberate slips done with vigorous application of roll and opposite rudder (lower the right wing and step on the left rudder) can be used as a dive brake. By balancing the roll's turn to the right with the rudder's yaw to the left, the plane continues to fly straight ahead but it presents its side rather than its nose to the airstream. The drag from this aerodynamically "dirty", clumsy position slows the otherwise sleek airplane. By modulating the amount of skid with rudder and aileron, the pilot can modulate the braking. Thus the plane can be slowed down quickly in level flight or the descent to a landing can be dramatically steepened while holding the approach speed to a desired value.

'''Soil solarization''' is an [[environmentally friendly]] method of using [[solar power]] for [[pest control|controlling pests]] such as soilborne [[plant pathogen]]s including fungi, bacteria, nematodes, and insect and mite pests along with weed seed and seedlings in the soil by [[mulching]] the soil and covering it with tarp, usually with a transparent [[polyethylene]] cover, to trap solar energy.
It may also describe methods of [[soil decontamination|decontaminating soil]] using sunlight or solar power. This energy causes physical, chemical, and biological changes in the soil.

==Soil disinfestation==
Soil solarization (referred to as solar heating of the soil in early publications) is a relatively new soil disinfestation method, first described in extensive scientific detail by Katan et al. in 1976, presenting the results of a series of studies performed under field conditions, initiated in 1973, for controlling soilborne pathogens and weeds, mostly as a pre-planting soil treatment. Soil is mulched and then covered with transparent polyethylene during the hot season, thereby heating it and killing the pests and diseases

==Soil decontamination ==
A 2008 study used a solar cell to generate an electric field for electrokinetic (EK) remediation of [[cadmium]]-[[soil contamination|contaminated soil]]. The solar cell could drive the [[electromigration]] of cadmium in contaminated soil, and the removal efficiency that was achieved by the solar cell was comparable with that achieved by conventional power supply.&lt;ref name="pmid18656308"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Yuan S|author2=Zheng Z|author3=Chen J|author4= Lu X |title=Use of solar cell in electrokinetic remediation of cadmium-contaminated soil |journal=J. Hazard. Mater. |volume= 162|issue= 2–3|pages= 1583–7|date=June 2008 |pmid=18656308 |doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2008.06.038 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Korea, various remediation methods of soil slurry and groundwater contaminated with [[benzene]] at a polluted gas station site were evaluated, including a solar-driven, photocatalyzed reactor system along with various [[advanced oxidation process]]es (AOP). The most synergistic remediation method incorporated a solar light process with [[TiO2]] slurry and [[H2O2]] system, achieving 98% benzene degradation, a substantial increase in the removal of benzene.&lt;ref name="pmid18161562"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cho IH|author2=Chang SW |title=The potential and realistic hazards after a solar-driven chemical treatment of benzene using a health risk assessment at a gas station site in Korea |journal=J Environ Sci Health a Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=86–97 |date=January 2008 |pmid=18161562 |doi=10.1080/10934520701750090 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Attempts were made to use solar energy for controlling disease agents in soil and in plant material already in the ancient civilization of [[Solar power in India|India]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}. In 1939, Groashevoy, who used the term "solar energy for sand disinfection," controlled Thielaviopsis basicola upon heating the sand by exposure to direct sunlight{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}.

Soil solarization is the third approach for soil [[disinfestation]]; the two other main approaches, soil [[steaming]] and [[fumigation]]; were developed at the end of the 19th century. The idea of solarization was based on observations by extension workers and farmers in the hot [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]], who noticed the intensive heating of the polyethylene-mulched soil. The involvement of [[biological control]] mechanisms in pathogen control and the possible implications were indicated in the first publication, noticing the very long effect of the treatment. In 1977, American scientists from the [[University of California]] at Davis reported the control of [[Verticillium]] in a cotton field, based on studies started in 1976, thus denoting, for the first time, the possible wide applicability of this method.

The use of polyethylene for soil solarization differs in principle from its traditional agricultural use. With solarization, soil is mulched during the hottest months (rather than the coldest, as in conventional [[plasticulture]] which is aimed at protecting the crop) in order to increase the maximal temperatures in an attempt to achieve lethal heat levels.

In the first 10 years following the influential 1976 publication, soil solarization was investigated in at least 24 countries&lt;ref&gt;
J. Katan et al. The first decade (1976–1986) of soil solarization (solar heating): A chronological bibliography. Phytoparasitica. 1987 Volume 15, Number 3, 229-255, {{doi|10.1007/BF02979585}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been now been applied in more than 50, mostly in the hot regions, although there were some important exceptions. Studies have demonstrated effectiveness of solarization with various crops, including vegetables, field crops, ornamentals and fruit trees, against many pathogens, weeds and a soil arthropod. Those pathogens and weeds which are not controlled by solarization were also detected.  The biological, chemical and physical changes that take in solarized soil during and after the solarization have been investigated, as well as the interaction of solarization with other methods of control. Long-term effects including biological control and increased growth response were verified in various climatic regions and soils, demonstrating the general applicability of solarization. 
Computerized [[simulation]] models have been developed to guide researchers and growers whether the ambient conditions of their locality are suitable for solarization.

Studies of the improvement of solarization by integrating it with other methods or by solarizing in closed glasshouses, or studies concerning commercial application by developing mulching machines were also carried out.

The use of solarization in existing orchards (e.g. controlling [[Verticillium]] in [[pistachio]] plantations) is an important deviation from the standard preplanting method and was reported as early as 1979.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6651">A '''solar controller''' is an electronic device that controls the [[circulating pump]] in a [[solar hot water]] system to harvest as much heat as possible from the solar panels and protect the system from overheating.  The basic job of the controller is to turn the circulating pump on when there is heat available in the panels, moving the working fluid through the panels to the heat exchanger at the [[thermal store]]. Heat is available whenever the temperature of the solar panel is greater than the temperature of the water in the heat exchanger. Overheat protection is achieved by turning the pump off when the store reaches its maximum temperature and sometimes cooling the store by turning the pump on when the store is hotter than the panels.

Most commercial controllers display the temperature of the hot water in the store and provide general status information about the system, including overall energy production.

==Components==
The simplest solar controller circuit uses a comparator with two temperature inputs, one at the solar panel and one at the [[thermal store]]'s heat exchanger, and an output to control the pump. Commercial controllers use a [[microprocessor]] usually with a LCD display and simple user interface with a few pushbuttons. Power for the controller and the pump can come from a mains electric supply or from a [[photovoltaic]] (PV) module.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Function==
The controller's main function is to switch the circulating pump on or off.  The pump is usually switched on when the solar panel is hotter than the water in the store's heat exchanger and off when the panel is colder. Switching the pump on transfers the heat in the panel to the store. Switching it off when the panels cool prevents a reversal of the process and loss of heat from the store. The controller measures and compares the temperatures in the panel and the heat exchanger every few seconds.

Commercial controllers do not turn on the pump until the difference in temperature between the panels and the water in the heat exchanger is sufficient to provide significantly more energy than is consumed by the pump. This temperature difference is called the ''on differential'' (usually 4–15&amp;nbsp;°C. They turn off the pump when the panels no longer are hot enough to provide significant heat to the store (the ''off differential''). The wider the difference between these differentials, the fewer pump on-off cycles will take place. These factors are usually set by the solar installer in relation to the particular installation, especially dependent on the efficiency of the heat exhchanger and production capacity of the panels.

Controllers provide an overrun time to extract some of the heat energy left in interconnecting pipes after the panels cool off. They may also implement certain safety features such as cooling the store when it exceeds a preset temperature such as 65&amp;nbsp;°C, by sending excess heat back to the panels to be given off to the environment.

==Photovoltaic powered solar controller==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2011}}
{{Original research section|date=August 2011}}
A [[photovoltaic]] (PV) powered solar controller uses solar electricity produced on-site to run the pump that delivers the solar-heated transfer fluid to the hot water store.

One claimed advantage of PV power is that it reduces the overall carbon emissions associated with operating the system since it avoids the need to supply this energy from fossil sources.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} However, the energy required to operate the system is very small in comparison to the energy produced by the system and the carbon emissions reduction of adding PV power fractional.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The most practical benefit of a PV powered controller is the resultant simplicity of the overall system. Rather than using complex algorithms based on store and panel temperatures, the pump is driven directly by the PV panel: when the sun shines, the pump runs. In practice this is nearly (90-99%) as efficient a practical control algorithm as most others achieve and has obvious advantages for reduced system complexity.{{OR|date=August 2011}}

A disadvantage to the PV powered approach is that the pump stops immediately after the sun is occluded. With vacuum tube and heat pipe solar panels, these can have an appreciable amount of energy stored in each tube at the moment the sun goes in. To avoid overheating the tubes it is necessary to either pump the circuit for a short time after the sun, or else to provide a large reservoir of fluid in the header above the tubes. Neither of these options is really compatible with the simple direct-PV pump approach and so such systems are limited to using the less efficient flat panel collectors.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

A PV powered controller may contain a small electricity store to allow the controller to remain powered and display temperatures at night when there is no sunlight. This electricity store is usually in the form of [[supercapacitor]]s, since these have a much longer life than [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The benefits of a PV powered solar controller comes at a cost in reduced system performance in the range of 1-10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Martin C |author2=Watson M |title=Side-by-side Testing of Eight Solar Water Heating Systems |publisher=United Kingdom Department of Trade and Industry |date=2001 |url=http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file16826.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=2007-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630215238/http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file16826.pdf |archivedate=June 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to heat losses at times when the panel may be hotter than the water store but there is insufficient sunlight to power the pump. This happens mainly on hot days when hot water is likely to be in excess so the potential reduction is less significant than it would be at times when the store was cooler.{{OR|date=August 2011}}

They are described by a multi-component (spinor) [[order parameter]].
Since their initial experimental realisation,
a wealth of studies have appeared, both
experimental and theoretical, focusing
on the physical properties of spinor condensates, including their 
[[ground state]]s,  non-equilibrium dynamics, and
[[vortex|vortices]].

==Early Work==

The study of spinor condensates was initiated in 1998 by experimental groups at JILA &lt;ref name="HallMatthews1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=D. S.|last2=Matthews|first2=M. R.|last3=Ensher|first3=J. R.|last4=Wieman|first4=C. E.|last5=Cornell|first5=E. A.|title=Dynamics of Component Separation in a Binary Mixture of Bose-Einstein Condensates|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=81|issue=8|year=1998|pages=1539–1542|issn=0031-9007|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.1539|arxiv=cond-mat/9804138|bibcode=1998PhRvL..81.1539H}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and MIT.&lt;ref name="StengerInouye1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stenger|first1=J.|last2=Inouye|first2=S.|last3=Stamper-Kurn|first3=D. M.|last4=Miesner|first4=H.-J.|last5=Chikkatur|first5=A. P.|last6=Ketterle|first6=W.|title=Spin domains in ground-state Bose–Einstein condensates|journal=Nature|volume=396|issue=6709|year=1998|pages=345–348|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/24567|arxiv=cond-mat/9901072|bibcode=1998Natur.396..345S}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These experiments utilised
&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;Na and &lt;sup&gt;87&lt;/sup&gt;Rb atoms, respectively.
In contrast to most prior experiments on ultracold gases, these experiments utilised a purely
optical trap, which is spin-insensitive.  Shortly thereafter, theoretical work appeared
&lt;ref name="Ho1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ho|first1=Tin-Lun|title=Spinor Bose Condensates in Optical Traps|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=81|issue=4|year=1998|pages=742–745|issn=0031-9007|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.742|arxiv=cond-mat/9803231|bibcode=1998PhRvL..81..742H|citeseerx=10.1.1.242.852}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="OhmiMachida1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ohmi|first1=Tetsuo|last2=Machida|first2=Kazushige|title=Bose-Einstein Condensation with Internal Degrees of Freedom in Alkali Atom Gases|journal=Journal of the Physical Society of Japan|volume=67|issue=6|year=1998|pages=1822–1825|issn=0031-9015|doi=10.1143/JPSJ.67.1822|arxiv=cond-mat/9803160|bibcode=1998JPSJ...67.1822O}}&lt;/ref&gt;
which described the possible mean-field phases of spin-one spinor condensates.

==Underlying Hamiltonian==

The Hamiltonian describing a spinor condensate is most frequently written using the language of 
[[second quantization]].   Here the field operator
&lt;math&gt; 
\hat{\psi}_m^\dagger({\bf r})
&lt;/math&gt;
creates a boson in Zeeman level &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt; at position &lt;math&gt; {\bf r} &lt;/math&gt;.  These
operators satisfy [[Creation and annihilation operators|bosonic commutation relations]]:

&lt;math&gt; 
[\hat{\psi}_m({\bf r}), \hat{\psi}_{m'}^\dagger({\bf r}')] = \delta({\bf r} - {\bf r}') \delta_{mm'}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The free (non-interacting) part of the Hamiltonian is

&lt;math&gt; 
H_0 = \sum_m \int d^3 r \hat{\psi}_{m}^\dagger({\bf r}) \left(
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V_{\rm ext}({\bf r})
 \right) \hat{\psi}_{m}^\dagger({\bf r}).
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt; denotes the mass of the constituent particles and 
&lt;math&gt; V_{\rm ext}({\bf r}) &lt;/math&gt;  is an external potential.
For a spin-one spinor condensate, the interaction Hamiltonian is
&lt;ref name=Ho1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=OhmiMachida1998/&gt;

&lt;math&gt; 
H_{\rm int} = \frac{1}{2} \int d^3 r : \left( 
c_0 \hat{\rho}({\bf r})^2 + c_1 (\hat{{\bf F}}({\bf r}))^2
\right):.
&lt;/math&gt;

In this expression, 
&lt;math&gt;
\hat{\rho}({\bf r}) = \sum_m \hat{\psi}_m^\dagger({\bf r}) \hat{\psi}_m ({\bf r})
&lt;/math&gt;
is the operator corresponding to the density, 
&lt;math&gt;
\hat{{\bf F}}({\bf r}) = \sum_{mm'} \hat{\psi}_m^\dagger({\bf r}) {\bf S}_{mm'} \hat{\psi}_{m'}({\bf r})
&lt;/math&gt;
is the local spin operator (&lt;math&gt; 
{\bf S}_{mm'}
&lt;/math&gt;
is a vector composed of the [[Spin (physics)#higher spins|spin-one matrices]]),
and :: denotes [[normal order]]ing.   The parameters &lt;math&gt;c_0, c_1 &lt;/math&gt;
can be expressed in terms of the s-wave [[scattering length]]s of the constituent particles.
Higher spin versions of the
interaction Hamiltonian are slightly more involved, but 
can generally be expressed by using [[Clebsch–Gordan coefficients]].

The full Hamiltonian then is &lt;math&gt; H = H_0 + H_{\rm int} &lt;/math&gt;.

==Mean-field phases==

In Gross-Pitaevskii [[mean field theory]], one replaces the field operators with c-number functions:
&lt;math&gt; \hat{\psi}_{m}({\bf r}) \rightarrow {\psi}_{m}({\bf r})&lt;/math&gt;.  To find the mean-field
ground states, one then minimises the resulting energy with respect to these c-number functions.
For a spatially uniform system spin-one system, there are two possible mean-field ground states.  
When &lt;math&gt; c_1 &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;, the ground state is
&lt;math&gt;
\psi_{\rm polar} = \sqrt{\bar{\rho}}(0,1,0)
&lt;/math&gt;
while for &lt;math&gt; c_1&lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; the ground state is 
&lt;math&gt;
\psi_{\rm ferro} = \sqrt{\bar{\rho}}(1,0,0).
&lt;/math&gt;
The former expression is referred to as the polar state while the latter is the 
ferromagnetic state.&lt;ref name=KawaguchiUeda2012/&gt;
Both states are unique up to overall spin rotations.  Importantly, &lt;math&gt; \psi_{\rm ferro} &lt;/math&gt;
cannot be rotated into &lt;math&gt; \psi_{\rm polar} &lt;/math&gt;.
The Majorana stellar representation 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Majorana|first1=E|journal=Nuovo Cimento|date=1932|issue=9|pages=43 |title=Oriented atoms in a variable magnetic field}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a particularly insightful description of the mean-field phases of spinor 
condensates with larger spin.&lt;ref name=Stamper-KurnUeda2013/&gt;

==Vortices==

Due to being described by a multi-component [[order parameter]], numerous types of
[[topological defect]]s (vortices) can appear in spinor condensates
.&lt;ref name="Ueda2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ueda|first1=Masahito|title=Topological aspects in spinor Bose–Einstein condensates|journal=Reports on Progress in Physics|volume=77|issue=12|year=2014|pages=122401|issn=0034-4885|doi=10.1088/0034-4885/77/12/122401|pmid=25429528|bibcode=2014RPPh...77l2401U}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Homotopy theory]] provides a natural description of  topological defects
,&lt;ref name="Mermin1979"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mermin|first1=N. D.|title=The topological theory of defects in ordered media|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=51|issue=3|year=1979|pages=591–648|issn=0034-6861|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.51.591|bibcode=1979RvMP...51..591M}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is regularly employed to understand
vortices in spinor condensates.

[[Image:Sunshine at Dunstanburgh.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The [[sunlight]] shining through these clouds in [[England]] is an example of sunbreak.]]
A '''sunbreak''' is a natural phenomenon in which [[sunlight]] obscured over a relatively large area penetrates the obscuring material in a localized space.  The typical example is of sunlight shining through a hole in [[Cloud|cloud cover]].  A sunbreak piercing clouds normally produces a visible shaft of light reflected by [[Atmosphere|atmospheric]] dust, called a [[Crepuscular ray|sunbeam]].  Another form of sunbreak occurs when sunlight passes into an area otherwise [[shadow]]ed by surrounding large buildings through a gap temporarily aligned with the position of the [[sun]].

The word is considered by some to have origins in [[Pacific Northwest English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|date= February 8, 2013 |title=Solar neighborhood projects shine in ‘sunbreak’ Seattle|author= Reid Champagne|newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]| url=http://seattletimes.com/html/homesrealestate/2020294008_hresolarhousesxml.html|accessdate=2013-05-29|quote=[I]n this part of the world...sunshine is more frequently reported as “sunbreaks.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art==

Artists such as [[cartoonist]]s and [[filmmaker]]s often use sunbreak to show protection or relief being brought upon an area of land by [[God]] or a receding [[storm]].

The '''up quark''' or '''u quark''' (symbol: u) is the lightest of all [[quark]]s, a type of [[elementary particle]], and a major constituent of [[matter]]. It, along with the [[down quark]], forms the [[neutron]]s (one up quark, two down quarks) and [[proton]]s (two up quarks, one down quark) of [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]]. It is part of the [[generation (physics)|first generation]] of matter, has an [[electric charge]] of +{{sfrac|2|3}}&amp;nbsp;[[elementary charge|''e'']] and a [[Quark#Mass|bare mass]] of {{val|2.3|+0.7|-0.5|ul=MeV/c2}}.&lt;ref name="PDG2012"/&gt;. Like all [[quark]]s, the up quark is an [[elementary particle|elementary]] [[fermion]] with [[spin (physics)|spin]] [[spin-1/2|{{sfrac|1|2}}]], and experiences all four [[fundamental interaction]]s: [[gravitation]], [[electromagnetism]], [[weak interaction]]s, and [[strong interaction]]s. The [[antiparticle]] of the up quark is the '''up antiquark''' (sometimes called ''antiup quark'' or simply ''antiup''), which differs from it only in that some of its properties, such as [[electric charge|charge]] have [[additive inverse|equal magnitude but opposite sign]].

Its existence (along with that of the [[down quark|down]] and [[strange quark]]s) was postulated in 1964 by [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[George Zweig]] to explain the [[Eightfold Way (physics)|Eightfold Way]] classification scheme of [[hadron]]s. The up quark was first observed by experiments at the [[Stanford Linear Accelerator Center]] in 1968.

==History==
In the beginnings of particle physics (first half of the 20th century), [[hadrons]] such as [[proton]]s, [[neutron]]s and [[pion]]s were thought to be [[elementary particle]]s. However, as new hadrons were discovered, the '[[particle zoo]]' grew from a few particles in the early 1930s and 1940s to several dozens of them in the 1950s. The relationships between each of them were unclear until 1961, when [[Murray Gell-Mann]]&lt;ref&gt;

==Mass==
Despite being extremely common, the [[Quark#Mass|bare mass]] of the up quark is not well determined, but probably lies between 1.8 and {{val|3.0|ul=MeV/c2}}.&lt;ref name="PDG2012"/&gt; [[Lattice QCD]] calculations give a more precise value: {{val|2.01|0.14|ul=MeV/c2}}.&lt;ref name=lqcd&gt;{{cite web|last=Cho|first=Adrian|title=Mass of the Common Quark Finally Nailed Down|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2010/04/mass-common-quark-finally-nailed-down|publisher=Science Magazine|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When found in [[meson]]s (particles made of one quark and one [[antiparticle|antiquark]]) or [[baryon]]s (particles made of three quarks), the 'effective mass' (or 'dressed' mass) of quarks [[Quark#Mass|becomes greater]] because of the [[Quantum chromodynamics binding energy|binding energy]] caused by the [[gluon|gluon field]] between each quark (see [[mass–energy equivalence]]). The bare mass of up quarks is so light, it cannot be straightforwardly calculated because relativistic effects have to be taken into account. Due to strong force mediated by gluons in the gluon field, the quarks move at roughly 99.995% of the speed of light, leading to Lorentz factor of roughly 100. As a result, the combined rest mass of quarks is barely 1% of proton or neutron mass.

'''Uranium-236''' is an [[Isotopes of uranium|isotope of uranium]] that is neither [[fissile]] with [[thermal neutron]]s, nor very good [[fertile material]], but is generally considered a nuisance and long-lived [[radioactive waste]]. It is found in [[spent nuclear fuel]] and in the [[reprocessed uranium]] made from spent nuclear fuel.

{{Actinidesvsfissionproducts}}

==Creation and yield==
The [[fissile isotope]] [[uranium-235]] fuels most [[nuclear reactors]]. U-235 that absorbs a [[thermal neutron]] may go one of two ways. About 82% of the time, it will [[nuclear fission|fission]]. About 18% of the time it will not fission, instead emitting [[gamma radiation]] and yielding U-236. Thus, the yield of U-236 per U-235+n reaction is about 18%, and the yield of fissile decay products is about 82%. In comparison, the yields of the most abundant individual [[fission products]] like [[Cs-137]], [[Sr-90]], [[Tc-99]] are between 6% and 7%, and the combined yield of medium-lived (10 years and up) and [[long-lived fission product]]s is about 32%, or a few percent less as some are destroyed by [[neutron capture]].

The second most used fissile isotope [[plutonium-239]] can also fission or not fission on absorbing a thermal neutron. The product [[plutonium-240]] makes up a large proportion of [[reactor-grade plutonium]] (plutonium recycled from spent fuel that was originally made with enriched natural uranium and then used once in an [[LWR]]). Pu-240 decays with a half-life of 6561 years into U-236. In a closed [[nuclear fuel cycle]], most Pu-240 will be fissioned (possibly after more than one neutron capture) before it decays, but Pu-240 discarded as [[nuclear waste]] will decay over thousands of years.

While the largest part of uranium-236 has been produced by neutron capture in nuclear power reactors, it is for the most part stored in nuclear reactors and waste repositories. The most significant contribution to uranium-236 abundance in the environment is the &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U(n,3n)&lt;sup&gt;236&lt;/sup&gt;U reaction by [[fast neutron]]s in [[thermonuclear weapon]]s. The A-bomb testing of the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s has raised the environmental abundance levels significantly above the expected natural levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winkler|first=Stephan|author2=Peter Steier |author3=Jessica Carilli |title=Bomb fall-out 236U as a global oceanic tracer using an annually resolved coral core|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|year=2012|volume=359-360|issue=1|pages=124–130|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2012.10.004|pmid=23564966|pmc=3617727|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X12005638|bibcode=2012E&amp;PSL.359..124W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Destruction and decay==
&lt;sup&gt;236&lt;/sup&gt;U, on absorption of a thermal [[neutron]], does not undergo fission, but becomes &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;U, which quickly [[beta decay]]s to [[neptunium-237|&lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np]]. However, the [[neutron capture]] [[neutron cross-section|cross section]] of &lt;sup&gt;236&lt;/sup&gt;U is low, and this process does not happen quickly in a [[thermal reactor]]. Spent nuclear fuel typically contains about 0.4% U-236. With a much greater [[Cross section (physics)|cross-section]], &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np may eventually absorb another [[neutron]], becoming [[neptunium-238|&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Np]], which quickly [[beta decay]]s to [[plutonium-238]], or fissioning (&lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np is fissile).

&lt;sup&gt;236&lt;/sup&gt;U and most other [[actinides]] are fissionable by [[fast neutron]]s in a [[nuclear bomb]] or a [[fast neutron reactor]]. A small number of fast reactors have been in research use for decades, but widespread use for power production is still in the future.

Uranium-236 [[alpha decay]]s with a [[half-life]] of 23.420 million years to [[thorium-232]]. It is longer-lived than any other artificial [[actinides]] or [[fission products]] produced in the [[nuclear fuel cycle]].
([[Plutonium-244]] which has a half-life of 80 million years is not produced in significant quantity by the [[nuclear fuel cycle]], and the longer-lived [[Uranium-235|U-235]], [[Uranium-238|U-238]], and [[thorium-232]] occur in nature.)

==Difficulty of separation==
Unlike [[plutonium]], [[minor actinides]], [[fission products]], or [[neutron activation|activation products]], chemical processes cannot separate U-236 from [[Uranium-238|U-238]], U-235, [[Uranium-232|U-232]] or other uranium isotopes. It is even difficult to remove with [[isotopic separation]], as low enrichment will concentrate not only the desirable U-235 and [[Uranium-233|U-233]] but the undesirable U-236, [[Uranium-234|U-234]] and U-232. On the other hand, U-236 in the environment cannot separate from U-238 and concentrate separately, which limits its radiation hazard in any one place.

==Contribution to radioactivity of reprocessed uranium==

U-238's halflife is about 190 times as long as U-236; therefore U-236 should have about 190 times as much [[specific activity]]. That is, in reprocessed uranium with 0.5% U-236, the U-236 and U-238 will produce about the same level of [[radioactivity]]. (U-235 contributes only a few percent.)

The ratio is less than 190 when the [[decay products]] of each are included. [[Uranium-238#Radium series|U-238's decay chain]] to [[uranium-234]] and eventually [[lead-206]] involves emission of eight [[alpha particles]] in a time (hundreds of thousands of years) short compared to the halflife of U-238, so that a sample of U-238 in equilibrium with its decay products (as in natural [[uranium ore]]) will have eight times the alpha activity of U-238 alone. Even purified [[natural uranium]] where the post-uranium decay products have been removed will contain an equilibrium quantity of U-234 and therefore about twice the alpha activity of pure U-238. Enrichment to increase U-235 content will increase U-234 to an even greater degree, and roughly half of this U-234 will survive in the spent fuel. On the other hand, U-236 decays to [[thorium-232]] which has a halflife of 14 billion years, equivalent to a decay rate only 31.4% as great as that of U-238.

==Depleted uranium==

[[Depleted uranium]] used in [[kinetic energy penetrator]]s, etc. is supposed to be made from [[uranium enrichment]] tailings that have never been irradiated in a [[nuclear reactor]], not [[reprocessed uranium]]. However, there have been claims that some depleted uranium has contained small amounts of U-236.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2001/unep81.doc.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Village Homes''' is a [[planned community]] in [[Davis, California|Davis]], [[Yolo County]], [[California]]. It is designed to be ecologically sustainable by harnessing the energies and natural resources that exists in the landscape, especially [[stormwater]] and [[solar energy]].

==History==
The principal designer of Village Homes was architect Mike Corbett who began planning in the 1960s, with construction continuing from south to north from the 1970s through the 1980s. Village Homes was completed in 1982, and has attracted international attention from its inception as an early model of an environmentally friendly housing development, including a visit from then-French President [[François Mitterrand]].&lt;ref&gt;Source: [http://www.villagehomesdavis.org About Village Homes]; {{cite web |url=http://arch.ced.berkeley.edu/vitalsigns/workup/siegel_house/vh_bkgd.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 13, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609124520/http://arch.ced.berkeley.edu/vitalsigns/workup/siegel_house/vh_bkgd.html |archivedate=June 9, 2007 |df= }}; Smart Communities, [http://www.smartcommunities.ncat.org/success/village.shtml "Village Homes."]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817204157/http://www.smartcommunities.ncat.org/success/village.shtml |date=August 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainability==
[[File:Grass lined channel NRCS.jpg|thumb|right|Grass lined swale collects rainwater, which then slowly percolates into the soil, where it is protected from runoff and evaporation.]]
The 225 homes and 20 apartment units that now are the Village Homes community use solar panels for heating, and they are oriented around common areas at the rear of the buildings, rather than around the street at the front. All streets are oriented east-west, with all lots positioned north-south. This feature has become standard practice in Davis and elsewhere since it enables homes with passive solar designs to make full use of the sun's energy throughout the year. The development also uses natural drainage, called bioswales, to collect water to irrigate the common areas and support the cultivation of edible foods, such as nut and fruit trees and vegetables for consumption by residents, without incurring the cost of using treated municipal water.&lt;ref&gt;Source: [http://www.villagehomesdavis.org Village Homes, Davis, California]; Bill Browning and Kim Hamilton, [http://www.context.org/iclib/ic35/browning/ "Village Homes: A model solar community proves its worth"]; Smart Communities, Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sustainable energy}}
The '''Éolienne Bollée''' is an [[Special wind turbines|unusual]] [[wind turbine]], unique for having a [[Axial compressor|stator]] and a rotor, as a [[water turbine]] has. The [[eponymous]] invention was first [[patent]]ed in 1868 by Ernest Sylvain Bollée in [[France]]. A further patent dated 1885 differed mainly in two ways: First, in how the [[turbine]] was turned to face the wind and second, in an improvement which increased the flow of wind through the turbine was added. The turbines built according to the 1885 patent were commercially successful.&lt;ref name=Book&gt;The Eolienne Bollée&lt;/ref&gt;

==The windpump business==
Ernest Sylvain Bollée (19 July 1814 – 1891) and Auguste Sylvain Bollée (1847–1906) took out the original patent No. 79985 in 1868 for a "hydraulic wind engine". Ernest Bollée described himself as a [[hydraulic engineer]] in [[Le Mans]], [[Sarthe]]. During the 1860s, due to poor health, Ernest delegated control of the three parts of his business to each of his sons. Auguste was given control of the wind engine manufacturing side of the business. The patent of 1885, with the improvements, is No.167726. In 1898 Auguste sold the business to Édouard-Émile Lebert. Auguste is estimated to have made about 260 Éoliennes.&lt;ref name=Boll&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bollee.fsnet.co.uk/Eolienne/family_en.htm |first=John |last=Walter |year=2003 |publisher=Everything France |work=The Éolienne Bollée |title=What is an Éolienne Bolée…? |accessdate=25 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205135525/http://www.bollee.fsnet.co.uk/Eolienne/family_en.htm |archivedate=February 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lebert passed the business to Gaston Duplay in 1918 and on 1 January 1926 the business passed to the Société Anonyme des Éoliennes Bollée (SAEB). SAEB erected at least three {{convert|7|m|ft|adj=on}} éoliennes. Operations seem to have ceased around 1931.&lt;ref name=Boll/&gt;

==Construction==
[[Image:Roueire Bollée Rotor.jpg|thumb|upright|Close-up view of turbine]]
The Éolienne Bollée was designed to be constructed in a modular form, thus allowing éoliennes of various sizes to be built. The tower could be a standard pylon type, either of triangular or square plan, or a [[cast iron|cast-iron]] column with an external [[Stairway#Spiral and helical stairs|spiral staircase]]. The éoliennes built with this type of tower have a very distinctive appearance. The actual turbine itself consists of two rings, the first being the stator and the second being the rotor. The stator has more blades than the rotor. A new device added to the 1885 patent was a funnel affixed to the stator, enabling the éolienne to capture wind from a larger area than the rotor, and increasing its speed through the turbine. A small [[Windmill fantail|fantail]] operated upwind of the rotor, and through a system of gears turned the turbine to face the wind. Also, through a [[counterweight]] system, it turned the turbine out of wind as the wind speed increased, thus preventing damage in very strong winds, when the éolienne would be edge on into the prevailing wind.&lt;ref name=Book/&gt;

The cast-iron columns were made in {{convert|2.85|m|ftin|adj=on}} sections of {{convert|175|mm|in}} diameter, having twelve cast-iron treads or wrought iron steps forming a complete spiral around the column. A half column was available, allowing éoliennes to be built to any desired height.&lt;ref name=Book/&gt;

==Unique feature==
The Éolienne Bollée is unique amongst other forms of windmill because of the stator. All [[windmill]]s have a [[Turbine|rotor]], whether it is the sails on a traditional windmill or the blades of a modern [[wind turbine]]. The Éolienne Bollée is the only wind-powered turbine where the wind passes through a set of fixed blades (stator) before driving the windmill itself (rotor).

==Operation==
The rotor is turned by the wind, and through a bevel wheel drives a shaft inside the column (if used) or in the centre of the tower. At the lower end this drives a horizontal shaft through a [[gearbox]], which typically drives three throw [[pump]].&lt;ref name=Book/&gt;&lt;ref name=Exp&gt;A pump with three pistons operated by a crankshaft&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sizes==
The éoliennes came in four sizes: {{convert|2.5|m|ftin|adj=on}}, {{convert|3.53|m|ftin|adj=on}}, {{convert|5|m|ftin|adj=on}} and {{convert|7|m|ft|adj=on}} diameter.&lt;ref name=Book/&gt;
:The 2.5 m éolienne has a 24 blade stator and an 18 blade rotor.
:The 3.53 m éolienne has a 34 blade stator and a 24 blade rotor.
:The 5 m éolienne has a 44 blade stator and a 32 blade rotor.

It was claimed that a 3.53 m éolienne with a {{convert|65|mm|in|adj=on}} pump would be able to pump:
*{{convert|1.4|m3|impgal yd3}} of water per hour in a {{convert|4|m/s|mph km/h|adj=on}} wind,
*{{convert|1.8|m3|impgal yd3}} of water per hour in a {{convert|5|m/s|mph km/h|adj=on}} wind,
*{{convert|3|m3|impgal yd3}} of water per hour in a {{convert|6|m/s|mph km/h|adj=on}} wind, and
*{{convert|4|m3|impgal yd3}} of water per hour in a {{convert|7|m/s|mph km/h|adj=on}} wind.&lt;ref name=Book/&gt;

Pumps were available in seven sizes: {{convert|33|mm|in|2|adj=on}}, {{convert|42|mm|in|2|adj=on}}, {{convert|52|mm|in|2|adj=on}}, {{convert|65|mm|in|2|adj=on}}, {{convert|80|mm|in|2|adj=on}}, {{convert|100|mm|in|2|adj=on}}, and {{convert|120|mm|in|2|adj=on}} diameter.&lt;ref name=Book/&gt;&lt;ref name=Boll4&gt;{{cite web | work = The Éolienne Bollée | title = Some details | url = http://www.bollee.fsnet.co.uk/Eolienne/details_en.htm |accessdate=25 January 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080130080240/http://www.bollee.fsnet.co.uk/Eolienne/details_en.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 30 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variation==
[[File:Éolienne Lebert.jpg|thumb|upright|A Lebert Éolienne, Rugles, Eure]]
Lebert built some very similar wind engines with a single rotor, and lacking the stator (thus they were not true turbines). They were either {{convert|7.10|m|ftin}} or {{convert|8.60|m|ftin}} diameter. At least three of these are known to have been built,&lt;ref name=Book/&gt;&lt;ref name=Boll9&gt;{{cite web | work = The Éolienne Bollée | title = Rival wind-engine designs | url = http://www.bollee.fsnet.co.uk/Eolienne/rival_en.htm |accessdate=25 January 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080130080300/http://www.bollee.fsnet.co.uk/Eolienne/rival_en.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 30 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; including at [[Rugles]], [[Eure]] and [[Parigné-l'Évêque]], [[Sarthe]].&lt;ref name=Lebert&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archivingindustry.com/Eolienne/othertopics_en.htm |title=Rival wind-engines |publisher=Archiving Industry |accessdate=31 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clarkson wind engine consisted of a rotor or a number of rotors, one behind the other, revolving in a casing with fixed guide vanes between and of opposite pitch to those of the rotors, and having a further casing to admit a fresh supply of wind to the rotors behind. The cylindrical casings are open at each end with a larger opening facing the wind. The wind catches a number of wheels and feathered vanes fixed to a shaft revolving in bearings inside the casings. When the wind has passed between the vanes of the front wheel it is directed by the guide vanes to the second wheel and is again taken up by guides and passed to a third wheel and so on, the action each time increasing the effect of the wind on the shaft and improving efficiency. The Clarkson of which an illustration survives (1919) was erected by the Air Power Co. of [[Prestwich]], [[Cheshire]] on the estate of Lord Derby. This small engine was designed to work in a {{convert|12|mph|km/h|adj=on}} wind, but could start under load in a wind of only {{convert|7|mph|km/h}}. The wind wheel was only {{convert|5|ft|m|2}} diameter and is designed to lift {{convert|100|impgal|L USgal}} of water per hour to a height of {{convert|50|ft|m|2}} in a {{convert|12|mph|km/h|adj=on}} wind, or double that quantity in a {{convert|15|mph|km/h|adj=on}} wind. All the Air Power wind engines were fitted with roller bearings, a starting and stopping arrangement and an automatic gear to cut off all wind above any desired velocity. They were mounted on a strong steel tower, with a ladder and circular platform.&lt;ref&gt;Cookson, M M (2002) Some Unusual and Little Known Wind Engines, ''Wind and Water Mills, 21, 54 - 63''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purchasers==
In the early years, under the Bollée family, the vast majority of purchasers were [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] and [[gentry]], only six éoliennes being sold to [[municipalities]] by 1888. After Lebert took over, the pattern of sales changed, with more éoliennes being sold for communal water supply, particularly in [[Indre-et-Loire]] and [[Sarthe]] .&lt;ref name=Boll3&gt;{{cite web | work = The Éolienne Bollée website | title = Who bought them… and why? | url = http://www.bollee.fsnet.co.uk/Eolienne/bought_en.htm |accessdate=25 January 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080130080230/http://www.bollee.fsnet.co.uk/Eolienne/bought_en.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 30 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few éoliennes were sold abroad, including two to a [[monastery]] at [[Cowfold]], [[Sussex]]; one to a monastery at [[Tarragona]], [[Spain]]; one to a [[hospital]] in [[Tunisia]]; one to a [[mining|mine]] in [[Brazil]]; and one to [[Cotonou]], [[Benin|Dahomey]].&lt;ref name=Boll3/&gt;

Some éoliennes have survived. In France, the oldest surviving éolienne is at the Bollée bell [[foundry]] in [[Saint-Jean-de-Braye]], near [[Orléans]].&lt;ref name=Boll5&gt;{{cite web | work = The Éolienne Bollée | title = How many remain…? | url = http://www.bollee.fsnet.co.uk/Eolienne/remain_en.htm |accessdate=25 January 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070910145848/http://www.bollee.fsnet.co.uk/Eolienne/remain_en.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 10 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; One is preserved in working order at Épuisay, [[Loir-et-Cher]],&lt;ref name=Moulin&gt;Les Moulins de France, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; and another at the Bollée museum in Orléans.

==An Éolienne Bollée described==
The éolienne at [[Épuisay]] is on a square plan lattice tower of eight sections, {{convert|21|m|ftin}} high. The {{convert|3.53|m|ftin|adj=on}} rotor drives a pump which pumps water from a depth of {{convert|116|m|ftin}}, the pump itself being at a depth of {{convert|35|m|ftin}}. A {{convert|2|hp|kW}} [[petrol engine]] was provided to work the pumps in times of calm. By wind, {{convert|2.5|m3|impgal yd3}} an hour could be pumped.&lt;ref name=Book/&gt;&lt;ref name=Moulin/&gt;
