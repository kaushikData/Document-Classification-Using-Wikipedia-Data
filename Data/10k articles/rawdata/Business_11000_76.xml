==History==
In 2011, the Friends of Privately Owned Public Spaces proposed the creation of a six-block pathway from 51st to 57th Streets that would be mid-block between Sixth and Seventh Avenues to ease pedestrian traffic. The proposal called for connecting [[public spaces]] in the area, that were not known to most pedestrians, into a pedestrian corridor and naming it [[Holly Whyte]] Way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Secret Midtown Passageways Seek More Exposure|url=http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20110427/midtown/secret-midtown-pedestrian-passageways-get-more-exposure-under-new-plan|website=DNAInfo.com|accessdate=July 30, 2012|date=April 27, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717213639/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20110427/midtown/secret-midtown-pedestrian-passageways-get-more-exposure-under-new-plan|archivedate=July 17, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was presented to the [[Manhattan Community Board 5|Community Board 5]] Transportation Committee and the full Community Board 5, then the board sent a formal request to the [[New York City Department of Transportation]] (NYCDOT) in May 2011.&lt;ref name="observer-march"/&gt;

'''Alamance Regional Medical Center''' is a private, not-for-profit 238 bed hospital located in [[Burlington, North Carolina]].  The hospital opened in 1995 on Huffman Mill Road.  Alamance Regional provides healthcare to residents of [[Alamance County, North Carolina]] and surrounding areas.  Alamance Regional joined the [[Cone Health]] network in May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cone Health, Alamance Regional merger gets final approval|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/triad/news/2013/04/26/cone-health-alamance-regional-merger.html|accessdate=26 April 2013|newspaper=Business Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Alamance Regional Medical Center roots began in 1916 with the opening of Rainey Hospital on U.S. 70 east of Burlington.  This hospital was renamed  Alamance General Hospital, Inc., in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Growth of Services: Alamance County|url=http://homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~mwellis/book/chapter19.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A new 100-bed facility would open in 1961 under the name Alamance Memorial Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vincent|first=William Murray|title=Historic Alamance County: An Illustrated History|page=104|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qL3RkMTRx1YC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;lpg=PA104&amp;dq=Alamance+County+hospital+history#v=onepage&amp;q=Alamance%20County%20hospital%20history&amp;f=false|isbn=9781893619982|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alamance County Hospital opened in 1951 on Graham-Hopedale Road.  This hospital was operated by Alamance County until turning private in the 1980s.

The two hospitals remained separate until their boards jointly passed a resolution in 1986 making them subsidiaries of Alamance Health Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vincent|first=William Murray|title=Historic Alamance County: An Illustrated History|page=104|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qL3RkMTRx1YC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;lpg=PA104&amp;dq=Alamance+County+hospital+history#v=onepage&amp;q=Alamance%20County%20hospital%20history&amp;f=false|isbn=9781893619982|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The two outdated facilities were combined into one with the opening of Alamance Regional Medical Center in 1995.

'''Alfonso Valdés Cobián''' &lt;ref group=note&gt;{{Spanish name|''' Valdés'''|'''Cobián'''|plain=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; (June 23, 1890 - February 14, 1988), was an industrialist, banker, sportsman and politician.  Valdés Cobián was a cofounder of [[Cervecería India]], Inc., currently Puerto Rico's largest beer brewery.

==Early years==
Valdés Cobián was born in [[Bayamon, Puerto Rico]] to Ramon and Encarnación Cobián. When he was a child his family moved to the [[United States]] and lived in [[Manhattan]]. While living there he attended the [[Hamilton institute]], a preparatory school, and [[Columbia University]], where he received a degree in electrical engineering in 1911.

The family returned to Puerto Rico and in 1910, his father, Ramón Valdés founded and organized the "Mayaguez Light, Power and Ice Company", a utility in the city of [[Mayagüez]]. The elder Valdés named Alfonso the company's vice president in 1915.&lt;ref name="GT"&gt;Guía del Turismo en Mayagüez, Clásico de Mayagüez "La Cervecería India", (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; The Government took over all power generation in the late 1930s and the company is now operated by "La Autoridad de Energía Eléctrica de Puerto Rico" (The Puerto Rico Electric Energy Authority).

Mayagüez is known as "La Ciudad de las Aguas Puras" (The City of the Pure Waters) because of the quality of its waters. The nickname originated because of the quality of the waters from the [[Yagüez River]]. The word "Yagüez" is [[Taíno language|Taino]] for "Place of pure and clear waters" .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aalcaldespr.com/mayaguez Mayaguez] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212171359/http://aalcaldespr.com/mayaguez |date=2009-02-12 }}, (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; Valdés Cobián's brother Sabino, took a sample of the waters of Mayagüez to the Wallestein Laboratory in New York which confirmed the quality of the waters for the elaboration of beer.&lt;ref name="GT"/&gt;

Valdés Cobián and his brothers, Sabino and [[Ramón Valdés Cobián|Ramón]] decided to build a brewery in Mayagüez and on November 2, 1937, they founded the [[Compañía Cervecera de Puerto Rico]] which was later renamed Cervecería India. The company competed with two other native beer breweries, "Real" and "Corona" (no relation to the Mexican beer), which no longer exist. Valdés Cobián, as chairman and president, successfully led his company converting it into Puerto Rico's largest beer brewery and manufacture of canned and bottled soft drinks.&lt;ref name="GT"/&gt;

Besides his chairmanship of Cervecería India, Valdés Cobián held the [[Orange Crush]] soft-drink franchise and was president of the Ana Maria Sugar Company and the Insular Feed Mill. For 25 years he was the major stockholder and board chairman of the [[Banco Crédito y Ahorro Ponceño (building)|Banco Credito y Ahorro Ponceno]],&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; which at the time was the second largest bank in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.primerahora.com/noticia/otras_panorama/noticias/popular_se_agiganta/98500 "Popular se agiganta" - Primera Hora], (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Team owner==

Valdés Cobián was a founder of the Puerto Rican winter baseball league and owned the [[Indios de Mayagüez]] (Mayagüez Indians),&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; the most successful team in the history of the Puerto Rican League.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Indios_de_Mayag%C3%BCez Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; The team was founded in 1938, and once the [[Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League]] (LBPPR in Spanish) was created, the Mayagüez team became a part of it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://1800beisbol.com/baseball/Deportes/Beisbol_Puerto_Rico/Historia_Beisbol_de_Puerto_Rico/ Historia Beisbol de Puerto Rico] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316221252/http://www.1800beisbol.com/baseball/Deportes/Beisbol_Puerto_Rico/Historia_Beisbol_de_Puerto_Rico/ |date=2008-03-16 }}, (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; A management team led by Valdés Cobián owned the team during its initial years.

==Politician==
Valdés Cobián was elected in 1917 to the [[Puerto Rico House of Representatives]] representing the district of Mayagüez, position in which he served until 1928. In 1928 he won his first of three terms as a member of the [[Senate of Puerto Rico]], and also became president of the Puerto Rican Republican Party.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

==Later years==
In 1960 he was president of the [[Puerto Rico Manufacturers Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | title = About Puerto Rico Manufacturers Association  | publisher = Puerto Rico Manufacturers Association  | url = http://www.prma.com/AM/Template.cfm?Section=About_PRMA&amp;Template=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=3035  | accessdate = October 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Valdés Cobián lived in Villa Caparra, a San Juan suburb. On February 8, 1988, Valdés Cobián died in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], after suffering a heart attack two days earlier, at the age of 98. Valdés Cobián was buried in Bayamón's Porta Coeli Cemetery. He was survived by his wife, Grace García, whom he married on August 14, 1939, two daughters, Grace Marie, Encarnita Quinlan and a son, Alfonso Jr., and five grandchildren.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; After his death, his wife became the president of brewery until her retirement in 2002, when her granddaughter, [[Camalia Valdés]] assumed the presidency of the company.

==Legacy==
The City of Mayagüez honored his memory by naming the street where the Cervecería India Inc. is located Avenida (Blvd.) Alfonso Valdez.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/product-compint-0001152283-page.html Company profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization assists the government in managing China's private economy and acts as a bridge between the private sector and the government.&lt;ref name="chinachamber1"&gt;[http://www.chinachamber.org.cn/publicfiles/business/htmlfiles/qleng/s2569/index.html About US]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Core functions ==
The core responsibilities of the ACFIC are to:&lt;ref name="chinachamber1"/&gt;

* Represent the legitimate rights of its members and to extend their proposals and requirements to government;
* Provide members with services in training, financing, technology, legal consultation and information, and to resolve the difficulties and problems they are facing;
* Build closer relationships with foreign commercial and industrial entities;
* Help members to go overseas for business opportunities and contribute to China’s economic reforms.

== Structure ==
The agency is structured into the following departments:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinachamber.org.cn/publicfiles/business/htmlfiles/qleng/s2578/index.html About US]&lt;/ref&gt;
* General Office
* Department of Research
* Department of Membership
* Department of Publicity and Education
* Department of Economic Service
* Department of Poverty Relief and Social Service
* Department of International Liaison

== Leadership ==
Since November 2002, the ACFIC has been led by Chairman [[Huang Mengfu]] ({{zh |s = 黄孟复 }}), who, like his predecessors, is also a vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, ranking as a [[Political position ranking of the People's Republic of China|national leader of China]]. His predecessor was [[Jing Shuping]], founder of the [[Minsheng Bank|first private bank]] in modern China and the son of a well-known entrepreneur of the later Qing Dynasty.

First vice-chairman of the ACFIC is [[Quan Zhezhu]] (Jeon Cheol-su)({{zh |s = 全哲洙 }}), a deputy minister of the United Front Department of the [[CPC Central Committee]] originally from [[Jilin]]. ACFIC has another 23 vice-chairpersons, most of them private entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinachamber.org.cn/publicfiles/business/htmlfiles/qleng/s2579/index.html ACFIC Leaders]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional federations==
More than 3,000 regional federations of industry and commerce (FIC) have been established in all [[Provinces of China|provinces]] and [[Prefectures of China|prefectures]] and most [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China|counties]] of China. As of 2009, they listed a combined membership of 2.6 million private enterprises. The relationship between ACFIC and the regional FIC is described as a role of guidance, but the statute of ACFIC is also valid for the regional federations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acfic.org.cn/publicfiles/business/htmlfiles/qggsl/gsljj/index.html ACFIC Website (in Chinese)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Auckland Chamber of Commerce''' (The Chamber) is a [[New Zealand]] [[business network]] representing the interests of [[business]]es in the [[Auckland]] region.  It is a [[Non-Governmental Organisation]]. Founded in 1856, the Chamber is intended to "inspire and influence business vitality".&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aucklandchamber.co.nz/About-Us.aspx |title=About Us |publisher=aucklandchamber.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, the Chamber claims a membership of 12,000 business owners.

==History==
The Chamber was founded in 1856, at a meeting of merchants on 24 January,&lt;ref name="McLintock1966"&gt;{{cite book|last=McLintock|first=Alexander H.|title=An encyclopaedia of New Zealand|year=1966|publisher=R. E. Owen, Govt. printer|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; during a period of [[economic depression]]. Active in the 1860s, the Chamber floundered somewhat before an 1869 reorganisation that opened its ranks to a wider variety of merchants, on an annual subscription basis.&lt;ref name="McLintock1966"/&gt;

Following its inception it focused on issues ranging from remedying trade abuses and obtaining adequate facilities for businesses, to standardization of grain weights and simplifying the customs tariff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8335993 |title=A Century of Auckland Commerce: 1856–1956; A History of the Auckland Chamber of Commerce. |publisher=journals.cambridge.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core Activities==
The Chamber hosts events and training courses. As at 14 May 2013, courses offered included 'Organisational Mentoring', 'Customer Service Skills', 'Accounting for Non-Accountants' and 'Successful Business Communication'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chamber.federationmedia.com/Events.aspx |title=Events |publisher=aucklandchamber.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chamber also maintains a media presence predominantly through its Chief Executive Officer, Michael Barnett, who has commented on topics including Auckland Transport,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/opinion/news/article.cfm?c_id=466&amp;objectid=10883389 |title=Leadership can unlock the roadblocks |publisher=nzherald.co.nz |date= 2013-05-14|accessdate=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water Charges,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10878745 |title=Water charges cause ripples |publisher=nzherald.co.nz |date= 2013-04-21|accessdate=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Council Rates &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/small-business/8666382/Rate-increase-threatens-business |title=Rate increase threatens business |publisher=stuff.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and the National Convention Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/134994/convention-centre-design-needs-council-sign-off |title=Convention centre design needs council sign-off |publisher=radionz.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chamber seeks to provide work opportunities to jobseekers through such initiatives as the CadetMax programme, with the New Zealand [[New Zealand Ministry of Social Development|Ministry of Social Development]], and the New Kiwis, with [[Immigration New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.msd.govt.nz/about-msd-and-our-work/publications-resources/corporate/regional-plans/2009-10/auckland/young-people.html |title=Young people |publisher=msd.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aucklandchamber.co.nz/Find-Staff/EmploymentProgrammes.aspx |title=Employment Programmes |publisher=aucklandchamber.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2013-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627185944/http://aucklandchamber.co.nz/Find-Staff/EmploymentProgrammes.aspx |archivedate=2013-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newkiwis.co.nz/ |title=New Kiwis |publisher=newkiwis.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bank of America Plaza''' is a 72-story, {{convert|280.7|m|abbr=on}} [[Modern architecture|late-modernist]] [[skyscraper]] located in the [[Main Street District, Dallas|Main Street District]] in the city's [[Downtown Dallas|downtown core]] in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], United States. It is the tallest skyscraper in the city, the [[Tallest buildings in Texas|3rd tallest in Texas]] and the [[Tallest buildings in the United States|32nd tallest in the United States]]. It contains {{convert|1900000|sqft|abbr=on}} of office space. The building was designed by JPJ Architects and developed by [[Bramalea (company)|Bramalea Limited]] of Toronto. The original owner was a joint venture arrangement including Prudential Insurance, Bramalea Limited, and First National Bank of Dallas under parent company InterFirst Corporation.&lt;ref name="texashistorical"&gt;{{cite web | last=Seidel |first=Jeff | title=Interfirst Corporation | url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/coi01 |website=Texas State Historical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Construction commenced in 1983 and the tower was completed in 1985.

== History ==
The building was designed by JPJ Architects and developed by Bramalea Limited of Toronto. The original owner was a joint venture arrangement including Prudential Insurance, Bramalea Limited, and First National Bank of Dallas under parent company InterFirst Corporation.&lt;ref name="texashistorical"/&gt; Construction commenced in 1982 and the tower was completed in 1985.

The development was originally called the Dallas Main Center, but has taken many names over its short history.  Upon opening the tower was called InterFirst Bank Plaza and has been renamed several times because of the mergers and acquisitions in the banking industry. In 1986 the tower was renamed [[First Republic Bank Corporation|First Republic Bank]] Plaza after InterFirst Corporation's merger with Republic Bank Corporation.  First Republic Corporation later failed and was sold in 1988 to Charlotte-based North Carolina National Bank by the [[Resolution Trust Corporation]] becoming NCNB Texas.  The tower was renamed [[North Carolina National Bank|NCNB]] Plaza.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} In 1991, in order to reflect its growing national portfolio NCNB rebranded themselves and the tower took the name [[NationsBank]] Plaza, and finally the building was renamed [[Bank of America]] Plaza in 1998 after NationsBank acquired San Francisco-based Bank of America and taking their name and operating under their charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.dallasnews.com/business/business/2015/04/14/dallas-green-building-turns-30-with-a-storied-past-to-match-its-height|title=Dallas’ green building turns 30 with a storied past to match its height}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==

===Architecture===

Original plans for the development, initially called Dallas Main Center, called for two 72-story towers, a 600-room hotel, and a parking garage. Original designs for the tower were capped with stepped pyramid crowns and were initially intended to be clad in a silver glazing with gold accent band curtain wall. In order to gain FAA approval to build the tower, the stepped pyramid was removed. Another design change altered the [[Curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]] materials, which were replaced with blue glazing and grey marble accent bands.&lt;ref name="bizbeatblog.dallasnews.com"&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Blogs Dallas Morning News Dallas' Tallest Tower was Always Planned as a Skyline Standout | url=http://bizbeatblog.dallasnews.com/2013/05/downtown-dallas-tallest-tower-was-always-planned-as-a-skyline-standout.html/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the collapse of the price for oil, real estate, and banking industry in Texas in the mid-eighties, the twin tower and hotel were never completed. The hotel site remains a surface parking lot, and the site of the second 72-story tower was purchased by the City of Dallas after a 2006 bond election. The surface parking lot was converted into [[Belo Garden Park]].

=== Lighting ===
[[File:Dallas Bank of America Plaza top night.jpg|thumb|left|Lighting at night.]]
The building's facetted facade is accented at night by nearly {{convert|2|mile|km|0}} of green [[argon]] lighting running primarily at the edges and corners of the tower. Green was chosen over red or blue because it is more visible from a distance.  It has also been reported that the second tower, if built would have been accented with purple lighting.

Several months later, many of the argon tubes had burnt out due to a combination of several high voltage phenomena--one of which is referred to as the "corona effect" that discharges high voltage at the ends of the tube connections burning them out. After an intensive study, the developer shut down the entire lighting system and replaced it with a "mid-point grounded" system and larger, 18 mm tubes.  Cold temperatures continued to plague the replacement system's performance.

In a renovation project that began in May 2013, the original green argon lighting was replaced with multi-colored LED tubes. The renovations were 90 percent complete by November 14, 2013, when the LED outline was showcased at the re-lighting ceremony. This was made possible by Innovative Lighting in Irving, and Turner Construction.&lt;ref name="bizbeatblog.dallasnews.com"/&gt;

===Art===
[[File:View from Reunion Tower August 2015 20.jpg|thumb|150px|Bank of America Plaza as viewed from [[Reunion Tower]] in August 2015]]
[[Alexander Liberman]]'s sculpture "Venture" (1985) was located in the front plaza of the building until April 2013.  The {{convert|38|ft|m|adj=on}} tall sculpture is composed of twelve wide steel tubes of approximately 1” thickness cut into various lengths and stacked end-to-end and painted red.  The current building owners removed the sculpture to make room for a valet parking entry to the building.  The sculpture was donated to the City of Dallas in hopes that it would soon be relocated and on display as part of the city's 300-piece public art program.

During the 2013 renovation of the building's lighting, the nearby OMNI Hotel's LED system was host to the 2nd edition of the Video Association of Dallas' EXPANDED CINEMA video exhibition. One work in the program, "Ar City" by Dallas-based artist Michael A. Morris, poetically addressed the transition from the argon lighting to the new LED system, drawing attention to the absence of the green light on the skyline by reproducing the color with the OMNI's lights and musing on the uses of liquid argon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Raquel Chapa | title=Ar City, Dallas VideoFest | url=http://videofest.org/2013/09/ar-city/#.U3-fYFhdWy9/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Michael A. Morris | title=Ar City | url=https://vimeo.com/85507288/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Mona Kasra | url=http://videofest.org/expanded-cinema-multiplicity/#.U3-mqFhdWy9/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Broadcast and communications center ===
The top two floors function as a broadcast communications tower using the building itself as a broadcast tower structure. ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX and The CW operate television transmission facilities on the 72nd floor and 74th level roof as well as most federal law enforcement agencies. All point-to-point [[microwave]] and fixed-service antennas are concealed within a specifically designed glass communications [[parapet]] on the top floor. The base of the 73rd floor parapet opens to the 72nd floor data and communications center below allowing for easy and safe access during installation and servicing of wireless devices. It also protects the hardware from weather. The building operates a sophisticated in-building distributed antenna system as well as a shared tenant data center. James Chiles designed this facility in 1985 one year prior to his rooftop antenna design of [[Renaissance Tower (Dallas)|Renaissance Tower]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;http://interchange.puc.state.tx.us/WebApp/Interchange/Documents/45683_1_884257.PDF &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amateur radio]] operators also install repeater systems on this building.

====Floor directory====
The 72nd-73rd floor is house to the broadcasting and communication and it is used for television facilities including FOX, ABC, CNN and TBS. Access to the 73rd floor is used for the shuttle elevator that transfers to the 70th and 71st floors respectively.

The express elevator takes you to the 70th floor, which houses the observatory. It sends you from the Lower lobby to level 70 in about 40 seconds.

13 is considered an unlucky number in the North American culture, so what would have been the lobby is used as the 3rd floor. The 5th floor was replaced by level 4 that is compensate for the skipped floor number which considers that 13 skipped at that time.

The lower level contains retail such as shops and restaurants and it also connects to the underground.

The double deck elevator is used to serve both odd and even floors.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==In popular culture==
Exterior shots of the building were used as the home of JRE Industries in Season 11 of the 1980s television series ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Dallas locations - buildings used in the series | url=http://www.ultimatedallas.com/episodeguide/locations3.html | work=Ultimate Dallas  | year=2010 | accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''businessperson''' (also '''businessman''' or '''businesswoman''') is a person involved in the [[business sector]] – in particular someone undertaking activities ([[commerce|commercial]] or [[industry|industrial]]) for the purpose of generating [[cash flow]], [[sales]], and [[revenue]] utilizing a combination of [[Human capital|human]], [[Financial capital|financial]], [[intellectual capital|intellectual]] and [[physical capital]] with a view to fuelling [[economic development]] and [[Economic growth|growth]].&lt;ref&gt;

 |quote= businessman[:] A person who is employed by an organization or company. Businessmen are often associated with white collar jobs. In order to avoid sexism or the perpetuation of stereotypes, the term is often replaced with "businessperson". The term "businesswoman" is less commonly used.

&lt;/ref&gt;
An [[entrepreneur]] is an example of a businessperson.

The term "businessperson" may refer to a founder, owner, or majority shareholder of a [[commercial enterprise]]; or it can characterize a high-level [[senior management|executive]] who does the everyday running and management of a [[company]] even if that executive is not the owner.&lt;ref&gt;

The term may sometimes refer to someone who is involved in an upper-level [[management]] role in a [[corporation]], company, enterprise, firm, [[organization]], or agency.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==History==
===Prehistoric period: Traders===
Since a "businessman" can mean anyone in industry or commerce,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.audioenglish.org/dictionary/businessman.htm | title=BUSINESSMAN | publisher=Audioenglish | accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; businessmen have existed as long as industry and commerce have existed. "Commerce" can simply mean "[[trade]]", and trade has existed through all of [[recorded history]]. The first businessmen in human history were traders or [[merchants]].

===Medieval period: Rise of the merchant class===
Merchants emerged as a "[[class (social)|class]]" in [[medieval Italy]]. Between 1300 and 1500, modern [[accounting]], the [[bill of exchange]], and [[limited liability]] were invented, and thus the world saw "the first true bankers", who are certainly businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=J.M.|title=The Penguin History of the World, Sixth Edition|year=2013|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|pages=506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time, Europe saw the "emergence of rich merchants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=J.M.|title=The Penguin History of the World, Sixth Edition|year=2013|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|pages=509}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "rise of the merchant class" came as Europe "needed a middleman" for the first time, and these "burghers" or "[[bourgeois]]" were the people who played this role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=J.M.|title=The Penguin History of the World, Sixth Edition|year=2013|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|pages=510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance to Enlightenment: Rise of the capitalist===
Europe became the dominant global commercial power in the 16th century, and as Europeans developed new tools for business, new types of business people began to use those tools. In this period, Europe developed and used [[banknote|paper money]], [[cheque|cheques]], and [[joint-stock companies]] (and their shares of [[stock]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=J.M.|title=The Penguin History of the World, Sixth Edition|year=2013|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|pages=558}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developments in [[actuarial science]] led to [[insurance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=J.M.|title=The Penguin History of the World, Sixth Edition|year=2013|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|pages=559}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, these new tools were used by a new kind of businessman, the [[capitalist]]. These people owned or financed businesses as [[bankers]], but they were not merchants of goods. These capitalists were a major force in the [[Industrial Revolution]]...

===Modern period: Rise of the manager===
The newest kind of businessperson is the [[manager]]. One of the first true managers was [[Robert Owen]] (1771–1858), an industrialist in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drucker|first=Peter|title=Management, Revised Edition|year=2008|publisher=Collins Business|location=New York|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied the "problems of [[productivity]] and [[motivation]]", and was followed by [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]], who was the first person who studied [[work (project management)|work]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drucker|first=Peter|title=Management, Revised Edition|year=2008|publisher=Collins Business|location=New York|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War I]], management became popular due to the example of [[Herbert Hoover]] and the [[Harvard Business School]], which offered [[MBA|degrees in business administration]] (management).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drucker|first=Peter|title=Management, Revised Edition|year=2008|publisher=Collins Business|location=New York|pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Salary==
Salaries for businesspeople vary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/business-and-financial/home.htm |title=Business and Financial Occupations |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Bureau of Labor and Statistics |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor|access-date=2015-09-18 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/management/ |title=Management Occupations |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Bureau of Labor and Statistics |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor|access-date=2015-09-18 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The salaries of the top CEOs can be millions of dollars per year.

Some leading business theorists look to leaders in academic research on business or to successful business leaders for guidance. Collectively, these people are called "[[business guru]]s."

'''Charles May Oelrichs''' (August 27, 1858 – January 15, 1932)&lt;ref name="CMOObit1932"/&gt; was an American broker and clubman who was prominent in New York society during the [[Gilded Age]].

==Early life==
Oelrichs was born on August 27, 1858 in [[Baltimore, Maryland]].  He was the son of German born Henry Ferdinand Oelrichs (1810–1875), a senior partner in the firm of Oelrichs &amp; Lurman, and Julia Matilda ([[née]] May) Oelrichs (1819–1879), who was born in [[Washington, DC]].  His siblings included [[Hermann Oelrichs]], an agent of [[Hapag-Lloyd|Norddeutsche Lloyd]] shipping who married [[Theresa Fair Oelrichs|Theresa Alice Fair]], daughter of [[United States Senator]] and [[Comstock Lode]] millionaire [[James Graham Fair]]; and Henry Oelrichs.  Upon his brother's death in 1906, Charles inherited the bulk of his estate.&lt;ref name="1906Inheritance"&gt;{{cite news |title=NOTHING FOR WIFE OF OELRICHS. Clubman's Will Says Her Fortune is Ample--Estate is for Brother and Sister |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SFC19060911.2.24 |accessdate=28 June 2018 |work=[[San Francisco Call]] |date=11 September 1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oelrichs was the grandson of Gesche Catharina (née Holler) Oelrichs and Johann Gerhard Oelrichs, a [[German people|German]] merchant in [[Bremen]].  The Oelrichs came to America from Bremen around 1830.&lt;ref name="CMOObit1932"/&gt;  His grandfather later married a daughter of statesman [[Harrison Gray Otis (politician)|Harrison Gray Otis]].  His maternal grandparents were Julia Matilda (née Slacum) May and Frederick May, who was a member of the May family, prominent in Virginia and Maryland during the [[American Revolutionary War]].&lt;ref name="CMOObit1932"/&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Blanche Oelrichs, between 1910 and 1915.jpg|thumb|right|Charles' daughter, Blanche Oelrichs, between 1910 and 1915]]
In his youth, Charles was an amateur cowboy on a ranch near [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]] where "he 'punched' cows, 'broke' bronchos, and lassoed bulls."&lt;ref name="CMOObit1932"/&gt;

Oelrichs then entered business, becoming a member of the [[New York Stock Exchange]] with the firm E. C. Potter Co.  The firm was later known as C. M. Oelrichs &amp; Co.,  which was in business for sixteen years until his retirement in 1912.&lt;ref name="CMOObit1932"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6655">'''Chief economist''' is a single-position job class having primary responsibility for the development, coordination, and production of [[economic]] and [[financial]] analysis. It is distinguished from the other [[economist]] positions by the broader scope of responsibility encompassing the planning, supervision, and coordination of the economic research.

==Synopsis==

The chief economist is a supervisory and leading class with substantial responsibility for the exercise of independent judgement in employing, disciplining, or adjudicating grievances of subordinates.

Chief economists work primarily in [[bank]]s and [[government]] institutions. They are also common in economic research units from university departments; economics, business, and finance publications; and other research bodies in economics.  By the 2010s, the chief economist position was established at large [[Dot com company|internet companies]] such as [[Google]] and [[Microsoft]].&lt;ref name="depillis2014" /&gt;  Further, a trend began in data and financial services companies to utilize chief economists in customer- and media-facing roles to help in placing data in a larger economic context.&lt;ref name="depillis2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="praefke2009"&gt;{{cite web | author=Praefke, Kenneth | title=Når man får drømmejobbet ved et tilfælde |trans-title=When you get your dream job by chance&lt;!--google translate--&gt; | date=26 April 2009 | website=Altandetlige.dk | publisher=[[University of Copenhagen]] | language=da | url=http://altandetlige.dk/fagligt/ulrikke-ekelund-droemmejobbet-ved-tilfaelde.htm | quote=For de kan forklare komplicerede økonomiske emner på en enkel måde, som journalisterne sjældent selv evner.

==Government positions==
In the European Union (EU), the post of Chief Economist (''aka'' Chief Competition Economist) was created in 2003 as part of the [[European Commission]], reporting to the [[Director General for Competition]].&lt;ref name="gonzdiaz2012" /&gt;  This role is primarily focused on advising around the application of EU competition rules and providing input to legal cases before the European Courts.&lt;ref name="gonzdiaz2012" /&gt;

In Kenya, {{as of|1998|lc=y}},&lt;ref group=nt&gt;A new [[Constitution of Kenya|Kenyan Constitution]] was ratified in 2010, likely significantly revising the roles and organization of the government.&lt;/ref&gt; the role of chief economist was expressed as "Chief Economist/Statistician" and resided in the [[Ministry of Planning and National Development]], one responsibility of which was to lead "a planning department or the [[Central Bureau of Statistics (Kenya)|Central Bureau of Statistics]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | work=[[Kenya Gazette]] | page=1105 | volume=100 | issue=34 | date=19 June 1998 | id=Gazette Notice No. 3001 | title=Vacancies Offered by Public Service Commission of Kenya | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Lcb_XlPsUUC&amp;lpg=PA1106&amp;dq=Chief%20economist&amp;pg=PA1095#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | via=[[Google Books]] | oclc=3156440  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States government, there are several Offices of the Chief Economist for different departments.  For instance, the Office of the Chief Economist within the [[United States Department of State]] was first staffed in March 2012 by Heidi Crebo-Rediker,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/e/oce/ |date=2 July 2012&lt;!--archive date--&gt; |title=Office of the Chief Economist |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702142216/http://www.state.gov/e/oce/ |archivedate=July 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Office of the Chief Economist within the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] is led, {{as of|2014|lc=y}}, by Joseph W. Glauber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.usda.gov/oce/about_oce/leadership.htm | accessdate=4 January 2015 | title=Leadership | website=Office of the Chief Economist | publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{As of|2014}}, the chief economist for the US State Department is Rodney D. Ludema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/e/oce/ |accessdate=4 January 2015 |title=Office of the Chief Economist |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702142216/http://www.state.gov/e/oce/ |archivedate=2 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the Office of the Chief Economist reports and advises on international trade and economic issues, including global, regional and sectoral trends and developments; and undertakes trade and economic research and analysis in support of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada's various functions: trade and investment policy, including negotiation of international agreements; international business development; and trade litigation. The post-holders are civil servants responsible to the [[Minister of International Trade]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international.gc.ca/economist-economiste/index.aspx?lang=eng international.gc.ca: "Office of the Chief Economist"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Export Development Canada]] and [[Business Development Canada]] both have Chief Economists too.

The '''Comptroller General of the United States''' is the director of the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO, formerly known as the General Accounting Office), a [[legislative branch]] agency established by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1921 to ensure the fiscal and managerial accountability of the federal government.  The [[Budget and Accounting Act of 1921]] "created an establishment of the Government to be known as the General Accounting Office, which shall be independent of the executive departments and under the control and direction of the Comptroller General of the United States"&lt;ref&gt;[[Budget and Accounting Act of 1921]], Sec. 301&lt;/ref&gt;. The act also provided that the "Comptroller General shall investigate, at the seat of government or elsewhere, all matters relating to the receipt, disbursement, and application of public funds, and shall make to the President when requested by him, and to Congress... recommendations looking to greater economy or efficiency in public expenditures."&lt;ref&gt;[[Budget and Accounting Act of 1921]], Sec. 312(a)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bulk.resource.org/gao.gov/67-13/00001A37.pdf |title=Budget and Accounting Act, 1921 Public Law 67-13 |work=GAO Office |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506152510/http://bulk.resource.org/gao.gov/67-13/00001A37.pdf |archivedate=2010-05-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/31/usc_sup_01_31_08_I_10_7_20_II.html |title = General Powers and Duties of the GAO (31 USC 711 to 31 USC 720) Cornell Law LII|accessdate=2010-04-11 |work= GAO Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Comptroller]] General is appointed for fifteen years by the [[President of the United States]] with the advice and consent of the [[United States Senate|Senate]] per {{usc|31|703}}.  Also per {{usc|31|703}} when the office of Comptroller General is to become vacant the current Comptroller General must appoint an executive or employee of the GAO to serve as the Acting Comptroller General until such time as a new Comptroller General is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.

The Comptroller General has the responsibility to audit the financial statements that the [[Secretary of the Treasury]] and the Director of the [[Office of Management and Budget]] present to the Congress and the President. For every fiscal year since 1996, when consolidated financial statements began, the Comptroller General has refused to endorse the accuracy of the consolidated figures for the federal budget, citing "(1) serious financial management problems at the Department of Defense, (2) the federal government’s inability to adequately account for and reconcile intragovernmental activity and balances between federal agencies, and (3) the federal government’s ineffective process for preparing the consolidated financial statements."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Statement of the Comptroller General of the United States|date=December 17, 2007|url=http://www.fms.treas.gov/fr/07frusg/07gao1.pdf|publisher=Comptroller General of the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current Comptroller General is [[Eugene Louis Dodaro]], who became Comptroller General on December 22, 2010.  He was preceded by [[David M. Walker (U.S. Comptroller General)|David M. Walker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gao.gov/about/history/goodgov.html |title= GAO History, 1921-2008 |accessdate=2007-07-30 |work= GAO Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 15, 2008, David Walker, then Comptroller General announced that he was resigning from GAO to head [[The Peter G. Peterson Foundation]]. Eugene Louis Dodaro became Acting Comptroller General of the United States on March 13, 2008, and was subsequently appointed by the President on September 22, 2010, and confirmed by the Senate on December 22, 2010, as the Comptroller General. Dodaro was sworn in as Comptroller General at a ceremony at the GAO on December 30, 2010.

He is the founder and former editor of  ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]'' magazine.

==Early life and education==
Goodhart is one of seven children born to Valerie Forbes Winant (the niece of [[John Gilbert Winant]]) and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP [[Philip Goodhart|Sir Philip Goodhart]].&lt;ref name=TelegraphObit&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11720720/Sir-Philip-Goodhart-politician-obituary.html|title=Sir Philip Goodhart, politician - obituary|date=6 July 2015|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://announcements.telegraph.co.uk/deaths/175739/goodhart Daily Telegraph: "Valerie Forbes Winant died peacefully on April 1st aged 88"] retrieved 30 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He is a great-great-grandson of [[Mayer Lehman]], co-founder of Lehman Brothers.

==Career==
Goodhart was a correspondent for the ''[[Financial Times]]'' for 12 years; for part of the period he was stationed in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ideasfestival.co.uk/2013/events/david-goodhart/ David Goodhart] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622045557/http://www.ideasfestival.co.uk/2013/events/david-goodhart/ |date=2013-06-22 }} ideasfestival.co.uk (Bristol Festival of Ideas), retrieved 1 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=45693|title=Prospect eyes 50,000 sales as Goodhart moves on|publisher=Press Gazette|accessdate=7 September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616112241/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=45693|archivedate=16 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He founded ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]'', a British [[current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] magazine in 1995 and was the editor until 2010, when he became editor-at-large.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Dowell: [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jun/07/david-goodhart-prospect-editor David Goodhart to step down as Prospect editor] The Guardian, 7 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In December, 2011, he was appointed Director of the London-based think tank [[Demos (UK think tank)|Demos]].&lt;ref&gt;Demos, Press release: [http://www.demos.co.uk/press_releases/davidgoodhartdirector David Goodhart joins Demos as Director] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320104221/http://demos.co.uk/press_releases/davidgoodhartdirector |date=2013-03-20 }} demos.co.uk (homesite), retrieved 1 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017 he is Head of the Demography, Immigration and Integration Unit at the think tank [[Policy Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://policyexchange.org.uk/author/david-goodhart/|website=Policy Exchange|publisher=Policy Exchange|accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has written for ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Independent]]'' and ''[[The Times]]''. He has presented documentaries for [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Analysis (radio programme)|Analysis]]'' programme on immigration (in 2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goodhart|first=David|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8494275.stm | work=BBC News | title=Transforming Britain by accident?| date=8 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on [[Blue Labour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goodhart|first=David|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/david-goodhart-labour-can-have-its-own-coalition-too-2246971.html|title=Labour can have its own coalition too|work=The Independent on Sunday|date=20 March 2011|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has written of the influence on his thinking of people like [[Maurice Glasman, Baron Glasman|Maurice Glasman]], who coined the term Blue Labour.&lt;ref name=="Goodhart2017"/&gt;

==Opinions==
Goodhart first wrote that "sharing and solidarity can conflict with diversity", in an essay "Too diverse?" published by ''Prospect'' in February 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goodhart|first=David|url=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/too-diverse-david-goodhart-multiculturalism-britain-immigration-globalisation|title=Too diverse?|work=Prospect|date=February 2004|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In deviating from liberal orthodoxy, he caused a stir at the time.&lt;ref name=="Goodhart2017"/&gt; [[Trevor Phillips]], then chairman of the [[Commission for Racial Equality]], described such arguments as being those of "liberal Powellites", after the Conservative politician [[Enoch Powell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Phillips|first=Trevor|authorlink=Trevor Phillips|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/feb/16/race.equality|title=Genteel xenophobia is as bad as any other kind|work=The Guardian|date=16 February 2004|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''The British Dream: Successes and Failures of Post-war Immigration'' (2013), Goodhart argues that high immigration can undermine national solidarity and be a threat to [[social democratic]] ideals about a [[welfare state]]. He advocates that immigration to the United Kingdom should be reduced and more emphasis put on [[Social integration|integrating]] immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/immigration-why-the-public-is-right-8552901.html Immigration: why the public is right] [[London Evening Standard]], 28 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Goodhart: [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/27/why-left-wrong-mass-immigration#start-of-comments Why the left is wrong about immigration] [[The Guardian]], 27 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Road to Somewhere'' was published in 2017. A fault line in Britain existed, he suggested, between Somewhere, those people firmly connected to a specific community which consists of about half the population, "Inbetweeners", and Anywhere, those usually living in cities, socially liberal and well educated; the latter being only a minority of about 20% to 25% of the total, but in fact had "over-ruled" the attitudes of the majority.&lt;ref name="Freedland"&gt;{{cite news|last=Freedland|first=Jonathan|authorlink=Jonathan Freedland|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/22/the-road-to-somewhere-david-goodhart-populist-revolt-future-politics|title=The Road to Somewhere by David Goodhart – a liberal’s rightwing turn on immigration|work=The Guardian|date=22 March 2017|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Freedland]] in ''The Guardian'' believed it could be argued [[New Labour]] had actually often had the Somewheres in mind in policies espousing a "[[Anti-social behaviour order|Asbo culture]]" and the "prison works" attitude which they continued from [[Michael Howard]]'s earlier period as Home Secretary.&lt;ref name="Freedland"/&gt;

==Personal==
David Goodhart is married to ''Financial Times'' journalist [[Lucy Kellaway]]; they have four children,&lt;ref name="FT_20100907"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/comment/columnists/lucykellaway|title=Lucy Kellaway|work=[[Financial Times]]|accessdate=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but separated in 2015.&lt;ref name="FT_20151025"&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=[[Financial Times]] | author = [[Lucy Kellaway]] | date = October 25, 2015 | title = Divorce can galvanise a career as well as ruin it | url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/15b581ae-7828-11e5-933d-efcdc3c11c89.html |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Duncan Cheatle''' is an entrepreneur and supporter of UK enterprise. He has founded and co-founded multiple enterprise support initiatives, including The Supper Club, a London-based membership club for fast-growth entrepreneurs; [[Startup Britain]], a privately sector funded, not-for-profit national campaign to 'celebrate, inspire, and accelerate enterprise in the UK';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Start Up Britain: About Us|url=http://www.startupbritain.org/about-us/|accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and LearnAmp, a learning platform that aggregates and curates learning content from across the web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LearnAmp|url=http://www.learnamp.com/|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Businesses ==
Cheatle is CEO and founder of Prelude, a business whose stated mission is 'Making Britain the most enterprising nation in the world.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hobson|first=Sophie|title=Q&amp;A: Duncan Cheatle, founder of The Supper Club and Prelude Group|url=http://www.londonlovesbusiness.com/entrepreneurs/fast-growing-businesses-and-sme/qa-duncan-cheatle-founder-of-the-supper-club-and-prelude-group/2496.article|accessdate=27 August 2012|newspaper=London Loves Business|date=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prelude, founded in 2000, is an entrepreneurial support organisation providing networking, training programmes and other support services to UK entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cityam.com/207890/small-business-champion|title=The Supper Club founder talks cowboys and venture capital|last=Green|first=Harriet|date=26 January 2015|access-date=27 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Included within The Prelude Group are a number of different businesses: The Supper Club, a 'membership group exclusively for fast-growth entrepreneurs', The Director's Club, 'development for directors of entrepreneurial businesses', Speaker Boutique, 'insights on scaling your business from entrepreneurs who have', and Growth Programmes, 'structured learning for entrepreneurs and their teams'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.preludegroup.co.uk/what-we-do/|title=Prelude Group {{!}} What We Do|last=|first=|date=|website=Prelude Group|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public campaigns and initiatives ==

=== Tax reports ===
in 2016, Prelude, in partnership with the Institute of Directors and Grant Thornton, released a report on the tax burden faced by UK entrepreneurs. The report, 'A Tax Code for Global Ambition,' proposed a number of recommendations around the simplification and alteration of taxes paid by small business owners.

The report follows a 2012 report by Prelude in partnership with PwC, 'The Unsung Heroes of Business: The Total Tax Contribution of Entrepreneurs.' This report looked at the total tax contributions of seven UK-based entrepreneurial enterprises, based on all business and employment taxes paid by the businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.preludegroup.co.uk/resources/Unsung-heroes-of-business1.pdf|title=The Unsung Heroes of Business|last=|first=|date=|website=Prelude|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Growth Britain ===
In 2013, Prelude ran a nationwide crowd-sourced ideas generation campaign asking the public to pitch their ideas on how entrepreneurship could be better incentivised and supported. The campaign was backed by then Enterprise Advisor to the Prime Minister [[David Young, Baron Young of Graffham|Lord Young]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://startupbritain.org/making-great-britain-growth-britain-lord-young-welcomes-preludes-latest-initiative/|title=Making Great Britain, Growth Britain – Lord Young welcomes Prelude’s latest initiative – StartUp Britain|website=startupbritain.org|language=en-US|access-date=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This online campaign asked people to contribute ideas, vote on others and participate in discussion of these ideas.

=== Start Up Britain ===
In 2011, Cheatle co-founded Start Up Britain, a privately led national campaign to promote UK entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moules|first=Jonathan|title=Campaign to foster start-ups backed by PM|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c8bca8dc-58ab-11e0-9b8a-00144feab49a.html#axzz24jdUNIOi|accessdate=27 August 2012|newspaper=The Financial Times|date=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative was launched by British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]], and has the support of HM government as well as a number of international corporations including [[AXA]], [[Barclays]], [[Intel]], [[BlackBerry]], [[Experian]], [[Google]], [[Virgin Media]], [[Microsoft]], [[McKinsey &amp; Co]] and [[Telefónica Europe|O2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=David Cameron: Now is time to start business|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12877083|publisher=BBC|accessdate=4 July 2012|date=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheatle, with The Supper Club, offered a mentoring scheme as part of Start Up Britain's offering for its first year. This scheme provided over 1600 hours of mentoring by experienced entrepreneurs to early stage businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cheatle|first=Duncan|title=Start Up Britain Mentoring Scheme to Produce Over 500 New Jobs|url=http://www.startupbritain.org/new/2012/04/22/the-supper-club-mentoring-scheme-to-produce-over-500-new-jobs/|publisher=Start Up Britain|accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CGT taper relief ===
In 2007 Cheatle led a campaign against plans announced by then UK Chancellor [[Alistair Darling]] to abolish taper relief on entrepreneurial businesses, a tax relief originally introduced in 1998 with the stated intention of increasing investment to small and medium businesses. Cheatle's petition against the abolition of taper relief on the [[Downing Street]] website received over 18,000 signatures and the campaign was widely covered in the UK press at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wearden|first=Graeme|title=12,000 people sign CGT petition|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/oct/19/politics.economicpolicy|accessdate=4 July 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=19 October 2007|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tyler|first=Richard|title=Alistair Darling will refuse to budge on CGT|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/2783146/Alistair-Darling-will-refuse-to-budge-on-CGT.html|accessdate=4 July 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=23 January 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moules|first=Jonathan|title=CGT change 'has cost Labour votes'|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/6e50a83e-89b1-11dc-8dff-0000779fd2ac,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F6e50a83e-89b1-11dc-8dff-0000779fd2ac.html&amp;_i_referer=#axzz1zdYnfMkm|accessdate=4 July 2012|newspaper=The Financial Times|date=3 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the negative public response to the proposals, the [[British Treasury|Treasury]] introduced a new tax relief measure known as [[Entrepreneurs' Relief]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Woods|first=Catherine|title=Entrepreneurs lambast CGT plans|url=http://realbusiness.co.uk/news/entrepreneurs_lambast_cgt_plans|accessdate=4 July 2012|newspaper=Real Business|date=24 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public profile and leadership ==
In 2012, Cheatle became a director of the newly formed Start Up Loans company, a government funded organisation providing mentor-supported loans to young people looking to start their own businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=£80 million start up loans for new businesses|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/lord-young-report-enterprise/|publisher=HM Government|accessdate=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme, which also involved Dragon's Den star James Caan, was promoted by 12 "ambassadors" including young entrepreneurs such as James Eder (The Beans Group), Emily Bendell (Bluebella) and Romy Lewis (Lola's Kitchen).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sharkey|first=Linda|title=Government's scheme reveals ambassadors to inspire young entrepreneurs|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/governments-scheme-reveals-ambassadors-to-inspire-young-entrepreneurs-7959887.html|accessdate=2 March 2015|newspaper=The Independent|date=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''František Křižík''' ({{IPA-cs|ˈfraɲcɪʃɛk ˈkr̝̊ɪʒiːk|lang}}; July 8, 1847 – January 22, 1941) was a [[Czech people|Czech]] inventor, electrical engineer, and entrepreneur. 

==Biography==
Křižík was born into a poor family in [[Plánice]], located at the time within the [[Austrian Empire]]. In spite of this, Křižík managed in 1866 to study engineering at the Technical University of Prague [[ČVUT]]. 

Křižík is considered the pioneer in practical electrical engineering and in electrification of Bohemia (and Austro-Hungarian empire) and at the time was often compared to [[Thomas Edison]]. In 1878 Křižík invented a remotely operated signalling device to protect against collision between [[train]]s.&lt;ref name=cz&gt;[http://www.radio.cz/en/static/inventors/krizik František Křižík]&lt;/ref&gt; '''Křižík's cores''' are magnetic
solenoids cores shaped so as to insure an approximately uniform pull in different positions in the solenoid.

His first experiments in [[Plzeň]] resulted in invention in 1880 of the automatic electric [[arc lamp]], the so-called "Plzen Lamp"  which was displayed at the [[International Exposition of Electricity]] in Paris in 1881. This lamp, with self-adjusting brushes, won the gold medal from among 50 similar devices.&lt;ref name=cz/&gt; Later he successfully defended his patent against [[Werner von Siemens|Werner Siemens]] claim to have created it first. His lamps were successfully used in many cities for street lighting. The restored and fully functional patented arc lamp with automated electrode adjustment can be viewed at the Museum of Pilsen.

In 1895 Křižík build one of first electromobiles in Austrian empire.

In 1884 Křižík set up his own company building city lighting, tramway lines, street cars, power stations, and various electric equipment. 

A Prague subway station was named after František Křižík – [[Křižíkova]].

==Electric railway [[Tábor]] – [[Bechyně]]==

František Křižík built the first [[electric railway]] in the Austro-Hungarian empire in 1903. The track gauge was {{Track gauge|1435mm|allk=on}}. The maximum speed was {{convert|50|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. 

Railroad Stations: 
[[Tábor]] – Horky u Tábora – Slapy – Libějice – Malšice – Čenkov u Malšic – Třebelice – Všechlapy – Bechyňská Smoleč – Sudoměřice u Bechyně – Bežerovice – [[Bechyně zastávka]] – [[Bechyně]]

==Legacy==
The [[main belt]] [[asteroid]] [[5719 Křižík]] was named in his honor.&lt;ref name="JP: Small-body Database Browser"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=5719 | title = JPL Small-Body Database Browser | accessdate = 2008-05-03 | publisher = [[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. '''Gerhardus Petrus Christiaan de Kock''' better known as '''Gerhard de Kock''' (14 February 1926 — 7 August 1989) was the sixth Governor of the [[South African Reserve Bank]]. He was the son of Dr. [[M.H. de Kock]], who was the third Governor of the South African Reserve Bank. South Africa's constitutional arrangements were changed during his term in office. The 1st Republic was superseded by the 2nd Republic in late 1984. Dr. de Kock was the first (and only) Governor of the South African Reserve Bank to die in office. His term was from 1 January 1981 until his death on 7 August 1989. He was succeeded by Dr. [[Chris Stals]].

As early as 1951 Dr Gerhardus de Kock was engaged by the Reserve Bank to do specialised research on a part-time basis. At the end of 1955 he joined the Bank as an economist. Shortly after his appointment at the Bank he was chosen to represent the Bank at the first course presented by the [[Bank of England]] for foreign bank officials in London. As from 1 July 1962 the position held by Dr De Kock was changed to Economic Adviser and on 1 January 1964 he was appointed Head: Economics Department. In 1967 the status of his post was upgraded and he started to attend the meetings of the Board of Directors. In May 1966 he was seconded to the Treasury as a Special Economic Adviser for 14 months. He finally left the Economics Department towards the middle of 1968 when he was appointed Alternate Executive Director of the [[International Monetary Fund]] in Washington, DC, as the representative of South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Lesotho and Swaziland, a position which he held with distinction up to the middle of 1971.
 
On his return to South Africa Dr de Kock was appointed as a Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank with effect from 1 July 1971 and then to Senior Deputy Governor on 1 July 1976. In 1977 Dr De Kock was seconded to the Ministry of Finance as a Special Economic Adviser. He was also appointed during this period as the Chairman of the Commission of Inquiry into the Monetary System and Monetary Policy in South Africa. This commission eventually became known as the De Kock Commission. The final phase in Dr De Kock’s career began when he succeeded Dr T W de Jongh as Reserve Bank Governor, a position he held until his death in August 1989.
 
Dr de Kock also served as a Director and later as Chairman of the National Finance Corporation and its “successor” the Corporation for Public Deposits. Other positions occupied by him included that of Alternate Governor (later Governor) for South Africa on the Board of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank), Governor for South Africa on the Board of the Development Bank for Southern Africa, member of the Committee of Twenty and member of the Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council. Dr De Kock played an important role in professional bodies through active participation and delivering lectures. In 1980 and 1981 he was the President of the Economic Society of South Africa and also served one term as President of the Institute of Bankers in South Africa.
 
Honorary doctorates and awards received/bestowed on Dr de Kock include the following:
*1982 - D.Econ. (University of Natal)
*1983 - Stals Prize for Economics - (SA Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns)
*1987 - D. Com. (University of Port Elizabeth)
*1988 - D.Com. (University of Pretoria &amp; Potchefstroom University for CHE)
*1990 - Frans du Toit Medal - (SA Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns)

Other distinctions included his election as an honorary Fellow of the Institute of Bankers in South Africa in 1984 and his election by [[Euromoney]] magazine as “Central Banker of the Year" in 1988. After his death the [[University of Pretoria]] instituted the Gerhard de Kock Memorial Lecture, which was delivered annually by a prominent personality in the field of central banking.

A bronze bust of Dr de Kock by the sculptor Jo Roos remains to this day, to the entrance of the Gerhard de Kock Auditorium in the Head Office Building of the Reserve Bank.

== Political career==
Abbasi started his political career as a member of [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] but later joined [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)]] (PML-N) in 2008.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

He was first elected as a member of the [[National Assembly of Pakistan]] from  [[Constituency NA-56|NA-56 (Rawalpindi VII)]] as a candidate of [[Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal]] (MMA) and defeated [[Sheikh Rashid Ahmad]] nephew, Sheikh Rashid Shafiq in the 2002 by-elections.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In [[Pakistani general election, 2008]], Abbasi joined the [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)]] (PML-N) and was again elected as a member of the [[National Assembly of Pakistan]] from  [[Constituency NA-56|NA-56 (Rawalpindi VII)]] on the ticket of [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)]] (PML-N) and defeated former Minister [[Sheikh Rashid Ahmad]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In [[Pakistani general election, 2013]], he again contested election from  [[Constituency NA-56|NA-56 (Rawalpindi VII)]] as a candiate of [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)]] (PML-N) and was defeated by [[Imran Khan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dawn.com/2013/03/28/imran-to-contest-from-na-56-2/ | title=PML-N finalises NA candidates | work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] | date=26 March 2013 | accessdate=29 March 2013 | author=Yasin, Aamir}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disqualification==
Abbasi owns a pharmaceutical wholesale business which he runs under the company named, Gray Pharmaceutical.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.dawn.com/news/1421583 |title=Court hands life sentence to PML-N's Hanif Abbasi in ephedrine quota case |author= Malik Asad, ''Dawn.com'' |date=21 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Raja |first=Mudassir |url= http://tribune.com.pk/story/435143/ephedrine-case-mna-pleads-innocence-as-pharma-companies-threaten-supply-freeze |title= Ephedrine case: MNA pleads innocence as pharma companies threaten supply freeze |work=[[The Express Tribune]] |date=12 September 2012 |accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In June 2012, the [[Anti-Narcotics Force]] (ANF) filed a case in the [[Lahore High Court]] alleging Abbasi and several colleagues of misusing {{convert|500|kg}} of ephedrine which was bought for making  medicine in 2010.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

On June 11, 2018, Justice Ibadur Rehman Lodhi of the Lahore High Court’s Rawalpindi bench had ordered the judge of the special court to hear the case on a daily basis from July 16 onwards and announce the verdict on 21 July 2018.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

On 21 July 2018, the Control of Narcotics Substances court handed life imprisonment and {{PKR|1 million}} fine to Abbasi in its verdict. He was taken into custody from the courtroom and was subsequently imprisoned.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

It is concerned with the understanding and application of Engineering Procedures in Manufacturing Processes and Production Methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polytech-reseau.org/en/polytech-education/industrial-engineering/|title=Industrial Engineering|website=www.polytech-reseau.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-011-7038-3_1|title=Handbook of Electronics Manufacturing Engineering|last=Matisoff|first=Bernard S.|date=1986|publisher=Springer, Dordrecht|isbn=9789401170406|pages=1–4|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-011-7038-3_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial Engineering dates back all the way to the industrial revolution, initiated in 1700s by Sir [[Adam Smith]], [[Henry Ford]], [[Eli Whitney]], [[Frank Gilbreth]] and [[Lilian Gilbreth]], [[Henry Gantt]], [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|F.W. Taylor]], etc. After the 1970s, industrial and production engineering developed worldwide and started to widely use automation and robotics. Industrial and production Engineering includes three areas:  [[Mechanical engineering|Mechanical Engineering]] (where the production engineering comes from), [[Industrial engineering|Industrial Engineering]], and [[Management science|Management Science]]. The main objective for people within this discipline is to improve efficiency, drive up effectiveness of manufacturing, quality control, and to reduce cost while making their products more attractive and marketable. Industrial engineering is concerned with the development, improvement, and implementation of integrated systems of people, money, knowledge, information, equipment, energy, materials, as well as analysis and synthesis. The principles of IPE include mathematical, physical and [[social sciences]] and methods of engineering design to specify, predict, and evaluate the results to be obtained from the systems or processes currently in place or being developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ubt.edu.sa/CE/Industrial-Engineering-Department/Overview|title=UBT &gt; CE &gt; Industrial Engineering Department &gt; Overview|last=UBT|website=www.ubt.edu.sa|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The target of production engineering is to complete the production process in the smoothest, most-judicious and most-economic way. Production engineering also overlaps substantially with [[manufacturing engineering]] and [[industrial engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lyons|first=William|date=|title=Life as a Production Engineer|url=http://www.acetherapist.com/Content/Life_as_a_Production_Engineer.pdf|journal=ACE|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of production engineering is interchangeable with manufacturing engineering.

As for education, undergraduates normally start off by taking courses such as physics, mathematics (calculus, linear analysis, differential equations), computer science, and chemistry. Undergraduates will take more major specific courses like production and inventory scheduling, process management, CAD/CAM Manufacturing, ergonomics, etc., towards the later years of their undergraduate careers. In some parts of the world, universities will offer Bachelor's in Industrial and Production Engineering. However, most universities in the U.S. will offer them separately. Various career paths that may follow for industrial and production engineers include: [[Plant Engineering and Maintenance Association of Canada|Plant Engineers]], [[Manufacturing engineering|Manufacturing Engineers]], [[Quality engineering|Quality Engineers]], [[Process engineering|Process Engineers]] and Industrial Managers, [[Project management|Project Management]], [[Manufacturing]], Production and Distribution, From all the various career paths people can take as an Industrial and Production Engineer, most  average a starting salary of at least $50,000.

== History ==

=== Industrial Revolution ===
The roots of the Industrial Engineering Profession date back to the [[Industrial Revolution]].  The technologies that helped mechanize traditional manual operations in the textile industry including the [[Flying shuttle]], the [[Spinning jenny]], and perhaps most importantly the [[Steam engine]] generated [[Economies of scale]] that made [[Mass production]] in centralized locations attractive for the first time.  The concept of the production system had its genesis in the factories created by these innovations.&lt;ref name="Maynard-Zandin2"&gt;Maynard &amp; Zandin. Maynard's Industrial Engineering Handbook. McGraw Hill Professional 5th Edition. June 5, 2001. p. 1.4–1.6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Specialization of labor ===
[[File:Maquina_vapor_Watt_ETSIIM.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Maquina_vapor_Watt_ETSIIM.jpg|thumb|225x225px|Watt's steam engine ([[Technical University of Madrid]])]]Adam Smith's concepts of [[Division of Labour]] and the "Invisible Hand" of capitalism introduced in his treatise "[[The Wealth of Nations]]" motivated many of the technological innovators of the Industrial revolution to establish and implement factory systems.  The efforts of James Watt and Matthew Boulton led to the first integrated machine manufacturing facility in the world, including the implementation of concepts such as cost control systems to reduce waste and increase productivity and the institution of skills training for craftsmen.&lt;ref name="Maynard-Zandin2" /&gt;

[[Charles Babbage]] became associated with Industrial engineering because of the concepts he introduced in his book "On the Economy of Machinery and Manufacturers" which he wrote as a result of his visits to factories in England and the United States in the early 1800s.  The book includes subjects such as the time required to perform a specific task, the effects of subdividing tasks into smaller and less detailed elements, and the advantages to be gained from repetitive tasks.&lt;ref name="Maynard-Zandin2" /&gt;

=== Interchangeable parts ===
[[Eli Whitney]] and [[Simeon North]] proved the feasibility of the notion of [[Interchangeable parts]] in the manufacture of muskets and pistols for the US Government.  Under this system, individual parts were mass-produced to tolerances to enable their use in any finished product.  The result was a significant reduction in the need for skill from specialized workers, which eventually led to the industrial environment to be studied later.&lt;ref name="Maynard-Zandin2" /&gt;

=== Modern development ===

==== Industrial engineering ====
In 1960 to 1975, with the velopment of decision support systems in supply such as the [[Material requirements planning]] (MRP), people can emphasize the timing issue (inventory, production, compounding, transportation, etc.) of industrial organization. Israeli scientist Dr. [[Jacob Rubinovitz]] installed the CMMS program developed in IAI and Control-Data (Israel) in 1976 in South Africa and worldwide.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kádárová|first=Jaroslava|date=|title=Education in Industrial Engineering in Slovakia|url=https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1877042814043079/1-s2.0-S1877042814043079-main.pdf?_tid=b359991c-176e-4eb6-aee1-0b4713b51767&amp;acdnat=1524330232_40bd0bc004738e78d58cb34007541ed3|journal=Procedia|volume=143|pages=157–162|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the seventies, with the penetration of Japanese management theories such as [[Kaizen]] and [[Kanban]], Japan realized very high levels of quality and productivity. These theories improved issues of quality, delivery time, and flexibility. Companies in the west realized the great impact of Kaizen and started implementing their own [[Continuous improvement]] programs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the nineties, following the global industry globalization process, the emphasis was on supply chain management, and customer-oriented business process design. [[Theory of constraints]] developed by an Israeli scientist [[Eliyahu M. Goldratt]] (1985) is also a significant milestone in the field.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Manufacturing (production) engineering  ====
Modern manufacturing engineering studies include all intermediate processes required for the production and integration of a product's components.{{Main|Semiconductor manufacturing}}Some industries, such as [[semiconductor]] and [[steel]] manufacturers use the term "fabrication" for these processes.[[File:Factory_Automation_Robotics_Palettizing_Bread.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Factory_Automation_Robotics_Palettizing_Bread.jpg|right|thumb|300x300px|KUKA industrial robots being used at a bakery for food production{{Main|Automation}}]][[Automation]] is used in different processes of manufacturing such as machining and welding. Automated manufacturing refers to the application of automation to produce goods in a factory. The main advantages of automated manufacturing for the manufacturing process are realized with effective implementation of automation and include: higher consistency and quality, reduction of lead times, simplification of production, reduced handling, improved work flow, and improved worker morale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gj5QBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA213&amp;lpg=PA213&amp;dq=higher+consistency+and+quality,+reduction+of+lead+times,+simplification+of+production,+reduced+handling,+improved+work+flow,+and+improved+worker+morale&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=h07o74up4M&amp;sig=lNSIq_dTOKi8sFuTm-ix5HgTtks&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwilyYir8svaAhWQON8KHc0fCUYQ6AEIPzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=higher%20consistency%20and%20quality,%20reduction%20of%20lead%20times,%20simplification%20of%20production,%20reduced%20handling,%20improved%20work%20flow,%20and%20improved%20worker%20morale&amp;f=false|title=Perspectives on Kurdistan's Economy and Society in Transition: Volume II|last=Heshmati|first=Almas|last2=Dilani|first2=Alan|last3=Baban|first3=Serwan M.

[[Robotics]] is the application of mechatronics and automation to create robots, which are often used in manufacturing to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot). Robots are used extensively in manufacturing engineering.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://muhendislik.sdu.edu.tr/makinemuh/en/general-informations/what-is-mechanical-engineering-3585s.html|title=What is Mechanical Engineering – MECHANICAL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT – Süleyman Demirel Üniversitesi|last=University|first=Süleyman Demirel|website=muhendislik.sdu.edu.tr|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robots allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Main|Robotics}}

Traditionally, a major aspect of industrial engineering was [[Plant layout study|planning the layouts of factories]] and designing assembly lines and other manufacturing paradigms. And now, in [[lean manufacturing]] systems, industrial engineers work to eliminate wastes of time, money, materials, energy, and other resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ubt.edu.sa/CE/Industrial-Engineering-Department/Overview|title=UBT &gt; CE &gt; Industrial Engineering Department &gt; Overview|last=UBT|website=www.ubt.edu.sa|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of where industrial engineering might be used include flow process charting, process mapping, designing an assembly workstation, strategizing for various operational logistics, consulting as an efficiency expert, developing a new financial algorithm or loan system for a bank, streamlining operation and emergency room location or usage in a hospital, planning complex distribution schemes for materials or products (referred to as [[supply-chain management]]), and shortening lines (or [[Queueing theory|queues]]) at a bank, hospital, or a theme park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://biethapathali.blogspot.com/2017/11/blog-post_28.html|title=Industrial Engineering|language=en|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern industrial engineers typically use [[predetermined motion time system]], [[computer simulation]] (especially [[discrete event simulation]]), along with extensive mathematical tools for modeling, such as [[mathematical optimization]] and [[queueing theory]], and computational methods for system analysis, evaluation, and optimization. Industrial engineers also use the tools of [[data science]] and [[machine learning]] in their work owing to the strong relatedness of these disciplines with the field and the similar technical background required of industrial engineers (including a strong foundation in [[probability theory]], [[linear algebra]], and [[statistics]], as well as having [[Computer programming|coding]] skills).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is a very broad area which includes the design and development of products. Manufacturing engineering is considered to be a sub-discipline of [[industrial engineering]]/[[systems engineering]] and has very strong overlaps with [[mechanical engineering]]. Manufacturing engineers' success or failure directly impacts the advancement of technology and the spread of innovation. This field of manufacturing engineering emerged from tool and die discipline in the early 20th century. It expanded greatly from the 1960s when industrialized countries introduced factories with:

1. [[Numerical control]] machine tools and automated systems of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lynch|first1=Mike|title=Key CNC Concept #1—The Fundamentals Of CNC|url=https://www.mmsonline.com/articles/key-cnc-concept-1the-fundamentals-of-cnc|website=www.mmsonline.com|publisher=Gardner Business Media|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Advanced statistical methods of [[quality control]]: These factories were pioneered by the American electrical engineer [[William Edwards Deming]], who was initially ignored by his home country. The same methods of quality control later turned Japanese factories into world leaders in cost-effectiveness and production quality.

3. [[Industrial robots]] on the factory floor, introduced in the late 1970s: These computer-controlled [[welding]] arms and grippers could perform simple tasks such as attaching a car door quickly and flawlessly 24 hours a day. This cut costs and improved production speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://keerthitravels.com/services/agricultural-processing/|title=Manufacturing Engineer – Keerthi Travels|website=keerthitravels.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==

=== Industrial engineering ===

==== Undergraduate curriculum ====
In the United States the undergraduate degree earned is the Bachelor of Science (B.S.) or Bachelor of Science and Engineering (B.S.E.) in Industrial Engineering (IE).  Variations of the title include Industrial &amp; Operations Engineering (IOE), and Industrial &amp; Systems Engineering (ISE).  The typical curriculum includes a broad math and science foundation spanning [[chemistry]], [[physics]], mechanics (i.e., statics, kinematics, and dynamics), materials science, computer science, electronics/circuits, [[engineering design]], and the standard range of engineering mathematics (i.e. [[calculus]], [[linear algebra]], [[differential equations]], [[statistics]]). For any engineering undergraduate program to be accredited, regardless of concentration, it must cover a largely similar span of such foundational work – which also overlaps heavily with the content tested on one or more engineering licensure exams in most jurisdictions.

The coursework specific to IE entails specialized courses in areas such as [[optimization]], [[applied probability]], [[stochastic]] modeling, [[design of experiments]], [[statistical process control]], [[Computer simulation|simulation]], [[manufacturing engineering]], [[ergonomics]]/[[safety engineering]], and [[engineering economics]]. Industrial engineering elective courses typically cover more specialized topics in areas such as [[manufacturing]], [[supply chains]] and [[logistics]], [[analytics]] and [[machine learning]], [[Operations management#Production systems|production systems]], [[human factors]] and [[industrial design]], and [[service system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.isye.gatech.edu/academics/bachelors/industrial-engineering/courses|title=ISyE Undergraduate Courses|publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology|accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/ind_eng/|title=Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IND ENG)|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engin.umich.edu/college/academics/bulletin/depts/ioe/courses|title=Courses|publisher=University of Michigan, Ann Arbor|accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/courses/|title=Courses|publisher=Northwestern University|accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ise.illinois.edu/undergraduate/electives.html|title=ISE Electives|publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain business schools may offer programs with some overlapping relevance to IE, but the engineering programs are distinguished by a much more intensely quantitative focus, required engineering science electives, and the core math and science courses required of all engineering programs.

==== Graduate curriculum ====
The usual graduate degree earned is the Master of Science (MS) or Master of Science and Engineering (MSE) in Industrial Engineering or various alternative related concentration titles. Typical MS curricula may cover:

=== Manufacturing (production) engineering ===

==== Degree certification programs ====
Manufacturing engineers possess an associate's or bachelor's degree in engineering with a major in manufacturing engineering. The length of study for such a degree is usually two to five years followed by five more years of professional practice to qualify as a professional engineer. Working as a manufacturing engineering technologist involves a more applications-oriented qualification path.

Academic degrees for manufacturing engineers are usually the Associate or Bachelor of Engineering, [BE] or [BEng], and the Associate or Bachelor of Science, [BS] or [BSc]. For manufacturing technologists the required degrees are Associate or Bachelor of Technology [B.TECH] or Associate or Bachelor of Applied Science [BASc] in Manufacturing, depending upon the university. Master's degrees in engineering manufacturing include Master of Engineering [ME] or [MEng] in Manufacturing, Master of Science [M.Sc] in Manufacturing Management, Master of Science [M.Sc] in Industrial and Production Management, and Master of Science [M.Sc] as well as Master of Engineering [ME] in Design, which is a subdiscipline of manufacturing. Doctoral [PhD] or [DEng] level courses in manufacturing are also available depending on the university.

The undergraduate degree curriculum generally includes courses in physics, mathematics, computer science, project management, and specific topics in mechanical and manufacturing engineering. Initially such topics cover most, if not all, of the subdisciplines of manufacturing engineering. Students then choose to specialize in one or more subdisciplines towards the end of their degree work.

Specific to Industrial Engineers, people will see courses covering ergonomics, scheduling, inventory management, forecasting, product development, and in general courses that focus on optimization. Most colleges breakdown the large sections of industrial engineering into Healthcare, Ergonomics, Product Development, or Consulting sectors. This allows for the student to get a good grasp on each of the varying sub-sectors so they know what area they are most interested about pursuing a career in.

==== Undergraduate curriculum ====
The Foundational Curriculum for a bachelor's degree of Manufacturing Engineering or Production Engineering includes below mentioned Syllabus. This Syllabus is closely related to Industrial Engineering and Mechanical Engineering. But it Differs by Placing more Emphasis on Manufacturing Science or Production Science. It includes following:
{| class="wikitable"
|
* Mathematics (Calculus, Differential Equations, Statistics and Linear Algebra)
* Mechanics (Statics &amp; Dynamics)
* Solid Mechanics
* Fluid Mechanics
* Materials Science
* Strength of Materials
* Fluid Dynamics
* Hydraulics
* Pneumatics
* HVAC (Heating, Ventilation &amp; Air Conditioning)
* Heat Transfer
* Applied Thermodynamics
* Energy Conversion
|
* Instrumentation and Measurement
* Engineering Drawing (Drafting) &amp; Engineering Design
* Engineering Graphics
* Mechanism Design including Kinematics and Dynamics
* Manufacturing Processes
* Mechatronics
* Circuit Analysis
* Lean Manufacturing
* Automation
* Reverse Engineering
* Quality Control
* CAD(Computer aided Design which includes Solid Modelling) and CAM (Computer aided Manufacturing)
|}
A Degree in Manufacturing Engineering versus Mechanical Engineering will typically Differ only by a few Specialized Classes. Mechanical Engineering degree focuses more on the Product Design Process and on Complex Products which requires more Mathematics Expertise.

== Manufacturing engineering certification ==

=== Professional engineering license ===
A [[Professional Engineer]], PE,  is a licensed engineer who is permitted to offer professional services to the public. Professional Engineers may prepare, sign, seal, and submit engineering plans to the public. Before a candidate can become a professional engineer, they will need to receive a bachelor's degree from an [[ABET]] recognized university in the USA, take and pass the Fundamentals of Engineering exam to become an "engineer-in-training", and work four years under the supervision of a professional engineer. After those tasks are complete the candidate will be able to take the PE exam. Upon receiving a passing score on the test, the candidate will receive their PE License .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How To Get Licensed|url=https://www.nspe.org/resources/licensure/how-get-licensed|website=www.nspe.org|accessdate=21 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME) certifications (USA) ===
The [[SME (society)]] administers qualifications specifically for the manufacturing industry. These are not degree level qualifications and are not recognized at the professional engineering level. The SME offers two certifications for Manufacturing engineers: Certified Manufacturing Technologist Certificate (CMfgT) and Certified Manufacturing Engineer (CMfgE).

====Certified manufacturing technologist====
Qualified candidates for the Certified Manufacturing Technologist Certificate (CMfgT) must pass a three-hour, 130-question multiple-choice exam. The exam covers math, manufacturing processes, manufacturing management, automation, and related subjects. A score of 60% or higher must be achieved to pass the exam. Additionally, a candidate must have at least four years of combined education and manufacturing-related work experience. The CMfgT certification must be renewed every three years in order to stay certified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SME – Certified Manufacturing Technologist (CMfgT) Certification|url=http://www.sme.org/cmfgt/|website=www.sme.org|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Certified manufacturing engineer ====
Certified Manufacturing Engineer (CMfgE) is an engineering qualification administered by the Society of Manufacturing Engineers, Dearborn, Michigan, USA.  Candidates qualifying for a Certified Manufacturing Engineer credential must pass a four-hour, 180 question multiple-choice exam which covers more in-depth topics than does the CMfgT exam. A score of 60% or higher must be achieved to pass the exam. CMfgE candidates must also have eight years of combined education and manufacturing-related work experience, with a minimum of four years of work experience. The CMfgT certification must be renewed every three years in order to stay certified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SME – Certified Manufacturing Engineer (CMfgE) Certification|url=http://www.sme.org/cmfge/|website=www.sme.org|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

=== Industrial engineering ===

==== Human factors ====
The Human Factors area specializes in exploring how systems fit the people who must operate them, determining the roles of people with the systems, and selecting those people who can best fit particular roles within these systems. Students who focus on Human Factors will be able to work with a multidisciplinary team of faculty with strengths in understanding cognitive behavior as it relates to automation, air and ground transportation, medical studies, and space exploration.

==== Production systems ====
The Production Systems area develops new solutions in areas such as engineering design, supply chain management (e.g. supply chain system design, error recovery, large scale systems), manufacturing (e.g. system design, planning and scheduling), and medicine (e.g. disease diagnosis, discovery of medical knowledge). Students who focus on production systems will be able to work on topics related to computational intelligence theories for applications in industry, healthcare, and service organizations.

Biomanufacturing is our most recent research addition.

==== Reliability systems ====
The objective of the Reliability Systems area is to provide students with advanced data analysis and decision making techniques that will improve quality and reliability of complex systems. Students who focus on system reliability and uncertainty will be able to work on areas related to contemporary reliability systems including integration of quality and reliability, simultaneous life cycle design for manufacturing systems, decision theory in quality and reliability engineering, condition-based maintenance and degradation modeling, discrete event simulation and decision analysis.

==== Wind power management ====
The Wind Power Management Program aims at meeting the emerging needs for graduating professionals involved in design, operations, and management of wind farms deployed in massive numbers all over the country. The graduates will be able to fully understand the system and management issues of wind farms and their interactions with alternative and conventional power generation systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mie.engineering.uiowa.edu/graduate-program/industrial-engineering-graduate-program/research-focus-areas-industrial-engineering|title=Research Focus Areas for Industrial Engineering {{!}} Mechanical and Industrial Engineering|website=mie.engineering.uiowa.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Production (manufacturing) engineering ===

==== Flexible manufacturing systems ====
{{Main|Flexible manufacturing system}}[[File:FlexiblesFertigungssystem.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:FlexiblesFertigungssystem.jpg|thumb|A typical FMS system]]A [[flexible manufacturing system]] (FMS) is a manufacturing system in which there is some amount of flexibility that allows the system to react to changes, whether predicted or unpredicted. This flexibility is generally considered to fall into two categories, both of which have numerous subcategories. The first category, machine flexibility, covers the system's ability to be changed to produce new product types and the ability to change the order of operations executed on a part. The second category, called routing flexibility, consists of the ability to use multiple machines to perform the same operation on a part, as well as the system's ability to absorb large-scale changes, such as in volume, capacity, or capability.

Most FMS systems comprise three main systems. The work machines, which are often automated CNC machines, are connected by a material handling system to optimize parts flow, and to a central control computer, which controls material movements and machine flow. The main advantages of an FMS is its high flexibility in managing manufacturing resources like time and effort in order to manufacture a new product. The best application of an FMS is found in the production of small sets of products from a mass production.

==== Computer integrated manufacturing ====
{{Main|Computer-integrated manufacturing}}

Computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM) in engineering is a method of manufacturing in which the entire production process is controlled by computer. Traditionally separated process methods are joined through a computer by CIM. This integration allows the processes to exchange information and to initiate actions. Through this integration, manufacturing can be faster and less error-prone, although the main advantage is the ability to create automated manufacturing processes. Typically CIM relies on closed-loop control processes based on real-time input from sensors. It is also known as flexible design and manufacturing.

==== Friction stir welding ====
{{Main|Friction stir welding}}[[File:Friction_Stir_Weld.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Friction_Stir_Weld.jpg|thumb|Close-up view of a friction stir weld tack tool]]Friction stir welding was discovered in 1991 by [[The Welding Institute]] (TWI). This innovative steady state (non-fusion) welding technique joins previously un-weldable materials, including several [[aluminum alloys]]. It may play an important role in the future construction of airplanes, potentially replacing rivets. Current uses of this technology to date include: welding the seams of the aluminum main space shuttle external tank, the Orion Crew Vehicle test article, Boeing Delta II and Delta IV Expendable Launch Vehicles and the SpaceX Falcon 1 rocket; armor plating for amphibious assault ships; and welding the wings and fuselage panels of the new Eclipse 500 aircraft from Eclipse Aviation, among an increasingly growing range of uses.

=== Production (manufacturing) engineering ===
Manufacturing engineering is just one facet of the engineering industry. Manufacturing engineers enjoy improving the production process from start to finish. They have the ability to keep the whole production process in mind as they focus on a particular portion of the process. Successful students in manufacturing engineering degree programs are inspired by the notion of starting with a natural resource, such as a block of wood, and ending with a usable, valuable product, such as a desk, produced efficiently and economically.

Manufacturing engineers are closely connected with engineering and industrial design efforts. Examples of major companies that employ manufacturing engineers in the United States include General Motors Corporation, [[Ford Motor]] Company, Chrysler, [[Boeing]], Gates Corporation and Pfizer. Examples in Europe include [[Airbus]], Daimler, [[BMW]], Fiat, [[Navistar International]], and Michelin Tyre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top Mechanical Engineering Companies to Work For|url=https://engineeringmanagementinstitute.org/top-mechanical-engineering-companies-work/|website=Engineering Management Institute|date=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern tools ==
[[File:CAD_model_and_CNC_machined_part.PNG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CAD_model_and_CNC_machined_part.PNG|thumb|CAD model and CNC machined part]]
Many manufacturing companies, especially those in industrialized nations, have begun to incorporate [[computer-aided engineering]] (CAE) programs, such as [[SolidWorks]] and [[AutoCAD]], into their existing design and analysis processes, including 2D and 3D solid modeling [[computer-aided design]] (CAD). This method has many benefits, including easier and more exhaustive visualization of products, the ability to create virtual assemblies of parts, and ease of use in designing mating interfaces and tolerances.

[[File:Sw03.jpg|thumb|left|Screen Shot Captured from SolidWorks.]]

===SolidWorks===

[[SolidWorks]] is an example of a CAD modeling computer program developed by [[Dassault Systèmes]]. SolidWorks is an industry standard for drafting designs and specifications for physical objects and has been used by more than 165,000 companies as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZSg7xUj5tg Opening statement by CEO Bertrand Sicot at 2013 Solidworks World] YouTube Video Link.&lt;/ref&gt;

===AutoCAD===

[[AutoCAD]] is an example of a CAD modeling computer program developed by [[Autodesk]]. AutoCad is also widely used for CAD modeling and CAE.&lt;ref name="Lendio"&gt;{{cite web|title= Autodesk, Inc |url= http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Autodesk-Inc-company-History.html| publisher= Lendio | accessdate = 21 April 2018| work =FundingUniverse| year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other CAE programs commonly used by product manufacturers include product life cycle management (PLM) tools and analysis tools used to perform complex simulations. Analysis tools may be used to predict product response to expected loads, including fatigue life and manufacturability. These tools include [[finite element analysis]] (FEA), [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD), and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM). Using CAE programs, a mechanical design team can quickly and cheaply iterate the design process to develop a product that better meets cost, performance, and other constraints. There is no need to create a physical prototype until the design nears completion, allowing hundreds or thousands of designs to be evaluated, instead of relatively few. In addition, CAE analysis programs can model complicated physical phenomena which cannot be solved by hand, such as viscoelasticity, complex contact between mating parts, or non-Newtonian flows.

Just as manufacturing engineering is linked with other disciplines, such as mechatronics, [[multidisciplinary design optimization]] (MDO) is also being used with other CAE programs to automate and improve the iterative design process.&lt;ref name="MDO" /&gt; MDO tools wrap around existing CAE processes by automating the process of trial and error method used by classical engineers. MDO uses a computer based algorithm that will iteratively seek better alternatives from an initial guess within given constants. MDO uses this procedure to determine the best design outcome and lists various options as well.&lt;ref name="MDO"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sobieszczanski‐Sobieski|first1=Jaroslaw|last2=Morris|first2=Alan|last3=J.L van Tooren|first3=Michel|last4=La Rocca|first4=Gianfranco|last5=Yao|first5=Wen|title=Multidisciplinary Design Optimization Supported by Knowledge Based Engineering|date=2015|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.|isbn=9781118897072|pages=1–2|url=https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/doi/book/10.1002/9781118897072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the engineering project were to design a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the manufacture of the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle or to design the intake system for the engine.

=== Drafting ===
{{Main|Technical drawing|CNC}}
[[File:Mech_2_3D.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mech_2_3D.png|right|thumb|A CAD model of a [[Mechanical seal|mechanical double seal]]]]
Drafting or [[technical drawing]] is the means by which manufacturers create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or [[draftsman]]. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions. Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a [[computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Programs such as [[SolidWorks]] and [[AutoCAD]]&lt;ref name="Lendio"/&gt;  are examples of programs used to draft new parts and products under development.

Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings, but this is becoming an increasing rarity with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing. Engineers primarily manufacture parts manually in the areas of applied spray coatings, finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.

Drafting is used in nearly every sub discipline of mechanical and manufacturing engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in [[finite element analysis]] (FEA) and [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD).

===Metal fabrication and machine tools===
[[Metal fabrication]] is the building of metal structures by cutting, bending, and assembling processes. Technologies such as electron beam melting, laser engineered net shape, and direct metal laser sintering has allowed for the production of metal structures to become much less difficult when compared to other conventional metal fabrication methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cansizoglu|first1=Omer|last2=Harrysson|first2=Ola|last3=West|first3=Harvey|last4=Cormier|first4=Denis|last5=Mahale|first5=Tushar|title=Applications of structural optimization in direct metal fabrication|journal=Rapid Prototyping Journal|date=2008|volume=14|issue=2|pages=114–122|url=https://doi-org.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/10.1108/13552540810862082|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These help to alleviate various issues when the idealized CAD structures do not align with the actual fabricated structure.

[[Machine tool]]s employ many types of tools that do the cutting or shaping of materials. Machine tools usually include many components consisting of motors, levers, arms, pulleys, and other basic simple systems to create a complex system that can build various things. All of these components must work correctly in order to stay on schedule and remain on task. Machine tools aim to efficiently and effectively produce good parts at a quick pace with a small amount of error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Scott|title=Machine Tools: Design, Reliability and Safety|date=23 January 2012|publisher=Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated|isbn=9781622572045|page=vii|edition=1st|url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/ncsu/reader.action?ppg=9&amp;docID=3021649&amp;tm=1524351344222|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Computer integrated manufacturing ===
[[Computer-integrated manufacturing]] (CIM) is the manufacturing approach of using computers to control the entire production process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Kalpakjian | first = Serope | last2 = Schmid | first2 = Steven | title = Manufacturing engineering and technology | page = 1192 | publisher = Prentice Hall | year = 2006 | edition = 5th | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LRK59pGvDDwC&amp;amp;pg=PA1192 | isbn = 978-7-302-12535-8 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Computer-integrated manufacturing is used in automotive, aviation, space, and ship building industries.&lt;ref name=saracoglu&gt;{{cite journal

| title  = Identification of Technology Performance Criteria for CAD/CAM/CAE/CIM/CAL in Shipbuilding Industry
| ref    = harv
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer-integrated manufacturing allows for data, through various sensing mechanisms to be observed during manufacturing. This type of manufacturing has computers controlling and observing every part of the process. This gives CIM a unique advantage over other manufacturing processes.

=== Mechatronics ===
{{Main|Mechatronics|Robotics}}
[[File:FMS1_small.JPG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:FMS1_small.JPG|thumb|Training FMS with learning robot [[Intelitek|SCORBOT-ER 4u]], workbench CNC mill and CNC lathe]]
Mechatronics is an engineering discipline that deals with the convergence of electrical, mechanical and manufacturing systems.&lt;ref name = mech&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Silva|first1=Clarence|title=Mechatronics: Fundamentals and Applications|date=17 November 2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|location=Boca Raton|isbn=978-1-4822-3932-4|pages=1–2|edition=1st|url=https://www-taylorfrancis-com.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/books/e/9781482239324|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include automated manufacturing systems, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems, and various aircraft and automobile subsystems.&lt;ref name = mech /&gt; A mechatronic system typically includes a mechanical skeleton, motors, controllers, sensors, actuators, and digital hardware.&lt;ref name = mech /&gt; Mechatronics is greatly used in various applications of industrial processes and in automation.
The term mechatronics is typically used to refer to macroscopic systems, but futurists have predicted the emergence of very small electromechanical devices. Already such small devices, known as [[Microelectromechanical systems]]  (MEMS), are used in automobiles to initiate the deployment of airbags, in digital projectors to create sharper images, and in inkjet printers to create nozzles for high-definition printing. In future it is hoped that such devices will be used in tiny implantable medical devices and to improve optical communication.

=== Textile engineering ===
Textile engineering courses deal with the application of scientific and engineering principles to the design and control of all aspects of fiber, textile, and apparel processes, products, and machinery. These include natural and man-made materials, interaction of materials with machines, safety and health, energy conservation, and waste and pollution control. Additionally, students are given experience in plant design and layout, machine and wet process design and improvement, and designing and creating textile products. Throughout the textile engineering curriculum, students take classes from other engineering and disciplines including: mechanical, chemical, materials and industrial engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Portal:Textile_engineering|title=Portal:Textile engineering – Wikiversity|website=en.wikiversity.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advanced composite materials ===
[[Advanced composite materials (engineering)]] (ACMs) are also known as advanced polymer matrix composites. These are generally characterized or determined by unusually high strength fibres with unusually high stiffness, or modulus of elasticity characteristics, compared to other materials, while bound together by weaker matrices.   Advanced composite materials have broad, proven applications, in the aircraft, aerospace, and sports equipment sectors. Even more specifically ACMs are very attractive for aircraft and aerospace structural parts.  Manufacturing ACMs is a multibillion-dollar industry worldwide. Composite products range from skateboards to components of the space shuttle. The industry can be generally divided into two basic segments, industrial composites and advanced composites.

'''Instalaza SA''' is a [[Spain|Spanish]] firm that designs, develops and manufactures equipment and other military material for [[infantry]]. The company, founded in 1943, is headquartered in [[Zaragoza]] and its production plant is in [[Zaragoza]], [[Aragon]]. The company became famous for the production of highly accurate rocket launchers.
[[File:Instalaza 01.JPG|thumb|right|Instalaza plant in Zaragoza]]
Instalaza's professional experience is widely noted as a supplier of both the Spanish armed forces and countries around the world. Instalaza has had Pedro Morenés Eulate, Secretary of State for Defence between 1996 and 2000, Secretary of State Security from 2000 to 2002, Secretary of State for Science and Technology between 2002 and 2004, and currently Minister of Defense, as representative and consultant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Marco | first = Lucas | publisher = Periódico Diagonal | title = Un ex secretario de Estado de Aznar representa a una empresa que vende bombas de racimo | url = http://www.diagonalperiodico.net/spip.php?article6097 | accessdate = 28 January 2009 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2007, Instalaza SA had 140 employees, a covered plant area of {{convert|18000|sqm}}, capital worth more than 5&amp;nbsp;million Euros, and a revenue of 15 million Euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Jane's Military and Security Assessments | title = Instalaza SA (Spain), Contractors | url = http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-Naval-Construction-and-Retrofit-Markets/Instalaza-SA-Spain.html | accessdate = 18 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cluster munitions ban==
The company experienced a crisis in 2008 after the ban on cluster bombs enacted by the [[Convention on Cluster Munitions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Cotizalia | title = La compañía Instalaza, en quiebra técnica | url = http://www.cotizalia.com/cache/2008/10/18/noticias_68_compania_instalaza_quiebra_tecnica.html | accessdate = 28 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009, Instalaza still had the MAT-120 [[cluster bomb]] in its online catalog. Having been outlawed by the [[Convention on Cluster Munitions]], the Government ordered the shutdown of the weapon's production in line with its obligations under international law. After a public outcry highlighted by the media, Instalaza ended production of the MAT-120. However a note on the Instalaza website states that the weapon remains in the catalog as a mark of their technological prowess and states that the weapon is in compliance with Amended Protocol II of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Instalaza: Sobre el MAT-120 | publisher = Instalaza | url = http://www.instalaza.es/des.html | date = 20 January 2009 | accessdate = 25 May 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091224130742/http://www.instalaza.es/des.html | archivedate = 24 December 2009 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the manufacturer, the weapons produces 0.0% 'hazardous duds' by ensuring that in case the munition was not functioning upon impact, it would attempt to self-destruct in 20 seconds. If this was not possible, self-deactivation would occur after 10 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = INSTALAZA INTRODUCES THE [SD]² CONCEPT TO THE EXPERTS GROUP OF THE CCW AT GENEVA’S HEADQUARTER OF THE UNITED NATIONS | publisher = Instalaza | url = http://www.instalaza.es/eng/noticias2.html | date = 1 April 2008 | accessdate = 16 April 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110720142313/http://www.instalaza.es/eng/noticias2.html | archivedate = 20 July 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics argue that studies based on the [[Israel Military Industries|Israeli-made]] M-85, a different type of cluster munition, have indicated that items of [[unexploded ordnance]], whether or not they are armed, remain a serious hazard to civilian populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = M85: An analysis of reliability | publisher = NPA | url = http://www.stopclustermunitions.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/m85-analysis-of-reliability-npa.pdf| accessdate = 15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this type of hazard does not apply to the MAT-120, as if in the rare instance the self-destruction mechanism fails, in approximately 15 minutes after impact the electrical charge in the capacitor bleeds out, therefore rendering the submunition's electronic fuse system inoperative, making the dud submunition totally inert, unless the capacitor is deliberately recharged from an outside source.&lt;ref&gt;"Mortars Aim For More Capability" by Rubert Pengelley, Jane's IDR 1/1997 page 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;note2 - the first MAT-120 mortar bomb' submunition were called "Espin" by the manufacture and lacked the self-destruction feature, later MAT-120 submunitions with the self-destruction feature were called "Braco"&lt;/ref&gt; Amended Protocol II relates to mines, booby traps and other devices and is not relevant to the legal status of [[cluster munitions]]. Instalaza may not sell any patents related to the bomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | publisher = Qué.es (EFE) | title = Una empresa española oferta bombas racimo por Internet | url = http://www.que.es/ultimas-noticias/espana/200901271821-empresa-espanola-oferta-bombas-racimo.html | accessdate = 28 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the company managed to reorient its production and market new technology. As a result, Instalaza SA continues to produce military equipment for several countries around the world.

Instalaza in February 2013, presented its product design and production of arms and ammunition, in the Salon of Defense of Abu Dhabi, with great acceptance by buyers assistants, which reaffirms that the defense and security industry, are among the most active of the highest overall growth of Spanish exports between 2011 and 2013. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ateneadigital.es/RevistaAtenea/REVISTA/articulos/GestionNoticias_12073_ESP.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claimed use of cluster munitions in Libya===
On 15 April 2011, [[Human Rights Watch]] and the ''[[New York Times]]'' documented use of [[MAT-120]] cluster mortar rounds date-stamped 2007 in Misrata, [[Libya]] during sustained use of [[explosive weapons]] in populated areas by Gaddafi forces, although the Secretary of State of the USA,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | publisher = New York Times| title = Qaddafi Troops Fire Cluster Bombs Into Civilian Areas | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/16/world/africa/16libya.html?_r=1&amp;hp | accessdate = 15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hillary Clinton said she was “not aware” of the specific use of cluster or other indiscriminate weapons in Misurata .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | publisher = Human Rights Watch | title = Libya: Cluster Munition Strikes Misrata | url = https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/04/15/libya-cluster-munitions-strike-misrata | accessdate = 15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3726">'''Jusuf Wanandi''', [[Pseudonym|a.k.a.]] '''Lim Bian Kie''' ({{zh|c=林綿基|p=Lín Miánjī}}) is a [[Chinese-Indonesian]] politician and educator.

Wanandi was born in [[Sawahlunto]], [[West Sumatra]], on November 15, 1937.  He is the brother of [[Sofjan Wanandi]], a well-known figure in business circles in Jakarta.

== Education ==
After finishing his junior high school study in [[Padang, Indonesia|Padang]], Wanandi moved to [[Jakarta]] to enter the [[Jesuit]] [[Kanisius]] High School.  Later, he entered the Faculty of Law of [[Universitas Indonesia]] and graduated in 1960. Wanandi also took part in the Catholic leadership course taught by father [[Joop Beek]].

Shortly after finishing his high school studies Wanandi taught in his own alma mater, Kanisius High School for time. He later became an lecturer assistant at the [[University of Indonesia]] before becoming increasingly involved in political activities during the 1960s.

== Career ==
Wanandi was a leading student activist during the 1965-66 in Indonesia when, over time, president [[Sukarno]] was removed from power and [[Suharto|Soeharto]] became the second president of Indonesia.  Later, in 1971, he was one of the founders of the well-known [[Centre for Strategic and International Studies]] (CSIS) think tank in Jakarta and has continued to be active in the affairs of CSIS until the present.  During the 1970s and 1980s he was an adviser to president Soeharto on political and international affairs although, towards the end of the 1980s, Soeharto became less interested in receiving advice from Wanandi and other specialists in the CSIS.&lt;ref&gt;Jusuf Wanandi, ''Shades of Grey: A Political Memoir of Modern Indonesia 1965-1998, Equinox publishing, Singapore, 2012, 295pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1984, for a number of years he held a governor position at the [[East West Centre]] in [[Hawaii]].

He also had a political career in [[Golongan Karya]] (Golkar Party).  He held the position of vice general secretary.

Jusuf Wanandi has been for a number of years on the board of the main Jakarta daily ''[[The Jakarta Post]].''  From time to time, he contributes articles to the newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Such as Jusuf Wanandi, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/01/31/in-memoriam-ambassador-nobuo-matsunaga.html In Memoriam: Ambassador Nubuo Matsunaga'], and '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/06/15/in-memoriam-uncle-liem-sioe-liong.html In Memoriam: Uncle Liem Sioe Liong'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 15 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected as co-chair of the [[Pacific Economic Cooperation Council]] (PECC) in 2008.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="186306">The '''[[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC)''' is an [[United States|American]] [[terrestrial television|broadcast]] [[television network]] that originated in 1927 as the [[Blue Network|NBC Blue]] [[radio network]], and five years after its 1942 divorce from [[NBC]] and purchase by [[Edward J. Noble]] (adopting its current name the following year), expanded into television in April 1948. Throughout its history, the network has many [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated]] and [[network affiliate|affiliated stations]].

This article is a table listing of former ABC stations, arranged alphabetically by state, and based on the station's [[city of license]] as well as its [[media market|Designated Market Area]]; it is also accompanied by footnotes regarding the present network affiliation of the former ABC-affiliated station (if the station remains operational) and the current ABC affiliates in each of the listed markets, as well as any other notes including the reasons behind each station's disaffiliation from the network. There are links to and articles on each of the stations, describing their histories, local programming and technical information, such as broadcast frequencies.

The station's advertised channel number follows the call letters. In most cases, this is their [[virtual channel]] ([[Program and System Information Protocol|PSIP]]) number, which may match the channel allocation that the station originally broadcast on during its prior affiliation with the network.

In '''management accounting''' or '''managerial accounting,''' managers use the provisions of [[accounting]] information in order to better inform themselves before they decide matters within their organizations, which aids their management and performance of control functions.

==Definition==
[[Image:IFAC Definition of MA.jpg|thumb|450px|IFAC Definition of enterprise financial management concerning three broad areas: cost accounting; performance evaluation and analysis; planning and decision support. Managerial accounting is associated with  higher value, more predictive information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Evaluating and Improving Costing in Organizations (International Good Practice Guidance) |author=Professional Accountants in Business Committee |publisher=International Federation of Accountants |year=2009 |page=7 c|isbn=9781608150373 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Copyright July 2009, International Federation of Accountants'']]
One simple definition of management accounting is the provision of financial and non-financial decision-making information to managers.&lt;ref&gt;(Burns, Quinn, Warren &amp; Oliveira, ''Management Accounting'', McGraw-Hill, London, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Institute of Management Accountants]] (IMA): "Management accounting is a profession that involves partnering in management decision making, devising planning and performance management systems, and providing expertise in financial reporting and control to assist management in the formulation and implementation of an organization's strategy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of Management Accounting |publisher=Institute of Management Accountants |year=2008 |url=http://www.imanet.org/PDFs/Public/Research/SMA/Definition%20of%20Mangement%20Accounting.pdf |accessdate=4 December 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020120432/http://www.imanet.org/PDFs/Public/Research/SMA/Definition%20of%20Mangement%20Accounting.pdf |archivedate=20 October 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Management accountants (also called managerial accountants) look at the events that happen in and around a business while considering the needs of the business. From this, data and estimates emerge. Cost accounting is the process of translating these estimates and data into knowledge that will ultimately be used to guide decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.myaccountingcourse.com/accounting-dictionary/management-accounting|title=What is Management Accounting? - Definition - Meaning - Example|author=|date=|website=myaccountingcourse.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006162414/https://www.myaccountingcourse.com/accounting-dictionary/management-accounting|archivedate=6 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA), the largest management accounting institute with over 100,000 members describes "Management accounting as analysing information to advise business strategy and drive sustainable business success".

==Scope, practice, and application==
The Association of International Certified Professional Accountants (AICPA) states that management accounting as practice extends to the following three areas:
* [[Strategic management]] — advancing the role of the management accountant as a strategic partner in the organization
* [[Performance management]] — developing the practice of business decision-making and managing the performance of the organization
* [[Risk management]] — contributing to frameworks and practices for identifying, measuring, managing and reporting risks to the achievement of the objectives of the organization

The Institute of Certified Management Accountants (CMA) states, "A management accountant applies his or her professional knowledge and skill in the preparation and presentation of financial and other decision oriented information in such a way as to assist management in the formulation of policies and in the planning and control of the operation of the undertaking".

Management accountants are seen as the "value-creators" amongst the accountants. They are more concerned with forward looking and taking decisions that will affect the future of the organization, than in the historical recording and compliance (score keeping) aspects of the profession. Management accounting knowledge and experience can be obtained from varied fields and functions within an organization, such as information management, treasury, efficiency auditing, marketing, valuation, pricing and logistics. In 2014 CIMA created the Global Management Accounting Principles (GMAPs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cgma.org/Resources/Reports/Pages/GlobalManagementAccountingPrinciples.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423144019/http://www.cgma.org/Resources/Reports/Pages/GlobalManagementAccountingPrinciples.aspx |archivedate=2015-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of research from across 20 countries in five continents, the principles aim to guide best practice in the discipline.&lt;ref name=FT&gt;{{cite web|last=King|first=I.|title=New set of accounting principles can help drive sustainable success|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0b595a98-59fa-11e4-8771-00144feab7de.html?siteedition=uk#axzz3Q8Lp1OP9|publisher=ft.com|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences between financial accountancy and management accounting==
{{Refimprove|date=March 2017}}
Management accounting information differs from [[financial accountancy]] information in several ways:
* while shareholders, creditors, and public regulators use publicly reported financial accountancy, information, only managers within the organization use the normally confidential management accounting information
* while financial accountancy information is historical, management accounting information is primarily forward-looking;
* while financial accountancy information is case-based, management accounting information is model-based with a degree of abstraction in order to support generic decision making;
* while financial accountancy information is computed by reference to general financial accounting standards, management accounting information is computed by reference to the needs of managers, often using [[management information system]]s.
Focus:  
* Financial accounting focuses on the company as a whole.
* Management accounting provides detailed and disaggregated information about products, individual activities, divisions, plants, operations and tasks.

==Traditional versus innovative practices==
[[Image:Managerial Costing Timeline.jpg|thumb|left|500px|Managerial costing time line&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Presentation at IMA's annual conference - Managerial Costing Conceptual Framework Session |first=Anton |last=van der Merwe |date=7 September 2011 |place=Orlando, FL |publisher=Unpublished}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Used with permission by the author A. van der Merwe. Copyright 2011. All Rights Reserved.'']]

The distinction between '''traditional''' and '''innovative''' accounting practices is illustrated with the visual timeline ''(see sidebar)'' of managerial costing approaches presented at the [[Institute of Management Accountants]] 2011 Annual Conference.

[[Traditional standard costing]] (TSC), used in [[cost accounting]], dates back to the 1920s and is a central method in management accounting practiced today because it is used for financial statement reporting for the valuation of income statement and balance sheet line items such as [[cost of goods sold]] (COGS) and inventory valuation.  Traditional [[standard costing]] must comply with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP US) and actually aligns itself more with answering financial accounting requirements rather than providing solutions for management accountants.  Traditional approaches limit themselves by defining cost behavior only in terms of production or sales volume.

In the late 1980s, accounting practitioners and educators were heavily criticized on the grounds that management accounting practices (and, even more so, the curriculum taught to accounting students) had changed little over the preceding 60 years, despite radical changes in the business environment. In 1993, the Accounting Education Change Commission Statement Number 4&lt;ref name=AECC&gt;{{cite web|title=Positions and Issues|url=http://www.aaahq.org/AECC/PositionsandIssues/issues4.htm|work=Issues Statement Number 4: Improving the Early Employment Experience of Accountants|publisher=American Accounting Association|accessdate=2 November 2011|author=Accounting Education Change Commission|location=Sarasota, FL|year=1993|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427214402/http://aaahq.org/AECC/PositionsandIssues/issues4.htm|archivedate=27 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; calls for faculty members to expand their knowledge about the actual practice of accounting in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Clinton, B.D. |author2=Matuszewski, L. |author3=Tidrick, D. |title=Escaping Professional Dominance?|journal=Cost Management|year=2011|issue=Sep/Oct|publisher=Thomas Reuters RIA Group|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional accounting institutes, perhaps fearing that management accountants would increasingly be seen as superfluous in business organizations, subsequently devoted considerable resources to the development of a more innovative skills set for management accountants.

[[Variance (accounting)|Variance analysis]] is a systematic approach to the comparison of the actual and budgeted costs of the raw materials and labour used during a production period.  While some form of variance analysis is still used by most manufacturing firms, it nowadays tends to be used in conjunction with innovative techniques such as ''[[Whole-life cost|life cycle cost analysis]]'' and ''activity-based costing'', which are designed with specific aspects of the modern business environment in mind. ''Life-cycle costing'' recognizes that managers' ability to influence the cost of manufacturing a product is at its greatest when the product is still at the design stage of its product life-cycle (i.e., before the design has been finalized and production commenced), since small changes to the product design may lead to significant savings in the cost of manufacturing the products.

[[Activity-based costing]] (ABC) recognizes that, in modern factories, most manufacturing costs are determined by the amount of 'activities' (e.g., the number of production runs per month, and the amount of production equipment idle time) and that the key to effective cost control is therefore optimizing the efficiency of these activities.  Both lifecycle costing and activity-based costing recognize that, in the typical modern factory, the avoidance of disruptive events (such as machine breakdowns and quality control failures) is of far greater importance than (for example) reducing the costs of raw materials. Activity-based costing also de-emphasizes direct labor as a cost driver and concentrates instead on activities that drive costs, as the provision of a service or the production of a product component.

Other approach is the German [[Grenzplankostenrechnung]] (GPK) costing methodology. Although it has been in practiced in Europe for more than 50 years, neither GPK nor the proper treatment of 'unused capacity' is widely practiced in the U.S.&lt;ref name=MA_ATMP&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Clinton, B.D. |author2=Van der Merwe, Anton |title=Management Accounting - Approaches, Techniques, and Management Processes|journal=Cost Management|year=2006|issue=May/Jun|publisher=Thomas Reuters RIA Group|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another accounting practice available today is [[resource consumption accounting]] (RCA).  RCA has been recognized by the [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC) as a "sophisticated approach at the upper levels of the continuum of costing techniques"&lt;ref name=IGPG_Eval&gt;{{cite journal|author=Professional Accountants In Business Committee|title=International Good Practice Guidance: Evaluating and Improving Costing in Organizations|url=http://www.ifac.org/publications-resources/evaluating-and-improving-costing-organizations-0|date=July 2009|accessdate=10 November 2011|page=24|publisher=International Federation of Accountants|location=New York|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404144149/http://www.ifac.org/publications-resources/evaluating-and-improving-costing-organizations-0|archivedate=4 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach provides the ability to derive costs directly from operational resource data or to isolate and measure unused capacity costs.  RCA was derived by taking costing characteristics of GPK, and combining the use of activity-based drivers when needed, such as those used in activity-based costing.&lt;ref name=IGPG_Eval /&gt;

A modern approach to close accounting is continuous accounting, which focuses on achieving a point-in-time close, where accounting processes typically performed at period-end are distributed evenly throughout the period.

==Role within a corporation==
Consistent with other roles in modern corporations, management accountants have a dual reporting relationship. As a strategic partner and provider of decision based financial and operational information, management accountants are responsible for managing the business team and at the same time having to report relationships and responsibilities to the corporation's finance organization and finance of an organization.

The activities management accountants provide inclusive of forecasting and planning, performing variance analysis, reviewing and monitoring costs inherent in the business are ones that have dual accountability to both finance and the business team. Examples of tasks where accountability may be more meaningful to the business management team vs. the corporate finance department are the development of new product costing, [[operations research]], business driver metrics, sales management scorecarding, and client profitability analysis. (See [[financial modeling]].) Conversely, the preparation of certain financial reports, reconciliations of the financial data to source systems, risk and regulatory reporting will be more useful to the corporate finance team as they are charged with aggregating certain financial information from all segments of the corporation.

In corporations that derive much of their profits from the [[information economy]], such as banks, publishing houses, telecommunications companies and defence contractors, IT costs are a significant source of uncontrollable spending, which in size is often the greatest corporate cost after total compensation costs and property related costs. A function of management accounting in such organizations is to work closely with the IT department to provide [[IT cost transparency]].&lt;ref&gt;* "Taking Control of IT Costs". Nokes, Sebastian. London (Financial Times / Prentice Hall): March 20, 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-273-64943-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the above, one view of the progression of the accounting and finance career path is that financial accounting is a stepping stone to management accounting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cima P1 Exam Questions|url=http://www.cimapastpapers.com/how-to-pass-cima-p1-exam|accessdate=14 Nov 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114235651/http://www.cimapastpapers.com/how-to-pass-cima-p1-exam|archivedate=2016-11-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with the notion of value creation, management accountants help drive the success of the business while strict financial accounting is more of a compliance and historical endeavor.

==Specific methodologies==

===Activity-based costing (ABC)===
Activity-based costing was first clearly defined in 1987 by Robert S. Kaplan and W. Bruns as a chapter in their book Accounting and Management: A Field Study Perspective. They initially focused on the manufacturing industry, where increasing technology and productivity improvements have reduced the relative proportion of the direct costs of labor and materials, but have increased relative proportion of indirect costs. For example, increased automation has reduced labor, which is a direct cost, but has increased depreciation, which is an indirect cost.

===Grenzplankostenrechnung (GPK)===
{{Undue weight section|date=August 2018}}
{{main article|Grenzplankostenrechnung (GPK)}}
Grenzplankostenrechnung is a German costing methodology, developed in the late 1940s and 1960s, designed to provide a consistent and accurate application of how managerial costs are calculated and assigned to a product or service. The term Grenzplankostenrechnung, often referred to as GPK, has best been translated as either ''marginal planned cost accounting''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedl|first=Gunther|author2=Hans-Ulrich Kupper |author3= Burkhard Pedell|title=Relevance Added: Combining ABC with German Cost Accounting|journal=Strategic Finance|issue=June|pages=56–61|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''flexible analytic cost planning and accounting''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sharman|first=Paul A.|title=Bring On German Cost Accounting|journal=Strategic Finance|issue=December|pages=2–9|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of GPK are credited to Hans Georg Plaut, an automotive engineer, and Wolfgang Kilger, an academic, working towards the mutual goal of identifying and delivering a sustained methodology designed to correct and enhance cost accounting information. GPK is published in cost accounting textbooks, notably ''Flexible Plankostenrechnung und Deckungsbeitragsrechnung''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kilger|first=Wolfgang|others=Updated by Kurt Vikas and Jochen Pampel|title=Flexible Plankostenrechnung and Deckungsbeitragsrechnung|edition=12th|publisher=Gabler GmbH|location=Wiesbaden, Germany|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and taught at German-speaking universities.

===Lean accounting (accounting for lean enterprise)===
{{main article|Lean accounting}}
In the mid- to late-1990s several books were written about accounting in the lean enterprise (companies implementing elements of the [[Toyota Production System]]). The term ''lean accounting'' was coined during that period. These books contest that traditional accounting methods are better suited for mass production and do not support or measure good business practices in just-in-time manufacturing and services. The movement reached a tipping point during the 2005 Lean Accounting Summit in [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]], [[Michigan]], United States. 320 individuals attended and discussed the advantages of a new approach to accounting in the lean enterprise. 520 individuals attended the 2nd annual conference in 2006 and it has varied between 250 and 600 attendees since that time.

===Resource consumption accounting (RCA)===
{{main article|Resource Consumption Accounting}}
Resource consumption accounting (RCA) is formally defined as a dynamic, fully integrated, principle-based, and comprehensive management accounting approach that provides managers with decision support information for enterprise optimization. RCA emerged as a management accounting approach around 2000 and was subsequently developed at CAM-I,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.CAM-I.org|title=Consortium for Advanced Management International CAM-I|author=|date=|website=www.cam-i.org|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007163858/http://www.cam-i.org/|archivedate=7 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Consortium for Advanced Manufacturing–International, in a Cost Management Section ''RCA interest group''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cam-i.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=30 Cost Management Section ''RCA interest group''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207190442/http://www.cam-i.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=30 |date=2008-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in December 2001.

===Throughput accounting===
{{main article|Throughput accounting}}
The most significant recent direction in managerial accounting is throughput accounting; which recognizes the interdependencies of modern production processes. For any given product, customer or supplier, it is a tool to measure the contribution per unit of constrained resource.

===Transfer pricing===
{{main article|Transfer pricing}}
Management accounting is an applied discipline used in various industries. The specific functions and principles followed can vary based on the industry. Management accounting principles in banking are specialized but do have some common fundamental concepts used whether the industry is manufacturing-based or service-oriented. For example, transfer pricing is a concept used in manufacturing but is also applied in banking. It is a fundamental principle used in assigning value and revenue attribution to the various business units. Essentially, transfer pricing in banking is the method of assigning the interest rate risk of the bank to the various funding sources and uses of the enterprise. Thus, the bank's corporate treasury department will assign funding charges to the business units for their use of the bank's resources when they make loans to clients. The treasury department will also assign funding credit to business units who bring in deposits (resources) to the bank. Although the [[funds transfer pricing]] process is primarily applicable to the loans and deposits of the various banking units, this proactive is applied to all assets and liabilities of the business segment. Once transfer pricing is applied and any other management accounting entries or adjustments are posted to the ledger (which are usually memo accounts and are not included in the legal entity results), the business units are able to produce segment financial results which are used by both internal and external users to evaluate performance.

==Resources and continuous learning==
There are a variety of ways to keep current and continue to build one's knowledge base in the field of management accounting. [[Certified Management Accountants]] (CMAs) are required to achieve continuing education hours every year, similar to a Certified Public Accountant. A company may also have research and training materials available for use in a corporate owned library. This is more common in [[Fortune 500]] companies who have the resources to fund this type of training medium.

There are also journals, online articles and blogs available.  The journal ''Cost Management'' ({{ISSN|1092-8057}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ria.thomsonreuters.com/estore/printdetail.aspx?ID=ZMCMP |title=Cost Management |publisher=Thomson Reuters |year=2011 |accessdate=November 12, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421063935/http://ria.thomsonreuters.com/estore/printdetail.aspx?ID=ZMCMP |archivedate=April 21, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Institute of Management Accounting (IMA)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imanet.org/publications_maq.asp Institute of Management Accounting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071207160120/http://www.imanet.org/publications_maq.asp |date=2007-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; site are sources which include ''[[Management Accounting Quarterly]]'' and ''Strategic Finance'' publications.

[[File:Mary Anna Custis Lee CDV.jpg|thumb|upright|Mary Anna Custis Lee]]
'''Mary Anna Randolph Custis Lee''' (October 1, 1807 – November 5, 1873) was the great-granddaughter of [[Martha Custis Washington]] and wife of [[Robert E. Lee]], the prominent career military officer who commanded the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[Army of Northern Virginia]] during the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Perry, John. ''Mrs. Robert E. Lee : The Lady of Arlington''. Multnomah Publishers, 2003. {{ISBN|1-59052-137-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They married at her parents' home, [[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Arlington House]], in Virginia in 1831, and had seven children together; he predeceased her by three years.

==Biography==
[[File:East front of Arlington Mansion (General Lee's home), with Union soldiers on the lawn, 06-28-1864 - NARA - 533118.jpg|thumb|240px|East front of Custis Lee Mansion with Union Soldiers on lawn]]

Mrs. Lee was descended from several [[Colonial America|colonial]] and [[Southern United States|Southern]] families, including the Parke Custises, Fitzhughs, Dandriges, [[Randolph family of Virginia|Randolphs]], Rolfes, and Gerards. Through her paternal grandmother, [[Eleanor Calvert]], she descended from [[Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore]], making her a descendant of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] of England and Scotland. Through her mother, [[Mary Lee Fitzhugh Custis]], she was a descendant of [[William Fitzhugh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Arlington House: The Robert E. Lee Memorial|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=65MbMEG_VeQC&amp;pg=PA20|year=1986|publisher=Government Printing Office|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mary Anna Custis Lee was the only surviving child of [[George Washington Parke Custis]], [[George Washington]]'s step-grandson and adopted son and founder of [[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Arlington House]], and [[Mary Lee Fitzhugh Custis]], daughter of [[William Fitzhugh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=William Fitzhugh |url=http://www.nps.gov/frsp/fitzchm.htm |publisher=[[Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park]], [[National Park Service]] |accessdate=2009-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ann Bolling Randolph Fitzhugh. Her godmother, [[Mary Randolph]], the first person recorded buried at Arlington, wrote an early book on housekeeping and cooking. Lee's birth year is usually given as 1808, but it appears in the Custis family Bible and in records kept by her mother as 1807, and is also referred to in a letter her mother wrote in the autumn of 1807. She was born at [[Annefield (Boyce, Virginia)|Annefield]] in [[Clarke County, Virginia]] when her mother's coach stopped there during a journey.&lt;ref name="vaNRHPnom"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Clarke/021-0002_Annefield_1969_Final_Nomination.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Annefield |author=Virginia Historic Landmarks Commission Staff| date=July 1969 |publisher=Virginia Historic Landmarks Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was well educated, having learned both Latin and Greek.

She enjoyed discussing politics with her father, and later with her husband. She kept current with the new literature. After her father's death, she edited and published his writings as ''Recollections and Private Memoirs of Washington, by his Adopted Son George Washington Parke Custis, with a Memoir of this Author by his Daughter''&lt;ref&gt;Custis, G.W. Parke. ''Recollections and Private Memoirs of Washington by G. W. Parke Custis, of Arlington. Compiled from Files of the National Intelligencer, etc''. Washington: William H. Moore, 2007. ASIN B000ITPZ4Y.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1859.

Mrs Lee was diminutive and vivacious. She had known her third cousin, [[Robert E. Lee]], from childhood; her mother and Robert's mother were second cousins, and Lee's father Henry had delivered the eulogy to a crowd of 4,000 at George Washington's 1799 funeral.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gwpapers.virginia.edu/project/exhibit/mourning/response.html Henry Lee, "Eulogy for George Washington] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228192657/http://gwpapers.virginia.edu/project/exhibit/mourning/response.html |date=2012-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Mary Anna's other suitors was [[Sam Houston]].

[[File:Mary Anna Custis Lee cph.3b31907.jpg|thumb|upright|Engraving of Mary Anna Custis Lee, 1854]]

Mrs. Lee inherited Arlington House from her father after he died in 1857. The estate had long been the couple's home whenever they were in the area during her husband's military career. She was a gracious hostess and enjoyed frequent visitors. She was a painter, like her father, and painted many landscapes, some of which are still on view at the house. She loved roses and grew many varieties of trees and flowers in the gardens there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeVito|first1=Carlo|title=Mrs. Lee's Rose Garden: The True Story of the Founding of Arlington National Cemetery|date=2015|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oU5fBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT12#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=May 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deeply religious, Lee attended [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] services when there was one near the army post. From [[Arlington, Virginia]], the Lees attended [[Christ Church (Alexandria, Virginia)]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], which she and Robert had both attended in childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic Christ Church: History|url=http://www.historicchristchurch.org/about-us/history/history/|website=historicchristchurch.org|publisher=Christ Church, Alexandria|accessdate=December 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee taught her female slaves to read and write and was an advocate of eventual [[Abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]]. She did not free her slaves, but could have under state law of the time. She suffered from [[rheumatoid arthritis]], which became increasingly debilitating with advancing age. By 1861, she was using a wheelchair.

With the advent of the [[American Civil War]], Robert and their sons were called to service in Virginia. Mary Custis Lee delayed evacuating Arlington House until May 15, 1861. Early that month, Robert wrote to his wife saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;War is inevitable, and there is no telling when it will burst around you . . . You have to move and make arrangements to go to some point of safety which you must select. The Mount Vernon plate and pictures ought to be secured. Keep quiet while you remain, and in your preparations . . . May God keep and preserve you and have mercy on all our people.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Captain Robert E. (son). ''Recollections and Letters of General Robert E. Lee''. New York, Doubleday, Page &amp; Company, 1904. {{ISBN|978-1-4326-2231-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lee and her daughters initially moved among the several family plantations. In May 1862, she was caught at her son Rooney's [[White House Plantation]] in [[New Kent County, Virginia|New Kent County]] behind the [[Union (American Civil War)|Federal]] lines, as Union forces moved up the [[York River (Virginia)|York]] and the [[Pamunkey River|Pamunkey]] rivers toward Richmond. The Union commander, [[George B. McClellan]], allowed her passage through the lines in order to take up residence in Richmond—the city which was also McClellan's campaign goal.

Lee and her daughters settled at 707 East Franklin Street in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] for a time. The family next moved to the plantation estate of the Cocke family at [[Bremo Bluff, Virginia|Bremo Bluff]], where they sought refuge until after the end of the war in November 1865.&lt;ref name="MountVernon-20060822-religion"&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson|first=Mary V.|url=http://www.mountvernon.org/files/Religion-Appendix_4.pdf|title=Statements by Washington/Custis Family Members Concerning Religion, God, Life, Death, Charity, and Morality|publisher=[[The Mount Vernon Ladies' Association]]|date=August 22, 2006|accessdate=December 6, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804213338/http://www.mountvernon.org/files/Religion-Appendix_4.pdf|archivedate=August 4, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FluvannaReview-20080626"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holen|first=O.T.|url=http://www.fluvannareview.vivushosting.com/articleDisplay.aspx?NewsID=2352|title=Mrs. Robert E.

After the war, the Lees lived in [[Powhatan County]] for a short time before moving to [[Lexington, Virginia|Lexington]]. Robert E. Lee became president of the Washington College, later renamed [[Washington and Lee University]]. Mary Anna Custis Lee visited her beloved Arlington House one last time in 1873, a few months before her death.  She was unable to leave her horse carriage due to her debilitating rheumatoid arthritis, hardly recognizing the estate except for a few old oaks and some of the trees that she and Robert had planted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeVito|first1=Carlo|title=Mrs. Lee's Rose Garden: The True Story of the Founding of Arlington National Cemetery|date=2015|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|pages=91–94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oU5fBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT91#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=May 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mary Anna Randolph Custis Lee:Arlington House, The Robert E.

Mary Anna Custis Lee died at the age of 66, surviving her famous husband by three years. She is buried next to him in the Lee family crypt at [[Lee Chapel]] on the campus of [[Washington and Lee University]].

==Marriage and family==
Mary and Robert were married at her parents' home, Arlington House, on June 30, 1831. They had three sons and four daughters together: [[George Washington Custis Lee|George Washington Custis "Custis"]], [[William Henry Fitzhugh Lee|William H. Fitzhugh "Rooney"]], [[Robert E. Lee, Jr.|Robert Edward Jr.]], Mary, Eleanor Agnes (called Agnes), Anne, and Mildred Lee.

Sundqvist was born in 1950 in [[Offerdal]] in [[Krokom]] municipality in [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;Sveriges befolkning 1990. Sundqvist, Maths O.&lt;/ref&gt; He began his business career by developing his father's bus company and finally selling it in 1979 to the municipality of [[Östersund]] for 8.7 million [[Swedish kronor]].&lt;ref name="resume"&gt;[http://www.resume.se/nyheter/media/2012/09/23/lts-raddare-dod/ LT:s räddare död] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925053453/http://www.resume.se/nyheter/media/2012/09/23/lts-raddare-dod/ |date=2012-09-25 }}, Resume, September 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He used the proceeds to found his personal investment company ''Skrindan'', which grew aggressively to become a big player in real estate.&lt;ref name="resume"/&gt; In 1992, he rescued the local newspaper ''Länstidningen'' in [[Östersund]] as it fell into financial difficulties. In 2002 he controlled a majority stake at the ''Länstidningen'',&lt;ref name="resume"/&gt; as well as several other local companies.&lt;ref name="DN 2012"/&gt;

A '''national trade union center''' is a federation or confederation of [[trade union]]s in a single [[country]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HAGMFu2sAh8C&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=National+trade+union+centre+country&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZ4ayItdLWAhUMYVAKHSAEAWMQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=National%20trade%20union%20centre%20country&amp;f=false|title=Political Transformation, Structural Adjustment and Industrial Relations in Africa : English-speaking Countries: Proceedings Of, and Documents Submitted To, a Symposium (Arusha, United Republic of Tanzania, 1-4 February 1993).|last=Office|first=International Labour|date=1994|publisher=International Labour Organization|year=|isbn=9789221085195|location=|pages=30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly every country in the world has a national trade union center, and many have more than one. When there is more than one national center, it is often because of [[ideology|ideological]] differences—in some cases long-standing historic differences. In some regions, such as the [[Nordic countries]], different centers exist on a sectoral basis, for example for [[blue collar]] workers and [[professional]]s.

Among the larger national centers in the world are the [[American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations]] and the [[Change to Win Federation]] in the USA; the [[Canadian Labour Congress]]; the [[Trades Union Congress]] (TUC) in Britain; the [[Irish Congress of Trade Unions]]; the [[Australian Council of Trade Unions]] (ACTU); the [[Congress of South African Trade Unions]]; the Dutch [[Federatie Nederlandse Vakbeweging|FNV]]; the [[LO, The Danish Confederation of Trade Unions|Danish]], [[Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions|Norwegian]], and [[Swedish Trade Union Confederation|Swedish LO]]; the German [[German Confederation of Trade Unions|DGB]]; the French [[Confédération Générale du Travail|CGT]] and [[CFDT]]; the Italian [[Italian Confederation of Workers' Trade Unions|CISL]], [[Italian General Confederation of Labour|CGIL]] and [[Italian Labour Union|UIL]]; the Spanish [[Comisiones Obreras|CCOO]], [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]], [[Confederacion General del Trabajo de España|CGT]] and [[Unión Sindical Obrera|USO]]; the Czech [[Bohemian-Moravian Confederation of Trade Unions|ČMKOS]]; the Japan Trade Union Confederation [[RENGO]]; the Argentinian [[General Confederation of Labour (Argentina)|CGT]] and [[Argentine Workers' Center|CTA]]; the Brazilian [[Central Única dos Trabalhadores|CUT]], and so on.

Many national trade union centers are now members of the [[International Trade Union Confederation]], although some belong to the [[World Federation of Trade Unions]].

On August 18, 2000, a federal jury found the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)]] guilty of violating the civil rights of Dr. [[Marsha Coleman-Adebayo]] on the basis of race, sex, color and a hostile work environment, under the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. She was awarded $600,000. The EPA had refused to promote [[Marsha Coleman-Adebayo|Coleman-Adebayo]] shortly after she alleged the presence of environmental and health problems at the [[Brits, North West|Brits, South Africa]], [[vanadium]] mines.&lt;ref name="post"&gt;Fears, D., "Coming Soon: A Tale of Whistleblowing at the EPA," Washington Post, 10 July 2006. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/09/AR2006070900741_pf.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sparked by this outcome, [[Jim Sensenbrenner|Congressman F.James Sensenbrenner]], Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary Committee]] and [[Texas]] [[Sheila Jackson-Lee|Congresswoman Sheila Jackson-Lee]] introduced the No-FEAR Act into Congress. Dr. [[Marsha Coleman-Adebayo|Coleman-Adebayo]] founded the No FEAR Institute to organize support for the bill's purposes while continuing to work for the EPA.&lt;ref name="post"/&gt; The No FEAR Institute spearheaded the No FEAR Coalition to advocate for passage of the Act.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

[[George W. Bush|President George W. Bush]] signed it into law on May 15, 2002, making it the first [[United States]] [[civil rights]] law of the 21st Century.&lt;ref&gt;"Discrimination, Whistleblower, and Civil Rights Statutes," [https://www.employmentlawgroup.com/resources/statutes/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Marsha Coleman-Adebayo|Dr. Coleman-Adebayo]] and others have criticized implementation of the No-FEAR Act on grounds that agencies are abusing the provision allowing them a "reasonable" time to make their reimbursements to the General Fund of the Treasury.  They have proposed a No-FEAR II Act to set a time limit for such reimbursements, and to increase the penalties for violations.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

==Book and movie==

Coleman-Adebayo wrote a book about her experience&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marshacoleman-adebayo.com/no-fear-the-book.html&lt;/ref&gt; which as of 2014 is in the process of being adapted into the movie ''The Marsha Coleman-Adebayo Story''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marshacoleman-adebayo.com/no-fear-the-film.html&lt;/ref&gt; with producer and actor [[Danny Glover]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/09/AR2006070900741.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contract law}}

'''Novation''', in [[contract law]] and [[business law]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/understanding_derivatives/understanding_derivatives_chapter_1_derivatives_overview.pdf |title=Derivatives Overview|publisher=Chicago Fed|author=Richard Heckinger and David Mengle}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the act of:

# replacing an obligation to perform with another obligation; or
# adding an obligation to perform; or
# replacing a party to an agreement with a new party.

==Origins in Roman law ==

Novati, as a legal term is derived from the Roman law, in which ''novatio'' was of three kinds—substitution of a new debtor (''expromissio'', or ''delegatio''), of a new creditor (''cessio nominum vel actionum''), or of a new contract.&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 832"&gt;{{EB1911 |inline=y |wstitle=Novation |volume=19 |page=832}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[English law]] the term (though it occurs as early as [[Bracton]]) is scarcely naturalized, the substitution of a new debtor or creditor being generally called an assignment, and of a new contract a merger. It is doubtful, however, whether merger applies except where the substituted contract is one of a higher nature, as where a contract under seal supersedes a simple contract. Where one contract is replaced by another, it is of course necessary that the new contract should be a valid contract, founded upon sufficient consideration (see [[Contract]]). The extinction of the previous contract is sufficient consideration. The question whether there is a novation most frequently arises in the course of dealing between a customer and a new partnership, and on the assignment of the business of a life assurance company with reference to the assent of the policyholders to the transfer of their policies. The points on which novation turns are whether the new firm or company has assumed the liability of the old, and whether, the creditor has consented to accept the liability of the new debtors and discharge the old. The question is one of fact in each case. See especially the [[Life Assurance Companies Act 1872]], s. 7, where the word "novations" occurs in the marginal note to the section, and so has quasi-statutory sanction.&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 832"/&gt;

[[Scottish law]] seems to be more stringent than English law in the application of the doctrine of novation, and to need stronger evidence of the creditor's consent to the transfer of liability.&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 832"/&gt;

In American law, as in English, the term is something of a novelty, except in [[Louisiana]], where much of the civil law is retain.&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 832"/&gt;

==Novation vs. assignment==
In contrast to an [[Assignment (law)|assignment]], which is generally valid as long as the other party is given notice (except where the obligation is specific to the obligor, as in a personal service contract with a specific ballet dancer, or where assignment would place a new and special burden on the counterparty), a novation is valid only with the consent of all parties to the original agreement.&lt;ref name=duha1&gt;{{cite web|last=Duhaime|first=Lloyd|title=Part 6: Restraint of Trade, Assignment, Novation &amp; Frustration|url=http://www.duhaime.org/LegalResources/Contracts/LawArticle-91/Part-6-Restraint-of-Trade-Assignment-Novation-Frustration.aspx|work=duhaime.org|publisher=Duhaime's Contract Law|accessdate=30 July 2013|date=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A contract transferred by the novation process transfers all duties and obligations from the original obligor to the new obligor.

==Examples of novation==
For example, if there exists a contract whereby Dan will give a TV to Alex, and another contract whereby Alex will give a TV to Becky, then, it is possible to novate both contracts and replace them with a single contract wherein Dan agrees to give a TV to Becky. In contrast to assignment, novation requires the consent of all parties. [[Consideration]] is still required for the new contract, but it is usually assumed to be the discharge of the former contract.

Another classic example is when Company A enters a contract with Company B and a novation is included to ensure that if Company B sells, merges or transfers the core of their business to another company, the new company assumes the obligations and liabilities that Company B has with Company A under the contract. So in terms of the contract, a purchaser, merging party or transferee of Company B steps into the shoes of Company B with respect to its obligations to Company A.  Alternatively, a "novation agreement" may be signed after the original contract&lt;ref name=duha2&gt;{{cite web|last=Duhaime|first=Lloyd|title=Novation Definition|url=http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/N/Novation.aspx|work=duhaime.org|publisher=Duhaime's Legal Dictionary|accessdate=30 July 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in the event of such a change. This is common in contracts with governmental entities; an example being under the United States [[Anti-Assignment Act]], the governmental entity that originally issued the contract must agree to such a transfer or it is automatically invalid by law.

The criteria for novation comprise the obligee's acceptance of the new obligor, the new obligor's acceptance of the liability, and the old obligor's acceptance of the new contract as full performance of the old contract. Novation is not a unilateral contract mechanism, hence allows room for negotiation on the new T&amp;Cs under the new circumstances. Thus, 'acceptance of the new contract as full performance of the old contract' may be read in conjunction to the phenomenon of 'mutual agreement of the T&amp;Cs'.&lt;ref name=duha1 /&gt;

==Application in financial markets==
[http://chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/understanding_derivatives/understanding_derivatives_chapter_1_derivatives_overview.pdf: Novation] is also used in [[Futures contract|futures]] and [[Option (finance)|options]] trading to describe a special situation where the [[Clearing house (finance)|central clearing house]] interposes itself between buyers and sellers as a legal counter party, i.e., the clearing house becomes buyer to every seller and vice versa. This obviates the need for ascertaining credit-worthiness of each counter party and the only [[credit risk]] that the participants face is the risk of the clearing house defaulting. In this context, novation is considered a form of [[financial risk management|risk management]].

The term is also used in markets that lack a centralized clearing system, such as [[Swap (finance)|swap]] trading and certain [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter (OTC)]] [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]], where "novation" refers to the process where one party to a contract may assign its role to another, who is described as "stepping into" the contract. This is analogous to selling a future contract.

Soldiers of the newly arrived 575th Aerial Support Medical Company discovered at [[Kandahar Airfield]] October 1, 2009, that roughly $2 million worth of their company's medical equipment had been stolen in transit.]]

'''Pilferage''' is the [[theft]] of part of the contents of a package. It may also include theft of the contents but leaving the package, perhaps resealed with bogus contents.  Small packages can be pilfered from a larger package such as a [[shipping container]].  Broader and related aspects of [[theft]] may include taking the entire package, pallet load, truck load, [[shoplifting]], etc.

==Solutions==
Solutions involve ''all phases'' of product production, [[packaging]], distribution, [[logistics]], sale, and use. No single solution is considered as "pilfer proof". Often, [[packaging engineer]]s, [[logistics]] engineers, and security professionals have  addressed multiple levels of [[security]]  to reduce the risk of pilfering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Each situation is unique.  Some considerations have included:
* Identifying who a potential pilferer might be: an internal employee, security guard, truck driver, delivery person, receiver (consignee), organized crime, etc. Engineers usually start with knowing what level of knowledge, materials, tools, etc. might they have.
* Identifying all feasible methods of unauthorized access into a product, package, or system. In addition to the primary means of entry, engineers also consider secondary or "back door" methods. 
* Identifying available means of resealing, reclosing, or replacing special seals. 
* Using extra strong and secure packaging: A weak or damaged package is an invitation to pilferage.
* Considering unique custom seals and [[label]]s (changing regularly because these are subject to [[counterfeit]]ing)
* Improving the pilfer resistance to make pilfering more difficult, time-consuming, etc. 
* Concealing the identity and value of a pilferable item.  Logistics and packaging professionals do not want to bring attention to the item, its package, addresses, names, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8156">The '''Philadelphia Fed Report''', formally known as the '''Business Outlook Survey''' and sometimes abbreviated as '''BOS''', is a monthly survey produced by the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]] (informally known as the Philadelphia Fed) which questions manufacturers on general business conditions. The index covers the Third Federal Reserve District (the jurisdiction of the Philadelphia Fed), namely  covers eastern and central [[Pennsylvania]], the nine southern counties of [[New Jersey]], and [[Delaware]].&lt;ref name=official&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phil.frb.org/research-and-data/regional-economy/business-outlook-survey/|title = Business Outlook Survey|publisher = [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]]|accessdate = April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report is sometimes also called the '''Philadelphia Fed Index''' because it includes reporting of some index values.&lt;ref name=investopedia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/philadelphia-fed-survey.asp|title = Philadelphia Fed Survey|publisher = [[Investopedia]]|accessdate = April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=investopedia2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/philadelphiafederalindex.asp|title = Philadelphia Federal Index|publisher = [[Investopedia]]|accessdate = April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Philadelphia Fed Report has been published monthly since May 1968, and archives for all historical data (revised to account for seasonal adjustments) are available on the website.&lt;ref name=historical&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phil.frb.org/research-and-data/regional-economy/business-outlook-survey/historical-data/|title = Business Outlook Survey Historical Data|date = January 9, 2014|accessdate = April 22, 2014|publisher = [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details and data reported==

===Release schedule===

The Philadelphia Index is conducted monthly by the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]] and questions voluntary participants on things such as unemployment, new orders, shipments, inventories, and prices paid. The report is released on the third Thursday of every month, making it the earliest such regional report which is released to investors.&lt;ref name=official/&gt;&lt;ref name=investopedia2/&gt; For instance, the report for April 2014 was released on Thursday, April 17, 2014.&lt;ref name=april-2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phil.frb.org/research-and-data/regional-economy/business-outlook-survey/2014/bos0414.cfm|title = April 2014 Business Outlook Survey|accessdate = April 22, 2014|date = April 17, 2014|publisher = [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Survey questions===

The survey is a one-page survey asking respondents to include their name, title, company name, and mailing address, and then seeking their opinion on how they think various indicators related to business changed over the past month, as well as how they anticipate it changing over the next 6 months. For each question, they may select between the options of ''decrease'', ''no change'', and ''increase''.&lt;ref name=sample&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phil.frb.org/research-and-data/regional-economy/business-outlook-survey/SampleBOSForm.pdf|title = Business Outlook Survey Questionnaire Sample|accessdate = April 22, 2014|publisher = [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The questions include:

* '''General Business Conditions''': What is your evaluation of the level of general business activity?
* '''Company Business Indicators''':
** New orders
** Shipments
** Unfilled orders
** Delivery times
** Inventories
** Prices paid
** Prices received
** Number of employees
** Average employee workweek
** Capital expenditures

The percentage of respondents selecting particular responses can be accessed, and charted over time to compare responses in different months.&lt;ref name=april-2014/&gt;

Higher survey figures suggest higher production, which contribute to economic growth. Results are calculated as the difference between percentage scores with zero acting as the centerline point. As such, values greater than zero indicate growth, while values less than zero indicate contraction.&lt;ref name=investopedia/&gt;

Some months have additional special questions included in the survey. For instance, the month of April 2014 asked the following questions:&lt;ref name=april-2014/&gt;

# How important are the following factors in influencing your firm’s decision to remain in the three-state region?
# Have the same factors become more or less important in recent years?

for the following list of factors:

* Availability of skilled labor
* Cost of labor
* Taxes/subsidies/regulation
* Cost of energy
* Proximity of customers
* Proximity to distribution channels
* Proximity to suppliers/raw materials

'''Producer's risk''' is the [[probability]] that a good [[product (business)|product]] will be rejected as a bad product by the [[consumer]]. Or rejecting the lot of satisfactory quality is a risk faced by any producer, the probability of rejecting a lot under the sampling inspection plan is called '''Producer's risk'''. 

When the acceptance reliability level (ARL) is pi0, we can define the producer's risk as:
P(Test is Failed|pi0)

It calculates the probability of loss from (1) rejecting a batch which, in fact, should have been accepted, or (2) accepting a batch that, in fact, will be rejected by the customer. As in Hypothesis testing when a null hypothesis is rejected when it is true.
It is also called Type I error or Alfa error.

'''Prudential regulation''' is type of [[financial regulation]] that requires financial firms to control risks and hold adequate capital as defined by [[capital requirements]].  This is in contrast to consumer protection rules that are also part of financial regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-1670460/Prudential-regulation.html |title=Prudential regulation |publisher=This is Money |date=April 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prudential regulation can be split into [[microprudential regulation]] that focuses on the individual firms and making sure that they can withstand shocks and [[macroprudential regulation]] that looks at the whole financial system and [[systemic risk]].  

Some countries have separated their financial regulators along the lines of prudential/consumer protection such as the UK with the [[Prudential Regulation Authority (United Kingdom)|Prudential Regulation Authority]] or in Australia with the [[Australian Prudential Regulation Authority]].

'''Robert T. Davies''' (May 19, 1849 - March 22, 1916) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] businessman and [[thoroughbred]] and [[standardbred]] [[horse racing|racehorse]] owner and [[Horse breeding|breeder]].

Born in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], he studied at Park School and [[Upper Canada College]], in the early 1870s Robert Davies married Margaret Anne Taylor, the daughter of [[John Taylor (paper manufacturer)|John Taylor]], owner of [[paper mill]]s in [[Todmorden Mills|Todmorden Mills, Ontario]], just north of Toronto. By the turn of the century, they had eight children and owned a large home at 244 Don Mills Rd (now Broadview/O'Connor) in [[Todmorden Mills]] they called "Chester Park."

Davies' brother Thomas Davies owned the [[Don Brewery]] at Queen Street at the Don River, which Robert helped manage. In 1877, Robert Davies founded the competing [[Dominion Brewery]] only two blocks to the west on Queen Street. Ten years later, his success led to the selling of shares in the company to a group of investors arranged by a [[London]], [[England]] banking house. After his wife's family encountered financial difficulties, in 1901 Davies acquired most of the Taylor family holdings in the [[Don River (Ontario)|Don Valley]], including two [[paper mills]] and the [[Don Valley Brick Works]]. By the time of his death in 1916, Robert Davies was one of the wealthiest people in Toronto.

==Thoroughbred racing==
As a boy, Robert Davies developed a love for [[horse racing]] and for a while was on [[jockey]] in Thoroughbred [[flat racing]]. In 1865 at the racetrack in [[London, Ontario]], the then sixteen-year-old rode in that year's edition of the [[Queen's Plate]]. He soon turned to training his own horses and at age twenty-two raced and trained [[Floss (horse)|Floss]] who won the 1871 edition of the Plate. The following year, a horse he bred named [[Fearnaught]] won the Plate. As of 2008 Robert Davies is the only person to ever ride in the Queen's Plate as well as own, train and breed winners of that race.

Davies purchased the filly [[Southern Maid (horse)|Southern Maid]] from [[Kentucky]] breeder, [[John E. Madden]]. A daughter of 1898 [[Kentucky Derby]] winner, [[Plaudit]], Southern Maid was voted the retrospective [[American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly]] of 1913. As a broodmare for the Davies family, she produced 1922 [[Queen's Plate|King's Plate]] winner, [[South Shore (horse)|South Shore]].

In 1888, Davies purchased a large property in the Don Valley from his father-in-law on which he established a breeding operation he dubbed Thorncliffe Farms.  He raced horses both in Thoroughbred [[flat racing]] and in [[harness racing]] under the ''[[Glossary of North American horse racing|nom de course]]'', [[Thorncliffe Stable]].

Davies served as president of the Canadian Horse Breeder's Association. A vice-president of the [[Ontario Jockey Club]] from 1895 to 1904, he unsuccessfully lobbied for the lifting of the rule that prevented horses foaled outside of the [[Province of Ontario]] from competing in the [[Queen's Plate|King's Plate]].

Robert Davies died in 1916 at "Chester Park" and was buried in the [[Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto|Mount Pleasant Cemetery]] in Toronto. For his contribution to the industry, in 2001 he was inducted in the [[Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame]] in the Builders category. His estate sold Thorncliffe Farms to a group of investors from [[Baltimore, Maryland]] who built a horse [[Thorncliffe Park#Thorncliffe Park Raceway|Thorncliffe Park Raceway]].

Davie's [[Dominion Brewery]] complex at Queen Street East and Sumach Street continued until 1936, but the brewery complex was renovated from 1987 to 1990 and is now Dominion Square (and used by Vistek as commercial office space) and the old [[Dominion Hotel, Toronto|Dominion Hotel]] is now home to the pub Dominion on Queen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3466">'''Rules of origin''' are used to determine the [[country of origin]] of a product for purposes of [[international trade]].  There are two common types of rules of origin depending upon application, the preferential and non-preferential rules of origin (19 CFR 102).   The exact rules vary from country to country, from agreement to agreement.

== Non-preferential ==
Non-preferential rules of origin are used to determine the country of origin for certain purposes.
These purposes ''may'' be for quotas, anti-dumping, anti-circumvention, statistics or origin labelling.

The basis for the non-preferential rules originates from the Kyoto convention&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/trade/kyoto/ky-d1-e0.htm|title=Trade Programme – Trade – UNECE|website=www.unece.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which states that if a product is wholly obtained or produced completely within one country the product shall be deemed having origin in that country. For a product which has been produced in more than one country the product shall be determined to have origin in the country where the '''last substantial transformation''' took place.

To determine exactly what was the last substantial transformation, three general rules are applied:
# Change of tariff classification (on any level, though 4-digit level is the most common)
# Value added-rule ([[ad valorem]])
# Special processing rule, the minimum transformation is described. For instance, in the EU non-preferential rules of origin for T-shirts (HS6109), the origin is supposed to be in the country where the ''complete making-up'' was done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/Result.do?direct=yes&amp;lang=en&amp;consleg=01993R2454|title=EUR-Lex – Simple search&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the non-preferential rules a product always has exactly one country of origin.  However, the non-preferential rules may differ from country to country; the same product may have different origins depending on which country's scheme is applied. Usually it is the rules of the country into which a product is being imported that apply.

== Preferential ==
Preferential RoO are part of a [[free trade area]] or preferential trade arrangement which includes tariff concessions. These trade arrangements might be unilateral, bilateral or regional (also sometimes called multilateral) trade arrangements. The rules of origin determine what products can benefit from the tariff concession or preference, in order to avoid [[transshipment]].

'''Theodore Pitcairn''' (November 5, 1893 – December 17, 1973) the son of [[PPG Industries]] founder [[John Pitcairn Jr.|John Pitcairn]], was a clergyman, theologian, philanthropist, and connoisseur of the arts and antiquities.

== Early life and education ==
[[File:Cairnwood, Bryn Athyn, PA 01.JPG|thumb|left|Cairnwood, Pitcairn's boyhood home.]]
Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on November 5, 1893, he was the fourth son and fifth child of John and Gertrude Pitcairn''.''The family moved from Philadelphia to their newly built home, [[Cairnwood]], in Huntingdon Valley in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=John Pitcairn: Uncommon Entrepreneur, a Biography|last=Gladish|first=Richard|publisher=Academy of the New Church|year=1989|isbn=0910557225|location=Bryn Athyn, PA|pages=297–300}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pitcairn spent his early school years in the [[Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania|Bryn Athyn]] parish schools of the [[General Church of the New Jerusalem]], which follows the teachings of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]]. He received his high school diploma from the Academy of the New Church Boys College in 1913. After attending the University of Pennsylvania, Pitcairn made the decision to study at the [[Academy of the New Church Theological School]]. He graduated in June, 1918, with a Bachelor of Theology degree.

== Early career ==
Ordained into the priesthood of the General Church in 1917,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1917|title=Directory of the General Church 1917|url=http://www.heavenlydoctrines.org/dtSearch.html|journal=New Church Life|doi=|pmid=|access-date=April 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pitcairn worked with the church missions and taught theology to African students in South Africa and Lesotho (then known as Basutoland).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1919|title=Church News|url=http://www.heavenlydoctrines.org/dtSearch.html|journal=New Church Life p. 767|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as Pastor of the Durban Society in [[Natal Province|Natal, South Africa]], and later as Assistant Pastor of the Bryn Athyn Church. During this time, he also served as Acting Pastor of the Circle at [[Seine-et-Marne]], France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whitehead|first=William|date=1931|title=Report of the Council of the Clergy|url=http://www.heavenlydoctrines.org/dtSearch.html|journal=New Church Life, p. 244|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pitcairn taught art history, history of education, and a course on the "Human Organic" at the Academy College.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whitehead|first=William|date=1929|title=Report of the Council of the Clergy|url=http://www.heavenlydoctrines.org/dtSearch.html|journal=New Church Life, p. 312|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Establishment of a new church ==

In the late 1930s, doctrinal differences within the General Church led Pitcairn and several other church members to found a new branch of the New Church known as [[Lord's New Church Which Is Nova Hierosolyma|The Lord's New Church Which Is Nova Hierosolyma]]. In 1939, Pitcairn established a non-profit corporation for the purposes of promoting and maintaining the new church. He served as pastor of the Philadelphia Society of The Lord's New Church until 1960, when leadership of the church passed to Philip N. Odhner.

== Author ==

Pitcairn wrote several doctrinal works, including ''The Book Sealed with Seven Seals'' (1927); ''The Seven Days of Creation'' (1930); and ''My Lord and My God: Essays on Modern Religion, the Bible and Emanuel Swedenborg'' (1967). In 1969 the church published ''The Beginning and Development of Doctrine in the New Church'' by Theodore Pitcairn, bound together with ''Notes on the Development of Doctrine in the Church'' by Philip N. Odhner.

== Art collector ==

Over the years, Pitcairn traveled extensively in Europe, where he further developed his keen interest in fine art. He acquired paintings by El Greco, Claude Monet, Rembrandt, and Vincent van Gogh.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, G., Hurst, S,. &amp; Morley S. (2006, 2013''). A Draft Timeline of the Life of Theodore Pitcairn 1893-1973''. "Paintings/Art Objects." [[Glencairn Museum]] Archives. Bryn Athyn, PA.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hoving]], former Director of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], described meeting the Reverend Pitcairn in the course of negotiating the purchase of [[Garden at Sainte-Adresse (Monet)|''Garden at Sainte-Adresse'']] by [[Claude Monet]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoving, Thomas, ''Making the Mummies Dance'', 1993, pp. 135-141, Touchstone, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; While searching for a suitable portrait painter for church dignitaries—Bishop [[William Frederic Pendleton]] and Bishop Nathaniel Dandridge Pendleton—Pitcairn met the young artist, through the efforts of Ernst Pfeiffer, in 1921 at the home of the banker and art collector Nicolaas Urban. Impressed by Smit's style, Pitcairn purchased ''Marijke with White Feather Fan'', a portrait of Urban's daughter. He subsequently met Maryke, the subject of the painting, and they were married in 1926.&lt;ref name="Pittsburgh Post-Gazette"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Linder|first1=Lee|title=Clergyman Becomes Talk of Art Word|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&amp;dat=19671226&amp;id=PSgjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bWwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6930,4540430|accessdate=9 July 2016|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=Dec 26, 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theodore and Maryke (September 7, 1905 - November 10, 1978) were the parents of nine children. Maryke's mother, Berendina, married Philippe Smit in 1941 after her divorce from Nicolaas Urban (1929).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.philippesmit.com|title=Philippe Smit|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the painter’s life until his death in 1948 and even after that, Pitcairn acquired the majority of the artist’s works.

== Patron of the arts ==
Pitcairn's love of antiquities is evident in the art studio he built for Smit on the grounds of his estate in Bryn Athyn. Designed by famed Philadelphia architect [[George Howe (architect)|George Howe]], of [[Mellor Meigs &amp; Howe]], the building incorporates 12th century French stone columns and an Italian stone-carved fireplace. The heavy wooden doors are embellished with ironwork by the metalworker, [[Samuel Yellin]]. The studio now serves as the  Chapel of The Lord's New Church. Many of Smit's paintings were hung in the chapel and in the Pitcairns' colonial-era home in Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania.

Pitcairn was a major benefactor of the Philadelphia Orchestra during the time [[Eugene Ormandy]] served as conductor [citation needed].

== Death ==

Pitcairn died at his home in Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania on December 17, 1973. His wife, Maryke, died five years later, in 1978.

'''''Windfall: The Oil Crisis Game''''' is a real-time [[business simulation game]] developed by [[David Mullich]] in [[1980 in video gaming|1980]] for the [[Apple II]].  Based upon [[queuing theory]] and released after the [[1979 energy crisis]], the game puts the player in the role of chief executive of Engulf Oil, setting gas prices and worker salaries, monitoring gas station lines, scheduling oil tanker arrivals, and negotiating oil prices with OPEC countries in a race against the clock to maximize profits.  As with most Edu-Ware games, ''Windfall'' has an educational aspect, demonstrating the delicate balance in complex systems.

==Gameplay==

The player has six primary choices in this simulation of oil company operations:

# Observe Service Stations: A low-resolution graphics display appears, showing six service stations, two of which are under the player's control, while the other four are operated by computer-controlled competitors.  Small colored blocks entering the queue at each station represent thousands of cars. The queue length at each station is an indicator of the gasoline demand at the current selling price and the time it takes for each station to service cars.
# Observe Dock Yards: Another low-resolution graphics display appears, depicting oil tankers arriving at the docks.  The queue length at each dock is an indicator of the oil supply at the current purchase price and the time it takes for each dock to service each tanker.
# Service Station Statistics: A table of text information allows players to see such things as the amount of gasoline each station has to sell, how long the waiting queue of cars is, how much the rival stations may be undercutting the player's prices.
# Dock Yard Statistics: This text table shows players how much they are paying oil producers, how efficient the oil flow from their suppliers is, how much they are paying their dock workers.  Sometimes bad weather may slow down the arrival of ships.
# Set Wages, Prices, and Purchases: Here players can change the price of gasoline, wages of their station attendants, and select their oil source from among several fictional OPEC countries.
# Financial Status: This screen allows players to see the financial health of their company, buy or sell stock, and make an attempt at [[price fixing]].

Strategy is based upon several simple economic principles.  If players pay their employees poorly, the service time will be longer; however, if players pay them too much, prices will need to be raised to maintain a profit, but competitors may steal business away with lower prices.  If gasoline prices go too high, the government may step in and set price limits.  Occasionally, stockholders will overrule players' decisions.

A clock runs continuously through the game.  When time expires, the player's performance is evaluated.

==Reception==

''Windfall'', like most games from Edu-Ware's zip-lock bag era, sold only a few hundred units.{{cn|date=October 2017}} However, it was well reviewed, receiving an "A" rating from ''Peelings II'' magazine, which concluded, "Behind the simple displays is (probably) a reasonably sophisticated realtime simulation program synthesized with a realtime display updated.  Considering the programming effort involved and the educational value of the program, it is a bargain.  And it is great fun to play."{{cn|date=October 2017}}

Bruce Webster reviewed ''Windfall'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 31.&lt;ref name="SG"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Webster|first=Bruce |date=September 1980 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=31|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Webster commented that "If there is a problem with this game, it is that the topic may not be all that interesting to you, or that the treatment may be too simple for your tastes. Beyond that, I can think of no serious objections to the game."&lt;ref name="SG"/&gt;

'''Workerism''' is a political theory that emphasizes the importance of, or glorifies, the working class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/workerism|title=workerism - definition of workerism in English - Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Workerism, or '''''operaismo''''', was of particular significance in Italian [[left politics]].

==As revolutionary praxis==
{{See also|Autonomism}}

Workerism (or ''operaismo'') is a political analysis, whose main elements were to merge into [[autonomism]], that starts out from the power of the working class.  [[Michael Hardt]] and [[Antonio Negri]], known as operaist and autonomist writers, offer a definition of operaismo, quoting from Marx as they do so:

:''Operaismo'' builds on Marx's claim that [[Capital (economics)|capital]] reacts to the struggles of the working class; the working class is active and capital reactive. 
:Technological development: Where there are strikes, machines will follow. "It would be possible to write a whole history of the inventions made since 1830 for the sole purpose of providing capital with weapons against working-class revolt." (''Capital'', Vol. 1, Chapter 15, Section 5)
:Political development: The factory legislation in England was a response to the working class struggle over the length of the working day. "Their formulation, official recognition and proclamation by the State were the result of a long class struggle." (''Capital'', Vol. 1, Chapter 10, Section 6)
:''Operaismo'' takes this as its fundamental axiom: the struggles of the working class ''precede'' and ''prefigure'' the successive re-structurations of capital. [http://www.eurozine.com/articles/2002-02-13-hardtnegri-en.html]

The workerists followed Marx in seeking to base their politics on an investigation of working class life and struggle. Through translations made available by [[Danilo Montaldi]] and others, they drew upon previous activist research in the United States by the [[Johnson-Forest Tendency]] and in France by the group [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]]. The Johnson-Forest Tendency had studied working class life and struggles within the [[Detroit]] auto industry, publishing pamphlets such as "The American Worker" (1947), "Punching Out" (1952) and "Union Committeemen and Wildcat Strikes" (1955). That work was translated into French by Socialisme ou Barbarie and published, serially, in their journal. They too began investigating and writing about what was going on inside workplaces, in their case inside both auto factories and insurance offices.

The journal ''[[Quaderni Rossi]]'' ("Red Notebooks", 1961–5), along with its successor ''[[Classe Operaia]]'' ("Working Class", 1963–6), both founded by Negri and Tronti, developed workerist theory, focusing on the struggles of proletarians.

Associated with this theoretical development was a [[praxis (process)|praxis]] based on workplace organising, most notably by [[Lotta Continua]]. This reached its peak in the Italian "[[Hot Autumn]]" of 1969.

By the mid-1970s, however, the emphasis shifted from the factory to "the [[social factory]]"—the everyday lives of working people in their communities. The ''operaist'' movement was increasingly known as [[autonomist]].

==As a negative cultural phenomenon==
More broadly, workerism can imply the idealization of workers, especially manual workers, [[working class culture]] (or an idealized conception of it) and [[manual labour]] in general. [[Socialist realism]] is an example of a form of expression that would be likely to be accused of workerism in this sense, but this also applies to [[Fascism]], such as [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s [[Falangist]] movement, which often used [[propaganda]] showing workers living and working in equitable conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Granada, "The Spanish Revolution."&lt;/ref&gt;

The charge of workerism is often levelled at [[syndicalist]]s.  Traditional communist parties are also thought to be workerist, because of their supposed glorification of manual workers to the exclusion of white-collar workers.

This use of the term was the most common [[English language]] use during the twentieth century.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}
