'''''1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)''''' is the debut [[album|studio album]] by British [[electronic music|electronic]] band [[The KLF|The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu]] (the JAMs), later known as [[the KLF]]. ''1987'' was produced using extensive unauthorised [[Sampling (music)|samples]] that plagiarized a wide range of musical works, continuing a theme begun in the JAMs' debut single "[[All You Need Is Love (The JAMs song)|All You Need Is Love]]". These samples provided a deliberately provocative backdrop for [[beatbox]] rhythms and cryptic, political raps. The album was released to mixed reviews, but was a commercial success.

Shortly after [[independent record label|independent release]] in June 1987, the JAMs were ordered by the [[Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society]] to destroy all unsold copies of the album, following a complaint from [[ABBA]]. In response, the JAMs disposed of many copies of ''1987'' in unorthodox, publicised ways. They also released a version of the album titled ''1987 (The JAMs 45 Edits)'', stripped of all unauthorised samples to leave periods of protracted silence and so little audible content that it was formally classed as a [[12-inch single]].

A limited edition release subjected to recall and a destruction order, ''1987'' became something of a rarity and by 2000, mint condition copies were trading for £60.

==Background and recording==
On New Year's Day 1987, [[Bill Drummond]] decided to make a [[hip hop music|hip hop]] record under the pseudonym "the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu".&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC Radio 1]] "Story of Pop" documentary interview with Bill Drummond. First BBC broadcast believed to have been in [http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/series/STORY+OF+POP late 1994] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719201237/http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/series/STORY%20OF%20POP |date=19 July 2006 }}, and was transmitted by Australian national broadcaster [[Citadel Media|ABC]] on 1 January 2005 ([http://www.abc.net.au/rn/pop/default.htm link] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010218093054/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/pop/default.htm |date=18 February 2001 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his small knowledge about modern [[music technology]], he invited [[Jimmy Cauty]], a former member of the band [[Brilliant (band)|Brilliant]], to join him. Cauty reportedly agreed, and the JAMs' debut single "[[All You Need Is Love (The JAMs song)|All You Need Is Love]]" was independently released on 9 March 1987 as a limited-edition one-sided [[white label]] [[12-inch single|12-inch]].&lt;ref name="discog"/&gt; Cauty conceived the pseudonym "Rockman Rock", and Drummond used the nickname "King Boy D".&lt;ref&gt;King Boy D had been unmasked as Bill Drummond in weekly music paper ''NME'' as early as 28 March ("World Domination Part 458", ''[[NME]]'', 28 March 1987). The press continued to refer to the JAMs almost exclusively by their pseudonyms throughout their career. The aliases, "King Boy" and "Rockman", survived the Justified Ancients of Mu-Mu transition into the KLF, although they were briefly changed to "Time Boy" and "Lord Rock" during promotion of [[The Timelords]]' first and only single, "[[Doctorin' the Tardis]]".&lt;/ref&gt;

The reaction to "All You Need Is Love" was positive; the British music newspaper ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' listed it as the single of the week,&lt;ref name="SoundsAYN"&gt;"All You Need Is Love" review, ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', 14 March 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=20 link])--&gt; and lauded The JAMs as "the hottest, most exhilarating band this year".&lt;ref name="Sounds16May"&gt;"The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu", ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', 16 May 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; "All You Need Is Love"'s reliance on uncleared, often illegal samples made commercial release impossible.&lt;ref name="Underground"&gt;''Underground'' Magazine, April 1987 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=25 link])&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the JAMs re-edited the single, removing or doctoring the most antagonistic samples, and re-released it as "All You Need Is Love (106&amp;nbsp;bpm)" in May 1987.&lt;ref&gt;"The KLF", ''[[Musicmatch]]'' ([http://www.mmguide.musicmatch.com/artist/artist.cgi?ARTISTID=348024&amp;TMPL=LONG link])&lt;/ref&gt; According to Drummond, profits from this re-release funded the recording of their first album.&lt;ref name="begin"&gt;Drummond, B., "KLF Info Sheet", October 1987 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=500 link]). This was the first of many "Information Sheet"s that [[KLF Communications]] would send out to fans and the press.&lt;/ref&gt; The JAMs had completed and pressed copies of the album by early May 1987, but did not have a distributor.&lt;ref&gt;News item, ''Sounds'' Magazine, 9 May 1987. ''Sounds'' reviewed a pre-release copy of the album in the 16 May 1987 edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roland TR-808 drum machine.jpg|alt=|thumb|The basic track for "All You Need Is Love" was written in part on a [[Roland TR-808]] Rhythm Composer]]
Like "All You Need Is Love", the album was made using an [[Apple II]] computer, a Greengate DS3 [[Sampler (musical instrument)|digital sampler]] [[Apple II peripheral cards|peripheral card]], and a [[Roland TR-808]] drum machine.&lt;ref name="45edits"&gt;"How to recreate that authentic 1987 sound", sleeve notes to "1987: The JAMs 45 Edits", JAMS 25T, [[KLF Communications]] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20071005024212/http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=515 link]). Being a guide to recreating the record at home, this communique from The JAMs provided detailed information about the construction of the album and the samples used.&lt;/ref&gt; Using portions from existing works and pasting them into new contexts, with the duo stealing "everything" and "taking... plagiarism to its absurd conclusion," several songs were liberally plagiarised.&lt;ref name="MM1987"&gt;''1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)'' review, ''[[Melody Maker]]'', 20 June 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; This mashup of samples was underpinned by rudimentary [[beatbox]] rhythms and overlaid with Drummond's [[rapping|raps]] of social commentary, esoteric metaphors and mockery. Drummond would later say in an interview that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We'd just got ourselves a sampler, and we went sample-crazy. We just ... went through my whole collection of records, sampling tons of stuff and putting it all together, and it ... was a real rush of excitement, when we were doing it.... When we put that record out, we knew what we were doing was illegal, but we thought it was gonna be such an underground record, nobody would ever hear about it. So the first thing that shocked us is that British rock papers gave a big review.&lt;ref name="Bomlagadafshipoing"&gt;Transcript of a Bill Drummond interview on "Bomlagadafshipoing" (Norwegian national radio house-music show), September 1991 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=521 link]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''1987'' is built around samples of other artists' work, "to the point where the presence of original material becomes questionable".&lt;ref name="1987AMG"&gt;Bush, J., ''1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)'' review, [[Allmusic]] ([{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r172009|pure_url=yes}} link]). Retrieved 7 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The album is raw and unpolished, the sound contrasting sharply with the meticulous production and tight [[house music|house]] rhythms of the duo's later work as the KLF.&lt;ref name="Morton"&gt;Morton, R., "One Coronation under a Groove", ''[[NME]]'', 12 January 1991 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=191 link]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Further commentary on the production values of [[The KLF]] is available in many sources, such as the following reviews of their final album, 1991's ''[[The White Room]]'': "the artistic peak of late-'80s [[acid house|acid-house]]" (Bush, J., [[Allmusic]] ([{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r11088|pure_url=yes}} link])); "awesome vitality", "more subtle" than previous works (George, Iestyn, [[Q magazine|''Q'' magazine]], March 1991 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=206 link])); Harrison, A., ''Splendid'' Magazine ([http://www.splendidezine.com/departments/guilty/guilty90604.html link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061112155337/http://www.splendidezine.com/departments/guilty/guilty90604.html |date=12 November 2006 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; The beatbox rhythms are basic ("weedy", according to [[Q magazine|''Q'' magazine]]),&lt;ref name="Q"&gt;Cranna, I. ''1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)'' review, ''[[Q Magazine]]'', July (?) 1987 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=479 link]).&lt;/ref&gt; samples often cut abruptly, and distinctive plagiarised melodies are often played with a high-pitched rasping accompaniment. The plagiarised works are arranged so as to juxtapose with each other as a backdrop for the JAMs' rebellious messages and social comments.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''Sounds'' Magazine's "All You Need Is Love" review, 14 March 1987, which comments on the juxtaposition of samples of [[Samantha Fox]] and "[[Ring a Ring O'Roses]]" to "[highlight] explicitly the depth of contradiction embedded in society's attitude towards death through sex". Similar commentary on the situational use of samples was provided in ''Melody Maker''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s review of ''1987'', 20 June 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Lyrics include self-referential statements of the JAMs' agenda that clash with the fictional backstory adopted from ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]''.&lt;ref name="MM1987"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The duo's adoption of themes from ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]''—including their name, The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu—is covered in detail in [[The KLF]] and [[All You Need Is Love (The JAMs song)]] and is widely referenced in external sources. See, for example: [[Stewart Home|Home, S.]], "Doctorin' Our Culture", published on the website of The Stewart Home Society ([http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/klf.htm link])&lt;/ref&gt; Several songs (such as "The Queen and I" and "All You Need Is Love") have specific societal targets for Drummond's satirical raps.

===Side one===
The album's opening song, "Hey Hey We Are Not The Monkees", begins with simulated human [[sexual intercourse]] noises arranged as a rhythm. The album's first sample is "Here we come..." from [[(Theme from) The Monkees|the Monkees' theme]]. It progresses into a cryptic and bleak spoken verse from Drummond: "Here we come, crawling out of the mud, from chaos primeval to the burned out sun, dragging our bad selves from one end of time, with nothing to declare but some half-written rhymes". A cacophone of further samples from The Monkees' theme and Drummond's voice follow – "We're not The Monkees, I don't even ''like'' The Monkees!"&lt;ref name="MM1987"/&gt; – before it gets interrupted by an original [[a cappella]] vocal line that later became The KLF's "[[Justified and Ancient]]"&lt;ref&gt;"''Formerly part of Hey Hey We Are Not The Monkees''", "Justified and Ancient" entry, ''[[The White Room]]'' sleevenotes, JAMS CD6, [[KLF Communications]], 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; – "We're justified/And we're ancient ... We don't want to upset the apple cart/And we don't wanna cause any harm".&lt;ref name="Sounds87Review"&gt;''1987 (What the Fuck is Going On?)'' review, ''[[Sounds magazine|Sounds]]'', 20 June 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

The track is followed by a long sample of a [[London Underground]] train arriving at and leaving a tube station, with its recorded warning to passengers, "[[Mind the gap]]...". "Don't Take Five (Take What You Want)" follows, featuring The JAMs' associates Chike (rapper) and DJ Cesare ([[scratching|scratches]]). Built around [[Dave Brubeck|The Dave Brubeck Quartet]]'s "[[Take Five]]" and [[Fred Wesley]]'s "Same Beat",&lt;ref name="45edits"/&gt; the lyrics are mostly unconventional, with the majority of the song containing references to food: "I was pushing my trolley from detergent to cheese when I first saw the man with antler ears. I tried to ignore but his gaze held my eyes when he told me the truth about the basket of lies". ''Sounds'' considered the message of the song (if any) to be a modern version of [[Robin Hood]]: "This is piracy in action, with the venerable music industry figure, King Boy D, setting himself up as the Robin Hood of rap as he steals from the rich vaults of recording history".&lt;ref name="Sounds87Review"/&gt;

The first side of the LP closes with "Rockman Rock (Parts 2 and 3)", a homage to [[Jimmy Cauty]] that plagiarises from an array of sources, including the "[[Bo Diddley Beat]]" and "Sunrise Sunset" from the ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'' soundtrack. [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Whole Lotta Love]]", "[[Since I've Been Loving You]]" and "[[Houses of the Holy (song)|Houses of the Holy]]" can be also heard in this track. Side one would not close until "Why Did You Throw Away Your Giro?", a track consisting of a question in reference to a line from "Rockman Rock" from a female adult jokingly answered by a male person, ended in 20 seconds.&lt;ref name="45edits"/&gt;

===Side two===
The &lt;!--more outward-looking --&gt;second side begins with "Mẹ Ru Con", an emotive Vietnamese song originally titled "Ca Dao Mẹ", written by [[Trịnh Công Sơn]] performed ''a cappella'' by The JAMs' friend Duy Khiem. According to Drummond, it was a spontaneous recital by Khiem, who was in the studio contributing clarinet and tenor sax to the album.&lt;ref name="45edits"/&gt;&lt;!-- ''[[Melody Maker]]'' weren't sure what to make of the song, dismissing it as "something that could be [[Gaelic]] or the soundtrack to an Indian restaurant".&lt;ref name="MM1987"/&gt;--&gt; Khiem's vocal performance was later sampled by The KLF on the [[ambient house]] soundtrack to their movie, ''[[The Rites of Mu]]''.

"The Queen and I" features extensive samples from ABBA's "[[Dancing Queen]]", often overlain with a rasping detuned accompaniment. These lead into Drummond's satirical and discontent rapping, a fictional account of his march into the [[British House of Commons]] and [[Buckingham Palace]] to demand answers. The song also protests the involvement of cigarette companies in sport ("When cancer is the killer/[[John Player &amp; Sons|John Player]] run the [[John Player League|league]]") and lambasts the "tabloid mentality" ("They all keep talking about [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Di]]'s dress").&lt;ref name="Sounds87Review"/&gt; The [[Sex Pistols]]' "[[God Save the Queen (Sex Pistols song)|God Save the Queen]]" is briefly sampled.&lt;ref name="MM1987"/&gt; After nearly three minutes of samples from the television show ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', as well as sound clips from programmes and advertisements on other TV channels,&lt;ref&gt;The ''Top of the Pops'' edition is from 12 March 1987 and is interspersed with clips from what was being shown on other channels at the time: a golf match on BBC2, advertisements from ITV, and ''Channel 4 News''.&lt;/ref&gt; Drummond cries "Fuck that, let's have The JAMs!". The acerbic "[[All You Need Is Love (The JAMs song)|All You Need Is Love (106 bpm)]]" follows. A "stunning audio collage" featuring an AIDS [[public information film]], a rerecording of glamour model [[Samantha Fox]]'s "[[Touch Me (I Want Your Body)]]",&lt;ref name="SoundsMCPS"/&gt; and the [[nursery rhyme]] "[[Ring a Ring o' Roses]]", "All You Need Is Love" comments on sex and the British media's reaction to the AIDS crisis.&lt;ref name="SoundsAYN"/&gt;&lt;!-- ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=20 link])--&gt;

The final track on the album is "Next", which Drummond describes as "the only [[angst|angst-er]] on the album", with "imagery of war and sordid sex".&lt;ref name="45edits"/&gt; The track samples [[Stevie Wonder]]'s "[[Superstition (song)|Superstition]]", [[Scott Walker (singer)|Scott Walker]]'s "Next" from ''[[Scott 2]]'', the Fall's "Totally Wired," and [[Julie Andrews]]' "[[The Lonely Goatherd]]" from ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'',&lt;ref name="MM1987"/&gt; alongside Khiem's original melancholy [[clarinet]] and [[tenor saxophone]] contributions ("a saxophone of stupefying tediosity", according to [[Danny Kelly (journalist)|Danny Kelly]]&lt;ref name="Kelly"&gt;[[Danny Kelly (journalist)|Kelly, D.]], "JAMs on dry bread" (''1987 – What The Fuck Is Going On?'' review), ''[[NME]]'', 20 June 1987 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=35 link])&lt;/ref&gt;).

Bill Drummond summed up The JAMs' approach to composition in the first "KLF Information Sheet", sent out in October 1987: "We made [the album] not giving a shit for soul boy snob values or any other values, we just went in and made the noise we wanted to hear and the stuff that came out of our mouths.... Not a pleasant sound but it's the noise we had. We pressed it up and stuck it out. A celebration of sorts."&lt;ref name="begin"/&gt; Jimmy Cauty defended sampling as an artistic practice: "It's not as if we're taking anything away, just borrowing and making things bigger. If you're creative you aren't going to stop working just because there is a law against what you are doing."&lt;ref name="Sounds16May"/&gt;

In 1991, Drummond admitted: "We didn't listen to ''1987 What The Fuck's Going On'' for a long time, and when we did we were embarrassed by it because it was so badly recorded. But I still felt we were able to get a lot out of ourselves through it."&lt;ref name="Morton"/&gt;&lt;!-- In a December 1987 interview, Cauty maintained that they "felt that what [they]'d done was artistically justified."&lt;ref name="tune"&gt;Smith, M., "The Great TUNE Robbery", ''[[Melody Maker]]'', 12 December 1987 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=52 link])&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

==Release, reception and controversy==
''1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)'' was released in June 1987 on The JAMs' own [[record label]], "The Sound of Mu(sic)".&lt;ref&gt;It would appear that the record was distributed by [[Rough Trade Distribution]] but the available sources are not explicit. Bill Drummond told ''Underground'' magazine in March 1987 that "we approached Rough Trade but they've not said anything yet." ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=19 link]). In ''[[The Manual]]'' ({{ISBN|0-86359-616-9}}) the duo said: "Our experience was with Rough Trade. When we went to them with our first record on KLF they didn't want to know. They saw it as something that might sell five hundred copies, the bulk of those going to unsuspecting export accounts. This record then received good reviews in the rock press so they agreed to distribute it. It was not until we were about to record our second LP that they considered it worth their while to handle the manufacturing as well." This is almost certainly a reference to ''1987''. Manufacture of ''1987'' was arranged by The JAMs themselves, the record being pressed by [[MPO (manufacturer)|MPO]] in France. (Sources: ''Sounds'' Magazine, 9 May 1987; ''1987'' vinyl inner groove).&lt;/ref&gt;

''1987'' was met with mixed reviews in most of the major British music publications, including ''[[Melody Maker]]'', ''[[NME]]'', ''Sounds'', and ''[[Q Magazine|Q]]'', and the album came to the attention of the management of Swedish pop group [[ABBA]]:&lt;ref&gt;Didcock, Barry, "Bitter Swede symphony", ''[[Sunday Herald]]'' ([[Glasgow]]), 21 October 2001, p4.&lt;/ref&gt; The JAMs had sampled large portions of the ABBA single "Dancing Queen" on the track "The Queen And I". A legal showdown with ABBA and the [[Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society]] (MCPS) followed, ''1987'' was forcibly withdrawn from sale, and The JAMs were ordered to "deliver up the master tape, mothers, stampers and any other parts commensurate with manufacture of the record".&lt;ref name="SoundsMCPS"&gt;News item, ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', 12 September 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davage, I., letter from the [[Mechanical Copyright Protection Society|MCPS]] to [[The JAMs]], reproduced in "The KLF 1987 Completeist List" [sic], an insert to ''[[Who Killed The JAMs?]]'', [[KLF Communications]] JAMS LP2, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

King Boy D and Rockman Rock travelled to ABBA's home country of [[Sweden]], in the hope of meeting with ABBA personally,&lt;ref name="SoundsMCPS"/&gt; taking an ''NME'' journalist and photographer with them, along with most of the remaining copies of the LP and a gold disc of the album. Failing to find ABBA in residence at Polar Studios in Stockholm, they instead presented the gold disc to a blonde prostitute they pretended was [[Agnetha Fältskog|Agnetha]] "fallen on hard times." Of the original LP's stock, some copies were disposed overboard on the [[North Sea]] ferry trip across, and the remainder were burned in a field in [[Gothenburg]] before dawn (as shown on the cover of their next album, ''[[Who Killed The JAMs?]]''). The JAMs also played a recording of "The Queen and I" loudly outside the offices of ABBA's record label, [[Polar Music]]. The trip was unexpectedly eventful, the JAMs accidentally hitting and killing a [[moose]], and later being shot at by a farmer, a bullet cracking the engine of their [[Ford Galaxie]] police car.&lt;ref name=sweden87&gt;[[James Brown (editor)|Brown, J.]], "Thank You for the Music", ''[[NME]]'', 17 October 1987, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; They were, by their own account, towed back to England by the [[The Automobile Association|AA]].&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith, M.

The JAMs were not entirely sure what they would have said to ABBA if they had been able to meet them. Rockman told ''NME'': "We were hoping to explain [our artistic justification] to them and that maybe we'd come out of it friends, you know, them producing our album and us producing theirs—the kind of thing that often happens at these meetings." King Boy: "Yeah, we'd have said, 'Look, you haven't had many hits lately, you don't really wanna bother with all this [[Chess (musical)|West End musical]] shit do you? Come and do the new JAMMS [sic] album.'"&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; In 1994, ''[[The Guardian]]'' looked back on the Swedish sojourn as "a grand, futile, attention-grabbing gesture, the kind that would come to characterise [the duo's] collaborative career... "We were being totally stupid about it" Drummond later acknowledged."&lt;ref name="trash"&gt;Sharkey, A., "Trash Art &amp; Kreation", ''[[The Guardian|The Guardian Weekend]]'', 21 May 1994 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=384 link]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The JAMs offered what they claimed were "the last five" copies of ''1987'' for sale at £1000 each in a full-page advertisement in the April 1988 edition of ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[KLF Communications]], advertisement, ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'', April 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Drummond argued that the offer exploited a [[loophole]] in The JAMs' agreement with the MCPS: "We were browsing around this record shop and came across these five copies of ''1987''.... We made it perfectly clear to the MCPS that we couldn't actually force the shops to send our LPs back.... [B]ecause we bought them in a shop, these LPs don't come into the agreement and we can do what we like with them and not break any laws."&lt;ref&gt;King, S., "Grand Ideas: Part 91", ''[[Sounds magazine|Sounds]]'', 16 April 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=73--&gt;

[[Q (magazine)|''Q'']] magazine had mixed reactions to ''1987'', saying that there are "too few ideas being spread too thin". The magazine criticised some songs as "overlong" and questioned the overuse of sampling as "the impression of a random hotchpotch". ''Q'' also unfavourably commented that The JAMs' "use of the beatbox is altogether weedy". It liked some of its tracks: "there are some wickedly amusing ideas and moments of pure poetry in the lyrics while some of the musical juxtapositions are both killingly funny and strong enough to stand repeated listenings".&lt;ref name="Q"/&gt;

A reviewer for ''[[Melody Maker]]'' found ''1987'' "inspirational", and "the most exciting, most original record [he'd] heard in years". He also argued that: "Some snatches [of plagiarised music] rather outstay their welcome, tugging tell-tale glitz away from the clifftop and dangerously close to smug obviousness, but when the blows are kept short, sharp and very bloody, they make anything else you're very likely to hear on the radio dull and desperately humourless."&lt;ref name="MM1987"/&gt; "It's easy to dismiss The JAMs frolics as little more than a brightly coloured sideshow to the shabbiest circus in town", a later article said, but "believe me, it's far more than a gimmick".&lt;ref&gt;"Excerpts from Amply Sam(ply) Fox's 'Touch Me'", ''[[Melody Maker]]'', 4 July 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

In awarding ''1987'' the highest rating, a maximum five stars, ''[[Sounds magazine|Sounds]]''—a publication that offered the duo's work consistent approval—mused, "Taking the sound ''of'' the moment (hip hop) as a backbone, ''1987'' steals sound artefacts from anywhere ... and meshes them together with King Boy's hysterical '[[Clydeside]]' rap method with bewildering effect. ... [Y]ou could call this sampling technology's answer to [[T. S. Eliot]]'s arch cut up work, ''[[The Wasteland]]''. "&lt;ref name="Sounds87Review"/&gt; "What's so good about The JAMs", the magazine said, "is the way they are capturing on disc the whole social and musical confusion and instability of 1987 Britain".&lt;ref name="Sounds16May"/&gt;

''[[NME]]'''s [[Danny Kelly (journalist)|Danny Kelly]] was not so impressed. He also felt that the record was underdeveloped and The JAMs were not the most skilled of practitioners. "Audacity, completely unfounded self-confidence, utter ruthlessness and a fast car will, of course, be useful attributes to the go-ahead noise-pirate of the 90s, but skill, feel, instinct, vision—y'know, boring old talent—will still be bottom line compulsories... it's in these latter commodities that the JAMs seem conspicuously undertooled." Compared to the output of [[DJ Code Money]] or [[Cut Creator]] ("all humour, vibrancy and colour... – aerosoled version[s] of ''[[The Book of Kells]]''") Kelly felt Drummond's efforts to be a "glitter-crusted [[charity Christmas card]]".&lt;ref name="Kelly"/&gt; A later ''NME'' item called ''1987'' "the best comment on sampling culture ever made".&lt;ref&gt;"Tate tat and arty", ''[[NME]]'', 20 November 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=359 link])&lt;/ref&gt;

A retrospective review by [[AllMusic]] commented that ''1987'' is "a hilarious record" filled with "comments on music terrorism and [The JAMs'] own unique take on the [[Run-D.M.C.]] type of old-school rapping";&lt;ref name="1987AMG"/&gt; and ''The Penguin Price Guide for Record &amp; CD Collectors'' called ''1987'' an "entirely brilliant example of the art of disc-jockey-as-producer".&lt;ref name="Hamlyn"&gt;Hamlyn, Nick, ''The Penguin Price Guide for Record &amp; CD Collectors'' (Fourth Edition), [[Penguin Books]], 2000, {{ISBN|0-14-051466-X}}, p526.&lt;/ref&gt; Giving another retrospective review from across the Atlantic, ''[[Trouser Press]]'' described ''1987'' as "energetic" and "a loopy dance album that isn't unlike a lot of sampled records, but proceeds from an entirely different cultural understanding."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ira Robbins|Robbins, I.]], [[Trouser Press]] ([http://trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=klf link]). Retrieved 19 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personnel==
Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty were responsible for the concept and production of ''1987'', its lyrics and the TR-808 beatbox rhythms. Drummond provided rap, and an additional rapper introduced as 'Chike' appears on "Don't Take Five (Take What You Want)" and "Rockman Rock (Parts 2 and 3)". Duy Khiem contributed lead vocals to "Mẹ Ru Con", as well as clarinet and tenor sax to "Rockman Rock (Parts 2 and 3)" and "Next". Uncredited female vocalists on "Hey Hey We Are Not The Monkees", "Rockman Rock (Parts 2 &amp; 3)" and "All You Need Is Love (106 bpm)" are identified by one source as [[Cressida Cauty]] (Jimmy's wife) and [[June Montana]], the lead vocalists of the [[KLF Communications]] side project [[Disco 2000]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James Brown (editor)|Brown, J.]], "[[I Gotta CD]]" review, ''[[NME]]'', 28 November 1987 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=47 link]).&lt;/ref&gt;

=="1987: The JAMs 45 Edits"==

Following the enforced deletion of the ''1987'' album, the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu released an edited version as a 12" single, with all of the unauthorised samples removed, leaving sparse instrumentation, Drummond's social commentary and, in several cases, long periods of silence; the "Top of the Pops" section of the original LP yielded three minutes of silence on ''45 Edits'', and the only sample remaining from the original was [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]]'s "Totally Wired."

The edited single was sold through normal retail channels and also offered as a "reward" to anyone who returned a copy of the LP to The JAMs' [[post office box]].&lt;ref&gt;"Warning", ''[[Sounds magazine|Sounds]]'', 19 September 1987 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=42 link]).&lt;/ref&gt; The single was released on 16 October 1987,&lt;ref name="discog"&gt;Longmire, Ernie et al. (2005). [http://www.klf.de/discography/ KLF discography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111071100/http://www.klf.de/discography/ |date=11 January 2008 }} Compiled by Ernie Longmire, this has been the authoritative KLF discography on the internet for some 10 years or more and has been the subject of long-term scrutiny and peer review by KLF fans and collectors. It is now maintained by the fan site klf.de.&lt;/ref&gt; and on 31 October 1987 The JAMs announced that the case with ABBA "is now closed".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sounds magazine|Sounds]]'', 31 October 1987&lt;/ref&gt; The sleevenotes to "1987: The JAMs 45 Edits" explain to the purchaser in a rather tongue-in-cheek fashion how to recreate the original ''1987'' album for themselves:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This record is a version of our now deleted and illegal LP '1987, What The Fuck Is Going On?' with all of the copyright infringing 'samples' edited out. As this leaves less than 25 minutes of music we are able to sell it as a 12-inch 45. If you follow the instructions below you will, after some practice, be able to simulate the sound of our original record. To do this you will need 3 wired-up record decks, a pile of selected discs, one t.v. set and a video machine loaded with a cassette of edited highlights of last weeks 'Top of the Pops'. Deck one is to play this record on, the other two are to scratch in the missing parts using the selected records. For added authentic effect you could use a [[Roland 808]] drum machine (well cheap and what we used in the original recordings) to play along behind your scratching.&lt;ref name="45edits"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By 2000, a copy of the original version of ''1987'' in [[mint condition]] was worth £60, whereas a mint copy of "1987: The JAMs 45 Edits" was worth a mere £10.&lt;ref name="Hamlyn"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18062">The [[American Petroleum Institute]] (API) has approximately 500 technical standards for processes and components.  “Pumps - Shaft Sealing Systems for Centrifugal and Rotary Pumps” (API Standard 682) is the standard about [[end face mechanical seal|end face mechanical seals]].  &lt;ref name=API682_P&amp;S&gt;Bohm, Thomas and Fries, Markus, “The Revised API 682 Mechanical Seal Standard”, Pumps and Systems Magazine, August 29, 2013. &lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of API 682 is to assist in the selection and operation of [[end face mechanical seal|end face mechanical seals]] in [[centrifugal pump|centrifugal pumps]].  It is based on the combined knowledge and experience of [[Seal (device)|seal]] manufacturers, engineering companies and end users.  API 682 is primarily intended for use in the petroleum, natural gas and chemical industries but is often referenced for other types of equipment and industries.&lt;ref name=API682_2Tutorial&gt;Buck, G. S., Huebner, M. B, Thorp, J. M., and Fernandez, C. L. “Advances in Mechanical Sealing – An Introduction to API-682 Second Edition”, Texas A&amp;M Turbomachinery Symposium, 2003. &lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and development ==
By the late 1980’s, mechanical seals had been accepted as the preferred method for sealing rotating pumps for many years. However, mechanical seal standards were generally buried in other standards such as DIN 24960, ANSI B73 and API 610. All of these standards were primarily pump standards and any references to seals were directed at how mechanical seals would interact with pumps.&lt;ref name=API682_2Tutorial /&gt;

API 610 is the API standard about centrifugal pumps and is primarily intended for use in the petroleum, natural gas and chemical industries.  Although the 1st through 7th Editions of API 610 included specifications for mechanical seals, beginning with the 8th Edition, API 610 defers to API 682 for seal specifications.&lt;ref name=API682_2Tutorial /&gt;

In the late 1980’s a group of refinery equipment engineers and managers began to compare sealing solutions in refinery applications. This group, led by V. R. Dodd of Chevron, came up with a general plan and the American Petroleum Institute (API) agreed to establish a standard for mechanical seals: API 682.  A Task Force was formed in 1990 and the first meeting was held in January 1991.  This Task Force was composed of fourteen members from various refineries, seal and pump manufacturers.  API 682, First Edition, was published in October 1994.&lt;ref name=API682_2Tutorial /&gt;

One interesting aspect of API 682 is that it includes a strong set of defaults. That is, unless the user indicates otherwise, API 682 makes default choices for specifics such as:&lt;ref name=API682_2Tutorial /&gt;
* Seal type
* Rotating or stationary
* Seal arrangement
* Seal configuration/orientation
* Materials
* Piping plan
* … many others.

Some statements within API 682 are normative, that is, required, whereas others are informative, that is, descriptive but not required.  In particular, many of the illustrations are informative.  This distinction has not always been apparent to the reader.&lt;ref name=API682_2Tutorial /&gt;

Subsequent editions of API 682 have been published.   The current edition is 4th Edition.

== API 682 1st edition ==
The first edition of API 682 was entirely new although parts of it were extracted from the pump standard API 610 and existing API standard paragraphs.

The mission statement for the 1st Edition was:

''This standard is designed to default to the equipment types most commonly supplied that have a high probability of meeting the objective of at least three years of uninterrupted service while complying with emissions regulations.''&lt;ref name=API682_1&gt;API Standard 682, First Edition, 1994, “Shaft Sealing Systems for Centrifugal and Rotary Pumps,” American Petroleum Institute, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this mission statement no longer appears in the standard, it remains the basic principle driving the work of the API 682 Task Force and its relevance remains the same for the 4th Edition as it did for the 1st. 

In addition to providing requirements for mechanical seals, the 1st Edition of API 682 also provided a guide on how to select the correct seal for a number of common refinery applications. In order to provide this seal selection guide,  it was necessary to categorize applications into a number of services:  &lt;ref name=API682_1 /&gt;
* Non-hydrocarbon 
* water
* sour water
* caustics/amines
* acids
* Non-flashing hydrocarbon
* Flashing hydrocarbon.

It was also necessary to categorize the many different type seals that were used in these services. Three seal types were designated:  &lt;ref name=API682_1 /&gt;
* Type A – O-ring pusher
* Type B – O-ring metal bellows
* Type C – flexible gasket (high temperature) metal bellows.

Prior to API 682, 1st Edition, multiple seals were designated as being either “tandem” or “double” seals; however, advances in seal design had rendered these classic terms obsolete. As a result, there was some confusion on how multiple seals were designated.  The task force decided to use a more descriptive designation and chose to define dual seal arrangements.  A dual seal would be two sets of sealing faces used in the same seal chamber.  The fluid between these two sets of sealing faces could be either pressurized or unpressurized.  Three standard arrangements were defined:  &lt;ref name=API682_1 /&gt;
* Arrangement 1 is a single seal
* Arrangement 2 is a dual unpressurized seal
* Arrangement 3 is a dual pressurized seal.

API 682 1st Edition did not include containment seals or dry gas barrier seals.

After having defined the services, seal types, and seal arrangements, a series of flowcharts were created to help in selecting a seal type, special materials or design requirements, and supporting piping plans.

API 682 seals were to have a high probability of three years of reliable service.  In order to prove this, seal performance testing on process fluids under representative pressures and temperatures was required.  These performance tests are called “Qualification Tests”.  &lt;ref name=API682_1 /&gt;

The general idea of the qualification test was to prove that the design was sound. The goal of the qualification test was to simulate a long-term steady state run followed by a process upset.  The simulated process upset consisted of pressure changes, temperature changes and included loss of flush.  The results of these tests were made available to the purchaser for evaluation.  There was no acceptance criteria presented in API 682 1st Edition.  &lt;ref name=API682_1 /&gt;

In addition to the qualification test of the design, every API 682 seal, whether new or repaired, is to be pressure tested with air before being shipped to the end user.  &lt;ref name=API682_1 /&gt;

== API 682 2nd edition ==
One of the major criticisms of API 682 1st Edition was that all the seals were “heavy duty” and therefore expensive with no alternatives for easy services.  To some degree, this was intentional and was done in order to reduce inventory, promote familiarity with a limited number of seal types and to increase reliability.  Another criticism of API 682 1st Edition was that it considered only API 610 pumps and only refinery applications. The chemical and petrochemical industries routinely use ASME pumps in addition to API 610 pumps. Broadening the scope of pumps covered by API 682 would allow standardized seals to be applied in a greater number of industries.&lt;ref name=API682_2Tutorial /&gt;  &lt;ref name=API682_2&gt;API Standard 682, Second Edition, 2001, “Pumps – Shaft Sealing Systems for Centrifugal and Rotary Pumps,” American Petroleum Institute, Washington, D.C. &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2nd Edition, the organization of API 682 was changed to conform to ISO standards:  This reorganization means that there is no simple cross reference guide between 1st edition and 2nd edition paragraph numbers.&lt;ref name=API682_2Tutorial /&gt;

=== Categories ===
The 2nd Edition introduced the concept of seal categories. A seal category describes the type of pump into which the seal will be installed, the operating window, the design features, and the testing and documentation requirements.  There are three categories designated as Category 1, 2, or 3. &lt;ref name=API682_2 /&gt; 

Category 1 seals are intended for non-API-610 pumps.  This category is applicable for temperatures between –40°F and 500°F (-40°C and 260°C) and pressures to 315 PSI (22 bar). 

Category 2 seal are intended for API-610 This category is applicable for temperatures between –40°F and 750°F (-40°C and 400°C) and pressures to 615 PSI (42 bar). 

Category 3 seals are essentially the original seals of 1st Edition and are also intended for API-610 pumps. Category 3 seals are intended for the most demanding applications.  This category is applicable for temperatures between –40°F and 750°F (-40°C and 400°C) and pressures to 615 PSI (42 bar). Design features include a distributed flush and floating throttle bushing for single seals.  Additional documentation must be also provided.

=== New seal types ===
Three new seal types were introduced in the 2nd Edition: dry running containment seals, non-contacting seals, and dual gas barrier seals. &lt;ref name=API682_2 /&gt;

Containment seals are the outer seal of Arrangement 2. In the 2nd Edition, containment seals can be used with a liquid buffer fluid, a gas buffer fluid or without a buffer fluid.  In the case of a dry running containment seal, the containment seal will be exposed primarily to buffer gas or vaporized process fluid.  Such containment seals must therefore be designed for continuous dry running while meeting the reliability goals of the standard.  Dry running containment seals may be either contacting or non-contacting.&lt;ref name=API682_2 /&gt;

Non-contacting inner seals are also introduced for Arrangement 2. One of the primary targets for non-contacting inner seals is in flashing hydrocarbon services.  In some of these services, it is impossible to obtain adequate vapor margins to prevent flashing of the fluid in the seal chamber.  This seal will be used with a dry running containment seal and the leakage past the inner seal will be piped to a vapor recovery system.&lt;ref name=API682_2 /&gt;

The other new seal type introduced in 2nd Edition was the dry running gas seal used in Arrangement 3. This seal is designed to run on a gas barrier fluid such as nitrogen.&lt;ref name=API682_2 /&gt;

=== New piping plans ===
Several new piping plans were introduced in the 2nd Edition. These included additional options for dual pressurized liquid seals as well as new piping plans to support containment seals and dual pressurized gas seals.&lt;ref name=API682_2 /&gt;

=== New qualification procedures ===
One of the strengths of the 1st Edition was to provide qualification tests in which seal vendors would be required to prove the suitability of their seals for a given service. The 2nd Edition expanded on these requirements by adding new tests for containment seals and dual gas seals as well as defining acceptance criteria for all tests.&lt;ref name=API682_2 /&gt;

== API 682 3rd edition ==
For all practical purposes, API 682 3rd Edition is the same as 2nd Edition.  The completed 2nd Edition was submitted to the ISO Organization for approval as their ISO 21049.  At the time, API and ISO had an agreement to jointly issue standards.   The ISO Organization made slight editorial changes to 2nd Edition, including correcting typographical errors and unit conversions.  Therefore, API had to re-issue a corrected 2nd edition but choose to label it as 3rd edition.  API 682 3rd Edition was published in September 2004.&lt;ref name=API682_3&gt;API Standard 682, Third Edition, 2004, “Pumps – Shaft Sealing Systems for Centrifugal and Rotary Pumps,” American Petroleum Institute, Washington, D.C. &lt;/ref&gt;

API and ISO no longer have the agreement to jointly issue standards.  The 2004 issue of ISO 21049 is the only issue and plans to update it are unknown.&lt;ref name=API682_4Tutorial&gt;Azibert, H. V., Buck, G. S., Huebner, M. B., “Advancements in Mechanical Sealing – API 682 Fourth Edition”, Texas A&amp;M Turbomachinery Symposium, 2014. &lt;/ref&gt;

== API 682 4th edition ==
A twenty-five member task force spent six years updating 3rd Edition to 4th Edition. &lt;ref name=API682_P&amp;S /&gt; The 4th Edition of API 682 is organized similarly to the 2nd and 3rd Editions:&lt;ref name=API682_4&gt;API Standard 682, Fourth Edition, 2014, “Pumps – Shaft Sealing Systems for Centrifugal and Rotary Pumps,” American Petroleum Institute, Washington, D.C. &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Configurations ===
Seal Configuration refers to the orientation of the seal components in an assembly. In previous editions, orientations were defined as face-to-back, back-to-back, and face-to-face and these terms are carried over into the 4th Edition. In 4th Edition, any orientation (face to back, back to back, face to face) can be used in a dual seal provided that the design features are appropriate to the functionality of that particular arrangement. &lt;ref name=API682_4Tutorial /&gt;
 
=== Clearances ===
Fourth Edition added additional specifications for clearances, placed these requirements in the form of tables and noted that seal components are not to be considered as “shaft catchers” to restrict shaft movement. The minimum clearances specified apply only to equipment within the  scope of the standard. Equipment outside that scope, such as non-cartridge seals, older pumps, non-API 610 pumps and certain severe services, might benefit from larger clearances.  &lt;ref name=API682_4Tutorial /&gt;

=== Codes ===
Before API 682, API 610 (the pump standard) used a simple seal code to specify seals.  API 682 attempted to use a more comprehensive seal code; however, that code changed with every edition of API 682.   The 4th Edition code, described in Annex D, is probably the best to date and includes some concepts and codes from the historical API 610 seal code.  &lt;ref name=API682_P&amp;S /&gt; The new code uses eight fields:&lt;ref name=API682_4Tutorial /&gt;
* Seal category
* Seal arrangement
* Seal type
* Containment device
* Gasket material
* Face material
* Approximate shaft size (in millimeters)
* Piping plan
As an example, the 4th Edition code might be 31B-LIN-075-53A to indicate:
* 3 – Category 3
* 1 – Arrangement 1
* B – Type B seal
* L – Floating bushing
* I – [[FFKM]] secondary seals
* N – Carbon vs reaction bonded silicon carbide
* 075 – installed on a 75 mm shaft

=== Piping plans ===
Annex G provides illustrations and a short tutorial about each piping plan.  As has been the case for every edition, changes were made to the standard piping plans.  In particular, the piping plans now default to using transmitters with local indicators as part of the instrumentation.&lt;ref name=API682_4 /&gt;

'''''A Hidden Ulster: people, songs and traditions of Oriel''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book that is a [[reference work|referencing]] of [[Irish traditional music]] in the [[Kingdom of Oriel|Oriel]] area by Irish singer [[Pádraigín Ní Uallacháin]]. The book was published by [[Four Courts Press]] in both hardback and paperback formats. The book garnered significant acclaim.

==Background==
Pádraigín Ní Uallacháin, an Irish singer, song collector and academic comes from the area which was historically the [[Kingdom of Oriel]] in Ireland. She began writing the book in the years following her sister's death in May 1999.

=== Title ===
The book's title, ''A Hidden Ulster'' alludes to the lack of public knowledge among singers and song historians on the songs of Oriel. Many songs now sung in Ulster are claimed to be from [[County Donegal]], though many of the songs originate from Oriel. The title is also ties with Ní Uallacháin's father, Pádraig's complaint in 1939 to the Department of Education in [[Dublin]], with whom he was employed at the time. The Department released a list of 80 songs to appear in Ireland's national curriculum, none of which were from [[Ulster]], the northern quarter of the island of Ireland. In his complaint, Pádraig wrote:

{{quote|text={{lang-ga|Shílfeá e h-amharc ar an liosta suarach chéadna nár canadh nóta ceoil ariamh taobh thuas den Bhóinn!}}&lt;br&gt;''{{lang-en|One would think to look at this same miserable list that a note of music was never sung north of the Boyne!}}''|sign=Pádraig Ó hUallacháin, 1939|source=Letter to Department of Education Dublin&lt;ref name="complaint"&gt;Ní Uallacháin, Pádraigín: A Hidden Ulster, p.374-5&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Content==
''A Hidden Ulster'' contains expansive notes, lyrics and translations for 54 songs found in the Oriel area, including notation, published for the first time. The book has biographies of local singers, song collectors and songwriters from various periods, catalogues of songs collected in the area and previously-unpublished glass-stained photographs from the [[Ulster Folk and Transport Museum]]. A large section of the book is dedicated to the traditions, local customs, festivals and professions of Oriel over a number of centuries.

==Reception==
''A Hidden Ulster'' was met with widespread acclaim. Patricia Craig of the [[Times Literary Supplement]] wrote of the book, "''Pádraigín Ní Uallacháin, herself an exquisite sean-nós singer has written a timely, absorbing and scholarly account …a triumph of cultural reclamation.''"&lt;ref name="patricia"&gt;[http://www.tlsarchive.com/tlsp/quickSearch.do?quickSearchTerm=Hidden+Ulster&amp;image2.x=0&amp;image2.y=0&amp;isFuzzy=false&amp;stw.contentSet=null_config&amp;userGroupName=tlspuser&amp;searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&amp;prodId=TLSP&amp;tabID=T012&amp;searchId=R1&amp;boolCnt=0&amp;docId=&amp;sort=DateAscend&amp;resultListType=&amp;retrieveFormat=&amp;relevancePageBatch=&amp;contentSet=&amp;callistoContentSet=&amp;isIllustration=&amp;docLevel=&amp;scale=&amp;orientation=&amp;docPage=&amp;hilite=y&amp;inputFieldName%280%29=BA&amp;inputFieldValue%280%29=&amp;inresults=&amp;inPS=true A Hidden Ulster] at TLSarchive.com&lt;/ref&gt; Poet and academic Prof. [[Michael Longley]] said, "''A momentous publication … a treasure trove of words, a cultural and social history … a work of phenomenal concentration, great tenderness and bighearted loyalty. Proud and heartbroaken, it is an heroic attempt to remember.''"

The book was a ''Times'' Book of the Year, critic Paul Muldoon commenting, "''Anyone with interest in Irish song must mow look to A Hidden Ulster for the definitive account of that tradition.''" &lt;ref name="paulmuldoon"&gt;[http://www.tlsarchive.com/tlsp/quickSearch.do?quickSearchTerm=Hidden+Ulster&amp;image2.x=0&amp;image2.y=0&amp;isFuzzy=false&amp;stw.contentSet=null_config&amp;userGroupName=tlspuser&amp;searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&amp;prodId=TLSP&amp;tabID=T012&amp;searchId=R1&amp;boolCnt=0&amp;docId=&amp;sort=DateAscend&amp;resultListType=&amp;retrieveFormat=&amp;relevancePageBatch=&amp;contentSet=&amp;callistoContentSet=&amp;isIllustration=&amp;docLevel=&amp;scale=&amp;orientation=&amp;docPage=&amp;hilite=y&amp;inputFieldName%280%29=BA&amp;inputFieldValue%280%29=&amp;inresults=&amp;inPS=true A Hidden Ulster - Paul Muldoon]&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Hidden Ulster'' was also received favourable by The Journal of Music,&lt;ref name="jmi"&gt;[http://journalofmusic.com/article/221 Journal of Music]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Irish Times]]'' and ''May Field Review''.

Pádraigín received ''Gradam Shean-Nós Cois Life'' for her contribution to the Irish song tradition and became the first traditional artist to be awarded a Major Arts Award from the [[Arts Council of Northern Ireland]].

The '''''Atlanta Daily World''''' is the oldest [[African American newspaper|black newspaper]] in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], founded in 1928. Currently owned by [[Real Times Inc.]], it publishes daily online.

It was "one of the earliest and most influential black newspapers."&lt;ref name="NYT-Review"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/23/arts/design/national-center-for-civil-and-human-rights-opens-in-atlanta.html?_r=0|title=The Harmony of Liberty|author=Edward Rothstein|work=nytimes.com|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=22 June 2014|accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Establishment===
It was founded as the weekly ''Atlanta World'' on August 5, 1928, by William Alexander Scott II who was only 26 at the time.&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/blackpress/news_bios/newbios/nwsppr/atlnta/atlnta.html Newspapers: Atlanta Daily World, "The Black Press: Soldiers without Swords", PBS]&lt;/ref&gt; Scott was a [[Morehouse College|Morehouse]] graduate who later worked as the only black clerk on the [[Jacksonville]] to [[Washington, D.C.]], rail line, then in 1927 published a Jacksonville business directory to help blacks find each other. A year later he published a similar directory for Atlanta.&lt;ref name=fbr&gt;[http://www.familybusinessradio.com/?p=2223 "Recap: Alexis Scott Shares Atlanta Daily World History on Family Business Radio", Family Business Radio, January 12, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307173024/http://www.familybusinessradio.com/?p=2223 |date=March 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, there was very little coverage of black educational institutions, businesses, prominent persons, churches, or other news of significance; the exceptions being crime news and death listings. This was despite the fact that Atlanta contained at the time the most prominent black educational institutions and persons of influence in the country. Whites lived to a large extent sealed off from black Atlanta and only interacted with blacks in service positions, virtually unaware of the black institutions and achievements taking place only a mile or two from their homes.

The paper became a semi-weekly in May 1930, and a triweekly in April 1931. In 1931, Scott also began publishing the ''[[Chattanooga Tribune]]'' and ''[[Memphis World]]'', and by doing so, founded the first chain of black newspapers, a chain that would eventually grow, at its peak, to fifty publications.&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt;

===Daily publication===
In 1932 Scott's ''Atlanta World'' became a daily and added "Daily"  to its title, becoming the first black daily in the U.S. in the 20th century&lt;ref name=fbr/&gt; and the first successful one in all U.S. history.&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; At the time of its founding, the only other black paper in the area was the ''[[Atlanta Independent]]'', which ceased publication in 1933. This left the ''Daily World'' as the only black paper in town. Its offices were on [[Sweet Auburn|Auburn Avenue ("Sweet Auburn")]] celebrated as the home of the black business, social, and religious community and famously called by [[John Wesley Dobbs]] the "richest Negro street in the world".

On February 4, 1934, Scott was shot and killed; no one was ever convicted of the crime. His brother, Cornelius Adolphus (C.A.) Scott, took over as head of the paper, which subsequently adopted a more conservative, [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] position, reflecting Cornelius' own political views&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; and his resentment over the [[United States Democratic Party|Democrats]]' historical support of segregation and bias against African-Americans.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/11/us/c-a-scott-92-voice-of-blacks-as-publisher-of-atlanta-world.html|title=Obituary: C. A. Scott, 92, Voice of Blacks As Publisher of Atlanta World|first=Eric|last=Pace|date=May 11, 2000|accessdate=May 3, 2012|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil Rights Movement===
During the [[Civil Rights Movement]], the ''Daily World'' was criticized for not supporting sit-ins staged at several white-owned restaurants in downtown Atlanta.&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; Advertisers threatened to pull their business if the demonstrations didn’t stop.&lt;ref name=fbr/&gt; C.A. Scott thought the demonstrations were dangerous, would work against the participants when they later would be looking for jobs,&lt;ref name=fbr/&gt;  and reasoned that blacks would more effectively improve their situation by working towards ending segregation in education, obtaining political and voting influence, and improving their economic situations.&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt;

Editorial content during this period was mainly neutral in tone, as opposed to actively promoting Negro rights or attacking racism, and as such white businesses did not feel threatened by its content, allowing the ''Daily World'' to secure advertising support from companies such as [[Coca-Cola]], [[Sears, Roebuck]]  and [[Rich's (department store)|Rich's]], the largest department store in the city.&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt;

The paper did urge blacks to shop at black-owned businesses (the "Don't Buy Where You Can't Work" campaign). In the 1940s it sponsored voter registration efforts. The paper also covered the Atlanta black community's social, church, and sports news.&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt;

''The Daily World'' covered, on a national basis, topics including:
* [[Lynching]]s
* [[Police brutality]]
* [[Capital punishment]]
* the [[Scottsboro Boys#Decatur trials|trials of the Scottsboro Boys]], nine black Alabama teenagers accused of rape
* Racial discrimination in the federal government
* the white primary system in Georgia (abolished 1946)
* [[School segregation]]
* [[Racial discrimination against African-Americans in the U.S. Military]] during World War II.

===21st century===
Cornelius Scott retired in 1997 and his great niece, Alexis Scott Reeves, took over as publisher.&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; Reeves has previously been a journalist at the ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'', Atlanta's leading daily, and later vice-president of community affairs there.&lt;ref name=fbr/&gt;

During the 1980s and 1990s, the newspaper's circulation declined from its peak over 20,000 in the 1960s to a steady 10,000. By 2000, although it retained the word "Daily" in its name, it had cut back its publication schedule to only two editions per week, on Sundays and Thursdays.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

In 2012, the ''Atlanta Daily World'' joined [[Real Times Inc.]], a publisher of five other African-American weeklies, including the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'' and ''[[New Pittsburgh Courier]]''. Alexis Scott said the sale would give the ''World'' more multimedia resources, calling it "truly a new beginning for the paper."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Atlanta Daily World Newspaper Joins Real Times Media| work =New Pittsburgh Courier| date = March 14, 2012 | accessdate = May 3, 2012| url =http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2630112741.html| publisher = via [[HighBeam Research]] }} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic offices==
In 2008 the [[2008 Atlanta tornado outbreak|Downtown Atlanta tornado]] damaged the ''World'''s offices at 145 Auburn Avenue. The paper's operations subsequently moved to another location.&lt;ref name=cl&gt;[http://clatl.com/freshloaf/archives/2012/02/29/atlanta-daily-world-building-is-latest-auburn-avenue-historical-site-at-risk Scott Henry, "Atlanta Daily World building is latest Auburn Avenue historical site at risk", ''Creative Loafing'']&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Scott announced plans to sell the building where this important part of Atlanta's black history took place; the buyer had plans to demolish the building. This caused outcry in the local [[Old Fourth Ward]] neighborhood at the loss of yet another historic building on Auburn Avenue.&lt;ref name=cl/&gt; The [[Historic District Development Corporation]], whose mission is historic preservation in the [[Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site|Martin Luther King, Jr. Historic District]] launched an online petition to save the building. Owner and publisher Alexis Scott responded in a joint statement with developer Integral Group claiming that demolition of the building but saving the façade was the only feasible option to preserve any portion of the historic structure and thus preserve the history in some physical form.&lt;ref&gt;http://saportareport.com/blog/2012/03/integral-group-and-alexis-scott-explain-desire-to-demolish-atlanta-daily-world-building/&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 8, 2014 the offices were sold to commercial real estate developer and [[Sidewalk Radio]] host Gene Kansas who stated that he planned to restore the building for retail and residential use, and that it would be designed by Gamble and Gamble architects, the same firm redesigning the [[Clermont Lounge|Clermont Motor Inn]] on [[Ponce de Leon Avenue]] in [[Poncey-Highland]] into a boutique hotel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajc.com/news/business/atlanta-daily-world-building-sold-retail-housing-p/ncgcp/ Christopher Seward, "Atlanta Daily World building sold; retail, housing planned", '"Atlanta Journal-Constitution'', January 8, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ex commisso nobis''''', more commonly known as the '''''Bull of Gniezno''''', was a [[papal bull]] issued on July 7, 1136 by [[Pope Innocent II]].  The bull split off the Bishopric of [[Gniezno]] from the [[Archbishop of Magdeburg]]. From a historical perspective, the bull is especially important as it contains the earliest written record of the [[Polish language]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies, 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Slavic language scholar [[Aleksander Brückner]] called the document a "''złota bulla języka polskiego''" (the [[golden bull]] of the Polish language).

== Historical context ==
The election of [[Pope Innocent II]] in 1130 prompted a [[Papal schism of 1130|schism]] in the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. The Polish church supported the appointment of the [[Antipope]] [[Antipope Anacletus II|Anacletus II]], while Saint [[Norbert of Xanten]], [[Archbishop of Magdeburg]], remained faithful to Innocent. In Norbert's last years, he was [[chancellor]] and adviser to [[Lothair II]], the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], and persuaded him to lead an army to Rome to restore Innocent to the papacy in 1133.

Following Norbert's death, Lothair pressured Innocent to issue an order rejecting the independence and authority of the [[Archbishop of Gniezno]], and affirming the Archbishop of Magdeburg's authority over the [[Archdiocese of Gniezno]] and, by default, the entirety of the Polish church. As a result, the Polish [[prelate]]s swore fealty to the Antipope.

In August 1135, in exchange for the independence of the Polish episcopate, [[Bolesław III Wrymouth]], [[Duke of Poland]], declared himself a vassal of Emperor Lothair and agreed to pay tribute to the Holy Roman Empire. On July 7, 1136, Pope Innocent upheld the independence of the Polish church from the Archdiocese of Magdeburg in a [[papal bull]] entitled ''Ex commisso nobis.''

==In the Twentieth Century==
During [[World War II]], the archdiocesan archives in Gniezno were plundered by the [[Nazi]]s, and the bull, along with numerous other artefacts, were moved West towards Germany. The Nazis were intercepted by the [[Soviet army]], however, and the bull was taken to [[Moscow]]. The document remained in the Russian capital for fifty years before being returned to Gniezno.

Upon the document's return, the [[National Library of Poland]] performed a series of tests on the bull under the authority of Professor [[Andrzej Wyczański]]. The scientists discovered that when viewed under [[ultraviolet light]], the document showed traces of different washed-out text. Due to the lack of adequate testing facilities, the Library abandoned further research efforts, which have not been resumed since.

The '''''Bust of Louis XIV''''' is a marble portrait by the Italian artist [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]]. It was created in the year 1665 during Bernini's visit to [[Paris]]. This sculptural portrait of [[Louis XIV of France]] has been called the "grandest piece of portraiture of the baroque age".&lt;ref name="Rudolf Wittkower, in text"&gt;Rudolf Wittkower, in text&lt;/ref&gt; The bust is on display at the [[Versailles Palace]], in the Salon de Diane in the [[Grand appartement du roi|King's Grand Apartment]].

==Commissioning==

Bernini had been invited to [[Paris]] as part of a larger diplomatic exchange between the [[Pope|Papacy]] and France. The ostensible reason for the visit was to create new designs for the [[Louvre Palace]], but the young king [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] had declared he also desired a portrait bust.&lt;ref name = "baldinucci"&gt;Filippo Baldinucci, p.45&lt;/ref&gt; Bernini’s designs for the Louvre did not go down well and were not acted upon; indeed their failure to be accepted was a reflection of the general antagonism between the Italian Bernini and certain members within the French court. However, the portrait bust, which depended upon a more personal relationship between the king and the artist, was completed and largely considered a great success.&lt;ref name="Rudolf Wittkower, in text"/&gt;

==Creation==

The creation of the bust is incredibly well documented, thanks to efforts of the French diarist [[Paul Fréart de Chantelou]],  a steward at the court of Louis XIV, who befriended Bernini during his time in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Fre’art de Chantelou, Diary of the Cavaliere Bernini’s Visit to France, 1985, ed., Anthony Blunt, ‘’passim’’&lt;/ref&gt;

The bust took just over three months to carve. Once potential blocks of marble had been selected, Bernini began by taking drawings (none of which survive&lt;ref&gt;Robert T. Petersson, Bernini and the Excesses of Art, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;) and small clay models of the king.,&lt;ref&gt;No existing bozzetti are listed in Irving Lavin, [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_bozzetti_of_Gianlorenzo_Bernini.html?id=FK5-YgEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|The Bozzetti of Gianlorenzo Bernini], Ph.D. thesis, 1955&lt;/ref&gt; However, it seems that once he had done this initial work, Bernini chose to work only during sittings with the king.  His pupil, Giulio Cartari, began work on carving down the chosen block of marble (and would later do much of the drapery work&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Gould, Bernini in France, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;), and then Bernini took over, taking forty days to complete the work. He had hoped to have twenty sittings with the king during the final carving process, but in fact there were thirteen of around one hour each.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Hibbard, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ap9EVkZTsNMC&amp;pg=PP5&amp;dq=hibbard+bernini&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qLBeTvL3EYaWOrPisOAC&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=louis&amp;f=false ''Bernini''] Other historians have provided differed on this number, but Wittkower confirms 20 to be an overstatement, Wittkower, Bernini’s Bust of Louis XIV, 1951, p6, n1&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernini's son and biographer, [[Domenico Bernini]], noted the artistic arguments of his father as to why the King agreed to sit for such a length of time, explaining that the artist preferred to work from Truth (i.e. real life) rather than rely on the unnecessary imaginative extras that would creep into working from sketches. Equally, Bernini wanted to see the king, as he did many of this other sitters, not remaining immobile, but sitting and talking in such as way that Bernini could capture all his  characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Bernini, 134&lt;/ref&gt; Such an approach, with Bernini wishing to capture the figure in physical and psychological motion, was a common element of Bernini’s work: “mere resemblance is inadequate. One must express what goes on in the heads of heroes,” Bernini is recorded as saying. Bernini also observed the king in other locations - playing tennis, resting after lunch, or simply walking around court.&lt;ref&gt;Robert T, Petersson, Bernini and the Excesses of Art, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Filippo Baldinucci]] (biographer of artists/art historian) records numerous events that advertise Bernini’s supposed influence on French culture, including one incident where Bernini’s rearranged the King’s hair to give greater exposure to the King’s brow - the new stye was apparently followed by all at the French court, and became known as the Bernini modification.&lt;ref&gt;Fillippo Baldininucci, 53&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary art historians are sceptical of this however; Jeanne Zarucchi claims that the alteration was deliberate, altering the shape of the King's head in an unflattering manner.&lt;ref&gt;Zarucchi, p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conception==
[[File:Château de Versailles, salon de Diane, buste de Louis XIV, Bernin (1665) 00.jpg|thumb|The bust, as displayed in the Salon de Diane]]

Sculpted late in his career, the bust’s grand nature, with its dramatic drapery and regal nature can be seen as a continuation of the bust Bernini executed for Francesco I D’Este.

Despite not being an actual military commander, Bernini conceived of Louis in armour, drawing on notions of heroic kings such as Alexander the Great.&lt;ref&gt;Wittkower, 1998 15, points out that there is resemblance between the bust and Alexander as portrayed in surviving coins.&lt;/ref&gt; Though a small man, Louis is figured as a stately character, fusing grandeur with a rich elegance of spirit. The drapery suggests the movement of wind, but also demonstrates the ability of the king to overcome such earthly distractions - he stares in to the distance, perhaps as if giving a military commands, turning his face against the direction the wind is blowing. Bernini may also have explored concept of Louis as the Sun King in the portrait, relating the king’s hair to sunbeams and the drapery as passing clouds.&lt;ref&gt;Irving Lavin, Visible Spirit - The Art of Gianlorenzo Bernini, Volume 1, 2007, pps 560-574&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet the idealisation of the king as a great emperor was also grounded in reality. It was a feature of Bernini’s sculpture that he could combine abstract notions such as grandeur and nobility with precise individual characteristics of the sitter. Bernini paid careful attention to and played with the hair, eyes, nose forehead, and the clothing of Louis making subtle adjustments that allowed Bernini to give the appearance of the individual sitter, being without it being a slavish copy or a lifeless abstraction.&lt;ref name = "wittkower1"&gt;Wittkower, Rudolf. "Bernini's Bust of Louis XIV." Oxford University Press. 1951.
&lt;/ref&gt;

To strengthen the military grandeur of the bust, Bernini designed a large globe to act as a pedestal for the bust, thus giving the appearance that the entire world was a platform for Louis’s majesty. Bernini also intended such a pedestal to raise the overall height of the artwork, so that the artwork would sit above and be out of touch of the spectator. However, this was never completed and the bust was moved from its position in the Louvre palace to the Palace of Versailles in 1680s, where it still remains now.&lt;ref name = "wittkower1" /&gt;

==Immediate Reception==

Despite the carping of French critics at the court of Louis XIV, the bust was immediately considered a success, as the number of reproductions testifies. A mould of the bust was made in 1666; by 1669 at least seven plaster casts had been created. An early bronze version was taken to Quebec, Canada but is now lost. The only other early copy in bronze is in the National Gallery of Art in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Bernini and the Birth of Baroque Portrait Sculpture, ex.cat., 2008, ed. Andea Bacchi, Catherine Hess and Jennifer Montagu, p.267&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Daidarabotchi'''|ダイダラボッチ||}} was a gigantic [[yōkai]] in [[Japanese mythology]], sometimes said to pose as a mountain range when sleeping.

==Mythology==
The size of a Daidarabotchi was so great that his footprints were said to have created innumerable lakes and ponds. In one legend, a Daidarabotchi weighed [[Mount Fuji]] and [[Mount Tsukuba]] to see which was heavier. But he accidentally split Tsukuba's peak after he was finished with it.

The ''Hitachi no Kuni [[Fudoki]]'', a recording of the imperial customs in the [[Hitachi Province]] compiled in the 8th century, also told of a Daidarabotchi living on a hill west of a post office of Hiratsu Ogushi who fed on giant clams from the beach, piling the shells on top of a hill.

''Izumo no Kuni Fudoki'' also mentions a legendary king of Izumo, Ōmitsunu, who was the grandson of [[Susanoo]] and a demi-god. Having the strength of a giant, he performed Kuni-biki, pulling land from [[Silla]] with ropes, to increase the size of his territory.

==In popular culture==
{{Pop culture|date=June 2018}}
* The Great Forest Spirit in the film ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' appears as the Daidarabotchi after sunset.
* Daidarabotchi appears in ''[[Yo-kai Watch]]'' with the English dub name of Dromp. It is the largest Yo-kai in which anyone it inspirits becomes lost in its mazes. In addition, it also appears to have a size-shifting ability where it can appear at either gigantic size to towering over a human.

[[File:Disloyal man with his girlfriend looking at another girl.jpg|thumb|right|The stock photograph which inspired the meme]]
The '''distracted boyfriend meme''' is a [[Internet meme|meme]] based on a 2015 [[Stock photography|stock photograph]] by the Spanish photographer Antonio Guillem. Social media users started using the image as a meme at the start of 2017, and it went viral in August 2017 as a way to depict different forms of infidelity. The meme has inspired various spin-offs and received critical acclaim.

==Stock photograph==
The stock image was taken in the city of [[Girona]] in [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]], in mid-2015 by the photographer Antonio Guillem from [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref name="Belam 2017"&gt;{{cite news |last=Belam |first=Martin |title=I didn't know what a meme was, says Distracted Boyfriend photographer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/aug/30/the-team-that-made-the-distracted-boyfriend-meme-have-split-up |accessdate=July 21, 2018 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guillem told ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' he and the stock image models planned on having a session which would represent the concept of infidelity "in a playful and fun way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Barrett |first1=Brian |title=The 'Distracted Boyfriend' Meme's Photographer Explains All |url=https://www.wired.com/story/distracted-boyfriend-meme-photographer-interview/ |website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=August 28, 2017 |accessdate=July 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boyfriend and girlfriend in the photograph are known by their stage names "Mario" and "Laura". "Laura" later described the experience shooting the stock images, saying, "When people saw us simulate those scenes in the street, they stopped to look and laugh and, in my case that I had to have a more serious face, I had a hard time to keeping it".&lt;ref name="Insider interview"/&gt;

The image was uploaded to [[Shutterstock]] with the caption: "Disloyal man walking with his girlfriend and looking amazed at another seductive girl."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Molina |first=Brett |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2017/08/25/disloyal-man-meme-explained/600822001/ |title=The 'disloyal man' meme, explained |work=[[USA Today]] |date=August 25, 2017 |accessdate=July 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the copyright status of this image, Guillem has stated that his images "are subject to copyright laws and the license agreements of the microstock agencies. It's not allowed to use any image without purchasing the proper license in any possible way, so each one of the people that use the images without the license are doing it illegally. This is not the thing that really worries us, as they are just a group of people doing it in good faith, and we are not going to take any action, except for the extreme cases in which this good faith doesn't exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Zhang |first=Michael |url=https://petapixel.com/2017/09/18/story-behind-viral-distracted-boyfriend-meme-photo/ |title=The Story Behind That Viral 'Distracted Boyfriend' Meme Photo |date=September 18, 2017 |work=PetaPixel |accessdate=July 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meme==

The first known use of the stock image as an internet meme was posted to a Turkish [[progressive rock]] [[Facebook group]] in January 2017. The post labeled the man as [[Phil Collins]], who is being distracted by pop music away from progressive rock. This meme was reposted on an English-language progressive rock [[Facebook]] page the next day, and then on [[Twitter]] on February 2, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Britton |first=David |url=https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/distracted-boyfriend-memes/ |title=The best Distracted Boyfriend memes |date=July 14, 2018 |accessdate=July 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, the original stock photograph was shared on [[Instagram]] and got almost 30,000 likes.&lt;ref name="HuffPost"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wanshel |first=Elyse |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/distracted-boyfriend-disloyal-man-wandering-eyes-meme_us_59a05626e4b05710aa5bf381 |title=The Story Behind The Stock Photo That Launched A Thousand Jokes |date=August 25, 2017 |work=[[HuffPost]] |accessdate=July 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meme started going viral on August 19, 2017, after a Twitter user posted the photograph with the man labeled "the youth" being distracted from his girlfriend "[[capitalism]]" by "[[socialism]]". Another Twitter user copied this meme, getting retweeted more than 35,000 retweets and nearly 100,000 favorites.&lt;ref name="Vox Romano"&gt;{{cite web |last=Romano |first=Aja |url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/8/25/16200526/distracted-boyfriend-other-woman-stock-photo-meme |title=Why that "distracted boyfriend" stock photo meme is suddenly everywhere |work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |date=August 25, 2017 |accessdate=July 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meme and its permutations went viral on Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook.&lt;ref name="Vox Romano"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hathaway |first=Jay |url=https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/distracted-boyfriend-meme/ |title=The distracted boyfriend is everyone's favorite new meme |date=August 24, 2017 |work=[[The Daily Dot]] |accessdate=July 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Adam Downer, an editor for ''[[Know Your Meme]]'', the distracted boyfriend meme helped popularize a meme format called object labeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schwedel |first=Heather |url= https://slate.com/technology/2018/03/memes-are-object-labeled-now.html |title=Thanks to the Distracted Boyfriend, We're Living in a Golden Age of 'Object Labeling' Memes |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=March 22, 2018 |accessdate=July 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The girlfriend in the meme generally came to represent something that one is supposed to do, and the woman wearing red came to represent something more desirable or riskier.&lt;ref name="Tansill-Suddath 2018"&gt;{{cite news |last=Tansill-Suddath |first=Callie  |url=https://www.bustle.com/p/the-distracted-boyfriend-meme-has-18th-century-version-that-people-are-going-wild-for-on-twitter-8816055 |title=The 'Distracted Boyfriend' Meme Has An 18th Century Version That People Are Going Wild For On Twitter |work=[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]] |date=April 17, 2018 |accessdate=July 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The models discovered the meme on social media and they told me about it. None of us could imagine the media repercussion that it has reached right now."&lt;ref name="Belam 2017"/&gt;

Early variations of the distracted meme used other photos from Guillem's photo shoot of the three stock characters to create a story.&lt;ref name="HuffPost"/&gt; In late January 2018, some social media users noted similarities between the meme and promotional image from ''[[Mission: Impossible – Fallout]]'' featuring [[Henry Cavill]] and [[Angela Bassett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bastidas |first=Jose |date=January 27, 2018 |url=http://popculture.com/trending/2018/01/28/mission-impossible-6-fallout-teaser-tom-cruise-henry-cavill-distracted-boyfriend-meme/ |title='Mission: Impossible 6' Teaser Resembles 'Distracted Boyfriend' Meme |website=PopCulture.com |publisher=[[Entertainment Tonight]] |accessdate=July 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 16, 2018, a Twitter user called the [[Joshua Reynolds]] painting ''[[David Garrick Between Tragedy and Comedy]]'' the "18th century equivalent" of the distracted boyfriend meme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kelly |first=Tiffany |url=https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/18th-century-distracted-boyfriend-meme/ |title=This 18th-century painting looks like the Distracted Boyfriend meme |work=The Daily Dot |date=April 17, 2018 |accessdate=July 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the painting became popular as a similar meme with historic references.&lt;ref name="Tansill-Suddath 2018"/&gt;

In early May 2018, a Twitter user posted the coin commemorating the [[wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle]] with one of the characters from the meme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Reitz |first=Collette |url=https://www.elitedaily.com/p/this-meme-with-meghan-markle-prince-harrys-coin-will-be-your-new-favorite-8979700 |title=Meghan Markle &amp; Prince Harry's Coin Just Got Turned Into The Funniest Meme |work=[[Elite Daily]] |date=May 4, 2018 |accessdate=July 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early June 2018, film writer Peter Goldberg posted on his Twitter account a scene from [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s 1922 short film ''[[Pay Day (1922 film)|Pay Day]]'' with a format similar to the distracted boyfriend meme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Novak |first=Matt |url=https://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/did-charlie-chaplin-invent-the-distracted-boyfriend-mem-1826726244 |title=Did Charlie Chaplin Invent the Distracted Boyfriend Meme? |work=[[Gizmodo|Paleofuture]] |publisher=[[Gizmodo Media Group]] |date=June 11, 2018 |accessdate=July 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In early July 2018, a photograph of a woman eating ice cream with a man and a woman holding hands in Venice went viral because of its similarities to the distracted boyfriend meme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Drascott |first=Edd |url=https://www.independent.ie/world-news/and-finally/this-photobomber-recreated-the-distracted-boyfriend-meme-by-fluke-37093705.html |title=This photobomber recreated the Distracted Boyfriend meme by fluke |work=[[Irish Independent]] |publisher=Press Association |date=July 8, 2018 |accessdate=July 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A version of the meme featuring a distracted groom went viral on Twitter in early October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bruner |first=Raisa |url=http://time.com/5412058/distracted-groom-meme/ |title=Distracted Groom Meme Is a Step Up From Distracted Boyfriend |work=Time |date=October 1, 2018 |accessdate=October 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wiktionary|embarazada}}
'''''Embarazada''''' ({{IPA-es|embaɾaˈθaða}}) is the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for [[pregnancy|pregnant]]. It is a [[false friend]] for native [[English language|English]]-speaking [[Spanish as a second language|students of Spanish]] who may attempt to say "I'm [[Embarrassment|embarrassed]]" by saying "''estoy embarazada''". This phrase actually means "I'm pregnant" in Spanish. This may be confusing to Spanish speakers who are not familiar with the English word.

==Spanish usage==
The correct way to say "I'm embarrassed" in Spanish is using the phrase ''tengo [[wikt:vergüenza|vergüenza]]'' (meaning "I have shame") or the more formal phrases ''me da vergüenza'' or ''estoy [[wikt:avergonzado|avergonzado]]/a''.&lt;ref&gt;"embarazada", Collins Spanish Dictionary (2003) p. 1311.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, in Spanish, there also exists the adjective ''[[wikt:|embarazoso]],'' meaning the same as "embarrassing" in its denotation of something that causes a sensation of unease, but not of shame.&lt;ref&gt;"embarazoso", Collins Spanish Dictionary (2003), p. 380.&lt;/ref&gt; Complicating the issue further, ''embarazada'' can sometimes also mean "hampered", or "hindered".&lt;ref&gt;"embarazar", Collins Spanish Dictionary (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; This more closely mirrors the original meaning of the English word ''embarrass''.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;"embarrass", The Oxford English Dictionary, (1989) &lt;http://dictionary.oed.com&gt; [Retrieved on 2006-02-15].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grammar===
''Embarazada'' is a [[past participle]], meaning that it indicates a state resulting from a previous action. In English, past participles usually end in ''-ed'' (e.g., ''destroy'''ed'''''), and ''embarazado'' therefore translates directly into English as "impregnated". It is a conjugated form of ''embarazar'' "to impregnate". As the word ''embarazado'' is masculine, it is rarely encountered in Spanish. It is more common for the word ''embarazad'''a''''' to be used to describe pregnancy. However, ''embarazado'' can be used as a past participle in perfect tenses, as in: "El hombre ha embarazado a la mujer." (The man has impregnated the woman.)

==Etymology==
The English word ''embarrassed'' is indirectly derived from the Spanish word. The first recorded usage of ''embarrass'' in English was in 1664 by [[Samuel Pepys]] in his diary. The word was derived from the French word ''embarrasser'', "to block" or "to obstruct", or figuratively, "to put one in a difficult situation".&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; The first recorded usage was by [[Michel de Montaigne]] in 1580. The French word was derived from the Spanish ''embarazar'', whose first recorded usage was in 1460 in ''Cancionero de Stúñiga'' (Songbook of Stúñiga) by [[Álvaro de Luna]].&lt;ref name="Corominas"&gt;Joan Corominas and José Pacual, "embarazar", Diccionario crítico etimológico castellano e hispánico, (Gredos, 1980) Vol. II, p. 555-556.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish word likely comes from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''embaraçar'' (used in the same context of English ''embarrassment''), which probably is a combination of the [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] ''em-'' (from Latin ''in-'' for "in-") with ''baraça'' "a noose", or "rope", which makes sense with the synonym ''encinta'' ("on noose, on rope" because of the old usage of women to wear a strap of cloth on their dresses when pregnant).&lt;ref&gt;"embarrass", Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged, (2002) &lt;http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com&gt; [Retrieved on 2006-02-15].&lt;/ref&gt; ''Baraça'' originated before the Romans began their conquest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in 218 BCE.&lt;ref name="Corominas"/&gt; Thus, ''baraça'' could be related to the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] word ''barr'', "tuft". (Celtic people actually settled much of Spain and Portugal beginning in the 700s BCE, the second group of Indo-European language speakers to do so.)&lt;ref&gt;"Iberian", Encyclopædia Britannica, &lt;http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9041884&gt; [Retrieved on 2006-02-15].&lt;/ref&gt; However, it certainly is not directly derived from it, as the substitution of ''r'' for ''rr'' in [[Iberian Romance languages]] was not a known occurrence.

Some say the Spanish word actually came from the Italian ''imbarazzare'', from ''imbarazzo'', "obstacle" or "obstruction". That word came from ''imbarrare'', "to block" or "to bar", which is a combination of ''in-'', "in", with ''barra'', "bar" (from the [[Vulgar Latin]] ''barra'', which is of unknown origin).&lt;ref name="Corominas"/&gt; The problem with this theory is that the first known usage of the word in Italian was by [[Bernardo Davanzati]] (1529-1606), long after the word had entered Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;"embarrass", The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, (2000) &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/12/E0101200.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211111021/http://www.bartleby.com/61/12/E0101200.html |archivedate=2006-02-11 |df= }}&gt; [Retrieved on 2006-02-15].&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, modern scholars believe that the Italian word actually came from the Spanish one.&lt;ref&gt;"imbarazzare", Grande Dizionario Italiano, (2007) &lt;http://www.garzantilinguistica.it/interna_ita.html&gt; [Retrieved on 2006-10-29].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial implications==
When [[The Parker Pen Company|Parker Pen]] entered the [[Mexico|Mexican]] market, its [[advertisement]]s which claimed that Parker Pens "won't leak in your pocket and embarrass you" was [[translation|mistranslated]] to "''No te embarazará chorreándose en tu bolsillo''", which means "Won't leak in your pocket and impregnate you".&lt;ref&gt;Sandy Serva, iLanguage Translations for Global Research, January 2003, Vol. 26, Issue 1, p 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*The comic ''Married To The Sea'' refers to the mistranslation in the February 28, 2009 comic. The text reads, with English in parentheses, "Hey, look back up at number 3... you want to use "avergonzada" (embarrassed) there. You put "yo estoy embarazada." (I am pregnant.) You better not be embarazada, Julie, because yo no quiero ser a fuckin' abuela (I don't want to be a fuckin' grandma) at thirty-nine."&lt;ref&gt;Married To The Sea, 02/28/2009, &lt;http://www.marriedtothesea.com/022809/spanish-homework.gif&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*On the ABC sitcom ''[[Modern Family]]'', Gloria is upset that her son Manny is forgetting his Spanish. Manny tells his mother: "Yo soy embarazada." This not only refers to the mistranslation, but also has Manny using the incorrect word for "to be", ''ser'', which is used for characteristics of a person or object, rather than conditions, such as one's being pregnant. Gloria points out his mistake.
*In the animated series ''[[King of the Hill]]'', the character Peggy Hill tells a judge at a courtroom in Mexico that she is "muy embarazada".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cmWlZXSH44&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1063">In '''''Ex parte Alberts''''', an important case in [[South African insolvency law]], the applicant’s schedules showed assets to the value of £76 and fifteen creditors (all concurrent) for £300. The court held that, before a court may accept a voluntary surrender,

* it must be satisfied that it will be to the advantage of creditors of the debtor if his estate is sequestrated;
* the petition must contain a specific allegation that the sequestration will be to the advantage of the creditors; and
* the allegation must be amplified by facts supporting it, save when the figures speak for themselves.

The court held that an insufficient case had been made out to show that the sequestration would be to the advantage to the creditors and that the application should be refused.

A '''fire-resistance rating''' typically means the duration for which a [[passive fire protection]] [[system]] can withstand a standard [[fire test|fire resistance test]]. This can be quantified simply as a measure of time, or it may entail a host of other criteria, involving other evidence of functionality or fitness for purpose.

==Common rating systems==
The following depict the most commonly used international time/temperature curves:
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Din iso astm ul curves.JPG|[[Time]]/[[Temperature]] Curves used for testing the fire-resistance rating of [[passive fire protection]] [[system]]s such as [[firestop]]s, [[fire door]]s, wall and floor assemblies, etc., which are used in [[Compartmentalization (fire protection)|compartmentalisation]] in [[building]]s and the [[petrochemical industry]] in [[Europe]] and [[North America]].
File:Tunnel hc iso curves.jpg|Time/Temperature Curves used for testing the fire-resistance rating of passive fire protection systems in tunnels in [[Germany]], The [[Netherlands]] and [[France]].
File:Rws tunnel curve.jpg|Time/Temperature Curve used for testing the fire-resistance rating of passive fire protection systems in tunnels in The Netherlands.
File:Eurocode 1 curve.jpg|Time/Temperature Curve used for testing the fire-resistance rating of passive fire protection systems in [[Europe]].
File:French hc curve 1.jpg|Time/Temperature Curve used for testing the fire-resistance rating of passive fire protection systems in tunnels in [[France]].
File:German tunnel curves.jpg|Time/Temperature Curve used for testing the fire-resistance rating of passive fire protection systems in tunnels in [[Germany]].
File:Euro furnace pressure.jpg|Furnace [[pressure]] is also subject to standardised tolerances for testing to obtain fire-resistance ratings. This image shows European tolerances, subject to NEN-[[EN 1363-1]].
File:temp tolerance.jpg|Furnace Temperatures for fire testing to obtain fire-resistance ratings are subject to certain tolerances. This graph shows the tolerance applicable to the European building elements / cellulosic curve.
File:Moac_time_temperature_curve_astm_3134.png|MOAC: Mother of all curves “Reprinted, with permission, from E3134-17 Standard Specification for Transportation Tunnel Structural Components and Passive Fire Protection Systems, copyright ASTM International, 100 Barr Harbor Drive, West Conshohocken, PA 19428.  A copy of the complete standard may be obtained from ASTM International, http://www.astm.org."
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==International fire-resistance ratings==
There are many international variations for nearly countless types of products and systems, some with multiple test requirements.

[[Canada]]'s Institute for Research in Construction (a part of the National Research Council and publisher of Canada's model building code - NBC) requires a special test regime for firestops for [[plastic]] [[pipe (material)|pipe]] [[penetrant (mechanical, electrical, or structural)|penetrants]]. Fire endurance tests for this application must be run under 50Pa positive furnace pressure in order to adequately simulate the effect of potential temperature differences between indoor and outdoor temperatures in Canada's winters. Special hoods are applied here to provide suction on the top side of a test assembly in order to reach the 50Pa pressure differential. Afterwards, a 30PSI hose-stream test may be applied.

Outdoor spray [[fireproofing]] methods that must be qualified to the [[hydrocarbon]] curve may be required to pass a host of environmental tests before any burn takes place, to minimize the likelihood that ordinary operational environments cannot render a vital system component useless before it ever encounters a [[fire]].

If critical environmental conditions are not satisfied, an assembly may not be eligible for a fire-resistance rating.

Regardless of the complexity of any given test regime that may lead to a rating, the premise is generally [[product certification]] and, most importantly [[listing and approval use and compliance]]. Testing without certification and installations that cannot be matched with an appropriate [[certification listing]], are not usually recognised by any [[Authority Having Jurisdiction]] (AHJ) unless it is in a realm where [[product certification]] is optional.

==Tests for fire resistance of record protection equipment==
The following classifications may be attained when testing in accordance with UL 72.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ulstandards.ul.com/standard/?id=72|title=Standard 72 - Standard for Tests for Fire Resistance of Record Protect|website=ulstandards.ul.com|accessdate=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Class 125 Rating===
This rating is the requirement in data safes and vault structures for protecting digital information on magnetic media or hard drives.  Temperatures inside the protected chamber must be held below {{convert|125|F|C}} for the time period specified, such as Class 125-2 Hour, with temperatures up to {{convert|2000|F|C}} outside the vault.  The temperature reading is taken on the inside surfaces of the protective structure. Maintaining the temperature below 125&amp;nbsp;°F. is critical because data is lost above that temperature threshold, even if the media or hard drives appear to be intact.

===Class 150 Rating===
This is the rating required to protect microfilm, microfiche, and other film-based information storage media.  Above 150&amp;nbsp;°F (65.5&amp;nbsp;°C) film is distorted by the heat and information is lost.  A Class 150-2 Hour vault must keep the temperature below 150&amp;nbsp;°F. for at least two hours, with temperatures up to 2,000&amp;nbsp;°F. (1,093.3&amp;nbsp;°C) outside the vault.

===Class 350 Rating===
This rating is the requirement for protecting paper documents.  Above 350&amp;nbsp;°F (176.7&amp;nbsp;°C) paper is distorted by the heat and information is lost.  A Class 350-4 Hour vault must keep the temperature below 350&amp;nbsp;°F. for at least four hours, with temperatures up to 2,000&amp;nbsp;°F. (1,093.3&amp;nbsp;°C) outside the vault.

==Different time/temperature curves==
Typically, most countries use the '''building elements curve'''for residential and commercial spaces, which is nearly identical in most countries as that is what results by burning [[wood]]. The building elements curve is characterized jointly by, including, but not limited to, DIN4102, BS476, ASTM E119, ULC-S101, etc. For industrial facilities in the hydrocarbon &amp; petrochemical industries, a hydrocarbon curve (such as UL 1709) is used, reflecting a more rapid temperature rise. The only commonly used exposure beyond this, apart from the more recent tunnel curves shown above, would be the jet fire exposure standards such as ISO 22899, which are used where equipment may be subject to the extreme heat and momentum effects of jet fire exposure.

Big differences between different countries in terms of the use of the curves include the use of pipes, which shield the furnace thermocouples inside of NAFTA testing laboratories. This slows down the response time and results in a somewhat more conservative test regime in [[North America]]. On the other hand, the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] based [[Europe]]an curves run somewhat hotter for most of the test. North America also selectively uses a hose-stream test between 30 and 45PSI, to simulate real-world impacts and damages that may not be simulated in a laboratory. The US Navy even insists on a 90PSI hose-stream test for some of its assemblies, which may simulate the pressure available to firefighters in fighting a fire, but which has little to do with countermeasures against damaging effects of manual fire suppression. The hose-stream is simply intended to add a level of toughness to matters because without this, some fairly flimsy systems can pass a test, thus receive a rating and thus be permissible by a [[building code]] but be so weak that ordinary building use may damage a thus qualified system before it encounters a fire.

Germany's DIN4102 also includes a significant impact test for a potential [[firewall (construction)|firewall]], which is, however, applied from the wrong side: the cold side. Applying the impact from the cold side is more practical to do in a lab setting, however, potential impacts should come from the exposed side, not the unexposed side. Still, for the person designing, building and paying for the test, the fire resistance itself may be rather uneventful unless major problems appear. The burn itself is the long duration, up to 4 hours, but the hose stream test only lasts a few minutes, with large damage potential due to the sudden thermal and kinetic impacts, as the fire was upwards of 1,100&amp;nbsp;°C (see curves above), whereas the sudden hose-stream test is as cold as the domestic water fed to the fire hose used in the test, which might be 10-20&amp;nbsp;°C. This combined impact explains the debris that can be seen coming from test specimens during the hose stream test, as seen herein.

Because of the large differences in test regimes all over the world, even for ''identical products and systems'', organizations that intend to market their products internationally are often required to run many tests in many countries. Even where test regimes are identical, countries are often reluctant to accept the test results and particularly the certification methods of other countries.

During a fire in a [[tunnel]], as well as in the petrochemical industry, temperatures exceed those of ordinary building (cellulosic) fires. This is because the fuel for the fire is [[hydrocarbon]]s, which burn hotter (compare hydrocarbon curve above to ASTM E119 curve), faster and typically run out of fuel faster as well, compared against timber. The added complication with tunnels is that the environment inside a "tube" is best described as a "microclimate". The heat cannot escape as well as it can in a burning refinery, which is in the open. Instead, the fire is confined to a narrow tube, where pressure and heat build up and spread rapidly, with little room for escape and little chance of [[compartmentalization (fire protection)|compartmentalization]]. This scenario was tested and quantified, particularly during the "Eureka Project", run by [[Technische Universität Braunschweig]]'s iBMB, Ekkehard Richter. The Netherlands, through [[Rijkswaterstaat]] in particular, mandated an extremely tough standard, the curve of which is shown in the gallery above.

==Example of a fire stop fire-resistance rating test==
Construction of a test sample consists of a mockup of a section of [[concrete]] floor, with typical mechanical and electrical utility components (pipes and cables) [[penetrant (mechanical, electrical, or structural)|penetrating]] the floor assembly. A [[mortar (firestop)|firestop mortar]] is applied around the penetrations.

The completed test sample is inserted into a furnace such that one side is exposed to a fire. The test is terminated when the fire stops successfully meet the test criteria in minimizing the amount of heat and smoke allowed to pass through the assembly, when the fire penetrates the fire stops. This determines the fire stop '''F-Rating'''. The length of time required for a penetrant or sample on average to exceed a specified average heat rise above ambient at any single location determines the duration for the '''FT Rating''' (Fire and Temperature). If a hose-stream test is passed afterwards, the rating can then be expressed as an '''FTH Rating''' (Fire, Temperature and Hose-stream). The lowest of the three determines the overall rating.

'''''Part B:''''' The Burning Branding Test. This test consists of mock decks being subject the placement of a burning brand in the center of the mock deck to simulate the falling of burning embers during a wildfire. The deck must be absent of flame after the 40 minute test period and lack structural failure of any boards.

'''Glenalvon House''' is a heritage-listed [[homestead (buildings)|homestead]] located at 8 Lithgow Street, [[Campbelltown, New South Wales|Campbelltown]] in the [[City of Campbelltown (New South Wales)|City of Campbelltown]] local government area of [[New South Wales]], Australia. It was designed and built in 1841 by Michael Byrne. It is also known as '''''Glenalvon''''' and '''''Glenalvon'' and Stables'''. The property is owned by Department of Planning and Infrastructure, an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.&lt;ref name=nswshr-4&gt;{{cite NSW SHR|5045750|Glenalvon|hr=00004|fn=EF14/4525; S90/6168; H99/55|accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AHD&gt;{{cite AHD|3257|Glenalvon and Stables, Lithgow St, Campbelltown|date=21 March 1978|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glenalvon House and farm was the family home of Michael Byrne, a publican. The homestead in the [[Australian residential architectural styles#Georgian|Victorian Georgian]] style was built in 1840. The homestead is managed by Campbelltown and Airds Historical Society Inc. as a [[museum]] that is open to the public for a modest fee. 

== History ==
The outline of the house is first shown on two town plans dated November 1840, although the stables are not shown at this time.  It is  thought that Michael Byrne, a publican, built the house around this time on the [[land grant|grant]] of 1 acre and 32 perches which was taken up in 1831. Although it is possible that the outbuildings were not shown, it is more likely that the stables were constructed later (which would be supported by the differing styles of the two buildings).&lt;ref name=nswshr-4/&gt;

Michael Byrne was born in County Wicklow, near Dublin in 1800, the son of Hugh and Sarah Byrne. [[Hugh Byrne (rugby league)|Hugh Byrne]] was convicted without trial and transported to Australia, with his family, in 1802 for treasonous practices in the 1798 Irish Rebellion.  Michael Byrne was made an apprentice to Lawrence Butler, Irish overseer of the [[Government of New South Wales|NSW Government]] Lumber Yards, [[Sydney]].  Michael Byrne went on to own seven pubs in Campbelltown. He was trialled, though not found guilty, of kicking a man to death for non-payment of a debt. Byrne himself was made insolvent in 1844, after having built in 1841, ''Glenalvon'', the finest stone house in the town.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas &amp; McGinnes, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  He died in 1878 and is buried in the Irish corner of the Roman Catholic Cemetery in Campbelltown.&lt;ref name=nswshr-4-42&gt;Oakman, W., in Broadbent, Clarke &amp; Oakman, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-4/&gt;

By the 1840s various members of the Byrne family were experiencing financial difficulties, including Michael who by 1844 owed his brother-in-law, John Keighran (publican) the sum of [[Australian pound|A₤]]880 17[[Australian shilling|s]] 3[[Australian penny|d]].  As partial payment of the debt John accepted the property in Lithgow Street and a {{convert|36|acre|ha|0|adj=on|order=flip}} farm also owned by Byrne.  Keighran is believed to have taken up residence in Glenalvon, along with his wife Catherine Byrne, sometime in 1853.  They would eventually have thirteen children there.  Upon the death of both parents little more than a year apart in 1858, the property passed to two of their sons John and Patrick.&lt;ref name=nswshr-4/&gt;

The property was mortgaged to pay the debts of the estate and the house was let to J. Kidd, JP, who remained in tenancy until 1878 when the property was sold to the Fieldhouse brothers.  The Fieldhouse brothers were prominent businessmen in Campbelltown who owned over 44 properties within the town by 1884.  From 1878-1891 "Glenalvin Hall" was the residence of Edwin Fieldhouse and his family.  From 1891-1904 the property remained in the joint ownership of the brothers at the end of which time they divided their assets with Edwin retaining Glenalvon.&lt;ref name=nswshr-4-43&gt;Lot 91&lt;/ref&gt;  Edwin vacated the house shortly after and it was variously tenanted until 1920 when it was sold to the Bursill Family.&lt;ref name=nswshr-4/&gt;

Glenalvon remained in the ownership of the Bursill family until 1965 when it was acquired by the (then) [[State Planning Authority]] (SPA) for $35,000.&lt;ref name=nswshr-4-44&gt;Lucas interview, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-4/&gt;

In 1969 architect John Fisher (member of the Institute of Architects, the Cumberland County Council Historic Buildings Committee and on the first Council of the [[National Trust of Australia]] (NSW) after its reformation in 1960) was commissioned by the State Planning Authority to restore the first five houses in Campbelltown, which had been resumed under the Cumberland County Planning Scheme. They included Glenalvon.&lt;ref name=nswshr-4/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-4-18&gt;Lucas &amp; McGinness, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970 the house and stables were restored by [[Clive Lucas]] at Fisher Jackson and Hudson and Lucas recalls this property as the conservation project where he first used the then innovative heritage principle of researching and understanding the fabric of a place before attempting conservation, including the use of paint scrapes to establish original paint schemes.&lt;ref name=nswshr-4-44/&gt; The house was tenanted by the Oakham family from 1970 to 2010 and the stables are used as a resource centre by the Campbelltown and [[Airds, New South Wales|Airds]] District Historical Society.&lt;ref name=nswshr-4/&gt;

The State Planning Authority sold Glenalvon to Campbelltown City Council and the Campbelltown &amp; Airds District Historical Society now manage the building and garden, running displays, meetings, events.&lt;ref name=nswshr-4-45&gt;Nicholas, pers.comm., 8/10/2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-4/&gt;

== Description ==
;Garden:
The house is set in a mature garden, which contains some historic plantings including tall columnar Cook's pine (''[[Araucaria columnaris]]''), silky oak (''[[Grevillea robusta]]'') and Californian desert fan palm (''[[Washingtonia robusta]]'').&lt;ref name=nswshr-4/&gt;

;House:
A two-storey [[Australian residential architectural styles#Georgian|Georgian]] finely cut [[sandstone]] residence with symmetrical [[facade]]. The front [[Veranda|verandah]] is stone flagged and is supported by turned stone Doric style [[columns]]. The [[hipped roof]], originally shingled, is now clad in [[Corrugated galvanised iron|corrugated iron]]. The main entrance is located centrally on the southern elevation and double verandah posts on either side emphasise the point of entry. There are shuttered [[French doors]] either side of the main entry, opening onto the verandah. The five windows to the upper floor are double hung, timber sashed and of 9 panes to both the upper and lower [[Sash window|sashes]]. The rear of the house has a verandah supported by flat timber columns. To the rear (north) of the house is located the former stables consisting of a symmetrical rectangular sandstone building with central [[gable]] on the eastern facade containing the entry doors and loft doors above. The hipped and gabled roof is clad in corrugated iron sheeting and has decorative timber barge boards. The roof framings were noted in 1973 as being jointed, dowelled, pegged and numbered without the use of nails (NT Listing). The verandah and [[eaves]] have timber [[Soffit|soffits]]. Cellars are located below the house.&lt;ref name=nswshr-4/&gt;

;Interior:
Original cedar joinery, inc. six panelled doors, splayed panelled jambs to the windows and [[chimney]] pieces to the first floor; [[marble]] ground floor chimney pieces with sandstone mantlepieces; original geometric stair.&lt;ref name=nswshr-4/&gt;

=== Condition ===

As at 1 February 1999, The building and grounds are in excellent condition, having undergone extensive conservation works in 1969. The property has been very well maintained since that time, although the garden is currently somewhat overgrown.&lt;ref name=nswshr-4/&gt;

Glenalvon has survived with much of its significant 1840s fabric intact and the original curtilage and setting of the property can still be interpreted. The property has high overall integrity.&lt;ref name=nswshr-4/&gt;

=== Modifications and dates ===
*1969 - conservation and restoration of the building and grounds.&lt;ref name=nswshr-4/&gt;

The site is currently being evaluated through the preparation of a detailed conservation management plan (CMP). A CMP has been finalised and endorsed by the Heritage Council on 24 July 2000.&lt;ref name=nswshr-4/&gt;

== Heritage listing ==
As at 27 November 1998, Glenalvon is historically, aesthetically and socially significant as one of the oldest urban townhouses in the township of Campbelltown.  The house and stables of Glenalvon are a significant landmark element.  Glenalvon has been used continuously as a residence for almost 160 years and although some changes have been made to the house, much of the original fabric, dating from 1840, has survived intact.  The landscape setting of the house is also important as it represents part of the original curtilage of the property and makes a major contribution to the historic townscape of Campbelltown.&lt;ref name=nswshr-4/&gt;

Glenalvon House was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.&lt;ref name=nswshr-4/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''

Glenalvon is of historical significance as one of the oldest uurban townhouses surviving in the township of Campbelltown.  It is of further historical significance for it association with early and prominent families of the Campbelltown district and for its links to a way of life which has long since disappeared.&lt;ref name=nswshr-4/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''

Glenalvon is of high aesthetic significance as a particularly fine Colonial Georgian sandstone residence retaining much of its 1840s fabric intact.  The stables buildings are also of high aesthetic significance as are the grounds which give an indication of the early curtilage of the property.  The house combined with its grounds are important as reminders of the setting of early town houses with their generously landscaped grounds. Both the building and grounds make a considerable contribution to the historic townscape of Campbelltown.&lt;ref name=nswshr-4/&gt;

'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''

Glenalvon is of high social significance for its association with several prominent Campbelltown families and for its demonstration of the early pattern of life in the original township.&lt;ref name=nswshr-4/&gt;

'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''

Glenalvon is of high technical/research significance for its demonstration of  colonial building techniques and for its use of local building materials and craftsmen, particularly the stonemasons, some of whom were convicts.&lt;ref name=nswshr-4/&gt;

'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''

Glenalvon is a rare surviving example of an 1840s townhouse to survive with much of its 1840s fabric and grounds intact, indicating the stature of such houses at the time of their construction.&lt;ref name=nswshr-4/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''

Glenalvon is an excellent example of an 1840s townhouse in the Colonial Georgian style.&lt;ref name=nswshr-4/&gt;

'''Google Shopping''',&lt;ref name="Google Commerce: Building a better shopping experience"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://googlecommerce.blogspot.com/2012/05/building-better-shopping-experience.html|title=Google Commerce: Building a better shopping experience|date=31 May 2012|publisher=Google Commerce Blog|accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; formerly '''Google Product Search''', '''Google Products''' and '''Froogle''', is a [[Google]] service invented by [[Craig Nevill-Manning]] which allows users to search for products on online shopping websites and compare prices between different vendors.

Originally, the service listed prices submitted by merchants, and was monetized through [[AdWords]] advertising like other Google services. However, in May 2012, Google announced that the service (which was also immediately renamed Google Shopping) would shift in late-2012 to a paid model where merchants would have to pay the company in order to list their products on the service.&lt;ref name="Google Commerce: Building a better shopping experience" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj-p2p"/&gt;

In June 2017, Google Shopping was fined a record €2.4 billion by the EU Commission for giving its own online shopping services top priority in search results.&lt;ref name=rapid-1784&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-1784_en.htm|title=European Commission - PRESS RELEASES  - Press release - Antitrust: Commission fines Google €2.42 billion for abusing dominance as search engine by giving illegal advantage to own comparison shopping service|website=europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Created by [[Craig Nevill-Manning]]&lt;ref name="ViseMalseed2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David A. Vise|author2=Mark Malseed|title=The Google Story|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4appEmPMdF8C&amp;pg=PA137|year=2006|publisher=Delta Trade Paperbacks|isbn=978-0-553-38366-9|pages=137–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and launched in December 2002, Froogle was different from most other [[price comparison service]]s in that it used Google's [[web crawler]] to index product data from the websites of vendors instead of using paid submissions. As with Google Search, Froogle was instead monetized using Google's [[AdWords]] keyword advertising platform.&lt;ref name=cnet-frooglelaunch&gt;{{cite web|title=Google searches out an e-tail niche|url=http://news.cnet.com/Google-searches-out-an-e-tail-niche/2100-1017_3-977042.html|publisher=CNET|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bw-froogle&gt;{{cite web|title=Will Froogle Be a Google for Shoppers? |url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2003-01-13/will-froogle-be-a-google-for-shoppers |publisher=Businessweek |accessdate=28 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608154527/http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2003-01-13/will-froogle-be-a-google-for-shoppers |archivedate=8 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With its re-branding as Google Product Search, the service was modified to emphasize integration with [[Google Search]]; listings from the service could now appear alongside web search results.&lt;ref name=cnet-pun/&gt;

Google prominently featured the service result in [[Google Search]] starting in January 2008 in Germany and the United Kingdom. It subsequently extended the practice to France in October 2010, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain in May 2011, the Czech Republic in February 2013 and Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Poland and Sweden in November 2013.&lt;ref name=rapid-1784/&gt;

===Change to paid listings===
Alongside the announcement of an immediate re-brand to '''Google Shopping''' on May 31, 2012, Google also announced that in late 2012, it would change the service to use a "pay-to-play" model, where merchants would have to pay Google to list their products on the service, with results influenced by both relevance and the bid amounts they pay. Google justified the move by stating that it would allow the service to "deliver the best answers for people searching for products and help connect merchants with the right customers."&lt;ref name="Google Commerce: Building a better shopping experience" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Google Product Search To Become Google Shopping"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchengineland.com/google-product-search-to-become-google-shopping-use-pay-to-play-model-122959|title=Google Product Search To Become Google Shopping, Use Pay-To-Play Model|last=Sullivan|first=Danny|date=31 May 2012|publisher=Search Engine Land|accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The change proved controversial; some small businesses showed concern that they would not be able to compete with larger companies that can afford a larger advertising budget.&lt;ref name="wsj-p2p"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304821304577438614258563608|title=Google Makes Shopping Site Pay-to-Play|last=Efrati|first=Amir|date=1 June 2012|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft]]'s [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] also attacked the move in an advertising campaign known as "[[Scroogled]]," which called Google out for using "deceptive advertising practices" and suggesting that users use its competing Bing Shopping service instead.&lt;ref name=iw-scroogled&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft Scroogled Site Challenges Google Shopping Honesty|url=http://www.informationweek.com/byte/personal-tech/consumer-services/microsoft-scroogled-site-challenges-goog/240142956|publisher=InformationWeek|accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google also revealed plans to integrate [[Google Catalogs]] with Google Shopping, to give users "more ways to find ideas and inspiration as you shop and engage with your favorite brand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/01/google-catalogs-comes-to-the-web-now-integrated-with-google-shopping/|title=Google Catalogs Comes To The Web, Now Integrated With Google Shopping|publisher=TechCrunch|accessdate=October 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, Google Shopping was fined a record €2.4 billion by the EU Commission for giving its own online shopping services top priority in search results.&lt;ref name=rapid-1784/&gt;

==Naming==
Google Shopping was originally known as '''Froogle''', a pun on the term "[[wikt:frugal|frugal]]." On April 18, 2007, the product was renamed '''Google Product Search'''; the name was dropped due to concerns surrounding internationalization, people not understanding the [[pun]] or understanding what the service was actually about, and concerns related to the company's [[trademark infringement]] lawsuit against competing website Froogles.&lt;ref name=cnet-pun&gt;{{cite web|title=Google takes the pun out of shopping|date=18 April 2007| url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1038_3-6177393.html|publisher=CNET|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 31, 2012, the product was renamed to '''Google Shopping'''.&lt;ref name="Google Commerce: Building a better shopping experience"/&gt; The URL "froogle.com" remains as a redirect to Google Shopping's website.

== Antitrust fine ==
On June 27, 2017, the European Commissioner for Competition, [[Margrethe Vestager]], decided to fine Google €2.4 billion for breaching EU antitrust rules. Google was found to have abused its market dominance as a search engine by giving illegal advantages to another Google product, its own comparison shopping service.&lt;ref name="europa"&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_STATEMENT-17-1806_en.htm Statement by Commissioner Vestager on Commission decision to fine Google €2.42 billion for abusing dominance as search engine by giving illegal advantage to own comparison shopping service], on ''europa.eu'', accessed on 7 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the European Commission, Google started giving its own Froogle significantly better treatment than rivals as early as 2008. It first began in [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]], followed by [[France]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Spain]], then the [[Czech Republic]] and finally [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]] and [[Sweden]]. A total 418 million citizens of the [[European Economic Area]] are claimed to have been deprived of the full benefits of competition, genuine choice and innovation.&lt;ref name="europa"/&gt; Further damage payments may have to be required from Google should it not comply with European antitrust rules within 90 days.&lt;ref name="europa"/&gt;

The '''Greenland National Museum''' ({{lang-kl|Nunatta katersugaasivia allagaateqarfialu}}) is located in [[Nuuk]], the capital of [[Greenland]]. It was one of the first museums established in Greenland, inaugurated in the mid-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.natmus.gl/Forsiden/tabid/80/language/en-US/Default.aspx |publisher=Greenland National Museum |title=The Museum |accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum has many artefacts related to archaeology, history, art, and handicrafts and also has information about ruins, graveyards, buildings etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adopt.museum140.com/2012/07/17/46-national-museum-of-greenland/|title=#46 National Museum of Greenland  -  Adopt-a-Museum|website=adopt.museum140.com|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based in a warehouse which was built in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/greenland/nuuk-town-godthab/sights/other/greenland-national-museum|title=Greenland National Museum|website=www.lonelyplanet.com|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qilakitsoq mummies==
A major display in the museum contains the [[Qilakitsoq|Qilakitsoq mummies]]. The mummies consist of three women and a six-month-old child, half of the mummies found at Qilakitsoq.

==Other displays==
The museum also houses a display on social change in the 1950s and one on geology. Several other nearby buildings also fall under the museums protection, such as the restocked cooper's workshop and a display on blubber vats and presses.

'''''Killing Time''''' is a ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' novel written by [[Della Van Hise]] and published by [[Pocket Books]] in 1985. The original manuscript had [[Kirk/Spock]] [[slash fiction]] elements, and these were requested to be removed by [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]. However, they were not removed, and 250,000 copies were printed. These romantic undertones between [[Spock]] and [[James T. Kirk]] were brought to the attention of the office of the creator of ''[[Star Trek]]'', [[Gene Roddenberry]], who made Pocket Books recall the first edition. This edition subsequently became a collector's item, with more than fifty changes made to a revised version.

==Plot==
The [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']] is on patrol near the [[Romulan]] neutral zone and the crew is experiencing unusual dreams. Captain [[James T. Kirk]] and Science Officer [[Spock]] both confess that they are having dreams that Spock is Captain of the ship and Kirk is an Ensign. Kirk informs Spock that [[Starfleet]] intelligence has discovered that the Romulans are attempting to use time travel and are sending more ships to investigate. Captain Kirk goes to sleep, and awakes as Ensign Kirk on the VSS ''ShiKahr'', which appears to otherwise be the ''Enterprise''. The Ensign is a drug addled ex-convict who has been on board for only a day.

The Romulans had attempted to travel back in time and destroy the [[Federation (Star Trek)|Federation]], but they instead created a Federation dominated by [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcans]]. They shielded a ship from the changes and compare the differences, realising that it needs to be reversed. Meanwhile, Captain Spock begins to act protectively of Ensign Kirk, but the Captain is injured on an away mission. After [[Doctor McCoy]] conducts a series of mental scans, the crew of the ''ShiKahr'' realise that history has been altered. The Romulans plot to use Kirk to force Spock to impersonate their leader. Spock [[Vulcan (Star Trek)#Mind_melds|mindmeld]]s with Kirk, each realising their personas from the main timeline.

Romulan agents board the ''ShiKahr'' and capture Kirk. Spock agrees to their demands and travels with them. Whilst en route, Spock enters [[pon farr]] and finds that he is linked to Kirk, but mates with the Romulan Thea to allow it to pass. They retrieve Kirk, and discover that taking Kirk and Spock was a ploy to have them both travel back in time to stop the Romulan agents from preventing the formation of the Federation. They travel back in time and disable the agents, but Spock is seriously injured and dying. Kirk and Spock mindmeld as reality shifts once more and restores the original timeline.

==Development==
[[image:Leonard Nimoy William Shatner Star Trek 1968.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The original manuscript included Kirk/Spock slash fiction overtones]]
The original manuscript of ''Killing Time'' included [[Kirk/Spock]] based [[slash fiction]] overtones.&lt;ref name=ansible1985/&gt; The foundation of this genre of writing dated back to the 1970s with [[fan fiction|fan created fiction]] about Kirk and Spock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barnett|first1=David|title=For slash fiction devotees, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/dec/18/fan-fiction-slash-fiction-caitlin-moran|accessdate=September 25, 2014|work=The Guardian|date=December 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has since become a term typically used for same-sex unofficial fiction. Author [[Della van Hise]] had previously written these types of stories about those characters.&lt;ref name=woledge /&gt; When that manuscript was sent by [[Pocket Books]] for approval by [[Paramount Studios]], the pages with the slash fiction were marked to be edited out of the eventual novel. It was returned, but at the time Pocket Books were between editors as [[Mimi Panich]] had just left, and her replacement [[Karen Haas (editor)|Karen Haas]] had not yet arrived. At some point, someone went through the manuscript and marked the pages which Paramount had asked to be removed with the letters "[[STET]]",&lt;ref name=ansible1985&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nielsen Hayden|first=Teresa|authorlink=Teresa Nielsen Hayden|title=Complaints Dept/Letters|journal=Ansible|date=September 1985|issue=44|url=http://news.ansible.co.uk/a44.html|issn=0265-9816|accessdate=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a [[Latin]] term used by proofreaders to tell the printer to disregard earlier changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stet|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/stet|publisher=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pocket Books published 250,000 copies of ''Killing Time'' in the first print run.&lt;ref name=ansible1985/&gt; After the publishing, [[Gene Roddenberry]]'s assistant, [[Richard Arnold (TV consultant)|Richard Arnold]], received a letter from a reader stating that the book was suggesting a romantic link between Kirk and Spock.&lt;ref name=ayers59&gt;[[#ayers2006|Ayers (2006)]]: p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; This was passed to Roddenberry, the creator of ''[[Star Trek]]'', who reportedly "became livid".&lt;ref name=ayers59/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#alexander1994|Alexander (1994)]]: p. 486&lt;/ref&gt; Following his complaints to [[Pocket Books]], the first print run of the novel was recalled and destroyed.&lt;ref name=ayers59/&gt; Pocket Books had already shipped between 100,000 and 150,000 copies of the book to retailers. When the news broke, fans began purchasing the novels before they could be removed from the shelves as the first edition was expected to become a collector's item.&lt;ref name=ansible1985/&gt; Van Hise later said of that version of the novel, "If someone went looking for 'questionable material', in ''Killing Time'', they could find it... Just as beauty is in supposedly in the mind of the beholder, so is questionable material."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Hise|first=Della|journal=Datazine|date=October–November 1985|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than fifty changes were made to the novel before it was republished as a second edition.&lt;ref name=ayers59/&gt;

Following the issues with the publishing of ''Killing Time'', there was increased oversight by Roddenberry's staff regarding the novels published by Pocket Books. This was delegated to Arnold, and would later cause confusion for Pocket Books as comments would be sent back and it was sometimes unclear whether they were from Roddenberry or Arnold. These comments rejected plot developments in the novels where they were stepping out of the bounds set by the television series.&lt;ref name=xii&gt;[[#ayers2006|Ayers (2006)]]: p. xii&lt;/ref&gt; Rumours subsequently spread that there was an alternative version of the manuscript with more explicit Kirk/Spock slash details, something that Van Hise later denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Interview with Della Van Hise|journal=Three Letter Words: OMG|date=September 2011|issue=1|pages=11–17|url=https://www.academia.edu/1050137/Three_Letter_Words_OMG|accessdate=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Ellen Cheeseman-Meyer, writing for [[Tor Books|Tor.com]] in February 2013, said that ''Killing Time'' was "incredibly romantic".&lt;ref name=torreview&gt;{{cite web|last=Cheeseman-Meyer|first=Ellen|title=Spock Loves Kirk.

'''Letters close''' ({{lang-la|litterae clausae}}) are a type of obsolete legal document once used by the British monarchy, certain officers of government and by the Pope, which is a sealed letter granting a right, monopoly, title, or status to an individual or to some entity such as a corporation. These letters were personal in nature, and were delivered folded and [[Seal (emblem)#Sealing practices|seal]]ed, so that only the recipient could read their contents.&lt;ref name=Clanchy91&gt; {{cite book |last=Clanchy |first= C. T. |title=From Memory to Written Record: England 1066–1307|edition=Second |year= 1993 |publisher= Blackwell Publishing |location=Malden, MA |isbn= 978-0-631-16857-7 |page = 91}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of letter contrasts with the better-known [[letters patent]].

It was necessary to break the seal to open and read the letter, and so its arrival with the seal intact showed that it had not been intercepted or tampered with. However, once the seal was broken, it could no longer confirm the authenticity of the document. 

==In the Kingdom of England==
{{See also|Close Roll}}
In this realm the letters could be issued by the monarch or government. The original [[charter]]s of [[Edward the Confessor]] can be considered to be a form of letters close, as they were delivered wrapped, with the seal hanging down.

This type of letter later developed into the formal business letters that we are familiar with today.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

It is thought that the earliest surviving English instance remaining unopened dates to the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].&lt;ref name=Clanchy91/&gt; In England these letters are typical of those generated by the developing state bureaucracy.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} From 1204, copies of English letters close transcribed onto the [[Close Roll]]s are extant.&lt;ref name=Saul116&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Saul |first= Nigel |title=Government |encyclopedia=A Companion to Medieval England 1066–1485 |editor-last=Saul |editor-first = Nigel |authorlink=Nigel Saul  |year=2000 |publisher=Tempus |location= Stroud|isbn=0-7524-2969-8 |pages=115–118 at 116}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, examples of actual letters close, as opposed to the recorded copies in the Close Rolls, are extremely rare, and most of those exist because King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] required the return of some to the government.&lt;ref name=Clanchy91/&gt;  

Over time, however, as new document series emerged, the scope of the Close Rolls narrowed; and after 1533 their contents consisted solely of copies of private deeds and awards of enclosure, and the like.&lt;ref&gt;S. H. Steinberg, ''A New Dictionary of British History'' (London 1963) p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

==Litterae clausae of the ope==
Another example of letters close is papal letters close. These often had the [[lead]]en [[papal bull]]a attached to the letter with a [[hemp]] cord, in contrast to the fine silk cords used for higher grades of document. The cords were often threaded through the letter to keep it folded, with the address written on the ''dorse'' (back) of the document (endorsed) for the entrusted deliverers to read.

'''''Letters to a German Princess, On Different Subjects in Physics and Philosophy''''' (French: ''Lettres à une princesse d'Allemagne sur divers sujets de physique et de philosophie'') were a series of 234 letters written by the mathematician [[Leonhard Euler]] between 1760 and 1762 addressed to [[Friederike Charlotte of Brandenburg-Schwedt]] and her younger sister [[Louise of Brandenburg-Schwedt|Louise]].&lt;ref name="Fellmann2007"&gt;{{harvnb|Fellmann|2007|pp=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
Euler started the first letter with an explanation of the concept of "[[Measurement|size]]". Starting with the definition of a foot, he defined the [[German obsolete units of measurement#Meile (mile)|mile]] and the [[Earth physical characteristics tables|diameter of the earth]] as a unit in terms of foot and then calculated the distance of the planets of the [[Solar System]] in terms of the diameter of the earth.&lt;ref name=Opusculum2010-2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klyve|first=Dominic|title=Euler as Master Teacher in Letters to a German Princess |journal=Opusculum |date=Autumn 2010 |volume=2 |issue=2  |url=http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/eulersociety/opusculum/Opusculum2010-2.pdf |accessdate=October 21, 2013}}{{deadlink|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
The first two volumes of the 234 letters originally written in French appeared in print in [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1768 and the third in [[Frankfurt]] in 1774. The letters were later reprinted in [[Paris]] with the first volume in 1787, the second in 1788 and the third in 1789.&lt;ref name=Ho&gt;{{cite web|last=Ho|first=Andie|title=Comparison to the last edition of Euler’s Letters published by de Condorcet, with the original edition|url=http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/docs/translations/E092trans.pdf|work=Article, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication of the book was supported by the empress [[Catherine II]] with her personally writing to [[Mikhail Illarionovich Vorontsov|Count Vorontsov]] in January 1766:&lt;ref name="BogoliubovMikhailov2007"&gt;{{harvnb|Bogoliubov et al.|2007|pp=307–316}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|I am certain that the academy will be resurrected from its ashes by such an important acquisition, and congratulate myself in advance in having restored this great man to Russia.|[[Catherine II]], quoted by Bogoliubov et al|Euler and Modern Science&lt;ref name="BogoliubovMikhailov2007" /&gt;}}

Russian translation of the letters followed in [[Saint Petersburg]] by Euler's student [[Stepan Rumovsky]] between 1768 and 1774 in 3 volumes.&lt;ref name="BogoliubovMikhailov2007" /&gt;

==Translations==

The first English translation of the Letters were done by the Scottish minister [[Henry Hunter (divine)|Henry Hunter]] in 1795.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Hunter, Henry|last=Goodwin|first=Gordon|authorlink=|volume=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hunter targeted the translation at British women, believing that Euler intended to educate the females through his work.&lt;ref name=Opusculum2011-1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klyve |first=Dominic |title=Euler’s Letters to a German Princess:Betrayal and Translation |journal=Opusculum |date=Spring 2011 |volume=3 |issue=1 |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/etou/eulersoc/documents/opusculum/Opusculum-2011-1.pdf |accessdate=February 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The translation of Hunter was based on the 1787 Paris Edition, of  [[Marquis de Condorcet]] and [[Sylvestre François Lacroix]]. The translation differed from the original letters of Euler in its omission of "... the frequent, tiresome, courtly address of YOUR HIGHNESS". 
The [[Marquis de Condorcet]]'s translation, made during the [[Age of Enlightenment]],  was notable for its omission of Euler’s theological references which Condorcet found as "anathema" to teaching science and [[rationalism]].&lt;ref name=Opusculum2011-2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klyve |first=Dominic |title=Seeking the Original Text of Euler’s Letters to a German Princess |journal=Opusculum |date=Summer 2011 |volume=3 |issue=2 |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/etou/eulersoc/documents/opusculum/Opusculum-2011-2.pdf |accessdate=February 5, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Translations followed in other languages including Spanish (1798) which differed from the original book by a footnote describing the newly discovered planet [[Uranus]]. Subsequent German edition (1847), and French editions (1812 and 1829) were also noted for their reference to Uranus and four minor planets respectively.&lt;ref name=Opusculum2011-1 /&gt;

[[File:London Metropolitan Archives front.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.4|London Metropolitan Archives: main building and entrance]]
The '''London Metropolitan Archives''' ('''LMA''') is the principal local government [[archive|archive repository]] for the [[Greater London]] area, including the [[City of London]]: it is the largest [[county record office]] in the United Kingdom. It was established under its present name in 1997, having previously been known as the Greater London Record Office. It is administered and financed by the [[City of London Corporation]].

The archive is based at 40 Northampton Road, [[Clerkenwell]], London. It attracts over 30,000 visitors a year and deals with a similar number of written enquiries. LMA's extensive holdings amount to over 72 miles of records of local, regional and national importance. With the earliest record dating from 1067, the archive charts the development of the capital into a modern-day major world city.

==History==
London Metropolitan Archives in its current form is essentially an amalgamation of four separate bodies. The first three were the London County Record Office, the London County Council Members Library and the Middlesex County Record Office, which merged in 1965 to form the Greater London Record Office and History Library (GLRO). The GLRO became London Metropolitan Archives in 1997, and took over the former [[City of London Corporation|Corporation of London]] Record Office (CLRO) in 2005.

===London County Record Office===
Until 1889, London was still the area within the walled city; to the south of the river was [[Surrey]] and [[Kent]] and to the north of the city's limits was [[Middlesex]]. These areas, however, had become densely populated and, given the sphere of influence of the city, traditional boundaries were no longer practical. The County of London was created and controlled by the newly formed [[London County Council]], which took over many of the duties of its predecessor the [[Metropolitan Board of Works]]. It was the records of these bodies and similar groups such as the [[London School Board]] and [[Metropolitan Asylums Board]] that would form the nucleus of the London County Record offices holdings, which were based at County Hall on the south bank of the [[River Thames]].

As well as the official records that the council generated, they also began to accept deposits of records fundamental to London's history, such as copies of memorials from the Middlesex deeds register, diocesan and parish records and records of charities such as the [[Foundling Hospital]]. Under the [[Public Records Act 1958]], the record office became recognised as a place of deposit for public records.

Since the creation of the London County Council there had been a record keeper in the Clerks Department who held custody of the documents. By the 1930s they had established individual departmental record rooms staffed by record assistants working under the general supervision of the Record Keeper. Finally in 1953 the position of Head Archivist and Librarian was created.

===London County Council Members Library===

The library was originally that of the members of the London County Council and reflected their interests. Situated in the same building as the London County Record Office, the library was added to with books on the history and topography of London. The library also included a rich collection of maps, prints, drawings and photographs.

===Middlesex County Record Office===
No single act or resolution marked the beginning of the Middlesex County Record Office. Like most other county record offices it developed naturally from the duty of the [[Clerk of the Peace]] to preserve certain records from the [[Quarter Sessions]], together with other records such as enclosure awards and plans of public utilities. The first significant period in the formation of the county record office was in the early 1880s when a special committee was appointed by the [[justices of the peace]] to consider and report on the accommodation provided for the storage of the "old records" of the county. On behalf of the committee, [[John Cordy Jeaffreson]], an inspector of the [[Historical Manuscripts Commission]], sorted the records covering 1549–1820 into 87 classes comprising more than 10,000 volumes and nearly 5000 rolls. The more modern records from post-1820 were given a separate room.

The formation of the London County Council in 1889 had seen the County of [[Middlesex]] much reduced in size. In 1893 when the Middlesex sessions papers were to be moved from the sessions house in [[Clerkenwell]] (an area that was previously Middlesex but now London) an argument broke out between the two [[county councils]] as to who should have responsibility for the material. This protracted dispute lasted some five years, with a high court judge eventually deciding in favour of Middlesex.

Around the same time, a [[Middlesex County Council]] act empowered the council to spend money preserving, arranging, indexing, classifying and publishing such records of the county that may be in the public interest. In 1913 the new [[Middlesex Guildhall]] at [[City of Westminster|Westminster]] opened and was equipped with specially constructed muniment rooms, with an assistant to arrange and supervise their transfer from temporary storage. It was not until 1923 that a full-time graduate assistant was placed in charge of dealing with things such as document repair, storage issues, written enquiries, production of documents for public researchers and receipt of any gifts or deposits.

After the Second World War, the work of the county record office expanded steadily, with the appointment of a County [[Archivist]], first in a part-time capacity (Colonel [[William Le Hardy]]), then full-time from 1957. By then, the archive had also moved to new premises at 1 Queen Anne's Gate Buildings, Dartmouth Street. In 1960 the record office was appointed an official place of deposit by the [[Lord Chancellor]] under section 4 (1) of the [[Public Records Act 1958]]. After this, the archive increased its holdings, with significant deposits of [[petty sessions]], coroners, Boards of Guardians and other official material. By this time, the record office had acquired an extensive reference library on the topography of Middlesex, as well as a great number of maps, prints and photographs.

===The Greater London Record Office ===
[[File:London Metropolitan Archives repository.JPG|thumb|right|1990s repository block]]

Under the Local [[London Government Act 1963]], which came into effect on 1 April 1965, the administrative counties of London and Middlesex together with their respective county councils were abolished. They were replaced by the [[Greater London Council]] (GLC) which administered a much wider area known as [[Greater London]]. The formation of Greater London also meant that some areas that had been previously part of [[Kent]], [[Surrey]], [[Essex]] and [[Hertfordshire]], were also now included. However, to minimise confusion, it was agreed that records from these areas should remain within their ancient county.

The Greater London Council took over responsibility for the established record offices of the counties of London and [[Middlesex]], as well as the former member's library of the London County Council. Together, these became the Greater London Record Office (GLRO) and Library. Although administratively united, the new archive continued to exist at two separate sites, with Middlesex material still held at Dartmouth Street and London material at County Hall (the record office being approximately where the [[London Aquarium]] is now situated). The two archives finally came together in 1979, when the Dartmouth Street site was sold by the GLC, and both archives were housed at County Hall.

In 1982 the GLRO moved to adapted premises at 40 Northampton Road, Clerkenwell. This site was a former print works, home to the Temple Press. The Press had moved from nearby Roseberry Avenue in August 1939, and continued to use the site until the end of the 1960s.

The Greater London Council was abolished in 1986, and since that date the archives have been administered by the [[City of London Corporation]]. In the early 1990s work started on a new block adjacent to the site in Northampton Road. This extension conformed to [[BS 5454|archival storage standards]], with [[mobile shelving]] and environmental controls.

===London Metropolitan Archives ===
[[File:London Metropolitan Archives.jpg|thumb|right|upright|End of repository block, displaying the [[Coat of arms of the City of London|City of London coat of arms]]]]

The GLRO was renamed the London Metropolitan Archives in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/london-metropolitan-archives/about/Documents/archive-preservation-and-conservation-policy.pdf "Archive Preservation and Conservation policy"], City of London Culture, Heritage and Libraries Department, London Metropolitan Archives, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the archives of the [[City of London Corporation|Corporation of London]] Records Office were moved to the London Metropolitan Archives (LMA) while the Guildhall underwent a vast refurbishment programme. The City of London Corporation is the local government authority for the City of London, the area often referred to as the Square Mile. These archives include the earliest material currently held at LMA, dating from 1067. The archive contains the official records of how the City was governed and developed, through bodies such as the [[Court of Aldermen]] and Court of Common Council and many other official departments like the Chamberlains (which dealt with people being given the freedom of the city). It also contains a large number of records of organisations which the City of London Corporation are responsible for such as the [[City of London Police]], a number of courts and many of the major London markets.

In 2006 LMA merged with the City of London Libraries and Guildhall Art Gallery to form the City of London Department of Libraries, Archives and Guildhall Art Gallery. Within this department, LMA sits in an administrative group with the [[Guildhall Library]] (a major historical reference library for London, holding printed books, manuscripts and map and print collections), the [[Guildhall Art Gallery]] and [[Keats House]] based at [[Hampstead]], the London home of the poet [[John Keats]]. The department also includes three lending libraries and the City Business Library.

==Collections==

The records held at the London Metropolitan Archives have been arranged in 17 major classes, of which a number are detailed below. Not all collections are available for consultation. Uncatalogued collections can be made available only by prior appointment made at least 48 hours in advance of the intended visit. Some material is restricted or closed because it contains sensitive information relating to named individuals, other records may require written permission from the depositor before you can view them.

===Associations===
LMA holds records of many associations all with very different purposes. A large number of records are associations with political purposes such as the London Labour Party, London Liberal Party as well as regional branches of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. The records of associations also include a number of trade unions including the [[National Union of Teachers]] London and Middlesex branches, the Transport Salaried Staff Association and the Union of Post office Workers. Within the field of education there are records of The National Education Association and the London Head Teachers Association.

Records of pressure groups and campaigning organisations such as the National United Temperance Council and the Royal Society for Checking the Abuses of Public Advertising are also held. One of the larger series of records held are those belonging to the Public Morality Council. Formed in 1899 to combat vice and indecency in London, its members included representatives of all the major religions as well as leaders in education and medicine. The council continued until 1969 concentrating latterly on opposition to sexual immorality and pornography particularly with regards to theatre, cinema, radio and television.

A number of the records relate to groups promoting the arts, sport and recreation. Of particular note are the records of the [[Royal Society of Portrait Painters]], though consultation of these archives, are subject to obtaining written permission. Other records include the Artists League of Great Britain, and The Royal Choral Society. On a more sporting theme, there are records of the London Schools Football Association, the National Amateur Rowing Association and the [[Ramblers Association]].

[[File:Peabody Buildings 1863.jpg|thumb|right|The first block of [[Peabody Trust|Peabody dwellings]] in [[Commercial Street (London)|Commercial Street]], [[Spitalfields]]: a wood-engraving published in 1863, shortly before the building opened]]
The Associations series includes the archives of the [[Peabody Trust]]. The trust has its origins in a donation of £500,000 made by the American philanthropist, [[George Peabody]], for the benefit of the people of London, the city where he had spent most of his adult life. The donation was put into the hands of trustees who were to ensure that it was used to "ameliorate the condition of the poor" of London. It was agreed that cheap, clean housing would best fulfil the intention of the gift, and that the Trust would provide an alternative to the [[Model Dwellings Companies]] who operated on a private, less [[philanthropic]] basis. The first housing estate was opened in [[Spitalfields]] in 1864 and consisted of 57 dwellings and 9 shops. Further block estates were built in [[Southwark]], [[Lambeth]], [[City of Westminster|Westminster]], [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], [[Islington]] and [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peabody.org.uk/about-us/history/the-early-years-1865-1875.aspx Peabody Trust Peabody Trust] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721084008/http://www.peabody.org.uk/about-us/history/the-early-years-1865-1875.aspx |date=2011-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection includes registers of tenants, photographs, plans and administrative and financial records.

===Businesses===

LMA holds many archives from businesses that operated in the London and Middlesex areas. These are arranged alphabetically by the name of the company. One of the major collections in the series is that of the Predecessors of [[Transport for London|London Transport]]. These include a number of railway companies, particularly the [[Metropolitan Railway]] and many of the London Omnibus Companies, as well as the records of the [[London Passenger Transport Board]], which unified services in the London area for the first time and ran from 1933 to 1948.

Another important collection is the archives of [[Thames Water]] Predecessors. The archive comprises the records of major institutions that supplied water to the metropolis between 1582 and 1974. Up to 1902 the work was largely carried out by private companies operating under increasing public control as time went on. The records of each company have been catalogued separately except in cases where takeover occurred. The companies include London Bridge Waterworks Company and the [[New River Company]]. In 1902 all the smaller private institutions were taken over by the [[Metropolitan Water Board (London)|Metropolitan Water Board]], which assumed supply responsibilities for an area covering {{convert|576|sqmi|km2}}. The surviving records include corporate material such as board minutes and legal papers, accounts, staff records, engineering and technical files, plans, photos and property records.

[[J. Lyons and Co.]] was founded in 1886 as a catering business for exhibitions in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[Glasgow]], Paris and London. By 1894 it had become a public company and it rapidly established a chain of teashops, corner houses and restaurants. This is one of the most intriguing business collections deposited, for as well as all the usual corporate records such as management, finance and administration, the collection is particularly strong in what may be termed ephemera. There are hundreds of photographs starting from as early 1887, a few films and videos, a large collection of press cuttings, advertisements, menus, lithographs and even a [[Nippy]]'s uniform.

Brewers have supplied the metropolis with beer for at least five centuries and by 1700 around 200 common brewers existed. As the industry evolved through acquisitions and competitive means, a hierarchy developed. By 1830 a few large companies dominated, supported by a base of smaller concerns. Several London brewers joined the ranks of England's greatest industrial enterprises and the LMA holds archives of six of those major companies. These include [[Truman, Hanbury, Buxton &amp; Co]] Ltd, [[Courage]], Barclay &amp; Simonds Ltd, [[Watney Combe &amp; Reid|Watney, Combe, Reid, Ltd]], latterly Watney Mann Ltd, and [[Whitbread &amp; Co Ltd]]. The surviving records include administrative and financial records, staff records, property records photographs and ephemera.

===Charities===
[[Image:Charterhouse Hospital, engraved by Toms, c.1770..jpg|thumb|right|The [[London Charterhouse|Charterhouse]]: an engraving of c.1770]]
LMA's holdings of charities records date from the early 17th century and include notable foundations such as Archbishop Tenison's Grammar School, the [[Corporation of the Sons of the Clergy]] and [[Sutton's Hospital]] (Charterhouse) which was founded by [[Thomas Sutton]] in 1611 for the benefit of distressed gentlemen and the education of poor boys. Many of the charities are concerned with housing, education and medicine. One of the major collections is that of the [[Charity Organisation Society]], now known as the Family Welfare Association which was formed to make sure that charitable organisations did not overlap with each other in terms of what they were trying to achieve.

Amongst the many archives of housing associations held, are records of the [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]]. The [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]] was the vision and accomplishment of [[Henrietta Barnett]] who together with her husband Canon [[Samuel Augustus Barnett]] set about creating an estate where the working classes could live within pleasant surroundings. The land near [[Hampstead]] was purchased via the Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust that she had formed. A total of {{convert|323|acre|km2}} were purchased for £140,000 by 1907. The idea was that the estate would be aesthetically pleasing consisting of low-density housing and thoroughly planned with a mix of buildings and nature. The community would be served by a range of local amenities including churches, libraries, schools, an institute of education and shops. Henrietta wanted to bring different classes together in one area. Unfortunately though the houses may have been more modest, they were still too expensive for many working-class people. Increased building costs and the shortage of local employment meant that the suburb would become largely middle-class. By 1936 building was virtually complete and the suburb was home to some 16,000 people. The collection is particularly valuable to those interested in the history of planned settlements, architecture and the life and work of [[Henrietta Barnett]]. The archive consists of records of suburb organisations and recreational societies, education institutions and approximately 10,000 plans and 10,000 photographs.

Among the records of charities are those of the [[Foundling Hospital]], established by Royal charter in 1739 by [[Thomas Coram]] as a refuge for abandoned children. It was the sole institution responsible for taking in illegitimate children in the London area for a period of well over 120 years. Coram had been appalled by the number of dead and dying babies on the streets of London. Admission to the new hospital was at first limited because of lack of funds. Infants were to be less than two months old and in good health. Once a child had been admitted they were baptised and given a new name and boarded out to a dry or wet nurse in the country. On reaching the age of three, they were returned to the hospital to receive basic schooling before eventually being apprenticed out to trades or service or enlisted in the armed forces. From 1760 the mother was required to submit a written petition detailing her circumstances: these documents provide a valuable resource for social history. Other documents include records of the lives of the children, nursing methods, apothecaries' prescriptions, and inspectors' reports. Some parts of the collection have been returned to the Coram family, while more modern files concerned with the [[Berkhamsted]] site are at [[Hertfordshire Archives and Local Studies]].

===City of London Corporation===
[[File:Thomas Canynges, Lord Mayor 1456–1457, in aldermanic robes (c 1450) by Roger Leigh.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Watercolour portrait of [[Thomas Canynges]], [[Lord Mayor of London]] 1456–7, held at LMA]]
The records that were formerly held by the [[City of London Corporation|Corporation of London]] Record Office and now held at the LMA have been re-catalogued and are now arranged in two distinct sections.

Records with the prefix COL are the administrative and corporate records of the [[City of London Corporation]]. Included in this section are the repertories, journals and letter books from the courts of [[Aldermen]] and [[Court of Common Council|Common Council]], records of those receiving the [[freedom of the City of London]] from the Chamberlains department as well as numerous plans from the planning and surveyors departments.

Records with the prefix CLA are deposited collections from organisations and bodies that operate in close association with the City of London Corporation. This series includes records of many of the bridges across the [[Thames]] and particularly [[Tower Bridge]], many markets including [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]], [[Billingsgate]], [[Spitalfields]] and [[Leadenhall]], and a number of courts such as [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]] and Guildhall Justice Rooms and Southwark coroner's court. Records of particular interest in this series are the records of the City of London Sessions, these include criminal trials held before the London jury at the [[Old Bailey]]. Another series of particular interest are the records of the [[City of London Police]]. Archives include warrant books, over 95% of all personnel files as well as material relating to the [[Houndsditch murders]] and letters sent to the force concerning [[Jack the Ripper]] and the [[Whitechapel murders]].

===Court records===

The court records held at LMA are dominated by one of the finest collection of quarter session records known to exist in the country. The records of the [[Middlesex]] and [[City of Westminster|Westminster]] Sessions cover both the judicial and administrative functions of the [[Justices of the Peace]] covering the period 1549–1971. These include sessions of gaol delivery for the Middlesex area, held at the [[Old Bailey]] until 1834. Until the 1870s and 1880s the Middlesex Justices were not only responsible for judicial matters in their area, they were also responsible for many of the functions now under the control of local governments. Such roles and responsibilities included county bridges, prisons, lunatic asylums and [[Feltham Industrial School]]. The deposited records also include Land and Hearth tax assessments, electoral registers, licensed victuallers, recognizance's, building surveyors returns, enclosure awards and maps and plans of numerous public undertakings such as canals, docks and railways.

LMA also holds a number of records of the former Inner London police courts. While many of these courts date from the 18th and 19th centuries, the surviving records often only start in the early 20th century. Included in the same section are records of [[petty sessions]], [[magistrates]]' courts and [[county courts]] for London and Middlesex. Some magistrates' courts in the London area are not covered and hold no records of the Crown Courts. Perhaps the most popular series of records in this section are the records of [[coroner]]'s courts. These include the Middlesex area prior to 1889, the London and Middlesex areas from 1889 onwards and the Greater London area after 1965. Unfortunately the survival rate of coroner's records is only about 10%. They are also subject to a closure period of 75 years as opposed to the 30 years on other court records.

===Diocesan records===

The records of the [[Diocese of London]] have been split between the LMA and the [[Guildhall Library]]. The LMA has records concerning the Consistory Court of London and the Archdeaconry Court of Middlesex. These records include probate material up to 1858, Tithe maps, Bishops Transcripts and Matrimonial and Testamentary Cause Papers.

To the south of the [[River Thames]], LMA holds records of the [[Diocese of Winchester]] including probate and marriage bonds and allegations from the Archdeaconry Court of Surrey as well as probate from the Commissary Court of Surrey. The LMA also has records of the [[Anglican Diocese of Southwark|Diocese of Southwark]], the Diocese of Guilford and the south-east London part of the [[Diocese of Rochester]].

===Families and estates===
Estate records held at the LMA include the [[Duke of Bedford]]'s [[Covent Garden]] Estate with many of the records relating to the development of the market. Other major estate records in this series are those of the [[Marquess of Northampton]] at [[Clerkenwell]] and Canonnbury and the Maryon-Wilson estates in [[Hampstead]] and [[Charlton, London|Charlton]]. Notable family collections include those of the [[Marquess of Anglesey]], the Clitherow family of Brentford and the [[Earl of Jersey]], whose papers include correspondence with prominent politicians and literary figures; however, these papers can only be viewed after obtaining written permission from the Head Archivist. The families and Estates series also includes records of over 80 manors, including those owned by [[Charterhouse School]] and [[St Thomas' Hospital]], which covers land extending from Essex to [[Wiltshire]] and [[Yorkshire]].

===Hospitals and health authorities===
[[File:hanwell asylum.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|right|[[St Bernard's Hospital, Hanwell|London County Asylum]] at Hanwell]]
LMA holds records for over 80 hospitals and local regional health authorities within the south-east area. The hospital records range from county asylums such as [[St Bernard's Hospital, Hanwell|Hanwell Asylum]] and [[Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum]] to major teaching hospitals like [[Guy's Hospital]] and [[St Thomas' Hospital]] and specialist hospitals like [[Moorfields Eye Hospital]] and Queen Charlotte's Hospital, right down to much smaller local hospitals. Anybody wishing to find out what hospital records are held at the LMA would do well to first consult the hospital records database on the national archives website. The collection of records is not arranged alphabetically as many different hospitals may be covered by one particular management trust, therefore it is worth asking at the reference room desk and they will direct you to the particular binder that you need. It is also worth consulting the 3 leaflets on hospital records that the archive had produced, namely No. 9 – Sources for the history of nursing, which details the [[Florence Nightingale]] collection among the records of [[St Thomas' Hospital]] – No. 13, a general guide to hospital records, and No. 15, which is concerned with patients' records. All patients' records among the hospitals collections are subject to data protection laws and may be closed access depending on their date.

===Jewish organisations===

A great number of the Anglo-Jewish community's archives have been deposited at the London Metropolitan Archives, including records of the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]], the Office of the Chief Rabbi, the [[Beth Din]], the federation of Synagogues and the [[United Synagogue]]. It should be noted that the collections contain only a small number of sources useful to those studying their Jewish Family History, particular sources are the records from the Jewish Temporary Shelter and those of the Jewish Free School which is said to have educated one third of all the Jewish community in London. The majority of records from the various Jewish Organisations are concerned with subject and policy decisions and most require written permission from the depositor before access can be granted.

===London local authorities===

Two very important series of records have been classified under the heading London Local Authorities. The first of these, are the records of the [[Boards of Guardians]] of the [[Poor Law Unions]] for London and [[Middlesex]]. Poor Law Unions were formed as a result of the new [[English Poor Laws|Poor Law]] amendment act of 1834, when neighbouring parishes joined together to pool their resources, each of these unions would be administered by a Board of Guardians. The records consist primarily of general minutes of the board, administrative records including details of staff, settlement examinations, orders of removal, [[workhouse]] and [[wikt:infirmary|infirmary]] records and school records. The records are arranged by each individual board although the amount of surviving material varies from board to board. The majority of material is from the period 1850 to 1930.

The other major collection in this series, are the records of the Middlesex Deeds Register. By  the [[Middlesex Registry Act 1708]] a registry was established for the registration of all [[deed]]s, [[Conveyancing|conveyances]], [[Will (law)|wills]], [[encumbrance]]s etc., affecting freehold land and leased land for periods of 21 years or more, within the ancient county of Middlesex. In 1862 the national land register was introduced on a voluntary basis. In 1899 it became compulsory for land in the new area of North London that was formally Middlesex to be registered nationally. This dramatically reduced the amount of entries to the Middlesex Deeds Register, though it continued to serve the outer part of Middlesex until 1938 when all land within Middlesex had to be registered through the national land register. Deeds and documents brought to the registry were copied onto pieces of parchment called memorials and then bound into large volumes or registers. The documents are not complete copies of the originals and certain information such as covenants and other restrictions may be missing. Information entered includes date of the transaction, names of the parties and a description of the property. From the mid-19th century this also often included a plan of the property.

===London-wide elected bodies===
As well as the archives of the [[London County Council]], [[Middlesex County Council]], [[Greater London Council]], [[Inner London Education Authority]] and the [[London Residuary Body]], the LMA also hold records of their 19th- and 20th-century predecessors such as the [[Metropolitan Board of Works]], [[Metropolitan Commission of Sewers]], [[London School Board]] and the [[Metropolitan Asylums Board]]. The records of these bodies are as broad as the functions of modern local government, with documentation on education, housing, health services, welfare, transport, building regulations, drainage, culture and leisure. Many of the different bodies include a series of indexed committee minutes, which often prove to be a valuable starting point when attempting to access the records.

===Maps===

The LMA has an extensive collection of maps numbering over 15,000. Many of the maps are split up amongst the various different collections for example tithes maps found amongst the diocesan records and enclosure maps found amongst court records. Fortunately there is a single card catalogue that combines all of the maps from the various collections and has listed them by the area they cover. Twenty of the most popular maps held by the LMA are accessible in the map cabinet in the reference room. These include the first edition of the [[Ordnance Survey]] for London 1867–70 and the Second World War Bomb damage maps.

===National records===

Included in this series are records of the [[British Waterways Board]] particularly concerning the [[River Lea]], plans of National Schools in Middlesex and the London Region of [[English Heritage]] that took over many of the files and plans of the former [[Greater London Council]] Historic Buildings Division. Also featuring in the series of National Records are the archives of [[Wandsworth (HM Prison)]] and [[Wormwood Scrubs (HM Prison)]]. Of the two prisons the Wandsworth records are much more extensive, including administrative and staff records, photographs and prisoners records from 1879. For Wormwood Scrubs the majority of records concern prisoners and begin in 1917.

===Non-established religions===
The majority of [[nonconformist]] records at LMA relate to the [[Congregationalist]], [[Baptist]], United Reformed and [[Methodist]] churches, circuits and missions dating predominantly from the 19th and 20th centuries. Some records of a few German churches are held, and some recent marriage registers from a [[Salvation Army]] citadel, a [[Seventh-Day Adventist]] church, the [[Kingdom Hall]], Wandsworth and a [[Sikh]] [[Gurdwara]]. As well as [[baptism]], marriage and [[burial]] records from individual nonconformist churches, records of several nonconformist organisations such as the London Congregational Union and the New Bunhill Fields Burial Ground are held. The LMA holds no [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] records, which are usually retained by the individual church.

===Parishes===

LMA holds records of more than 700 [[Anglican]] churches in the London and [[Middlesex]] areas. The types of records held vary from [[parish]] to [[parish]], with some parishes only depositing registers of [[baptisms]], marriage and [[burials]]. Other parishes, however, have deposited a great deal more and the types of records include [[vestry]] minutes, [[churchwarden]] accounts, parish [[poor rate]] and early [[workhouse]] material, parish magazines, plans, photographs and other ephemera.

For those interested in parish records, researchers should be aware that for certain areas of London, the LMA will not be the likely place records would be deposited. For those interested in the parish registers of the ancient City of London within the walls, these will be found at the Guildhall Library. Similarly churches within the ancient city of Westminster will deposit their records at the City of Westminster Archives. This will include parishes such as [[St Martin in the Fields (parish)|Saint Martin in the Fields]], Saint James Piccadilly, [[St Clement Danes (parish)|Saint Clement Danes]] and Saint George Hanover Square. The final areas that would not deposit their records at the LMA are the modern London Boroughs that prior to the formation of the Greater London Council in 1964 would have been part of the former counties of Essex, Kent and Surrey. For each of these areas researchers should consult either their local borough archive or the respective ancient county record office.

===Photograph collection===
[[File:Boundary Street 1890.jpg|thumb|right|[[Boundary Estate|Boundary Street]], [[Shoreditch]], photographed in 1890, shortly before it was redeveloped in a slum clearance scheme: from the LMA collections]]
The LMA photograph collection contains almost half a million photographs covering the history and topography of London, especially the inner London area. The majority of photos were taken for official purposes by and for the London County Council and Greater London Council. The collection is arranged in two sections. The first section is arranged by alphabetically by subject covering everything from Abbeys to Zoological Gardens. Particularly well covered are subjects such as schools, housing estates, parks, bridges, churches, cinemas, theatres, hospitals, pubs and areas of war damage. The second section is arranged alphabetically by modern London borough and then alphabetically by address.

===Prints and drawings===

The prints and drawings collection is similarly arranged to the photograph collection, with a greater focus on the inner London areas. It is also arranged both topographically and by subject. Most of the prints and drawings date from the 18th and 19th centuries.

===Video===
The LMA holds many films produced by bodies including London Transport, the Greater London Council and the Corporation of London. Some of these films are accessible on YouTube.

==The library==
The LMA library started as the library of the former members of the London County council. It contains over 100,000 volumes and specialises in all aspects of London life, the growth and development of the area, its history and organisation of Local Government. The library is purely a reference library. A search of the archive's stock of records can be done online by accessing the LMA website and navigating the londonGenerations search tool.

Although many records (in particular the parish registers of Greater London) are stored on microfiche, there is a digitisation programme which is ongoing. The aim is to digitally store parish records, Poor Law documents, and school admission records up to 1911. An estimated 77 million people will be referenced by these documents.

It will be possible for visitors to view this data at no cost on terminals in the library. It will likewise be possible to view this data at home via the internet for a fee, via the website ancestry co uk, with the first stage going live in early 2009.

According to a leaflet from the LMA (made available in September 2008):

:It is anticipated that the full digitisation and indexing programme will include: Parish baptisms, marriages and burials; Bishops' transcripts; Parish Poor Law records; Boards of Guardians records; Diocesan marriage bonds and allegations; Non-conformist baptisms, marriages and burials; School admission and discharge registers; Electoral registers, overseers returns and poll books; Land Tax records; Wills; City of London Freedoms; Middlesex Sessions - Transportation Contracts; Consistory Court of London Matrimonial and Testamentary Papers.

Digitised parish records went online on 16 September 2009, as an alternative to microfiche searches. Digitised electoral rolls, for the period 1835 to 1965, went online on 11 January 2012.

'''MARTa Herford''' is a contemporary art museum in [[Herford]], [[Germany]].

== Building and history ==

The idea for the museum formed in 2000, drawing from Herford's status as a German center of furniture and home furnishing production.&lt;ref name="marta-herford1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marta-herford.de/index.php/4619-2/?lang=en |title=MARTa Herford: Idea &amp; Concept |publisher=Marta-herford.de |date=2005-05-07 |accessdate=2013-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''MARTa'' is an acronym for ''Möbel'' ([[German language|German]] for ''furniture''), ''ART'' (simply ''art'' in English), and ''Ambiente'' (ambience).&lt;ref name="mff"&gt;{{cite book |title=Frank Gehry MARTa Herford |year=2005 |publisher=Birkhäuser |location=Basel |isbn=978-3764371623 |&lt;!-- accessdate=August 12, 2012 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding director of the museum was [[Jan Hoet]], a noted Belgian curator. {{Interlanguage link multi|Roland Nachtigäller|de}} took over as director in 2009.

The building was designed by [[Frank Gehry]] and built by [[Archimedes GmbH]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=MARTa Freunde und Förderer (Editor) |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/3764371625 |title=Frank Gehry MARTa Herford (German and English Edition): MARTa Freunde und Förderer: 9783764371623: Amazon.com: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date=2005-05-06 |accessdate=2013-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction began in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcspace.com/architects/gehry/herford/index.html |accessdate=August 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315164222/http://www.arcspace.com/architects/gehry/herford/index.html |archivedate=March 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it officially opened to the public on May 7, 2005.&lt;ref name="marta-herford1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3817">The '''Massachusetts Body of Liberties''' was the first legal code established by European colonists in [[New England]]. Compiled by the [[Puritan]] minister [[Nathaniel Ward]], the laws were established by the [[Massachusetts General Court]] in 1641. The Body of Liberties begins by establishing the exclusive right of the General Court to legislate and dictate the "Countenance of Authority".

In 1684 [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] revoked the Body of Liberties and reinstated English law over the Commonwealth. When [[James II of England|King James II]] established the [[Massachusetts Colony]] the Body of Liberties took effect{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} and remained so until it was replaced by the 1691 [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Provincial Charter]].&lt;ref name="EACL"&gt;Encyclopedia of American civil liberties, Volume 1, Ed. Paul Finkelman, entry written by Sherrow Pinder, CRC Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-415-94342-6}}, page 979.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rights acknowledged by the Body of Liberties==
The Body of Liberties was one of the earliest protections of [[individual rights]] in America.&lt;ref name="Bernard"&gt;Bernard Schwartz, ''The great rights of mankind: a history of the American Bill of Rights'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1992, 0945612281, page 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many of the English sources of the time, the Body of Liberties were express in many of their grants and far more supportive of individual rights.&lt;ref name="Bernard" /&gt; Despite these grants, the rights were modifiable by the General Court.

To varying degrees, the document contained rights that would later be included in the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]. Many of the other rights are now considered fundamental components of [[procedural due process]], such as rights to notice and hearing before the court. The rights also contained in the Bill of Rights included [[freedom of speech]], a right against [[Takings clause|uncompensated takings]], a [[Bail#United States|right to bail]], a [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|right to jury trial]], a [[Eighth Amendment's Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause|right against cruel and unusual punishment]], and a right against [[double jeopardy]].&lt;ref name="Bernard" /&gt;

In addition to those, the Body of Liberties also contained other individual rights, including: a prohibition of a compulsory [[conscription|draft]] except for territorial defense; a prohibition of [[monopolies]], "No monopolies shall be granted or allowed amongst us, but of such new Inventions that are profitable to the Countrie, and that for a short time."; &lt;!-- The quote is from the original, do not change the spelling to modern spelling --&gt;prohibition of an [[estate tax]]; the freedom of all "house holders" to fishing and fowling on public land.

Some of the liberties legislated are explicitly cited as originating from biblical sources. While many of the liberties established still exist in both and law and practice in the Commonwealth today, some do not. The justification for slavery of Africans in Passage 91 of the Body of Liberties was likely based on an interpretation of scriptural passages of the [[New Testament]], such as Ephesians 6:5 and Titus 2:9. Liberties were only extended to Caucasian Northern Europeans, particularly [[protestant Christian]] men.

'''''Mills vs. Board of Education of District of Columbia''''', 348 F.Supp. 866 (D.D.C. 1972), was a lawsuit filed against the [[District of Columbia]] in the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]]. The court ruled that students with disabilities must be given a [[public education]] even if the students are unable to pay for the cost of the education.&lt;ref&gt;''Mills vs. Board of Education of District of Columbia'', 348 F.Supp. 866, 877-78 (D.D.C. 1972).&lt;/ref&gt; The case established that "all children are entitled to free public education and training appropriate to their learning capacities".&lt;ref&gt;Henry A. Beyer, ''A Free Appropriate Public Education'', 5 {{smallcaps|W. New Eng. L. Rev.}} 363, 365 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; Peter D. Roos, a former staff attorney at Harvard University's Center for Law and Education, described ''Mills'' as a "leading case" in a series of lawsuits that attempted to provide access to education for children with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Peter D. Roos, The Potential Impact of Rodriguez on Other School Reform Litigation, 38 {{smallcaps|Law &amp; Contemp. Probs.}} 566, 572 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

Children were denied education because they were classified as having behavioral issues. The board of education did not provide schooling for these exceptional children, which violated their own board regulations. 18,000 similar cases were discovered in the Washington D.C. area. It had failed to provide prior hearings and periodic reviews of each exceptional student case. The Supreme Court of the United States stated that the board of education of the district of Columbia violated such rights as due process and certain statutes and regulations. The court claimed that the board of education had an obligation to provide education for all students, regardless of disability. By not providing equal protection and education for all students under law, the education system is stripping students of their natural rights, and therefore having a large impact on civil liberties in the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1019">The '''muroni''' (or murony) is a [[vampire]] in [[Wallachia]]n [[mythology]].  It has the ability to transform into a variety of different animals.  Due to this characteristic, a muroni attack could be very hard to identify and could often be thought of as an animal attack.  The only sign that a muroni was there at all was an exceptional amount of blood loss.&lt;ref name="Timothy_Jay_Forder"&gt;Forder, Timothy Jay (2010). "Vampire Owners Manual", p. 172-173.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the muroni was often thought to be a vampire, it can also be considered a [[shapeshifter]], as it would take on the appearance of animals.  The muroni is one of many vampire legends which was believed to be a blood-sucking ghost in reality, only taking on the form of other beings to make feeding easier.&lt;ref name="David_Patrick"&gt;Patrick, David (1888). "Chamber's Encyclopedia: A Dictionary of Universal Knowledge", p. 708.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Museumpark''' is an [[urban park]] in [[Rotterdam]], [[Netherlands]], located between the [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]], [[Westersingel]], [[Westzeedijk]] and the complex of the [[Erasmus MC]], a medical centre affiliated with the [[Erasmus University]].

The park lies on the former land of the Hoboken family, who lived in the building that is now the [[Natuurhistorisch Museum Rotterdam]]. The park was laid out in 1927 to the design of the architect Witteveen. On the south side of the pond in the park a monument for Gerrit Jongh, director of municipal works in Rotterdam. There are several [[work of art|artwork]]s in the park, so it also serves as a [[sculpture garden]].

There are a number of museums located in the vicinity of the park, hence the name:

* The [[Netherlands Architecture Institute]] (NAi)
* [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]]
* The [[Chabot Museum]]
* The [[Kunsthal]]
* [[Villa Sonneveld]]
* [[Natuurhistorisch Museum Rotterdam]]

The '''National Zoological Park''', commonly known as the '''National Zoo''', is one of the oldest [[zoo|zoos]] in the United States. It is part of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and does not charge for admission. Founded in 1889, its mission is to "provide engaging experiences with animals and create and share knowledge to save wildlife and habitats".&lt;ref name="zoo_mission"&gt;{{cite web

The National Zoo has two campuses. The first is a {{Convert|163|acre|adj=on}} urban park located at [[Rock Creek Park]] in [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|Northwest]] [[Washington, D.C.]], 20 minutes from the National Mall by MetroRail.&lt;ref name="zoo_getting_there"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Visit/GettingToZoo/metro.cfm |title=By MetroRail |work=nationalzoo.si.edu |publisher=National Zoological Park |accessdate=May 25, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601195936/http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Visit/GettingToZoo/metro.cfm |archivedate=June 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other campus is the {{Convert|3200|acre|adj=on}} [[Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute]] (SCBI; formerly known as the Conservation and Research Center) in [[Front Royal, Virginia]]. On this land, there are 180 species of trees, 850 species of woody shrubs and herbaceous plants, 40 species of grasses, and 36 different species of bamboo.&lt;ref name="nationalzoo.si.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Publications/PressMaterials/PressKit/FactsFigs.cfm|title=National Zoo Facts and Figures|work=si.edu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820231633/http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Publications/PressMaterials/PressKit/FactsFigs.cfm|archivedate=August 20, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SCBI is a non-public facility devoted to training wildlife professionals in [[conservation biology]] and to propagating rare species through natural means and assisted reproduction. The National Zoo is accredited by the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] (AZA).

The two facilities host about 1,800 animals of 300 different species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalzoo.si.edu/AboutUs/History/|title=History of the National Zoo – National Zoo- FONZ|work=si.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; About one-fifth of them are endangered or threatened.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best-known residents are the [[giant panda]]s, but the zoo is also home to [[bird]]s, [[Hominidae|great apes]], [[big cat]]s, [[Asian elephant]]s, [[insect]]s, [[amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[aquatic animal]]s, small [[mammal]]s and many more. The SCBI facility houses between 30 and 40 endangered species at any given time depending on research needs and recommendations from the zoo and the conservation community.&lt;ref name="crc_historical"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The zoo was one of the first to establish a scientific research program.&lt;ref name="nationalzoo.si.edu" /&gt; Because it is a part of the Smithsonian Institution, the National Zoo receives federal appropriations for operating expenses. A new master plan for the park was introduced in 2008 to upgrade the park's exhibits and layout.

The National Zoo is open every day of the year except for December 25 ([[Christmas Day]]).

== History ==
[[File:Annual report of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution (1897) (18431191142).jpg|thumb|right|alt=a bridge over a calm stream|Bridge at National Zoological Park, 1897]]
The zoo first started as the National Museum's Department of Living Animals in 1886.&lt;ref name="siarchives.si.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/pictures/national-zoological-park |title=National Zoological Park |work=Smithsonian Institution Archives |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111025911/http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/pictures/national-zoological-park |archivedate=November 11, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By an [[act of Congress]] in 1889, for "the advancement of science and the instruction and recreation of the people" the National Zoo was created. In 1890, it became a part of the Smithsonian Institution. Three well-known individuals drew up plans for the zoo: [[Samuel Langley]], third Secretary of the Smithsonian; [[William T. Hornaday]], noted conservationist and head of the Smithsonian's vertebrate division; and [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], the premier landscape architect of his day. William Temple Hornaday was the curator of all 185 animals when the park was first opened.&lt;ref name="siarchives.si.edu" /&gt; Together, they designed a new zoo to exhibit animals for the public and to serve as a refuge for wildlife, such as bison and beaver, which were rapidly vanishing from North America.&lt;ref name="zoo_history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nationalzoo.si.edu/AboutUs/History |title=History |work=nationalzoo.si.edu |publisher=National Zoological Park |accessdate=May 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zoo washington dc 20041011 120025 1.1504x1000.jpg|thumb|right|alt=a broad tree-lined promenade|Olmsted Walk, near the zoo's Elephant House]]
[[File:Elephant feeding circa 1915 National Zoo Washington DC.jpg|thumb|Elephant fed by a zoo attendant through the bars of a fence at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., circa 1915|right|alt=Elephant being fed]]
For the first 50 years, the National Zoo, like most zoos around the world, focused on exhibiting one or two representative exotic animal species. The number of many species in the wild began to decline drastically because of human activities. Sometimes animals became unexpectedly available. In 1899, the [[Kansas]] frontiersman [[Charles "Buffalo" Jones]] captured a [[bighorn sheep]] for the zoo.&lt;ref name="msu" /&gt; The fate of animals and plants became a pressing concern. Many of these species were favorite zoo animals, such as elephants and tigers; hence the staff began to concentrate on the long-term management and conservation of entire species.&lt;ref name="zoo_history" /&gt;

In the mid-1950s, the zoo hired its first full-time permanent [[veterinarian]], reflecting a priority placed on professional health care for the animals. In 1958, Friends of the National Zoo (FONZ) was founded. The citizen group's first accomplishment was to persuade Congress to fund the zoo's budget entirely through the Smithsonian; previously, the zoo's budget was divided between appropriations for the Smithsonian and the District of Columbia. Congressional funding placed the zoo on a firmer financial base, allowing for a period of growth and improvement. In 2006, Congress approved an additional 14.6 million dollars for renovations in both facilities.&lt;ref name="nationalzoo.si.edu" /&gt; FONZ incorporated as a nonprofit organization and turned its attention to developing education and volunteer programs, supporting these efforts from its operation of concessions at the zoo, and expanding community support for the zoo through a growing membership&lt;ref name="zoo_history" /&gt; which annually raises between $4 million and $8 million for the zoo.&lt;ref name="nationalzoo.si.edu" /&gt;

In the early 1960s, the zoo turned its attention to breeding and studying threatened and endangered species. Although some zoo animals had been breeding and raising young, it was not understood why some species did so successfully while others did not. In 1965, the zoo created the zoological research division to study the reproduction, behavior, and ecology of zoo species, and to learn how best to meet the needs of the animals.&lt;ref name="zoo_history" /&gt;

In 1975, the zoo established the Conservation and Research Center (CRC). In 2010, the complex was renamed the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI), a title also used as an umbrella term for the scientific endeavors that take place on both campuses. On {{convert|3200|acre|km2}} in the Virginia countryside, rare species, such as [[Mongolian wild horse]]s, [[scimitar-horned oryx]], [[maned wolf|maned wolves]], [[Crane (bird)|crane]]s, and others live and breed in spacious surroundings. SCBI's modern efforts emphasize reproductive physiology, analysis of habitat and species relationships, genetics, husbandry and the training of conservation scientists.&lt;ref name="zoo_history" /&gt;

The zoo's last [[hippopotamus]], [[Happy (hippopotamus)|Happy]], was transferred to [[Milwaukee County Zoo]] in 2009 to make space for Elephant Trails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/11/AR2009111115683.html|title=For Happy the hippo, moving from Washington to Milwaukee has been a pleasure|first=Michael E.|last=Ruane|date=November 12, 2009|accessdate=July 10, 2018|website=Washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern status==
Expanding knowledge about the needs of zoo animals and commitment to their well being has changed the look of the National Zoo. Today, animals live in natural groupings rather than individually. Rare and endangered species, such as [[golden lion tamarin]]s, [[Sumatran tiger]]s, and [[sarus crane]]s, breed and raise their young – showing the success of the zoo's conservation and research programs.&lt;ref name="zoo_history" /&gt; The zoo's research team studies animals both in the wild and at the zoo. Its research encompasses reproductive biology, conservation biology, biodiversity monitoring, veterinary medicine, nutrition, behavior, ecology, and bird migration.&lt;ref name="nationalzoo.si.edu" /&gt;

The National Zoo has developed public-education programs to help students, teachers and families explore the intricacies of the animal world. The zoo also designed specialized programs to train wildlife professionals from around the world and to form a network to provide crucial support for international conservation. The National Zoo is at the forefront of the use of web technology and programming to expand its programs to an international virtual audience.&lt;ref name="zoo_history" /&gt;

The National Zoo has been the home to [[giant panda]]s since [[Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing]] arrived at the zoo in 1972. Since 2000, [[Mei Xiang]] and [[Tian Tian (male giant panda)|Tian Tian]] also lived there. On July 9, 2005, Mei Xiang gave birth to [[Tai Shan (giant panda)|Tai Shan]], who went to China in February 2010. On August 23, 2013, Mei Xiang gave birth to [[Bao Bao]], who still resides at the zoo.{{update after|2017|09|01|reason=Bao Bao scheduled to be sent to China when she is 4.}} On August 22, 2015, Mei Xiang gave birth to Bei Bei, who still resides at the zoo.&lt;ref name="zoo_history" /&gt;

Plans for the future include modernizing the zoo's aging facilities and expanding its education, research and conservation efforts in Washington, Virginia and in the wild. As part of a 10-year renewal program, Asia Trail – a series of habitats for seven Asian species including [[sloth bear]]s, [[red panda]]s, and [[clouded leopard]]s – was created. Elephant Trails, opened in 2013, provides a new home for the zoo's Asian elephants. Kids' Farm exhibit, opened in 2004, was slated for closure in 2011 but is to remain open for another 10 years following a donation to the exhibit.&lt;ref name="zoo_history" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pandas2020" /&gt;

The zoo, which is supported by tax revenues and open to everyone, attracts 2 million visitors per year, according to the ''[[Washington Post]]'' in 2005.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

The National Zoo has a Federal Law Enforcement Agency deployed on its grounds: the [[Smithsonian Police|National Zoological Park Police]] (NZPP), which consists of full-time Law Enforcement Officers. The NZPP is an agency that has been recognized by the United States Congress and is one of five original police agencies within the District of Columbia with full police powers. They work very closely with the Metropolitan Police Department, the United States Park Police, Department of State, Capital Police, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Defense. The agency is considered the first line of defense in the event of any crisis.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Dennis W. Kelly was named director of the zoo on February 15, 2010, overseeing both campuses.  Kelly succeeded [[John Berry (administrator)|John Berry]], who was the National Zoo director for three years until February 2009, when he resigned to become the director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management under the Obama Administration. Steven Monfort, the zoo's associate director for conservation and science, served as the acting director between February 2009 and February 2010. Kelly retired as the zoo's director in November 2017, Steven Monfort was named acting director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalzoo.si.edu/news/leadership-change-smithsonians-national-zoo-and-conservation-biology-institute|title=Leadership Change at Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute|website=Smithsonian's National Zoo|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibits ==

=== Giant Panda Habitat ===
[[File:Giant Panda at the zoo.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Panda in recline holding a blue milk crate|Tian Tian at the National Zoo]]
The zoo's [[giant panda|Giant Panda]] Habitat features three outdoor areas with [[animal enrichment]], as well as an indoor area with a rocky outcrop, a waterfall, and viewing areas. The zoo's pandas, named Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, are on loan from the China Wildlife Conservation Association, and will live at the zoo until 2020.&lt;ref name="Pandas2020"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/news/city-desk/blog/13070157/pandas-will-live-in-d-c-until-at-least-2020|title=Pandas Will Live in D.C. Until (At Least) 2020|newspaper=Washington City Paper|access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the focus of a research, conservation, and breeding program that aims to preserve the species. Mei Xiang and Tian Tian successfully had a male cub, named [[Tai Shan (giant panda)|Tai Shan]], in 2005. Tai Shan currently lives at the [[Bifengxia Panda Base]] in [[Sichuan]], China, taking part in Bifengxia's breeding program. On September 16, 2012, Mei Xiang gave birth to another cub, but the cub died six days after its birth. On August 23, 2013, Mei Xiang gave birth to two cubs; one, a female named [[Bao Bao]], survived, while the other was stillborn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-08-23/local/41439243_1_tai-shan-mei-xiang-healthy-cub | work=The Washington Post | first1=Stefanie E. | last1=Dazio | first2=Michael E. | last2=Ruane | title=Panda cub born to Mei Xiang at National Zoo | date=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pandas live at the Fujifilm Giant Panda Habitat, a state-of-the-art indoor and outdoor exhibit.

=== Asia Trail ===
A group of Asia-themed exhibits opened in 2006. Along with the giant pandas, the area also displays [[sloth bear]]s, [[fishing cat]]s, [[red panda]]s, a [[clouded leopard]], [[Asian  small-clawed otter]]s, and [[Asian elephant]]s. Next to the pandas is an exhibit for [[Japanese giant salamander]]. However, in mid-2016, the salamander died and the exhibit space is currently unoccupied;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalzoo.si.edu/news/japanese-giant-salamander-dies-smithsonians-national-zoo|title=Japanese Giant Salamander Dies at the Smithsonian's National Zoo|website=Smithsonian's National Zoo|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the zoo keeps members of the species off-exhibit in the reptile house.

=== Elephant Trails ===
[[File:Asian Elephant at the zoo.jpg|thumb|alt=elephant in an enclosure|Asian elephant at the National Zoo]]
In spring 2008, the National Zoo began construction on Elephant Trails, a new home for its 7 [[Asian elephant]]s. The first part of the $52 million project opened in September 2010, expanding the zoo's former elephant area with a {{Convert|5700|sqft|adj=on}} barn, two new yards (one with a pool), and a quarter-mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) walkway through woods,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/02/AR2010090205526.html|title=National Zoo debuts new, larger home for elephants|first=Michael E.|last=Ruane|work=washingtonpost.com|publisher=The Washington Post|date=September 3, 2010|accessdate=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a total of {{Convert|1.9|acre}} of outdoor space, bringing the total size of Elephant Trails to 2 acres (0.81 ha).&lt;ref name="elephant_trails" /&gt; Elephant Trails: A Campaign to Save Asian Elephants is a comprehensive breeding, education, and scientific research program.

[[File:Uncle Beazley - Paint job - Stierch.jpg|thumb|left|alt=a ''Triceratops'' statue on outdoor display|''Uncle Beazley'' near Lemur Island]]
''[[Uncle Beazley]]'', a fiberglass ''[[Triceratops]]'' that [[Louis Paul Jonas]] created for the DinoLand pavilion at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]], can now be seen near the island. The life-size statue, which had been located on the [[National Mall]] near the [[National Museum of Natural History]] until 1994, is named for a [[dinosaur]] in the 1956 children's book, ''The Enormous Egg'', by [[Oliver Butterworth]] and in the book's 1968 television movie adaptation, in which the statue appeared.&lt;ref&gt;(1)  {{cite book|first=James M.|last=Goode|title=Uncle Beazley|work=The Outdoor Sculpture of Washington, D.C.: A Comprehensive Historical Guide|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|year=1974|page=260|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nXLqAAAAMAAJ|isbn=9780881032338|oclc=2610663|accessdate=2016-07-04|quote=This 25-foot long replica of a ''[[Triceratops]]'' ... was placed on the [[National Mall|Mall]] in 1967. ...&lt;br/&gt;The full-size ''Triceratops'' replica and eight other types of dinosaurs were designed by two prominent paleontologists, Dr. [[Barnum Brown]] of the [[American Museum of Natural History]], in New York City, and Dr. [[John Ostrom]] of the Peabody Museum, in Peabody, Massachusetts. The sculptor, [[Louis Paul Jonas]], executed these prehistoric animals in fiberglass, after the designs of Barnum and Ostrom, for the Sinclair Refining Company's Pavilion at the [[1964 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair of 1964]].  After the Fair closed, the nine dinosaurs, which weighed between 2 and 4 tons each, were placed on trucks and taken on a tour of the eastern United States.  The [[Sinclair Oil Corporation|Sinclair Refining Company]] promoted the tour for public relations and advertising purposes, since their trademark was the dinosaur.  In 1967, the nine dinosaurs were given to various American museums.&lt;br/&gt;This particular replica was used for the filming of ''The Enormous Egg'', a movie made by the [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]] for television, based on a children's book of the same name by [[Oliver Butterworth]].

Despite not being mammals, two [[Von der Decken's hornbill]]s and a male [[green aracari]] can be found in the building.

=== The American Trail ===
The American Trail exhibit houses a variety of North American species. These include five [[California sea lion]]s, four [[grey seal]]s, one [[harbor seal]], three [[North American beaver]]s, two [[North American River Otter]]s, two [[bald eagle]]s, two [[common raven]]s, three [[brown pelican]]s, and two [[Grey wolf|grey wolves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/exhibits/american-trail|title=American Trail|website=Smithsonian's National Zoo|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After facing severe threats, the majority of American Trail species have rebounded thanks to conservation efforts. Many of the residents of American Trail have been listed as endangered. All of plants in the animal enclosures on American Trail exhibit are native to North America. 

The exhibit also features a cafe called Seal Rock Cafe, which offers dishes crafted from local, seasonal, and sustainable ingredients.  Menu items include [[Best Aquaculture Practices]] (BAP) certified shrimp and [[Marine Stewardship Council]] (MSC) certified fish.&lt;ref name="American Trail"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Newest Exhibit Area at the Smithsonian's National Zoo|url=http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Animals/AmericanTrail/exhibit.cfm|publisher=Smithsonian's National Zoo|accessdate=25 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225014853/http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Animals/AmericanTrail/exhibit.cfm|archivedate=February 25, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Trail was recently renovated and reopened in late summer 2012.

=== The Great Ape House ===
[[File:Gorilla at the zoo.jpg|thumb|alt=a gorilla on hands and feet, facing left|Gorilla at the National Zoo]]
The Great Ape House is separated into two sets of enclosures. One houses seven [[bornean orangutan]]s (two males named Kiko and Kyle; four females named Lucy, Batang, Iris and Bonnie; and a male infant named Redd, born in 2016). The other houses seven [[western lowland gorilla]]s (four males named Baraka, Kojo, Kwame and Moke; As well as three females named Mandara, Kibibi and Calaya). The orangutans are allowed access to the Think Tank (see below) by travelling along the "O-Line", a series of high cables supported by metal towers that enable the orangutans to move between the two buildings. Kyle, Batang and Redd are [[Bornean orangutan]]s and Kiko, Lucy, Iris and Bonnie are all hybrid orangutans.

=== The Think Tank ===
[[File:DCZooOline.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=orangutans crossing lines between towers, high above a promenade|Two orangutans crossing over visitors via the "O Line"]]
The Think Tank is an area designed to educate visitors about how animals think and learn about their surroundings. The Think Tank features several interactive displays that teach visitors how zoologists conduct their studies. The zoo's orangutans (which are sometimes used in keeper demonstrations) are allowed to move from the Great Ape House to the Think Tank, and the building includes suitable enclosures for the apes should they choose to stay there. Other animals kept and studied in The Think Tank include [[brown rat]]s, [[land hermit crab]]s, 4 [[Allen's swamp monkey]]s and 3 [[red-tailed monkey]]s. The zoo once had a population of [[Celebes crested macaque]]s living in an outdoor cage.

=== Gibbon Ridge ===
Gibbon Ridge is an enclosure housing two different species of gibbon: two [[Northern white-cheeked gibbon]]s (a male named Sydney and female named Tuyen), and two [[siamang]] (a male named Bradley and a female named Ronnie).

=== Great Cats on Lion and Tiger Hill ===
Great Cats is separated into three enclosures. The zoo rotates [[lion|African lions]], two [[Sumatran tiger]]s (a female named Damai and a male named Sparky) and a male [[Amur Tiger]] named Pavel between the three exhibits.

One of the zoo's tigers, Soyono, was [[euthanized]] in November 2012. She was 19 years old, which is close to the limits of her life span. The tiger looked to be suffering from [[spondylosis]], a degenerative spinal disorder, which afflicts big cats as they get older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=National Zoo mourns loss of Soyono, Sumatran tiger|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/national-zoo-mourns-loss-of-soyono-sumatran-tiger/2012/11/24/f9e1aa8e-3694-11e2-9cfa-e41bac906cc9_story.html?Post+generic=%3Ftid%3Dsm_twitter_washingtonpost|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=26 November 2012|first=Martin|last=Weil|date=November 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 24, 2014, the zoo's 10-year-old female lion, Nababiep, gave birth to three cubs in an eight-hour period. Two of the cubs survived, and were the first lion cub litter born at the zoo in four years, the third for Nababiep, and the fourth for the eight-year-old father, Luke. The birth followed the birth of two rare Sumatran tiger cubs to mother Damai on August 5, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Animals/GreatCats/|title=Great Cat Exhibit – National Zoo|work=si.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also two (currently indefinitely unoccupied) exhibits for [[bobcat]]s and [[caracal]]s.

This is an outdoor exhibit designed to mimic the African savanna and educate visitors about [[cheetah]]s and what is being done to preserve them in the wild. The main part of the Cheetah Conservation Station consists of two enclosures separated by a fence. One enclosures houses four [[South African cheetah]]s (both males; Justin/Gat [named for [[Justin Gatlin]]], Bakari, Donnie and Copley), while the other houses one male [[Grevy's zebra]] named Moyo. Other animals on display in the area include two [[scimitar-horned oryx]]s, four [[dama gazelle]]s, two [[Rüppell's vulture]]s, one [[sitatunga]], three [[red river hog]]s, two male [[Maned wolf|maned wolves]] named Mateo and Quito (a species native to South America), an [[Abyssinian ground hornbill]] and three [[lesser kudu]]. A female [[tammar wallaby]] named Maji had been on display until December 2013, when she was euthanized at the very old age of 18 (most do not live beyond 10).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/exhibits/cheetah-conservation-station|title=Cheetah Conservation Station|website=Smithsonian's National Zoo|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable animals ==
=== Smokey Bear ===
{{Main article|Smokey Bear}}
[[File:SmokeyBear1.jpg|thumb|right|alt=bear reclined in pool|Smokey Bear playing in his pool, sometime in the 1950s.]]

One of the most famous animals to have spent much of his life at the zoo was [[Hotfoot Teddy|Smokey Bear]], the "living symbol" of the cartoon icon created as part of a campaign to prevent forest fires. A black bear cub rescued from a fire, he lived at the zoo from 1950 until his death in 1976. During his time at the zoo, he had millions of visitors and an abundance of personal mail addressed to him – up to 13,000 letters a week – such that the U.S. Post Office designated a special zip code for correspondence addressed to him.&lt;ref name="BP"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time at the zoo, he was "married" to Goldie Bear, with the hope that one of his offspring would continue to hold the title of Smokey Bear.  When the pair produced no offspring, an orphaned bear cub was added to their cage. It was named "Little Smokey", with the announcement that the bear couple had "adopted" the new cub. In 1975, an official ceremony was held to recognize the retirement of Smokey Bear and the new title of "Smokey Bear II" for Little Smokey.&lt;ref name="BP" /&gt;  Upon the death of the original Smokey Bear, ''The Washington Post'' printed an obituary, recognizing him as a "New Mexico native" who had resided in Washington, D.C. for many years, working for the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== Giant pandas ===
[[File:Panda National Zoo.jpg|thumb|alt=a panda feeding on shoots|Tai Shan at the National Zoo]]
Coming off the heels of President [[Richard Nixon]]'s historic [[1972 Nixon visit to China|1972 visit to China]], the Chinese government donated two [[giant panda]]s, [[Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing|Ling-Ling (female) and Hsing-Hsing (male)]], to the official United States delegation. First Lady [[Pat Nixon]] donated the pandas to the zoo, where she welcomed them in an April 1972 ceremony. The first giant pandas in America, Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing were among the most popular animals at the zoo.&lt;ref name="nixon"&gt;{{cite web

A new pair of pandas, female [[Mei Xiang]] ("Beautiful Fragrance") and male [[Tian Tian (male giant panda)|Tian Tian]] ("More and More"), arrived on loan from the Chinese government in late 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The zoo paid an estimated 10 million dollars for the 10-year loan. On July 9, 2005, a male panda cub was born at the zoo. It was the first surviving panda birth at the zoo and the product of [[artificial insemination]] by the zoo's reproductive research team. The cub was named [[Tai Shan (panda)|Tai Shan]] ("[[Mount Tai|Peaceful Mountain]]") on October 17, 100 days after his birth; the panda went without a name for its first hundred days, in observance of a Chinese [[convention (norm)|custom]]. Tai Shan is property of the Chinese government and was scheduled to be sent to China after his second birthday, although that deadline was extended in 2007 by two years. Tai Shan left Washington, D.C., on February 4, 2010, and was taken to the Ya'an [[Bifengxia Panda Base]], part of the Wolong nature reserve's panda conservation center.

On September 16, 2012, Mei Xiang gave birth to another cub, believed by zoo officials to have been a female, which died after about a week. Initial results from a [[necropsy]] (animal autopsy) revealed the abnormal presence of fluid in the abdomen and also discoloration of the liver (hepatic) tissue of unknown etiology; the cub had managed to nurse before death because milk was found in its system. Zoo officials said that, while upsetting, they (and, by extension, the public) can hope to learn more about giant panda breeding, reproduction, and health as a result, and will work closely and cooperatively with their Chinese colleagues during the inquiry.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In January 2011, Dennis Kelly, director of the National Zoo, and Zang Chunlin, secretary general of the China Wildlife Conservation Association, signed a new Giant Panda Cooperative Research and Breeding Agreement, extending the zoo's giant panda program for five more years, further cementing the two countries' commitment to the conservation of the species. The new agreement, effective through December 5, 2015, stipulates that the zoo will conduct research in the areas of breeding and cub behavior.{{update inline|date=July 2017|reason=Presumably the agreement has been renewed/extended again, as it expired in 2015.}}

In the summer of 2013, Mei Xiang gave birth to a live female panda cub (Tian Tian is the father; a second cub was stillborn), named [[Bao Bao]] ("treasure" or "precious"; decided through a naming contest) on the 100th day of her existence. {{As of|2014|January|18|df=US|post=,}} Bao Bao is on public exhibit and drawing crowds, greatly increasing zoo attendance and on-line views via PandaCam.

Mei Xiang gave birth in August 2015 to two live cubs; the smaller one died a few days later (keepers had to care for it after Mei decided to focus on the larger cub). Sperm from both Tian Tian and another male giant panda based in a China preserve was used. It was determined on August 28, 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nationalzoo.si.edu/publications/pressmaterials/pressreleases/press-release.cfm?id=2714 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023081826/http://nationalzoo.si.edu/publications/pressmaterials/pressreleases/press-release.cfm?id=2714 |archivedate=October 23, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; that both cubs were male and sired by Tian Tian.

In celebration of a state visit, the name was selected by First Lady of the United States, Michelle Obama, and First Lady of the People's Republic of China, Peng Liyuan.

Bao Bao was healthy at that time, eating bamboo and special fruitsicle treats, having been separated from Mei at 18 months of age. She celebrated her second birthday in August 2015, shortly after the cubs were born. Her contract extended to August 2017. Bao Bao left the National zoo on February 22, 2017 for the Dujiangyan base of the China Panda Conservation and Research Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-12/27/c_136854836.htm|title=Keeper's diary: Bao Bao's challenge after her return from America |website=Xinhuanet.com|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute}}
The Smithsonian established its Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) in 2010 to serve as an umbrella for its global effort to conserve species and train future generations of conservationists. Headquartered in [[Front Royal, Virginia]], the facility was previously known as the National Zoo's Conservation and Research Center.&lt;ref name="scbi_main"&gt;{{cite web

|title=Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute
|work=nationalzoo.si.edu
|publisher=National Zoological Park
|accessdate=May 25, 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SCBI facilitates and promotes research programs based at Front Royal, at the National Zoo in Washington and at field research and training sites around the world. Its efforts support one of the four main goals of the Smithsonian's new strategic plan, which advances "understanding and sustaining a biodiverse planet."&lt;ref name="scbi_main" /&gt;

[[Conservation biology]] is a field of science based on the premise that the conservation of biological diversity is important and benefits current and future human societies.&lt;ref name="scbi_main" /&gt;

The Institute consists of six centers:&lt;ref name="scbi_main" /&gt;

* Conservation Ecology Center (CEC): focuses on recovering and sustaining at-risk wildlife species and their supporting ecosystems in key marine and terrestrial regions throughout the globe.
* [[Migratory Bird Center]]: studies neotropical songbirds and wetland birds, the role of disease in bird population declines, and the environmental challenges facing urban and suburban birds. They also train professionals in environmental coffee certification throughout Latin America.
* Center for Species Survival (CSS): researches issues in reproductive physiology, endocrinology, cryobiology, embryo biology, animal behavior, wildlife toxicology and assisted reproduction. They strive to create knowledge that ensures self-sustaining populations in zoos and in the wild.
* Center for Conservation and Evolutionary Genetics (CCEG): works to understand and conserve biodiversity through genetic research, specializing in the genetic management of wild and captive animal populations, non-invasive and ancient DNA analyses, systematics, disease diagnosis and dynamics, genetic services to the zoo community, and application of genetic methods to animal behavior and ecology.
* Center for Conservation Education and Sustainability (CBES): teaches conservation principles and practices, finding ways to help scientists, managers, companies and industries become more environmentally responsible.
* Center for Wildlife Health and Husbandry Sciences: provides for the mental and physical well-being of every animal at the zoo through the complex endeavor of animal care.

The committee found that most animals were well cared-for, and there was little to question regarding large mammal deaths from 1999 to 2003.  Their evaluation suggested "that the publicized animal deaths were not indicative of a wider, undiscovered problem with animal care".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|quote=In total, the committee evaluated 74% of all megavertebrate deaths that occurred at the National Zoo from 1999 to 2003. The committee concluded that in a majority of cases, the animal received appropriate care throughout its lifetime. In particular, the committee’s evaluation of randomly sampled megavertebrate deaths at the Rock Creek Park facility revealed few questions about the appropriateness of these animals’ care, suggesting that the publicized animal deaths were not indicative of a wider, undiscovered problem with animal care at the Rock Creek Park facility.

[[Image:Zh pharmacopoeia 2.JPG|thumb|220px|right|Back cover of the ''Chinese Pharmacopoeia'' (first edition; published in 1930)]]

A '''pharmacopoeia''', '''pharmacopeia''', or '''pharmacopoea''' (literally, “drug-making”), in its modern technical sense, is a book containing directions for the identification of compound [[medicine]]s, and published by the authority of a government or a medical or [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical]] society.

Descriptions of preparations are called [[monograph]]s. In a broader sense it is a [[reference work]] for [[Specification#Food and drug specifications|pharmaceutical drug specifications]].

==Etymology==
The term derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] φαρμακοποιΐα ''pharmakopoiia'' "making of (healing) medicine, drug-making", a compound of φάρμακον ''pharmakon'' "healing medicine, drug, poison", the verb ποιεῖν ''poiein'' "to make" and the abstract noun suffix [[wikt:-ία|-ία]] ''-ia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|pharmacopeia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|fa/rmakon|φάρμακον}}, {{LSJ|poie/w|ποιεῖν|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early modern editions of [[Latin]] texts, the Greek [[diphthong]] οι (''oi'') is latinized to its Latin equivalent ''oe''  which is in turn written with the [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] ''œ'', giving the spelling ''pharmacopœia''; in modern [[British English|UK English]], ''œ'' is written as ''oe'', giving  the spelling ''pharmacopoeia'', while in American English ''oe'' becomes ''e'', giving us ''pharmacopeia''.

==History==
Although older writings exist which deal with herbal medicine, the major initial works in the field are considered to be the [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]] in [[Egypt]], [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]’s pharmacopoeia&lt;ref name="pmid18604277"&gt;{{cite journal |author=van Tellingen C |title=Pliny's pharmacopoeia or the Roman treat |journal=Netherlands heart journal |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=118–20 |date=March 2007 |pmid=18604277 |pmc=2442893 |doi= 10.1007/BF03085966|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[De Materia Medica]]'' (Περὶ ὕλης ἰατρικῆς), a five-volume book originally written in Greek by [[Pedanius Dioscorides]]. The latter is considered to be precursor to all modern pharmacopoeias, and is one of the most influential herbal books in history. In fact it remained in use until about CE 1600.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medhunters.com/articles/timelyinePedaniusDioscorides.html|title=Welcome to CareerBrochure.com|work=medhunters.com|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of early pharmacopoeia books were written by [[Islamic medicine|Persian and Arab physicians]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Khuri Hitti|Philip K. Hitti]] (cf. Kasem Ajram (1992), ''Miracle of Islamic Science'', Appendix&amp;nbsp;B, Knowledge House Publishers. {{ISBN|0-911119-43-4}}).&lt;/ref&gt; These included ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'' of [[Avicenna]] in 1025, and works by [[Ibn Zuhr]] (Avenzoar) in the 12th century (and printed in 1491),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Krek | first1 = M. | year = 1979 | title = The Enigma of the First Arabic Book Printed from Movable Type | url =http://www.ghazali.org/articles/jnes-38-3-mk.pdf | format=PDF | journal = Journal of Near Eastern Studies | volume = 38 | issue = 3| pages = 203–212 | doi=10.1086/372742}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ibn al-Baitar|Ibn Baytar]] in the 14th century.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The [[Shennong Ben Cao Jing|Shen-nung pen ts'ao ching]] (Divine Husbandman's Materia Medica) is the earliest known Chinese pharmacopia. The text describes 365 medicines derived from plants animals and minerals; according to legend it was written by the Chinese god [[Shennong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/chinesemedicine/emperors.html|title=Classics of Traditional Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===City pharmacopoeia origins===
The first known work of this kind published under civic authority appears to have been that of [[Tang Dynasty]] in China. The treatise was written by several officials of [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang]]. The pharmacopoeia contained 850 sorts of [[crude medicine]], revising the treatises written by ancient Chinese pharmacists.

However, the first dated work appeared in [[Nuremberg]] in 1542; a passing student named [[Valerius Cordus]] showed a collection of medical prescriptions, which he had selected from the writings of the most eminent medical authorities, to the physicians of the town, who urged him to print it for the benefit of the apothecaries, and obtained for his work the sanction of the [[senatus]]. A work known as the ''Antidotarium Florentinum'', was published under the authority of the college of medicine of [[Florence]] in the 16th century. In 1511, the ''Concordie Apothecariorum Barchinone'' was published by the Society of Apothecaries of [[Barcelona]] and kept in the School of [[Pharmacy]] of the [[University of Barcelona]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ub.edu/museuvirtual/exposiciovirtual.php?id=7&amp;ap=1&amp;idGal=5#1|title=Museu Virtual - Universitat de Barcelona|author=|date=|website=www.ub.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The term ''Pharmacopoeia'' first appears as a distinct title in a work&lt;ref name="Basel1561"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foes|first1=A|title=Pharmacopœia medicamentorum omnium, quæ hodie ... officinis extant, etc.|date=1561|location=Basel}}&lt;/ref&gt; published at [[Basel]], Switzerland, in 1561 by A. Foes, but does not appear to have come into general use until the beginning of the 17th century.

Before 1542 the works principally used by apothecaries were the treatises on simples by [[Avicenna]] and [[Serapion the Younger|Serapion]]; the ''De synonymis'' and ''Quid pro quo'' of [[Simon Januensis]]; the ''Liber servitoris'' of [[Bulchasim Ben Aberazerim]], which described the preparations made from plants, animals, and minerals, and was the type of the chemical portion of modern pharmacopoeias; and the ''Antidotarium'' of [[Nicolaus de Salerno]], containing [[Galenic formulation]]s arranged alphabetically. Of this last work, there were two editions in use &amp;mdash; Nicolaus magnus and Nicolaus parvus: in the latter, several of the compounds described in the large edition were omitted and the formulae given on a smaller scale.

Also  [[Vesalius]] claimed he had written  some "''dispensariums''" and "''manuals''" on the works of [[Galenus]]. Apparently he burnt them. According to  recent research communicated at the congresses of the  [[International Society for the History of Medicine]] by the scholar Francisco Javier González Echeverría,&lt;ref&gt;[http://michaelservetusresearch.com/ENGLISH/works.html Michael Servetus Research] Website with graphical study on the pharmacopoeia Dispensarium by Servetus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1998 "The 'Dispensarium' or 'Enquiridion' the complementary work of the Dioscorides, both by Servetus" and "The book of work of Michael Servetus for his Dioscorides and his 'Dispensarium'".

Michel De Villeneuve, fellow student of [[Vesalius]] and the best [[galen]]ist of Paris according to [[Johann Winter von Andernach]],&lt;ref&gt;2011 "The love for truth.

Riddle]], one of the foremost experts on [[Materia Medica]]-[[Dioscorides]] works.

[[Nicolaes Tulp]], mayor of [[Amsterdam]] and respected surgeon general, gathered all of his doctor and chemist friends together and they wrote the first pharmacopoeia of Amsterdam in 1636 ''Pharmacopoea Amstelredamensis''. This was a combined effort to improve public health after an outbreak of the plague, and also limit the number of quack apothecary shops in Amsterdam.

====London====
Until 1617 such drugs and medicines as were in common use were sold in [[England]] by the [[Apothecary|apothecaries]] and grocers. In that year the apothecaries obtained a separate charter, and it was enacted that no grocer should keep an apothecary’s shop. The preparation of physicians’ prescriptions was thus confined to the apothecaries, upon whom pressure was brought to bear to make them dispense accurately, by the issue of a pharmacopoeia in May 1618 by the [[Royal College of Physicians|College of Physicians]], and by the power which the wardens of the apothecaries received in common with the censors of the College of Physicians of examining the shops of apothecaries within 7&amp;nbsp;m. of London and destroying all the compounds which they found unfaithfully prepared. This, the first authorized [[London]] Pharmacopoeia, was selected chiefly from the works of Mezue and Nicolaus de Salerno, but it was found to be so full of errors that the whole edition was cancelled, and a fresh edition was published in the following December.

At this period the compounds employed in medicine were often heterogeneous mixtures, some of which contained from 20 to 70, or more, ingredients, while a large number of simples were used in consequence of the same substance being supposed to possess different qualities according to the source from which it was derived. Thus crabs’ eyes (i.e., [[gastrolith]]s), pearls, oyster shells, and [[Coral#Relation to humans|coral]] were supposed to have different properties. Among other ingredients entering into some of these formulae were the excrements of human beings, dogs, mice, geese, and other animals, [[Calculus (medicine)|calculi]], human skull, and moss growing on it, blind puppies, [[earthworm]]s, etc.

Although other editions of the London Pharmacopoeia were issued in 1621, 1632, 1639, and 1677, it was not until the edition of 1721, published under the auspices of Sir [[Hans Sloane]], that any important alterations were made. In this issue many of the remedies previously in use were omitted, although a good number were still retained, such as dogs’ excrement, earthworms, and [[moss]] from the human skull; the botanical names of herbal remedies were for the first time added to the official ones; the simple distilled waters were ordered of a uniform strength; sweetened spirits, [[Cordial (medicine)|cordial]]s and [[ratafia]]s were omitted as well as several compounds no longer used in London, although still in vogue elsewhere. A great improvement was effected in the edition published in 1746, in which only those preparations were retained which had received the approval of the majority of the pharmacopoeia committee; to these was added a list of those drugs only which were supposed to be the most efficacious. An attempt was made to simplify further the older formulae by the rejection of superfluous ingredients.

In the edition published in 1788 the tendency to simplify was carried out to a much greater extent, and the extremely compound medicines which had formed the principal remedies of physicians for 2,000 years were discarded, while a few powerful drugs which had been considered too dangerous to be included in the Pharmacopoeia of 1765 were restored to their previous position. In 1809 the French chemical nomenclature was adopted, and in 1815 a corrected impression of the same was issued. Subsequent editions were published in 1824, 1836, and 1851.

The first Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia was published in 1699 and the last in 1841; the first Dublin Pharmacopoeia in 1807 and the last in 1850.

===National pharmacopoeia origins===
The preparations contained in these three pharmacopoeias were not all uniform in strength, a source of much inconvenience and danger to the public, when powerful preparations such as dilute hydrocyanic acid were ordered in the one country and dispensed according to the national pharmacopoeia in another. As a result, the [[Medical Act of 1858]] ordained that the [[General Medical Council]] should publish a book containing a list of medicines and compounds, to be called the ''[[British Pharmacopoeia]]'', which would be a substitute throughout Great Britain and Ireland for the separate pharmacopoeias. Hitherto these had been published in Latin. The first British Pharmacopoeia was published in the English language in 1864, but gave such general dissatisfaction both to the medical profession and to chemists and druggists that the General Medical Council brought out a new and amended edition in 1867. This dissatisfaction was probably owing partly to the fact that the majority of the compilers of the work were not engaged in the practice of pharmacy, and therefore competent rather to decide upon the kind of preparations required than upon the method of their manufacture. The necessity for this element in the construction of a pharmacopoeia is now fully recognized in other countries, in most of which pharmaceutical chemists are represented on the committee for the preparation of the legally recognized manuals.

There are national and international pharmacopoeias, like the EU and the U.S. pharmacopoeias. The pharmacopeia in the EU is prepared by a governmental organization, and has a specified role in law in the EU. In the U.S., the USP-NF (United States Pharmacopeia – National Formulary) has been issued by a private non-profit organization since 1820 under the authority of a Convention that meets periodically that is largely constituted by physicians, pharmacists, and other public health professionals, setting standards published in the compendia through various Expert Committees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usp.org/about-usp/our-impact&lt;/ref&gt;  In the U.S. when there is an applicable USP-NF quality monograph, drugs and drug ingredients must conform to the compendial requirements (such as for strength, quality or purity) or be deemed adulterated or misbranded under the Federal food and drug laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usp.org/about-usp/legal-recognition|title=USP in Food and Drug Law - U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention|work=usp.org|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supranational and international harmonization===
The [[Soviet Union]] had a nominally supranational pharmacopoeia, the State Pharmacopoeia of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSRP), although the [[de facto]] nature of the nationality of republics within that state differed from the [[de jure]] nature. The [[European Union]] has a supranational pharmacopoeia, the [[European Pharmacopoeia]]; it has not replaced the national pharmacopoeias of EU member states but rather helps to harmonize them. Attempts have been made by international pharmaceutical and medical conferences to settle a basis on which a globally international pharmacopoeia could be prepared, but regulatory complexity and locoregional variation in conditions of pharmacy are hurdles to fully harmonizing across all countries (that is, defining thousands of details that can all be known to work successfully in all places). Nonetheless, some progress has been made under the banner of the [[International Council on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use]] (ICH),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ich.org|title=ICH Official web site : ICH|work=ich.org|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a tri-regional organisation that represents the drug regulatory authorities of the [[European Medicines Agency|European Union]], [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Japan]], and the [[Food and Drug Administration|United States]]. Representatives from the Pharmacopoeias of these three regions have met twice yearly since 1990 in the Pharmacopoeial Discussion Group to try to work towards "compendial harmonisation". Specific monographs are proposed, and if accepted, proceed through stages of review and consultation leading to adoption of a common monograph that provides a common set of tests and specifications for a specific material. Not surprisingly, this is a slow process. The [[World Health Organization]] has produced the [[The International Pharmacopoeia|International Pharmacopoeia]] (Ph.Int.), which does not replace a national pharmacopoeia but rather provides a model or template for one and also can be invoked by legislation within a country to serve as that country's regulation.

==Medical preparations, uses, and dosages==

{{Globalize/UK|section|date=March 2012}}
Though formerly printed there has been a transition to a situation where pharmaceutical information is available as printed volumes and on the [[internet]]. The rapid increase in knowledge renders necessary frequent new editions, to furnish definite formulae for preparations that have already come into extensive use in medical practice, so as to ensure uniformity of strength, and to give the characters and tests by which their purity and potency may be determined. However each new edition requires several years to carry out numerous experiments for devising suitable formulae, so that current pharmacopoeia are never quite up to date.

This difficulty has hitherto been met by the publication of such non official formularies as ''Squire's Companion to the Pharmacopoeia'' and ''[[Martindale: The complete drug reference]]'' (formerly ''Martindale's: the extra pharmacopoeia''), in which all new remedies and their preparations, uses and doses are recorded, and in the former the varying strengths of the same preparations in the different pharmacopoeias are also compared (Squire's was incorporated into Martindale in 1952). The need of such works to supplement the Pharmacopoeia is shown by the fact that they are even more largely used than the Pharmacopoeia itself, the first issued in 18 editions and the second in 13 editions at comparatively short intervals. In the UK, the task of elaborating a new Pharmacopoeia is entrusted to a body of a purely medical character, and legally the pharmacist does not, contrary to the practice in other countries, have a voice in the matter. This is notwithstanding the fact that, although the medical practitioner is naturally the best judge of the drug or preparations that will afford the best therapeutic result, they are not as competent as the pharmacist to say how that preparation can be produced in the most effective and satisfactory manner, nor how the purity of drugs can be tested.

The change occurred with the fourth edition of the British Pharmacopoeia in 1898. A committee of the [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain]] was appointed at the request of the [[General Medical Council]] to advise on pharmaceutical matters. A census of prescriptions was taken to ascertain the relative frequency with which different preparations and drugs were used in prescriptions, and suggestions and criticisms were sought from various medical and pharmaceutical bodies across the [[British Empire]]. As regards the purely pharmaceutical part of the work a committee of reference in pharmacy, nominated by the pharmaceutical societies of Great Britain and Ireland (as they were then), was appointed to report to the Pharmacopoeia Committee of the Medical Council.

Some difficulty has arisen since the passing of the Adulteration of Food and Drugs Act{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} concerning the use of the Pharmacopoeia as a legal standard for the drugs and preparations contained in it. The Pharmacopoeia is defined in the preface as only "intended to afford to the members of the medical profession and those engaged in the preparation of medicines throughout the British Empire one uniform standard and guide whereby the nature and composition of, substances to be used in medicine may be ascertained and determined". It cannot be an encyclopaedia of substances used in medicine, and can be used only as a standard for the substances and preparations contained in it, and for no others. It has been held in the Divisional Courts (Dickins v. Randerson) that the Pharmacopoeia is a standard for official preparations asked for under their pharmacopoeial name. But there are many substances in the Pharmacopoeia which are not only employed in medicine, but have other uses, such as [[sulfur|sulphur]], [[gum benzoin]], [[tragacanth]], [[gum arabic]], [[ammonium carbonate]], [[beeswax]], oil of [[turpentine]], [[linseed oil]], and for these a commercial standard of purity as distinct from a medicinal one is needed, since the preparations used in medicine should be of the highest possible degree of purity obtainable, and this standard would be too high and too expensive for ordinary purposes. The use of trade synonyms in the Pharmacopoeia, such as saltpetre for purified [[potassium nitrate]], and milk of sulphur for precipitated sulphur, is partly answerable for this difficulty, and has proved to be a mistake, since it affords ground for legal prosecution if a chemist sells a drug of ordinary commercial purity for trade purposes, instead of the purified preparation which is official in the Pharmacopoeia for medicinal use. This would not be the case if the trade synonym were omitted. For many drugs and chemicals not in the Pharmacopoeia there is no standard of purity that can be used under the Adulteration of Food and Drugs Act, and for these, as well as for the commercial quality of those drugs and essential oils which are also in the Pharmacopoeia, a legal standard of commercial purity is much needed. This subject formed the basis of discussion at several meetings of the Pharmaceutical Society, and the results have been embodied in a work called ''Suggested Standards for Foods and Drugs'' by C.&amp;nbsp;G. Moor, which indicates the average degree of purity of many drugs and chemicals used in the arts, as well as the highest degree of purity obtainable in commerce of those used in medicine.

An important step has also been taken in this direction by the publication under the authority of the Council of the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain of the [[British Pharmaceutical Codex]] (BPC), in which the characters of and tests for the purity of many unofficial drugs and preparations are given as well as the character of many glandular preparations and antitoxins that have come into use in medicine, but have not yet been introduced into the Pharmacopoeia. This work may also possibly serve as a standard under the Adulteration of Food and Drugs Act for the purity and strength of drugs not included in the Pharmacopoeia and as a standard for the commercial grade of purity of those in the Pharmacopoeia which are used for non-medical purposes.

Another legal difficulty connected with modern pharmacopoeias is the inclusion in some of them of synthetic chemical remedies, the processes for preparing which have been patented, whilst the substances are sold under trade-mark names. The scientific chemical name is often long and unwieldy, and the physician prefers when writing a [[medical prescription|prescription]] to use the shorter name under which it is sold by the [[patent]]ees. In this case the pharmacist is compelled to use the more expensive patented article, which may lead to complaints from the patient. If the physician were to use the same article under its pharmacopoeial name when the patented article is prescribed, they would become open to prosecution by the patentee for infringement of patent rights. Hence the only solution is for the physician to use the chemical name (which cannot be patented) as given in the Pharmacopoeia, or, for those synthetic remedies not included in the Pharmacopoeia, the scientific and chemical name given in the British Pharmaceutical Codex.

==List of national and supranational pharmacopoeias ==
In most of the [[New Latin]] names, ''Pharmacopoea'' is the more common spelling, although for several of them, ''Pharmacopoeia'' is common.

The '''Phillips Library''' of the [[Peabody Essex Museum]] is a rare books and [[special collections]] library in the [[Essex Institute Historic District]] of [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Massachusetts]]. It "is made up of the collections of the former [[Peabody Museum of Salem]] and [[Essex Institute]], which merged in 1992. Both had libraries named for members of the Phillips family."&lt;ref&gt;Boston Globe, May 24, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prior to 1992, the Essex Institute operated the "James Duncan Phillips Library" cf. Boston Globe, Oct 11, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; The Phillips Library reading room is in Plummer Hall on Essex Street, with offices in the connected [[John Tucker Daland House]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pem.org/library/information&lt;/ref&gt;

Plummer Hall was originally built for the [[Salem Athenaeum]] in 1857.  The Athenaeum provided for space for the Essex Institute and several other groups, and sold the building to the Essex Institute in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ashton |first=Joseph |date=1917 |title=The Salem Athenaeum 1810-1910 |publisher=The Berkeley Press |pages=24–31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reading room underwent restoration in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Boston Globe, May 24, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Both buildings closed in November 2011 for an extensive renovation. The Phillips Library Reading Room reopened in August 2013 at its temporary location at 1 Second Street, Peabody, MA.&lt;ref name="PEM website"&gt;[http://pem.org/library Phillips Library at PEM].

{{POV section|date=January 2018}}On December 8, 2017, much to the dismay of Salem residents, Dan L. Monroe, PEM’s Rose-Marie and Eijk van Otterloo, director and CEO, issued a press release announcing that the 42,000 linear feet of historical documents will be permanently relocated to [[Rowley, Massachusetts]], and that Plummer Hall and Daland House, the two historic buildings which had housed the Phillips Library, will be utilized as office and meeting space.&lt;ref name=PEMPR&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pem.org/press-news/statement-regarding-pems-phillips-library|title=Statement Regarding PEM Phillips Library |publisher=Peabody Essex Museum|accessdate=2017-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__TOC__
The announcement of the planned movement of the Salem documents collection to the town of Rowley—located about {{convert|17|mi}} north of the Peabody-Essex Museum—has sparked protests by historians and interested Salem citizens who don’t accept that unique documents regarding Salem’s history should reside outside the city. However, the move to Rowley allows the PEM to "provide the highest standards of preservation, care, and protection for the Library collection along with expanded Conservation, Photography, Digitization studios, staff offices, and a very handsome new Reading Room."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pem.org/index.php?p=visit/library|title=pem.org {{!}} Library|last=Inc.|first=The Outfit,|date=2018-10-26|website=pem.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Posen speeches''' were two secret speeches made by [[Heinrich Himmler]], the head of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], on 4 and 6 October 1943 in the [[Poznań Town Hall|town hall]] of [[Poznań|Posen]] ({{lang-pl|Poznań}}), in [[Nazi Germany|German]]-[[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|occupied]] [[Poland]]. The recordings are the first known documents in which a high-ranking German [[Hitler Cabinet|member of the Nazi government]] spoke of the ongoing [[genocide|extermination]] of the [[Jews]] in [[extermination camp]]s. They demonstrate that the German government wanted, planned and carried out [[the Holocaust]].

==Overview==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S72707, Heinrich Himmler.jpg|thumb|Heinrich Himmler]]
The Posen speeches of October 1943 are two of 132 speeches obtained in various forms, which Himmler conducted before officials of the Nazi party.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Peterson: ''Heinrich Himmler Geheimreden'', Speech index, pp. 268–277 f.&lt;/ref&gt; The first speech was given before 92 SS officers, the second before [[Reichsleiter]]s and [[Gauleiter]]s, as well as other government representatives.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Breitman]]: ''Heinrich Himmler. Der Architekt der "Endlösung".'' Pendo Verlag, Zürich et al 2000, {{ISBN|3-85842-378-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; They constitute some of the most important of Himmler's speeches during the war, as they demonstrate Himmler's role as "Architect of the Final Solution" and a visionary of an elite race to be henceforth supported by the SS state.&lt;ref&gt;Joachim Fest, Einführung zu Smith, Peterson: ''Heinrich Himmler Geheimreden'', p. 15 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the genocide of the Jews was not the central topic in either of them, both carry historical significance in reference to it. Himmler did away with the usual camouflage terms&lt;ref&gt;Raul Hilberg: ''Die Quellen des Holocaust'', Frankfurt/Main 2002, {{ISBN|3-10-033626-7}}, Kapitel ''Drastische und verschleiernde Sprache'' p. 123ff&lt;/ref&gt; and spoke explicitly of the extermination of the Jews via mass murder, which he depicted as a historical mission of the Nazis. This connection became clear in five further speeches made between December 1943 and June 1944 to commanders of the Wehrmacht.&lt;ref&gt;Original transcript – see literature&lt;/ref&gt;

In the literature, only the first speech was known as the "Posen Speech" until 1970. The second speech, uncovered at that time, is often mistaken as the first or equated with it.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Historical context==
Himmler gave the speeches at a time when German military setbacks were mounting and the Nazi political and military leadership were privately expressing alarm. At the [[Casablanca Conference]] in January, 1943, the Allies had decided that the only acceptable outcome of the war was Germany's unconditional surrender. The Soviet victory in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] on 2 February 1943 was a turning point in the war. US President Franklin D. Roosevelt announced the prosecution of those mainly responsible for war and genocide on 12 February, which the US Congress agreed to on 18 March. US and British troops landed on [[Sicily]] on 7 July 1943 and [[Allied invasion of Italy|successfully invaded the Italian mainland on the 3 September]], and after the [[Italian armistice]] on 8 September, gradually advanced northward. On 1 October, [[Naples]] was freed from German occupation.

German hopes of regaining the military initiative on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern front]] were dashed by the failure of the [[Battle of Kursk]] in early July, and the resultant massive Soviet counter offensive ushered in permanent German retreats for the remainder of the war. In the week 27 July – 3 August 1943, Allied air raids attacked Hamburg in [[Bombing of Hamburg in World War II|Operation Gomorrah]], and the armament centre of [[Peenemünde]] was heavily damaged by [[Operation Hydra (1943)|Operation Hydra]] on the night of 17-18 August, critically disrupting [[V-weapons]] development. At the same time resistance against German forces in the Western occupied territories grew, and a state of emergency was declared in [[Norway]] (17 August) and [[Denmark]] (29 August). Nazi dissidents planned Germany's reorganisation (the [[Kreisau Circle]]) and assassination attempts on [[Adolf Hitler]] (which led to "[[Operation Walküre]]", 20 July 1944). A [[scorched earth]] policy was brought in on 4 September for retreats on the Eastern Front, and martial law against those in the armed forces who refused to follow orders, initially introduced by the [[General Government]] on 2 October.&lt;ref name=wf&gt;{{cite book |title=Himmler: The Evil Genius of the Third Reich |author=Willi Frischauer |publisher=Unmaterial Books |year=2013 |ISBN=1783012544 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=4ygXAgAAQBAJ&amp;q=Himmler+%2B+Posen#v=snippet&amp;q=Himmler%20%2B%20Posen&amp;f=false}} Also in: {{cite book |title=Perspectives on the Holocaust: essays in honor of Raul Hilberg |authors=James S.

In the same period, the destruction of the Jews became the most important goal.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Longerich: Der ungeschriebene Befehl, Munich 2001, pp. 175–184.&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1943, [[Sonderaktion 1005]] was in full operation, the exhumation and incineration of those murdered by the [[Einsatzgruppen]] across the whole Eastern Front, whose death toll had so far reached 1.8 million Jews. Himmler ordered the liquidation of all Jewish ghettos in German occupied Poland on 11 June, and all Soviet ones on 21 June. As of 25 June, four new crematoria and [[gas chamber]] installations were completed in Auschwitz-II Birkenau at [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. On 1 July all Jews in the Reich were placed under police law. On 24 August Himmler was appointed as minister of the interior, and thus all police forces in the Reich and occupied territories were subordinated to him. By 19 October, [[Operation Reinhard]] was to be terminated and the affiliated extermination camps dismantled.

Nonetheless, acts of resistance against the destruction of the Jews occurred. There were prisoner rebellions in [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]] (2 August 1943,) and [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibor]] (14 October 1943). Jews of the [[Białystok]] ghetto mounted an [[Białystok Ghetto Uprising|insurrection]] against their liquidation (16–23 August), and the Danes [[Rescue of the Danish Jews|helped most of the Danish Jews]] planned for arrest to escape.

==Speech of 4 October 1943==
Himmler did not prepare most of his speeches beforehand, but used terse handwritten notes instead. Since the end of 1942 his verbal lectures were no longer documented in shorthand, but recorded via [[phonograph]] onto [[gramophone record|wax master plates]]. These recordings were then typed up by SS-''[[Untersturmführer]]'' Werner Alfred Wenn, who corrected obvious grammatical errors and supplemented missing words. Himmler then added his own handwritten corrections, and the thus authorised version was copied up via typewriter in large characters and then filed away.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Peterson: ''Heinrich Himmler'', p. 251 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of Himmler's three-hour speech of 4 October 1943, 115 pages of the final typewritten edition (one page was lost) were discovered among SS files and submitted to the [[Nuremberg Trials]] as document 1919-PS.&lt;ref&gt;IMT Volume 29, p. 110-173&lt;/ref&gt; On day 23 of the hearing, a passage (which however did not concern the Holocaust) was read out.&lt;ref&gt;IMT: Band 4 (Verhandlungsniederschriften, December 1945), p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; A live recording of this speech survives, allowing for the differences between the spoken and the copyedited version to be examined. They are minor, and in no case distortionary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holocaust-history.org/himmler-poznan/speech-text.shtml|title=Text of Himmler's Speech, 4 October 1943|publisher=[[The Holocaust History Project]]|accessdate=2009-01-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212053624/http://www.holocaust-history.org/himmler-poznan/speech-text.shtml|archivedate=12 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Addressees, reason and purpose===
[[File:Stary Rynek w Poznaniu 1934.jpg|thumb|Posen's town hall, where the conference took place (the building no longer exists today)]]

Himmler gave the first speech in the town hall, and not in the [[Imperial Castle in Poznań|imperial palace]] as is often erroneously assumed.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Schwendemann, Wolfgang Dietsche: ''Hitlers Schloß. Die 'Führerresidenz' in Posen'', Berlin 2003, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Of the SS's leadership cadre, 33 [[Obergruppenführer]]s, 51 [[Gruppenführer]]s and eight [[Brigadeführer]]s from the whole of the Reich were present. Many of these came from areas of occupied eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.3sat.de/3sat.php?http://www.3sat.de/specials/24688/index.html|title=Anwesende SS-Generäle bei der "Posener Rede"|date=2 November 2001|publisher=[[3sat]]|language=German|accessdate=2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large parts of the speech therefore concerned the increasingly precarious situation on the Eastern Front, while attempting to explain Soviet military successes as being due to a claimed combination of Communist ruthlessness and the weaknesses of Germany's allies.

Only about two minutes of the speech concerns the destruction of the Jews. Himmler postulates his audience's experiences with mass shootings, ghetto liquidations and extermination camps, and accordingly, their knowledge of them. The speech is to justify the crimes already perpetrated, and to commit its listeners to the "higher purpose" bestowed upon them. Around 50 officers not present were sent a copy of the speech and had to confirm their acknowledgment of it.

===On the course of war===
After a tribute to the war dead, Himmler gave his view of the war so far. The tough Soviet resistance could be attributed to the [[political commissar]]s, the German Invasion of the Soviet Union was a [[preemptive strike]] and due to failure by Germany's allies, a chance for victory in 1942 was wasted. Himmler speculated over the Soviet army's potential, spoke disparagingly of the "[[Andrey Vlasov|Vlasov]] shivaree" (''der Wlassow-Rummel''), expatiated on the inferiority of the Slavic race, and included thoughts as to how a German minority can prevail over it.&lt;ref name=wf/&gt;

In later passages, Himmler claimed Italy's army had been contaminated with [[communism]] and was                                                           sympathetic to the [[Western allies]]. He also touches upon the situation in the Balkans and other occupied territories, whose acts of resistance he disregards as irritating pinpricks. The war in the air and sea is also mentioned, as well as the [[home front|domestic front]] (''die innere Front'') and factors from it such as [[Feindsender|enemy radio broadcasters]] and [[defeatism]] stemming from air raids.

Subsequently, Himmler turns to the situation on the enemy's side, speculating over the relationship between the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] and their resilience and readiness for war. He goes into extensive detail about variances in the SS, individual divisions, police organisations, and outlines his duties regarding economic operations of the SS and being a minister of the Reich.

===On the Holocaust===
{{Listen|filename=Himmler Posen Speech - Extermination of the Jews excerpt, Oct 4, 1943.ogg|title="''Die Ausrottung des jüdischen Volkes''"|description=An excerpt of this speech where Himmler discusses the ongoing extermination of the Jews.}}
In his outline of the course of the war in the east, Himmler comments on the deaths of millions of Soviet prisoners of war and [[forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]]. Like in pre-war speeches, and in accordance with Hitler's remarks in [[Mein Kampf]], he speaks of how the eradication of the Slavic ''Untermensch'' is a historical and natural necessity. There is to be no place for sentiment:&lt;ref&gt;IMT: Volume 29 (Urkunden und anderes Beweismaterial), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|One basic principle must be the absolute rule for the SS men: We must be honest, decent, loyal and comradely to [[Volksdeutsche|members of our own blood]] and to nobody else. What happens to a Russian, to a Czech, does not interest me in the slightest. What other nations can offer in the way of good blood of our type, we will [[Germanisation|take]], if necessary, by [[kidnapping of children by Nazi Germany|kidnapping their children and raising them here with us]]. Whether nations live in prosperity or starve to death interests me only so far as we need them as slaves for our culture; otherwise, it is of no interest to me. Whether 10,000 Russian females fall down from exhaustion while digging an antitank ditch interests me only insofar as the anti-tank ditch for Germany is finished.}}

Himmler explicitly speaks of the genocide of the Jews, something which had not been previously done by a representative of the Nazi party up until this point:&lt;ref&gt;IMT: Volume 29, p. 145f&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I am now referring to the evacuation of the Jews, the extermination of the Jewish people. It's one of those things that is easily said: 'The Jewish people are being exterminated', says every party member, 'this is very obvious, it's in our program, elimination of the Jews, extermination, we're doing it, hah, a small matter.' And then they turn up, the upstanding 80 million Germans, and each one has his decent Jew. They say the others are all swines, but this particular one is a splendid Jew. But none has observed it, endured it. Most of you here know what it means when 100 corpses lie next to each other, when there are 500 or when there are 1,000. To have endured this and at the same time to have remained a decent person — with exceptions due to human weaknesses — has made us tough, and is a glorious chapter that has not and will not be spoken of. Because we know how difficult it would be for us if we still had Jews as secret saboteurs, agitators and rabble-rousers in every city, what with the bombings, with the burden and with the hardships of the war. If the Jews were still part of the German nation, we would most likely arrive now at the state we were at in 1916 and 17 [...]}}

Himmler then praises the mindset of the SS man, devoting approximately 30 of the 116 pages to their virtues as well as their duty of becoming Europe's ruling class in 20 to 30 years.

==Speech of 6 October 1943==
Of the second Posen speech, Himmler's terse notes are available, as well as a version recorded via shorthand then typed up and corrected in detail, and the final version as authorised by Himmler himself. The speech in each of these stages resided in the files of the Personal Staff of the Reichsführer (''Persönlichen Stabes Reichsführer-SS''), which were seized in their entirety by U.S. authorities in 1945. The text of the speech was recorded into microfilm by the U.S. and released to the [[Bundesarchiv]]. Analysis of these previously unavailable documents by historian Erich Goldhagen in 1970 in Koblenz revealed a speech hitherto unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Krebs, Werner Tschacher: ''Speer und Er. Und Wir? Deutsche Geschichte in gebrochener Erinnerung.'' In: ''Geschichte in Wissenschaft und Unterricht'', Book 3, 58 (2007), p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; It was printed in its entireity for the first time in 1974 in Bradley Smith's and Agnes Peterson's book of selected Himmler speeches.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Peterson: ''Heinrich Himmler Geheimreden'' p. 267 (Edition notes), p. 273 (Nr. 85) and p. 300, Note 1&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of September 1943, the [[Nazi Party Chancellery|party chancellery]] invited all Reichsleiters and Gauleiters, the head of the [[Hitler Youth]] [[Artur Axmann]] and Reich ministers [[Albert Speer]] and [[Alfred Rosenberg]] to a conference. This [[Posen Conference]] began on 6 October at 9 o'clock in the morning with Speer's reports, his speakers, and four big industries for armament production. Talks from [[Karl Dönitz]] and [[Erhard Milch]] followed. Himmler held his speech from 17:30 to 19:00.&lt;ref&gt;Gitta Sereny: ''Albert Speer: Sein Ringen mit der Wahrheit.'' Munich 2001, {{ISBN|3-442-15141-4}}, p. 468ff&lt;/ref&gt; The second speech is shorter than the first, but contains a slightly longer and more explicit passage regarding the genocide of the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Peterson: ''Heinrich Himmler'' pp. 162–183&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beginning of the speech===
Himmler begins by discussing partisans in Russia and support from Vlasov's auxiliary forces. The widespread idea that there would be a 300 kilometre wide belt dominated by partisans behind the German front is considered false. Frequently expressed is the view that Russia can only be conquered by Russians. This view is considered to be dangerous and wrong. Slavs are to be considered unreliable on a matter of principle, and for that reason, Russian [[Hiwi (volunteer)|Hiwi]]s may only be employed as combatants in mixed units.

The danger of infiltrated parachutists, fugitive [[prisoner of war|POW]]s and forced labourers is considered marginal, since the German population is in an impeccable way and grants the opponent no shelter, and the police have such dangers under control. A request by Gauleiters for a special force against the insurgency in the country is considered to be unnecessary and unacceptable.

===On the Jewish question===
Himmler then reveals to "this most secret circle" his thoughts on the [[Jewish question]], which he describes as "the most difficult decision of my life".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Peterson: ''Heinrich Himmler'' p. 169 f.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Stroop Report - Warsaw Ghetto Uprising 09.jpg|thumb|[[Stroop Report]] original caption: "Forcibly pulled out of dug-outs". Captured Jews are led by German troops to the assembly point for deportation after the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]], 1943]]

{{quote|I ask of you that that which I say to you in this circle be really only heard and not ever discussed. We were faced with the question: what about the women and children? – I decided to find a clear solution to this problem too. I did not consider myself justified to exterminate the men – in other words, to kill them or have them killed and allow the avengers of our sons and grandsons in the form of their children to grow up. The difficult decision had to be made to have this people disappear from the earth. For the organisation which had to execute this task, it was the most difficult which we had ever had. [...] I felt obliged to you, as the most superior dignitary, as the most superior dignitary of the party, this political order, this political instrument of the Führer, to also speak about this question quite openly and to say how it has been. The Jewish question in the countries that we occupy will be solved by the end of this year. Only remainders of odd Jews that managed to find hiding places will be left over.}}

Himmler then discusses the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] (19 April – 16 May 1943) and the heavy battles during it:&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Peterson: ''Heinrich Himmler'' p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|This entire ghetto was producing fur coats, dresses, and the like. Whenever we tried to get at it in the past we were told: Stop! Armaments factory! Of course, this has nothing to do with Party Comrade Speer. It wasn't your doing. It is this portion of alleged armaments factories that Party Comrade Speer and I intend to clear out in the next few weeks.}}

Himmler discusses the dismissal of [[Benito Mussolini]], which is to have led to defeatism. A few death sentences imposed on the basis of making corrosive remarks are to serve as dissuasive warnings for thousands of others, and party members must display exemplary behaviour. Himmler then discusses his duties as Reich minister of the interior. By Hitler's volition, party organisation and administrative organisation are henceforth two separate pillars. Decentralized decisions are considered important, but centralised arrangements take precedence in the strained war situation. As a result, Himmler makes broad criticism of the personal politics of Gauleiters. In the last part of his speech, he goes into the benefits of the [[Waffen-SS]]. Himmler closes by discussing how the German national boundary will be pushed 500&amp;nbsp;km eastwards with 120 million people being relocated, and ends with the appeal:&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Peterson: ''Heinrich Himmler'' p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1979-026-22, Adolf Hitler verleiht Albert Speer Fritz-Todt-Ring.jpg|thumb|[[Albert Speer]] awarded an ''[[Organisation Todt]]'' ring by [[Adolf Hitler]] – May 1943]]

{{quote|When we see this then we will never lose our belief, never will we become disloyal, never will we be cowardly, never in bad spirits, but we will strive to be worthy to have lived under Adolf Hitler and been allowed to fight with him.}}

[[Albert Speer]], Reich minister for arms and munition since 1942, was, since 2 September 1943 as Reich minister for armament and wartime economy, responsible for all German armament production. This used Jewish forced labourers who were partly exempted from being deported to their extermination until 1943. After 1945, Speer always maintained that he left the conference before Himmler made his speech and knew nothing of the Holocaust. Historians cite Himmler's direct reference to Speer as proof of his presence.&lt;ref&gt;Krebs, Tschacher: ''Speer und Er'' pp. 163–173&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further speeches==
Statements from five further secret speeches by Himmler confirm the sentiment he expressed in Posen on the "final solution to the Jewish question". On 16 December 1943, he said to [[Kriegsmarine]] commanders:&lt;ref name="Smith, Peterson p. 201"&gt;Smith, Peterson: ''Heinrich Himmler'' p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[...] Thus I have basically given the order to also kill the wives and children of these partisans, and commissars. I would be a weakling and a criminal to our descendants if I allowed the hate-filled sons of the sub-humans we have liquidated in this struggle of humanity against subhumanity to grow up.}}

A handwritten memo from Himmler's speech on 26 January 1944 in Posen to Generals of fighting troops reads:&lt;ref name="Smith, Peterson p. 201"/&gt;

{{quote|Largest stabilisation in the [[General Government|G.G.]] since the solution to the Jewish question. – [[Race war]]. Total solution. Not allowing avengers to rise against our children.}}

{{Listen|filename=1944 - Himmler's Posen Speeches excerpt III.ogg|title=5 May 1944 - Himmler's Posen Speeches excerpt}}
On 5 May 1944 Himmler explained to Generals in Sonthofen that perseverance in the bombing war has only been possible because the Jews in Germany have been discarded.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Peterson: ''Heinrich Himmler'' p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The Jewish question has been solved within Germany itself and in general within the countries occupied by Germany. [...] You can understand how difficult it was for me to carry out this military order which I was given and which I implemented out of a sense of obedience and absolute conviction. If you say: 'we can understand as far as the men are concerned but not about the children', then I must remind you of what I said at the beginning. [...] In my view, we as Germans, however deeply we may feel in our hearts, are not entitled to allow a generation of avengers filled with hatred to grow up with whom our children and grandchildren will have to deal because we, too weak and cowardly, left it to them.}}

Applause can be heard on a recording of another speech given to Generals in Sonthofen on 24 May 1944, when Himmler says:&lt;ref name="Smith, Peterson p. 203"&gt;Smith, Peterson: ''Heinrich Himmler'' p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Another question which was decisive for the inner security of the Reich and Europe, was the Jewish question. It was uncompromisingly solved after orders and rational recognition. I believe, gentleman, that you know me well enough to know that I am not a bloodthirsty person; I am not a man who takes pleasure or joy when something rough must be done. However on the other hand, I have such good nerves and such a developed sense of duty – I can say that much for myself – that when I recognise something as necessary I can implement it without compromise. I have not considered myself entitled – this concerns especially the Jewish women and children – to allow the children to grow into the avengers who will then murder our children and our grandchildren. That would have been cowardly. Consequently the question was uncompromisingly resolved.}}

On 21 June 1944 Himmler spoke to Generals educated in the Nazi world view&lt;ref&gt;Peter Longerich: ''Der ungeschriebene Befehl'' p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; in Sonthofen, mentioning the Jewish question again:&lt;ref name="Smith, Peterson p. 203"/&gt;

{{quote|It was the most terrible task and the most terrible order which could have been given to an organisation: the order to solve the Jewish question. In this circle, I may say it frankly with a few sentences. It is good that we had the severity to exterminate the Jews in our domain.}}

===Historical reception===
The destruction of the Jews was to be kept secret from those outside the Nazi regime, but could only be organised and carried out with the participation of all relevant state and party executives. The Posen speeches offer a retrospective look at the mass killings already carried out, and show how these and further killings were ideologically justified by the Party. The extermination of the "internal enemy" (''innerer Feind''), the Jewish race, had become an objective of the war, and success in this field was to compensate for other defeats accrued in the course of the war.

Saul Friedländer highlights Himmler's self-image as an unconditionally obedient executor of Hitler's plans for the Germanic "[[Lebensraum]] in the east".&lt;ref&gt;Saul Friedländer: Das Dritte Reich und die Juden 2. Band: Die Jahre der Vernichtung 1939–1945, C.H. Beck, Munich 2006, {{ISBN|3-406-54966-7}}, p. 570.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The Reichsführer frequently describes the extermination of the Jews as a heavy responsibility assigned by the Führer. There is thus no debate: this task calls for unremitting devotion and a spirit of continual self-sacrifice of him and his men.}}

Konrad Kwiet comments on Himmler's association of the "heaviest task" the SS ever had to perform with the ''Anständigkeit'' (decency) that had been preserved of it:&lt;ref&gt;Konrad Kwiet: ''Rassenpolitik und Völkermord'', in: ''Enzyklopädie des Nationalsozialismus'', dtv, 2nd edition, Munich 1998, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It is precisely this monstrous combination of murder and morality, of crime and decency at the core of the perpetrator's mentality. In the scope of the Nazi ethic, an entirely new concept of decency was created and made as a duty. [[Hannah Arendt]] coined the term "[[Eichmann in Jerusalem#The banality of evil|banality of evil]]", other authors emphasize the "normality of crime". Almost all perpetrators were characterized by their ability to return to the routine of every day life, and to lead a "normal" life after perpetrating murder. Most reacted with surprise, confusion and anger when they were prosecuted and reminded of the past. Ignorance and innocence were stressed before the court. The murderers were – with exceptions – spared from the traumatic experiences that survivors were left with.}}

Hans Buchheim comments that the accused perpetrators very probably lacked a ''[[mens rea]]''. Himmler's revaluation of soldierly virtues was not a total negation of moral norms, but a suspension of them for the exceptional situation of the extermination of the Jews, which had been passed off as a historical necessity. Therefore, Himmler endorsed the murder of the Jews not by instruction, but via the "correct" ideological motives, while letting similar murders committed out of sadism or selfishness be prosecutable.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Buchheim: ''Anatomie des SS-Staates'' Volume 1: ''Die SS – das Herrschaftsinstrument. Befehl und Gehorsam.'' dtv (1. edition 1967) 2. edition Munich 1979, {{ISBN|3-423-02915-3}}, pp. 247–253 and p. 266f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Dieter Pohl states:&lt;ref&gt;Frank Bajohr, Dieter Pohl: ''Der Holocaust als offenes Geheimnis.'' Munich 2006, {{ISBN|3-406-54978-0}}, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Traditional institutions of the Nazi state secretly began the search for a defence strategy for the post-war period in 1943: one had not been informed, and the SS was exclusively to blame.}}

The unsparing portrayal of the genocide in Himmler's secret speech is thus interpreted as a means to formally render senior SS and Nazi functionaries as co-conspirators and accomplices in the perpetration of the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Longerich: ''Heinrich Himmler – Biographie.'' Munich 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-88680-859-5}}, p. 710 / q. v. Gitta Sereny: ''Albert Speer…'', p. 468.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Goebbels]] alludes to this view in his diary entry of 2 March 1943:&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Goebbels. Tagebücher, Band 5: 1943–1945, Piper Verlag, Munich 2003, {{ISBN|3-492-21415-0}}, p. 1905.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|As always in the circles of the party, it is the duty of the Führer's closest friends to gather around him in such times of need [...] Above all with the Jewish question, we are so fixed on it that there is no longer any escape. And that's good. A movement and a people that have broken the bridges behind them fight from experience much more unreservedly than those that still have the possibility to retreat.}}

In an entry dated 9 October 1943, Goebbels commented on Himmler's second speech, at which he was present:&lt;ref&gt;Cited according to Saul Friedländer: ''Das Dritte Reich und die Juden'' Volume 2: ''Die Jahre der Vernichtung 1939–1945'', I.c. p. 572.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Regarding the Jewish question, he [Himmler] gives a very unadorned and frank picture. He is of the conviction that the Jewish question can be solved by the end of this year. He advocates the most radical and most severe solution, namely to exterminate Jewry, bag and baggage. Of course, if brutal, this is a consistent solution. Because we must take on the responsibility of entirely solving this question in our time. Subsequent generations will doubtlessly no longer dare address this problem with the courage and obsession as we are able to do today.}}

===Holocaust denial===
{{See also|Criticism of Holocaust denial#Himmler's speeches and "Ausrottung"|Responsibility for the Holocaust#Other Nazi leaders}}

[[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]] have frequently attempted to negate Himmler's speeches as proof of the Holocaust. In particular, where Himmler – in his speech of 4 October 1943 – refers to the "''Ausrottung des jüdischen Volkes''" (extermination of the Jewish people), they will read the verb ''ausrotten'' (literally to "root out", aus = out; rott = root) and its related noun ''Ausrottung'' to offer a much more benign interpretation, i.e., Himmler was merely referring to the deportation of Jews and a desire to "root them out", as opposed to their mass destruction.&lt;ref name=THHPTranslation&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.holocaust-history.org/himmler-poznan/ausrotten.shtml|title='Ausrotten' in Translation|publisher=[[The Holocaust History Project]]|accessdate=2009-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ausrotten'' can mean "to stamp out/to root out", but only figuratively, e.g., in contexts of concepts or ideals.&lt;ref name=THHPTranslation/&gt; In the context of living things (such as a people or race), ''ausrotten'' accordingly means destroying something so that it cannot return.&lt;ref name=THHPTranslation/&gt; [[David Irving]] considers the usage of the word "Ausrotten" vitally important and also agrees that the term was referring to eradication. He confirms this in an interview from 2007 when he compares its usage with [[Goebbels]] half-word "Ausrott..." during the [[Sportpalast speech]] from February 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Irving|first=David|title=David Irving Interview Part Two|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFIU-n9X5Po&amp;NR=1|publisher=Alan Heath|accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the subsequent paragraph, Himmler compares his disdain for individuals gaining personally (e.g. stealing) from Jewish victims, and the necessity to prevent this personal gain, to becoming sick and dying "from the same bacillus that we have exterminated" (''weil wir den Bazillus ausrotten, an dem Bazillus krank werden und sterben''). This use of ''ausrotten'' can be read as killing or extermination in the context of living things, because arguing for the deportation of bacteria would make no sense.&lt;ref name=THHPTranslation/&gt; The reference to a bacillus in this statement is figurative, however, in line with Nazi rhetoric that encouraged dehumanizing concepts of Jews as a pathogen or malignant presence, rather than people.

In the "Ausrottung des jüdischen Volkes" paragraph, Himmler says:

{|
!Original
!Translated
|-
|{{quote|''... wir hatten die Pflicht unserem Volk gegenüber das zu tun, dieses Volk, das uns umbringen wollte, umzubringen.''}}
|{{quote|... we had the duty to our people to do it, to kill this people who wanted to kill us.}}
|}

Himmler thus confirms that the context is explicitly physical extermination, since ''umbringen'' simply has no meaning other than "to kill".&lt;ref name=THHPTranslation/&gt; Because of this, critics explain that Holocaust deniers will arbitrarily select words from the dictionary that have nothing to do with the given context, such as cherry-picking the definition for ''Unkraut'' (weeds) and erroneously applying it to ''Volk'' (people).&lt;ref name=THHPTranslation/&gt;

In the second speech in Posen, critics point to the fact that he defines the meaning of ''ausrotten'', where the operative word is ''umbringen''.

{|
!Original
!Translated
|-
|{{quote|''Es trat an uns die Frage heran: Wie ist es mit den Frauen und Kindern? Ich habe mich entschlossen, auch hier eine ganz klare Lösung zu finden. Ich hielt mich nämlich nicht für berechtigt, '''die Männer auszurotten- sprich also, umzubringen oder umbringen zu lassen''' – und die Rächer in Gestalt der Kinder für unsere Söhne und Enkel groß werden zu lassen. Es mußte der schwere Entschluß gefaßt werden, dieses Volk von der Erde verschwinden zu lassen.''}}
|{{quote|We came to the question: How is it with the women and children? I decided to find a clear solution here as well. I did not consider myself justified '''to exterminate the men – in other words, to kill them or have them killed''' – and allow the avengers of our sons and grandsons in the form of their children to grow up. The difficult decision had to be taken to make this people disappear from the earth.}}
|}

Holocaust deniers will also offer erroneous translations of ''ausrotten'' by analysing the word's compounds, on the basis that "''aus''" and "''rotten''" are cognate with the English "out" and "root". To native German speakers, this is simply wrong.&lt;ref name=THHPTranslation/&gt; Critics compare this attempted etymological explanation to an attempt to cite the Latin origins of "ex" (out of) and "terminus" (borders) and on that basis, claim that "exterminate" means deportation, which would be equally nonsensical to native English speakers.&lt;ref name=THHPTranslation/&gt;

Critics point out that German Holocaust deniers do not dare suggest a translation to a German audience where ''ausrotten'' does not mean physical extermination,&lt;ref name=THHPTranslation/&gt; citing instances of German deniers dismissing failed etymological analysis by English speakers by responding to confirm that ''ausrotten'' means complete destruction, and material written by German deniers where, in the context of people, ''ausrotten'' and ''vernichten'' are used synonymously.&lt;ref name="THHPDE"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.holocaust-history.org/himmler-poznan/ausrotten-native.shtml|title='Ausrotten', to Native German Speakers|publisher=[[The Holocaust History Project]]|accessdate=2009-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Germar Rudolf]] and [[Udo Walendy]] have claimed that the recording of the first speech is a forgery: Himmler's voice was actually that of a 1945 Allied voice imitator.&lt;ref name="h-ref"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.h-ref.de/personen/himmler-heinrich/himmler-in-posen.php|title=Heinrich Himmler in Posen|publisher=www.h-ref.de|language=German|accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the discovery of the second Posen speech in the Koblenz [[Bundesarchiv]] rendered allegations of falsification completely irrelevant. Himmler's explicit statements, such as making the decision to make the Jews "disappear from the earth", leave no room for alternative interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Peterson: ''Heinrich Himmler''…, p. 301 and footnote 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artistic references===
In Romuald Karmakar's 2000 film ''The Himmler Project'', the actor [[Manfred Zapatka]] reads the entire speech of 4 October 1943 word for word according to the recording, including all the nuances and incidents also recorded and the repetitions where Himmler loses his place while reading from a prepared manuscript. During the film, Zapatka wears no uniform and simply stands in front of a grey wall.&lt;ref name="3sat"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.3sat.de/dynamic/sitegen/bin/sitegen.php?tab=2&amp;source=/film/news/23045/index.html |title=Das Himmler-Projekt |publisher=www.3sat.de |language=German |accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heinrich Breloers multipart television film ''[[Speer und Er]]'' contains a debate as to whether Albert Speer was present during Himmler's speech on 6 October 1943.

In [[Jonathan Littell]]'s ''[[The Kindly Ones (Littell novel)|The Kindly Ones]]'', the first-person narrator, Maximilian Aue, cannot remember whether Speer was present or not, but does cite Speer's remark that he (Speer) remembered many officers being terribly drunk. As Speer only arrived in the morning for his speech, this would actually mean Speer was present during the evening's dinner, after [[Himmler]]'s second Posen speech.

{{History of Indonesia}}
The '''Proclamation of Indonesian Independence''' ({{lang-id|Proklamasi Kemerdekaan Indonesia}}, or simply ''Proklamasi'') was read at 10:00 a.m. on Friday, 17 August 1945. The declaration marked the start of the diplomatic and armed resistance of the [[Indonesian National Revolution]], fighting against the forces of the [[Netherlands]] and pro-Dutch civilians, until the latter officially acknowledged Indonesia's independence in 1949. In 2005, the Netherlands declared that they had decided to accept [[de facto]] 17 August 1945 as [[Indonesia]]'s independence date.&lt;ref name=jp2&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Dutch govt expresses regrets over killings in RI|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2005/08/18/dutch-govt-expresses-regrets-over-killings-ri.html|work=[[Jakarta Post]]|publisher=|date=18 August 2005|accessdate=23 November 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607140113/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2005/08/18/dutch-govt-expresses-regrets-over-killings-ri.html|archivedate=7 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 interview the Indonesian historian [[Sukotjo]], amongst others, asked the Dutch government to formally acknowledge the date of independence as 17 August 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://nos.nl/video/549112-indonesie-wil-erkenning-onafhankelijkheidsdag.html |title=Indonesië wil erkenning onafhankelijkheidsdag |language=Dutch |publisher=[[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting]] |date=8 September 2013 |accessdate=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The document was signed by [[Sukarno]] (who signed his name "Soekarno" using the older Dutch orthography) and [[Mohammad Hatta]], who were appointed president and vice-president respectively the following day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ericwja.wordpress.com/2011/12/07/indonesia-proclamation-hero-mr-soekarno/ Soekarno Profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|section|date=August 2018}}&lt;!--3.5 paragraphs without citations--&gt;
[[File:SoekarnoDoaProKemRI.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sukarno]] praying before proclaiming the independence of Indonesia]]
The [[Draft document|draft]] was prepared only a few hours earlier, on the night of 16 August, by [[Sukarno]], [[Mohammad Hatta|Hatta]], and Soebardjo, at the house of [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Tadashi Maeda (admiral)|Tadashi Maeda]], Miyako-Doori 1, [[Jakarta]] (now the [[Formulation of Proclamation Text Museum]], Jl. Imam Bonjol No. 1, Jakarta). The original Indonesian Declaration of Independence was typed by [[Sayuti Melik]].&lt;ref name=jp&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title=Former governor Ali Sadikin, freedom fighter SK Trimurti die |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/05/21/former-governor-ali-sadikin-freedom-fighter-sk-trimurti-die.html |work= [[Jakarta Post]] |publisher= |date=21 May 2008 |accessdate=7 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tempo&gt;{{cite news|first=Dian|last=Yuliastuti|title=Freedom Fighter SK Trimurti Dies|url=http://www.tempointeraktif.com/hg/nasional/2008/05/21/brk,20080521-123376,uk.html|work=Tempo Interactive|publisher=|date=21 May 2008|accessdate=7 June 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927214543/http://www.tempointeraktif.com/hg/nasional/2008/05/21/brk,20080521-123376,uk.html|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maeda himself was sleeping in his room upstairs. He was agreeable to the idea of [[Indonesia]]'s [[independence]], and had lent his house for the drafting of the declaration. [[Field Marshal|Marshal]] [[Terauchi Hisaichi|Terauchi]], the highest-ranking [[Japan]]ese leader in [[South East Asia]] and son of [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Terauchi Masatake]], was however against Indonesia's independence, scheduled for 24 August.

While the formal preparation of the declaration, and the official independence itself for that matter, had been carefully planned a few months earlier, the actual declaration date was brought forward almost inadvertently as a consequence of the Japanese [[Surrender of Japan|unconditional surrender]] to the Allies on 15 August following the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Nagasaki atomic bombing]]. The historic event was triggered by a plot, led by a few more radical youth activists such as [[Adam Malik]] and Chairul Saleh, that put pressure on Sukarno and Hatta to proclaim independence immediately. The declaration was to be signed by the 27 members of the [[Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence]] (PPKI) symbolically representing the new nation's diversity. The particular act was apparently inspired by a similar spirit of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. However, the idea was heavily turned down by the radical activists mentioned earlier, arguing that the committee was too closely associated with then soon to be defunct Japanese occupation rule, thus creating a potential credibility issue. Instead, the radical activists demanded that the signatures of six of them were to be put on the document. All parties involved in the historical moment finally agreed on a compromise solution which only included Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta as the co-signers 'in the name of the nation of Indonesia'.

Sukarno had initially wanted the declaration to be read at Ikada Plain, the large open field in the centre of Jakarta, but due to unfounded widespread apprehension over the possibility of Japanese sabotage, the venue was changed to Sukarno's house at Pegangsaan Timur 56. There was no concrete evidence for the growing suspicions, as the Japanese had already surrendered to the Allies, The declaration of independence passed without a hitch.

The proclamation at 56, Jalan Pegangsaan Timur, Jakarta, was heard throughout the country because the text was secretly broadcast by Indonesian radio personnel using the transmitters of the JAKARTA Hoso Kyoku radio station. An English translation of the proclamation was broadcast overseas.

An [[English language|English]] translation published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as of October 1948 included the entire speech as read by [[Sukarno]]. It incorporated remarks made immediately prior to and after the actual proclamation. [[George McTurnan Kahin]], a [[historian]] on Indonesia, believed that they were omitted from publication in Indonesia either due to Japanese control of media outlets or fear of provoking a harsh Japanese response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/3351273 | last = Kahin | first = George McT. | authorlink = George McTurnan Kahin | title = Sukarno's Proclamation of Indonesian Independence | journal = Indonesia | volume = 69 |date=April 2000 | issue = 69 | publisher = Cornell Modern Indonesia Project | place = Ithaca, NY | pages = 1–4 | url = http://cip.cornell.edu/seap.indo/1106943306 | accessdate =24 June 2009 | postscript = . | jstor = 3351273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Unix-like]] and some other [[operating system]]s, the &lt;code&gt;'''pwd'''&lt;/code&gt; [[command (computing)|command]] ('''''p'''rint '''w'''orking '''d'''irectory'')&lt;ref name="unix"&gt;[http://cm.bell-labs.com/7thEdMan/v7vol1.pdf UNIX TIME-SHARING SYSTEM: UNIX PROGRAMMER’S MANUAL Seventh Edition, Volume 1 (January, 1979) by Bell labs, Page 142]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="minix"&gt;[http://www.unix.com/man-page/minix/1/pwd/ Minix MAN page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="linux"&gt;[https://www.mankier.com/1/pwd  Linux MAN page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gnu"&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/coreutils.html#pwd-invocation GNU Coreutils MAN page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="plan9"&gt;[http://www.unix.com/man-page/plan9/1/pwd/ Bell Labs Plan 9 MAN page]&lt;/ref&gt;
writes the full [[path (computing)|pathname]] of the current [[working directory]] to the [[standard output]].&lt;ref name="posix"&gt;[http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/pwd.html POSIX Standard (IEEE Std 1003.1) pwd page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dec"&gt;[http://www.unix.com/man-page/osf1/1/pwd/ DEC OSF/1 MAN page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="apple"&gt;[https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/pwd.1.html Apple OS X MAN page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bsd"&gt;[https://man.openbsd.org/pwd.1 OpenBSD MAN page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="solaris"&gt;[http://www.unix.com/man-page/opensolaris/1/pwd/ OpenSolaris MAN page]&lt;/ref&gt;

The command is a [[shell builtin]] in most [[Unix shell]]s such as [[Bourne shell]], [[Almquist shell|ash]], [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]], [[Korn shell|ksh]], and [[Z shell|zsh]]. It can be implemented easily with the [[POSIX]] [[C (programming language)|C]] functions &lt;code&gt;getcwd()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;getwd()&lt;/code&gt;.

The equivalent on [[DOS]] (&lt;code&gt;[[COMMAND.COM]]&lt;/code&gt;) and [[Microsoft Windows]] (&lt;code&gt;[[cmd.exe]]&lt;/code&gt;) is the &lt;code&gt;[[cd (command)|cd]]&lt;/code&gt; command with no arguments. [[Windows PowerShell]] provides the equivalent &lt;code&gt;Get-Location&lt;/code&gt; [[cmdlet]] with the standard aliases &lt;code&gt;gl&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;pwd&lt;/code&gt;. The [[OpenVMS]] equivalent is &lt;code&gt;show default&lt;/code&gt;.

==*nix examples==

Note: POSIX requires that the default behavior be as if the &lt;tt&gt;-L&lt;/tt&gt; switch were provided.

==Working directory shell variables==

POSIX shells set the following [[environment variable]]s while using the cd command:&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/cd.html POSIX Standard (IEEE Std 1003.1) cd page]&lt;/ref&gt;

 OLDPWD – The previous working directory (as set by the cd command).
 PWD – The current working directory (as set by the cd command).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9551">'''The Service Interface for Real Time Information''' or '''SIRI''' is an [[XML]] protocol to allow distributed computers to exchange [[Real time business intelligence|real time]] information about [[public transport]] services and vehicles. 

The protocol is a [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]] norm, developed originally as a technical standard with initial participation by France, Germany ([[Verband Deutscher Verkehrsunternehmen]]), Scandinavia, and the UK ([[RTIG]])

SIRI is based on the CEN [[Transmodel]] abstract model for public transport information, and comprises a general purpose model, and an [[XML]] schema for public transport information.

A SIRI White Paper is available for further information on the protocol [https://www.vdv.de/siri-white-paper08.zipx?forced=true].

==Scope==
CEN SIRI allows pairs of server computers to exchange structured real-time information about schedules, vehicles, and connections, together with informational messages related to the operation of the services. The information can be used for many different purposes, for example:
*To provide real time-departure from stop information for display on stops, internet and mobile delivery systems;
*To provide real-time progress information about individual vehicles;
*To manage the movement of buses roaming between areas covered by different servers;
*To manage the synchronisation of guaranteed connections between fetcher and feeder services;
*To exchange planned and real-time timetable updates;
*To distribute status messages about the operation of the services;
*To provide performance information to operational history and other management systems.

CEN SIRI includes a number of optional capabilities.
Different countries may specify a country profile of the subset of SIRI capabilities that they wish to adopt.

==Architecture==
The CEN SIRI standard has two distinct components:
# '''SIRI Common Protocol Framework'''.  The Framework provides a uniform architecture for defining data messages either as request/response pairs or as publish/subscribe services. The payload content model is separated from the messaging aspects so that the same payload content can be used in both request and subscription services and the same common messaging components can be used for all the different functional services.  Common functions for subscription management, service monitoring,  content level authentication, etc are provided.    
# '''SIRI Functional Services'''. The SIRI specification specifies a number of distinct functional services, each designed for the exchange of a specific type of public transport data, all using the same protocol framework and basing their payload content on the [[Transmodel]] conceptual model. Additional functional services may be added that use the same framework  but different payload content models to cover additional services. 
===CEN SIRI Functional Services===
SIRI V1.0 defined eight functional services;
* ''SIRI-PT: Planned Timetable'' service: Allows the exchange of the planned timetable for a public transport service along a route.
* ''SIRI-ET: Estimated Timetable'' service: Allows the exchange of the real-time timetable for a public transport service along a route.
* ''SIRI-ST: Stop Timetable'' service: Allows the exchange of the planned arrivals and departures at a stop of public transport services.
* ''SIRI-SM: Stop Monitoring'' service: Allows the exchange of the real-time arrivals and departures at a stop of public transport services.
* ''SIRI-VM: Vehicle Monitoring'' service: Allows the exchange of the real-time positions of public transport vehicles.
* ''SIRI-CT: Connection Timetable'' service: Allows the exchange of the planned connections of public transport services  at a stop.
* ''SIRI-CM: Connection Monitoring'' service: Allows the exchange of the real-time  connections of public transport services  at a stop, taking into account delays.
* ''SIRI-GM: General Messaging '' service: Allows the exchange of the simple messages relating to public transport services. 
Two further functional services have been added as part of the CEN SIRI specification;
* ''SIRI-FM: Facility Monitoring'' service: Allows the exchange of the real-time  status of facilities at a stop such as lifts, escalators, etc.  
* ''SIRI-SX: Situation Exchange'' service: Allows the exchange of the structured messages relating to public transport services and networks.
===Other CEN Standards that use the SIRI Common Protocol Framework=== 
The ''CEN SIRI  Common Protocol Framework'' can be used by other standards to define their own Functional Services. Two CEN standards that do this are;
* The ''CEN [[NeTEx]]'' specification for Public Transport reference data uses the ''CEN SIRI Common Protocol Framework'' to define a SIRI based exchange service to exchange any type of [[NeTEx]] data element within a frame.
* The ''CEN [[Open API for distributed journey planning]]'' uses the ''CEN SIRI Common Protocol Framework'' to define a protocol for [[Journey_planner|journey planning]].

==Current version &amp; Documentation==
Version 2.0 of SIRI [https://www.vdv.de/siri.aspx], representing the CEN documents as published, is currently available as a set of XSD files packaged as a zip file [https://www.vdv.de/siri-xml-2.0o-cen---draft-2.zipx?forced=true].

* CEN TS 15531-1:2015 - ''Part 1: Context and framework.''
* CEN TS 15531-2:2015 - ''Part 2: Communications infrastructure.''
* CEN TS 15531-3:2015 - ''Part 3: Functional service interfaces'' (covering the SIRI-PT, SIRI-ET, SIRI-ST, SIRI-SM, SIRI-CT, SIRI-CM, and SIRI-GM functional services).
* CEN/TS 15531-4:2011 - ''Part 4: Functional service interfaces - Facility Monitoring.''
* CEN/TS 15531-5:2016 - ''Part 5: Functional service interfaces - Situation Exchange.''

SIRI is maintained under a maintenance regime, with version control managed by a working group of the CEN TC/278 Working Group 3 . Later versions of the schema are available at the same site, together with change notes.

==History==
The CEN SIRI standard was developed from European national standards for real-time data exchange, in particular the German [[Association of German Transport Companies|VDV]] 453 standard,  between 2000 and 2005, and included eight functional services. V1.0 became a CEN Technical  Standard in 2006 and a full CEN standard in 2009.  

Two additional functional services were added later  Situation Exchange (SX) (Technical Standard 2009, Standard 2016)  and Facility Monitoring (FM) (2011).

A number of small enhancements were subsequently added as informal changes creating interim releases v1.1, v1.2, etc.  

Two other CEN standards were developed that made use of the 'SIRI Common Protocol Framework' to define their own functional services;  [[NeTEx]] (v1.0  published in  2014)  and [[Open API for distributed journey planning]]  (v 1.0 published   in 2017).

Version 2.0 of CEN-SIRI was developed between  adopted in 2015.  This is backwards compatible with V1.0 and both formalises the adoption of the interim enhancements and adds a number of additional features.
An important new addition in SIRI v2.0  was the description of a uniform transform for rendering  CEN-SIRI  messages into a  flat format that can be used in simple  http requests without an XML rendering.

'''''Monty Python's Spamalot''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical comedy]] adapted from the 1975 film ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]''.  Like the motion picture, it is a highly irreverent parody of the [[Arthurian legend]], but it differs from the film in many ways. The original 2005 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production, directed by [[Mike Nichols]], received 14 [[Tony Award]]s nominations, winning in three categories, including [[Tony Award for Best Musical|Best Musical]]. During its initial run of 1,575 performances, it was seen by more than two million people and grossed over $175 million.&lt;ref name="playbillend" /&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Before the show===
A recording encourages members of the audience to "let your cellphones and pagers ring willy-nilly," and comments that they should "be aware there are heavily armed knights on stage that may drag you on stage and impale you." This was recorded by Eric Idle. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===Act I===
A historian narrates a brief overview of [[medieval]] [[England]]. In a miscommunication between the actors and the narrator, the actors sing an introductory song about Finland ''("Fisch Schlapping Song")''. The Historian returns, irritated, and tells the frolicking Finns that he was talking about '''Eng'''land, not '''Fin'''land.  The scene immediately changes to a dreary, dark village with penitent [[monk]]s in hooded robes chanting [[Latin]] and hitting themselves with books. [[King Arthur]] travels the land with his servant Patsy, who follows him around banging two coconut shells together to make the sound of a horse's hooves as Arthur "rides" before him, trying to recruit [[Knights of the Round Table]] to join him in [[Camelot]]. He encounters a pair of sentries who are more interested in debating whether two swallows could successfully carry a coconut than in listening to the king.

Sir Robin, a collector of [[Plague (disease)|plague]] victims, and [[Sir Lancelot|Lancelot]], a large, handsome and incredibly violent man, meet as Lancelot attempts to dispose of the sickly Not Dead Fred. Although a plague victim, the man insists that he is not dead yet and he can dance and sing. He completes a dance number, but is soon hit over the head with a shovel and killed by an impatient Lancelot.  ''("He Is Not Dead Yet")''. They agree to become Knights of the Round Table together, Lancelot for the fighting, and Robin for the singing and the dancing.

Arthur attempts to convince a peasant named Dennis Galahad that he, Arthur, is king of England because the [[Lady of the Lake]] gave him [[Excalibur]], the sword given only to the man fit to rule England. However, Dennis and his mother, Mrs Galahad, are [[Political radicalism|political radicals]] and deny that any king who has not been elected by the people has any legitimate right to rule over them. To settle the issue, Arthur has the Lady Of The Lake and her Laker Girls appear to turn Dennis into a knight ''("Come With Me")''. Cheered on by the girls ''("Laker Girls Cheer")'', the Lady Of The Lake turns Dennis into [[Galahad|Sir Galahad]] and together, they sing a generic Broadway love song ''("The Song That Goes Like This")'', complete with chandelier.  They are joined by Sir Robin and Sir Lancelot, and together with [[Bedevere|Sir Bedevere]] and "the aptly named" Sir Not-Appearing-In-This-Show (a knight resembling [[Don Quixote]], who promptly apologises and leaves), they make up the Knights of the Round Table ''("All For One")''.

The five knights gather in [[Camelot]], a deliberately anachronistic place resembling [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas's]] Camelot-inspired [[Excalibur Hotel|Excalibur resort]], complete with showgirls, oversized dice and the Lady of the Lake headlining the Castle in full [[Cher]] get-up ''("Knights Of The Round Table"/"The Song That Goes Like This (Reprise)")''. In the midst of their revelry, they are contacted by [[God]] (a recording voiced by [[John Cleese]] of the original Monty Python troupe and Eric Idle in the version currently touring the UK) who tells them to locate the [[Holy Grail]]. Urged on by the Lady Of The Lake ''("Find Your Grail")'', the Knights set off. They travel throughout the land until they reach a castle, only to be viciously taunted by lewd [[French people|French]] soldiers. They attempt to retaliate by sending them a large wooden rabbit in the style of the [[Trojan Horse]]; however, they realise after the fact that it was not as simple as leaving the rabbit and walking away – they should have hidden inside it.  Defeated, they leave in a hurry when the French begin taunting them again, sending [[cancan]] dancers after them and throwing barnyard animals including cows at them ''("Run Away!")''. Arthur and his followers manage to run into the safety of the wings before the French catapult the Trojan Rabbit at them.

===Act II===
Sir Robin and his minstrels follow King Arthur and Patsy into a "dark and very expensive forest" (Arthur later says they're in a "Dark and '''extremely''' expensive forest), where they are separated. King Arthur meets the terrifying but silly [[Knights who say Ni]], who demand a [[shrubbery]]. King Arthur despairs of finding one, but Patsy cheers him up ''("[[Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life]]")'' and they find a shrubbery shortly after.

Sir Robin, after wandering the forest for some time with his minstrels ''("Brave Sir Robin")'', encounters [[Black Knight (Monty Python)|The Black Knight]], who scares him off, but King Arthur, who happens on the scene, more or less defeats him by cutting off both his arms and legs, impaling his still-alive torso on a door, and leaving to give the Knights their shrubbery. The Knights accept it, but next demand that King Arthur put on a musical and bring it to Broadway (in the [[United Kingdom]], this became a [[West End theatre|West End]] musical; on the tour, they must put on a "Broadway musical"), implying that it need only be Broadway-style, "but not an [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]". The mere mention of his name causes everyone to cover their ears and scream in pain. Sir Robin, who has found Arthur by this point,  insists that it would be impossible for them to accomplish this next task, since you need [[Jew]]s for a successful Broadway (or West End) musical ''("You Won't Succeed On Broadway")'', and proves his point in a wild production number filled with  ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'' parodies, including a bottle dance with Grails instead of bottles. King Arthur and Patsy promptly set off in search of Jews.

(In countries that don't have a tradition of Jews in the theatre, the lyrics of ''"You Won't Succeed on Broadway"'' are sometimes changed to instead describe the high production standards and acting talent needed to stage a successful musical in that country.  For example, in the [[South Korea]]n version, Sir Robin sings about recent successful musicals that were staged in [[Seoul]] during the previous decade.  Meanwhile, members of the ensemble appear onstage dressed as various characters from those musicals.  Among these characters are a cat from ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'', Kenickie from ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'', Kim from ''[[Miss Saigon]]'', [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|The Phantom]] from ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', and [[Velma Kelly]] from ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]''.  As with the original version of the song, Sir Robin and the entire ensemble end the number with a song and dance routine.)

While the Lady Of The Lake laments her lack of stage time ''("Whatever Happened To My Part?")'', Sir Lancelot receives a letter from what he assumes is a young damsel in distress. He is very surprised to find that the "damsel" is actually an effeminate young man named Prince Herbert ''("Where Are You?"/"Here Are You")'' whose overbearing, music-hating father, the King of Swamp Castle, is forcing him into an arranged marriage. As Herbert is asking Lancelot to help him escape, the King of Swamp Castle cuts the rope that he is using to climb out of the window, and Herbert falls to his apparent death. Lancelot is a bit puzzled at the king's actions, but it is revealed that Herbert was saved at the last minute by Lancelot's sidekick, Concorde. The King asks his son how he was saved, exactly, to which Herbert replies happily with a song. But the king charges at his son with a spear, preparing to kill him. Lancelot steps in to save him, then gives a tearful, heartfelt speech about sensitivity to the king on Herbert's behalf, and Lancelot is [[outing|outed]] as a [[homosexual]] in the process, an announcement celebrated in a wild disco number ''("His Name is Lancelot")''.

King Arthur begins to give up hope of ever putting on the Broadway musical and laments that he is alone, even though Patsy has been with him the entire time ''("I'm All Alone")''. The Lady Of The Lake appears and tells Arthur that he and the Knights have been in a Broadway musical all along (in some productions she also points out Patsy's presence, to which Arthur claims that he sees Patsy as "family" and thus doesn't always consider him a separate person). Patsy also reveals he is half Jewish, but didn't want to say anything to Arthur because "that's not really the sort of thing you say to a heavily armed [[Christian]]." All that's left is for King Arthur to find the Grail and marry someone. After picking up on some not-too-subtle hints, Arthur decides to marry the Lady Of The Lake after he finds the Grail ''("Twice in Every Show")''.

Reunited with his Knights, Arthur meets Tim the Enchanter who warns them of the danger of a [[Rabbit of Caerbannog|killer rabbit]]. When the rabbit bites a knight's head off, Arthur uses the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch against it, knocking down a nearby hill and revealing that the "evil rabbit" was actually a puppet controlled by a surprised puppeteer. A large stone block showing a combination of letters and numbers is also revealed. (The letters are based on the seat numbering system used by each theatre.  They are changed from performance to performance to discourage audience members from intentionally booking any of the possible seats.  The seat is typically on the aisle in one of the first few rows nearest the orchestra. In the Broadway production and on the tour it is either A101, B101, C101 or D101; i.e., Seat 101 – which is [[blocking (stage)|house right]] of the center aisle – of Rows A, B, C, or D.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130216185534/http://shubertorg.com/images/upload/sc_shubert(2).gif Schubert Theatre (New York) seating chart]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the West End Production a word is revealed – DONE, CONE or BONE, referring to D1, C1 and B1 respectively.) After pondering the final clue, Arthur admits that they're "a bit stumped with the clue thing" and asks God to "give them a hand". A large hand points to the audience and Arthur realises that the letters and numbers refer to a seat number in the audience. The grail is "found" (with some sleight of hand) under the seat and the person sitting in the seat is rewarded with a small trophy and a [[Instant camera|polaroid]] photo. ''("The Holy Grail")''. Arthur marries the Lady of the Lake, who reveals that her name is [[Guinevere]]; Lancelot marries Herbert (who finally has a chance to sing); and Sir Robin decides to pursue a career in [[musical theatre]]. Herbert's father attempts to interrupt the finale and stop all of the "bloody singing", but is hit over the head with a shovel by Lancelot, a nod to "He is Not Yet Dead".  ''("Act 2 Finale/Always Look on the Bright Side of Life (Company Bow)")''.

The overall duration of the show is about two hours plus interval time.

==Musical numbers==
Eric Idle wrote the musical's [[libretto|book and lyrics]] and collaborated with [[John Du Prez]] on the music, except for "Finland", which was written by [[Michael Palin]] for ''[[Monty Python's Contractual Obligation Album]]''; "Knights of the Round Table" and "Brave Sir Robin", which were composed by [[Neil Innes]] for ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]''; and "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life", which was originally written by Idle for the film ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]''.

In tribute to the film, where six actors played the majority of the male parts (and a few female ones), several actors play multiple roles; the only major characters not doubling are Arthur and the Lady of the Lake. In the Broadway production, the following doubling is used:

* Lancelot/2nd Sentry/The French Taunter/Knight of Ni/Tim the Enchanter
* Robin/1st Sentry/Brother Maynard/2nd Guard
* Galahad/King of Swamp Castle/Black Knight
* Patsy/Mayor of [[Finland]]/1st Guard
* Bedevere/Mrs. Galahad/Concorde
* The Historian/Prince Herbert/Not Dead Fred/Lead Minstrel/The French Taunter's Best Friend

Sara Ramirez was intended to double as a witch but this part was cut from the final script.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Several pairs of characters originally played by the same Monty Python member were reduced to one: the Dead Collector and Sir Robin (Idle), the Large Man with a Dead Body and Sir Lancelot (Cleese), and Dennis the {{Sic|?|hide=y|Politically|-}}Active Peasant and Sir Galahad ([[Michael Palin]]).

==Production history==
===Chicago===
[[File:SpamALotTicket.png|thumb|right|A ticket from the first preview show]]
Previews of the show began in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]'s Shubert Theatre (now the [[PrivateBank Theatre]]) on 21 December 2004; the show officially opened there on 9 January 2005.

Two musical numbers were dropped from Act One while the production was still in Chicago.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} During the scene set in the "Witch Village", the [[torch song]] "Burn Her!" was originally performed by Sir Bedevere, The Witch, Sir Robin, Lancelot and Villagers. At the French Castle, "The Cow Song", in a parody of a stereotypical [[film noir]]/[[cabaret]] style, was performed by The Cow and French Citizens. Before the two songs were cut in Chicago, the lead vocals in both songs were sung by [[Sara Ramirez]]. This gave her six songs in Act One, but no further appearances until scene five in Act Two, for "The Diva's Lament".

===Broadway===

The musical previewed on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], at [[New York City|New York]]'s [[Shubert Theatre (Broadway)|Shubert Theatre]], beginning 14 February 2005, ahead of an official opening on 17 March.  [[Mike Nichols]] directed, and [[Casey Nicholaw]] choreographed.  The production won the [[Tony Award for Best Musical]] and was nominated for 14 Tony Awards. The show played its final performance on 11 January 2009 after 35 previews and 1,575 performances; it was seen by more than two million people and grossed over $175 million, recouping its initial production costs in under six months.&lt;ref name="playbillend"&gt;{{cite web | last=Gans | first=Andrew | url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/123622.html | title=Spamalot Will Now Close Jan.&amp;nbsp;11, 2009 | work=[[Playbill]] | date=21 November 2008 | accessdate=25 October 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107131616/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/123622.html | archivedate=7 January 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK tour also featured for the first time a re-working of the song "You won't succeed on Broadway"  which has been renamed "You won't succeed in showbiz". The theme of the song has been changed from poking fun at the need for [[Jewish]] input into Broadway productions and instead mocks the cross over of celebrities in musicals and reality television competitions such as the [[The X Factor (UK)|X Factor]]. It notably pokes fun at reality TV celebrities including [[Simon Cowell]], [[Cheryl Cole]] and [[Susan Boyle]] (who is shot by Sir Robin when she begins to sing).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepublicreviews.com/spamalot-mayflower-theatre-southampton/|title=thepublicreviews.com|author=The Public Reviews|work=The Public Reviews|accessdate=21 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202112946/http://www.thepublicreviews.com/spamalot-mayflower-theatre-southampton/|archivedate=2 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Title ==
Book-writer and lyricist [[Eric Idle]] explained the title in a February 2004 press release:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyllama.com/news/2004/llama232.html|title=MONTY PYTHON'S SPAMALOT MUSICAL TO PREMIERE IN DECEMBER 2004 IN CHICAGO press release Thursday, 26 February 2004|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|I like the title ''Spamalot'' a lot. We tested it with audiences on my recent US tour and they liked it as much as I did, which is gratifying. After all, they are the ones who will be paying Broadway prices to see the show. It comes from a line in the movie which goes: "we eat ham, and jam, and [[Spam (Monty Python)|Spam]] a lot."}}

==Reactions by Monty Python members==
{{rquote|right|"I'm making them money, and the ungrateful bastards never thank me. Who gave them a million dollars each for 'Spamalot'?"|Eric Idle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/TV/10/24/monty.python.40/index.html | title=Monty Python's 40 years of silliness | publisher=[[CNN]] | date=24 October 2009|accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The show has had mixed reactions from Idle's former colleagues in Monty Python.

[[Terry Gilliam]], in an audio interview,&lt;ref name="tgint"&gt;[http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/?p=1095 Quickcast Interview with Terry Gilliam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115072225/http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/?p=1095 |date=15 November 2006 }} by Ken Plume&lt;/ref&gt; describes it as "Python-lite". He later told the [[BBC News]], "It helps with the pension fund, and it helps keep Python alive. As much as we'd like to pull the plug on the whole thing it carries on – it's got a life of its own."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4732374.stm |title=Battle-scarred Gilliam looks to future – Feb.&amp;nbsp;22, 2006 |date=22 February 2006 |work=Time Out | first=Neil | last=Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Jones]] – who co-directed the original film with Gilliam – expressed his opinions forthrightly in May 2005:  "''Spamalot'' is utterly pointless. It's full of air…Regurgitating Python is not high on my list of priorities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.absolutenow.com/news/20050506.html |title=Entertainment News – May&amp;nbsp;06, 2005 |date=6 May 2005 |publisher=AbsoluteNow.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120630051729/http://www.absolutenow.com/news/20050506.html |archivedate=30 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when asked whether he liked ''Spamalot'' during an interview with [[Dennis Daniel]] on 98.5 [[WBON]]-FM ''The Bone'' shortly after the musical's opening on Broadway, Jones said, "Well, I thought it was terrific good fun.  It's great to see the audience loving it. I suppose I had reservations as far as…well…the idea of doing scenes from a film on stage. I just don’t get the point of it. They do them terribly well…I mean, they really are good…but I just quite don’t understand what that's about.  It isn’t really 'Python.' It is very much Eric." Jones went on to say, "...I think the best parts of the musical are the new things. For instance, when they do the Andrew Lloyd Webber take-off and this girl comes in and sings 'Whatever Happened to My Part' since she hasn’t appeared since the opening number and she's really furious! That is one of the great moments where the show really comes alive for me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herecomethewilddogs.com/jones.htm |title=Lethally Funny Python |publisher=herecomethewilddogs.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514045958/http://www.herecomethewilddogs.com/jones.htm |archivedate=14 May 2008 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

In an October 2006 interview, [[Michael Palin]] said, "We’re all hugely delighted that ''Spamalot'' is doing so well. Because we’re all beneficiaries! It's a great show. It's not ‘Python’ as we would have written it. But then, none of us would get together and write a ‘Python’ stage show. Eric eventually ran out of patience and said, ‘Well, I’ll do it myself then.’ He sent us bits and songs and all that and we said, ‘Yeah, that's all right, have a go.’ But its success is so enormous that it took us all by surprise, including Eric, and now we’re just proud to be associated with it, rather pathetically."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/books/features/2202/3.html |title=Michael Palin: Interview – Oct.&amp;nbsp;31, 2006 |date=31 October 2006 |work=Time Out}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked by a ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'' reporter in 2008 if he had to be persuaded to provide the recorded voice of God in the musical, [[John Cleese]] said, "Yeah, that's right. And in the end I think ''Spamalot'' turned out splendidly. It's had a tremendous run. I defy anyone to go and not have a really fun evening. It's the silliest thing I’ve ever seen and I think Eric did a great job."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lvrj.com/blogs/elfman/John_Cleese_Loves_Spamalot_Doesnt_Know_Its_Closing_Also_He_Declares_Its_Not_a_Fortune_to_be_God.html |title=John Cleese Loves Spamalot... – May&amp;nbsp;5, 2008 |date=5 May 2008 |work=Time Out}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last verse of the "Finland"/"Fisch Slapping Dance" was incorporated into [[Spam (Monty Python)|Spam]] sketch for the 2014 reunion show ''[[Monty Python Live (Mostly)]]''.

==Critical reception and box-office==
The original production has been both a financial and critical success. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported advance ticket sales of $18 million, with ticket prices ranging from $36 to $179. The advance made Broadway box office history.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

The show proved to be an early success when moving to London's West End. After high advance ticket sales the show's run was extended by four weeks, four months before the run commenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=We love Spam a lot: Python musical extends run |url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2006/06/24/4276/we_love_spam_a_lot |work=Chortle: The UK Comedy Guide |date=24 June 2006 |accessdate=13 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The play makes many references to the film and other material in the Python [[Canon (fiction)|canon]], including a line from "[[The Lumberjack Song]]", nods to "[[The Ministry of Silly Walks|Ministry of Silly Walks]]", the "Election Night Special" and "[[Dead Parrot sketch]]" routines, a [[Bar (music)|bar]] from "[[Spam (Monty Python)|Spam]]" worked into "Knights of the Round Table", a rendition of the song "[[Always Look on the Bright Side of Life]]" from the film ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'' (1979), and the "Fisch Schlapping Song" which is a reference to both "[[The Fish-Slapping Dance]]" and the song "[[Finland (song)|Finland]]".  Another reference is actually part of the ''[[Playbill]]'' of the show; there are several gag pages about a musical entitled "Dik Od Triaanenen Fol (Finns Ain't What They Used To Be)". This gag programme was written by Palin, and echoes the ''faux''-Swedish subtitles in the credits of the original ''Grail'' Python film.

Broadway musical fans appreciate its references to other musicals and musical theatre in general, such as: "The Song That Goes Like This" (a spoof of [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] productions and many other Broadway [[power ballad]]s); the knights doing a dance reminiscent of ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'', and another reminiscent of ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' (including the music); Sir Lancelot's mimicking of [[Peter Allen (musician)|Peter Allen]] in "His Name Is Lancelot"; the character of Sir Not Appearing in This Show being ''[[Man of La Mancha]]'''s [[Don Quixote]]; a member of the French "army" dressed as Eponine from ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]''; and a line pulled from "Another Hundred People" from [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s ''[[Company (musical)|Company]]'' by the "damsel" Herbert. The song "You Won't Succeed (On Broadway)" also parodies ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'' and ''[[Yentl]]''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The show has not escaped criticism. In ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', Sam Anderson wrote,
"Python was formed in reaction to exactly the kind of lazy comedy represented by ''Spamalot'' — what Michael Palin once described as the 'easy, catch-phrase reaction' the members had all been forced to pander in their previous writing jobs... ''Spamalot'' is the gaudy climax of a long, unfunny tradition of post-Python exploitation – books, actions figures, video games – that treats the old material as a series of slogans to be referenced without doing any of the work that made the lines so original in the first place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2121214/ |title=And Now For Something Completely Deficient |first=Sam |last=Anderson |date=21 June 2006 |publisher=Slate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The West End version opened to rave reviews. "It's a wonderful night, and I fart in the general direction of anyone who says otherwise", wrote [[Charles Spencer (journalist)|Charles Spencer]] in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' (echoing a joke from the show).&lt;ref name="telegraph1"&gt;{{cite news |first=Charles |last=Spencer |authorlink=Charles Spencer (journalist) |title=Truly, a knight to remember |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/10/17/btspam17.xml |format=review |work=The Daily Telegraph |date= 17 October 2006| location=London | accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Paul Taylor in the ''[[Independent (newspaper)|Independent]]'', "it leaves you that high and weak with laughter, thanks not just to the Python provenance of the basic material but to the phenomenal speed, wit, cheek and showbiz knowingness of the direction, which is by the great veteran, Mike Nichols".&lt;ref name="independent1"&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Taylor |title=First Night |url=http://arts.independent.co.uk/theatre/reviews/article1879460.ece |format=review |work=The Independent |date=17 October 2006 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015164453/http://arts.independent.co.uk/theatre/reviews/article1879460.ece |archivedate=15 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] in the ''[[Guardian (newspaper)|Guardian]]'' was less enthusiastic, though, stating "while I'm happy to see musicals spoofed, the show's New York origins are clearly exposed in a would-be outre number which announces "we won't succeed in show business if we don't have any Jews": a Broadway in-joke that has little purchase this side of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]." Billington adds, "With hand on heart, I'd much rather watch Lerner and Loewe's ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'' than Eric Idle's smart-arsed ''Spamalot''."&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Billington |authorlink=Michael Billington (critic) |title=Spamalot |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/reviews/story/0,,1924220,00.html |format=review |work=The Guardian |date=17 October 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Las Vegas production was awarded the Number 1 show of 2007 by the ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===Coconut orchestra world record===
On 22 March 2006, to mark the first anniversary of the official Broadway opening, the "World's Largest Coconut Orchestra", 1,789 people clapping together half coconut shells, performed in [[Shubert Alley]], outside the theatre. The claim was officially recognised by the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]''.  This record was broken by 5,877 people in [[Trafalgar Square]] at 7&amp;nbsp;pm on 23 April 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-coconut-ensemble|title=Largest coconut ensemble {{!}} Guinness World Records|last=|first=|date=|website=Guinness World Records|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423010101/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world%2Drecords/largest%2Dcoconut%2Densemble|archive-date=23 April 2007|dead-url=yes|access-date=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, led by the cast from the London production, along with Jones and Gilliam, with the coconuts used in place of the whistles in "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life".  This formed part of London's [[St George's Day]] celebrations that year and was followed by a screening of ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail''.&lt;ref name="BBC658187"&gt;{{cite news |title=Spamalot cast sets coconut record |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6586187.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=23 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the London cast of ''Spamalot'' performed excerpts at the [[Royal Variety Performance]].

On 10 March 2007, ''Spamalot'' partnered with [[HP Sauce]] (the classic British [[Steak sauce|brown sauce]], now made in the [[Netherlands]] following a contentious decision to close its factory in Britain) to produce 1,075 limited edition bottles featuring a unique ''Spamalot'' take on the classic HP design.  The bottles were available exclusively via [[Selfridges]], London and came in a presentation box with a numbered [[Certificate of authenticity|certificate]].  1,075 was chosen to celebrate, absurdly, "1,075 years of the show running in London".

In July 2007 it was announced that the London production would solve the problem of replacing Hannah Waddingham as the Lady of the Lake through a TV talent show in Sweden. The programme, called West End Star, which began airing on [[TV3 (Sweden)|TV3]] on 8 December 2007, announced [[Nina Söderquist]] as the winner on 2 February 2008. Söderquist took up the rôle of The Lady of the Lake, with a standing ovation, on 11 February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressen.se/noje/1.1043317/nina-lysande-i-spamalotsucce Nina lysande i Spamalotsuccé, Expressen.se], 12 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===DVD===
Portions of the ''Spamalot'' [[Cast recording|original cast recording]] were featured (with accompanying [[Adobe Flash|Flash animation]]) as a special feature in the 2006 "Extraordinarily Deluxe Two-Disc Edition" DVD re-release of ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]''.

==Awards and nominations==
In the original Broadway production, Sara Ramirez sang the line, "I've no Grammy, no reward/I've no Tony Award." Ironically, the show's original cast album won the Grammy for Best Musical Theater Album in 2006 and Ramirez herself won the Tony for Best Featured Actress in 2005. The two awards led to a minor change to the song "The Diva's Lament".  Initially, the line became "My Tony Award/won't keep me out of [[Betty Ford Center|Betty Ford's]]". When [[Lauren Kennedy]] took over for [[Sara Ramirez]], it became "My predecessor won awards/and now she's in Betty Ford's" but was later changed to, "'''All our''' Tony Awards/won't keep me out of Betty Ford's."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/celebritybuzz/article/97709-DIVA-TALK-Chatting-with-Spamalots-Lauren-Kennedy-Plus-a-Powerful-Public-Sings|title=playbill.com|work=Playbill|accessdate=21 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022005757/http://www.playbill.com/celebritybuzz/article/97709-DIVA-TALK-Chatting-with-Spamalots-Lauren-Kennedy-Plus-a-Powerful-Public-Sings|archivedate=22 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the touring production, Pia Glenn sings "All our ''goddamn'' awards/won't keep me out of Betty Ford's." For a change, [[Hannah Waddingham]] in the London production sings "I'm as depressed as I can be/ I've got constant [[Premenstrual syndrome|PMT]]".

The touring production has garnered Boston's Elliot Norton Award for Outstanding Visiting Production.

==Television==
A special edition of ''[[The South Bank Show]]'' was a [[television documentary]] on the history of ''Spamalot''. It features numerous segments with Eric Idle and John Du Prez explaining the process of writing the songs, plus interviews with UK and US cast members. It included scenes from the rehearsal of the West End show, and was first broadcast on 15 October 2006.

==Film adaptation==
In May 2018, [[20th Century Fox]] announced a film adaptation is in works with Idle writing the script and [[Casey Nicholaw]] attached to direct. The film is reportedly being fast tracked with casting announced soon and shooting to begin in early 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2018/05/spamalot-movie-monty-python-fox-mean-girls-casey-nicholaw-eric-idle-1202382256/|title=Fox Sets Broadway ‘Mean Girls’ Helmer Casey Nicholaw For ‘Spamalot’ Monty Python Movie: Eric Idle Scripting|website=Deadline|last1=Busch|first1=Anita|last2=Fleming Jr.|first2=Mike|date=May 3, 2018|accessdate=May 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next month it was reported that the studio was looking to cast [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as King Arthur, [[Peter Dinklage]] as his servant Patsy and [[Tiffany Haddish]] as the Lady of the Lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/spamalot-movie-cast-cumberbatch-dinklage-haddish/|title=Spamalot Movie Eyes Benedict Cumberbatch, Peter Dinklage &amp; More|website=Screen Rant|last=Schaefer|first=Sandy|date=June 15, 2018|accessdate=June 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuit==
In 2013 the Pythons lost a legal case to [[Mark Forstater]], the producer of ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'', over royalties for ''Spamalot''. He was paid 1/14 of the portion of the profits paid to the Pythons. The court ruled that he was a full Python partner and was to be paid 1/7 of the portion paid to the Pythons. They owed a combined £800,000 in legal fees and back royalties to Forstater, prompting them to produce ''[[Monty Python Live (Mostly)]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=John Cleese: Monty Python reunion is happening because of my £800,000 legal bill |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/john-cleese-monty-python-reunion-3591253 |quote=Last July, the Pythons lost a royalties case to Mark Forstater, who produced 1975 film Monty Python And The Holy Grail. ... |newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]] |date=May 23, 2014 |accessdate=2014-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=royal&gt;{{cite web

'''''Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd v OK Bazaars (1929) Ltd'''''&lt;ref&gt;2000 (4) SA 382 (W).&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in the [[South African law of delict]], particularly the area of [[negligent misstatement]]. It was heard in the [[Witwatersrand Local Division]] by André Gautschi AJ from 8 February – 16 February 2000, with judgment handed down on 17 March. JM Suttner SC (with him R. Hutton) appeared for the plaintiff, and LRG Serrurier SC (with him KJ Trisk) for the defendant.

Given that materiality, intention to induce and inducement are requirements for actionable misrepresentation inducing a contract, there was no logical reason the court could find why they should not be elements of the act to be proven (as opposed to the unlawfulness component) of the delictual action for pure economic loss arising out of a negligent misstatement. If that were the case, the plaintiff would be required in respect of the act to establish

* a statement
* which was false;
* that the misstatement was material in the sense that it would have influenced or induced a reasonable man to act or rely thereon;
* that the defendant intended that the plaintiff, or a person in the position of the plaintiff, to act or rely thereon; and
* that the plaintiff in fact acted or relied thereon: that is, he was in fact induced.

These elements would not form part of the enquiry into unlawfulness.

==Plot==
In a surreal, [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]], [[Thessaloniki]] has its very own superhero: Super Demetrios. Posing as Dimitris Christoforidis, [[journalist]] for the Golden Jerusalem magazine, he fights for truth, justice and the Greco-Christian ideal. In the dark of the night, the city's worst nightmare returns. Captain F.ROM is back, determined to meet his long-awaited goal: claiming his true name. The two protagonists are drawn into a conflict that toys with the viewer's patience until the very climax of the film, in an archetypal battle between good and evil.

==Development==
''Super Demetrios'' was created by a cinematic group called "OtiNaNai Productions" (literally: Whatever Productions). They are a group of friends from various Greek cities that met while in Thessaloniki as university students in the early 2000s. The group was formed initially by Georgios Papaioannou from [[Kavala]] and Mitsos Papavasileiou from [[Livadeia]], both students of [[civil engineering]], along with Dimitrios Vainas, Panos Kechagiopoulos, Charalambos Kydonakis, a student of [[architecture]] from [[Crete]] and Charalampos Papapostolou. They produced various short and feature [[DIY]] comedies and parodies in a philosophy similar to [[Monty Python]]'s.&lt;ref name="filmboy interview"&gt;{{cite web

The idea of Super Demetrios came in 2007 while the team was working on a different script. One of the lesser characters of that script showed a lot of potential so they abandoned that script and started anew the story of Super Demetrios.&lt;ref name="filmboy interview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="athensvoice 2011"&gt;{{cite web

In June 2008 they begun shooting in Thessaloniki. In December Georgios Papaioannou had to move to [[Athens]] for professional reasons while Mitsos Papavasileiou had already had moved to Livadeia so they stopped shooting.&lt;ref name="athensvoice interview"/&gt;

In October 2009 they decided to resume shooting and they started a series of scheduled trips to Thessaloniki, mostly on weekends and holidays. Since all cast and crew collaborated for free and everything was done in a [[DIY]] philosophy, the film's budget of €2000 was merely the cost of those trips. The shooting concluded in October 2010, more than two years after it begun. After that Georgios Papaioannou begun editing it for almost a year.&lt;ref name="athensvoice interview"/&gt;

In Spring 2011, since the word of the very first Greek superhero movie had already been spread among fans, the movie was invited to the Den Yparxei Film Festival in Athens. During that time only one full scene was complete with visual effects and compositing (the space shuttle scene) and therefore only that scene could be screened in the festival. Nevertheless, the movie was awarded a special prize for the ''Best Picture Yet To See''.

In November 2011 a [[rough cut]] of ''Super Demetrios'' was first publicly screened at the 52nd Thessaloniki International Film Festival.

After the festival Georgios Papaioannou resumed editing the movie for a while. They also replaced some of the songs used in the festival copy with original scores so as in the [[Film editing#Final cut|final cut]] all music was either original or [[royalty-free]].

==Distribution==
Following the awards the film was distributed by the Thessaloniki International Film Festival to several Greek cities.

After that, OtiNaNai Productions got its own distribution in two cinemas in Athens and Thessaloniki at the same time.

The film was also invited to many film clubs around Greece.

* The movie was distributed freely on the Internet on [[October 26]], the [[name day]] of Super Demetrios/Dimitris Christophorides, i.e. the [[feast day]] of [[Saint Demetrius]].&lt;ref name="athensvoice interview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="freecinema"&gt;{{cite web

* The [[villain]]'s title is "Captain F.ROM" (pronounced "fee-rom") and his constant goal throughout the film is to be recognised by his true name. This is a [[satire]] on the [[Macedonia naming dispute]], due to the acronym "[[FYROM]]" being often used to refer to the country.&lt;ref name="Flix"/&gt;

* The protagonist's real name is "Dimitris Christophorides" while his [[priest]] [[step father]] is called "Papa-Michael" (Father Michael) so his full name would be "Dimitris Papa-Michael Christophorides" (we see that briefly in a [[close up]] of an official document) which is a homage to [[Dimitris Papamichael]], one of the most famous Greek actors of the "golden era" of Greek cinema.
* One of the very first scenes, that shows a [[space shuttle]] unfolding itself over the orb of the Earth (resembling a giant [[frappé coffee]] hand mixer) while [[Richard Strauss|Strauss]]'s ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra]]'' plays in the background, is a homage to [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968).
* Tsoko's dying scene is almost an exact copy of [[Colonel Kurtz]]'s dying scene of [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s film ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979).
* The long [[duel]] scene at the end of the film has the form of a [[mexican standoff]]. It takes place in a dusty area, lasts for several minutes, with lots of extreme close ups, and with the film's [[main theme]] played in a [[Ennio Morricone]] way, with a big [[crescendo]] at the end. The whole style of the scene is a homage to [[Sergio Leone]]'s [[spaghetti western]]s, especially ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966).
* The [[breaking the fourth wall]] scene near the end of the film, where the director and crew give acting directions to the actor portraying Super Demetrios is a homage to the similar ending scene of the film ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' (1976). The directions given are actually the most basic [[Stanislavski's system]]'s list of techniques which is another meta-reference [[Self-criticism|self-criticizing]]&lt;ref name="To Vima guerilla"&gt;{{cite web

==Reception==
Due to the long time taken for development, even before its release, ''Super Demetrios'' had already had a strong [[fan base]], mostly among the Thessaloniki [[campus]] students.

In mid 2011, a major Athenian newspaper did a two-page tribute to ''Super Demetrios'', the so-called "first Greek superhero film", making it known to the general public of Athens.

Upon its release at the 52nd [[Thessaloniki International Film Festival]] all screenings were crowded with a lot of people watching it standing up on the stairs. The film got the highest number of audience votes&lt;ref name="Proto Plano"&gt;{{cite magazine

===Critical reception===
''Super Demetrios'' received broadly positive reviews in the mainstream press.

Giannis Zoumboulakis from ''To Vima'' newspaper described it as "the most pleasant Greek production in the last Thessaloniki Film Festival".&lt;ref name="To Vima guerilla"/&gt;

Ilias Fragoulis from ''Free Cinema'' called it "the most epic sci-fi [[b-movie]] of Greek cinema, after ''[[The Attack of the Giant Moussaka]]''".&lt;ref name="freecinema"/&gt;

Kostas Tsokos of ''FilmBoy'' gave it a 7/10 saying among others that "First of all, everythings shows love and affection for the genre, and for cinema in general" and that "acting is a bit flat and dry but in most cases fits the movie's style. But after all it's a superhero parody and all this makes it more cult and less pretentious."&lt;ref name="filmboy review"/&gt;

Georgia Myridaki from ''Fringe'' gave it 5/5 writing that "it has tons of [[caustic humor]], mocks and plays very cleverly with stereotypes that are inextricably linked with this city, like [[nationalism]], strong Christian faith, surrealism" while "leaving aside clichés."&lt;ref name="Fringe"&gt;{{cite web

Stratos Kersanidis from ''AlterThess'' calls it "cult cinema in all its glory" and a "thoroughly poorly done film" that satirizes shamelessly and in a "blasphemous" and funny way the [[conservatism]] and other aspects of Thessaloniki.&lt;ref name="alterthess"&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Super Demetrios Masterclass IMG 5321 2.jpg|thumb|Georgios Papaioannou giving the ''Super Demetrios'' master class]] As a result of the film's success, Georgios Papaioannou, a successful [[PhD]] in [[civil engineering]],&lt;ref name="athensvoice 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="athensvoice interview"/&gt; decided to pursue a career in [[visual effects]]. After his visit to Los Angeles invited by the Los Angeles Greek Film Festival he studied in [[Gnomon School of Visual Effects]] in [[Hollywood]], and now he is working as a VFX expert in the industry. His most notable work is for the film ''[[The Expendables 3]]'' (2014).

In May 2015, ''Super Demetrios'' became an academic subject. Invited by the Public [[Vocational school|Vocational Institute]] of [[Agios Dimitrios]], Georgios Papaioannou gave a big [[master class]] on the VFX of Super Demetrios to students of 8 departments of [[computer graphics]] from several Public Vocational Institutes of Athens.&lt;ref name="sdm"&gt;{{cite web

In 2001, during the [[centennial]] celebration of the [[National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues]], [[Minor League Baseball]] tasked [[baseball]] [[historian]]s [[Bill Weiss]] and [[Marshall Wright]] to develop a list of the top 100 best minor league baseball teams of the century. Their list includes 69 distinct franchises from across the United States and in Canada and Mexico. There are representatives from every decade of the century.

Weiss and Wright developed a statistical formula to evaluate teams. First, a rating was given to each league. They assigned 100 points for [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] leagues down to 20 points for [[Class D (baseball)|Class D]] leagues. The equivalent classifications of each league were used to adjust for changes in the minor league structure since 1900. Next, individual teams were graded based on [[winning percentage]] and total wins in order to assess each team's strength against its league and its season-long performance. The combination of these three metrics resulted in a statistical list of the century's top teams. Weiss and Wright further took into account intangibles such as winning a pennant, significant achievements, or reputation in creating their final list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.milb.com/milb/history/top_about.jsp |title=About the Top 100 Teams |publisher=MiLB.com |date=2001 |accessdate=May 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Of the 69 franchises to make the list, 14 appeared more than once. The [[Baltimore Orioles (minor league)|Baltimore Orioles]] took 6 places on the list, the most of any team, followed by the [[Fort Worth Cats (Texas League)|Ft. Worth Panthers]] and [[Toronto Maple Leafs (International League)|Toronto Maple Leafs]] (5), [[Newark Bears (International League)|Newark Bears]] and [[San Francisco Seals (baseball)|San Francisco Seals]] (4); [[Kansas City Blues (American Association)|Kansas City Blues]], [[Los Angeles Angels (PCL)|Los Angeles Angels]], and [[St. Paul Saints (1901–60)|St. Paul Saints]] (3); and [[Charlotte Hornets (baseball)|Charlotte Hornets]], [[Columbus Red Birds|Columbus Senators/Red Birds]], [[Houston Buffaloes]], [[Indianapolis Indians]], [[Memphis Chicks]], and [[Milwaukee Brewers (American Association)|Milwaukee Brewers]] (2). Thirty leagues are represented on the list. The league with the most entrants is the [[International League]] with 17. The other top leagues are the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]] (13); [[Pacific Coast League]] (10); [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]] and [[Texas League]] (8); [[California League]], [[Western Association]], and [[Western League (1900–1958)|Western League]] (4). Thirty-one teams competed at the [[Double-A (baseball)|Double-A]] classification level, the most of any class, followed by [[Class A (baseball)|Class A]] (24); [[Class C (baseball)|Class C]] (12); [[Class B (baseball)|Class B]] (11); [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] (10); [[Class D (baseball)|Class D]] (7); [[Class A1 (baseball)|Class A1]] and independent (2); and [[Class A-Advanced]] (1). Twenty-seven teams competed in the 1920s, the most of any decade, followed by the 1940s (16); 1930s (13); 1900s and 1950s (10); 1910s and 1980s (6); 1970s (5); 1990s (4); and 1960s (3).

'''The Racecourse Colliery''' is an exhibit located at the [[Black Country Living Museum]]

==Original mine shafts at the Black Country Living Museum==
The [[Black Country Living Museum]] has more than 40 old mine shafts on its site,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Racecourse Colliery|url=http://www.bclm.co.uk/locations/racecourse-colliery/7.htm#.UT4KVDcTxnY|publisher=Black Country Living Museum|accessdate=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have largely been lost, in-filled, collapsed, stabilised or capped. One of the original surviving shafts has been used to create the Racecourse Colliery exhibit. It was originally the shaft of one of the [[Earl of Dudley|Earl of Dudley's]] small pits, Coneygree Colliery Pit No 126, which operated between 1860 and 1902. After the pit was abandoned, all the surface landmarks were removed and the shaft itself was eventually filled in.&lt;ref name=Colliery&gt;{{cite book|last=Black Country Living Museum|title=Black Country Living Museum Guide|year=2012|location=Dudley|publisher=Black Country Living Museum|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work started on the creation of the Racecourse Colliery exhibit in 1979 and, with the exception of the head frame, all work was carried out on Sundays by volunteers from the Birmingham Enterprise Club and the Friends of the Black Country Museum Mining Group. The [[colliery]] was re-created following exactly the same sequence as the creation of an actual working Black Country pit. The shaft was re-opened to a depth of 64 feet (its original depth was between 100–120 feet). The lining brickwork was also repaired. The [[coal]] obtainable from this pit is Bottom Coal- about 100&amp;nbsp;ft down. Close to this exhibit another original shaft was used to create Racecourse Colliery Number Two Pit, also referred to as Brook Shaft. Here coal was worked at 30&amp;nbsp;ft and has 8&amp;nbsp;ft of Bottom Coal showing. Moulds from this shaft were used to create the 'coal' for the Museum's underground drift mine experience, 'Into the Thick'.

Other principle coal seams in the [[South Staffordshire Coalfield]] include Brooch, Flying Reed, Upper Heathen, Stinking (sulphur), New Mine, Fireclay and the famous Thick Coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=British Geological Survey|title=Mineral Resource Information for Development Plans: West Midlands Resources and Constraints|url=http://www.bgs.ac.uk/downloads/start.cfm?id=2625|publisher=HMSO|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features of Racecourse Colliery==
The buildings and other features of the Racecourse Colliery are either replicas of known mining landmarks, or have been devised on the basis of photographs and existing knowledge of old Black Country pits. The exception to this is the [[Weighbridge]] House which is a historic building, relocated from Rolfe Street in [[Smethwick]], where it stood in the [[Birmingham Canal Navigations|Birmingham Canal Navigation's]] wharf yard. It was probably built in the early years of the 20th century. The reconstruction at Black Country Living Museum has been called Racecourse Colliery because the land on which it stands was originally the [[Earl of Dudley]]'s private racecourse, which was closed when the railway line from [[Dudley]] to [[Wolverhampton]] was built in 1852.&lt;ref name="Black Country Living Museum 1–4"&gt;{{cite book|last=Black Country Living Museum|title=Racecourse Colliery Guide Notes|year=unpublished|publisher=Black Country Living Museum|location=Dudley|pages=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manager's Office===
This pit features a  Manager's Office and a Weighbridge Office that sit side by side. Many of the small pits did not have a resident manager instead, one manager would look after a number of pits. One of the manager's jobs was to make sure that all the mine plans were kept up-to-date, these plans would have been kept in the office. There are no [[safety lamps]] in the office; many [[Black Country]] pits did not use them as working lights because the shallow workings enabled some of the volatile gases to escape to the surface. Mines like this were known as 'naked lamp' mines, i.e. the miners would have to make do with [[tallow candle]]s set in a lump of clay.&lt;ref name="Black Country Living Museum 1–4"/&gt;

Mines were run on a day-to-day basis by the [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/butty butty], this position can be compared to the modern-day contactor who would agree to sell coal to the mine owner at a fixed price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The History of Wolverhampton|title=History of Coal Mining in Wolverhampton|url=http://www.wolverhamptonhistory.org.uk/work/industry/mining|work=www.wolverhamptonhistory.org.uk|accessdate=2013-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The butty would also hire and fire the men as required and at a pit like this, between six and 30 men could be employed. Every morning before the start of the shift the butty would go down with his safety lamp and check the workings for gases and to see if any more [[pit props]] were required.&lt;ref name="Black Country Living Museum 1–4"/&gt;

At 6.30 in the morning the miners started work. They were lowered down the [[Shaft mining|shaft]] in a cage (by the head frame). These cages were also used to bring up coal as it was mined. A [[Winding engine]] housed in a brick building would operate the cage.&lt;ref name="Black Country Living Museum 1–4"/&gt;

===The Winding Engine===
The winding house at the Museum is a replica based on the one that used to stand at [[Amblecote]] Colliery No.2 Pit. At the back of the building is the large drum which holds the wire rope that runs over the wheel at the top of the head frame and lifts the cage. This drum is rotated by a [[Steam engine]] inside the engine house. The steam to power the engine would have come from the [[Egg-ended boiler]] in front of the engine house. Heating all the water in the boiler to convert it to steam took a long time so the fire beneath the boiler was kept lit all the time. The engine operator kept the fire stoked during the day, but at about 3pm when the shift ended the fire would be banked up and left overnight. The Museum does not use this boiler to raise steam when it operates the colliery winder, instead a smaller [[Vertical boiler]] is used which is housed at the rear of the engine house.

Apart from using the [[winding engine]] to raise and lower the miners and the coal tubs, the winding engine would also have been used to remove water from the pit. This was done by a process called tanking. After 1864 all coal miners had to have two head frames and two shafts to provide an extra way out of the workings in an emergency. The second shaft would be situated over the lowest point of the pit so that all the water would gather there in a sump. The winding engine would lower a [[tank]] into the sump, a special valve enabled the tank to fill with water, the tank was then raised and someone on the surface pulled a lever one the tank to discharge the water from the pit. There is one of these tanks lying at the side of the miner’s [[wikt:hovel|hovel]].

To the side of the brick engine shed is a small corrugated building which houses the engine and fan. This was installed to provide adequate ventilation in a mine. The engine is from [[Amblecote]] [[Fireclay]] Pit c1860 and was made by J. C. Stark of Torquay. It was found dismantled in the Orangery at [[Shugborough]]. The fan sucks the air from the pit. The upright part is called the evaze and is designed to dissipate the air.&lt;ref name="Black Country Living Museum 1–4"/&gt;

===The Head Frame===

The [[Headframe]] is a replica of the one that used to stand at the Amblecote Colliery Pit No.12. At the bottom of the shaft was the on-setter, the man whose job it was to load the coal tubs into the cages. When the cage was loaded he would shout or signal (via the bell fixed to the head frame) to the man at the top the shaft, the banks man. He in turn would signal to the engine operator to raise the cage. At the top the banks man would take the truck from the cage, push it along the rails to the land sale wharf. The rails are laid on a slope above the wharf and loaded up with coal.&lt;ref name="Black Country Living Museum 1–4"/&gt;

===The Hovel===
The miners' [[wikt:hovel|Hovel]] is the workmen’s mess room and the place where miners could dry their wet pit clothes at the end of the day. A fire was kept lit in the hovel and wet clothes left hanging in there overnight were usually dry again by morning. The men could also brew a hot drink in the hovel, eat their 'snap'(lunch usually in a tin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=BBC|title=The history of the world in 100 objects|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/bw0MsbpbSI-YkG1xFkESCA|work=bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2013-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or cloth covered bowl) or fry bacon and egg on a shovel over the fire. In some pits with a good boss, a barrel of beer may be provided to take underground.&lt;ref name="Black Country Living Museum 1–4"/&gt;

===The Blacksmith’s Shop===

The [[blacksmith|Blacksmith's Shop]] was for keeping the miners' [[picks]] sharp, they had to be kept sharp to cut the [[coal]]. Tools were sharpened by heating and hammering rather than sharpening with a file. The tools had to be kept sharp in order to get fast results. If a pit did not have a blacksmith the picks would be regularly taken along to the nearest local blacksmith for sharpening. The forge would also be used for making or repairing wrought iron equipment or tub bodies. Rattle chain (Black Country term for flat winding chain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moss|first=Ron|title=Chain and anchor making in the Black Country|year=2006|publisher=Sutton|location=Stroud|isbn=0750942215|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; ) would have been repaired by the blacksmith. The chain was wound on a narrow reel similar to camera film, not on a drum, and rattled as it wound. Metal tyres for wooden wheels were heated on the forge and the shrunk onto the wooden wheels.&lt;ref name="Black Country Living Museum 1–4"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1345">A '''[[training]] manual''' is a [[book]] or [[book]]let of instructions, designed to improve the quality of a performed task.  Training manuals are widely used, including in [[business]] and the [[military]].

A training manual may be particularly useful as:
* an introduction to subject matter prior to training
* an outline to be followed during training
* a reference to subject matter after training
* a general reference document
* a system to reference

A training manual may form an important part of a formal training programme. For example, it may help ensure consistency in presentation of content. It may also ensure that all training information on [[skill]]s, processes, and other information necessary to perform tasks is together in one place.

Training manuals can be designed to be used as:
*Work books &amp;ndash; used in training sessions to provide basic information, examples and exercises.
*Self-paced guides: designed for trainees to work through on their own.
*Reference manuals: for containing detailed information on processes and procedures.
*Handouts: provide general information to support training done during the session.
*Job aids: provide step-by-step instructions to be used in the [[wiktionary:Workplace|workplace]].

'''Type-in traffic''' is a term describing visitors landing at a [[web site]] by entering a keyword or phrase (with no spaces or a hyphen in place of a space) in the [[web browser]]'s address bar (and adding .com or in a [[mobile browser]] address bar and adding [[.mobi]] or any other gTLD (generic top-level domain) or ccTLD extension (country code top-level domain); rather than following a [[hyperlink]] from another [[web page]], using a browser [[Internet bookmark|bookmark]], or a search-box search. Type-in traffic is a form of [[direct navigation]].

Example: If you are interested in [[Widget (economics)|widgets]], then instead of performing a search-engine search for the term 'widgets' you might type 'widgets.com' or 'widgets.mobi' in your mobile browser address bar to see if such a [[web site]] exists, and, if so, what content is there. From another perspective, if you are in the business of selling widgets, then owning the domain name 'widgets.com' or 'widgets.mobi' and having an active website at that address would be a desirable thing, as you could take advantage of the type-in traffic this name receives.  This simple example holds true for virtually all products and services.

==History==

Prior to 2002 most [[web browsers]] resolved type-in search strings via DNS to the ''.com'' [[top-level domain]]; thus entering 'mysearchterm' in the web browser's address bar would typically lead the user to &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://mysearchterm.com/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. This behavior changed as browsers evolved based on the 'default search engine' setting in the web browser's properties. Thus entering 'mysearchterm' in the address bar would now lead to an error page, as the computer is looking &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://mysearchterm/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; or to results from a [[search engine]] if a default is set. Much of Microsoft's [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] (formerly as [[MSN]] then [[Windows Live Search]]) high usage rank results from the error page traffic delivered via their dominant [[Internet Explorer]] browser. A significant percentage of Google's traffic originates from redirects via the [[Firefox]] and [[Google Chrome]] browsers and from the [[Google toolbar]],&lt;ref name="dailydomainer"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailydomainer.com/200784-microsoft-quietly-making-untold-millions.html |title=Microsoft Quietly Making Untold Millions |accessdate=2007-06-14 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121194802/http://www.dailydomainer.com/200784-microsoft-quietly-making-untold-millions.html |archivedate=January 21, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; all of which take over type-in traffic search strings to the browser address bar.

In the last few years advertisers, publishers and ad networks such as [[MSN]], [[AOL]], [[Google]] and [[Yahoo!|Yahoo]] have awoken to the power of displaying relevant advertising to highly targeted type-in traffic from [[domain names]], browser address bar searches and error traffic.

* In November 2004 Marchex acquired the generic domain name portfolio of Name Development Ltd., a little-known [[British Virgin Islands]] company, for 164 million dollars, predominantly for its 100,000+ domain name portfolio generating 17 million type-in traffic visitors each month.
* In 2005, Highland Capital and [[Summit Partners]], two [[venture capital]] firms, acquired a controlling interest in BuyDomains, paying an undisclosed sum for its domain name portfolio.
* In August 2005, industry trade journals such as dnjournal, dnforum and domainstate reported that sale volumes and prices of existing generic domain-names were rising rapidly as a result of type-in traffic [[monetization]] opportunities.  Small [[webmasters]] can buy a domain name with type-in traffic and utilize [[Google]]'s [[AdSense]] product, or any of several traffic aggregators to display relevant advertising to the trickle of visitors coming to their domain names. Many small [[publishers]] are generating thousands of dollars each month in revenue with very little effort by building websites that serve relevant advertising to their type-in traffic visitors.
* In April 2006 DemandMedia.com purchased the domain name registrar [[eNom]] as a tool for acquiring type-in traffic and for a portfolio of thousands of type-in traffic [[domain names]]. In July 2006 Demand Media purchased Bulkregister.com, another top ten ICANN accredited registrar.
* In May 2006 iREIT acquired Netster.com, predominantly for the thousands of generic type-in domain name names contained within the broader Netster domain name portfolio.[http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/060519/nyf026.html?.v=47]
* Google's entry into the small publisher monetization space came as a result of their purchase of Applied Semantics (oingo.com) in 2003. The [[drop registrar]] phenomenon is directly related to the value and desirability of type-in traffic domain names.
* Type-in traffic does not differentiate between [[trademark]] traffic and [[Generic brand|generic]] traffic as it relates to domain names.  For example, the act of registering &lt;tt&gt;[[Coca-Cola|coca-cola]].com&lt;/tt&gt; for one's own commercial gain would be considered [[cybersquatting]]. However, the act of registering &lt;tt&gt;softdrinks.com&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;cola.com&lt;/tt&gt; would likely be a defensible acquisition of a generic domain name for type-in traffic generation or resale business opportunities. Many companies have begun to actually buy backlinks from type-in traffic sites in an effort to capture more unique visitors from reasonably targeted networks.

[[File:IMG PonteVecchio.JPG|thumb|Street view of the [[Ponte Vecchio]] as seen from the Vasari Corridor]]
The '''Vasari Corridor''' ({{lang-it|Corridoio Vasariano}}) is an elevated [[skyway|enclosed passageway]] in [[Florence]], central [[Italy]], which connects the [[Palazzo Vecchio]] with the [[Palazzo Pitti]]. Beginning on the south side of the Palazzo Vecchio, it then joins the [[Uffizi Gallery]]  and leaves on its south side, crossing the Lungarno dei Archibusieri and then following the north bank of the [[River Arno]] until it crosses the river at [[Ponte Vecchio]]. At the time of construction, the corridor had to be built around the [[Torre dei Mannelli]], using brackets, because the owners of the tower refused to alter it. The corridor covers up part of the façade of the [[Santa Felicita, Florence|Church of Santa Felicita]]. The corridor then snakes its way over rows of houses in the [[Oltrarno]] district, becoming narrower, to finally join the [[Palazzo Pitti]]. Most of it is closed to visitors.

==History and overview==
[[Image:Firenze.Arno.jpg|thumb|The ''Corridoio'' seen from the [[Ponte Vecchio]].]]
The Vasari Corridor was built in five months by order of Duke [[Cosimo I de' Medici]] in 1565, to the design of [[Giorgio Vasari]].  It was commissioned in connection with the marriage of Cosimo's son, [[Francesco I de' Medici|Francesco]], with [[Joanna of Austria, Grand Duchess of Tuscany|Johanna of Austria]]. 
The idea of an enclosed passageway was motivated by the Grand Duke's desire to move freely between his residence and the government palace, when, like most monarchs of the period, he felt insecure in public, in his case especially because he had replaced the [[Republic of Florence]]. The meat market of Ponte Vecchio was moved to avoid its smell reaching into the passage, its place being taken by the goldsmith shops that still occupy the bridge. At the latter extremity, the corridor was forced to pass around the Mannelli's Tower, after the staunch opposition of that family to its destruction.

In the middle of Ponte Vecchio, the corridor is characterized by a series of panoramic windows facing the [[Arno]], in the direction of the [[Ponte Santa Trinita]]. These replaced the smaller windows of the original construction in 1939, by order of [[Benito Mussolini]]. The larger windows were installed for an official visit to Florence by [[Adolf Hitler]] to give him a panoramic view of the river.

After the Ponte Vecchio the Corridor passes over the [[loggia]]to of the church of [[Santa Felicita]]; at that point it had a balcony, protected by a thick railing, looking into the interior of the church, in order to allow the Grand Duke's family to follow services  without mixing with the populace.

In its Uffizi section, the Vasari Corridor is used to exhibit the museum's famous collection of [[self-portrait]]s.

The area closest to the Uffizi entrance was heavily damaged by [[Massacre of Via dei Georgofili|a bombing commissioned by the Italian mafia on the night of May 27th, 1993]].  When a car bomb was detonated next to the Torre dei Pulci, located between via Lambertesca and via de' Georgofili, this section of the Uffizi Gallery was among the buildings damaged, and several artworks in the Corridor were destroyed. These paintings, some hopelessly damaged, have been pieced back together and placed back on their original spot to serve as a reminder of the event.

{{redirect|Vestibular|the human sensory system|Vestibular system}}
The '''Vestibular''' (from {{lang-pt|vestíbulo}}, "entrance hall") is a [[competitive examination]] and is the primary and widespread entrance system used by [[Brazil]]ian [[university|universities]] to select the students [[extrance exam|admitted]]. 

The Vestibular usually takes place from November to January, right before the start of school year in February or March, although certain universities hold it every semester.&lt;ref name="UEM's Yearly Vestibular Calendar"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vestibular.uem.br/cvumenuvestanteriores.html | title=Maringá State University (UEM) Vestibular calendar showing that there are two vestibular exams each year : Vestibular de Inverno (Winter's Vestibular) and Vestibular de Verão (Summer's) (in Portuguese) | accessdate=July 2, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610005029/http://www.vestibular.uem.br/cvumenuvestanteriores.html | archive-date=June 10, 2013 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The exams often span several days, usually two, with different disciplines being tested each day.

==Structure==
Several Brazilian universities follow the [[FUVEST]] ([[University of São Paulo]]'s entry exam) pattern, which is divided into two stages or "phases". The first stage consists of 90 multiple choice questions, including subjects such as [[Portuguese Language]], [[Portuguese Literature]] and [[Brazilian Literature]]; [[Math]], [[History]], [[Geography]], [[Biology]], [[Physics]], [[Chemistry]] and [[Foreign Language]]. The answers are marked on an answer card, and they are graded afterwards by an automated [[optical reader]]. Some institutions establish a cutoff score for the first stage. Students who score below that are automatically eliminated and do not proceed to the second stage, even if the maximum number of candidates has not been reached, although some schools make exceptions in the rare case of most candidates scoring below the cutoff.

In some universities, the Vestibular may include only a single-stage exam where the scores for each subject tested are adjusted by weights depending on the student's course choice. For example, on the brazilians unities of [[Pontifical university|PUC]] (known as one of the most prestigious private universities in Brazil) has a Vestibular consisting of 45 multiple choice questions, one written question about Chemistry and Biology, one about Maths and Physics, and another about History and Geography, in addition to a student-written essay on a provided theme. All of that is done in one single day. Another example is Mackenzie, considered one of the best private universities in the country: its Vestibular consists of 60 multiple choice questions and a student-written essay. 

In some military engineering colleges such as [[Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica|ITA]] and [[Instituto Militar de Engenharia|IME]], the Vestibular includes exams in Math, Physics, Chemistry, Portuguese and English only. Those exams are mostly write-in and demand more from the students when compared to ordinary vestibular exams of the same subjects by other universities, being heavily influenced by [[List of mathematics competitions|mathematics competitions]] questions. In the other hand, colleges with a humanities focused curriculum, such as [[Escola Superior de Propaganda e Marketing|ESPM]], only include Portuguese, English, History, Geography, Math and culture. This is done in order to let the student focus on the subjects of the college's interest while preparing for the exams.

University candidates must choose their majors by the time they sign in for the vestibular, and they cannot change their choice except through a very bureaucratic process of internal transfers within the university. Some exceptions exist, such as [[Engineering]] in some universities, where the engineering major is chosen only after a three or four semester period. Language studies is another exception: you sign up for Languages, and choose your focus later on, which could be Portuguese and English, Portuguese and French, Portuguese and Italian, amongst many others.

Throughout the last decades, there has always been a gap between the few vacancies offered and the overwhelmingly high and growing demand for high quality and tuition-free [[public universities]]. The competition goes as far as having more than 150 candidates per vacancy for the most sought-after careers, such as [[medicine]].

==Origin==
The '''Vestibular''' was implanted primarily as a way to prevent [[nepotism]] or some other form of unfair or beneficial selection of candidates. It was considered by law the only authorized selection method until 1996, when the new Education Law was passed.

==Criticism ==
While the Vestibular is generally considered to be a fair and unbiased system to select students due to the standardized nature of the tests, there are a few controversies surrounding  it.

There is some criticism to the alleged standardization of the high school curriculum for the whole country to match the Vestibular agenda. As most types of academic evaluation, the vestibulars suffers from the same limitations as a regular [[Test (student assessment)|test]]; that is, factors such as [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] come into play. It also seems to favor candidates that come from a wealthier background, who had access to better and deeper education in private schools, as opposed to the comparatively poor public high school educational system, although many university boards{{says who|date=September 2015}} claim that it doesn't matter which background the candidates have, since their Vestibular aims to select the best students based solely on their knowledge. 

To ease this problem, some universities such as the [[Federal University of Minas Gerais]], provide a 10–15% bonus for students who received their middle and high education in public schools. There is also the alternative of taking classes at [[cram school]]s called ''cursinhos'' (a brazilian word that usually means "Vestibular course"). Those are revisions of Vestibular subjects, given through periods of 9 months (the regular year-long one), 6 months (the semi-intensive one), and 3 months (known as intensive). These courses are given usually for the most prestigious schools and can be done after concluding high school or as a complement of the last year of it.

==Racial quotas==
Racial and social quotas are a very controversial subject in Brazil. They were implemented by the government as an attempt to minimize the gap between students. That way, students who had their high school education entirely at public schools get quotas. Also, African and Indigenous Brazilian descendants gain a small percentage of bonuses on their Vestibular. That is considered an [[affirmative action]] policy.

=== Court challenge ===

In August 2005, at [[Universidade Federal do Paraná]], a student was granted by a federal [[court]] the right to be admitted at the university because she had a better score on the Vestibular than several other freshmen that took advantage of their quotas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bemparana.com.br/index.php?n=55873&amp;t=estudante-ganha-acao-contra-sistema-de-cotas-da-ufpr Estudante ganha ação contra sistema de cotas da UFPR]&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2012 a law was approved that gave quotas to students who came from public schools. The federal universities (such as UFRJ, UNIFESP, UFPR, UFRGS...) will have to save half of the vacancies for those students. State-owned establishments, such as the [[University of São Paulo]], are not currently forced to abide by this law.

==New ENEM (Novo ENEM)==
{{main|Enem (exam){{!}}ENEM}}
The Ministry of Education and Culture of Brazil (MEC) proposed in 2009 that the universities should use the ENEM (National High School Exam), a non-mandatory national exam, as a standard university entrance qualification test. The "new ENEM", as it is known, is composed of 180 multiple choice questions in five main areas (natural sciences, human sciences, math, Portuguese and either English or Spanish as a foreign language) and an essay.

The proposal's main objective is to democratize access to higher education, opportunities for federal jobs, academic mobility and induce the restructuring of the curricula of high school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seruniversitario.com.br Ser Universitário]&lt;/ref&gt;

The universities have the autonomy to choose whether or not they want to use the exam, and if they want to, they can also choose the way it is used:
* As a single phase, with a unified system of selection, electronic and online;
* As a first phase;
* Combined with the university's test (using it to admit only part of its students or as part of the overall grade, along with a vestibular);
* As a single phase for the remaining chairs.

'''WebCite''' is an on-demand archiving service, designed to digitally preserve scientific and educationally important material on the web by making snapshots of Internet contents as they existed at the time when a blogger, or a scholar or a Wikipedia editor cited or quoted from it. The preservation service enables verifiability of claims supported by the cited sources even when the original web pages are being revised, removed, or disappear for other reasons, an effect known as [[link rot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Decay of References to Web sites in Articles Published in General Medical Journals: Mainstream vs Small Journals|journal = Applied Clinical Informatics|date = 2013-01-01|volume = 4|issue = 4|pages = 455–464|doi = 10.4338/aci-2013-07-ra-0055|pmid = 24454575|first = P.|last = Habibzadeh|first2 = Schattauer GmbH - Publishers for Medicine and Natural|last2 = Sciences|pmc = 3885908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison to other services ==
The service differs from the short time [[Google Cache]] copies by having indefinite archiving and by offering on-the-fly archiving. The [[Internet Archive]], since 2013,&lt;ref name=IA-2013-10&gt;''[http://blog.archive.org/2013/10/25/fixing-broken-links/ Fixing Broken Links on the Internet]'', Internet Archive blog, October 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; also offers immediate archiving, however WebCite has some advantages:

* pages cached by WebCite also capture several layers of underlying links while Internet Archive only captures the top page chosen for archiving
* the accuracy with which formatting and functionality is preserved also varies greatly between Internet Archive and WebCite
* WebCite checks [[robots.txt]] only at the time of archiving, Internet Archive checks robots.txt occasionally, so changes in robots.txt (which can be caused by a change in the ownership of the [[domain name]]) can result in removing the cached pages from the Internet Archive

WebCite is a non-profit [[consortium]] supported by publishers and editors, and it can be used by individuals without charge. Rather than relying on a [[web crawler]] which archives pages in a "[[randomness|random]]" fashion, authors who want to cite [[web page]]s in a [[Academic publishing|scholarly article]] can initiate the archiving process. They then cite – instead of or in addition to the original URL – the snapshot address archived by WebCite, with an [[identifier]] that specifies the cited source. (However, note that the [[Internet Archive]] does ''both'' a crawler-based archiving and on-demand archiving.)

WebCite can be used to preserve cited Internet content, such as the [[Web archiving|archived web pages]], in addition to citing the original [[URL]] of the Internet content. All types of web content, including [[HTML]] web pages, [[PDF]] files, [[style sheet (web development)|style sheets]], [[JavaScript]] and [[digital image]]s can be preserved. It also archives [[metadata]] about the collected resources such as access time, [[MIME type]], and content length.

== History ==
Conceived in 1997 by [[Gunther Eysenbach]], WebCite was publicly described the following year when an article on Internet [[quality control]] declared that such a service could also measure the [[citation impact]] of web pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Eysenbach|first= Gunther |authorlink= Gunther Eysenbach|author2=Diepgen, Thomas L. |date = November 28, 1998|title= Towards quality management of medical information on the internet: evaluation, labelling, and filtering of information|journal= [[The BMJ]]|volume= 317|issue= 7171|pages= 1496–1502|issn= 0959-8146|oclc= 206118688|pmid= 9831581|id= BL Shelfmark 2330.000000|url= http://www.bmj.com/content/317/7171/1496.full|accessdate= 2008-02-27|quote= |pmc= 1114339 |doi=10.1136/bmj.317.7171.1496}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the next year, a pilot service was set up at the address webcite.net. Although it seemed that the need for WebCite decreased when [[Google]]'s ''short term'' copies of web pages began to be offered by [[Google Cache]] and the [[Internet Archive]] expanded their crawling (which started in 1996),&lt;ref name=IA-2013-10/&gt; WebCite was the only one allowing "on-demand" archiving by users. WebCite also offered interfaces to scholarly journals and publishers to automate the archiving of cited links. By 2008, over 200 journals had begun routinely using WebCite.&lt;ref name="JMIR"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Eysenbach|first= Gunther |authorlink= Gunther Eysenbach|author2=Trudel, Mathieu |year= 2005|title= Going, Going, Still There: Using the WebCite Service to Permanently Archive Cited Web Pages|journal= [[Journal of Medical Internet Research]]|volume= 7|issue= 5|pages= e60|issn= 1438-8871|oclc= 107198227|doi= 10.2196/jmir.7.5.e60|pmid= 16403724|id= |url= http://www.jmir.org/2005/5/e60|accessdate= 2008-02-27|quote= |pmc= 1550686 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

WebCite used to be, but is no longer, a member of the [[International Internet Preservation Consortium]].&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180211164104/http://www.webcitation.org/faq |via=archive.org |title=WebCite Consortium FAQ |work=WebCitation.org |publisher=WebCite }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2012 message on Twitter, Eysenbach commented that "WebCite has no funding, and IIPC charges €4000 per year in annual membership fees."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/eysenbach/status/212380809464782849 |title=Twitter post |date=June 11, 2012 |accessdate=2013-03-10 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6F0ea1ZJ0?url=https://twitter.com/eysenbach/status/212380809464782849 |archivedate=March 10, 2013 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

WebCite "feeds its content" to other [[digital preservation]] projects, including the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;ref name=faq /&gt; [[Lawrence Lessig]], an American academic who writes extensively on copyright and technology, used WebCite in his [[amicus brief]] in the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] case of ''[[MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Cohen| first = Norm| title = Courts Turn to Wikipedia, but Selectively | newspaper = [[The New York Times]]| date = January 29, 2007| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/29/technology/29wikipedia.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fundraising ==
WebCite ran a fund-raising campaign using [[FundRazr]] from January 2013 with a target of $22,500, a sum which its operators stated was needed to maintain and modernize the service beyond the end of 2013.&lt;ref name=funding&gt;{{cite web |title= Fund WebCite|publisher= [[Wikimedia Foundation]] |url= http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WebCite |accessdate= 2013-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes relocating the service to [[Amazon EC2]] cloud hosting and legal support. {{As of | 2013}} it remained undecided whether WebCite would continue as a non-profit or as a for-profit entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url        = http://www.givewell.org/files/conversations/Webcite%20conversation%20notes%20(public).pdf

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Compare:

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
WebCite allows on-demand prospective archiving. It is not crawler-based; pages are only archived if the citing author or publisher requests it. No cached copy will appear in a WebCite search unless the author or another person has specifically cached it beforehand.

To initiate the caching and archiving of a page, an author may use WebCite's "archive" menu option or create a WebCite [[bookmarklet]] that will allow web surfers to cache pages just by clicking a button in their bookmarks folder.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20180211164104/http://www.webcitation.org/doc/WebCiteBestPracticesGuide.pdf WebCite Best Practices Guide .pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

One can retrieve or cite archived pages through a transparent format such as

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://webcitation.org/query?url=URL&amp;date=DATE&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

where &lt;code&gt;URL&lt;/code&gt; is the URL that was archived, and &lt;code&gt;DATE&lt;/code&gt; indicates the caching date. For example,

: &lt;code&gt;http://webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMain_Page&amp;date=2008-03-04&lt;/code&gt;

or the alternate short form &lt;code&gt;http://webcitation.org/5W56XTY5h&lt;/code&gt;
retrieves an archived copy of the URL &lt;code&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page&lt;/code&gt; that is closest to the date of March 4, 2008. The ID (5W56XTY5h) is the [[UNIX time]] in [[base 62]].

It is important to note that WebCite does not work for pages which contain a [[no-cache tag]]. WebCite respects the author's request to not have their web page cached.

One can archive a page by simply navigating in their browser to a link formatted like this:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://webcitation.org/archive?url=&lt;/nowiki&gt;''urltoarchive''&lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;email=&lt;/nowiki&gt;''youremail''&lt;/code&gt;

Compared to [[Wayback Machine]]
: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://web.archive.org/save/&lt;/nowiki&gt;''urltoarchive''&lt;/code&gt;

replacing ''&lt;code&gt;urltoarchive&lt;/code&gt;'' with the full URL of the page to be archived, and ''&lt;code&gt;youremail&lt;/code&gt;'' with their e-mail address. This is how the WebCite [[bookmarklet]] works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.webcitation.org/bookmarklet |title=WebCite Bookmarklet |work=WebCitation.org |publisher=WebCite |accessdate=2017-05-14 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once archived on WebCite, users can try to create an independent second-level backup copy of the starting URL, saving a second time the new WebCite's domain URL on [[Internet Archive|web.archive.org]], and on [[archive.is]].

== Business model ==
The term "WebCite" is a registered trademark.&lt;ref name=wc_license&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://webcitation.org/license |title=WebCite Legal and Copyright Information |work=WebCitation.org |publisher=WebCite |accessdate=2009-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; WebCite does not charge individual users, journal editors and publishers&lt;ref name=wc_MEMBERS&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://webcitation.org/members |title=WebCite Member List |work=WebCitation.org |publisher=WebCite Consortium |quote=Membership is currently free |accessdate=2009-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; any fee to use their service. WebCite earns revenue from publishers who want to "have their publications analyzed and cited webreferences archived",&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt; and accepts donations. Early support was from the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt;

== Copyright issues ==
WebCite maintains the legal position that its archiving activities&lt;ref name="JMIR"/&gt; are allowed by the copyright doctrines of [[fair use]] and [[implied license]].&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt; To support the fair use argument, WebCite notes that its archived copies are [[Transformativeness|transformative]], socially valuable for academic research, and not harmful to the market value of any copyrighted work.&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt; WebCite argues that caching and archiving web pages is not considered a copyright infringement when the archiver offers the copyright owner an opportunity to "opt-out" of the archive system, thus creating an implied license.&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt; To that end, WebCite will not archive in violation of Web site "do-not-cache" and "no-archive" [[metadata]], as well as [[robot exclusion standard]]s, the absence of which creates an "[[implied license]]" for web archive services to preserve the content.&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt;

In a similar case involving [[Google]]'s web caching activities, on January 19, 2006, the [[United States District Court for the District of Nevada]] agreed with that argument in the case of ''[[Field v. Google]]'' (CV-S-04-0413-RCJ-LRL), holding that fair use and an "implied license" meant that Google's caching of Web pages did not constitute copyright violation.&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt; The "implied license" referred to general Internet standards.&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt;

===DMCA requests===
According to their policy, after receiving legitimate [[DMCA]] requests from the copyright holders, WebCite removes saved pages from public access, as the archived pages are still under the safe harbor of being citations. The pages are removed to a "dark archive" and in cases of legal controversies or evidence requests there is pay-per-view access of "$200 (up to 5 snapshots) plus $100 for each further 10 snapshots" to the copyrighted content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.webcitation.org/policy.php |title=WebCite takedown requests policy |work=WebCitation.org |publisher=WebCite |accessdate=2017-05-14 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yahoo! Mail''' is an [[email]] service launched in 1997 through the American parent company [[Yahoo]]. Yahoo Mail provides four different email plans: three for personal use (Basic, Plus, and Ad Free) and another for businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/email/compare-plans| title = Business Email Plans| last = | first = | date = | accessdate = April 5, 2014| publisher= Yahoo!}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/topic/product/yahoo-mail/|title=Yahoo!

As many as three web interfaces were available at any given time. The traditional "Yahoo! Mail Classic" preserved the availability of their original 1997 interface until July 2013 in North America. A 2005 version included a new [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] interface, drag-and-drop, improved search, keyboard shortcuts, address auto-completion, and tabs. However, other features were removed, such as column widths and one click delete-move-to-next. In October 2010, Yahoo! released a beta version of Yahoo! Mail,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McDowell|first=David|title=Yahoo!

==History==

===1997 Release===
Yahoo! made a deal with the online communications company [[Four11]] for co-branded white pages. Marvin Gavin, who worked at Four11 as the Director of International Business Development, said "We always had a bias about being acquired by Yahoo. They were more entrepreneurial than Microsoft. We had a great cultural fit – it made a lot of sense."  In the end, Yahoo! acquired Four11 for $96 million. The purpose behind acquiring Four11 was the company's [[RocketMail]] webmail service, which launched in 1997. Yahoo! announced the acquisition on October 8, 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=Yahoo! |date=October 23, 1997 |url=http://docs.yahoo.com/docs/pr/release128.html |title=Yahoo!

We did an analysis. For us to build, it would have taken four to six months, and by then, so many users would have taken an email account. The speed of the market was critical."{{Cite quote|date=July 2017}}

The transition to Yahoo!

Spokeswoman, told CNET, "For-pay services on Yahoo!, originally launched in February 1999, have experienced great acceptance from our base of active registered users, and we expect this adoption to continue to grow."{{Cite quote|date=July 2017}}

===2002 Updates===
[[File:Yahoo-Mail-Logo.svg|thumb|200px|Yahoo! Mail logo from 2002]]
During 2002, the Yahoo! network was gradually redesigned. On July 2, the company website was changed, and it was announced that Yahoo! Mail and other services would also be redesigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yahoo! unveils home page face-lift|url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-941329.html|publisher=ZDNet|date=July 2, 2002|accessdate=May 31, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060618070824/http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-941329.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = June 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with this new design, new features were to be implemented, including drop-down menus in [[DHTML]], different category tabs, and a new user-customizable color scheme. Yahoo! Network Services senior vice president Geoff Ralston stated that

{{quote|source=|The launch of Yahoo! Mail Plus is part of Yahoo's strategic initiative to offer premium services that deliver innovative, reliable and relevant services to consumers ...

===Competition===
On April 1, 2004, Google announced its [[Gmail]] service with 1 GB of storage, however Gmail's invitation-only accounts kept the other webmail services at the forefront. Most major webmail providers, including Yahoo! Mail, increased their mailbox storage in response. Yahoo! first announced 100 MB of storage for basic accounts and 2 GB of storage for premium users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=Yahoo! |date=June 15, 2004 |url=http://docs.yahoo.com/docs/pr/release1168.html |title=Yahoo!

Mail increased its free storage quota to 1 GB, before eventually allowing unlimited storage. Yahoo! Mail had free unlimited storage from March 27, 2007 until October 8, 2013.

===2004 Updates===
On July 9, 2004, Yahoo! acquired [[Oddpost]], a webmail service which simulated a desktop email client. Oddpost had features such as drag-and-drop support, right-click menus, RSS feeds, a preview pane, and increased speed using email caching to shorten response time. Many of the features were incorporated into an updated Yahoo! Mail service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=Yahoo! |date=September 14, 2005 |url=http://docs.yahoo.com/docs/pr/release1260.html |title=Yahoo! Begins Public Testing of New Yahoo!

Mail became the default interface.&lt;ref name="Beta" /&gt; As the new interface became mandatory for users, some users of Yahoo! Mail reported slow typing speeds, contradicting Yahoo's claims of faster performance. Yahoo! offered no resolution to the problem {{As of|2011|September|12|df=US|lc=y}}. Users also missed the ability to paste textual email addresses into the sender box. The new version disabled the use of the "secondary" addresses provided in the previous version. The new interface overrode the browser's right mouse button (making functions such as opening mails in new tab windows unavailable).{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

===2013 Updates===
In 2013, Yahoo redesigned the site and removed several features, such as simultaneously opening multiple emails in tabs, sorting by sender name, and dragging mails to folders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blue |first=Violet |url=http://www.zdnet.com/anger-explodes-at-yahoo-mail-redesign-disaster-key-functions-removed-or-broken-7000021911/ |title=Anger explodes at Yahoo!

In December 2013, Yahoo Mail suffered a major outage where approximately one million users, one percent of the site's total users, could not access their emails for several days. Mayer publicly apologized to the site's users.&lt;ref name="theverge1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson |first=Lessley |url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/13/5209132/marissa-mayer-apologizes-for-lengthy-yahoo-mail-outage |title=Marissa Mayer apologizes for lengthy Yahoo!

Yahoo!

Mail Team}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users were warned that all emails, contacts, and account settings would be inaccessible, unless users migrated to the American version of Yahoo! Mail. Individuals who made China Yahoo! Mail accounts during the Alibaba takeover were required to create new accounts under new usernames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China Yahoo!

In January 2014, an undisclosed number of usernames and passwords were released to hackers, following a security breach that Yahoo believed had occurred through a third-party website. Yahoo contacted affected users and requested that passwords be changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yahoo! acknowledges Yahoo!

===2015 Update===
Yahoo updated the mail service with a "more subtle" redesign in 2015, as well as improving mobile features, and introducing the Yahoo Account Key, a smartphone-based replacement for password logins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconbeat.com/2015/10/15/yahoo/ |title=Yahoo!

===2017 Update===
On December 23, Yahoo introduced a new Developer update, containing not as many ads as previous versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/06/27/yahoo-mail-update/|title=Yahoo gives Mail a makeover and introduces Yahoo Mail Pro|author=|date=|website=engadget.com|accessdate=April 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spam policy==
Yahoo! Mail is often used by [[email spam|spammers]] to provide a "remove me" email address. Often, these addresses are used to verify the recipient's address, thus opening the door for more spam.

Yahoo! does not tolerate this practice and terminates accounts connected with spam-related activities without warning, causing spammers to lose access to any other Yahoo! services connected with their ID under the Terms of Service. Additionally, Yahoo! stresses that its servers are based in California and any spam-related activity which uses its servers could potentially violate that state's anti-spam laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/abuse/abuse-110239.html |title=How do I report Spam? – Yahoo! Abuse |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=August 28, 2007 |accessdate=February 5, 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828025209/http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/abuse/abuse-110239.html |archivedate=August 28, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/guidelines/spam |title=Yahoo! Terms |publisher=Info.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2006, Yahoo! announced its decision (along with AOL) to give some organizations the option to "certify" mail by paying up to one cent for each outgoing message, allowing the mail in question to bypass inbound spam filters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004398.php#004398 |title=AOL, Yahoo! and Goodmail: Taxing Your Email for Fun and Profit &amp;#124; Electronic Frontier Foundation |publisher=Eff.org |accessdate=January 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Yahoo! Mail began rejecting spam reports, which involved sending a copy of the spam with full headers by email to Yahoo's abuse department, offering the use of a form instead. However, the requirement to use a form is prohibited by several Internet RFCs, and the availability of abuse at example.com (in this case abuse at yahoo.com) is required by the Invariants clause of RFC 2142, because the domain has a mail server and an MX record. Yahoo's claim was that its "standard" was better than the Internet standards referred to. This is the only working form through which users can report spam or misuse of the Yahoo! email service.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Filters===
{{See also|Scunthorpe problem}}

In order to prevent abuse, in 2002 Yahoo! Mail activated filters which changed certain words (that could trigger unwanted [[Javascript]] events) and word fragments into other words. "mocha" was changed to "espresso", "expression" became "statement", and "[[Eval#JavaScript|eval]]" (short for "evaluation") became "review". This resulted in many unintended corrections, such as "prreviewent" (prevalent), "reviewuation" (evaluation) and "medireview" (medieval).

When asked about these changes, Yahoo! explained that the changed words were common terms used in [[ECMAScript|web scripting]], and were blacklisted to prevent hackers from sending damaging commands via the program's [[HTML]] function. Starting before February 7, 2006, Yahoo! Mail ended the practice, and began to add an [[underscore]] as a prefix to certain suspicious words and word fragments.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

===Greylisting===
{{See also|Greylisting}}
Incoming mail to Yahoo! addresses can be subjected to deferred delivery as part of Yahoo's incoming spam controls. This can delay delivery of mail sent to Yahoo! addresses without the sender or recipients being aware of it. The deferral is typically of short duration, but may extend up to several hours. Yahoo! does not specifically document this policy in detail, although some information is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/mail/defer/defer-06.html|title=Why am I getting "451 Message temporarily deferred" or "421 Message from x.x.x.x temporarily deferred" errors when sending mail to Yahoo!?|year=2007|accessdate=June 27, 2007|publisher=Yahoo!}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/mail/defer/defer-01.html|title=As a sender, how can I ensure uninterrupted SMTP access and prioritized delivery?|year=2007|accessdate=June 27, 2007|publisher=Yahoo!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

===Shi Tao arrest===
In 2004, Yahoo's Hong Kong office provided technical information to the Chinese authorities about the account of journalist [[Shi Tao (journalist)|Shi Tao]], who was subsequently sentenced to ten years' imprisonment for "leaking state secrets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zonaeuropa.com/20050501_1.htm|title=EastSouthWestNorth: The Case of Shi Tao |accessdate=January 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yahoo! was criticized by [[Reporters Without Borders]] for acting as a "police informant" to increase its profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4221538.stm |title=Yahoo!

In a February 2006 hearing, Yahoo! executives swore that they had received no information about the investigation. Several months later, it was discovered that the document provided to Yahoo! China on April 22, 2004 by the Beijing State Security Bureau stated that "Your office is in possession of the following items relating to a case of suspected illegal provision of state secrets to foreign entities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationalrelations.house.gov/press_display.asp?id=446 |title=Statement of Chairman Lantos at hearing, Yahoo!

On November 13, 2007, Yahoo! settled with Shi for an undisclosed sum. Shi was released from prison in September 2013.

===Username bans===
On February 20, 2006, it was revealed that Yahoo! Mail was banning the word "[[Allah]]" in email usernames, both separately and as part of a user name such as &lt;tt&gt;linda.callahan&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John|last=Oates|title=Yahoo!Mail bans Allah and Dirty Harry handles|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/02/20/yahoo_upsets_religious/|publisher=The Register|date=February 20, 2006|accessdate=June 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the news of the ban, it was lifted on February 23, 2006. Along with this action, Yahoo! also made the following statement:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John|last=Oates|title=Yahoo! unbans!

{{quote|We continuously evaluate abuse patterns in registration usernames to help prevent spam, fraud and other inappropriate behavior. A small number of people registered for IDs using specific terms with the sole purpose of promoting hate, and then used those IDs to post content that was harmful or threatening to others, thus violating Yahoo!'s Terms of Service.

'Allah' was one word being used for these purposes, with instances tied to defamatory language. We took steps to help protect our users by prohibiting use of the term in Yahoo! usernames. We recently re-evaluated the term 'Allah' and users can now register for IDs with this word because it is no longer a significant target for abuse. We regularly evaluate this type of activity and will continue to make adjustments to our registration process to help foster a positive customer experience.}}

===Exploit===
In November 2012, an exploit for Yahoo! Mail was sold for $700 by an Egyptian hacker, allowing hijackers to hack Yahoo! Mail user accounts and redirect users to a malicious website. The attack used [[cross-site scripting]] which let hackers steal cookies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.voiceofgreyhat.com/2012/11/Egyptian-Hacker-Selling-Zero-day-Exploit-of-Yahoo-Mail.html |title=Egyptian Hackers Selling Zero-day Exploit of Yahoo!

===Phishing attack===
From 2007, Yahoo! was the email service used by New Zealand Telecom, which came under criticism in early 2013 following a spam and [[phishing]] attack that was described as the biggest to have ever hit the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Telecom-rush-to-fix-Yahoo-Xtra-spam-hack/tabid/412/articleID/286402/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ |title= Telecom rush to fix hack| date=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telecom and Yahoo! automatically reset "about 60,000" users' passwords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Telecom-defends-email-reset-operation/tabid/423/articleID/287149/Default.aspx |work=3 News NZ |title= Telecom defends email reset operation| date=February 18, 2013| quote=Telecom is defending a move to cancel the passwords of about 60,000 Yahoo!

===Account theft===
On October 3, 2017, Yahoo reported that all Yahoo user accounts, approximately 3 billion, were affected by the previously announced August 2013 theft of accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/732712/000073271217000003/a2017_10x3xoathxexhibitx991.htm|title=Exhibit|website=www.sec.gov|access-date=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This information updates the December 14, 2016, announcement that more than 1 billion user accounts were hacked in a breach that had occurred back in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/technology/yahoo-hack.html?_r=0 |title=Yahoo! says 1 Billion User Accounts were hacked |date=December 14, 2016 |accessdate= December 15, 2016|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier that year in September, Yahoo! announced that an additional 500 million user accounts had been breached in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/22/technology/yahoo-data-breach/ |title=Yahoo! says 500 million accounts stolen |last=Fiegerman |first=Seth |date=September 23, 2016 |accessdate= December 15, 2016|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was said to have discovered about the breach that affected hundreds of millions of accounts years before their initial announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/09/22/report-yahoo-to-confirm-data-breach-affecting-hundreds-of-millions-of-accounts/ |title=Yahoo! data breach casts ‘cloud’ over Verizon deal |date= September 22, 2016 |accessdate= December 15, 2016|publisher= The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;
