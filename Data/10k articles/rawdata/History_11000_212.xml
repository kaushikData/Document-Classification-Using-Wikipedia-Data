'''Adriaan Justus Enschedé''' (20 June 1829 in [[Haarlem]] &amp;ndash; 19 March 1896 in Haarlem)&lt;ref name="NNBW"&gt;P.C. Molhuysen en P.J. Blok (red.), [http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/molh003nieu03_01/molh003nieu03_01_0592.php Nieuw Nederlandsch biografisch woordenboek. Deel 3] (Dutch) Adriaan Justus Enschedé&lt;/ref&gt; was a Haarlem Archivist, collector, owner of the [[Joh. Enschedé]] printing company, philanthropist and a member of ''[[Teylers Tweede Genootschap]]'' (Teylers Second or Scientific Society).

==Biography==
Adriaan Justus was the son of Christiaan Justus Enschedé  and his wife Adriana Maria Dalen. He attended the [[Stedelijk Gymnasium Haarlem]] and studied law in Leiden, whereupon he joined the family business in Haarlem and brought historical typefaces back into fashion.&lt;ref name="NNBW"/&gt; He became city archivist in 1857 where he wrote an inventory of the archives, still useful today. He wrote several publications on the history of Haarlem, finding inspiration in his work as city archivist publishing the first inventory of the archives of Haarlem.&lt;ref name="NNBW"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/inventarisvanhe00enscgoog Inventory of the Archives of the City of Haarlem] by A.J. Enschede, published by A.C. Kruseman in 1867, on [[Archive.org]]&lt;/ref&gt; He was a driving force behind the restoration of the [[St. Bavochurch]] for which he donated many historical objects including historical stained-glass windows from other locations, and also for the restoration of the ruin of [[Castle Brederode]].

'''Alexander Guagnini''' ({{lang-pl|Alexander Gwagnin}},&lt;ref&gt;Annotated footnote to an edition of  ''Compendium Maleficarum'' by Francesco Maria Guazzo and Montague Summers, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QnlvkNsQYIIC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;lpg=PA80]&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-it|Alessandro Guagnini dei Rizzoni}}; 1538 in [[Verona]], [[Republic of Venice]] – 1614 in [[Kraków]], [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]] writer, [[military officer]], [[chronicler]] and historian of [[Italy|Italian]] heritage.&lt;ref name="middle"&gt;{{cite book | title=Finding the Middle Way: The Utraquists' Liberal Challenge to Rome and Luther | publisher=Woodrow Wilson Center Press | last=Zdenek |first=David | year=2003 | page=432 | isbn=0801873827}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is known as a Crown [[Rotmistrz]] of Poland and Commandant of Vitebsk.&lt;ref name="explo"&gt;{{cite book | title=Early Exploration of Russia: The Moscovia of Antonio Possevino, S.J. | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | last=Poe |first=Marshall | year=2003 | page=153 | isbn=041532274X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guagnini fought for the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in the [[Livonian War]] and the [[Moldavian Magnate Wars]]. 

Gwagnin is known for publishing the [[Latin]] book ''Sarmatiae Europeae descriptio, quae Regnum [[History of Poland|Poloniae]], [[History of Lithuania|Lituaniam]], [[Samogitia]]m, [[Ruthenia|Russiam]], [[Masovia]]m, [[Prussia]]m, [[Pomerania]]m... complectitur'', usually translated as ''"A Description of Sarmatian Europe"'' (printed in Kraków, 1578), which contained descriptions of the countries of [[Eastern Europe]] (history, geography, religion, traditions, etc.). The full name of his work is called ''"Sarmatiae Europeae descriptio, quae regnum Poloniae, Litvaniam, Samogitiam, Rvssiam, Massoviam, Prvssian, Pomeraniam, Livoniam, et Moschoviae, Tartariaeque partem complectitur"''.

Along with his father, Guagnini came to the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] during the Livonian War.{{efn|name=d299|Dyachok, 299}} He spent almost his entire life in Poland and considered it his other Motherland and wrote about that in his ''Description of Sarmatian Europe''.{{efn|name=d299}} During his years of service Guanini was close to the Great Hetman Lithuanian and at the end of it he was closely connected with the court of [[Archbishop of Krakow|Cracow Archbishop]].{{efn|name=d299}} He was referred in front of the [[Polish Sejm]] by the first persons of European states.{{efn|name=d299}} 

==Biography==
===Research===
The earliest biographic information about Alexander Guagnini is recorded by [[Szymon Starowolski]] in his "Scriptorum Polonicorum εχατοντας" in 1622.{{efn|name=d302|Dyachok, 302}} Later briefly Guagnini was mentioned by [[Franciszek Bohomolec]] in the fourth volume of his "Zbior dziejopisow polskich w czterych tomach zawarty" (''Work collection of Polish chroniclers in four volumes'').{{efn|name=d302}} It is possible that the information about the Italian was based on the excerpt from the Szymon Starowolski's book. 

A new source was introduced for the scientific circulation by [[Michał Wiszniewski]] in the mid 19th century, which was a recommendation letter of [[Ruthenian Voivodeship|Russian voivode]] [[Mikołaj Sieniawski]] for Guagninis father and son to the [[King of Poland]] [[Sigismund Augustus]]{{efn|name=d302}} dated 25 February 1561.{{efn|name=d306|Dyachok, 306}} It contained the following phrase in [[Old Polish language]], "Wloch z Werony pan Ambrozy, z szynem ssvym Alexandrem" (''Italian out of Verona Mister Ambrosius with his son Alexander'').{{efn|name=d306}} In 1860 Kazimierz Józef Turowski published excerpts out of the "Description of Sarmatian Europe". In his brief article about life and works of the Italian he provides extended quotes of the Franciszek Bohomolec foreword to the 1768 edition.{{efn|name=d302}} In 1887 Italian historian [[Carlo Cipolla]] published a big research "One Italian in Poland and in Sweden on the border of the 17th century. Biographic information" ({{lang-it|Un Italiano nella Polonia e nella Svezia tra il XVI e il XVII secollo. Notizie biografiche}}). As a result of his search in archival storages of Venetia and Verona, the historian discovered unknown earlier sources to biography of his countryman.{{efn|name=d303|Dyachok, 303}} Among other researchers about Guagnini was Polish author [[Antoni Pietkiewicz]] who edited the Guagnini's information in the Polish "Great General Illustrated Encyclopedia".{{efn|name=d303}} In general, researchers were more interested in the issue of authorship of "Description of Sarmatian Europe".{{efn|name=d299}} 

With a turn of the 20th century, the interest in Guagnini has dissipated. In 1960 [[Włodzimierz Budka]] edited an article about the chronicler in "Polish biographic dictionary" adding few more interesting details that he found in the Cracow's Archives. Based on documents from the archives, Budka discovered facts a rector's court appeal of a translator Grzegorz Czaradzki in reference of not payment by the Italian an agreed sum of money as well as a court appeal of Guagnini himself against a publisher Mikolaj Loba.{{efn|name=d303}} In 1967 another article about Guagnini was published by Polish historian [[Andrzej Wyrobisz]] who specializes in history of Polish glass production industry.{{efn|name=d303}}

===Outlook===
Alessandro Guagnini is of Italian origin. He was born in the city of Verona which was indicated at the publishing of his work, in Latin as Alessandri Guagnini Veronensis and in Polish as Przez Alexandra Gwagnina z Werony.{{efn|Dyachok, 308}} 

Mykola Kovalskyi pointed out that in literature could be met two dates of his birth.{{efn|Dyachok, 309|name=d309}} One is 1534, while the other is mostly used 1538.{{efn|name=d309}} Ukrainian writer Oksana Pakhlyovska, a daughter of a Polish writer Jerzy Jan Pachlowski, provided both dates in the "Ukrainian Literary Encyclopedia".{{efn|name=d309}} The discrepancy could be solved after checking the Verona's archives that were found by professor Carlo Cipollo. According to them, the Guagnini family was quite famous and well respected in the city. Its representatives were members of the city council as early as the 15th century. His grandfather Ambrogio Guanini de'Rizzoni in 1529 at age of 48 lived in Veronian district Ferrabo and had six children.{{efn|name=d309}} The oldest son Ambrogio was 23 years old. During the 1541 census his age was recorded as 32 instead of 35.{{efn|name=d309}} Along with him to the list was added a wife Bertholomea 33 y.o. and three children Francesca 9, Alessandro 7, and Clara 4. In 1545 census Alessandro is recorded as 11 year old.{{efn|name=d309}} Cipolla recalls also a list composed in 1555 where the age of future chronicler is indicated as 20. It is probably could be explain that to the document was entered a number of full years.{{efn|name=d309}} Regardless of it, Carlo Cipollo who entered in scientific circulation the mentioned sources argued that Guagnini was born in 1538.{{efn|name=d309}} Some writers (i.e. Wiszniewski, Turowski, others) did not indicated his year of birth, but wrote that the chronicler died in 1614 at age 76.{{efn|name=d309}}

Practically nothing is known about childhood and adolescence of Alessandro. Possibly during that time he learned [[military engineering]] and [[military topography]] that became useful during his service in the Polish military.{{efn|name=d310|Dyachok, 310}} Without referring to sources, S.Grzybowski, Julia Radziszewska and others were pointing to his skills in topography and map drawing.{{efn|name=d310}} Military skills Allesandro, possibly, learned already in Poland from his father Ambrogio who quoting the words of voivode Seniawski was "a person educated in knightly affairs".{{efn|name=d310}} More than likely yet in Italy Guagnini learned Latin in which he was writing freely as well as adopted some humanistic ideas of Italian culture. Particularly his historic and geographical work is noted for its great tolerance towards people of other nationalities and religious background.{{efn|name=d310}}

It is known that Ambrogio left Verona in 1555 along with his family. However, Alessandro stayed back for couple of year, possibly due to his education.{{efn|name=d310}} Gassenkamp shared a thought that Guagnini senior left for Poland where since 1548 ruled Sigismund the Augustus, a son of Italian who was sympathetic towards former countrymen of his mother.{{efn|name=d310}} After being able to save up some money, by 1558 Ambrogio invited his son. Gassenkamp and Budka expressed a guess that departure of Ambrogio could have been with political foundation.{{efn|name=d311|Dyachok, 311}} Grounds for that was exchange of letters between the King of Poland and the Herzog of Prussia during the winter of 1563 which included mentioning of Guagnini. Out of that Gassenkamp made a conclusion that before entering military service in Poland, Guagnini offered his service to [[Albrecht of Prussia]].{{efn|name=d311}}

In 1571 he received an [[indygenat]] (a type of naturalisation through adaptation of nobility) from the [[King of Poland]]. At that time Gwagnin also adapted his family coat of arms with a [[hedgehog]] (according to Włodzimierz Budka),{{efn|name=d314|Dyachok, 314}} due to his official last name ''dei Rizzoni'' where riccio in Latin means hedgehog.{{efn|name=d314}}

===European Sarmatia Chronicles===
[[Maciej Stryjkowski]], who was his subordinate, alleged that Guagnini stole a manuscript of the ''Chronicle of Poland, Lithuania, Samogitia and all of Ruthenia'' from him and was not the author of the book. Stryjkowski protested before the Polish king and his claims were recognized in 1580, but the book continued to be printed under Guagnini's name and was translated into Polish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kamunikat.net.iig.pl/www/czasopisy/annus/05/03.htm Oleg Łatyszonek, "From White Russia to Belarus"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060307220506/http://kamunikat.net.iig.pl/www/czasopisy/annus/05/03.htm |date=2006-03-07 }} ''Annus Albaruthenicus'', no. 5, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; An expanded edition appeared in 1611.

The chronicle included portraits of [[List of Lithuanian rulers|Lithuanian dukes]] for the first time. Despite the images being purely fictional and having nothing to do with actual dukes, [[anachronism|anachronistic]] clothes and weapons, and that some of the images illustrated multiple people, the portraits highly influenced future depictions of the grand
dukes of Lithuania. To this day they remain the most popular portraits used in many history books.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [http://mkp.emokykla.lt/gimtoji/index.php Gimtoji istorija. Nuo 7 iki 12 klasės]&lt;/ref&gt;

Copies of the book are preserved, among other places, in the [[Vilnius University Library]] and in the [[Francis Skaryna Belarusian Library and Museum]] in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belarus-misc.org/diaspora/yurevich/articles/library.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010208215405/http://www.belarus-misc.org/diaspora/yurevich/articles/library.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=8 February 2001|title=The Francysk Skaryna Library and Museum|author=|date=|work=belarus-misc.org|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anthropogeny''' is the '''study of human origins'''. It is not simply a synonym for [[human evolution]] by [[natural selection]], which is only a part of the processes involved in human origins. Many other factors besides biological [[evolution]] were involved, ranging over climatic, geographic, ecological, social, and cultural ones. Anthropogenesis, meaning the process or point of becoming human, is also called [[hominization]].

==History of usage==

The term ''anthropogeny'' was used in the 1839 edition of [[Robert Hooper (physician)|Hooper]]'s  ''Medical Dictionary''&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Hooper (physician)|Robert Hooper]], M.D. (1839) ''A New Medical Dictionary Containing the Explanation of the Terms in Anatomy, Chemistry, Physiology, Pharmacy, Practice of Physic, Surgery, Materia Medica, Midwifery, and the Various Branches of Natural Philosophy Connected with Medicine''. Philadelphia: M. Carey &amp; Son, Benjamin Warner, and Edward Parker. Griggs &amp; Company Printers.&lt;/ref&gt; and was defined as "the study of the generation of man". The term was popularized by [[Ernst Heinrich Haeckel]] (1834–1919), a German [[naturalist]] and [[zoologist]], in his groundbreaking books, ''Natural History of Creation''&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Haeckel (1868) ''The History of Creation''. New York: D. Appleton and Company&lt;/ref&gt; (German: ''Natürliche Schöpfungsgeschicht'') (1868) and ''The Evolution of Man''&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Haeckel (1897) ''The Evolution of Man: A Popular Exposition of the Principal Points of Human Ontogeny and Phylogeny'', Volumes 1 and 2. English Translation. New York: D. Appleton and Company&lt;/ref&gt; (German: ''Anthropogenie'') (1874). Haeckel was one of the first biologists to publish on [[evolution]]. Haeckel used the term Anthropogeny to refer to the study of comparative embryology and defined it as "the history of the evolution of man". The term changed over time, however, and came to refer to the study of human origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mason |first1=Otis T.|authorlink=Otis T.

The last use of the word ''anthropogeny'' in English literature was in 1933 by [[William K. Gregory]].&lt;ref name="gregory" /&gt; There was a gap in the usage of the term from 1933 to 2008. Anthropogeny was reintroduced in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Varki|first1=Ajit|authorlink=Ajit Varki|authorlink2=Daniel Geschwind|authorlink3=Evan Eichler|last2=Geschwind|first2=Daniel|last3=Eichler|first3=Evan|year=2008|title = Explaining human uniqueness: genome interactions with environment, behaviour and culture|url=|journal=[[Nature Reviews Genetics]]|volume=9|issue=10|pages=749–763|doi=10.1038/nrg2428|pmc=2756412}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is now back in academic use at the [[Center for Academic Research and Training in Anthropogeny]] (CARTA) at the [[University of California, San Diego]].

==Anthropogeny vs. anthropology==
{{disputed section|date=June 2018|reason=Seems to be using words incorrectly and making incorrect intepretations from the evidence.}} 
The root in ancient Greek ''[[Adam Kadmon#Gnosticism|anthropos]]'' means human and ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'' means discourse or study, and ''[[wiktionary:-genesis]]'' means the process of creation or origin.
''Anthropology'', therefore, is quite literally the study of humans, whereas ''anthropogeny'' is the breakdown of the word anthropos agai but with the link word -geny (γένη, γένος) which again literally means the study of the birth and gender of humans.

According to the ancient Greeks who came up with the terms, anthropology is the sum of many sciences relating to the human study. There is social, economic, civil and comparative anthropology.

Anthropogony derives from the word 'anthropo' again and -gony (γόνοι), meaning 'the causing of, the birth of', both in a literal and metaphorical sense, referring to what caused by human born or/and conceived/created.

Anthropogeny on the other, is whatever derives from humans. -geny ('γένης᾽), meaning 'the born' or who is born of, but also the gender.

According to Gregory (1933), anthropologists are interested in measuring and quantifying aspects of being human, whereas anthropogenists are interested in "piecing together the broken story of the 'big parade' that nature has staged across the ages".&lt;ref name="gregory"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gregory|first=William K.|year=1985|title=The New Anthropogeny: Twenty-Five Stages of Vertebrate Evolution From Silurian Chordate to Man|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=77|pages=29–40|doi=10.1126/science.77.1985.29|pmid=17792389}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the definition of the words, Gregory's statement is wrong.

So anthropology is the study of humans and anthropogeny, is the study of what humans 'gave birth to', to its core definition, although there have been many confusions by those who do not really have an understanding of the word's origins.

Modern anthropology is typically divided into four sub-fields: [[social anthropology]] or [[cultural anthropology]], [[biological anthropology]], [[linguistic anthropology]], and [[archaeology]]. The field of anthropology has origins in the [[natural sciences]], [[humanities]], and [[social sciences]].

The field of anthropogeny is also influenced by the natural sciences, humanities, and social sciences, however, given that it is the study of the origin of humans, it is also influenced by fields ranging from [[anatomy]] and [[biomechanics]] to [[neurology]] and [[genetics]].

A comprehensive list of Domains of Scientific Discipline relevant to anthropogeny can be found in the [http://carta.anthropogeny.org/content/about-moca/ Matrix of Comparative Anthropogeny (MOCA)], associated with the [[Center for Academic Research and Training in Anthropogeny]] (CARTA), at the [[University of California, San Diego]].

'''Arbāyistān''' ({{lang-xpr|𐭀𐭓𐭁𐭉𐭎𐭈𐭍 [ʾrb]ystn}}, [[Zoroastrian Middle Persian]]: ''Arwāstān'', [[Syriac language|Syriac]]: ''Bēṯ ʿArbāyē'', [[Armenian language|Armenian]]: ''Arvastan'')&lt;ref&gt; Frye (1983), p.223&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] province in [[Late Antiquity]]. Due to its situation and its road systems, the province was a source of income from commercial traffic, as well as a constant area of contention during the [[Roman-Persian wars]].&lt;ref name=Widengren /&gt;

The province reached across [[Upper Mesopotamia]] toward the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur]] and north to the lower districts of Armenia; it bordered [[Adiabene]] in the east, [[Persian Armenia|Armenia]] in the north and [[Asōristān]] in the south.

== Name ==
''Arbāyistān'' ([[Old Persian]]: ''Arabāya-stāna)'' is mentioned in [[Shapur I]]'s inscription on [[Ka'ba-ye Zartosht]].&lt;ref name="Widengren" /&gt; According to historian [[Geo Widengren|Widengren]], the name was lent from the Arabs inhabitant of Upper Mesopotamia.&lt;ref name="Widengren" /&gt; The term ''Arbāyastān'' literally means "The Land of Arabia/Arab", where ''Arbāy'' or ''Arabāya'' is ("Arabia") and the suffix  ''[[-stan|-istān]]'' ("Land of").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://info.filg.uj.edu.pl/zhjij/sec/store/sec-13.pdf|title=Studia Etymologica Cracoviensia|last=Jagiellonian University|first=|date=2008|website=|page=125|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the name ''Arbāyistān'' appears to be used when referring to northern Mesopotamia, [[Osroene]] was not included.

==History==

===Early history===
The province was formed in 363 after the 2nd Peace of Nisibis, composed of the concessions made by Roman Emperor [[Jovian (emperor)|Jovian]], which encompassed all Roman territory east of the [[Tigris]] that had been ceded by the Sasanians in the [[Peace of Nisibis (299)|1st Peace of Nisibis]] in 299.&lt;ref&gt;Scullard et al. (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; This included the former [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenian]] provinces of [[Corduene]], [[Zabdicene]], [[Arzanene]] and [[Moxoene]] as well as Nisibis and Singara. As part of the treaty, the Romans were allowed to evacuate the inhabitants of the cities of Nisibis and Singara,&lt;ref&gt;Blockley (1984), p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; and this led to the mass exodus of the entire populations of both cities to Roman territories to avoid imprisonment and deportation by the Sasanians.&lt;ref&gt;Dignas &amp; Winter (2007), p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bury (1889), p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; This also caused the Christian [[School of Nisibis]] to move to Edessa. In the 360s, [[Shapur II]] divided  the office of marzban between his brothers Zamasp and [[Adurfrazgird]] and they were granted responsibility for the northern and southern halves of the province respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Brunner, C. J. (1983), p. 478&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the [[Peace of Acilisene]] of 387, Armenia was divided between the Eastern Roman and Sasanian Empires and the majority of Arzanene was given to the Romans, aside from the canton of Arzan itself. In the fourth century, 12,000 Persians from [[Estakhr|Staxr]], [[Isfahan|Spāhān]] and other regions were settled in [[Nisibis]] to act as mainly military garrisons.&lt;ref&gt;Morony (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; At the close of the fourth century, in 395, the [[Huns]] breached the [[Darial Gorge|Caspian Gates]] and swarmed through the east, plundering Armenia and Eastern Roman Cappadocia, Cilicia and Syria undisturbed until moving to raid Sasanian Arbayistan in 398.&lt;ref&gt; Greatrex (1999), p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Roman–Sasanian War (421–422)|Roman–Sasanian War of 421–422]], the [[magister militum|magister militum per Orientem]], [[Ardabur (consul 427)|Ardaburius]], invaded and plundered Arzanene in 421. Ardaburius engaged and defeated the Sasanian [[Wuzurg framadar|grand vizier]], [[Mihr Narseh]], and with reinforcements besieged Nisibis. The army of [[Al-Mundhir I ibn al-Nu'man|Al-Mundhir I]], an ally of the Sasanians, who had been sent to relieve Nisibis, was defeated by Ardaburius beneath the walls and dispersed.&lt;ref&gt;Maksymiuk (2015), p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;  Ardaburius' victory over Al-Mundhir I led the new Shah, [[Bahram V]], to end his siege of Theodosiopolis and march to relieve Nisibis, causing the Romans to abandon the siege.&lt;ref&gt;Greatrex (1993), p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle History===
From 464 to 471, a famine struck Mesopotamia which devastated the crops and ruined the country. Sources say that the wells became dry and that there was not a trickle of water either in the Tigris or the Euphrates. Eventually the crops failed and thousands perished. In 483, a severe drought affected the region and lasted for two years, during which time tensions between the Romans and Persians heightened as Arab nomads allied to the Persians raided Roman territory, causing the Romans to assemble an army on the frontier to counter such raids. The situation was defused, however, by the [[marzban]] of Nisibis and [[Church of the East|Nestorian]] [[metropolitan bishop]] of [[Nisibis (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Nisibis]], [[Barsauma]].&lt;ref&gt;Greatrex (2007), p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; Three years into the reign of [[Kavadh I]], in 491, an uprising in [[Persian Armenia|Armenia]] encouraged the Qadishaye tribesmen south of Singara to revolt and besiege Nisibis.
&lt;ref&gt;Joshua the Stylite XXII&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the [[Anastasian War]], Kavadh I besieged and sacked the city of [[Amida (Mesopotamia)|Amida]] in 503, and resettled the population in Singara. The loss of Amida spurred the Roman emperor [[Anastasius I Dicorus]] to send reinforcements to the Persian border, however, a Roman army that crossed over into Arzanene was defeated. In the spring of 504, the Roman general [[Celer (magister officiorum)|Celer]] invaded Arbayistan and conducted raids against fortified settlements, seizing several forts and plundering the province, killing farmers and livestock alike.&lt;ref&gt;Watt &amp; Trombley (2000), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the mid-summer of 527, at the onset of the [[Iberian War]] and as overt fighting broke out between the Romans and Sasanians, a Roman army under the command of Libelarius of Thrace, dux Mesopotamiae and magister militum per Orientem,&lt;ref&gt;Greatrex &amp; Lieu (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; invaded Arbayistan with the intent of capturing Nisibis and the fortress of Thebetha.&lt;ref&gt; Farrokh &amp; Frye (2007), p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; Libelarius, however, refrained from engaging the Sasanians or looting and despite facing no opposition,&lt;ref&gt;Evans (2002), p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; withdrew to Dara with heavy losses having achieved nothing, and upon his return was replaced as magister militum per orientum by [[Belisarius]].&lt;ref&gt;Evans (2011), p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the war, in 531, Belisarius led an army into Arbayistan  and won a battle at the fortress of Sisauranon and managed to capture its commander, [[Bleschames]].

As part of the state implemented persecution of [[Monophysitism|non-Chalcedonians]], in late 536, the Patriarch of Antioch, [[Ephraim of Antioch]], bribed the marzban of Nisibis, Mihrdaden, to arrest [[John of Tella]] who had been residing on [[Sinjar Mountains|Mount Singara]]. John was arrested and held in Nisibis for 30 days under the accusation of living in Sasanian territory illegally and was handed over to the Romans at the border fortress of [[Dara (Mesopotamia)|Dara]]. Upon the invasion of Roman Syria in 540 by [[Khosrau I]], Belisarius was recalled from Italy to respond to the Sasanian threat. He arrived in Mesopotamia in 541 and besieged Nisibis, however Belisarius could not take the city and subsequently plundered the surrounding countryside. The following year, Khosrau returned from [[Lazica]] and invaded Roman Syria; during his invasion Khosrau sacked [[Ar-Raqqah|Callinicum]] and resettled prisoners in Arbayistan.

===Late History===
At the beginning of the [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 572–591]], in late 572, a small Byzantine army of 3000 infantrymen were dispatched by [[Marcian (cousin of Justin II)|Marcian]], magister militum per orientum, to Arzanene where they laid waste and plundered the region before returning to Dara. In the spring of 573, a Byzantine army under the command of Marcian departed from Dara and defeated a Persian army led by Baramanes at the town of Sagathon,&lt;ref&gt;Foord (1911), p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; west of Nisibis, and moved south to besiege the fortress of Thebetha, however, Marcian returned to Dara after spending 10 days besieging the fort without success. Marcian, under orders from the Byzantine Emperor [[Justin II]], [[Siege of Nisibis (573)|besieged]] the city of Nisibis until he was dismissed by Justin II as he felt he was taking too long to take the city. The majority of Byzantine soldiers returned to Dara, and a body of soldiers that remained at the camp were defeated by a Persian army.&lt;ref&gt; Frye (1983), p.328&lt;/ref&gt;

Khosrau I's conquest of the city of Dara later that year reportedly drove Justin II to insanity, and led to a declaration of a truce on the Mesopotamian front which was to last 5 years. The truce came to an end in 578 when Sasanian raids in Byzantine territory was met by Byzantine raids in Arbayistan led by the new magister militum per orientum, [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]], who also sacked [[Singara]], and according to historian [[Theophylact Simocatta]], liberated 10,090 Armenian prisoners in Arzanene,&lt;ref&gt;Young (1916), p. 336&lt;/ref&gt; of whom about 3,350 were relocated to [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;Cohen (2008), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; He also captured the fortress of Aphumon. Sasanian attempts to sue for peace after Maurice's campaign in Arbayistan in 579 failed and the following year, the Byzantine armies successfully marched through Arbayistan unopposed into Media and Assuristan before returning in the summer of 581 along the Euphrates in southern Arbayistan, sacking Anathon during their campaign.

Byzantine raids and Sasanian counter-raids continued for the next eight years inconclusively until the Byzantine general, [[Philippicus (general)|Philippicus]], invaded Arzanene and besieged the fortress of Chlomaron in spring of 586. However, the approach of a Persian relief army panicked the Byzantines, who fled in disorder back into Byzantine territory.&lt;ref&gt;Martindale, Jones &amp; Morris (1992), p. 1023&lt;/ref&gt; In the autumn of 589, a Byzantine army under Comentiolus won a battle at the fortress of Sisauranon.&lt;ref&gt;Whitby (1988), p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the war, Corduene, Aghdzen canton and Zabdicene was annexed by the Byzantine Empire in return for assisting [[Khosrau II]] regain the throne from the usurper, [[Bahrām Chobin|Bahram VI]]. The city of Nisibis was one of the first to support Khosrau and a joint Byzantine-Sasanian campaign defeated an army of Bahram near Nisibis in early 591.

Not long after the end of the [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 572–591]], a locust plague ravaged the countryside of the province from 591 to 595, in which locusts are said to have destroyed crops and fouled water supplies. The ensuing food shortages and famine caused many to migrate to neighbouring regions, whilst those less able were forced to resort to begging in nearby cities. This led to the abandonment of many villages and hamlets throughout Arbayistan.&lt;ref&gt;Watt &amp; Trombley (2000), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Some survived the plague by collecting and eating the locusts or by planting "small vegetables" such as summer peas and cucumbers.

Upon the end of the [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628]], [[Heraclius]] travelled through Arbayistan as part of the agreed withdrawal from Sasanian territory. After the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Muslim]] victory at the [[Battle of Jalula]] in April 637, Muslim forces marched north and established control over Sasanian Upper Mesopotamia, and annexed Arbayistan in 638.

==Economy==
Arbayistan's position on the [[Silk Road]] provided the province with a large income derived from custom-houses along the roads as well as from traffic on the rivers. The goods that came with it:silks and spices from the Indian and Arabian sea-trade assembled at Nisibis before it was sold to Roman merchants. The silk trade, which supplied the weaving industry of Syria, was especially lucrative and continued to thrive despite the threat of Arab raids along the roads.&lt;ref&gt;Brunner, C. (1983), pp. 761-762&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the Sasanian control of the two major East-West highways and excellent road system made the province easily accessible for trade.

==Population==
The population of Arbayistan was primarily composed of [[Arameans]], who spoke the [[Aramaic language]], and shared the province with [[Jews]], [[Arabs]], [[Armenians]] and [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]]. Many Arabs lived as [[Bedouin|nomads]] throughout the province, however they are known to have also thrived in the city of [[Hatra]]. Armenians could be found largely in the north of Arbayistan, in the districts of [[Arzanene]], whilst Iranian tribes lived in the north-eastern districts of [[Corduene]].&lt;ref name=Widengren&gt;Widengren (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{commons category}}
The '''Cessetani''' were an ancient [[Iberians|Iberian]] (Pre-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]]) people of the [[Iberian peninsula]] (the Roman [[Hispania]]). They are believed to have spoken the [[Iberian language]]. Their territory extended along the coast between the [[Coll de Balaguer]] and the [[Garraf Massif]] and was limited in the west by the [[Prades Mountains]].

One of their main cities was [[Tarraco]], modern day [[Tarragona]]. Although there are no remains visible of the Cessetani civilization, you can visit the Roman remains of a theater, a stadium and a Roman city wall. The Roman ruins of Tarraco are also listed on Unesco. Tarraco was captured by the Romans in 218 BC, after the [[Battle of Cissa]], in which Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio triumphed over the Carthaginians during the beginning of the [[Second Punic War]].

The Cessetani minted their own coins, almost ever only with the name of one of their main cities, ''kese'', but a few bore the inscription ''kesesken'' in [[northeastern Iberian script]] that is interpreted in [[Iberian language]] as a self-reference to the ethnic name of that people: from the Cessetani or from those of ''kese''.

'''Crown gold''' is a 22 [[Carat (purity)|karat]] (kt) [[gold]] [[alloy]] used in the [[Crown (English coin)|crown coin]] introduced in England in 1526 (by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]) to replace the earlier [[gold sovereign]] coins which were made from the softer 23 kt gold and which thereby had invited both deliberate filing and also non-intentional wear. The 22 kt standard has been used for British [[gold coin]]s ever since this change which is 91.667% gold (or 22 parts out of 24).

The alloying metal in England was and is traditionally [[copper]]-only, although a component of 1.25% [[silver]] replacing the same weight of copper, as a softening agent, was briefly used in gold sovereigns in the single year of 1887, for better production of an image of [[Queen Victoria]] for the [[Golden Jubilee]] of her reign. Crown gold with copper as the only alloying metal other than gold, remains the standard used in the British [[gold sovereign]], which is still minted.

In the United States, gold circulating coins were minted in 22 kt. gold alloy of crown gold purity, until 1834. These pre-1834 U.S. coins differed from their English counterparts in containing a significant component (about 6%) of silver. 

In 1834, the fineness of U.S. coin gold was decreased from 22 kt to 0.8992 fine (21.58 kt) to discourage coin melting. In 1837, all silver was removed from U.S. gold coins and the gold content increased slightly to 0.900 fine (21.60 kt exactly). This 90% gold-copper alloy continued in the U.S. from 1837 until gold coins were removed from circulation in the U.S. in 1933. &lt;!-- obvious: None of these 90% gold, 10% copper American circulating-coin gold alloys contain quite as much gold as the crown gold standard. --&gt; Before the mid twentieth century, all [[gold coin]]s were intended to circulate as money and therefore contained either 90% gold or a 22 kt crown gold type alloy. [[Bullion coin]]s were subsequently designed as collectable and not for circulation, which could be much more pure, since wear-problems were not an issue. Some of these gold bullion coins are pure gold of 24 kt, 0.999, 0.9999, or even 0.99999 fine (see [[Canadian Maple Leaf]]).

The South African [[Krugerrand]], first produced in 1967, and the first of these modern coins, was produced in the exact traditional crown gold recipe of 22 kt gold (remainder copper), because it was originally intended to circulate as coin currency. The Krugerrand is now considered primarily a bullion coin, and as such has no face value imprinted on it. A few other gold bullion coins never intended for circulation have also been produced for ''purely historical reasons'' in the traditional crown gold purity, including the [[gold sovereign]] (in exact gold/copper historical ratio), as well as now the [[American Gold Eagle]] series of bullion coins, the latter which again now follows the original (pre-1834) 22 kt or 0.91667 fine gold standard (although its silver content of 3% is somewhat different from that of any coin the U.S. had ever previously produced). The [[specific gravity]] of the gold alloy used for Krugerrand and American Eagle is 17.77.&lt;ref&gt;https://libertycoinservice.com/american-gold-eagle-information/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2260">'''Dmitry Gennadievich Yurasov''' ({{lang-ru|Дмитрий Геннадиевич Юрасов}}) (born 25 June 1964 in [[Moscow]]) is a [[Russians|Russian]] [[historian]] and [[human rights]] defender. Starting from age sixteen, he has been gathering information about victims of [[Soviet political repressions]], those who were imprisoned, executed, died in detention, or went missing. He began his research in 1981 while working in the state archives as a ''paleaographer, second rank''. He secretly studied the files of those who had been killed, collecting eventually 123,000 cards from a register that, according to his estimate, amounted to 16 million files. While still only a student, he first publicly mentioned his results at a historical seminar in the central writers' building in [[Moscow]] on April 30, 1987. They caused quite a sensation, which resulted in his access to the archives being blocked, but also in many offers of help from volunteers all over the [[Soviet Union]].

After graduating from the History Department, he has been working in various archives, including those of the USSR [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]]. This work provided him with more opportunities to expand his research. In February 1993, he was said to have as many as 430,000 files on people imprisoned or executed.

Dimitry Yurasov is mentioned in [[David Remnick]]'s ''[[Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire|Lenin's Tomb]]'' book, where Remnick offers a hike to Yurasov.

According to [[Walter Laqueur]], who mentions him in his 1990 book ''[[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] - The Glasnost Revelations'', Yurasov gave TV interviews on the programs ''Vzglyad'' and with ''Sobesednik'' and ''Sovetskaya molodyozh'' on December 24, 1988. He was also published in ''Sovetskaya bibliografiya 5'', pp.&amp;nbsp;61–67, in 1988.

'''Eaglesham''' ({{IPAc-en|'|i:|g|ə|l|s|ə|m}} {{respell|EE|gəl|səm}}) is a village in [[East Renfrewshire]], Scotland, situated about 10 miles south of Glasgow, to the southeast of [[Newton Mearns]], south of [[Clarkston, East Renfrewshire|Clarkston]], and southwest of [[East Kilbride]].

The 2011 census revealed that the village had 3,114 occupants, down 13 from the 2001 census (3,127). Eaglesham is distinctive in being built around the Orry, an area of common land about one-third of a mile in length, interspersed with trees and divided in the centre by the Eaglesham Burn. The ancient seat of the [[Earl of Eglinton|Earls of Eglinton]]. In the 17th century Eaglesham was a small market town. Today's village&lt;ref name="Statistical Account of Scotland"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dobin|first=Alexander|title=The Statistical Account of Scotland, No. XI Parish of Eaglesham (County of Renfrew)|year=1791–1799|publisher=M. Creech|location=Edinburgh|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1769 by Alexander Montgomerie, 10th Earl of Eglinton. It had at one time handloom weaving and a cotton-mill. Many of its buildings are grade 'B' or 'C' listed but, as a whole, the village is 'A' listed. Eaglesham was designated Scotland's first outstanding conservation area in 1960.  It is likely that there has been a place of worship here since the 5th or 6th centuries.

The village is an example of an early Scottish [[planned village]].

==History==

===Origin of the name===

The origin of the name Eaglesham is a ‘Settlement with a church or belonging to a church’. It is an Old English name, containing Old English hām ‘a settlement’ (Scots hame, English home). The first element is ultimately a Brittonic word for ‘church’, a loan-word from Latin ecclesia.

===The Mediæval period===

The parish of Eaglesham formed part of the district of Mearns, and together with other lands were bestowed to [[Walter fitz Alan, Steward of Scotland]], a member of the [[FitzAlan family]], by [[David I of Scotland|David I]]. It is almost certain that Walter granted Eaglesham to   [[Clan Montgomery|Robert de Montgomerie]] , one of his principal followers, who appears to have originated from the Shropshire lands of the FitzAlans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barrow |first=GWS |author-link=G. W. S. Barrow |year=1973 |title=The Kingdom of the Scots: Government, Church and Society From the Eleventh to the Fourteenth Century |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |publication-place=New York |page=344 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Earls of Eaglesham, Eglinton and Ardrossan

Situated in the Orry, is the [[Motte]] or Moot Hill, a flat-topped mound situated on the north-west bank of the Eaglesham Burn in the Orry used for judicial and local assemblies.

In 1361, Sir John de Montgomerie of Eaglesham and Eastwood married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Hugh de Eglinton of that Ilk and niece of [[Robert II of Scotland|King Robert II]].  Sir John obtained the baronies of Eglinton and Ardrossan upon Sir Hugh's death in 1374. Afterwards the [[Earl of Eglinton|Montgomeries]]  made [[Eglinton Castle|Eglinton Estate]] their chief residence. In 1388, Sir John de Montgomerie captured Henry, Lord Percy at the Battle of Otterburn.  It is traditionally believed that Sir John accepted a ransom for his prisoner who killed the 2nd Earl of Douglas and built [[Polnoon Castle]] on a small hillock on what appears to be an earlier motte.  Polnoon castle was refurbished for occupation in 1617 but was ruined by 1676.

===17th century===
Following a period of peace and relative stability in Scotland during the reign of King James VI, religion continued to be a major issue. The Covenanter movement resulted from an attempt by King Charles I to impose a new prayer book and regulations on the Scottish Church. The population of Renfrewshire was predominantly in favour of the National Covenant and Alexander, 6th Earl of Eglinton signed the covenant. Covenanters faced steep fines or even the threat of execution for expressing their faith and held their religious services in secret. A memorial to Covenanters Robert Lockhart and Gabriel Thomson who were shot by Highlandmen and Dragoons for their adherence to the Solemn League and Covenant as they returned from a conventicle in May 1685, stands in the kirkyard of Eaglesham Parish Church.

Alexander, 8th Earl of Eglinton obtained an Act of Parliament in 1672 for an annual fair and weekly market. By the time the New Statistical Account for Scotland&lt;ref name="New Statistical Account of Scotland"&gt;{{cite book|last=Colville|first=William|title=New Statistical Account of Scotland, Parish of Eaglesham|year=1834–1854|publisher=William Blackwood &amp; Sons|location=Edinburgh|page=402}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1845 the weekly market had long been discontinued and a flower show was held in place of fairs.  The fair was revived in 1961 and in recent years is held bi-annually in May or June and traditionally opens with a procession parading through the village.

===18th and 19th centuries===
[[File:Orry or Eaglesham Cotton Mill ruins.JPG|left|thumb|width=150|Ruins of the Orry cotton mill]]
Until the 18th century, Scotland's villages were little more than settlements loosely organised around [[fermtoun]]s. In 1769 [[Alexander, 10th Earl of Eglinton]], began the work of developing the old kirktoun of Eaglesham into a planned village. However it was his successor, [[Archibald, 11th Earl of Eglinton]], who largely saw Alexander's plans through to completion. The Earl planned his new village with two ranges of houses built around the Orry, an area of common land (Orry is from the Scots word, aurie meaning area), interspersed with trees and divided in the centre by the Eaglesham Burn. Tacks were offered on 900 year leases on condition that a house was built on a tack within five years. Tenants were allowed to use the Linn Burn for washing and the green for bleaching.  As a result of agricultural improvements, displaced workers became tradesmen or weavers in the village.

Eaglesham flourished during the age of agricultural and industrial improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=J.|last=Pigot &amp; Co.|title=National Commercial Directory of the whole of Scotland and of The Isle of Man|year=1837|publisher=J. Pigot &amp; Co.|location=London|page=697}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surgeons, shopkeepers and traders such as coopers; grocers; wrights; smiths; boot and shoe-makers; tailors and dressmakers, inn-keepers and vintners supplied the needs and demands of the increasing population. Churches met the religious needs of the inhabitants. Schools provided education and carriers transported goods to and from the markets at Glasgow and Paisley.

Handloom weaving became the main industry until the establishment of a water powered cotton spinning mill in the village in 1791. The Orry mill at its peak employed around 200 people with the machinery at one time driven by a 45-foot diameter cast iron water wheel. The mill burned down and was rebuilt several times before being destroyed by fire in 1876 and was never rebuilt. Without work many of the mill workers drifted away and their homes lay empty.  The population of the village dropped from 2,428 in the mid-19th century to 1,075 at the end of the century.

After seven centuries of ownership, the Montgomerie family's finances foundered and Eaglesham Estate was put on the market in 1835. The Estate was finally sold for £217,000 in 1844 to [[Allan Gilmour, Sr.]] and [[James Gilmour (Miramichi lumber baron)|James Gilmour]]. Shortly afterwards the estate was divided into two parts roughly by value, in proportion to the money each contributed. The larger part was Eaglesham Estate which was run by Allan and the smaller, Polnoon Estate, run by James.

East Renfrewshire Council's archives hold an unpublished manuscript "Graham's Eaglesham Essay" which details the history of the village at this time.

===20th century===
By the early 20th century, The Eaglesham Estates&lt;ref name=Gilmour&gt;{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Alistair R.|title=A Short Account of the Family of Gilmour of Eaglesham|year=1991|publisher=Alistair R. Hill|url=http://homepages.luc.edu/~pgilmou/gaccount.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; were heavily burdened and together with the considerable debts left by Allan Gilmour were advertised for sale in the late 1920s.  Angus Gilmour transferred the common area of the village of Eaglesham in 1929 to the parish council at his death. By the late 1930s many of the houses were in a state of disrepair. A letter-writing campaign was started and by the 1950s a worldwide appeal was launched for funds towards Eaglesham’s conservation. Such was the success of the campaign, that the village was designated Scotland's first outstanding conservation area on 12 August 1960.

A remarkable event during World War II was the landing of [[Rudolf Hess]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Secret Wiki Scotland|url=http://www.secretscotland.org.uk/index.php/Secrets/RudolfHessFlight|work=Rudolf Hess Flight|accessdate=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Eaglesham on 10 May 1941. Shortly after 11 p.m. a [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] aircraft crashed at Bonnyton Farm with an airman bailing out and landing at Floors Farm. David McLean, a local [[ploughman]], ran out of his cottage at the rear of Floors Farm after hearing an aeroplane crashing and saw a parachutist coming down. McLean assisted the slightly injured airman back to his cottage. The airman, a German officer, identified himself as Captain Albert Horn. Horn was arrested and subsequently taken to the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|3 Battalion Home Guard Headquarters]] at [[Busby, East Renfrewshire|Busby]] then briefly [[Giffnock]] Police Station before being transferred to [[Maryhill Barracks]] in Glasgow and other locations before finally being to transported to [[P.O.W.]] Reception Station, [[Abergavenny]], [[South Wales]] where he remained for the duration of the hostilities. Horn turned out be Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess. Hess apparently claimed that he had flown to Britain with a message for the [[Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, 14th Duke of Hamilton|Duke of Hamilton]] in an attempt to persuade the British government to restore peace but in poor light mistook his intended destination of [[Dungavel House]] near [[Strathaven]] as Eaglesham House. Hess was tried as a war criminal at [[Nuremberg trials|Nuremberg]] where an [[International Military Tribunal]] found him guilty on two counts of 'concerted plan or conspiracy' and 'crimes against peace'. He spent the rest of his life imprisoned in [[Spandau Prison]], Berlin.

==The village today==
Eaglesham Heritage Trail opened on 3 September 2011, a project of Eaglesham &amp; Waterfoot Community Development Trust. The trail consists of ten interpretation panels located throughout the village, explaining the history of the area from the 11th century to the present day. The trail was opened by the [[Archibald Montgomerie, 18th Earl of Eglinton|Earl]] and the Countess of Eglinton and Winton. The funding for this project was given by ERC LEADER Fund and Lottery Awards For All. Eaglesham History Society was established in September 2012 following on from the success of the Heritage Trail. The village today is served by a primary school, churches, library and a number of local services such as garages, shops, restaurant, tearooms, B&amp;Bs and the historic Eglinton Arms Hotel and Swan Inn. [[Linn Products]] operate a state-of-the-art [[High fidelity|Hi-Fi]] production plant on the site of the former Eaglesham House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/204397/details/eaglesham+glasgow+road+eaglesham+house/ |title=RCAHMS Eaglesham |publisher=[[Canmore (database)|Canmore]] |date= |accessdate=2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The majority of children of secondary school age attend either Mearns Castle School, Newton Mearns or St Ninian’s High School, Giffnock; state schools which have consistently ranked among the best in Scotland over many years. Clubs and societies include Eaglesham Amateurs [[association football|football]] team, Eaglesham Angling Association Angling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eaa.myfishingclub.co.uk/index.php |title=Eaglesham Angling Association |publisher=Eaa.myfishingclub.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eaglesham Bowling Club and Walton Angling Club. The opening of the Glasgow Southern Orbital Road in 2005 generated considerable environmental benefits by reducing through traffic and creating a cleaner, safer environment for the local community.

==Places of interest==
[[File:Eaglesham Church and cemetery.JPG|left|thumb|width=150|Eaglesham Parish Church]]

===Eaglesham Parish Church===
It is probable that there has been a place of worship here since the 5th or 6th century. The present church was designed by Robert McLachlane and completed in 1790. The church was originally a small octagonal building and later extended. A memorial to [[Covenanter]]s Robert Lockhart and Gabriel Thomson who were shot by Highlandmen and Dragoons under the command of Archibald MacAulay, laird of Ardincaple for their adherence to the Solemn League and Covenant as they returned from a coventicle on 1 May 1685, stands in the kirkyard. The Rev Andrew Robertson was inducted as the parish minister in May 2016.

===St Bridget's Church===
In 1857, a Roman Catholic church was established mainly for Irish immigrant workers in the cotton mill and farms. St. Bridget, born in 451 at Faughart near Dundalk is the patroness of the church. The church has a huge canvas of the Deposition of Christ from the Cross by de Surne.

===Polnoon Lodge===
Polnoon Lodge, a prominent building in Gilmour Street, was originally built as a hunting lodge in the early 18th century by Alexander, ninth Earl of Eglinton after [[Polnoon Castle]] was abandoned. The original house was built in 1733, the present B-Listed house however dates to the later 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portal to the Past: East Renfrewshire's Heritage Collection|url=http://www.eastrenfrewshire.gov.uk/heritage-detail?idcall=2074&amp;CALLBACK=1&amp;SearchType=undefined&amp;Searchterm=undefined&amp;submit=Go&amp;page=1&amp;imagesize=large|work=Heritage record: Polnoon Lodge prior to renovation|accessdate=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the sale of the Eaglesham Estate in 1844 to Allan and James Gilmour, the lodge was used as the Polnoon Estate office&lt;ref name="Gilmour"/&gt; for a short period of time before being let. By the 1920s the lodge operated as a temperance hotel and later on as a boarding house. An annexe was used as a meeting room for local groups and societies. The lodge lay empty by the 1960s and was renovated by Renfrew County Council as housing for the elderly. The restoration work won a Civic Trust Award in 1971. One of the houses in Cheapside Street is a miniature of the lodge and was once occupied by the Eaglesham Estate factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1450255 |title=Geograph Britain and Ireland - Polnoon Lodge OS grid NS5752 |publisher=Geograph.org.uk |date=2009-08-20 |accessdate=2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portal to the Past: East Renfrewshire's Heritage Collection|url=http://www.eastrenfrewshire.gov.uk/heritage-detail?idcall=2175&amp;CALLBACK=1&amp;SearchType=undefined&amp;Searchterm=undefined&amp;submit=Go&amp;page=1&amp;imagesize=large|work=Heritage record: Polnoon Lodge circa 1903|accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Joshua Cooper''' (May 1798 – 23 April 1863)&lt;ref&gt;{{Rayment-hc|s|3|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an Irish landowner, politician and astronomer from [[Markree Castle]] in [[County Sligo]]. He sat in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] from 1830 to 1841 and from 1857 to 1859, but is best known for his astronomy, and as the creator of [[Markree Observatory]].

== Early life and family ==
Cooper was the oldest son of [[Edward Synge Cooper]] MP (1762–1830), and his wife Anne Verelst, daughter of Bengal Governor [[Harry Verelst (colonial governor)|Harry Verelst]].&lt;ref name="histparl-edward-synge-cooper-d1830" /&gt;
He was educated at [[The Royal School, Armagh|The Royal School]] in Armagh,&lt;ref name="dnb1900" /&gt; at [[Eton College|Eton]], and then at [[Christ Church, Oxford]].&lt;ref name="histparl-edward-joshua-cooper-d1863" /&gt;

His first marriage was to Sophia L'Estrange, daughter of Colonel Henry Peisley L'Estrange of Moystown, [[Cloghan, County Offaly]].  They had no children, but he had five daughters with his second wife Sarah Frances Wynne, daughter of [[Owen Wynne (1755–1841)|Owen Wynne]] MP of [[Hazelwood House, Sligo]].&lt;ref name="histparl-edward-joshua-cooper-d1863" /&gt;

== Astronomy==
Cooper left Oxford after two years without taking a degree. He spent most of the next decade travelling abroad, pursuing an interest in astronomy which is believed to have been nurtured by his mother, and was developed as a schoolboy in Armagh on visits to the [[Armagh Observatory]].&lt;ref name="elliott" /&gt;
He travelled with portable instruments, which he used to calculate the latitudes and longitudes of the places visited and assess their potential for astronomical observation.  He accumulated a mass of geographical data, which he never published.&lt;ref name="dnb1900" /&gt;

His early travels took him to the Mediterranean and Egypt, then eastward to Turkey and Persia. In 1824–5 he crossed Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, as far as the [[North Cape, Norway|North Cape]]. He concluded that Munich and Nice were the best adapted spots in Europe for astronomical observation.&lt;ref name="dnb1900" /&gt;

When his father died in 1830, he succeeded him as manager of Markree Castle and estate on behalf of his father's deranged older brother [[Joshua Edward Cooper]].&lt;ref name="dnb1900" /&gt; When Joshua Edward died childless in 1837,&lt;ref name="histparl-joshua-edward-cooper-d1837" /&gt;
he inherited Markree.&lt;ref name="histparl-edward-joshua-cooper-d1863" /&gt;

Once established as manager, he began creating facilities for astronomy, which became [[Markree Observatory]]. In 1831 he bought for £1200&lt;ref name="steinicke"/&gt;
the largest [[Objective (optics)|object-glass]] which existed at the time.&lt;ref name="elliott" /&gt;
Made by the French optician [[Robert-Aglaé Cauchoix|Cauchoix]], it had an aperture of 13⅓ inches ({{convert|13.33|in|cm|disp=output only}}) across and a focal length of 25 feet ({{convert|25|ft|m|disp=output only}}).&lt;ref name="elliott" /&gt;
The telescope initially mounted on a wooden stand, but the arrival of the great lens had caught the attention of Dr [[Thomas Romney Robinson]], who had become director of the Armagh Observatory in 1823, and become a friend of Cooper's&lt;ref name="elliott" /&gt;
At Robinson's suggestion, the telescope was removed its temporary alt-azimuth stand, and mounted equatorially by [[Thomas Grubb]] of Dublin,&lt;ref name="elliott" /&gt;
with the innovation of a [[cast iron]] tube and stand,&lt;ref name="dnb1900" /&gt;
instead of the wooden mountings previously used.&lt;ref name="elliott" /&gt;
(This was the first major commission for Grubb, who was assiduously promoted by Robinson, and went on to become a noted producer of telescopes for observatories all around the world).&lt;ref name="glass" /&gt;
However, it was thought impractical to build a dome of the required size, so the instrument was set up outdoors, and remained uncovered.&lt;ref name="dnb1900" /&gt;
Cooper used the telescope to sketch [[Halley's Comet]] in 1835 and to view the [[solar eclipse]] of 15 May 1836.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europa.com/~telscope/tsfrance.txt ''History of the Cauchoix objective'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The observatory was expanded with a five-foot transit by Troughton, and a [[meridian-circle]] three feet in diameter, fitted with a seven-inch telescope which had been ordered in 1839 on a visit to the works of Ertel in Bavaria.  In 1842 he bought a [[comet-seeker]], also made by Ertel.  By 1851 Markree was described as "undoubtedly the most richly furnished of private observatories".&lt;ref name="dnb1900" /&gt;

Cooper's own diligent work in the observatory was joined in March 1842 by an assistant, [[Andrew Graham (astronomer)|Andrew Graham]], who gave a fresh impulse to its activity. In 1842 to and 1843 the two men worked together to accurately record the positions of fifty stars within two degrees of the pole.&lt;ref name="dnb1900" /&gt;
Graham began systematic observations of minor planets on the meridian.&lt;ref name="elliott" /&gt;

The latitude and longitude of Markree were calculated in 1841 by a joint exercise with Armagh.&lt;ref name="dnb1900" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elliott" /&gt;
In 1837, Robinson had obtained rockets from the [[Board of Ordnance]] at Woolwich, and a total of 76 rockets were fired from [[Slieve Gullion]] (a mountain in County Armagh) on five night between 14 May and 23 May.&lt;ref name="ria-robinson-1837" /&gt;
The rockets were simultaneously observed from Armagh Observatory and [[Dunsink Observatory]] in County Dublin, and the data used to calculate latitude and longitude.&lt;ref name="ria-robinson-1837" /&gt;
The same technique was used again in August 1841 to determine Markee's location. Rockets were fired from [[Culkagh Mountain]], about 6 miles north-east of [[Lough Allen]], and the precise moment of their extinction was observed at both Markree and Armagh. The results varied by only 0.03 seconds from the average of 15 chronometers lent by [[Dent (clocks and watches)|Dent]] of London.&lt;ref name="ria-cooper-rockets" /&gt;

Similar principles were applied on 10–12 August 1847, to calculate the difference of longitude between Markree and [[Killiney]], ninety-eight miles away in County Dublin.  This time, [[meteoroid|shooting star]]s were simultaneous observed by Cooper in Killiney and Graham at Markree.&lt;ref name="elliott" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ria-cooper-rockets" /&gt;

On 25 April 1848, Graham used the Ertel comet seeker at Markree to discover a ninth minor planet.&lt;ref name="elliott" /&gt;
It was named "[[9 Metis]]" at the suggestion of the late Dr. Robinson, because its detection had ensued from the adoption of a plan of work laid down by Cooper.&lt;ref name="dnb1900" /&gt;
[[9 Metis]] was the only asteroid ever discovered by observation from Ireland,&lt;ref name="whyte" /&gt;
until the 2008 discovery of TM9.&lt;ref name="hiddenhistories" /&gt;

Meteorological registers were continuously kept at Markree during thirty years from 1833, many of the results being communicated to the [[Royal Meteorological Society|Meteorological Society]]. In 1844–5 Cooper and Graham made an astronomical tour through France, Germany, and Italy. They brought the great refractor, which was mounted on a wooden stand with altitude and azimuth movements, was usd by Cooper to sketch the Orion nebula.  On 7 February 1845 he used it to detect independently at Naples, a comet which had already been observed in the southern hemisphere.&lt;ref name="dnb1900" /&gt;

From the time that the possibility of further planetary discoveries had been recalled to the attention of astronomers by the finding of [[5 Astraea|Astræa]] 8 Dec 1845, Cooper had it in view to extend the star-maps then in progress at Berlin, so as to include stars of the twelfth or thirteenth magnitude. A detailed acquaintance with ecliptical stars, however, was indispensable for the facilitation of planetary research—Cooper's primary object—and the Berlin maps covered only an equatorial zone of thirty degrees. He accordingly resolved upon the construction of a set of ecliptical star-charts of four times the linear dimensions of the 'Horæ' prepared at Berlin. Observations for the purpose were begun in August 1848, and continued until Graham's resignation in June 1860. The results were printed at government expense in four volumes with the title 'Catalogue of Stars near the Ecliptic observed at Markree' (Dublin, 1851–6). The approximate places were contained in them of 60,066 stars (epoch 1850) within three degrees of the ecliptic, only 8,965 of which were already known. A list of seventy-seven stars missing from recent catalogues, or lost in the course of the observations, formed an appendix of curious interest. The maps corresponding to this extensive catalogue presented by his daughters after Cooper's death to the university of Cambridge, have hitherto remained unpublished. Nor has a promised fifth volume of star places been forthcoming. For this notable service to astronomy, in which he took a large personal share, Cooper received in 1858 the Cunningham gold medal of the [[Royal Irish Academy]]. He had been a member of that body from 1832, and was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] 2 June 1853.&lt;ref name="dnb1900" /&gt;

Cooper had observed and sketched Halley's comet in 1835; [[Victor Mauvais|Mauvais]]' comet of 1844 was observed and its orbit calculated by him during a visit to Schloss Weyerburg, near Innsbrück (Astr. Nach. xxii. 131,209). The elements and other data relative to 198 such bodies, gathered from scattered sources during several years, were finally arranged and published by him in a volume headed 'Cometic Orbits, with copious Notes and Addenda' (Dublin, 1852).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

   }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although partially anticipated by [[Johann Gottfried Galle|Galle]]'s list of 178 sets of elements appended to the 1847 edition of [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers|Olbers]]'s 'Abhandlung,' the physical and historical information collected in the notes remained of permanent value, and constituted the work a most useful manual of reference. The preface contains statistics of the distribution in longitude of the perihelia and nodes of both planetary and cometary orbits, showing what seemed more than a chance aggregation in one semicircle. Communications on the same point were presented by him to the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] in 1853 (Monthly Notices, xiv. 68), to the [[Royal Society]] in 1855 (Proc. vii. 295), and to the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1858 (Report, ii. 27).&lt;ref name="dnb1900" /&gt;

== Politics ==
At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1830|1830 general election]], Cooper was returned as one of the two members of parliament (MPs) for [[Sligo County (UK Parliament constituency)|Sligo County]]. His family had held one of the two Sligo seats for most of the previous century; his father, who had held the seat until the dissolution, died during the 3 days of polling.&lt;ref name="histparl-edward-joshua-cooper-d1863" /&gt;

The county's politics were dominated by the interests of its large Protestant landowners. The Wynne family of Hazelwood controlled [[Sligo Borough (UK Parliament constituency)|Sligo Borough]], while the county representation reflected the strength of the Coopers, the O'Haras of Annaghmore, and the Percevals of [[Temple House Manor and Castle|Temple House]] in County Sligo. At the dissolution, the second Sligo seat was held by [[Henry King (British Army officer)|Henry King]], brother of [[Robert King, 1st Viscount Lorton|Viscount Lorton]].  However, these two Protestant [[Tories (British political party)|Tories]] were challenged by an independent interest which sought the return of "liberal and enlightened representatives".&lt;ref name="histparl-county-sligo-1820-1832" /&gt;

The candidate of the independents was Fitzstephen French of [[Frenchpark]] in Roscommon, brother of [[Arthur French (politician)|Arthur French]] MP. Unlike the sitting MPs, French supported [[Catholic emancipation]], and proclaimed his adherence "not to the principles of Whig or Tory, but to the principles of Irishmen". As part of the compromise which had secured the enactment of the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829]], the [[Forty Shilling Freeholders]] had been disenfranchised. However, with the property qualification for voting quintupled to £10, the number of voters in County Sligo fell from over 5,000 to just over 600.&lt;ref name="histparl-county-sligo-1820-1832" /&gt; French's challenge was defeated; King was re-elected with 390 votes, and Cooper topped the poll with 465 votes to French's 116.&lt;ref name="walker" /&gt;

In Parliament, Cooper opposed [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Earl Grey]]'s reform bill in at its [[second reading]] in March 1831, but a few days later he presented a petition from Sligo borough which supported reform. In April he presented an anti-reform petition from Sligo County, and voted for the [[wrecking amendment]] which sank the bill and brought down the government. A few days before the crucial vote he had told the Commons that the bill would cause "the total annihilation of Protestantism, by the increased influence in elections which it gives to the Catholics".&lt;ref name="histparl-edward-joshua-cooper-d1863" /&gt;

At the resulting [[United Kingdom general election, 1831|general election in May 1831]], Cooper condemned the failed reform bill as rushed, and again topped the poll,&lt;ref name="walker" /&gt;
When the [[Reform Act 1832|revised Reform Bill]] came before the Commons, he voted against it at both the second and [[third reading]]s.&lt;ref name="histparl-edward-joshua-cooper-d1863" /&gt;
He was returned unopposed in [[United Kingdom general election, 1832|1832]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1835|1835]], and stood down in [[United Kingdom general election, 1841|1841]], before returning in [[United Kingdom general election, 1857|1857]] for one parliament.&lt;ref name="histparl-edward-joshua-cooper-d1863" /&gt;

Cooper played a significant part in the editorial work of the third edition of the pseudohistorical anti-Catholic pamphlet [[The Two Babylons]] by [[Alexander Hislop]].&lt;ref name="2babs-preface" /&gt; The tract alleges that the [[Catholic Church]] is a veiled continuation of the [[pagan]] religion of [[Babylon]], a product of a millennia-old [[New World Order (conspiracy)|conspiracy]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;Grabbe, Lester L. [https://books.google.com/books?id=K2hIY_E_ngYC&amp;pg=PA28 Can a 'History of Israel' Be Written?] p. 28, 1997, Continuum International Publishing Group&lt;/ref&gt; All of the book's major claims have been thoroughly refuted by modern scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mcllhenny|first1=Albert M.|title=This Is the Sun?: Zeitgeist and Religion (Volume I: Comparative Religion)|date=2011|isbn=978-1-105-33967-7|page=60|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=KymmAwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=Alexander+Hislop+debunked&amp;ots=-uFxjecdKP&amp;sig=UvBeem9hvfz2T-p-RKkD3ROfGpk#v=onepage&amp;q=Alexander%20Hislop&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book's preface extensively praises an anonymous collaborator. Cooper wanted to remain anonymous when the book went to press, but by the seventh edition a footnote identified him as mystery editor. Hislop praises Cooper's meticulous attention to detail, his extensive library and his views on Christianity, and thanks him for "the incalculable value of the service which the extraordinary labours of my kind and disinterested friend have rendered to the cause of universal Protestantism."&lt;ref name="2babs-preface"&gt;{{cite book

== Death ==
Cooper died aged 64 on 28 April 1863.&lt;ref name="steinicke" /&gt; He was buried in a vault at the [[Church of Ireland]] church in [[Ballisodare]],&lt;ref name="dem-funeral" /&gt;
alongside his second wife, Sarah, who had died shortly before him.&lt;ref name="steinicke" /&gt;
According to [[William Doberck]], who began work at the observatory a decade later, he had been a kind and improving landlord.&lt;ref name="odnb-edward-joshua-cooper" /&gt;
The ''[[Cork Examiner]]'' described him as "celebrated for his scientific attainments, moral worth and estimable character".&lt;ref name="cork-examiner-nat-obit" /&gt;
The Obituary Notice in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, 1864 said he "was a kind and good landlord, making great exertions to educate and improve his numerous tenantry. His personal qualities were of a high order. Blameless and fascinating in private life, he was a sincere Christian, no mean poet, an accomplished linguist, an exquisite musician, and possessed a wide and varied range of general information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hislop|first1=Alexander|title=The Two Babylons|date=1871|publisher=S.

His estates were inherited by his nephew [[Edward Henry Cooper]], who initially neglected the observatory, before appointing a series of directors.&lt;ref name="whyte" /&gt;
The observatory was restored under Doberck's supervision from 1874, but was used mainly for meteorological investigation.  When Edward Henry Cooper died in 1902, the observatory was closed and its great lens sent to the [[Hong Kong Observatory]]. The observatory's library was converted into a garage, and its books dumped into a hole in the floor of a neighbouring room, which was exposed to rain through an uncovered slit in the roof.&lt;ref name="steinicke" /&gt;&lt;ref name="whyte" /&gt;

'''Enrique Krauze Kleinbort''' (b. September 17, 1947 in [[Mexico City]]), widely known as Enrique Krauze, is a [[Mexican people|Mexican]] public intellectual, historian, essayist, critic, producer, and publisher. He has written numerous books about the Mexican Revolution and leading figures in Mexican history, as well as economic analysis of the nation's history. The journalist [[Jon Lee Anderson]] describes him as "arguably [Mexico]'s most prominent public intellectual".&lt;ref name="JLA"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Anderson |first=Jon Lee |date=October 9, 2017 |title=Boundary Issues |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |quote=Enrique Krauze, who is arguably the country's most prominent public intellectual, wrote a column titled 'Trump in Mexico: A Historic Error'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krauze founded ''Editorial Clío'' publishing house in 1992. He also manages and operates the [[Documentary]] [[Production Company]] [http://www.cliotv.com Clío TV]; the combined company is Editorial Clío Libros y Videos. He has produced two major TV series on Mexican history, which were also shown in the United States. In 1999 he founded what has become a prominent cultural magazine ''[[Letras Libres]],'' which is distributed in several Spanish-speaking countries. 

From early in his career, Krauze collaborated with author [[Octavio Paz]], the [[Nobel Prize]] winner, in the magazine ''[[Vuelta (magazine)|Vuelta]]'' (Return). He served as deputy editor (1977–1981) and deputy director (1981–1986).

==Early life and education==
Enrique Krauze Kleinbort was born in 1947 in [[Mexico City]] to parents of Polish Jewish descent. He has two siblings, Jaime and Perla Krauze (b. 1953); the latter became an artist. 

Krauze received a bachelor's degree in industrial engineering from the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|UNAM]], where from 1968 to 1970 he participated as a member of the student council. He earned a doctorate in history from [[El Colegio de México]]. 

In 1978 he received a scholarship for studies from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]].

==Early career==
Krauze began writing and published his first article in the Méxican magazine ''Siempre'' in 1971, when he was 24 years old. A year later, he was contributing to the magazine ''[[Plural]]''. 

Krauze published his first book, ''Caudillos culturales en la Revolución Mexicana'' (1979) (Cultural Leaders in the Mexican Revolution), which was a study of the Generation of 1915. The following year, he began with the editorial staff of [[Octavio Paz]]'s magazine ''[[Vuelta (magazine)|Vuelta]]'' (Return), serving as deputy editor until 1981. From 1981 to 1986 Krauze was deputy director of the magazine.  He was deeply influenced by Paz as his mentor, and this work put him in the center of Mexican intellectual and political life. 

During this period, he also had academic study and teaching periods abroad, for more than a year as a visiting professor at [[St Antony's College, Oxford|St. Antony's College]] ([[University of Oxford]]) (from December 1981 to 1983), and at [[The Wilson Center]] (from October to December 1987) in Washington, DC.

==Later career==
Krauze's writing has covered a broad range of cultural and political subjects, in both his books and essays. He has studied and explored Mexico's cultural and political history. 

In 1988, Krauze published an attack in ''Vuelta'' and ''[[The New Republic]]'' on prominent novelist [[Carlos Fuentes]] and his fiction, dubbing him a "guerrilla dandy" for the perceived gap between his professed [[Marxist]] politics and his personal lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ggNhykG2EBmKe3ewpzl-kKeMpy6g?docId=bc48bc7f383d400891091379c48c4979 |title=Appreciating Mexican author Carlos Fuentes |author=Marjorie Miller |date=May 17, 2012 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=Google News |accessdate=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noting Fuentes had lived most of the time out of the country, Krauze accused the author of selling out to the PRI government and being "out of touch with Mexico."  Krauze said Fuentes portrayed the culture as violent and corrupt to appeal to foreign audiences: "There is the suspicion in Mexico that Fuentes merely uses Mexico as a theme, distorting it for a North American public, claiming credentials that he does not have."&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/16/local/la-me-carlos-fuentes-20120516/2 |title=Carlos Fuentes dies at 83; Mexican novelist |author=Reed Johnson and Ken Ellingwood |date=May 16, 2012 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=May 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=T2&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/mexico/9268694/Mexico-mourns-death-of-Carlos-Fuentes.html |title=Mexico mourns death of Carlos Fuentes |date=May 15, 2012 |work=The Telegraph|accessdate=18 May 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essay was highly controversial; its publication contributed to a permanent rift between Paz and Fuentes, formerly close friends, that lasted until Paz's death.&lt;ref name=WP&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/carlos-fuentes-mexican-novelist-dies-at-83/2012/05/15/gIQAx7dxRU_story.html |title=Carlos Fuentes, Mexican novelist, dies at 83 |author=Marcela Valdes |date=May 16, 2012 |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their estrangement was also based on Fuentes' support for the [[Sandinistas]].&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt; Fuentes brushed off the Krauze affair, saying, “I love having critics for breakfast.”&lt;ref name=WP/&gt; Following Fuentes' death nearly a quarter century later in 2012, Krauze praised the author highly, describing him to reporters as "one of the most brilliant writers of the 20th century".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-502927_162-57434907/reaction-to-death-of-mexican-author-carlos-fuentes/ |title=Reaction to death of Mexican author Carlos Fuentes |date=May 15, 2012 |work=CBS News |accessdate=May 18, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 he created ''Editorial Clío'' publishing house, which he directs. Krauze founded an associated production company, Clío TV, to create documentaries&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cliotv.com Clío TV]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Expand - such as? subjects?--&gt; and his company is now called Editorial Clío Libros y Video.

In 1999 he founded the cultural magazine ''[[Letras Libres]]'', which is distributed in several Spanish-speaking countries. 

Krauze was [https://web.archive.org/web/20140203043914/http://www.princeton.edu/plas/visitors/ Visiting Research Scholar] in the Program in Latin American Studies of [[Princeton University]] in Fall 2013.

==Economic and political liberalism==
In a July 2012 article published in [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] Opinion, Krauze favored the opening of the Mexican petroleum industry to private investment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-05/mexico-s-new-leaders-must-preserve-its-democratic-gains.html | work=Bloomberg | title=Mexico's New Leaders Must Preserve Its Democratic Gains}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it has been nationalized since 1938. Krauze's support for liberal politics was exemplified by his polemic article, "Por una democracia sin adjetivos," published in 1984, in which he strongly defended [[democracy]] as a means of social co-existence, not as a panacea that would immediately produce prosperity and material wealth for Mexico. 

Krauze has acknowledged being influenced by his mentors [[Daniel Cosío Villegas]] as well as Paz, both prominent Mexican [[liberalism|liberals]]. His ranking of democracy above other political priorities has attracted critics because of many residents in Mexico suffer from deep poverty and social inequality. 

Krauze has been consistent in valuing democratic process. In the 2006 Mexican federal elections, he criticized the leftist candidate, [[Andrés Manuel López Obrador]] and characterized him as "The tropical Messiah" in his article by that title, as López Obrador lacked democratic principles in his proposals, policies, and ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.letraslibres.com/revista/convivio/el-mesias-tropical Enrique Krauze, "El mesías tropical"], ''Letras Libras,'' 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Krauze has been a severe critic of the late-20th-century [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]], especially because of the antiliberal characteristics of its late governments. He said that that they did not guarantee free and impartial elections, lacked a balance of powers, and he summarized their restrictiond as "The Imperial Presidency."

==Awards==
In 1979 Krauze received a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]. In October 1993 he won the Premio Comillas de Biografía, (given annually by Tusquets publishing house for the best international biography) for his book ''Siglo de caudillos.'' He has been a member of the [[Academia Mexicana de la Historia|Mexican Academy of History]] since 1990. In May 1992, he was awarded the Medalla al Mérito Histórico "Capitán Alonso de León."  On December 16, 2003 he was granted the Condecoración de la Gran Cruz de la Orden Civil de Alfonso X El Sabio. He was selected for the [[Colegio Nacional in México]] on April 27, 2005. In August 2008 he received the Orden Isabel la Católica given by the Spanish government.

==Other work==
Among the many documentaries of his production company, Krauze produced ''Mexico Siglo XX'' and ''México Nuevo Siglo'', two historical TV series about Mexican history, on Televisa in Mexico; these were also shown on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] in the [[United States]]. ''México Nuevo Siglo'' was the first documentary to show on public television the events of the 1968 [[Tlatelolco massacre|Tlatelolco student massacre]]. He is a member of [[Grupo Televisa|Televisa]]'s [[Board of directors|Board]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.televisa.com/inversionistas-espanol/consejo-de-administracion/|title=Consejo de Administración|publisher=Televisa|language=spanish|accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has [http://www.letraslibres.com/blogs/blog-de-la-redaccion/la-mision-de-la-television criticized] its cultural content.

==Controversy==
In 2014 the shelter ''La Gran Familia'' in Michoacan was raided, and officials revealed the children were kept in inhumane conditions, having to sleep on the floor and beg for alms in the street. The director Rosa Verduzco was arrested in July 2014 on charges of maltreatment and sexual abuse of hundreds of children. Krauze led a defense of her in the media, noting he had written about the shelter's work in 2000. He noted that he had written about the shelter's work in 2000, noting how many children she had taken in and educated. He did not comment on officials' reports of conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.excelsior.com.mx/nacional/2014/07/16/971197|title=Sale en defensa de Mamá Rosa el escritor Enrique Krauze  |publisher= ''[[Excélsior]]'' |date=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ernst Bernheim''' (19 February 1850 – 9 July 1942) was a [[Germany|German]] historian, best known for an influential ''Lehrbuch der historischen Methode'' (1889) on [[historical method]].

==Family==
He was born in [[Hamburg]] as a son of merchant Louis Bernheim (later changed to Ludwig Berheim, born 7 December 1815 in [[Fürstenberg, Lower Saxony|Fürstenberg]]) and Emma Simon (born 15 April 1834 in [[Kolberg]]), who since 1834 lived in [[Hamburg]]. On 16 April 1884 he married Amalie ("Emma") Henriette Jessen (born 18 September 1861 in Hamburg, died 9 July 1945 in Greifswald). They had a daughter and three sons.&lt;ref&gt;Staatsarchiv Hamburg, 741-2, Genealogische Sammlung, Bernheim&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Ernst attended the Johanneum since Easter, 1862, and graduated with [[Abitur]] on 22 September 1868. From 1868 to 1872 he studied history in [[Berlin]], [[Heidelberg]], and [[Straßburg]]. He graduated with the grades [[Doctor of Philosophy|Dr. phil]] and [[Doctor of Laws#Germany|Dr jur.]] in Straßburg (1873, supervised by [[Georg Waitz]]), and [[Habilitation|Dr habil]] in [[Göttingen]] (1874/75, supervised by [[Julius Weizsäcker]]). Thereafter, he taught history at the [[University of Göttingen]] and at the [[University of Bonn]]. In 1883, he was called to the [[University of Greifswald]], Institute for History, where he held the positions of an "außerordentlicher Professor" ("Privatdozent") since 1883, and "ordentlicher Professor" since 1889. In 1899, he was elected [[rector (academia)|rector]] of the university. His eremitation was in 1921.

==Nazi era==
Due to his Jewish descent, Bernheim was subject to repressions during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi era]]. In 1933 he was forbidden to lecture, and an appeal to [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] to regain this permission was not successful. On 4 December 1935, with the implementation of the [[Nuremberg Laws]], Berheim lost German citizenship. An appeal to Hitler to regain citizenship, which was backed by a number of scientists from the [[University of Greifswald]] was successful - Bernheim was assigned "temporary citizenship" on 12 January 1938, thus avoiding [[History of Pomerania (1933-1945)#Deportation of the Pomeranian Jews|deportation in 1940]]. Yet, just weeks before his death, the deaf-mute fosterchild of the family, Hetti Meyer, was deported to [[Theresienstadt]] and killed. Hetti was raised from her birth by Bernheim and his wife Emma, a special education teacher. From 1939 onwards, Nazi scientists systematically besmirched Bernheim's scientific work, which was only appreciated again in post-war Germany. Bernheim died on 3 March 1942 in Greifswald. His former colleagues managed to circumvent Nazi orders and get his urn buried in the town's graveyard on July 23, 1943, but an obituary was not permitted.

==Memory==
A memorial plaque was attached to his Greifswald house in 26 Arndtstraße road. Furthermore, a street in Greifswald was named after him.

'''Eupolemus''' ({{Lang-el|ʾΕνπόλεμος}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/eupolemus|title=Eupolemus|website=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the earliest&lt;ref&gt;Mercer dictionary of the Bible By Watson E. Mills, Roger Aubrey Bullard Page 272 {{ISBN|978-0-86554-299-0}} (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Koine Greek|Hellenistic]] [[Jew]]ish historian whose work survives only in five fragments (or possibly six fragments) in [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]'s ''[[Praeparatio Evangelica]]'' (hereafter abbreviated as ''Praep.''), embedded in quotations from the historian [[Alexander Polyhistor]], and in the ''[[Stromata]]'' (hereafter abbreviated as ''Strom.'') of [[Clement of Alexandria]].

A sixth passage which Polyhistor attributes to Eupolemus in Eusebius' quotations of Polyhistor is usually considered spurious as being dissimilar to the other passages quoted and has come to be called ''Pseudo-Eupolemus''.

Style and vocabulary indicate the writing as also originally in Greek and the date of composition of the seemingly genuine passages is about [[150s BC|158/7 BC]]. That the author dates his work by the [[Seleucid]]s rather than the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]] suggests [[Palestine (region)|Palestinian]] rather than [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] origin. It has been speculated that the author might be the Eupolemus who was ambassador of [[Judas Maccabeus]] to [[Rome]] as found in [[1 Maccabees]] 8.17f and [[2 Maccabees]] 4.11.&lt;ref&gt;Martin McNamara writes: "The writer is probably to be identified with Eupolemus, the son of John, the son of Accos, who according to 1 Macc 8:17 and 2 Macc 4:11 was sent together with Jason son of Eleazar on an embassy to Rome in 161 B.C. to negotiate a treaty between the resurgent Hasmoneans and the Roman Republic. Evidently Eupolemus was a friend of the Jewish ruler Judas Maccabee and a gifted diplomat as well, since he succeeded in his mission. He may have been a priest since he speaks at length in his writing of Solomon's temple. He composed his work in the year 158/157 B.C." (page 222 of ''Intertestamental Literature'', Martin McNamara, 
Glazier (Michael) Inc., U.S.; New Ed edition, Feb 1991, {{ISBN|0-89453-256-1}}).&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Writings==
The fragments usually considered Eupolemus' genuine work are:
* A statement that [[Moses]] was the first wise man, that he taught the alphabet to the Jews who passed it on to the [[Phoenicia]]ns who passed it on to the Greeks, and that [[Moses]] first wrote laws for the Jews (''Praep.'' 9.26.1).
* Some chronology about the period from Moses to [[David]] and some details of David's arrangements for building the temple followed by purported transcripts of letters exchanged between King [[Solomon]] and "Vaphres King of Egypt" and between Solomon and "Souron the King of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]]", the Biblical [[Hiram I|Hiram]] (''Praep.'' 9.30.1&amp;ndash;34.18).
* A short statement about gold shields made by Solomon (''Praep.'' 9.34.20).
* A very short account of the persecution of the prophet [[Jeremiah (prophet)|Jeremiah]] by King "Jonachim" who seems to correspond to the Biblical kings [[Jehoiakim]], [[Jehoiachin]], and [[Zedekiah]] followed by a short fictionalized account of the fall of Judah ending with the note that Jeremiah preserved the ark and the tablets (''Praep.'' 9.39.2&amp;ndash;5).
* A chronological summary indicating 5,149 years from [[Adam and Eve|Adam]] to the 5th year of [[Demetrius I of Syria|Demetrius]] (''Strom.'' 1.141,4).

==Writing of Pseudo-Eupolemus==

The fragment usually known as ''Pseudo-Eupolemus'' (''Praep.'' 9.17.2&amp;ndash;9) relates:
* The Assyrian city of [[Babylon]] [sic] was built by giants who escaped the [[Deluge (mythology)|Flood]] and they also built the tower. After its destruction the giants were scattered.
* There follows a summary of [[Abraham]]'s career based on the Biblical account with the some changes and details similar to those found in the ''[[Genesis Apocryphon]]'' and [[Josephus]] and in [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enochite]] tradition. Abraham is particularly knowledgeable about [[astronomy]] and when he goes down to Egypt he teaches [[astrology]] to the Egyptian priests and explains that Enoch first discovered astrology.
* Then follows a puzzling passage which seems to have little to do with the context and may be garbled:
::For the [[Babylonia]]ns say that the first was [[Belus (Babylonian)|Belus]], who is the same as [[Cronus]], and that of him were born sons named Belus and [[Canaan]]. This Canaan fathered the father of the [[Phoenicians]], whose son was Chum/Chus, called by the Greeks Asbolus and was the father of the [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopians]] and the brother of Mestraim, the ancestor of the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]].

:Traditionally many translators have emended ''Canaan'' to ''Cham'', that is ''Ham'' since in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]&amp;nbsp;10.6 [[Ham, son of Noah|Ham]] is the father of [[Biblical Cush|Cush]] and [[Mizraim]]. However the author here claims to be relating Babylonian tradition, not Hebrew tradition, for whatever that is worth. ''Asbolus'' means 'sooty'.

:R. Doran in his translation in ''The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha'', Volume 2, emends ''einai Kronon'' 'is the same as Cronus' to ''einai Kronou'' 'is son of Cronus' noting that in no other text is anyone called Belus ever equated with Cronus.

* The account concludes by indicating that the Greeks relate that [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] discovered astrology but that Atlas is really Enoch and that Enoch learned from the angels of God.

R. Doran gives reason for believing that this fragment may be part of the genuine work of Eupolemus despite earlier doubts.&lt;ref&gt;Cf also Łukasz Niesiołowski-Spano, (Pseudo-)Eupolemus and Shechem: Methodology Enabling the Use of Hellenistic Jewish Historians' Work in Biblical Studies, in: Lester L. Grabbe (ed.), Enquire of the Former Age. Ancient Historiography and Writing the History of Israel (ESHM 9; LHB/OTS 554), New York: T &amp; T Clark 2011, 77-96&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Independent emergence on Earth ===
{{main|Abiogenesis}}
Life on Earth is based on [[carbon]] and water. Carbon provides stable frameworks for complex chemicals and can be easily extracted from the environment, especially from [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref name="PiP" /&gt; There is no other chemical element whose properties are similar enough to carbon's to be called an analogue; [[silicon]], the element directly below carbon on the [[periodic table]], does not form very many complex stable molecules, and because most of its compounds are water-insoluble, it would be more difficult for organisms to extract. The elements [[boron]] and [[phosphorus]] have more complex chemistries, but suffer from other limitations relative to carbon. Water is an excellent [[solvent]] and has two other useful properties: the fact that ice floats enables aquatic organisms to survive beneath it in winter; and its molecules have [[electric charge|electrically negative]] and positive ends, which enables it to form a wider range of compounds than other solvents can. Other good solvents, such as [[ammonia]], are liquid only at such low temperatures that chemical reactions may be too slow to sustain life, and lack water's other advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bennett|2008|pp=[https://books.google.com/?id=lEQKnip7St4C&amp;pg=PA84 82–85]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organisms based on [[Hypothetical types of biochemistry|alternative biochemistry]] may, however, be possible on other planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schulze-Makuch |first1=Dirk |authorlink1=Dirk Schulze-Makuch |last2=Irwin |first2=Louis N. |date=April 2006 |title=The prospect of alien life in exotic forms on other worlds |journal=[[Naturwissenschaften]] |volume=93 |issue=4 |pages=155–72 |bibcode=2006NW.....93..155S |doi=10.1007/s00114-005-0078-6 |pmid=16525788 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on how life might have emerged from non-living chemicals focuses on three possible starting points: [[self-replication]], an organism's ability to produce offspring that are very similar to itself; metabolism, its ability to feed and repair itself; and external [[cell membrane]]s, which allow food to enter and waste products to leave, but exclude unwanted substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peretó |first=Juli |year=2005 |title=Controversies on the origin of life |url=http://www.im.microbios.org/0801/0801023.pdf |format=PDF |journal=[[International Microbiology]] |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=23–31 |pmid=15906258 |accessdate=2007-10-07 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on abiogenesis still has a long way to go, since theoretical and [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] approaches are only beginning to make contact with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Szathmáry |first=Eörs |authorlink=Eörs Szathmáry |date=February 3, 2005 |title=Life: In search of the simplest cell |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v433/n7025/full/433469a.html |journal=Nature |volume=433 |issue=7025 |pages=469–470 |bibcode=2005Natur.433..469S |doi=10.1038/433469a |accessdate=2008-09-01 |pmid=15690023 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Luisi |first1=Pier Luigi |authorlink1=Pier Luigi Luisi |last2=Ferri |first2=Francesca |last3=Stano |first3=Pasquale |date=January 2006 |title=Approaches to semi-synthetic minimal cells: a review |journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=93 |issue=1 |pages=1–13 |bibcode=2006NW.....93....1L |doi=10.1007/s00114-005-0056-z |pmid=16292523 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even the simplest members of the [[Three-domain system|three modern domains]] of life use [[DNA]] to record their "[[Genetic memory (biology)|recipes]]" and a complex array of [[RNA]] and [[protein]] molecules to "read" these instructions and use them for growth, maintenance and self-replication.

==== Metabolism first: Iron–sulfur world ====
{{main|Iron–sulfur world theory}}
A series of experiments starting in 1997 showed that early stages in the formation of proteins from inorganic materials including [[carbon monoxide]] and [[hydrogen sulfide]] could be achieved by using [[iron(II) sulfide|iron sulfide]] and [[nickel sulfide]] as [[catalyst]]s. Most of the steps required temperatures of about {{convert|100|°C|°F}} and moderate pressures, although one stage required {{convert|250|°C|°F}} and a pressure equivalent to that found under {{convert|7|km|mi}} of rock. Hence it was suggested that self-sustaining synthesis of proteins could have occurred near hydrothermal vents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wächtershäuser |first=Günter |authorlink=Günter Wächtershäuser |date=August 25, 2000 |title=Life as We Don't Know It |journal=Science |volume=289 |issue=5483 |pages=1307–1308 |doi=10.1126/science.289.5483.1307 |pmid=10979855 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The clay hypothesis ====

RNA is complex and there are doubts about whether it can be produced non-biologically in the wild.&lt;ref name="RNANaturalSynthesisProblems" /&gt; Some [[clay]]s, notably [[montmorillonite]], have properties that make them plausible accelerators for the emergence of an RNA world: they grow by self-replication of their [[crystal]]line pattern; they are subject to an analog of natural selection, as the clay "species" that grows fastest in a particular environment rapidly becomes dominant; and they can catalyze the formation of RNA molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cairns-Smith|1968|pp=57–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this idea has not become the scientific consensus, it still has active supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ferris |first=James P. |date=June 1999 |title=Prebiotic Synthesis on Minerals: Bridging the Prebiotic and RNA Worlds |journal=[[The Biological Bulletin]] |volume=196 |issue=3 |pages=311–314 |doi=10.2307/1542957 |jstor=1542957 |pmid=10390828 |ref=harv}} "This paper was originally presented at a workshop titled ''Evolution: A Molecular Point of View''."&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in 2003 reported that montmorillonite could also accelerate the conversion of [[fatty acid]]s into "bubbles," and that the "bubbles" could encapsulate RNA attached to the clay. These "bubbles" can then grow by absorbing additional lipids and then divide. The formation of the earliest cells may have been aided by similar processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hanczyc |first1=Martin M. |last2=Fujikawa |first2=Shelly M. |last3=Szostak |first3=Jack W. |authorlink3=Jack W.

===Chromatin, nucleus, endomembrane system, and mitochondria===
Eukaryotes may have been present long before the oxygenation of the atmosphere,&lt;ref name="GlansdorffXuLabedan2008LUCA" /&gt; but most modern eukaryotes require oxygen, which their [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] use to fuel the production of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], the internal energy supply of all known cells.&lt;ref name="HedgesBlairEtAl2004molecularTimescaleOfEukaryoteEvolution" /&gt; In the 1970s it was proposed and, after much debate, widely accepted that eukaryotes emerged as a result of a sequence of endosymbiosis between "[[prokaryote]]s." For example: a [[predator]]y microorganism invaded a large prokaryote, probably an [[archaea]]n, but the attack was neutralized, and the attacker took up residence and evolved into the first of the mitochondria; one of these [[Chimera (genetics)|chimera]]s later tried to swallow a photosynthesizing cyanobacterium, but the victim survived inside the attacker and the new combination became the ancestor of [[plant]]s; and so on. After each endosymbiosis began, the partners would have eliminated unproductive duplication of genetic functions by re-arranging their genomes, a process which sometimes involved transfer of genes between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Margulis|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vellai |first1=Tibor |last2=Vida |first2=Gábor |date=August 7, 1999 |title=The origin of eukaryotes: the difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |volume=266 |issue=1428 |pages=1571–1577 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1999.0817 |pmc=1690172 |pmid=10467746 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Selosse |first1=Marc-André |last2=Abert |first2=Béatrice |last3=Godelle |first3=Bernard |date=March 1, 2001 |title=Reducing the genome size of organelles favours gene transfer to the nucleus |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016953470002084X |journal=[[Trends (journals)|Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution]] |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=135–141 |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(00)02084-X |accessdate=2015-01-29 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another hypothesis proposes that mitochondria were originally [[sulfur]]- or [[hydrogen]]-metabolising endosymbionts, and became oxygen-consumers later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pisani |first1=Davide |last2=Cotton |first2=James A. |last3=McInerney |first3=James O. |date=August 2007 |title=Supertrees Disentangle the Chimerical Origin of Eukaryotic Genomes |journal=[[Molecular Biology and Evolution]] |volume=24 |issue=8 |pages=1752–1760 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msm095 |pmid=17504772 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, mitochondria might have been part of eukaryotes' original equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gray |first1=Michael W. |last2=Burger |first2=Gertraud |last3=Lang |first3=B.

=== Plastids ===
[[Plastid]]s, the superclass of [[organelle]]s of which [[chloroplast]]s are the best-known exemplar, are thought to have originated from [[Endosymbiosis|endosymbiotic]] cyanobacteria.

== Sexual reproduction and multicellular organisms ==

=== Evolution of sexual reproduction ===
{{Main|Evolution of sexual reproduction|Sexual reproduction}}
The defining characteristics of [[sexual reproduction]] in eukaryotes are [[meiosis]] and [[fertilization]]. There is much [[genetic recombination]] in this kind of reproduction, in which offspring receive 50% of their genes from each parent,&lt;ref name="Jokela2001SexAdvantage" /&gt; in contrast with [[asexual reproduction]], in which there is no recombination. Bacteria also exchange DNA by [[bacterial conjugation]], the benefits of which include resistance to [[antibiotic resistance|antibiotic]]s and other [[toxin]]s, and the ability to utilize new [[metabolite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holmes|Jobling|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, conjugation is not a means of reproduction, and is not limited to members of the same species&amp;nbsp;– there are cases where bacteria transfer DNA to plants and animals.&lt;ref name="Christie, P. J. 2001 294–305"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Christie |first=Peter J. |date=April 2001 |title=Type IV secretion: intercellular transfer of macromolecules by systems ancestrally related to conjugation machines |journal=[[Molecular Microbiology (journal)|Molecular Microbiology]] |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=294–305 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2958.2001.02302.x |pmid=11309113 |pmc=3922410 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, bacterial transformation is clearly an adaptation for transfer of DNA between bacteria of the same species. Bacterial transformation is a complex process involving the products of numerous bacterial genes and can be regarded as a bacterial form of sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Michod |first1=Richard E. |last2=Bernstein |first2=Harris |last3=Nedelcu |first3=Aurora M. |date=May 2008 |title=Adaptive value of sex in microbial pathogens |url=http://www.hummingbirds.arizona.edu/Faculty/Michod/Downloads/IGE%20review%20sex.pdf |format=PDF |journal=[[Infection, Genetics and Evolution]] |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=267–285 |doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2008.01.002 |pmid=18295550 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=Harris |last2=Bernstein |first2=Carol |date=July 2010|title=Evolutionary Origin of Recombination during Meiosis |journal=[[BioScience]] |volume=60 |issue=7 |pages=498–505 |doi=10.1525/bio.2010.60.7.5 |ref=harv|bibcode=1985BioSc..35..499W }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process occurs naturally in at least 67 prokaryotic species (in seven different phyla).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnsborg |first1=Ola |last2=Eldholm |first2=Vegard |last3=Håvarstein |first3=Leiv Sigve |date=December 2007 |title=Natural genetic transformation: prevalence, mechanisms and function |journal=Research in Microbiology |volume=158 |issue=10 |pages=767–778 |doi=10.1016/j.resmic.2007.09.004 |pmid=17997281 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual reproduction in eukaryotes may have evolved from bacterial transformation.&lt;ref name="novapublishers.com"&gt;{{harvnb|Bernstein|Bernstein|Michod|2012|pp=1–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Also see [[Evolution of sexual reproduction#Origin of sexual reproduction]].)

The disadvantages of sexual reproduction are well-known: the genetic reshuffle of recombination may break up favorable combinations of genes; and since males do not directly increase the number of offspring in the next generation, an asexual population can out-breed and displace in as little as 50 generations a sexual population that is equal in every other respect.&lt;ref name="Jokela2001SexAdvantage"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Neiman |first1=Maurine |title=Encyclopedia of Life Sciences |last2=Jokela |first2=Jukka |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia of Life Sciences]] |year=2010 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |location=Hoboken, NJ |isbn=978-0-470-01617-6 |doi=10.1002/9780470015902.a0001716.pub2|chapter=Sex: Advantage }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the great majority of animals, plants, fungi and [[protist]]s reproduce sexually.

The [[Red Queen hypothesis]] suggests that sexual reproduction provides protection against [[parasite]]s, because it is easier for parasites to evolve means of overcoming the defenses of genetically identical [[cloning|clone]]s than those of sexual species that present moving targets, and there is some experimental evidence for this. However, there is still doubt about whether it would explain the survival of sexual species if multiple similar clone species were present, as one of the clones may survive the attacks of parasites for long enough to out-breed the sexual species.&lt;ref name="Jokela2001SexAdvantage" /&gt; Furthermore, contrary to the expectations of the Red Queen hypothesis, Kathryn A. Hanley et al. found that the prevalence, abundance and mean intensity of mites was significantly higher in sexual geckos than in asexuals sharing the same habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hanley |first1=Kathryn A. |last2=Fisher |first2=Robert N. |last3=Case |first3=Ted J. |date=June 1995 |title=Lower Mite Infestations in an Asexual Gecko Compared With Its Sexual Ancestors |journal=[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]] |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=418–426 |doi=10.2307/2410266 |ref=harv|jstor=2410266 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, biologist Matthew Parker, after reviewing numerous genetic studies on plant disease resistance, failed to find a single example consistent with the concept that pathogens are the primary selective agent responsible for sexual reproduction in the host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parker |first1=Matthew A. |date=September 1994 |title=Pathogens and sex in plants |journal=Evolutionary Ecology |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=560–584 |doi=10.1007/bf01238258 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexey Kondrashov]]'s ''deterministic mutation hypothesis'' (DMH) assumes that each organism has more than one harmful mutation and the combined effects of these mutations are more harmful than the sum of the harm done by each individual mutation. If so, sexual recombination of genes will reduce the harm that bad mutations do to offspring and at the same time eliminate some bad mutations from the [[gene pool]] by isolating them in individuals that perish quickly because they have an above-average number of bad mutations. However, the evidence suggests that the DMH's assumptions are shaky because many species have on average less than one harmful mutation per individual and no species that has been investigated shows evidence of [[synergy]] between harmful mutations.&lt;ref name="Jokela2001SexAdvantage" /&gt; (Further criticisms of this hypothesis are discussed in the article [[Evolution of sexual reproduction#Removal of deleterious genes]])

The random nature of recombination causes the relative abundance of alternative traits to vary from one generation to another. This [[genetic drift]] is insufficient on its own to make sexual reproduction advantageous, but a combination of genetic drift and natural selection may be sufficient. When chance produces combinations of good traits, natural selection gives a large advantage to lineages in which these traits become genetically linked. On the other hand, the benefits of good traits are neutralized if they appear along with bad traits. Sexual recombination gives good traits the opportunities to become linked with other good traits, and mathematical models suggest this may be more than enough to offset the disadvantages of sexual reproduction.&lt;ref name="OttoGerstein2006WhySex" /&gt; Other combinations of hypotheses that are inadequate on their own are also being examined.&lt;ref name="Jokela2001SexAdvantage" /&gt;

The following hypotheses attempt to explain how and why sex evolved:
*It may have enabled organisms to repair genetic damage.&lt;ref name="dna-repair"&gt;{{cite journal

*Sexual reproduction may have originated from [[Selfish DNA|selfish parasitic genetic elements]] propagating themselves by transfer to new hosts.&lt;ref name="hickey"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hickey, D. | title = Selfish DNA: A Sexually-Transmitted Nuclear Parasite | journal = Genetics | volume = 101 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 519–31 | year = 1982 | pmid = 6293914 | pmc = 1201875}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*It may have evolved from [[cannibalism]], where some of the victim's DNA was incorporated into the cannibal organism.&lt;ref name="TatianaSexAdvice"/&gt;
*Sexual reproduction may have evolved from ancient [[haloarchaea]] through a combination of [[jumping genes]], and swapping [[plasmid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Extreme Microbes | first1=S. | last1=DasSarma | doi = 10.1511/2007.65.1024 | journal=American Scientist | year=2007 | volume=95 |issue=3| pages= 224–231 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Or it may have evolved as a form of [[vaccination]] in which infected hosts exchanged weakened [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] copies of parasitic DNA as protection against more virulent versions. The [[meiosis]] stage of sexual reproduction may then have evolved as a way of removing the symbiotes.&lt;ref name="Sterrer"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sterrer, W. | title = On the origin of sex as vaccination | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 216 | pages = 387–96 | year = 2002 | doi = 10.1006/jtbi.2002.3008

[[Bacteria]] also exchange [[DNA]] by [[bacterial conjugation]], the benefits of which include resistance to [[antibiotic resistance|antibiotics]] and other [[toxin]]s, and the ability to utilize new [[metabolite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Holmes |first1=Randall K. |last2=Jobling |first2=Michael G. |year=1996 |chapter=Genetics |chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7908/ |editor-last=Baron |editor-first=Samuel |title=Medical Microbiology |edition=4th |location=Galveston, TX |publisher=[[University of Texas Medical Branch]] |at=Exchange of Genetic Information |isbn=0-9631172-1-1 |lccn=95050499 |oclc=33838234 |pmid=21413277 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, conjugation is not a means of reproduction and is not limited to members of the same species, and there are cases where bacteria transfer DNA to plants and animals.&lt;ref name="Christie, P. J. 2001 294–305"/&gt; Nevertheless, it may be an example of the "selfish genetic element" hypothesis, as it transfers DNA by means of such a "selfish gene," the [[F-plasmid]].&lt;ref name="TatianaSexAdvice"/&gt;

The adaptive function of sex today remains a major unresolved issue in biology. The competing models to explain the adaptive function of sex were reviewed by John A. Birdsell and [[Christopher Wills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Birdsell|Wills|2003|pp=27–137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypotheses discussed above all depend on the possible beneficial effects of random genetic variation produced by genetic recombination. An alternative view is that sex arose and is maintained, as a process for repairing DNA damage, and that the genetic variation produced is an occasionally beneficial byproduct.&lt;ref name="novapublishers.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernstein|Hopf|Michod|1987|pp=323–370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multicellularity ===
{{main|Multicellular organism }}
The simplest definitions of "multicellular," for example "having multiple cells," could include [[Colony (biology)|colonial]] cyanobacteria like ''[[Nostoc]]''. Even a technical definition such as "having the same genome but different types of cell" would still include some [[genus|genera]] of the green algae [[Volvox]], which have cells that specialize in reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bell |first1=Graham |authorlink1=Graham Bell (biologist) |last2=Mooers |first2=Arne O. |year=1997 |title=Size and complexity among multicellular organisms |url=http://biology.mcgill.ca/faculty/bell/articles/70.BellMooers_1997_BJLS60.pdf |format=PDF |journal=[[Biological Journal of the Linnean Society]] |volume=60 |issue=3|pages=345–363 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.1997.tb01500.x |accessdate=2015-02-02 |ref=hav}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multicellularity evolved independently in organisms as diverse as [[sponge]]s and other animals, fungi, plants, [[brown algae]], cyanobacteria, [[slime mold]]s and [[myxobacteria]].&lt;ref name="Fedonkin2003OriginOfMetazoa"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fedonkin |first=Mikhail A. |authorlink=Mikhail Fedonkin |date=March 31, 2003 |title=The origin of the Metazoa in the light of the Proterozoic fossil record |url=http://www.vend.paleo.ru/pub/Fedonkin_2003.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Paleontological Research |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=9–41 |doi=10.2517/prpsj.7.9 |accessdate=2008-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226122725/http://www.vend.paleo.ru/pub/Fedonkin_2003.pdf |archivedate=February 26, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kaiser |first=Dale |authorlink=A.

The initial advantages of multicellularity may have included: more efficient sharing of nutrients that are digested outside the cell,&lt;ref name="Koschwanezetal2011PLoS"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koschwanez |first1=John H. |last2=Foster |first2=Kevin R. |last3=Murray |first3=Andrew W. |date=August 9, 2011 |title=Sucrose Utilization in Budding Yeast as a Model for the Origin of Undifferentiated Multicellularity |journal=PLOS Biology |volume=9 |issue=8 |pages=e1001122 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001122 |pmid=21857801 |pmc=3153487 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; increased resistance to predators, many of which attacked by engulfing; the ability to resist currents by attaching to a firm surface; the ability to reach upwards to filter-feed or to obtain sunlight for photosynthesis;&lt;ref name="Butterfield2000Bangiomorpha" /&gt; the ability to create an internal environment that gives protection against the external one;&lt;ref name="Bonner1999OriginsOfMulticellularity" /&gt; and even the opportunity for a group of cells to behave "intelligently" by sharing information.&lt;ref name="NakagakiYamadaTóth2000Intelligence"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nakagaki |first1=Toshiyuki |last2=Yamada |first2=Hiroyasu |last3=Tóth |first3=Ágota |date=September 28, 2000 |title=Intelligence: Maze-solving by an amoeboid organism |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v407/n6803/abs/407470a0.html |journal=Nature |volume=407 |issue=6803 |pages=470 |doi=10.1038/35035159 |pmid=11028990 |accessdate=2008-09-03 |ref=harv|bibcode=2000Natur.407..470N }}&lt;/ref&gt; These features would also have provided opportunities for other organisms to diversify, by creating more varied environments than flat microbial mats could.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2000Bangiomorpha" /&gt;

Multicellularity with differentiated cells is beneficial to the organism as a whole but disadvantageous from the point of view of individual cells, most of which lose the opportunity to reproduce themselves. In an asexual multicellular organism, rogue cells which retain the ability to reproduce may take over and reduce the organism to a mass of undifferentiated cells. Sexual reproduction eliminates such rogue cells from the next generation and therefore appears to be a prerequisite for complex multicellularity.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2000Bangiomorpha" /&gt;

The available evidence indicates that eukaryotes evolved much earlier but remained inconspicuous until a rapid diversification around 1 Ga. The only respect in which eukaryotes clearly surpass bacteria and archaea is their capacity for variety of forms, and sexual reproduction enabled eukaryotes to exploit that advantage by producing organisms with multiple cells that differed in form and function.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2000Bangiomorpha" /&gt;

By comparing the composition of transcription factor families and regulatory network motifs between unicellular organisms and multicellular organisms, scientists found there are many novel transcription factor families and three novel types of regulatory network motifs in multicellular organisms, and novel family transcription factors are preferentially wired into these novel network motifs which are essential for multicullular development. These results propose a plausible mechanism for the contribution of novel-family transcription factors and novel network motifs to the origin of multicellular organisms at transcriptional regulatory level.&lt;ref name="MBE_1767"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jin JP, et al. | title= An Arabidopsis transcriptional regulatory map reveals distinct functional and evolutionary features of novel transcription factors|journal= Molecular Biology and Evolution | date=July 2015 |volume=32 |issue=7|doi=10.1093/molbev/msv058 |url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/32/7/1767.full |pmid=25750178 |pmc=4476157 |pages=1767–1773}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is still debate about the classification of these specimens, mainly because the diagnostic features which allow taxonomists to classify more recent organisms, such as similarities to living organisms, are generally absent in the Ediacarans.

The [[small shelly fauna]] are a very mixed collection of fossils found between the Late Ediacaran and [[Cambrian Series 3|Middle Cambrian]] periods. The earliest, ''[[Cloudinid|Cloudina]]'', shows signs of successful defense against predation and may indicate the start of an [[evolutionary arms race]].

=== Evolution of terrestrial antioxidants ===
Oxygen is a potent [[Oxidizing agent|oxidant]] whose accumulation in terrestrial atmosphere resulted from the development of [[photosynthesis]] over 3 Ga, in cyanobacteria (blue-green algae), which were the most primitive oxygenic photosynthetic organisms. Brown algae accumulate inorganic mineral [[antioxidant]]s such as [[rubidium]], [[vanadium]], [[zinc]], iron, [[copper]], [[molybdenum]], [[selenium]] and [[iodine]] which is concentrated more than 30,000 times the concentration of this element in seawater. Protective endogenous antioxidant enzymes and exogenous dietary antioxidants helped to prevent oxidative damage. Most marine mineral antioxidants act in the cells as essential [[trace element]]s in [[redox]] and antioxidant [[Metalloprotein|metalloenzymes]].

When plants and animals began to enter rivers and land about 500 Ma, environmental deficiency of these marine mineral antioxidants was a challenge to the evolution of terrestrial life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Venturi |first=Sebastiano |date=September 2011 |title=Evolutionary Significance of Iodine |journal=Current Chemical Biology |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=155–162 |doi=10.2174/187231311796765012 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Crockford |first=Susan J. |date=August 2009 |title=Evolutionary roots of iodine and thyroid hormones in cell-cell signaling |journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=155–166 |doi=10.1093/icb/icp053 |pmid=21669854 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terrestrial plants slowly optimized the production of “new” endogenous antioxidants such as [[ascorbic acid]], [[polyphenol]]s, [[flavonoid]]s, [[tocopherol]]s, etc. A few of these appeared more recently, in last 200–50 Ma, in [[fruit]]s and [[flower]]s of [[angiosperm]] plants.

In fact, angiosperms (the dominant type of plant today) and most of their antioxidant pigments evolved during the [[Late Jurassic]] period. Plants employ antioxidants to defend their structures against [[reactive oxygen species]] produced during photosynthesis. Animals are exposed to the same oxidants, and they have evolved endogenous enzymatic antioxidant systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Venturi |first1=Sebastiano |last2=Donati |first2=Francesco M. |last3=Venturi |first3=Alessandro |last4=Venturi |first4=Mattia |date=August 2000 |title=Environmental Iodine Deficiency: A Challenge to the Evolution of Terrestrial Life? |journal=[[Thyroid (journal)|Thyroid]] |volume=10 |issue=8 |pages=727–729 |doi=10.1089/10507250050137851 |pmid=11014322 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iodine]] is the most primitive and abundant electron-rich essential element in the diet of marine and terrestrial organisms, and as iodide acts as an [[electron donor]] and has this ancestral antioxidant function in all iodide-concentrating cells from primitive marine algae to more recent terrestrial vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Küpper |first1=Frithjof C. |last2=Carpenter |first2=Lucy J. |last3=McFiggans |first3=Gordon B. |last4=Palmer |first4=Carl J. |last5=Waite |first5=Tim J. |last6=Boneberg |first6=Eva-Maria |last7=Woitsch |first7=Sonja |last8=Weiller |first8=Markus |last9=Abela |first9=Rafael |date=May 13, 2008 |title=Iodide accumulation provides kelp with an inorganic antioxidant impacting atmospheric chemistry |journal=Proc.

Life on land required plants to become internally more complex and specialized: photosynthesis was most efficient at the top; roots were required in order to extract water from the ground; the parts in between became supports and transport systems for water and nutrients.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLifeEd3P120To122" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KenrickCrane1997EvolutionOfLandPlants" /&gt;

Spores of land plants, possibly rather like [[Marchantiophyta|liverworts]], have been found in Middle Ordovician rocks dated to about {{ma|476|Ma|Ordovician}}. In [[Wenlock (Silurian)|Middle Silurian]] rocks {{ma|430|Ma|Silurian}}, there are fossils of actual plants including [[Lycopodiopsida|clubmoss]]es such as ''[[Baragwanathia]]''; most were under {{convert|10|cm|in}} high, and some appear closely related to [[vascular plant]]s, the group that includes [[tree]]s.&lt;ref name="KenrickCrane1997EvolutionOfLandPlants"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kenrick |first1=Paul |last2=Crane |first2=Peter R. |authorlink2=Peter Crane |date=September 4, 1997 |title=The origin and early evolution of plants on land |url=http://biology.kenyon.edu/courses/biol112/Biol112WebPage/Syllabus/Topics/Week%207/land%20plants.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Nature |volume=389 |issue=6646 |pages=33–39 |bibcode=1997Natur.389...33K |doi=10.1038/37918 |accessdate=2015-02-10 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the Late Devonian {{ma|370|Ma|Devonian}}, trees such as ''[[Archaeopteris]]'' were so abundant that they changed river systems from mostly [[braided river|braided]] to mostly [[meander]]ing, because their roots bound the soil firmly.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Briggs and Crowther 2001|Scheckler 2001]], "Afforestation—the First Forests," pp. 67–70&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, they caused the "Late Devonian wood crisis"&lt;ref&gt;The phrase "Late Devonian wood crisis" is used at {{cite web |url=http://palaeos.com/vertebrates/tetrapoda/acanthostega.html |title=Tetrapoda: ''Acanthostega'' |website=[[Palaeos]] |accessdate=2015-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; because:
* They removed more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, reducing the [[greenhouse effect]] and thus causing an [[ice age]] in the [[Carboniferous]] period.&lt;ref name="AlgeoScheckler1998errestrialMarineTeleconnectionsInDevonian"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Algeo |first1=Thomas J. |last2=Scheckler |first2=Stephen E. |date=January 29, 1998 |title=Terrestrial-marine teleconnections in the Devonian: links between the evolution of land plants, weathering processes, and marine anoxic events |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B |volume=353 |issue=1365 |pages=113–130 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1998.0195 |pmc=1692181 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later ecosystems the carbon dioxide "locked up" in wood is returned to the atmosphere by decomposition of dead wood.

* The increasing depth of plants' roots led to more washing of nutrients into rivers and seas by rain. This caused [[algal bloom]]s whose high consumption of oxygen caused [[anoxic event]]s in deeper waters, increasing the extinction rate among deep-water animals.&lt;ref name="AlgeoScheckler1998errestrialMarineTeleconnectionsInDevonian" /&gt;

=== Land invertebrates ===
Animals had to change their feeding and [[Excretion|excretory]] systems, and most land animals developed [[internal fertilization]] of their eggs.&lt;ref name="Garwood" /&gt; The difference in [[refractive index]] between water and air required changes in their eyes. On the other hand, in some ways movement and breathing became easier, and the better transmission of high-frequency sounds in air encouraged the development of [[hearing]].&lt;ref name="Selden2001TerrestrializationOfAnimals" /&gt;

The [[Fossil#Fossil record|fossil record]] of other major invertebrate groups on land is poor: none at all for non-[[Parasitism|parasitic]] [[flatworm]]s, [[nematode]]s or [[nemertea]]ns; some parasitic nematodes have been fossilized in [[amber]]; annelid worm fossils are known from the Carboniferous, but they may still have been aquatic animals; the earliest fossils of [[Gastropoda|gastropod]]s on land date from the Late Carboniferous, and this group may have had to wait until [[Plant litter|leaf litter]] became abundant enough to provide the moist conditions they need.&lt;ref name="Selden2001TerrestrializationOfAnimals"&gt;[[#Briggs and Crowther 2001|Selden 2001]], "Terrestrialization of Animals," pp. 71–74&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest confirmed fossils of flying [[insect]]s date from the Late Carboniferous, but it is thought that insects developed the ability to fly in the Early Carboniferous or even Late Devonian. This gave them a wider range of [[ecological niche]]s for feeding and breeding, and a means of escape from predators and from unfavorable changes in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grimaldi|Engel|2005|pp=155–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 99% of modern insect species fly or are descendants of flying species.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grimaldi|Engel|2005|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;Family tree of [[tetrapod]]s&lt;ref name="AhlbergMilner1994OriginOfTetrapods" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
[[Tetrapod]]s, vertebrates with four limbs, evolved from other [[rhipidistia]]n fish over a relatively short timespan during the Late Devonian ({{ma|370|360|Ma|Devonian}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gordon |first1=Malcolm S. |last2=Graham |first2=Jeffrey B. |last3=Wang |first3=Tobias |date=September–October 2004 |title=Introduction to the Special Collection: Revisiting the Vertebrate Invasion of the Land |journal=[[Physiological and Biochemical Zoology]] |volume=77 |issue=5 |pages=697–699 |doi=10.1086/425182 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early groups are grouped together as [[Labyrinthodontia]]. They retained aquatic, fry-like [[tadpole]]s, a system still seen in [[Lissamphibia|modern amphibians]]. 

Iodine and T4/T3  stimulate the amphibian metamorphosis and the [[evolution of nervous systems]] transforming the aquatic, vegetarian tadpole into  a “more evoluted” terrestrial, carnivorous frog with better neurological, visuospatial, olfactory and cognitive abilities for hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Venturi, Sebastiano|title=Evolutionary Significance of Iodine|journal=Current Chemical Biology-|volume=5 |pages=155–162|year=2011|doi=10.2174/187231311796765012|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The new hormonal action of T3 was made possible by the formation of T3-receptors in the cells of vertebrates. Firstly, about 600-500 million years ago, in primitive Chordata appeared the alpha T3-receptors with a metamorphosing action and then, about 250-150 million years ago, in the Birds and Mammalia appeared the beta T3-receptors with metabolic and thermogenetic actions.&lt;ref name=Venturi&gt;{{cite book | last = Venturi | first = S |author2=Bégin ME | year = 2010 | chapter = Thyroid Hormone, Iodine and Human Brain Evolution | title= Environmental Influences on Human Brain Evolution | editors = Cunnane S; Stewart K | publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=gfkRnv20GtsC&amp;pg=PA105#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 105–124] | isbn = 978-0-470-45268-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1950s to the early 1980s it was thought that tetrapods evolved from fish that had already acquired the ability to crawl on land, possibly in order to go from a pool that was drying out to one that was deeper. However, in 1987, nearly complete fossils of ''[[Acanthostega]]'' from about {{ma|363|Ma|Devonian}} showed that this Late Devonian [[Transitional fossil|transitional]] animal had [[leg]]s and both [[lung]]s and [[gill]]s, but could never have survived on land: its limbs and its wrist and ankle joints were too weak to bear its weight; its ribs were too short to prevent its lungs from being squeezed flat by its weight; its fish-like tail fin would have been damaged by dragging on the ground. The current hypothesis is that ''Acanthostega'', which was about {{convert|1|m|ft}} long, was a wholly aquatic predator that hunted in shallow water&lt;!-- , using its limbs to hold on to vegetation while it lay in ambush --&gt;. Its skeleton differed from that of most fish, in ways that enabled it to raise its head to breathe air while its body remained submerged, including: its jaws show modifications that would have enabled it to gulp air; the bones at the back of its skull are locked together, providing strong attachment points for muscles that raised its head; the head is not joined to the [[shoulder girdle]] and it has a distinct neck.&lt;ref name="Clack2005GettingLegUp"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clack |first=Jennifer A. |authorlink=Jenny Clack |date=December 2005 |title=Getting a Leg Up on Land |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/getting-a-leg-up-on-land/ |journal=Scientific American |volume=293 |issue=6 |pages=100–107 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1205-100 |accessdate=2015-02-12 |ref=harv |pmid=16323697|bibcode=2005SciAm.293f.100C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Devonian proliferation of land plants may help to explain why air breathing would have been an advantage: leaves falling into streams and rivers would have encouraged the growth of aquatic vegetation; this would have attracted grazing invertebrates and small fish that preyed on them; they would have been attractive prey but the environment was unsuitable for the big marine predatory fish; air-breathing would have been necessary because these waters would have been short of oxygen, since warm water holds less [[Oxygen saturation|dissolved oxygen]] than cooler marine water and since the decomposition of vegetation would have used some of the oxygen.&lt;ref name="Clack2005GettingLegUp" /&gt;

Later discoveries revealed earlier transitional forms between ''Acanthostega'' and completely fish-like animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Daeschler |first1=Edward B. |authorlink1=Ted Daeschler |last2=Shubin |first2=Neil H. |authorlink2=Neil Shubin |last3=Jenkins |first3=Farish A., Jr. |authorlink3=Farish Jenkins |date=April 6, 2006 |title=A Devonian tetrapod-like fish and the evolution of the tetrapod body plan |url=http://courses.washington.edu/bio354/Paper%203.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Nature |volume=440 |pages=757–763 |issue=7085 |bibcode=2006Natur.440..757D |doi=10.1038/nature04639 |pmid=16598249 |accessdate=2015-02-12 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, there is then a gap ([[Romer's gap]]) of about 30 Ma between the fossils of ancestral tetrapods and Middle Carboniferous fossils of vertebrates that look well-adapted for life on land. Some of these look like early relatives of modern amphibians, most of which need to keep their skins moist and to lay their eggs in water, while others are accepted as early relatives of the [[amniote]]s, whose waterproof skin and egg membranes enable them to live and breed far from water.&lt;ref name="AhlbergMilner1994OriginOfTetrapods"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ahlberg |first1=Per E. |authorlink1=Per E.

== Social insects ==

{{main|Eusociality}}
The social insects are remarkable because the great majority of individuals in each colony are sterile. This appears contrary to basic concepts of evolution such as natural selection and the [[Gene-centered view of evolution|selfish gene]]. In fact, there are very few [[Eusociality|eusocial]] insect species: only 15 out of approximately 2,600 living [[family (biology)|families]] of insects contain eusocial species, and it seems that eusociality has evolved independently only 12 times among arthropods, although some eusocial lineages have diversified into several families. Nevertheless, social insects have been spectacularly successful; for example although [[ant]]s and [[termite]]s account for only about 2% of known insect species, they form over 50% of the total mass of insects. Their ability to control a territory appears to be the foundation of their success.&lt;ref name="WilsonHölldobler2005EusocialityOriginConsequences"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilson |first1=Edward O. |authorlink1=E. O.

The sacrifice of breeding opportunities by most individuals has long been explained as a consequence of these species' unusual [[Haplodiploidy|haplodiploid]] method of [[sex-determination system|sex determination]], which has the paradoxical consequence that two sterile worker daughters of the same queen share more genes with each other than they would with their offspring if they could breed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hughes |first1=William O.

O. Wilson]] and [[Bert Hölldobler]] argue that this explanation is faulty: for example, it is based on [[kin selection]], but there is no evidence of [[nepotism]] in colonies that have multiple queens. Instead, they write, eusociality evolves only in species that are under strong pressure from predators and competitors, but in environments where it is possible to build "fortresses"; after colonies have established this security, they gain other advantages through co-operative [[foraging]]. In support of this explanation they cite the appearance of eusociality in [[Blesmol|bathyergid]] mole rats,&lt;ref name="WilsonHölldobler2005EusocialityOriginConsequences" /&gt; which are not haplodiploid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lovegrove |first=Barry G. |date=January 1991 |title=The evolution of eusociality in molerats (Bathyergidae): a question of risks, numbers, and costs |journal=[[Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology]] |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=37–45 |doi=10.1007/BF00172137 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest fossils of insects have been found in Early Devonian rocks from about {{ma|400|Ma|Devonian}}, which preserve only a few varieties of flightless insect. The [[Mazon Creek fossil beds|Mazon Creek lagerstätten]] from the Late Carboniferous, about {{ma|300|Ma|Carboniferous}}, include about 200 species, some gigantic by modern standards, and indicate that insects had occupied their main modern ecological niches as [[herbivore]]s, [[detritivore]]s and insectivores. Social termites and ants first appear in the Early Cretaceous, and advanced social bees have been found in Late Cretaceous rocks but did not become abundant until the Middle [[Cenozoic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Labandeira|Eble|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that, along with other life forms, modern-day humans evolved from an ancient, common ancestor was proposed by [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]] in 1844 and taken up by [[Charles Darwin]] in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://darwin200.christs.cam.ac.uk/pages/index.php?page_id=c8 |title=Darwin &amp; the Descent of Man |last=Montgomery |first=Stephen |year=2009 |website=Charles Darwin &amp; Evolution |publisher=[[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's College]] |location=Cambridge |accessdate=2015-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225222347/http://darwin200.christs.cam.ac.uk/pages/index.php?page_id=c8 |archivedate=2015-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern humans evolved from a lineage of upright-walking [[ape]]s that has been traced back over {{ma|6|Ma}} to ''[[Sahelanthropus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brunet |first1=Michel |authorlink1=Michel Brunet (paleontologist) |last2=Guy |first2=Franck |last3=Pilbeam |first3=David |authorlink3=David Pilbeam |last4=Mackaye |first4=Hassane Taisso |last5=Likius |first5=Andossa |last6=Ahounta |first6=Djimdoumalbaye |last7=Beauvilain |first7=Alain |last8=Blondel |first8=Cécile |date=July 11, 2002 |title=A new hominid from the Upper Miocene of Chad, Central Africa |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v418/n6894/abs/nature00879.html |journal=Nature |volume=418 |issue=6894 |pages=145–151 |doi=10.1038/nature00879 |pmid=12110880 |accessdate=2008-09-09 |display-authors=3 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first known [[stone tool]]s were made about {{ma|2.5|Ma}}, apparently by ''[[Australopithecus garhi]]'', and were found near animal bones that bear scratches made by these tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Heinzelin |first1=Jean |authorlink1=Jean de Heinzelin de Braucourt |last2=Clark |first2=J.

== Mass extinctions ==
{{main|Extinction event}}
{{annotated image/Extinction|caption=Apparent extinction intensity, i.e. the fraction of [[Genus|genera]] going extinct at any given time, as reconstructed from the [[Fossil#Fossil record|fossil record]]. (Graph not meant to include the recent, ongoing [[Holocene extinction]] event).}}
Life on Earth has suffered occasional mass extinctions at least since {{ma|542|Ma}}. Although they were disasters at the time, mass extinctions have sometimes accelerated the evolution of life on Earth. When dominance of particular ecological niches passes from one group of organisms to another, it is rarely because the new dominant group is "superior" to the old and usually because an extinction event eliminates the old dominant group and makes way for the new one.&lt;ref name="Van Valkenburgh 1999 463–493" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benton|2005a|loc=Chapter 6: "Tetrapods of the Triassic"}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Phanerozoic biodiversity | float=right}}
The fossil record appears to show that the gaps between mass extinctions are becoming longer and the average and background rates of extinction are decreasing. Both of these phenomena could be explained in one or more ways:&lt;ref name="MacLeod2001Extinction"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firstscience.com/SITE/ARTICLES/macleod.asp |title=Extinction! |last=MacLeod |first=Norman |date=January 6, 2001 |website=FirstScience.com |accessdate=2015-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The oceans may have become more hospitable to life over the last 500&amp;nbsp;Ma and less vulnerable to mass extinctions: dissolved oxygen became more widespread and penetrated to greater depths; the development of life on land reduced the run-off of nutrients and hence the risk of [[eutrophication]] and anoxic events; and marine ecosystems became more diversified so that food chains were less likely to be disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=Ronald E. |date=June 1995 |title=Cyclic and secular variation in microfossil biomineralization: clues to the biogeochemical evolution of Phanerozoic oceans |journal=[[Global and Planetary Change]] |volume=11 |issue=1–2 |pages=1–23 |doi=10.1016/0921-8181(94)00011-2 |bibcode=1995GPC....11....1M |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=Ronald E. |date=June 1996 |title=Secular Increase in Nutrient Levels through the Phanerozoic: Implications for Productivity, Biomass, and Diversity of the Marine Biosphere |journal=PALAIOS |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=209–219 |doi=10.2307/3515230 |jstor=3515230 |ref=harv|bibcode=1996Palai..11..209M }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reasonably complete fossils are very rare, most extinct organisms are represented only by partial fossils, and complete fossils are rarest in the oldest rocks. So paleontologists have mistakenly assigned parts of the same organism to different genera, which were often defined solely to accommodate these finds—the story of ''[[Anomalocaris]]'' is an example of this. The risk of this mistake is higher for older fossils because these are often both unlike parts of any living organism and poorly conserved. Many of the "superfluous" genera are represented by fragments which are not found again and the "superfluous" genera appear to become extinct very quickly.&lt;ref name="MacLeod2001Extinction" /&gt;

[[Biodiversity]] in the fossil record, which is "...the number of distinct genera alive at any given time; that is, those whose first occurrence predates and whose last occurrence postdates that time"&lt;ref name="RohdeMuller2005" /&gt; shows a different trend: a fairly swift rise from {{ma|542|400|Ma}}; a slight decline from {{ma|400|200|Ma}}, in which the devastating Permian–Triassic extinction event is an important factor; and a swift rise from {{ma|200|Ma}} to the present.&lt;ref name="RohdeMuller2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rohde |first1=Robert A. |authorlink1=Robert Rohde |last2=Muller |first2=Richard A. |authorlink2=Richard A.

'''''Haute couture''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|oʊ|t|_|k|uː|ˈ|tj|ʊər}}; {{IPA-fr|ot kutyʁ}}; [[French language|French]] for "high sewing" or "high dressmaking" or "high fashion") is the creation of exclusive custom-fitted [[clothing]]. ''Haute couture'' is [[high-end]] [[fashion]] that is constructed by hand from start to finish, made from high-quality, expensive, often unusual fabric and sewn with extreme attention to detail and finished by the most experienced and capable sewers - often using time-consuming, hand-executed techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessoffashion.com/education/fashion-az/haute-couture|title=Haute Couture {{!}} Fashion A-Z {{!}} BoF Education {{!}} The Business of Fashion {{!}} #BoFEducation|website=The Business of Fashion|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedapifer.com/what-is-couture-mean-fashion/|title=What Does Couture Mean- Definition and French Translation – The Dapifer|date=2017-02-04|work=THE DAPIFER|access-date=2017-06-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Couture'' translates literally from French as "dressmaking" but may also refer to fashion, sewing, or needlework&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theoddportrait.com/what-is-haute-couture/|title=What is Haute Couture made easy – The Odd Portrait|date=29 November 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also used as a common abbreviation of ''haute couture'' and refers to the same thing in spirit.&lt;ref name="hcn2011_what"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hautecouturenews.com/what-is-haute-couture|title=What is Haute Couture?|accessdate=2011-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Haute'' translates literally to "high". A haute couture garment is always made for an individual client, tailored specifically for the wearer's measurements and body stance. Considering the amount of time, money, and skill allotted to each completed piece, haute couture garments are also described as having no price tag: budget is not relevant.

The term originally referred to Englishman [[Charles Frederick Worth]]'s work, produced in Paris in the mid-nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=TFE/&gt; ''[[The Dapifer]]'' notes that Worth would allow his clients to select colors, fabrics and other details before ever beginning his design process which was unheard of at the time.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; In modern France, haute couture is a protected name that may not be used except by firms that meet certain well-defined standards. However, the term is also used loosely to describe all high-fashion custom-fitted clothing whether it is produced in [[Paris]] or in other [[fashion capital]]s such as [[London]], [[Milan]], [[New York City]] or [[Tokyo]]. In either case, the term can refer to the fashion houses or [[fashion design]]ers that create exclusive and often trend-setting [[fashion]]s or to the fashions created.

== French legal status of term ==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2015}}
In [[France]], the term ''haute couture'' is protected by law and is defined by the ''[[Paris Chamber of Commerce|Chambre de commerce et d'industrie de Paris]]'' based in [[Paris]]. The ''chambre syndicale de la haute couture'' is defined as "the regulating commission that determines which fashion houses are eligible to be true haute couture houses". Their rules state that only "those companies mentioned on the list drawn up each year by a commission domiciled at the Ministry for Industry are entitled to avail themselves" of the label ''haute couture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pauline Thomas |url=http://fashion-era.com/chambre_syndicale.htm |title=Chambre Syndicale History and Development – Fashion History |publisher=Fashion-era.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne is an association of Parisian couturiers founded in 1868 as an outgrowth of medieval guilds that regulate its members in regard to counterfeiting of styles, dates of openings for collections, number of models presented, relations with press, questions of law and taxes, and promotional activities. Formation of the organization was brought about by [[Charles Frederick Worth]]. An affiliated school was organized in 1930 called L'Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture. The school helps bring new designers to help the "couture" houses that are still present today. Since 1975, this organization has worked within the [[Fédération française de la couture|Federation Francaise, de couture, du Prêt-à-Porter des Couturiers et des Createurs de Mode]].&lt;ref&gt;Calasibetta, C., Tortora, P., &amp; Abling, B. (2002). The fairchild dictionary of fashion. (3rd ed.). New York, NY: Fairchild Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

More rigorous criteria for ''haute couture'' were established in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomsburyfashioncentral.com/products/berg-fashion-library/encyclopedia/the-berg-companion-to-fashion/haute-couture|title=Bloomsbury Fashion Central -|website=www.bloomsburyfashioncentral.com|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; To earn the right to call itself a couture house and to use the term ''haute couture'' in its advertising and any other way, members of the [[Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture]] must follow specific rules:{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}
* design made-to-order for private clients, with one or more fittings;
* have a workshop (''atelier'') in [[Paris]] that employs at least fifteen staff members full-time;
* have at least twenty full-time technical people, in at least one workshop (''atelier''); and 
* present a collection of at least fifty original designs to the public every fashion season (twice, in January and July of each year), of both day and evening garments.

== Other uses of the term ==
The term "haute couture" has taken on further popular meanings referring to non-dressmaking activities, such as production of fine art, music, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fashion-blog.us/2008/08/11/wuyong-dancing-in-a-haute-couture-debut/ |title=Wuyong – Dancing In A Haute Couture Debut &amp;#124; The Fashion Blog |publisher=Fashion-blog.us |date= |accessdate=2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haute couture can be referenced back as early as the 17th Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/berg-companion-to-fashion/oclc/718467384&amp;referer=brief_results|title=The Berg companion to fashion|last=Steele|first=Valerie|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Berg|isbn=9781847885630|location=Oxford [etc.]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rose Bertin]], the French fashion designer to Queen Marie Antoinette, can be credited for bringing fashion and haute couture to French culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nudelman, Z|date=2009|title=The art of couture sewing|page=2|location=London|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=1563675390|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1563675390|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors to Paris brought back clothing that was then copied by local dressmakers. Stylish women also ordered dresses in the latest Parisian fashion to serve as models.

As railroads and steamships made European travel easier, it was increasingly common for wealthy women to travel to Paris to shop for clothing and accessories. French fitters and [[dressmaker]]s were commonly thought to be the best in Europe, and real Parisian garments were considered better than local imitations.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

A {{Lang|fr|'''couturier'''}} ({{IPA-fr|ku.ty.ʁje|lang}}) is an establishment or person involved in the clothing fashion industry who makes original garments to order for private clients. A couturier may make what is known as haute couture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/couturier|title=Merriam-Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a person usually hires patternmakers and machinists for garment production, and is either employed by exclusive boutiques or is self-employed.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The ''couturier'' [[Charles Frederick Worth]] (October 13, 1825 – March 10, 1895), is widely considered the father of ''haute couture'' as it is known today.&lt;ref name=TFE&gt;Claire B. Shaeffer (2001).

Taunton Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline C. Kent (2003). [https://books.google.com/books?id=5EgJ9BwO5Q0C&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=charles+frederick+worth+haute+couture&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mxbnS83pFJGB_QaU56WdCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=charles%20frederick%20worth%20haute%20couture&amp;f=false Business Builders in Fashion – Charles Frederick Worth – The Father of Haute Couture] The Oliver Press, Inc., 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Although born in [[Bourne, Lincolnshire]], England, Worth made his mark in the French fashion industry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Revolutionizing how dressmaking had been previously perceived, Worth made it so the dressmaker became the artist of garnishment: a fashion designer. While he created one-of-a-kind designs to please some of his titled or wealthy customers, he is best known for preparing a portfolio of designs that were shown on live models at the House of Worth. Clients selected one model, specified colors and fabrics, and had a duplicate garment tailor-made in Worth's workshop. Worth combined individual tailoring with a standardization more characteristic of the ready-to-wear [[clothing industry]], which was also developing during this period.

Following in Worth's footsteps were [[Callot Soeurs]], [[Patou]], [[Paul Poiret|Poiret]], [[Madeleine Vionnet|Vionnet]], [[Mariano Fortuny (designer)|Fortuny]], [[Jeanne Lanvin|Lanvin]], [[Chanel]], [[Mainbocher]], [[Elsa Schiaparelli|Schiaparelli]], [[Balenciaga]], and [[Christian Dior|Dior]]. Some of these fashion houses still exist today, under the leadership of modern designers.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In the 1960s, a group of young designers who had trained under men like Dior and Balenciaga left these established ''couture'' houses and opened their own establishments. The most successful of these young designers were [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]], [[Pierre Cardin]], [[André Courrèges]], [[Ted Lapidus]], and [[Emanuel Ungaro]]. Japanese native and Paris-based [[Hanae Mori]] was also successful in establishing her own line.

[[Christian Lacroix|Lacroix]] is one of the fashion houses to have been started in the late 20th century. Other new houses have included [[Jean-Paul Gaultier]] and [[Thierry Mugler]]. Due to the high expenses of producing haute couture collections, Lacroix and Mugler have since ceased their haute couture activities.&lt;ref name="End of a fairytale: Christian Lacroix fashion house to strip down"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/dec/01/christian-lacroix-fashion-house-closure End of a fairytale: Christian Lacroix fashion house to strip down]- The Guardian. Retrieved 21 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Modernized haute couture shows are not designed and made to be sold, rather they are exactly what they are displayed for – for show. Instead of being constructed for the purpose of selling and making money, they are made to further the publicity, as well as perception and understanding of brand image.

For all these fashion houses, custom clothing is no longer the main source of income, often costing much more than it earns through direct sales; it only adds the aura of fashion to their ventures in [[ready-to-wear]] clothing and related [[luxury product]]s such as [[shoe]]s and [[perfume]]s, and [[licensing]] ventures that earn greater returns for the company. Excessive commercialization and profit-making can be damaging, however. Cardin, for example, licensed with abandon in the 1980s and his name lost most of its fashionable cachet when anyone could buy Cardin luggage at a discount store. It is their ready-to-wear collections that are available to a wider audience, adding a splash of glamour and the feel of haute couture to more wardrobes.&lt;ref name="Luxury"&gt;{{cite book | title=Luxury Brand Management | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | author=Chevalier, Michel | year=2012 | location=Singapore | isbn=978-1-118-17176-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fashion houses still create custom clothing for publicity, for example providing items to the television show ''[[Gossip Girl]]''.&lt;ref name="meltzer20130919"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/19/fashion/costume-designers-for-tv-have-a-big-impact-on-fashion.html |title=Get Me Wardrobe! |last=Meltzer |first=Marisa |date=2013-09-19 |newspaper=The New York Times |page=E1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960s also featured a revolt against established fashion standards by [[Mod (subculture)|mod]]s, rockers, and [[hippies]], as well as an increasing internationalization of the fashion scene. Jet travel had spawned a [[jet set]] that partied—and shopped—just as happily in New York as in Paris. Rich women no longer felt that a Paris dress was necessarily better than one sewn elsewhere. While Paris is still pre-eminent in the fashion world, it is no longer the sole arbiter of fashion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12678">The '''Hollow Sword Blades Company''' was a British [[joint-stock company]] founded in 1691 by a goldsmith, Sir [[Stephen Evance]], for the manufacture of [[Grind|hollow-ground]] rapiers. 

The company ceased manufacturing swords in 1702 following the suicide of its founder{{Dubious|Dubious|reason=Sir Stephan was Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company until his death in 1712, so 1702 couldn't be following his suicide. Either they stopped manufacturing swords before he was dead or they manufactured swords until 1712 when the founder died|date=June 2017}} and was purchased by a syndicate of businessmen who used the corporate identity of the company to operate as a bank. At this time the [[Bank of England]] held a monopoly by act of parliament as the only organisation permitted to operate as a bank in England, so anyone wishing to carry out banking operations had to do so by devious means. The company was used as a stepping stone to the foundation of the [[South Sea Company]] which set out to supplant the Bank of England as banker to the government.
==Founder==
Sir Stephen Evance was a goldsmith whose father had been born in [[New England]], but who had set up a business in Lombard Street in London. Evance did not confine his interests simply to metalwork, but had attempted salvage work with a diving machine,  lead mining, mineral prospecting in Canada, a fishing enterprise off the coast of Ireland in partnership with Sir James Houblon (one of the founders of the Bank of England) and a draper named Samuel Ongley.&lt;ref&gt;carswell p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir Stephen Evance was Governor of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] during 1692-1696 and 1700-1712. He first acquired stock in the Hudson's Bay Company in February 1684, and he was a good friend of the company who would arrange money and other favours for the company. For this, Evance received a gratuity from the Deputy Governor of 50 "[[Guinea_(coin)|Gunneys]][sic]" to buy a couple of horses to pull his coach. Sir Stephen never married or had any children of his own, but he did have a niece either named Hester Child who inherited Sir Stephen's estate, which was significant even after his debts were paid. Despite this, before his death, Sir Stephen had large debts and his suicide by pistol is reputed to be a result of Sir Stephen believing that his situation, at the time of his death, indicated a terminal failure in life. &lt;ref name="HBC"&gt;https://www.gov.mb.ca/chc/archives/hbca/biographical/e/evance_sir_stephen.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;HBCAA.40/1,fo.27;A/1/13,fo.21; Pedigrees of the Knights made by Charles 11, ARCHIVES WINNIPEG James 11, William 111 and Queen Anne, George W. Marshall (ed.), Harleian Society, Volume V111, London, 1873. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Company origins==
In 1691, [[Nine_Years'_War|war between France and England]] interrupted the importation of hollow ground swords from France which had become popular weapons in England and a business opportunity presented to manufacture the swords in England. Evance arranged for  [[Huguenot]] metalworkers to move to Britain to manufacture the swords and obtained a charter of corporation as the 'Governor and Company for Making Hollow Sword Blades in England', granted 13 October 1691.&lt;ref&gt;Patent rolls, 3 William and Mary, pt Vii&lt;/ref&gt;
The company obtained premises  at Shotley Bridge in Durham. Granting of the charter plus two patents was on condition the applicants loaned the government £50,000, which sum was provided by Evance and Sir Francis Child in August 1692. Evance was appointed the first governor of the company, Peter Reneu the deputy governor, assistants Francis Tissen, Matthew Evans, John Carter, John Holland, Abraham Dashwood, John Samford, Robert Peter, Thomas Evans, Peter Justice, John Reneu, William Reneu, John Baker. The corporation had power to purchase land and issue stock to unlimited value.

The company manufactured swords and by virtue of the charter had power to seize imported foreign hollow swords. Evance became an excise commissioner and succeeded Childs as jeweller to King [[William III of England|William III]]. However, after the king's death in 1702 the business failed and Evance committed suicide. One of the  swordsmiths employed by the company, Herman Mohll continued to manufacture swords at Shotley in his own right under the name Herman Mohll and son, founding a company which continued with a change of name to Mole in 1832. The company was purchased by [[Wilkinson Sword]] in 1922.

==Banking operations==
The Hollow Sword Blade Company was sold and moved to Birchin Lane in London, to the premises of its new company secretary, [[Blunt baronets|John Blunt]], a scrivener (lawyer specialising in business and financial contracts). The sale was probably arranged by Francis Child, whose son was a banker and business associate of Blunt.&lt;ref&gt;Carswell p.31&lt;/ref&gt; The new Governor was Elias Turner, a goldsmith with a shop in Lombard street under the sign of the Fleece, who provided both finance and experience. The deputy Governor was Jacob Sawbridge, who came from a business family and who had a small estate in Canterbury. The fourth partner, [[George Caswall]], came from Leominster which his family had represented as MP for generations. His father had been Mayor, and Receiver of the land tax for Monmouthshire. Caswall was a partner with another goldsmith, Brassey, specialising in finance and trading securities. [[Daniel Defoe]] described them: "Sawbridge is as cunning as Caswall is bold, and the reserve of the one with the openness of the other makes a complete Exchange Alley man. Turner ... acts in concert..and makes together a complete triumvirate of thieving". (Exchange Alley was the place where stock trading and other financial transactions took place in London.) The objective of the partnership was to break into the business monopolised by the Bank of England, which was handling and providing loans for the government.

In 1703 the company purchased some of the Irish estates forfeited under the Williamite settlement in counties Mayo, Sligo, Galway, and Roscommon. They also bought the forfeited estates of the [[Earl of Clancarty]] (McCarthy) in counties Cork and Kerry and of Sir Patrick Trant in counties Kerry, Limerick, Kildare, Dublin, King and Queen's counties (Offaly and Laois). Further lands in counties Limerick, Tipperary, Cork and other counties, formerly the estate of James II were also purchased, also part of the estate of Lord Cahir in county Tipperary. In June 1703 the company bought a large estate in county Cork, confiscated from a number of attainted persons and other lands in counties Waterford and Clare. However within about 10 years the company had sold most of its Irish estates. Francis Edwards, a London merchant, was one of the main purchasers.
&lt;ref&gt;http://landedestates.nuigalway.ie/LandedEstates/jsp/family-show.jsp?id=2882&lt;/ref&gt;

The recent conquest of Ireland by England had resulted in the confiscation of land from Jacobites which had been given to members of the army.  Blunt was amongst others who campaigned that the property should instead have been sold to defer government expenses, and an act of parliament was passed cancelling the grants of land which instead were to be sold. The Sword Blade company now used its charter powers to own property to purchase land to the value of £200,000 with anticipated revenues of £20,000 per year, or 10%. To pay for this, the company used a trick which the Bank of England had employed in its own creation. The Hollow Sword Blades Company issued shares, which it was also entitled to do under its charter. It offered to exchange its own shares at a nominal value of £100 for £100 of government debt issued by the army paymaster. The government was willing to accept its own debt as payment for the land, so no cash money was required for the transactions. The army debt could at that time only be sold on the open market at a rate of £85 per £100 of face value, so this offered a way for holders to realise a better price.  The land remained the property of the company, and the company would pay dividends on the shares from its rental income.

The deal was negotiated with the treasury by Blunt and their legal advisor, Lake and agreed on 1 June 1704. Once the debt was cancelled, the government no longer had to pay interest upon it, which it had been doing at 7.5%. However, it also required a 'sweetener' in the form of receiving a new loan of £20,000 at 5% as part of the deal, secured against Royal shares in Cornish tin. 

Before announcing the offer, the Sword Blade Syndicate made full advantage of the anticipated rise in value of army debt, by buying as much as it could privately beforehand. This was then sold as the price rose once the general market realised there was an offer available to trade in the debt at its full value.&lt;ref&gt;Carswell p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sword Blade company also branched out into providing mortgages for other would be purchasers of Irish land, accepting cash deposits and issuing its own notes. This came to the attention of the Bank of England, who advised the treasury that their own monopoly to act as a bank was being infringed. The treasury took no action. In part, the government recognised that it had a good deal it did not wish to spoil. There was also a legal complication, that the Bank act protected it against any other company being set up by act of parliament to operate as a bank. In the case of the sword company charter, although the steps to enact its charter had been commenced, they had never actually been completed in parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Carswell  p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bank of England charter was due to expire in 1710, and they were concerned to arrange its renewal. Others, however, continued to lobby parliament not to do so, and a new syndicate had formed, offering to take on funding of the latest loan required by government. The Bank responded by dropping its interest rate to underbid the competition, and succeeded in renewing its charter until 1732, with more strictly drawn terms to prevent others operating as banks.

Further complications faced the Sword Blade company, as title to land in Ireland began to be disputed by relatives of dispossessed Jacobites and others claiming to have bought from the initial beneficiaries of the first cancelled land distribution. The matter was settled by an act of parliament in 1708 setting a time limit on further claims, but  by then the company stock had fallen to £55 per nominal £100 issued. As some consolation, pressure was also mounting on the Bank of England from an increasingly distressed government seeking new ways to raise money.&lt;ref&gt;Carswell p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SNGCop 491.jpg|290px|thumb|right|Coins of King [[Monunius I of Dardania|Monunius]] - 280&amp;nbsp;BC.]]
'''Illyrian coinage''' which began in the 6th century BC continued up to the 1st century of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] rule. It was the southern [[Illyrians]] who minted the first coins followed by the northern Illyrian during the Roman era. Illyrian coins have also been found in other areas apart from [[Illyria]], such ancient [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonia]], Italy, Greece, [[Asia Minor]] and Egypt.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Early coins==

The earliest Illyrian coins were probably minted by the Tyntenoi north of [[Lake Ohrid]] minted coins around 540&amp;nbsp;BC with the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] legend [[Tynteni]]. Their silver coins reached Italy, [[Egypt]] and many parts of [[Asia]]. They belonged to the group of '[[Thraco-Macedonian]]' coinages of this period, and they bore the same emblems as the coins of [[Ichnae]] at the head of the [[Thermaic Gulf]]. Production ceased in the early 5th century BC, most likely in 475&amp;nbsp;BC when this period was one of comparative poverty, during which contacts were lost with mainland Greece and relations with Ionia via the [[Danube]] valley slackened.&lt;ref&gt;A History of Macedonia: 550–336 BC by Nicholas Geoffrey Lemprière Hammond, Guy Thompson Griffith, page 93 ^ The Cambridge ancient history: The fourth century BC by D. M. Lewis, John Boardman,1994, page 427, "The silver coinage of the Tynteni ceased early in the fifth century. The period after 475 was one of comparative poverty, during which contacts were lost"&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Messapians]] in southern [[Italy]] minted coins in the early 5th century BC. They were an early imitation of the Greek coins from [[Magna Grecia]]. The cities which minted these early mints were Valesio, [[Brindisi]], [[Nardò]], [[Oria, Apulia|Oria]], Ugento, Grax and Samadi. Valesio struck silver coins, Nardò silver and bronze while from the 3rd century BC only bronze coins were issued. The coins feature Lapagus, an ancient [[Iapygian]] hero. Other features included [[Athena]], [[Heracles]] and [[Zeus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:it:Messapi]]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time as the Messapians, the [[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paeonian]] tribe of the [[Derrones]] were also producing coins. These coins are traditionally dated to 500&amp;nbsp;BC – 450&amp;nbsp;BC. Frequent depictions on the coins attributed to the Derrones are Oxen and Corinthian helmets. Their god, Darr(h)on, was worshipped by Paionians and Macedonians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Derivation of the Greek Word Paean |author=Grace H. Macurdy |journal=Language|volume=6 |issue=4 |date=December 1930|pages=297–303 |jstor=409430 |doi=10.2307/409430}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wildwinds"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildwinds.com/coins/greece/thraco_macedonian_tribes/derrones/t.html|publisher=wildwinds.com|title=Thraco Macedonian Tribes, Derrones, ancient coins index with thumbnails - WildWinds.com|accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paeonian kings dealt greatly and seriously with the minting coins. However this activity in terms of quality and appearance did not differ much from Greek coins. Even the Paeonians themselves at this time were becoming hellenized more and more and lost to a great degree their characteristic as a non-Greek people.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stipčević|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest Illyrian coins in Illyria were minted from the start of the 4th century BC in the [[List of ancient cities in Illyria|Illyrian city]] of [[Damastion]] and Daparria&lt;ref name="wildwinds2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildwinds.com/coins/greece/illyria/damastion/i.html|publisher=wildwinds.com|title=Illyria, Damastion - Ancient Greek Coins - WildWinds.com|accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[List of ancient tribes in Illyria|Illyrian tribe]] of the [[Dyestes]] under [[Bardylis]], which had been influenced by [[Hellenization]] to an extent. For about 200 years, this city minted silver coins with symbols imitating those of the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] cities in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], as well as original symbols such as tongs of a metal smelter. The circulation of Damastion coins included [[Kosovo]], southern [[Serbia]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and the [[Adriatic]] coast from [[Shkodër]] to [[Split, Croatia|Split]]. The presence of silver mines around the city in ancient sources made it possible for the minting of coins in such a great abundance.

==Illyrian kings==
[[File:NBHM-Rezhantsi-Treasure-Silver-tetradrachms-of-Patraus.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Silver [[tetradrachm]]s dated back to the reign of Patraus.]]
The only kings to have minted coins bearing their names were [[Lycceius]], [[Patraus]], [[Audoleon]], [[Monunius I of Dardania|Monunius]], [[Mytilus of Illyria|Mytilus]], [[Gentius]] and [[Ballaios]].

===Patraus===
The coinage of Patraus is remarkable. They have on the obverse a head of [[Apollo]], which may be in allusion to the king's name, Apollo being known under the name of Patraus. On the reverse of the coins is a horseman riding over an enemy, in allusion to triumphs over the Macedonians and an inscription of the king.&lt;ref&gt;The Coin collector's manual, or Guide to the numismatic student in the ... By Henry Noel Humphreys page92&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audoleon===
The coins of Audoleon have a head wearing a Corinthian helmet on the obverse and on the reverse a horse stepping, very boldly executed and the inscription of the king.

===Monunius===
[[File:Silver stater, Apollonia, 340-280 BC.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]]'s coin. A cow and a suckling calf. Reverse: double stellate pattern within dual linear border and the inscription A Π O Λ around.]] 
The first [[Dardani]]an king to have minted silver coins was [[Monunius I of Dardania|Monunius]] in the beginning of the 3rd century BC, around 280&amp;nbsp;BC. He struck his coins in the Greek colony of [[Durrës]] and they differed only in having the jaw of a boar set over the cow, as a symbol of the royal Illyrian house. The coins also had the abbreviated inscription 'ΔYP' (for Durrës) to donate the place where they were minted, as well as showing royal sovereignty over the city. These coins have been found in great numbers in the Illyrian city of [[Gurazez|Gurëzeza]], and in the interior of [[Albania]] beyond [[Apollonia, Illyria|Apollonia]]. The Illyrian kingdom under Monunius extended as far as the [[Lyncestian]] Lakes, and from here Monunius could have intervened in the quarrel about the Macedonian throne, eventually turning into a claimant for it. This surely is the meaning of the minting of a second series of silver coins bearing his name and traditional Macedonian symbols, the head of [[Heracles]] on the face and on the reverse, Olympian [[Zeus]] sitting on his throne. That this, was a short lived dream of the Illyrian king is shown by the fact that so few coins were minted, so much that only one specimen is preserved today.&lt;ref&gt;The Illyrians to the Albanians by [[Neritan Ceka]] 2005, p.114 {{ISBN|99943-672-2-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mytilus===
[[Mytilus of Illyria|Mytilus]], the successor of King Monunius, struck his coins 10 years later around 270&amp;nbsp;BC. His bronze coinage with the symbols of the city of [[Durrës]] in Albania bear his name. The coinage of Apollonia in the same period bore only his monogram, as well as symbols similar to those of the [[Aetolian League]].&lt;ref&gt;The Illyrians to the Albanians by [[Neritan Ceka]] 2005, {{ISBN|99943-672-2-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gentius===
[[File:Face of King Gentius on Ancient Illyrian coin.jpg|thumb|upright|King [[Gentius]] on a bronze coin.]]
The most productive conage is of [[Gentius]] who ruled from 181&amp;nbsp;BC. Two of his mints were located in [[Shkodra]], the ancient Illyrian capital at the time of his regn, and in [[Lezha]], both located in modern-day north-eastern Albania. His coins were also struck in [[Durrës]], where the royal title is absent from any silver coin, and the name Gentius, not uncommon to an Illyrian male, may belong not to the king but to a local magistrate. However, around 30 to 40 examples of bronze coins have been recorded with the legend 'King Genthios'. Upon his defeat by the Romans in 168&amp;nbsp;BC his treasury of 120,000 silver pieces were conveyed to [[Rome]].

===Ballaios===
[[File:Balajos.jpg|thumb|upright| King [[Ballaios]] on a bronze coin.]]
[[Ballaios]] reigned after the kingdom of Gentius was dissolved into the Roman Empire from around 167&amp;nbsp;BC – 135&amp;nbsp;BC. The abundance of the coinage of Ballaios in the region would suggest that he was a powerful and influential king although no literary of historical evidence of him exists. The coins of the well-known king Gentius are scarce in comparison to the coins of Ballaios. His silver issues are rare, but bronze coins (without the royal title) occur on [[Hvar]] in [[Croatia]], both in single finds and in hoards, and at [[Rhizon]], the ancient capital of Queen [[Teuta]], in a different series bearing the royal title. The coins of Ballaios were widely imitated in the region, sometimes so crudely that they are unintelligible. Ballaios struck coins in two cities: [[Hvar|Pharos]] and Rhizon. The weight of the bronze coins are between 1.0 and 4.5&amp;nbsp;g, while most of the documented specimens weigh between 2.0 and 2.5&amp;nbsp;g. The relativity great impact of the coinage of Ballaios is indicated by a large number of imitations of his coins. His coins are found in both the eastern Adriatic shores and frequently in Italy, which confirms the trade contacts between the two Adriatic coasts.&lt;ref name="books.google.ie"&gt;{{cite book|title=Épire, Illyrie, Macédoine: mélanges offerts au professeur Pierre Cabanes|author1=Cabanes, P.|author2=Berranger, D.|author3=Centre de recherches sur les civilisations antiques|date=2007|publisher=Presses universitaires Blaise Pascal|isbn=9782845163515|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=I_kFU6h77ssC&amp;pg=PA129|page=129|accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Illyria: An Archaeological Exploration|author1=Evans, A.|author2=Destani, B.D.|date=2006|publisher=I.

On the obverse of his coins a bust of the king facing left to right is depicted, while on the reverse [[Artemis]] (advancing or standing) is represented, with or without a torch and sometimes carrying one or two spears. It is significant that Ballaios also had [[silver]] coins minted, which indicates his wealth and power, since elsewhere in [[Dalmatia]], silver coinage is very rarely documented from the Greek and Illyrian mints.&lt;ref name="books.google.ie"/&gt;

==City coins==

[[File:Monedha Labeate.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shkodër|Shkodra]]'s coin with the inscription: 'SKOΔRI-NΩN'.]]
The coins of ancient Lissus, modern-day [[Lezha]], with the legend 'LISSITAN' began with autonomous issues under the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] influences (211&amp;nbsp;BC – 197&amp;nbsp;BC). The coins were followed later by the issues of Gentius with a ship on the reverse and a third series from the period after the kings removal. Lissus minted coins on behalf of the community of the Lissians and minted a rare coin with an inscription over the head of an Illyrian god wearing a causia type hat. The face depicted on the Lissian coins was originally though to be of King [[Gentius]], although Albanian archaeologist, [[Hasan Ceka]] was proved it to by the head of the Illyrian sea god, [[Rodon (Illyrian god)|Rodon]]. The head of [[Artemis]] and an Illyrian shield is depicted on some Lissian coins. The Shkodra coins fall into three similar groups, the first and third with the legend 'SKODRI-NON' and the second with the legend of king Gentius. In the city of Rhizon a mint was established that issued several coinages. These incleded autonomous coinages of the town, in bronze, the royal coinage of king Ballaios, in silver and bronze, most probably, the coinage labeled “Coinage from the [[Bay of Kotor|Rhizonian Gulf]]”, which has been considered as the coinage of an alliance in which [[Rhizon]] played a part, in silver and bronze.

[[File:Daorson Coin.jpg|thumb|[[Daorson]] coin with a galley on the reverse.]]
The chronology of these coinages is still not defined with precision, primarily because the historical background of their issuance remains little known. There is hardly any mention in the literary sources of the town of Rhizon, and none of the king Ballaios. However, several features of these coinages - such as the characteristics of style, elements of inscription and iconography (especially the presence of the title “basileus” on the coinage of Ballaios, and the presence of a Macedonian shield on the “Coinage from the Rhizonian Gulf”), metrology, choice of coined metals, etc. – point to the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE as the general chronological framework for the activity of the Rhizonian mint and for the successive issuance of the coinages of different issuing authorities there. Around [[Lake Scutari]] the [[Labeates]] issued a rare type of bronze coin, bearing the head of an Illyrian deity and a [[Liburnian warship]] with a dolphin swimming underneath. Between 217&amp;nbsp;BC and 84&amp;nbsp;BC the city of [[Oria, Apulia|Oria]] in Italy minted coins with the head of Lapagus, the ancient Iapygian hero. In [[Daorson]] the capital of the Daorsi in modern [[Bosnia]], 39 different coins (29 bearing the image of King [[Ballaios]] from 168&amp;nbsp;BC, and 9 with a Greek inscription and a boat image) have been discovered.&lt;ref name="coe" &gt;http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/cultureheritage/regional/see/IRPPSAAH/PTA%20Ljubljana/BH_22-PTA-APPROVED_web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Money was of immense importance to the Daorsi, ensuring the tribe's independence while also confirming their well developed business, cultural and trade links with other peoples.&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illyrians|author=Wilkes, J.|date=1996|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9780631198079|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4Nv6SPRKqs8C&amp;pg=PA177|page=177|accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Illyrian coins also appeare in other ancient cities especially those in the south of Illyria, such as in the Illyrian/Greek cities of [[Byllis]], [[Amantia]], [[Pelion (Chaonia)|Pelion]] and [[Olympe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkes|first=John J.|title=The Illyrians|location=Oxford|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=1995|isbn=0-631-19807-5|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The koinon of the [[Bylliones]] centred on the city of [[Byllis]] minted its own bronze coins. The first coins came out around 270&amp;nbsp;BC and continued until 167&amp;nbsp;BC when the Romans dissolved the koinon.&lt;ref name="albca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albca.com/aclis/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=print&amp;sid=1434|publisher=albca.com|title=www.albca.com/aclis/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=print&amp;sid=1434|accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ein fraw was pabst.jpg|thumb|Legend of Pope Joan in the Chronicle of Jans [der] Enikel, Passau, circa 1420]]

'''Jans der Enikel''', i.e. "Jans the Grandson" was a [[Vienna|Viennese]] [[poet]] and [[historian]] of the late 13th century.  He wrote a ''Weltchronik'' ([[universal chronicle|history of the world]]) and a ''Fürstenbuch'' ([[history of Vienna]]), both in [[Middle High German]] verse.

==History Of The World==
The ''Weltchronik'' tells the history of the world, starting even before the six-day creation by telling of [[Satan]]'s rebellion in [[Heaven]], and relating the [[Biblical]] stories of the [[Old Testament]] (oddly not the [[New Testament|New]]), then continuing with [[Homer]] and other classical Greek and Roman material, and on down the list of Emperors through [[Charles the Great]] to [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]].

The style is anecdotal, with many fun tales inserted into what might otherwise be sober history. For example, the reign of Frederick II is interrupted to tell an entirely fictional story of a nobleman named Friedrich von Antfurt. This Friedrich subjects a [[duchess]] to what we today could only call sexual harassment, to the point where she thinks up a ruse to get rid of him. She promises to give him what he wants (the poet makes no bones about the fact that he only wants her body) provided he takes part in a [[jousting|joust]] wearing her [[chemise]] (underdress) instead of his armour.  She is of course counting on him being killed. But he survives, and there has to be a reckoning.

Jans is recorded in a number of Viennese documents for the years 1271-1302. He is known to have been a member of one of the highest patrician families of the city.

==Notes==
*The name is "Jans", and "Enikel" is an appellative; thus he is listed alphabetically under "J" - never "Enikel, Jans der".

'''John F. Richards''' (November 3, 1938 - August 23, 2007) was a historian of [[South Asia]] and in particular of the [[Mughal Empire]]. He was Professor of History at [[Duke University]], [[North Carolina]], and a recipient in 2007 of the Distinguished Contributions to Asian Studies Award. He participated in and encouraged a multi-disciplinary, multi-regional approach to studies.&lt;ref name="gilmartin" /&gt;

== Life ==
John Richards was born on November 3, 1938 in [[Exeter, New Hampshire]]. His parents, Frank F. Richards and Ella Higgins Richards, subsequently had two more children.&lt;ref name="herald"&gt;{{cite web |title=History Professor John Richards Dies at Age 68 |date=August 30, 2007 |publisher=Durham Herald-Sun |via=DukeToday |url=https://today.duke.edu/2007/08/richards.html |accessdate=2015-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richards graduated from the [[University of New Hampshire]] as [[valedictorian]] in 1961 and on the same day he married his high school sweetheart, Ann Berry. The couple moved to California and, in 1968, to [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] when he received an appointment at the [[University of Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt; He was awarded a PhD in History by the [[University of California at Berkeley]] in 1970. His thesis, later published at ''Mughal Administration in Golconda'' (1975), was written under the direction of [[Thomas R. Metcalf]]. This established him as "one of the leading historians of the Mughal Empire in the United States", according to [[David Gilmartin]], and he went on to write a volume of ''[[The New Cambridge History of India]]'' titled ''The Mughal Empire (1993).&lt;ref name="gilmartin"&gt;{{cite web |title=About John F.

Other works by Richards on the Mughal period include ''The Imperial Monetary System of Mughal India'' (1987) and ''Kingship and Authority in South Asia'' (1998). The impact of the Mughal empire on world events caused him to consider the Mughals to be an "early modern" empire, rather than the medieval one that most commentators believed it to be. It was this belief that led him into studies of world trade and state finances, as well as early modern world environmental history. In 2003, he published ''The Unending Frontier: Environmental History of the Early Modern World'' (2003).&lt;ref name="gilmartin" /&gt;

Richards had worked at Duke University since 1977.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt; He was heavily involved with administration of the [[Council of American Overseas Research Centers]] and in reforming the troubled [[American Institute of Pakistan Studies]]. He was also in the vanguard of establishing the [[American Institute of Afghanistan Studies]], the first meeting of which took place at Duke University in 2003&lt;ref name="gilmartin" /&gt; and of which he was the founding president.&lt;ref name="aha" /&gt;

Richards died of cancer at home in [[Durham, North Carolina]], on August 23, 2007, days before he was due to retire. He had two children.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;

A ''[[festschrift]]'' titled ''Expanding Frontiers in South Asian and World History: Essays in Honour of John F. Richards'' was published in 2013, edited by [[Richard M. Eaton]], [[Munis D. Faruqui]], Gilmartin and [[Sunil Kumar]].

In 2011, the [[American Historical Association]] inaugurated a prize named in his honor. This is awarded for the best book on South Asian history published during each year.&lt;ref name="aha"&gt;{{cite web |title=John F.

The '''Killycluggin Stone''' is a decorated stone, which has been interpreted by some as the cult image of [[Crom Cruach]]. It was found at [[Killycluggin]], [[County Cavan]], in 1921 (Site number 93, Killycluggin townland, “Archaeological Inventory of County Cavan”, Patrick O’Donovan, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;19). [[Michael J. O'Kelly|O'Kelly]], however, refers to this image as [[Crom Dubh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = O'Kelly| first = Michael J.| authorlink = Michael J. O'Kelly| editor = Claire O'Kelly| title = Early Ireland: An Introduction to Irish Prehistory| year = 1989| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 0-521-33687-2| page = 288}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Roughly cone-shaped and covered in Iron Age [[La Tène culture|La Tène]] designs [http://www.megalithicireland.com/Cavan/Killycluggin%20Stone%20001L.jpg], it was discovered broken in several pieces and partly buried close to a Bronze Age stone circle, inside which it probably once stood.&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;[http://www.cavanmuseum.ie/Default.aspx?StructureID_str=17 Killycluggin Stone] at [http://www.cavanmuseum.ie Cavan County Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; The site has several associations with St. Patrick. Nearby is ''Tobar Padraig'' (St. Patrick's Well), and Kilnavert Church, which is said to have been founded by the saint. Kilnavert was originally called ''Fossa Slécht'' or ''Rath Slécht'', from which the wider Magh Slécht area was named.

Although now much damaged, the stone can be reconstructed from the different surviving pieces. It was at least 6 foot high.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yhWFB1JAjWsC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;lpg=PA212&amp;dq=kilnavert&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=d3jibvCByF&amp;sig=9QoJIhazjWVFVmG-pQzUk-e0AMc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrg-nfpfTMAhVDJcAKHebrCLg4ChDoAQhAMAU#v=onepage&amp;q=killycluggin&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; At the base of the stone there were four rectangular adjoining panels measuring 90&amp;nbsp;cm each in width giving a circumference of 3m 60&amp;nbsp;cm when it was first carved. The height of each panel was about 75&amp;nbsp;cm. When excavated and placed upright on its flat base, it was found to lean obliquely to the left from the vertical, perhaps explaining the name ''Crom'', "bent, crooked".&lt;ref&gt;''Excavations at Killycluggin, County Cavan'' by Barry Raftery in Ulster Journal of Archaeology, Third Series, Vol. 41 (1978), pp. 49-54&lt;/ref&gt; The Killycluggin Stone, as it is known, is now in the [[Cavan County Museum]], while a rough replica stands near the road about 300 metres from the original site.&lt;ref name="museum"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.irishmegaliths.org.uk/zKillycluggin1.htm Killycluggin, county Cavan]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.megalithicireland.com/Killycluggin%20Stone,%20Cavan%20Museum.html Killycluggin Stone]
&lt;/ref&gt;

The 14th century Book of McGovern, written in Magh Slécht, contains a poem which states that Crom was situated at Kilnavert beside the road and that the local women used to tremble in fear as they passed by. There is still a local tradition in the area that the Killycluggin stone is the Crom stone.

The top of the stone [http://www.irishmegaliths.org.uk/zKillycluggin2.jpg] &lt;ref&gt;''Fragment of the Killycluggin Stone'' by Seán P. Ó Riordáin, in The Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, Vol. 82, No. 1 (1952), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; has a Hair-motif which is found on other [[La Tène]] sculptures, such as this head from [[Mšecké Žehrovice]], Czech Republic. The implication is that the Killycluggin stone was an anthropomorphic figure with a human face, which was the part that was smashed to pieces. Support for this is given by-

# [[Françoise Henry]] in her book ''Irish Art in the Early Christian Period'', p.&amp;nbsp;11 wherein she states-  ''the ornaments engraved on the stone of Killycluggin sides seems to be the edge of a garment''. 
# The Quarta Vita of [[Saint Patrick]] written c.800 A.D. states- ''But the demon, who was in the idol, fearing St. Patrick, turned the stone towards its right side, and the mark of the staff still remains in its left side''. A cone-shaped stone would not have a left or right side unless it had a human face. 
# The [[Vita tripartita Sancti Patricii]] written c. 1100 A.D. states- ''But the idol leaned over towards the sunset on its right side, for it is southwards its face was, i.e. to Tara. And the mark of Patric's staff still remains in its left side.'' Again this reference to a face. 
# The Metrical [[Dindsenchas]] written c.1160 A.D. states- ''Patrick of Armagh plied a sledge-hammer on Crom from his head to his foot: he removed with rough soldier-deed the weak image that was here.''
# By the human figure incised on the Killinagh Crom Cruaich stone&lt;ref&gt;''Killinagh Church and Crom Cruaich'' by Oliver Davies and D. Lowry-Corry, in Ulster Journal of Archaeology, Third Series, Vol. 2 (1939), pp. 98-104.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9414">This is a '''list of renamed places in [[Mozambique]]'''. During the [[Portuguese Mozambique|Portuguese colonial period]], several places had their African names changes to honor Portuguese people or places. Other settlements were simply founded by the Portuguese and named as such. After Mozambican independence in 1975, a number of cities, towns, streets, and other places were renamed, replacing Portuguese names with African names. The country itself was renamed Mozambique upon independence, having previously been called [[Portuguese Mozambique]] or [[Portuguese East Africa]].

}}

'''Margaret Cavendish Bentinck, Duchess of Portland''' (11 February 1715 &amp;ndash; 17 July 1785) was a British aristocrat, styled '''Lady Margaret Harley''' before 1734, '''Duchess of Portland''' from 1734 to her husband's death in 1761, and '''Dowager Duchess of Portland''' from 1761 until her own death in 1785.

The duchess was the richest woman in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] of her time and had the largest [[natural history]] collection in the country, complete with its own curator, the [[parson-naturalist]] [[John Lightfoot (biologist)|John Lightfoot]], and  the Swedish [[botanist]]  [[Daniel Solander]]. Her collection included costly art objects including the [[Portland Vase]]. Her ambition for her collection was for it to contain and to describe every living species.

She was a member of the [[Blue Stockings Society|Bluestockings]], a group of social intellectuals led by women. She was also great-great-great-great grandmother of Queen [[Elizabeth II]] through her mother's side.

==Early life==
She was the only surviving child of the [[Edward Harley, 2nd Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|2nd Earl of Oxford and Mortimer]], bibliophile, collector and patron of the arts, and the former [[Henrietta Harley, Countess of Oxford and Mortimer|Lady Henrietta Holles]] (1694&amp;ndash;1755, the only child and heir of the [[John Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|1st Duke of Newcastle]] and his wife, the former Lady [[Margaret Holles, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Margaret Cavendish]]).&lt;ref name="notts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/manuscriptsandspecialcollections/collectionsindepth/family/portland/biographies/biographyofmargaretcavendish-bentinck,duchessofportland(1715-1785).aspx |title=Biography of Margaret Cavendish-Bentinck, Duchess of Portland (1715-1785) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lady Margaret grew up at [[Wimpole Hall]] in [[Cambridgeshire]], surrounded by books, paintings, sculpture and in the company of writers such as [[Alexander Pope]], [[Jonathan Swift]] and [[Matthew Prior]] as well as aristocrats and politicians.  As a child, she collected pets and [[natural history]] objects (especially [[seashell]]s) and was encouraged by her father and her paternal grandfather, the [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer]], to do so.

==Marriage and issue==
At 19, on 11 July 1734, in [[Marybone Chapel|Oxford Chapel, Marylebone]], she married the [[William Bentinck, 2nd Duke of Portland|2nd Duke of Portland]], her 'Sweet Will', and they later had six children (all born at [[Welbeck Abbey]]):

# Lady Elizabeth Bentinck (1735–1825) - [[Thomas Thynne, 1st Marquess of Bath]]
# Lady Henrietta Bentinck (1737–1827) - [[George Grey, 5th Earl of Stamford]] 
# [[William Henry Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland]] (1738–1809)
# Lady Margaret Bentinck (c. 1740–1756)
# Lady Frances Bentinck (c. 1742–1743)
# Lord Edward Charles Bentinck (1744–1819)

In 1738–1756 the scholar [[Elizabeth Elstob]] was their tutor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Seale |first1=Yvonne |title=The First Female Anglo-Saxonist |url=http://www.historytoday.com/yvonne-seale/first-female-anglo-saxonist |publisher=History Today |accessdate=5 February 2016 |date=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a collector==
By the November following her marriage, her collecting had gathered pace, expanding to include the decorative and fine arts as well as natural history.  (She was already heiress to the [[Arundel collection]].)  Her home in Buckinghamshire, [[Bulstrode Hall]], provided space to house the results, and her independent fortune meant that cost was no object (on her mother’s death in 1755 she also inherited the estates of Welbeck in Nottinghamshire).  Bulstrode was known in court circles as "The Hive" for the intense work done there on the collections by the Duchess and her team of [[botany|botanists]], [[entomology|entomologists]] and [[ornithology|ornithologists]], headed by herself, [[Daniel Solander]] (1736–82, specialising in seashells and insects) and The Revd [[John Lightfoot FRS|John Lightfoot]] (1735–88, her librarian and chaplain, and an expert botanist). Her collection was, unlike many similar contemporary ones, well-curated.

In 1766, the [[Canton of Geneva|Genevan]] [[Romanticism|Romantic]] and [[philosopher]] [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] met Bentinck, admired her knowledge of botany, despite his opinion that women could not be scientific, and offered his services as her "herborist" (plant collector). She corresponded with Rousseau until she sent him a copy of [[Georg Rumpf]]'s ''Herbarium amboinense'', a botany of [[Ambon Island|Amboyna]] in what is now Indonesia, as he felt this opposed his ideal of free nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191659906000520 | title=Botanical exchanges: Jean-Jacques Rousseau and the Duchess of Portland | author=Cook, Alexandra | journal=History of European Ideas |date=June 2007 | volume=33 | issue=2 | pages=142–156 | doi=10.1016/j.histeuroideas.2006.08.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Portland Museum at Bulstrode was open to visitors, along with its zoo, aviary and vast botanic garden.  Many came: scholars, philosophers, scientists and even royalty, and the collection became a ''cause célèbre''.  Her fellow collector [[Horace Walpole]] commented on it:

{{quote|Few men have rivalled Margaret Cavendish in the mania of collecting, and perhaps no woman.  In an age of great collectors she rivalled the greatest.{{cn|date=December 2015}}}}

or, in the words of [[Mary Delany|Mrs Delany]] (a botanical artist and longtime friend):

{{quote|Surely an application to natural beauties must enlarge the mind? This house with all belonging to it is a noble school for contemplations!{{cn|date=December 2015}}}}

Her collecting was also encouraged by her creative milieu: the Duchess and Delany were both members of The [[Blue Stockings Society (England)|Bluestocking]]s, a group of aristocratic women seeking increased intellectual opportunities for members of their sex.

Her natural collection was the largest and most famous of its time, with few geographical bounds; it included objects from both Lapland and the South Seas (she patronised [[James Cook]] and bought shells from his second voyage through dealers).  She drew and recorded its specimens, sorting them innovatively in type species and displaying them alongside ancient remains such as the [[Portland Vase]], which she bought from [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]].

Lightfoot later wrote in the introduction to the 1786 auction catalogue that it was her "intention to have had every unknown species in the three kingdoms of nature described and published to the world", but this was thwarted by Solander's death in 1783 and her own two years later.  On her death, with her children uninterested in the collection, her son's political career to finance and her creditors' demands to be paid, it was her will that it be sold. The collection was entirely dissolved at an auction of over 4,000 lots at her Whitehall residence from 24 April to 3 July 1786. Hundreds of people attended, although some fine and decorative arts were bought back by her family at the auction, including the [[Portland Vase]] and pieces from [http://www.harleygallery.co.uk/portland-collection/silver/180-piece-dessert-service/ a silver-gilt dessert service the Duchess had designed herself, crawling with exquisitely modelled insects.]  However, the vast majority went, including the whole natural history collection; Walpole records that only eight days included items other than "shells, ores, fossils, birds' eggs and natural history."{{cn|date=December 2015}} Only fragments of the Portland Museum's building survive too, since Bulstrode was demolished in the 19th century.

The department of [[Manuscripts and Special Collections, The University of Nottingham]] holds some of the personal papers and correspondence of the Duchess of Portland (Pw E), as part of the Portland (Welbeck) Collection. [[Harley Gallery and Foundation|The Harley Gallery's]] Treasury Museum shows changing displays of objects from the Portland Collection.

== Foundling Hospital ==
The duchess was one of twenty-one 'ladies of quality and distinction' who supported [[Thomas Coram]]'s campaign for the establishment of a [[Foundling Hospital|Foundling Hospita]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l, signing his petition to King George II on 7th May 1735.&lt;ref&gt;Gillian Wagner, Thomas Coram, Gent. 1668-1751(Woodbridge: Boydell Press, 2004),123,199&lt;/ref&gt; Their recognition of the need for a home for orphans and abandoned children was crucial in encouraging male relatives to support Coram's project. As a result of their influence he gained signatures from the nobility, professionals, gentlemen and the judiciary for two further petitions in 1737.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth McClure, Coram's Children: The London Foundling Hospital in the Eighteenth Century (New Haven, London: Yale, 1981), 27, 34&lt;/ref&gt; A Royal Charter was granted in 1739 to which her husband, [[William Bentinck, 2nd Duke of Portland|William Bentinck,]] was one of the first signatories. Her father, [[Edward Harley, 2nd Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Edward Harley]], signed Coram's gentlemen's petition on the same day.

'''Mary Therese McCarthy''' (June 21, 1912 – October 25, 1989) was an American novelist, critic and political activist.

== Early life ==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
Born in [[Seattle, Washington]], to Roy Winfield McCarthy and his wife, the former Martha Therese Preston, McCarthy was orphaned at the age of six when both her parents died in the [[1918 flu pandemic|flu epidemic of 1918]]. She and her brothers, [[Kevin McCarthy (actor)|Kevin]], Preston, and Sheridan, were raised in very unhappy circumstances by her Catholic father's parents in [[Minneapolis|Minneapolis, Minnesota]], under the direct care of an uncle and aunt she remembered for harsh treatment and abuse.

When the situation became intolerable, she was taken in by her maternal grandparents in Seattle. Her maternal grandmother, Augusta Morganstern, was Jewish, and her maternal grandfather, Harold Preston, a prominent attorney and co-founder of the law firm [[Preston Gates &amp; Ellis]], was Presbyterian. (Her brothers were sent to boarding school.) McCarthy credited her grandfather, who helped draft one of the nation's first Workmen's Compensation Acts, with helping form her liberal views. McCarthy explores the complex events of her early life in Minneapolis and her coming of age in Seattle in her memoir, ''[[Memories of a Catholic Girlhood]]''. Her younger brother, actor [[Kevin McCarthy (actor)|Kevin McCarthy]], went on to star in such movies as ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'' (1951) and ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'' (1956).

Under the guardianship of the Prestons, McCarthy studied at the [[Forest Ridge School of the Sacred Heart]] in Seattle and [[Annie Wright Seminary]] in [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], and went on to graduate from [[Vassar College]] in [[Poughkeepsie (town), New York|Poughkeepsie, New York]], in 1933 with an [[A.B.]], [[cum laude]], where she was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]].

== Beliefs as an adult ==
McCarthy left the Catholic Church as a young woman when she became an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McCarthy |first=Mary |title=Letter to the editor: Flannery O'Connor's works |date=October 2, 1988 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/02/books/l-flannery-o-connor-s-works-684188.html |access-date=May 18, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525081014/http://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/02/books/l-flannery-o-connor-s-works-684188.html |archive-date=May 25, 2015 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her contrarian fashion, McCarthy treasured her religious education for the classical foundation it provided her intellect while at the same time she depicted her loss of faith and her contests with religious authority as essential to her character.

In New York, she moved in "[[fellow traveller|fellow-traveling]]" Communist circles early in the 1930s, but by the latter half of the decade she repudiated [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-style Communism, expressing solidarity with [[Leon Trotsky]] after the [[Moscow Trials]], and vigorously countering playwrights and authors she considered to be sympathetic to [[Stalinism]].

As part of the ''[[Partisan Review]]'' circle and as a contributor to ''[[The Nation]]'', ''[[The New Republic]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', and ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', she garnered attention as a cutting critic, advocating the necessity for creative autonomy that transcends doctrine. During the 1940s and 1950s she became a liberal critic of both [[McCarthyism]] and Communism. She maintained her commitment to liberal critiques of culture and power to the end of her life, opposing the [[Vietnam War]] in the 1960s and covering the [[Watergate scandal]] hearings in the 1970s. She visited [[Vietnam]] a number of times during the [[Vietnam War]]. Interviewed after her first trip, she declared on British television that there was not a single documented case of the [[Viet Cong]] deliberately killing a South Vietnamese woman or child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Leckie, Robert |title = The Wars of America | publisher = Castle Books | year = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote favorably about the Viet Cong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/marymcc.htm |title=Mary McCarthy |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041209133724/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/marymcc.htm |archivedate=December 9, 2004 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social life==
She married four times. In 1933 she married [[Harald Johnsrud]], an actor and would-be playwright. Her best-known spouse was the writer and critic [[Edmund Wilson]], whom she married in 1938 after leaving her lover [[Philip Rahv]], and with whom she had a son, Reuel Wilson. In 1946 she married Bowden Broadwater, who worked for the ''[[New Yorker Magazine|New Yorker]]''. In 1961, McCarthy married career diplomat James R. West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/17/arts/james-r-west-84-diplomat-married-to-mary-mccarthy.html | work=The New York Times | title=James R. West, 84, Diplomat Married to Mary McCarthy | date=September 17, 1999 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although she broke ranks with some of her ''Partisan Review'' colleagues when they swerved toward conservative politics after World War II, she carried on lifelong friendships with [[Dwight Macdonald]], [[Nicola Chiaromonte]], [[Philip Rahv]], [[F. W. Dupee]] and [[Elizabeth Hardwick (writer)|Elizabeth Hardwick]]. Perhaps most prized of all was her close friendship with [[Hannah Arendt]], with whom she maintained a sizable correspondence widely regarded for its intellectual rigor. After Arendt's passing, McCarthy became Arendt's literary executor from 1976 until her own death in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Oxford Encyclopedia of American Literature|last = Parini|first = Jay|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2004|isbn = 978-0-19-515653-9|location = |pages = 48|last2 = |doi = 10.1093/acref/9780195156539.001.0001|lccn = 2002156325|oclc = 51289864}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCarthy taught at [[Bard College]] from 1946 to 1947, and once again between 1986 and 1989. She also taught a winter semester in 1948 at [[Sarah Lawrence College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://specialcollections.vassar.edu/marymccarthy/mmbio.html |title=Mary McCarthy: A Biographical Sketch |date= |accessdate=June 26, 2014 |website=Special Collections: Mary McCarthy - A Biographical Sketch |publisher=Vassar College Libraries |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823092453/http://specialcollections.vassar.edu/marymccarthy/mmbio.html |archivedate=August 23, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary reputation ==
Her [[debut novel]], ''[[The Company She Keeps (novel)|The Company She Keeps]],'' received critical acclaim as a [[succès de scandale]], depicting the social milieu of [[New York intellectuals]] of the late 1930s with unreserved frankness. After building a reputation as a satirist and critic, McCarthy enjoyed popular success when the 1963 edition of her novel ''[[The Group (novel)|The Group]]'' remained on the [[New York Times Best Seller list]] for almost two years. Her work is noted for its precise prose and its complex mixture of autobiography and fiction.

[[Randall Jarrell]]'s 1954 novel ''[[Pictures from an Institution]]'' is said to be about McCarthy's year teaching at [[Sarah Lawrence]].

Her feud with fellow writer [[Lillian Hellman]] formed the basis for the play ''[[Imaginary Friends (play)|Imaginary Friends]]'' by [[Nora Ephron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodinvestigator.com/2002/minds.htm |title=Ben Pleasants's Contentious Minds: The Mary McCarthy / Lillian Hellman Affair |publisher=Hollywoodinvestigator.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0920/p19s01-almp.html| title=When Mary Met Lillian| work=The Christian Science Monitor| author= Saidi| date= September 20, 2002 |first = Janet}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feud had simmered since the late 1930s over ideological differences, particularly the questions of the [[Moscow Trials]] and of Hellman's support for the "Popular Front" with Stalin. McCarthy provoked Hellman in 1979 when she famously said on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'': "every word [Hellman] writes is a lie, including 'and' and 'the'."

Hellman responded by filing a $2.5 million libel suit against McCarthy, which ended shortly after Hellman died in 1984. Observers of the trial noted the resulting irony of Hellman's defamation suit is that it brought significant scrutiny, and decline of Hellman's reputation, by forcing McCarthy and her supporters to ''prove'' that she had lied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newpolitics.mayfirst.org/node/268 |title=Two Invented Lives |work=New Politics|issue=23 |date=Summer 1997 | first=Phyllis|last= Jacobson|accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCarthy also engaged in a controversy{{clarify|date=August 2018}} with USAF general [[James Robinson Risner|James Risner]] over their meeting while he was a POW in North Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url =http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1974/mar/07/on-colonel-risner/ |title = On Colonel Risner|last = McCarthy|first = Mary|date = March 7, 1974|journal = The New York Review of Books|accessdate = July 26, 2014|doi = |subscription = yes|volume = 21|issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Max van Berchem''' (16 March 1863, [[Geneva]] &amp;ndash; 7 March 1921, [[Vaumarcus]]) was a Swiss [[epigraphist]] and [[historian]]. Best known as a pioneer of Arabic [[epigraphy]], he created "Corpus Inscriptionum Arabicarum", an impressive collection of Arabic inscriptions.
== History ==
He studied at the Universities of [[University of Geneva|Geneva]], [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]], [[University of Strasbourg|Strasbourg]] and [[University of Berlin|Berlin]], receiving his degree in 1886 with the dissertation ''La propriété territorial et l'impôt sous les premiers califes''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D32268.php Historisches Lexikon der Schweiz] (biography)&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduation, he embarked on scientific expeditions to [[Egypt]] (several trips from 1887 to 1890), [[Jerusalem]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] (1888, 1893 and 1914), and [[Syria]] (1884, 1895). On these journeys he studied and collected a vast amount of Arabic inscriptions ("''Matériaux pour un Corpus Inscriptionum Arabicarum''"). Being aware of the enormity of this project, he divided the work amongst others, mostly French and German scholars, with Berchem, for the most part, limiting his personal investigations to the cities of [[Cairo]], Jerusalem and [[Damascus]]. In his work, he used photography as a means to record Arabic inscriptions. Between 1895 and 1914, he dedicated most of his time and energy towards the publication of the large amount of textual material that he had accumulated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maxvanberchem.org/en/max-van-berchem Fondation Max van Berchem] (biography)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1973 the "Max van Berchem Foundation" has financed [[archaeological]] excavations, research projects and studies in [[Islamic art]] and [[Islamic architecture|architecture]] throughout the Middle East and north Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maxvanberchem.org/en Fondation Max van Berchem]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Miguel León-Portilla''' (born 22 February 1926 in [[Mexico City]]) is a Mexican anthropologist and historian, and a major authority on [[Aztec]] thought and literature in the [[precolumbian|prehispanic]] and colonial eras. Many of his works have been translated to English and are widely read. The [[Library of Congress]] bestowed on him the [[Library of Congress Living Legend|Living Legend Award]] in 2013.&lt;ref name="Miguel León-Portilla to Receive Living Legend Award at Celebration of Mexico, Dec. 12"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2013/13-206.html?loclr=rssloc | title=Miguel León-Portilla to Receive Living Legend Award at Celebration of Mexico, Dec. 12 | publisher=US Library of Congress | date=November 20, 2013 | accessdate=November 20, 2013 | ISSN=0731-3527 | id=LOC-PR 13-206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Miguel León-Portilla had an interest in indigenous Mexico at an early age, fostered by his uncle [[Manuel Gamio]], a distinguished archeologist. Gamio had a lasting influence on his life and career, initially taking him as a boy on trips to important archeological sites in Mexico and later as well. León-Portilla attended the Instituto de Ciencias in Guadalajara and then earned a B.A. (1948) and M.A. summa cum laude (1951) at the Jesuit [[Loyola Marymount University|Loyola University]] in Los Angeles.  Returning to Mexico in 1952, he showed Gamio a play he had written on [[Quetzalcoatl]], which resulted in Gamio introducing his nephew to [[Ángel María Garibay K.|Ángel Garibay K.]]. Garibay's publications in the 1930s and 1940s first brought [[Mesoamerican literature|Nahuatl literature]] to widespread public attention in Mexico. Needing to make a living, León-Portilla began attending law school and worked at a financial firm.  At the same time he taught at [[Mexico City College]], an English-language school in the Condesa neighborhood.  Other instructors included important scholars of Mexican indigenous history and culture,  [[:es:Wigberto Jiménez Moreno|Wigberto Jiménez Moreno]], Fernando Horcasitas, and Eduardo Noguera. Gamio persuaded León-Portilla to drop his law studies and job in business to work at the Instituto Indigenista Interamericano, which Gamio directed.  León-Portilla begin graduate studies at [[UNAM]], completing his doctoral dissertation, “La Filosofía Náhuatl estudiada en sus fuentes,”  which launched his scholarly career.&lt;ref&gt;Miguel León-Portilla, Jean Meyer, and  Asa Zatz. “Miguel León-Portilla.” BOMB, No. 78, The Americas Issue (Winter, 2001/2002), pp. 66-71 Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/40426796 Accessed: 05-07-2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
His dissertation [[Aztec philosophy|Nahua philosophy]] was published in Mexico, and then translated to English as ''Aztec Thought and Culture: A Study of the Ancient Nahuatl Mind'' (1967) and then many other languages.&lt;ref&gt;Miguel León-Portilla, ''Aztec Thought and Culture: A Study of the Ancient Nahuatl Mind''. University of Oklahoma Press 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first of his many works to be translated to English.  His translations of Nahuatl and Spanish texts on the conquest of Mexico, first published in Mexico as ''Visión de los vencidos'', translated to English as ''The Broken Spears'', is the way many undergraduate students in the United States are introduced to accounts from indigenous participants and not Spanish conquistadors.&lt;ref&gt;Miguel León-Portilla, ''The Broken Spears: The Aztec Account of the Conquest of Mexico''.  2nd edition Edition. Beacon Press; 2nd edition (2006) {{ISBN| 978-0807055007}} It is ranked on Amazon as #3 best sellers on Latin American history [https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/491418/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books_1_5_last] as of 4 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

León-Portilla has spearheaded a movement to understand and re-evaluate Nahuatl literature and religion, not only from the [[pre-Columbian]] era, but also that of the present day, especially since Nahuatl is still spoken by 1.5&amp;nbsp;million people.&lt;ref name="Miguel León-Portilla to Receive Living Legend Award at Celebration of Mexico, Dec. 12"/&gt; His works in English  on literature include ''Pre-Columbian Literatures of Mexico'' (1986).,&lt;ref&gt;Miguel León-Portilla, ''Pre-Columbian Literatures of Mexico'' University of Oklahoma Press {{ISBN| 978-0806119748}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fifteen Poets of the Aztec World'' (2000),&lt;ref&gt;Miguel León-Portilla.

University of Oklahoma Press; Second edition (September 15, 1990) {{ISBN|978-0806123080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

León-Portilla was instrumental in bringing to light the works of [[Franciscan]] Fr. [[Bernardino de Sahagún]], a 16th-century primary source on the [[Aztec]] civilization, whose twelve-volume ''General History of the Things of New Spain'', often referred to as the ''[[Florentine Codex]]'' are crucial for understanding Nahua religion, society, and culture, as well as an account of the conquest of Mexico from the Mexica viewpoint. León-Portilla was the first to denote Sahagún as the "Father of Anthropology in the New World".&lt;ref&gt;Bernardino de Sahagun: First Anthropologist. University of Oklahoma Press; Reprint edition 2012) {{ISBN|978-0806142715}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has contributed to the understanding of the development of the field of Mesoamerican history in Mexico. With Garibay, León-Portilla made contributions to the study of nineteenth-century Mesoamerican historian [[Manuel Orozco y Berra]].&lt;ref&gt;Miguel León-Portilla, "Orozco y Berra: investigador del pensamiento náhuatl" in ''La filosofía náhuatl estudiada en sus fuentes''.

Nueve edición preparada por A.M. Garibay K. y Miguel León-Portilla. 4 vols.

Fondo de Cultura Económica 2017 {{ISBN|978-6071653840}} and ''Humanistas de Mesoamérica, II'', Fondo de Cultura Económica 1986 {{ISBN|978-9681653675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of colonial Nahuatl studies, particularly the [[New Philology]], León-Portilla's work on a collection of late sixteenth-century wills in Nahuatl, ''The Testaments of Culhuacan'', has contributed to the understanding of local-level interactions within a Nahua town.&lt;ref&gt;León-Portilla, Miguel.

Cline, ''Colonial Culhuacan: A Social History of an Aztec Town''. University of New Mexico Press ACLS {{ISBN|978-1597-40664-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A subordinate but important interest of León-Portilla has been the early history and ethnography of the [[Baja California Peninsula]]. He has addressed this region in more than 30 books and articles, including a 1995 volume collecting several of his earlier publications.&lt;ref&gt;León-Portilla, Miguel.  1995.

[[Image:Lithuania Plokstine missile base 1.jpg|thumb|400px|The cupola of an underground missile silo, for a [[R-12 Dvina]] missile, at former Soviet [[Plokštinė missile base]], [[Lithuania]].]]
A '''missile launch facility''', also known as an '''underground missile silo''', '''launch facility''' ('''LF'''), or '''nuclear silo''', is a vertical cylindrical structure constructed underground, for the storage and launching of [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs).

The structures typically have the [[missile]] some distance below ground, protected by a large "[[blast shelter|blast door]]" on top. They are usually connected, physically and/or electronically, to a [[missile launch control center]].

==History==
Until the 1960s ICBMs had been launched from surface bases. The Soviet Union used completely above-ground launchers similar to those found at a [[spaceport]]. In many cases they were the same ones used for civilian launches, such as [[Gagarin's Start|Site 1]] and [[Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 31|Site 31]]. They were vulnerable to [[bomber]] attacks by the United States.

===La Coupole===
The [[La Coupole]] facility is the earliest known precursor to modern underground missile silos still in existence. It was built by the forces of [[Nazi Germany]] in northern [[Occupied France]], between 1943 and 1944, to serve as a launch base for [[V-2 rocket]]s. The facility was designed with an immense concrete dome to store a large stockpile of V-2s, warheads and fuel, and was intended to launch V-2s on an industrial scale. Dozens of missiles a day were to be fuelled, prepared and rolled just outdoors of the facility's concrete casing, launched from either of two outdoor launch pads in rapid sequence against London and southern England. A similar-purpose but less-developed facility, the [[Blockhaus d'Eperlecques]], had also been built, some 14.4 kilometers (8.9 miles) north-northwest of La Coupole, and closer to intended targets in southeastern England.

Following repeated heavy bombing by Allied forces during [[Operation Crossbow]], the Germans were unable to complete construction of the works and the complex never entered service. The United Kingdom conducted [[La Coupole#Post war investigations|post-war investigations]], determining that it was "an assembly site for long projectiles most conveniently handled and prepared in a vertical position".&lt;ref&gt;[[Terence Sanders|Sanders, Terence R. B.]] (1945). "Wizernes". Investigation of the "Heavy" Crossbow Installations in Northern France. Report by the Sanders Mission to the Chairman of the Crossbow Committee. III. Technical details.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The first underground missile silo was built in the 1950s by the United Kingdom, to house their [[Blue Streak missile]]s. Only one test underground missile silo was built in the UK, at [[RAF Spadeadam]]. The UK cancelled the Blue Streak silo project, since the Soviets had developed missiles that could attack with little warning and insufficient time to arm Blue Streak missiles. The UK's ICBM nuclear missile launch mode was changed in 1960, to [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s.

[[Image:Peacekeeper missile.jpg|thumb|upright|300px|U.S. [[Peacekeeper MX]] missile launches from its underground silo launch facility]]

===United States===
The German idea of an underground missile silo was adopted and developed by the United States for missile launch facilities for its intercontinental ballistic missiles. Most silos were based in [[Colorado]], [[Nebraska]], [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Missouri]], [[Montana]], [[Wyoming]] and other western states away from heavily populated cities, although a few launch facilities had previously been located in remote areas of [[Upstate New York]] and northern [[New England]]. They had many defense systems to keep out intruders and other defense systems to prevent destruction (see [[Safeguard Program]]).

====Atlas missiles====
The [[Atlas missile]]s used four different storage and launching methods.
* The first version were vertical and above ground launchers, at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] on the [[Central Coast (California)|Central Coast of California]].
* The second version were stored horizontally in a shed-like structure with a retractable roof, to then be raised to the vertical and launched, at [[Francis E. Warren Air Force Base]] in [[Wyoming]].
* The third version were stored horizontally, but better protected in a concrete building known as a "coffin", then raised to the vertical shortly before launch. These rather poorly protected designs were a consequence of the cryogenic liquid fuels used, which required the missiles to be stored unfueled and then be fueled immediately prior to launch.
* The fourth version were stored vertically in underground silos, for the Atlas F ICBM. They were fueled in the silo, and then since they could not be launched from within the silo, were raised to the surface to launch. The [[Titan I]] missile used a similar silo basing of the fourth version.

====Configurations====
Launch facility (LF) configurations varied by U.S. missile systems.
* [[LGM-25C Titan II]] (deactivated) ICBMs were in a one [[Launch control center (ICBM)|ICBM launch control center]] (LCC) with one LF configuration (1 × 1). Titan missiles (both I and II) were located near their command and control operations personnel. Access to the missile was through tunnels connecting the launch control center and launch facility. An example of this can be seen at the [[Titan Missile Museum]], located south of Tucson, Arizona.
* The [[Solid fuel rocket|solid fueled]] [[LGM-30]] series Minuteman I, II, III, and [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper|Peacekeeper]] ICBM configurations consist of one LCC that controls ten LFs (1 × 10). Five LCCs and their fifty associated LFs make up a squadron.  Three squadrons make up a wing. Measures were taken such that if any one LCC was disabled, a separate LCC within the squadron would take control of its ten ICBMs.
* The LGM-30 LFs and LCCs are separated by several miles, connected only electronically.  This distance ensures that a nuclear attack could only disable a very small number of ICBMs, leaving the rest capable of being launched immediately.
* [[Dense Pack]] was a proposed configuration strategy for basing [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper]] ICBMs, developed under the Reagan administration, for the purpose of maximizing their survivability in case of a surprise nuclear first-strike on their silos conducted by a hostile foreign power. According to the Dense Pack strategy, a series of ten to twelve hardened silos would be grouped closely together in a line. This line of silos would generally run north-to-south, as the primary flight path for [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] inbound nuclear ICBMs would be expected to come from the north over the [[North Pole]].  The proposed Dense Pack initiative met with strong criticism in the media and in the government, and the idea was never implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Soviet Union===
The former Soviet Union had missile silos in Russia and adjacent Soviet states during the [[Cold War]], such as the [[Plokštinė missile base]] in [[Lithuania]]. The [[Main Centre for Missile Attack Warning]], near [[Solnechnogorsk]] outside Moscow, was completed in by the Soviet Union in 1971, and remains in use by the Russian Federation.

==Rapid launch underground silos==
With the introduction of the Soviet [[UR-100]] and the U.S. [[LGM-25C Titan II|Titan II]] missile series, underground silos changed in the 1960s. Both missile series introduced the use of [[hypergolic propellant]], which could be stored in the missiles, allowing for rapid launches. Both countries' liquid fueled missile systems were moved into underground silos. The introduction of solid fuel systems, in the later 1960s, made the silo moving and launching even easier.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yT_XP2UEm0E&lt;/ref&gt;

The underground missile silo has remained the primary missile basing system and launch facility for land-based missiles since the 1960s. The increased accuracy of [[inertial guidance]] systems has rendered them somewhat more vulnerable than they were in the 1960s. The U.S. spent considerable effort and funds in the 1970s and 1980s designing a replacement, but none of the new and complex system designs were ever produced.

The United States built many missile silos in the Midwest, away from populated areas. Many were built in Colorado, Nebraska, South Dakota, and North Dakota. Today they are still used, although many have been decommissioned and hazardous materials removed. Today they are popular houses and sites of urban exploration.

==Mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles==
The [[People's Republic of China]], the former [[Soviet Union]] and current [[Russia|Russian Federation]] possess mobile ICBMs. The [[United States of America]] had plans to develop mobile ICBMs but these projects were canceled at the end of the Cold War.

They include the:
* [[DF-31|DF-31 (CSS-9)]]: China, a land-based variant of the submarine-launched [[JL-2]], successor of the [[DF-4]] mobile ICBM.
* [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper#Basing options|LGM-118 Peacekeeper Mobile Protective Shelters (MPS) Plan]]: United States, 1976-1980s proposal for 200 [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper]] missiles be rotated/shuttled between 4,600 soft shelters. The 1986 [[Peacekeeper Rail Garrison]] was adjunct plan of the MPS for 50 Peacekeeper missiles to be deployed on the nation's rail network, developed from 1986 until project was cancelled in 1991.
* [[MGM-134 Midgetman]]: United States, the Small Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (SICBM) program was developed and tested, but the project was cancelled in 1992 before production commenced.
* [[RT-2PM Topol]]: Soviet Union, introduced in 1985, continues in service within the [[Strategic Missile Troops]] of the Russian Federation.
* [[RT-2PM2 Topol-M]]: Russian Federation, one of the most recent ICBMs to be deployed, and the first developed in Russia after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

==Present day==
[[File:Cuban missiles.jpg|thumb|right|A Soviet MRBM base, photographed during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. The inability of ground-based, launch complexes like this one to move makes them susceptible to discovery and long term monitoring by airborne and/or space-based surveillance systems, resulting in a push from some nuclear capable nations to place a greater number of their weapons on more mobile platforms, such as [[ballistic missile submarine]]s or [[transporter erector launcher]]s.]]
* China has silo-based weapons, but is now concentrating development on expanding its submarine and road-capable mobile weapons, especially for underground tunnel networks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2009/12/14/2009121400292.html Chosun.com (14 Dec. 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Iran]] has silo-based weapons, having built a system of underground missile silos to protect missiles from detection and (above-ground) launch facilities from aerial destruction.
* [[North Korea|Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)]], the North Korea [[Strategic Rocket Forces (North Korea)|Strategic Rocket Forces]] (Missile Guidance Bureau) are the strategic missile forces division of the [[Korean People's Army]]. 
* Russia has silo-based weapons, but has downsized their arsenal to a handful of mobile and silo-based weapons, with more [[Delta class submarine|Delta IV]] submarine-launched ballistic missiles. The [[Strategic Missile Troops|Strategic Rocket Forces of the Russian Federation (RVSN RF)]] (Strategic Missile Troops) controls Russia's land-based inter-continental ballistic missiles
* The United States has many silo based warheads in service, however, they have lowered their number to around 1800 and have transferred most of their missiles to nuclear submarines and are focusing on more advanced conventional weapons. 
===Decommissioned missile silos===
The increase of decommissioned missile silos has led governments to sell some of them to private individuals. Some buyers convert them into unique [[home]]s, ultimate [[safe room]]s, or for other purposes.

In 2000 [[William Leonard Pickard]] and a partner were convicted, in the largest [[LSD|lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)]] manufacturing case in history, of conspiracy to manufacture large quantities of LSD in a decommissioned [[SM-65 Atlas]] missile silo near [[Wamego, Kansas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cjonline.com/indepth/missilesilos/stories/090201_lsdsilomid.shtml cjonline.com: "Silo LSD" (2 Sept. 2001)]&lt;/ref&gt;

NATO doctrine about '''Nuclear Escalation''' in the cold war.

== NATO Nuclear Escalation Policy ==
[[NATO]], is an alliance of nations that via three permanent members (USA, UK, and France) is a nuclear alliance. This alliance was formed in order to provide a blanket of security for Western European nations, Canada, and the United States against the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Cimbala|1989|p=1}} NATO members get the safety of [[Nuclear weapon]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s being shared to its members from one of the 3 permanent members. However, the U.S. was the primary defender of the other countries upon NATO’s formation,{{sfn|Cimbala|1989|p=1}} due to its vast nuclear arsenal that it lays at the disposal for the organization. NATO’s escalation policies did not take hold until the late 1950’s. During the previous time the weapons and capabilities of NATO’s combined members alongside the U. S’s vast nuclear arsenal were enough to keep their citizenry calm. NATO policy would amalgamate from the U. S’s initial nuclear strength. Russia lacked ICBM’s or long range missiles to directly threaten the U.S. In contrast, the U.S. had stationed bombers within NATO countries in Europe that could deliver nuclear payloads to designated targets within the Soviet Union if they attempted to start a war. One of these was the U.S. Corporal missile with a range of 120 kilometers (70–80 miles) and had a one kiloton warhead.{{sfn|Sheehan|1983|p=117}} After the late 1950’s the USSR was able to raise its Nuclear arsenal and delivery methods to have the U.S become a capable target. Many of the European NATO countries became worried that the US’s massive firepower was equaled by the USSR and that the United states would have no reason to come to European aid with the new possibility of any attack from the U.S being met in kind with similar or greater means of nuclear arms directed at the U.S. created NATO’s response of ‘Massive Retaliation’.{{sfn|Sheehan|1983|p=110}}

European nations had the potential to become Nuclear battlefields. If a war between superpowers were to break out, even if not originating in Europe, would quickly engulf it. The possibility of Warsaw pact nations under the USSR attacking Western Europe ensured all possible conflicts of nuclear escalation. It would escalate from conventional warfare to the use of tactical [[Nuclear weapon]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and then the possibility of going further and using intermediate nuclear weapons existed.{{sfn|Chant|Hogg|1983|p=44}} The existence of nuclear weapons such as the U.S. Corporal missile, Redstone missile, Sergeant, and a missile called the Davy Crockett that was so small it could be fired by one man from the back of a jeep.{{sfn|Sheehan|1983|p=117}} These weapons given to Europe from the U.S. made it evident that if a nuclear war were to occur, it would almost surely engulf Europe as well. Strong ties, culturally, economic, and political tie the U.S with many European nations and the umbrella of [[NATO]] not only offered protection for these European countries, but also put them within the USSR’s attack possibilities in a nuclear war.{{sfn|Chant|Hogg|1983|p=44}}

[[NATO]] created policies to counter-attack the USSR as well as how to deal with them without a nuclear trigger in changing how conventional warfare would be conducted. The first alternative, horizontal escalation in which if the USSR were to attack a European country, all of Europe would be engulfed in a war. The war would be pushed outside into new theaters external to where it originated as to help spread the USSR thin militarily. NATO acknowledges that this form of escalation could not be carried out by NATO.{{sfn|Cimbala|1989|p=28}} NATO was not equipped with massive divisions of troops. NATO members could not justify the waste in money in having to keep a large peace time standing military.{{sfn|Sheehan|1983|pp=111–112}} 

The second policy being temporal escalation, a policy in which an effort is made to prolong war long enough until one side can no longer keep up with war time efforts and all available resources become exalted or a stalemate prevents either side from claiming victory. This second policy is viewed as the more conventional way to deal with the USSR. It would attempt to force the soviets into a war of attrition to force a stalemate and swiftly bring an end to any possibly conflict before nuclear means could become an option. It has several flaws, one is if a war with western powers and allies’ vs the USSR and its compatriots would create a similar war to that of World War 2 and that it could be drawn out for four years with nobody introducing a nuclear weapon attack, Calculations at the time showed that the possible war would last 3 to 4 months and would be the longest a war of its type.{{cn|date=June 2017}} 

The third policy is called ‘surprise escalation’, in which it was a theory held by [[NATO]] that it was a feasible means to avoid vertical escalation. A surprise attack would be launched to cripple the attacked country, in this case Russia, from retaliating with nuclear weapons. An example of this would be if the Soviet Union were to attack Germany, and enter the NATO operational area, would be quickly surrounded by NATO forces to prevent an accelerated push into Europe. This plan relied heavily on the ability of NATO to operate with a thin margin of error. Their conventional retaliation approach would rely on intelligence gained from outside means and a miss estimate could cause the initial encirclement force to become isolated away from the group and annihilated by the Soviet Union.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

[[NATO]] began to evolve from its previous policies and began to devise a plan suggested to it by the United States called ‘flexible response’. By NATO reasoning in the face of an all-out USSR invasion of Europe, the U.S. still guaranteed strategic help, and with a USSR invasion, it would upset the balance of world powers and force the U.S. to enter due to its many international interests that would be jeopardized. The ‘Flexible response’ policy laid out a plan for NATO in which it would develop a capacity to respond to any forms of USSR aggression without help from the U.S until all forms of action were taken and they are, battlefield, conventional, theater, or [[Nuclear weapon]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.{{sfn|Sheehan|1983|pp=113–114}} European NATO members quickly let it be known of the great cost that would be required to complete the ‘flexible position’ and that sort of cost is what they were avoiding once before in the ‘50’s when the proposal for a large ground force for NATO had been suggested.{{sfn|Sheehan|1983|pp=113–114}}  The policy of ‘Flexible Response’ was met with doubt from some Europeans. The U.S guaranteed the defense of NATO nations after NATO battlefield strategy, and theatre strategy fail in the face of an attack from the USSR, but some Europeans contended that the intermediate steps of Flexible Response were superfluous.{{sfn|Sheehan|1983|p=114}}  The Europeans whom raised this argument believed that the previous stance of NATO by threatening massive retaliation against the USSR, in which the U.S. was more than willing to respond to any attack with nuclear weapons if the USSR even thought about attacking any NATO member. They felt that massive retaliation was the better course of action due to it unfolding from a small conflict to a war of two superpowers.{{sfn|Sheehan|1983|p=114}}  These doubts within the smaller NATO countries would come to fruition when France quit believing in the past NATO ideology that heralded the U.S. as a martyr in which they would engulf their entire country in war for its allies in Europe. This led to the creation of Frances own nuclear defense program, and France would withdraw from NATO’s integrated military structure.{{sfn|Sheehan|1983|pp=114–115}}

In 1967 NATO officially accepted the doctrine of ‘Flexible Response’, but the European member’s anxieties of it came to fruition in changing how the policy was implemented. The first proposed change was to create a larger conventional standing force that if destroyed, the U.S. would then respond in kind to the USSR with nuclear weapons. This change was not fully followed through. NATO did not increase its conventional force size, and by not doing so they retained a meager standing military that could be annihilated by the USSR in moments. This policy, after the Europeans amalgamated it, allowed them to retain the previous defense employed. NATO forces were insignificant, but the U.S nuclear might was superior and it created the deterrence they sought at the time.{{sfn|Sheehan|1983|p=115}}  To further increase deterrence NATO adopted dual capable missile systems, such as the 155mm artillery. It allowed for the delivery of either a conventional payload or a nuclear one. This was not done only for simplicity of ordinance, but as a sign to any USSR aggression that they were prepared to use nuclear weapons given to them.{{sfn|Sheehan|1983|p=116}}

NATO had a good foundation of Nuclear weapons provided by the U.S and a small amount via Britain. They possessed 1,081 155mm artillery, 319 203&amp;nbsp;mm artillery, 90 Lance missiles, 91 Honest John missiles, and 180 Pershing 1A missiles that were all nuclear capable with allocated nuclear payloads. In 1974 France created the Pluton. It was an all French tactical missile and made it available to NATO. It was a fully mobile, accurate missile with the capability to deliver a 25-kiloton bomb for attacking rear areas, or a smaller 15-kiloton bomb designed to destroy advancing troops.{{sfn|Sheehan|1983|p=118}} By 1981, over 30 Pluton units were deployed with available reloads accompanying them throughout Europe.{{sfn|Sheehan|1983|p=118}}  NATO’s battlefield deterrence was not the bulk of its later capabilities in the ‘80’s. NATO also possessed a large amount of nuclear capable aircraft that could be used in multiple roles, nuclear and non-nuclear, within a conflict.{{sfn|Sheehan|1983|p=119}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3127">'''Racial liberalism''' is an era in [[History of the United States|American history]] during the 1940s that is considered by many historians as the precursor to the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s. 

==Causes==
Historians contend that the era of racial liberalism had its roots in [[New Deal]] liberalism. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s New Deal programs laid out a legacy that inspired and empowered many American citizens who had fallen victim to the [[Great Depression]] to challenge the power of corporations and other institutions. 

The [[Double V campaign]] is considered one of the most important events during the period of racial liberalism. The purpose of the campaign was to raise awareness about [[Racial segregation|segregation]] and [[racism]] during [[World War II]]. 

The War was also a source of racial liberalism in that previously [[marginalized]] groups of Americans were able to gain a foothold in the economy due to the need for a strong labor force. This gain in economic power translated into strong political power, and as a result, certain government actions, such as [[Executive Order 8802]], were implemented to aid these groups.

==Basic tenets==
There were three basic ideas to 1940s racial liberalism:
*A belief that government legislatures and courts should lend a helping hand to battle racial discrimination.
*An emphasis on "equal opportunity" legislation, such as the dismantling of legalized segregation and the establishment of anti-discrimination laws in all aspects of American life.
*The idea that [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] is socially constructed.

==Limits==
Some historians argue that though racial liberalism helped to pave the way for civil rights movements in America, it failed to recognize that people from many different ethnic backgrounds were affected by [[racism in the United States]]. Much of racial liberalist efforts emphasized "the Negro problem" – that the marginalization of [[African Americans]] in the United States should be addressed – rather than emphasizing the impacts of racial inequality for all of those affected. This prevented many racial minorities from benefiting from the fruits of racial liberalism.

Another criticism is that many proponents of racial liberalism attempted a "one-size-fits-all" solution to racism in the 1940s. This was also a failing point in that not all solutions for African-Americans were good for other non-white groups at the time.

Racial liberalism was also relatively unsuccessful in its endeavor to pressure government to step in and stop racist practices, particularly because of the limited financial resources of the United States government at the time.

==Early life==

Shrestha (alternative names: Rebati Ramanananda Shrestha Vaidya and Revatiramanananda Sreshtha Vaidya) was born in [[Kathmandu]] to father Basudevananda and mother Chandra Maya Shrestha. He was educated at [[Durbar High School]] in Kathmandu.

==Political career==

Shrestha joined the underground movement against the [[Rana dynasty]] in 1948 while a student at Durbar High. In 1949, he formed an underground organization named Suhrid Mandal to carry on the struggle for democracy in Nepal. The group disbanded as the authorities were beginning to close in on it.

After finishing the [[School Leaving Certificate (Nepal)|School Leaving Certificate]] (SLC) exams in 1949, Shrestha became general secretary of Rana Bidrohi Mandal ("Anti-Rana Organization") and continued to work in the democracy movement. He gave up active politics and turned to writing and serving Nepal Bhasa following the overthrow of the Rana regime and establishment of democracy in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;"Profile of R. R. N. Syasya" in ''Kapan'' (1956). Kathmandu: Thaunkanhe Prakashan Bibhag.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, T. Louise (1996). ''The Challenge to Democracy in Nepal: A Political History.'' Routledge. {{ISBN|0415085764}}, 9780415085762. Page 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing career==

Shrestha enrolled in Nepal National College in 1954. His first publication was ''Malakha'' (meaning "Dragon"), a collection of poems, which came out in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6DNYgEACAAJ&amp;dq=syasya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2b9lT-iJC8nhrAeSk-m9Bw&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Google Books|publisher= |accessdate=18 March 2012|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, while a student at Tri-Chandra College, he helped establish Nepal Bhasa Sahitya Pala, an organization of students, with the objective of conducting literary activities in Nepal Bhasa.&lt;ref&gt;"Profile of R. R. N. Syasya" in ''Kapan'' (1956). Kathmandu: Thaunkanhe Prakashan Bibhag.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shrestha has served as an editor of Nepal Bhasa literary magazines ''[[Thaunkanhe]]'' and ''Nepal''. He was an executive member of the Nepal Bhasa Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nepal Bhasa Academy|url=http://digitalcommons.macalester.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1397&amp;context=himalaya&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fsa%3Dt%26rct%3Dj%26q%3Drebati%2Bramanananda%2Bshrestha%26source%3Dweb%26cd%3D5%26ved%3D0CDoQFjAE%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fdigitalcommons.macalester.edu%252Fcgi%252Fviewcontent.cgi%253Farticle%253D1397%2526context%253Dhimalaya%26ei%3DYrxlT66NJ5HyrQewqdS8Bw%26usg%3DAFQjCNGjoHGI-b-1xOkHkArgDfBKoXhEqA#search=%22rebati%20ramanananda%20shrestha%22|accessdate=18 March 2012|newspaper=Himalayan Research Bulletin|year=1991}} Page 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Stephen Foster’s sketchbook''' is the hand-written book authored by early American [[composer]] and [[lyricist]] [[Stephen Collins Foster]]. It spans a nine-year period beginning on June 26, 1851. It was donated to the [[University of Pittsburgh Library System]] by the Foster family in the early 1930s. The National History Education Clearinghouse considers it a " useful resource for those researching Foster or the history of 19th-century American music and culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Stephen Foster's Sketchbook | publisher= National History Education Clearinghouse | url = http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/website-reviews/22662# | accessdate = 2016-12-26  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:The Stephen Collins Foster sketchbook kept in a safe at the archives.jpg|thumb|left|The Stephen Collins Foster sketchbook kept in a safe at the archives]]
The sketchbook measures {{convert|12|by|8|in|cm|abbr=off}} and contains 113 leaves of half-bound paper. The papers are of the same material and contained in a cover of thick paper boards, covered in red and blue marbleized paper and brown [[leather]]. Eight pages are missing. One page had been cut out by the composer’s granddaughter but was restored to its original place in the sketchbook. The entries are consistent, similar and handwritten with pencil. The book is inscribed “Allegheny City June 26, 1851” in Foster’s hand on page 1.&lt;ref name="aid1"&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Stephen Foster's Sketchbook|url=http://images.library.pitt.edu/s/sketchbook/songs.html|year=|publisher=Foster Hall Collection, Center for American Music, University of Pittsburgh Library System, University of Pittsbrugh|access-date= 14 August 2016|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The sketchbook contains handwritten draft texts for sixty-four different songs. Some of these were some of his most popular. Some pages contain musical notations, draft lyrics are for unpublished songs, scribbles, doodles, and exercises. In some places it appears that Foster practiced his signature and initials.&lt;ref name="aid1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=blake&gt;{{cite web|first=Sharon |last = Blake|title=Stephen Foster's Personal Sketchbook Now Online, Pages show original lyrics and doodles of America's first professional songwriter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=&amp;pg=PA|year=2005|publisher=University of Pittsburgh News Service |access-date= 14 August 2016|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the digital version, a photostat of the sketchbook was published by the staff of the Foster Hall Collection in 1933. This full transcript of the book was created by Deane L. Root and edited by Kathryn Miller Haines in June 2000. The Transcript field within the database contains the text and is searchable. Foliation (recto and verso) numbers were supplied in 1986 using archival techniques.&lt;ref name="aid1"/&gt;

The draft and original text for Foster's song "[[Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair]]" is contained in the sketchbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Foster | first = Stephen | title = Stephen Foster collection : 10 early American songs for solo voice and piano&amp;nbsp;— medium high edition | publisher = Alfred Publishing Company | location = Van Nuys, CA | year = 2016 | isbn = 9781470635886 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Foster records his meeting with [[Charles Dickens]] while Dickens was visiting in Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Powel|first1=John|title=Biographical dictionary of literary influences: the nineteenth century, 1800-1914|date=2001|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=031330422X|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digitizing the Sketchbook==

Dr. Julia Craig-McFeeley of the Digital Image Archive of Medieval Manuscripts in Oxford, England created the digitized version of the sketchbook in March 2005. The digitizing was performed by a PhaseOne PowerPhase FX digital scanning back mounted on a Fuji GX 680 III professional SLR camera body and medium format lens at a resolution of 800dpi.&lt;ref name="aid1"/&gt;

Stephen Foster's sketchbook was used as a display and exhibition for recent visits from library archivists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Manuscript Society gets a new look at some very old writings in Pittsburgh |publisher= Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |first=Anya |last=Sostek| url = http://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2014/05/23/Historical-documents-put-on-display-here-Group-gets-a-new-look-at-some-very-old-writings/stories/201405230069 | date= 22 May 2014

This is one of only a few pieces autobiographical, besides a few short letters to his family.

{{Quote box|width=80em|align=center|quote=The Public Broadcasting organization describes the sketchbook:
"''Stephen spent much of his life in Pittsburgh where he worked consistently at his songwriting, keeping a thick sketchbook to draft ideas for song lyrics and melodies. As a professional songwriter of unparalleled skill and technique &amp;ndash; not an untutored musical genius &amp;ndash; he had made it his business to study the various music and poetic styles circulating in the immigrant populations of the new United States. His intention was to write the people's music, using images and a musical vocabulary that would be widely understood by all groups. Foster worked very hard at writing, sometimes taking several months to craft and polish the words, melody, and accompaniment of a song before sending it off to a publisher. His sketchbook shows that he often labored over the smallest details, the right prepositions, even where to include or remove a comma from his lyrics."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = American Experience, Stephen Foster | publisher=Public Broadcasting Service (PBS)| url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/foster/peopleevents/p_sfoster.html | accessdate = 2016-12-26  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{div col end}} }}

The '''Stolpersteine in the Lake Constance district''' lists all [[Stolpersteine]] that have been collocated in [[Friedrichshafen]] and [[Überlingen]] in the [[Bodenseekreis]] ("Lake Constance district") in the very South of [[Germany]]. Stolpersteine is the German name for stumbling blocks collocated all over Europe by German artist [[Gunter Demnig]]. They remember the fate of the Nazi victims being murdered, deported, exiled or driven to suicide.

&lt;small&gt;The list is sortable; the basic order follows the alphabet according to the last name of the victim.&lt;/small&gt;

| '''{{SortKeyName|Elsa|Hammer|nl=1}}''' née Fellheimer was born on 1 December 1884 in [[Göppingen]]. Her parents were Isaak Fellheimer and Mathilde née Bernheim. She had two younger brothers, Joseph and Theo, and was growing up in a well protected environment. One of her relatives was [[Albert Einstein]]. She married Karl Hammer, a merchant from Göppingen. The couple moved to the Lake Constance. The Hammers did not have children, but they gave home to a foster child, Martha Mutter. The two nieces of Elsa Hammer, Margot and Lore-Luise, regularly spent their holidays with her aunt. She was the only Jew in Friedrichshafen and well respected. Due to the Christian origin of her husband she was living in a ″privileged mixed marriage″ and was therefore protected from deportation. This status ended all of a sudden when her husband died on 21 July 1943. She was arrested, brought to [[Stuttgart]] and deported to [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] on 14 September 1943. There she was murdered in the course of the [[Shoah]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Südwestrundfunk|SWR]]: ''[http://www.swr.de/swr2/stolpersteine/menschen/stolperstein-elsa-hammer/-/id=12117596/did=15182214/nid=12117596/48i8u0/index.html Elsa Hammer: Hosen statt Röcke]'', 5 March 2015 (with four pictures of Elsa Hammer and her family)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anton Fuchsloch: ''[http://www.schwaebische.de/region_artikel,-Stolperstein-fuer-Elsa-Hammer-_arid,5496429_toid,310.html Stolperstein für Elsa Hammer]'', [[Schwäbische Zeitung]], 9 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundesarchiv.de/gedenkbuch/de830971 Elsa Hammer im Gedenkbuch]&lt;/ref&gt;

| '''{{SortKeyName|Hermann|Levinger|nl=1}}''' was born on 25 August 1865 in [[Karlsruhe]]. He studied law. During this period he converted to [[Protestantism]]. He became an official at the District Office of Überlingen, then worked at the district council of Mannheim, then became the executive commissioner of the Grand Ducal District Office, and finally Landrat. In 1902, he married the widow Maria Karolina von Bünau née Staib. In 1904, their only daughter Barbara was born. In 1930, Levinger retired and the family moved to Wiesbaden, where they were hoping for a cure for Maria Levinger, who suffered of gout. But she died in 1933. In 8 December 1944, Hermann Levinger and his daughter – after they had learned that they were to be deported to Auschwitz – decided to end their lives. They took poison. The old man died the same day, his daughter two days later.

'''Technicolor''' is a series of [[Color motion picture film|color motion picture]] processes, the first version dating from 1916,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=US|number=1208490|status=patent|fdate=1916-02-16|gdate=December 12, 1916}}&lt;/ref&gt; and followed by improved versions over several decades.

It was the second major color process, after Britain's [[Kinemacolor]], and the most widely used color process in Hollywood from 1922 to 1952. Technicolor became known and celebrated for its highly saturated color, and was initially most commonly used for filming musicals such as ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939) and ''[[Down Argentine Way]]'' (1940), [[Historical period drama|costume pictures]] such as ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (film)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' (1938) and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939), and [[animation|animated]] films such as ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937), ''[[Gulliver's Travels (1939 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]'' (1939), and ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940). As the technology matured it was also used for less spectacular dramas and comedies. Occasionally, even a [[film noir]]—such as ''[[Leave Her to Heaven]]'' (1945) or ''[[Niagara (1953 film)|Niagara]]'' (1953)—was filmed in Technicolor.

"Technicolor" is the trademark for a series of color motion picture processes pioneered by Technicolor Motion Picture Corporation (a subsidiary of Technicolor, Inc.), now a division of the French company [[Technicolor SA]]. The Technicolor Motion Picture Corporation was founded in Boston in 1914 (incorporated in Maine in 1915) by [[Herbert Kalmus]], [[Daniel Frost Comstock]], and W. Burton Wescott.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/oldcolor/fortune-page01.htm What? Color in the Movies Again?]" ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'', October 1934.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Tech" in the company's name was inspired by the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], where both Kalmus and Comstock received their undergraduate degrees and were later instructors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.wgbh.org/post/how-mit-and-technicolor-helped-create-hollywood|title=How MIT And Technicolor Helped Create Hollywood|date=31 July 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technicolor, Inc. was chartered in Delaware in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;"$1,000,000 Company Will Color Movies", ''The New York Times'', September 21, 1922, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Technicol.-Prizma Controversy", ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Dec. 7, 1922, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Technicolor's early patents were taken out by Comstock and Wescott, while Kalmus served primarily as the company's president and chief executive officer.

==Name usage==
The term "Technicolor" historically has been used to describe at least five concepts:
*'''Technicolor''': an umbrella company encompassing all of the below as well as other ancillary services. (1914–present)
*'''Technicolor labs''': a collection of [[film laboratory|film laboratories]] across the world owned and run by Technicolor for post-production services including developing, printing, and transferring films in all major color film processes, as well as Technicolor's proprietary ones. (1922–present)
*'''Technicolor process''' or '''format''': several custom image origination systems used in film production, culminating in the "three-strip" process in 1932. (1917–1955)
*'''Technicolor IB printing''' ("IB" abbreviates "[[imbibition]]", a [[Dye-transfer process|dye-transfer]] operation): a process for making color motion picture prints that allows the use of dyes which are more stable and permanent than those formed in ordinary [[chromogenic]] color printing. Originally used for printing from color separation negatives photographed on black-and-white film in a special Technicolor camera. (1928–2002, with differing gaps of availability after 1974 depending on the lab)
*'''Prints''' or '''Color by Technicolor''': used from 1954 on, when [[Eastmancolor]] (and other single-strip color film stocks) supplanted the three-film-strip camera negative method, while the Technicolor IB printing process continued to be used as one method of making the prints.&lt;ref name="eastman 1955"/&gt; This meaning of the name applies to nearly all Wikipedia articles about films made from 1954 onward (see [[#The introduction of Eastmancolor and decline|The introduction of Eastmancolor and decline]] below) in which Technicolor is named in the credits. (1953–present)

{{refimprove section|date=October 2015}}

===Two-color Technicolor===

====Process 1====
[[File:The-gulf-between-surviving-cell.jpg|thumb|right|Frame from a surviving fragment of ''The Gulf Between'' (1917), the first publicly shown Technicolor film]]
Technicolor originally existed in a [[RG color space|two-color (red and green) system]]. In Process 1 (1916), a [[prism]] [[beam-splitter]] behind the camera lens exposed two consecutive frames of a single strip of black-and-white negative film simultaneously, one behind a red filter, the other behind a green filter. Because two frames were being exposed at the same time, the film had to be photographed and projected at twice the normal speed. Exhibition required a special projector with two [[apertures]] (one with a red filter and the other with a green filter), two lenses, and an adjustable prism that aligned the two images on the screen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?id=LH9SAAAAEBAJ&amp;zoom=4&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Cinematographic Multiplex Projection, &amp;c]. U.S. Patent No. 1,391,029, filed Feb. 20, 1917.&lt;/ref&gt; The results were first demonstrated to members of the [[American Institute of Mining Engineers]] in New York on February 21, 1917.&lt;ref&gt;"Moving Pictures in Color", ''The New York Times'', February 22, 1917, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Technicolor itself produced the only movie made in Process 1, ''[[The Gulf Between (1917 film)|The Gulf Between]]'', which had a limited tour of Eastern cities, beginning with Boston and New York on September 13, 1917, primarily to interest motion picture producers and exhibitors in color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/technicolor-100-years-the-gulf-between/|title=The first Technicolor film was a total disaster a century ago|date=2017-09-09|work=CNET|access-date=2018-06-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The near-constant need for a technician to adjust the projection alignment doomed this [[additive color]] process. Only a few frames of ''The Gulf Between'', showing star [[Grace Darmond]], are known to exist today.
[[File:Anna May Wong holds child in The Toll of the Sea.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Frame from the Technicolor picture ''[[The Toll of the Sea]]'' (1922)]]

====Process 2====
Convinced that there was no future in additive color processes, Comstock, Wescott, and Kalmus focused their attention on subtractive color processes.  This culminated in what would eventually be known as Process 2 (1922) (in the later 1900s commonly called by the misnomer, "two-strip Technicolor").  As before, the special Technicolor camera used a beam-splitter that simultaneously exposed two consecutive frames of a single strip of black-and-white film, one behind a green filter and one behind a red filter.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=XSoDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA59 The First Successful Color Movie]", ''Popular Science'', Feb. 1923, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference was that the two-component negative was now used to produce a [[subtractive color]] print. Because the colors were physically present in the print, no special projection equipment was required and the correct registration of the two images did not depend on the skill of the projectionist.

The frames exposed behind the green filter were printed on one strip of black-and-white film, and the frames exposed behind the red filter were printed on another strip. After development, each print was toned to a color nearly [[complementary color|complementary]] to that of the filter: orange-red for the green-filtered images, cyan-green for the red-filtered ones. Unlike tinting, which adds a uniform veil of color to the entire image, toning chemically replaces the black-and-white silver image with transparent coloring matter, so that the highlights remain clear (or nearly so), dark areas are strongly colored, and intermediate tones are colored proportionally. The two prints, made on film stock half the thickness of regular film, were then cemented together back to back to create a projection print. ''[[The Toll of the Sea]]'', which debuted on November 26, 1922, used Process 2 and was the first general-release film in Technicolor.

[[File:Phantomtechnicolor.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Frame enlargement of a Technicolor segment from ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925). The film was one of the earliest uses of the process on interior sets, and demonstrated its versatility.]]
The second all-color feature in Process 2 Technicolor, ''[[Wanderer of the Wasteland (1924 film)|Wanderer of the Wasteland]]'', was released in 1924. Process 2 was also used for color sequences in such major motion pictures as ''[[The Ten Commandments (1923 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1923), ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925), and ''[[Ben-Hur (1925 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1925). [[Douglas Fairbanks]]' ''[[The Black Pirate]]'' (1926) was the third all-color Process 2 feature.

Although successful commercially, Process 2 was plagued with technical problems. Because the images on the two sides of the print were not in the same plane, both could not be perfectly in focus at the same time. The significance of this depended on the [[depth of focus]] of the projection optics. Much more serious was a problem with cupping. Films in general tended to become somewhat cupped after repeated use: every time a film was projected, each frame in turn was heated by the intense light in the projection gate, causing it to bulge slightly; after it had passed through the gate, it cooled and the bulge subsided, but not quite completely. It was found that the cemented prints were not only very prone to cupping, but that the direction of cupping would suddenly and randomly change from back to front or vice versa, so that even the most attentive projectionist could not prevent the image from temporarily popping out of focus whenever the cupping direction changed. Technicolor had to supply new prints so the cupped ones could be shipped to their Boston laboratory for flattening, after which they could be put back into service, at least for a while. The presence of image layers on both surfaces made the prints especially vulnerable to scratching, and because the scratches were vividly colored they were very noticeable. Splicing a Process 2 print without special attention to its unusual laminated construction was apt to result in a weak splice that would fail as it passed through the projector. Even before these problems became apparent, Technicolor regarded this cemented print approach as a stopgap and was already at work developing an improved process.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/oldcolor/kalmus.htm Kalmus, Herbert. "Technicolor Adventures in Cinemaland", ''Journal of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers'', December 1938]"&lt;/ref&gt;

====Process 3====
Based on the same [[Handschiegl Color Process|dye-transfer technique]] first applied to motion pictures in 1916 by Max Handschiegl, Technicolor Process 3 (1928) was developed to eliminate the projection print made of double-cemented prints in favor of a print created by ''[[Imbibition|dye imbibition]]''. The Technicolor camera for Process 3 was identical to that for Process 2, simultaneously photographing two consecutive frames of a black-and-white film behind red and green filters.

In the lab, skip-frame printing was used to sort the alternating color-record frames on the camera negative into two series of contiguous frames, the red-filtered frames being printed onto one strip of specially prepared "matrix" film and the green-filtered frames onto another. After processing, the gelatin of the matrix film's emulsion was left proportionally hardened, being hardest and least soluble where it had been most strongly exposed to light. The unhardened fraction was then washed away. The result was two strips of relief images consisting of hardened gelatin, thickest in the areas corresponding to the clearest, least-exposed areas of the negative.

To make each final color print, the matrix films were soaked in dye baths of colors nominally [[complementary color|complementary]] to those of the camera filters: the strip made from red-filtered frames was dyed cyan-green and the strip made from green-filtered frames was dyed orange-red. The thicker the gelatin in each area of a frame, the more dye it absorbed. Each matrix in turn was pressed into contact with a plain gelatin-coated strip of film known as the "blank" and the gelatin "imbibed" the dye from the matrix. A [[mordant]] made from deacetylated [[chitin]] was applied to the blank before printing, to prevent the dyes from migrating or "bleeding" after they were absorbed.

Dye imbibition was not suitable for printing optical soundtracks, which required very high resolution, so when making prints for [[sound-on-film]] systems the "blank" film was a conventional black-and-white film stock on which the soundtrack, as well as frame lines, had been printed in the ordinary way prior to the dye transfer operation.

The first feature made entirely in the Technicolor Process 3 was ''[[The Viking (1928 film)|The Viking]]'' (1928), which had a synchronized score and sound effects. ''[[Redskin (film)|Redskin]]'' (1929), with a synchronized score, and ''[[The Mysterious Island (1929 film)|The Mysterious Island]]'' (1929), a part-talkie, were photographed almost entirely in this process also but included some sequences in black and white. The following talkies were made entirely – or almost entirely – in Technicolor Process 3: ''[[On with the Show (1929 film)|On with the Show!]]'' (1929) (the first all-talking color feature), ''[[Gold Diggers of Broadway (film)|Gold Diggers of Broadway]]'' (1929), ''[[The Show of Shows (film)|The Show of Shows]]'' (1929), ''[[Sally (1929 film)|Sally]]'' (1929), ''[[The Vagabond King (1930 film)|The Vagabond King]]'' (1930), ''[[Follow Thru (film)|Follow Thru]]'' (1930), ''[[Golden Dawn (film)|Golden Dawn]]'' (1930), ''[[Hold Everything (1930 film)|Hold Everything]]'' (1930), ''[[The Rogue Song (film)|The Rogue Song]]'' (1930), ''[[Song of the Flame (film)|Song of the Flame]]'' (1930), ''[[Song of the West (film)|Song of the West]]'' (1930), ''[[The Life of the Party (1930 film)|The Life of the Party]]'' (1930), ''[[Sweet Kitty Bellairs (film)|Sweet Kitty Bellairs]]'' (1930), ''[[Bride of the Regiment]]'' (1930), ''[[Mamba (film)|Mamba]]'' (1930), ''[[Whoopee! (film)|Whoopee!]]'' (1930), ''[[The King of Jazz (1930 film)|King of Jazz]]'' (1930), ''[[Under a Texas Moon (film)|Under a Texas Moon]]'' (1930), ''[[Bright Lights (1930 film)|Bright Lights]]'' (1930), ''[[Viennese Nights (film)|Viennese Nights]]'' (1930), ''[[Woman Hungry (film)|Woman Hungry]]'' (1931), ''[[Kiss Me Again (1931 film)|Kiss Me Again]]'' (1931) and ''[[Fifty Million Frenchmen (film)|Fifty Million Frenchmen]]'' (1931). In addition, scores of features were released with Technicolor sequences. Numerous short subjects were also photographed in Technicolor Process 3, including the first color sound cartoons by producers such as [[Ub Iwerks]] and [[Walter Lantz]]. ''[[Song of the Flame]]'' became the first color movie to use a [[widescreen]] process (using a system known as [[Vitascope]], which used 65mm film).

In 1931, an improvement of Technicolor Process 3 was developed which removed grain from the Technicolor film, resulting in more vivid and vibrant colors.&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles Times, June 7, 1931, Page C9.&lt;/ref&gt; This process was first used on a [[RKO Pictures|Radio Picture]] entitled ''[[The Runaround (1931 film)|The Runaround]]'' (1931). The new process not only improved the color but also removed specks (that looked like bugs) from the screen, which had previously blurred outlines and lowered visibility. This new improvement along with a reduction in cost (from 8.85 cents to 7 cents per foot) led to a new color revival.&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles Times, June 7, 1931, Page C9; The Washington Post, September 11, 1931, Page 12; Los Angeles Times, July 9, 1931, Page A9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Warner Brothers]] took the lead once again by producing three features (out of an announced plan for six features): ''[[Manhattan Parade (film)|Manhattan Parade]]'' (1932), ''[[Doctor X (film)|Doctor X]]'' (1932) and ''[[Mystery of the Wax Museum (film)|Mystery of the Wax Museum]]'' (1933). Radio Pictures followed by announcing plans to make four more features in the new process.&lt;ref&gt;Radio Pictures announced plans to make four color features under the titles of "The Runaround" (produced), "Babes in Toyland" (never produced), "Macheta" (never produced) and "Bird of Paradise" (changed to black and white).&lt;/ref&gt; Only one of these, ''[[Fanny Foley Herself (film)|Fanny Foley Herself]]'' (1931), was actually produced. Although [[Paramount Pictures]] announced plans to make eight features and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] promised two color features, these never materialized.&lt;ref&gt;MGM announced plans to make ''The Merry Widow'' in color and also to rework a revue called ''[[The March of Time (film)|The March of Time]]'' with a storyline for release. The only Paramount feature that seems to have been announced was a picture called ''Rose of the Rancho'' which was to have starred Richard Arlen and Dolores Del Rio.&lt;/ref&gt; This may have been the result of the lukewarm reception to these new color pictures by the public. Two independently produced features were also made with this improved Technicolor process: ''[[Legong (film)|Legong: Dance of the Virgins]]'' (1934) and ''[[Kliou the Tiger (film)|Kliou the Tiger]]'' (1935).

Very few of the original camera negatives of movies made in Technicolor Process 2 or 3 survive. In the late 1940s, most were discarded from storage at Technicolor in a space-clearing move, after the studios declined to reclaim the materials. Original Technicolor prints that survived into the 1950s were often used to make black-and-white prints for television and simply discarded thereafter. This explains why so many early color films exist today solely in black and white.

Warner Bros., which had vaulted from a minor exhibitor to a major studio with its introduction of the [[talkie]]s, incorporated Technicolor's printing to enhance its films. Other producers followed Warner Bros.' example by making features in color, with either Technicolor, or one of its competitors, such as [[Brewster Color]] and [[Multicolor]] (later [[Cinecolor]]).

Consequently, the introduction of color did not increase the number of moviegoers to the point where it was economical. This and the [[Great Depression]] severely strained the finances of the movie studios and spelled the end of Technicolor's first financial successes.

====Process 4: Development and introduction====
Technicolor envisioned a full-color process as early as 1924 and was actively developing such a process by 1929. Hollywood made so much use of Technicolor in 1929 and 1930 that many believed the feature film industry would soon be turning out color films exclusively. By 1931, however, the [[Great Depression]] took its toll on the movie industry, which began to cut back on expenses. The production of color films had decreased dramatically by 1932, when Burton Wescott and Joseph A. Ball completed work on a new three-color movie camera. Technicolor could now promise studios a full range of colors, as opposed to the limited red-green spectrum of previous films. The new camera simultaneously exposed three strips of black-and-white film, each of which recorded a different color of the spectrum. The new process would last until the last Technicolor feature film was produced in 1955.

[[File:3-strip Technicolor camera.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Three-strip Technicolor camera from the 1930s]]
Technicolor's advantage over most early natural-color processes was that it was a [[Subtractive color|subtractive synthesis]] rather than an [[Additive color|additive]] one: unlike the additive [[Kinemacolor]] and [[Léon Gaumont|Chronochrome]] processes, Technicolor prints did not require any special projection equipment. Unlike the additive [[Dufaycolor]] process, the projected image was not dimmed by a light-absorbing and obtrusive mosaic color filter layer. Very importantly, compared to competing subtractive systems, Technicolor offered the best balance between high image quality and speed of printing.

The Technicolor Process 4 camera, manufactured to Technicolor's detailed specifications by [[Mitchell Camera]] Corporation, contained color [[filter (optics)|filters]], a [[beam splitter]] consisting of a partially reflecting surface inside a split-cube [[Prism (optics)|prism]], and three separate rolls of black-and-white film (hence the "three-strip" designation). The beam splitter allowed ⅓ of the light coming through the camera lens to pass through the reflector and a green filter and form an image on one of the strips, which therefore recorded only the green-dominated third of the [[visible spectrum|spectrum]]. The other ⅔ was reflected sideways by the mirror and passed through a magenta filter, which absorbed green light and allowed only the red and blue thirds of the spectrum to pass. Behind this filter were the other two strips of film, their [[photographic emulsion|emulsions]] pressed into contact face to face. The front film was a red-blind [[orthochromatic]] type that recorded only the blue light. On the surface of its emulsion was a red-orange coating that prevented blue light from continuing on to the red-sensitive [[panchromatic]] emulsion of the film behind it, which therefore recorded only the red-dominated third of the spectrum.

Each of the three resulting negatives was printed onto a special matrix film. After processing, each matrix was a nearly invisible representation of the series of film frames as gelatin reliefs, thickest (and most absorbent) where each image was darkest and thinnest where it was lightest. Each matrix was soaked in a dye complementary to the color of light recorded by the negative printed on it: cyan for red, magenta for green, and yellow for blue (see also: [[CMYK color model]] for a technical discussion of color printing).

A single clear strip of black-and-white film with the soundtrack and [[frame line]]s printed in advance was first treated with a [[mordant]] solution and then brought into contact with each of the three dye-loaded matrix films in turn, building up the complete color image. Each dye was absorbed, or imbibed, by the gelatin coating on the receiving strip rather than simply deposited onto its surface, hence the term "dye imbibition". Strictly speaking, this is a mechanical printing process, very loosely comparable to [[offset printing]] or [[lithography]],&lt;ref name="eastman dye"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eastman.org/technicolor/technology/dye-transfer-printing |title=Dye-Transfer Process |website=Technicolor100, Eastman Museum |access-date=4 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708154347/http://eastman.org/technicolor/technology/dye-transfer-printing|archive-date=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not a photographic one, as the actual printing does not involve a chemical change caused by exposure to light.

During the early years of the process, the receiver film was preprinted with a 50% black-and-white image derived from the green strip, the so-called Key, or K, record. This procedure was used largely to cover up fine edges in the picture where colors would mix unrealistically (also known as [[Purple fringing|fringing]]). This additional black increased the contrast of the final print and concealed any fringing. However, overall colorfulness was compromised as a result. In 1944, Technicolor had improved the process to make up for these shortcomings and the K record was, thence, eliminated.

====Early adoption by Disney====

Kalmus convinced [[Walt Disney]] to shoot one of his ''[[Silly Symphony]]'' cartoons, ''[[Flowers and Trees]]'' (1932), in Process 4, the new "three-strip" process. Seeing the potential in full-color Technicolor, Disney negotiated an exclusive contract for the use of the process that extended to September 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Other studios could then start producing cartoons with the three-strip process, but were still barred from releasing them until 1936. "Technicolor Signs With Disney", ''The Wall Street Journal'', April 17, 1934, p. 10; "Mickey Mouse Falls Under Technicolor's Sway", ''The New York Times, February 3, 1935, p. X5; Nelson B. Bell, "The New Trichrome Process Is About to Meet Test on Screen", ''The Washington Post'', June 2, 1935, p. SO1. Douglas W. Churchill, "Advices From the Film Citadel", ''The New York Times'', June 9, 1935, p. X3.&lt;/ref&gt; Other animation producers, such as the [[Fleischer Studios]] and the [[Ub Iwerks]] studio, were shut out – they had to settle for either the two-color Technicolor systems or use a competing process such as [[Cinecolor]].

''Flowers and Trees'' was a success with audiences and critics alike, and won the first [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film]]. All subsequent ''Silly Symphonies'' from 1933 on were shot with the three-strip process. One ''Silly Symphony'', ''[[Three Little Pigs (film)|Three Little Pigs]]'' (1933), engendered such a positive audience response that it overshadowed the feature films with which it was shown. [[Hollywood]] was buzzing about color film again. According to ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine, "[[Merian C. Cooper]], producer for [[RKO Radio Pictures]] and director of ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933), saw one of the ''Silly Symphonies'' and said he never wanted to make a black-and-white picture again."

Although Disney's first 60 or so Technicolor cartoons used the three-strip camera, an improved "successive exposure" process was adopted circa 1937. This variation of the three-strip process was designed primarily for cartoon work: the camera would contain one strip of black-and-white negative film, and each animation cel would be photographed three times, on three sequential frames, behind alternating red, green, and blue filters (the so-called "Technicolor Color Wheel", then an option of the Acme, Producers Service and Photo-Sonics animation cameras).&lt;ref&gt;"Two key advantages to SE as opposed to three-strip photography is that the optical path is far simpler resulting in a single focal plane for each frame, and the alignment of frames from a single strip of film as opposed to three separate records is far easier. This is clearly evident when we are working with our nitrate negatives." [http://www.thedigitalbits.com/articles/robertharris/harris101308.html Interview with Theo Gluck, Director of Library Restoration and Preservation for Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402213956/http://www.thedigitalbits.com/articles/robertharris/harris101308.html |date=2009-04-02 }}, by Robert A. Harris, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Three separate dye transfer printing matrices would be created from the red, green, and blue records in their respective complementary colors, cyan, magenta and yellow.

Successive exposure was also employed in Disney's "True Life Adventure" live-action series, wherein the 16mm Kodachrome Commercial principal photography element was first duplicated onto a 35mm fine-grain SE negative element in one pass of the 16mm element, thereby reducing wear on the relatively small 16mm element and also eliminating registration errors between colors. The live-action SE negative thereafter entered other Technicolor processes and were incorporated with SE animation and three-strip studio live-action, as required, thereby producing the combined result.

====Convincing Hollywood====

The studios were willing to adopt three-color Technicolor for live-action feature production, if it could be proved viable. Shooting three-strip Technicolor required very bright lighting, as the film had an extremely slow [[film speed|speed]] of ASA 5. That, and the bulk of the cameras and a lack of experience with three-color [[cinematography]] made for skepticism in the studio boardrooms.

An October 1934 article in ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine stressed that Technicolor, as a corporation, was rather remarkable in that it kept its investors quite happy despite the fact that it had only been in profit twice in all of the years of its existence, during the early boom at the turn of the decade. A well-managed company, half of whose stock was controlled by a clique loyal to Kalmus, Technicolor never had to cede any control to its bankers or unfriendly stockholders. In the mid-'30s, all the major studios except MGM were in the financial doldrums, and a color process that truly reproduced the visual spectrum was seen as a possible shot-in-the-arm for the ailing industry.

In November 1933, Technicolor's Herbert Kalmus and [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] announced plans to produce three-strip Technicolor films in 1934, beginning with [[Ann Harding]] starring in a projected film ''The World Outside''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Activities on the Western Front|date=November 5, 1933|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1933/11/05/105814858.pdf|accessdate=December 6, 2008 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Live-action use of three-strip Technicolor was first seen in a musical number of the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] feature ''[[The Cat and the Fiddle (film)|The Cat and the Fiddle]]'', released February 16, 1934. On July 1, MGM released ''[[Hollywood Party (1934 film)|Hollywood Party]]'' with a Technicolor cartoon sequence "Hot Choc-late Soldiers" produced by Walt Disney. On July 28 of that year, [[Warner Brothers]] released ''Service with a Smile'', followed by  ''Good Morning, Eve!'' on September 22, both being comedy [[short film]]s starring [[Leon Errol]] and filmed in three-strip Technicolor. [[Pioneer Pictures]], a movie company formed by Technicolor investors, produced the film usually credited as the first live-action short film shot in the three-strip process, ''[[La Cucaracha (1934 film)|La Cucaracha]]'' released August 31, 1934. ''La Cucaracha'' is a two-reel musical comedy that cost $65,000, approximately four times what an equivalent black-and-white two-reeler would cost. Released by [[RKO]], the short was a success in introducing the new Technicolor as a viable medium for live-action films. The three-strip process also was used in some short sequences filmed for several movies made during 1934, including the final sequences of ''[[The House of Rothschild]]'' ([[Twentieth Century Pictures]]/[[United Artists]]) with [[George Arliss]] and ''[[Kid Millions]]'' ([[Samuel Goldwyn|Samuel Goldwyn Studios]]) with [[Eddie Cantor]].

Pioneer/RKO's ''[[Becky Sharp (film)|Becky Sharp]]'' (1935) became the first [[feature film]] photographed entirely in three-strip Technicolor. Initially, three-strip Technicolor was only used indoors. In 1936, ''[[The Trail of the Lonesome Pine (1936 film)|The Trail of the Lonesome Pine]]'' became the first production to have outdoor sequences, with impressive results.  The spectacular success of ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937), which was released in December 1937 and became the top-grossing film of 1938, attracted the attention of the studios.

====Limitations and difficulties====
One major drawback of Technicolor's three-strip process was that the cameras required a special, bulky, large volume sound blimp. Film studios could not purchase Technicolor cameras, only rent them for their productions, complete with camera technicians and a "color supervisor" to ensure sets, costumes and makeup didn't push beyond the limitations of the system. Often on many early productions, the supervisor was [[Natalie Kalmus]], ex-wife of Herbert Kalmus and part owner of the company. Directors had great difficulty with her; [[Vincente Minnelli]] said, "I couldn't do anything right in Mrs. Kalmus's eyes."&lt;ref&gt;Vincente Minnelli, ''I Remember It Well'', New York: Doubleday, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; The ex-Mrs. Kalmus preferred the title "Technicolor Director", although British licensees generally insisted on "Colour Control" so as not to "dilute" the film director's title. She worked with quite a number of "associates", many of whom went uncredited, and after her retirement, these associates were transferred to the licensees, with, for example, Leonard Doss going to Fox where he performed the same function for Fox's DeLuxe Color.

The process of splitting the image reduced the amount of light reaching the film stock. Since the [[film speed]] of the stocks used were fairly slow, early Technicolor productions required a greater amount of lighting than a black-and-white production. It is reported that temperatures on the film set of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' from the hot studio lights frequently exceeded 100&amp;nbsp;°F (38&amp;nbsp;°C), and some of the more heavily costumed characters required a large water intake. Some actors and actresses claimed to have suffered permanent eye damage from the high levels of illumination.&lt;ref&gt;Richard B. Jewell. The golden age of cinema: Hollywood, 1929–1945. Blackwell Pub. 2007 p 103&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the added lighting, triple amount of film, and the expense of producing dye transfer projection prints, Technicolor demanded high film budgets.

====The introduction of Eastmancolor and decline====
{{more footnotes|section|date=December 2010}}
[[File:Gentlemen Prefer Blondes Movie Trailer Screenshot (34).jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953 film)|Gentlemen Prefer Blondes]]'', an example of Technicolor filming in 1950s [[Hollywood]].]]Color films that recorded the three primary colors in three emulsion layers on one strip of film had been introduced in the mid-1930s by [[Eastman Kodak]] in the United States ([[Kodachrome]] for 16mm home movies in 1935, then for 8mm home movies and 35mm slides in 1936) and [[Agfa]] in Germany ([[Agfacolor|Agfacolor Neu]] for both home movies and slides later in 1936). Technicolor introduced ''Monopack'', a single-strip color [[reversal film]] (a 35&amp;nbsp;mm lower-contrast version of Kodachrome) in 1941 for use on location where the bulky three-strip camera was impractical, but the higher grain of the image made it unsuitable for studio work.

Eastman Kodak introduced its first 35&amp;nbsp;mm color motion picture negative film in 1950. The first commercial feature film to use Eastmancolor was the [[National Film Board of Canada]] documentary ''[[Royal Journey]]'', released in December 1951.&lt;ref name="kodak 1940"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://motion.kodak.com/US/en/motion/Products/Chronology_Of_Film/chrono2.htm |title=Chronology of Motion Picture Films: 1940–1959 |publisher=Kodak |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113153832/http://motion.kodak.com/US/en/motion/Products/Chronology_of_Film/chrono2.htm |archive-date=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, Eastman Kodak introduced a high-quality color print film, allowing studios to produce prints through standard photographic processes as opposed to having to send them to Technicolor for the expensive dye imbibition process.&lt;ref name ="kodak 1940" /&gt; That same year, the Technicolor lab adapted its dye transfer process to derive matrices and imbibition prints directly from Eastmancolor negatives, as well as other stocks such as Ansco and DuPont color stocks. ''[[Foxfire (1955 film)|Foxfire]]'' (1955), filmed in 1954 by [[Universal Studios|Universal]], starring [[Jane Russell]] and [[Jeff Chandler (actor)|Jeff Chandler]], was the last American-made feature photographed with a Technicolor three-strip camera.

In an attempt to capitalize on the Hollywood 3-D craze, Technicolor unveiled its [[stereoscopic]] camera for [[3-D films]] in March 1953. The rig used two three-strip cameras, running a total of six strips of film at once (three for the left eye and three for the right).&lt;ref&gt;March 14, 1953 "New Technicolor 3-D Camera" BoxOffice Magazine. Page 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Only two films were shot with this camera set-up: ''Flight to Tangier'' (1953) and the [[Martin and Lewis]] comedy ''[[Money From Home]]'' (1954). A similar, but different system had been used by a different company, using two three-strip cameras side-by-side for a British short called ''Royal River''.

As the end of the Technicolor process became apparent, the company repurposed its three-color cameras for wide-screen photography, and introduced the [[Technirama]] process in 1957.&lt;ref name="eastman 1955"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eastman.org/technicolor/decades/1955-1975|title=1955-1975 |website=Technicolor100, Eastman Museum |access-date=4 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225075844/https://www.eastman.org/technicolor/decades/1955-1975 |archive-date=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other formats the company ventured into included [[VistaVision]], [[Todd-AO]], and [[Ultra Panavision 70]]. All of them were an improvement over the three-strip negatives, since the negative print-downs generated sharper and finer grain dye transfer copies.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

By the mid-1960s, the dye-transfer process eventually fell out of favor in the United States as being too expensive and too slow in turning out prints. With the growing number of screens in the US, the standard run of 200–250 prints increased.  And while dye-transfer printing yielded superior color printing, the number of high speed prints that could be struck in labs all over the country outweighed the fewer, slower number of prints that could only be had in Technicolor's labs. One of the last American films printed by Technicolor was ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' (1974).&lt;ref name="eastman dye" /&gt;

In 1975, the US dye transfer plant was closed and Technicolor became an Eastman-only processor. In 1977, the final dye-transfer printer left in Rome was used by [[Dario Argento]] to make prints for his horror film ''[[Suspiria]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianapublicmedia.org/arts/dario-argentos-suspiria-visual-aural-masterwork/ |title= Dario Argento’s Suspiria: A Visual and Aural Masterwork |publisher=Indiana Public Media |date= |accessdate= September 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, the Italian Technicolor plant ceased printing dye transfer.

The British line was shut down in 1978 and sold to Beijing Film and Video Lab which shipped the equipment to China. A great many films from China and Hong Kong were made in the Technicolor dye transfer process,&lt;ref name="eastman 1975" /&gt; including [[Zhang Yimou|Zhang Yimou's]] ''[[Ju Dou]]'' (1990) and even one American film, ''[[Space Avenger]]'' (1989), directed by [[Richard W. Haines]]. The Beijing line was shut down in 1993 for a number of reasons, including inferior processing.

==Post-1995 usage==

===Reintroduction of the dye transfer process===
In 1997, Technicolor reintroduced the dye transfer process to general film printing. A refined version of the printing process of the 1960s and 1970s, it was used on a limited basis in the restorations of films such as ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[Gone With the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]'', ''[[Rear Window]]'', ''[[Funny Girl (film)|Funny Girl]]'', and ''[[Apocalypse Now Redux]]''.&lt;ref name="color db"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zauberklang.ch/filmcolors/timeline-entry/6170/ |title=Technicolor No. VI: Dye-transfer prints from enhanced process  |website=Timeline of Historical Film Colors |last1=Flueckiger |first1=Barbara |access-date=4 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After its reintroduction, the dye transfer process was used in several big-budget, modern [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] productions. These included ''[[Bulworth]]'', ''[[The Thin Red Line (1998 film)|The Thin Red Line]]'', ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]'', ''[[Toy Story 2]]'', and ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]''.&lt;ref name="eastman 1975"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eastman.org/technicolor/decades/1975-2015 |title=1975-2015 |website=Technicolor100, Eastman Museum |access-date=4 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225080026/https://www.eastman.org/technicolor/decades/1975-2015 |archive-date=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="color db" /&gt;

The dye-transfer process was discontinued by Technicolor in 2002 after the company was purchased by [[Technicolor SA|Thomson]].&lt;ref name="color db" /&gt;

===Dye transfer Technicolor in archival work===
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Looney Tunes.png|thumb|right|250px|Technicolor label on the opening credits of a ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoon.]] --&gt;
By the late 1990s, the dye transfer process still had its advantages in the film archival community. Because the dye transfer process used stable [[acid dye]]s, Technicolor prints are considered of archival quality. A Technicolor print from the dye transfer era will retain its original colors virtually unchanged for decades with proper storage, whereas prints printed on Eastmancolor stocks produced prior to 1983 may suffer color fading after exposure to ultraviolet light and hot, humid conditions as a result of less stable photochemical dyes.  Fading on some prints is so rapid that in some cases, after as little as five to ten years, the colors of the print have faded to a brownish red.

Furthermore, three-strip camera negatives are all on silver-based black-and-white stock, which have stayed unaltered over the course of time with proper handling. This has become of importance in recent years with the large market for films transferred to video formats for home viewing. The best color quality control for video transfer by far is achieved by optically printing from Technicolor negatives, or by recombining the three-strip black and white negatives through digital means and printing, onto low-contrast stock.  Director [[George Lucas]] had a three-strip archival negative, and one or more imbibition prints made of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''; this "protection" copy was consulted for color values in putting together the 1997 Special Edition of ''Star Wars''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2010/05/star-wars/|title=Untouched is impossible: the story of Star Wars in film|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One problem that has resulted from Technicolor negatives is the rate of shrinkage from one strip to another.  Because three-strip negatives are shot on three rolls, they are subject to different rates of shrinkage depending on storage conditions. Today, digital technology allows for a precise re-alignment of the negatives by resizing shrunken negatives digitally to correspond with the other negatives. The G, or Green, record is usually taken as the reference as it is the record with the highest resolution. It is also a record with the correct "wind" (emulsion position with respect to the camera's lens). Shrinkage and re-alignment (resizing) are non-issues with Successive Exposure (single-roll RGB) Technicolor camera negatives. This issue could have been eliminated, for three-strip titles, had the preservation elements (fine-grain positives) been Successive Exposure, but this would have required the preservation elements to be 3,000 feet or 6,000 feet whereas three-strip composited camera and preservation elements are 1,000 feet or 2,000 feet (however, three records of that length are needed).

One issue that modern reproduction has had to contend with is that the contrast of the three film strips is not the same.  This gives the effect on Technicolor prints that (for example) fades cause the color balance of the image to change as the image is faded.  Transfer to digital media has attempted to correct the differing color balances and is largely successful.  However, a few odd artifacts remain such that saturated parts of the image may show a false color.  Where the image of a flame is included in shot, it will rarely be of the expected orange/yellow color, often being depicted as green. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===Technicolor today===
The Technicolor company remained a highly successful film processing firm and later became involved in video and audio duplication (CD, VHS and DVD manufacturing) and digital video processes. [[MacAndrews &amp; Forbes]] acquired Technicolor, Inc. in 1982 for $100 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html|title=MACANDREWS &amp; FORBES GROUP INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30|date=12 November 1983|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; then sold it in 1988 to the British firm [[Carlton Communications]] PLC for $780 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Carlton-Communications-PLC-Company-History.html|title=History of Carlton Communications PLC – FundingUniverse|work=fundinguniverse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technicolor, Inc. acquired the film processing company [[Consolidated Film Industries]] in [[2000 in film|2000]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technicolor.com/Cultures/En-Us/About/Press/PressRelease2000/TechnicolorDevelopsBigger.htm|title=Technicolor - Technology-driven company for Media &amp; Entertainment|website=www.technicolor.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113111541/http://www.technicolor.com/Cultures/En-Us/About/Press/PressRelease2000/TechnicolorDevelopsBigger.htm|archivedate=2006-11-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2001, Technicolor has been part of the French-headquartered electronics and media conglomerate [[Technicolor SA|Thomson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technicolor.com/Cultures/En-Us/About/Press/PressRelease2001/DefinitiveAgreementReached.htm|title=Technicolor - Technology-driven company for Media &amp; Entertainment|website=www.technicolor.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113111845/http://www.technicolor.com/Cultures/En-Us/About/Press/PressRelease2001/DefinitiveAgreementReached.htm|archivedate=2006-11-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of Thomson group was changed to “Technicolor SA” {{as of|2010|February|1|lc=y|df=US}}, re-branding the entire company after its American film technology subsidiary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118014337.html?categoryId=1009&amp;cs=1 | work=Variety | title=Technicolor reinventing itself | first=David S. | last=Cohen | date=January 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time the English arrived in Tsenacommacah, the [[Powhatan]] Indian Chiefdom included over 30 tribes.  Each tribe had its own name and chief (''werowance''/''[[weroance]]'' or ''weroansqua'' if female), and the chiefdom as a whole was ruled by a paramount chief (''mamanatowick'') named Wahunsenacawh, or more popularly [[Chief Powhatan]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 &gt;Rountree, Helen C.

The Eastern Shore Indians, the ''Accawmacke'', who numbered around 2000, paid nominal tribute to the Powhatan, but enjoyed a large degree of semi-autonomy under their own paramount chief, [[Debedeavon]] ("the Laughing King").

==History==

By early 1609, relations had begun to sour between the Powhatan and the English.  As a result Powhatan moved his primary residence from [[Werowocomoco]], off the York River, to Orapax (or [[Orapakes]]), located in a swamp at the head of the [[Chickahominy River]].  By 1614 Powhatan had again moved his primary residence, this time further northwest to a location on the north bank of the [[Pamunkey River]] known as [[Matchut]]. Matchut was not far from where Powhatan's brother [[Opechancanough]] ruled at [[Youghtanund]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
 
Powhatan died in 1618, after which the chiefdom was ultimately passed to his younger brother [[Opechancanough]], who led the [[Indian Massacre of 1622]] as well as a second attack in 1644. Both attacks provoked English retaliations.  A peace treaty, signed in 1646, brought an end to the conflicts between the Powhatan and the English. The treaty was signed by Opechancanough's successor [[Necotowance]] – Opechancanough himself was captured by the English and killed by an English guard in 1646.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 &gt;[http://www.nps.gov/jame/historyculture/powhatan-indian-lifeways.htm Powhatan Indian Lifeways]&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the treaty of 1646, the size of Tsenacommacah was reduced. The boundaries specified in the treaty separated Virginia Indian lands from those that were considered English-owned, and restricted crossings to those on official business. Badges were required for all visitors. The treaty also established the payment of a yearly tribute to the English, as well as delineating a number of tribal land reservations.&lt;ref name=autogenerate3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Karenne. The Virginia Indian Heritage Trail, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Among the surviving tribes of the now-dissolved Confederacy, the [[Appomattoc]]s, [[Nansemond]]s and [[Weanoc|Weyanokes]] retreated to the south, becoming independent of Necotowance, as did the [[Powhite]]s or Powhatan proper. The [[Pamunkey]], [[Mattaponi]], [[Chickahominy]], [[Rappahannock tribe|Rappahannock]], [[Kiskiack]], [[Wicocomico|Wiccocomico]], [[Patawomeck]], [[Morattico]], [[Nanzatico]], [[Sekakawon]], and [[Onawmanient]], occupying the peninsulas north of the York, were cut off from the southern tribes by the English enclave.

The [[Virginia Colony]] long respected its southern boundary established by this treaty, refusing to recognize settlements beyond it as late as 1705. However, the ban on settling north of the York river was lifted September 1, 1649, and a wave of new immigrants quickly flooded the northern tribes, leaving them scattered and isolated on ever-shrinking patches of land.  That year, the Pamunkey ''weroance'', [[Totopotomoi]], received {{convert|5000|acre|km2}} for his tribe along both sides of the upper Pamunkey River,&lt;ref&gt;Helen Rountree, 1990, ''Pocahontas's People'', p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[Kiskiack]] ''weroance'', Ossakican was reserved {{convert|5000|acre|km2}} on the Piankatank.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Rountree, 1990, ''Pocahontas's People'', p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1650, another treaty reserved land for the creation of Indian towns, where {{convert|50|acre|m2}} of land was granted per warrior.  These lands became smaller and smaller in following years.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Tracts were surveyed for the remaining tribes in the following decades, but these quickly shrank as they were either sold off or in some cases actually seized outright.

Following [[Bacon's Rebellion]], The Treaty of Middle Plantation was signed by many Virginia Indian leaders in 1677, limiting Tsenocommacah even further.&lt;ref name=autogenerate3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The treaty set up six reservations, reinforced the annual tribute payment to the English, and more fully acknowledged the Virginia tribes' subjection to the King of England.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

All of the reservations, save two, were lost over the next two centuries.  Even so, many of the remaining tribes still live in or near their ancestral lands.  The [[Pamunkey]] and [[Mattaponi]] are the only tribes that still maintain their reservations from the 17th century.  As such, these two tribes still make their yearly tribute payments, of fish and game, as stipulated by the 1646 and 1677 treaties.  As far as anyone knows, the tribes have not missed a "payment" in 331 years.  Every year, on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, they go to the Virginia Governor's house in Richmond to make their yearly payment.  A ceremony is held in which a deer, turkey, or fish and some pottery are presented to the governor.  Before the ceremony a brunch is held where the tribes are able to converse with the governor. It has not always been easy for the Mattaponi and the Pamunkey to get the necessary items for their yearly payment, but they have made it a point of honor to uphold their end of the bargain.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 &gt;Waugaman, Sandra F. and Danielle-Moretti Langholtz, PhD.

'''Ulm''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʊlm|-|Ulm.ogg}}) is a city in the federal German state of [[Baden-Württemberg]], situated on the [[River Danube]]. The city, whose population is estimated at almost 120,000 (2015), forms an urban district of its own ({{lang-de|Stadtkreis}}) and is the administrative seat of the [[Alb-Donau (district)|Alb-Donau district]]. Founded around 850, Ulm is rich in history and traditions as a former [[free imperial city]] ({{lang-de|freie Reichsstadt}}). Today, it is an economic centre due to its varied industries, and it is the seat of the [[University of Ulm]]. Internationally, Ulm is primarily known for having the church with the tallest steeple in the world ({{convert|161.53|m|abbr=on|2|disp=or}}), the Gothic minster ([[Ulm Minster]], German: Ulmer Münster), and as the birthplace of [[Albert Einstein]].

==Geography==
[[File:Ulm Fußgängerzone.jpg|thumb|left|View from the [[Ulm Munster|Münster]] towards Hirschstraße.]]
Ulm lies at the point where the rivers [[Blau (Danube)|Blau]] and [[Iller]] join the [[Danube]], at an altitude of {{convert|479|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]]. Most parts of the city, including the old town, are situated on the left bank of the Danube; only the districts of Wiblingen, Gögglingen, Donaustetten and Unterweiler lie on the right bank. Across from the old town, on the other side of the river, lies the [[twin cities|twin city]] of [[Neu-Ulm]] in the state of [[Bavaria]], smaller than Ulm and, until 1810, a part of it (population c. 50,000).

Except for the Danube in the south, the city is surrounded by forests and hills which rise to altitudes of over {{convert|620|m|2|abbr=off|lk=out}}, some of them part of the [[Swabian Alb]]. South of the Danube, plains and hills finally end in the northern edge of the [[Alps]], which are approximately {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} from Ulm and are visible from the city on clear days.

The city of Ulm is situated in the northern part of the North Alpine [[Foreland basin]], where the basin reaches the [[Swabian Alb]]. The [[Turritellenplatte]] of Ermingen ("Erminger Turritellenplatte") is a famous palaeontological site of [[Burdigalian]] age.

== Neighboring communes ==
On the right (south-eastern) side of Danube and Iller there is the Bavarian district town [[Neu-Ulm]]. On the left (north-western) side Ulm is almost completely surrounded by the Alb-Danube district. The neighboring communes of Baden-Württemberg are the following: [[Illerkirchberg]], [[Staig]], [[Hüttisheim]], [[Erbach an der Donau|Erbach (Donau)]], [[Blaubeuren]], [[Blaustein]], [[Dornstadt]], [[Beimerstetten]] and [[Langenau]] as well as the eastern neighboring community [[Elchingen]].

== Town subdivisions ==
The&amp;nbsp;city&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;divided into 18 districts ({{lang-de|[[:de:Stadtteile|Stadtteile]]}}): Ulm-Mitte, Böfingen, Donaustetten, Donautal, Eggingen, Einsingen, Ermingen, Eselsberg, Gögglingen, Grimmelfingen, Jungingen, Lehr, Mähringen, Oststadt, Söflingen (with Harthausen), Unterweiler, Weststadt, and Wiblingen.

Nine districts that were integrated during the latest municipality reform in the 1970s (Eggingen, Einsingen, Ermingen, Gögglingen-Donaustetten, Jungingen, Lehr, Mähringen und Unterweiler). They have own local councils which acquire an important consulting position to the whole city council concerning issues that are related to the prevailing districts. But at the end, final decisions can only be made by the city council of the entire city of Ulm.

==History==
{{see also|Free Imperial City of Ulm}}
[[File:Braun Ulm UBHD.jpg|thumb|Ulm in 1572 by [[Georg Braun|Frans Hogenberg]]]]
The oldest traceable settlement of the Ulm area began in the early [[Neolithic]] period, around 5000 BC. Settlements of this time have been identified at the villages of Eggingen and Lehr, today districts of the city. In the city area of Ulm proper, the oldest find dates from the late Neolithic period. The earliest written mention of Ulm is dated 22 July 854 AD, when King [[Louis the German]] signed a document in the King's palace of "Hulma" in the [[Duchy of Swabia]].&lt;ref name="500px"&gt;{{cite web|title=ulm-by-michael-vogt|url=http://500px.com/photo/9821081/ulm-by-michael-vogt|work=500px.com|accessdate=May 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was declared an [[Imperial Free City|Imperial City]] ({{lang-de|Reichsstadt}}) by [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich Barbarossa]] in 1181.

At&amp;nbsp;first,&amp;nbsp;Ulm's significance was due to the privilege of a ''Königspfalz'', a place of accommodation for the medieval German kings and emperors on their frequent travels. Later, Ulm became a city of traders and craftsmen. One of the most important legal documents of the city, an agreement between the Ulm patricians and the trade guilds ({{lang-de|Großer Schwörbrief}}), dates from 1397. This document, considered an early city constitution, and the beginning of the construction of an enormous church ([[Ulm Minster]], 1377), financed by the inhabitants of Ulm themselves rather than by the church, demonstrate the assertiveness of Ulm's medieval citizens. Ulm blossomed during the 15th and 16th centuries, mostly due to the export of high-quality [[textiles]]. The city was situated at the crossroads of important trade routes extending to Italy. These centuries, during which many important buildings were erected, also represented the zenith of art in Ulm, especially for [[painting|painter]]s and [[sculpture|sculptors]] like [[Hans Multscher]] and [[Jörg Syrlin the Elder]]. During the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], Ulm became Protestant (1530). With the establishment of new trade routes following the discovery of the [[New World]] (16th century) and the outbreak and consequences of the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48), the city began to decline gradually. Around 1700, it was alternately invaded several times by [[France|French]] and [[Bavaria]]n soldiers.

[[File:Charles Thévenin - Reddition de la ville d'Ulm.jpg|thumb|The capitulation of Ulm. General Mack and 23,000 Austrian troops surrendered to [[Napoleon]].]]
In the wars following the [[French Revolution]], the city was alternately occupied by French and [[Austria]]n forces, with the former ones destroying the city fortifications. In 1803, it lost the status of Imperial City and was absorbed into [[Bavaria]]. During the campaign of 1805, [[Napoleon]] managed to trap the invading Austrian army of [[Karl Freiherr Mack von Leiberich|General Mack]] and forced it to surrender in the [[Battle of Ulm]]. In 1810, Ulm was incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Württemberg]] and lost its districts on the other bank of the Danube, which came to be known as [[Neu-Ulm]] (New Ulm).

In the mid-19th century, the city was [[Fortresses of the German Confederation|designated a fortress]] of the [[German Confederation]] with huge military construction works directed primarily against the threat of a French invasion. The city became an important centre of [[industrialisation]] in southern Germany in the second half of the 19th century, its built-up area now being extended beyond the medieval walls. The construction of the huge minster, which had been interrupted in the 16th century for economic reasons, was resumed and eventually finished (1844–91) in a wave of German national enthusiasm for the [[Middle Ages]].

From 1933 to 1935, a [[concentration camp]] primarily for political opponents of the regime was established on the Kuhberg, one of the hills surrounding Ulm. The [[Jews]] of Ulm, around 500 people, were first discriminated against and later persecuted; their [[synagogue]] was torn down after [[Kristallnacht]] in November 1938. The sole RAF [[strategic bombing during World War II]] against Ulm occurred on December 17, 1944, against the two large [[Transportation Plan|lorry factories]] of [[Meillerwagen|Magirus]]-Deutz and [[Karl Kässbohrer Fahrzeugwerke|Kässbohrer]], as well as other industries, barracks, and depots in Ulm. The Gallwitz Barracks and several military hospitals were among 14 Wehrmacht establishments destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/dec44.html |title=RAF History - Bomber Command 60th Anniversary |publisher=Raf.mod.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20070706011932/http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/dec44.html |archivedate=2007-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The raid killed 707 Ulm inhabitants and left 25,000 homeless and after all the bombings, over 80% of the medieval city centre lay in ruins.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Most of the city was rebuilt in the plain and simple style of the 1950s and 1960s, but some of the historic landmark buildings have been restored. Due to its almost complete destruction in 1944, the Hirschstraße part of the city primarily consists of modern architecture. Ulm experienced substantial growth in the decades following World War II, with the establishment of large new housing projects and new industrial zones. In 1967, [[Ulm University]] was founded, which proved to be of great importance for the development of the city. Particularly since the 1980s, the transition from classical industry towards the high-tech sector has accelerated, with, for example, the establishment of research centres of companies like [[Daimler AG|Daimler]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] and [[Nokia]] and a number of small applied research institutes near the university campus. The city today is still growing, forming a [[twin cities|twin city]] of 170,000 inhabitants together with its neighbouring Bavarian city of [[Neu-Ulm]], and seems to benefit from its central position between the cities of [[Stuttgart]] and [[Munich]] and thus between the cultural and economic hubs of southern Germany.

==Economy==

[[File:Kirche St Georg Ulm.jpg|thumb|[[Saint George]]'s Catholic church, Ulm]]
The city has very old trading traditions dating from medieval times and a long history of industrialisation, beginning with the establishment of a [[railway station]] in 1850. The most important sector is still classical industry (machinery, especially motor vehicles; [[electronics]]; [[pharmaceuticals]]). The establishment of the [[University of Ulm]] in 1967, which focuses on [[biomedicine]], the sciences, and engineering, helped support a transition to high-tech industry, especially after the crisis of classical industries in the 1980s. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

== Ecology ==
In 2007 the City of Ulm was awarded the European Energy Award for its remarkable local energy management and its efforts to combat climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ulm.de/ulm_erhaelt_european_energy_award.44870.3076,.htm|title=Stadt Ulm - Ulm erhält 'European Energy Award'|author=Stadt Ulm|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of these efforts are a [[biomass]] power plant operated by the ''Fernwärme Ulm GmbH'' (10 [[Megawatt|MW]] electrical output), and the world's biggest [[passive house]] office building, the so-called ''Energon'', located in the "Science City" near the university campus. Moreover, the city of Ulm boasts the second largest [[solar power]] production in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lars Schulz |url=http://www.solarbundesliga.de |title=Solarbundesliga |publisher=Solarbundesliga.de |date=2010-03-27 |accessdate=2010-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; For all new buildings, a strict energy standard (German KFW40 standard) has been mandatory since April 2008. Ulm Minster has been fully powered by renewables since January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080503052308/http://www.swu-fakten.de/fakten/swu/ ''SWU Fakten''], Stadtwerke Ulm, visited 15.

== Transportation ==
[[File:Strassenbahn ulm stadion.JPG|thumb|Tram in Ulm]]
Ulm is situated at the crossroads of the [[Bundesautobahn 8|A8 motorway]] (connecting the principal cities of southern Germany, [[Stuttgart]] and [[Munich]]), and the [[Bundesautobahn 7|A7 motorway]] (one of the motorways running from northern to southern Europe).

[[Ulm Hauptbahnhof|The city's railway station]] is served, among other lines, by one of the European train routes ([[Paris]] – [[Strasbourg]] – [[Stuttgart]] – Ulm – [[Munich]] – [[Vienna]] – [[Budapest]]). Direct connections to [[Berlin]] are also available.

Ulm's public transport system is based on several bus lines and a tram line. Construction of a second tram line started in 2015. Several streets in the old town are for the use of pedestrians and cyclists only. Ulm was the first area to be served by the [[Daimler AG]]'s [[Car2Go]] [[carsharing]] service in 2008. However, the service in Ulm was discontinued at the end of 2014.

== Education and culture ==
[[File:Ulm public library above.jpg|thumb|The Ulm Public Library]]
The [[University of Ulm]] was founded in 1967 and focuses on the sciences, medicine, engineering, and mathematics / economics. With about 10,000 students, it is one of the smaller universities in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The University of Ulm | url = http://www.uni-ulm.de/en/universitaet.html | accessdate = 2011-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ulm is also the seat of the city's [[Fachhochschule|University of Applied Sciences]] ({{lang-de|Fachhochschule}}), founded in 1960 as a public school of engineering. The school also houses numerous students from around the world as part of an international study abroad programme.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

In 1953, [[Inge Scholl|Inge Aicher-Scholl]], [[Otl Aicher]] and [[Max Bill]] founded the [[Ulm School of Design]] (German: Hochschule für Gestaltung - HfG Ulm), a design school in the tradition of the [[Bauhaus]], which was, however, closed in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = HfG-Archiv Ulm - History | publisher = HfG-Archiv Ulm | year = 2003 | url = http://www.hfg-archiv.ulm.de/english/the_hfg_ulm/history.html | accessdate = 2011-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ulm's public library features over 480,000 print media. The city has a public theatre with drama, opera and ballet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Theatre Ulm | url = http://www.tourismus.ulm.de/tourismus/en/erlebenswert/theater_und_buehnen/theater_ulm/theater_ulm.php | accessdate = 2011-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; several small theatres,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Theatres &amp; Stages | url = http://www.tourismus.ulm.de/tourismus/en/erlebenswert/theater_und_buehnen/theater_und_buehnen.php | accessdate = 2011-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a professional philharmonic orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Theater Ulm - Konzerte | url = http://theater.ulm.de/content/section/5/26/ | accessdate = 2011-03-09 | language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''veteran''' (from [[Latin]] ''vetus'', meaning "old")&lt;ref&gt;Veteran [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/veteran Merriam Webster Dictionary] Accessed March 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; is a person who has had long service or experience in a particular occupation or field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/veteran|title=Veteran - Define Veteran at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A '''military veteran''' is a person who has served and is no longer serving in the [[armed forces]]. Those veterans that have had direct exposure to acts of military conflict may also be referred to as [[war]] veterans (although not all military conflicts, or areas in which armed combat takes place, are necessarily referred to as wars).  A '''combat veteran''' is a person who has fought in combat during a war or a skirmish against a declared enemy and may still be serving in the military.

==Public attitude towards veterans==

Military veterans often receive special treatment in their respective countries due to the sacrifices they made during wars. Different countries handle this differently: some openly support veterans through government programs, while others ignore them. Veterans are also subject to illnesses directly related to their military service such as [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD).  War veterans are generally treated with great respect and honour for their contribution to the world and country by their own nationals. Conversely there are often negative feelings towards the veterans of foreign nations held long after the war is over; for example towards the German Nazi soldiers, yet they are no less veterans of war than those of the winning side. There are exceptions. Veterans of unpopular or lost conflicts may be discriminated against. Veterans of short or small conflicts are often forgotten when the country fought bigger conflicts. In some countries with strong anti-military traditions (e.g., Germany after 1945), veterans are neither honoured in any special way by the general public, nor have their dedicated [[Veterans Day]], although events are sometimes orchestrated by minority groups.

Many countries have longstanding traditions, ceremonies, and holidays to honour their veterans. In the UK, "Remembrance Day" is held on November the 11th and is focused mostly on the veterans who died in service to the monarch and country. A red or [[white poppy]] is worn on the lapel (for remembrance or for peace, respectively) in the weeks up to the date, and wreaths and flowers laid at memorials to the dead.

In Russia, a tradition was established after [[World War II]] where newly married couples would on their wedding day visit a [[military cemetery]]. In France, for instance, those wounded in war are given the first claim on any seat on [[public transit]].  Most countries have a holiday such as Veterans Day to honour their veterans, along with the [[War memorial|war dead]].

In Zimbabwe, the term veteran is used for political purpose and may not actually refer to someone that participated in a war, but still feels entitled to some benefit because of association with a cause for which there had been an actual war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afraf.oxfordjournals.org/content/101/402/9.short|title=The Politics of Disruption: War Veterans and the Local State In Zimbabwe|publisher=|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Veterans' experiences around the world==
===Britain===
{{see also|Service Personnel and Veterans Agency}}
Britain, with its historic distrust of standing armies, did little for its veterans before the 19th century.  It did set up two small hospitals for them in the 1680s. In London and other cities the streets teemed with disabled or disfigured veterans begging for alms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brumwell | first1 = Stephen | year = 2002 | title = Home from the Wars | url = | journal = History Today | volume = 52 | issue = 3| pages = 41–46 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The First World War focused national attention on veterans, especially those who had been partly or wholly disabled.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Cohen, ''War Come Home: Disabled Veterans in Britain &amp; Germany, 1919-1939'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;  The King's National Roll Scheme (KNRS) was an employment program for disabled veterans of the First World War. Kowalsky says it was practical, innovative, and ahead of its time and was the most important piece of legislation enacted for disabled veterans in interwar Britain. In addition to direct aid, it stimulated a national discussion regarding the need for employment programs for disabled veterans and the responsibility of the state, setting up a future demand for more benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kowalsky | first1 = Meaghan | year = 2007 | title = 'This Honourable Obligation': The King's National Roll Scheme for Disabled Ex-Servicemen 1915-1944 | url = | journal = European Review of History | volume = 14 | issue = 4| pages = 567–584 | doi=10.1080/13507480701752201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, Britain has one of the highest densities of veterans in a major country, with 13 million in 2000, or 219 per 1,000 population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dandeker | first1 = Christopher | display-authors = etal   | year = 2006 | title = What's in a Name? Defining and Caring for 'Veterans,' | url = | journal = Armed Forces &amp; Society | volume = 32 | issue = 2| pages = 161–177 | doi=10.1177/0095327x05279177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Congo===
{{main|Belgian Congo#1908-1950s|l1= Belgian Congo in WWII}}
Some veterans from the Belgian commitment of the Congolese to WWII live in communities throughout the Congo.&lt;ref name = "WP"&gt;{{cite news| author= McCrummen, Stephanie| title = Nearly Forgotten Forces of WWII| agency = Washington Post Foreign Service |date=4 August 2009|work = Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though they received compensation from the government during the rule of the dictator [[Mobutu Sese Seko]], after his overthrow they no longer receive pensions.&lt;ref name ="WP"/&gt;

===United States===

[[File:USS Missouri veterans.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Veterans who served on the battleship ''[[USS Missouri (BB-63)|Missouri]]'' shortly after a ceremony marking the anniversary of the end of World War II.]]
The most common usage is for former [[United States Armed Forces#Personnel|armed services personnel]]. A veteran is one who has served in the armed forces, especially one who has served in combat. The National Guard and Reserve is included. It is especially applied to those who served for an entire career, usually of 20 years or more, but may be applied for someone who has only served one [[tour of duty]]. A common misconception is that only those who have served in combat or those who have retired from active duty can be called military veterans. 

In 1990, 40% of young Americans had a veteran for a parent; this decreased to 16% in 2014.&lt;ref name=“veconomist1” &gt;{{cite news|author=|title=America’s love affair with uniformed men is problematic|url=https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21730738-it-also-leads-lot-fuzzy-thinking-about-armed-forces-americas-love-affair|work=[[The Economist]]|date=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, of the veterans who were born outside of the United States, [[Mexican Americans|Mexican]] and [[Filipino Americans]] made up the two largest populations, with 3% of all veterans having been born outside of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zong |first1=Jie |last2=Batalova |first2=Jeanne |date=13 October 2016 |title=Immigrant Veterans in the United States |url=https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/immigrant-veterans-united-states#CountryOfBirth |journal=Migration Information Source |publisher=Migration Policy Institute  |access-date=9 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017 there are some 21 million American veterans.&lt;ref name=“veconomist” &gt;{{cite news|author=C.K.|title=The rhetorical power of “support our troops”|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2017/10/patriotism-and-protest|work=[[The Economist]]|date=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Veterans' benefits in the United States====
President [[Abraham Lincoln]], in his [[Lincoln's second inaugural address|second inaugural address]] in 1865 towards the end of the [[American Civil War]], famously called for good treatment of veterans: "[T]o care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan". The American Civil War produced veterans' organizations, such as the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] and [[United Confederate Veterans]]. The treatment of veterans changed after the [[World War I|First World War]].  In the years following, discontented veterans became a source of instability. They could quickly organize, had links to the army and often had arms themselves. The [[Bonus Army]] of unemployed veterans was one of the most important protest movements of the [[Great Depression]], marching on Washington, D.C. to get a claimed bonus now that Congress had promised them decades in the future.

Each state of the United States sets specific criteria for state-specific veterans' benefits. For federal medical benefits from the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA) hospitals, prior to 7 September 1980 the veteran must have served at least 180 days of active duty, after the above-mentioned date the veteran must have served at least 24 months. However, if the veteran was medically discharged and receives a VA service-connected disability stipend, the time limits are not applicable.

====American veteran experience after World War II====
[[File:Memorial Day 2013 – San Francisco National Cemetery – 06.jpg|thumb|upright|World War II Veteran on Memorial Day 2013 at the [[San Francisco National Cemetery]].]]
After the Second World War, in part due to the experience of the First World War, most of the participating states set up elaborate veterans' administrations. Within the United States, it was veterans groups, like the [[American Legion]] and [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]] organization, that pushed for and got the [[G.I. Bill]] enacted. These gave veterans access to free or subsidized education and health care. The newly educated GIs created a significant economic impact, and with the aid of VA loans were able to buy housing and establish themselves as part of a growing American middle class.  The explosion of the [[suburbs]] created sufficient housing for veterans and their families.

====American veteran experience after OEF and OIF====
Many veterans of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] and [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] have had to face challenges unique to warfare in the 21st century. One significant difference between OEF and OIF and previous wars is a greater dependence on reservists and repeat deployments. Up to 80% of troops deployed at the beginning of OEF were part of the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] and [[Reserve components of the United States Armed Forces|Reserve]]&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Jaine, Kenneth Reich. "Citizen Soldiers Changed Forever: The Impact of OEF/OIF on Reserve and National Guard Troops and their Families" SOFAR USA&lt;/ref&gt; and about 40% of currently serving military members have been deployed more than once.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Returning Home from Iraq and Afghanistan: Preliminary Assessment of Readjustment Needs of Veterans, Service Members, and Their Families" Washington, D.C: National Academies Press, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This has meant that many deployed troops, not being as “ steeped in military culture ”&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, MJ. "Veterans' Mental Health in the Wake of War." ''The New England Journal of Medicine'', v352 n13 (2005): 1287-90&lt;/ref&gt; have had more difficult transitions into military life, and for many the increased redeployment rate has meant more transitions, more uncertainty, longer terms, and shorter dwell times, all of which contribute to greater stress.

Due to medical advances, warfare in the 21st century tends to yield more survivors with severe injuries which soldiers in previous wars would have died from.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This means that, though fewer service members die, more return from war with injuries more serious, and in turn more emotionally devastating, than ever before. Among these injuries is the increasingly common [[traumatic brain injury]], or TBI, the effects of which can range from a mild concussion to amnesia and serious neurological damage.&lt;ref&gt;Bass, Elizabeth, and Heidi Golding "The Veterans Health Administration's Treatment of PTSD and Traumatic Brain Injury Among Recent Combat Veterans" Washington, DC: Congress of the United States, Congressional Budget Office, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

====Female veterans in the U.S.====
{{see also|History of women in the military}}
Women have served in the United States military for over two hundred years. Some female veterans perceive themselves as discriminated against by their male counterparts and, as such, women who have served in the armed forces have sometimes been known as "the invisible veterans".&lt;ref&gt;[[June A. Willenz|Willenz, June A.]] (1994): "Invisible Veterans" ''Educational Record'', v75 n4 p40-46, American Council on Education&lt;/ref&gt; Women were not fully recognized as veterans until after WWII, and prior to this they were not eligible for VA benefits. The current percentage of U.S. Veterans who are women is more than 8 percent. Women make up nearly 11.6 percent of OEF/OIF/OND Veterans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.womenshealth.va.gov/WOMENSHEALTH/facts.asp&lt;/ref&gt; A tri-state (Washington, Idaho, Oregon) women veterans conference in [[Pendleton, Oregon]], in April 2008, attracted 362 women veterans, according to the ''[[East Oregonian]]'' newspaper.

On August 5, 2011, Erica Borggren was appointed Director of the [[Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs]] and has been "creating a new Women Veterans Program to help address the issue that women veterans often do not self-identify as veterans and do not take advantage of veterans’ benefits to the same extent as their male peers."&lt;ref name=webcast&gt;[http://www.pritzkermilitarylibrary.org/Home/change-and-challenges.aspx "Citizen Soldier: Change and Challenges--Women in Today's Military"] Pritzker Military Library Webcast January 24, 2013 Chicago, IL&lt;/ref&gt;  She gathered in a webcast panel moderated by Stacey Baca with Dr. Rebecca J. Hannagan and Kimberly Mitchell at the [[Pritzker Military Library]] on January 24, 2013, to discuss important issues facing female veterans in today's military.&lt;ref name=webcast /&gt;

====African American veterans in the U.S.====
{{see also|Military history of African Americans}}
African Americans have participated in every war fought by or within the United States. Black veterans from [[World War I]] experienced racial persecution on returning to the U.S. from overseas, particularly in Southern cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mailer.fsu.edu/~mjones/rosewood/rosewood.html Maxine D. Rogers, ''et al.'', ''Documented History of Rosewood, Florida in January 1923'', ''op.cit., pp.4-6] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515152951/http://mailer.fsu.edu/~mjones/rosewood/rosewood.html |date=May 15, 2008 }}, accessed March 28, 2008; [[Clarence Lusane]] (2003), ''Hitler's Black Victims'', p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Black veterans from [[World War II]] continued to be denied equality at home despite President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s desegregation of the military after World War II. Black veterans went on to play a central role in the [[civil rights movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s. The [[National Association for Black Veterans]] is an organization that provides advocacy and support for African American and other minority veterans.

==Health effects of military service and treatment for veterans==
The effect of active military service can be profound and lasting, and some veterans have found it difficult to adjust to normal life again. Figures from 2009 showed that twice as many veterans were in prison than there were British troops currently in Afghanistan. Homelessness, street-sleeping and relationship breakdown are also commonly reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Risk Factors for Homelessness Among US Veterans|url = http://epirev.oxfordjournals.org/content/37/1/177|journal = Epidemiologic Reviews|date = 2015-01-01|issn = 0193-936X|pmc = 4521393|pmid = 25595171|pages = 177–195|volume = 37|issue = 1|doi = 10.1093/epirev/mxu004|first = Jack|last = Tsai|first2 = Robert A.|last2 = Rosenheck}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Role of Coping, Resilience, and Social Support in Mediating the Relation Between PTSD and Social Functioning in Veterans Returning from Iraq and Afghanistan|url = http://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/psyc.2012.75.2.135|journal = Psychiatry: Interpersonal and Biological Processes|date = 2012-05-29|issn = 0033-2747|pages = 135–149|volume = 75|issue = 2|doi = 10.1521/psyc.2012.75.2.135|first = Jack|last = Tsai|first2 = Ilan|last2 = Harpaz-Rotem|first3 = Robert H.|last3 = Pietrzak|first4 = Steven M.|last4 = Southwick}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research done by the UK homelessness charity CRISIS (1994) and the Ex-Services Action Group (1997) both found that a quarter of homeless people had previously served in the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.veterans-uk.info/homelessness/ex_serv.html Veterans-uk.info]&lt;/ref&gt; The Times newspaper reported on 25 September 2009 that in England and Wales the number of "military veterans in jail has more than doubled in six years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article6848238.ece|title=Login|publisher=|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Times article of the same date quoted the veterans mental health charity Combat Stress&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.combatstress.org.uk/|title=The Veterans' mental health charity - Combat Stress - Combat Stress|publisher=|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; reporting a 53% increase in referrals from doctors.

===Suicide===
{{distinguish redirect|Suicide in the military|Military suicide attack}}
{{further|United States military veteran suicide}}
An article in the London Metro on 28 January 2010 was titled "Veterans prone to suicide" and cited a report by the Mental Health Foundation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/media/news-releases/news-releases-2010/28-january-2010/|title=Archived copy|access-date=2010-02-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301055831/http://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/media/news-releases/news-releases-2010/28-january-2010/|archive-date=2010-03-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which said that not enough was being done to care for the Afghanistan war veterans, and many "plunged into alcohol problems, crime and suicide" upon their return. Indeed, in the U.S., the suicide rate among veterans is 300% the national average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jaffe|first=Greg|title=VA study finds more veterans committing suicide|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-02-01/national/36669331_1_afghanistan-war-veterans-suicide-rate-suicide-risk|newspaper=Washington Post|date=February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They account for 30% of the suicides in the US annually.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Support services were found to be patchy from area to area.

===Posttraumatic Stress Disorder===
{{further|Posttraumatic Stress Disorder|Benefits for US Veterans with PTSD}}
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a condition that affects a significant number of veterans. Studies involving veterans with combat-related PTSD indicate that between 4-17% of United States veterans have been diagnosed with PTSD. There United Kingdom counterparts however, have significantly lower number of just 3-6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Prevalence Estimates of Combat-Related PTSD: A Critical Review|date =January 2010 |journal = Australian &amp; New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry|last = Richardson|first = Lisa K.|last2 = Frueh|first2 = B. Christopher|last3 = Acierno|first3 = Ronald|pmc=2891773|pmid=20073563|doi=10.3109/00048670903393597|volume=44|issue=1|pages=4–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New treatment programs are emerging to assist veterans suffering from post-combat mental health problems such as [[major depressive disorder|depression]] and PTSD. [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy]] (CBT), is becoming an important method for the treatment of mental health issues among veterans, and is currently considered the standard of care for depression and PTSD by the [[United States Department of Defense]]. CBT is a psychotherapeutic approach that aims to change the patterns of thinking or behavior that responsible for patient’s negative emotions and in doing so change the way they feel. It has been proven to be an effective treatment for PTSD among war veterans. Recently, online programs that pair CBT with therapist interaction have also proven effective in treating mental health problems among veterans. [[Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing]] (EMDR) is also an effective and noninvasive, drug-free treatment for PTSD, although it has not been tested against specific military traumatic exposure for efficacy.{{Citation needed|reason=Source needed for entire paragraph.|date=March 2016}}

Veterans under the age of 25 are at higher risk for PTSD than veterans older than 25. Younger veterans with severe PTSD are at higher risk for [[metabolic syndrome]] and [[suicide]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/781380_3|title = Mission Critical: Getting Vets With PTSD Back to Work|date = March 29, 2013|accessdate = |website = NIOSH: Workplace Safety and Health|publisher = Medscape and NIOSH|last = Meade|first = Barbara J.|last2 = Glenn|first2 = Margaret K.|last3 = Wirth|first3 = Oliver}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music therapy provides veterans with a way to express themselves, escape from anxiety, and helps them cope with their PTSD. In Marty Steiner’s “Music and Science Meet…Music Therapy”, Steiner explains “Modern music therapy became a norm in the Veteran's Administration hospitals during and after both World Wars. In its most basic form the playing of recordings on the Victrola in WW I, hospitals had measurable positive effects on the wounded and shell-shocked patients. This began the use of a somewhat primitive music therapy in all American military hospitals.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steiner|first=Marty|date=25 April 2018|title="Music and Science Meet...Music Therapy."|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other disorders===
Veterans are at higher risk than the general population for several disorders, especially younger veterans (those younger than 25). Younger veterans are at increased risk for drug use disorders, alcohol abuse disorders, and mental illnesses in general.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Help for veterans===
[[File:Cover-of-book-for-WWI-veterans-by-William-Brown-Meloney-born-1878.jpg|thumb|upright|Book given to U.S. veterans in 1919 to help them readjust to civilian life.]]
Necessity has resulted in a number of sources of help being made available for veterans. Many of these are independent, charitable organisations, and in some countries the aftercare and rehabilitation services provided by Governments have been inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Durboraw  | first = Al  | title = Combat veterans rights : to the Department of Veterans Affairs, benefits, medical services, compensation, appeals, etc.  | publisher = Dorrance Publishing Co.  | year = 2010  | location = Pittsburgh, PA  | isbn = 978-1-4349-0409-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be because they do not wish to give attention to the negative effects of military service and the difficulties of readjustment to civilian life for it may have an adverse impact upon recruitment for their armed forces. Nevertheless, help is available and veterans should feel able to make contact and ask for assistance or advice to the broad network of [[Center for American Homeless Veterans|organizations]], and to appropriate [[United States Congress|legislators]], without feeling that this is a weakness. Military service can be a profoundly unnatural experience and it is likely that some help may be needed in debriefing and rehabilitation into the community, whether it be medical, psychological, practical or financial. There were an estimated [[Homeless veterans in the United States|57849 homeless veterans estimated in the United States]] during January 2013; or 12 percent of all homeless adults. Just under 8 percent of homeless U.S. veterans are female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.onecpd.info/resources/documents/ahar-2013-part1.pdf|title=The 2013 Annual Homeless Assessment report (AHAR) to Congress|publisher=The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean Victor Duruy''' (11 September 1811 – 25 November 1894) was a French historian and statesman.

==Biography==
Duruy was born in Paris, the son of a factory worker, and at first intended for his father's trade. Having passed brilliantly through the [[École Normale Supérieure]], where he studied under [[Jules Michelet]], he accompanied Michelet as secretary in his travels through France, supplying for him at the École Normale in 1836, when only twenty-four. Ill-health forced him to resign, and poverty caused him to undertake an extensive series of school textbooks which made him well known.

He devoted himself to secondary school education, holding his chair in the [[College Henri IV]] at Paris for over a quarter of a century. Already known as a historian by his ''Histoire des Romains et des peuples soumis à leur domination'' (7 vols, 1843–1844), he was chosen by [[Napoleon III]] to assist him in his biography of [[Julius Caesar]], and his abilities being thus brought under the emperor's notice, he was in 1863 appointed minister of education. In this position he worked incessantly, attempting broad and liberal reforms. On 18 March 1864, Duruy visited the [[Brothers of the Christian Schools|Christian Brothers]]' boarding school in [[Passy]] (the ''[[Pensionnat des Frères des écoles chrétiennes à Passy]]'') and complimented the Brothers "in the most flattering terms upon the appearance and tendency of the pensionnat".&lt;ref name="Annual report"&gt;''Annual Report of the Commissioner of Education''.&lt;/ref&gt; Another ministerial visit took place on 12 May of the same year,
&lt;blockquote&gt;caused by the resistance to the projet de loi for special instruction{{efn|The law would be enacted on 21 June 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Prévot, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;}} which was manifested in the parliamentary commission which had been appointed to examine the subject. To overcome this opposition M. Duruy invited the members of the commission to accompany him to Passy, in order to demonstrate to them, as he expressed it, the successful realization of his project by the Christian Brothers.&lt;ref name="Annual report"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ironically, despite open domestic opposition to his views in education, he was instrumental in the reformation of [[Galatasaray High School]] in 1868, in strict concordance with his secular views, as the first Western-style state higher education institution in the [[Ottoman Empire]].

Among his measures were the reorganization of higher education (''enseignement spécial''), the foundation of the ''conférences publiques'', which became universal throughout France, and of a course of secondary education for girls by lay teachers. He introduced modern history and modern languages into the curriculum both of the ''lycées'' and of the colleges. He greatly improved the state of primary education in France, and proposed to make it compulsory and free of charge, but failed to obtain the emperor's support for this move. In the new cabinet that followed the elections of 1869, Duruy was replaced by [[Louis Olivier Bourbeau]], and was made a senator. After the fall of the Empire he took no part in politics, except for an unsuccessful candidacy for the senate in 1876. From 1881 to 1886 he served as a member of the ''Conseil Supérieur de l'Instruction Publique''. In 1884 he was elected to the ''[[Académie française]]'' in succession to [[François Mignet]].

==Writings==
[[File:History of Rome and the Roman people, from its origin to the establishment of the Christian empire (1884) (14764888105).jpg|thumb|Plate from ''History of Rome and the Roman people'', Duruy 1884]]
As an historian Duruy aimed in his earlier works at a graphic and picturesque narrative which should make his subject popular. His fame, however, rests mainly on the revised edition of his Roman history, which appeared in a greatly enlarged form in 5 vols. under the title of ''Histoire des Romains depuis les temps les plus reculés jusqu'à la mort de Théodose'' (1879–1885), an illustrated edition was published from 1879 to 1885 (English translation by WJ Clarke, in 6 vols., 1883–1886). His ''Histoire des Grecs'', similarly illustrated, appeared in 3 volumes from 1886 to 1891 (English translation in 4 volumes, 1892). He was the editor, from its commencement in 1846, of the ''Histoire universelle, publiée par une société de professeurs et de savants'', for which he himself wrote a "Histoire sainte d'après la Bible," "Histoire grecque," "Histoire romaine," "Histoire du moyen âge," "Histoire des temps modernes," and "Abrégé de l'histoire de France."

His other works include ''Atlas historique de la France accompagné d'un volume de texte'' (1849); ''Histoire de France de 1453 à 1815'' (1856), of which an expanded and illustrated edition appeared as ''Histoire de France depuis l'invasion des Barbares dans la Gaule romaine jusqu'à nos jours'' (1892); ''Histoire populaire de la France'' (1862–1863); ''Histoire populaire contemporaine de la France'' (1864–1866); ''Causeries de voyage: de Paris à Vienne'' (1864); and ''Introduction générale à l'histoire de France'' (1865).

A memoir by [[Ernest Lavisse]] appeared in 1895 under the title of ''Un Ministre: Victor Duruy''. See also the notice by [[Jules Simon]] (1895), and ''Portraits et souvenirs'' by [[Gabriel Monod]] (1897).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8705">[[File:Ancient Levant routes1.png|thumb|Way of the Patriarchs (blue) with Via Maris (purple) and King's Highway (red)]]
'''Way of the Patriarchs'''&amp;nbsp; ({{lang-he|דֶּרֶךְ הֲאָבוֹת}}&amp;nbsp; ''Derech haʾAvot''&amp;nbsp; &lt;small&gt;Lit. ''Way (of) the Fathers&lt;/small&gt;''), is an ancient north south route traversing the [[land of Israel]].&lt;ref name="bibarch1" /&gt; The name is used by biblical scholars because of mentions in biblical narratives that it was frequently travelled by [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]].&lt;ref name="eerdmans1" /&gt;

It is also called the '''Hill Road''' or the '''Ridge Route'''&lt;ref name="roadhome1" /&gt; because it follows the watershed ridge line of the [[Samaria]]n and [[Judea|Judaean Mountains]].  It runs from [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]] and [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]] south to [[Beersheba]] by way of [[Shechem]],&lt;ref name="jvl1" /&gt; [[Bethel]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Ephrath]] and [[Hebron]]. Unlike the [[Via Maris]] and the [[King's Highway (ancient)|King's Highway]] which were international roads crossing the territories of many peoples, the Ridge Route was wholly within the territory of ancient Israel.

In modern times, the route roughly follows the original [[Highway 60 (Israel)|Highway 60]]&lt;ref name="roadhome1" /&gt; (without the more recent [[Highway 60 (Israel)#Bypass roads|bypasses]]), passing through [[Afula]], [[Jenin]], [[Nablus]], [[Ramallah]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Bethlehem]], [[Halhul]], [[Hebron]] and [[ad-Dhahiriya|Dhahiriya]].

We already find Abraham using this route. After he enters the land he goes to Shechem.  Then via [[Beit El|Beth El]] he ends up in Hebron and later in [[Beersheba|Beer-Sheva]].

Way stations were discovered along the route between Beersheba and Jerusalem from the time of the ancient Temple and later during the Hellenistic and Roman eras.  Ritual baths ([[Mikveh|Mikvaot]], Hebrew: מקוואות) served pilgrims during their journey.&lt;ref name="aihv1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="atiqot1" /&gt;

===Milestones===
Milestones have been discovered along the route signalling that, even in Roman times, the route was used as a major road.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}  The stones represent the distance to Jerusalem.

===The Maccabees in Gush Etzion===
The Way of the Patriarchs can be seen in [[Battle of Beth Zechariah|Beit Zechariah]] (today a small Arab village) where a battle took place between [[Judas Maccabeus|Yehuda Maccabee]] and the Greeks.  It was there that Judah's brother, [[Eleazar Avaran|Elazar HaHorani]], was killed after stabbing and killing one of the Greek elephants.  This incident is commemorated by the name of the adjacent community, [[Elazar, Gush Etzion|Elazar]].

===In Jerusalem===
The biblical story of the [[Battle of Gibeah|Concubine of the Hill]] ([[Book of Judges|Judges]] 19), tells of a small family caravan journeying on the ridge route from Bethlehem towards Jerusalem.

Ancient Jerusalem (today's Old City) was not sitiuated on the mountain watershed. Indeed, The Ridge Route did not pass directly through the ancient city but was situated just to the west, about a 20-minute walk from the city walls.  The route from Bethel southwards would have passed through today's neighborhoods of [[Beit Hanina]], [[Shuafat]], [[French Hill]], [[Givat HaMivtar]] and [[Kerem Avraham]], crossing [[Jaffa Road]] at the center of modern down-town Jerusalem behind the [[Hamashbir Lazarchan|HaMashbir Department Store]] building, and continuing along Shmuel HaNagid St. (peak height: Monastery of Ratisbon), [[King George Street (Jerusalem)|King George St.]], Keren HaYesod St., and finally the [[Hebron Road]] to Bethlehem

==East-West connections==
[[File:Ancient Levant routes7.png|thumb|right|Roads across the Way of the Patriarchs (blue):&lt;br/&gt;1–Sunset Road&lt;br/&gt;2–Red Ascent&lt;br/&gt;3–Aphek Ascent&lt;br/&gt;4–Beit Horon Ascent&lt;br/&gt;5–Ayalon Road&lt;br/&gt;6–Lachish Road]]
The route connected to the Via Maris and the Kings Highway by way of several east-west roads:

An important connection was "The Sunset Road" ({{lang-he|דֶּרֶךְ מְבוֹא הַשֶּמֶש}} ''Derech Mevo HaShemesh'') ({{Bibleverse||Deut|11:29-30|HE}}) leading from The King's Highway, crossing the Jordan River at the location of today's [[Damia Bridge|Adam Bridge]] (Jisr Damiat) and ascending through the Tirtza Valley (Wadi Al Fara) to [[Mount Gerizim]] and [[Shechem]].  Today's eastern leg of [[Highway 57 (Israel)|Route 57]] roughly follows the ancient track.

The "Red Ascent" ({{lang-he|מַעֲלֵה אֲדֻמִּים}} ''[[Ma'ale Adumim]]'') ({{Bibleverse||Joshua|15:7|HE}} and {{Bibleverse||Joshua|18:17|HE}}) formed a boundary of the tribe of [[Tribe of Judah|Judah]] ''ascending from the Valley of [[Achor]] to [[Debir]] and turning north to [[Gilgal]]''.  It takes its name from the red rock lining the ascent.  [[Highway 1 (Israel)|Highway 1]] between Jerusalem and the Jordan Valley follows the ancient route.

To the west of Shechem, the ancient "[[Antipatris|Aphek]] Ascent" from the Via Maris and the coastal plain passed through Aphek, Soco and today's [[Kfar Saba]] and [[Qalqilyah]].  [[Highway 55 (Israel)|Highway 55]] duplicates the eastern part of this route.

"The [[Bethoron]] Ascent" ({{lang-he|מַעֲלֵה בֵּית חוֹרוֹן}} ''Ma'ale Beit Horon'') ({{Bibleverse||Josh|10:10|HE}}) from the coastal plain passes today's Ben Gurion Airport, then rose along an offshoot of the watershed ridge leading to today's [[Beit Hanina]] as it approached Jerusalem.  Today's [[Route 443 (Israel)|Route 443]] follows the ancient road with minor deviations.

The ascent from Jaffa to Jerusalem through the [[Ajalon|Plain of Ayalon]] is now duplicated by Route 412, [[Highway 44 (Israel)|Highway 44]] and [[Highway 1 (Israel)|Route 1]].

Further south, [[Highway 35 (Israel)|Highway 35]] roughly follows the path of the ancient "[[Lachish]] Road" from Gaza, Ashkelon and Ashdod through the Lachish region to Hebron.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5669">'''West Germanic gemination''' was a sound change that took place in all [[West Germanic languages]] around the 3rd or 4th century AD. It affected consonants directly followed by {{IPA|/j/}}, which were generally lengthened or geminated in that position. Because of [[Sievers' law]], only consonants immediately after a short vowel were affected by the process.

==Overview==
When followed by {{IPA|/j/}}, consonants were lengthened (doubled). The consonant {{IPA|/r/}}, whether original or from earlier {{IPA|/z/}} through rhotacization, was generally not affected; it occasionally shows gemination in [[Old High German]], but inconsistently and this may be an analogical change. In contrast, the second element of the diphthongs ''iu'' and ''au'' was still underlyingly the consonant {{IPA|/w/}} at this time, and therefore was lengthened as well.

In Proto-Germanic, {{IPA|/j/}} only appeared at the beginning of a syllable, primarily as the onset of a variety of suffixes and endings. It alternated with its syllabic counterpart {{IPA|/ij/}} in accordance with a phonological rule known as [[Sievers' law]]. This law states that consonantal {{IPA|/j/}} appeared after a "light" syllable: one that contained a short vowel followed by at most one consonant. The syllabic allomorph {{IPA|/ij/}} appeared after "heavy" syllables, which included syllables containing a long vowel, a diphthong, or ending in more than one consonant. As the gemination itself required the consonant to be directly followed by {{IPA|/j/}}, it therefore affected only light syllables; heavy syllables were not changed. Compare, for example, the Germanic verbs ''*fūlijaną'' "to defile" and ''*fuljaną'' "to fill, to make full", which appear in Old English as ''fȳlan'' and ''fyllan'' respectively, and in Old High German as ''fūlen'' and ''fullen''; the first verb shows no gemination, while the second does.

In the early history of most individual Germanic languages, syllabic {{IPA|/ij/}} was generally lost, while consonantal {{IPA|/j/}} was retained. Earlier consonantal {{IPA|/j/}} is also lost, however, after a consonant that underwent gemination. Thus, {{IPA|/j/}} remains only after {{IPA|/r/}} (Old English ''werian'' &lt; Proto-Germanic ''*warjaną''), while {{IPA|/ij/}} appears in all other cases, even those where Proto-Germanic had {{IPA|/j/}} (such as ''*fuljaną'' above). It therefore appears that Sievers' law was still productive at this stage, and adapted to the new syllable length by changing the suffix from its consonantal to its syllabic variety.

==Gemination triggered by /l/, /r/==
West Germanic gemination also operated inconsistently on consonants followed by /l/ or /r/, e.g. Old English ''æppel'' "apple" &lt; Proto-Germanic *aplaz. In some cases this led to doublets, e.g. [[West Saxon dialect (Old English)|West Saxon Old English]] ''tēar'' "tear (of the eyes)" &lt; *tæher &lt; Proto-Germanic *tahraz (without gemination) vs. [[Northumbrian dialect|Northumbrian Old English]] ''tæhher'' "tear (of the eyes)" (with gemination).

==Parallel changes in Old Norse==

Similar changes occurred in the history of [[Old Norse]], although with a more limited scope. The change applied only to the combinations {{IPA|/kj/}} and {{IPA|/ɡj/}}, which were lengthened to {{IPA|/kːj/}} and {{IPA|/ɡːj/}}. Other consonants were not affected. Contrary to the changes in West Germanic, the {{IPA|/j/}} remained nonsyllabic after the change, and was therefore retained rather than lost like syllabic {{IPA|/ij/}} was in other Old Norse words.

==Effects==

This change particularly affected the infinitives of the first conjugation of [[Germanic weak verb|weak verbs]], which ended in *-(i)janą. It also affect the short-stemmed ja(n)- and jō(n)-stem nouns and adjectives. By historical times (c. 800-900 AD), all of the West Germanic languages except [[Old Saxon]] had lost medial syllabic {{IPA|/ij/}}, but not before any {{IPA|/j/}} that it may have developed from had triggered [[Germanic umlaut|i-Mutation]]. It also triggered [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] of velar consonants in [[Old English language|Old English]] and [[Old Frisian]]: {{IPA|/kj/}} and {{IPA|/gj/}} were geminated into palatal/postalveolar {{IPA|/cː(ij)/}} and {{IPA|/ɟː(ij)/}}, which then developed into geminate affricates {{IPA|/tːʃ/}} and {{IPA|/dːʒ/}}, spelled &lt;cc&gt; and &lt;cg&gt; in Old English.

[[File:Ms digby 133 - 158r - Wisdom.jpg|thumb|right|Opening page of the partial copy of ''Wisdom'' preserved in the [[Bodleian Library]] (MS Digby 133, folio 158r)]]
''' ''Wisdom'' ''' (also known as ''Mind, Will, and Understanding'') is one of the earliest surviving [[medieval]] [[morality play]]s. Together with ''[[Mankind (play)|Mankind]]'' and ''[[The Castle of Perseverance]]'', it forms a collection of early English moralities called "The Macro Plays". ''Wisdom'' enacts the struggle between good and evil; as an allegory, it depicts Christ (personified in the character of Wisdom) and Lucifer battling over the Soul of Man, with Christ and goodness ultimately victorious. Dating between 1460-1463, the play is preserved in its complete form in the [[Macro Manuscript]], currently a part of the collection of the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]] (MS V.a. 354).&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, ''Visualizing the Moral Life''&lt;/ref&gt; A manuscript fragment of the first 754 lines also belongs to the [[Bodleian Library]] (MS Digby 133).&lt;ref&gt;Furnivall, pp. x&lt;/ref&gt; Although the author of ''Wisdom'' remains anonymous, the manuscript was transcribed and signed by a monk named Thomas Hyngman. Some scholars have suggested that Hyngman also authored the play. 
 
==Synopsis==
Unlike other early morality plays, the character signifying man is split into nine different characters: Anima (the soul of man), the three faculties of the soul (Mind, Will and Understanding), and her five senses (known as ‘’the Wits”). Despite boasting a large cast list, the only six speaking roles in the play are Anima, Wisdom, Lucifer, Mind, Will and Understanding. Although the manuscript does not contain scene demarcations, the play can be divided into four sections, based upon a theological schematic of transgression and redemption: innocence, temptation, sinful life, and repentance.&lt;ref&gt;Eccles, ''The Macro Plays''&lt;/ref&gt;  In the first part (Lines 1-324), Anima declares her love for Wisdom, the allegorical figure for Christ. The stage directions note that Anima is dressed in white, a symbol of her purity and position as the bride of Christ. The five Wits enter (dressed as virgins), and dance. Wisdom advises Anima and her three faculties (Will, Mind, Understanding) about how to live virtuously. In the second part (325-550), Lucifer tempts each of the three faculties – Will with lechery, Mind with pride, and Understanding with Perjury. In the third part (551-837), each faculty (having exchanged monkish, acetic robes for more fashionable and luxurious ones) devotes himself to sin and dances wildly with six followers. In the final part (838-1108), Wisdom returns to chastise the three faculties for falling into temptation. Anima, Will, Mind and Understanding repent, and the devils are chased from the stage. Recognizing that redemption requires more than her remorse, Anima asks for God’s mercy and grace. Wisdom grants both, before turning to the audience and ending the play with a sermon on avoiding sin and seeking grace.

==History==
Like ''Mankind'', the [[Macro Manuscript]] version of ''Wisdom'' bears a Latin inscription by the monk Thomas Hyngman and the phrase (translated), “Oh book, if anyone shall perhaps ask to whom you belong, you will say, “I belong above everything to Hyngham, a monk.” &lt;ref&gt;Eccles, pp. xxviii&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities between this hand and the text of the play lead scholars to believe that Hyngman transcribed the play.&lt;ref&gt;Beadle, pp. 318&lt;/ref&gt; Close parallels between the Digby version and Macro version (including congruence of transcription errors).&lt;ref&gt;Rigby, pp. 6-18&lt;/ref&gt;

The particularities of the playtext’s dialect suggest that ''Wisdom'' dates between 1460 and 1470 (Davidson argues for a range between 1460 and 1463).&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, pp. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The language is an East Midland dialect, particularly common to Norfolk and Suffolk at the time of composition.&lt;ref&gt;Eccles, pp. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Although the play conventionally goes by the name ''Wisdom'' today, neither manuscript notes a title.  Former owner Thomas Sharp referred to the play by the title '' "Mind, Will, and Understanding" '' (after the three major characters). The now common moniker '' “Wisdom” '' is shorthand for ''A Morality of Wisdom, who is Christ'', pioneered in an 1882 publication of the plays by the philologist [[Frederick James Furnivall]].&lt;ref&gt;Eccles, pp. xxvii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
Much of the play’s theological material directly quotes the [[Vulgate Bible]], including selections from [[Song of Songs]], [[Psalms]], [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]], [[Malachi]], [[Ecclesiastes]], [[The Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]], [[Ephesians]], and [[Colossians]].&lt;ref&gt;Smart, ''Some English and Latin Sources and Parallels for the Morality of Wisdom''&lt;/ref&gt; The characterization and costuming of Anima as the Bride of Christ come from passages of [[Henry Suso]]’s ''Horologium Sapientiae''.  Lucifer’s arguments to the three faculties in the temptation scene are mutations of 14th century mystic [[Walter Hilton]]’s writings in his ''Epistle on mixed life''. At the play’s conclusion, sections of Anima’s repentance (particularly the language of Mind, Will and Understanding) come again from Hilton, in his major work ''The Scale of Perfection''.&lt;ref&gt;Klausner, ''Two Moral Interludes''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:E V Tarle.jpg|thumb|Yevgeny Viktorovich Tarle]]
'''Yevgeny Viktorovich Tarle''' ({{lang-ru|Евгений Викторович Тарле}}) ({{OldStyleDate|27 October|1874|8 November }} &amp;ndash; 6 January 1955) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] historian and [[academician]] of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. He is known for his books about [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia|invasion of Russia]] and on the [[Crimean War]], and many other works. Yevgeny Tarle was one of the founders of the [[Moscow State Institute of International Relations]], Russia's diplomatic university.

== Life ==
Born as Grigory Tarle in [[Kiev]], [[Russian Empire]] (modern-day [[Ukraine]]) into a prosperous [[Jewish]] family, he adopted the name of Yevgeny in 1893 following his [[baptism]] to [[Orthodox Christianity]] in [[Saint Sophia's Cathedral, Kiev|Saint Sophia's Cathedral]] in order to marry Olga Grigorievna Mikhailova who belonged to [[Russian nobility]]. His father Viktor Grigorievich Tarle came from [[social estates in the Russian Empire|merchantry]] social estate and ran a shop in Kiev; he also translated books from Russian to German, including [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s works. Yevgeny's mother Rozalia Arnoldovna Tarle was a housewife who dedicated herself to raising children. He had four siblings.&lt;ref name='kagan'&gt;''Boris Kaganovich (1995)''. Yevgeny Viktorovich Tarle and St. Petersburg School of Historians. — St. Petersburg, p. 3-13, 45-46 {{ISBN|5-86007-028-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Yevgeny Tarle, Vladlen Sirotkin (1992)''. Talleyran. — Moscow: High School, p. 3 {{ISBN|5-06-002500-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1892 Tarle completed gymnasium in [[Kherson]] and entered the [[Odessa University|Imperial Novorossiya University]] on [[Fyodor Uspensky]]'s recommendation. In a year he moved to the [[University of Kiev]] to study [[history]] and [[philosophy]]. He was “the most distinguished student of [[Ivan Vasilevich Luchitski]] (1845-1918) of the University of Kiev.”  After finishing his undergraduate education in 1896, he continued there as a graduate student in history.

As a student Tarle joined [[Marxist]] clubs and took an active part in the [[social democracy]] movement. He frequently visited Kievan factory workers as a lecturer and agitator. On May 1, 1900 he was arrested during a secret meeting in the middle of [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]]'s speech. Tarle was sent to Kherson under police supervision and was forbidden to teach at Imperial universities and gymnasiums. On August he and his wife were allowed to move to [[Warsaw]] where they spent about a year. During that time he published many articles on history in various magazines. In 1901 he was also allowed a two-day visit to St. Petersburg in order to defend his master’s thesis on [[Thomas More]]. With the support of collegues he was finally given permission to work as a [[privatdozent]] at the [[University of St. Petersburg]] in 1903, a position he held up until 1917.&lt;ref name='kagan' /&gt;

On February 1905 Tarle was arrested again for taking part in student protests and excluded from the university. However, after the [[October Manifesto]] decriminalized Marxists, he managed to return and continued his teaching career.&lt;ref&gt;''Evgeny Chapkevich (1977)''. Yevgeny Victorovich Tarle. — Moscow: [[Nauka (publisher)|Nauka]], p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve his doctoral degree, he completed a two-volume dissertation about France. His interest in France increased in time: he completed another work on the economic history of France in 1916. From 1913 to 1918 he also served as a professor at the [[University of Tartu]].

===Foreign travel===
From 1903 to 1914 Tarle traveled to France on a yearly basis.&lt;ref name='kagan' /&gt; He had done research in the libraries and archives of Western Europe for all his early works, spending a lot of time at the [[Archives Nationales (France)]] in particular. He also contacted many prominent historians and even read a paper at the [[World Congress of Historical Studies]] held in London in 1913. The number of his works prior to the Revolution amounted to 211. His most important publications before the revolution were:

*''Kontinentalnaia blokada v. I: Issledovaniia po istorii promyshelennosti i vneshnei torgovli Frantsii v epokhu Napoleona'' [The Continental Blockade V. I: Studies in the History of French Industry and Trade under Napoleon] in 1913
*''Ekonomicheskaia zhizn korolestva Italii v tsarstvovaniie Napoleona'' [The Economic Situation of Italy during the Napoleonic Era], which was first published in 1916 and in the following years also in French (1928) and in Italian (1950).
*''Pechat’vo Frantsii pri Napoleone'' [The French Press under Napoleon] published in 1913
*Rabochii klass vo Frantsii v epokhu revoliutsii [The French Working Class during the Revolution] (1909–1911)

===Soviet era and exile===
Russian historical scholarship was deeply affected by the [[October Revolution]]. Despite this, Tarle remained at the University of St. Petersburg. From 1918 on he also headed the [[Petrograd]] department of the [[Federal Archival Agency (Russia)|Central Archive of RSFSR]]. He soon became a professor at [[Moscow University]] and moved to Moscow. In 1921 he became a corresponding member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], becoming a full member in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ras.ru/win/db/show_per.asp?P=.id-52322.ln-en.dl-.pr-inf.uk-12 Tarle Yevgenii Viktorovich] at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] website&lt;/ref&gt; He was also active in the [[Russian Association of Scientific Institutes for Research in the Social Sciences]] (RANION). From 1922 to 1924 he published an ''Annually'' journal of general history along with [[Fyodor Uspensky]]. Tarle had achieved distinction as a specialist in modern history through his book ''Europe in the Age of Imperialism''.

During 1928-1931 Tarle was frequently criticized by his colleagues in articles published in ''[[Istorik-Marksist]]'' and in ''[[Borba Klassov]]''. Between 1929 and 1931 a group of prominent historians were arrested by the [[State Political Directorate]] following the so-called [[:ru:Академическое дело|Academic Case]] (also known as The Case of [[Sergey Platonov|Platonov]]). They were accused of hatching a plot to overthrow the Soviet government. In 1930 Tarle was arrested as well, accused of “being an “interventionist” and a “traitor” destined to be the foreign minister in a restored capitalist government". On August 8, 1931 he was exiled to [[Almaty]] where he spent the next four years.&lt;ref name='kagan' /&gt;

===Post-exile===
After Tarle returned from exile in early 1934, he got back to his academic work in Leningrad and wrote two significant works on the Napoleonic period: a biography of Napoleon (''Napoleon'') published in 1936 and ''Napoleon’s Invasion of Russia, 1812'' published in 1938. They were of great importance for estimating the change in Tarle’s interpretation of history. Tarle’s scholarly work during this period is the subject of much controversy. [[A. Roland]], while praising Tarle for being a renowned authority on the Napoleonic era and having clearly understood the epoch of the Napoleonic wars, accuses him of having refracted the impact of the French revolution through the person of Napoleon.

Tarle’s description of the Napoleonic Empire in ''Napoleon'' (1936) had mostly been perceived as a study in the classic Marxist tradition. He had repeated the basic ideas of [[Mikhail Pokrovsky]] on the 1812 campaign and managed to interpret Napoleon from the viewpoint of the class-struggle. Like Pokrovsky, Tarle treated the Russian people’s patriotism and the talents of the Russian commanders as of lesser significance. However, according to Erickson, “Tarle’s interpretation differed from the more rigid economic interpretation of the Pokrovski school.” Unlike Pokrovski, Tarle brought individuals in the foreground. Napoleon was recognized as an influential historical figure.

The [[Battle of Borodino]] was not termed a victory in his work and the resistance to Napoleon was claimed as being “never a popular, national war.” He stated that “there was no mass participation by the peasantry in the guerilla bands and in their activities, and their part in the campaign was strictly limited.”  According to Tarle, “… it is clear that if the Spanish guerilla warfare might justifiably be called a national war, it would be impossible to apply this term to any Russian movement in the war of 1812.”  Tarle supported his interpretation by “denying that the peasants fought against the French and describing the burning of Smolensk and Moscow as systematic acts of the Russian army in retreat.”  Naturally, Tarle also gave references to [[Lenin]]’s words on Napoleon in his book. Tarle’s biography of Napoleon, according to Black, was accepted as “the final word in the analysis of the 1812 campaign” when it was first published in 1936. However, his interpretation met severe criticism.

The same year brought a radical change in Soviet historiography: A critical approach toward the 1812 campaign was no longer permitted. At this point, Tarle was subjected to strong criticism among the society of historians all around the world. Émigré historians in the [[United States]] and historians in [[Europe]] wrote about Tarle soon after he completed a second book on the same theme in the history of the 1812 war. He prepared his new work in a comparatively shorter time and published it in 1938 under the title ''Napoleon’s Invasion of Russia, 1812''. This book was translated into English and published in [[Great Britain]] in 1942.

In his new book, Tarle mixed Marxist ideology and [[Russian nationalism]]. This time, the war of 1812 was not presented as unexceptional like other wars of Napoleon. The war with Russia was “more frankly imperialistic than any other of Napoleon’s wars; it was more directly dictated by the interests of the French upper-middle class.” The “principal theme of Tarle’s new work was his glorification of the heroism exhibited by the Russian people and the wise conduct of the campaign by the Russian commanders in general and by [[Mikhail Kutuzov|Kutuzov]] in particular.” In his work of 1938, strong emphasis was placed on Russian patriotism.

===Post-World War II===
Tarle spent the [[Great Patriotic War]] in evacuation in [[Kazan]]. From 1941 to 1943 he worked as a professor at the historico-philological department of the [[Kazan (Volga region) Federal University|Vladimir Ulyanov-Lenin Kazan State University]]. From 1942 on he was also a member of the [[Extraordinary State Commission]] that investigated [[Nazi]] war crimes.

In the post-war period, Tarle’s 1938 book was subjected to severe and intemperate criticism as Soviet historical writing was affected by the “theory of the counteroffensive”. According to Erickson, the two important trends conflicting with the views of Tarle were “the campaign against the ‘[[cosmopolitanism]]’ … and Stalin’s glorification of himself as a military genius.”

In 1951 ''[[Kommunist|Bolshevik]]'' published an article written by the director of the War Museum in [[Borodino (village), Mozhaysky District, Moscow Oblast|Borodino]] Sergey Kozhukhov. Tarle was accused of having made use of foreign sources to the detriment of those of Russian origin, of having emphasized the passive character of Kutuzov’s maneuvers and of having claimed that Kutuzov was continuing the tactics of the [[Barclay de Tolly]]. In addition, Tarle was attacked for having failed to evaluate the Battle of Borodino as a clear-cut Russian victory, for having stated that Moscow was burned by the Russians themselves and for having assigned too much significance to the expanses of Russia, cold and hunger as factors in the defeat of the French army. According to Kozhukhov, Napoleon’s Invasion of Russia, 1812 showed the influence of bourgeois historiography. Tarle had not been sufficiently critical of “aristocratic-bourgeois” historians and had distorted the history of the “Fatherland War.”

Tarle replied to Kozhukhov’s criticism stating that he had already begun work on a new book on the Napoleonic period which would contain different interpretations than his earlier works. Tarle wrote “In light of the recent victory over the Nazis, it was no longer possible to view Russian history, especially military history, in the same way. Valuable new materials and “chiefly Stalin’s enormously significant and illuminating judgment, published in 1947”, had obliged Soviet historians to correct their errors and revise their interpretations of the war of 1812.”

Among Tarle’s works, another point which drew attention in the society of historians was his interpretation of [[Crimean War]]. Tarle began working on the history of the Crimean War in the late 1930s. He was given access to otherwise inaccessible Russian archives for his work. The first volume, published in 1941, was awarded the [[Stalin Prize]]. The second volume appeared in 1943. His general approach to the history of the Crimean War is a “mixture of criticism of the imperialistic character of the war and glorification of the Russian people.”

Tarle became one of the most influential figures in the historical front. His complete work was entitled “The City of Russian Glory: Sevastopol in 1854-1855”, and was published in 1954 by the publishing house of the USSR Defense Ministry. The book was based on the two-volume study about the Crimean war, written by Tarle earlier. He compares the siege of 1854-1855 to the defense of Sevastopol in 1941-1942 while attacking Washington, Hitlerism, and West Germany. The Crimean War was presented by Tarle to the public as a war launched by the western states. According to Tarle, in 1854-1855 the defenders of Sevastopol not only fought for the city, but also defended “the annexations, made by the Russian state and the Russian people in the times of Peter I and during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.”

===Death===
Yevgeny Viktorovich Tarle died on 6 January 1955 in Moscow. He died before he was able to fulfill his intention of writing a new book on the war of 1812, though he came further into line with the theory of the “counteroffensive” in an article published in 1952. He was buried at the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://novodevichiynecropol.narod.ru/tarle_ev.htm Tarle's tomb]&lt;/ref&gt; His wife Olga Tarle (1874—1955) died same year, just a month later and was buried near him. They lived together for over 60 years. Their only son Victor died shortly after his birth and was buried in Kiev.

==Memory==
According to Hetnal, no other Soviet historian received so much attention as Tarle did both at home and abroad. Foreign historians have been fascinated by Tarle. The professor of Polish origin, [[Wiktor Weintraub]] wrote an article devoted to him. Italian historian [[Franco Venturi]] also wrote an interesting article about Tarle. They were followed by [[Edgar Hösch]] and others; Tarle’s writings had also been evaluated by [[Anatole Mazour]]. Another comprehensive work on Tarle was completed by [[Stanisław Wiśniewski]], a Polish historian from Lublin. He stressed that Tarle’s writings were of unequal value. The wide range of Tarle’s interests, even within the Napoleonic field, the speed with which he worked, as well as the political situation in which he worked after 1936 and other reasons account for his shortcomings.
