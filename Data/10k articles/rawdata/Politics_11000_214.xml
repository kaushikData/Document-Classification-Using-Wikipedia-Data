'''''Baghdaddy''''' is a satirical musical comedy stage play with music and book by Marshall Paillet, lyrics and book by A.D. Penedo, based on an unproduced screenplay by J.T. Allen, and produced by [[Charlie Fink (producer)|Charlie Fink]]. The musical is based on historical events leading up to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] by the [[United States]], and focuses on how the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and [[Federal Intelligence Service (Germany)|BND]] (German intelligence service) provided the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] with a justification for invading [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Baghdaddy'' was produced Off-Off-Broadway at the [[The Actors' Temple|Actor's Temple]] in 2015. The production was critically acclaimed, and was dubbed a [https://www.nytimes.com/reviews/theater/critics-pick Critic's Pick] by the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/theater/review-whos-your-baghdaddy-on-the-difference-between-credible-and-reliable-intelligence.html|title=Review: 'Who's Your Baghdaddy?', on the Difference Between Credible and Reliable Intelligence|last=Gates|first=Anita|date=2015-10-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-27|issn=0362-4331|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170107123444/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/theater/review-whos-your-baghdaddy-on-the-difference-between-credible-and-reliable-intelligence.html|archivedate=2017-01-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new production opened Off-Broadway at the [[St. Luke's Theatre]] on May 1, 2017.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/how-the-creators-of-baghdaddy-turned-the-crazy-true-life-story-of-the-iraq-war-instigators-into-a-musical|title=How the Creators of Baghdaddy Turned the Crazy True-Life Story of the Iraq War Instigators Into a Musical   {{!}} Playbill|website=Playbill|language=en|access-date=2017-04-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427111345/http://www.playbill.com/article/how-the-creators-of-baghdaddy-turned-the-crazy-true-life-story-of-the-iraq-war-instigators-into-a-musical|archivedate=2017-04-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The musical takes place in a [[Frame story|narrative frame]] in which the cast and audience attend an [[Alcoholics Anonymous|AA]]-style support group for people who started the [[Iraq War]]. The cast includes CIA operatives, an Iraqi informant, and a BND operative.

The story focuses on the recruitment and eventual disgrace of an Iraqi defector, codenamed "Curveball," and the use and misuse of his testimony by the CIA, [[United States Department of State|State Department]], and [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]]. In ''Baghdaddy'', as in reality, Curveball provides Western intelligence agencies with false intelligence on [[Mobile weapons laboratory#Iraqi Mobile weapons laboratories|Iraqi mobile weapons laboratories]]. This intelligence, which is later discovered to have been fabricated, was used by Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] in his [[United Nations Security Council and the Iraq War|2003 speech to the UN Security Council]] to justify the invasion of Iraq and overthrow of [[Saddam Hussein]].

== Historical context ==
Near the opening of the show, the cast explains to the audience that some of the characters are loosely based on actual figures, while others are composites of multiple figures. The story hews closely to historical accounts of the period, particularly [[Bob Drogin]]'s book ''Curveball: Spies, Lies, and the Con Man Who Caused a War'' (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Curveball: Spies, Lies, and the Con Man Who Caused a War|last=Drogin|first=Bob|publisher=Random House|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frank Rich|Frank Rich's]] book ''The Greatest Story Ever Sold: The Decline and Fall of Truth in Bush's America'' (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Greatest Story Ever Sold: The Decline and Fall of Truth in Bush's America|last=Rich|first=Frank|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character "Curveball" is based on an actual Iraqi defector and BND informant, [[Curveball (informant)|Rafid Ahmed Alwan al-Janabi]], who was known by the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] cryptonym "Curveball." The fictional character "Tyler Nelson" shares a first name and some biographical details with the late, retired CIA official [[Tyler Drumheller]], while the character "Martin Bouchard" shares several biographical details with former UN Chief Weapons Inspector and [[Iraq Survey Group]] leader [[David Kay]].

Founded in 2013,&lt;ref name="larsson2016"&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0261-3077| last = Larsson| first = Naomi| title = Is the world finally waking up to intersex rights?| work = [[The Guardian]]| accessdate = 2017-05-19| date = February 10, 2016| url = https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/feb/10/intersex-human-rights-lgbti-chile-argentina-uganda-costa-rica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brújula Intersexual provides peer support, education and information.

== History ==

Brújula Intersexual was founded by Laura Inter on the day after [[Intersex Awareness Day]] in 2013, 27 October.&lt;ref name="voices2015"&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 5 | number = 2| pages = 95–98| last = Inter| first = Laura| title = Finding My Compass| journal = [[Narrative Inquiry in Bioethics]]| date = 2015| url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/nib/summary/v005/5.2.inter.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is intended to help intersex people find each other, connect, and improve their human rights situation.&lt;ref name="voices2015" /&gt;

== Activities ==

=== Physical integrity and bodily autonomy ===

Brújula Intersexual calls for self-determination by intersex people.&lt;ref name="rodrigo2016"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Rodrigo| first = Borja| title = Intersexualidad: La ablación legal al servicio del género| work = [[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]| accessdate = 2017-05-19| date = December 11, 2016| url = http://www.elmundo.es/sociedad/2016/12/11/584b00db22601d53428b4646.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It documents the health and human rights situation facing intersex people in Mexico, and in the Latin American region more broadly, including societal taboos, incomprehension, unnecessary medicalization, and discrimination.&lt;ref name="voices2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="iad2016"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Inter| first = Laura| title = The situation of the intersex community in Mexico| work = [[Intersex Day]]| accessdate = 2017-05-19| date = October 3, 2016| url = http://intersexday.org/en/situation-mexico/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="avanzado2016"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Inter| first = Laura| title = La situación de la comunidad intersexual de México*| accessdate = 2017-05-19| date = October 28, 2016| url = http://www.diarioavanzada.com.mx/index.php/sociedad/19929-la-situacion-de-la-comunidad-intersexual-de-mexico| work = Diario Avanzada| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180104224226/http://www.diarioavanzada.com.mx/index.php/sociedad/19929-la-situacion-de-la-comunidad-intersexual-de-mexico#| archive-date = 2018-01-04| dead-url = yes| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ricardo Baruch, writing in Animal Politico and citing Laura Inter, describes the situation on where intersex is constantly left out of discussion or policy because it is not very understood, even though it is a biological situation.&lt;ref name="baruch2016"&gt;{{Cite| publisher = Animal Politico| last = Baruch| first = Ricardo| title = Sí, hay personas intersexuales en México| date = October 13, 2016| url = http://www.animalpolitico.com/blogueros-blog-invitado/2016/10/13/las-personas-intersexuales-mexico/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, Laura Inter and colleagues including [[Natasha Jiménez]] of MULABI, testified before the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] on the human rights situation facing intersex people in Latin America.&lt;ref name="latfem"&gt;{{Cite web| last = LATFEM Periodismo feminista| title = Las voces de las personas intersex ante la Comisión Interamericana| work = LATFEM| accessdate = 2017-05-20| date = 2017-03-20| url = http://latfem.org/global/las-voces-de-las-personas-intersex-ante-la-comision-interamericana/?ref=latfem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brújula Intersexual has found that few doctors are trained and sensitized on intersex issues, leading to a tendency to recommend genital surgeries or hormonal treatments to create "normality" even where individuals have escaped such [[intersex medical interventions]] as children.&lt;ref name="baruch2016" /&gt; It has documented problems with medical examinations and treatments as a result of such practices.&lt;ref name="iad2016" /&gt; Brújula Intersexual has also documented significant levels of poverty and disparities in access to health care based upon family wealth and income.&lt;ref name="iad2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="avanzado2016" /&gt;

=== Identification documents ===

Laura Inter and Eva Alcántara of [[UAM Xochimilco]] have cited arguments that the most pressing problems facing intersex people are treatment to enforce a sex binary, and not the existence of the sex binary itself.&lt;ref name="alcantara2015"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.corteidh.or.cr/tablas/r34720.pdf | first1 = Eva | last1 = Alcántara | first2 = Laura | last2 = Inter | work = Dfensor | publisher = [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] | date = March 2015 | title = Intersexualidad y derechos humanos | pages = 28 - 32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laura Inter has imagined a society where sex or gender classifications are removed from birth certificates and other official identification documents.&lt;ref name="iad2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="yp2017"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://brujulaintersexual.wordpress.com/2017/02/23/submission-on-the-yogyakarta-principles-human-rights-issues-and-perspectives-from-the-experience-of-the-intersex-community-in-mexico/ | title = Submission on the Yogyakarta Principles: Human rights issues and perspectives from the experience of the intersex community in Mexico | date = February 23, 2017 | first1 = Laura | last1 = Inter | first2 = Hana | last2 = Aoi | work = Brújula Intersexual}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International work ===

Laura Inter represented Brújula Intersexual at the Fourth [[International Intersex Forum]], held in Amsterdam in April 2017.&lt;ref name="interact2017"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://interactadvocates.org/4thforumstatement/ | title = 4th International Intersex Forum Statement | publisher = [[Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth]] | date = April 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1935 near [[New Buffalo, Michigan]] on the site of an old [[Farband]] summer camp that had been damaged by fire, Tel Hai operated for ten years before being destroyed by fire around 1945.

'''Climate restoration''' consists of a goal and associated actions intended to reverse the current trends of [[climate change]] &lt;ref&gt;

While much remains to be learned, the core phenomenon, scientific questions, and hypotheses have been examined thoroughly and have stood firm in the face of serious scientific debate and careful evaluation of alternative explanations. * * * (pp. 21–22) Some scientific conclusions or theories have been so thoroughly examined and tested, and supported by so many independent observations and results, that their likelihood of subsequently being found to be wrong is vanishingly small. Such conclusions and theories are then regarded as settled facts.

Such actions include the [[carbon dioxide removal]] from the [[atmosphere|Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere]], which, in combination with [[Air pollution|emissions reductions]], can reduce the level of {{CO2|link=yes}} in the atmosphere and thereby reduce the [[global warming]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/11/28/science/what-is-climate-change.html|title=Short Answers to Hard Questions About Climate Change|last=Gillis|first=Justin|date=2015-11-28|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-08-07|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced by the [[greenhouse effect]] of an excess of {{CO2}} over its pre-industrial level.

== Restoration and mitigation==
Climate restoration is the goal underlying [[climate change mitigation]],&lt;ref name=GCCSI&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Status of BECCS Projects 2010 |url=http://cdn.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/global-status-beccs-projects-2010 |publisher=[[Biorecro]] and [[Carbon capture and storage (timeline)#Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute|The Global Carbon Capture and Storage institute]] |year=2011 |accessdate=2011-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928114027/http://cdn.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/global-status-beccs-projects-2010 |archivedate=2013-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; whose actions are intended to “limit the magnitude or rate of long-term climate change”.  Advocates of climate restoration accept that climate change has already had major negative impacts which threaten the long-term survival of humanity. The current mitigation pathway leaves the risk that conditions will go beyond [[Climate adaptation|adaptation]] and [[abrupt climate change]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=0-309-07434-7|authors=Committee on Abrupt Climate Change, Ocean Studies Board, Polar Research Board, Board on Atmospheric Sciences and Climate, Division on Earth and Life Studies, National Research Council.|year=2002|page=108|publisher=National Academy Press|location=Washington, D.C.|title=Abrupt climate change : inevitable surprises}}&lt;/ref&gt; will be upon us.  There is a human moral imperative to maximize the chances of future generations' survival.  By promoting the vision of a “better future for our children and grandchildren”, with the Earth System restored to a state close to that in which our species and civilization evolved, advocates claim that there is a huge incentive for innovation and investment to ensure that this restoration takes place safely and in a timely fashion. As stated in "The Economist" in November 2017, "in any realistic scenario, emissions cannot be cut fast enough to keep the total stock of greenhouse gases sufficiently small to limit the rise in temperature successfully. But there is barely any public discussion of how to bring about the extra “negative emissions” needed to reduce the stock of {{CO2}} ... Unless that changes, the promise of limiting the harm of climate change is almost certain to be broken."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21731397-stopping-flow-carbon-dioxide-atmosphere-not-enough-it-has-be-sucked-out|title=What they don’t tell you about climate change|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 25, 2018, Rep. [[Jamie Raskin]] introduced a resolution on Climate Restoration to the U.S House Committee of Energy and Commerce, concluding with "Whereas scientists have researched methods for keeping warming below 2° C, but have not yet researched the best methods to remove all excess CO2, stop sea-level rise, and restore a safe and healthy climate for future generations; and
Whereas declaring a goal of restoring a safe and healthy climate will encourage scientists to research the most effective ways to restore safe CO2 levels, stop sea-level rise, and restore a safe and healthy climate for future generations." 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/137/text?r=1|title=Expressing the sense of Congress that the United States is committed to ensuring a safe and healthy climate for future generations, and to creating solutions for restoring the climate.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climate restoration as policy goal==

A first peer-reviewed article about climate restoration was published in April 2018 by the Rand Corporation.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Climate Restoration an appropriate policy goal?|first= |last= Robert J. Lempert, Giacomo Marangoni, Klaus Keller, Jessica Duke|publisher=Rand Corporation |url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2442.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The analysis "examines climate restoration through the lens of risk management under conditions of deep uncertainty, exploring the technology, economic, and policy conditions under which it might be possible to achieve various climate restoration goals and the conditions under which society might be better off with (rather than without) a climate restoration goal." One key finding of the study is that it would be possible to restore the CO2 atmospheric concentrations to preindustrial levels at an acceptable cost under two scenarios, where greenhouse gas reductions and direct air capture technologies prove to be economically efficient. One key recommendation of the study is that an ambitious climate restoration goal may seek to achieve preindustrial concentration by 2075, or by the end of the century. The article concludes saying, "The best we can do is pursue climate restoration with a passion while embedding it in a process of testing, experimentation, correction, and discovery."

== Critical parameters==
The endpoint goal of climate restoration is to generally maximize the probability of survival of our species and civilization by restoring two critical climate parameters: Atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels and Arctic ice cover. The approximate target levels are those of the [[Holocene]] norm in which our species and civilization most recently evolved. That is stated technically as "pre-industrial", or poetically as "like our grandparents had a hundred years ago". Numerically the goal is stated as getting atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; back below 300 ppm and restoring multi-year ice to the Siberian Arctic by 2050. Achieving this will require removing approximately a trillion tonnes of atmospheric CO2, and restoring permanent ice cover in the critical [[Arctic methane emissions|Siberian Arctic Sea]] to prevent methane emissions from melting permafrost. 

Critical parameters of the Earth System include:

* levels of [[climate forcing agents]] in the atmosphere, especially {{CO2}} and [[methane]] for positive forcing and SO2 aerosol for negative forcing;
* global mean surface temperature (compared to some baseline) and its rate of increase;
* [[sea level]] and the rate that sea level is rising;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
 | title= Climate Change Indicators in the United States: Sea level
 | url=http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/science/indicators/oceans/sea-level.html
 | publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]
 | date=May 2014
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[pH]] and rate of [[ocean acidification]].
* Ice levels of the [[polar ice cap]]s. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=It might be possible to refreeze the ice caps to slow global warming|first=William |last=Matt|publisher=Phys.org |url=https://phys.org/news/2017-02-refreeze-icecaps-global.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the principal goals for climate restoration is to bring the {{CO2}} level down from current level of ~405 ppm (2016) towards its pre-industrial level of ~280 ppm.  Not only will this reduce {{CO2}}’s global warming effect but also its effect on ocean acidification. The removed carbon would be [[Carbon_sequestration|sequestered]] or used as constructon material. 

== Limitations==
However, not every aspect of the Earth System can be returned to a previous state: notably the warming of the [[deep sea]] or deep ocean and the associated sea level rise which has already taken place may be essentially irreversible this century.  Conversely there are certain aspects of the Earth System that need to be improved with respect to the recent past: notably food productivity, considering an [[Population growth|increased global population]] by 2050 or 2100.

The '''Commission for Building Fifty New Churches''' (in [[London]] and the surroundings) was an organisation set up by [[Act of Parliament]] in [[England]] in 1710,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=New Churches in London and Westminster Act 1710 (9 Anne cap 17)}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[New Churches in London and Westminster Act 1710]], with the purpose of building fifty new churches for the rapidly growing conurbation of London.  It did not achieve its target, but did build a number of churches, which would become known as the '''Queen Anne Churches'''.

==Churches built==
Most of the churches were designed by [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]], with [[John James (architect)|John James]], [[Thomas Archer]] and [[James Gibbs]] also participating.

*[[Christ Church, Spitalfields]] Hawksmoor 1714&amp;ndash;29
*[[St Alfege Church, Greenwich]] Hawksmoor 1712&amp;ndash;18 (rebuilding of an existing church)
*[[St Anne's Limehouse]] Hawksmoor 1714&amp;ndash;30
*[[St George's, Bloomsbury]] Hawksmoor 1716&amp;ndash;31
*[[St George in the East]] Hawksmoor 1714&amp;ndash;29
*[[St George's, Hanover Square]] James 1720&amp;ndash;25
*[[St John Horsleydown]] Hawksmoor and James 1727&amp;ndash;33
*[[St John's, Smith Square]] Archer 1713&amp;ndash;28
*[[St Luke Old Street]] Hawksmoor and James 1727&amp;ndash;33
*[[St Mary le Strand]] Gibbs 1714&amp;ndash;23
*[[St Mary Woolnoth]] Hawksmoor 1716&amp;ndash;24 (rebuilding of an existing church)
*[[St Paul's, Deptford]] Archer 1713&amp;ndash;30

The Commission partly funded rebuilding of five churches: [[St George's Church, Gravesend|St George Gravesend]], [[St George the Martyr Southwark]], [[St Giles in the Fields]], [[St Mary Magdalen Woolwich]] and [[St Michael, Cornhill]].  It bought and altered [[St George the Martyr Holborn]] and bought [[St John Clerkenwell]].

==Funding==
The Commission was funded by a duty on coal coming into London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nail|first=Martin|title=Government duty|url=http://www.coaldutyposts.org.uk/history/governmentduty.html|work=City posts: the coal duties of the City of London and their boundary marks|accessdate=2012-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tax was originally levied in 1670 to pay for the rebuilding of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and City churches destroyed in the [[Great Fire of London]]. When the Commission was set up the duty was assigned to it. In 1718 the duty became part of general government revenues but was still used to fund the Commissioners' work.

'''Corruption in South Sudan''' is among the worst in the world. The nation's elites have developed a kleptocratic system that controls every part of the [[South Sudan]]ese economy. This system has taken shape quickly in a relatively short period, South Sudan having won self-rule in 2005 while remaining part of Sudan, and having been accorded full sovereignty in 2011. The nation was ranked fifth on [[Transparency International|Transparency International's]] 2014 [[Corruption Perception Index|list of most corrupt nations]], preceded only by [[Somalia]], [[North Korea]], [[Sudan]], and [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Bartlett| first =Evan| title =The most corrupt countries in the world, ranked in order| work =The Independent | url =http://i100.independent.co.uk/article/the-most-corrupt-countries-in-the-world-ranked-in-order--xJUZ5u9j_x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Zeitvogel| first =Karin; Biajo, Nabeel| title =South Sudan Seen as One of World's Most Corrupt Nations | work =Voice of America| date =Dec 3, 2014| url =http://www.voanews.com/content/south-sudan-corruption-transparency-international-annual-index/2544599.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one member of parliament, the nation has lacked any and all regulations to "combat frauds and malfeasance among the senior government officials," especially among government procurement officials within the ministry of finance and economic planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Achien| first =Mel Wal| title =Corruption: The untold facts of South Sudan's Dura scandal| work =Sudan Tribune| date =May 27, 2013| url =http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article46716}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 article, Nyol Gaar Nguen wrote that "[o]utright thieves and looting of public funds in a broad day light by the enforcer or man in charge always reigns" in South Sudan.&lt;ref name=sud47&gt;{{cite web| last =Nguen| first =Nyol Gaar| title =The 488 million pounds evidence of corruption in the presidency| work =Sudan Tribune| date =Jul 19, 2013| url =http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article47336}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of corruption and mismanagement revealed in the Auditor General's report for 2005 and 2006 reportedly "brought some MPs in South Sudan's National Legislative Assembly to tears."&lt;ref name=sud41&gt;{{cite web| title =SPLA top generals asked by anti-corruption to declare their assets| work =Sudan Tribune| date =Feb 27, 2012| url =http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article41727}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 report stated that more than $4 billion in government funds had been stolen since the advent of self-rule in 2005.&lt;ref name=sud42&gt;{{cite web| last =Uma| first =Julius| title =Australia urges transparency in South Sudan's mining industry| work =Sudan Tribune| date =Jun 18, 2012| url =http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article42960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major corruption scandal since the beginning of self-rule has been the so-called "Dura Saga," although there have been dozens of other significant instances of similar wrongdoing. These episodes have often been shrouded in confusion and have almost never resulted in prosecution or punishment. ''The Africa Review'' noted in 2013 that despite the South Sudanese government having ordered several investigations into scandals, they are virtually always ignored or intentionally sabotaged altogether.&lt;ref name=afr&gt;{{cite web| last =Amos| first =Machel| title =South Sudan's dizzying corruption merry-go-round| work =African Review| date =May 21, 2013| url =http://www.africareview.com/Blogs/South-Sudans-corruption-merry-go-round/-/979192/1858488/-/anx5b8/-/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Salva Kiir Mayardit]] has repeatedly declared that his government is actively fighting corruption, but on April 12, 2013, he fired Elias Wako Nyamellel, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, "for acknowledging that South Sudan is corrupted and 'rotten to the core.'"&lt;ref name=sud47/&gt; The problem is compounded by the serious lack of transparency in South Sudanese government records and business information. Requests for official data can be arbitrarily turned down with impunity.&lt;ref name=sentr&gt;{{cite web| title =The Nexus of Corruption and Conflict in South Sudan| work =The Sentry| url =https://thesentry.org/reports/south-sudan/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginnings==
South Sudan, notes a 2015 report by ''The Sentry'', was founded with hope in mind with its citizens voting overwhelmingly for independence and the international community providing substantial assistance. Given its high level of [[petroleum|oil]] revenues, South Sudan was predicted to rapidly attain self-reliance after the transition, but instead it "plunged into civil war, economic collapse, and creeping international isolation," while its rulers took over virtually every sector of the economy, squandering "a historic chance for the development of a functional state." The ongoing civil war is largely the result of conflicts among the elites who are desiring to "re-negotiate" shares of political-economic power balance, including natural resources, through war.&lt;ref name=sentr/&gt;

==The corruption system==
A report by the ''U4 Anti-Corruption Resource Centre'', identifies the main types of corruption in South Sudan as [[bureaucratic corruption]], [[patronage]], [[political corruption]], and [[embezzlement]], and states that these forms of corruption take place largely in the following sectors: extractives, public financial management, and police and security forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =South Sudan: Overview of corruption and anti-corruption| work =Anti-Corruption Resource Centre| url =http://www.u4.no/publications/south-sudan-overview-of-corruption-and-anti-corruption/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report by ''The Sentry'' categorizes corruption in South Sudan in a slightly different way, identifying the following four main methods the nation's wealth is diverted into the pockets of elites:
:#The extractives sector, the nation's largest revenue source, which lacks any transparency and it completely mismanaged. Oil is the government's main source of hard currency, and serves as collateral for the foreign loans that keep its economy afloat.&lt;ref name=sentr/&gt;
:#The military state maintains control over the nation's economy directly by controlling the public budget and indirectly by close ties to businesses and contracts. South Sudan's military spending is higher than that of any other country in the region. Virtually no information about military allocations is provided, which in some cases is a violation of the law. The military involves "a large and complicated patronage system," and there is little oversight of payroll expenses, with the leading security ministries (Defense, Interior, and Intelligence) rarely reporting their payroll expenditures. In many cases, military commanders have stolen the salaries of soldiers; there are also tens of thousands of "ghost soldiers," i.e., soldiers who exist only on payroll documents, and this is said to be the primary method of military and security officials to divert wealth to private accounts. Military generals wield great power in allocating government funds, and often redirect non-military funds to military purposes. Acquisition of military weapons and supplies is carried out in an ad-hoc manner and is characterized by corruption, overpricing, and a lack of proper paperwork and of transparency. The president's personal budget is "subject to very little oversight," and many items in it are outrageously inflated and apparently conceal military expenditures.&lt;ref name=sentr/&gt;
:#State spending, which involves a procurement system that is susceptible to corruption and waste, with lucrative contracts regularly awarded to the suppliers connected to government officials. Nearly every public institution is crippled by corruption and mismanagement. No-bid contracts, notably for roadbuilding and vehicle imports, are regularly awarded to companies owned by ruling elites at inflated prices with no oversight. State spending in South Sudan is marked by a "widespread disregard" for reporting, regulation,and documentation. Setting up companies involves dealing with an elaborate bureaucracy, and this complex system is believed to have enabled officials to profit extensively through bribes and the acquisition of undocumented shares in firms. Rules requiring annual financial disclosures are systematically ignored. A considerable amount of state funds is also diverted into shell companies that are used to divert state wealth on a large scale. In several cases, government contracts have been awarded to firms that had no background in the relevant activity and that were likely set up only days or even hours before the contracts were awarded.&lt;ref name=sentr/&gt;
:#Money laundering: Elites exploit the country's fragile financial industry by using it to launder money and generate revenue. South Sudan's elites are involved heavily in the financial sector, especially in speculation in the parallel currency market, which lowers the value of the currency and leads to inflation. The sector has expanded considerably since the country gained its independence, making it easier for elites to engage in illegal transfers. "Bulk cash couriers" allow for simpler and faster transfer of funds out of the country, with fewer disclosures and less traceability. In addition, several banks' board of directors lists name the same nation's elites, indicating these banks chiefly serve their interests. Also, private [[FOREX]] bureaus have been established, and facilitate money laundering and other illicit transactions. Some of them are reportedly owned by members of the elite, which would represent a major conflict of interest.&lt;ref name=sentr/&gt;

==Dura Saga==
In 2008, expecting a famine, the South Sudan government paid nearly $1 million, according to a 2013 report by the ''[[Voice of America]]'', for cereals that were never delivered. This is known as the "Dura Saga," after the South Sudanese name for [[sorghum]], ''dura''. [[World Bank]] auditors found in February 2013 that 290 firms were paid without ever having signed a contract, and another 151 firms were overpaid significantly. A criminal probe launched in the wake of this audit sought to ascertain why the contractors were paid for goods that never arrived, why the prices were so high, and if government officials were involved in the scandal. The probe was to be led by Prosecutor General Filberto Mayout Mareng.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Rwakaringi| first =Mugume Davis| title =South Sudan to Probe 'Dura Saga' Grain Swindle | work =Voice of America| date =May 15, 2013| url =http://www.voanews.com/content/south-sudan-probe-sorghum-dura-saga-corruption/1661994.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A February 2012 report by the ''Sudan Tribune'' described the Dura Saga as the largest and most costly corruption scandal in South Sudan since the nation's founding in 2005, and maintained that it involved the disappearance of not just one million but several billion dollars that had been allocated for the building and repair of grain stores and the purchase of grain.&lt;ref name=sud41/&gt; In a June 2012 article, Dr. Jok Madut Jok, Under Secretary of the National Ministry of Culture, put the missing amount at $4 million and added the funds are somewhere among the traders who falsely claimed to have delivered the grain, the governors who lied about the grain delivery or were criminally negligent, or the ministers of finance in [[Juba]] who approved payments for more than double the national budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Jok| first =Jok Madut| title =Missing Billions And Sorghum Saga in South Sudan| work =Gurtong| date =Jun 13, 2012| url =http://www.gurtong.net/ECM/Editorial/tabid/124/ctl/ArticleView/mid/519/articleId/7146/Missing-Billions-And-Sorghum-Saga-in-South-Sudan.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A list of 81 fake companies that had allegedly been involved in the scandal was posted online in January 2013, along with appropriated amounts for each firm ranging from 400,000 to 2,000,000 pounds. Among those blamed for the scandal were Michael Makuei Lueth, Parliamentary Affairs minister, whose then-ministry had registered the companies, and Benjamin Bol Mel, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and owner of the ABMC construction company, ABMC, who wrote to President Kiir to insist payment for the bogus contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Crook| first =Holy| title =The Dura Saga Fat Cats | work =South Sudan News| date =Jan 7, 2013| url =http://www.southsudannewsagency.com/news/breaking-news/the-dura-saga-fat-cats}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other incidents==
An audit of government accounts showed that over $1 billion had disappeared without a trace from 2005 to 2006. The parliament subsequently summoned Arthur Akwen Chol, former Minister of Finance and Economic Planning, and Elijah Malok Aleng, former Governor of what was then called the Central Bank of Southern Sudan (CBoSS), and accused them of aiding corruption. Chol refused to appear; Malok did appear, and denied guilt, while saying that some of the missing funds had been diverted into Akwen's personal accounts. Akwen was also accused of buying government vehicles from the Cardinal Company at an inflated price, but Akwen said that he had made the purchase at the direction of Vice President Riek Machar. Machar, in turn, while admitting to having asked Akwen to purchase vehicles, denied being involved in the details of the transaction.&lt;ref name=sud41/&gt;

Between 2006 and 2012, the country spent $1.7 billion on road construction, but only 75 kilometres of roads had been built or paved.&lt;ref name=sud47/&gt; Stephen Madut Baak, a presidential advisor, was caught at [[Heathrow Airport]] in 2008 with allegedly $3 million in cash –which was later confirmed by the Government of Southern Sudan to be false information as Mr Stephen Madut Baak was only in possession of $137,000 to open the Government of Southern Sudan (GOSS) liaison office in London. Due to UK restrictions on such sums of money coming from countries outside of the European Union and failure to declare the funds, the money was seized by HM Revenue and Customs, however, the total sum was cleared of any suspicions and was released back to him by the local authorities within 24 hours. &lt;ref name=sud47/&gt; Also in 2008, Arthur Akuien Chol, former Finance Minister, reportedly stole $600 million.&lt;ref name=sud47/&gt; In 2009, a sum of $323,000 that was intended for East African students was deposited into a private bank account in [[Uganda]].&lt;ref name=afr/&gt;

On September 5, 2011, President Kiir demanded that 488 million pounds ($244 million) be awarded to ABMC Company, a private construction firm owned by a close associate of Kiir's, Benjamin Bol Mel, without the Council of Ministers' approval. The payment was supposedly for road construction, but as of 2013, according to Nyol Gaar Nguen, there was little evidence that the firm had actually done any construction work in connection with the contract.&lt;ref name=sud47/&gt; President Kiir reported $4 billion missing in 2012.&lt;ref name=sud47/&gt; In 2013, $6 million was reported stolen from the president's office.&lt;ref name=sud47/&gt; From 2012 to 2013, the Ministry of Roads and Bridges overspent its budget by 1513%.&lt;ref name=sentr/&gt; Cash sums of $14,000 and 176,000 South Sudan pounds ($55,000) were reportedly stolen from the president's office in March 2013.&lt;ref name=afr/&gt;

In April 2013, President Kiir fired the deputy Foreign Affairs minister for International Cooperation, Elias Wako Nyamellel, and suspended Yel Luol, an executive director in the president's office, Mayuen Wol, a personal assistant to the president, and Nhomout Agoth Cithiik, the accounts controller in the president's office, in connection with the disappearance of cash sums of 176,000 pounds and $14,000 from the president's office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Kiir sacks deputy foreign affairs minister, suspends officials over stolen funds| work =Sudan Tribune| date =Apr 12, 2013| url =http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article46200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, Rex Abdalla Nicholas, the Managing Director of Payii roads and bridges company, was arrested for misappropriating funds intended for the construction of a road from Juba to Kajokeji. The arrest took place after he had repeatedly ignored a summons by the South Sudan Anti-Corruption Commission (SSACC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Payii roads and bridges boss arrested over misuse of Juba-Kajokeji road funds| work =Sudan Tribune| date =May 31, 2013| url =http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article46775}}&lt;/ref&gt; A June 1, 2013, news article stated that the committee investigating the disappearance of money from the president's office had submitted its findings to the president. Sources said that owing to "a lot of interference during the investigation process," the committee was unable to determine how much money had gone missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Committee completes investigation into money stolen from Kiir's office| work =Sudan Tribune| date =Jun 1, 2013| url =http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article46789}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a June 18, 2013, decree, President Kiir lifted the immunity of Minister of Cabinet Affairs Deng Alor and Finance Minister Kosti Manibe, demanding that they reveal their role in the transfer of nearly eight million US dollars to a business associate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =South Sudan's Fight against Corruption: Are We Winning?| work =The SUDD Institute | url =http://www.suddinstitute.org/assets/Publications/South-Sudan-Fight-Against-Corruption2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, both ministers were suspended, accused of transferring the $8 million sum from the national treasury into a private account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =South Sudan corruption rampant, despite sacked ministers| work =Global Ris Insights| url =http://globalriskinsights.com/2013/08/south-sudan-corruption-rampant-despite-sacked-ministers/}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 7, 2013, however, Pagan Amum said that Kuol and Manibe had been suspended for political reasons and that Kiir had left the true culprits untouched. Manibe also claimed his suspension to be politically motivated. Both ministers had allegedly been involved in a transfer scheme of over 7 million US dollars to a firm known as Daffy Investment Ltd. The transfer had taken place without the president's knowledge or authorization for the alleged purchase of anti-fire safes for the government. The president ordered that the two men be investigated and, if found guilty, criminally prosecuted. This was described as "the biggest ever scandal in the country's post-secession era, after president Kiir's letter to 75 senior current and former officials in his government, suspected of stealing a disputed figure of $4 billion US dollars over a six-year period."&lt;ref name=sud47/&gt;

As of August 2013, millions of dollars had been allocated for the expansion of the Juba Airport, but with few results.&lt;ref name=sentr/&gt; In September 2013, President Kiir accused his country's armed forces of corruption, saying they had squandered official funds on "dubious activities", citing names on the payroll of "ghosts", or "[[no-show job]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =South Sudan's Kiir accuses army of corruption| work =Sudan Tribune| date =Sep 20, 2013| url =http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article48115}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first quarter of 2015, the SSACC received only 64% of its allocated budget, and the National Audit Chamber, which has reportedly produced "honest and detailed audit reports," received only 17%.&lt;ref name=sentr/&gt;

The South Sudanese army admitted in May 2015 that two senior military officers at the ministry of defense and veterans affairs, Major General John Lat, director for procurement, and ministry under-secretary Bior Ajang Duot, had been suspended after being accused of corruption. The latter's office had apparently requested 37 million pounds to purchase stationery and other office supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =South Sudan army admits suspension of top military officers over financial scandal| work =Sudan Tribune| date =May 6, 2015| url =http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article54872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, Clement Aturjong Kuot, deputy director for the South Sudanese government's official website, resigned, accusing minister Michael Makuei Lueth of nepotism. Kuot said Lueth had turned the ministry into a "family entity," promoting family members with no relevant media experience. Kuot said that as a result, his own skills were "wasted in the ministry of information and broadcasting" and he wanted to find some position in which he could serve the South Sudanese public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =S. Sudan information official quits, accuses minister of nepotism| work =Sudan Tribune| date =May 15, 2015| url =http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article54997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Baak Wuol is alleged to have stolen $20 million in government funds, and Salva Mathok Gengdit, Deputy Minister of Interior, is alleged to have stolen $293 million.&lt;ref name=sud47/&gt;

==Domestic anti-corruption efforts==
In 2009, President Kiir promised to give the South Sudan Anti-Corruption Commission (SSACC) power to prosecute the officials it investigates, but two and half years later the SSACC still lacked this power, and didn't end up giving anything. .&lt;ref name=sud41/&gt;

In September 2011 the SSACC stated that it was investigating about 60 corruption cases and sought to recover over 120 million pounds (about $20 million).&lt;ref name=sud41/&gt; In the same month, the South Sudanese government said it would strive to reform its tax collection system, having lost hundreds of millions of dollars as a result of the chicanery of phony tax collectors. A committee formed to investigate the problem had found that unauthorized several import taxes on essential goods and services had caused prices to rise astronomically. Reportedly, various unauthorized agencies and individuals had demanded "tax" from importers of goods and then pocketed the payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =South Sudan steps up efforts to end tax collection malpractices| work =Sudan Tribune| date =Sep 15, 2011| url =http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article40160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, according to one report, President Kiir "fired the head of the anti-corruption commission, Pauline Riak, and replaced her with a judge from the Supreme Court, Judge John Gatwech Lul, in a move that appeared to be an attempt to improve South Sudan's poor track record at fighting corruption."&lt;ref name=sud41/&gt; In February 2012, Gatwech Lul asked James Hoth Mai, Chief of General Staff, and his five deputies to ensure that army officers aid anti-corruption efforts by declaring their income and assets. Mai said the army would fully cooperate.&lt;ref name=sud41/&gt;

In May 2012, the Anti-Corruption Commission announced $60 million of stolen assets had been returned by government officials.&lt;ref name=sud428&gt;{{cite web| title =President Kiir demands South Sudan officials return stolen money| work =Sudan Tribune| date =Jun 2, 2012| url =http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article42785}}&lt;/ref&gt; A June 2, 2012, report stated that President Kiir had requested that over 75 former and current government officials demanding they account for missing funds in an effort to create more transparency. In the letter, he wrote, "I am writing to encourage you to return these stolen funds (partial or full)....If fund[s] are returned, the Government of the Republic of South Sudan will grant amnesty and will keep your name confidential. I and only one other official will have access to this information." Kiir said the letter was part of a new effort to combat corruption and create a more transparent and accountable government. Kiir also wrote to eight heads of state asking them to help recover about $4 billion believed to be in foreign banks.&lt;ref name=sud428/&gt;

Also in June 2012, Kiir said he had taken several additional measures to combat corruption. For example, he had issued several presidential decrees on the subject, had accepted about 500 "Declaration of Assets" forms from former and current officials, and had opened a bank account in Kenya to which stolen funds could be returned.&lt;ref name=sud428/&gt;

A 2013 report stated that the SSACC had, over a five-year period, failed to order a single corruption investigation. Also, no South Sudanese official had been prosecuted for corruption. The report noted that hundreds of corruption related cases have been queued for years in South Sudan without any investigations.&lt;ref name=sud41/&gt; Another 2013 report said that South Sudanese authorities were enlisting the aid of forensic accounting experts from Europe and the United States to "assist the commission in using the latest techniques of tracing and detecting 'stolen' money from bank accounts around the world."&lt;ref name=sud41/&gt;

==Foreign criticism and actions==
Reportedly, a list of 13 corrupt South Sudan officials, some of whom had suspiciously large accounts in foreign banks, was handed to South Sudan authorities by the U.S. in 2011.&lt;ref name=sud41/&gt; In May 2012, the U.S. stated that despite public statements about fighting corruption by Kiir, South Sudanese officials were continuing to commit acts of corruption with impunity.&lt;ref name=sud428/&gt; In June 2012, [[Tim Fischer]], the special envoy of the [[Australia]]n prime minister, called on South Sudan to pass legislation to improve transparency, accountability, and proper management in the country's mining industry.&lt;ref name=sud42/&gt;

In a paper presented at [[Oxford University]] in June 2012, Mairi John Blackings stated that South Sudan's ruling party had failed to transition from a [[guerilla]] movement into a proper government. "The failure to separate the state from the party and the attendant failure to institute checks and balances within the various organs of the state lie at the centre of the general air of malaise suffocating and squeezing life out of the nascent nation state of South Sudan, a year on," Blackings said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =South Sudan One Year On: From the World's Newest State to Another African Story| work =Sudan Tribune| date =Jul 10, 2012| url =http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article43217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, [[Fund for Peace]], based in [[Washington, D.C.]], named countries it most considered [[failed state]]s, ranking South Sudan at number four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = de Tuombuk| first =Joe| title =Is it fair to label South Sudan as a Failed State?| work =Sudan Tribune| date =Jul 16, 2013| url =http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article47305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective December 21, 2017, US President [[Donald Trump]] issued an executive order under the [[Magnitsky Act]] that specifically named Benjamin Bol Mel among the persons whose US-based assets are to be blocked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-blocking-property-persons-involved-serious-human-rights-abuse-corruption/|title=Executive Order Blocking the Property of Persons Involved in Serious Human Rights Abuse or Corruption|last=Trump|first=Donald|date=21 December 2017|website=Whitehouse.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/OFAC-Enforcement/Pages/20171221.aspx|title=Issuance of Global Magnitsky Executive Order; Global Magnitsky Designations|last=|first=|date=|website=Treasury.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19184">'''Cost of Conflict''' is a tool which attempts to calculate the price of conflict to the human race. The idea is to examine this cost, not only in terms of the deaths and casualties and the economic costs borne by the people involved, but also the social, developmental, environmental and strategic costs of conflict. In most cases organizations measure and analyze the economic and broader [[wikt:development|development]] costs of conflict. While this conventional method of assessing the impact of [[War|conflict]] is fairly in-depth, it does not provide a comprehensive overview of a country or region embroiled in conflict. One of the earliest studies assessing the true cost of conflict on a variety of parameters was commissioned by [http://www.saferworld.org.uk/ Saferworld] and compiled by Michael Cranna.&lt;ref&gt;Cranna, Michael (1994). The True Cost of Conflict. Earthscan Publication&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strategic Foresight Group]] has taken this science to a new level by developing a multi-disciplinary methodology, that has been applied to most parts of the world. A key benefit of using this tool is to encourage people to look at conflict in new ways and to widen public discussion of the subject, and to bring new insights to the debate on global security.

In today's world the cost of conflict tool and analysis can also be used to alert voters to the consequences of their governments' current positions,; these voters can be within the same country for example in the case of [[India]], in countries within the same region as in the case of the [[Middle East]], or Western voters whose nations are involved in conflicts abroad.

While the study of conflict is not new, the use of 'Cost of Conflict' as a comprehensive tool is relatively new. While engaging in such a study it is also important to identify what is meant by 'costs', and to differentiate between measurable costs that have a bearing on [[resources]], and costs that have a bearing on living conditions.

==Methodology==
The cost of conflict methodology takes into account different costs a conflict generates, including economic, military, [[Natural environment|environmental]], [[social]] and political costs. The approach considers direct costs of conflict, for instance human deaths, expenditure, destruction of land and physical infrastructure; as well as indirect costs that impact a society, for instance [[human migration|migration]], humiliation, growth of [[extremism]] and lack of [[civil society]]. The approach also examines the neighboring countries involved and assesses the impact on them as well as on the international community. Some studies are measured on a thematic basis, a recent example of which is the [[war on terror]] – though in this case most of the studies are done by the [[United States]] and examines the costs borne specifically by them.

These studies follow a similar pattern. A brief introduction sets the conflict in context and defines the period of the conflict being studied, as is the pattern followed by Michael Cranna in his book. The study is based on extensive research, inputs from experts within the conflict region and collaboration with policy experts. As in the case of the collection by Cranna and a report on the Middle East by [[Strategic Foresight Group]], these studies began with workshops involving organizations, governments and intellectuals which proved important in setting the priorities and direction of the studies. Such endeavors hold no weight without the input from experts of various fields from the conflict region under consideration. Each study also serves as an analytical tool and assesses past, present and future costs of conflicts using a wide range of parameters.

In most cases there is little attempt by these studies to analyze the causes of these conflicts as they would have been previously documented, and do not serve the purpose of the tool of measuring the cost of conflict.

With the use of such a tool and methodology, the question arises as to why researchers, intellectuals, and organizations might look at the cost of conflict, as opposed to discussing the benefits of peace. While it is important for people to benefit from peace and reconciliation through trade, cultural exchange and cooperation, it is much more crucial for them to understand and unravel the incentive structure of conflict and rid themselves of cost. Thus the use of 'cost of conflict' as a new and evolving tool to mobilize public opinion, broaden debate and examine new avenues for peace becomes extremely crucial.

==Limitations==
Researchers and analysts engaged in using this tool acknowledge that it is highly ambitious to identify the price of war, and there are limitations to assessing the total cost of any conflict. Conflict is not the only cause of impoverishment, diseases and other ills suffered by mankind; as [[Paul Collier]] deduces in his study of Africa, economics proved to be a major cause of conflict. What the cost of conflict tool serves to demonstrate is the impact of conflict above these and other natural factors, and how it has sometimes exacerbated them.

In some cases it is difficult to find contemporary data, or attribute costs to a specific period when, for example in the case of [[Kashmir]], where fighting has been going on at different levels of intensity for a long time. In such cases it could prove useful to have a significant year or episode in history as a benchmark for calculations. For example, the 'Cost of Conflict in the Middle East' report by Strategic Foresight Group, uses 1991 as a basis and explains how they believe that the Madrid Conference provided a historic opportunity for peace. The study by David Shave on the [[Peru]] Conflict uses 1980, or the first year of Sendero activity, as the starting point.

==Comprehensive Cost of Conflict Reports==

===The True Cost of Conflict===
The True Cost of Conflict is a compilation, edited by Michael Cranna from [[Saferworld]] in 1994. It comprises studies on the costs of 7 different conflicts. The costs entail the effects of conflict on health, education, civil and political rights, trade, power supply and transportation amongst others.

In the case of the [[Internal Conflict in Peru]], Cranna and David Shave explicate the potential benefits that the country could have accrued, if the conflict had not occurred. By taking a cross section analysis of Bolivia, Chile and Ecuador, they conclude that Peru recorded the most significant drop in GDP growth due to international recession and suffered the highest rate of inflation in the 1980s.  Hence "while all of Latin America suffered during the 1980's, no main Latin American country fell further…than Peru."

===Strategic Foresight Group's Cost of Conflict Reports===
[[Strategic Foresight Group]] offers three reports—published in 2009 (Middle East), 2006 (Sri Lanka), and 2004 (India/Pakistan)—on the cost of conflicts in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategicforesight.com/index.htm |title=Strategic Foresight Group |publisher=Strategicforesight.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reports take into account a varied number of parameters including military, economic, socio-political, environmental, psychological, and diplomatic costs among others. In other words, the report inculcates a comprehensive perspective of the effects of war and its aftermath. The documents are presented in a graphical form for easy and quick comprehension by decision makers. Apart from measuring the costs that have occurred in the past, the reports also includes potential future scenarios for conflict and their consequences.

[[Strategic Foresight Group]] led the first endeavor in the field of cost of conflict studies, which was received extremely well by the media and political strata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategicforesight.com/Ilmas_insight_cost_of_conflict.htm |title=Issue In Sight: Number 4 by Ilmas Futehally |publisher=Strategicforesight.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report has several interesting findings. According to the report, at least 100,000 families suffered direct human costs on account of the four wars between India and Pakistan. In addition, troop mobilization in Operation Prakaram (December 2001 – October 2002), cost India and Pakistan a combined $3billion. A similar mobilization in the future would see a 50% increase in costs on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategicforesight.com/publications_research.htm#ccip |title=Cost of Conflict between India and Pakistan, 2004 |publisher=Strategicforesight.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cost of Conflict in Sri Lanka====
This report focuses on the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]], a twenty-six-year-long military conflict between the Tamil insurgents and successive Sri Lankan governments. According to the report Sri Lanka was the most militarized among the South Asian countries with 8,000 military personnel per million population. In terms of [[military expenditure]] as percentage of [[GDP]], Sri Lanka had the largest expenditure in the region. The country's defense expenditure is also higher than other comparable conflict-ridden countries such as Colombia, Myanmar, Sierra Leone, Sudan, the Philippines and Uganda. Although the report is sold out the information is readily available on-line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategicforesight.com/publications_research.htm#ccsl |title=Cost of Conflict in Sri Lanka, 2006 |publisher=Strategicforesight.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cost of Conflict in the Middle East====
Lastly, the Cost of Conflict in the Middle East calculates the direct and indirect costs of successive wars in the Middle East. It involves all the countries affected. Some interesting findings from the report include the following points: 7 out of the 10 highest military spenders in the world are currently from the Middle East and the cumulative military expenditure is expected to double in the next 10 years. The region also has the highest number of military personnel per million people in the world. The [[First Gulf War]] in 1990, emitted CO2 that was equivalent to 1.5% of the world's annual emissions. The report has special chapters dedicated to the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategicforesight.com/publications_research.htm#costofconflict |title=The Cost of Conflict in the Middle East |publisher=Strategicforesight.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128200530/http://strategicforesight.com/publications_research.htm |archivedate=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opportunity Cost====
The most unusual feature in these reports is the [[opportunity cost]] of conflict – that is the economic benefits that could have been accrued had there not been conflicts in these countries or regions. According to the reports, countries in the Middle East that are directly involved in or affected by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, internal strife in Lebanon and the US invasion of Iraq have lost a $12 trillion (in 2006 dollar value) in opportunity costs from 1991 to 2010. In the case of Sri Lanka, SFG stated that Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) remained stagnant during periods of civil war and that net FDI increased during periods of ceasefire. In 2004, Strategic Foresight Group stated that India and Pakistan could achieve growth rates of 10% and 7% respectively, provided there is no major conflict, no global recession and effective resource and political management in the future.

==Thematic Cost of Conflict Reports==

===Africa's Missing Billions===
A report conducted by 3 international organizations in 2007 highlighted the heavy cost to development in Africa, due to ensuing conflicts in various countries. The report conducted by [[Oxfam International]], the [[International Action Network on Small Arms]] and [[Saferworld]] stated that 23 African countries were involved in one form of conflict or another between 1990 and 2005.

During these 15 years the cost of conflict in Africa was equivalent to the funds granted to the continent in international aid over the same period – both conflicts and aid from 1990-2005 amounted to $284 billion. In other words, the money lost in conflict could have been used in more effective ways, such as addressing the needs of education, clean water and sanitation and the prevention of harmful disease in African countries.&lt;ref&gt;Hillier, Debbie (11 October 2007). [http://www.oxfam.org.uk/resources/policy/conflict_disasters/bp107_africasmissingbillions.html "Africa's Missing Billions: International arms flows and the cost of conflict"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930204950/http://www.oxfam.org.uk/resources/policy/conflict_disasters/bp107_africasmissingbillions.html |date=2008-09-30 }}. Oxfam.org.    Oxfam International.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other facts included in the report: On average, armed conflict shrinks an African nation's economy by 15 percent. Conflicts are costing African economies an average of $18bn a year. Conflicts in countries like Burundi and Rwanda have cost their governments an annual economic loss of 37% and 32% of their GDP respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2007/10/200852513936102455.html |title=Africa aid swallowed up by conflict - Africa |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=11 October 2007  |accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===US War on Terror===
Several studies have been conducted on the economic costs of the US [[war on terror]], which began in 2001. These include studies by [[William Nordhaus]] in 2002, Wallsten &amp; Kosec in 2005 and successive studies by the US Congressional Budget Office (CBO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/ |title=Congressional Budget Office - Home Page |publisher=Cbo.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of these reports focus on the 2003 war in Iraq but the costs also involve the Bush administration's wider global war on terror as well.

The reports contain the cost of occupation – reconstruction &amp; security, diplomatic and military expenditure. The findings are compared to previous US wars in Vietnam and Korea. The studies also contain other areas where this money could have been spent more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,460007,00.html |title=Calculating the Cost of Conflict: War on Terror More Expensive Than Vietnam - SPIEGEL ONLINE |publisher=Spiegel.de |date=16 January 2007 |first=Yassin |last=Musharbash  |accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most famous study is one conducted by Harvard professor Linda Bilmes and Nobel Prize winner [[Joseph Stiglitz]]. While conventional estimates mark the economic cost for the US at $400 billion in 2007, the Stiglitz study on the 'War on Terror' estimates the total cost by 2015 at $1 trillion. This is because the report takes into account indirect costs such as disability pensions and the price of oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://threetrilliondollarwar.org/ |title=Three Trillion Dollar War |publisher=Three Trillion Dollar War |date= |accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2008 update, Stiglitz and his co-author Linda Bilmes published the book, [[The Three Trillion Dollar War|The Three Trillion Dollar War: The True Cost of the Iraq Conflict]], which describes additional hidden costs.

A new report dated 4 July 2011 by the Eisenhower Research Project based at Brown University's Watson Institute for International Studies estimates that nearly 10 years after the declaration of the War on Terror, the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan have killed at least 225,000 people, including men and women in uniform, contractors, and civilians. The wars will cost Americans between $3.2 and $4 trillion, including medical care and disability for current and future war veterans. The group's "Costs of War"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://costsofwar.org/ |title=Costs of War Project |publisher=Costsofwar.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; project, which involved more than 20 economists, anthropologists, lawyers, humanitarian personnel, and political scientists. The organization provides new estimates of the total war cost as well as other direct and indirect human and economic costs of the US military response to the 9/11 attacks. The $3.2- $4 trillion figure does not include substantial probable future interest on war-related debt.

The "Costs of War" report also includes other statistics such as deaths, injuries and displaced persons.  For instance, more than 31,000 people in uniform and military contractors have died, including the Iraqi and Afghan security forces and other military forces allied with the United States. By a very conservative estimate, 137,000 civilians have been killed in Iraq and Afghanistan by all parties to these conflicts. The wars have created more than 7.8 million refugees among Iraqis, Afghans, and Pakistanis.

Because the wars have been financed almost entirely by borrowing, $185 billion in interest has already been paid on war spending, and another $1 trillion could accrue in interest alone through 2020.Federal obligations to care for past and future veterans of these wars will likely total between $600–$950 billion.  This number is not included in most analyses of the costs of war and will not peak until mid-century.&lt;ref name="rediff1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/slide-show/slide-show-1-war-on-terror-cost-4-point-12-trillion-225000-dead/20110704.htm |title=War on Terror cost: $4.12 trillion, 225,000 dead - Rediff.com News |publisher=Rediff.com |date=2011-07-04 |accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results of the War in Afghanistan and Iraq==
While it was promised that the US invasions would bring democracy to both countries, Afghanistan and Iraq, both continue to rank low in global rankings of political freedom, with warlords continuing to hold power in Afghanistan with US support, and Iraqi communities more segregated today than before by gender and ethnicity as a result of the war.&lt;ref name="rediff1"/&gt;

===The human cost of conflict in the Philippines===
This study conducted by Amnesty International in 2008, measures the cost of conflict on a humanitarian scale. The report estimates a total of 120,000 deaths and a further 2 million displaced from the conflict over a period of 40 years. The report features individual accounts by some of the survivors of the conflict as well as aid workers and human rights activists and hence it takes a more qualitative approach to the costs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/the-human-cost-of-armed-conflict-in-the-philippines-20081029 "Philippines: Shattered Peace in Mindanao: The human cost of conflict in the Philippines"]. [[Amnesty International]]. 29 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Apartheid}}
'''''DRUM''''' is a South African family magazine mainly aimed at black readers containing market news, entertainment and feature articles. It has two sister magazines: ''[[Huisgenoot]]'' (aimed at White and Coloured [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]]-speaking readers) and ''[[YOU (South African magazine)|YOU]]'' (aimed at demographically diverse South African English-speaking readers of different ethnicities to inform, inspire and entertain them by offering its own brand of coverage on current events and interesting people).

In 2005 it was described as "the first black lifestyle magazine in Africa",&lt;ref name="swood"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://login.vnuemedia.com/hr/login/login_subscribe.jsp?id=qvdZ7L8TMtzmQHzJBuT%2F8TcVaaTL76%2B0%2FjJ0KihrMyoYRyRXvbyQE8m0DDTx7NBQvzdAaqzpefUw%0A83Z2mOn%2FrgXtoE3FGBhhIsQCcRr9XP04dzb0vbEcMB7uE7d9ClsT%2FbCj9r%2BurRTqnKBdGaYyIcVV%0Acb1XiiEfXxHfnvF9L1Ea6XuF20BK8wmctjjpnWUC9nmoKJSFQyY5AdnUwYOVHdzXlHjZzFhWq9nf%0AwvcPBiTJu725hgc18RCoQ3x2C9oa%2Fq179cV8ufiqS8xeH8fWfA%3D%3D|title=Drum Review|author=Sura Wood|date=4 November 2005|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=12 January 2009}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is noted chiefly for its early 1950s and 1960s reportage of [[Township (South Africa)|township]] life under [[apartheid]].

==History==
''Drum'' was started in 1951, as ''African Drum'' by former test cricketer and author [[Bob Crisp]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Drum Magazine|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/drum-magazine|accessdate=28 April 2016|work=[[South African History Project|SAHO]]|date=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James R. A. Bailey|Jim Bailey]] an ex-[[R.A.F.]] pilot, son of South African financier [[Abe Bailey|Sir Abe Bailey]].

Initially under Crisp's editorship, the magazine had a paternalistic, tribal representation of Africans,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/artsmediaculture/arts/media/drum.htm "A history of Drum Magazine"], South African History Online&lt;/ref&gt; but within a short time&lt;!-- How long, how many issues? --&gt; Crisp was replaced and the emphasis moved to the vibrant urban black townships.

The paper in its early years had a series of outstanding editors:
* [[Anthony Sampson]], 1951–55&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/dec/21/pressandpublishing.booksobituaries " Obituary, Anthony Sampson], 2004, ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sylvester Stein]], 1955–58&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sylvesterstein.com/about/about-4.html "Drum years"], www.sylvesterstein.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sir Tom Hopkinson]], 1958–?

Both Sampson and Stein wrote books about their times as editor, ''Drum: A Venture into the New Africa'' (1956, republished in 2005 as ''Drum: the making of a magazine'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uj.ac.za/EN/Library/Documents/Drum%20-%20the%20making%20of%20a%20magazine%20by%20Anthony%20Sampson.pdf "Drum : The Making of a Magazine by Anthony Sampson".]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Who Killed Mr Drum?'' (1999) respectively.

''Drum'''s heyday in the 1950s fell between the [[Defiance Campaign]] and the [[Sharpeville massacre|tragedy]] at [[Sharpeville]]. This was the decade of potential Black emergence, the decade when the [[Freedom Charter]] was written and the decade when the [[African National Congress|ANC]] alliance launched the Defiance Campaign. The aim was to promote an equal society. The Nationalist government responded with apartheid crackdowns and treason trials.

It was also the decade of the movement to the cities, of [[Sophiatown]], of [[Black jazz]], the jazz opera ''[[King Kong (1959 musical)|King Kong]]'' with a Black cast, an adoption of [[American culture]], of ''[[shebeens]]'' (illegal drinking dens) and flamboyant American style gangsters (''tsotsis'') with chrome-laden American cars who spoke a slang called [[Tsotsitaal]].

It was a time of optimism and hope. ''DRUM'' was a "record of naivety, optimism, frustration, defiance, courage, dancing, drink, jazz, gangsters, exile and death".&lt;ref name="A good-looking corpse"/&gt;

''DRUM'' described the world of the urban Black; the culture, the colour, dreams, ambitions, hopes and struggles. [[Lewis Nkosi]] described DRUM's young writers as "the new African[s] cut adrift from the tribal reserve – urbanised, eager, fast-talking and brash."&lt;ref name='Lewis Nkosi'&gt;{{cite news|title=Lewis Nkosi|url =http://www.answers.com/topic/lewis-nkosi|work =''answers.com''|accessdate=19 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Magubane]] described the atmosphere in the newsroom. "''DRUM'' was a different home; it did not have apartheid. There was no discrimination in the offices of ''DRUM'' magazine. It was only when you left ''DRUM'' and entered the world outside of the main door that you knew you were in apartheid land. But while you were inside ''DRUM'' magazine, everyone there was a family."&lt;ref name='Atmosphere'&gt;{{cite news|author=Peter Barlow|title=To the point with Peter Magubane|date=14 August 2006|url =http://ruactivate.wordpress.com/2006/08/14/to-the-point-with-peter-magubane/|work=Activate|accessdate=3 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''DRUM''′s stellar cast of Black journalists included such names as [[Henry Nxumalo|Henry ("Mr DRUM") Nxumalo]], [[Can Themba]], [[Todd Matshikiza]], [[Nat Nakasa]], Lewis Nkosi and others such as [[Bloke Modisane|William "Bloke" Modisane]], [[Arthur Maimane]], Stan Motjuwadi and [[Casey Motsisi]]. Together, they were known as "the ''DRUM'' Boys". This group lived by the dictum "live fast, die young and have a good-looking corpse".&lt;ref name="A good-looking corpse"&gt;{{cite book |author=Mike Nicol |title=A Good-Looking Corpse |publisher=Secker &amp; Warburg |location=London |year=1991 |pages= |isbn=0-436-30986-6 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these journalists went on to publish works in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;[[Can Themba]] wrote ''The Suit'' and a selection of his output appears in ''The World of Can Themba'', a selection of [[Nat Nakasa]]'s output appears in ''The World of Nat Nakasa'', Lewis Nkosi wrote ''Home and Exile'' and ''Mating Birds'' among others, [[Bloke Modisane]] wrote ''Blame Me on History '', [[Arthur Maimane]] wrote ''Hate No More'', and a selection of [[Casey Motsisi]]'s output appears in ''Casey &amp; Co ''. Refer to the individual entries for the ISBN numbers.&lt;/ref&gt; The other journalists who worked there include [[Bessie Head]],&lt;ref&gt;Almost all of Head's important work was written in [[Serowe]], in particular, the three Serowe novels ''When Rain Clouds Gather'', ''Maru'', and ''A Question of Power''. She also wrote short stories, including the collection ''The Collector of Treasures''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lionel Ngakane]],&lt;ref&gt;Ngakane is most remembered for his 1966 short film ''Jemima and Johnny'' inspired by riots in [[Notting Hill]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Rive]] and [[Jenny Joseph]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph's best known poem, ''Warning'', was written in 1961 and was included in her 1974 collection ''Rose in the Afternoon'' and in the ''[[Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not only the writers–the pictures were also important. The main photographer and artistic director was [[Jürgen Schadeberg]], who arrived in South Africa in 1950 after leaving a war-ravaged [[Berlin]]. He became one of the rare European photographers to photograph the daily lives of Black people. He trained a generation of rising black photographers, including [[Ernest Cole (photographer)|Ernest Cole]], [[Bob Gosani]] and later [[Peter Magubane]]. Magubane joined ''DRUM'' because "they were dealing with social issues that affected black people in South Africa. I wanted to be part of that magazine".&lt;ref name='Magubane'&gt;{{cite news|author=John Cook|title=One-Man Truth Squad |date=1 June 1997|url=https://www.motherjones.com/news/outfront/1997/05/truth.html|work =Mother Jones|accessdate=2 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alf Khumalo]] was another well-known photographer on the staff.

[[Henry Nxumalo]] was the first journalist and specialised in investigative reporting. For example, he got a job on a potato farm where he exposed the exploitative conditions (almost slave-like) under which the Black labourers worked. In 1957, Nxumalo was murdered while investigating an abortion racket.&lt;ref name='Nzumalo - death'&gt;{{cite news|title=Henry 'Mr DRUM' Nxumalo (1917–1957)|date=29 September 2005|url=http://www.info.gov.za/aboutgovt/orders/2005/nxumalo.htm|work=National Orders awards|accessdate=27 February 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930160204/http://www.info.gov.za/aboutgovt/orders/2005/nxumalo.htm|archivedate=30 September 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His story was the basis for the 2004 film ''[[Drum (2004 film)|Drum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379765/maindetails "DRUM (2004)"], at IMDB.&lt;/ref&gt;

Todd Matshikiza wrote witty and informed jazz articles about the burgeoning township jazz scene.

Dolly (the agony aunt) helped many a confused, young lover to get their lives back on course. The "Dear Dolly" letters were written by [[Dolly Rathebe]], a popular actress, pin-up and singer. In reality, they were ghosted by other ''DRUM'' writers, notably [[Casey Motsisi]].

Arthur Maimane, under the pseudonym Arthur Mogale, wrote a regular series entitled "The Chief" where he described gangster incidents he had heard about in the shebeens. [[Don Mattera]], a leading Sophiatown gangster, took exception to this. "The gangsters were pissed off with him and there was a word out that we should wipe this guy off."&lt;ref name="A good-looking corpse"/&gt;

The office telephonist, [[David Sibeko]], became leader of the [[Pan-African Congress]].&lt;ref name='Guardian Unlimited'&gt;{{cite news|author=Denis Herbstein| title=Arthur Maimane|date=15 July 2005|url=https://www.theguardian.com/southafrica/story/0,,1528877,00.html|work =[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=19 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''DRUM'' also encouraged fiction. [[Es'kia Mphahlele]] (the fiction editor from 1955 to 1957) encouraged and guided this. During that time over 90 short stories were published by such authors as Todd Matshikiza, Bloke Modisane, Henry Nxumalo, Casey Motsisi, Arthur Maimane (alias Mogale), Lewis Nkosi, Nat Nakasa, Can Themba and others. These stories described the people of the street; jazz musicians, gangsters, shebeen queens and con men and were written in a uniquely Sophiatown-influenced blend of English and [[Tsotsitaal]]. This creative period has been called the ''[[Sophiatown renaissance]]''.&lt;ref name='Sophiatown renaissance'&gt;{{cite news | first=Ntongela | last=Masilela | author2=University of California | title=Black South African literature from the ‘Sophiatown Renaissance' to ‘Black Mamba Rising': Transformations and Variations from the 1950s to the 1980s | date=30 April 1990 | url=http://www.pitzer.edu/new_african_movement/general/essays/nxumalo.htm | work=Center for Black Studies | accessdate=23 May 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403122338/http://www.pitzer.edu/New_African_Movement/general/essays/nxumalo.htm | archivedate=3 April 2007 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The backbone of the magazine was crime, investigative reporting, sex (especially if across the colour line) and sport. This was fleshed out by imaginative photography.

The formula worked and made for compulsive reading. Each issue of ''DRUM'' was read by up to 9 people, passed from hand to hand on the streets, in the clubs or on the trains. It became a symbol of Black urban life. 240,000 copies were distributed each month across Africa.&lt;ref name="DRUM Beat"&gt;{{cite news|title=DRUM Beat in Africa|date=7 September 1959|url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,825925-1,00.html|work =Time|accessdate=28 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was more than any other African magazine.

''DRUM'' was distributed in 8 different countries: [[Union of South Africa]], [[Central African Federation]], [[Kenya]], [[Tanganyika]], [[Uganda]], [[Ghana]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Sierra Leone]].&lt;ref name="DRUM Beat" /&gt;

Sadly, because of the immovable force of apartheid the promise and dreams it described turned to frustration and despair. In 1955 [[Sophiatown, Gauteng|Sophiatown]] was bulldozed and the writers died or went overseas,&lt;ref&gt;[[Can Themba]] died of alcohol-related complications in exile in [[Swaziland]], [[Todd Matshikiza]] died in exile in [[Zambia]], [[Nat Nakasa]] committed suicide in New York City and Bloke Modisane died in exile in [[West Germany]]&lt;/ref&gt; and "...The creative output of the Sophiatown Renaissance came to an end as the bulldozers rolled in...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Essop Patel (ed.) |title=The World of Nat Nakasa: Selected Writings of the Late Nat Nakasa (Staffrider Series, No. 27)|publisher=Ravan Press|isbn= 0-86975-050-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later ownership==
By May 1965 ''DRUM'' had faded and became simply a fortnightly supplement to the ''Golden City Post'',&lt;ref&gt;Les Switzer (ed.), ''South Africa's Alternative Press: voices of protest and resistance, 1880s-1960s'', Cambridge University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; another Bailey property. It was revived in 1968. In 1984 [[Naspers]] acquired DRUM Publications, the publisher of [[City Press (South Africa)|City Press]], ''DRUM'' and ''True Love &amp; Family''.

''DRUM'' now claims to be the sixth largest magazine in Africa.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2566">'''Eduardo Comín Colomer''' (1908–1975) was a Spanish Catholic essayist and journalist. He was known for his anti-Masonic and anticommunist views.

==Education and career==
Eduardo Comín Colomer was a police officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/fichero_articulo?codigo=124685&amp;orden=74246 |title='&amp;#39;Masonería y periodismo en la historia de España'&amp;#39;, Juan José Morales Ruiz, p.129 |date= |accessdate=2012-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a fund of books from his collection on the [[Spanish Civil War]] and [[Freemasonry]] at the [[National Library of Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/fichero_articulo?codigo=1074816&amp;orden=0 |title='&amp;#39;Fondo masónico "Comín Colomer" de la Biblioteca Nacional'&amp;#39;, por José Antonio Ferrer Benimeli |date= |accessdate=2012-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://servicios.bne.es/productos/MemoriaHistorica/13-colomer.htm ''COLECCIÓN COMÍN COLOMER'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Colomer worked as a journalist at a young age, obtaining his qualifications at the Official School of Journalism in [[Madrid]] in 1949. He was a correspondent, editor and contributor to numerous Spanish newspapers.

He belonged to the Police Force, becoming director of its School. His membership in this body allowed him privileged access to reports, documents and files, so much so that one of the important documentary sources available to the National Library of Spain is specifically ''Fondo Comin'' (Comín Fund), bequeathed by his widow in 1975 and consists of more than 15,000 documents, including books and pamphlets, mostly relating to the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Republic]], the Civil War and Freemasonry.

'''Enfield''' is a [[New England town|town]] in [[Hartford County]], [[Connecticut]], United States. The population was 44,654 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].&lt;ref name="Census 2010"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/0600000US0900325990| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Enfield town, Hartford County, Connecticut| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=November 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is bordered by [[Longmeadow, Massachusetts]] and [[East Longmeadow, Massachusetts]], to the north, [[Somers, Connecticut|Somers]] to the east, [[East Windsor, Connecticut|East Windsor]] and [[Ellington, Connecticut|Ellington]] to the south, and the [[Connecticut River]] (towns of [[Suffield, Connecticut|Suffield]] and [[Windsor Locks, Connecticut|Windsor Locks]]) to the west.

==History==
Enfield was originally inhabited by the [[Pocomtuc]] tribe, and contained their two villages of Scitico and Nameroke. Though land grants were first granted in 1674, no one attempted to settle what is known as Enfield until 1679 when the Pease Brothers of Robert and John II, settlers from [[Salem, Massachusetts]] came in to settle the fertile lands. They dug a shelter into a bill and camped there for the winter until their families came to help them build houses. In 1675, a sawmill owned by William Pynchon II was burned in the wake of [[King Phillip's War]]. The first town meeting was held on August 14, 1679 and a committee of five were appointed by men from [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]] as it was the parent town at the time. Enfield was incorporated in Massachusetts on May 16, 1683 as the Freshwater Plantation. The same day as the town of [[Stow, Massachusetts]], making them the 52nd/53rd towns in the Colony. The namesake is the Freshwater Brook (Also known as the Asnuntuck Brook) that triverses the town. Five years later, on March 16, 1688, the townspeople purchased Enfield from a Podunk named Notatuck for 25 pounds Sterling.  It is unclear what claim Notatuck actually had to the land, or whether he was selling the land or the rights to use it. Shortly around 1700, the town changed its name to Enfield after [[Enfield Town]] in [[Middlesex]], and to go with the other fields in the area such as [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], [[Westfield, Massachusetts|Westfield]], and [[Suffield, Connecticut|Suffield]].

In 1734, the eastern part of town separated into the town of [[Somers, Connecticut|Somers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Chauncey Pease|title=The History of Enfield, Connecticut|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=byBEAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA18|accessdate=21 May 2018|date=1900|publisher=Wickersham Printing Company|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1749, following the settlement of a lawsuit in which it was determined that a surveyor's error placed a section of present-day Hartford County (including Enfield) within the boundaries of Massachusetts, the town [[secession|seceded]] and became part of Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bob Clark|title=Enfield Connecticut: Stories Carved in Stone|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZKAm2Eu8mJYC&amp;pg=PA14|accessdate=22 September 2010|date=18 December 2006|publisher=Dog Pond Press|isbn=978-0-9755362-5-4|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] preached his famous sermon, "[[Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God]]", in Enfield. It was part of the [[First Great Awakening|Great Awakening]] revival that struck New England in the mid-18th century and spread throughout Western North American civilization.

The modern town of Enfield was formed through the merging of Enfield, [[Thompsonville, Connecticut|Thompsonville]], and [[Hazardville, Connecticut|Hazardville]], named for Colonel [[Augustus George Hazard]] (1802–1868), whose company manufactured [[gunpowder]] in the Powder Hollow area of the town from the 1830s to the 1910s. In the 1989 film ''[[Glory (1989 film)|Glory]]'', boxes of gunpowder can be seen with the words ''Enfield, CT'' printed on the sides. In an episode in the 1970s police drama ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', Jack Lord's character Steve McGarrett traces explosives back to "The Hazard Gunpowder Company- Enfield, CT".  The capacity of the mill at the time of the Civil War was {{convert|1200|lb}} per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Bob Clark| title=Enfield Connecticut: Stories Carved in Stone| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZKAm2Eu8mJYC&amp;pg=PA5| accessdate=22 September 2010| date=18 December 2006| publisher=Dog Pond Press| isbn=978-0-9755362-5-4| pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 60 people died in explosions in Powder Hollow during the years when gunpowder was manufactured there. The mill blew up several times, but was set up so that if one building blew up, the rest would not follow in a chain reaction. The ruins of these buildings and the dams are open to the public. Powder Hollow is now home to baseball fields and hiking trails.

In 1972, [[Asnuntuck Community College]] was established in Enfield as the twelfth institution in the Connecticut State Colleges and Universities system (CSCU). Classes began in 1972 with an initial enrollment of 251, and 12 Associate in Science degrees and 20 Associate of Art degrees were awarded to the first graduating class in 1974.

There are five sections of the town of Enfield. Enfield Village, Thompsonville, Hazardville, Scitico, and Sherwood Village.



===Enfield Shaker village===
[[File:Enfield CT Shakers.jpg|thumb|left|[[Enfield Shaker Historic District (Connecticut)|Enfield Shaker village]] c. 1910]]
In 1793, a historic [[Shaker]] village, [[Enfield Shaker Historic District (Connecticut)|Enfield Shaker village]], one of nineteen scattered from [[Maine]] to [[Kentucky]], was established in the town. The [[Utopia]]n religious [[sect]] practiced [[celibacy|celibate]], [[communal]] living, and is today renowned for its simple [[architecture]] and [[furniture]].  Membership eventually dwindled, however, and the village disbanded.  The property has since been redeveloped by the Enfield Correctional Institution, still located on Shaker Road.

==Industry==
Enfield is home to the U.S. headquarters of Danish plastic building toy manufacturer [[Lego]], which was also the town's largest employer. [[Hallmark Cards]] was the town's second-largest employer. It is now closed, having sent all distribution to Kansas City in 2016.

Enfield was once the home to the headquarters of the [[Casual Corner]] clothing company.

Formerly and most notably, Enfield had booming [[carpet]] and [[gunpowder]] industries.  Orrin Thompson set up shop for the [[Bigelow-Sanford Carpet Co.]] in the Thompsonville section of town, employing many [[Scottish people|Scottish]] immigrants and building housing for them, which still stand today.

The [[gunpowder]] industry was founded by Colonel Augustus Hazard.  Hazard was instrumental in implementing water power and other technologies to allow his business to prosper.  Hazard's company was among the biggest gunpowder suppliers for the [[American Civil War]].

Enfield was the headquarters of Pilch Meat Breeders, which was once the second-largest [[broiler]] [[broiler industry|breeder]] in the world. The company was founded by Chester Pilch in 1936, and sold in 1969 to [[DeKalb Genetics Corporation|DeKalb Agricultural Research Corp]]. At its peak, Pilch owned 230 acres in Enfield, had farms in four countries, and produced about 24 million chickens a year. DeKalb moved the operation to North Carolina, taking 365 jobs from Enfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.courant.com/1997-12-13/news/9712130351_1_chicken-business-breeding-windsor-bank | title=Chester Pilch Dies | publisher=Hartford Courant | date=December 13, 1997 | accessdate=31 December 2013 | author=Navarro Alejandra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neighborhoods==
The neighborhoods of Enfield are:

"Crescent Lake"-Borders scenic farmland.  It is in close proximity to both the minimum and maximum correctional facilities.  This small friendly neighborhood holds an annual July 4 parade.

'''Enfield Historical District'''- Listed in the [[National Register of Historical Places]], the [[Enfield Historic District]] runs along Enfield Street/King Street ([[U.S. Route 5]]).  Many old homes dating back to the mid-18th century were built from 1106-1492 Enfield Street.  Varying [[styles of architecture]] are noted including [[Victorian Architecture|Late Victorian]], [[Georgian Architecture|Georgian]] and [[Colonial Revival|19th Century Revival]].  The [[Enfield Town Meetinghouse|Enfield Town Hall museum]] as well as a fine Greek Revival [[Congregational Church]] can be found here.

'''[[Hazardville, Connecticut|Hazardville]]''' – Named after Colonel Augustus Hazard, this neighborhood encompasses a few smaller burbs, including Powder Hollow, and more recently, the center of Enfield began to encroach on this historical area.  The center of Hazardville is located between the streets of Park Street and North Street on Hazard Avenue. Notable small shops include The Connecticut Valley Tobacconist, Gayle's Thyme Herbal Apothecary, The Cranberry Scoop Gift Shop, Smoke n' Leather, and numerous pizzerias. The Powder Hollow Park is located in the Hazardville neighborhood district.

'''North Thompsonville''' – Contains mostly residential and partially commercial areas of Enfield with many parks and schools.

'''Presidential Section''' – This entirely residential area contain streets that are all named after former presidents of the United States. Houses are mid-sized to large in this area.
[[File:Clinton rd.jpg|thumb|right|Presidential Section]]
'''Scitico''' – located in the eastern end of town.  Green Manor is considered part of Scitico.  This is a suburb in the purest sense, with winding roads, sidewalks, a park, and cul-de-sacs. Green Manor is approximately {{convert|4.5|mi}} from the main highway Interstate 91 and borders the town of [[Somers, Connecticut|Somers]].  Across from Nathan Hale Elementary School is a residential park with tennis court, skate boarding ramps, and a playground for younger kids.  Green Manor Park contained a pool at one time but was removed due to the lack of maintenance by the town.

'''Shaker Pines''' – This neighborhood consists mostly of quaint lakeside houses with tall pine trees towering overhead.  Shaker Pines was originally part of the Shaker settlement in Enfield.  The lake was built by the Shakers to power a mill.  The mill stood vacant by the dam at the end of the lake, until it was dismantled in the 1980s.  This mill provided shelter for Frederick Merrill in 1987 after he escaped from the local high security prison.  He was dubbed "The Peanut Butter Bandit" after his mother sneaked him supplies for his first prison escape in 1968 in a jar of [[peanut butter]].

'''[[Sherwood Manor, Connecticut|Sherwood Manor]]'''

[[File:Thompsonville.jpg|thumb|right|Thompsonville Village]]
'''[[Southwood Acres]]''' – A residential neighborhood in the south part of town.

'''[[Thompsonville, Connecticut|Thompsonville]]''' – Named after Orrin Thompson, Thompsonville is the town center of Enfield with a more urban environment.

'''FF Meta''' is a [[sans-serif#Classification|humanist]] [[sans-serif]] [[typeface]] family designed by [[Erik Spiekermann]] and released in 1991{{sfn|Sweet|1999|p=17}} through his [[FontFont]] library.  According to Spiekermann, FF Meta was intended to be a "complete antithesis of [[Helvetica]]", which he found "boring and bland".{{sfn|Sweet|1999|p=16}} It originated from an unused commission for the [[Deutsche Bundespost]] (German Post Office). Throughout the 1990s, FF Meta was embraced by the international design community{{sfn|Sweet|1999|p=16}} with Spiekermann and E. M. Ginger writing that it had been dubiously praised as the ''Helvetica of the 1990s''.{{sfn|Spiekermann|Ginger|2003|p=67}}

FF Meta has been adopted by numerous corporations and other organizations as a corporate typeface, for signage or in their logo. These include [[Imperial College London]], [[The Weather Channel]], [[Free Tibet]], [[Herman Miller (manufacturer)|Herman Miller]], [[Zimmer Holdings]], [[Mozilla Corporation]], [[Mozilla Foundation]], [[Schaeffler Group]] and [[Fort Wayne International Airport]].&lt;ref name="Using the right font"&gt;{{cite web|title=Using the right font|url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/graphicidentity/applyingthegraphicidentity/usingtherightfont|publisher=Imperial College London|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Hull]] uses FF Meta Serif alongside FF Meta.&lt;ref name="Typography - Print - University of Hull"&gt;{{cite web|title=Typography|url=http://www2.hull.ac.uk/administration/marketing/rebranding/basicdesignelements/typography.aspx|publisher=University of Hull|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald Trump]] used FF Meta initially as his primary campaign typeface before choosing [[Mike Pence]] as his vice presidential running mate. After Pence was chosen, Trump switched to Montserrat, a free typeface that is part of the [[Google Fonts]] library.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Visually distinctive characteristics==
Characteristics of this typeface are: 

;Lower case
*Round dot over the letter ''i'' and ''j''.
[[Image:Meta-Schriftprobe.png|thumb|300px|Samples of FF Meta]]
*Ends of the letter ''s'' are nearly horizontal
*Curved bottom of ''l'', making it clearly different to a 1 or upper-case ''i''.
*Double-storey ''a'' with a very open aperture at the top.
*Not fully closed bottom loop in binocular ''g''.
*Bend to the left at the top of the letters ''b'', ''h'', ''k'',  ''l''.
*Bend to the right at the top of the letter ''d''.
*A very distinctive y where the two strokes do not join smoothly.

;Upper case
*Angled letter ''M'', more resembling Futura or an upturned ''W'' than Helvetica or Gill Sans
*Slanted upper terminal on the top right of ''E'', ''T'' and ''F''. E and T are not symmetrical.

A general feature of FF Meta is relatively open [[aperture (typography)|apertures]], in contrast to the more folded-up appearance of Helvetica. This is believed to promote legibility and make the letterforms more clearly different from one another.

==Development==
Development began in February 1985{{sfn|Sweet|1999|p=17}} when Deutsche Bundespost approached [[Sedley Place|Sedley Place Design]], where Spiekermann was working at the time, and commissioned a comprehensive corporate design program. As the typeface would be used repeatedly in small sizes, for identification (rather than [[copy (written)|copy]]), require two different [[Font#Weight|weights]], and printed quickly on potentially poor paper stock, the brief called for a very legible, neutral, space-saving, and distinguishable (in regards to weight) typeface with special attention to producing unmistakable characters.{{sfn|Spiekermann|1987|p=6}} Whereas traditionally, typefaces are designed to be viewed beautifully large, the goal with this particular typeface was to produce a typeface which worked well for its primary application.{{sfn|Spiekermann|1987|p=7}}

Taking into account research done on six font families and the constraints of the brief, the characteristics of what would become FF Meta began to take shape. The typeface would have to be a sans-serif to match the client, [[Font#Width|narrow]] (but not [[Font#Width|condensed]]) to save space, feature strokes thick enough to withstand uneven printing but also light so that individual characters do not run together, contain clearly distinguishable glyphs for similarly shaped characters, versatile capitals and figures that are clear but not obtrusive, and curves, indentations, flares, and open joins to combat poor definition, optical illusions, and over-inking. In addition to these demands, to meet Bundespost's needs, the family would also contain three fonts: regular, regular italic, and bold.{{sfn|Spiekermann|1987|p=7}} The typeface is particularly similar to [[Syntax (typeface)|Syntax]], one of Spiekermann's candidate typefaces.

After completing and digitizing the typesetting font, [[mockup]]s were generated for Bundespost's new forms and publication. However, despite positive interest from the German Minister of Telecommunications among others,{{sfn|Spiekermann|1987|p=9}} Bundespost decided not to implement{{sfn|Sweet|1999|p=17}} the new exclusive typeface for fear it would "cause unrest".{{sfn|Spiekermann|1987|p=9}} Bundespost, despite funding the project, continued instead to use a variety of different versions of Helvetica (before changing them to [[Frutiger (typeface)|Frutiger]]). Spiekermann wrote an article on the abandoned design for [[Baseline (magazine)|Baseline magazine]] in 1986. At this time Meta was called PT55 (for the regular weight) and PT75 (bold).

== Releases ==
[[File:The Weather Channel logo 2005-present.svg|thumb|The Weather Channel logo, using FF Meta]]

Years later, realizing that Bundespost and Sedley Place Design would never utilize the typeface, Spiekermann with his company [[MetaDesign]] decided to continue work on the typeface and eventually published it—along with other orphaned typefaces{{sfn|Sweet|1999|p=13}}—under his newly formed publishing label [[FontFont]] resulting in the release of FF Meta in 1991.{{sfn|Sweet|1999|p=17}} This version of FF Meta was created by re-digitizing the original outlines and digitizing them in [[Fontographer]] on a [[Macintosh]], work which was done by Spiekermann’s interns Just van Rossum and [[Erik van Blokland]] between 1988-1989.{{sfn|Spiekermann|1987|p=9}}

* 1991 FF Meta family released containing normal, normal small caps, and bold.{{sfn|Peters|2005}}
* 1992 FF Meta 2 released as an expansion adding an italics weight, and small caps for bold.{{sfn|Peters|2005}}
* 1993 FF MetaPlus released featuring some fine tuning of characters, spacing, and kerning along with the introducing three new weights: book, medium, and black in roman, italics, roman small caps, and roman small caps italics except for black which lacked small caps.{{sfn|Peters|2005}}
* 1998 FF Meta reorganized and released with the following families: FF Meta Normal, FF Meta Book, FF Meta Medium, FF Meta Bold and FF Meta Black, all in roman, italic, small caps and italic small caps, which came with their respective expert and lining figures.{{sfn|Peters|2005}}
* Sometime before 2005 foreign language versions by [[Tagir Safayev]] and [[Olga Chayeva]].,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = FF Meta at ParaType | url = http://www.paratype.com/pstore/fonts/FF-Meta.htm |work=ParaType Shop|publisher=ParaType|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731200828/http://www.paratype.com/pstore/fonts/FF-Meta.htm|archivedate=2008-07-31|quote=Cyrillic versions were developed for ParaType in 2001 by Tagir Safayev and Olga Chayeva.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a condensed family, and additional light weights were added as: FF Meta Light, FF Meta Thin, and FF Meta Hairline.{{sfn|Peters|2005}}
* 2007 A serif companion, entitled FF Meta Serif, was completed and released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hallmundur|first1=Aegir|title=Meta Serif review|url=http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/ff-meta-serif/|website=Typographica|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2011 A Hebrew version was released.{{sfn|FontFont|2011|id=FontFont2011}}
* 2013 [[Fira Sans]], a free derivative for [[Mozilla]]'s [[Firefox OS]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1889">The '''Federation of Russian Canadians''' is a left-leaning cultural organization for [[Russians|Russian]] immigrants to Canada and their descendants.

It is the successor of the Russian Farmer-Worker Clubs which were closed by the government at the beginning of [[World War II]] as a suspected [[subversive]] organization due to its links with the [[Communist Party of Canada]]. In 1942, after the [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi invasion of the USSR]], the organization reappeared as the Federation of Russian Canadians, known also by its Russian initials as the FRK.&lt;ref name=ce&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1SEC907478 Russians], ''Canadian Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; 

At its height, the FRK had 15 branches across Canada and published a newspaper, ''Vestnik''. In 1944, the organization had around 4,000 members but, as a result of the [[Cold War]] and the defection of [[Igor Gouzenko]] that number fell to 2,709 by 1949. In the late 1980s the group had less than 800 members.&lt;ref name=ce/&gt; 

While ''Vestnik'' ceased publication in 1994, the FRK still has community centres in Toronto and Vancouver.

The FRK organized some 15 branches in various Canadian cities and published the newspaper Vestnik (Herald), long the only Russian newspaper in Canada.&lt;ref name=ce/&gt;

The FRK was associated with the [[Labor-Progressive Party]] and was affiliated with the [[Canadian Peace Congress]].

The so-called '''''Fojnica Armorial''''' ([[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]] ''{{lang|hbs|Fojnički grbovnik/Фојнички грбовник}}'', also known as ''{{lang|hbs|Ilirski grbovnik}}'' "Illyrian armorial") is an early modern [[roll of arms]] including heraldry of South Slavic history. The manuscript is named after the [[Franciscan monastery in Fojnica]] where it was kept.

==Dating==
*The presence of the manuscript in the Fojnica monastery is first attested in the year 1800.{{cn|date=March 2015}}
*[[Alexander Soloviev (historian)|Alexander Soloviev]] dated it to in between 1675 and 1688, i.e. in the context of the revolts against [[History of Ottoman Serbia|Ottoman rule]] during the [[Great Turkish War]].
*Other scholars{{who|date=March 2015}} have proposed dates of the late 16th or early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Sima M. Ćirković, ''The Serbs'',  Wiley-Blackwell, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-631-20471-8}}, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; The title page of the armorial itself [[pseudepigraphy|purports]] a creation date of  1340.

==Importance==
The manuscript is an important source of the classical [[heraldry]] of the Balkans peninsula, alongside the [[Korenić-Neorić Armorial]] of 1595, and the "Illyrian Armorial" (Society of Antiquaries of London MS.54) collected by [[Edward Bourchier, 4th Earl of Bath]] before 1637.

==Roll==
The manuscript contains a total of 139 coats of arms. It begins with a depiction of the ''[[Theotokos|Bogorodica]]'', saints [[Cosmas and Damian]],  and [[Saint Jerome]]. There follows a title page, written in Cyrillic, which attributes the work to one Stanislav Rubčić, in honour of King [[Stefan Dušan]], with the date 1340. There is an added note in Latin, dated 1800, which testifies that the manuscript had been kept in Fojnica monastery "from time immemorial". Then there is as page showing a combined coat of arms consisting of eleven parts. After this, there are ten coats of arms of late medieval realms of the region, [[Macedonia (theme)|Macedonia]] (''Macedoniae''),  "[[Illyrism|Illyria]]" (''Vllvriae''),  [[Kingdom of Bosnia|Bosnia]] (''Bosnae''), [[Medieval Dalmatian principalities|Dalmatia]] (''Dalmatie''), [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Croatia]] (''Crovatiae''), [[Banovina of Slavonia|Slavonia]] (''Slavoniae''), [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] (''Bvlgariae''), [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbia]] (''Svrbiae''),  [[Rascia]] (''Rasciae'') and "Primordia" (''Primordiae''), followed by coats of arms of noble families.

Placing a severed '''head on a spike''' (or pike or pole) is a custom used sometimes in [[human history]] and in culture. The [[Symbol|symbolic value]] may change over time. It may give a warning to spectators. The head may be a human head or an animal head.

'''The Houston Galveston Institute''' is a non-profit organization that offers a method of collaborative counseling and postmodern therapy to individuals, families and communities of all socioeconomic backgrounds.  The Institute is strongly associated with [[collaborative language systems]] (or [[Collaborative Therapy]]), a type of [[postmodern]] therapy that works with clients within a cooperative partnership that holds their expertise in high regard, and that encourages them to access their own natural resources to develop solutions to their problems. The Houston Galveston Institute is a sponsor of the International Journal of Collaborative Practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collaborative-practices.com/ |title=International Journal of Collaborative Practices |publisher=Collaborative-practices.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The beginnings of the Houston Galveston Institute date back to the 1950s at the [[University of Texas Medical Branch]] in [[Galveston]], [[Texas]] with the federally funded family therapy project to research the Multiple Impact Theory.  In 1978, the Galveston Family Institute was established by [[Harlene Anderson]], Ph.D., [[Paul Dell]], Ph.D., [[Harold Goolishian]], Ph.D. and [[George Pulliam]], M.S.W. to meet the demands of mental health professionals seeking to increase their understanding of families and further develop their skills in systems-oriented therapy with individuals, couples, families and groups.  From this group, the ideas of Collaborative Language System Theory emerged.  The institute officially became the Houston Galveston Institute in the 1990s when the project expanded beyond Galveston. Other contributors are Diane Gehart, Sue Levin, Diana Carleton, Lynn Hoffmann, [[Tom Andersen]], Vivien Burr, John Cromby, [[Kenneth Gergen]], [[Mary Gergen]], Lois Holzman, Imelda McCarthy, Susan McDaniel, Sheila McNamee, Robert Neimeyer, David Nightingale, Peggy Penn, Sallyann Roth, Jaakko Seikkula, John Shotter, Lois Shawver, and Michael White.

==Collaborative approach==
This type of approach formed at Houston Galveston Institute takes the unique stance that “problems are not solved, but dissolved in language.” &lt;ref&gt;''The client is the expert''; Anderson &amp; Goolishian. (1992).  In K. Gergen &amp; S. McNamee (Eds.) Therapy as Social Construction. Thousand Oaks, California: Sage Publications&lt;/ref&gt; [[Collaborative therapy]] is now recognized as one of the current schools of [[family therapy]] and is included in graduate school textbooks.  Some of the general philosophic assumptions of the theory are:
* Maintaining Skepticism – A critical attitude about how knowledge is ‘known’
* Eluding Generalizations – Avoid the dominant discourse
* Knowledge as an Interactive Social Process – Dialectic, conversational knowledge
* Privileging Local Knowledge – Persons and communities know themselves
* Language as a Creative Social Process – Language creates our knowledge
* Knowledge and Language as Transforming – Conversations change people
* [[Postmodern]] is only One of Many Narratives – One of many languages
These assumptions are post-modern in nature and inform the clinical practice of the [[Collaborative Therapy]] approach. The following list is of the various impacts that these assumptions have on the therapist and therapeutic relationship. 
* Mutually Inquiring Conversational Partnership – Therapy as a partnership
* Relational Expertise – Client and therapist bring their expertise together
* Not-Knowing – Humility before the client
* Being Public – Therapist is open with their invisible thoughts
* Living with Uncertainty – Enjoy the spontaneity of a conversation
* Mutually Transforming – [[Hermeneutic]] circle, reciprocal effect on client and therapist
* Orienting towards Everyday Ordinary Life – Tap into natural resilience of clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harleneanderson.org/CollaborativeTherapyArticleMarch2009.htm |title=Collaborative Practice |publisher=Harleneanderson.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912150103/http://www.harleneanderson.org/CollaborativeTherapyArticleMarch2009.htm |archivedate=2010-09-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Collaborative therapy shares similar [[epistemological]] roots with [[Narrative Therapy]] and [[Solution-focused therapy]].  These therapies are similar, yet distinct.  An article by Gehart &amp; Paré summarizes the differences between the therapies in the following way: “In collaborative language systems, the “dis-solving” of problems through conversation (Anderson &amp; Goolishian, 1988; Goolishian &amp; Anderson, 1992), in narrative therapy, reauthoring one’s story about the problem (White 2004; White &amp; Epston, 1990), and in solution-focused therapy (SFT), building solutions (Berg, 1994; de Shazer, 1994; Lipchik, 2002)” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Sociopolitical activist or conversational partner?

==Current practice==
The Houston Galveston Institute currently is involved in the use of the Collaborative Approach in training, counseling and researching.  The office is located in [[Houston]]’s [[museum district]] and is serving the [[community]] needs while training students from local, national and international programs.  HGI also provides various training programs for mental health professionals who want to develop a collaborative and postmodern approach to therapeutic work with individuals, couples, families, groups, organizations and community.

==International and national affiliates==
The Institute currently offers an [[International Certificate in Collaborative Practices]] program with participation around the world.  The program is sponsored by the Houston Galveston Institute and the [[Taos Institute]].  It is a response to the numerous practitioners around the world who are interested in expanding their knowledge and competency in collaborative practice. The Certificate Program provides practitioners across disciplines—therapy, organization development, education and research—an intensive, in-depth study of collaborative practices based on postmodern-social construction philosophy. The Program includes the study of the theoretical and philosophical assumptions and their application to practice in a variety of contexts and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collaborativecertificate.org/Houston_Galveston_Instit.html |title=Houston Galveston Instit |publisher=Collaborativecertificate.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120723103847/http://www.collaborativecertificate.org/Houston_Galveston_Instit.html |archivedate=2012-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program is offered in [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]], [[China]], [[Mexico]], [[United States]], and [[Canada]]. In 2009, the International Journal of Collaborative Practices was founded in order to publish the collaborative works developing worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collaborative-practices.com/ |title=International Journal of Collaborative Practices |publisher=Collaborative-practices.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oil platform in the North Sea.jpg|thumb|200px|An oil drilling rig in the North Sea]]
"'''It's Scotland's oil'''" was a widely publicised political slogan used by the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) during the 1970s in making their economic case for [[Scottish independence]]. It was argued that the discovery of [[North Sea oil]] off the coast of [[Scotland]], and the revenue that it created would not benefit Scotland to any significant degree while Scotland remained part of the [[United Kingdom]].
The SNP campaigned widely in both the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 UK General Election]] and subsequent [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October 1974 UK General Election]] using this slogan. At the February election the SNP gained seven seats in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and 22% of the Scottish vote, rising to eleven seats and 30% of the vote in the October election. The idea behind the slogan has proven to be controversial in discussions surrounding the financial viability of an independent Scottish state and still resonates to this day.&lt;ref&gt;''Scotland's oil: Does oil in Scotland have a future?'' [http://www.eisourcebook.org/cms/Jan%202013/UK,%20Does%20Oil%20in%20Scotland%20have%20a%20future.pdf Professor Thomas W Walde - Thomas Walde Professor of International Economic Energy and Natural Resources Law at the University of Dundee]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The outcome of the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 General Election]] saw the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], led by [[Harold Wilson]], win the most seats. [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Edward Heath]], leader of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], lost support from the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] and, although he entered coalition negotiations with [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] leader [[Jeremy Thorpe]], these broke down. The Labour Party then formed the new government, with a plurality of seats but without a majority. In [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October 1974]], Wilson went back to the country to ask for a renewed mandate.

During this time, in Scotland support for the Scottish National Party had been increasing after the victory of the SNP candidate [[Winnie Ewing]] at the [[Hamilton by-election, 1967|1967 Hamilton by-election]]. The political instability surrounding the general elections of 1974 represented a time of intense political campaigning in the UK, which further brought the SNP to prominence. It was during this time that the slogan "It's Scotland's Oil" came to the fore with the February election seeing 7 SNP candidates returned, rising to 11 in October. Some well known MPs such as [[Tam Dalyell]] believe this was in no small part due to the "It's Scotland's oil" slogan employed by the [[Scottish National Party]].&lt;ref&gt;''Independent Online edition December 2005'' [http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article331945.ece Tam Dalyell, who served as Labour MP in West Lothian for 43 years, agrees.... "It could have tipped the balance it a number of seats including mine. Oil was very much a totemic issue"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051212171256/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article331945.ece |date=2005-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic background to the claim was the discovery of oil in the [[North Sea]] in the 1960s, and its coming on line in the 1970s. The majority of the largest oil fields in the UK sector of the [[North Sea]] were found in the waters to the north and east of the Scottish mainland, with the more northerly fields found to the east of the [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] islands.&lt;ref&gt;''School Science from The Energy Institute'' [http://www.schoolscience.co.uk/content/4/chemistry/petroleum/knowl/images/fields.gif Map of North Sea oil fields] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214095311/http://www.schoolscience.co.uk/content/4/chemistry/petroleum/knowl/images/fields.gif |date=2007-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aberdeen]] became the centre of Britain's North Sea oil industry, with many oil terminals such as that of [[Sullom Voe]] on Shetland and [[Flotta]] on Orkney and at [[Cruden Bay]] and [[St Fergus]] on the north east coast of Scotland, being built to support the North Sea oil industry. In the early 1970s, there was a great deal of economic turbulence with the [[1973 oil crisis|1973 oil price shock]] caused by the [[Yom Kippur War]], resulting in rising [[inflation]] coupled with high [[unemployment]], [[recession]] (also known as [[stagflation]]) in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;''Scotland on Sunday'', January 1, 2006 [https://web.archive.org/web/20060228021446/http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/business.cfm?id=392006 How North Sea oil calmed the UK's crisis ridden waters]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the economic argument that formed the basis of the slogan was that while Scotland was part of the United Kingdom, it lacked control over [[royalties]] and revenue from the majority of the oil which lay in the [[Scottish waters|Scottish sector of the North Sea]].

==Reality of the claim==
Given that Scotland is not a [[sovereign state]], it has no effective [[maritime boundary|maritime boundaries]]; and any claims Scotland may assert are subsumed as part of claims made by the United Kingdom. However, due to the existence of two separate legal systems in  [[Great Britain]] &amp;mdash; that of [[Scots law]] pertaining to Scotland and [[English law]] pertaining to [[England and Wales]] &amp;mdash; constitutional law in the United Kingdom has provided for the division of the UK sector of the North Sea into specific Scottish and English components.&lt;ref&gt;''Parliament of the United Kingdom - Standing Committee B, Energy Bill (2004) Lords'' [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmstand/b/st040608/pm/40608s01.htm Hansard discussion on the subject]&lt;/ref&gt; The Continental Shelf Act 1964 and the Continental Shelf (Jurisdiction) Order 1968 defines the UK North Sea maritime area to the north of latitude [[55th parallel north|55 degrees north]] as being under the jurisdiction of [[Scots law]]&lt;ref&gt;''United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea'' [https://www.un.org/Depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/GBR_1968_Order892.pdf UK Legislation - The Continental Shelf (Jurisdiction) Order 1968]&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that 90% of the UK's oil resources were under Scottish jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ben Russell and Paul Kelbie |work=Independent Online edition |date=9  December 2005 |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article331945.ece |title=How black gold was hijacked: North sea oil and the betrayal of Scotland |quote="By the mid 1970s, international convention had already agreed that the North Sea north of the 55th parallel was under Scottish jurisdiction.

Recent evidence by Kemp and Stephen (1999) has tried to estimate hypothetical Scottish shares of North Sea Oil revenue by dividing the UK sector of the North Sea into separate Scottish and English sectors using the international [[equidistance principle|principle of equidistance]] as utilised under the [[UNCLOS|United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS) - such a convention is used in defining the maritime assets of newly formed states and resolving international maritime disputes. The study by Kemp &amp; Stephen showed that hypothesised Scottish shares of North Sea oil revenue over the period 1970 to 1999 varied, dependent upon the price of oil and offset against taxable profits and the costs of exploration and development.&lt;ref&gt;''Murkens, Jones &amp; Keating (2002) p189''&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, a Scottish share of North Sea oil is never formally alluded to as part of Scotland's net fiscal position and is treated by [[HM Treasury]] as ''extra-regio'' resources.&lt;ref&gt;''Government Expenditure and Revenue (Scotland) 2002-03'' [http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2004/12/20411/48778 In the Regional Accounts, the UK Continental Shelf is included in a separate region of the UK (the Extra-regio territory) and is not allocated to specific geographic regions]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BBC]] economist [[Evan Davis (journalist)|Evan Davis]] however reported prior to the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007|2007 Scottish Parliament election]] that the [[Barnett formula]] already allows Scotland to sustain higher levels of [[per capita]] [[Public finance|public spending]] relative to the rest of the UK, which is approximately equivalent to its disproportionately high annual contribution of tax revenues to the central UK Treasury from Oil production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/evandavis/2007/04/the_scottish_gamble_1.html |title= The Scottish gamble |publisher=BBC News|date= 2007-04-30|accessdate=2007-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Scotland's per capita spending growth, relative to the rest of the UK, has in recent years, been nominally reduced by the operation of the Barnett formula, in order to bring public spending levels into line with the UK average, in a phenomenon that had been dubbed the "Barnett Squeeze".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economics.stir.ac.uk/staff/dnfb1/Barnett%20Formula.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Barnett Formula |author=Professor David Bell |publisher=University of Stirling |date=January 2001 |accessdate=2007-12-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070726184528/http://www.economics.stir.ac.uk/staff/dnfb1/Barnett%20Formula.pdf |archivedate=2007-07-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims by Shetland and Orkney==

There have been moves to recast the [[constitutional status of Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles]] partly in order to get a greater share of the oil revenues to these islands, in whose maritime territory it is argued that most of the oil is found.

==Scottish Independence Referendum==
[[Jim Sillars]], former Deputy Leader of the [[Scottish National Party]], said during the 2014 Scottish independence referendum that “[[BP]], in an independent Scotland, will need to learn the meaning of [[nationalisation]], in part or in whole, as it has in other countries who have not been as soft as we have forced to be. We will be the masters of the oil fields, not BP or any other of the majors.”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/day-of-reckoning-post-yes-vote-says-jim-sillars-1-3539754&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/09/12/scottish-independence-jim-sillars-nationalise_n_5810496.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2014/09/12/bp-to-be-nationalised-the-latest-scottish-independence-threat/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3434">'''Joelle Tanguy''' is a French / American diplomat and medical nonprofit executive, currently serving as the Director of [[Foreign policy|External Affairs]] for the [[Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative|Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative. (DNDi).]]

== Background ==
Tanguy received her MBA from a joint program between [[HEC Paris]] and [[Stanford University|Stanford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dndi.org/2018/media-centre/news-views-stories/news/joelletanguy-director-external-relations/|title=Joelle Tanguy appointed Director of External Affairs at DNDi|website=www.dndi.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Tanguy was a dual-degree graduate of business and computer science, working in computer software sales, when she was offered a sabbatical to hike in the Himalayas. According to a [[Stanford Magazine|Stanford magazine]] profile (2000), she applied for a position with [[Médecins Sans Frontières|Medicins Sans Frontieres]] after the [[1988 Armenian earthquake|Armenian earthquake]] of 1988, which later led to coordinating relief missions in Uganda, Somalia, Zaire, Liberia, and the [[Balkans|Balkan peninsula]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://stanfordmag.org/contents/in-a-world-of-hurt|title=In a World of Hurt|last=magazine|first=STANFORD|access-date=2018-11-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tanguy served as the Executive Director for [[Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance|GAVI]], a vaccine alliance, then as Under-Secretary-General for the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|International Red Cross]] and [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Crescent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jcie.org/japan/j/pdf/fgfj/02/kigyou/2010/sympo/panelist_e.pdf|title=JCIE 2010 Panelists|last=|first=|date=2010|work=|access-date=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://humanitarianencyclopedia.org/humanitarian-encyclopedia/governance/advisory-board/tanguy-joelle/|title=Tanguy Joëlle|date=2017-05-24|work=Humanitarian Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-11-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 

In 2018, Tanguy joined the [[Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative|DNDi]] to help advance the cause of drug development against tropical and rare diseases. Motivation for this move may spring from her 2000 quote:&lt;blockquote&gt;"''[Joelle] reserves her harshest words for the pharmaceutical industry, which she believes caters to "wealthy, healthy people" -- not citizens of poor countries who may suffer from different kinds of diseases''"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Volunteer Service ==
In addition to roles with medical and civic organizations, Tanguy serves as an Executive-in-Residence of the [[Geneva Centre for Security Policy]], a [[United Nations]] Director for Women, and a Board member for Human Rights Watch, Global Fund to Fight TB, AIDS, and Malaria, and the Access to Medicine Index Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dndi.org/about-dndi/our-people/leadership/joelle-tanguy/|title=Joelle Tanguy – DNDi|website=www.dndi.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gcsp.ch/News-Knowledge/Experts/Fellows/Tanguy-Ms-Joelle-Tanguy|title=Tanguy - Ms Joëlle Tanguy - GCSP|last=GCSP.CH|website=www.gcsp.ch|language=en|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15839">The '''effect of legalized abortion on crime''' (also the '''Donohue–Levitt hypothesis''') is a hypothesized reduction in [[crime]] in the decades following the legalization of [[abortion]], as a result of fewer children at the highest risk of committing crime being born due to the availability of the procedure. The earliest research suggesting such an effect was a 1966 study in Sweden. In 2001, [[Steven Levitt]] of the University of Chicago and [[John J. Donohue III|John Donohue]] of Yale University argued, citing their research and earlier studies, that children who are unwanted or whose parents cannot support them are likelier to become criminals, and that there is an inverse correlation between the availability of abortion and subsequent crime. This idea was further popularized by its inclusion in the book ''[[Freakonomics]]'', which Levitt co-wrote. 

Critics have argued that Donohue and Levitt's methodologies are flawed and that no statistically significant relationship between abortion and later crime rates can be proven.  Criticisms include the assumption in the Donohue-Levitt study that abortion rates increased substantially since 1973 Supreme Court case ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' eliminated many restrictions in the United States; critics use census data to show that the changes in the overall abortion rate could not account for the decrease in crime claimed by the study's methodology (legal abortions had been permitted under limited circumstances in many states prior). Other critics state that the correlations between births and crime found by Donohue–Levitt do not adequately account for confounding factors such as reduced drug use, changes in demographics and population densities, or other contemporary cultural changes.

==1972 Rockefeller Commission==
{{anchor|1972 Rockefeller Commission on Population and the American Future}}
The 1972 [[John D. Rockefeller III|Rockefeller]] Commission on "Population and the American Future" cites a 1966 study which found that children born to women who had been denied an abortion "turned out to have been registered more often with psychiatric services, engaged in more antisocial and criminal behavior, and have been more dependent on public assistance."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.population-security.org/rockefeller/011_human_reproduction.htm Rockefeller Commission on Population and the American Future]&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the study looked at the children of 188 women who were denied abortions from 1939 to 1941 at the hospital in [[Gothenburg]], Sweden. They compared these unwanted children to another group – the next child born after each of the unwanted children at the hospital. The unwanted children were more likely to grow up in adverse conditions, such as having divorced parents or being raised in foster homes and were more likely to become delinquents and engaged in crime.&lt;ref name="Sweden1966"&gt;Hans Forssman and Inga Thuwe, "One hundred and twenty children born after application for therapeutic abortion refused," [[Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica]], 1966, 71–78, [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0447.1966.tb01915.x&lt;/ref&gt;

==2001 Donohue and Levitt study==
{{anchor|Donohue and Levitt study}}
[[Steven Levitt]] of the [[University of Chicago]] and [[John J. Donohue III|John Donohue]] of [[Yale University]] revived discussion of this claim with their 2001 paper "The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu/levitt/Papers/DonohueLevittTheImpactOfLegalized2001.pdf|title=The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime|website=Price Theory Initiative|publisher=[[Becker Friedman Institute]]|date=May 2001|accessdate=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donohue and Levitt point to the fact that males aged 18 to 24 are most likely to commit crimes. Data indicates that crime in the United States started to decline in 1992. Donohue and Levitt suggest that the absence of unwanted children, following legalization in 1973, led to a reduction in crime 18 years later, starting in 1992 and dropping sharply in 1995. These would have been the peak crime-committing years of the unborn children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Donohue |first1=J. J. |last2=Levitt |first2=S.

According to Donohue and Levitt, [[U.S. state|states]] that had abortion legalized earlier should have the earliest reductions in crime. Donohue and Levitt's study indicates that this indeed has happened: Alaska, California, Hawaii, New York, Oregon and [[Washington (state)|Washington]] experienced steeper drops in crime, and had legalized abortion before ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''. Further, states with a high abortion rate have experienced a greater reduction in crime, when corrected for factors like average income.&lt;ref name="chapter4"&gt;[[Steven D. Levitt|Levitt, Steven D.]], ''[[Freakonomics]]'', [http://freakonomicsbook.com/freakonomics/chapter-excerpts/chapter-4/ Chapter 4 (excerpt)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823142026/http://freakonomicsbook.com/freakonomics/chapter-excerpts/chapter-4/ |date=2010-08-23 }}, ''Where Did All the Criminals Go?''&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, studies in Canada and Australia claim{{Clarify|date=December 2017}} to have established a correlation between legalized abortion and overall crime reduction.&lt;ref name="chapter4" /&gt;

===2001 criticism by Lott and Whitley===
The study was criticized by various authors, including a 2001 article by [[John Lott]] and John Whitley where they argued that Donohue and Levitt assume that states which completely legalized abortion had higher abortion rates than states where abortion was only legal under certain conditions (many states allowed abortion only under certain conditions prior to ''Roe'') and that CDC statistics do not substantiate this claim. In addition, if abortion rates cause crime rates to fall, crime rates should start to fall among the youngest people first and then gradually be seen lowering the crime rate for older and older people. In fact, they argue, the murder rates first start to fall among the oldest criminals and then the next oldest criminals and so on until it last falls among the youngest individuals. Lott and Whitley argue that if Donohue and Levitt are right that 80 percent of the drop in murder rates during the 1990s is due solely to the legalization of abortion, their results should be seen in some graphs without anything being controlled for, and that in fact the opposite is true.  In addition, Lott and Whitley pointed out that using arrest rate data to proxy crime rates is flawed because arrest for murder can take place many months or even years after the crime occurred. Lott and Whitley claim that using the Supplemental Homicide Report, which links murder data for when the crime occurred with later arrest rate data, reverses Donohue and Levitt's regression results.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Lott Jr. and John E. Whitley, "Abortion and Crime: Unwanted Children and Out-of-Wedlock Births", (2001) [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=270126 SSRN Yale Law &amp; Economics Research Paper No. 254] working paper and [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=969508 Economic Inquiry, Vol. 45, No. 2, pp. 304-324, April 2007] published article.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, [[Ted Joyce]] published a study concluding that the negative association between legalized abortion and crime rates reported in Donohue and Levitt's study was actually due to unmeasured period effects from, among other factors, changes in [[crack cocaine]] use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joyce|first1=Ted|title=Did Legalized Abortion Lower Crime?|journal=[[Journal of Human Resources]]|date=2004|volume=XXXIX|issue=1|pages=1–28|doi=10.3368/jhr.XXXIX.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Joyce reported similar, negative results after analyzing age-specific homicide and murder arrest rates in relation to the legalization of abortion across U.S. states and cohorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joyce|first1=Ted|title=A Simple Test of Abortion and Crime|journal=[[Review of Economics and Statistics]]|date=February 2009|volume=91|issue=1|pages=112–123|doi=10.1162/rest.91.1.112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Levitt posted a rebuttal to these criticisms on the ''Freakanomics'' weblog, in which he re-ran his numbers to address the shortcomings and variables missing from the original study. The new results are nearly identical to those of the original study. Levitt posits that any reasonable use of the data available reinforces the results of the original 2001 paper.&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven D. Levitt|Levitt, Steven D.]], "[http://www.freakonomics.com/2005/05/15/abortion-and-crime-who-should-you-believe/ Abortion and crime: who should you believe?]" ''Freakanomics'' Weblog, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005 criticism by Foote and Goetz===
Later in 2005, Christopher Foote and Christopher Goetz claimed that a computer error in Levitt and Donahue's statistical analysis led to an artificially inflated relationship between legalized abortion and crime reduction. Once other crime-associated factors were properly controlled for, they claimed that the effect of abortion on arrests was reduced by about half. Foote and Goetz also criticize Levitt and Donahue's use of arrest totals rather than arrests per capita, which takes population size into account. Using Census Bureau population estimates, Foote and Goetz repeated the analysis using arrest rates in place of simple arrest totals, and found that the effect of abortion disappeared entirely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/5246700?story_id=5246700 Oops-onomics], ''The Economist'', Dec 1st 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Donohue and Levitt subsequently published a response to the Foote and Goetz paper.&lt;ref&gt;Donohue and Levitt, "[http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu/levitt/Papers/ResponseToFooteGoetz2006.pdf Measurement Error, Legalized Abortion, the Decline in Crime: A Response to Foote and Goetz (2005)]", 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The response acknowledged the mistake, but showed that with different methodology, the effect of legalized abortion on crime rates still existed. Foote and Goetz, however, soon produced a rebuttal of their own and showed that even after analyzing the data using the methods that Levitt and Donohue recommend, the data does not show a positive correlation between abortion rates and crime rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Christopher L. Foote &amp; Christopher F. Goetz |publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Boston |date=2008-01-31 |url=http://www.bos.frb.org/economic/wp/wp2005/wp0515.pdf |title=The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime: Comment |format=pdf |work= |accessdate=2008-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are quick to point out that this does not necessarily disprove Levitt's thesis, however, and emphasize that with data this messy and incomplete, it is in all likelihood not even possible to prove or disprove Donohue and Levitt's conclusion.

===2007 Reyes leaded gasoline theory===
{{see also|Lead-crime hypothesis}}
A 2007 study&lt;ref&gt;Reyes, Jessica, [http://www3.amherst.edu/~jwreyes/papers/LeadCrimeBEJEAP.pdf "The Impact of Childhood Lead Exposure on Crime"], ''The B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis &amp; Policy'', Volume 7, Issue 1 2007 Article 51&lt;/ref&gt; by Jessica Reyes at Amherst College stated: "This implies that, between 1992 and 2002, the [[Tetraethyllead#Phaseout and ban|phase-out of lead from gasoline]] was responsible for approximately a 56% decline in violent crime. Sensitivity testing confirms the strength of these results. Results for murder are not robust if New York and the District of Columbia are included, but suggest a substantial elasticity as well. No significant effects are found for property crime. The effect of legalized abortion reported by Donohue and Levitt (2001) is largely unaffected, so that abortion accounts for a 29% decline in violent crime (elasticity 0.23), and similar declines in murder and property crime. Overall, the phase-out of lead and the legalization of abortion appear to have been responsible for significant reductions in violent crime rates."

===2008 study of England and Wales by Leo Kahane===
A 2008 study co-authored by Leo Kahane of [[California State University]] found no evidence that abortion legalization reduced crime in England and Wales. The same study initially replicated Donohue and Levitt's finding of a negative association between abortion and crime rates, but that this association "breaks down under the scrutiny of robustness checks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=KAHANE|first1=LEO H.|last2=PATON|first2=DAVID|last3=SIMMONS|first3=ROB|title=The Abortion-Crime Link: Evidence from England and Wales|journal=Economica|date=19 September 2007|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–21|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0335.2007.00627.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009 review by Shah and Ahman===
A 2009 review by authors from the [[World Health Organization]] concludes that laws against abortion do not reduce the incidence of abortion.&lt;ref&gt;Shah and Ahman, "[http://www.jogc.com/article/S1701-2163(16)34376-6/pdf Unsafe Abortion:Global and Regional Incidence, Trends, Consequences, and Challenges]", Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada, December 2009, pp. 1149-58.&lt;/ref&gt; If this conclusion is correct, it challenges the Donohue–Levitt hypothesis because it suggests that potentially delinquent offspring would still be aborted regardless of legal prohibitions.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Schama, p. 95; Jourdan; and Israel, p. 1106, though Israel uses the translation "project" for "ontwerp"&lt;/ref&gt; of the Dutch-language concept ''Leids Ontwerp'', a draft-manifesto discussed by the [[Holland]] congress of representatives of ''[[exercitiegenootschap]]pen'' (Patriot militias) on 8 October 1785 in [[Leiden]] in the context of the so-called [[Patriottentijd|Patriot revolution]] of 1785 in the [[Dutch Republic]]. This draft resulted in publication of the manifesto entitled ''Ontwerp om de Republiek door eene heilzaame Vereeniging van Belangen van Regent en Burger van Binnen Gelukkig en van Buiten Gedugt te maaken, Leiden, aangenomen bij besluit van de Provinciale Vergadering van de Gewapende Corpsen in Holland, op 4 oktober 1785 te Leiden'' (Design to make the Republic inwardly contented and outwardly feared by a salutary union of interests of [[Regenten|Regent]] and Citizen). It contained an exposition of the Patriot ideology and arrived at the formulation of twenty proposals of political reform in a democratic vein. The ideas were only realized to a large extent under the [[Batavian Republic]], when they inspired the Dutch Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen, but they were earlier also influential in the intellectual history of the [[French Revolution]] thanks to the French translation the journalist [[Antoine Marie Cerisier]], a collaborator of [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Mirabeau]], published in 1788. According to American and British historians [[Jeremy D. Popkin]] and [[Jonathan Israel]] this French translation may have influenced the French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]].

==Background==
The [[American Revolution]] made a deep impression in the Dutch Republic of the 1770s. Intellectuals like [[Joan Derk van der Capellen tot den Pol]] and his friend [[François Adriaan van der Kemp]] disseminated the ideas of [[Thomas Paine]], [[Richard Price]], [[Andrew Fletcher (patriot)|Andrew Fletcher]] and [[Joseph Priestley]], and generally news about the accomplishments of the American revolutionaries. On the one hand this helped convince Dutch public opinion to support the American Revolution, but on the other hand undermined the autocratic government of [[stadtholder]] [[William V, Prince of Orange|William V]] and his [[Orangism (Dutch Republic)|Orangist]] party of ''[[Regenten]]''. The public support of the American revolutionaries helped bring about an armed conflict with Great Britain, the [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]], which was mishandled by the [[stadtholder]] to such an extent that the criticisms of his regime gained wide support under the population. His opponents were found in circles of the old anti-Orangist ("[[Dutch States Party|States party]]") faction among Dutch regents, and among adherents of democratic ideals. These came together as a political movement that called themselves "Patriots". As the stadtholder controlled the armed forces: the [[Dutch States Army]] and the Dutch Navy, the Patriots started to arm themselves by forming citizen militias, known as ''[[exercitiegenootschap]]pen'' (so-called, because they liked to train themselves by the performance of military drills). These were local militias, overlaid by a federal association that bound them together and made them a national force to be reckoned with. The regime saw this as a threat and tried to discourage their operations where possible&lt;ref&gt;israel, pp. 1098-1106&lt;/ref&gt;. On 23 July 1785 (as one example) the city government of [[Leiden]] prohibited the activities of the Leiden  ''exercitiegenootschap'' and fined its drill master. This elicited a reaction by both the local and the provincial militia: they organised a congress of representatives of Holland militias that convened on 8 October 1785 in Leiden in the meeting room of the Society ''Kunst wordt door Arbeid verkregen'' (Art is the result of Labour), one of the Patriot clubs in Leiden&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Postma, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genesis of the manifesto==
At this congress a draft of a manifesto was adopted that became known as the ''Leiden Ontwerp'' (which is often translated into English as "Leiden Draft"&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The Dutch word ''Ontwerp'' may be translated as both "draft" and "design". But in this case ''ontwerp'' may be used in both meanings, because the document was a draft of a political design of a new Dutch constitution.&lt;/ref&gt;). Who exactly wrote this draft is not entirely clear&lt;ref&gt;Cf. S.R.E. Klein and J. Rosendaal, ''Democratie in context. Nieuwe perspectieven op het Leids Ontwerp'' in: De Achttiende Eeuw, vol. 26 (1994), pp. 71-100&lt;/ref&gt;. However it is likely that the members of the commission that was charged by the congress with the writing of a final document, also had had a hand in the original draft. These were the journalist [[Wybo Fijnje]] (brother-in-law of the Leiden publisher of the French-language Dutch newspaper [[Nouvelles Extraordinaires de Divers Endroits|''Gazette de Leyde'']], [[Jean Luzac]], a friend of American ambassador [[John Adams]]), the Leiden textile manufacturer [[Pieter Vreede]], and the Overijssel aristocrat [[Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck]]. They edited the final draft that was published as 
''Ontwerp om de Republiek door eene heilzaame Vereeniging van Belangen van Regent en Burger van Binnen Gelukkig en van Buiten Gedugt te maaken'' (Design to make the Republic inwardly contented and outwardly feared by a salutary union of interests of [[Regenten|Regent]] and Citizen) by the Leiden publisher Leendert Herdingh. It was so popular that in May 1786 a third edition was already necessary. The journalist [[Gerrit Paape]] later wrote that a copy of the manifesto was in almost everybody's hand.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Postma, op. cit.; Schama, pp. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main points==
In the 68 pages of the document first an exposition was given of the main ideas behind the "design" into which the argument issued. That argument may be summarized by giving the headings of the sections of the paper (in translation):
 1. Necessity of the preservation of the originally good Constitution, by correction of the abuses that have slipped in
 2. The stadtholderate not a sufficient means for the repair of the original Constitution
 3. The detrimental and offensive fact of the independence of the Regents from the people, whose representatives they are
 4. What has much contributed in later times to enlarge the detrimental effects of the independence of the Regents
 5. Dangers to which the Regents are subject in case they don't want to enter into the project of reform
 6. Dangers to which the independence of the Regents subjects the liberty of the Citizen
 7. Advantages of this Reform for the Regents
 8. Rights of the People in relation to Petitions
 9. Necessity of the Constitutional Reform in relation to National Defense
 10. Necessity of a Constitutional Reform for improvement of public morals and for economic growth
 11. Conclusions from the above arguments as foundations of the Reform, and correct stipulation of everybody's rights

The argument resulted in an enumeration of twenty numbered articles:
 I. Freedom is an inalienable right of all Dutch citizens. No power on Earth can impede them to make use of that Freedom
 II. This Freedom would be illusory if it would not be founded on the right to be governed under laws to which the citizens have consented, either in person, or by their representatives
 III. These representatives must not be independent of those they represent, and their appointment by the People according to a constant and regulated system is an appropriate means to prevent such independence
 IV. The return of this right of appointment to the People must consist of either annual election by the People of municipal magistrates, or at least the nomination of the candidates from which the magistrates [[Co-option|co-opt]] new members of the magistracy
 V. Though sovereignty ultimately belongs to the People, for practical reasons government must be left to state colleges and departments. The People retain the right to influence government by petitions and addresses. To enable the People to do this in a reasoned form they have to be informed by a Free Press and have to enjoy Freedom of Expression  that may not be subject to prior restraint, though it may subject to judicial sanction after the fact
 VI. Everywhere the Regents promote this Constitutional Reform they may not be deprived arbitrarily of their existing offices, unless those offices contravene this new Constitution, or one person holds two incompatible offices
 VII. The People will have to leave the officers they have elected to do their job during their time in office and to give them their trust
 VIII. The officers of the Municipal Militias will be elected by their members and in case the regulations declare government and military offices incompatible, those regulations will be scrupulously observed
 IX. Nobody will be eligible for government office who has not served in a militia
 X. Citizen-commissioners will be appointed to audit the public accounts and to guarantee the exercise of rights
 XI. There will be regular accounts of the Public Finances on all government levels
 XII. Citizen-commissioners will have the right and duty to investigate matters concerning industry and trade and to recommend policies pertaining to those matters to the government
 XIII. Citizen-commissioners will not step down from their posts all at once, but only a part of the membership will be renewed periodically
 XIV. Though the state has to make expenditures for the maintenance of infrastructure and those expenditures must therefore not suffer undue austerity, the People have the right to demand the abolition of useless and costly institutions and practices, with just compensation for the holders of the abolished rights and offices
 XV. The electors of Magistrates must be the members of the militias, unless this right of election belonged to the [[Guild]]s
 XVI. To avoid the problem of electors selling their vote, the right of election will be reserved to people with a certain position of wealth, depending on local circumstances
 XVII. Regulations may be made as to the qualifications of both electors and their representatives
 XVIII. Petty offices should preferentially be given to people of exemplary behavior, military veterans, and people originating locally (instead of people from abroad)
 XIX. Civic militias should be promoted so as to support the Army against foreign enemies and to oppose that Army in case it becomes the instrument of domestic tyranny
 XX. To serve those two purposes the citizens should be divided in three classes, whose members, selected by drawing lots, will have to serve in the militia in rotation

==Influence==
A close reading of the ''Design'' will teach that the editors of the document revered the existing "constitution" of the Dutch Republic (in the sense of a body of foundational [[charter]]s and treaties, like the [[Great Privilege]], the [[Pacification of Ghent]], the [[Union of Utrecht]], the [[Twelve Years' Truce]], and the [[Peace of Münster]]), but rejected a number of "abuses" that had recently "slipped in" like the so-called ''Regeringsreglementen'' (Government Regulations) that had been adopted in the course of the [[Second_Stadtholderless_Period#Crisis_and_the_Orangist_revolution_of_1747|Orangist Revolution of 1747]] to give the stadtholder a right of appointment, or at least approval, of city magistrates. The Patriots wanted to roll back these recent reforms and replace them with the right of the citizenry, just below the caste of ''Regenten'', but above the "lower classes," to elect those magistrates, or at least nominate candidates for co-option by the ''[[vroedschap]]pen'' that traditionally had the right to elect them. In other words, they implicitly accepted the existing "constitution", with its special political rights for the ''Regenten'', but put a new ''reading'' on it, "clawing back" so to speak the "ancient" rights of the [[guild]]s and ''[[schutterij]]en'' to influence local government, and through its intermediary, regional and national government. To justify this they proclaimed a popular sovereignty that was to replace the sovereignty claimed by the provincial States and the States-General (another of those "abuses", as the sovereignty of the States was always supposed to be derived from "the People").

The Leiden Draft therefore was not only a declaration of principles, but also a political program of overturning, not the political structure of the Republic, but the composition of the ''personnel'' occupying the magistracy with the use of more or less "democratic" elections. The Patriots soon started to put this program in execution, beginning in the city of [[Utrecht]] where the old government was replaced with a democratically elected one. Soon other city governments in especially Holland, Utrecht province, Overijssel and Friesland went over to the Patriot side, usually, however, by having Orangist regents replaced by adherents of the old States party, whose families had been driven out in 1747, but had taken up the explicit invitation in the Leiden Draft to cast their lot with the democrats. Sometimes, however, even those old-style regents were replaced by representatives of the middle-class citizenry (like in Utrecht, Leiden, Delft and Rotterdam), breaching the traditional monopoly  of political office of the Regent class. This "attack" on their position started to disturb the Patriot regents, who gradually started to drift away from their more radically "democratic" brethren in the Patriot movement. But the wave of democratic reform seemed unstoppable when in the Summer of 1787 the Amsterdam ''vroedschap'' was overturned after large street demonstrations of the local Patriot clubs and the Patriot ''exercitiegenootschap''. This went too far for the old-style regents, a number of whom started to move over to the camp of the stadtholder. However, it took military intervention by the king of Prussia, brother of the [[Wilhelmina of Prussia, Princess of Orange|wife]] of the stadtholder and hence his brother-in-law, to suppress what had become the Patriot Revolution in the Fall of 1787. After this the personnel changes in the city governments and the States were reversed and the post-1747 system restored, in a more severe form, under the 1788 [[Act of Guarantee]] that seemed to cast the stadtholderate in stone&lt;ref&gt;Schama, pp. 95-135&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Patriot Revolution therefore seemed to be stopped in its tracks, and rolled back, but that did not imply that the influence of the Leiden Draft also had forever dissipated. The 1770s and 1780s were a time of intensive contact and exchange of ideas across European frontiers by like-minded intellectuals. Among those involved were the French journalist Antoine-Marie Cerisier, who had been in the center of the Patriot Revolution, and therefore, like many other leading Patriots had to go into exile in France. There he became a close collaborator of [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Mirabeau]], the trailblazer of the [[French Revolution]], who took a keen interest in political developments in the Dutch Republic&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Mirabeau wrote a pamphlet, entitled ''Aux Bataves sur le stadhouderat'' in 1788, in which he 
 articulated part of a delcaration of rights and commented on the suppression of the Patriot Revolution and advised the ''bataves'' to try again soon; Cf. Jourdan&lt;/ref&gt;. Cerisier did not write the Leiden Draft himself as Popkin has it &lt;ref group=Note&gt;Jeremy Popkin, ''Dutch Patriots, French Journalists and Declaration of Rights: the leidse ontwerp of 1785 and its Diffusion in France,'' The Historical Journal, vol. 38 (1995): pp. 553-65; but Popkin later acknowledged that Cerisiers role was less important in the writing of the Leiden Draft; Cf. Jeremy D. Popkin, ''Antoine-Marie Cerisier; le Leidse Ontwerp et le Grondwettige Herstelling un debat encore ouvert'' in: De Achttiende Eeuw, vol. 29, no. 1 (1997), pp.
 17-34&lt;/ref&gt;, but excerpted it in French in an article&lt;ref&gt;A.-M. Cerisier, ''Extrait du plan général de réforme concerté par les patriotes hollandois'', in Analyse des papiers anglais no. 75 (15–18 Aug. 1788)&lt;/ref&gt; in ''Analyse des Papiers Anglais'' in 1788&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Jourdan, notes 19 and 21&lt;/ref&gt;. According to Popkin, who conducted extensive archival research into the matter, this excerpt eventually influenced the formulation of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen|''Déclaration des droits de l'homme et du citoyen'']] of 1789, one of the foundational documents of the French Revolution. In a 2007 oration&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Israel, ''In strijd met Spinoza'' (Vierde KB-lezing; Amsterdam 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;, Jonathan Israel supported this thesis&lt;ref&gt;Postma, pp. 39-40&lt;/ref&gt;.

And so the "path of influence" of the Leiden Draft eventually doubled back to the Netherlands, because the exiled Patriots returned with the triumphant armies of the Revolutionary French Republic in 1795 and this time definitively overturned the old Dutch Republic and its institutions. Again, the political method of the Leiden Draft program was used by working ostensibly "within" the old constitution, by taking over the personnel of the old institutions like the [[States of Holland and West Friesland|States of Holland]] that was in a "constitutional" way replaced by the [[Provisional Representatives of the People of Holland]], and the States-General that for a while became the [[States General of the Batavian Republic]], before it legislated itself out of existence at the end of 1795 to be replaced by the [[National Assembly of the Batavian Republic]]. One of the first official acts of the Provisional Representatives was the promulgation of the Dutch Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen, that was drawn up by a commission, chaired by [[Pieter Paulus]], which certainly took the Leiden Draft into account as one of its inspirations&lt;ref&gt;Schama, pp. 95, 211-214&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{Politics of Gibraltar}}
The '''Liberal Party of Gibraltar''' ('''Libs''') is a [[Liberalism|liberal]]&lt;ref name="Nordsieck"/&gt; [[list of political parties in Gibraltar|political party]] in [[Gibraltar]]. It was founded in 1991&lt;ref name="newnew"&gt;{{cite book | title=A New New English: language, politics, and identity in Gibraltar | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fEiX-YLT3j8C&amp;lpg=PR7&amp;dq=Gibraltar%20Liberal%20Party%20site%3Abooks.google.com&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q=GLP&amp;f=false | first=Anja | last=Kellermann | page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the '''Gibraltar National Party'''&lt;ref name="newnew" /&gt; and is led by Dr. [[Joseph Garcia (Gibraltarian politician)|Joseph Garcia]].

==Policy==
In line with most [[liberalism|liberal]] parties, the party describe their political philosophy as being based on notions of people deciding their own future, and are committed to [[Gibraltarian people|Gibraltarian]] [[self-determination]] regarding [[Gibraltar Constitution Order 2006|constitutional]] arrangements.&lt;ref name="liberal.gi"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.liberal.gi/aims.php| title = Liberal Party of Gibraltar - Our Liberal Values| accessdate = 11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party believes in "freedom, responsibility, tolerance, social justice and equality of opportunity: these are the central values of liberalism, and they remain the principles on which an open society must be built. These principles require a careful balance of strong civil societies, democratic government, free markets, and international cooperation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://liberal.gi/aims.php#values |title=Liberal Party of Gibraltar: Aims and Objectives of the Liberal Party |publisher=Liberal.gi |date= |accessdate=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party makes its stance on economic policy very clear, stating that "open societies need open markets. A liberal, open and tolerant society requires a market economy. Political freedom and [[economic freedom]] belong together".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://liberal.gi/aims.php#challenge |title=Liberal Party of Gibraltar: Aims and Objectives of the Liberal Party |publisher=Liberal.gi |date= |accessdate=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Communism sidebar}}
There are a number of communist parties active in various countries across the world, and a number that used to be active. They differ not only in method, but also in strict ideology and interpretation. The formation of [[Communist party|communist parties]] in various countries was first initiated by the formation of the [[Communism|communist]] [[Comintern|Third International]] by the Russian [[Bolsheviks]]. Undoubtedly the most important of these parties were those of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[People's Republic of China]]: the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and the [[Communist Party of China]], respectively.

Some communist parties have names such as Workers' Party, Socialist Party, Progressive Party, etc. Most, but not all, of the parties on this list are those that were aligned with either [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Moscow]], [[Communist Party of China|Beijing]] or [[Party of Labour of Albania|Tirana]] during the [[Cold War]] and their offshoots. Groups currently and exclusively participating in the [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] or the [[Left communism|Left communist]] tradition are not included in the listing, see [[List of Trotskyist organizations by country|List of Trotskyist organisations by country]] and [[List of Left communist organizations by country|List of Left communist organisations by country]].

Groups currently participating in non-[[Marxism|Marxist]] movements related to communism, such as [[Anarcho-communism]] and [[Juche]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Workers' Party of Korea]] leads the [[Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland]] and is by some scholars and leftists not considered as communist party (like: {{Cite book|title= Ethnic Nationalism in Korea: Genealogy, Politics, and Legacy |last=Shin |first=Gi-wook |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |year=2006 |isbn= 9780804754088 |ref=harv}}). Even if it is not a common point view WPK and North Korea started recently to consider themselves as jucheist exclusively. The party participates in the [[International Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties]] though. (source:  [http://www.solidnet.org/15-imcwp/15-imcwp-list-of-participants List of participants of 15th International Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties 2013]); for more details see [[Juche]].&lt;/ref&gt; are included in the listing as a variant of communism as they are communist in origin and participate in world communist conventions. All consider themselves to be the vanguard governing party of their respective land.

==Officially ruling parties in communist/communist originated countries==
In the following countries, the following communist/variant juche parties either lead the ruling coalition or hold monopoly on state power, as defined by their respective country's constitutions. They are all of differing communist ideology and founding.

The '''May Day riots of 1919''' were a series of violent demonstrations that occurred throughout [[Cleveland, Ohio]] on May 1 ([[May Day]]), 1919.  The riots occurred during the May Day parade organised by Socialist leader [[Charles Ruthenberg]], of local trade [[Trades union|unionists]], [[socialism|socialists]], [[communism|communists]], and [[anarchism|anarchists]] to protest the jailing of [[Eugene V. Debs]].  The previous year, Debs's Federal Court trial was held in Cleveland.  The event was also aimed at helping promote Ruthenberg's own candidacy for mayor of Cleveland.  The 32 groups were divided into four units, each holding a [[Socialist]] flag and an [[United States|American]] flag at its head. The cause of the riots is disputed. 

According to the Cleveland Bicentennial Commisssion,  as they marched to Cleveland's [[Public Square, Cleveland|Public Square]], one of the units was stopped on Superior Avenue by a group of [[Liberty bond|Victory Liberty Loan]] workers, who demanded that they lower their flags.  The marchers refused to do so and mass fighting broke out immediately; chaos quickly spreading throughout the downtown area.  Ruthenberg's party headquarters on Prospect Avenue was ransacked by a mob.

Law was finally restored by mounted police, army trucks, and tanks.  Casualties amounted to two people killed, forty injured, and 116 arrested, including Ruthenberg himself on a charge of "assault with intent to kill".  Local newspapers quickly pointed out that only eight of those arrested were born in the [[United States]].  In response to the riots, the city government immediately passed laws to restrict parades and the display of [[Red flag (politics)|red flag]]s.  Overall, the occurrence is seen as the most violent of a series of similar disorders that took place throughout the U.S. as a result of the [[First Red Scare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=John J. Grabowski|editor2=David D. VanTassel|title=The encyclopedia of Cleveland history|date=1996|publisher=Indiana Univ. Press|location=Bloomington [u.a.]|isbn=978-0253330567|pages=1165|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This account is disputed by the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] in the newspaper "The New Solidarity", in which they outline that those there, celebrating May Day had not violated any city ordinance to incite rioting, and that the then Republican mayor of Cleveland, [[Harry L. Davis]], had issued an order to the police to suppress any violations of law with "promptness and firmness" setting the tone of how police should respond to the event. &lt;ref name="new_solidarity"&gt;{{cite news|title=May Day celebration crushed by tanks from Germany|url=https://libcom.org/library/new-solidarity-may-10-1919|accessdate=1 May 2018|work=The New Solidarity (May 10, 1919)|publisher=Industrial Workers of the World|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They detail that as those at the event were incited by police and self-described "patriots", causing a disturbance, but not a riot; this then was detailed as the pretence for the police to move in to suppress the perceived riot in order to "suppress lawlessness" by using mounted police and {{ref label|NewSol1|a}} German tanks, taken from Germany after World War I, were used indiscriminately by the police and army despite the fact there were women and children in attendance. {{ref label|NewSol2|b}} The article suggested that the deaths and injuries were the result of police acting to break up the celebration, and that overall, there were 130 sentenced and/or fined.&lt;ref name="new_solidarity" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3110">In Canada's parliamentary system of [[responsible government]], [[minority governments]] occur when no party has a majority of seats in the legislature. Typically, but not necessarily, the party with a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of seats forms the government. In a minority situation, governments must rely on the support of other parties to stay in power, providing less stability than a [[majority government]]. In Canada, political parties rarely form official [[coalition governments]] to form a majority.

Canada's [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] voting system means that minority governments are relatively rare in comparison with countries that have a [[proportional representation]] voting system. There have, however, been several [[Federal minority governments in Canada|minority governments at the federal level]] and in nine of Canada's 10 provinces at various times.

==Federal level==
{{Main|Federal minority governments in Canada}}
Canada has had 13 minority governments, most recently experiencing its longest period of minority government with three successive minority governments between 2004 and 2011.

* [[Alexander Mackenzie (politician)|Alexander Mackenzie]] (1873–1874, Liberal)	
* [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] (1921–25, 1925–26, Liberal)
* [[Arthur Meighen]] (1926, Conservative)
* [[John Diefenbaker]] (1957–58, 1962–63, Progressive Conservative)
* [[Lester Pearson]] (1963–65, 1965–68, Liberal)
* [[Pierre Trudeau]] (1972–74, Liberal)
* [[Joe Clark]] (1979–80, Progressive Conservative)
* [[Paul Martin]] (2004–06, Liberal)
* [[Stephen Harper]] (2006–08, 2008–11, Conservative)

==Provincial and territorial level==
Of Canada's 10 provinces, only [[Alberta]] has never had a minority government. The territories of [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]] do not have political parties and are instead governed under the [[Consensus government in Canada|consensus government]] system.

The '''New Saxon Spelling''' ([[Low German|Low German/Low Saxon]]: ''Nysassiske Skryvwyse'', '''''NSS''''', "New Saxon Writing Method") is a Low German/Low Saxon spelling guideline for the entire Low German language area, on both sides of the Dutch–German border. While many other Low German spelling systems are based on local, dialectal pronunciations of Low German, the NSS aims for maximum readability and clarity across the entire Low German–speaking region, regardless of local pronunciation.

Benefits of the New Saxon Spelling include:

* unambiguous spellings of Low German words
* readability across the entire Low German–speaking area
* equality for all Low German dialects, on both sides of the border

The NSS can be seen as an extended version of the {{ill|Algemeyne Schryvwys'|nds-nl}} ("General/Universal Writing Method"), which is suited mainly for only [[Northern Low Saxon|Northern Low German/Northern Low Saxon]]. The NSS also borrows from other, pronunciation-based spelling systems, and from the [[Middle Low German|Middle Low German/Middle Saxon]] spelling conventions of the [[Hanseatic period]].

The NSS was completed in 2018 by the Warkgruppe AS 2.0 ("Working Group AS 2.0"), a group of language enthusiasts from the [[Veluwe]] and [[Twente]] regions of the Netherlands, and [[East Westphalia]] and [[Schleswig-Holstein]] in Germany.

== Background and aims ==

Current Low German spelling methods usually follow either [[Standard German]] or [[Standard Dutch]] spelling rules, with minor adjustments to accommodate Low German pronunciation. However, few speakers of Low German adhere strictly to these formal spelling rules, or know that formal spelling rules for Low German exist at all.

Low German speakers in Germany usually use spellings based on Standard German, while speakers in the Netherlands usually use spellings based on Standard Dutch. This impedes cross-border reading comprehension. Additionally, since neither spelling system is designed for Low German, each writer must decide how to adapt Standard German or Standard Dutch spelling to Low German—such as with diacritics or double- or triple-vowels—which creates a lack of uniformity in spelling.

The aim of the NSS is to simplify and encourage communication across the Dutch–German border. This is achieved by looking for neutral ways of communicating, and by separating words from their local pronunciations. The NSS aims to write Low German so that it is intelligible to Low German speakers in the Netherlands who are not familiar with German spelling rules, and vice versa. Readers may then apply their own dialectal pronunciations to written words.

== Current use ==

In February 2018, one of the creators of the NSS presented the spelling system at a regional symposium in [[Beckum, Overijssel|Beckum]], the Netherlands. It received positive votes from several representatives from the {{ill|IJsselacademie|nl}}.&lt;ref name="Tubantia article"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lage Venterink |first1=Gerard |title=Ik wul at myne ölders my öäre språke leard hadden |url=http://www.twentsetaalbank.nl/docs/2018-03-02-Tub-TerDenge.pdf |accessdate=11 November 2018 |work=De Twentsche Courant Tubantia |date=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NSS is used on Wearldspråke ("World Talk"), a Low German news website.&lt;ref name="Tubantia article" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wearldspråke |url=https://wearldsproake.nl |accessdate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 2018, the NSS is one of the orthographies used on the Dutch Low Saxon Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nds-nl.wikipedia.org |title=Dutch Low Saxon Wikipedia |accessdate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Secondary source needed|date=November 2018}}

The creators of the NSS plan on making a Low German dictionary.&lt;ref name="Tubantia article" /&gt;

== Example ==

The following example from the [[Tweants dialect]] of Low German (spoken in the [[Twente]] region of the Netherlands) shows the difference between the NSS and other, generally accepted, writing systems: the '''{{ill|Sass'sche Schrievwies|nds}}''' ("Sassian Writing Method", created by German linguist [[Johannes Sass]] and intended for [[Northern Low Saxon|Northern Low German/Northern Low Saxon]] dialects in Germany), and the '''{{ill|Standaard Skriefwieze|nds-nl}}''' ("Standard Writing Method", intended for the Tweants dialect in the Netherlands).

{| class="wikitable"

| English: || "The soldier wrote to his mother that he would soon be home."

|-
| Tweants, '''NSS''': || ''"Den soldåt skreev an syn moder dat hee gauw wyr te huus köm."''
|}

== Principles and properties ==

The NSS can be applied both broadly, to the entire Low German language, or specifically, to a particular dialect. There is the '''general NSS''' (''öäverregionale maksimaalversioon'', "superregional maximal version"), which covers all the spoken differences of all dialects. And there is a series of '''dialectal NSS''' versions (''regionale minimaalversionen'', "regional minimal versions"), in which certain graphemes can be merged, when a [[phonemic merger]] has occurred in a particular dialect.

The main principles of the NSS are as follows:

* Etymology
* Uniformity
* Open and closed syllables

Below are a number of additional properties.

=== Principle 1: Etymology ===

In the '''general NSS''', the spelling of words is determined by their etymology. In the regional '''dialectal NSS''' versions, a writer may deviate somwhat from the etymological spelling, if desired. A dialect may have merged phonemes that used to be separate in Old Saxon, such as ''ey'' and ''ee''. In the Twents regional variants, these may both be written as ''ee''.

==== E-apocope ====

The final ''e'', which is absent in the northern dialects and in the dialects around the [[IJsselmeer]] because of e-[[apocope]] (the loss of a sound from the end of a word), is still written in the NSS, whether or not a particular dialect pronounces it. This reduces the visual differences between the northern and southern dialects. Moreover, this offers a simple and systematic solution for the reproduction of [[final-obstruent devoicing]] of vowels in the northern dialects: ''wyse'' = [vi::z], ''breyve'' = [brɛ:ɪ̯v].

=== Principle 2: Uniformity ===

The principle of uniformity means that word stems are written the same way whenever possible, even if suffixes change the pronunciation of the word stem.

==== Final-obstruent devoicing ====

At the end of a syllable, obstruents regularly become voiceless. In the NSS, this is not reflected in writing. One thus writes ''ty'''d''' ''- ''ty'''d'''en'' (and not ''Tie'''t''' ''- ''Tie'''d'''en'', as in the Sass'sche Schrievwies), and ''skry'''v'''en'' - ''skri'''v'''t'' (and not as in Dutch ''schrij'''v'''en'' - ''schrij'''f'''t'').

==== Assimilation ====

Regular [[assimilation (phonology)|assimilations]] are not displayed in writing. One thus writes: ''bild'' - ''bilder'' (instead of ''biller''), ''hand'' - ''handen''/''hände'', ''ölven'', ''seggen'', etc.

==== Exceptions ====

Word stems ending in ''s'', ''sj'', or any other sibilant do not follow this rule. Here, the ''s'' from the ''-st'' suffix is dropped: ''nervöös'' → ''up't nervööst'', ''duusjen'' → ''du duusjt''.

=== Principle 3: Open and closed syllables ===

==== Vowel length ====

A long vowel is written with a single letter in an [[syllable#Open and closed|open syllable]], and with a double letter in a [[syllable#Open and closed|closed syllable]]. One thus writes: ''maken'' - ''maakt'', ''gode'' - ''good''.

===== Exceptions =====

The letters ''e'', ''y'', and ''å'' are exceptions to this:

* A long ''e'' can also be doubled in a stressed open syllable. This applies especially to words with one syllable. For example, as an alternative to the northern ''sey'' (German ''See'', Dutch ''zee''), one can write ''see'' in the southern dialects.
* ''y'' always stands for a long vowel, which makes doubling in closed syllables unnecessary. One thus writes: ''hyr'' and ''myn'', not ''hyyr'' or ''myyn''.
* ''å'' always stands for a long vowel, and here again doubling in closed syllables is unnecessary. One thus writes: ''stån'' and ''gån'', not ''ståån'' or ''gåån''.

==== Consonants at the end of a word ====

In the NSS, there is no consonant-doubling at the ends of words, as there is in Standard German. One thus writes ''kan'', ''nat'', and ''wil'', and not ''kann'', ''natt'', or ''will'', as with the Sass'sche Schrievwies.

=== Further properties ===

==== Adaptations for loan words and foreign words ====

Loan words that are no longer recognized as foreign, are written phonetically. In the case of these foreign words, the spelling remains close to the word's spelling in the original language. These words are represented as follows:

* The principle of [[syllable#Open and closed|open and closed syllables]]: long vowels in closed syllables are written with two letters in foreign words, as they are in Low German words (''kanaal'', ''systeem'', ''kultuur'').
* ''c'' becomes ''k'' if the letter is pronounced /k/ (''konferens'', ''kakao''), and remains ''c'' if the letter is pronounced /ts~s/ (''citrone'', ''centrum'').
* ''cc'' becomes ''ks'' if pronounced /ks/ (''aksent'', ''aksepteren''), and becomes ''kk'' if pronounced /k/ (''akkumuleren'', ''akkoord'').
* ''qu'' becomes ''kw'' if pronounced /kv/ (''kwaliteyt'', ''frekwens'').
* ''qu'' generally becomes ''k'' if pronounced /k/ (''karantene''), but for names and locations, the spelling ''qu'' can be maintained (''Quebec'').
* ''th'' and ''ph'' become ''t'' and ''f'', respectively (''teory'', ''tema'', ''telefoon'', ''foto'').
* ''x'' becomes ''ks'' (''eksempel'', ''kontekst'').

==== Capitalization of nouns ====

Only the beginnings of sentences, names of people and countries are written with a capital letter. Other nouns and adjectives are not capitalized, even if they are derived from the names of countries.

==== Punctuation ====

* A comma is placed between clauses of a sentence, e.g. [main clause, main clause] or [main clause, subordinate clause]. For short subordinate clauses (around two words), the comma can be omitted. Exception: no comma is placed before ''un''/''en'' ("and"), or ''or''/''oder''/''of'' ("or"). 
* Quotation marks placed before and after a word or phrase are placed at the top. Possible quotation marks are "...", “...”, and ”...”.

== Graphemes ==

Consonants are pronounced largely the same across all dialects of Low German. Here, the '''general NSS''' can be used with no major problems, regardless of dialect.

Vowels, however, are pronounced differently in different dialects, and some small variations in spelling are required for certain dialects or dialect groups.

The tables below show each grapheme used in the NSS, and show each grapheme's etymological origins in [[Old Saxon]] and [[Proto-Germanic]]. The tables also show examples of each grapheme's use in the NSS (with dialectal variations, where necessary); and compare the same example words in the '''NSS'''; the '''{{ill|Sass'sche Schrievwies|nds}}'''; the '''[[Gronings dialect]]'''; the '''{{ill|Münsterland dialect|de|Münsterländer Platt}}''' spoken in the [[Münster (region)|Münster]] region; and the '''{{ill|Standaard Skriefwieze|nds-nl}}'''. Cognates in Standard Dutch and Standard German are also included for comparison.

{{Politics of Pakistan}}
The '''Pakistan Muslim League''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|پاکستان مسلم لیگ}}}}; known as '''PML'''), is the name of several [[Politics of Pakistan|Pakistani political parties]] that have dominated the [[Conservatism in Pakistan|Right-wing platform]] since the 1960s. The first Pakistan Muslim League was founded by [[Ayub Khan (general)|President Ayub Khan]] in 1962 as a successor to the [[Muslim League (Pakistan)|original Muslim League]]. Just a short period after its foundation, the party broke into two factions: [[Convention Muslim League]] that supported the President and the new [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1962|Constitution]], and the [[Council Muslim League]], that opposed the new [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1962|Constitution]], denouncing it as undemocratic that made the [[President of Pakistan|Presidency]] an autocratic position. Following President Ayub's resignation, [[Nurul Amin]], a [[Right-wing]] political veteran, attempted to reunite the factions of Pakistan Muslim League. His efforts were supported by some, while opposed by others. Before the [[Pakistani general election, 1970|1970 Elections]], a senior leader of [[Council Muslim League]], [[Abdul Qayyum Khan]] formed [[Muslim League (Qayyum)|his own variant of the Muslim League]] that opposed cooperation with a party that once supported a [[Dictator]]. In 1973, Amin's efforts succeeded and the [[Pakistan Muslim League (F)|Functional Muslim League]] was founded.

Both, [[Pakistan Muslim League (F)|FML]] and [[Muslim League (Qayyum)|Qayyum-led faction]] declined under the [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto|Bhutto]] administration, and many of its members joined the [[Leftism|Leftist]] [[Pakistan People's Party|People's Party]].

The Pakistan Muslim League formally dissolved alongside other parties following the [[Operation Fairplay|1977 Martial Law]], though it supported it. However, it was restored in 1985, when [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|General Zia]] organised his supporters into a formal party under the leadership of [[Muhammad Khan Junejo]]. In 1988, Zia dismissed Junejo and the party split between [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)]] and [[Pakistan Muslim League (J)]]. In 1988, [[Death of Zia-ul-Haq|after Zia's death]], Pakistan Muslim League came under the leadership of [[Nawaz Sharif]] and joined the [[Islami Jamhoori Ittehad|Islamic Democratic Alliance]]. In 1993, after the Alliance has been dissolved. After the [[1999 Pakistani coup d'etat|1999 Coup]], PML-N went into a temporary decline and three new factions of Pakistan Muslim League were founded: Anti-[[Pervez Musharaf|Musharaf]] [[Pakistan Muslim League (Z)|PML (Zia)]], Pro-Musharaf conservative [[Awami Muslim League (Pakistan)|Awami Muslim League]] and Pro-Musharaf liberal [[Pakistan Muslim League (Q)|PML-Q]]

In 2004, the [[Pakistan Muslim League (Q)]] and the [[Pakistan Muslim League (F)]] reunited as Pakistan Muslim League. However, the reunion was unsuccessful and within few days, both the parties went off in separate directions once again.

==The Original Party==
{{main_article|Muslim League (Pakistan)}}

At the time of Pakistani independence in 1947 the [[Muslim League (Pakistan)|Muslim League]] was the only major party in Pakistan and claimed the allegiance of almost every [[Muslim]] in the country. However, [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah]] had other plans after his appointment as the first [[Governor-General]] of the new state. His maiden speech to the [[Constituent assembly]] on 11 August 1947 spelled out, as Magna Carta of the future agenda, each and every important feature of Pakistan’s polity that was based on equality of all citizens, federal parliamentary democracy and rule of law to name a few of them. He also had his own perceptions about the party he was heading. He thought that the All-India Muslim League must have a constitutional and legal successor as an organisation that was to rule the new born country. To achieve the target, he convened in November 1947 a session of the AIML Council and it was held in Karachi on 14 and 15 December upon invitation sent by the party’s convener [[Liaquat Ali Khan]], who had taken over as the first prime minister. The council decided to establish two organisations of the AIML. Its nomenclature in [[India]] was to remain the same while it was Muslim League for the new state. [[Hussein Shaheed Suhrawardy]], who had been the AIML-nominated prime minister of [[Bengal]] in 1937 and held the same office after 1946 elections, did not agree to 'Muslim League' as the name of AIML in Pakistan. He pleaded the word "Muslim" had lost its efficacy after [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] and the organisation might be named as Pakistan League. Moreover, he claimed that Muslim League's objective of Muslim Nationalism was unrealistic and instead [[Pakistani Nationalism]] should be focused on. Suhrawardy's suggestion was not accepted, thus, he parted ways with the party to found the [[Bangladesh Awami League|Awami League]] in 1949. This was to serve the first shock to the country’s political structure. The first party convention of Muslim League held in [[Karachi]] in February 1948, elected [[Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman]] as the chief organiser and elected a new PML Council. Khaliquzzaman appointed provincial organising committees. The first meeting of the new party council, held in Karachi in April 1949, elected Khaleequz Zaman as the party president and also incorporated a new clause in the constitution according to which no party office-bearer could become a minister or accept any office of benefit But events that followed in the wake of differences in Muslim League ministries in Sindh and Punjab, led to the exit of Sindh chief minister Khuhro and the elevation of Pir Ealhi Bukhsh as the new chief minister. In Punjab, Sikandar Hayat allied with Mumtaz Daultana to controvert chief Minister Nawab Zulfiqar Khan Mamdot. These skirmishes weakened the ruling party. It was in this background that [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan]], who already had a meeting with the Quaid-i-Azam in Peshawar on May 18
1948, announced the formation of a [[Marxism|Marxist]] party with the objective of serving as opposition to the Capitalist regime.

Ghaffar Khan was the new [[Khudai Khidmatgar|party's]] president and G M Syed, who has been a staunch Leaguer and became highly instrumental in the passage of a Sindh Assembly resolution in favour of Pakistan as back as 1936, the secretary-general. A month later Ghaffar Khan was arrested under the Frontier Crimes Regulations. More or less at the same time, Mian Iftikharud Din, a leftist feudal who was the Punjab president of the Muslim League at the time of [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] and later disillusioned with the PML affairs like G M Syed, founded with like-minded people like Mian MahmoodAli Kasuri, Faiz Ahmad Faiz etc., the Azad Pakistan Party in Punjab and it remained in opposition to the Muslim League government in the provincial assembly. The party had a number of Communist Party members in it fold. The party held regular meetings showing concern over the provincial and central governments till 1953 when most of its leaders were arrested in the Rawalpindi Conspiracy case leading to its demise.

After the death of the Quaid-i-Azam, provincial organisations were elected. Mumtaz Daultana was elected as Punjab president on 25 Nov 1948 and Khuhro, who was facing corruption charges under the Public Representative Office Disqualification Act (PRODA) before a special tribunal, was returned Sindh president unopposed on 5 Dec. Khuhro was convicted for three years in prison. But Sindh Chief Court acquitted him on an appeal and he re-took the party office that he had relinquished in view of trial against him. [[Liaquat Ali Khan]] the PML organisations started a campaign against [[Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman]], the party president and chief organiser, and he quit both the office leaving two major party offices vacant. The party’s central council met in Karachi on 8 Oct 1950 and elected Prime Minister Liaqat Ali Khan the new party president.Following his footsteps, Punjab chief minister Mumtaz Daultana took over as the president of the provincial party and NWFP chief minister Khan Abdul Qayyum Khan also became the provincial party chief.The process continued as [[Khwaja Nazimuddin]], who was the country’s second Governor-General after the Quaid-i-Azam, was elected as prime minister after the assassination of Liaqat Ali Khan. Pakistan’s finance minister Ghulam Mohammad then became the third GG. Later, Nazimuddin also became the PML president on 16 Nov 1951. Also all the prime ministers were "elected" the PML presidents and all chief ministers the provincial presidents of the party. The only exception was Chaudhry Mohammad Ali who took over as the prime minister after Mohammad Ali Bogra. Bogra was also the PML president but with Chaudhry Mohammad Ali as the prime minister, Sardar Abdur Rab Nishtar was elected the PML president.

The first humiliation that the PML faced was the election in East Pakistan where Awami League headed by H S Suhrawardy with Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhshani as the AL president of the East Pakistan organisation and Krishik Saramic (Peasant and labour) of [[Sher-e-Bangla]] [[A. K. Fazlul Haq]] formed the Jukto (United) Front. The Front inflicted so heavy a defeat on the PML as to reduce it to bag only 10 of 238 Muslim seats in the 300-member East Pakistan Assembly. The defeat was so complete as to see Nurul Amin, the provincial chief minister and PML president of the province, losing against young man who contested on the AL ticket. [[Sher-e-Bangla]] [[A. K. Fazlul Haq]] was elected the new chief minister but the central government imposed governor’s rule after bloody riots in three factories, Khulna Jute Mills, Khulna Match Facorty and Karnafulli Paper Mills. Maj Gen Iskandar Mirza, a member of the federal cabinet, was appointed the governor. He held the Communist Party responsible for riots. The party was banned and hundreds of its activists arrested, Governor-General Ghulam Mohammad dissolved the Constituent Assembly on 24 Oct 1954 at a time when the west and eat Pakistan leadership had reached a consensus formula for the new constitution and all in Pakistan expected the constitution would be adopted in another one month or so. Speaker Maulvi Tameezud Din Khan moved the Sindh High Court despite all difficulties that included closing down in the assembly building with a lock on the main gate. The SHC declared the governor-general’s dissolution order as illegal and restored the constituent assembly. The federation moved the Supreme Court in an appeal which was accepted by a bench headed by Chief Justice Mohammad Munir who used, for the first time, the phrase of "Doctrine of necessity". Simultaneously, GG appointed a new team of minister who also included Iskandar Mirza, Dr Khan Sahib and C-in-C Gen Mohammad Ayub Khan in uniform. Bogra was retained as prime minister and he announced the formation of One-Unit of West Pakistan on 22 Nov 1954. H S Suhrawady also joined the cabinet later. Mushtaq Ahmad Gurmani was appointed the first governor of West Pakistan and Dr Khan Sahib became chief minister.

The new junta forced Ghulam Mohammad to resign and Iskandar Mirza became the new Governor-General on 6 Aug 1955 with Chaudhry Mohammad Ali as prime minister. He was heading a coalition government at the center comprising PML, Awami League and Krishak Saramik Party. After the passage of the maiden constitution in 1956, Iskandar Mirza became the first president of Pakistan. Party president Sradar Abdur Rab Nishtar asked the party to form a parliamentary group in the new assembly. The process began with conspiracies and Iskandar Mirza had his own plans. He wanted his close friend Dr Khan Sahib to head the party. Leaguers did not trust him as parliamentary leader. They wanted Sardar Bahadur Khan to be their leader and elected him as such with the support of 127 members.. But Dr Khan Sahib, also the interim chief minister, used his close association with the powerful president as a lever and solicited the support of about 70 members of the house called "The One-Unit Group". Most of them were "Muslim League stalwarts" and custodians of the ideological front belonging to their old Unionist Party". As the chances of Dr Khan Sahib becoming dim as parliamentary leader, Iskandar Mirza decided to float the idea of forming the Republican Party with Dr Khan Sahib as president. The new party caused a huge defection in the ML camp and most of its members joined the Republican Party overnight. This Punjab-centered party later formed the new West Pakistan government.

Two powerful Bengali leaders and former Muslim League members, Hussein Shahid Suhrawardy and Maulvi A K Fazlul Haq, used their own parties, the Awami League and the Krishak Sramik Party (Workers and Peasants), in a joint effort in 1954 to defeat the Muslim League in the first election held in East Pakistan after [[Pakistan Movement|independence]]. Fazlul Haq had made the motion to adopt the historic "Pakistan Resolution" in 1940, and Suhrawardy, subsequently the last chief minister of undivided Bengal, had seconded it. Both men were alienated by West Pakistani domination of the Muslim League. Suhrawardy was elected leader of the opposition in the second Constituent Assembly and in 1956 was appointed prime minister, a further loss for the Muslim League because he was the first non-Muslim League politician to hold this position. By this time, the Muslim League had lost its influence in both East Pakistan and West Pakistan, having also lost its majority in the [[West Pakistan]] Legislative Assembly to the Punjab-centered [[Republican Party (Pakistan)|Republican Party]].

==First Phase (1962-1969)==
{{main_article|Convention Muslim League}}
{{see also|Muhammad Ayub Khan}}

The promulgation of martial law in 1958 and the dissolution of all political parties finally resulted in the demise of the Muslim League after its fifty-two- year existence.Gen Mohammad [[Ayub Khan (general)|Ayub Khan]], the first Commander-in-Chief after Pakistan came into being, assumed power imposing the first Martial law in the country on 8 Oct 1958, on the insinuation of [[Iskandar Mirza]]. He took over first the chief martial law administrator but within days booted out Mirza to become the president and banned all political parties including the ruling [[Republican Party (Pakistan)|Republican Party]] and the ML. But Ayub Khan was a politically ambitious person. In 1962, he lifted martial law and, for the first time used as the dictator of the time, the Pakistan Muslim League that he formed at a "Convention" as was named the [[Convention Muslim League]]. All the Republican Party members joined the Convention League. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, a young member of the martial law cabinet, was appointed by Ayub Khan as the first secretary-general of the CML and he was succeeded by Malik Mohammad Qasim who later used to say that "That (becoming CML’s secretary-general) is the only black spot on my fair political face”. The other PML of the time was he Council Muslim League headed by Mumtaz Daultana and included people like [[Abdul Qayyum Khan]]. Ayub held Basic Democracies elections in 1964 using his party for the first time. He used 80,000 BD members to form an electoral college for the presidential election in [[Pakistani presidential election, 1965]] in which he faced Mohammad Ali Jinnah’s sister [[Fatima Jinnah]] as a strong opponent with Council Muslim League throwing its weight behind her. Though Ayub won, he fell from grace and was ultimately made to quit in the wake of a popular movement that the newly formed Pakistan People's Party (formed on 30 November 1969 in Lahore). But when Ayub left, he handed over Pakistan to Army Commander-in-Chief [[Yahya Khan]] to impose the second martial law.

==Second Phase (1969-1977)==
{{main article|Nurul Amin}}

After the resignation of President [[Ayub Khan (general)|Ayub Khan]], Pakistan Muslim League once again united under the leadership of the [[Conservatism|conservative]] political veteran, [[Nurul Amin]]. Although the schims came closer ideologically, they were not ready to accept each other's domination. This is the reason that the schims competed against each other in [[Pakistani general election, 1970|1970 Elections]].

Following the death of [[Nurul Amin]], the PML went into political abyss but made its notable comeback in a direct response to [[Nationalization in Pakistan|nationalization]] and the outgrowth of [[Socialism in Pakistan|leftism]] in the country under the [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto|Bhutto administration]]. In the 1970s, the PML led by [[Pir Pagara]] was benefited with the financial support of industrialists, including [[Nawaz Sharif]] and [[Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain|Shujat Hussain]], and intelligentsia that included lawyers, [[Fida Mohammad Khan|Fida Mohammad]] and [[Javed Hashmi]].

Efforts of [[Pir Pagara]] assimilated of majority of the factions of the Pakistan Muslim League, in a bid to mount a strong opposition to the leftist [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] (PPP) in the 1970s. It may be noted that all factions will continue to hold their individual identities, as the PML was treated as a platform for parties to come together.

==Third Phase (1977-1985)==
{{main article|Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq}}

In 1977 Martial Law, [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|General Zia-ul-Haq]] took power after [[Operation Fair Play|overthrowing the Bhutto government]]. In 1985, after the [[Pakistani general election, 1985|election]], Zia appointed [[Muhammad Khan Junejo]] as the new [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]]. Junejo, with a large group of pro-Zia conservatives founded an entirely new party by the name of Pakistan Muslim League. Junejo however soon started to lose the support of party due to his opposition to Zia. Meanwhile, other influential politicians like [[Nawaz Sharif]] and [[Fida Mohammad Khan]] started to gain power.

After the [[Death of Zia-ul-Haq]] in 1988, democracy returned and new [[Pakistani general election, 1988]] elections were supposed to be held. Junejo spilt away from the party and formed [[Pakistan Muslim League (J)]]. Meanwhile, Fida became the party chairman and Sharif the General-Secretary. Pakistan Muslim League allied with [[Jamaat-e-Islami]] and other right-wing parties to form the [[Islami Jamhoori Ittehad|Islamic Democratic Alliance]] against the left-wing [[Pakistan Peoples Party]]. This event marked the end of the Pakistan Muslim League.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2887">The '''Pakistan Muslim League (Jinnah)''' ([[Urdu]]: '''پاکستان مسلم لیگ جناح''') was a [[political party]] in [[Pakistan]]. It was one of the factions of the original [[Pakistan Muslim League]], named after the founder of Pakistan [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]].

PML (Jinnah) was formed by [[Manzoor Wattoo]] and [[Sardar Mushtaq Ahmed Khan Malezai]] in 1995 when they parted ways with Wattoo's cousin [[Hamid Nasir Chattha]], who wanted to be the president of his own PML faction, [[Pakistan Muslim League (J)|PML (Junejo)]], which Wattoo and Mushtaq Khan were previously a part of. The differences cropped up in the same year when Wattoo was removed as the [[Chief Minister of Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab Chief Minister]] and Mushtaq Ahmed Khan was also removed as [[Law Minister of Punjab (Pakistan)]] in the power struggle between the province (headed by PML-Junejo) and the center (headed by rival [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]]), leading Arif Nakai another PML (Junejo) candidate to be the new Chief Minister and Sardar Mushtaq Ahmed was replaced by his arch enemy Raja Sarfraz as the new minister.

In May 2004, PML (Jinnah) without Sardar Mushtaq Ahmed Khan Malezai who joined PML(N) in 1997 merged with PML (Q) along with other parties to form united [[Pakistan Muslim League (Q)|PML]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Ashraf|last = Mumtaz|url = http://www.dawn.com/2004/05/20/nat1.htm|title = Parties to inform EC about merger with PML|publisher = Dawn |date = May 20, 2004|accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in [[Pakistani general election, 2008|2008 general election]], Manzoor Wattoo and his daughter Rubina Shaheen Wattoo sought elections independently (and won 3 seats in total) while Sardar Mushtaq Ahmed Khan Malezai died before that in 2006. It was later stated that Wattoo will bring back PML (Jinnah) with help of Mushtaq Ahmed Khans brothers and the reason he didn't run on PML (Jinnah) ticket was because he failed the deadline to register it with the Election Commission.

In May 2008, Manzoor Wattoo along with his daughter Rubina Shaheen Wattoo left Pakistan Muslim League (Jinnah) and joined [[Pakistan Peoples Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/2008/05/30/nat1.htm "Wattoo, associates join PPP"] ''Daily Dawn'', May 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Since their merger with PML-Q, this faction/break-away group is now defunct in the politics for the moment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1084">'''Parallel society'''  refers to the self-organization of an ethnic or religious minority, often immigrant groups, with the intent of a reduced or minimal spatial, social and cultural contact with the majority society into which they immigrate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpb.de/publikationen/URZDVA Parallelgesellschaften?], ''Aus Politik und Zeitgeschichte'', No. 1–2 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was introduced into the debate about [[Human migration|migration]] and [[Social integration|integration]] in the early 1990s by the German sociologist [[Wilhelm Heitmeyer]] . It rose to prominence in the European public discourse following the murder of Dutch director and critic of Islam [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]]. In 2004, it was elected by the [[Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache|Association for the German Language]] second as [[Word of the year]].

The Pashtun colonization of northern Afghanistan allowed Abdur Rahman Khan to strengthen his rule over the non-Pashtun lands in [[Afghan Turkestan]].&lt;ref name="sciencedirect1"/&gt; In addition to this, this Pashtun colonization resulted in Pashtun settlers acquiring the best land in northern Afghanistan at the expense of the [[Turkmens]], [[Uzbeks]], [[Tajiks]], and other peoples who previously owned this land.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect1"/&gt; While all of the Pashtuns who migrated to northern Afghanistan before 1885 had done so involuntarily (often exiled for opposing the policies of the Afghan government), this changed after 1885, when Abdur Rahman began offering incentives for ethnic Pashtuns to voluntarily settle in northern Afghanistan (while also making this migration one-way by issuing a decree in 1885 which forbade any migration in the other direction).&lt;ref name="sciencedirect1"/&gt; Ethnic Pashtuns who voluntarily migrated to northern Afghanistan often had their travel expenses paid for and were given animals, free land, and a three-year exemption from taxes.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect1"/&gt; Abdur Rahman's policies of encouraging Pashtuns to settle in northern Afghanistan voluntarily ended up achieving more success than previous attempts at forced settlement (especially involuntary attempts which involved [[nomad]]s).&lt;ref name="sciencedirect1"/&gt; However, in spite of the incentive-based voluntary migration in force in 1885, many ethnic Pashtuns ended up being deported to northern Afghanistan even after 1885 (in some cases as late as the 1940s).&lt;ref name="sciencedirect1"/&gt; Between 1885 and 1888, the Pashtun population in northern Afghanistan might have increased eightfold–from 3,500 Pashtun families in 1885 to 40,000 Pashtun families in 1888.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect1"/&gt; Rebellions such as the [[Ghilzai Pashtuns]]' rebellions in eastern Afghanistan and Sardar Muhammad Ishaq's rebellion temporarily stopped Pashtun colonization of northern Afghanistan in the late 1880s.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect1"/&gt; Afterwards, despite another short period of colonization, the [[Hazaras#Second uprising|Hazara War]] broke out in the early 1890s, ending the Pashtunization of northern Afghanistan during Abdur Rahman’s reign (1880–1901) (though it would resume under Abdur Rahman's successors after his death).&lt;ref name="sciencedirect1"/&gt;

==Later colonization==
Between the 1910s and the 1940s, many ethnic Pashtun [[herder]]s settled in Afghan Turkestan.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect1"/&gt; From the 1930s to the 1970s, after the ethnically [[Tajiks|Tajik]] [[Habibullah Kalakani]] attempted and failed to seize power in Afghanistan in 1929, ethnic Uzbeks and ethnic Tajiks lost hundreds of thousands of acres of [[pasture]] and [[cultivated land]] in northern Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect1"/&gt; Afterwards, this land was sold or outright given to ethnic Pashtun settlers, further increasing Pashtun influence in northern Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect1"/&gt; During this time, Pashtun settlers in [[Takhar Province]] pushed [[Moghol]], Tajik, and [[Karluks|Qarluq]] farmers as well as Uzbek herders out of irrigated lowlands and into foothills with little agricultural value.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect1"/&gt; As a result of the 19th and 20th century Pashtun colonization policies that Afghan governments pursued, Pashtuns became the dominant [[ethnic group]] in the developed agricultural areas in northern Afghanistan, while other ethnic groups (especially the [[Uzbeks]]) came to dominate in the underdeveloped [[foothills]].&lt;ref name="sciencedirect1"/&gt; By the start of the 1970s, ethnic Pashtuns constituted 56% of the total population in the [[Baghlan]] area, 61% of the total population in the [[Puli Khumri]] area, 41% of the total population in the Tajik-plurality [[Kunduz]] area, 45% of the total population in the [[Khan Abad District|Khanabad]] area, and just 10% of the total population in the Uzbek-majority [[Taloqan]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=usKgVnMJMXUC&amp;pg=PA31|title=The Central Asian Arabs of Afghanistan: Pastoral Nomadism in Transition|author=Thomas J.

'''Peace and conflict studies''' is a [[social science]] field that identifies and analyzes [[violence|violent]] and [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] behaviours as well as the structural mechanisms attending [[Conflict (process)|conflicts]] (including [[social conflict]]s), with a view towards understanding those processes which lead to a more desirable [[human condition]].&lt;ref&gt;Dugan, 1989: 74&lt;/ref&gt; A variation on this, peace studies ('''irenology'''), is an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] effort aiming at the prevention, de-escalation, and solution of conflicts by peaceful means, thereby seeking "victory" for all parties involved in the conflict. This is in contrast to [[military studies]], which has as its aim on the efficient attainment of victory in conflicts, primarily by violent means to the satisfaction of one or more, but not all, parties involved. Disciplines involved may include [[philosophy]], [[political science]], [[geography]], [[economics]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[international relations]], [[history]], [[anthropology]], [[religious studies]], and [[gender studies]], as well as a variety of others. Relevant sub-disciplines of such fields, such as [[peace economics]], may be regarded as belonging to peace and conflict studies also.

==Historical background==
{{See also|Peace movement#History}}
Peace and conflict studies is both a pedagogical activity, in which teachers transmit knowledge to students; and a research activity, in which researchers create new knowledge about the sources of conflict. Peace and conflict studies entails understanding the concept of peace which is defined as political condition that ensures justice and social stability through formal and informal institutions, practices, and norms.Addo's con firmament

===As pedagogical activity===
Academics and students in the world's oldest universities have long been motivated by an interest in [[peace]]. American student interest in what we today think of as peace studies first appeared in the form of campus clubs at United States colleges in the years immediately following the [[American Civil War]]. Similar movements appeared in Sweden in the last years of the 19th century, as elsewhere soon after. These were student-originated discussion groups, not formal courses included in college curricula.

The [[First World War]] was a turning point in Western attitudes to war. At the 1919 [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Peace of Paris]]—where the leaders of France, Britain, and the United States, led by [[Georges Clemenceau]], [[David Lloyd George]], and [[Woodrow Wilson]] respectively, met to decide the future of Europe—Wilson proposed his famous [[Fourteen Points]] for peacemaking. These included breaking up European empires into nation states and the establishment of the [[League of Nations]]. These moves, intended to ensure a peaceful future, were the background to a number of developments in the emergence of Peace and Conflict Studies as an academic discipline (but they also, as [[Keynes]] presciently pointed out, laid the seeds for future conflict).&lt;ref&gt;Keynes 1920&lt;/ref&gt; The founding of the first chair in International Relations at [[Aberystwyth University]], [[Wales]], whose remit was partly to further the cause of peace, occurred in 1919.

[[File:Manchester College Administration Building.jpg|thumb|left|Indiana's [[Manchester University (Indiana)|Manchester College]] was one of the first institutions to offer a [[Major (academic)|major]] in peace studies]] 
After [[World War II]], the founding of the [[UN system]] provided a further stimulus for more rigorous approaches to peace and conflict studies to emerge. Many university courses in schools of higher learning around the world began to develop which touched upon questions of peace, often in relation to war, during this period.  The first undergraduate academic program in peace studies in the United States was developed in 1948 by Gladdys Muir, at [[Manchester University (Indiana)|Manchester University]] a liberal arts college located in [[North Manchester, Indiana]].&lt;ref name=jg&gt;{{cite news|first=Holly |last=Abrams |title=Peace studies pioneer dies at 77
|url=http://www.journalgazette.net/article/20101104/LOCAL/311049973/1002/LOCAL|work=[[The Journal Gazette]] |publisher=|date=2010-11-04 |accessdate=2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the late 1960s in the United States that student concerns about the [[Vietnam War]] forced ever more universities to offer courses about peace, whether in a designated peace studies course or as a course within a traditional major. Work by academics such as [[Johan Galtung]] and [[John Burton (diplomat)|John Burton]], and debates in fora such as the ''[[Journal of Peace Research]]'' in the 1960s reflected the growing interest and academic stature of the field.&lt;ref&gt;Wallensteen 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Growth in the number of peace studies programs around the world was to accelerate during the 1980s, as students became more concerned about the prospects of nuclear war. As the [[Cold War]] ended, peace and conflict studies courses shifted their focus from international conflict&lt;ref name="Harris, Fisk, and Rank 1998"&gt;Harris, Fisk, and Rank 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and towards complex issues related to political violence, [[human security]], [[democratisation]], [[human rights]], [[social justice]], [[welfare]], [[Social development|development]], and producing sustainable forms of peace.  A proliferation of international organisations, agencies and international NGOs, from the UN, [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], [[European Union]], and [[World Bank]] to [[International Crisis Group]], [[International Alert]], and others, began to draw on such research.&lt;ref name="Miall, Ramsbotham, &amp; Woodhouse 2005"&gt;Miall, Ramsbotham, &amp; Woodhouse 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Agendas relating to positive peace in European academic contexts were already widely debated in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Galtung 1971&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1990s peace studies curricula in the United States had shifted "...from research and teaching about negative peace, the cessation of violence, to positive peace, the conditions that eliminate the causes of violence."&lt;ref name="Harris, Fisk, and Rank 1998"/&gt; As a result, the topics had broadened enormously. By 1994, a review of course offerings in peace studies included topics such as: "north-south relations"; "development, debt, and global poverty"; "the environment, population growth, and resource scarcity"; and "feminist perspectives on peace, militarism, and political violence."&lt;ref name="Harris, Fisk, and Rank 1998"/&gt;

There is now a general consensus on the importance of peace and conflict studies among scholars from a range of disciplines in and around the social sciences, as well as from many influential policymakers around the world. Peace and conflict studies today is widely researched and taught in a large and growing number of institutions and locations. The number of universities offering peace and conflict studies courses is hard to estimate, mostly because courses may be taught out of different departments and have very different names. The [http://ipra.terracuranda.org/ International Peace Research Association website] gives one of the most authoritative listings available. A 2008 report in the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' mentions over 400 programs of teaching and research in peace and conflict studies, noting in particular those at the [[United World Colleges]], [[Peace Research Institute Oslo]], [[Universitat Jaume I]] in [[Castellón de la Plana|Castellón de la Plana/Spain]], the [https://edu.mah.se/en/Course/FK110L?v=3&amp;full=true Malmö University of Sweden], the [[American University]], [[University of Bradford]], the UN mandated Peace University [[UPEACE]] in [[Ciudad Colón]]/[[Costa Rica]], [[School for Conflict Analysis and Resolution|George Mason University]], [[Lund]], [[Michigan]], [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]], [[Queensland]], [[Uppsala]], [[Innsbruck]]/[[Austria]], [[Virginia]], and [[Wisconsin]]. The [[Rotary Foundation]] and the [[UN University]] supports several international academic teaching and research programs.

A 1995 survey found 136 United States colleges with peace studies programs: "Forty-six percent of these are in church related schools, another 32% are in large public universities, 21% are in non-church related private colleges, and 1% are in community colleges. Fifty-five percent of the church related schools that have peace studies programs are [[Roman Catholic]]. Other denominations with more than one college or university with a peace studies program are the [[Quakers]], [[Mennonites]], [[Church of the Brethren]], and [[United Church of Christ]]. One hundred fifteen of these programs are at the undergraduate level and 21 at the graduate level. Fifteen of these colleges and universities had both undergraduate and graduate programs."&lt;ref name="Harris, Fisk, and Rank 1998"/&gt;

Other notable programs can be found at the [[University of Manitoba]], [[Lancaster University]], [[Hiroshima University]], [[University of Innsbruck]], [[Universitat Jaume I]], [[University of Sydney]], [[University of Queensland]], [[King's College (London)]], [[Sault College]], [[London Metropolitan University|London Metropolitan]], [[Sabancı University|Sabanci]], [[University of Marburg|Marburg]], [[Sciences Po]], [[Université Paris Dauphine]] [[University of Amsterdam]], [[University of Otago|Otago]], [[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]], and [[University of York|York]]. Perhaps most importantly, such programs and research agendas have now become common in institutions located in conflict, post-conflict, and developing countries and regions such as (e.g., National Peace Council), [[Centre for Human Rights]], [[University of Sarajevo]], [[Chulalongkorn University]], [[National University of East Timor]], [[University of Kabul]],

===As research activity===
[[File:JohanGaltung-Genève-1992.jpg|thumb|right|Norwegian academic [[Johan Galtung]] is widely regarded as a founder of peace and conflict studies]]
Although individual thinkers such as [[Immanuel Kant]] had long recognised the centrality of peace (see [[Perpetual Peace]]), it was not until the 1950s and 1960s that peace studies began to emerge as an academic discipline with its own research tools, a specialized set of concepts, and forums for discussion such as journals and conferences. Beginning in 1959, with the founding of the [[Peace Research Institute Oslo]]- PRIO&amp;nbsp;– (associated with [[Johan Galtung]]), a number of research institutes began to appear.&lt;ref name="Harris, Fisk, and Rank 1998"/&gt;

In 1963, [[Walter Isard]], the principal founder of [[Regional science]] assembled a group of scholars in [[Malmö]], Sweden, for the purpose of establishing the Peace Research Society.  The group of initial members included [[Kenneth Boulding]] and [[Anatol Rapoport]]. In 1973, this group became the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110413215748/http://pss.la.psu.edu/ Peace Science Society]. Peace science was viewed as an interdisciplinary and international effort to develop a special set of concepts, techniques and data to better understand and mitigate conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pss.la.psu.edu/2007-History.htm Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826214216/http://pss.la.psu.edu/2007-History.htm |date=2007-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peace science attempts to use the quantitative techniques developed in economics and political science, especially [[game theory]] and [[econometrics]], techniques otherwise seldom used by researchers in peace studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.einaudi.cornell.edu/PeaceProgram/student/minor.asp Peace Studies Program&amp;nbsp;– Student Information- Graduate Minor Field&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Peace Science Society website hosts the second edition of the [[Correlates of War]], one of the most well-known collections of data on international conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cow2.la.psu.edu/ Correlates of War 2]&lt;/ref&gt; The society holds an annual conference, attended by scholars from throughout the world, and publishes two scholarly journals: ''[[Journal of Conflict Resolution]]'' and ''[[Conflict Management and Peace Science]]''.

In 1964, the [[International Peace Research Association]] was formed at a conference organized by [[Quaker]]s in Clarens, Switzerland. Among the original executive committee was [[Johan Galtung]]. The IPRA holds a biennial conference. Research presented at its conferences and in its publications typically focuses on institutional and historical approaches, seldom employing quantitative techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soc.kuleuven.be/pol/ipra/about/history.html|title=KU Leuven Faculteit Sociale Wetenschappen - Centrum Voor Politicologie - Algemeen|publisher=|accessdate=28 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203152016/http://soc.kuleuven.be/pol/ipra/about/history.html|archivedate=3 December 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the [[Peace and Justice Studies Association]] (PJSA) was formed as a result of a merger of two precursor organisations. The PJSA is the North American affiliate of IPRA and includes members from around the world with a predominance from the United States and Canada. The PJSA publishes a regular newsletter (''The Peace Chronicle''), and holds annual conferences on themes related to the organization's mission "to create a just and peaceful world" through research, scholarship, pedagogy, and activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peacejusticestudies.org/about.php|title=About the Peace and Justice Studies Association|publisher=|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[Strategic Foresight Group]] presented its report on an innovative mechanism to find sustainable solution to conflicts in the Middle East. It also developed a new Water Cooperation Quotient,&lt;ref&gt;http://strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/28799WCQ-web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which is a measure of active cooperation by riparian countries in the management of water resources using 10 parameters including legal, political, technical, environmental, economic and institutional aspects.

==Description==
Peace studies can be classified as:
*  Multidisciplinary, encompassing elements of [[Politics]] and [[International Relations]] (particularly [[critical international relations theory]]), [[Sociology]], [[Psychology]], [[Anthropology]] and [[Economics]]. [[Critical theory]] is also widely used in peace and conflict studies.
*  Multilevel.  Peace studies examines intrapersonal peace, peace between individuals, neighbours, ethnic groups, marriages, states and civilisations.
*  Multicultural. [[Gandhi]] is often cited as a paradigm of Peace Studies.  However, true multiculturalism remains an aspiration as most Peace Studies centres are located in the West.
*  Both [[Analytic induction|analytic]] and [[norm (sociology)|normative]].  As a normative discipline, Peace Studies involves value judgements, such as "better" and "bad".
*  Both theoretical and applied.&lt;ref name="Miall, Ramsbotham, &amp; Woodhouse 2005"/&gt;

There has been a long-standing and vibrant debate on [[disarmament]] issues, as well as attempts to investigate, catalogue, and analyse issues relating to arms production, trade, and their political impacts.&lt;ref&gt;SIPRI 2007: Cooper, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been attempt to map the economic costs of war, or of relapses into violence, as opposed to those of peace.

Peace and conflict studies is now well established within the [[social sciences]]: it comprises many scholarly journals, college and university departments, peace research institutes, conferences, as well as outside recognition of the utility of peace and conflict studies as a method.

Peace Studies allows one to examine the causes and prevention of war, as well as the nature of violence, including social oppression, discrimination and marginalization.  Through peace studies one can also learn peace-making strategies to overcome persecution and transform society to attain a more just and equitable international community.

Feminist scholars have developed a speciality within conflict studies, specifically examining the role of gender in armed conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Cohn, C. (2013). ''Women and wars.'' Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Owen2013&gt;{{cite news|last1=Owen|first1=Jean|title=Book Review: Women and Wars, ed.

Examples of feminist scholarship include the work of [[Carol Cohn]] and [[Claire Duncanson]].

===Conceptions of peace===
{{see also|Peace#Theories}}
[[File:General W. K. Harrison, Jr., signs armistice ending 3-year Korean conflict. Genearl Harrison, left table, and North... - NARA - 520995.tif|thumb|left|Delegates at the 1953 [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] achieved negative peace, ending [[Korean War|the war]] but not [[Korean conflict|the wider conflict]]]]
The negative and positive peace framework is the most widely used today. Negative peace refers to the absence of direct violence. Positive peace refers to the absence of indirect and [[structural violence]], and is the concept that most peace and conflict researchers adopt. This is often credited to Galtung&lt;ref name="Galtung &amp; Jacobsen 2000"&gt;Galtung &amp; Jacobsen 2000&lt;/ref&gt; but these terms were previously used by Martin Luther King in the [[q:Martin Luther King, Jr.|Letter from a Birmingham Jail in 1953]], in which he wrote about "negative peace which is the absence of tension" and "positive peace which is the presence of justice." These terms were perhaps first used by Jane Addams in 1907 in her book [https://books.google.ca/books?id=gVwrAVfjYJMC&amp;dq=william+james+positive+peace&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Newer Ideals of Peace].

Several conceptions, models, or modes of peace have been suggested in which peace research might prosper.&lt;ref&gt;among many, Richmond 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

*The crux of the matter is that peace is a natural social condition, whereas war is not.  The premise is simple for peace researchers: to present enough information so that a rational group of decision makers will seek to avoid war and conflict.
*Second, the view that violence is sinful or unskillful, and that non-violence is skillful or virtuous and should be cultivated. This view is held by a variety of religious traditions worldwide: Quakers, Mennonites and other [[Peace churches]] within Christianity; [[Jainism|Jains]], [[Satyagraha|the Satyagraha tradition in Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and other portions of [[Indian philosophy|Indian religion and philosophy]]; as well as certain schools of [[Islam]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}.
*Third is [[pacifism]]: the view that peace is a prime force in human behaviour.
* A further approach is that there are multiple modes of peace.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]], Daniela Ingruber, Josefina Echavarría, Gustavo Esteva and Norbert Koppensteiner (eds.): The Palgrave International Handbook of Peace Studies: A Cultural Perspective, London, Palgrave Macmillan, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many offerings on these various forms of peace. These range from the well known works of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[Rousseau]], [[Thomas Paine|Paine]], on various liberal international and constitutional and plans for peace. Variations and additions have been developed more recently by scholars such as Raymond Aron, Edward Azar, John Burton, Martin Ceadal, [http://homepage.univie.ac.at/w.dietrich/php/cms/ Wolfgang Dietrich], Kevin Dooley, [[Johan Galtung]], Michael Howard, [[Vivienne Jabri]], John-Paul Lederach, Roger Mac Ginty, Hugh Miall, David Mitrany, [http://www.bradford.ac.uk/acad/confres/html/oramsbotham.html Oliver Ramsbotham], [[Anatol Rapoport]], [http://polsci.ku.dk/english/staff/detaljer/?id=29769 Mikkel Vedby Rasmussen], [https://manchester.academia.edu/OliverRichmond Oliver Richmond], [[S. P. Udayakumar|S.P. Udayakumar]], [http://www.brad.ac.uk/peace/academic/proftomwoodhouse/ Tom Woodhouse], others mentioned above and many more. [[Democratic peace]], liberal peace, sustainable peace, civil peace, hybrid peace, post-liberal peace, trans-rational peace(s)and other concepts are regularly used in such work.

===Sustainable peace===
Under the conceptions of peace, sustainable peace must be regarded as an important factor for the future of prosperity. Sustainable peace must be the priority of global society where state actors and non-state actors do not only seek for the profits in a near future that might violate the stable state of peace. For a sustainable peace, nurturing, empowerment, and communications are considered to be the crucial factors throughout the world. Firstly, nurturing is necessary to encourage psychological stability and emotional maturity. The significance of social value in adequate nurturing is important for sustainable peace. Secondly, in order to achieve real security, inner security must be secured along with arranged social systems and protection based on firm foundation. Lastly, communications are necessary to overcome ignorance and establish a community based on reliable and useful information. It will prevents isolation to take place which is critical to bring sustainable peace.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Gilman, Sustainable Peace putting the pieces together, The Foundations of Peace (IC#4)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict triangle===
[[Johan Galtung]]'s [[Violence Peace and Peace Research|conflict triangle]] works on the assumption that the best way to define peace is to define violence, its opposite.  It reflects the normative aim of preventing, managing, limiting and overcoming violence.&lt;ref name="Galtung &amp; Jacobsen 2000"/&gt;

* Direct (overt) violence, e.g., direct attack, massacre.
* Structural violence.  Death by avoidable reasons such as malnutrition.  Structural violence is indirect violence caused by an unjust structure and is not to be equated with an [[act of God]].
* Cultural violence.  Cultural violence occurs as a result of the cultural assumptions that blind one to direct or structural violence.  For example, one may be indifferent toward the homeless, or even consider their expulsion or extermination a good thing.
Each corner of Galtung's triangle can relate to the other two. [[Ethnic cleansing]] can be an example of all three.

To simply understand these three

• Direct violence = harming or hurting body &amp; mind
• Structural violence= economic exploitation &amp; political repression
• Cultural violence = underlying values &amp; epistemic models that legitimize direct &amp; structural violence

===Cost of conflict===

[[Cost of conflict]] is a tool which attempts to calculate the price of conflict to the human race. The idea is to examine this cost, not only in terms of the deaths and casualties and the economic costs borne by the people involved, but also the social, developmental, environmental and strategic costs of conflict. The approach considers direct costs of conflict, for instance human deaths, expenditure, destruction of land and physical infrastructure; as well as indirect costs that impact a society, for instance migration, humiliation, growth of extremism and lack of civil society.

[[Strategic Foresight Group]], a think tank in [[India]], has developed a Cost of Conflict Series for countries and regions involved in protracted conflicts. This tool is aimed at assessing past, present and future costs looking at a wide range of parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategicforesight.com/|title=Strategic Foresight Group - Anticipating and Influencing Global Future|publisher=|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Normative aims==
[[File:Pak-Uvira-32 (8137982111).jpg|thumb|right|[[Peacekeeping]] efforts by [[armed forces]] can provide one means to limit and ultimately resolve conflict]]
The normative aims of peace studies are [[conflict transformation]] and [[conflict resolution]] through mechanisms such as [[peacekeeping]], peacebuilding (e.g., tackling disparities in rights, institutions and the distribution of world wealth) and peacemaking (e.g., mediation and conflict resolution).  Peacekeeping falls under the aegis of negative peace, whereas efforts toward positive peace involve elements of peace building and peacemaking.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching peace and conflict studies to the military==

One of the interesting developments within peace and conflict studies is the number of military personnel undertaking such studies.  This poses some challenges, as the military is an institution overtly committed to combat.  In the article "Teaching Peace to the Military", published in the journal [[Peace Review]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.qut.edu.au/archive/00007876/ Page, James S. 2007. 'Teaching Peace to the Military'. [[Peace Review]], 19(4):571–577].&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Smith Page|James Page]] argues for five principles that ought to undergird this undertaking, namely, respect but do not privilege military experience, teach the just war theory, encourage students to be aware of the tradition and techniques of nonviolence, encourage students to deconstruct and demythologize, and recognize the importance of military virtue.

== Critical peace and conflict studies: hybridity, trans-rational peace, and elicitive conflict transformation ==
Scholars working in the areas of peace and conflict studies have made significant contributions to the policies used by non-governmental organisations, development agencies, international financial institutions, and the UN system, in the specific areas of conflict resolution and citizen diplomacy, development, political, social, and economic reform, peacekeeping, mediation, early warning, prevention, peacebuilding, and statebuilding.&lt;ref&gt;Wallensteen, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; This represented a shift in interest from conflict management approaches oriented towards a "negative peace" to conflict resolution and peacebuilding approaches aimed at a "positive peace". This emerged rapidly at the end of the Cold War, and was encapsulated in the report of then-UN Secretary-General [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]], ''[[An Agenda for Peace]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Boutros Ghali 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it might be said that much of the machinery of what has been called "liberal peacebuilding" by a number of scholars&lt;ref&gt;Duffield, 2001, Paris, 2004, Richmond, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and "statebuilding" by another&lt;ref&gt;Caplan 2005, Chandler, 2006, Fukuyama, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; is based largely on the work that has been carried out in this area. Many scholars in the area have advocated a more "emancipatory" form of peacebuilding, however, based upon a "[[Responsibility to Protect]]" (R2P),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.responsibilitytoprotect.org|title=International Coalition for the Responsibility to Protect (ICRtoP)|publisher=|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; human security,&lt;ref&gt;Tadjbakhsh &amp; Chenoy 2006&lt;/ref&gt; local ownership and participation in such processes,&lt;ref&gt;Chopra &amp; Hohe 2004&lt;/ref&gt; especially after the limited success of liberal peacebuilding/ statebuilding in places as diverse as [[Cambodia]], the [[Balkans]], [[East Timor]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], [[Nepal]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Iraq]]. This research agenda is in the process of establishing a more nuanced agenda for peacebuilding which also connects with the original, qualitatively and normatively oriented work that emerged in the peace studies and conflict research schools of the 1960s (e.g. see the Oslo Peace Research Institute research project on "Liberal Peace and the Ethics of Peacebuilding" and the "Liberal Peace Transitions" project at the University of St Andrews)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burgess|first=Peter|title=Liberal Peace and the Ethics of Peacebuilding|url=http://www.prio.no/Projects/Project/?x=810|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more critical ideas about peacebuilding that have recently developed in many European and non-western academic and policy circles.&lt;ref&gt;Jabri 2007: Richmond &amp; Franks 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have pointed towards the hybrid outcomes that have arisen in practice, indicating both the potential and problems of hybrid forms of peace, with an everyday orientation, and suggestive of the emergence of a post-liberal framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Richmond|first=Oliver|title=A Post-Liberal Peace|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon, Oxon|isbn=978-0-415-66784-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies at the University of Innsbruck/Austria proposed in 2008 a culture-based classification of peace interpretations: energetic, moral, modern, post-modern and trans-rational approaches.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]]: Variationen über die vielen Frieden; Wiesbaden [VS Verlag], 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The trans-rational approach unites existing spiritual interpretations of society and relation&lt;ref&gt;Samrat Schmiem Kumar: Bhakti&amp;nbsp;– the yoga of love. Trans-rational approaches to Peace Studies; [LIT] Münster, Vienna, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; with the mechanistic methods of modern peace. Hence this school prefers the strictly relational and systemic method of elicitive conflict transformation (Lederach)&lt;ref&gt;Lederach, John Paul: Preparing for Peace; Syracuse [Syracuse University Press], 1996&lt;/ref&gt; to the prescriptive approaches of modern conflict resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Koppensteiner, Norbert: Tha Art of the Transpersonal Self. Transformation as Aesthetic and Energetic Practise; [ATROPOS] New York, Dresden, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and controversy==
{{Image frame|width=375|content=[[File:Roger Scruton (2015), Prague.jpg|225x225px]]&amp;nbsp;[[File:David Horowitz by Gage Skidmore.jpg|225x225px]]
|caption=Conservative writers [[Roger Scruton]] (left) and [[David Horowitz]] (right) are among the critics of peace and conflict studies|align=right}}
A serious number of well established criticisms have been aimed at peace and conflict studies, often but not necessarily from outside the realms of university system, including that peace studies:

*do not produce practical prescriptions for managing or resolving global conflicts because "[[ideology]] always trumps [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] and [[pragmatism]]";{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}
*are focused on putting a "respectable face on Western [[self-loathing]]";{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}
*are hypocritical because they "tacitly or openly support [[terrorism]] as a permissible strategy for the 'disempowered' to redress real or perceived grievances against the powerful" (i.e. ideological anti-Western concepts developed by social scientists such as [[Johan Galtung]] which arguably add a sense of unjustified acceptability which is used in support of radicalism)
*have curricula that are (according to human rights activist [[Caroline Cox]] and philosopher [[Roger Scruton]]) "intellectually incoherent, riddled with bias and unworthy of academic status...";&lt;ref name=barbarians&gt;"[http://www.barbarakay.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=20 Barbarians within the gate]" by Barbara Kay, National Post, February 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
*have policies proposed to "eliminate the causes of violence" are uniformly [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] policies, and not necessarily policies which would find broad agreement among social scientists.&lt;ref name="Bawer 2007"&gt;Bawer 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barbara Kay]], a columnist for the ''[[National Post]]'', specifically criticized the views of Norwegian professor [[Johan Galtung]], who is considered to be a leader in modern peace research. Kay wrote that Galtung has written on the "structural fascism" of "rich, Western, Christian" democracies, admires [[Fidel Castro]], opposed resistance to the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Soviet Invasion of Hungary in 1956]], and has described [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and [[Andrei Sakharov]] as "persecuted elite personages." Galtung has also praised [[Mao Zedong]] for "endlessly liberating" China. Galtung has also stated that the United States is a "killer country" that is guilty of "neo-fascist state terrorism" and has reportedly stated that the destruction of Washington, D. C., could be justified by America's foreign policy. He has also compared the United States to Nazi Germany for bombing Kosovo during the [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name=barbarians/&gt;

In the Summer 2007 edition of ''[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]]'', [[Bruce Bawer]] sharply criticized Peace Studies. He noted that many Peace Studies programs in American Universities are run by Marxist or far-left Professors. More broadly, he argued that Peace Studies are dominated by the belief that "America ... is the wellspring of the world’s problems" and that while Professors of Peace Studies argue "that terrorist positions deserve respect at the negotiating table," they "seldom tolerate alternative views" and that "(p)eace studies, as a rule, rejects questioning of its own guiding ideology."&lt;ref name=Bawer&gt;[http://www.city-journal.org/html/17_3_peace_racket.html The Peace Racket] by Bruce Bawer, City Journal, Summer 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding his claim that Peace Studies supports violence in the pursuit of leftist ideology, Bawer cited a quote from ''[http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Peace-and-Conflict-Studies/Charles-P-Webel/e/9780761925071/?itm=4 Peace and Conflict Studies]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Peace-and-Conflict-Studies/Charles-P-Webel/e/9780761925071/?itm=4 Peace and Conflict Studies] by Charles P. Webel and [[David P. Barash]], Textbook (Hardcover&amp;nbsp;– Older Edition), SAGE Publications, March 2002, 592pp, {{ISBN|978-0-7619-2507-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1021115/asp/opinion/story_1382074.asp Take a Break from War] by Kaushik Roy, The Telegraph (Calcutta, India),  November 15, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; a widely used 2002 textbook written by Charles P. Webel and [[David P. Barash]] which praised [[Vladimir Lenin]] because he “maintained that only revolution—not reform—could undo capitalism’s tendency toward imperialism and thence to war."&lt;ref name=Bawer/&gt;

[[David Horowitz]] has argued that Webel and Barash's book implicitly supports violence for socialist causes, noting that the book states "the case of Cuba indicates that violent revolutions can sometimes result in generally improved living conditions for many people." Horowitz also argued that the book "treats the Soviet Union as a sponsor of peace movements, and the United States as the militaristic, imperialist power that peace movements try to keep in check" and that "the authors justify Communist policies and actions while casting those of America and Western democracies in a negative light." Horowitz also claimed that the authors discuss the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] without mentioning its cause (i.e. the placement of the Soviet missiles in Cuba) and blame [[John F. Kennedy]] while praising Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] for "be[ing] willing to back down." Finally, Horowitz criticized the author's use of Marxist writers, such as [[Andre Gunder Frank]] and [[Frances Moore Lappe]], as the sole basis on which to study "poverty and hunger as causes of human conflict."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studentsforacademicfreedom.org/news/581/BSUonemansterroristDHarticle110804.htm "One Man's Terrorist Is Another Man's Freedom Fighter"] by David Horowitz, (website of Students for Academic Freedom), November 08, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kay and Bawer also specifically criticized Professor [http://www.brandeis.edu/departments/sociology/fellman.html Gordon Fellman], the Chairman of [[Brandeis University]]'s Peace, Conflict, and Coexistence Studies Program, whom they claimed has justified Palestinian suicide-bombings against Israelis as "ways of inflicting revenge on an enemy that seems unable or unwilling to respond to rational pleas for discussion and justice."&lt;ref name=Bawer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peaceworkmagazine.org/pwork/0210/021020.htm September 11 and the Field of Peace Studies] by Gordon Fellman, Peacework, October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Katherine Kersten]], who is a senior fellow at the Minneapolis-based conservative think tank [[Center of the American Experiment]], believes that Peace Studies programs are "dominated by people of a certain ideological bent, and [are] thus hard to take seriously." [http://www.stthomas.edu/cathstudies/faculty/kennedy.htm Robert Kennedy], a professor of Catholic studies and management at the [[University of St. Thomas (Minnesota)|University of St. Thomas]], criticized his university's Peace Studies Program in an interview with ''[[Minneapolis Star Tribune]]'' in 2002, stating that the program employs several adjunct professors "whose academic qualifications are not as strong as we would ordinarily look for" and that "The combination of the ideological bite and the maybe less-than-full academic credentials of the faculty would probably raise some questions about how scholarly the program is."&lt;ref&gt;"For Young Activists, Peacemaking 101", by Tom Ford and Bob von Sternberg, ''Minneapolis Star Tribune'', December 17, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responses===

Such views have been strongly opposed by scholars who claim that these criticisms underestimate the development of detailed interdisciplinary, theoretical, methodological, and empirical research into the causes of violence and dynamics of peace that has occurred via academic and policy networks around the world.&lt;ref name="Miall, Ramsbotham, &amp; Woodhouse 2005"/&gt;

In reply to [[Barbara Kay]]'s article, a group of Peace Studies experts in Canada responded that "Kay's...argument that the field of peace studies endorses terrorism is nonsense" and that "(d)edicated peace theorists and researchers are distinguished by their commitment to reduce the use of violence whether committed by enemy nations, friendly governments or warlords of any stripe." They also argued that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...Ms. Kay attempts to portray advocates for peace as naive and idealistic, but the data shows that the large majority of armed conflicts in recent decades have been ended through negotiations, not military solutions. In the contemporary world, violence is less effective than diplomacy in ending armed conflict. Nothing is 100% effective to reduce tyranny and violence, but domestic and foreign strategy needs to be based on evidence, rather than assumptions and misconceptions from a bygone era."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalpost.com/story.html?id=1325511 In defence of peace studies] by Catherine Morris, director, Peacemakers Trust, Victoria; Ben Hoffman, president and CEO, Canadian International Institute of Applied Negotiation, Ottawa; Dean E. Peachey, visiting professor in transitional justice, Global College, University of Winnipeg, National Post, February 25, 2009. ([http://peacemakers.ca.etherwork.net/bulletins/2009/02/in-defence-of-peace-studies-letter-to-the-national-post/ Full letter is available here])&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most academics in the area argue that the accusations that peace studies approaches are not objective, and derived from mainly leftist or inexpert sources, are not practical, support violence rather than reject it, or have not led to policy developments, are clearly incorrect. They note that the development of UN and major donor policies (including the EU, US, and UK, as well as many others including those of Japan, Canada, Norway, etc.) towards and in conflict and post-conflict countries have been heavily influenced by such debates. A range of key policy documents and responses have been developed by these governments in the last decade and more, and in UN (or related) documentation such as "Agenda for Peace", "Agenda for Development", "Agenda for Democratization", the [[Millennium Development Goals]], [[Responsibility to Protect]], and the "High Level Panel Report".&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Secretary- General’s High Level Panel on Threats, Challenges, and Change, United Nations, 2004: Boutros Boutros Ghali, An Agenda For Peace: preventative diplomacy, peacemaking and peacekeeping, New York: United Nations, 1992; An Agenda for Development: Report of the Secretary-General, A/48/935, 6 May 1994; “Supplement to An Agenda for Peace” A/50/60, S.1995/1, 3 January 1995; An Agenda for Democratization, A/50/332 AND A/51/512, 17 December 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; They have also been significant for the work of the World Bank, International Development Agencies, and a wide range of Non Governmental Organisations.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. for the World Bank, see, "Breaking the Conflict Trap: Civil War and Development Policy" [http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/EXTPRRS/EXTBCTCWDP0,,menuPK:477815~pagePK:64168092~piPK:64168088~theSitePK:477803,00.html]: For DFID see [http://www.dfid.gov.uk/aboutdfid/performance/files/ev646s.pdf]; e.g. see also [[International Crisis Group]]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been influential in the work of, among others, the UN, UNDP, [[UN Peacebuilding Commission]], [[UNHCR]], [[World Bank]], [[European Union|EU]], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], for national donors including USAID, DFID, CIDA, NORAD, DANIDA, Japan Aid, GTZ, and international NGOs such as [[International Alert]] or [[International Crisis Group]], as well as many local NGOs. Major databases have been generated by the work of scholars in these areas.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Correlates of War at Harvard University [http://dvn.iq.harvard.edu/dvn/dv/cow]: PRIO/ Uppsala University Data on Armed Conflict [http://www.prio.no/CSCW/Datasets/Armed-Conflict/].&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, peace and conflict studies debates have generally confirmed, not undermined, a broad consensus (western and beyond) on the importance of [[human security]], human rights, development, democracy, and a rule of law (though there is a vibrant debate ongoing about the contextual variations and applications of these frameworks).&lt;ref&gt;Michael Doyle and Nicolas Sambanis, Making War and Building Peace, (Princeton University Press, 2006); Charles T. Call and Elizabeth M. Cousens, “Ending Wars and Building Peace: International Responses to War-Torn Societies,” International Studies Perspectives, 9 (2008): Stephen D. Krasner, “Sharing Sovereignty. New Institutions for Collapsed and Failing States,” International Security, 29, 2 (2004); Roland Paris, At War’s End, (Cambridge University Press, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the research field is characterized by a number of challenges including the tension between "the objective of doing critical research and being of practical relevance".&lt;ref&gt;

A '''postmaster''' is the head of an individual [[post office]]. When a postmaster is responsible for an entire mail distribution organization (usually sponsored by a national government), the title of [[Postmaster General]] is commonly used. 
Responsibilities of a postmaster typically include management of a centralized mail distribution facility, establishment of [[letter carrier]] routes, supervision of letter carriers and clerks, and enforcement of the organization's rules and procedures.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

In [[Canada]], many early places are named after the first postmaster.

==History==
In the days of horse-drawn [[carriage]]s, a postmaster was an individual from whom horses and/or riders (known as [[postilion]]s or "post-boys") could be hired. The postmaster would reside in a "post house".&lt;ref&gt;

Many postmasters are members of a management organization that consults with the [[United States Postal Service]] (USPS) for compensation and policy. On November 1, 2016, the two organizations, the [[National Association of Postmasters of the United States]] (NAPUS) and the [[National League of Postmasters]], merged to form the [[United Postmasters and Managers of America]] (UPMA).

Level of pay is based on deliveries and revenue of the post office. Levels are from EAS (Executive and Administrative Service) 18 through 26. Smaller remotely managed post offices no longer have postmasters and report to a nearby larger office. Larger metropolitan post offices are PCES (Postal Career Executive Service).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32219">The '''Public Administration of Spain''' is the governmental apparatus that manages the [[Spain|Spanish]] public interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martín Rebollo|first1=Luis|title=Leyes Administrativas|isbn=978-84-9135-888-6|page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Constitution of 1978]] declares in article 103.1 that the Public Administration serves objectively the general interests and acts in accordance with the principles of [[efficiency]], [[hierarchy]], [[decentralization]], deconcentration and coordination, with full submission to the [[Law of Spain|Law]].

The Law 40/2015, of October 2, about the Juridical Regime of the Public Sector, establish that are Public Administration the ''[[General State Administration]], the [[Administrations of the Autonomous Communities]], the Entities that integrate the Local Administration, as well as the public organisms and the entities of public law''.

The structure of the Public Administration of Spain is composed of many Administrations, which can be divided into three groups: Territorial administrations (this are the administrations that needs territory to exist like the [[General State Administration]]), the Instrumental or Institutional Administrations (the key to exist is the personnel) and the Corporative Administrations (group of people of the same guild that sometimes they do activities of a public nature)

The Public administrations, in their task of satisfying the [[Common good|general interest]], hold a series of exorbitant powers with respect to legal persons of a private nature. As a counterweight to such exorbitant powers, Administrations are subject to a set of limits and guarantees of the [[rule of law]] (submission to the law, [[judicial review]], property guarantees, etc.).

==Regulation==
===Basic regulation===
The main axis of the basic regulation of the Public Administration is the Law 39/2015, of October 1, about the Common Administrative Process of the Public Administrations and Law 40/2015, of October 2, about the Juridical Regime of the Public Sector.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2015-10566&amp;p=20151002&amp;tn=2 Ley 40/2015, de 1 de octubre, de Régimen Jurídico del Sector Público.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2015-10565 Ley 39/2015, de 1 de octubre, del Procedimiento Administrativo Común de las Administraciones Públicas.]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other laws that affect all the Public Administrations are Law 33/2003, about the Patrimony of the Public Administrations, Law 38/2003, about Public Subsidies, the [[Royal Legislative Decree (Spain)|Royal Legislative Decree]] 5/2015, about the Basic Statute of the Public Employee and [[Royal Legislative Decree (Spain)|Royal Legislative Decree]] 3/2011, about Public Sector Contracts.

===Development regulation===
Apart from the bases, there are other laws that develop and implement the previous ones like Law 6/1997, about Organization and Functioning of the General State Administration and Law 50/1997, of November 27, about the Government.

In the autonomous field, the Administrations of the [[Autonomous Communities]] are subject to their respective autonomous laws, in development of the basic state regulation mentioned above. It should be noted that local administrations (such as a [[town hall]]) do not have [[legislative power]] but [[regulatory authority]].

==Organization==
The Spanish Public Administrations has a decentralized character as the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Constitution]] says. There are not a hierarchy criterion between administrations but a competencial criterion. This means that every administations has its competencies and another administration can not influence them because it is not competent. There are around 10,000 public administrations in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theeconomyjournal.com/texto-diario/mostrar/591729/espana-casi-10000-administraciones-publicas En España, casi 10.000 Administraciones públicas]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Territorial administrations===
Administrations, depending on the territory in which they are competent, are classified into three levels. The first level is the [[General State Administration]] which competencies spread throughout the [[Spain|country]]. The second level is made up of the different [[Autonomous Communities Administration|Autonomous Administrations]]. Its competences cover the territory of the corresponding [[Autonomous Community]]. Finally, the third level are the Local Administrations develop their powers over the corresponding municipal or provincial term, depending on whether it is a [[Municipality |Municipality]] or a [[Province |Province]].

It must be understood that the three levels differ because they are legally different, insofar as each one has its own [[legal personality]]. It is what is known as public entity, in front of the internal structure of the same, the so-called ''organs'', considered as each of the functional units of the public entity.

===Instrumental or Institutional administrations===
Together with the three territorial administrative levels, there is an extremely heterogeneous group of Administrations with a purely instrumental or institutional character (Institutional Administration), dependent on a parent administration. The plurality of territorial administrations allows them to be created with their own administrative [[legal personality]], different from the parent administration, for the exercise of certain competences. Unlike the parent or creative administration, which has a political character, the instrumental or institutional administration has a strong [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] character.

==Patrimony==
The patrimony of the Administration has its essential regulation in the article 132 of the Constitution, as well as in the Law 33/2003, of November 3, of the Patrimony of the Public Administrations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-2003-20254 Ley 33/2003, de 3 de noviembre, del Patrimonio de las Administraciones Públicas.]&lt;/ref&gt; The assets and rights of said Administrations may be classified, according to article 4 of Law 33/2003, in public domain goods and private domain goods.

The money, securities, credits and other financial resources of its finances are not considered patrimony of the Administration nor, in the case of public business entities and similar entities dependent on the autonomous communities or local corporations, the resources constituting their treasury.

===Public domain goods===
Public domain assets are those that are publicly owned but are used for general use or [[public service]]. Public property is also considered to be the dependencies and offices of State bodies, as well as the maritime-terrestrial zone, the [[Beaches of Spain|beaches]], the [[territorial sea]] and the natural resources of the [[Exclusive economic zone|economic zone]] and the [[continental shelf]].

===Private domain goods===
Patrimonial assets or private domain are all those assets owned by the state that do not fall within the category of public domain assets. In this way, ''[[leasing|leasing rights]], securities representing shares and shares in the capital of commercial companies or of bonds issued by them, as well as futures and options contracts whose underlying assets consist of shares or participations in commercial entities, [[Incorporeal property|incorporeal property rights]], and rights of any nature arising from the ownership of the assets and [[economic rights]]''.

===Special Properties===
====Communal goods====
The communal goods are assigned to a general use and use by the neighbors of a certain [[municipality]]. The [[Town Hall]] and neighbors are co-owners of the property, having the right to use and enjoy direct and simultaneous neighborhood, whenever possible. If this is not the case, [[local ordinances]] and custom will determine the regime of use and use of [[communal property]].

====Neighborhood forests in common hand====
The ''neighborhood forests in common hand'' are a special category of property, whose ownership and use corresponds to those who are at any moment neighbors of a certain place (without the intervention of the [[Town Hall]]). The management will also be carried out by these through [[Neighborhood association|neighborhood assemblies]].

====National Heritage====
The [[Patrimonio Nacional|National Heritage]] is constituted by goods and rights reserved for the use and enjoyment of the members of the [[Spanish royal family|Royal House]]. They have a marked public domain, and an intense protection that makes them more inalienable than the common public domain goods.

There is no assumption that the assets and rights of the National Heritage can be removed from their public domain character to be converted into patrimonial assets (private law) and subsequently alienated.

==Public employment==
[[Public employee|Public employment]] comprises all the cases in which the Administration makes use of natural persons so that, in return for [[remuneration]], they work for the account of the body or entity to which they are attached. The basic regulations are found in Law 5/2005, of April 12, about the Basic Statute of the Public Employee. Four general classes of public employees are regulated: career officials, interim officials, labor staff and eventual staff.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2015-11719 Real Decreto Legislativo 5/2015, de 30 de octubre, por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley del Estatuto Básico del Empleado Público.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career officials===
The backbone of public employment rests on career [[official]]s, people linked to the Administration by a statutory relationship. Their access to the public function is carried out by opposition or competition (such as via exams and through open competition for vacancies), and their separation is limited to certain cases contemplated in the legislation.

===Interim officials===
The Interim officials or Temporary officials enjoy, as well as career officials, a statutory relationship with the Administration. His access and separation from the [[public service]] also follow the same guidelines, differing from the career official in the provisional character, as opposed to the alleged stability of the former.

===Labor staff===
The massive incorporation of labor staff in the service of the Public Administration is a relatively recent phenomenon. Its relationship with the Administration is not statutory, like the one of the civil servants, but by [[Work contract|contract]]. Its legal regime is governed by the rules of [[administrative law]], something that does not preclude the application of the common [[labor law]] regime. In its contracting and dismissal, the principles of [[Equality (law)|equality]], [[publicity]], merit and [[Capacity (law)|capacity]] must continue to be respected.

The Administration can not freely contract labor staff, but must adjust to the jobs that the law allows.
===Eventual staff===
Eventual staff are [[public employees]] who have been appointed on a discretionary basis to perform a series of special functions or advice in the administrative apparatus of the State. Their general character is of non-permanent workers and they can be fired freely by the authority of which they depend or that made his appointment. In any case, they cease when the authority they consult is ceased.

==Administrative Procedure==
The Public Administration governs its action on the basis of a series of rules that [[Coercivity|coercively]] impose a procedure, making administrative acts subject to a ritual form. Both the decisions taken and the way in which they are carried out must be carried out through formal procedures, a concept inherited from [[Francia|French]] legal doctrine.

Among the functions of the [[administrative procedure]], it is worth mentioning its role as a source of administrative predictability. In this way, it is considered desirable that the performance of the Administration is moderately predictable, for the sake of [[legal certainty]]. On the other hand, imposing a series of formal guidelines reduces the spaces in which the professional officials must act in an excessively creative way (something typical of positions of political trust), with the consequent reduction of [[arbitrariness]] in the management of [[Public interest|Public affairs]]. By regulating the procedure, it will be possible to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of administrative action without affecting labor pressures, which are possible in the private organization, but completely unthinkable in a contemporary Public Administration that operates on a [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] and regulated basis, safe from the changes that come with the political future.

==Public Procurement Regime==
The [[public administration]] usually uses the contracting mechanism with individuals to carry out an immense variety of tasks. However, the contracting regime differs from that provided for contracting between individuals, traditionally governed by [[Civil law (Civil law)|civil law]]. When the administration acts as a contractor, a specific contracting regime must be used, in which [[administrative law]] plays a fundamental and indispensable role.

[[Royal Legislative Decree (Spain)|Royal Legislative Decree]] 3/2011,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-2011-17887 Real Decreto Legislativo 3/2011, de 14 de noviembre, por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley de Contratos del Sector Público.]&lt;/ref&gt; about Contracts of the public sector is responsible for regulating public procurement, guaranteeing the principles of free access to tender, publicity and transparency of the procedure, equality of treatment between candidates and efficiency in public expenditure. To ensure the latter, a prior definition of the need to satisfy, free competition between tenderers, and the choice of the most economically advantageous tender are required.

==Patrimonial liability regime==
The Public Administration of Spain responds patrimonially of certain type of damages that produce incidentally as a consequence of the administrative action. The principle of patrimonial guarantee of the individual against the Administration is consecrated by the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Spanish Constitution]], specifically in article 106.

===Characteristics===
The administrative responsibility is complete, so that it covers all the damages produced by any public power, not only the Administration proper. It is also a direct responsibility, so that the injured party will not have to go against the official who has performed the harmful action, but against the Administration itself, directly, and in no case subsidiary. The Administration, in turn, may punish the official in case of [[dolus]], [[negligence]] or [[Guilt (law)|guilt]].

===Requirements===
====Redeemable Injury====
One of the most basic presupposition for which there is responsibility on the part of the Administration is the existence of a qualified damage to the [[property]] or [[rights]] of a [[Natural person|natural]] or [[legal person]]. Point out that not only refers to pecuniary goods, but also of another nature, such as moral damages, which in the case will also involve a [[pecuniary|pecuniary]] compensation.

Among the qualities that administrative damage must meet in order to comply with this requirement, it is necessary to emphasize, first of all, the illegality of the action of the Administration. Unlike the regime of responsibility regulated in the [[Civil Code]], where the illegality occurs when there is [[fraud]] or [[Guilt (law)|guilt]], in the system of objective responsibility of the Administration, the criterion of illegality focuses on the existence or nonexistence of a duty to support the damage that laws can attribute to subjects. If the victim of administrative damage had no duty to bear it, the injury will be unlawful. Otherwise, the responsibility of the Administration will not arise, and the private individual will be responsible for the damage (it will be the case of [[taxes]], in which the subject suffers property damage, but as a consequence of a law that empowers the Public authority to effect such an injury, and therefore exempts it from liability.)

The experts also speak of the need for the damage to be effective, referring to current and actual damages, and ruling out compensation for future or merely possible damages. Similarly, there is no liability when the damage consists in the mere frustration of expectations, provided that such expectations do not have a highly tangible probability of becoming an increase in [[property]] or [[rights]].

On the other hand, the damage must be economically evaluable. However, this does not mean that only damage to property or property rights is compensated, because in a conventional way, personal and moral damage (pretium doloris) can also be assessed.

The damage must be individualized, it may be a single person or a small group, but never a group of such magnitude that can not be concretized who receive the damage.

====Imputation of injury====
The damage must have been produced by an official or employee of the Administration, or by one of the organs of political trust. In addition, it must occur as a result of acting within the public functions performed by such persons. However, damages caused by contractors and concessionaires of the Administration are excluded, unless the injury was caused by a clause imposed by the latter, so that the individual was obliged to cause the damage in question. Likewise, exceptions are included in which a professional with public functions responds personally, as may be the case of the [[notary]].

On the other hand, analyzing the formal characteristics of the damage, it is necessary to emphasize that four types of actions (and omissions) can be found. Thus, damage can come from the regulatory activity of the Administration, some of its administrative acts, a purely material administrative action or the inactivity of the Administration.

====Causal link====
The cause-effect relationship seems to be an obvious and simple requirement in the framework of the liability of the Public Administration for damages in its action. However, the causes of harm are often not unique, nor are they clearly related. Throughout history, three different theories have been applied, focused essentially on resolving cases in which there is a concurrence of causes, which by the way, are the most common assumptions.

At first, the theory of exclusive causality predominated, which only held the Administration responsible when its performance was the sole and exclusive cause of the injury. Obviously, the assumptions in which the Administration is the exclusive cause of harm are very small, and the theory was extremely advantageous for the public body, since it rarely had to compensate.

In later moments the theory of equivalence of the conditions would be applied, which affirmed that all the factors that caused the injury have equal importance, taking into account that the absence of any of them would have meant the absence of such an [[injury]]. It concluded that the total compensation could be demanded from any of the causal sources that caused the damage, having to repeat the defendant against the other causes. With this, a kind of tacit [[solidarity]] was established in which the interest of the damaged subject prevailed, in spite of the [[arbitrariness]] of the system.

Finally, the theory of adequate causality, in which the corresponding court selects from among the causes that is suitable to provoke the injury, and decisive for it to occur. The reparation of damage is still given absolute priority, although on this occasion, the person causing the damage, who pays the total compensation and repeats it against the other offenders, is not arbitrarily selected, but based on the degree to which acting involved in the production of the lesion.

Among the cases in which there is a concurrence of causes, three types may be mentioned. First, when the victim has contributed in causing the damage, the compensation of the Administration was reduced in equal proportion to the degree of intervention of the injured subject. If there is intentionality or gross [[negligence]] in the action of the victim, the Administration does not have to compensate. In addition, full compensation is allowed for cases where the administrative action was notoriously disproportionate (a [[protest]] in which the [[riot police]] carried fire with the lethal ammunition).

The second case of causes is that in which the action of a third party, alien to the victim and the Administration, assists in causing the damage. Normally, in these cases, the Administration is obliged to fully indemnify the injured party, especially when the third party can not be identified.

The third and last possibility is that in which several Public Administrations concur in the causation of the damage. When the damage has occurred in the context of a joint action between Administrations, the regime that may provide for the instrument regulating such joint action will be taken first and, in the absence thereof, the principle of solidarity will govern, so that the Administration against which the victim wishes to act will compensate. In the event that it is not a joint action, liability shall be fixed for each Administration independently, and where such determination is not possible, joint and several liability shall govern.

==Administrative review==
The Public Administration has a series of mechanisms by which it tries to self-correct its own action. The administrative review is a method to rectify those acts that suffer from some vice of illegality, being also an indispensable prerequisite for the individual who wishes to access the contentious-administrative (In [[Spain]], it is the [[jurisdictional]] level that deals with the conflicts of the Administration with the [[citizens]]), which this time, it is a reviewer of judicial nature.

Thus, there are three basic categories by which the Administration can perform the review of its own acts. First, the [[ex officio]] review, initiated (with exceptions) by the Administration itself in order to review its actions.

Next would be the administrative [[appeal]], a system of contentious character whose initiation is made at the request of the interested parties, and which intends to review an administrative act. The administrative appeal is a prerequisite for access to contentious-administrative jurisdiction.

Finally, there is the previous complaint, a very similar system to the administrative appeal, which also has an initiation at the request of the interested party, but whose object is an underlying conflict between the individual and the Administration (not necessarily an administrative act). 

===Ex officio review===
As previously stated, the [[ex officio |ex officio]] review is a quasi-exclusive mechanism of Spanish [[Administrative Law]] that allows the Public Administration to review its acts [[motu proprio]], without the need for an individual to urge such a review.

The ex officio review will proceed in four different assumptions. First, the existence of an act or regulation that can be considered [[null and void]] by law; Then, the review of an annulable declarative act of rights; Also the revocation of an act of taxation; And finally the correction of material and arithmetical errors.

===Administrative appeal===
The administrative appeal is that administrative act exercised preferably at the request of a party (the administrator) to obtain the modification, revocation or invalidation of an administrative resolution, generally when it causes a tort to the administered.

===Economic-Administrative Courts===
The Economic-Administrative Courts are a special courts unique from Spain that resolve the economic-administrative claims that has the objective of challenging the tax acts before the Administration itself.

==Contentious-administrative review==
If, in the administrative review, the Administration verified the legality of its own acts, the contentious-administrative procedure results in a verification of the legality of the administrative act by independent courts belonging to the [[Judiciary of Spain|judicial branch]].

{{quote|"The Contentious-Administrative Jurisdiction is a key piece of our Rule of Law. Since it was established on our country by the Laws of April 2 and July 6, 1845, and through many vicissitudes, has given a good sample of its virtues since the Act of 27 December 1956, which endowed it with the characteristics that it has today and of the attributions essential to assume its mission to control the legality of administrative activity, guaranteeing the rights and legitimate interests of The citizens against the excess of the Administration."|author=Explanatory Memorandum of the Law of Contentious Administrative Jurisdiction of 1998.}}

Not only administrative acts are challenging, but also the general provisions issued by the Administration, the absence of due administrative action and even ways of doing things. Contentious-administrative control is an important component of the [[rule of law]], since it guarantees the supremacy of the legal norms on the regulatory norms and the action (or omission) of the Public Administration.

This principle, according to its importance, is enshrined in Article 106.1 of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Spanish Constitution]], which states that the courts control the regulatory power and the legality of administrative action, as well as submitting it to the purposes that justify it.

===Object===
When referring to the subject of the contentious-administrative appeal, reference is made to that which can be challenged before the Contentious Administrative-Jurisdiction.

In the first place, any general provision issued by the Administration by virtue of its regulatory power is subject to contentious review. Likewise, it is possible to resort to the contentious-administrative appeal to review the mere material actions of the Administration. Finally, it can be claimed against the only passivity or administrative omission in situations that legally require its activity.

===Subject===
The rules on the standing to file a contentious-administrative appeal are set out in articles 19 and 20 of Law 29/1998, of July 13, regulating the Contentious-Administrative Jurisdiction.

According to article 19, they are entitled to appeal:
* The [[Natural person|natural]] and [[legal persons]] that hold a right of legitimate interest.
* The groups of affected, unions without personality and independent or autonomous patrimonies that have a right or legitimate interest.
* Territorial administrations (general, autonomous and local).
* The instrumental administrations that have a legitimate right or interest.
* The [[Spanish Attorney General|Attorney General's Office]] for cases legally envisaged.
* Any [[citizen]], in those cases in which the Law allows the popular action.

It also contemplates those situations in which the affected are a plurality of people indeterminate or difficult to determine, in which case the standing to sue in defense of these diffuse interests will be exclusively the public bodies with jurisdiction in the matter, Unions and state-level associations whose primary purpose is [[Gender equality|equality between women and men]].

The appeal of an administrative body against the Administration of which it forms part is not allowed. Nor will it be possible for a member of a collegiate body to appeal against its own administration. It will not be acceptable for an Entity governed by public law to challenge the decision of the Administration on which it depends or with which it is bound.

===Contentious-administrative procedure===
The contentious-administrative procedure is the result of a set of formal rules of a [[Procedural law|procedural]] nature that form the channel to be followed to settle the [[lawsuit]], and to apply the substantive rules, which are the ones that ultimately must determine the merits of the matter.

====Ordinary procedure====
It is initiated by a brief reduced to citing the provision, act, inactivity or action constituting a [[de facto]] route that is contested and to request that the appeal be filed.

Once the procedure has been initiated, the court will require the Administration to forward the administrative file and to place the interested parties thereon by means of a notification that it will follow the rules established for the common administrative procedure. The administrative file will be placed in the hands of the [[appellant]] so that within 20 days, he files a writ of complaint, this time yes, with all the arguments and legal reasoning that he has deduced from the file. If there is no referral of the file, the Law raises multiple measures to compel the Administration, ranging from the impossibility of answering without accompanying file until the personal fine to the official or authority responsible for sending.

Once the claim has been filed by the appellant, it will be transferred to the defendants, who will also have a period of 20 days to respond. Both the demand and the answer must respect a structure with the proper separation of the facts, the grounds of Law and the claims that are deduced.

When there is disagreement about the facts and these have significance for the resolution of the lawsuit, the process will be tested. The evidence can be given at the request of a party or ex officio by the court. The general provisions issued in the field of evidence for civil proceedings are followed, although the deadline for proposing it will be fifteen days, and thirty days for it to be practiced.

At the end of the trial period, or not having occurred, the parties may request that a hearing be held, that conclusions be presented or that the suit be declared conclusive, without further formalities, for judgment.

Once the process of hearing or conclusions is concluded, and unless the court decides to practice additional evidence, the suit shall be declared final for judgment.

===Appeals===
====Ordinary appeal====
It is a appeal that is filed in order for a resolution to be revoked, by court or authority higher than the one that dictated it.
====Cassation appeal====
Appeal filed before the Supreme Court against final judgments, in which laws or legal doctrine are alleged to have been violated, or any essential procedural guarantee breached.
====Reviewal appeal====
It is the most extraordinary resource that knows the order of the contentious-administrative. It is filed when a judgment has already been issued and is requested to be reviewed by the appearance of new cases.

The law establishes 4 assumptions that allow to appeal this resource:
* If, after pronouncement of the judgment, decisive documents are recovered, not contributed by [[force majeure]] or by the party in whose favor it was given.
* If it had fallen on the basis of documents which, at the time of its being pronounced, were unaware of one of the parties having been recognized and declared to be false or whose falsity was recognized or later declared.
* If it has been issued by witness evidence, the witnesses have been convicted of [[false testimony]] given in the statements that served as the basis of the sentence.
* Information and communications technologyIf a judgment has been given by virtue of [[bribery]], [[Deception|prevarication]], [[violence]] or other fraudulent machinations.

The '''Samogitian Party''' ({{lang-lt|Žemaičių partija}}, {{lang-sgs|Žemaitiu partėjė}} or {{lang-sgs|Žemaitiu šalėnė}}&lt;ref&gt;The party used the word "šalėnė" as an invented translation for the word "party". recently, however, the party refers itself to "Žemaitiu partėjė" in Samogitian&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[Political parties of minorities|ethnic-regionalist autonomist party]] of the [[Lithuania]]'s [[Samogitians|Samogitian minority]] founded in April 2008.

==Creation==
In 2008, the Ministry of Justice refused to register the party claiming that there were not enough participants at its inaugural meeting, but also that the programme failed to explicitly recognize the State of Lithuania's territorial integrity and indivisibility and the fact that the Lithuanian language is the national language. The Ministry finally registered the party in February 2009, a recognition that was indispensable for taking part to any election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://klaipeda.diena.lt/naujienos/miestas/zemaiciu-partija-bus-200205|title=Žemaičių partija bus|date=February 2, 2009|publisher=Klaipėda|language=Lithuanian|accessdate=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
The Samogitian Party wants [[Samogitia]] to become an area where the [[Samogitian dialect|Samogitian language]] would have official status and where Samogitians would have the right to declare their ethnic nationality.&lt;ref name="kw"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kresy.pl/serwis-polski,goniec-kresowy?zobacz/zmudzki-niedzwiedz-sie-budzi|title=Żmudzki niedźwiedź się budzi (The Samogitian bear wakes up )|date=January 2009|publisher=Kurier Wileński (Vilnius Courier)|language=Polish|accessdate=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership and party structure==
The party has 1,100 members, according to party sources.&lt;ref name="kw"/&gt; Several local branches of the party have been established, including one in [[London]], created in May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zemaiciupartija.eu/zemaiciu-partijos-skyrius-isteigtas-ir-londone/|title=Žemaičių partijos skyrius įsteigtas ir Londone|date=May 25, 2009|publisher=Žemaičių partija|language=Lithuanian|accessdate=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral results==
The Samogitian Party took part at the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Lithuania)|2009 European Parliament election]] and received 6,961 votes (1.23% of the total). It got more than 4% of the votes (the [[electoral threshold]] for the [[Elections in Lithuania|municipal elections]]) in the four districts of the [[Telšiai County]], in the [[Mažeikiai district municipality]] (544 votes, 6,27%), in the [[Rietavas municipality]] (95 votes, 5,04%), in the [[Plungė district municipality]] (356 votes, 5,76%) and in the [[Telšiai district municipality]] (501 votes, 5,84%), and in three districts (out of seven) of the [[Klaipėda County]], i.e. the [[Kretinga district municipality]] (373 votes, 5,67%), in the [[Skuodas district municipality]] (253 votes, 6,84%) and the [[Klaipėda district municipality]] (341 votes, 4,49%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vrk.lt/2009_ep_rinkimai/output_en/rezultatai_daugiamand_apygardose/rezultatai_daugiamand_apygardose1turas.html|title=Elections to the European Parliament, 7 June 2009 - Voting results in Lithuania|date=2009-06-14|publisher= Lithuanian Central Electoral Commission|accessdate=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the party chairman Egidijus Skarbalius, participated as a candidate from [[The Way of Courage]] party. 

==Political context==
The respondents in the various censuses do not have the option to choose for the [[Samogitians|Samogitian ethnicity]], a situation similar to the Polish [[Kashubians]] and [[Silesians]]. This had already been contested before courts by the ''Žemaitē bova, īr ė būs'' ("Samogitians were, are and will be") Association, also named'' Žemaitiu soeiga'', which considers that it is a violation of the Constitution, more particularly of the provision that everyone has the right to decide on his nationality. According to Egidijus Skarbalius, the founder of the Samogitian Party, Samogitians could be as many as one million, thus representing a third of Lithuania's total population.&lt;ref name="kw"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/Wiadomosci/1,80708,5141627.html|title=Żmudzini chcą być narodem|last=PAP|date=April 21, 2008|publisher=Gazeta Wyborcza|language=Polish|accessdate=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/Wiadomosci/1,80708,4358628.html|title=Żmudzini chcą być uznani za naród|last=IAR|date=August 2, 2007|publisher=Gazeta Wyborcza|language=Polish|accessdate=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 2008, the Council of [[Skuodas district municipality]] had decided to act by a ''fait accompli'', and decided that all its meetings will be held in Samogitian language. Lithuanian councilmen will enjoy the use of interpreters as for them this language is completely incomprehensible.&lt;ref name="kw"/&gt;

'''SaveCalifornia.com''' is a United States [[nonprofit organization]] founded in 1999 by Randy Thomasson as part of Campaign for Children and Families (CCF).&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://savecalifornia.com/about.html|publisher=SaveCalifornia|accessdate=September 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is active in influencing public policy on various social issues, and has opposed California's [[FAIR Education Act]].&lt;ref name=Khadaroo /&gt; They are [[List of organizations designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center as hate groups|listed]] as an [[LGBT rights in California|anti-gay]] [[hate group]] by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], in part for depicting LGBT people as predatory.&lt;ref name=SPLCActive /&gt;

==History and issues==
Save California.com is a project of Campaign for Children and Families, a California-based advocacy non-profit organization&lt;ref name=Mcgreevy /&gt; formed in 1999 by Randy Thomasson. The organization has a stated goal of "defending and representing the values of parents, grandparents and concerned citizens who want what's best for this generation and future generations."&lt;ref name=About /&gt; Thomasson has been involved in influencing social and fiscal policies in government since 1994, through various media outlets.&lt;ref name=Bio&gt;{{cite web|title=Randy Thomasson Bio|url=http://savecalifornia.com/randy-thomasson-bio.htmlpublisher=SaveCalifornia|accessdate=September 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also founded [[Campaign for California Families]],&lt;ref name=SanRamonVT010211&gt;{{cite news|title=Lobbyist To Address Republican Group|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:CCRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=10649FA9CA1E9732&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0FB3382EE6AD1E46|accessdate=September 27, 2012|newspaper=San Ramon Valley Times|date=February 11, 2001|location=San Ramon Valley, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; a non-profit organization which sought to defend [[Proposition 22]] and [[Proposition 8]] against constitutional challenges in the courts.&lt;ref name=Egelko041016&gt;{{cite news|title=Gay-nuptials foes win right to defend state law|date=October 16, 2004|author=Bob Egelko|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2004-10-16/bay-area/17447786_1_same-sex-marriage-marriage-law-state-marriage|accessdate=September 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Egelko090819&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/08/19/BA7T19AQ10.DTL&amp;tsp=1|title=Judge sets January trial for Prop. 8 lawsuit|publisher=''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''|author=Bob Egelko|date=August 19, 2009|accessdate=September 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lobbying activities===
The organization supported California's [[Proposition 8]]&lt;ref name=Ferriss&gt;{{cite news|last=Ferriss|first=Susan|title=Same-sex marriage ban is targeted|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:SCBB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=12AF65A2AADB67B0&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0FB3382EE6AD1E46|accessdate=September 27, 2012|newspaper=Sacramento Bee|date=September 25, 2009|author2=Van Oot, Torey|location=Sacrament, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Castro&gt;{{cite news|last=Castro|first=Tony|title=Proposition 8 Deemed Unconstitutional|accessdate=September 27, 2012|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:LANB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=1316D80B823BEE10&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggdocs&amp;req_dat=0FB3382EE6AD1E46|newspaper=Daily News of Los Angeles|date=August 5, 2010|location=Los Angeles, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opposed a state bill which would allow two people, including same-sex couples, who jointly owned a home to avoid having their property tax reassessed and raised when one of them dies.&lt;ref name=Roja&gt;{{cite news|last=Roja|first=Aurelio|title=Proposition 8 Aftermath / Issue is before high court - Bills keep up gay rights push|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:SCBB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=125D584E276E6410&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0FB3382EE6AD1E46|accessdate=September 27, 2012|newspaper=Sacramento Bee|date=January 19, 2009|location=Sacrament, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Chief U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker's ruling overturning California's same-sex marriage ban in 2010, sending the landmark case to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]], SaveCalifornia.com reacted with a statement:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge overturns Calif. gay marriage ban|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38560562/ns/us_news-life/t/judge-overturns-calif-gay-marriage-ban/|accessdate=September 27, 2012|date=August 5, 2010|agency=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|Natural marriage, voter rights, the Constitution, and our republic called the United States of America have all been dealt a terrible blow. Judge Walker has ignored the written words of the Constitution, which he swore to support and defend and be impartially faithful to, and has instead imposed his own homosexual agenda upon the voters, the parents, and the children of California. This is a blatantly unconstitutional ruling because marriage isn't in the U.S. Constitution. The Constitution guarantees that state policies be by the people, not by the judges, and also supports states' rights, thus making marriage a state jurisdiction.}}

SaveCalifornia.com also lobbied against California's [[FAIR Education Act]], using social media to help carry its message to the public.&lt;ref name=Mcgreevy&gt;{{cite news|last=Mcgreevy|first=Patrick|title=California to require teaching of gay contributions|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:WMCB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=1388268E66A9DF78&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0FB3382EE6AD1E46|accessdate=September 27, 2012|newspaper=The Chronicle|date=July 15, 2011|location=Willimantic, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Thomasson described the bill as "Sexual brainwashing" and called for "parents to remove their children from the government school system, and get them into the safe havens of church schooling and home schooling." After the California Assembly passed the bill by a 49-to-25 vote,&lt;ref name=Khadaroo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khadaroo|first=Stacy Teicher|title=Could California Lead Nation in Teaching of Gay History in Schools?|journal=The Christian Science Monitor|date=July 7, 2011|accessdate=September 26, 2012|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Education/2011/0707/Could-California-lead-nation-in-teaching-of-gay-history-in-schools}}&lt;/ref&gt; SaveCalifornia.com urged governor [[Jerry Brown]] to veto the bill as "unneeded, unwanted and un-affordable".&lt;ref name=Grossman&gt;{{cite news|last=Cathy Lynn|first=Grossman|title=California gay 'role model' bill sparks battle|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/Religion/post/2011/07/gay-rights-california-jerry-brown-education/1|accessdate=September 27, 2012|newspaper=USA Today|date=July 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, after President [[Barack Obama|Obama]] posthumously awarded the [[Medal of Freedom]] to gay rights activist [[Harvey Milk]], SaveCalifornia.com held a press conference in which Thomasson argued that Milk was unfit for the nation's highest civilian honor. Thomasson told MSNBC and CBS  that the president had made "a mistake" by honoring Milk.&lt;ref name=Sharp&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sharp|first=Sonja|title=Harvey Milk's Medal of Freedom Sparks Protest—In San Francisco|journal=Mother Jones|date=August 12, 2009|url=https://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2009/08/save-californias-harvey-milk-stunt|accessdate=September 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also led opposition against [[Harvey Milk Day]], referring to Milk as a "sexual predator",&lt;ref name=Richardson&gt;{{cite news|last=Richardson|first=Valerie|title=Schwarzenegger inks bills - promoted by gay activists - Recognizes domestic partnerships, day for Milk|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:WSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=12B531761C8EDE08&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0FB3382EE6AD1E46|accessdate=September 27, 2012|newspaper=The Washington Times|date=October 13, 2009|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing the [[Randy Shilts]] book, ''[[The Mayor of Castro Street|The Mayor of Castro Street: The Life and Times of Harvey Milk]]''.&lt;ref name=SC120522&gt;{{cite web|title='Harvey Milk Gay Day' is driving more parents out of government schools|url=http://savecalifornia.com/5-22-12-harvey-milk-gay-day-is-driving-more-parents-out-of-government-schools.html|date=May 22, 2012|accessdate=September 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hate group listing===
In March 2012, the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC) added SaveCalifornia.com to its list of anti-gay hate groups.&lt;ref name=SPLCActive&gt;{{cite web|title=Active Anti-Gay Groups|url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/ideology/anti-gay/active_hate_groups|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|accessdate=September 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to SPLC director Heidi Beirich, "In order to make the list as an anti-gay group, the group has to lie, defame or spread false propaganda about the LGBT community...In this case, language that depicts LGBT people as predatory, attempting to convert children and as having unhealthy lifestyles—all of those things—are what got him on the list." Beirich also stated that such language about an entire group "increases the likelihood of hate crimes being directed at that group."&lt;ref name=Munger&gt;{{cite web|last=Munger|first=Kel|title=Real haters of Sacramento Southern Poverty Law Center calls out Save California for rhetoric|url=http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/real-haters-of-sacramento/content?oid=5449134|publisher=[[Sacramento News &amp; Review]]|accessdate=September 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This keeps pace with the latest global figures on acceptance of homosexuality, which suggest that acceptance of LGBT communities is becoming more widespread only in secular, affluent countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Divide on Homosexuality Greater Acceptance in More Secular and Affluent Countries|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2013/06/04/the-global-divide-on-homosexuality/|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=29 November 2013|date=2013-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, an accepting policy toward gay and lesbian soldiers does not invariably guarantee that LGBT citizens are immune to discrimination in that particular society. Even in countries where LGBT persons are free to serve in the military, activists lament that there remains room for improvement. [[Israel]], for example, a country that otherwise struggles to implement LGBT-positive social policy, nevertheless has a military well known for its broad acceptance of openly gay soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|last=Yaron|first=Oded|title=Israeli LGBT activists mobilize online after gay rights bill fails|journal=Haaretz|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.563186|accessdate=17 December 2013|date=2013-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|last=Sherwood|first=Harriet|title=Israeli military accused of staging gay pride photo|journal=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/13/israeli-military-gay-pride-photo|accessdate=17 December 2013|date=2012-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

History has seen societies that both embrace and shun openly gay service-members in the military. But more recently, the high-profile 2010 hearings on "[[Don't ask, don't tell]]" in the [[United States]] propelled the issue to the center of international attention. They also shed light both on the routine discrimination, violence, and hardship faced by LGBT-identified soldiers, as well as arguments for and against a ban on their service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bacon|first=Perry|title=House votes to end 'don't ask, don't tell' policy|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/27/AR2010052704540.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=17 December 2013|date=2010-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==LGBT Military Index==
The ''LGBT Military Index'' is an index created by The Hague Centre for Strategic Studies that uses 19 indicative policies and best practices to rank over 100 countries on the inclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender service members in the armed forces. Countries with higher rankings, especially the ones at the top, stand out for their multiple concerted efforts to promote the inclusion of gay and lesbian soldiers. In many of them special support and advocacy organizations are present. By contrast, countries near the bottom of the index show the lack of aspiration to promote greater inclusion of the LGBT military personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/20/us-ranks-low-global-index-lgbt-inclusion-armed-forces|title=US ranks low in first-ever global index of LGBT inclusion in armed forces|author=Ed Pilkington|journal=The Guardian|date=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcss.nl/news/lgbt-military-index/873/|title=LGBT Military Index - News - HCSS Centre for Strategic Studies|work=HCSS Centre for Strategic Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projects.hcss.nl/monitor/88/|title=LGBT Military Index - Monitor|work=hcss.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of sexual orientation in the military==

Throughout history, there have been several cultures which have looked favorably on homosexual behavior in the military. Perhaps the most well-known example is found in ancient Greece and Rome. Homosexual behavior was encouraged among soldiers because it was thought to increase unit cohesiveness, morale and bravery.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1960257,00.html A Brief History of Gays in the Military]'', Feb 2, 2010, Times, Retrieved 2013-11-15.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sacred Band of Thebes]] was a military unit from 378 BCE which consisted of male lovers who were known for their effectiveness in battle.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.laits.utexas.edu/ancienthomosexuality/readindex.php?view=26 Homosexuality in Greece and Rome ]'', 2.14 Plutarch, Pelopidas 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; Same-sex love was also prevalent among the Samurai class in Japan and was practiced between an adult and a younger apprentice.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Love_of_the_Samurai.html?id=XSgEAQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y Love of the Samurai: A Thousand Years of Japanese Homosexuality]'', Tsuneo Watanabe and Junʼichi Iwata, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, homosexual behavior has been considered a criminal offense according to civilian and military law in most countries throughout history. There are various accounts of trials and executions of members of the Knights Templar in the 14th Century and British sailors during the Napoleonic wars for homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1960257,00.html Brief History of Gays in the Military]''&lt;/ref&gt; Official bans on gays serving in the military first surfaced in the early 20th century. The U.S. introduced a ban in a revision of the Articles of War of 1916 and the UK first prohibited homosexuality in the Army and Air Force Acts in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1547&amp;context=hrbrief European Court of Human Rights Overturns British Ban on Gays in Military]'', Richard Kamm, Human Rights Brief 7, no. 3, 2000, p. 18-20&lt;/ref&gt; However some nations, of which Sweden is the most well known case, never introduced bans on homosexuality in the military, but issued recommendations on exempting homosexuals from military service.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

To regulate homosexuality in the U.S. military, physical exams and interviews were used to spot men with effeminate characteristics during recruitment. Many soldiers accused of homosexual behavior were discharged for being "sexual psychopaths", although the number of discharges greatly decreased during wartime efforts.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/605/homosexuals_in_the_us_military.html Homosexuals in the U.S. Military: Open Integration and Combat Effectiveness]'', By Elizabeth Kier, International Security 23, no.2, MIT Press, 1998, p. 5-39&lt;/ref&gt;

The rationale for excluding gays and lesbians from serving in the military is often rooted in cultural norms and values and has changed over time. Originally, it was believed that gays were not physically able to serve effectively. The pervading argument during the 20th century focused more on military effectiveness. And finally, more recent justifications include the potential for conflict between heterosexual and homosexual service members and possible "heterosexual resentment and hostility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palmcenter.org/files/FOREIGNMILITARIESPRIMER2010FINAL.pdf|format=PDF|title=GAYS IN FOREIGN MILITARIES 2010: A GLOBAL PRIMER|website=Palm Center|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many countries have since revised these policies and allow gays and lesbians to openly serve in the military (e.g. Israel in 1993 and the UK in 2000). There are currently 26 countries which allow gays and lesbians to serve and around 10 more countries that don't outwardly prohibit them from serving.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/02/03/countries-where-gays-do-s_n_448317.html Countries Where Gays Do Serve Openly In The Military]'', May 25, 2011 Retrieved 2013-15-11&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. is one of the last more developed nations to overturn its ban on allowing gays and lesbians to openly serve in the military when it repealed the Don't Ask Don't Tell policy in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/don-don-ban-openly-gay-troops-overturned-senate-passes-bill-65-31-article-1.473050 'Don't ask, don't tell' ban on openly gay troops overturned, Senate passes bill 65-31]'', Dec 18,2010, Retrieved 2013-15-11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Violence faced by LGBT people in the military==

Physical, sexual, psychological (harassment, bullying) violence faced by LGBT is a fact of life for many LGBT identified persons. In an inherently violent environment, LGBT people may face violence unique to their community in the course of military service.

For instance, the Israeli Defense Force does not ask the sexual orientation of its soldiers, however half of the homosexual soldiers who serve in the IDF suffer from violence and homophobia. LGBT soldiers are often victims of verbal and physical violence and for the most part, commanders ignore the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Katz|first=Yaakov|url=http://www.jpost.com/Defense/Does-viral-IDF-Gay-Pride-photo-show-full-picture|title=Does viral IDF Gay Pride photo show full picture?|publisher=JPost.com|date=2012-12-06|accessdate=2013-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SAPRO, the organization responsible for the oversight of Department of Defense (DoD - USA) sexual assault policy, produces the "Workplace and Gender Relations Survey of Active Duty Member (WGRA)": The 2012 report doesn't have any paragraph studying the specific situation of LGBT people. The study focuses on men and women. The specificity of the violence faced by LGBT people is not considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sapr.mil/public/docs/research/2012_Workplace_and_Gender_Relations_Survey_of_Active_Duty_Members-Survey_Note_and_Briefing.pdf|format=PDF|title=2012 Workplace and Gender Relations Survey of Active Duty Members|publisher=Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office - USA|date=2013-03-15|accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Australian army, the problem is not known officially, only few cases of harassment and discrimination involving gays and lesbians have been recorded. A researcher mentioned that "one would not want to be gay and in the military": Although there has been no major public scandal regarding harassment of gays, this does not mean that such behavior does not occur, but it has been under-studied. Generally, however, incidents of discrimination or harassment brought to the attention of commanders are handled appropriately, incidents in which peers who had made inappropriate remarks are disciplined by superiors promptly and without reservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Belkin|first=Aaron|last2=McNichol|first2=Jason|url=http://www.palmcenter.org/publications/dadt/the_effects_of_including_gay_and_lesbian_soldiers_in_the_australian_defence_forces_appraising_the_evidence|title=The Effects Of Including Gay And Lesbian Soldiers In The Australian Defence Forces: Appraising The Evidence|publisher=Palm Center White Paper|date=2010-09-10|accessdate=2013-11-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813143833/http://www.palmcenter.org/publications/dadt/the_effects_of_including_gay_and_lesbian_soldiers_in_the_australian_defence_forces_appraising_the_evidence|archivedate=2010-08-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transgender military service==
{{Main|Transgender people and military service}}
Like sexual orientation, policies regulating the service of [[transgender]] military personnel vary greatly by country. Based on data collected by the Hague Centre for Strategic Studies&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Polchar et al., LGBT Military Personnel; A Strategic Vision for Inclusion (The Hague, the Netherlands: The Hague Centre for Strategic Studies, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; seventeen countries currently allow transgender people to serve in their military. They are: [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Bolivia]], [[Canada]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Israel]], [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Elders et al, "Medical Aspects of Transgender Military Service" Armed Forces &amp; Society (2014) vol. 41 no. 2 pp 199-220&lt;/ref&gt;

While the US military's [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell]] policy was rescinded in 2011 allowing open service by gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members, transgender people are still barred from entering the US Military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Halloran|first=Liz|title=With Repeal Of 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell,' An Era Ends|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/09/20/140605121/with-repeal-of-dont-ask-dont-tell-an-era-ends|accessdate=17 November 2013|newspaper=National Public Radio|date=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ban is effective via enlistment health screening regulations: "Current or history of psychosexual conditions (302), including but not limited to transsexualism, exhibitionism, transvestism, voyeurism, and other paraphilias."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medical Standards for Appointment, Enlistment, or Induction in the Military Services|url=http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/613003p.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Department of Defense|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Don't Ask, Don't Tell, this policy is not a law mandated by Congress, but an internal military policy. Despite this, studies suggest that the propensity of trans individuals to serve in the US military is as much as twice that as cisgender individuals. In the Harvard Kennedy School's 2013 National Transgender Discrimination Survey, 20% of transgender respondents reported having served in the armed forces, compared with 10% of [[cisgender]] respondents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harrison-Quintana|first=Jack|author2=Jody L.

American transgender veterans face institutional hardships, including the provision of medical care while in the armed services and after discharge stemming from their gender identity or expression. Transgender veterans may also face additional challenges, such as facing a higher rate of homelessness and home foreclosure, higher rates of losing jobs often directly stemming from their trans identity, and high rates of not being hired for specific jobs because of their gender identity.&lt;ref name="Brydum"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Srinivasan|first=Rajiv|title=How to Really Honor Veterans: Extend Benefits to Transgender Vets|url=http://ideas.time.com/2013/11/11/how-to-really-honor-veterans-extend-benefits-to-transgender-vets/|accessdate=17 November 2013|newspaper=Time|date=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrimination in militaries without explicit limitations or welcoming==

In the [[Sexual orientation and the United States military|US army]], six states (Texas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and West Virginia) initially refused{{update inline|date=July 2018}} to comply with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel's order that gay spouses of National Guard members be given the same federal marriage benefits as heterosexual spouses, forcing couples to travel hours round trip to the nearest federal installation. Furthermore, some benefits offered on bases, like support services for relatives of deployed service members, could still be blocked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=OPPEL Jr.|first=Richard A.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/us/texas-and-5-other-states-resist-processing-benefits-for-gay-couples.html?_r=0|title=Texas and 5 Other States Resist Processing Benefits for Gay Couples|publisher=The New York Times|date=2013-11-10|accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent legal changes are claimed to revert practices to those before Don't Ask, Don't Tell's repeal: the US 2013 National Defense Authorization Act contains language some claim permit individuals to continue discriminating against LGB soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dao|first=James|title=How Defense Act Addresses Military Suicides and Issues of Conscience|url=http://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/how-defense-act-addresses-military-suicides-and-issues-of-conscience/?ref=dontaskdonttell|accessdate=18 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, throughout the US army, transgender people are suffering from discrimination: they are prohibited from serving openly because of medical regulations that label them as mentally unstable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grant|first=Jaime M.|url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/downloads/reports/reports/ntds_full.pdf|format=PDF|title=Injustice at Every Turn: A Report of the National Transgender Discrimination Survey|publisher=National Center for Transgender Equality, National Gay and Lesbian Task Force|date=2011-01-10|accessdate=2013-11-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908030754/http://www.thetaskforce.org/downloads/reports/reports/ntds_full.pdf|archive-date=2014-09-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, in Australia, Canada, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, and United Kingdom, as of 2010, when civil partnerships became legal in the respective countries, military family benefits followed the new laws, without discrimination.&lt;ref name="Rostker 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rostker|first=Bernard D.|url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/2010/RAND_MG1056.pdf|format=PDF|title=Sexual Orientation and U.S. Military Personnel Policy: An Update of RAND's 1993 Study|publisher=RAND Corporation|year=2010|accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fear of discrimination may prevent military service members to be open about their sexual orientation. In some cases, in Belgium, homosexual personnel have been transferred from their unit if they have been "too open with their sexuality." The Belgian military also continues to reserve the right to deny gay and lesbian personnel high-level security clearances, for fear they may be susceptible to blackmail.&lt;ref name="Bateman"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bateman|first=Geoffrey W.|last2=Assistant Director for the Center for the Study of Sexual Minorities in the Military, University of California, Santa Barbara|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/military_culture_eur,2.html|title=Military Culture: European|publisher=glbtq: An Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Culture|date=2004-06-23|accessdate=2013-11-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203014849/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/military_culture_eur%2C2.html|archivedate=2013-12-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, a study showed that in Canada, France, Germany, Israel, the Netherlands and Norway, the number of openly homosexual service members was small, representing only a minority of homosexuals actually serving. Serving openly may make their service less pleasant or impede their careers, even though there were no explicit limitations to serve. Thus service members who acknowledged their homosexuality were "appropriately" circumspect in their behavior while in military situations; i.e. they did not call attention to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=RAND Corporation report|url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monograph_reports/2009/RAND_MR323.sum.pdf|format=PDF|title=Sexual Orientation and U.S. Military Personnel Policy: Options and Assessment|publisher=RAND Corporation, National Defense Research Institute|year=1993|accessdate=2013-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, in the Danish army, LGBT military personnel refrain from being completely open about their homosexuality.

In 2010, the same updated study showed that in Australia, Canada, Germany, Israel, Italy and United Kingdom, no special treatment to prevent discrimination was in place in those armies, the issue is not specifically addressed, it is left to the leadership discretion. Commanders said that sexual harassment of women by men poses a far greater threat to unit performance than anything related to sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Rostker 2010"/&gt;

On the other hand, the [[Sexual orientation and the military of the Netherlands|Dutch military]] directly addressed the issue of enduring discrimination, by forming the Homosexuality and Armed Forces Foundation, a trade union that continues to represent gay and lesbian personnel to the ministry of defense, for a more tolerant military culture. Although homosexuals in the Dutch military rarely experience any explicitly aggressive acts against them, signs of homophobia and cultural insensitivity are still present.&lt;ref name="Bateman"/&gt;

==Being LGBT in the military==
In the United States, despite policy changes allowing for open LGBQ military service and the provision of some benefits to same-sex military couples, cultures of homophobia and discrimination persist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Geidner|first=Chirs|title=After Repeal Of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell," Pockets Of Difficulty For Equality|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/after-repeal-of-dont-ask-dont-tell-equalitys-sticking-points|accessdate=29 November 2013|newspaper=BuzzFeed|date=November 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several academics have written on the effects on employees in non-military contexts concealing their sexual orientation in the workplace. Writers on military psychology have linked this work to the experiences of LGBQ military service personnel, asserting that these studies offer insights into the lives of open LGBQ soldiers and those who conceal their orientation.&lt;ref name=moradi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moradi|first=Bonnie|title=Sexual Orientation Disclosure, Concealment, Harassment, and Military Cohesion: Perceptions of LGBT Military Veterans|journal=Military Psychology|volume=21|issue=4|pages=513–533|doi=10.1080/08995600903206453|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual orientation concealment and sexual orientation linked harassment are stressors for LGBT individuals that lead to negative experiences and deleterious job-related outcomes.

In the United States LGBQ soldiers are not required to disclose their sexual orientation, suggesting that some LGBQ service members may continue to conceal their sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom to Serve: The Definitive Guide to LGBT Military Service|url=http://www.sldn.org/page/-/Website/The%20Law/Freedom%20To%20Serve%20Guide%20-%20July%202011.pdf

A 2013 study conducted at the University of Montana found that non-open LGB US veterans face significantly higher rates of [[Depression (clinical)|depression]], [[Post Traumatic Stress Disorder]], and [[Alcohol abuse|alcohol]] or other [[substance abuse]] than their heterosexual counterparts. These veterans also reported facing significant challenges serving while concealing their sexual orientation; 69.3% of subjects in the study reported experiencing fear or anxiety as a result of concealing their sexual identity, and 60.5% reported that those experiences led to a more difficult time for the respondent than heterosexual colleagues. This study also concludes that 14.7% of LGB American veterans made serious attempts at suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cochran|first=Bryan|author2=Kimberly Balsam|author3=Annese Flentje|author4=Carol A.

Evidence suggests that for LGB service members in the United States, the conditions of service and daily life have improved dramatically following the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell. Soldiers who choose to come out experience feelings of liberation, and report that no longer having to hide their orientation allows them to focus on their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Swarns|first=Rachel|title=Out of the Closet and Into a Uniform|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/18/fashion/military-academies-adjusting-to-repeal-of-dont-ask-dont-tell.html?adxnnl=1&amp;ref=dontaskdonttell&amp;adxnnlx=1387392755-Q7Oxdf0e5iVZ+s6U1EtrHA|accessdate=18 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support groups for LGB soldiers have also proliferated in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Frosch|first=Dan|title=In Support Groups for Gay Military Members, Plenty of Asking and Telling|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/30/us/in-support-groups-for-gay-military-members-plenty-of-asking-and-telling.html?ref=dontaskdonttell&amp;_r=0|accessdate=18 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments for including openly LGBT people==

Until recently, many countries banned gays and lesbians from serving openly in the armed forces. The reasons to enforce this ban included the potential negative impact on unit cohesion and privacy concerns. However, many studies commissioned to examine the effects on the military found that little evidence existed to support the discriminatory policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/Military_05_pre.PDF|format=PDF|title=Sexual Orientation and Military Service: Prospects for Organizational and Individual Change in the United States|first=Gregory|last=Herek|website=UC Davis|year=2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206090857/http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/Military_05_pre.PDF|archivedate=2013-12-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, when the bans were repealed in several countries including the UK, Canada, and Australia, no large scale issues arose as a result.&lt;ref name="GAYS IN FOREIGN MILITARIES 2010:
A GLOBAL PRIMER"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palmcenter.org/files/FOREIGNMILITARIESPRIMER2010FINAL.pdf|title=FOREIGN MILITARIES PRIMER 2010|format=PDF|date=|accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, several studies provide evidence that allowing gays and lesbians to openly serve in the armed forces can result in more positive work related outcomes. Firstly, discharging trained military personnel for their sexual orientation is costly and results in loss of talent. The total cost for such discharges in the U.S for violating the Don't Ask Don't Tell policy amounted to more than 290 million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Gates-GLBmilitaryUpdate-May-20101.pdfformat=PDF|title=Lesbian, gay, and bisexual men and women in the US military: Updated estimates|publisher=The Williams Institute|year=2010 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, privacy for service members has actually increased in countries with inclusive policies and led to a decrease in harassment. Although, it is important to note that many gays and lesbians do not disclose their sexual orientation once the ban is repealed.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.palmcenter.org/files/FOREIGNMILITARIESPRIMER2010FINAL.pdf], Gays in Foreign Militaries 2010: A Global Primer.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, allowing gays to openly serve ends decades of discrimination in the military and can lead to a more highly-qualified pool of recruits. For instance, the British military reduced its unfilled position gap by more than half after allowing gays to openly serve.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://edition.cnn.com/2010/US/05/19/us.allies.military.gays/ U.S. allies say integrating gays in military was nonissue]'', May 20, 2010, Retrieved 2013-15-11&lt;/ref&gt;
Therefore, more evidence exists now to support policies that allow gays and lesbians to openly serve in the military.

==Arguments for not including openly LGBT people==

The arguments against allowing openly gay servicemen and women in the military abound. While most research data have all but debunked traditional arguments in favor of policies like [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell]], homosexuality is still perceived by most countries to be incompatible with military service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frank|first=Nathaniel|title=How Gay Soldiers Serve Openly Around The World|url=https://www.npr.org/2010/12/07/131857684/how-gay-soldiers-serve-openly-around-the-world|publisher=NPR|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recurrent argument for a ban on homosexuals in the military rests on the assumption that, in the face of potentially homosexual members of their unit, prospective recruits would shy away from military service. Based on an inconclusive study produced by the [[RAND Corporation]] in the run-up to the repeal of [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell]], American military recruits were expected to decrease by as much as 7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual Orientation and US Military Personnel Policy|url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/2010/RAND_MG1056.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=RAND Corporation|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this does not appear to have materialized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=One Year Out: An Assessment of DADT Repeal's Impact on Military Readiness|url=http://www.palmcenter.org/files/One%20Year%20Out_0.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Palm Center|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a line of work that regularly demands that personnel be in close living quarters, allowing openly homosexual servicemen is argued to flout a fundamental tenet of military service: ensuring that soldiers remain undistracted from their mission. If gay men are allowed to shower with their fellow male soldiers, so goes the argument, this would, in effect, violate the "unique conditions" of military life by putting sexually compatible partners in close proximity, with potentially adverse effects on retention and morale of troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Readiness, Retention, Recruitment: Repeal of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell"|url=https://www.gop.gov/policy-news/10/05/26/readiness-retention-recruitment|publisher=House Republicans|accessdate=25 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213202048/http://www.gop.gov/policy-news/10/05/26/readiness-retention-recruitment|archivedate=13 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Testimony advanced during the hearings on [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell]] of 1993, with US Senator [[Sam Nunn]] and General [[Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr.]] recalled "instances where heterosexuals have been solicited to commit homosexual acts, and, even more traumatic emotionally, physically coerced to engage in such acts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Belkin|first=Aaron|title=Don't Ask, Don't Tell: Is the Gay Ban Based on Military Necessity?|url=http://strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/parameters/articles/03summer/belkin.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Strategic Studies Institute|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military historian [[Mackubin Thomas Owens]] conjectured in an Op-Ed for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' that gay men and women would be partial to their lovers in the heat of battle. "Does a superior order his or her beloved into danger," Owens asks, "if he or she demonstrates favoritism, what is the consequence for unit morale and discipline? What happens when jealousy rears its head?" Owens echoes the fear that allowing gay soldiers would be deleterious to unit cohesion on the battlefield, arguing that concern for one's lover in a given unit could override any sense of loyalty to the unit as a whole, particularly in situations of life and death.&lt;ref name="Owens"&gt;{{cite news|last=Owens|first=Mackubin Thomas|title=The Case Against Gays in the Military|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703389004575033601528093416|accessdate=25 November 2013|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=2 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owens further asserts that homosexuality may be incompatible with military service because it undermines the very ethos of a military, that is, one of nonsexual "friendship, comradeship or brotherly love".&lt;ref name="Owens"/&gt;

[[Tony Perkins (politician)|Tony Perkins]] of the [[Family Research Council]], a socially conservative advocacy organization, believes that allowing openly homosexual soldiers threatens the religious liberty of servicemen who disapprove of homosexuality for religious reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Perkins|first=Tony|title=My Take: Ending 'don't ask, don't tell' would undermine religious liberty|url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2010/06/01/my-take-ending-dont-ask-dont-tell-would-undermine-religious-liberty/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=25 November 2013|date=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argentina===
As of 2009, the Argentine government has officially ended the ban on homosexuals in the [[Armed Forces of the Argentine Republic|Argentine Armed Forces]]. A new military justice system was put into effect which decriminalizes homosexuality among uniformed members, and moves crimes committed exclusively within the military to the public justice sphere [previously there had been a separate military court system].

Under the old system, homosexuals were not permitted to have access to a military career, at the same time as this sexual orientation was penalized. And, while there are no publicly known former sanctions against homosexuals under the old policy, this does not mean that men and women with that sexual orientation have not been disciplined, and perhaps separated from the armed forces under a mantle of silence. In fact, with this new system, homosexuals who wish to train in the forces should encounter no impediment, nor any military retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smink|first=Veronica|date=28 February 2009|title=Argentina: abren paso a gays en FF.AA.|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/latin_america/newsid_7916000/7916193.stm|language=Spanish|work=[[BBC Mundo]]|location=|access-date=27 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, if the behaviour of an individual who is gay or lesbian causes problems, that individual is subject to discipline or discharge. In some cases, homosexual personnel have been transferred from their unit if they have been too open with their sexuality. The Belgian military also continues to reserve the right to deny gay and lesbian personnel high-level security clearances, for fear they may be susceptible to blackmail.&lt;ref name="Military Culture: Europe"&gt;[http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/military_culture_eur.html Military Culture: Europe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051121165333/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/military_culture_eur.html|date=2005-11-21 }} glbtq: An encyclopaedia of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender &amp; queer culture.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
There is no law forbidding lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people from serving in the [[Brazilian Armed Forces]]. Sexual orientation and gender identity cannot be an obstacle for entry into the police force or the military in Brazil, and some [[trans women]] and [[travesti]]s should make [[conscription]], like some Brazilian male citizens. All sexual acts are disallowed between members of the forces, be they heterosexual or homosexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.fcs.edu.uy/investigacion/observatorioFFAA/Informe%20Brasil/Informe%20Brasil013.htm LGBT people and Military service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002175140/http://www.fcs.edu.uy/investigacion/observatorioFFAA/Informe%20Brasil/Informe%20Brasil013.htm|date=October 2, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Constitution of Brazil]] prohibits any form of [[Anti-discrimination laws in Brazil|discrimination]] in the country. The Brazilian Armed Forces does not permit [[desertion]], [[Human sexual activity|sexual acts]] or congeners in the military, whether heterosexual or homosexual. They claim that it is not a homophobic rule, but a rule of [[discipline]] that also includes the opposite sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://blogdofavre.ig.com.br/2010/06/final-feliz-na-caserna/ Final feliz na caserna] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005035117/http://blogdofavre.ig.com.br/2010/06/final-feliz-na-caserna/|date=October 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, during the disappearance of a military gay couple, the Ministry of Defence of Brazil spoke: "the sergeant is to be questioned about alleged [[desertion]] from the military and there is no question of discrimination."

No information currently exists as to whether military personnel can have their same-sex relationships recognized by the military, despite the fact that federal government employees can receive benefits for their same-sex spouses.

Its title is "Effects of the 1992 Lifting of Restrictions on Gay and Lesbian Service in the Canadian Forces; Appraising the Evidence".

* Lifting of restrictions on gay and lesbian service in the Canadian Forces has not led to any change in military performance, [[unit cohesion]], or discipline.
* Self-identified gay, lesbian, and transsexual members of the Canadian Forces contacted for the study describe good working relationships with peers.
* The number of military women who experienced sexual harassment dropped 46% after the ban was lifted. While there were several reasons why harassment declined, one factor was that after the ban was lifted women were free to report assaults without fear that they would be accused of being a lesbian.
* Before Canada lifted its gay ban, a 1985 survey of 6,500 male soldiers found that 62% said that they would refuse to share showers, undress or sleep in the same room as a gay soldier. After the ban was lifted, follow-up studies found no increase in disciplinary, performance, recruitment, sexual misconduct, or resignation problems.
* None of the 905 assault cases in the Canadian Forces from November, 1992 (when the ban was lifted) until August, 1995 involved gay bashing or could be attributed to the sexual orientation of one of the parties.

A news article by Canadian journalist, Jon Tattrie, reported on the changed attitude towards the presence of homosexual members of the Canadian Forces in his article "Being Gay in the Military" (''[[Metro International|Metro Ottawa]]''), quoting Canadian Forces spokesperson Rana Sioufi as saying: "Members who are same-sex partners are entitled to the same respect and dignity as heterosexual married couples or common-law partners."&lt;ref name=metroottawa&gt;Tattrie, Jon (20 August 2010).

===Chile===
The [[Military of Chile]] does not discriminate on grounds of sexual orientation. Chile bans all anti-gay discrimination since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jurist.org/paperchase/2012/04/chile-congress-passes-anti-discrimination-law.php|title=Chile Congress passes anti-discrimination law|publisher=Jurist.org|accessdate=2013-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 13, 2014, The Defense Ministry ordered the creation of a new committee to monitor inclusion and tackle discrimination in the armed forces, a move hailed as a "historic" step by gay rights campaigners.
Marcos Robledo, defense undersecretary, announced the formation of a Diversity and Anti-Discrimination Committee with the aim to eradicate arbitrary discrimination in the military.
The resolution, signed by Defense Minister Jorge Burgos, established the government as responsible for creating a more inclusive armed services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://santiagotimes.cl/gay-rights-group-lauds-efforts-make-chilean-military-inclusive/|title=Gay rights group lauds efforts to make Chilean military more inclusive|publisher=Santiagotimes.cl|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140816094928/http://santiagotimes.cl/gay-rights-group-lauds-efforts-make-chilean-military-inclusive/|archivedate=2014-08-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Few days later, a sailor in Chile became the first serving member of the Chilean armed forces to announce he is gay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-28961883|title=Chilean sailor makes history after announcing he is gay|journal=BBC News|date=2014-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mauricio Ruiz, 24, told a televised news conference his decision had "not been easy", but he wanted to help fight discrimination against homosexuals. Mr Ruiz said that what was most important was not a soldier's sexual orientation, but his or her willingness to serve the country. His announcement came with the full backing of the Chilean armed.
Mauricio Ruiz said homosexuals had "no reason to hide". "We can do anything, be marines or in any branch (of the military). We can do whatever profession, and we deserve as much respect as anyone else," he told reporters in the Chilean capital, Santiago. "In life there's nothing better than to be yourself, to be authentic, to look at people in the eye and for those people to know who you are."

Rolando Jimenez, president of Chile's Movement for Integration and Homosexual Liberation, expressed his gratitude to the Chilean Navy. "(The Navy is) telling the country and the members of the institution particularly that it is possible for gays and lesbians to be part of the armed forces and that they aren't going to suffer discrimination because of their sexual orientation within these institutions," Mr Jimenez said.

===Colombia===
In 1999 the Colombian Constitutional Court ruled that the prohibition of homosexuals from serving in the armed forces is unconstitutional and members of the LGBT community may serve openly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-918685 |title=Sí A Homosexuales, Con Discreción |trans-title=Yes To Gays, With Discretion |publisher=Eltiempo.com |accessdate=2013-11-12 |language=Spanish|date=1999-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Croatia===
LGBT persons are not banned from participation in military service. [[Ministry of Defence (Croatia)|Ministry of Defence]] has no internal rules regard LGBT persons, but it follows regulation at the state level which explicitly prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Some media reports have suggested that most gay men serving in the military generally decide to keep their sexual orientation private, but there have also been reports suggesting that the [[Military of Croatia|Croatian Armed Forces]] take discrimination very seriously and will not tolerate homophobia among its personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Orhidea Gaura|url=http://arhiva.nacional.hr/clanak/94181/biti-gay-u-hrvatskoj-vojsci|title=Biti gay u Hrvatskoj vojsci – Nacional.hr|publisher=Arhiva.nacional.hr|date=2012-06-29|accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/hrvatska/hrvatska-vojska-gay-je-ok-34439|title=Hrvatska vojska: Gay je OK - Večernji.hr|publisher=Vecernji.hr|date=|accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
The German [[Bundeswehr]] ruled that it is forbidden to discriminate based on sexual orientation. The "Working Committee of Homosexual Employees in the Military Forces"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahsab.de/ A.H.s.A.B.&amp;nbsp;– Arbeitskreis homosexueller Angehöriger der Bundeswehr] (Site is only in German)&lt;/ref&gt; is the organization that represents the interests of gay men and lesbians in the armed forces. Heterosexuals and homosexuals alike are allowed to engage in sexual activity while in the military service as long as it does not interfere with the performance of their duties. Lesbian and gay soldiers are also entitled to enter civil unions as defined by Germany's domestic "partnership" law.&lt;ref name=queer&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.queer.de/detail.php?article_id=10083|title=Argentinien und die Philippinen beenden Homo-Verbot im Militär|trans-title=Argentina and the Philippines end the military gay ban|publisher=queer.de|date=March 4, 2009|language=German|accessdate=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bundeswehr]] maintained a "[[glass ceiling]]" policy that effectively banned homosexuals from becoming officers until 2000. First Lieutenant Winfried Stecher, an army officer demoted for his homosexuality, filed a lawsuit against former Defense Minister [[Rudolf Scharping]]. Scharping vowed to fight the claim in court, claiming that homosexuality "raises serious doubts about suitability and excludes employment in all functions pertaining to leadership." However, before the case went to trial, the Defense Ministry reversed the discriminatory policy. While the German government declined to issue an official explanation for the reversal, it is widely believed that Scharping was overruled by then Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] and then Vice-Chancellor [[Joschka Fischer]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Currently, according to general military orders given in the year 2000, tolerance towards all sexual orientations is considered to be part of the duty of military personnel. Sexual relationships and acts amongst soldiers outside service times, regardless of the sexual orientation, are defined to be "irrelevant", regardless of the rank and function of the soldier(s) involved, while harassment or the abuse of functions is considered a transgression, as well as the performance of sexual acts in active service.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. two orders of 2000: {{cite web|url=http://www.ahsab.de/recherche.php?aktion=show_one&amp;show=Recherche&amp;id=16&amp;download=Anlage%20B%20173.pdf|format=PDF|title=Anlage B 173 zu ZDv 14/3|accessdate=24 December 2008|author=German Military Forces (Bundeswehr)|year=2000|publisher=Working Group 'Homosexuals in the Bundeswehr'|language=German|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206023737/http://www.ahsab.de/recherche.php?aktion=show_one&amp;show=Recherche&amp;id=16&amp;download=Anlage%20B%20173.pdf|archivedate=6 February 2009|df=}} ; and {{cite web|url=http://www.ahsab.de/recherche.php?aktion=show_one&amp;show=Recherche&amp;id=16&amp;download=sexualitaet.pdf|format=PDF|title=Führungshilfe für Vorgesetzte&amp;nbsp;– Sexualität|accessdate=24 December 2008|author=Inspector General of the German Military Forces (Bundeswehr)|year=2000|publisher=Working Group 'Homosexuals in the Bundeswehr'|language=German|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206023720/http://www.ahsab.de/recherche.php?aktion=show_one&amp;show=Recherche&amp;id=16&amp;download=sexualitaet.pdf|archivedate=February 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the Hellenic army has been shortening the length of conscription and hiring more and more professional soldiers and there hasn't been any incident of someone being fired for homosexuality.

===Republic of Ireland===

Homosexuals can serve openly in the [[Irish Defence Forces]].&lt;ref name="palmcenter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="military.ie"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.military.ie/fileadmin/user_upload/images/Info_Centre/Docs2/EqualityPolicy_Dec07.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707035010/http://www.military.ie/fileadmin/user_upload/images/Info_Centre/Docs2/EqualityPolicy_Dec07.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Cathal Kelly, International Secretary of the National Lesbian and Gay Foundation, which implements recent equality legislation in Ireland, says that the Employment Equality Act of 1998 applies to the Irish military.&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been no preclusion since 1993 when male homosexuality was decriminalised in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. Since 1993 there has been significant change to make sure that there was no discrimination in terms of public policy. At the same time as an equal age of consent was introduced for heterosexual and homosexual persons, the Irish Defence Forces announced that they would be treating heterosexual and homosexual members equally. Relationships between senior and junior ranks would continue to be forbidden, as is common in most militaries. There would also be no harassment of gay officers and no questioning of members about their sexuality. The ''[[Irish Independent]]'' wrote that

{{quote|In a related development, the Chief of Staff of the Irish Defence Forces, Lieutenant General Noel Bergin, told the ''Irish Independent'' on Tuesday that a report on the introduction of a code of conduct governing interpersonal relationships is being prepared. The decision to prepare a report follows a recent announcement by the Minister for Defence, [[David Andrews (Irish politician)|Mr. David Andrews]], that military regulations would be modified to take account of any reform in the civil law on homosexuality. Mr Andrews is seen as a member of the liberal wing of the [[Fianna Fáil]] party. Lt. Gen Bergin pointed out that the Army does not ask potential recruits about their sexual orientation, and that they had few problems in the past in this area.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Irish Independent'', May 1993{{dead link|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The then Minister for Defence David Andrews stated in the [[Oireachtas]] (parliament) that "While the question of homosexuality is not specifically covered in Defence Force Regulations the provisions of section 169 of the Defence Act, 1954, provide that acts which are in breach of the criminal law of the State are also deemed to be offences against military law."{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Information regarding sexual orientation is not sought from personnel wishing to enlist in the Defence Forces and it is not proposed to change this policy. The Defence forces have a code on interpersonal relationships and guidelines in relation to discrimination.&lt;ref name="military.ie"/&gt;

A policy in 1983 allowed prospective Israeli soldiers to be questioned about their sexual orientation. Scholars Ben-Ari and Kaplan suggested that the prospective soldiers' responses affected what military unit they would be assigned to. However, the 1993 policy was put into effect to remove the 1983 policy.&lt;ref&gt;Eyal Ben-Ari, Danny Kaplan, "Brothers and Others in Arms: Managing Gay Identity in Combat Units of the Israel Army," ''Sage Publications'' (2000):400.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Israel Defense Forces]] policies allow gay men and lesbians to serve openly and without discrimination or harassment due to actual or perceived sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/02/opinion/02shalikashvili.html?_r=1 Second Thoughts on Gays in the Military], By JOHN M. SHALIKASHVILI, January 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This was put into effect in 1993 after an IDF reserves officer testified before the [[Knesset]] claiming that his rank had been revoked, and that he had been barred from researching sensitive topics in military intelligence, solely because of his sexual identity.&lt;ref name="online"&gt;Suzanne B.

According to a [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] study,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmforum.org/films/yossi/israelstudyafs.pdf ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214044435/http://www.filmforum.org/films/yossi/israelstudyafs.pdf|date=December 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a brigadier general stated that Israelis show a "great tolerance" for gay soldiers. Consul [[David Saranga]] at the Israeli Consulate in [[New York City|New York]], who was interviewed by the ''St. Petersburg Times'', said, "It's a non-issue. You can be a very good officer, a creative one, a brave one, and be gay at the same time."&lt;ref name=eichner /&gt;

In a comprehensive review of interviews with all known experts on homosexuality in the IDF in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palmcenter.org/node/554 Did Lifting the Gay Ban Undermine Military Performance?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218191205/http://www.palmcenter.org/node/554|date=2011-02-18 }} Palm Centre, Jun 04.&lt;/ref&gt; researchers were not able to find any data suggesting that Israel's decision to lift its gay ban undermined operational effectiveness, combat readiness, unit cohesion or morale. In this security-conscious country where the military is considered to be essential to the continued existence of the nation, the decision to include sexual minorities has not harmed IDF effectiveness.

While no official statistics are available for harassment rates of sexual minorities in the IDF, scholars, military officials and representatives of gay organizations alike assert that vicious harassment is rare.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} A study published by the [[Israel Gay Youth]] Movement in January 2012 found that half of the homosexual soldiers who serve in the IDF suffer from violence and homophobia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Defense/Article.aspx?id=273609], "Does viral IDF Gay Pride photo show full picture?" By Yaakov Katz, Jerusalem Post, June 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the law states that gay soldiers cannot be discriminated against by the Israeli military, does not mean it does not occur between soldiers. Ben-Ari and Kaplan, the scholars who wrote “Sexual Orientation and Military Service”, discovered that gay Israeli soldiers faced discrimination from their fellow military men because they were viewed as mentally ill, lonely, and insecure.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Ben-Ari, Kaplan, "Brothers and Others in Army," 402.&lt;/ref&gt; Ben- Ari and Kaplan cited a study about how an Israeli soldier's sexual partner preference influenced the way they were treated.  The study conveyed that soldiers bonded in the Israeli military through homophobic remarks and sexualizing women.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; There was another study that scholars Ben-Ari and Kaplan created that determined how gay Israeli soldiers responded to the macho man stereotype in the military. Gay soldiers either isolated themselves from the rest of the soldiers or attempted to adapt to heterosexual norms. In the end, gay soldiers' military performance was not affected by their response but their integration into the military was affected.&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Ari, Kaplan, "Brothers and Others in Army," 421&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, the [[Netherlands]] was the first country to ban discrimination against gays in the military.&lt;ref&gt;Shilts, p. 572&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch government considered homosexuality grounds for dismissal until 1974, when the Association of Dutch Homosexuals convinced the Minister of Defense that gays posed no threat to national security. The Dutch military formed a working group called Homosexuality and Armed Forces to improve the climate for sexual minorities. In the 1980s, this group became the Homosexuality and Armed Forces Foundation, a trade union that continues to represent gay and lesbian personnel to the Ministry of Defense.&lt;ref name="Military Culture: Europe"/&gt;

===New Zealand===
In [[New Zealand]] it has been legal for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender persons to serve in the military since New Zealand's Human Rights Act 1993 ended most forms of employment discrimination against lesbians, gay men and bisexuals.

After the passing of the Human Rights Act, which prevents discrimination on grounds such as ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation. As the act came into law, so came the removal of a passage in the NZDF manual of law that referred to homosexuality as an "unnatural offence". Before 1993, even though the Homosexual Law Reform Act had been passed in 1986, officer training included the actions they ought to take upon the discovery of personnel caught in such acts. The DEFGLIS NZ (Defence Force Gay and Lesbian Information Service) is being formed and will be set up by Christmas 2010. Officers involved hope the support network will act as a sounding board, advice group and social network for regular, reserve and civilian members of the troops. Part of the group's role will be to advise on using inclusive words such as partner instead of wife, or letting people know that a saying such as "that's gay" has made it into common parlance while the term "homo" is offensive.

The Government accepted the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peruanista.blogspot.com/2009/12/perus-constitutional-tribunal-ordered.html|title=Peru's Constitutional Court ordered Police School to accept expelled Gay Student|publisher=Peruanista.blogspot.com|date=2009-12-10|accessdate=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling said "sexual preference of an individual cannot be a requirement or condition to determine his/her capacity or professional competence, including the police and military career. To state this is not only anachronistic, but it violates the principle of human dignity"

===Philippines===
The Philippine government has officially ended, as of 2010, the ban on gays in the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iglhrc.org/content/philippines-acceptance-gays-military-does-not-mean-equality-yet|title=The Philippines: Acceptance of Gays in the Military does not Mean Equality (Yet)|work=IGLHRC: International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission|date=2009-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portugal===
Portugal allows all citizens to serve openly in the military regardless of sexual orientation, as the constitution explicitly forbids any discrimination on that basis, therefore openly allowing lesbians and gays to serve in the military.&lt;ref&gt;[http://typo3.lsvd.de/fileadmin/pics/Dokumente/Homosexualitaet/World_legal_wrap_up_survey._November2006.pdf ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310152845/http://typo3.lsvd.de/fileadmin/pics/Dokumente/Homosexualitaet/World_legal_wrap_up_survey._November2006.pdf|date=March 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, Portugal's armed forces chief General Carlos Jerónimo resigned, days after being summoned to explain comments about gay soldiers made by the deputy head of the military college. President [[Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa]] accepted the resignation of Jerónimo, who took up the post of chief of staff in 2014. The resignation came after António Grilo, deputy head of the military college, admitted advising parents of young military students in the Portuguese army to withdraw their sons if they were gay "to protect them from the other students". [[Ministry of National Defense (Portugal)|Defence Minister]] Azeredo Lopes considered any discrimination "absolutely unacceptable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/world/portugal-military-chief-resigns-over-remark-on-gay-soldiers_1873885.html|title=Portugal military chief resigns over remark on gay soldiers|date=8 April 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romania===
Homosexuals are allowed to serve openly in the [[Romanian army]].

===South Africa===
LGBT people are allowed to serve openly in the [[South African National Defence Force]] (SANDF),&lt;ref name="palmcenter" /&gt; and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is prohibited by the constitution, statute law and military policy.

The [[Interim Constitution of South Africa|Interim Constitution]] which was adopted in 1994, and the [[Constitution of South Africa|final Constitution]] which replaced it in 1997, prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. In 1996 the government adopted the ''White Paper on National Defence'', which included the statement that, "In accordance with the Constitution, the SANDF shall not discriminate against any of its members on the grounds of sexual orientation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.za/whitepapers/1996/defencwp.htm|title=White Paper on National Defence for the Republic of South Africa: Defence in a Democracy|publisher=Government of South Africa|date=8 May 1996|accessdate=16 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616144303/http://www.info.gov.za/whitepapers/1996/defencwp.htm|archivedate=16 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 the [[Department of Defence (South Africa)|Department of Defence]] adopted a ''Policy on Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action'', in terms of which recruits may not be questioned about their sexual orientation and the Defence Force officially takes no interest in the lawful sexual behaviour of its members.&lt;ref name="canaday"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Belkin|first1=Aaron|last2=Canaday|first2=Margot|year=2010|title=Assessing the integration of gays and lesbians into the South African National Defence Force|journal=Scientia Militaria|volume=38|issue=2|pages=1–21|doi=10.5787/38-2-87|url=http://www.palmcenter.org/files/South%20Africa%20study.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=18 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924063707/http://www.palmcenter.org/files/South%20Africa%20study.pdf|archive-date=2015-09-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sodomy law]]s were [[National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality v Minister of Justice|struck down during the same year]].

The [[Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act, 2000|Equality Act of 2000]], which prohibits discrimination, hate speech and harassment, applies to the military just as it does to the rest of society. The Defence Act of 2002 makes it a criminal offence for any SANDF member or Defence Department employee to "denigrate, humiliate or show hostility or aversion to" any person on the grounds of sexual orientation. In 2002 the SANDF extended spousal medical and pension benefits to "partners in a permanent life-partnership",&lt;ref name="canaday" /&gt; and in 2006 [[same-sex marriage in South Africa|same-sex marriage was legalised]].

===Sweden===

The policy change was announced after a local newspaper revealed the discriminatory practice, prompting protest demonstrations in Taipei, the nation's capital.

Col. Liu of the ROC Naval Attache said that ending the ban on gays in the military police was "a good thing for a democratic society like ours. I don't think this is really a big deal," he said. "It just means Taiwanese society is more open and there are different choices now. If you're gay and you can do the job, that's fine."&lt;ref name="taiwan"/&gt;

In 2005, the Thai armed forces lifted its ban on [[LGBT rights in Thailand|LGBT]] serving in the military.

{{See also|LGBT rights in the United Kingdom}}

Until 2000, the British [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MOD) policy was to continue the long standing ban on homosexuals joining any of the [[British Armed Forces|Armed Forces]], most recently being based on a 1996 report by the Homosexuality Policy Assessment Team, which asserted that to allow gays in the military would be bad for morale, and leave them vulnerable to blackmail from foreign intelligence agencies. As a consequence, around 60 people were dismissed annually from the services for being gay;&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; 298 were dismissed in 1999, the year before the ban was lifted.&lt;ref name="dm"&gt;{{cite news|author=Ian Drury|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1234993/Gay-trooper-says-coming-best-decision.html|title=My very personal battle, by the soldier who came out while serving in Afghanistan|publisher=Mail Online|date=12 December 2009|accessdate=2013-11-12|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A legal challenge to this stance was taken up by four people who had been investigated and dismissed for being gay&amp;nbsp;— a female nurse and male administrator dismissed from the [[Royal Air Force]], and a [[Lieutenant Commander]] and [[naval rating]], both males, dismissed from the [[Royal Navy]]. Their legal challenge was supported by the pressure groups [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]] and [[Stonewall (UK)|Stonewall]]. After losing the case at the [[EWCA Civ|Court of Appeal]] in London, they appealed to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in Strasbourg. In September 1999, this court ruled that investigations by military authorities into a service person's sexuality breaches their right to privacy ([[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights]]). In light of the ruling (which as an ECHR ruling applies to the militaries of all member states of the [[European Union|EU]] and of the [[Council of Europe]]), the MOD subsequently lifted the ban, and began allowing gay people into the services from 2000 onwards. According to a national opinion poll published a week before the ruling, the ban had been opposed by 68% of Britons.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/620178.stm UK Gays win military legal battle] BBC News, 27 September 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/458752.stm|title=Head to head: Gays in the military|publisher=BBC News|date=1999-09-27|accessdate=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, following defeat of repeal of 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' by the [[United States Senate]], the [[British Army officer rank insignia|Colonel]] Mark Abraham, head of ''Faith and Diversity'' for the British Army, told People Management magazine the lifting of the ban on gays serving in the military in 2000 had "no notable change at all... We got to the point where the policy was incompatible with military service and there was a lack of logic and evidence to support it... We knew a lot of gay and lesbian people were serving quite successfully, and it was clear that sexual orientation wasn't an indication of how good a soldier or officer you could be... The reality was that those serving in the army were the same people the day after we lifted the ban, so there was no notable change at all. Everybody carried on with their duties and had the same working relationships as they previously had while the ban was in place" Colonel Abraham argues that the lifting of the ban actually made the armed forces more productive: "A lot of gay and lesbian soldiers who were in the army before the ban was lifted, reported that a percentage of their efforts was spent looking over their shoulder and ensuring they weren't going to be caught. That percentage of time can now be devoted to work and their home life, so actually they are more effective than they were before."&lt;ref name="online"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2010/09/29/british-army-claims-having-openly-gay-soliders-hasincreased-productivity|title=British army claims having openly gay soldiers has 'increased productivity'|publisher=Pink News|date=2010-09-29|accessdate=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Current policy====
The MOD's policy since 12 January 2000 is to allow homosexual men, lesbians and [[transgender]] personnel to serve openly, and discrimination on a sexual orientation basis is forbidden.&lt;ref name=queer /&gt; It is also forbidden for someone to pressure LGBT people to [[Coming out|come out]]. All personnel are subject to the same rules against [[sexual harassment]], regardless of gender or sexual orientation.

The British military actively recruits gay men and lesbians, all three services have deployed recruiting teams to [[gay pride]] events, and punishes any instance of intolerance or bullying. The Royal Navy advertises for recruits in gay magazines and has allowed gay sailors to hold civil partnership ceremonies on board ships and, since 2006, to march in full naval uniform at gay pride marches. [[British Army]] and Royal Air Force personnel could march but had to wear civilian clothes until 2008, now all military personnel are permitted to attend gay pride marches in uniform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4133763.ece|work=The Times|location=London|title=Soldiers can wear their uniforms with pride at gay parade says MoD|first1=Damian|last1=Barr|first2=Lucy|last2=Bannerman|date=June 14, 2008|accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking at a conference sponsored by the gay advocacy group Stonewall in 2006, [[Adrian Johns|Vice Admiral Adrian Johns]], the [[Second Sea Lord]], said that homosexuals had always served in the military but in the past had to do it secretly. "That's an unhealthy way to be, to try and keep a secret life in the armed services," said Vice Admiral Johns, who as the Royal Navy's principal personnel officer was responsible for about 39,000 sailors. His speech was titled "Reaping the Rewards of a Gay-Friendly Workplace."

The current policy was accepted at the lower ranks first, with many senior officers worrying for their troops without a modern acceptance of homosexuality that their personnel had grown up with, one [[Brigadier]] resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Brigadier quits over gays in military|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/620178.stm|publisher=BBC|work=BBC News|date=27 January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the change support at the senior level has grown. General Sir [[Richard Dannatt, Baron Dannatt|Richard Dannatt]], the [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the General Staff]] (head of the Army), told members of the Army-sponsored ''Fourth Joint Conference on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transexual Matters'' that homosexuals were welcome to serve in the Army. In a speech to the conference in 2008, the first of its kind by any Army chief, General Sir Richards said that respect for gays, lesbian, bisexual and transsexual officers and soldiers was now "a command responsibility" and was vital for "operational effectiveness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rayment|first=Sean|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/onthefrontline/3179261/Armys-top-general-makes-history-by-addressing-conference-on-homosexuality.html|title=Army's top general makes history by addressing conference on homosexuality|publisher=Telegraph.co.uk|date=2008-10-11|accessdate=2013-11-12|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Military immediately recognised [[Civil partnership in the United Kingdom|civil partnerships]] and granted gay couples the same rights to allowances and housing as straight couples. The MoD stated "We're pleased personnel registered in a same sex relationship now have equal rights to married couples."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=James Clench|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article36511.ece|title=And the brides wore combats|publisher=The Sun|date=2007-07-27|accessdate=2013-11-12|location=London}}{{Subscription required|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Navy has conducted civil partnership ceremonies on ships and the British Army has held same-sex marriage celebrations in barracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/a-very-modern-military-partnership-1928748.html|title=A very modern military partnership|publisher=Independent|date=2010-03-27|accessdate=2013-11-12|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homosexuals are allowed to serve openly in the [[United States]] military. Military policy and legislation had previously entirely prohibited gay individuals from serving, and subsequently from serving openly, but these prohibitions were ended in September 2011 after the U.S. Congress voted to repeal the policy.

The first time homosexuals were differentiated from non-homosexuals in the military literature was in revised army mobilization regulations in 1942. Additional policy revisions in 1944 and 1947 further codified the ban. Throughout the next few decades, homosexuals were routinely discharged, regardless of whether they had engaged in sexual conduct while serving. In response to the [[LGBT movements in the United States|gay rights movements]] of the 1970s and 1980s, including the famed [[Vernon Berg, III|"Copy" Berg case]], the Department of Defense issued a 1982 policy (DOD Directive 1332.14) stating that homosexuality was clearly incompatible with military service. Controversy over this policy created political pressure to amend the policy, with [[liberalism in the United States|socially liberal]] efforts seeking a repeal of the ban and [[conservatism in the United States|socially conservative]] groups wishing to reinforce it by statute.

A legislative policy was enacted in a 1993 bill signed by President [[Bill Clinton]]. The new policy continued the ban under which homosexuals were prohibited from serving in the military and their discharge was required. The main change that the new policy made was to prohibit investigation into a member's sexual orientation without suspicion. The new policy was known as "[[Don't ask, don't tell]]" and was seen as a compromise between the two political efforts.

Pressure to overturn the ban continued to build throughout the 1990s and 2000s, as public opposition to gay rights waned. In December 2010, a Democratically controlled House and a Democratically controlled Senate passed and President [[Barack Obama]] signed the [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010]] which created a future pathway to allow homosexuals to serve in the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Broverman|first=Neal|url=http://advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2010/12/20/Repeal_To_Be_Signed_Wednesday/|title=Repeal to be Signed Wednesday|publisher=Advocate.com|date=2010-12-20|accessdate=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the terms of the bill, the "Don't ask, don't tell" policy remained in place until the [[President of the United States|President]], the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], and the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff|Chairman of the Joint Chiefs]] certified that repeal would not harm military readiness, followed by a 60 days waiting period.&lt;ref name="us-wapo-201106"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/post/gates-open-to-ending-dont-ask-dont-tell-before-he-goes/2011/06/13/AGwtRMUH_blog.html|title=Gates open to ending 'don't ask, don't tell' before leaving|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=June 13, 2011|first=Ed|last=O'Keefe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chsc-2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Military/2011/0404/Pentagon-Don-t-ask-don-t-tell-could-be-gone-by-September|title=Pentagon: 'Don't ask, don't tell' could be gone by September|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|author=Anna Mulrine|date=April 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Obama_Signed"&gt;{{cite news|author=Sheryl Gay Stolberg|title=With Obama's Signature, 'Don't Ask' Is Repealed|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 22, 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/23/us/politics/23military.html|accessdate=December 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2011, military leaders began issuing training plans for the expected repeal of the ban.&lt;ref name="chsc-2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="us-wapo-2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/13/AR2011021302780.html|title=Ending 'don't ask, don't tell' doesn't end problems facing gay service members|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=February 13, 2011|first=Ed|last=O'Keefe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="us-yahoo-2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_gays_in_military|title=Navy set training for don't ask, don't tell repeal|work=[[Yahoo!

One year after repeal, a study published by the [[Palm Center]] found that openly gay service has not resulted in a negative net impact to the U.S. military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hispanicbusiness.com/2012/9/20/military_allowing_gays_to_serve_works.htm|title=Military: Allowing Gays to Serve Works|publisher=Hispanic Business|date=2012-09-20|accessdate=2013-11-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112135258/http://www.hispanicbusiness.com/2012/9/20/military_allowing_gays_to_serve_works.htm|archivedate=2013-11-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Per the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in ''[[United States v. Windsor]]'', lawful same-sex spouses are afforded the same rights as heterosexual spouses.

[[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] regulations banning [[transgender]] persons from U.S. military service were repealed on June 30, 2016.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/25/us-military-to-repeal-ban-transgender-personnel|title=US military to repeal ban on openly transgender personnel|journal=The Guardian|first=|last=Reuters|date=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uruguay===
Homosexuals were prohibited from serving in the Uruguayan armed forces under the 1973–1985 military dictatorship, however this prohibition was lifted in 2009 when a new decree was signed by Defence Minister Jose Bayardi which provided that sexual orientation would no longer be considered a reason to prevent people from entering the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;Huffington Post: [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/05/13/uruguay-to-lift-ban-on-ga_n_203004.html Uruguay To Lift Ban On Gays In The Military], 14 May 2009,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2009-05-18|accessdate=2009-10-10|work=[[Pink News]]|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-12486.html|title=Uruguay lifts military gay ban}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countries with ambiguous policies==

===Mexico===
The [[Mexican Armed Forces]]' policy on sexual orientation is ambiguous, leaving homosexual soldiers in a "legal limbo". Officially, there is no law or policy preventing homosexuals from serving, and applicants are not questioned on the subject. In practice, however, outed homosexual soldiers are subject to severe harassment and are often discharged. One directive, issued in 2003, described actions "''en contra de la moral o de las buenas costumbres dentro y fuera del servicio'' [sic]" ("contrary to morality or good manners on- and off-duty") as serious misconduct warranting disciplinary action. Other references to morality are found throughout military documents, leaving room for interpretation with regards to sexual orientation. Although there is no clear position from current military leadership, several retired generals have agreed that homosexual soldiers were usually removed from service either through an encouraged withdrawal or dishonorable discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msemanal.com/node/3117|title=Homosexualidad y Ejército|trans-title=Homosexuality and the Military|language=Spanish|date=October 17, 2010|work=M Semanal|publisher=''[[Milenio]]''|author=Medellín, Jorge Alejandro}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bilerico.com/2011/10/gay_in_mexico_a_cautious_quinceanera.php|title=Gay in Mexico: A Cautious Quinceañera|work=The Bilerico Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===
[[LGBT rights in South Korea|Civil rights for homosexual citizens]] are guaranteed in South Korea under the Korean Human Rights Committee Law, but in practice homosexuals may still face discrimination during military service, which is [[conscription in South Korea|mandatory for all male citizens]]. Conscripts are profiled at the time of enlistment and homosexuals may be categorized as having a "mental handicap" or "personality disorder", which may lead to a dishonourable discharge.

Article 92 of the Military Penal Code categorizes sexual relations between members of the same sex as "sexual harassment", regardless of whether it is consensual. Consensual sex between homosexuals may be regarded as "reciprocal rape", punishable by up to a year's imprisonment for both parties. These laws and practices have faced legal challenges during recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/news/daily-news/2011/03/31/korea-upholds-antigay-military-law|title=Korea Upholds Antigay Military Law|work=Advocate.com|date=2011-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Stalin's Bunker''' ({{lang-rus|Бункер Сталина}}) is an [[air raid shelter]] located near Samara State University of Culture in [[Samara]] (former Kuybyshev), [[Russia]]. It is a subterranean [[bunker]] complex constructed between February and October 1942. It was the alternative Supreme High Command General Headquarters of the [[Soviet Armed Forces]]  intended for [[Joseph Stalin]] during [[World War II]]. The Stalin's Bunker is located 37 metres beneath the Kuybyshev [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]] oblast Committee building (now Samara State University of Culture occupies it), 100 metres south-east of the Samara Academy Theater. The Stalin's Bunker was declassified in 1990. Now the civil defence museum occupies the former air raid shelter. The air-raid shelters for the Soviet High Command was built also in [[Yaroslavl]], Gorky (now [[Nizhny Novgorod]]), [[Kazan]], [[Ulyanovsk]], [[Saratov]] and Stalingrad (now [[Volgograd]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soldat.ru/doc/gko/text/0945.html] Государственный Комитет Обороны 
Постановление № ГКО-945сс "О новых формированиях"&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== History == 
During World War II, Kuybyshev was chosen to be the alternative capital of the [[Soviet Union]] should [[Moscow]] fall to the invading [[Nazi Germany|Germans]]. In October 1941, the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] and governmental organizations, diplomatic missions of foreign countries, leading cultural establishments and their staff were evacuated to the city&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Nagorski: ''The Greatest Battle'', 2007, pp. 165–166&lt;/ref&gt;. 

On 15 October 1941 the [[State Defense Committee]] produced a secret decision No 801 "On evacuation of the Soviet capital Moscow to Kuybyshev". Evacuation of Stalin was envisaged in case of emergency. 21 October 1941 the State Defense Committee produced a secret decision No 826 "On construction of the air raid shelter in Kuybyshev". The Stalin's Bunker was designed by Chief Technology Officer Yulian Ostrovsky and main architect M. Zelenin. They copied construction of [[Aeroport (Moscow Metro)|Aeroport]] [[Moscow Metro]] station. Subway tunnelers from Moscow and [[Donbass]] miners were deployed for the construction of the bunker works. 2900 workers and 800 engineers took part in the construction. Mine-surveying work was steered by I. Drobinin. All builders were under a lifelong gag order. Soil withdrawal was carried out at night. 25,000 cubic meters of soil was recovered in 8 months. 5,000 cubic meters of concrete have been used in the construction. The Stalin's Bunker was put in the operation by government commission on 6th January 1943&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://gosamara.ru/ru/node/683|title = Бункер Сталина|publisher = Самарская область. Справочник туриста|accessdate = 2018-03-25|language = ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Joseph Stalin's daughter [[Svetlana Alliluyeva|Svetlana]] was sheltered in the bunker during the air strikes. If Stalin ever visited the bunker, it was not documented.

== Description ==
The Stalin's Bunker can take a hit from a 2000-kilo demolition bomb easily. 23 meters of earth cover, 4 meters of concrete and layer of sand  grant protection against enemy air raids. The bunker has a power station and a stand-alone system of air regeneration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.museum.ru/M2553|title = Бункер И. В.

After descending the stairs into the lower section and passing through the steel door, there is a long corridor. On the right side is Stalin's accommodation. On the left side is convention hall. Several floors up, there's  a series of rooms which include generator/ventilation/accumulator/elevator motor/pump rooms and the telephone switchboard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =https://www.bunkerstalina.com/history|title = Схематичный разрез|publisher = Бункер Сталина|accessdate = 2018-03-25|language = ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:SustiNet Logo.png|thumb|Logo of SustiNet]]
{{Healthcare in the United States}}
'''SustiNet''' is a [[Connecticut]] health care plan passed into law in July, 2009.&lt;ref name =AARP&gt;http://www.aarp.org/states/ct/advocacy/articles/in_historic_vote_legislature_overrides_sustinet_veto.html&lt;/ref&gt; Its goal is to provide affordable health care coverage to 98% of Connecticut residents by 2014.&lt;ref name=AARP/&gt; The name SustiNet derives from the [[Seal of Connecticut|motto]] of the State of Connecticut: "Qui transtulit sustinet." (Latin: "[He] Who Transplanted [Still] Sustains").

==Provisions==
The SustiNet law established a nine-member board to recommend to the legislature, by January 1, 2011, the details of and implementation process for a [[self-insured]] health care plan called SustiNet. The recommendations will address (1) the phased-in offering of the SustiNet plan to state employees and retirees, HUSKY A and B [[beneficiaries]], people without employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) or with unaffordable ESI, small and large employers, and others; (2) establishing an entity that can contract with insurers and health care providers, set [[reimbursement]] rates, develop [[medical home]]s for patients, and encourage the use of [[health information technology]]; (3) a model benefits package; and (4) public outreach and ways to identify [[uninsured]] citizens.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Connecticut General Assembly, Office of Legislative Research, "OLR Acts Affecting Insurance," July 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

SustiNet emphasizes [[preventive care]] and the management of [[chronic illness]]es.  It creates a large health insurance pool by combining state employees, retirees, and people covered by state assistance programs.  The pool will also be open to members of the public without insurance, those with inadequate insurance, and employers, starting with [[small businesses]], [[nonprofit]]s and [[municipalities]].  Eventually, SustiNet will be open to larger employers wishing to buy into the plan for their employees.

The board establishes committees to make recommendations to it about health information technology, medical homes, clinical care and safety guidelines, and preventive care and improved health outcomes. The act also establishes an independent information clearinghouse to inform employers, consumers, and the public about SustiNet and private health care plans and creates task forces to address [[obesity]], [[tobacco]] usage, and health care [[workforce]] issues. The effective date of the SustiNet law was July 1, 2009 for most provisions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==History==
Since 2005, [[Universal Health Care Foundation of Connecticut]] has developed relationships with several key groups that would be instrumental in creating broad change in the [[health system]], including medical societies, [[hospitals]], businesses, labor and clergy.&lt;ref&gt;''Hartford Courant'', "Connecticut Clergy Pressuring State To Approve Health Insurance Plan", March 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2009, the foundation unveiled SustiNet, a proposal for a statewide health care plan for Connecticut that would provide residents with their choice of health coverage and care regardless of their employment status, age, or [[pre-existing conditions]].&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', "Hartford Hears Health Care Proposal", January 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  An estimated 1,000 people attended a rally at [[Union Station (Hartford)]] for the release of the plan.&lt;ref&gt;Fairfield County Business Journal, "Health care options proliferate", January 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In February, the 18,500-member Connecticut Association of Realtors announced its support for the SustiNet health care plan.  Realtors are [[independent contractors]] and are representative of the plight of many independent contractors and small business employees in Connecticut in that they do not have access to group health insurance.&lt;ref&gt;''Enfield Press'', "Realtors' Association endorses heallth care proposal", February 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Also in that month, the independent statewide organization "Small Businesses for Health Care Reform" endorsed the SustiNet health care reform proposal and encouraged other business owners to review and support it.&lt;ref&gt;''Record Journal'', "Universal Health Care Plan Gains Steam", February 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009, the foundation's SustiNet plan was formally endorsed by the Interfaith Fellowship for Universal Health Care, a group devoted to health reform, as well as by dozens of other religious leaders representing a wide range of faiths in Connecticut. Fellowship members include Rabbi Stephen Fuchs of [[Congregation Beth Israel (West Hartford, Connecticut)|Congregation Beth Israel]] in [[West Hartford]], a co-chairman of the Interfaith Fellowship, and Bilal Ansari, a Muslim chaplain at [[Saint Francis Hospital &amp; Medical Center]] in [[Hartford]], where much of his counseling involves helping families cope with not just the stress of a relative's illness, but the worries about how they will pay for it.&lt;ref&gt;''Hartford Courant'', "Foundation Presents Plan To Provide Universal Health Coverage", January 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

SustiNet passed its first legislative hurdle Thursday, March 26, receiving an endorsement from the state legislature's Public Health Committee.

'''''The Gene Revolution: GM Crops and Unequal Development''''' is a 2006 book by Professor [[Sakiko Fukuda-Parr]].
 
While some people do not support [[genetic manipulation]] (GM), others view it as an important technological solution to limited agricultural output, increasing populations, and [[climate change]]. The book provides a detailed analysis of debate about GM adoption in [[developing countries]], which are dealing with poverty and trying to better compete in the global economy.&lt;ref name=GM_crop&gt;{{cite book | last = Fukuda-Parr | first = Sakiko | title = The gene revolution GM crops and unequal development | publisher = Earthscan | location = London Sterlling, VA | year = 2007 | isbn = 9781844074105 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://belfercenter.hks.harvard.edu/publication/1998/gene_revolution.html|title=The Gene Revolution: GM Crops and Unequal Development|publisher=Belfer Center, Harvard University|date=December 2006|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.new-ag.info/07/03/books.php|title=Book review: The gene revolution: GM crops and unequal development|date=May 2007|publisher=New Agriculturist|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/62297/2/JAB%2cFall07%2c%2307%2cpp215-217.pdf|title=BOOK REVIEW: Sakiko Fukuda-Parr, ed., The Gene Revolution: GM Crops and Unequal Development|last=Bernard|first=John C.|date=Fall 2007|publisher=Journal of Agribusiness|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|the 1984 book on the Arab–Israeli conflict|From Time Immemorial}}
{{wiktionary|time immemorial}}
'''Time immemorial''' ({{lang-fr|temps immémorial}}) is a phrase meaning time extending beyond the reach of [[memory]], [[Recorded history|record]], or [[tradition]], [[wikt:indefinitely|indefinitely]] [[ancient]], "ancient beyond memory or record".&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary (1971 ed.), Vol. I, p. 63c&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[law]], it means that a [[property]] or [[legal benefit|benefit]] has been enjoyed for so long that its owner does not have to prove how they came to own it. In [[English law]] and its derivatives, "time immemorial" means the same as "time out of mind",&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone (1765) ''Commentary'' I viii 281&lt;/ref&gt; "a time before legal history and beyond legal memory".&lt;ref&gt;The [[public domain]] Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary (1913)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1275, by the first [[Statute of Westminster 1275|Statute of Westminster]], the time of memory was limited to the reign of [[Richard I of England|King Richard I]], beginning 6 July 1189, the date of the king's [[accession day|accession]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1517436 Statute of Westminster, The First] (3 Edw. I cap. 5)&lt;/ref&gt; Since that date, proof of unbroken possession or use of any right made it unnecessary to establish the original grant under certain circumstances.

The [[Prescription Act 1832]], which noted that the full expression was "time immemorial, or time whereof the memory of man runneth not to the contrary",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Will4/2-3/71&lt;/ref&gt; replaced the common law burden of proving "time immemorial" for the enjoyment of particular land rights with statutory fixed time periods of up to 60 years.

'''UMAR''', an [[acronym]] which stands for Alternative and Answer Women's Union in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (''União de Mulheres Alternativa e Resposta''), is a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[women's rights]] organization founded in 1976.

From 1976 to 1989, the acronym originally stood for Antifascist and Revolutionary Women's Union (''União de Mulheres Antifascistas e Revolucionárias''). In 1989, the organization changed its name to Movement for the Social Emancipation of the Portuguese Women (''Movimento para a Emancipação Social das Mulheres Portuguesas'') and again, in 1999, to the name it currently holds.

The organization was founded by members of the [[Far-left politics|far-left]] party [[People's Democratic Union (Portugal)|People's Democratic Union]] (nowadays part of the [[Left Bloc]]), but was always completely autonomous from the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.publico.pt/2016/09/12/sociedade/noticia/neoconservadorismo-pode-fazer-recuar-conquistas-diz-manuela-tavares-1743562|title=A conquista dos direitos das mulheres nunca é definitiva|last=Almeida|first=São José|date=12 September 2016|work=Público|access-date=25 June 2018|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.umarfeminismos.org/index.php/quemsomos|title=Quem Somos|website=UMAR|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925050403/http://www.umarfeminismos.org/index.php/quemsomos|archive-date=25 September 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United Student Aid Funds''' or '''USA Funds,''' now known as the '''Strada Education Network'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stradaeducation.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt;, is a [[nonprofit]] [[corporation]] that works to enhance postsecondary-education preparedness, access and success by providing and supporting financial and other valued services. USA Funds links colleges, universities, proprietary schools, private lenders, students and parents to promote financial access to higher learning.

Established by [[Richard Cornuelle]]&lt;ref&gt;Harris, T. George. 1964. "A New Conservative Manifesto." Look 28(26): 19-23. December 29. Page 21.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Indianapolis]] in 1960 to help families finance rising college costs, USA Funds has grown to become the nation's largest guarantor of loans made under the [[Federal Family Education Loan Program]] (FFELP), the largest federal source of [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial aid]] for [[higher education]]. During the past 44 years, the USA Funds guarantee has supported a total of nearly $115.5 billion in financial aid for higher education. USA Funds has served more than 13.6 million students and parents. SMS Hawaii, the nonprofit student-loan secondary market for [[Hawaii]], is an affiliate of USA Funds. Another USA Funds affiliate, Northwest Education Loan Association, is a nonprofit guarantor that serves the Pacific Northwest. NELA is the designated guarantor for the states of [[Idaho]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. USA Funds guarantees [[Stafford loan|education loans]] for students and parents throughout the nation. In addition, USA Funds serves as the designated guarantor of federal education loans in eight states: [[Arizona]], Hawaii and the Pacific Islands, [[Indiana]], [[Kansas]], [[Maryland]], [[Mississippi]], [[Nevada]] and [[Wyoming]].  The [[Thurgood Marshall College Fund]], aiding public [[historically black colleges and universities]] is an affiliate of the Strada Education Network.

==Affiliation with Sallie Mae==
USA Funds contracts with affiliates of [[Sallie Mae]], the leading guarantor-servicing organization, to deliver some of the services necessary to support USA Funds’ guarantee.

Before July 31, 2000, USA Funds was an affiliate of USA Group. USA Funds contracted with other USA Group affiliates to these lenders contract with Sallie Mae for servicing and loan acquisition; others have no contractual relationships with Sallie Mae. Postsecondary institutions, their students, and parents are free to choose the lenders with which they wish to work while using the USA Funds guarantee.

'''''Who Killed the Electric Car?''''' is a [[2006 in film|2006]] [[documentary film]] that explores the creation, limited commercialization, and subsequent destruction of the [[battery electric vehicle]] in the [[United States]], specifically the [[General Motors EV1]] of the mid-1990s. The film explores the roles of [[automobile manufacturer]]s, the [[petroleum industry|oil industry]], the [[federal government of the United States]], the [[Government of California|California government]], [[electric battery|batteries]], [[hydrogen vehicle]]s, and [[consumer]]s in limiting the development and adoption of this technology.

After a premiere at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], it was released theatrically by [[Sony Pictures Classics]] in June, 2006 and then on [[DVD]] by [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] on November 14, 2006.

During an interview with [[CBS News]], director [[Chris Paine]] announced that he had started a new documentary about electric cars with a working title of ''Who Saved the Electric Car?'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/09/06/sunday/main3239838.shtml

==Topics addressed==
The film deals with the history of the electric car, its modern development, and commercialization. The film focuses primarily on the [[General Motors EV1]], which was made available for [[lease]] mainly in [[Southern California]], after the [[California Air Resources Board]] (CARB) passed the [[zero-emissions vehicle]] (ZEV)  mandate in 1990 which required the seven major automobile suppliers in the United States to offer electric vehicles in order to continue sales of their gasoline powered vehicles in California. Nearly 5000 electric cars were designed and manufactured by [[Chrysler]], the [[Ford Motor Company]], [[General Motors]] (GM), [[Honda]], [[Nissan]], and [[Toyota]]; and then later destroyed or donated to museums and educational institutions. Also discussed are the implications of the events depicted for [[air pollution]], [[oil dependency]], [[Middle East]] politics, and [[global warming]].

The film details the [[California Air Resources Board]]'s reversal of the mandate after relentless pressure and suits from [[automobile manufacturer]]s, continual pressure from the [[oil industry]], orchestrated hype over a future [[Hydrogen vehicle|hydrogen car]], and finally the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]].

A portion of the film details GM's efforts to demonstrate to California that there was no consumer [[demand]] for their product, and then to take back every EV1 and destroy them. A few were disabled and given to museums and universities, but almost all were found to have been crushed. GM never responded to the EV drivers' offer to pay the residual lease value; $1.9 million was offered for the remaining 78 cars in [[Burbank, California]] before they were crushed. Several activists, including actresses [[Alexandra Paul]] and Colette Divine, were arrested in the protest that attempted to block the GM car carriers taking the remaining EV1s off to be crushed.

The film explores some of the motives that may have pushed the auto and oil industries to kill off the electric car. [[Wally Rippel]] offers, for example, that the oil companies were afraid of losing their [[monopoly]] on transportation fuel over the coming decades; while the auto companies feared short-term costs for EV development and long-term revenue loss because EVs require little maintenance and no tuneups.  Others explained the killing differently. GM spokesman Dave Barthmuss argued it was lack of consumer interest due to the maximum range of 80–100 miles per charge, and the relatively high price.

The film also showed the failed attempts by electric car enthusiasts trying to combat auto industry moves, and save the surviving vehicles. Towards the end of the film, a deactivated EV1 car #99 is found in the garage of [[Petersen Automotive Museum]], with former EV sales representative, [[Chelsea Sexton]], invited for a visit.

The film also explores the future of automobile technologies including a deeply critical look at [[hydrogen vehicle]]s, an upbeat discussion of [[plug-in hybrid]]s, and examples of other developing EV technologies such as the [[Tesla Roadster (2008)]], released on the market two years after the film.

==Interviews==
The film features interviews with celebrities who drove the electric car, such as [[Ed Begley Jr.]], [[Mel Gibson]], [[Tom Hanks]], [[Peter Horton]], and [[Alexandra Paul]]. It also features interviews with a selection of prominent American political figures including Jim Boyd, [[S. David Freeman]], [[Frank Gaffney]], Alan C. Lloyd (Chairman of the [[California Air Resources Board]]), [[Alan Lowenthal]], and [[Ralph Nader]]. Included are interviews with [[Edward H. Murphy]] (representative of the [[American Petroleum Institute]]), and [[R. James Woolsey Jr.|James Woolsey]] (former [[Director of Central Intelligence]]), as well as news footage from the development, launch and marketing of EVs.

The film also features interviews with some of the engineers and technicians who led the development of modern [[electric vehicles]] and related technologies, such as [[Wally Rippel]], [[Chelsea Sexton]], [[Tesla, Inc.|Alec Brooks]], [[AC Propulsion|Alan Cocconi]], [[Paul MacCready]], [[Stanford R. Ovshinsky|Stan]] and [[Iris M. Ovshinsky]], and other experts such as [[Joseph J. Romm]] (author of ''[[Hell and High Water (book)|Hell and High Water]]'' and ''[[The Hype about Hydrogen]]''). Romm gives a presentation intended to show that the government's "hydrogen car initiative" is a bad policy choice and a distraction that is delaying the exploitation of more promising technologies, such as electric and [[PHEV|hybrid cars]] which could reduce [[greenhouse gas emissions]] and increase America's [[energy security]]. Also featured in the film are spokespersons for the automakers, such as GM's Dave Barthmuss, a vocal opponent of the film and the [[General Motors EV1|EV1]], and Bill Reinert from [[Toyota]].

==Production and release==
The film was written and directed by [[Chris Paine]], and produced by [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2100637/ Jessie Deeter], and executive produced by [[Tavin Marin Titus]], [[Richard D. Titus]] of Plinyminor and [[Dean Devlin]], Kearie Peak, Mark Roskin, and Rachel Olshan of [[Electric Entertainment]].

The film features a film score composed by [[Michael Brook]]. It also features music by [[Joe Walsh]], DJ Harry and [[Meeky Rosie]]. Jeff Steele, Kathy Weiss, Natalie Artin and [[Alex Gibney]] were also part of the producing team.

The documentary was featured at the [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]], [[San Francisco International Film Festival|San Francisco]], [[Tribeca Film Festival|Tribeca]], [[LA Film Festival|Los Angeles]], [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin]], [[Deauville American Film Festival|Deauville]], and Wild and Scenic Environmental [[film festival]]s and was released in [[Movie theater|theaters]] worldwide in June 2006.

==The suspects==
[[File:EV1 funeral DSCN8571.jpg|thumb|The film features the symbolic EV1 funeral held at [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]] as a protest to [[General Motors]]' decision to terminate all EV1 leases and crush the electric cars.]]
The later portion of the film is organized around the following hypothesized culprits in the downfall of the electric car:

===American consumers===
While few American consumers ever heard of the electric cars in California, those who did were not necessarily critical mass for this new technology. Thanks to lower gas prices and infatuation with [[sport utility vehicle]]s (SUVs), few people sought out this new technology. While some were fans (as chronicled in the film), many more needed time to consider the advantages and disadvantages of these new cars; whether freedom from oil or with the perceived limitations of a city car with a 100-mile range.  Although allegations are made about consumers by industry representatives in the film, perhaps explaining the film's "guilty" verdict, the actual consumers interviewed in the film were either unaware that an electric car was ever available to try, or dismayed that they could no longer obtain one.

===Batteries===
In a bit of an unexpected turn, the film's sole "not-guilty" suspect is batteries, one of the chief culprits if one were to ask the oil or auto industries. At the time GM's EV1 came to market, it came with a lead acid battery with a range of 60 miles. The film suggests that since the average driving distance of Americans in a day is 30 miles or less, for 90% of Americans, electric cars would work as a daily commute car or second car.

The second generation EV1 (and those released by Honda, Toyota, and others) from 1998 to the end of the program, featured nickel-metal-hydride or even lithium-ion (Nissan) batteries with a range of 100 or more miles. The film documents that the company which had supplied batteries for EV1, [[Energy Conversion Devices|Ovonics]], had been suppressed from announcing improved batteries, with double the range, lest CARB be convinced that batteries were improving. Later, General Motors sold the supplier's majority control share to the [[Chevron Corporation]] and [[Cobasys]].

As part of the not-guilty verdict, the famed engineer Alan Cocconi explains that with laptop computer lithium ion batteries, the EV1 could have been upgraded to a range of 300 miles per charge. He makes this point in front of his T-Zero prototype, the car that inspired the [[Tesla Roadster (2008)]].

===Oil companies===
The oil industry, through its major lobby group the [[Western States Petroleum Association]], is brought to task for financing campaigns to kill utility efforts to build public car charging stations. Through [[astroturfing]] groups like "Californians Against Utility Abuse" they posed as consumers instead of the industry interests they actually represented.

[[Mobil]] and other oil companies are also shown to be advertising directly against electric cars in national publications, even when electric cars seem to have little to do with their core business.  At the end of the film, Chevron [[Patent encumbrance of large automotive NiMH batteries|bought patents]] and controlling interest in Ovonics, the advanced battery company featured in the film. Ostensibly to prevent modern NiMH batteries from being used in non-hybrid electric cars.

The documentary also refers to manipulation of oil prices by overseas suppliers in the 1980s as an example of the industry working to kill competition and keep customers from moving toward alternatives to oil.

===Car companies===

[[File:Ev1 crush5.jpg|thumb|Crushed [[EV1]]s in a junk yard are shown in the film]]
With GM as its primary example, the film documents that car makers engaged in both positive and negative marketing of the electric car as its intentions toward the car and California legislation changed.  In earlier days, GM ran [[Super Bowl commercials]] produced by [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] (ILM) for the EV1. In later days it ran "award winning" doomsday-style advertising featuring the EV1 and ran customer surveys which emphasized drawbacks to electronic vehicle technology which were not actually present in the EV1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last = Welch| first = David|title = The Eco-Cars| newspaper = BusinessWeek|date = August 14, 2000| url = http://www.businessweek.com/archives/2000/b3694130.arc.htm| accessdate = March 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (As a side note, CARB officials were quoted claiming that they removed their zero emission vehicle quotas in part because they gave weight to such surveys purportedly showing no demand existing for the EV1s.) Other charges raised on GM included sabotaging their own product program, failing to produce cars to meet existing demand, and refusing to sell cars directly (it only leased them).

The film also describes the history of automaker efforts to destroy competing technologies, such as their destruction through front companies of public transit systems in the United States in the early 20th century. In addition to EV1, the film also depicted how [[Toyota RAV4 EV]], and [[Honda EV Plus]] were being cancelled by their respective car companies. The crushing of Honda EV Plus only gained attention after appearing quite by accident on an episode of PBS's ''[[California's Gold]]'' with [[Huell Howser]].

In an interview with retired GM board member Tom Everhart, the film points out that GM killed the EV1 to focus on more immediately profitable enterprises such as its [[Hummer]] and truck brands, instead of preparing for future challenges. Ralph Nader, in a brief appearance, points out that auto makers usually only respond to government regulation when it comes to important advances whether seat belts, airbags, catalytic converters, mileage requirements or, by implication, hybrid/electric cars. The film suggests Toyota supported the production of [[Toyota Prius]] hybrid in part as a response to [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles]] and other U.S. Government pressure that was later dropped.

Though GM cited cost as a deterrent to continuing with the EV1, the film interviewed critics contending that the cost of batteries and electric vehicles would have been reduced significantly if mass production began, due to [[economies of scale]]. There is also discussion about electric cars threatening dealer profits since they have so few service requirements—no tuneups, no oil changes, and less brake jobs because of regenerative braking.

===U.S. government===
While not overtly political, the film documents that the [[federal government of the United States]] under the [[Presidency of George W. Bush]] joined the auto-industry suit against California in 2002. This pushed California to abandon its ZEV mandate regulation. The film notes that Bush's chief of staff [[Andrew Card]] had recently been head of the American Automobile Manufacturers Alliance in California and then joined the White House with [[Dick Cheney]], [[Condoleezza Rice]], and other federal officials who were former executives or board members of oil and auto companies. By failing to increase mileage standards in a meaningful way since the 1970s and now interfering in California, the federal government had again served short-term industry interests at the expense of long-range leadership on issues of oil dependency and cleaner cars.

===California Air Resources Board===
In 2003, the [[California Air Resources Board]] (CARB), headed by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] Alan Lloyd, finally caved to industry pressure and drastically scaled back the ZEV mandate. CARB had previously defended the regulation for more than 12 years.

While championing CARB's efforts on behalf of California's with its 1990 mandate (and other regulations over the years), the film suggests Lloyd may have had a [[conflict of interest]], as the director of the [[California Fuel Cell Partnership]]. The ZEV change allowed a marginal amount of hydrogen fuel cell cars to be produced in the future, versus the immediate continued growth of its electric car requirement.  Footage shot in the meetings showed Lloyd shutting down battery electric car proponents while giving the car makers all the time they wanted to make their points.

===Hydrogen fuel cell===
The [[fuel cell|hydrogen fuel cell]] was presented by the film as an alternative that distracts attention from the real and immediate potential of electric vehicles to an unlikely future possibility embraced by auto makers, oil companies and a pro-business administration in order to buy time and profits for the status quo. The film corroborates the claim that hydrogen vehicles are a mere distraction by stating that "A fuel cell car powered by hydrogen made with electricity uses three to four times more energy than a car powered by batteries" and by interviewing [[Joseph J. Romm]], the author of ''[[The Hype about Hydrogen]]'', who lists five problems he sees with hydrogen vehicles: High cost, limits on driving range due to current materials, high costs of hydrogen fuel, the need for entirely new fueling compounds, and competition from other technologies in the marketplace, such as hybrids.

The price of Hydrogen has since come down to $4–6/kg (without carbon sequestering) due to reduction in the price of Natural Gas as a feedstock for steam reforming owing to the proliferation of hydraulic fracturing of shales.&lt;ref name="designnews.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.designnews.com/document.asp?doc_id=227741&amp;dfpPParams=aid_227741&amp;dfpLayout=article |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413140759/http://www.designnews.com/document.asp?doc_id=227741&amp;dfpPParams=aid_227741&amp;dfpLayout=article |archivedate=2014-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A kilo of Hydrogen has the same energy yield as a gallon of gasoline although production currently creates 12.5&amp;nbsp;kg CO2, 39% more than the 8.91&amp;nbsp;kg CO2 from a gasoline gallon.&lt;ref name="designnews.com"/&gt;

==Response from General Motors==
[[General Motors]] (GM) responded in a 2006 blog post titled "Who Ignored the Facts About the Electric Car?"&lt;ref name=pdfcopy&gt;[http://www.altfuels.org/misc/onlygm.pdf ''Who Ignored the Facts About the Electric Car?'' blog post copy in PDF format]&lt;/ref&gt; written by Dave Barthmuss of GM's communications department. In his June 15, 2006 post—published 13 days before the film was released in the U.S.—Barthmuss claims not to have seen the film, but believes "there may be some information that the movie did not tell its viewers." He repeats GM's claims that, "despite the substantial investment of money and the enthusiastic fervor of a relatively small number of EV1 drivers — including the filmmaker — the EV1 proved far from a viable commercial success."

He submits it is "good news for electric car enthusiasts" that electric vehicle technology since the EV1 was still being used. It was used in [[Global Hybrid Cooperation|two-mode hybrid]], [[plug-in hybrid]], and [[fuel cell vehicle]] programs.

Barthmuss also cites "GM's leadership" in flex-fuel vehicles development, hydrogen fuel cell technology, and their new "active fuel management" system which improve fuel economy, as reasons they feel they are "doing more than any other automaker to address the issues of oil dependence, fuel economy and emissions from vehicles."

Responding to the film's harsh criticisms for discontinuing the EV1, Barthmuss outlines GM's reasons for doing so, implying that GM did so due to inadequate support from parts suppliers, as well as poor consumer demand despite "significant sums (spent) on marketing and incentives to develop a mass market for it." Barthmuss claimed he personally regretted the way the decision not to sell the EV1s was handled, but stated it was because GM would no longer be able to repair it or "guarantee it could be operated safely over the long term," with lack of available parts making "future repair and safety of the vehicles difficult to nearly impossible." He also claimed that "no other major automotive manufacturer is producing a pure electric vehicle for use on public roads and highways."

In March 2009, however, outgoing CEO of GM [[Rick Wagoner]] said the biggest mistake he ever made as chief executive was killing the EV1 car and failing to direct more resources to electrics and hybrids after such an early lead in this technology.&lt;ref&gt;Neil, Dan. [http://articles.latimes.com/2009/mar/31/business/fi-gm-cars31 "The Rick Wagoner vehicles: Hits and misses"], ''[[LA Times]]'', March 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; GM has since championed its electric-car expertise as a key factor in development of its 2010 [[Chevrolet Volt]], Chevy Spark EV, and the [[Chevrolet Bolt]].

==Reception==
The [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported an 88% approval rating among 104 critics polled.&lt;ref&gt;[url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/who_killed_the_electric_car/ ''Who Killed the Electric Car?''], [[Rotten Tomatoes]], accessed December 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]], another review collator, reported a positive rating of 70, based on 28 reviews polled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/whokilledtheelectriccar?q=who%20killed%20the%20electric%20car MetaCritic review]&lt;/ref&gt;

Manohla Dargis of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "It's a story Mr. Paine tells with bite. In 1996 a Los Angeles newspaper reported that 'the air board grew doubtful about the willingness of consumers to accept the cars, which carry steep price tags and have a limited travel range.' Mr. Paine pushes beyond this ostensibly disinterested report, suggesting that one reason the board might have grown doubtful was because its chairman at the time, Alan C. Lloyd, had joined the California Fuel Cell Partnership."&lt;ref&gt;Dargis, Manohla. [http://movies.nytimes.com/2006/06/28/movies/28kill.html "'Who Killed the Electric Car?': Some Big Reasons the Electric Car Can't Cross the Road"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Rechtshaffen of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' noted Alan Lloyd's conflict of interest in the film.&lt;ref&gt;Rechtshaffen, Michael. [http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/reviews/review_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002729006 Hollywood Reporter Review], ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060710160519/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/reviews/review_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002729006 |date=July 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pete Vonder Haar of [[Film Threat]] commented, "Boasting a particularly articulate and colorful bunch of noncelebrity talking heads, including former president [[Jimmy Carter]], energy adviser [[S. David Freeman]] and Bill Reinert, the straight-shooting national manager of advanced technologies for Toyota who doesn't exactly sing the praises of the much-touted hydrogen fuel cell, the lively film maintains its challenging pace."&lt;ref&gt;Vonder Haar, Pete. [http://www.filmthreat.com/index.php?section=reviews&amp;Id=8463 "WHO KILLED THE ELECTRIC CAR?"] Film Threat, January 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Matt Coker of ''OC Weekly'' stated, "Like most documentaries, 'Who Killed the Electric Car?' works best when it sticks to the facts. Showing us the details about the California Air Resources Board caving in to the automakers and repealing their 1990 Zero Emissions Mandate, for example, is much more effective than coverage of some goofy mock funeral for the EV1 with Ed Begley Jr. providing the eulogy. As most of the lazy media, prodded by the shameless oil men in the White House, spin their wheels over false 'solutions' like hybrids and biodiesel and hydrogen and ethanol and [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge#Drilling|ANWR]], Korthof and his all-electric army continue to boost EV technology." Coker also interviewed EV activist Doug Korthof, who stated, "We don't deserve the catastrophe in Iraq, and the two madmen arguing over oil supply lines seem intent on martyrdom for Iraq in a widening war. With EV, we need not get involved in seizing and defending the oil supplies of the Mideast; nor need we maintain fleets, bomb and incarcerate people we can't stand, give foreign aid to oily dictators, and so on. It's not anything to laugh about."&lt;ref&gt;Coker, Matt. [http://www.ocweekly.com/2006-05-18/web/baby-you-can-still-drive-my-electric-car/ "Baby You Can Still Drive My Electric Car"], ''OC Weekly'', May 16, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The film won the 2006 MountainFilm in Telluride (Colorado, USA) Special Jury Prize, the Canberra International Film Festival Audience Award, and also nominated for Best Documentary in the 2006 Environmental Media Awards, Best Documentary in Writers Guild of America, 2007 Broadcast Film Critics Association Best Documentary Feature. In 2008 socially conscious musician Tha truth released a song that summarized the film on the CD ''Tha People's Music''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
