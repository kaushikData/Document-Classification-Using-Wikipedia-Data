The '''buran''' in Russian ([[Persian language|Persian]]: ''بوران'', Russian: буран, Italian: ''buriana'') is a wind which blows across [[Iran]], eastern [[Asia]], specifically [[Xinjiang]], [[Siberia]], and [[Kazakhstan]]. Over the [[tundra]], it is also known as ''пурга'', purga. It is a wind of cold air, sometimes very strong, characteristic of the steppes of the Sarmatic plain, to the west of the Urals.

The buran takes two forms: in summer, it is a hot, dry wind, whipping up sandstorms; in winter, it is bitterly cold and often accompanied by blizzards. Winter buran winds are strong and full of ice and snow. The sky is often laden with snow, which swirls about and reduces the visibility to near zero at times. In [[Alaska]] this severe northeasterly wind is known as ''burga'' and brings snow and ice pellets.

The Russian Space Programme has named a class of spacecraft after the buran (see [[Buran programme]]).

The '''Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES)''' is a collaborative research project among national election studies around the world.  Participating countries and polities include a common module of survey questions in their national post-election studies. The resulting data are collated together along with voting, demographic, district and macro variables into one dataset allowing comparative analysis of voting behavior from a multilevel perspective.

The CSES is published as a free, public dataset. The project is administered by the CSES Secretariat, a joint effort between the Institute for Social Research at the [[University of Michigan]] and the [[GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences]] in Germany.

== Aims and content of the study ==

The CSES project was founded in 1994 with two major aims. The first was to promote international collaboration between national election studies. The second was to allow researchers to study variations in political institutions, especially electoral systems, and their effects on individual attitudes and behaviors, especially turnout and vote choice.

CSES datasets contain variables at three levels.  The first is micro-level variables which are answered by respondents during post-election surveys in each included country.  The second is district-level variables which contain election results from the electoral districts that survey respondents are situated in.  The third is macro-level variables containing information about the country context and electoral system, as well as aggregate data such as economic indicators and democracy indices. This nested data structure, as depicted in Figure 1, allows for multilevel analysis.

[[File:Multi-levelDataStructure.png|thumb|Figure 1: Visualization of CSES multilevel data structure]]

A new thematic module is devised by the CSES Planning Committee every five years. Between the final releases of the complete modules, CSES also disseminates advance releases of datasets periodically, which include partial data for modules that have not been fully released yet.

Survey data collection for '''module 1''' was conducted between 1996 and 2001 and focuses on system performance. The module allows investigation of the impact of electoral institutions on citizens’ political cognition and behavior as well as of the nature of political and social cleavages and alignment. Furthermore, it enables research about citizens’ evaluation of democratic institutions and processes. Module 1 includes 39 election studies conducted in 33 countries.

Survey data collection for '''module 2''' was conducted between 2001 and 2006 and focuses on accountability and representation. It addresses the contrast between the view that elections are a mechanism to hold government accountable and the view that they are a means to ensure that citizens’ views and interests are properly represented in the democratic process. Module 2 includes 41 election studies conducted in 38 countries.

Survey data collection for '''module 3''' was conducted between 2006 and 2011. The module allows investigating the meaningfulness of electoral choices and, accordingly, focuses on a major aspect of electoral research: the contingency in choice of available options. Module 3 includes 50 election studies conducted in 41 countries.

Survey data collection for '''module 4''' was conducted between 2011 and 2016 and focuses on distributional politics and social protection. The main topics investigated are voters’ preferences for public policy and the mediating factors of political institutions and voting behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Partial source of text segments about module 1 to module 4: [http://www.gesis.org/en/services/data-analysis/survey-data/rdc-international-survey-programs/cses], accessed June 12, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  Module 4 includes 45 election studies conducted in 39 countries.

Survey data collection for '''module 5''' is conducted between 2016 and 2021 and focuses on the electorate's attitudes towards political elites, on the one hand, and towards "out groups", on the other hand. It thus enables research on attitudes and voting behavior in the context of a rise of parties campaigning on anti-establishment messages and in opposition to "out groups".&lt;ref&gt;Partial source of text segment about module 5: [http://www.csesblog.org/2016/09/announcing-cses-module-5/], accessed June 12, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

A complete table of all variables available across modules can be found on the CSES website.

== Data access ==

CSES data are available publicly and are free of charge. Data releases are non-proprietary – in other words the data are made available to the public without preferential or advance access to anyone. Data is available in multiple formats including for common statistical packages like STATA, SPSS, SAS and R. The data can be downloaded from the CSES website as well as via the GESIS data catalogue. The GESIS online analysis tool ZACAT can furthermore be used to browse and explore the dataset.

==Organizational structure and funding==

===The CSES Secretariat===

In conjunction with national election study collaborators, the CSES Secretariat administers the CSES project. It consists of staff from the [[GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences]] in Germany and the University of Michigan, Ann-Arbor in the United States. The Secretariat is responsible for compiling the final CSES dataset by harmonizing the single country studies into a cross-national dataset. It is also responsible for collecting the district and macro data, for data documentation, and for ensuring data quality. The Secretariat, furthermore, maintains the CSES website, promotes the project, provides support to the user community, and organizes conferences and project meetings.

===The Planning Committee, collaborators and the CSES Plenary===

The CSES research agenda, study design, and questionnaires are developed by an international committee of leading scholars in political science, sociology, and survey methodology. This committee is known as the CSES Planning Committee. At the beginning of each new module a new Planning Committee is established. Nominations for the Planning Committee come from the user community, with membership of the Committee then being approved by the CSES Plenary Meeting. The Plenary Meeting is made up of national collaborators from each national election study involved in the CSES. Ideas for new modules can be submitted by anyone. More information on the current planning committee, its members, and subcommittee reports, as well as on past Planning Committees can be found on the CSES website. A list of country collaborators which participate in CSES can also be found on the CSES website.

===Funding and support===

The work of the CSES Secretariat is funded by the American [[National Science Foundation]], the [[GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences]] and the [[University of Michigan]]’s Center for Political Studies along with in-kind support from participating election studies, additional organizations that sponsor planning meetings and conferences, and the many organizations that fund election studies by CSES collaborators.

==Klingemann Prize==

Each year, the CSES awards the GESIS Klingemann Prize for the best CSES scholarship (paper, book, dissertation, or other scholarly work, broadly defined). The award is sponsored by the [[GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences]] and is named in honor of Professor Dr. Hans-Dieter Klingemann, co-founder of the CSES, an internationally renowned political scientist who made significant contributions to cross-national electoral research. Nominated works must make extensive use of CSES and have a publication date in the calendar year prior to the award, either in print or online.

Some of these angles are .5, 1.45, 2.4, and 3.35 degrees with the Doppler radar having up to 14 angles when it's in Severe Mode. In the Composite, the highest intensities amongst those available in the different angles above each point of the image will be displayed. In the [[Canadian weather radar network]], this is called '''MAXR''', for ''Maximum reflectivity'' in the column.

When compared to the base angle reflectivity, the lowest angle of elevation sounding, the composite reflectivity, including higher elevation scan information, may appear to indicate more widespread rain. This could indicate one of two things:
*[[Virga]]: the precipitation (rain or snow) is probably not reaching the ground but evaporating as it falls from very high in the atmosphere. This is a regular situation in winter as snowflakes can easily [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimate]] in dry air near the ground.
*Strong [[updraft]]s: air rising in a thunderstorm updraft will saturate at higher level than the rest of the cloud forming an overhang region. In case of a very strong updraft, a ''[[Bounded weak echo region]]'' (BWER) will form and lead to the possibility of [[severe weather]].

{{About|the fictional device|other uses|Cone of Silence (disambiguation)}}
[[File:Get Smart-Cone-of-silence.jpg|thumb|right|Cone of Silence from Episode 1 ("[[Mr. Big (Get Smart)|Mr. Big]]", 1965) of ''[[Get Smart]]'']]

The '''Cone of Silence''' is one of many recurring joke devices from ''[[Get Smart]]'', an American [[comedy]] television series of the 1960s about an inept [[spy]].  The essence of the joke is that the apparatus, designed for secret conversations, makes it impossible for those inside the device – and easy for those outside the device – to hear the conversation. The end result being neither secret nor communication.

In popular culture, "cone of silence" is a slang phrase meaning that the speaker wishes to keep the indicated information secret and that the conversation should not be repeated to anyone not currently present. For example: "We aren't inviting Cindy and her boyfriend to the movies because they embarrass us, but keep that in the cone of silence."

==History==

===Precursors===
Although popularized by ''Get Smart'', the term  "Cone of Silence" actually originated on the syndicated TV show ''[[Science Fiction Theatre]]'', in an episode titled "Barrier of Silence" written by Lou Huston and first airing September 3, 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctva.biz/US/SciFi/ScienceFictionTheatre_01_(1955-56).htm|title=CTVA US Sci-Fi – "Science Fiction Theatre" (ZIV/Syndicated) Season 1 (1955–56)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story focuses on finding a cure for Professor Richard Sheldon, who had been returned to the United States in a confused, altered state of mind after abduction by enemy agents while visiting Milan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/science-fiction-theatre/barrier-of-silence-126781/|title=Science Fiction Theatre – Season 1, Episode 19: Barrier of Silence – TV.com|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=TV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists discover that placing Sheldon in an environment of total silence had been the means of [[brainwashing]], a precursor to later ideas of [[sensory deprivation]], celebrated in such films as ''[[Altered States]]'' and sundry spy thrillers. Sheldon is placed on a chair in the "Cone of Silence", which consists of a raised circular platform suspended by three wires tied to a common vertex. Although the cone's surface is open, noise canceling sound generators located just below the vertex shroud anyone sitting inside in a complete silence impossible in natural surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x24z83k_science-fiction-theatre-19-barrier-of-silence_tv|title=''Science Fiction Theatre'' 19 – 'Barrier Of Silence'|work=Dailymotion}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also demonstrated that anyone speaking inside the cone could not be heard outside, which was the feature later [[parody|parodied]] in ''Get Smart''. Only a speculative, "[[science fiction]]" possibility at that time, such technology is now commonplace in [[active noise control|active noise canceling]] electronics for personal and industrial use.

The concept is also explored in [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s 1950 short story "[[Silence Please]]", which features a device capable of cancelling sound waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Silence Please' by Arthur C. Clarke|url=http://alienterritory.wordpress.com/2011/03/27/silence-please-by-arthur-c-clarke/|publisher=Wordpress|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Frank Herbert]]'s science fiction novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]''—first serialized in ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog]]'' from 1963 to 1965 and then published independently in August 1965—the [[Vladimir Harkonnen|Baron Harkonnen]] employs a "[[cone of silence (Dune)|cone of silence]]" when having a private discussion with [[Hasimir Fenring|Count Fenring]]. In the novel's glossary, Herbert describes the device as the sound-deadening "field of a distorter that limits the carrying power of the voice or any other vibrator by damping the vibrations with an image-vibration 180 degrees out of phase".&lt;ref name="Dune Terminology"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Frank Herbert |last=Herbert |first=Frank |year=1965 |title=[[Dune (novel)|Dune]] |chapter=Terminology of the Imperium}}&lt;/ref&gt; Used for privacy, the field does not visually obscure lip movement.&lt;ref name="Dune"&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |year=1965 |title=Dune}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert had previously mentioned the cone of silence, on a much smaller scale, in his 1955 short story "Cease Fire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum%3D90 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824011029/http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=90 |archivedate=2011-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Get Smart''===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
The larger, plastic version of the "Cone of Silence", appeared in the pilot episode of ''Get Smart'', entitled "[[Mr. Big (Get Smart)|Mr. Big]]", which aired on September 18, 1965. [[Mel Brooks]] and [[Buck Henry]], the original [[screenwriter]]s for the series, devised many of the [[running joke]]s. Henry either borrowed or independently came up with the Cone of Silence concept, which debuted in the pilot along with other show standards, like Fang, the improperly trained dog-agent, and Max's shoe phone. The Cone of Silence scene was shot ahead of the rest of the pilot episode, and was used to sell the series to [[NBC]].

Cones of Silence appear in ''[[The Nude Bomb]]'' (1980), the first attempt at a theatrical ''Get Smart'' movie. Max, the Chief, and the delegates all have their own cone placed over them. Neither the characters nor the audience hear what is being said. In the later sequel movie, ''[[Get Smart, Again!]]'' (1989), when Maxwell is reactivated as a secret agent, he insists on following protocol to ensure secrecy by using the Cone of Silence. However, the device is considered to be completely outdated (however Max and 99 still have one at home), and the current methods used were the following:

* Hover Cover: The participants converse on the roof of a building while helicopters hover nearby, drowning out all sounds with their rotor blades, thereby preventing anyone from eavesdropping. However, this also prevents those involved from hearing their own words and the intense winds caused by the helicopter's blades throws the participants about.
* Hall of Hush: A chamber with sound-suppressing walls that allow a person's words to appear in front of him like subtitles in a movie. The problem with this device is that the words do not disappear and will eventually fill up the chamber, smothering the speakers in their own dialogues.

A new version of the Cone of Silence appears in the 2008 ''[[Get Smart (film)|Get Smart]]'' film.  One of the early versions of the Cone used in the television series is on display in the CONTROL museum seen in the beginning of the film. The new version has an appearance more consistent with the cones of silence used in ''The Nude Bomb'' than in the television series. It was apparently constructed by the lab guys Bruce and Lloyd, and was untested at the time it was used. It seems much more high-tech, being a small handheld device which, when the button is pressed, creates a cone-shaped beam of light shining down from the ceiling, forming a [[force shield|force field]] around the person highlighted. This field ought to block all exterior sound, making external communication all but impossible. However, as usual, this updated version is ineffective. The force field was shown to be solid, though, to the point where a panicking Larrabee found he could not escape, to the cause of his greater panic. When Max himself attempts to use the device to hide his glee at being named field agent, it malfunctions and does not even raise the field, permitting everybody to hear his embarrassing shouts. However, in fairness to the manufacturers, this was because Max didn't push the button hard enough.

== Variations and related devices==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
Throughout the five seasons of ''Get Smart'', the Cone of Silence appears many times. For security reasons, Maxwell Smart insists upon using it to discuss his case. Despite this, its use is always counterproductive in some way:
* During the first episode of the show, the Cone of Silence is lowered. Once it's in place, Max and the Chief can barely hear each other. The frustrated Chief then asks Hodgkins (a CONTROL scientist) to raise it, but Hodgkins can't hear him either.
* The Cone of Silence produces a very strong echo that gives both characters a headache.
* In perhaps one of the most comical moments involving the Cone of Silence, the Chief and Max can't hear each other.  Hodgkins, outside the Cone, can hear them perfectly and acts as a relay between the two.
* After the Cone of Silence is lowered, it randomly raises and lowers.  As Max and the Chief stand and sit to accommodate it, the Cone finally goes so low that it breaks through the Chief's desk, forcing them both to sit on the floor.
* In an episode where Max is asked to investigate KAOS headquarters, the Chief asks him what he found out, he once again insists upon the Cone of Silence, and the Chief reluctantly agrees. When it is lowered Max says he found out nothing, leaving the Chief highly frustrated. This is one of the few occasions where the Cone of Silence itself did not malfunction. Instead, its use was completely unnecessary.
* Another episode involves Max and the Chief using cards with words written on them to communicate. Max made a mistake at one point: The card that reads 99 was upside-down. The Chief responds with "Who is 66?"
* Max insists on lowering the cone of silence to discuss something top secret. Once lowered, he asks the Chief to borrow twenty dollars, frustrating the Chief. When the Chief says that he can't believe that, Max says "Would you believe, thirty dollars". After the Chief insists on raising it, Max reveals that the controls are on the outside, and when slipping out of it, 99 rings the doorbell, and Max forgets about the Chief, who is yelling and gesticulating – inaudibly, within the Cone.

The series also employs related technology:
* Closet of Silence: In one episode, when the Cone of Silence is not working, Max insists on using the "Closet of Silence". In the Closet, there are so many coats and jackets, they can barely hear each other, and cannot get out of the Closet, so Max shoots the lock off, injuring Larabee in the process.
* Portable Cone of Silence: In one episode, when Max and Chief are not in the office, Max brings along a portable Cone of Silence for them to use. This Cone seems to work, as the two can hear each other perfectly. Of course, the audience can hear them too. This cone apparently obscured the Chief's vision, and echoed violently when struck. When they try to take them off, Max succeeds but has to help the chief get his off. He uses his shoe and the butt of his gun, but the Chief finally breaks out after falling off a stage.
* Umbrella of Silence: In one episode, Max, 99 and Chief go to England where they meet the Chief of English CONTROL, who has an Umbrella of Silence which can fit more people in, but the disadvantage is that since the Chief of English CONTROL smokes a lot, he intolerably pollutes the air inside.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="965">In [[grammar]], a '''correlative''' is a word that is paired with another word with which it functions to perform a single function but from which it is separated in the sentence. 

In English, examples of correlative pairs are ''both–and, either–or, neither–nor, the–the'' ("&lt;u&gt;the&lt;/u&gt; more &lt;u&gt;the&lt;/u&gt; better"), ''so–that'' ("it ate &lt;u&gt;so&lt;/u&gt; much food &lt;u&gt;that&lt;/u&gt; it burst"), and ''if–then.'' 

In the [[wrong output languages]], the [[demonstrative]] [[pro-form]]s function as correlatives with the [[Relative pronoun|relative]] pro-forms, as ''autant–que'' in [[French language|French]]; in English, demonstratives are not used in such constructions, which depend on the relative only: "I saw &lt;u&gt;what&lt;/u&gt; you did", rather than *"I saw &lt;u&gt;that&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;what&lt;/u&gt; you did".

'''Electron deficiency''' occurs when a compound has too few [[valence electrons]] for the connections between atoms to be described as [[covalent bond]]s. Electron deficient bonds are often better described as [[3-center-2-electron bond]]s. Examples of compounds that are electron deficient are the [[borane]]s.

The term '''electron-deficient''' is also used in a more general way in [[organic chemistry]], to indicate a [[pi-bond|pi-system]] such as an [[alkene]] or [[arene]] that has [[Polar effect|electron-withdrawing groups]] attached, as found in [[nitrobenzene]] or [[acrylonitrile]]. Instead of showing the nucleated character common with simple C=C bonds, electron-deficient pi-systems may be [[electrophile|electrophilic]] and susceptible to nucleophilic attack, as is seen in the [[Michael addition]] or in [[nucleophilic aromatic substitution]].

As the most extreme form of electron deficiency one can consider the [[metallic bond]].

'''Experimental political science''' is the use of [[experiment]]s, which may be [[natural experiment|natural]] or [[scientific control|controlled]], to implement the [[scientific method]] in [[political science]].

== History and usage ==
The first experiment in political science is regarded to be Harold Gosnell's 1924 study on voter turnout in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morton|first1=Rebecca B.|last2=Williams|first2=Kenneth C.|title=Experimentation in Political Science|journal=The Oxford Handbook of Political Methodology|url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/politics/faculty/morton/ExpChapHandbook5April06.pdf|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this experiment, he randomly assigned districts to receive information on voter registration and encouragements to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gosnell|first1=Harold F.|title=An Experiment in the Stimulation of Voting|journal=American Political Science Review|date=1926|volume=20|issue=4|pages=869–874|url=http://www.ib.ethz.ch/teaching/pwgrundlagen/Gosnell-Experiment-Voting-1926.pdf|accessdate=26 July 2014|doi=10.2307/1945435}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current experts in experimental methodology in political science include [[Rebecca Morton]] and [[Donald Green]]. 

Since then, experimental research has become a growing area of political science. The publication of experimental research articles in flagship political science journals has risen, especially since the 1980s. Moreover, [[citation analysis]] indicates that articles using experimental methods have higher rates of citation.

Among the areas that it is used in are:
* [[Political psychology]], including [[survey methodology]], [[loss aversion]], influences on [[voter turnout]], and [[media influence]];
* The effects on outcomes of different [[voting systems]] (''e.g.'', [[Storable Votes#Experimental Results|storable votes]]), including the study of [[tactical voting]]; 
* The political economy of development;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Humphreys|first1=Macartan |last2=Weinstein | first2 = Jeremy  |title=Field experiments and the Political Economy of Development|journal = Annual Review of Political Science |date=2009|volume=12|pages=367–378|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.polisci.12.060107.155922|accessdate=13 August 2014 |doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.12.060107.155922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Four-point.png|thumb|Four-point measurement of resistance between voltage sense connections 2 and 3. Current is supplied via force connections 1 and 4.]]
'''Four-terminal sensing''' (4T sensing), '''4-wire sensing''', or '''4-point probes method''' is an [[electrical impedance]] measuring technique that uses separate pairs of [[electric current|current]]-carrying and [[voltage]]-sensing electrodes to make more accurate measurements than the simpler and more usual [[ohmmeter|two-terminal (2T) sensing]]. Four-terminal sensing is used in some [[ohmmeter]]s and [[LCR meter|impedance analyzer]]s, and in wiring for [[strain gauge]]s and [[resistance thermometer]]s. Four-point probes are also used to measure [[sheet resistance]] of [[thin film]]s (particularly [[semiconductor]] thin films).&lt;ref&gt;Chandra, H., et al.   [https://www.academia.edu/31083196/Open-Source_Automated_Mapping_Four-Point_Probe  Open-Source Automated Mapping Four-Point Probe]. ''Materials'' 2017, 10(2), 110. doi: 10.3390/ma10020110 &lt;/ref&gt;

Separation of current and voltage electrodes eliminates the lead and [[contact resistance]] from the measurement. This is an advantage for precise measurement of low resistance values. For example,  an [[LCR meter|LCR bridge]] instruction manual recommends the four-terminal technique for accurate measurement of resistance below 100 ohms.&lt;ref&gt;Manual for the Racal-Dana Databridge 9343M: "If the resistance value is low, less than 100 ohms, make a four-terminal connection..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Four-terminal sensing is also known as '''Kelvin sensing''', after [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson, Lord Kelvin]], who invented the [[Kelvin bridge]] in 1861 to measure very low resistances using four-terminal sensing. Each two-wire connection can be called a '''Kelvin connection'''. A pair of contacts that is designed to connect a force-and-sense pair to a single terminal or lead simultaneously is called a '''Kelvin contact'''. A clip, often a [[crocodile clip]], that connects a force-and-sense pair is called a '''Kelvin clip'''.

==Operating principle==
[[File:Kelvin connection layout.png|300px|thumb|right|Layout example of a Kelvin connection]]
When a Kelvin connection is used, current is supplied via a pair of '''source''' connections (current leads). These generate a voltage drop across the impedance to be measured according to [[Ohm's law]] ''V''=''IR''. A pair of '''sense''' connections (voltage leads) are made immediately adjacent to the target impedance, so that they do not include the voltage drop in the force leads or contacts. Since almost no current flows to the measuring instrument, the voltage drop in the sense leads is negligible.

It is usual to arrange the sense wires as the inside pair, while the force wires are the outside pair. If the force and sense connections are exchanged, accuracy can be affected, because more of the lead resistance is included in the measurement. The force wires may have to carry a large current when measuring very small resistances, and must be of adequate gauge; the sense wires can be of a small gauge.

The technique is commonly used in low-voltage [[power supplies]], where it is called '''remote sensing''', to measure the voltage delivered to the load independent of the voltage drop in the supply wires.

It is common to provide 4-wire connections to [[Shunt (electrical)#Use in current measuring|current-sensing shunt resistors]] of low resistance operating at high current.
{{clear|right}}

=={{anchor|Remote sensing}}3-wire sensing==
A variant uses three wires, with separate load and sense leads at one end, and a common wire on the other. Voltage drop in the common wire is compensated for by assuming that it is the same as in the load wire, of the same gauge and length. This technique is widely used in [[resistance thermometer]]s, also known as resistance temperature detectors or RTDs.

Another example is in the [[ATX power supply]] standard, which includes a remote sense wire connected to the 3.3&amp;nbsp;V supply line at connector pin 13, but no sense connection for the ground wires.

The '''Gammasphere''' is a third generation [[gamma ray spectrometer]] used to study rare and exotic [[nuclear physics]]. It consists of 108 Compton-suppressed large volume, high-purity germanium detectors arranged in a spherical shell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nucalf.physics.fsu.edu/~riley/gamma/], Gammasphere Online Booklet&lt;/ref&gt;

Gammasphere has been used to perform a variety of experiments in nuclear physics. Most experiments involve using [[heavy ion]] [[nuclear fusion]] to form a highly excited [[atomic nucleus]]. This nucleus may then emit [[proton]]s, [[neutron]]s, or [[alpha particle]]s followed by a shower of tens of [[gamma ray]]s. Gammasphere is used to measure properties of these gamma-rays for tens of millions of such gamma ray showers. The resultant data are analyzed to gain a deeper understanding of the properties of nuclei.

Gammasphere was built in the early 1990s and has operated at the 88-inch [[cyclotron]] at [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|Berkeley National Laboratory]] and at [[Argonne National Laboratory]].

In the movie [[Hulk (film)|Hulk]] Bruce Banner is zapped by a machine called Gammasphere. The actual Gammasphere, which detects rather than emits gamma rays, was used as a model for the device shown in the movie.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/06/030623083540.htm], ScienceDaily: Gammasphere Featured In New 'Hulk' Movie&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4527">A '''GeneRIF''' or '''Gene Reference Into Function''' is a short (255 characters or fewer) statement about the function of a gene.  GeneRIFs provide a simple [[mechanism (biology)|mechanism]] for allowing [[scientist]]s to add to the functional [[annotation]] of [[gene]]s described in the [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=gene Entrez Gene] database. In practice, ''function'' is construed quite broadly.  For example, there are GeneRIFs that discuss the role of a gene in a disease, GeneRIFs that point the viewer towards a review article about the gene, and GeneRIFs that discuss the structure of a gene.  However, the stated intent is for GeneRIFs to be about gene function. Currently over half a million geneRIFs have been created for genes from almost 1000 different species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/generif-stats | title=GeneRIF Stats - Gene - NCBI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GeneRIFs are always associated with specific entries in the Entrez Gene database.  Each GeneRIF has a pointer to the PubMed ID (a type of document identifier) of a scientific publication that provides evidence for the statement made by the GeneRIF.  GeneRIFs are often extracted directly from the document that is identified by the PubMed ID, very frequently from its title or from its final sentence.

GeneRIFs are usually produced by [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|NCBI]] indexers, but anyone may submit a GeneRIF.
To be processed, a valid Gene ID must exist for the specific gene, or the Gene staff must have assigned an overall Gene ID to the [[species]]. The latter case is implemented via records in Gene with the symbol NEWENTRY. Once the Gene ID is identified, only three types of information are required to complete a [[submission]]:
# a concise [[phrase]] describing a function or functions (less than 255 [[character (computing)|character]]s in length, preferably more than a restatement of the title of the paper);
# a published paper describing that function, implemented by supplying the PubMed ID of a citation in PubMed;
# a valid [[e-mail address]] (which will remain confidential).

== Example ==
Here are some GeneRIFs taken from [[Entrez Gene]] for GeneID 7157, the human gene [[TP53]].
The [[PubMed]] document identifiers have been omitted from the examples.  Note the wide variability with respect to the presence or absence of punctuation and of sentence-initial capital letters.
* p53 and c-erbB-2 may have independent role in carcinogenesis of gall bladder cancer
* Degradation of endogenous HIPK2 depends on the presence of a functional p53 protein.
* p53 codon 72 alleles influence the response to anticancer drugs in cells from aged people by regulating the cell cycle inhibitor p21WAF1
* Logistic regression analysis showed p53 and COX-2 as dependent predictors in pancreatic carcinogenesis, and a reciprocal relationship to neoplastic progression between p53 and COX-2.

GeneRIFs are an unusual type of textual genre, and they have recently been the subject of a number of articles from the natural language processing community.

He was noted for his study of [[silicate]]s and [[igneous rock]]s.

==Life==
Yoder was educated at the [[University of Chicago]] and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. He served as the fourth Director of the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]]'s Geophysical Laboratory, from 1971 to 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carnegieinstitution.org/legacy/findingaids/GL-2005-01-General.html Geophysical Laboratory General Files, 1900-Present], ''Shaun Hardy, Ann Mulfort, and Jennifer Snyder'', Carnegie Institution, September, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, he received the [[Wollaston Medal]].&lt;ref name=GSAobit&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nield|first1=Ted|title=Hatten Yoder Jr, 1921-2003|url=https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/About/History/Obituaries-2001-onwards/Obituaries-2003/Hatten-Yoder-Jr-1921-2003|publisher=The Geological Society of London|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''hyoid bone fracture''' is a very rare [[Bone fracture|fracture]] of the [[hyoid bone]], accounting for 0.002% of all fractures in humans. It is commonly associated with [[strangulation]] and rarely occurs in isolation. The fracture may be associated with gunshot injury, car accidents or induced vomiting. In 50% of strangulations and 27% of hangings, hyoid fractures occur.

== Signs and symptoms ==
The main symptoms of a hyoid bone fracture include pain when the affected person rotates their neck, trouble swallowing ([[dysphagia]]), and painful swallowing ([[odynophagia]]). Other symptoms can be crepitus or tenderness over the bone, suffocation when sticking out the tongue, dyspnea, dysphonia, and subcutaneous emphysema. On laryngoscope examination, lacerations on the pharynx, bruises, swelling, and/or hyoid bone fragments can be seen. If the hyoid bone is fractured, there is a high likelihood that the larynx, pharynx, mandible, and/or cervical spine may be injured as well. Common co-occurring injuries include Le Fort III fractures, mandibular or cervical vertebra fractures, and mandibular dislocation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
A diagnosis can be made using clinical examination, laryngoscope examination, and/or radiographic studies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
===Classification===
Hyoid bone fractures are classified into three different types:&lt;ref name="Isolated hyoid"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dalati|first=T.|title=Isolated hyoid bone fracture|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0901502704002772|journal=International Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery|volume=34|issue=4|pages=449–452|doi=10.1016/j.ijom.2004.09.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Inward compression fractures with outside periosteal tears
*Antero-posterior compression fractures with inside periosteal tears
*Avulsion fractures

== Treatment and prognosis ==
Treatment options vary from very conservative to aggressive. Conservative options include rest, observation, pain control, diet changes, use of a nasopharyngeal tube or oropharyngeal tube, and antibiotic therapy. More aggressive options include surgical repair of the hyoid bone and/or tracheotomy. Surgical treatment was used in 10.9% of cases in a 2012 meta-analysis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
Hyoid bones fractures represent 0.002% of all fractures; they are rare because the hyoid bone is well-protected by its location in the neck behind the mandible and in front of the cervical spine, as well as its mobility. 91.3% of hyoid bone fractures occur in men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28704">[[Image:Sinestezija primjer.jpg|thumb|right|Example of associations between graphemes and colors that are described more accurately as ideasthesia than as synesthesia]]
'''Ideasthesia''' (alternative spelling '''ideaesthesia''') is defined as a phenomenon in which activations of concepts (inducers) evoke perception-like experiences (concurrents). The name comes [[Ancient Greek]] ''ἰδέα'' (idéa) and ''αἴσθησις'' (aísthēsis), meaning "sensing concepts" or "sensing ideas".&lt;ref&gt;Nikolić, D. (2009) Is synaesthesia actually ideaesthesia? An inquiry into the nature of the phenomenon. Proceedings of the Third International Congress on Synaesthesia, Science &amp; Art, Granada, Spain, April 26–29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason for introducing the notion of ideasthesia was the problems with [[synesthesia]]. While "synesthesia" means "union of senses", [[empirical evidence]] indicated that this was an incorrect explanation of a set of phenomena traditionally covered by this heading. ''Syn-aesthesis'' denoting also "co-perceiving", implies the association of two sensory elements with little connection to the cognitive level. However, according to others,&lt;ref name = "Dixon et al 2006"&gt;Dixon, M.J., Smilek, D., Duffy, P.L., Zanna, P. M., Merikle, P. M. (2006) The Role of Meaning in Grapheme-Colour Synaesthesia, ''Cortex'' 42: 243-252.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mroczko et al 2009"&gt;Mroczko A., T. Metzinger, W. Singer, D. Nikolić (2009) Immediate transfer of synesthesia to a novel inducer. ''Journal of Vision'', 9: 2521-2528.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Simner Ward 2006"&gt;Simner, J.; Ward, J.

Mroczko (2011) Swimming-style synesthesia. ''Cortex'', 47(7):874-879.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "ChiouRich2014"&gt;Chiou, R., Rich N.A.  (2014) The role of conceptual knowledge in understanding synaesthesia: Evaluating contemporary findings from a ‘hub-and-spoke’perspective.

Consciousness and Cognition, 61, 94-106.&lt;/ref&gt; most phenomena that have inadvertently been linked to synesthesia in fact are induced by the [[Semantics|semantic]] representations. That is, the [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] of the stimulus is what is important rather than its sensory properties, as would be implied by the term synesthesia. In other words, while synesthesia presumes that both the trigger (inducer) and the resulting experience (concurrent) are of sensory nature, ideasthesia presumes that only the resulting experience is of sensory nature while the trigger is semantic. Meanwhile, the concept of ideasthesia developed into a theory of how we perceive and the research has extended to topics other than synesthesia &amp;mdash; as the concept of ideasthesia turned out applicable to our everyday [[perception]]. Ideasthesia has been even applied to the theory of art. Research on ideasthesia bears important implications for solving the mystery of human conscious [[qualia|experience]], which according to ideasthesia, is grounded in how we activate [[concepts]].&lt;ref name="MroczkoNikolic2014"&gt;Mroczko-Wąsowicz, A., Nikolić D. (2014) Semantic mechanisms may be responsible for developing synesthesia. ''Frontiers in Human Neuroscience'' 8:509. doi: 10.3389/fnhum.2014.00509&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples and evidence==
[[File:Synesthesia 5.jpg|thumb|left|An illustration drawn by a synesthete showing her [[Number form|time unit - space synesthesia]]/ideasthesia: the months in a year are organized into a circle surrounding her body, each month having a fixed location in space and a unique color.]] A common example of synesthesia is the association between [[grapheme]]s and colors, usually referred to as [[grapheme-color synesthesia]]. Here, letters of the alphabet are associated with vivid experiences of color. Studies have indicated that the perceived color is context-dependent and is determined by the extracted meaning of a stimulus. For example, an ambiguous stimulus '5' that can be interpreted either as 'S' or '5' will have the color associated with 'S' or with '5', depending on the context in which it is presented. If presented among numbers, it will be interpreted as '5' and will associate the respective color. If presented among letters, it will be interpreted as 'S' and will associate the respective synesthetic color.&lt;ref name = "Dixon et al 2006"/&gt;

Evidence for grapheme-color synesthesia comes also from the finding that colors can be flexibly associated to graphemes, as new meanings become assigned to those graphemes. In one study synesthetes were presented with [[Glagolitic alphabet|Glagolitic]] letters that they have never seen before, and the meaning was acquired through a short writing exercise. The Glagolitic graphemes inherited the colors of the corresponding Latin graphemes as soon as the Glagolitic graphemes acquired the new meaning.&lt;ref name = "Mroczko et al 2009"/&gt;

In another study, synesthetes were prompted to form novel synesthetic associations to graphemes never seen before. Synesthetes created those associations within minutes or seconds - which was time too short to account for creation of new physical connections between color representation and grapheme representation areas in the brain,&lt;ref&gt;Jürgens U.M., Nikolić D. (2012) Ideaesthesia: Conceptual processes assign similar colours to similar shapes. ''Translational Neuroscience'', 3(1): 22-27.&lt;/ref&gt; pointing again towards ideasthesia.

For [[lexical-gustatory synesthesia]] evidence also points towards ideasthesia: In lexical-gustatory synesthesia, verbalisation of the stimulus is not necessary for the experience of concurrents. Instead, it is sufficient to activate the concept.&lt;ref name = "Simner Ward 2006"/&gt;

Another case of synesthesia is swimming-style synesthesia in which each swimming style is associated with a vivid experience of a color.&lt;ref name = "Nikolic et al 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mroczko-Wąsowicz, Aleksandra, and Markus Werning. Synesthesia, sensory-motor contingency, and semantic emulation: how swimming style-color synesthesia challenges the traditional view of synesthesia. ''Frontiers in Psychology'' 3 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; These synesthetes do not need to perform the actual movements of a corresponding swimming style. To activate the concurrent experiences, it is sufficient to activate the concept of a swimming style (e.g., by presenting a photograph of a swimmer or simply talking about swimming).&lt;ref&gt;Jarrett, C. (2014). Great myths of the brain. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that grapheme-color synesthesia for [[Gemination|geminate consonants]] also provides evidence for ideasthesia.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, D.F., Hawco C.L.A. (2015) Geminate consonant grapheme-colour synaesthesia (ideaesthesia). ''BMC Neurology'', 15:112.&lt;/ref&gt;

In pitch-color synesthesia, the same tone will be associated with different colors depending on how it has been named; do-sharp (i.e. di) will have colors similar to do (e.g., a reddish  color) and re-flat (i.e. ra) will have color similar to that of re (e.g., yellowish), although the two classes refer to one the same tone.&lt;ref&gt;Itoh, K., Sakata, H., Kwee, I. L., &amp; Nakada, T. (2017). Musical pitch classes have rainbow hues in pitch class-color synesthesia. Scientific reports, 7(1), 17781.&lt;/ref&gt;

''One-shot synesthesia'': There are synesthetic experiences that can occur just once in lifetime, and are dubbed one-shot synesthesia. Investigation of such cases has indicated that such unique experiences typically occur when a synesthete is involved in an intensive mental and emotional activity such as making important plans for future or reflecting on their life. It has been thus concluded that this is also a form of ideasthesia.&lt;ref&gt;Kirschner, A., &amp; Nikolić, D. (2017). One-shot synesthesia. Translational Neuroscience, 8(1), 167-175.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In normal perception==
[[Image:Booba-Kiki.svg|thumb|right|Which one would be called Bouba and which Kiki? Responses are highly consistent among people. This is an example of ideasthesia as the conceptualization of the stimulus plays an important role.]]Recently, it has been suggested that the [[Bouba/kiki effect|Bouba/Kiki]] phenomenon is a case of ideasthesia.&lt;ref name = Gomez2013&gt;Gómez Milán, E., Iborra, O., de Córdoba, M.J., Juárez-Ramos V., Rodríguez Artacho, M.A., Rubio, J.L. (2013) The Kiki-Bouba effect: A case of personification and ideaesthesia. ''The Journal of Consciousness Studies.''  20(1-2): pp. 84-102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shukla, A. (2016). The Kiki-Bouba paradigm: Where senses meet and greet. Indian Journal of Mental Health, 3(3), 240-252.&lt;/ref&gt; Most people will agree that the star-shaped object on the left is named Kiki and the round one on the right Bouba.&lt;ref name = Kohler1929&gt;{{cite book | author = Köhler, W | year = 1929 | title = Gestalt Psychology. | location = New York | publisher = Liveright}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Rama2001"&gt;Ramachandran, VS &amp; Hubbard, EM (2001) Synaesthesia: A window into perception, thought and language. ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 8(12): 3–34.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been assumed that these associations come from direct connections between visual and auditory cortices.&lt;ref name = "Rama2001" /&gt; For example, according to that hypothesis, representations of sharp inflections in the star-shaped object would be physically connected to the representations of sharp inflection in the sound of Kiki. However, Gomez et al.&lt;ref name = Gomez2013 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milán, Emilio Gómez, Oscar Iborra Martínez, and María José de Córdoba Serrano. El Universo Kiki-Bouba: Ideaestesia, Empatía y Neuromárketing. Fundación Internacional artecittà, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that Kiki/Bouba associations are much richer as either word and either image is associated semantically to a number of concepts such as white or black color, feminine vs. masculine, cold vs. hot, and others. These sound-shape associations seem to be related through a large overlap between semantic networks of Kiki and star-shape on one hand, and Bouba and round-shape on the other hand. For example, both Kiki and star-shape are clever, small, thin and nervous. This indicates that behind Kiki-Bouba effect lies a rich semantic network. In other words, our sensory experience is largely determined by the meaning that we assign to stimuli. Food description and wine tasting is another domain in which ideasthetic association between flavor and other modalities such as shape may play an important role.&lt;ref&gt;Spence, Charles, and Ophelia Deroy. On the shapes of flavours: A review of four hypotheses. ''Theoria et Historia Scientiarum'' 10 (2014): 207-238.&lt;/ref&gt; These semantic-like relations play a role in successful marketing; the name of a product should match its other characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Bridger, D. (2015). Decoding the irrational consumer: How to commission, run and generate insights from neuromarketing research. Kogan Page Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications for development of synesthesia==
The concept of ideasthesia bears implications for understanding [[Developmental psychology|how synesthesia develops]] in children. Synesthetic children may associate concrete sensory-like experiences primarily to the abstract concepts that they have otherwise difficulties dealing with.&lt;ref name="MroczkoNikolic2014"/&gt; Synesthesia may thus be used as a cognitive tool to cope with the abstractness of the learning materials imposed by the educational system &amp;mdash; referred to also as a "semantic vacuum hypothesis". This hypothesis explains why the most common inducers in synesthesia are graphemes and time units &amp;mdash; both relating to the first truly abstract ideas that a child needs to master.&lt;ref&gt;Rapp, B., &amp; Caramazza, A. (1997). From graphemes to abstract letter shapes: levels of representation in written spelling. Journal of experimental psychology: human perception and performance, 23(4), 1130.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples and evidence==
[[File:Synesthesia 5.jpg|thumb|left|An illustration drawn by a synesthete showing her [[Number form|time unit - space synesthesia]]/ideasthesia: the months in a year are organized into a circle surrounding her body, each month having a fixed location in space and a unique color.]] A common example of synesthesia is the association between [[grapheme]]s and colors, usually referred to as [[grapheme-color synesthesia]]. Here, letters of the alphabet are associated with vivid experiences of color. Studies have indicated that the perceived color is context-dependent and is determined by the extracted meaning of a stimulus. For example, an ambiguous stimulus '5' that can be interpreted either as 'S' or '5' will have the color associated with 'S' or with '5', depending on the context in which it is presented. If presented among numbers, it will be interpreted as '5' and will associate the respective color. If presented among letters, it will be interpreted as 'S' and will associate the respective synesthetic color.&lt;ref name = "Dixon et al 2006"/&gt;

Evidence for grapheme-color synesthesia comes also from the finding that colors can be flexibly associated to graphemes, as new meanings become assigned to those graphemes. In one study synesthetes were presented with [[Glagolitic alphabet|Glagolitic]] letters that they have never seen before, and the meaning was acquired through a short writing exercise. The Glagolitic graphemes inherited the colors of the corresponding Latin graphemes as soon as the Glagolitic graphemes acquired the new meaning.&lt;ref name = "Mroczko et al 2009"/&gt;

In another study, synesthetes were prompted to form novel synesthetic associations to graphemes never seen before. Synesthetes created those associations within minutes or seconds - which was time too short to account for creation of new physical connections between color representation and grapheme representation areas in the brain,&lt;ref&gt;Jürgens U.M., Nikolić D. (2012) Ideaesthesia: Conceptual processes assign similar colours to similar shapes. ''Translational Neuroscience'', 3(1): 22-27.&lt;/ref&gt; pointing again towards ideasthesia.

For [[lexical-gustatory synesthesia]] evidence also points towards ideasthesia: In lexical-gustatory synesthesia, verbalisation of the stimulus is not necessary for the experience of concurrents. Instead, it is sufficient to activate the concept.&lt;ref name = "Simner Ward 2006"/&gt;

Another case of synesthesia is swimming-style synesthesia in which each swimming style is associated with a vivid experience of a color.&lt;ref name = "Nikolic et al 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mroczko-Wąsowicz, Aleksandra, and Markus Werning. Synesthesia, sensory-motor contingency, and semantic emulation: how swimming style-color synesthesia challenges the traditional view of synesthesia. ''Frontiers in Psychology'' 3 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; These synesthetes do not need to perform the actual movements of a corresponding swimming style. To activate the concurrent experiences, it is sufficient to activate the concept of a swimming style (e.g., by presenting a photograph of a swimmer or simply talking about swimming).&lt;ref&gt;Jarrett, C. (2014). Great myths of the brain. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that grapheme-color synesthesia for [[Gemination|geminate consonants]] provides also evidence for ideasthesia.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, D.F., Hawco C.L.A. (2015) Geminate consonant grapheme-colour synaesthesia (ideaesthesia). ''BMC Neurology'', 15:112.&lt;/ref&gt;

In pitch-color synesthesia, the same tone will be associated with different colors depending on how it has been named; do-sharp will have colors similar to do (e.g., a reddish  color) and re-flat will have color similar to that of re (e.g., yellowish), although the two classes refer to one the same tone.&lt;ref&gt;Itoh, K., Sakata, H., Kwee, I. L., &amp; Nakada, T. (2017). Musical pitch classes have rainbow hues in pitch class-color synesthesia. Scientific reports, 7(1), 17781.&lt;/ref&gt;

''One-shot synesthesia'': There are synesthetic experiences that can occur just once in lifetime, and are dubbed one-shot synesthesia. Investigation of such cases has indicated that such unique experiences typically occur when a synesthete is involved in an intensive mental and emotional activity such as making important plans for future or reflecting on their life. It has been thus concluded that this is also a form of ideasthesia.&lt;ref&gt;Kirschner, A., &amp; Nikolić, D. (2017). One-shot synesthesia. Translational Neuroscience, 8(1), 167-175.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In normal perception==
[[Image:Booba-Kiki.svg|thumb|right|Which one would be called Bouba and which Kiki? Responses are highly consistent among people. This is an example of ideasthesia as the conceptualization of the stimulus plays an important role.]]Recently, it has been suggested that the [[Bouba/kiki effect|Bouba/Kiki]] phenomenon is a case of ideasthesia.&lt;ref name = Gomez2013&gt;Gómez Milán, E., Iborra, O., de Córdoba, M.J., Juárez-Ramos V., Rodríguez Artacho, M.A., Rubio, J.L. (2013) The Kiki-Bouba effect: A case of personification and ideaesthesia. ''The Journal of Consciousness Studies.''  20(1-2): pp. 84-102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shukla, A. (2016). The Kiki-Bouba paradigm: Where senses meet and greet. Indian Journal of Mental Health, 3(3), 240-252.&lt;/ref&gt; Most people will agree that the star-shaped object on the left is named Kiki and the round one on the right Bouba.&lt;ref name = Kohler1929&gt;{{cite book | author = Köhler, W | year = 1929 | title = Gestalt Psychology. | location = New York | publisher = Liveright}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Rama2001"&gt;Ramachandran, VS &amp; Hubbard, EM (2001) Synaesthesia: A window into perception, thought and language. ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 8(12): 3–34.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been assumed that these associations come from direct connections between visual and auditory cortices.&lt;ref name = "Rama2001" /&gt; For example, according to that hypothesis, representations of sharp inflections in the star-shaped object would be physically connected to the representations of sharp inflection in the sound of Kiki. However, Gomez et al.&lt;ref name = Gomez2013 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milán, Emilio Gómez, Oscar Iborra Martínez, and María José de Córdoba Serrano. El Universo Kiki-Bouba: Ideaestesia, Empatía y Neuromárketing. Fundación Internacional artecittà, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that Kiki/Bouba associations are much richer as either word and either image is associated semantically to a number of concepts such as white or black color, feminine vs. masculine, cold vs. hot, and others. These sound-shape associations seem to be related through a large overlap between semantic networks of Kiki and star-shape on one hand, and Bouba and round-shape on the other hand. For example, both Kiki and star-shape are clever, small, thin and nervous. This indicates that behind Kiki-Bouba effect lies a rich semantic network. In other words, our sensory experience is largely determined by the meaning that we assign to stimuli. Food description and wine tasting is another domain in which ideasthetic association between flavor and other modalities such as shape may play an important role.&lt;ref&gt;Spence, Charles, and Ophelia Deroy. On the shapes of flavours: A review of four hypotheses. ''Theoria et Historia Scientiarum'' 10 (2014): 207-238.&lt;/ref&gt; These semantic-like relations play a role in successful marketing; the name of a product should match its other characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Bridger, D. (2015). Decoding the irrational consumer: How to commission, run and generate insights from neuromarketing research. Kogan Page Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications for development of synesthesia==
The concept of ideasthesia bears implications for understanding [[Developmental psychology|how synesthesia develops]] in children. Synesthetic children may associate concrete sensory-like experiences primarily to the abstract concepts that they have otherwise difficulties dealing with.&lt;ref name="MroczkoNikolic2014"/&gt; Synesthesia may thus be used as a cognitive tool to cope with the abstractness of the learning materials imposed by the educational system &amp;mdash; referred to also as a "semantic vacuum hypothesis". This hypothesis explains why the most common inducers in synesthesia are graphemes and time units &amp;mdash; both relating to the first truly abstract ideas that a child needs to master.&lt;ref&gt;Rapp, B., &amp; Caramazza, A. (1997). From graphemes to abstract letter shapes: levels of representation in written spelling. Journal of experimental psychology: human perception and performance, 23(4), 1130.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications for art theory==
The concept of ideasthesia has been often discussed in relation to art,&lt;ref&gt;Gsöllpointner, Katharina. "DIE KUNST DER SINNE–DIE SINNE DER KUNST." Exploring Cybernetics: Kybernetik im interdisziplinären Diskurs (2015): 137-165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albertazzi, Liliana, et al. "The hue of angles—was Kandinsky right?."

(2017). Hendrick ter Brugghen's Musicians and the Engagement of the Viewer. Temple University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prendergast, J. (2018). Grinding the moor–ideasthesia and narrative. New Writing, 1-17.&lt;/ref&gt; and also used to formulate a psychological theory of art.&lt;ref name = "Nikolic Art"&gt;Nikolić D. (2016) Ideasthesia and art. In: Gsöllpointner, Katharina, et al. (eds.). 2016. Digital Synesthesia. A Model for the Aesthetics of Digital Art. Berlin/Boston: De Gruyter (http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/print/11666)&lt;/ref&gt; According to the theory, we consider something to be a piece of art when experiences induced by the piece are accurately balanced with semantics induced by the same piece. Thus, a piece of art makes us both strongly think and strongly experience. Moreover, the two must be perfectly balanced such that the most salient stimulus or event is both the one that evokes strongest experiences (fear, joy, ... ) and strongest cognition (recall, memory, ...) &amp;mdash; in other words, ''idea'' is well balanced with ''aesthesia''.

Ideasthesia theory of art may be used for psychological studies of [[aesthetics]]. It may also help explain [[classificatory disputes about art]] as its main tenet is that experience of art can only be individual, depending on person's unique knowledge, experiences and history.&lt;ref name = "Nikolic Art"/&gt; There could exist no general classification of art satisfactorily applicable to each and all individuals.

The '''intertidal zone''', also known as the '''foreshore''' and '''seashore''' and sometimes referred to as the [[littoral zone]], is the area that is above [[water]] at [[low tide]] and underwater at [[high tide]] (in other words, the area between tide marks). This area can include many different types of habitats, with many types of animals, such as [[starfish]], [[Sea urchin|sea urchins]], and numerous species of [[coral]].
[[File:Bancao Beach at Low Tide showing Intertidal Zone from about 200 meters from the beach.jpg|thumb|Bancao Beach at Low Tide showing Intertidal Zone from about 200 m from the beach]]

The well-known area also includes steep rocky [[cliff]]s, sandy [[beach]]es, or [[wetlands]] (e.g., vast [[mudflat]]s). The area can be a narrow strip, as in [[Pacific island]]s that have only a narrow tidal range, or can include many meters of shoreline where shallow beach slopes interact with high tidal excursion. '''Peritidal zone''' is similar but a somewhat wider zone, extending from above the highest tide level to below that of the lowest tide level.

[[Organism]]s in the intertidal zone are adapted to an environment of harsh extremes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.aes.bioflux.com.ro/docs/2016.71-82.pdf|title = Physico-chemical parameters and macrobenthic invertebrates of the intertidal zone of Gusa, Cagayan de Oro City, Philippnes|last = Walag|first = Angelo Mark |author2=Mae Oljae P.

[[ocean surface wave|Wave]] splash can dislodge residents from the littoral zone. With the intertidal zone's high exposure to the sun, the [[temperature]] range can be anything from very hot with full [[sun]] to near freezing in colder climates. Some [[microclimate]]s in the littoral zone are ameliorated by local features and larger plants such as [[mangrove]]s. [[Adaptation]] in the littoral zone allows the use of [[nutrient]]s supplied in high volume on a regular basis from the [[sea]], which is actively moved to the zone by tides. Edges of habitats, in this case land and sea, are themselves often significant [[ecosystem|ecologies]], and the littoral zone is a prime example.

A typical [[rocky shore]] can be divided into a spray zone or splash zone (also known as the [[Littoral zone#Supralittoral zone|supratidal zone]]), which is above the spring high-tide line and is covered by water only during storms, and an intertidal zone, which lies between the high and low tidal extremes. Along most [[shore]]s, the intertidal zone can be clearly separated into the following subzones: high tide zone, middle tide zone, and low tide zone. The intertidal zone is one of a number of [[marine biomes]] or [[habitat]]s, including [[estuaries]], [[Neritic zone|neritic]], [[Epipelagic zone|surface]] and [[Profundal zone|deep zones]].

==Zonation==
[[Image:Tide pools at Pillar Point 7.jpg|thumb|upright|Tide pools at Pillar Point showing zonation on the edge of the rock ledge]]
[[Image:Intertide zonation at Kalaloch.jpg|thumb|upright|A rock, seen at low tide, exhibiting typical intertidal zonation, Kalaloch, [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], western United States.]]
Marine biologists divide the intertidal region into three zones (low, middle, and high), based on the overall average exposure of the zone. The low intertidal zone, which borders on the shallow subtidal zone, is only exposed to air at the lowest of low tides and is primarily marine in character. The mid intertidal zone is regularly exposed and submerged by average tides. The high intertidal zone is only covered by the highest of the high tides, and spends much of its time as terrestrial habitat. The high intertidal zone borders on the [[Supralittoral zone|splash zone]] (the region above the highest still-tide level, but which receives wave splash). On shores exposed to heavy [[wave action]], the intertidal zone will be influenced by waves, as the spray from breaking waves will extend the intertidal zone.

Depending on the substratum and topography of the shore, additional features may be noticed. On [[rocky shore]]s, [[tide pool]]s form in depressions that fill with water as the tide rises. Under certain conditions, such as those at [[Morecambe Bay]], [[quicksand]] may form.

== Low tide zone (lower littoral) ==
This subregion is mostly submerged - it is only exposed at the point of low tide and for a longer period of time during extremely low tides. This area is teeming with life; the most notable difference with this subregion to the other three is that there is much more marine vegetation, especially [[seaweed]]s. There is also a great biodiversity. Organisms in this zone generally are not well adapted to periods of dryness and temperature extremes. Some of the organisms in this area are [[abalone]], [[sea anemone]]s, [[brown seaweed]], [[chiton]]s, [[crab]]s, [[green algae]], [[hydroid (zoology)|hydroids]], [[isopod]]s, [[limpet]]s, [[mussel]]s, [[nudibranch]]s, [[sculpin]], [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumber]], [[sea lettuce]], [[sea palm]]s, [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s, [[shrimp]], [[snail]]s, [[sponge]]s, [[Phyllospadix scouleri|surf grass]], [[Tube worm (body plan)|tube worms]], and [[whelk]]s. Creatures in this area can grow to larger sizes because there is more available [[energy]] in the localized ecosystem. Also, marine vegetation can grow to much greater sizes than in the other three intertidal subregions due to the better water coverage. The water is shallow enough to allow plenty of [[sunlight|light]] to reach the vegetation to allow substantial [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] activity, and the [[salinity]] is at almost normal levels. This area is also protected from large [[predator]]s such as [[fish]] because of the wave action and the relatively shallow water.

==Ecology==

[[Image:Pteropurpura trialata is laying the eggs 1.jpg|thumb|A [[California]] tide pool in the low tide zone]]
The intertidal region is an important model system for the study of [[ecology]], especially on wave-swept rocky shores. The region contains a high diversity of species, and the zonation created by the tides causes species ranges to be compressed into very narrow bands. This makes it relatively simple to study species across their entire cross-shore range, something that can be extremely difficult in, for instance, terrestrial habitats that can stretch thousands of kilometres. Communities on wave-swept shores also have high turnover due to disturbance, so it is possible to watch ecological succession over years rather than decades.

The burrowing invertebrates that make up large portions of sandy beach ecosystems are known to travel relatively great distances in cross-shore directions as beaches change on the order of days, semilunar cycles, seasons, or years.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dugan|first=Jenifer E.|last2=Hubbard|first2=David M.|last3=Quigley|first3=Brenna J.|year=2013|title=Beyond beach width: Steps toward identifying and integrating ecological envelopes with geomorphic features and datums for sandy beach ecosystems|url=|journal=Geomorphology|volume=199|pages=95–105|doi=10.1016/j.geomorph.2013.04.043|via=Elsevier Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distribution of some species has been found to correlate strongly with geomorphic datums such as the high tide strand and the water table outcrop.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Since the foreshore is alternately covered by the sea and exposed to the air, organisms living in this environment must have adaptions for both wet and dry conditions. Hazards include being smashed or carried away by rough waves, exposure to dangerously high temperatures, and desiccation. Typical inhabitants of the intertidal rocky shore include [[Sea urchin|urchins]], [[sea anemone]]s, [[barnacle]]s, chitons, crabs, [[isopods]], mussels, [[starfish]], and many marine [[gastropod]] [[mollusc]]s such as limpets and whelks.

==Legal issues==
{{see also|Public trust doctrine}}

As with the dry sand part of a beach, legal and political disputes can arise over the ownership and use of the foreshore. One recent example is the [[New Zealand foreshore and seabed controversy]]. In legal discussions, the foreshore is often referred to as the ''wet-sand area''.

For privately owned beaches in the United States, some states such as [[Massachusetts]] use the low water mark as the dividing line between the property of the State and that of the beach owner, however the public still has fishing, fowling, and navigation right to the zone between low and high water&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mass.gov/service-details/public-rights-along-the-shoreline&lt;/ref&gt;. Other states such as California use the high-water mark.

In the United Kingdom, the foreshore is generally deemed to be owned by the [[The Crown|Crown]] although there are notable exceptions, especially what are termed ''several fisheries'', which can be historic deeds to title, dating back to [[John of England|King John]]'s time or earlier, and the [[Udal Law]], which applies generally in [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]].

In Greece, according to the L. 2971/01, the foreshore zone is defined as the area of the coast that might be reached by the maximum climbing of the waves on the coast (maximum wave run-up on the coast) in their maximum capacity (maximum referring to the "usually maximum winter waves" and of course not to exceptional cases, such as tsunamis etc.). The foreshore zone, apart of the exceptions of the law, is public, and permanent constructions are not allowed on it.

==Other media==
The Intertidal Zone was used as a title for [[Stephen Hillenburg]]'s old comic strip. The comic strip starred "Bob The Sponge", who would later go on to become [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob SquarePants]].

A '''medical isotope''' is an [[isotope]] used in [[medicine]].

The first uses of isotopes in medicine were in [[radiopharmaceutical]]s, and this is still the most common use. However more recently, [[isotope separation|separated]]  stable isotopes have also come into use.

Examples of non-radioactive medical isotopes are:

* [[Deuterium]] in [[deuterated drug]]s
* [[Carbon-13]] used in [[liver function]] and [[metabolic test]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/carbon-13|title=carbon-13|website=thefreedictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''KQ-X''' was a $33 million [[DARPA]] program awarded to [[Northrop Grumman]] on July 1, 2010. KQ-X investigated and developed [[autonomous aerial refueling]] techniques using two [[NASA]] [[Global Hawk]] [[high-altitude long endurance]] (HALE) [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAVs).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irconnect.com/noc/press/pages/news_releases.html?d=195525 Photo Release -- DARPA Tasks Northrop Grumman to Demonstrate Autonomous Aerial Refueling]&lt;/ref&gt;

Northrop Grumman retrofitted two of the HALE UAVs so that one aircraft can pump fuel into the other while in flight via a [[Aerial refueling#Probe-and-drogue 2|hose-and-drogue refueling system]]. Several aspects of the KQ-X program were considered revolutionary: not only would the aerial refueling be autonomous, but since Global Hawks are classified as HALE UAVs, the refueling tests would occur at an altitude higher than that typically performed using manned aircraft. The tests would also be the first time that HALE UAVs have been flown in formation.&lt;ref name=deagel&gt;[http://www.deagel.com/news/Northrop-Grumman-to-Demonstrate-NASA-KQ-X-Global-Hawk-Autonomous-Aerial-Refueling_n000007524.aspx "Northrop Grumman to Demonstrate NASA KQ-X Global Hawk Autonomous Aerial Refueling."] Guide to Military Equipment and Civil Aviation. N.p., 1 July 2010. Web. 13 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Engineering work was completed at the Northrop Grumman Unmanned Systems Development Center in [[Rancho Bernardo, California]]. Pilots from NASA, [[NOAA]], and Northrop Grumman flew the Global Hawks from the NASA [[Armstrong Flight Research Center]] at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], also in California. [[Sargent Fletcher]] Inc. and [[Sierra Nevada Corporation]] were major KQ-X subcontractors.&lt;ref name=deagel/&gt;

Flight demonstrations occurred from January 11, 2012 to May 30. In these demonstrations, the aircraft extended and retracted the refueling hose, demonstrated precision control in formation with manual and automated breakaway maneuvers, flew in formation as close as {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=on}}, and autonomously flew in close formation for over 2.5 hours under autonomous control within {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} (one wingspan) of each other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suasnews.com/2012/10/19067/two-global-hawk-unmanned-aircraft-fly-in-close-formation-move-ahr-program-closer-to-autonomous-aerial-refueling/ Global Hawks move closer to unmanned refueling] - SuasNews.com, October 9, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In a departure from traditional refueling methods, the tanker is fitted with a refueling probe on the nose, which trails behind the receiving aircraft equipped with a hose-drum unit under the fuselage, plugging into the drogue and pushing the fuel upwards. Autonomous aerial refueling was expected to extend the Global Hawk's endurance from 30-35 hours to 120-125 hours, set by payload reliability more than engine oil consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviationweek.com/blog/kq-x-yes-how-they-do-it KQ-X - Yes, That IS How They Do It] - Aviationweek.com, 22 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The KQ-X program ended in September 2012 without airborne fuel transfer occurring between the two UAVs.  The two Global Hawks used in demonstrations were owned by NASA and jointly operated with Northrop Grumman.  NASA required the two planes for atmospheric science missions in June 2012 after flight control testing and had to de-modify and reconfigure them to perform hurricane tracking flights after that.  Further tests could have been performed, but NASA halted the use of the Global Hawks that June after a Navy operated version crashed.  The May 30 flight was the ninth and final test of the program, with the two aircraft flying close at {{convert|44,800|ft|m|abbr=on}} to measure aerodynamic and control interactions.  Data from the flights were put into virtual simulations that concluded 60 percent of autonomous refueling attempts would result in contact between the refueling probe and receiver drogue.  Further unmanned refueling tests were carried out under the [[Unmanned Combat Air System Demonstrator program]] with software from the [[Northrop Grumman X-47B]] UAV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aviationweek.com/Blogs.aspx?plckPostId=Blog:27ec4a53-dcc8-42d0-bd3a-01329aef79a7Post:b5424ea3-fd4c-4efa-949e-3bbf0c795fef Hurricane Casualty -- KQ-X Unmanned Refueling Demo] - Aviationweek.com, 15 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Kellex was formed in 1942 so that Kellogg's operations relating to the [[Manhattan Project]] could be kept separate and secret.&lt;ref name="manhattan"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/011/11-10/index.html | title=Manhattan: The Army and the Atomic Bomb | publisher=Center of Military History, United States Army | author=Jones, Vincent C | year=1985 | location=Washington, DC |pp=150–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Kell" stood for "Kellogg" and "X" for secret.&lt;ref name=AHF /&gt;  The new company's goal was to design a facility for the production of [[enriched uranium]] through [[gaseous diffusion]]. In gaseous diffusion, isotopes of [[Uranium-235]] could be separated from [[Uranium-238]] by turning uranium metal into [[Uranium hexafluoride|uranium hexafluoride gas]] and straining it through a barrier material.&lt;ref name=K-25&gt;{{cite web|title=K-25|url=http://manhattanprojectvoices.org/location/k-25|website=Voices of the Manhattan Project|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:View of Woolworth Building fixed crop.jpg | right|thumb | The Woolworth Building, New York City]] 
The M. W. Kellogg Company, headquartered in Jersey City, NJ, specialized in chemical engineering projects. A year before the Manhattan Project began, the [[S-1 Section]] of the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] asked Kellogg to work with [[John R. Dunning]] and other scientists at [[Columbia University]] to ascertain the feasibility of gaseous diffusion.&lt;ref name="Smyth"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smyth |first=Henry DeWolf |authorlink=Henry DeWolf Smyth |url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/Docs/SmythReport/ |title=Atomic Energy for Military Purposes; the Official Report on the Development of the Atomic Bomb under the Auspices of the United States Government, 1940–1945 |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1945 |ref=harv |isbn=978-0-8047-1722-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pilot project at Kellogg was led by Percival C. "Dobie" Keith,&lt;ref name=AHF/&gt; vice-president of engineering at Kellogg, with A. L. Baker as Project Manager, and J. H. Arnold as Director of Research and Development.&lt;ref name="Smyth"/&gt;  The work that Kellogg and Keith were doing on the pilot project made them obvious choices when the Manhattan Project looked for a company to create a  production level processing plant.&lt;ref name=AHF&gt;{{cite web|title=Corporate Partners|url=http://www.atomicheritage.org/history/corporate-partners|website=Atomic Heritage Foundation|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newly formed Kellex company was headquartered in the [[Woolworth Building]] in [[Lower Manhattan]], co-located with the New York Area Engineers Office, which oversaw the contract and the nearly one hundred [[Special Engineer Detachment]] personnel which had been assigned to the firm headquarters.&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Vincent C.|title=Manhattan: The Army and the Atomic Bomb: Special Studies - United States Army in World War II|date=1985|publisher=Center of Military History, United States Army|isbn=9780160019395|page=151|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eXuJIb-HxxEC&amp;pg=PA151|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AHF/&gt; Kellex facilities were also located at [[Columbia University]]'s Nash Garage Building in New York City, in Decatur, Illinois,&lt;ref name=Decatur&gt;{{cite web|title=Decatur|url=http://manhattanprojectvoices.org/location/decatur|website=Voices of the Manhattan Project|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Kellogg's Jersey City plant,&lt;ref name=FUSRAP&gt;{{cite web|title=FUSRAP Considered Sites Jersey City, NJ|url=http://www.lm.doe.gov/Considered_Sites/Jersey_City_NJ_Site_-_NJ_07.aspx|website=Energy.gov|publisher=U. S. Department of Energy|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the [[Clinton Engineer Works]] in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]].

[[File:K-25 aerial view cropped.jpg| right|thumb | The K-25 building of the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant]] 
Kellex was charged with developing processes and equipment and to design the plant. Several technical challenges needed to be met before gas extraction techniques could be effectively applied to separation of uranium. Such a system would need an adequate porous barrier, a workable gas pump, and a pipe that could resist the corrosive effects of uranium hexafluoride gas.&lt;ref name=AHF/&gt; Scientists developed and tested different possible processes for uranium extraction at various locations.  These included a pilot gaseous diffusion plant built at Columbia University in the Nash Garage Building at 3280 Broadway, New York, NY.&lt;ref name=Manhattan&gt;{{cite web|title=Manhattan, NY |url=http://www.atomicheritage.org/location/manhattan-ny|website=Atomic Heritage Foundation|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists and engineers were developing technology for the proposed production plant at the same time that architects were designing a building to house it.&lt;ref name=Manhattan/&gt;

The project was known as [[K-25 Project|K-25]]; "K" stood for Kellex while "25" was a common designation for uranium-235 during the Manhattan project. The K-25 production plant at the Clinton Engineer Works was built by the J. A. Jones Construction Company.&lt;ref name="Smyth"/&gt;  The mile-long, U-shaped plant covered {{convert|44|acres|ha}}, was four stories high and contained hundreds of miles of specially coated, hermetically sealed pipes and equipment.&lt;ref name=Restricted&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wellerstein|first1=Alex|title=Inside K-25|url=http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2013/05/24/inside-k-25/|website=Restricted Data: The Nuclear Secrecy Blog|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=K-25/&gt; The K-25 plant was the single most expensive facility of the Manhattan Project.&lt;ref name=Restricted/&gt;  Once built it was operated by the [[Union Carbide|Carbide and Carbon Chemicals Corporation]].&lt;ref name="Smyth"/&gt;

In 1950, Kellex Corporation was acquired by [[Vitro Corporation]].&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baker|first1=A.

It was instructed to think of itself as a miniature [[constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]].

The [http://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/reform/report011001.pdf 133-page final report] was issued in January 2001, with 139 recommendations, some of them quite bold. The Commission concluded the state should provide more aid to villages, towns, cities and counties which collaborate on a regional basis to provide taxpayers better service and spur economic growth, and that the state should ultimately assume responsibility for defining and financing social service and criminal justice programs at the county level, including child welfare, circuit courts and juvenile justice. Like those of most such commissions, the conclusions and recommendations have been only spottily addressed.

[[File:Koteka.jpg|thumb|Koteka souvenir]]
 
The '''koteka''', '''horim''',  or '''penis gourd''' is a [[penis]] sheath traditionally worn by native male inhabitants of some (mainly highland) ethnic groups in [[New Guinea]] to cover their genitals. They are normally made from a dried-out [[gourd]], ''[[Lagenaria siceraria]]'', although other species, such as ''[[Nepenthes mirabilis]]'', are also used. They are held in place by a small loop of fiber attached to the base of the koteka and placed around the scrotum. There is a secondary loop placed around the chest or abdomen and attached to the main body of the koteka. Men choose kotekas similar to ones worn by other men in their cultural group. For example, [[Yali people|Yali]] men favour a long, thin koteka, which helps hold up the multiple rattan hoops worn around their waist. Men from [[Tiom]] wear a double gourd, held up with a strip of cloth, and use the space between the two gourds for carrying small items such as money and tobacco.

== Traditions ==
It is traditional [[clothing]] in certain [[New Guinea]] highlands societies including in the Grand [[Baliem Valley]] of [[Western New Guinea]] and the [[Ok Tedi]] and [[Telefomin]] regions of [[Papua New Guinea]]. It is worn without other clothing, tied in upward position.

== Different identification ==
[[File:Koteka 2.jpg|thumb|Koteka]]
Many tribes can be identified by the way they wear their koteka. Some wear them pointed straight out, straight up, at an angle, or in other directions. The diameter of the koteka can also be a clue. Contrary to popular belief, there is little correlation between the size or length of the koteka and the social status of the wearer. Kotekas of different sizes serve different purposes: very short kotekas are worn when working and longer and more elaborate kotekas are worn on festive occasions. The koteka is made of a specially grown gourd. Stone weights are tied to the bottom of the gourd to stretch it out as it grows. Curves can be made in it by the use of string to restrain its growth in whatever direction the grower wishes. They can be quite elaborately shaped in this manner. When harvested, the gourd is emptied and dried. It is sometimes waxed with beeswax or native resins. It can be painted, or have shells, feathers and other decorations attached to it.

[[Sociolinguistic]]ally and [[political]]ly today, the term '''koteka''' is used as a name of tribal groups across the highlands of New Guinea, in both [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]] and [[Papua New Guinea]]. For example, in West Papua today, there is an [[Koteka Tribal Assembly|Assembly of Koteka Tribes]]. The term ''koteka'' was never used to identify a society or ethnic group before, but it is now commonly known for a [[tribal group]] within [[Melanesia]] across the [[New Guinea Highlands|highlands of New Guinea]].

== Sexuality ==
It is commonly assumed that there is a sexual display element to wearing the koteka; however, according to the locals, kotekas are worn only to cover themselves.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

== Attempted eradication ==
In 1971–1972 the Indonesian government launched "Operasi Koteka" ("Operation Penis Gourd") which consisted primarily of trying to encourage the people to wear shorts and shirts because such clothes were considered more "modern." But the people did not have changes of clothing, did not have soap, and were unfamiliar with the care of such clothes so the unwashed clothing caused skin diseases. There were also reports of men wearing the shorts as hats and the women using the dresses as carrying bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-17388460.html|title=Cover up.(modernization programs in Iran Jaya province in Indonesia)|date=29 July 1995|publisher=The Economist (US)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually the campaign was abandoned. Nevertheless, western clothing is required in government buildings, and children are required to wear western clothing in school.

== Different uses ==
[[File:Lonka-lonka.jpg|thumb|Lonka Lonka]]
Phallocrypts are decorative penis sheaths worn in parts of [[New Guinea]] during traditional ceremonies. They are usually made out of gourds or woven fibers and decorated with feathers, beads, [[cowry]] shells, and small metal ornaments. The most elaborate phallocrypts are sold to tourists as souvenirs and are not usually representative of ones actually used in ceremonies.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

A phallocrypt can also be a simple ornament hung from male [[genitalia]] as part of a cultural expression, for ceremonial use or pure decoration. Among a number of ancient and modern people throughout the [[Oceania|Oceanic]] world, Africa and many parts of the Americas it was (and still is in some places) a common form of ornamentation. Some Aboriginal peoples of Australia wore an ornate carved pearl shell type called a Lonka Lonka. It is hung from the genitals by a twisted thong made of human hair. They are often ornately engraved with mainly geometric patterns and the grooves were colored with reddish ochre. Some South American cultures actually hung heavy, carved jade and other hardstone ornaments from piercings through the skin of their penis and scrotum. These were usually of a temporary ritualistic nature.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}
===South America and Africa===
Some native South American tribes have used them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.se/books?id=X-AkAk9yW_sC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=penis+sheath+-Guinea+-koteka&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK-7TftPfXAhWGBZoKHQxqB9UQ6AEIPDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=penis+sheath&amp;f=false|title=Advances in the Study of Behavior|date=26 March 1979|publisher=Academic Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly in Brazil and the Amazon rainforest area.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.se/books?id=X-AkAk9yW_sC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=penis+sheath+-Guinea+-koteka&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK-7TftPfXAhWGBZoKHQxqB9UQ6AEIPDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=penis%20sheath&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of penis gourds has also been documented in tropical Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Heiser CB (1979) The Gourd Book. University of Oklahoma Press, p. 145-160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heiser CB (1973). The penis gourd of New Guinea. ''[[Annals of the Association of American Geographers]]'' '''63''': 312–318.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
Penis sheaths were sometimes worn by ancient Romans, often by singers since it was believed that it helped preserve their voice, but also by slaves or regular people to avoid sex.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.se/books?id=lSyY-OWFuGIC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=roman+penis+fibula&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjY6tTNzvbXAhXDF5oKHS73AbsQ6AEIRDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=penis%20sheath&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

'''LGBT linguistics''' is the [[linguistics|study of language]] revolving around people identifying as [[gay]], [[lesbian]], [[bisexuality|bisexual]], [[transgender]], and [[queer]] ([[LGBT|LGBTQ]]). Related or [[synonym]]ous terms include '''lavender linguistics''', advanced by [[William Leap]] in the 1990s, which "encompass[es] a wide range of everyday language practices" in [[LGBT community|LGBTQ communities]],&lt;ref name="socioling_dict"&gt;Swann, Joan, Ana Deumert, Theresa Lillis and Rajend Mesthrie. ''A Dictionary of Sociolinguistics''. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and '''queer linguistics''', which more specifically refers to linguistics overtly concerned with exposing [[heteronormativity]].&lt;ref&gt;Milani, Tomasso M. "[https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/blog.nus.edu.sg/dist/d/3920/files/2016/10/Milani_2017-1g9k22t.pdf Language and Sexuality]". ''The Oxford Handbook of Language and Society''. Oxford University Press, 2017-01-05. Oxford Handbooks Online. 2016-12-05.

==History==
Early studies in the field of LGBT linguistics were dominated by the concept of distinct "lavender lexicons" such as that recorded by [[Gershon Legman]] in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Legman, G.  "The Language of Homosexuality: An American Glossary", ''in'' George W. Henry, ''Sex Variants'' (New York: Paul B. Hoeber, 1941)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kul&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kulick | first1 = Don | year = 2000 | title = Gay and Lesbian Language | url = | journal = Anthropology Annual Review | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 243–85 | doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.29.1.243}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 William Leap, whose work incorporates LGBTQ culture studies, cultural theory, and [[linguistics]], called for scholarship to move toward a fuller and more nuanced study of LGBTQ language use.&lt;ref&gt;Leap, William L. ''Beyond the Lavender Lexicon.'' Newark: Gordon &amp; Breach, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Anna Livia and Kira Hall have noted that while research in the 1960s and 1970s on the difference between men's and women's speech made the implicit assumption that gender was the relevant way to divide the social space, there is still considerable room for linguistic research based on [[sexual orientation]], rather than gender.&lt;ref&gt;Livia, Anna and Kira Hall. ''Queerly Phrased: Language, Gender, and Sexuality.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accents==
===Gay males===
{{main|Gay male speech}}
Linguistics research, particularly within [[North American English]], has revealed a number of phonetically salient features used by many gay men, some of which adhere to stereotypes. Studies have repeatedly confirmed that male American English speakers are recognized as gay by their speech at rates above chance. Relevant features include what is popularly known as a [[gay lisp]]: in fact, the articulation of {{IPAc-en|s}} and {{IPAc-en|z}} with a higher frequency and longer duration than average speakers. Also, gay men may tend to [[raising (phonetics)|lower]] the [[Lexical set#Wells Standard Lexical Sets for English|{{sc2|trap}}]] and {{sc2|dress}} [[front vowel]]s, especially in "fun" or casual social situations. Many gay speech characteristics match those that other speakers use when trying to speak especially clearly or carefully, including (over-)enunciating and widening the vowel spaces in the mouth. The notion that some gay male speech entirely imitates women's speech is inaccurate, though certain vocal qualities are certainly shared between the two speech styles.&lt;ref&gt;Munson, B., McDonald, E.C., &amp; DeBoe, N.L., &amp; White, A.R. (2006). The acoustic and perceptual bases of judgments of women and men's sexual orientation from read speech. Journal of Phonetics.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also shown unique speech of gay men in other languages, such as [[Puerto Rican Spanish]] and [[Flemish Dutch]].

===Lesbians===
[[Speech scientist]] [[Benjamin Munson (professor)|Benjamin Munson]] confirmed such features among lesbians as the use of lower pitch and more direct communication styles found in previous studies,&lt;ref name="atkins"&gt;Atkins, Dawn (1998) "Looking Queer: Body Image and Identity in Lesbian, Bisexual, Gay, and Transgender Communities"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23876941 | doi=10.1016/j.jvoice.2013.04.008 | volume=27 | issue=5 | title=Pitch and pitch variation in lesbian women | date=Sep 2013 | journal=J Voice | pages=656.e13–6| author1=Van Borsel | first1=J | last2=Vandaele | first2=J | last3=Corthals | first3=P }}&lt;/ref&gt; plus more backed variants of [[back vowel]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Munson et al., 2006, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; but he noted too that differences between lesbians and straight women are "even more subtle" than differences between gay and straight men.&lt;ref&gt;Munson et al., 2006, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; In one English-language experiment, listeners were unable to identify female speakers as either lesbian or straight based solely on voice.&lt;ref name=moon&gt;Moonwomon, Birch. "Toward a Study of Lesbian Speech." ''Queerly Phrased: Language, Gender, and Sexuality.'' Ed. Anna Livia and Kira Hall. New York: Oxford University Press, 1997. 202–213&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kul/&gt; At the same time, lesbian speech studies have long been neglected, making introductory research difficult.&lt;ref name="Eckert, McConnell-Ginet"/&gt; Another study showed that speakers' self-assessed "familiarity with [[queer]] [[LGBT culture|culture]]" had a statistically significant correlation with phonetic variation like lower median pitch and faster rate of speech, though mostly for straight women, somewhat for bisexual women, and not at all for lesbians. The study's author theorized that the straight women, aware of the study's purpose, may have been attempting to express their affinity with lesbians by adopting their stereotype of a lower pitch.&lt;ref name=barr&gt;Barron-Lutzross, Auburn. (2015). The Production and Perception of a Lesbian Speech Style. UC Berkeley: Department of Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; Another experiment found that listeners indeed were able to accurately judge female speakers on a scale from "least" to "most likely to be a lesbian" (the slight lesbian and bisexual differences approaching statistical significance), perceiving the straight women as significantly more feminine, bisexual speakers as only slightly more, and lesbians as correlated with lower median pitch, wider pitch range, lower second formant, and more use of [[creaky voice]]. However, no direct correlations between these phonetic variables and sexual orientation were found, perhaps with listeners identifying other features that were not tested.&lt;ref name=barr/&gt;

Linguist [[Robin Queen]] argues that analyses have been too simplistic and that a uniquely lesbian language is constructed through the combination of sometimes-conflicting [[style (sociolinguistics)|stylistic tropes]]: stereotypical women's language (e.g. hypercorrect grammar), stereotypical nonstandard forms associated with the (male) working class (e.g. contractions), stereotypical gay male lexical items, and stereotypical lesbian language (e.g. flat intonation, cursing). Sometimes lesbians deliberately avoid stereotypical female speech, according to Queen, in order to distance themselves from "normative" heterosexual female speech patterns.&lt;ref name=queen&gt;Queen, Robin M. "'I Don't Speek Spritch': Locating Lesbian Language". ''Queerly Phrased: Language, Gender, and Sexuality''. Ed. Anna Livia and Kira Hall. New York: Oxford University Press, 1997. 233–256&lt;/ref&gt; Because femininity is a [[markedness|marked style]], adopting it is more noticeable than avoiding it, which may add to the lack of [[social salience|socially salient]] styles for lesbians in contrast with socially identifiable stereotypically gay male speech.&lt;ref name=cam/&gt; However, lesbians may have more slang than gay males, with one article listing nearly eighty common lesbian slang words for sexual acts and organs.&lt;ref name=Ashley1982&gt;{{cite web|title=Dyke Diction: The Language of Lesbians|last=Ashley|first=Leonard R.N.|year=1982|work=Maledicta|pages=123–62}} "What [[H. L. Mencken]] said of nuns in cloisters, that they have developed their own slang (amusing but of course genteel) can, on the whole, be said of lesbians."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transgender linguistics==
Speech features of [[transgender]] people include dissociating specific physical or gender-specific characteristics of genital terms, including using certain words for specific genitalia in broader ways or as all-purpose terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language and Identities|last=Zimman|first=Lal|last2=Hall|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780748635788|location=Edinburgh|pages=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physical voices of [[trans men]] (and [[transmasculine]]) and  [[Trans woman|trans women]] (and [[transfeminine]]) individuals is often but not always affected by social and medical transition, including through [[voice training]], [[tracheal shave]]s, [[Estrogen|feminizing hormones]], [[Testosterone (medication)|masculinizing hormones]], or other drugs, all of which can alter [[Sociolinguistics|sociolingustic]] characteristics. A 2006 study noted that, after undergoing five [[Vocal resonation#The oral cavity|oral resonance]] sessions targeted at lip spreading and forward tongue carriage, ten [[transfeminine]] individuals demonstrated a general increase in the [[formant frequency]] values F1, F2, and F3 as well as the [[fundamental frequency]] value F0,{{clarify|reason=Laypersons will have no idea what this means.|date=April 2018}} thus more closely approximating the desired vocal frequency of [[cisgender]] women.&lt;ref&gt;Carew, Lisa, Georgia Dacakis, and Jennifer Oates. "The Effectiveness of Oral Resonance Therapy on the Perception of Femininity of Voice in Male-to-Female Transsexuals." Journal of Voice 21.5 (2007): 591603. ScienceDirect. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 doctorate dissertation followed fifteen [[transmasculine]] individuals from the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in a long-term study focused on [[formant frequency|formant]] and [[fundamental frequency]], for one to two years after the start of masculinizing [[hormone replacement therapy]] (HRT), concluding that all ten underwent a drop in fundamental frequency in the early stages of HRT but that social factors also probably affected many of the changes in voice and mannerisms.&lt;ref&gt;Zimman, Lal. "Voices in Transition: Testosterone, Transmasculinity, and the Gendered Voice among Female-to-Male Transgender People." Thesis. University of Colorado, 2012. Voices in Transition: Testosterone, Transmasculinity, and the Gendered Voice among Female-to-Male Transgender People. Academia.edu. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nonbinary]] individuals (including [[genderqueer]], [[agender]], [[bigender]], [[genderfluid]], etc.) may perform gender in a unique way through speech. [[Gender-specific and gender-neutral pronouns#Preferred pronouns|Neopronouns]], [[pronoun]]s which avoid indexing gender and/or index a nonbinary gender identity, originated in the late 1800s as "thon" and "e"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=That Impersonal Pronoun|last=Rogers|first=James|publisher=Editorial. Comp. William Henry Hills The Writer|year=1980|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to people without defining gender. Newer pronouns, include "ee," "em," "[[Gender-specific and gender-neutral pronouns|xe]]," and "ve", as well as new words for traditionally gender-expressing relationships.

==Slang==
{{main|LGBT slang|List of LGBT slang}}
Specialized dictionaries that record gay and lesbian slang tend to revolve heavily around sexual matters, which may reflect the publications' methodological assumptions about the hyper-sexuality of conversations among LGBT people.&lt;ref name="Jacobs"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Greg Jacobs | year = 1996 | title = Lesbian and Gay Male Language Use: A Critical Review of the Literature | journal = American Speech | volume = 71 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–71 | doi = 10.2307/455469| jstor = 455469 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study showed gay pornographic imagery to men and asked them to discuss the imagery, finding that conversations between gay men used more slang and fewer commonly-known terms about sexual behavior than conversations where both participants were heterosexual males or where the pair consisted of one heterosexual and one homosexual male.&lt;ref name="Lumby"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lumby|first=Malcolm E.|title=Code Switching and Sexual Orientation: A Test of Bernstein's Sociolinguistic Theory|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|year=1976|volume=1|issue=4|pages=383–399|doi=10.1300/j082v01n04_03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methodological issues of this study may include that the findings reflect homophobia among the heterosexual participants.&lt;ref name="Jacobs" /&gt;

Studies have also been done into whether words used within the gay community are understood by heterosexuals. A study of Deaf sign language users showed that all the gay male participants understood the sign for a [[Gay bathhouse|bathhouse]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and that 83% of lesbians knew the sign. This compared to zero heterosexual men and only one out of eleven heterosexual women knowing the sign.&lt;ref name="RudnerButowsky"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rudner|first=William A.|author2=Rochelle Butowksy |title=Signs Used in the Deaf Gay Community|journal=Sign Language Studies|year=1981|volume=30|pages=36–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Dyke" ===
{{main|Dyke (slang)}}
One prominent example of LGBT slang is the rising [[reappropriation]] among lesbians of the word "[[Dyke (slang)|dyke]]". Though still in many contexts considered [[pejorative]], dyke has become a symbol for increasing acceptance of the lesbian movement and identity. Lesbians themselves use it to further solidarity and unity among their community. Examples include dyke marches (female-exclusive [[pride parade]]s), "dykes with tykes" (describing lesbian motherhood), and [[Dykes on Bikes]] (a motorcycle group that traditionally leads the [[San Francisco Pride]] parade). Like other minorities, female homosexuals are slowly reclaiming a word that was once used to hurt them in the past.&lt;ref name=Ashley1982/&gt;  This even had legal repercussions, in that the "Dykes on Bikes" group was formally known as the "Women's Motorcycle Contingent" since they were refused the right to register under their preferred name by the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]], until 2006 when they finally were able to trademark the name, having persuaded the Office that "dyke" was not an offensive word.&lt;ref name="Raab 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raab |first=Barbara |title=Dyke Drama: A not-so-excellent adventure through U.S. trademark law |journal=American Sexuality magazine |publisher=National Sexuality Resource Center |date=2006-04-20 |url=http://nsrc.sfsu.edu/MagArticle.cfm?Article=601&amp;PageID=0 |accessdate=2007-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701205735/http://nsrc.sfsu.edu/MagArticle.cfm?Article=601&amp;PageID=0 |archivedate=2007-07-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NCLR Winter 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Center for Lesbian Rights |authorlink=National Center for Lesbian Rights |title=What's in a Name? |journal=NCLR Newsletter |volume=2006 |issue=Winter |pages=1 |year=2006 |quote='On November 13th, the Women's Motorcycle Contingent formally won the legal right to trademark "DYKES ON BIKES." }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories about the reasons for differences in language use==
Traditionally it was believed that one's way of speaking is a result of one's identity, but the [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] approach reversed this theory to suggest that the way we talk is a part of identity formation, specifically suggesting that [[gender identity]] is variable and not fixed.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, Deborah. "Performing Gender Identity: Young Men's Talk and the Construction of Heterosexual Masculinity." ''Language and Masculinity''. Ed. Sally Johnson and Ulrike Hanna Meinhof. Malden: Blackwell Publishers Ltd., 1997. 47–64&lt;/ref&gt;{{verification needed|date=May 2018}} In the early 20th century sexuality-related theories about language were common (for example, [[Freud]] and his theories of [[psychoanalysis]]), using a quite different basis from that used by modern studies on this topic.  One of these early views was that homosexuality was a [[Psychopathology|pathology]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} In the 1980s, however the LGBTQ community was increasingly viewed as an oppressed minority group, and scholars began to investigate the possibility of characterizing gay language use in a different way, influenced in part by studies of [[African-American Vernacular English]]. There was a shift in beliefs from language being a result of identity to language being employed to ''reflect'' a shared social identity and even to ''create'' sexual or gender identities.&lt;ref name=cam/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2018}}

===Language use as performance===
Shared ways of speaking can be used to create a single, cohesive identity that in turn help organize political struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Ruth and Kathleen Wood. "Lesbians in the Living Room: Collusion, Co-Construction, and Co-Narration in Conversation." ''Beyond the Lavender Lexicon''. Ed. Leap, William L.  Newark: Gordon &amp; Breach, 1995. 235–248&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human sexuality|Sexuality]] is one form of [[social identity]], discursively constructed and represented. This shared identity can in some cases be strengthened through shared forms of language use and used for political organizing.  Language can be used to negotiate relations and contradictions of gender and sexual identities, and can [[Indexicality|index]] identity in various ways, even if there is no specific gay or lesbian code of speaking.&lt;ref name=mor&gt;Morrish, Liz and Helen Saunton. ''New Perspectives on Language and Sexual Identity''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Gay men and lesbians may, through the use of language, form speech communities. A [[speech community]] is a community that shares linguistic traits and tends to have community boundaries that coincide with social units.  Membership in speech communities is often assumed based on stereotypes about the community as defined by non-linguistic factors.&lt;ref name="bar7"/&gt; Speakers may resist culturally dominant language and oppose cultural authority by maintaining their own varieties of speech.&lt;ref name=bar5&gt;Barrett, Rusty. "Supermodels of the World, Unite! Political Economy and the Language of Performance Among African-American Drag Queens." ''Beyond the Lavender Lexicon''. Ed. Leap, William L.  Newark: Gordon &amp; Breach, 1995. 207–226&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gender performativity]] relates to speech in that people may consciously or unconsciously modify their speech styles to conform with their [[gender role]], which men often pick speech styles that reflect the culturally defined standards of masculinity. Gay men may be associated with "femininity" in their speech styles because others perceive that their speech performance doesn't conform with their gender.

For example, in the west, parodies of gay styles employ resources that are heard as hyper-feminine, supporting that gay speech is feminine.&lt;ref name="Eckert, McConnell-Ginet"&gt;Eckert, Penelope; McConnell-Ginet, Sally (2013). Language and Gender (2 ed.). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, because many speech varieties associated with 'masculinity' are learned and not biological, certain gay men may be using a wider variety of speech than a stereotypical 'masculine' male.

These stylistic innovations are made possible by the [[Citationality|iterability]] of speech, and are used to index elements of identity that often do not conform with the [[gender binary]].&lt;ref name="Eckert, McConnell-Ginet" /&gt;  Conversely, lesbian women already have a wider variety of speech available, yet refrain from using a distinctive style of speech.&lt;ref name="Eckert, McConnell-Ginet"/&gt; Masculinity, and speech associated with a heterosexual male, is constrained by cultural expectations for men to avoid '[[abjection]]' (as further elaborated in ''[[Gender Trouble]]'');&lt;ref name="Butler, Judith 2007"&gt;Butler, Judith. Gender trouble. Routledge, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; power differences amongst the genders may lead to speakers adopting different speech styles that conform with their identities, or expected [[gender performance]]s (e.g. adolescent males often use the term 'fag' to police one another, which challenges their sexual orientation through gender performance, and reinforces the avoidance of the 'abject' or femininity).&lt;ref&gt;Pascoe, Cheri Jo. "'Dude, you're a fag':

Adolescent masculinity and the fag discourse." Sexualities 8.3 (2005): 329-346.&lt;/ref&gt;  'Masculine' speech is associated with non-feminine sounding speech and because some gay men may not wish to identify with straight masculine speech in some contexts, they may access other speech styles to convey their identity (because the possibilities have two options, 'masculine' or 'feminine,' to be not-'masculine' is often associated with 'feminine'). The boundary between 'masculine' and 'feminine' is maintained by cultural norms and societal orders, that do not permit masculinity to include femininity, the abject.&lt;ref name="Butler, Judith 2007"/&gt;

Language use can also mimic culturally dominant forms or stereotypes.&lt;ref name=cam/&gt;&lt;ref name=crom&gt;Cromwell, Jason. "Talking About Without Talking About: The Use of Protective Language Among Transvestites and Transsexuals." ''Beyond the Lavender Lexicon''. Ed. Leap, William L.  Newark: Gordon &amp; Breach, 1995.267–296&lt;/ref&gt; Performing identity can only work as long as the indexes used are conventional and socially recognized, which is why stereotypes are sometimes adopted.&lt;ref name=kul/&gt; Community members can establish their affiliation with the group through shared ways of speaking, acting, and thinking.  Such discourses may in turn reproduce or modify social relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Moonwomon, Birch. "Lesbian Discourse, Lesbian Knowledge." ''Beyond the Lavender Lexicon''. Ed. Leap, William L.  Newark: Gordon &amp; Breach, 1995. 45–64&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, however, such a code may fall out of use when it becomes widely known and therefore no longer exclusive, as occurred with [[Polari]] after it was used on the [[BBC]].&lt;ref name=cam/&gt;

In a particular example of how this process of language community formation happens in a specific LGBTQ community, transsexuals and [[transvestism|transvestites]] may use vocabulary that includes members and excludes non-members to establish social identity and solidarity and to exclude outsiders.  As these social groups are particularly likely to be viewed negatively by outsiders, the use of a private language can serve to keep membership in the group a secret to outsiders while allowing group members to recognize their own.&lt;ref name=crom/&gt;

Some members of a community may use stylistic and [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] devices to index and exaggerate orientations and identities, but others may deliberately avoid stereotypical speech.&lt;ref name=crom/&gt;  Gender is frequently indexed indirectly, through traits that are associated with certain gender identities.  In this way, for example, speaking forcefully is associated with [[masculinity]] but also with confidence and authority.&lt;ref name=cam/&gt;{{clarify|date=May 2012}} Similarly, LGBTQ speech has a relationship with the speaker's [[community of practice]]. Speakers may have a shared interest, and respond to a mutual situation, and through communicating regularly they may develop certain speech norms. The innovative speech norms, that LGBTQ folks may use within their communities of practice, can be spread through institutions like schools where person of many classes, races, and genders, come together. These particular speech traits may be spread through the adoption of use by people with association to LGBTQ identities.&lt;ref name="Eckert, McConnell-Ginet" /&gt;

===Goals of distinctive language use among gay men===
People often are members of multiple communities, and which community they want to be most closely associated with may vary.  For some gay men, the primary self-categorization is their identity as gay men.  To achieve recognition as such, gay men may recognize and imitate forms of language that reflect the social identity of gay men, or which are stereotypically considered to be characteristic to gay men.&lt;ref name=bar7/&gt;  For example, the use of female [[pronouns]] dissociates gay men from heterosexual norms and designates them in opposition to heterosexual masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;Livia, Anna. "Disloyal to Masculinity: Linguistic Gender and Liminal Identity in French." ''Queerly Phrased: Language, Gender, and Sexuality''. Ed. Anna Livia and Kira Hall. New York: Oxford University Press, 1997. 349–368&lt;/ref&gt;  The reason for using female pronouns and the frequency of use may vary, however. For example, they may be used only in jest, or may be used more seriously to stabilize a group of gay men and bond its members together.&lt;ref&gt;Graf, Roman and Barbara Lippa. "The Queens' English." ''Beyond the Lavender Lexicon''. Ed. Leap, William L.  Newark: Gordon &amp; Breach, 1995. 227–234&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goals of distinctive language use among lesbians and heterosexual women===
The development of gay identity may differ for men and women. For many women, regardless of orientation, female identity is more important than sexual identity. Where gay men feel a need to assert themselves against male heterosexual norms, lesbians may be more concerned about [[sexism]] than about lesbian identity.&lt;ref name=zwick&gt;Zwicky, Arnold M. "Two Lavender Issues for Linguists." ''Queerly Phrased: Language, Gender, and Sexuality''. Ed. Anna Livia and Kira Hall. New York: Oxford University Press, 1997. 21–34&lt;/ref&gt;

Most studies of lesbian speech patterns focus on conversational patterns, as in Coates and Jordan (1997) and Morrish and Saunton (2007). Women draw on a variety of discourses, particularly [[feminist]] discourses, to establish themselves as not submissive to [[heteropatriarchy]] by using cooperative all-female talk, which is marked by less distinct turns and a more collaborative conversational environment.  Often the conversational bond between women overrides their sexual identities.&lt;ref&gt;Coates, Jennifer, and Mary Ellen Jordan. "Que(e)rying Friendship: Discourses of Resistance and the Construction of Gendered Subjectivity." ''Queerly Phrased: Language, Gender, and Sexuality''. Ed. Anna Livia and Kira Hall. New York: Oxford University Press, 1997. 214–232&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the content of lesbian discourse can separate those who use it from [[heteronormativity]] and the values of dominant cultures.  Collaborative discourse involves resisting dominant [[gender norms]] through more subtle creation of solidarity, and not necessarily resisting “gender-typical” linguistic behavior.&lt;ref name=mor/&gt;

An example of a distinctive way of speaking for a female community is that of female bikers. [[Dykes on Bikes]], a mostly lesbian group, and Ladies of Harley, a mostly heterosexual group, have demonstrated shared experiences. Though the two cultures differ, both have a focus on female bonding and motorcycles and have a shared female biker language.  Their shared language helps to establish their shared identity in a largely male-dominated domain and to mark boundaries between them and traditional femininity.&lt;ref&gt;Joans, Barbara. "Dykes on Bikes Meet Ladies of Harley." ''Beyond the Lavender Lexicon''. Ed. Leap, William L.  Newark: Gordon &amp; Breach, 1995. 87–106&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changing styles of speech===
Changing speech styles, or [[code-switching]], can indicate which identity individuals want to put forward as primary at a given time.  Choices of language use among gay men depend on the audience and context,&lt;ref name=zwick/&gt; and shift depending on situational needs such as the need to demonstrate or conceal gay identity in a particular environment.  Likewise, lesbians may foreground lesbian identity in some contexts but not in others.&lt;ref name=mor/&gt; Podesva discusses an example of code-switching where a gay lawyer is being interviewed about anti-gay discrimination on the radio, so he balances the need to sound recognizably gay and the need to sound recognizably educated, since "gay speech" tends to be associated with frivolity and lack of education.&lt;ref name="pod"&gt;Podesva, Robert J., Sarah J. Roberts, and Kathryn Campbell-Kibler. "[http://web.stanford.edu/class/linguist156/Podesva_etal_2001.pdf Sharing Resources and Indexing Meanings in the Production of Gay Styles]." ''Language and Sexuality: Contesting Meaning in Theory and Practice'' (2001): 175–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

“Exploratory switching” can be used to determine whether an interlocutor shares the speaker's identity.  For example, a gay man might use certain key words and mannerisms generally known by the community as a test to see whether they are recognized by the interlocutor.  This allows the gay man to establish solidarity with a community member previously unknown to him without having to disclose his orientation to a heterosexual and potentially hostile person. However, inconsistency of language use between different sub-groups of the LGBTQ community, along with the existence of non-members who may be familiar with a gay mode of speech, can make such exploratory switching unreliable.&lt;ref name=bar7/&gt;

People may also use code-switching to comment on society or for entertainment. Black drag performers often use stereotypical “female white English” to disrupt societal assumptions about gender and ethnicity and to express criticisms of these assumptions.  Imitations do not necessarily represent actual language use of a group, but rather the generally recognized stereotypical speech of that group. In the language of drag performers, language play is also marked by juxtaposition of contradictory aspects such as very proper language mixed with obscenities, adding to the queens' and kings' deliberate disruption of cultural and linguistic norms.&lt;ref name=bar5/&gt;

===Issues with studying speech patterns in relation to sexuality and sexual identity===
[[Don Kulick]] argues that the search for a link between sexual identity categories and language is misplaced, since studies have failed to show that the language gay men and lesbians use is unique. Kulick argues that though some researchers may be politically motivated to imagine a LGBTQ community that is a unified whole and identifiable through linguistic means, this [[speech community]] does not necessarily exist as such. Kulick points out that the LGBTQ community is not homogeneous, nor is its language use. Features of “gay speech” are not used consistently by gay individuals, nor are they consistently absent from the speech of all heterosexual individuals.  Further, Kulick takes issue with frequently circular definitions of queer speech. He argues that speech patterns cannot be labeled LGBTQ language simply because they are used by LGBTQ people.&lt;ref name=kul/&gt;

Studies of a speech community that presuppose the existence of that community may reproduce stereotypes that fail to accurately depict the social reality of variance among subgroups within a community and overlapping identities for individuals. Furthermore, studies of gay male language use often look at [[middle class]] [[European Americans]] who are [[Coming out|out]] as gay to the exclusion of other subgroups of the LGBTQ community, and hence may draw misleading conclusions about the community as a whole.&lt;ref name=bar7&gt;Barrett, Rusty. "The "Homo-genius" Speech Community." ''Queerly Phrased: Language, Gender, and Sexuality''. Ed. Anna Livia and Kira Hall. New York: Oxford University Press, 1997. 181–201&lt;/ref&gt;

Rusty Barrett suggests that the idea of the homogeneous speech community could perhaps be more accurately replaced by one of a queer community based on community spirit or a queer cultural system, since language use varies so greatly.&lt;ref name=bar7/&gt; Kulick proposes, instead of studying speech communities that he concludes "do not and cannot exist" because of methodological problems, researchers should study "language and desire" through examining repression in the context of linguistics, considering both what is said and what is not or cannot be said.&lt;ref name=kul/&gt; Kulick addresses the need for consideration of the role of sexuality in sexual identity, unlike some lavender linguists who neglect sexuality in favor of linguistic features that might be more likely than sexuality to legitimize gay identity.&lt;ref name=cam&gt;Cameron, Deborah, and Don Kulick. 2003. ''Language and Sexuality''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2018}}

==Issues with over-generalizations about sexual identities and linguistic styles==
This section explores how traditional approach to the study of language and gender may be flawed and why.

===Inaccuracy of metonymic models===
{{details|Prototype theory}}
[[George Lakoff]] explained the inaccuracy of [[metonymy|metonymic models]], through which people jump to conclusions without sufficient elaboration, giving rise to [[Prototype theory|prototype effects]], in his book ''[[Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things]]''. First of all, we commonly consider typical examples as the better examples of a category. For instance, in the category of fruits, apples and oranges are typical examples. It is common practice that we engage in reasoning by making inferences from typical to non-typical examples. As a matter of fact, an enormous amount of our knowledge about categories of things is organized in terms of typical cases. We constantly draw inferences on the basis of that kind of knowledge. Second, salient examples, which are familiar and memorable, are unconsciously used in our understanding of things. For instance, if one's best friend is a vegetarian and they don't know any others well, they will tend to generalize from their best friend to other vegetarians. This is what Tversky and Kahneman referred to as the "[[conjunction fallacy]]". To understand this notion via [[probability theory]], think of two mutually unrelated events. The theory assumes that the likelihood of the co-occurrence of the two events is lower than that of the occurrence of either, ignoring the fact that the two events are actually unrelated to one another. To understand this with regards to lavender linguistics, just because two individuals are both self-identified bisexual males does not necessarily mean that they must engage in the same linguistic patterns and social styles. The failure to capture this asymmetry between prototypical and non-prototypical cases results in ineffective study of lavender linguistics. Typical and salient examples are just two kinds of metonymic models. Others include social stereotypes, ideal cases, paragons, generators, and submodels.&lt;ref name=Lakoff&gt;{{cite book | last = Lakoff | first = George | year = 1987 | title = Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things: What Categories Reveal about the Mind | pages = 84–90 | publisher = Chiacago: U of Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presence of overlaps===
A significant multitude of scholastic studies have shown that the linguistic styles of [[LGBT|GLB]] and straight people are not mutually exclusive. Munson et al. (2006), for instance, examined the gradient nature of perceived sexual orientation by having 40 listeners rate 44 talkers' sexual orientation on a five-point equally appearing interval scale. The 44 talkers included equal number of GLB and straight people. When averaged across the 40 listeners, ratings for individual talkers showed some overlap between GLB and straight people. For example, the two men who were tied with the most-gay average ratings included one self-identified straight man, and one self-identified gay man. While there are group level differences between GLB and straight people in the gay soundness of their voices, overlap does exist, providing a serious challenge to a simple model in which speech differences were the inevitable consequence of sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=Munson&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Munson | first1 = Benjamin | last2 = Babel | first2 = Molly | year = 2007 | title = Loose Lips and Silver Tongues, Or, Projecting Sexual Orientation Through Speech | pages = 416–419 | journal = Language Ling Compass Language and Linguistics Compass | volume = 1 | issue = 5 | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | doi=10.1111/j.1749-818x.2007.00028.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that there is no clean cut between the linguistic patterns of GLB and straight people suggests that too many generations in the study of language and gender can be dangerous.

===Multiplicity of social identity===
{{details|Social identity theory}}
Contemporary sociolinguistic studies suggest that [[Style (sociolinguistics)|styles]] are learned, rather than assigned at the time of birth. With that said, identities emerge in a time series of social practice, through the combined effects of structure and agency. Because [[Social identity theory|social identities]] are not static, the [[speech community|speech community model]], which was traditionally employed as a sociolinguistic framework in the study of language and gender, is not as reliable as the [[community of practice|community of practice model]], the new framework emerged from [[practice theory]].&lt;ref name=Bucholtz1999a&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bucholtz | first = Mary | year = 1999 | title = "Why be normal?": Language and Identity Practices in a Community of Nerd Girls | pages = 207–210 | journal = Language in Society | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | doi=10.1017/s0047404599002043}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, because social identities are not static, speech styles are actively subject to change, such that one's speech styles have different social meanings across time. Similarly, it is possible for an individual to engage in multiple identity practices simultaneously, and move from one identity to another unconsciously and automatically, and thus the term polyphonous identity.&lt;ref name=Bucholtz1999&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Bucholtz | first1 = Mary | last2 = Liang | first2 = A.C. | last3 = Sutton | first3 = Laurel A. | title = Reinventing Identities: the gendered self in discourse | year = 1999 | publisher = Oxford University Press (US) | pages = 313–331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Podesva (2004) is a paper that studies recordings of a gay medical student, whom he called "Heath", as he moved through different situations in the course of his everyday life. The fact that Heath's pronunciation of the [[Voiceless dental and alveolar stops|voiceless alveolar stop]], /t/, varies when he deals with different groups of people suggest not only some of gay people's speech features, but also the multiplicity of a person's social identity.&lt;ref name=Podesva2004&gt;{{cite journal | last = Podesva | first = Robert | year = 2004 | title = On Constructing Social Meaning with Stop Release Bursts | journal = Sociolinguistics Symposium | volume = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Podesva also examined the relationship between the California Vowel Shift (CVS) and the gay identity, again by investigating intra-speaker patterns in a single individual, Regan, as opposed to inter-speaker variation, and found that Regan, who is a self-identified gay Asian American, realized CVS differently depending on the context, whether it be a "boys' night out", "dinner with friend", or "meeting with supervisor".&lt;ref name=Podesva&gt;{{cite journal | last = Podesva | first = Robert | year = 2011 | title = The California Vowel Shift and Gay Identity | journal = American Speech | volume = 86 | number = 1 | pages = 32–51 | doi=10.1215/00031283-1277501}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cross-situational patterns are critical in the sense that an individual's speech styles can change not only across time, but also across space, depending on which social identity the individual is attempting to engage in under a given situation. Over-generalizations of social identity, however, overlook this intra-speaker variability.

===Examples of non-Western sexual identities and their language use===
According to many language scholars, it is misleading to assume that all sex and gender roles are the same as those that are salient within [[Western society]] or that the linguistic styles associated with given groups will be like the styles associated with similarly identified Western groups.&lt;ref name=buch&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bucholtz | first1 = Mary | last2 = Hall | first2 = Kira | year = 2004 | title = Theorizing Identity in Language Research | url = | journal = Language in Society | volume = 33 | issue = 4| pages = 501–47 | doi=10.1017/s0047404504334020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bakla====
{{details|LGBT culture in the Philippines}}

[[Bakla]]s are homosexual [[Filipinos|Filipino men]], but the concept of bakla identity does not map cleanly to Western male homosexuality. With baklas, as with other non-Western sexual minority groups, sexual identity is very closely related to gender identity. Baklas often assume female attributes and dress like women. They also use female terms for themselves and occasionally for their body parts, and are sometimes referred to and refer to themselves as not being "real men".&lt;ref name=man&gt;Manalansan, Martin F. IV. "'Performing' the Filipino Gay Experiences in America: Linguistic Strategies in a Transnational Context." ''Beyond the Lavender Lexicon: Authenticity, Imagination and Appropriation in Lesbian and Gay Language''. Ed. William L Leap. New York: Gordon and Breach, 1997. 249–266&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they have contact with other gay cultures through technology, bakla culture remains fairly distinct.  They have their own rapidly shifting linguistic code called [[Swardspeak]], which is influenced by Spanish and English loan words.  This code mostly consists of lexical items, but also includes sound changes such as [p] to [f]. Some baklas who move to the United States continue to use this code, but others abandon it, regarding it as a Filipino custom that is out of place abroad and replacing it with aspects of American gay culture.&lt;ref name=man/&gt;

====Hijras====
{{details|Hijra (South Asia)}}

Hijras are Indians who refer to themselves as neither man nor woman.  Some describe hijras as a "[[Third gender|third sex]]". Their identity is distinct from a Western gay or transgender identity, though many hijras have male sexual partners.  There is a distinctive mode of speech often attributed to hijras, but it is stereotypical frequently derogatory.&lt;ref name=buch/&gt;  It is often the standard for Hijras to adopt feminine mannerisms, feminine gender agreement when addressing the self or other Hijaras, and pronouns, depending on context and their interlocutors, to create solidarity or distance.&lt;ref name="Eckert"&gt;Eckert, Penelope; McConnell-Ginet, Sally (2013). Language and Gender (2 ed.). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. pp 218-219.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Kira and Veronica O'Donovan. "Shifting gender positions among Hindi-speaking Hijras." ''Language and Gender: Major Themes in English Studies Vol. III''. Ed. Susan Ehrlich. New York: Routledge, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  They also use stereotypically male elements of speech, such as vulgarity.  Hijras often refer to themselves as masculine in the past tense and females in the present.  Their combined use of masculine and feminine speech styles can be seen as reflecting their ambiguous sexual identities and challenging dominant sexuality and gender ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Kira. "'Go Suck Your Husband's Sugarcane!': Hijras and the Use of Sexual Insult." ''Queerly Phrased: Language, Gender, and Sexuality''. Ed. Anna Livia and Kira Hall. New York: Oxford University Press, 1997. 430–460&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, hijras use grammar as a form of resistance against gender roles.&lt;ref name="Eckert" /&gt;

==WYSIWYG editors==
{{Details|Comparison of HTML editors}}
HTML editors that support What You See Is What You Get ([[WYSIWYG]]) paradigm provide a user interface similar to a [[word processor]] for creating HTML documents, as an alternative to manual coding.

===Word processors===
While [[word processor]]s are not ostensibly HTML editors, the following word processors are capable of opening, editing and saving HTML documents. 
{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}

*[[AppleWorks]]
*[[Microsoft Word]]
*[[LibreOffice Writer]]
*[[OpenOffice.org Writer]]

*[[Kingsoft Office]]
{{Div col end}}

==WYSIWYM editors==
[[WYSIWYM]] (what you see is what you mean) is an alternative paradigm to WYSIWYG, in which the focus is on the semantic structure of the document rather than on the presentation.  These editors produce more logically structured markup than is typical of [[WYSIWYG]] editors, while retaining the advantage in ease of use over hand-coding using a text editor.

'''''The Design and Analysis of Experiments'''''
:'''Author:''' [[Oscar Kempthorne]]
:'''Publication data:''' 1950, [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], New York (Reprinted with corrections in 1979 by Robert E. Krieger)
:'''Description:''' Early exposition of the general linear model using matrix algebra (following lecture notes of George W. Brown). Bases inference on the randomization distribution objectively defined by the experimental protocol, rather than a so-called "statistical model" expressing the subjective beliefs of a statistician: The normal model is regarded as a convenient approximation to the randomization-distribution, whose quality is assessed by theorems about moments and simulation experiments.
:'''Importance:''' The first and most extensive discussion of randomation-based inference in the field of design of experiments until the recent 2-volume work by Hinkelmann and Kempthorne; randomization-based inference is called "design-based" inference in survey sampling of finite populations. Introduced the ''treatment-unit additivity'' hypothesis, which was discussed in chapter 2 of David R. Cox's book on experiments (1958) and which has influenced Donald Rubin and Paul Rosenbaum's analysis of observational data.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54688">In [[Pakistan]], a [[medical school]] is more often referred to as a medical college. A medical college is affiliated with a university as a department which usually has a separate campus. Currently, there are a total of 117 medical colleges in Pakistan, 59 of which are public and 58 private. All but two colleges are listed in [[International Medical Education Directory]].

All medical colleges and universities are regulated by the respective provincial department of health. They however have to be recognized after meeting a set criteria by a central regulatory authority called [[Pakistan Medical and Dental Council]] (PMDC). Entrance into the medical colleges is based on merit under the guidelines of PMDC. Both the academic performance at the [[Higher Secondary School Certificate]](HSSC) (grades 11-12) and an entrance test like [[MCAT Pakistan|MDCAT]] are taken into consideration for the eligibility to enter most of the medical colleges.

Netflix's original productions also include continuations of previously canceled series from other networks, as well as licensing or co-producing content from international broadcasters for exclusive broadcast in other territories, which is also branded in those regions as Netflix original content. Netflix previously produced content through [[Red Envelope Entertainment]].

Netflix's first self-commissioned original content series ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]'' was released in 2013, and the company has dramatically grown its original content since that time. All programming, which is in English unless stated otherwise, is organized by its primary genre or format, and sorted by premiere date.

==Original programming==
These shows had their original production commissioned by Netflix, or had additional seasons commissioned by Netflix.

==Exclusive international television distribution==
{{anchor|Exclusive_US_distribution_shows}}
These television shows, even though Netflix lists them as Netflix originals, are shows that have been aired in different countries, and Netflix has bought exclusive distribution rights to stream them in other various countries. They may be available on Netflix in their home territory and other markets where Netflix does not have the first run license, without the Netflix Original label, some time after their first-run airing on their original broadcaster.

This is a list of active, dormant and extinct [[volcano]]es in [[Australia]] and its island territories. Note that the term volcano is used loosely as it can include groups of related volcanoes and vents that erupted at similar times with lava of related origin. The lists provided below are mainly volcanoes of [[Cenozoic]] aged, with some notable older ([[Mesozoic]] and [[Paleozoic]] aged) volcanoes included. There are no volcanoes on the Australian mainland that have erupted since European settlement, but some volcanoes in Victoria, South Australia, and North Queensland were witnessed by Aboriginal people several thousand years ago.  There are active volcanoes in the [[Heard and McDonald Islands]].

=== Western Australia ===
There are no active or dormant volcanoes in Western Australia, although there are a number of extinct ones, and geological evidence of others. There are nineteen small extinct volcanoes in the valley of the [[Fitzroy River (Western Australia)|Fitzroy River]] in the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] region of [[Western Australia]]. The Kimberley also has a number of groups of [[hot spring]]s, which may be connected with the volcanic activity that produced the extinct volcanoes (but since these volcanic formations are Proterozoic in age - i.e. maybe a billion years old, this would be very unlikely!) . There are also deposits of [[basalt]] at [[Bunbury, Western Australia|Bunbury]] and [[Cape Gosselin]].

The '''Ministry of Education, Culture and Science''' ({{lang-nl|Ministerie van Onderwijs, Cultuur en Wetenschappen}}; OCW) is the [[Ministries of the Netherlands|Dutch Ministry]] responsible for [[Education in the Netherlands|education]], [[Culture of the Netherlands|culture]], [[science]], [[research]], [[gender equality]] and [[communication]]s. The Ministry was created in 1918 as the Ministry of Education, Arts and Sciences and had several name changes before it became the Education, Culture and Science in 1994. The Ministry is headed by the Minister of Education, Culture and Science, currently [[Ingrid van Engelshoven]].

{{Politics of the Netherlands}}

==Responsibilities==
The mission of the ministry is to "work for a smart, able and creative Netherlands". The ministry is responsible for three fields of policy:
* The whole of [[education]], from [[kindergarten]], via [[primary education]] and [[secondary education]] to [[vocational training]] and [[higher education]];
* [[Culture]], [[arts]] and the [[public broadcasting]];
* [[Science]] and [[innovation]].

==Organisation==
The ministry is currently headed by one minister and one [[State Secretary (Netherlands)|State Secretary]]. The ministry's main office is located in the [[Hoftoren]], the tallest building of [[The Hague]]. The ministry has around 2500 civil servants. The civil service is headed by a secretary general and a deputy secretary general, who head a system of three directorates general:
* Primary and Secondary Education;
* Higher Education, Professional Training and Sciences;
* and Culture and Media.

It has several autonomous agencies:
* Central Financial Institution, which is responsible for the execution of financial policies:
* Institute Collection Netherlands;
* National Archive;
* Government Service for Archeology, Cultural Landscape and Monuments;
* Education Inspection;
* Cultural Conservation Inspection;
* Council for Science and Technology; Policy;
* Council for Education;
* and the Council for Culture.

==History==
The predecessor of the ministry, the Ministry of Education, Arts and Sciences was founded in 1918, as it became autonomous from the [[Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations]]. It was founded as a result of the resolution of the [[School struggle (Netherlands)|school struggle]], the conflict about the equalisation of the finance for religious and public schools. During the [[Netherlands in World War II|German occupation]] the ministry was renamed Department for Education, Sciences and Cultural Conservation and a separate Department for Propaganda and Arts. In 1965 the department for arts was integrated into the new Ministry of Culture, Recreation and Social Work. In 1982 this cultural department was integrated into the [[Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport (Netherlands)|Ministry of Health]]. In 1996 cultural department returned to the Ministry of Education.

'''Pad Abort Test 1''' was the first [[pad abort test|abort test]] of the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] spacecraft on November 7, 1963.

==Objectives==
Pad Abort Test 1 was a mission to investigate the effects on the Apollo spacecraft during an abort from the pad. The [[Apollo spacecraft#Launch Escape System .28LES.29|launch escape system]] (LES) had to be able to pull the spacecraft away from an exploding rocket on the launch pad. The LES then had to gain enough altitude to allow the command module's parachutes to open, preferably with the spacecraft over water and not land.

The flight featured a production model LES and a [[Boilerplate (spaceflight)|boilerplate]] (BP-06) Apollo spacecraft, the first mission to feature one. The spacecraft carried no instruments for measuring structural loads as the capsule's boilerplate structure did not represent that of a real spacecraft.

==Flight==
On November 7, 1963, an abort signal was sent to the LES at 09:00:01 local time. This began a sequence in which the main solid rockets fired to lift the spacecraft and smaller attitude rockets fired to move it laterally toward the ocean.

The LES separated after 15 seconds, allowing the spacecraft to take a [[Ballistics|ballistic]] [[trajectory]]. The parachute system worked perfectly: the drogue chute stabilized the spacecraft, then the three main parachutes slowed the descent to a leisurely 26 kilometers per hour.

The only problems found with the flight were that the LES rockets left [[soot]] on the spacecraft exterior and the stability of the spacecraft was less than predicted.

'''Physical model''' (most commonly referred to simply as a '''model''' but in this context distinguished from a [[conceptual model]]) is a smaller or larger physical copy of an object. The object being modelled may be small (for example, an atom) or large (for example, the [[Solar System]]).

The geometry of the model and the object it represents are often [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] in the sense that one is a rescaling of the other; in such cases the [[Scale (measurement)|scale]] is an important characteristic. However, in many cases the similarity is only approximate or even intentionally distorted. Sometimes the [[distortion]] is systematic with e.g. a fixed scale horizontally and a larger fixed scale vertically when modelling [[topography]] of a large area (as opposed to a model of a smaller mountain region, which may well use the same scale horizontally and vertically, and show the true [[slope]]s).

Physical models allow visualization, from examining the model, of information about the thing the model represents.  A model can be a physical object such as an architectural model of a building. Uses of an architectural model include visualization of internal relationships within the structure or external relationships of the structure to the environment.  Other uses of models in this sense are as [[toy]]s.

Instrumented physical models are an effective way of investigating fluid flows for [[Engineering]] design.  Physical models are often coupled with [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]] models to optimize the design of equipment and processes.  This includes external flow such as around buildings, vehicles, people, or [[Hydraulic engineering|hydraulic structures]]. [[Wind Tunnel]] and Water Tunnel testing is often used for these design efforts.  Instrumented physical models can also examine internal flows, for the design of ductwork systems, pollution control equipment, food processing machines, and mixing vessels.  Transparent flow models are used in this case to observe the detailed flow phenomenon.  These models are scaled in terms of both geometry and important forces, for example using [[Froude number]] or [[Reynolds number]] scaling (see [[Similitude (model)]]).

A physical model of something large is usually smaller, and of something very small is larger. A physical model of something that can move, like a [[vehicle]] or [[machine]], may be completely static, or have parts that can be moved manually, or be powered. A physical model may show inner parts that are normally not visible. The purpose of a physical model on a smaller scale may be to have a better overview, for testing purposes, as [[hobby]] or [[toy]]. The purpose of a physical model on a larger scale may be to see the structure of things that are normally too small to see properly or to see at all, for example a model of an [[insect]] or of a [[molecule]].

A physical model of an [[animal]] shows the animals physical composition without it walking or flying away, and without danger, and if the real animal is not available. A soft model of an animal is popular among children and some adults as [[cuddly toy]].some models can be used in different ways as of like prototypes for cars.

A model of a [[person]] may e.g. be a [[doll]], a [[statue]], and in fiction a [[robot]]ic [[humanoid]], e.g. the mechas in the movie ''[[A.I. (movie)|A.I.]]''.

A model is a [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] alternative for a 2D representation such as a [[drawing]] or [[photograph]], or in the case of a [[globe]], a 3D, undistorted alternative for a flat world [[map]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4418">The '''Pluribus'''&lt;ref&gt;''Pluribus'' is the ablative plural of the Latin word for "more" or "above."&lt;/ref&gt; [[multiprocessor]] was an early multi-processor computer designed by [[BBN Technologies|BBN]] for use as a packet switch in the [[ARPANET]]. Its design later influenced the [[BBN Butterfly]] computer.

The Pluribus had its beginnings in 1972 when the need for a second-generation [[Interface Message Processors|interface message processor]] (IMP) became apparent. At that time, the BBN had already installed IMPs at more than thirty-five ARPANET sites. These IMPs were [[Honeywell 316]] and 516 minicomputers. The network was growing rapidly in several dimensions: number of nodes, hosts, and terminals; volume of traffic; and geographic coverage (including plans, now realized, for satellite extensions to [[NORSAR|Europe]] and Hawaii).

A goal was established to design a modular machine which, at its lower end, would be smaller and less expensive than the 316's and 516's while being expandable in capacity to provide ten times the bandwidth of, and capable of servicing five times as many input-output (I/O) devices as, the 516. Related goals included greater memory addressing capability and increased reliability.

The designers decided on a multiprocessor approach because of its promising potential for modularity, for cost per performance advantages, for reliability, and because the IMP packet switch algorithms were clearly suitable for parallel processing by independent processors.

== Hardware ==

A Pluribus consisted of two or more standard 19" electronic equipment racks, each divided into four bays. Each bay contained a backplane bus and an independent power supply. A bay might contain a processor bus, a shared memory bus, or an I/O bus. Custom-built bus couplers connected the bays to one another so that the processors could reach the shared memory and the I/O devices.

A 6-processor Pluribus was used as a network switch to interconnect BBN's five [[TOPS-20|Tenex]]/"Twenex" timesharing systems along with 378 terminals on direct serial and dial-in modem lines. The Pluribus used the Lockheed SUE as its processor. The SUE was similar to DEC's [[PDP-11]].

== Software ==

The Pluribus software implemented [[MIMD]] symmetric multiprocessing. Software processes were implemented using [[Co-operative multitasking|non-preemptive multiprogramming]]. Process scheduling used a hardware device, called the ''pseudo-interrupt device'' or PID, that was accessible to both programs and to I/O devices. Each processor ran its own copy of the process scheduler, which would read an integer value from the PID. The value was used to select the process to run. If a program or device needed to signal another process to run, it would write that process' number into the PID. The PID would emit the highest priority process that anyone had requested, and served them out to all processors.

An important aspect of the Pluribus software was the "STAGE" system, which detected system errors and took steps to recover from them. The processor clocks had interrupt handlers which implemented watchdog timers on all processors. If a processor stopped running, another processor would detect it and initiate a recovery. The recovery process would unlock any [[Lock (computer science)|locks]] placed on shared resources, release allocated storage, and restart all processing on all processors. This was acceptable on an ARPANET routing node, since any lost packets would eventually be retransmitted.

'''Rmetrics''' is a [[Free software|free]], [[open-source software|open-source]] and [[Open source software development|open development]] software project for teaching [[computational finance]]. Rmetrics is based primarily on the [[Statistics|statistical]] [[R (programming language)|R programming language]], but does contain contributions in other programming languages, Fortran, C, and C++. The project was started in 2001 by Diethelm Wuertz, based at the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] in [[Zurich]].

== Rmetrics Packages ==
Most Rmetrics components are distributed as [[R (programming language)|R packages]], which are add-on modules for R.

== Goals ==
The broad goals of the projects are
* to provide widespread access to a broad range of powerful [[Statistics|statistical]] and [[Statistical graphics|graphical]] methods for the analysis of market data and risk management in finance.
* to provide a common [[Computing platform|software platform]] that enables the rapid [[Software development|development]] and [[Software deployment|deployment]] of [[Software extension|extensible]], [[Scalability|scalable]], and [[Interoperability|interoperable]] software.
* to strengthen the scientific understanding by producing high-quality [[Tutorial|documentation and reproducible research]].
* to train researchers on computational and statistical methods for the analysis of financial data and for financial risk management.

== R/Rmetrics Project ==
Rmetrics and the R package system provides a broad range of advantages to the Rmetrics project including
* a high-level [[interpreted language]] in which one can easily and quickly [[Software prototyping|prototype]] new computational methods.
* It includes a well established system for packaging together software components and documentation.
* It can address the diversity and complexity of [[computational finance]] and [[financial engineering]] problems in a common [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented framework]].
* It supports a rich set of statistical [[Computer simulation|simulation]] and [[Statistical model|modeling]] activities.
* It contains cutting edge [[Statistical graphics|data and model visualization]] capabilities.
* It has been the basis for pathbreaking research in [[Parallel computing|parallel statistical computing]].

== Open Source Commitment ==
The Rmetrics project has a commitment to full open source discipline, with distribution via a [[SourceForge.net]]-like platform. All software contributions are expected to exist under an [[open source license]] such as [[GNU General Public License|GPL2]], [[Artistic License|Artistic 2.0]], or [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]]. There are many different reasons why open—source software is beneficial to a software project in finance. The reasons include
* to provide full access to [[algorithm]]s and their implementation
** to facilitate software improvements through [[Software bug|bug fixing]] and [[software extension]]
* to encourage good [[Computational statistics|scientific computing and statistical practice]] by providing appropriate tools and instruction
* to provide a [[Application software|workbench of tools]] that allow researchers to explore and expand the methods used to analyze biological data
* to ensure that the international [[scientific community]] is the owner of the [[Programming tool|software tools]] needed to carry out research
* to lead and encourage commercial support and development of those tools that are successful
* to promote [[Reproducibility|reproducible research]] by providing open and accessible tools with which to carry out that research (reproducible research is distinct from independent verification)
* to encourage users to join the Rmetrics project, either by contributing Rmetrics compliant packages or documentation.

== Rmetrics Repository ==
The [http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/rmetrics Rmetrics Repository] is hosted by R-forge. The following developers (in alphabetical order) contribute or have contributed to the Rmetrics packages: Andrew Ellis, Christophe Dutang, David Lüthi, David Scott, Diethelm Würtz, Francesco Gochez, Juri Hinz, Marco Perlin, Martin Mächler, Maxime Debon, Petr Savicky, Philipp Erb, Pierre Chausse, Sergio Guirreri, Spencer Graves, Yohan Chalabi

'''Scientific misconceptions''' are commonly held [[beliefs]] about science that have no basis in actual [[scientific fact]]. Scientific misconceptions can also refer to preconceived notions based on religious and/or cultural influences. Many scientific misconceptions occur because of faulty teaching styles and the sometimes distancing nature of true scientific texts.

== Types ==
Misconceptions (a.k.a. alternative conceptions, alternative frameworks, etc.) are a key issue from [[constructivism in science education]], a major theoretical perspective informing science teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Taber, K. S. (2011). Constructivism as educational theory: Contingency in learning, and optimally guided instruction. In J. Hassaskhah (Ed.), Educational Theory (pp. 39-61). New York: Nova. From https://camtools.cam.ac.uk/wiki/eclipse/Constructivism.html.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, '''scientific misconceptions''' have their foundations in a few "[[intuitive]] knowledge domains, including [[folkmechanics]] (object boundaries and movements), [[folkbiology]] (biological species' configurations and relationships), and [[folkpsychology]] (interactive agents and goal-directed behavior)",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Altran S |author2=Norenzayan A |title=Religion's evolutionary landscape: Counterintuition, commitment, compassion, communion |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=27 |issue=6 |pages=713–30 |year=2004 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X04000172 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?aid=311512 |pmid=16035401|citeseerx=10.1.1.687.8586 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that enable humans to interact effectively with the world in which they evolved. That these folksciences do not map accurately onto modern scientific theory is not unexpected. A second major source of scientific misconceptions are instruction-induced or [[didaskalogenic]] misconceptions.

There has been extensive research into students' informal ideas about science topics, and studies have suggested reported misconceptions vary considerably in terms of properties such as coherence, stability, context-dependence, range of application etc.&lt;ref&gt;Taber, K. S. (2009). Progressing Science Education: Constructing the scientific research programme into the contingent nature of learning science. Dordrecht: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Misconceptions can be broken down into five basic categories,[https://www.academia.edu/626065/EFFECTS_OF_LEARNER_MISCONCEPTIONS_ON_LEARNING (Alkhalifa, 2006)] 1) preconceived notions; 2) nonscientific beliefs; 3) conceptual misunderstandings; 4) vernacular misconceptions; and 5) factual misconceptions (e.g., Committee on Undergraduate Science Education, 1997).  Preconceived notions are thinking about a concept in only one way.  Specially heat, gravity, and energy.  Once a person knows how something works it is difficult to imagine it working a different way. Nonscientific beliefs are beliefs learned outside of scientific evidence.  For example, one’s beliefs about the history of world based on the bible.  Conceptual misunderstandings are ideas about what one thinks they understand based on their personal experiences or what they may have heard.  One does not fully grasp the concept and understand it.  Vernacular misconceptions happen when one word has two completely different meanings, specially in regard to science and everyday life. Factual misconceptions are ideas or beliefs that are learned at a young age but are actually incorrect.

While most student misconceptions go unrecognized, there has been an informal effort to identify errors and misconceptions present in textbooks. The [http://www.ems.psu.edu/~fraser/BadScience.html Bad Science] web page, maintained by Alistair Fraser, is a good resource. Another important resource is the [http://www.ipn.uni-kiel.de/aktuell/stcse/stcse.html Students' and Teachers' Conceptions and Science Education] (STCSE) website maintained by Reinders Duit. Another useful resource related to chemistry has been compiled by [http://www.rsc.org/education/teachers/learnnet/miscon.htm Vanessa Barker].

== Identifying student misconceptions ==
In the context of [[Socratic instruction]], student misconceptions are identified and addressed through a process of questioning and listening. A number of strategies have been employed to understand what students are [[Belief bias|thinking prior]], or in response, to instruction. These strategies include various forms of "real type" feedback, which can involve the use of colored cards or electronic survey systems (clickers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Martyn M |title=Clickers in the classroom: an active learning approach |journal=Educause Quarterly |volume=30 |issue=2 |year=2007 |url=http://connect.educause.edu/Library/EDUCAUSE+Quarterly/ClickersintheClassroomAnA/40032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach is typified by the strategy known as "[[Just in Time Teaching]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jittdl.physics.iupui.edu/jitt/|title=www.jitt.org|author=|date=|website=jittdl.physics.iupui.edu|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rozycki W |title=Just-in-Time Teaching |journal=J Indiana University Research &amp; Creative Activity |volume=XXII |issue=1 |pages=8 |year=1999 |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~rcapub/v22n1/p08.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here students are asked various questions prior to class, the instructor uses these responses to adapt his or her teaching to the students' prior knowledge and misconceptions.

Finally, there is a more research-intensive approach that involves interviewing students for the purpose of generating the items that will make up a [[concept inventory]] or other forms of diagnostic instruments.&lt;ref&gt;Taber, K. S. (2002) Chemical misconceptions - prevention, diagnosis and cure, London: Royal Society of Chemistry&lt;/ref&gt; Concept inventories require intensive validation efforts.

While not all the published diagnostic instruments have been developed as carefully as some concept inventories, some two-tier diagnostic instruments (which offer multiple choice distractors informed by misconceptions research, and then ask learners to give reasons for their choices) have been through rigorous development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://camtools.cam.ac.uk/wiki/eclipse/diagnostic%20instrument%20to%20determine%20a-level%20students%E2%80%99%20understanding%20of%20ionisation%20energy.html|title=The ECLIPSE Project|website=camtools.cam.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In identifying students' misconceptions, first you can identify their preconceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, T.T., &amp; Arsenault, M.

== Addressing student misconceptions ==
A number of lines of evidence suggest that the recognition and revision of student misconceptions involves active, rather than passive, involvement with the material. A common approach to instruction involves meta-cognition, that is to encourage students to think about their thinking about a particular problem. In part this approach requires students to verbalize, defend and reformulate their understanding. Recognizing the realities of the modern classroom, a number of variations have been introduced. These include [[Eric Mazur]]'s peer instruction, as well as various tutorials in physics developed groups at [http://www.phys.washington.edu/groups/peg/tut.html University of Washington] and the [http://www.physics.umd.edu/perg/abp/ University of Maryland]. Scientific inquiry is another technique that provides an active engagement opportunity for students and incorporates metacognition and critical thinking.

Success with inquiry-based learning activities relies on a deep foundation of [[factual knowledge]]. Students then use observation, imagination, and [[reasoning]] about scientific phenomena they are studying to organize knowledge within a conceptual framework.&lt;ref name=Bransford&gt;Bransford , J. D., Brown, A. L., &amp; Cocking, R. R. (2000). ''[[How People Learn: Brain, Mind, Experience, and School (expanded edition)|How people learn: Brain, mind, experience, and school]]''.

How Students Learn: History, Mathematics and Science in the Classroom. Washington, D.C.: The National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The teacher monitors the changing concepts of the students through formative assessment as the instruction proceeds. Beginning inquiry activities should develop from simple concrete examples to more abstract.&lt;ref name="Bransford2005" /&gt; As students progress through inquiry, opportunities should be included for students to generate, ask, and discuss challenging questions. According to Magnusson and Palincsan,&lt;ref&gt;Magnusson, S.J. &amp; Palincsar, A.S. (Eds).(2005). "Teaching to Promote the Development of Scientific Knowledge and Reasoning About Light at the Elementary School Level". How Students Learn: History, Mathematics and Science in the Classroom. Washington, D.C.: The National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt; teachers should allow multiple cycles of investigation where students can ask the same questions as their understanding of the concept matures. Through strategies that apply formative assessment of student learning and adjust accordingly, teachers can help redirect scientific misconceptions.

Wolpoff (2010). ''Book Review: The 10,000 Year Explosion: How Civilizations Accelerated Human Evolution.

==Opinions in book==
Cochran and Harpending put forward the idea that the [[Neolithic Revolution|development of agriculture]] has caused an enormous increase in the rate of human evolution, including numerous evolutionary [[adaptation]]s to the different challenges and lifestyles that resulted. Moreover, they argue that these adaptations have varied across different human [[populations]], depending on factors such as when the various groups developed agriculture, and the extent to which they mixed genetically with other population groups.&lt;ref name="10K"/&gt;

Such changes, they argue, include not just well-known physical and biological adaptations such as [[Human skin color|skin colour]], disease resistance, and [[lactose intolerance|lactose tolerance]], but also [[personality]] and [[cognition|cognitive]] adaptations that are starting to emerge from genetic research. These may include tendencies towards (for example) reduced physical strength, enhanced long-term planning, or increased docility, all of which may have been counter-productive in [[hunter-gatherer]] societies, but become favoured adaptations in a world of agriculture and its resulting trade, governments and [[urbanization]]. These adaptations are even more important in the modern world, and have helped shape today's [[nation states]]. The authors speculate that the [[Scientific Revolution|scientific]] and [[Industrial Revolution]]s came about in part due to genetic changes in Europe over the past millennium, the absence of which had limited the progress of science in [[Ancient Greece]]. The authors suggest we would expect to see fewer adaptive changes among the [[Amerindians]] and [[sub-Saharan Africans]], who have farmed for the shortest times and were genetically isolated from older civilizations by geographical barriers. In groups that had remained foragers, such as the [[Australian Aborigines]], there would presumably be no such adaptations at all. This may explain why [[Indigenous Australians]] and many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] have characteristic health problems when exposed to modern Western diets. Similarly, Amerindians, Aboriginals, and [[Polynesians]], for example, had experienced very little infectious disease. They had not evolved immunities as did many [[Old World]] dwellers, and were decimated upon contact with the wider world.&lt;ref name="10K"/&gt;

==Summary==
{{see|Recent human evolution}}
The book's main thesis is that human [[civilization|civilisation]] greatly accelerated increases in the rates of evolution. The authors begin their discussion by providing two quotes they feel portray the conventional wisdom on this topic. First, they quote [[Ernst Mayr]] as stating in 1963: "Something must have happened to weaken the selective pressure drastically. We cannot escape the conclusion that man's evolution towards manness suddenly came to a halt." Second, they quote [[Stephen J. Gould]] as stating in 2000: "There's been no biological change in humans in 40,000 or 50,000 years. Everything we call culture and civilization we've built with the same body and brain."

This had become the established viewpoint—when modern humans appeared, evolution was essentially over. The received wisdom is based on the [[doctrine]] that human minds are the same, everywhere: [[Adolf Bastian|Bastian]]'s ''Psychic Unity of Mankind''.  Unfortunately, the authors find, this is no more than wishful thinking.  Were it true, human bodies would also be the same worldwide, which clearly they are not. [[Finns]] cannot be mistaken for [[Zulus]], nor Zulus for Finns.&lt;ref name=10K&gt;The 10,000 Year Explosion: How Civilizations Accelerated Human Evolution (2009). Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending. Basic Books, New York, NY, USA&lt;/ref&gt; Not only are there strong reasons to believe that significant human evolution is theoretically possible, or even likely; it is completely obvious that it has taken place, since people are different from one another.

The first four of the book’s seven chapters serve as a preamble to the final three. First, Cochran and Harpending present evidence for recent, accelerated human evolution after the invention of agriculture. In itself, this argument represents a [[paradigm shift]], albeit one that now has clear data to back it up.&lt;ref name="Seed"/&gt;  The [[International HapMap Project]] and other studies have shown that [[Selection (biology)|selection]] is ongoing and has accelerated over time. This has been a key discovery in human biology, and Cochran and Harpending, building on their own work and that of others such as [[John D. Hawks|John Hawks]] of the University of Wisconsin-Madison,&lt;ref&gt;John Hawks, Eric T. Wang, Gregory M. Cochran, Henry C. Harpending, and Robert K. Moyzis. Recent acceleration of human adaptive evolution. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America of America. Published online before print December 17, 2007, {{doi|10.1073/pnas.0707650104}}.  PNAS December 26, 2007 vol. 104 no. 52 20753-20758.  http://www.pnas.org/content/104/52/20753.short&lt;/ref&gt; tie the advent of agriculture—and the [[Evolutionary pressure|selection pressures]] resulting from the new diets, new modes of habitation, new animal neighbors, and new modes of living that agriculture made possible—to this accelerating evolution.

===Neanderthals===
[[Milford H. Wolpoff|Wolpoff]] writes that Cochran and Harpending continue to refute conventional wisdom in their discussion of the [[Neanderthal]]s. For natural selection to have a chance, they argue, there need to be favourable mutations, or favourable combinations of existing [[allele]]s such as [[gene]]s for blue eyes or pale skin. Cochran and Harpending concentrate on the [[Neolithic Revolution|Neolithic farming revolution]] as the beginning of major population expansions that provided enough mutations to accelerate genetic change. Infectious diseases were another consequence of the [[Cradle of civilization|early urban populations]] and soon became a new source of selection pressures. The origins of many recently adapted genes have now been traced to this period, creating effects such as regional differences in skin colour and skeletal [[gracility]]. Adaptations may have sacrificed muscle strength for higher intelligence&lt;ref name="10K"/&gt; and less aggressive human behaviours. By 5000 years ago, the authors estimate that adaptive alleles were coming into existence at a rate about 100 times faster than during the Pleistocene. This is the ‘‘explosion’’ of the book’s title.&lt;ref name="Wolpoff"/&gt;

Research cited by Cochran and Harpending provides evidence of [[Genetic admixture|genetic mixing]] between modern humans and an [[Archaic humans|ancient Homo]] lineage such as the Neanderthals. It supports the idea that modern humans could have benefited by acquiring adaptive alleles evolved by our Neanderthal relatives - in this case, [[microcephalin]], an adaptive allele associated with brain development. Microcephalin (MCPH1) regulates brain size, and has evolved under strong positive selection in the human evolutionary lineage.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick D. Evans, Sandra L. Gilbert, Nitzan Mekel-Bobrov, Eric J. Vallender, Jeffrey R. Anderson, Leila M. Vaez-Azizi, Sarah A. Tishkoff, Richard R. Hudson and Bruce T. Lahn. Microcephalin, a Gene Regulating Brain Size, Continues to Evolve Adaptively in Humans (2005). ''Science'' 9 September 2005:  Vol. 309, no. 5741, pp. 1717-1720. {{doi|10.1126/science.1113722}}. http://www.sciencemag.org/content/309/5741/1717.abstract&lt;/ref&gt; One genetic variant of Microcephalin, which arose about 37,000 years ago, increased its frequency in modern humans too rapidly to be compatible with [[Neutral theory of molecular evolution|neutral]] [[genetic drift]]. As anatomically modern humans emerged from Africa and spread across the globe, the "indigenous" Homo populations they encountered had already inhabited their respective regions for long periods of time and might have been better adapted to the local environments than the colonizers. It follows that modern humans, although probably superior in their own way, could have benefited from adaptive alleles gained by interbreeding with the populations they replaced, as appears to be the case for the brain-size-determining gene microcephalin.&lt;ref&gt;Evidence that the adaptive allele of the brain size gene microcephalin introgressed into Homo sapiens from an archaic Homo lineage (2005).  Patrick D. Evans, Nitzan Mekel-Bobrov, Eric J. Vallender, Richard R. Hudson, and Bruce T. Lahn. Published online before print November 7, 2006, {{doi|10.1073/pnas.0606966103}}. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. November 28, 2006 vol. 103 no. 48 18178-18183.  http://www.pnas.org/content/103/48/18178.full&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture===
Farming, which, the authors note, produces 10 to 100 times more calories per acre than foraging, carried this trend further. Over the period from 10,000 BC to AD 1, the world population increased about a hundredfold - estimates range from 40 to 170 times. An accelerated rate of evolution is a direct result of the larger human population. More people will have more [[mutation]]s, thereby increasing opportunity for evolutionary change under natural selection. The spread of rapidly expanding populations eventually outpaced the spread of favourable mutations under selection in those populations, so for the first time in human history favourable mutations could not fully disperse throughout the human species. In addition, of course, selection pressures changed once farming was adopted, favouring distinctive adaptations in different geographic areas.&lt;ref name="10K"/&gt;

Farming, rather than just reduced sunlight, may have helped trigger pale skin in Europeans. In a 2007 study, almost all Africans and East Asians have one allele of the [[SLC24A5]] gene, whereas 98% of the Europeans studied had the other.&lt;ref&gt;Science magazine. European Skin Turned Pale Only Recently, Gene Suggest.  20 April 2007. Science, Vol. 316.  www.sciencemag.org {{cite web |url=http://galsatia.files.wordpress.com/2007/04/blanche_paleur.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103171424/http://galsatia.files.wordpress.com//2007//04//blanche_paleur.pdf |archivedate=2010-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These data suggest that a [[selective sweep]] occurred as recently as 5,300 to 6,000 years ago, replacing darker skins with light skins at astonishing speed. It implies that Europeans had been dark-skinned for tens of thousands of years. Several decades ago, Stanford's [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza|Cavalli-Sforza]] had argued that European hunter-gatherers, herders and fishers could have survived from the vitamin D content of their diet alone. Only when farming took hold did Europeans—replacing meat and fish with [[food grain|grain]]—need to absorb more sunlight to produce vitamin D in their skin.&lt;ref&gt;Cavalli-Sforza, L. L. and W. F. Bodmer  (1971). The Genetics of Human Populations. W. H. Freeman, San Francisco (reprinted 1999 by Dover Publications)&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers, including [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]],{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} [[Geoffrey Miller (evolutionary psychologist)|Miller]],&lt;ref&gt;Miller G (2000) The mating mind: how sexual choice shaped the evolution of human nature, London, Heineman, {{ISBN|0-434-00741-2}} (also Doubleday. {{ISBN|0-385-49516-1}})&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Richard Dawkins|Dawkins]],&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (2004). A Devil's Chaplain (p. 77). Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; have proposed that skin-colour changes were driven by [[sexual selection]]. Cochran and Harpending reject the sexual-selection idea when used to imply that race is no more than skin deep ("perhaps little more than a fad"),&lt;ref&gt;Chuck Lemme (2005). "Race and Sexual Selection," Skeptic, Tuesday, March 22nd, 2005.  http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/05-03-22.html (accessed May 16, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; pointing out that experts can easily determine race from skeletal evidence alone.

===Gene flow===
About halfway through the book, Cochran and Harpending pause to consider two different ways of looking at the information found in gene variants.&lt;ref name="Seed"/&gt; Researchers commonly see them merely as [[Genetic marker|markers]] of human migration, ignoring their functions. The authors support such research, but argue for a more complete understanding of the geographic distributions of genes. Where the usual geographical analysis treats the distribution of genes as an effect of history, in the authors' view, the genes themselves are a major cause: Two variants in the same gene do not necessarily have the same effect, and their relative, selective benefits will control the spread of genes through populations in both space and time.

===Expansions===
From that platform the authors discuss ideas that range from the possible origins of the [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] legend in Britain to the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]. Others have attempted this, for example in Jared Diamond’s [[Guns, Germs, and Steel]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jared Diamond]] (1997), ''[[Guns, Germs and Steel: A short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years]]'', London: Vintage, 2005 [1997], {{ISBN|0-09-930278-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, according to Kelleher,&lt;ref name="Seed"/&gt; Cochran and Harpending go one better than Diamond. He goes on to state that where Diamond was content with [[environmental determinism]], at times opposing the roles of human biology and population differences,  Cochran and Harpending embrace them both. Their discussion of gene flow becomes the core of an argument for biology as central to history, and the backdrop for the book's two major hypotheses.

The first seeks to resolve a longstanding debate in [[historical linguistics]] by making a case for the [[Kurgan hypothesis]] on the origins of the [[Proto-Indo-European Urheimat hypotheses|Indo-European language group]]. The Kurgan theory holds that Indo-European speakers came from lands between the [[Black Sea|Black]] and [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] seas before spreading their language by conquest. The authors suggest that dairy farming and a complementary adaptation - the ability to digest lactose in adulthood - lie behind their conquests. With a walking food source, the milk-drinking warriors defeated their plant-growing neighbours. Drinking milk, from cows, horses, or camels, is a behavior shared by many of history’s greatest conquering peoples, whether Kurgans, [[Scythians]], [[Arab people|Arabs]], or [[Mongols]]. Without continuing evolution, the ability to digest milk could never have arisen. In fact, it has done so several times, in different ways, in various places, and it has helped shape human history. Kelleher comments that the authors’ argument makes it difficult to imagine the language in which their book would have been written, were it not for the ability to digest milk.&lt;ref name="Seed"/&gt;

===Ashkenazi Jews===
The second major argument, which takes up the final chapter, sets out to explain why [[Ashkenazi Jewish intelligence|Ashkenazi Jews]] have a [[mean]] [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] so much higher than that of the population in general. This argument had been published previously in an earlier paper&lt;ref&gt;[[Gregory Cochran|Cochran, G.]], J. Hardy, H. Harpending (2006). "[[Natural History of Ashkenazi Intelligence]]". ''[[Journal of Biosocial Science]]'' 38 (5), pp. 659–693.  {{doi|10.1017/S0021932005027069}}&lt;/ref&gt; that attracted wide media coverage, generating extensive criticism and praise. This final chapter prior to the book's conclusion has been described as "a consistent, thorough, biological history—or perhaps, better, a consistent biological hypothesis of a specific history, and a falsifiable one to boot".&lt;ref name="Seed"/&gt;

==Reviews==

The paleoanthropologist [[Milford H. Wolpoff]] criticized aspects of the book but considered that the scientific community should not "throw the baby out with the bath. The thesis of this book, its central hypothesis, is quite insightful and most probably correct. It presents a revolutionary explanation for recent human evolution and biological variation, based on an exploding genetic data set that will provide a continued means of testing it.&lt;ref name="Wolpoff"/&gt;

In ''[[New Scientist]]'', Christopher Willis wrote that the "evidence the authors present an overwhelming case that natural selection has recently acted strongly on us". However, Willis criticizes the authors for not discussing what the "recent and continuing evolution means for our species as a whole". Willis concludes by saying that "the book offers a limited and biased interpretation
of some very exciting research".&lt;ref name="Wills2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wills|first1=Christopher|title=Review: The 10,000 Year Explosion by Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending|journal=New Scientist|volume=201|issue=2695|year=2009|pages=46–47|issn=0262-4079|doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(09)60457-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Evolution and Human Behavior'', anthropologist Edward Hagen wrote that the book makes "many unsupported and often questionable assertions", but it is nevertheless valuable in raising "bold questions about major historical encounters between populations — Neanderthal and modern humans, German tribes and Romans, Europeans and Native Americans — in light of formidable (but not unassailable) arguments from population genetics". Hagen considered that it "should also be on the summer reading list of all evolutionary social scientists".&lt;ref name="Hagen2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hagen|first1=Edward H.|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|volume=30|issue=6|year=2009|pages=453–455|title=Human natures - A review of The 10,000 Year Explosion|issn=1090-5138|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2009.07.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologist Cadell Last wrote that by using race as a natural fact, the book "undermines the attempt to find a legitimate scientific approach to understanding recent human evolution and conceptualizing human genetic diversity" and that it was "unfortunate" that it had received "praise from prominent, influential well-established biological anthropologists" such as [[John D. Hawks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Last|first1=Cadell Nicholas|title=Book Review: The 10,000 Year Explosion: How Civilization Accelerated Human Evolution|date=2013|url=http://vav.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/vav/article/view/15966/17131|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a review in the ''[[Financial Times]]'', "Interestingly, the authors make no predictions for our future. And accordingly, biologists – as opposed to social scientists – may not find their thesis all that novel. But it is an engaging book with valuable information about how advantageous genes spread through a population."&lt;ref name="FTReview"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/e3465a8a-19e1-11e0-b921-00144feab49a |title=The 10,000 Year Explosion |last=Cane |first=Alan |date=7 Jan 2011 |work=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Seed (magazine)|Seed]]'', T.J. Kelleher wrote that "The strength and sheer number of the book’s best sections, however, more than overshadow the wanness and paucity of its worst. Even with its flaws, Cochran and Harpending’s book has provided the best example to date of what [[E.O. Wilson]] would recognize as consilient history".&lt;ref name="Seed"&gt;Kelleher, T.J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1779">A '''valence issue''' is a [[political issue]] about which voters will usually share a common preference.

[[Prosperity]] is a common valence issue.  All voters will want their community to prosper and so the consideration is not whether to seek prosperity or not but instead the issue is which party is most likely to deliver it. Further examples include the desire for high economic growth, low inflation, low unemployment, a strong national defense, high quality education and healthcare, sufficient housing and adequate transport infrastructure.

Valence issues may be contrasted with '''position issues''' — divisive issues for which there are different preferences.  In a study of campaigns for the [[US Senate]], candidates focused upon valence issues in 77% of their advertising.  The issues identified as positional or valence were:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |pages=67–70 |title=Spectacle of United States Senate Campaigns |author1=Kim Fridkin |author2=Kim Fridkin Kahn |author3=Patrick J. Kenney |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |year=1999 |isbn=9780691005058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], valence issues may include [[campaign finance reform]], [[care of the elderly]], [[crime]], [[daycare]], [[economy]], [[education]], [[inflation]], and [[job (role)|jobs]]. To contrast, position issues in the United States include [[abortion]], [[civil rights]], [[Salaries of members of the United States Congress|congressional pay]], [[death penalty]], [[drugs]], [[foreign aid]], the [[Natural environment|environment]], [[gun control]], [[healthcare]], [[nuclear proliferation]], [[school prayer]], [[taxes]], and [[term limits]]. Some of these may be seen differently in other countries.

'''Wishful thinking''' is the formation of [[belief]]s and making decisions according to what might be pleasing to imagine instead of by appealing to [[evidence]], [[rationality]], or [[reality]]. It is a product of resolving conflicts between belief and desire.&lt;ref name="wishful thinking:"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0956797611406447| title = Wishful Thinking: Belief, Desire, and the Motivated Evaluation of Scientific Evidence| journal = Psychological Science| volume = 22| issue = 6| pages = 731–732| year = 2011| last1 = Bastardi | first1 = A.| last2 = Uhlmann | first2 = E. L.| last3 = Ross | first3 = L. | pmid=21515736}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies have consistently shown that holding all else equal, subjects will predict positive outcomes to be more likely than negative outcomes (see [[unrealistic optimism]]). However, research suggests that under certain circumstances, such as when threat increases, a reverse phenomenon occurs.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; Dunning (2013)"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0963721412463693| title = Wishful Seeing: How Preferences Shape Visual Perception| journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science| volume = 22| pages = 33–37| year = 2013| last1 = Dunning | first1 = D.| last2 = Balcetis | first2 = E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some psychologists believe that positive thinking is able to positively influence behavior and so bring about better results. This is called the "[[Pygmalion effect]]".&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rosenthal, Robert|author2=Jacobson, Lenore|authorlink1=Robert Rosenthal (psychologist)|authorlink2=Lenore Jacobson|title=Pygmalion in the classroom : teacher expectation and pupils' intellectual development.|date=1992|publisher=Crown House Pub.|location=Bancyfelin, Carmarthen, Wales|isbn=978-1904424062|edition=Newly expanded}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pygmalion"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pygmalion Effect|url=http://www.duq.edu/about/centers-and-institutes/center-for-teaching-excellence/teaching-and-learning/pygmalion|website=www.duq.edu|publisher=Duquesne University|accessdate=12 November 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Booker]] described wishful thinking in terms of
:"the fantasy cycle" ... a pattern that recurs in personal lives, in politics, in history – and in storytelling. When we embark on a course of action which is unconsciously driven by wishful thinking, all may seem to go well for a time, in what may be called the "dream stage". But because this make-believe can never be reconciled with reality, it leads to a "frustration stage" as things start to go wrong, prompting a more determined effort to keep the fantasy in being. As reality presses in, it leads to a "nightmare stage" as everything goes wrong, culminating in an "explosion into reality", when the fantasy finally falls apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/christopherbooker/8440423/What-happens-when-the-great-fantasies-like-wind-power-or-European-Union-collide-with-reality.html|title=What happens when the great fantasies, like wind power or European Union, collide with reality?|date=9 April 2011|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a fallacy==
In addition to being a [[cognitive bias]] and a poor way of [[decision making|making decisions]], wishful thinking is commonly held to be a specific [[informal fallacy]] in an argument when it is assumed that because we wish something to be true or false, it ''is'' actually true or false. This fallacy has the form "I wish that P were true/false; therefore, P is true/false."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fallacyfiles.org/wishthnk.html|title=Logical Fallacy: Wishful Thinking|author=Gary Curtis|work=fallacyfiles.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wishful thinking, if this were true, would rely upon [[appeal to emotion|appeals to emotion]], and would also be a [[red herring (fallacy)|red herring]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Wishful thinking may cause blindness to [[unintended consequences]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Wishful seeing==
Wishful seeing is the phenomenon in which a person's internal state influences their visual [[perception]]. People have the tendency to believe that they perceive the world for what it is, but research suggests otherwise. Currently, there are two main types of wishful seeing based on where wishful seeing occurs—in categorization of objects or in representations of an environment.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; Dunning (2013)" /&gt;

The concept of wishful seeing was first introduced by the New Look approach to psychology. The New Look approach was popularized in the 1950s through the work of [[Jerome Bruner]] and Cecile Goodman. In their classic 1947 study, they asked children to demonstrate their perception of the size of coins by manipulating the diameter of a circular aperture on a wooden box. Each child held the coin in their left hand at the same height and distance from the aperture and operated the knob to change the size of the aperture with their right hand. The children were divided into three groups, two experimental and one control, with ten children in each group. The control group was asked to estimate the size of coin-sized cardboard discs instead of actual coins. On average, the children of the experimental groups overestimated the size of the coins by thirty percent. In a second iteration of the experiment, Bruner and Goodman divided the children into groups based on economic status. Again, both the "poor" and "rich" groups were asked to estimate the size of real coins by manipulating the diameter of the aperture. As was expected, both groups overestimated the size of the coins, but the "poor" group overestimated the size by as much as fifty percent, which was up to thirty percent more than the "rich" group. From these results Bruner and Goodman concluded that poorer children felt a greater desire for money and thus perceived the coins as larger. This hypothesis formed the basis of the New Look psychological approach which suggests that the subjective experience of an object influences the visual perception of that object.&lt;ref name="Stokes 477–492"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s11098-010-9688-8| title = Perceiving and desiring: A new look at the cognitive penetrability of experience| journal = Philosophical Studies| volume = 158| issue = 3| pages = 477–492| year = 2011| last1 = Stokes | first1 = D. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Psychodynamics|psychodynamic]] psychologists adopted the views of the New Look approach in order to explain how individuals might protect themselves from disturbing visual [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]]. The psychodynamic perspective lost support because it lacked a sufficient model to account for how the unconscious could influence perception.&lt;ref name="Riccio, Cole and Balcetis"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/spc3.12028| title = Seeing the Expected, the Desired, and the Feared: Influences on Perceptual Interpretation and Directed Attention| journal = Social and Personality Psychology Compass| volume = 7| issue = 6| pages = 401–414| year = 2013| last1 = Riccio | first1 = M. | last2 = Cole | first2 = S. | last3 = Balcetis | first3 = E. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some further research was able to replicate the results found by Bruner and Goodman, the New Look approach was mostly abandoned by the 1970s because the experiments were riddled with methodological errors that did not account for confounding factors such as reporter bias and context.&lt;ref name="Balcetis and Dunning"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0956797609356283| title = Wishful Seeing: More Desired Objects Are Seen as Closer| journal = Psychological Science| volume = 21| pages = 147–152| year = 2009| last1 = Balcetis | first1 = E.| last2 = Dunning | first2 = D. | pmid=20424036}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent research has brought about a revival of New Look perspectives, but with methodological improvements to resolve the outstanding issues that plagued the original studies.&lt;ref name="Riccio, Cole and Balcetis" /&gt;

==Underlying mechanisms==

===Cognition===
Concrete cognitive mechanisms underlying wishful thinking and wishful seeing are unknown. Since these concepts are still developing, research on the mechanisms contributing to this phenomenon is still in progress. However, some mechanisms have been proposed.
Wishful thinking could be attributed to three mechanisms: attention bias, [[interpretation bias]] or [[response bias]]. Therefore, there are three different stages in cognitive processing in which wishful thinking could arise.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; Dunning (2013)"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Krizan"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.133.1.95| title = The influence of outcome desirability on optimism| journal = Psychological Bulletin| volume = 133| pages = 95–121| year = 2007| last1 = Krizan | first1 = Z. | last2 = Windschitl | first2 = P. D. | pmid=17201572}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, at the lowest stage of cognitive processing, individuals selectively attend to cues. Individuals can attend to evidence that supports their desires and neglect contradictory evidence.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; Dunning (2013)"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Krizan"/&gt; Second, wishful thinking could be generated by selective interpretation of cues. In this case, an individual is not changing their attention to the cue but the attribution of importance to the cue.&lt;ref name = "Krizan"/&gt; Finally, wishful thinking can arise at a higher stage of cognitive processing, such as when forming a response to the cue and inserting bias.&lt;ref name= "Krizan" /&gt;

Wishful seeing can be attributed to the same mechanisms as wishful thinking because it involves the processing of situational cues, including visual cues. However, with preconscious processing of visual cues and their associations with desirable outcomes, interpretation bias and response bias are not plausible since they occur in conscious cognitive processing stages.&lt;ref name= "Aue Neural Circuits"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/scan/nsr081| title = Neural correlates of wishful thinking| journal = Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience| volume = 7| issue = 8| pages = 991–1000| year = 2011| last1 = Aue | first1 = T.| last2 = Nusbaum | first2 = H. C.| last3 = Cacioppo | first3 = J. T.| pmc = 3501709}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a fourth mechanism called perceptual set can also explain this phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; Dunning (2013)"/&gt;  This mechanism proposes that mental states or associations activated before an object comes into view subtly guide the visual system during processing. Therefore, cues are readily recognized when they are related to such a mental state or association.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; Dunning (2013)"/&gt;

Some speculate that wishful seeing results from cognitive penetrability in that higher cognitive functions are able to directly influence perceptual experience instead of only influencing perception at higher levels of processing. Those that argue against cognitive penetrability feel that sensory systems operate in a modular fashion with cognitive states exerting their influence only after the stimuli has been perceived.&lt;ref name="Stokes 477–492"/&gt;   The phenomenon of wishful seeing implicates cognitive penetrability in the perceptual experience.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; Dunning (2013)" /&gt;

Wishful seeing has been observed to occur in early stages of categorization. Research using [[ambiguous image|ambiguous figures]] and [[binocular rivalry]] exhibit this tendency.&lt;ref name="Balceltis and Dunning (2006)"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.91.4.612| title = See what you want to see: Motivational influences on visual perception| journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology| volume = 91| issue = 4| pages = 612–25| year = 2006| last1 = Balcetis | first1 = E. | last2 = Dunning | first2 = D. | pmid=17014288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perception is influenced by both top-down and bottom-up processing. In visual processing, bottom-up processing is a rigid route compared to flexible top-down processing.{{sfn|Robinson-Riegler|2011|pp=46–50}} Within bottom-up processing, the stimuli are recognized by [[fixation point]]s, proximity and focal areas to build objects, while top-down processing is more context sensitive. This effect can be observed via [[Priming (psychology)|priming]] as well as with [[emotional state]]s.&lt;ref name="Conceptual penetration"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0956797610366099| title = Conceptual Penetration of Visual Processing| journal = Psychological Science| volume = 21| issue = 5| pages = 682–691| year = 2010| last1 = Lupyan | first1 = G.| last2 = Thompson-Schill | first2 = S. L.| last3 = Swingley | first3 = D. | pmid=20483847 | pmc=4152984}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The traditional hierarchical models of information processing describe early visual processing as a one-way street: early visual processing goes into [[conceptual system]]s, but conceptual systems do not affect visual processes.&lt;ref name=Magno&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3481-07.2007| title = Magnocellular Projections as the Trigger of Top-Down Facilitation in Recognition| journal = Journal of Neuroscience| volume = 27| issue = 48| pages = 13232–13240| year = 2007| last1 = Kveraga | first1 = K.| last2 = Boshyan | first2 = J.| last3 = Bar | first3 = M. | pmid=18045917}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, research rejects this model and suggests conceptual information can penetrate early visual processing rather than just biasing the [[perceptual system]]s. This occurrence is called conceptual or cognitive penetrability. Research on conceptual penetrability utilize stimuli of conceptual-category pairs and measure the reaction time to determine if the category effect influenced visual processing,&lt;ref name="Conceptual penetration" /&gt;  The category effect is the difference in reaction times within the pairs such as ''Bb'' to ''Bp''. To test conceptual penetrability, there were simultaneous and sequential judgments of pairs. The reaction times decreased as the [[stimulus onset asynchrony]] increased, supporting categories affect visual representations and conceptual penetrability. Research with richer stimuli such as figures of cats and dogs allow for greater perceptual variability and analysis of stimulus typicality (cats and dogs were arranged in various positions, some more or less typical for recognition). Differentiating the pictures took longer when they were within the same category (dog&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;-dog&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;) compared between categories (dog-cat) supporting category knowledge influences categorization. Therefore, visual processing measured by physical differential judgments is affected by non-visual processing supporting conceptual penetrability.&lt;ref name="Conceptual penetration" /&gt;

===Neural circuitry===
The areas of the brain that motivate wishful seeing and thinking are associated with the same regions that underlie social identification and reward. A study looked at these structures using [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] while participants estimated the winning probabilities for a series of football teams. Prior to this estimation, the individuals specified their favorite, neutral and least favorite NFL teams. Wishful thinking has been associated with social identity theory where individual seem to prefer in-group members over out-group members.&lt;ref name="social identity"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1559-1816.1991.tb00514.x| title = Wishful Thinking—Against All Odds| journal = Journal of Applied Social Psychology| volume = 21| issue = 23| pages = 1921–1938| year = 1991| last1 = Babad | first1 = E. | last2 = Katz | first2 = Y. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, these individuals preferred the football team they most identified.

During wishful thinking tasks, differential activity was found in three areas of the brain: dorsal medial [[prefrontal cortex]], the [[parietal lobe]], and the [[fusiform gyrus]] in the [[occipital lobe]]. Differential activity in the occipital and parietal areas suggests a mode of selective attention to the cues presented; therefore, supporting a lower-level cognitive processing or attention bias.&lt;ref name="Aue Neural Circuits" /&gt; However, differential activity in the prefrontal cortex also suggests higher-cognitive processing. The prefrontal cortex activity is related to preferences involved in social identification.&lt;ref name="Aue Neural Circuits" /&gt;  As a result, when cues are relevant to an individual, such as a favorite football team, the prefrontal cortex is activated. This identification of self carries hedonic value which in turn stimulates the reward system.&lt;ref name="Aue Neural Circuits" /&gt;  Differential activation of the reward system areas was only seen in conjunction with the activation of occipital lobe.&lt;ref name="Aue Neural Circuits" /&gt; Thus, the activation of the reward system with an identification of self could lead to guidance of visual attention.&lt;ref name="Aue Neural Circuits" /&gt;&lt;ref name="social identity" /&gt;

[[Magnocellular pathway|Magnocellular]] (M) and [[Parvocellular pathway|parvocellular]] (P) pathways, which feed into the [[orbitofrontal cortex]], play important roles in top-down processes that are susceptible to cognitive penetrability.&lt;ref name="Conceptual penetration" /&gt;  [[Magnocellular pathway|Magnocellular]] processing biased stimuli deferentially activates the [[orbitofrontal cortex]]; fast [[Magnocellular pathway|magnocellular]] projections link early visual and [[Inferotemporal cortex|inferotemporal]] object recognition and work with the [[orbitofrontal cortex]] by helping generate early object predictions based on perceptual sets.&lt;ref name=Magno /&gt;  Stimuli were M-biased with low-luminance, achromatic line drawings or P-biased with isoluminate, chromatic line drawings and participants were asked if the drawing was larger or smaller than a shoebox.&lt;ref name=Magno /&gt;  [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]] was used to monitor brain activity in the [[orbitofrontal cortex]] and ventrotemporal regions to determine which pathway aided faster object recognition.&lt;ref name=Magno /&gt;  The results supported that [[Magnocellular pathway|magnocellular]] neurons play a vital role in low-resolution object recognition as the neurons aid in quickly triggering top-down processes that provide initial guesses that lead to faster object recognition.&lt;ref name=Magno /&gt;

==Attention==
[[File:Scout Girl in Concentration.jpg|thumb|Focused attention]]
Humans have a physiologically limited [[visual field]] that must be selectively directed to certain stimuli. [[Attention]] is the cognitive process that allows this task to be accomplished and it might be responsible for the phenomenon of wishful seeing. Expectations, desires and fears are among the various factors that help direct attention.&lt;ref name="Riccio, Cole and Balcetis"/&gt;   Consequently, these cognitive experiences have the opportunity to influence the perceptual experience. In turn, attention can organize planned movement, providing a mechanism through which visual stimuli can influence behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.3758/s13414-013-0489-y| title = The impact of visual illusions on perception, action planning, and motor performance| journal = Attention, Perception, &amp; Psychophysics| volume = 75| issue = 5| pages = 830–834| year = 2013| last1 = Wood | first1 = G. | last2 = Vine | first2 = S. J. | last3 = Wilson | first3 = M. R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attentional deficits can also lead to altered perceptual experiences. [[Inattentional blindness]], where unexpected events go by undetected, is one such deficit.{{sfn|Robinson-Riegler|2011|pp=99–101}} Using an inattentional blindness paradigm, researchers, White and Davies, had participants fixate on a cross in the center of the screen. First, a number cue denoting the number of letters that would appear on the arms of the cross appeared in the center of the cross. Following the cue, the actual letters would appear on the arms of the cross. Over four trials, the number of letters matched the number that was cued. On the fifth trial, half of the participants were cued to expect a smaller number of letters and half were cued to expect the correct number of letters. The letters then appeared on the screen accompanied by an unexpected stimulus. Participants were asked which letters appeared and whether they had seen any additional object. Participants cued to expect fewer letters were more susceptible to inattentional blindness as they failed to detect the unexpected stimulus more often than participants who had been cued to expect the correct number of stimuli. These results indicate that attentional capacity is affected by expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0096-1523.34.5.1092| title = Attention set for number: Expectation and perceptual load in inattentional blindness| journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance| volume = 34| issue = 5| pages = 1092–1107| year = 2008| last1 = White | first1 = R. C. | last2 = Davies | first2 = A. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This provides further evidence that cognitive processes converge in order to help construct the perceptual experience.

Although attention can lead to enhanced perceptual processing, the lack of attention to stimuli can also lead to a perceived enhanced perception of the stimuli.&lt;ref name=non-attention&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nn.2948| title = Attention induces conservative subjective biases in visual perception| journal = Nature Neuroscience| volume = 14| issue = 12| pages = 1513–1515| year = 2011| last1 = Rahnev | first1 = D. | last2 = Maniscalco | first2 = B. | last3 = Graves | first3 = T. | last4 = Huang | first4 = E. | last5 = De Lange | first5 = F. P. | last6 = Lau | first6 = H. | pmid=22019729}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants were pre-cued that indicated the diagonal to which they should be attending. They were then presented with stimuli (gratings with different textures) and then a response cue that indicated the diagonal for which the participants had to judge their perception. 70% of the time the response cue matched the pre-cue and 30% of the time did not match the pre-cue. The participants were asked to report texture of the gratings that appeared in the response-cue and discriminate its visibility. This set-up allowed them to compare the perception of attended (cued) and non-attended stimuli (uncued).&lt;ref name=non-attention /&gt;  Higher visibility was reported for stimuli that was unattended. Therefore, inattention lead to an overestimation of perception sensitivity.&lt;ref name=non-attention /&gt; This study suggests attention bias, a mechanism of wishful thinking, does not only rely on what individuals fixate upon, but the unattended stimuli as well.

===Interpretation of emotion===
Emotion is often interpreted through visual cues on the face, body language and context.&lt;ref name="Barrett 595–599"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0956797610363547| title = Context is Routinely Encoded During Emotion Perception| journal = Psychological Science| volume = 21| issue = 4| pages = 595–599| year = 2010| last1 = Barrett | first1 = L. F.| last2 = Kensinger | first2 = E. A. | pmid=20424107 | pmc=2878776}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, context and cultural backgrounds have been shown to influence the visual perception and interpretation of emotion.&lt;ref name="Barrett 595–599"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Emotion&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0963721411422522| title = Context in Emotion Perception| journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science| volume = 20| issue = 5| pages = 286–290| year = 2011| last1 = Barrett | first1 = L. F.|authorlink2=Batja Mesquita |last2 = Mesquita | first2 = B.| last3 = Gendron | first3 = M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cross-cultural differences in [[change blindness]] have been associated with perceptual set, or a tendency to attend to visual scenes in a particular way.{{sfn|Robinson-Riegler|2011|pp=101–102}} For example, eastern cultures tend to emphasize background of an object, while western cultures focus on central objects in a scene.{{sfn|Robinson-Riegler|2011|pp=101–102}} Perceptual sets are also the result of cultural aesthetic preferences. Therefore, cultural context can influence how people sample information from a face, just like they would do in a situational context. For example, Caucasians generally fixate around eyes, nose and mouth, while Asians fixate on eyes.&lt;ref name=Emotion /&gt; Individuals from different cultural backgrounds who were shown a series of faces and asked to sort them into piles in which every face showed the same emotion. Fixation on different features of the face leads to disparate reading of emotions.&lt;ref name=Emotion /&gt;  Asians' focus on the eyes lead to the perception of startled faces as surprise rather than fear.&lt;ref name=Emotion /&gt;  As a result, previous associations or customs of an individual can lead to different categorization or recognition of emotion. This particular difference in visual perception of emotion seems to suggest an attention bias mechanism for wishful seeing, since certain visual cues were attended to (e.g. nose, eyes) and the others were ignored (e.g. mouth).

===Optimism===
Wishful seeing is also linked to [[optimism bias]] through which individuals tend to expect positive outcomes from events despite such expectations having little basis in reality. In order to determine the neural correlates underlying optimism bias, one [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)]] study imaged the brains of individuals as they recalled autobiographical moments related to life events and then rated their memories on several scales. These ratings revealed that participants viewed future positive events as more positive than past positive events and negative events as more temporally distant. The active brain regions, compared to a fixation point, were the [[Anterior cingulate cortex|rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC)]] and the [[Amygdala|right amygdala]]. Both of these areas became less active when imagining negative future events. The rACC is implicated in assessing emotional content and has strong connections to the amygdala. It is suggested that the rACC regulates activation in brain regions associated with emotion and autobiographical memory, thus allowing for the projection of positivity onto images of future events.&lt;ref name="optimism bias"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature06280| title = Neural mechanisms mediating optimism bias| journal = Nature| volume = 450| issue = 7166| pages = 102–5| year = 2007| last1 = Sharot | first1 = T. | last2 = Riccardi | first2 = A. M. | last3 = Raio | first3 = C. M. | last4 = Phelps | first4 = E. A. | pmid=17960136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to consider physical aspects such as eye movement and brain activity and their relationship to wishful thinking, wishful seeing, and [[optimism]]. Isaacowitz (2006) investigated the motivational role of gaze, which he claims is highly correlated to an individual's interests and personality.&lt;ref name="Isaacowitz 2006 68–72"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.0963-7214.2006.00409.x| title = Motivated Gaze. The View from the Gazer| journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science| volume = 15| issue = 2| pages = 68–72| year = 2006| last1 = Isaacowitz | first1 = D. M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his study, participants who embodied varying levels of self-reported optimism were directed to look at images of skin cancer, line drawings that were similar to the cancer pictures, and neutral faces.&lt;ref name="Isaacowitz 2006 68–72"/&gt; Using a remote [[eye tracking]] system that measured the movement of the participants gaze, Isaacowitz found that more optimistically minded young adults gazed less on the skin cancer images when compared to the less optimistically minded participants.&lt;ref name="Isaacowitz 2006 68–72"/&gt; This data was replicated in a follow up study in which participants were screened for their genetically based risk for contracting skin cancer (even though some participants were more at risk than others, higher levels of optimism were correlated with a less fixated gaze on the skin cancer images despite the fact that the images were relevant to some participants).&lt;ref name="Isaacowitz 2006 68–72"/&gt;

==Methodology==
Wishful thinking is often studied in the context of psychology through the application of [[ambiguous image|ambiguous figure]] studies, the hypothesis being that when presented with an ambiguous stimuli, the participant will interpret the stimuli in a certain way depending on the conditions or priming the participant experiences.

[[Emily Balcetis|Balcetis]] and [[David Dunning|Dunning]] (2013) investigated wishful seeing by conducting two experiments, one involving two ambiguous stimuli that could be perceived as "B" or "13", and the other either a horse or a seal. The second experiment was a binocular rivalry test in which the participants were presented simultaneously with the letter "H" or number "4" (one stimuli in each eye). In each experiment, the experimenters associated one of the stimuli with desirable outcomes, and the other with a negative outcome (i.e. the "B" was associated with freshly squeezed orange juice while the "13" was associated with an undesirable health food smoothie, and in the binocular rivalry experiment, letters were associated with economic gain while numbers were associated with economic loss).&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; Dunning (2013)" /&gt;  The results of the experiment demonstrated that participants were more likely to perceive the stimulus that was associated with a positive situation or outcome than the stimulus associated with negative situations.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; Dunning (2013)" /&gt; This strong correlation between perception and positive versus negative stimuli demonstrates that we tend to see the world based on our own desires. The concept of wishful seeing hints towards a motivation-based perception process.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; Dunning (2013)" /&gt;

Balcetis and Dale (2007) further considered that we view the world in biased ways in their four-prong study, one part of which addressed motivated object interpretation using a situation involving the interpretation of an ambiguous object (i.e. a [[Necker cube]]) that lacks the language based labels that the [[priming (psychology)|priming]] information may suggest to the participants. Many studies claim that what humans perceive or see is based on our internal motivation and goals, but it is important to consider that some priming situations in certain studies, or even the internal views of the participant, can affect the interpretation of a stimulus.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; Dunning (2013)" /&gt;  With these considerations in mind, Balcetis and Dale (2007), divided 124 [[Cornell University]] undergraduates into three groups which were each asked to imagine one of three detailed conditions: an upward-looking condition (participants were asked to imagine looking up at a large building), a downward-looking position (looking into a deep canyon), and a neutral/flat condition (standing in a flat field). The participants were then shown an ambiguous Necker cube on a computer screen and were told to click one of the two blue lines that seemed the closest to them. The line the participants chose depended on whether they determined the cube to be facing upwards or downwards.&lt;ref name="Balcetis 2007 581–595"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1068/p5678| title = Conceptual set as a top – down constraint on visual object identification| journal = Perception| volume = 36| issue = 4| pages = 581–595| year = 2007| last1 = Balcetis | first1 = E. | last2 = Dale | first2 = R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of the study demonstrated that the majority of participants in the upward-looking condition saw the cube as facing upwards, the majority of downwards-looking conditioned patients saw the cube as facing downwards, and the participants in the neutral condition were evenly divided.&lt;ref name="Balcetis 2007 581–595"/&gt; These results show that the priming stimulus language influenced object identification.&lt;ref name="Balcetis 2007 581–595"/&gt; Motivation-affected object identification was observed in each condition.&lt;ref name="Balcetis 2007 581–595"/&gt;

Similar results were seen in a study conducted by Changizi and Hall (2001), which addressed wishful thinking and goal-oriented object identification by investigating levels of thirst among participants in relation to their tendency to identify an ambiguously transparent stimulus as transparent (the study states that transparency is a natural yet unobvious quality directly related to water, a typically clear substance).&lt;ref name="Changizi 2001 1489–1497"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1068/p3266| title = Thirst modulates a perception| journal = Perception| volume = 30| issue = 12| pages = 1489–1497| year = 2001| last1 = Changizi | first1 = M. A. | last2 = Hall | first2 = W. G. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of the study showed a clear tendency for the thirsty participants (who were directed to eat a bag of potato chips immediately preceding the study) to interpret the ambiguous stimuli as transparent.&lt;ref name="Changizi 2001 1489–1497" /&gt; Furthermore, the participants who were not thirsty (they were directed to drink water before the study until they reported themselves as not thirsty) were less likely to interpret the ambiguous stimuli as transparent.&lt;ref name="Changizi 2001 1489–1497"/&gt; The study concludes that an alteration of a biological state, in this case the participants' level of thirstiness, that inspires wishful thinking, can directly affect the perception of visual stimuli.&lt;ref name="Changizi 2001 1489–1497"/&gt;

Bastardi, Uhlmann, and Ross (2011), showed the effects of wishful thinking when they presented parents with two fictional studies involving day care versus home care for their children. The parents who were conflicted (planned to use day care despite believing home care to be superior) more positively rated the "study" that claimed day care as superior and more negatively rated the study that claimed home care was better. The unconflicted parents (those that thought home care was superior to day care and planned to use only home care) rated the study that claimed home care was better more positively. The parents rated the studies that claimed what they actually planned for their children was the superior action, even though (in the case of the conflicted parents) the study may have been in opposition to their original beliefs.&lt;ref name="wishful thinking:"/&gt; In a post-experiment evaluation, the conflicted parents changed their initial beliefs and claimed to believe that home care was no better than day care, and the unconflicted parents continued to claim home care to be superior, though to a lesser degree.&lt;ref name="wishful thinking:"/&gt;

Balcetis and Dunning (2012) used the natural ambiguity found in judging distances to measure the effects of wishful seeing. During the study participants judged the distance to various stimuli while the experimenters manipulated the desirability of the stimuli. In one study, participants had their thirst intensified by consuming a large portion of their daily sodium intake or quenched by drinking to satiety. They were then asked to estimate the distance to a bottle of water. Those participants who were thirstier ranked the bottle of water as more desirable and viewed it as closer than less thirsty participants.&lt;ref name="Riccio, Cole and Balcetis" /&gt; Another study performed by Balcetis and Dunning had participants estimate the distance to test results that contained either positive or negative feedback and to $100 gift cards that they had the possibility of either winning or not. Participants viewed the forms as closer when they contained positive feedback and the $100 gift cards as closer when there was a possibility that they might win them.&lt;ref name="Riccio, Cole and Balcetis" /&gt; Balcetis and Dunning took into account the possible influence of positive mood by measuring creativity through a word creation task, and arousal by physiological markers.&lt;ref name="Riccio, Cole and Balcetis" /&gt; The experimenters also eliminated reporter bias in one of their studies by having participants throw a beanbag toward a gift card adhered to the floor. Underthrowing the beanbag indicated that the participant perceived the gift card as closer, while overthrowing the beanbag indicated that the participant perceived the gift card as further away. Their results suggest that there is a positivity bias in the perception of distance.&lt;ref name="Riccio, Cole and Balcetis" /&gt;

The relationship between distance perception and positivity may be more complicated than originally thought because context can also influence the distortion of perception. In fact, in threatening situations, positivity bias may be put aside to enable an appropriate response. In turn, the perceptual exaggerations brought on by threatening stimuli can be negated by psychosocial resources.&lt;ref name="Harber 2011 1080–1090"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/a0023995| title = Psychosocial resources, threat, and the perception of distance and height: Support for the resources and perception model| journal = Emotion| volume = 11| issue = 5| pages = 1080–1090| year = 2011| last1 = Harber | first1 = K. D. | last2 = Yeung | first2 = D. | last3 = Iacovelli | first3 = A. | pmid=21707147}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Psychosocial]] resources are defined by the Resources and Perception Model (RPM) as [[social support]], [[self-worth]], [[Self-esteem|self- esteem]], [[self-efficacy]], [[hope]], [[optimism]], perceived control and [[self-disclosure]]. The participants reported distance measures while the experimenters manipulated the self-worth of the participants through [[mental image]]ry exercises, as well as their exposure to threatening (a tarantula) or non-threatening (a cat toy) stimuli. An effect of self-worth was only observed upon exposure to the threatening stimuli, when increased self-worth was correlated with a more realistic estimate of the distance to the threatening stimuli.&lt;ref name="Harber 2011 1080–1090"/&gt;

===Representations of environment===

Another common area in which wishful seeing can be observed is through environmental representations.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; Dunning (2013)"/&gt;  Many studies have supported that desire or motivations effect estimates of size, distance, speed, length and slope of environment or target. For example, people will perceive desired objects as closer.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; Dunning (2013)"/&gt; Wishful seeing also effects athlete's perception of balls and other equipment.&lt;ref name=Witt&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0963721411408770| title = Action's Effect on Perception| journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science| volume = 20| issue = 3| pages = 201–206| year = 2011| last1 = Witt | first1 = J. K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, softball players who see the ball as bigger hit better and tennis players who return better see the net as lower and the ball as moving slower.&lt;ref name="Witt" /&gt;  Distance and slope perception is effected by energy levels; subjects with a heavier load see hills as steeper and distances as farther, targets that are placed uphill compared to flat ground seem farther away, people who are in shape perceive hills as shallower and fatigued runners see hills as steeper.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; Dunning (2013)"/&gt;{{sfn|Robinson-Riegler|2011|pp=64–67}} This perception is modulated by what has been coined as "efficient energy expenditure."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1745-6916.2006.00008.x| title = Embodied Perception and the Economy of Action| journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science| volume = 1| issue = 2| pages = 110–122| year = 2006| last1 = Proffitt | first1 = D. R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, perceived increase in effort (a steeper slope) when physically exhausted, might prompt individuals to rest rather than expend more energy.{{sfn|Robinson-Riegler|2011|pp=64–67}}

Distance perception is also effected by [[cognitive dissonance]].&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; Dunning (2013)"/&gt;  [[Cognitive dissonance]] was manipulated by high choice groups which were led to believe they selected wearing a [[Carmen Miranda]] outfit to walk across campus versus a low choice group which was told they had to wear the outfit. To reduce cognitive dissonance in high choice groups the subjects changed their attitude to match the situation. Thus, they perceived their environment in a less extreme way (shorter distance) than low choice groups.&lt;ref name="cognitive dissonance"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.02000.x| title = Cognitive Dissonance and the Perception of Natural Environments| journal = Psychological Science| volume = 18| issue = 10| pages = 917–21| year = 2007| last1 = Balcetis | first1 = E.| last2 = Dunning | first2 = D. | pmid=17894610}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar results followed with a perception of slope test, in which participants were in high and low choice groups to push themselves up a slope on skateboard with only their arms. Again, the high choice group perceived the slope as shallower than the low choice in order to reduce cognitive dissonance. Both of these studies suggest that intraphysic motives play a role in perception of environments in order to encourage the perceiver to engage in behaviors that lead them either to acquire a desired object or be able to complete a desired task.&lt;ref name="cognitive dissonance" /&gt;

==Reverse wishful thinking and seeing==
This process occurs when threat increases.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; Dunning (2013)"/&gt; The [[Ebbinghaus illusion]] has been used to measure reverse wishful seeing, with participants observing negative flanker targets underestimated less than positive or neutral targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s00426-007-0114-6| title = Affective stimulus properties influence size perception and the Ebbinghaus illusion| journal = Psychological Research| volume = 72| issue = 3| pages = 304–310| year = 2007| last1 = Van Ulzen | first1 = N.

==Procrastination and motivation==
Sigall, Kruglanski, and Fyock (2000) found that people who were assessed to be high wishful thinkers were more likely to procrastinate when motivated to do so (by being told that the task they were about to do was unpleasant). When told the task was going to be pleasant, there was little difference in the amount of [[procrastination]], showing that when motivated, wishful thinkers may consider themselves more capable of doing the task in a lesser amount of time, therefore exhibiting wishful thinking and considering themselves more capable than they are, and as a result, put off working on the unpleasant task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sigall|first1=H.|last2=Kruglanski |first2= A.| last3= Fyock|first3= J.|title=Wishful Thinking and Procrastination|journal=Journal of Social Behavior &amp; Personality|year=2000|volume=15|issue=5|pages=283–296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waymo was a project by [[Google]] that involves developing technology for [[driverless car]]s. In December 2016, Google transitioned the project into a new company called Waymo, housed under Google's parent company Alphabet. The project was led by Google engineer [[Sebastian Thrun]], director of the [[Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]] and co-inventor of [[Google Street View]].

====Wing====
{{Main article|Wing (company)}}
Project Wing was a project of X that aims to rapidly deliver products across a city by using flying vehicles, similar to the [[Amazon Prime Air]] concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|magazine=AOPA Pilot|date=April 2015|page=63|title=Droning On}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the announcement on August 28, 2014, it had already been in development secretly at Google for about two years, with full-scale testing being carried out in Australia. The flying vehicles take off vertically, then rotate to a horizontal position for flying around. For delivery, it hovers and winches packages down to the ground. At the end of the tether is a small bundle of electronics which detects that the package has hit the ground, detaches from the delivery, and is pulled back up into the body of the vehicle. Dropping the cargo or landing were found to be unfeasible, as users compromised the safety.&lt;ref name=gra1&gt;Warwick, Graham.

===Explorations===
{{columns-list|colwidth=120em|
* Foghorn, a project to produce liquid hydrocarbon fuel for vehicles using sea water as a source of carbon dioxide, extracted using membrane technology, and also as a source of hydrogen, using electrolysis. The project was killed by X in 2016 and the results published in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://x.company/explorations/foghorn/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Calcifer explored using lighter-than-air vehicles to move freight at lower cost in countries with poor transportation infrastructure. Abandoned in 2014 due to the high cost of prototyping and limited expected impact.&lt;ref&gt;https://x.company/explorations/&lt;/ref&gt;

Projects that X has considered and rejected include a [[space elevator]], which was deemed to be currently infeasible;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gayomali|first=Chris|title=Google X Confirms The Rumors: It Really Did Try To Design A Space Elevator|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3029138/world-changing-ideas/google-x-confirms-the-rumors-it-really-did-try-to-design-a-space-elevat?partner=rss|work=Fast Company|accessdate=April 17, 2014|date=April 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[hoverboard]], which was determined to be too costly relative to the societal benefits;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gayomali|first=Chris|title=This Is Why We Don't Have Google X Hoverboards Yet|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3029162/most-innovative-companies/this-is-why-we-dont-have-google-x-hoverboards-yet|work=Fast Company|accessdate=April 17, 2014|date=April 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a user-safe [[jetpack]], which was thought to be too loud and energy-wasting;&lt;ref name="rejects"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mack|first=Eric|title=Four Crazy Google X Projects That Failed|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericmack/2014/05/06/four-crazy-google-x-projects-that-failed/|work=Forbes|accessdate=May 9, 2014|date=May 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[teleportation]], which was found to violate the laws of physics.&lt;ref name="rejects" /&gt;

==Approach==
In February 2016, Astro Teller, the X "Captain of Moonshots", gave a [[TED (conference)|TED talk]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The unexpected benefit of celebrating failure|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/astro_teller_the_unexpected_benefit_of_celebrating_failure|work=TED|accessdate=June 3, 2016|date= Feb 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he described the X approach to projects. Unusual characteristics of the approach included constantly trying to find reasons to kill off projects by tackling the hardest parts first, and both celebrating and rewarding staff when projects were killed off due to failure.

On May 17, 2018, an internal video entitled ''The Selfish Ledger'' was leaked by [[The Verge]], regarding reshaping society through total data collection. A spokesperson stated that "This is a thought-experiment by the Design team from years ago that uses a technique known as ‘speculative design’ to explore uncomfortable ideas and concepts in order to provoke discussion and debate. It’s not related to any current or future products."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/17/17344250/google-x-selfish-ledger-video-data-privacy|title=Google’s Selfish Ledger is an unsettling vision of Silicon Valley social engineering|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsidiaries==
A number of companies [[List of mergers and acquisitions by Google|have been acquired and merged]] into X, covering a diverse range of skills including [[wind turbines]], [[robotics]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[humanoid robot]]s, robotic arms, and [[computer vision]]. In 2013, X acquired [[Makani Power]], a US company which develops tethered wings/kites with mounted wind turbines for low cost renewable energy generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google acquires kite-power generator|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-22636565|work=BBC News|accessdate=May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, it acquired product design and mechanical engineering firm Gecko Design, whose previous products included the Fitbit activity tracker and low-cost computers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As of 2015, X has acquired 14 companies: among them are [[Redwood Robotics]], [[Meka Robotics]], [[Boston Dynamics]], and Jetpac.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miners|first1=Zach|title=Google acquires Gecko Design for next-generation products|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2598100/google-acquires-gecko-design-for-nextgeneration-products.html|accessdate=August 22, 2014|date=August 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017, X sold Boston Dynamics to [[SoftBank Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-softbank-20170609-story.html|title=Why Google wanted to sell – and Softbank wanted to buy – Boston Dynamics, which makes crazy robots|last=D'Angelo|first=Alexa|date=June 9, 2017|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=June 9, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
A reporter from ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'' visited the site in 2013 and described it as "ordinary two-story red-brick buildings about a half-mile from Google's main campus. There's a burbling fountain out front and rows of company-issued bikes, which employees use to shuttle to the main campus."&lt;ref name="businessweek1"/&gt;
