      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1696">'''The American Bronze Company'''  aka '''American White Bronze Company''' was a company that produced, and sold through trade catalogs, [[zinc]] (known as “white bronze”)statues and memorials.  It was founded in about 1885, initially as a subsidiary of the [[Monumental Bronze Company]].  In 1892 the foundry, owned by Paul Cornell, was located in [[Grand Crossing, Illinois]] where Cornell owned a watch company.  Around 1900 the company moved to in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]].  The firm is best known for producing cemetery monuments and [[American Civil War|Civil War]] monuments, for both the Union and Confederate causes.  

“In the wake of the American Civil War, memorials to citizen soldiers who died during the conflict proliferated across the national landscape. Many of these monuments were replicated over and over using available mechanical processes to reproduce sculpture.”&lt;ref&gt;Beetham, Sarah, An Army of Bronze Simulacra; The Copied Soldier Monument and the American Civil War, Nierika: Revista de Estudios de Arte, No. 7, Year 4,  2007p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;  The American Bronze Company  produced many of them.

The company, by then known as the American Art Bronze Foundry closed up during World War II.&lt;ref&gt; Grissom, Carol A., Zinc Sculpture in America: 1850-1950, University of Delaware Press, Newark, 2009 pp615-616&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
''April's Shower'' begins with a group of people gathered for a wedding shower for April.

{{Culture of Albania}}

The '''Architecture of Albania''' ({{IPA-sq|aɾˈki:tɛk:uɾa ʃcipˈta:ɾɛ}} — {{lang-sq|Arkitektura e Shqipërisë}}) is a reflection of [[Albania]]'s historical and cultural heritage.&lt;ref name="hisarch"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Keida Lulo, Kevin Tummers|title=History of Albanian Architecture Model, Various Authors, 1970 - 2.12.ARCHITECTURE and Urban Development|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:K1Re5ez6erQJ:www.seda.org.al/download/i/mark_dl/u/4012653116/4611166538/2.3-Architecture.pdf+&amp;cd=7&amp;hl=de&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=de|website=seda.org.al|page=1|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country's architecture was influenced by its location within the [[Mediterranean Basin]] and progressed over the course of history as it was once inhabited by numerous civilisations including the [[Illyrians]], [[Ancient Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]s, [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]s, [[Venetian Empire|Venetian]]s, [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s as well as modern [[Austro-Hungarian empire|Austro-Hungarian]]s and [[Italians]]. In addition, missionaries, invaders, colonisers and traders brought cultural changes that had a large profound effect on building styles as well as techniques.

During [[classical antiquity]], cities and towns in Albania have evolved from within the [[castle]] to include [[dwelling]]s, religious and commercial structures, with constant redesigning of town squares and evolution of building techniques. Although there are prehistoric and classical structures in the country, which effectively begins with constructions from the [[Illyrians]] and [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] such as in [[Byllis]], [[Amantia]], [[Phoenice]], [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]], [[Butrint]] and [[Shkodër]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=POLITISCHE ORGANISATIONSFORMEN IM VORRÖMISCHEN SÜDILLYRIEN|url=http://www.fondazionecanussio.org/atti2003/siewert.pdf|website=fondazionecanussio.org|page=58|language=German|format=PDF|quote=Die Urbanisierung Illyriens begann im späten 5.

After the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], Albania became an integral part of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. They have left a legacy, most visible in the cities and surroundings of [[Korçë]], [[Berat]], [[Voskopojë]] and [[Gjirokastër]], in the form of castles, churches and monasteries with grandiose wealth of visible [[mural]]s and [[fresco]]s. The country also has many surviving monuments from the [[Ottoman Albania|Ottoman]] period. They left their mark with the many mosques and other buildings they constructed, that contributed to make Berat and Gjirokastër an UNESCO World Heritage Site.

In the 18th and 19th century, Albanian medieval towns underwent urban transformations by various Austro-Hungarian and Italian architects, giving them the appearance of western European cities; this can be particularly seen in [[Tirana]] and Korçë. They introduced [[architectural style]]s such as [[Historicism (art)|Historicism]], [[Art Nouveau]], [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Neo-Renaissance]] and [[Neoclassicism]].

Following the establishment of [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|communism in Albania]], the country's architecture development was radically changed by the socialist ideology and numerous historic and [[Sacred architecture|sacred]] buildings across Albania were demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Karin Myhrberg - [[University of Gothenburg]]|title=Heritage from the Communist Period in Albania - An Unwanted Heritage Today?|url=https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/29221/1/gupea_2077_29221_1.pdf|website=gupea.ub.gu.se|location=Gothenburg|page=12|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Arta Dollani, Antonella Lerario and Nicola Maiellaro|title=Sustaining Cultural and Natural Heritage in Albania|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/8/8/792/pdf|website=mdpi.com|pages=1–19|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many socialist-styled complexes, wide roads and factories were constructed, while squares in major towns were redesigned.

== Overview of Albania ==
{{See also|Geography of Albania|History of Albania}}

[[File:Albania space.jpg|137px|thumb|Topography of [[Albania]].]]

Albania is a [[Mediterranean]] country, lying to the east of [[Italy]], across the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Although the country occupies the southwestern portion of the [[Balkan Peninsula]], bordered by [[Montenegro]] to the northwest, [[Kosovo]]{{efn|name=status}} to the northeast, the [[Republic of Macedonia]] to the east and [[Greece]] to the south and southeast. It has a varied and contrasting topography with high mountains, rocky shores, coastal wetlands, sandy beaches, steep canyons and gorges and islands of various shapes and sizes.

In terms of topography, the country encompasses [[coastal plain]]s in the west to the [[Albanian Alps]] in the north, the [[Sharr Mountains]] in the northeast, [[Central Mountain Range, Albania#Skanderbeg Mountains|Skanderbeg Mountains]] in the center, [[Korab|Korab Mountains]] in the east, [[Pindus Mountains]] in the southeast and [[Ceraunian Mountains]] in the southwest along the [[Albanian Riviera]] and [[Albanian Ionian Sea Coast|Ionian Sea Coast]].

The country experiences mostly [[Mediterranean climate|mediterranean]] climate with [[Continental climate|continental]] influences.&lt;ref name="climate1"&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Ministry of Environment (Albania)|Ministry of Environment of Albania]]|title=Albania's Second National Communication to the Conference of Parties under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/albnc2.pdf|website=unfccc.int|location=Tirana|page=28|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; That means that the climate is characterised by mild winters and hot, dry summers. The warmest areas of the country are along the west, where climate is profoundly impacted by the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The coldest parts of the country are at the north and east, where snowy forested climate is prevalent.

During the [[Iron Age]], Albania was originally home to the [[Illyrians]] and [[Ancient Greeks]]. Following the centuries, it was subsequently conquered and occupied by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]s, [[Venetian Republic|Venetian]]s and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s. The emergence of a unified Albanian state dates back to the establishment of the [[Principality of Arbër]] in 1190 AD.

== Periods ==

=== Antiquity ===

The beginnings of architecture in Albania dates back to the middle [[Neolithic Age]] with the discovery of prehistoric dwellings in Dunavec and [[Maliq]].&lt;ref name="neo"&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization]]|title=Archaeology and art of Albania, Ecuador, China, Bulgaria|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0007/000748/074870eo.pdf|website=unesdoc.unesco.org|pages=4–6|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were built on a wooden platform that rested on stakes stuck vertically into the [[soil]].&lt;ref name="neo"/&gt; Prehistoric dwellings in Albania consist of three types such as houses enclosed either completely on the ground or half underground, both found in [[Cakran]] near [[Fier]] and houses constructed above ground.
[[File:Amphitheatre of durres albania 2016.jpg|210px|thumb|left|The [[Amphitheatre of Durrës]] is on the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Albania#Tentative list|tentative list]] for becoming a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].]]
During the [[Bronze Age]], the [[Illyrians]] and [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] started to organize itself in the territory of Albania. The Illyrians were an [[ethnic group]] with distinct culture and art, while it is believed that [[Albanians]] are the descendants of the Illyrians but no enough evidence is left to get a conclusion. Cities within [[Illyria]] were mainly built on the tops of high mountains surrounded by heavily fortified walls. Further, the history of Albania has not been kind to the Illyrian architectural monuments. Few monuments from the Illyrians are still preserved such as in [[Amantia]], [[Antigonia (Chaonia)|Antigonia]], [[Byllis]], [[Rozafa Castle|Scodra]], [[Lissus]] and [[Royal Tombs of Selca e Poshtme|Selca e Poshtme]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilkes, O., Albania An Archaeological Guide, I.B.Tauris 2012, {{ISBN|1780760698}}, p263&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amphitheatre of Butrint 2009.jpg|210px|thumb|right|[[Butrint]] has been included in the [[UNESCO]] list of [[World Heritage Site]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[UNESCO]]|title=Butrint|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/570|website=whc.unesco.org|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Following the [[Illyrian Wars]], the architecture in Albania developed significantly in the 2nd century BC with the arrival of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]s. The conquered settlements and villages such as [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]], [[Butrint]], [[Byllis]], [[Dyrrachium]] and [[Dropull|Hadrianopolis]] were notably modernised following Roman models, with the building of a forum, roads, theatres, promenades, temples, aqueducts and other social buildings. The period also marks the construction of stadiums and thermal baths that were of social importance as places of gathering.

Previously populated by various [[Illyrian tribes|Illyrian]] and [[Ancient Greek tribes]], [[Butrint]] became a [[protectorate]] and subsequently a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Inge Lyse Hansen|title=Hellenistic and Roman Butrint|publisher=Butrint Foundation, 2009|isbn=9780953555680|url=https://books.google.de/books?hl=de&amp;id=nFoqAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=butrint+roman+architecture&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=butrint+|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Inge Lyse Hansen, Richard Hodges, Sarah Leppard|title=Butrint 4: The Archaeology and Histories of an Ionian Town|publisher=Oxbow Books, 2013|isbn=9781842174623|page=9|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=q3x-AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=butrint+roman+architecture&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjy5_Wkiv3YAhWM2qQKHe_vB7gQ6AEISzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=butrint%20roman%20architecture&amp;f=false|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nowadays, it demonstrates a high level of Roman urbanisation, while it is among the best preserved remains of Roman heritage in Albania. They left its legacy in form of city walls, an aqueduct, the forum, [[basilica]]s, [[Baptistery|baptister]]ies, baths, an [[amphitheatre]] and [[Insulae|houses]] for the middle classes, as well as [[Domus|mansions]] with central courtyards which were decorated with various mosaics and murals.

[[Dyrrachium]] thrived during the Roman period and became a protectorate after the Illyrian Wars. The [[Durrës Amphitheatre|Amphitheatre of Durrës]], which the Romans built, was at that time the largest amphitheatre in the [[Balkan Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Albania|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides, 2015|isbn=9781841628554|page=87|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=ZR3XBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=dyrrachium&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=M0l655960E&amp;sig=vDqIETWT82pXwqFo8RIjF8KK5vU&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiptZu_lP3YAhWQGOwKHVfLDkQ4ChDoAQg2MAE#v=onepage&amp;q=dyrrachium&amp;f=false|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only Roman monument that survived up to the present.

The [[Via Egnatia]], built by [[Roman Senate|Roman Senator]] [[Gnaeus Egnatius]], functioned for two millennia as a multi-purpose highway, which once connected the cities of [[Durrës]] on the [[Adriatic Sea]] in the west to [[Constantinople]] on the [[Marmara Sea]] in the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frank Sear|title=Roman Architecture - Cornell paperbacks|publisher=Cornell University Press, 1983|isbn=9780801492457|page=270|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=Rkdt_p6uvw0C&amp;pg=PA268&amp;lpg=PA268&amp;dq=via+engatia+architecture&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0LgjYep-lP&amp;sig=4X9MRTt4yILklQwVHfeUgBg479M&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjfjIW3kf3YAhXCyKQKHcR1BtQQ6AEITzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=via%20engatia%20architecture&amp;f=false|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the route gave the Roman colonies of the [[Balkans]] a direct connection to Rome.

=== Middle Ages ===

Medieval cities in Albania are classified according to two criteria:

*Cities associated with fortifications, such as Berat and Gjirokastra
*Cities that lie in flat or steep terrains such as Tirana, Kavaja, and Elbasan.

During the [[Middle Ages]], a variety of [[architecture style]]s developed in the form of dwelling, defence, worship and engineering structures.
When the [[Roman Empire]] divided into east and west, Albania remained under the [[Eastern Roman empire|Eastern Roman Empire]]. In behalf to that, the architecture was strongly influenced by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]s. Many extensive churches and monasteries were built during that period mainly in the centre and south of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Agricultural University of Tirana]]|title=Considering Importance of Light in the PostByzantine Church in Central Albania|url=https://www.ijirset.com/upload/2013/november/8B_Considering.pdf|website=ijirset.com|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some inherited historic structures were damaged by invading [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces. In the 13th and 14th centuries, the consolidation of the Albanian feudal principalities gave rise to ''Varosha'', or neighbourhoods outside city walls. Examples of such developments are the [[Arberesh]] principalities centred in [[Petrele]], [[Kruje]] and [[Gjirokastra]] originating from the feudal castle. In the 15th century, close attention was given to protective structures such as the castle fortifications of Lezha, Petrela, [[Devol (Albania)|Devoll]], Butrint, and [[Shkodra]]. More reconstructions took place in strategic points such as the Castle of [[Elbasan]], [[Preza]], [[Tepelena]], and [[Vlora]], the latter being the most important on the coast. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the great Pashaliks of the period such as the Bushati Family, [[Ahmet Kurt Pasha]], and [[Ali Pashe Tepelena]] reconstructed several fortifications such as the Castle of Shkodra, Berat, and Tepelena respectively. It is important to note that Ali Pashe Tepelena embarked on a major castle building campaign throughout Epirus.

[[File:Ardenica Monastery (by Pudelek).JPG|220px|thumb|left|The [[Ardenica Monastery]] near Fier.]]

During the medieval period, mosques in Albania fell into two categories: those covered with a dome, and those with a roof covered hall. The latter were immediately adopted following the Ottoman invasion, by transforming the existing churches of Shkodra, Kruje, Berat, Elbasan and Kanina. For instance, the [[Lead Mosque, Shkodër|Lead Mosque]] built by [[Mustafa Pasha Bushati]] in Shkodra resembles a typical Istanbul mosque.

On the other hand, Christian religious structures inherited many features from their palaeo-Christian predecessors. Between the 16th and 19th centuries, a series of small structures for Christian with simple layouts were built like the [[Voskopoja]] basilica, [[Ardenica Monastery]], and Church of St. Nicholas in Voskopoja. The latter is one of the most valuable architectonic monuments in Albania. Its interior walls are covered with paintings by the renowned painter [[David Selenica]], and by brothers Constantine and Athanasios Zografi.

=== Modern ===

During the 18th century, the city silhouette in Albania began to include places of worship and the Clock Tower. These, together with other social structures such as thermal baths, fountains, and ''[[madrasa|medrese]]'' further enriched the city centre and its neighbourhoods.

In the 19th century, the ''bazaar'' emerges as a production and exchange centre, while the city expands beyond the castle, which completely loses its function and inhabitants. During this period, Shkodra and Korca become important commerce and skilled crafts centres.
 
[[File:Tirana_panorama_2016.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The [[Skanderbeg Square]] in [[Neo-renaissance|Neo-Renaissance]] style.]]

The first half of the 20th century begins with the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] occupation, continues with [[Fan Noli]]'s government, [[King Zog]]'s kingdom, and ends with the Italian invasion. During this time, Albanian medieval towns underwent urban transformations by Austro-Hungarian architects, giving them the appearance of European cities.

The centre of [[Tirana]] was the project of [[Florestano Di Fausto]] and Armando Brasini, well known architects of the [[Benito Mussolini]] period in Italy. Brasini laid the basis for the modern-day arrangement of the ministerial buildings in the city centre.

The plan underwent revisions by the Albanian architect Eshref Frashëri, the Italian architect Castellani, and the Austrian architects Weiss and Kohler. The rectangular parallel road system of Tirana e Re district took shape, while the northern portion of the main Boulevard was opened. These urban plans formed the basis of future developments in Albania after the [[second World War]].

}}

From 1944 to 1991, cities experienced an ordered development with a decline in architectural quality. Massive socialist-styled [[apartment]] complexes, wide roads, and [[factories]] were constructed, while town squares were redesigned and a number of historic buildings demolished.
 
The period after the fall of communism is often described negatively in terms of [[urban area|urban]] development. Kiosks and apartment buildings started to occupy former public areas without planning, while informal districts formed around cities from internal [[Immigration|migrants]] leaving remote rural areas for the western lowland. Decreasing urban space and increased traffic congestion have become major problems as a result of lack of planning. 
As part of the 2014 Administrative Division Reform, all town centres in Albania are being physically redesigned and façades painted to reflect a more Mediterranean look.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shekulli.com.al/web/p.php?id=38109&amp;kat=88 |title=Ndarja e re, mbeten 28 bashki, shkrihen komunat &amp;#124; Shekulli Online |publisher=Shekulli.com.al |date=2014-01-10 |accessdate=2014-02-15 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140113102623/http://www.shekulli.com.al/web/p.php?id=38109&amp;kat=88# |archive-date=2014-01-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reformaterritoriale.al/ |title=Reforma Territoriale - KRYESORE |publisher=Reformaterritoriale.al |accessdate=2014-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although much has been achieved, critics argue that there is no clear vision on Tirana's future. Some of the pressing issues facing Tirana are loss of public space due to illegal and chaotic construction, unpaved roads in suburban areas, degradation of Tirana's Artificial Lake, rehabilitation of Skanderbeg Square, an ever-present smog, the construction of a central bus station and lack of public parking space. Future plans include the construction of the Multimodal Station of Tirana and the tram line, rehabilitation of the Tiranë River area, construction of a new boulevard along the former Tirana Railway Station and the finishing of the Big Ring Road.

=== Berat ===
{{See also|Berat}}

[[File:Berat UNESCO 2016 Albania.jpg|210px|thumb|Scenic view over Gorica.]]

[[Berat]], otherwise known as the city of a thousand windows, is a small city in Southern Albania. The architecture of Berat is diverse and enfolds the inheritance of the [[Illyrians]] and [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] but also of various peoples and empires that have previously ruled the city among others the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. Nevertheless, the cityscape is notably embossed by the [[Ottoman architecture|architectural style]] of the Ottomans and boasts a wealth of structures of exceptional [[History of Albania|historical]] and [[Albanian art|architectural]] interest. This led the city to become a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].

[[File:Old town of berat albania 3.jpg|210px|thumb|left|The old town of Berat is dominated by Ottoman houses.]]

The city is separated intro three parts such as the residential quarter within the fortress or known as Kalaja, Mangalem and Gorica. The [[Berat Castle|Kalaja]] is believed to have been found in antiquity as it was the settlement of the [[Illyrian tribe|Illyrian]] tribe of the [[Illyrian tribe#Deretini|Desaretes]].&lt;ref name="briefhis"&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[UNESCO]]|title=Brief description of Berat|url=http://www.unesco.org/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/FIELD/Venice/pdf/special_events/Berat1.pdf|website=unesco.org|location=Berat|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, it was known as [[Antipatrea]] when the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]s conquered the city and called it Albanorum Oppidum.&lt;ref name="briefhis"/&gt; Over the centuries it has been subject to numerous conquest by the Byzantines and Ottomans.

Kalaja is well-preserved and consists of numerous houses, most of which are built of stone. Numerous churches with extraordinary decorated [[icon]]s and [[mural]]s still survives including the [[Holy Trinity Church, Berat|Holy Trinity Church]] and [[St. Mary of Blachernae Church, Berat|St. Mary of Blachernae Church]]. Islamic architecture is represented with the ruins of the [[Red Mosque, Berat|Red Mosque]] and [[White Mosque, Berat|White Mosque]]. Worth seeing is the [[cistern]] that was constructed by the Romans. The prominent [[Onufri Museum of Icons]] is also located within the castle and displays works of [[Onufri]] and other important Albanian painter.

[[File:Berat_-_kalaja.jpg|210px|thumb|Remains of the [[Berat Castle]].]]

Houses within the Mangalem quarter were built along a steep hill towards the Gorica quarter. The facades that faces the valley have characteristically [[overhang (architecture)|overhanging windows]]. Therefore, Berat owes its titel to the district, the "city of a thousand windows". There are three Ottoman mosques that include the [[King Mosque, Berat|King Mosque]], [[Lead Mosque, Berat|Lead Mosque]] and notably the [[Bachelors' Mosque|Bachelors Mosque]]. The [[Halveti Teqe, Berat|Halveti Teqe]] stands behind the King Mosque and enclose an impressive carved ceiling.

Gorica was for a long time only connected through the [[Gorica Bridge]] to the rest of Berat. It is among the most popular Ottoman bridges in Albania that was built in 1780 by [[Ahmet Kurt Pasha|Ahmed Kurt Pasha]]. The Saint Spyridon Monastery is another prominent attraction due to its admirable [[Post-Byzantine architecture|Post-Byzantine style]].

=== Korçë ===
{{See also|Korçë}}

[[File:Korca,_Albania_2017.jpg|210px|thumb|right|The [[Resurrection Cathedral, Korçë|Resurrection Cathedral]] in the center.]]

The architecture in [[Korçë]] is characterised by mansions and residential buildings, cobbled streets and wide boulevards with many cafés and restaurants. There is an architectural mix, due to the turbulent history, of [[Art Nouveau]], [[Neoclassicism]] and [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman]] styles. Italian and French influences increased after the beginning of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In modernising its infrastructure through the centuries, the city has preserved some of its history in its streets and facades.

[[File:Korca_Old_Bazaar.jpg|210px|thumb|left|The [[Old Bazaar of Korçë|Old Bazaar]] during reconstructions.]]

The city was an important trade and economic centre during the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Machiel Kiel|title=Ottoman architecture in Albania (1385-1912)|date=1990|location=Istanbul|isbn=9290633301|page=163|edition=Research Centre for Islamic History, Art and Culture|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Ottoman rule, the [[Old Bazaar of Korçë|Old Bazaar]] developed rapidly to become the city's main centre of commerce. Although [[bazaar]]s were typical Ottoman trading complexes developed in the towns of Albania and elsewhere in the [[Balkans]]. The Ottoman architecture is predominant within the bazaar, while recent reconstructions have led to the application of elements specific to [[modern architecture]].

The [[Resurrection Cathedral, Korçë|Resurrection Cathedral]] is located in the center north of Bulevardi Republika. It is one of the largest [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] [[cathedral]]s in Albania, as well as one of the city's symbols and primary tourist attractions. The cathedral is a [[Nave|three-nave]] structure and belongs to [[Byzantine style]]. It stands slightly elevated on an [[Podium|estrade]] and consists mainly of cream-white to ivory-colored stones and red bricks. The interior walls and domes are decorated with [[icon]]s and [[fresco]]es.

The [[Mirahori Mosque]] was built in 1484 and founded by [[Iljaz Bey Mirahor]]. The [[minaret]] and dome of the building was damaged by an earthquake and was recently restored. It consists of white [[limestone]] blocks that lie on layers of red bricks. It is only one of the few monuments of the Ottoman period in the city and the surrounding county.

The [[Dormition of the Theotokos Church, Labovë e Kryqit|Dormition of the Theotokos Church]] in [[Labovë e Kryqit]] is one of the greatest surviving examples of Byzantine architecture in the country. Its interior is decorated with various mosaics and [[fresco]]es and coverings of great artistic value. It is a typically Byzantine church with a high central dome with nave and aisles arranged in a cruciform plan.

The [[St. Anthony Church, Durrës|St. Anthony Church]] of [[Durrës]] is another important example of Byzantine architecture. It was built in the [[Cape of Rodon]], owning a direct proximity to the [[Adriatic Sea]]. The structure was built in the 14th century and stands close to the [[Rodoni Castle]], which was built by [[Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg]].

The monastery is an impressive representative of Byzantine architecture with many [[Romanesque architecture|romanesque features]].  
 
The history of Albania has not been kind to Early Christian architectural monuments. Scattered throughout the country, there are still structures and remains of churches and monasteries from that period such as the [[Holy Trinity Church, Berat|Holy Trinity Church]] of [[Berat]], [[St. Nicholas Monastery Church, Mesopotam|St. Nicholas Monastery Church]] in [[Mesopotam]], [[St. Mary's Church, Maligrad|St. Mary's Church]] of [[Prespa National Park|Maligrad]], [[St. Mary of Blachernae Church (Berat)|St. Mary of Blachernae Church]] of Berat, [[Paleochristian Church, Lin|Paleochristian]] and [[Byzantine Church, Lin|Byzantine Church of Lin]].

The combinations of brick and stone were very frequent in [[Ottoman architecture]], while brick was used mainly for arches, domes and vaults. Further, the most characteristic feature of those mosques is the dominance of a dome, having a semi-circular flat profile, that covered the significant part of the prayer hall within the mosque. The elegance of various Islamic elements is blended in and adapted into buildings and interior designs such as the use of tiling, geometric designs, floral motifs and murals.

The scenic [[Geography of Albania|landscapes]] of Albania are dotted with [[castle]]s, [[Fortification|fort]]s and [[citadel]]s in all shapes and sizes. Previously they was mostly defined by their practical use to repel invasions and often serve as a royal residence for noble families. Those structures constitute treasures and legacy of the [[History of Albania|historic past]] of Albania. The first castles in the Albanian lands were built by [[Illyrians]] and [[Romans]] and later by [[Venetian Republic|Venetians]] and [[Ottomans]]. The majority have been renovated throughout history and different epoches with changing rule and adaptations to war technology development.

[[File:Muzeum Skanderbega w Kruji 2.jpg|210px|thumb|left|The medieval [[Krujë Castle|Castle of Krujë]].]]

It stands in a very strategic point near the mouth of [[Shkumbin|Shkumbin River]] close to the [[Adriatic Sea]]. The castle is a typical Venetian structure that combined the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] lancet arch with Byzantine and Ottoman influences.

[[Petrelë Castle]] is a medieval castle located on a hilltop overlooking [[Petrelë]] and [[Erzen river|Erzen Valley]]. The castle has a triangular structure with two observation towers. The early fortifications probably dates from the 3rd century, while in the 9th century it was expanded and served as a base for [[Gjergj Kastrioti Skënderbeu]] during its revolt against the [[Ottoman Empire]].

The [[Rodoni Castle]] stand within the [[Cape of Rodon]] with a proximity to the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Its name is derived from the [[Illyrian Gods|Illyrian god]] of Rodon. After the [[First Siege of Krujë]] and [[League of Lezhë]], the [[Kastrioti family|Kastrioti]]s decided to increase the fortifications for the use against the Ottomans. Skanderbeg chose the Cape of Rodon as the location of the castle and construction began in 1450.

=== Kullas ===

[[File:Old Albanian house.JPG|thumb|210px|A model of an Albanian house.]][[File:Gjirokastër – Zekate House 01 – front.jpg|thumb|210px|Zekate House in [[Gjirokastër]].]][[File:LockInTower.jpg|thumb|210px|So-called "locked tower" in [[Theth]] within the [[Albanian Alps]] in the north of [[Albania]].]]

[[Tower houses in the Balkans|Kulla]] were fortified tower houses that flourished between the 17th and 19th centuries as a result of resistance to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman conquest]], [[Albanian Renaissance|national renaissance]] and emergence of [[capitalism]]. In most cases, they take the form of an extended family house. However, a house for two brothers can also be found.
 
According to their spatial and planning composition, Albanian houses are classified and separated into four major groups:&lt;ref&gt;http://acp.al/post.php?id=56&lt;/ref&gt;
 
* Houses with vater zjarri, or fireplace/hearth: These type of houses are primarily found in [[Tirana County]] and characterized by the house of fire (''Shtëpia e Zjarrit''), which takes up the height of two floors, with surrounding areas interacting around it. 
* Houses with hajat, or porch: A distinguishing feature of this style is the relationship of the house with the backyard and natural [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Oftentimes, these houses are built on flat grounds, with the ground floor used by inhabitants for agricultural purposes. For example, the Shijaku House in [[Tirana]] is surrounded by adobe walls with a large gate entrance, and almost always covered with a simple roof.
* Houses with ''çardak'', a type of balcony found on the top floor reserved for guests or relaxation: They are mostly found in [[Berat]], and less so in [[Kruje]] and [[Lezha]]. The cardak is a dominant element of the building's outer composition being on the main facade of the house, originally designed to be open. The cardak is extensively used by dwellers in the warm season by exploiting the natural sunlight. It also serves as liaison with other areas of the house. These houses are divided into several sub types: houses with cardak on the front area, on one side, or at the center. An example of such structures is Hajdar Sejdini House in [[Elbasan]]. 
* Urban or civic ''kulla'': They are found in [[Gjirokaster]] (see [[Zekate House]]), Berat, Kruje, and [[Shkoder]] used for defensive and warehouse purposes. The interior showed the extent of family's wealth, while the ground floor served as a safe place for cattle in the winter, and to keep water reserves for the dry summer months.

The southern urban or civic Kullas are found in the cities and surroundings of [[Berat]], [[Gjirokastër]], [[Himara]] and [[Këlcyrë]].&lt;ref&gt;Stubbs-Makaš 2011, [https://books.google.com/books?id=goCJx26btm0C&amp;pg=PA392&amp;dq=kule+tower+houses p. 392]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=LF-vT_KkIsfR8gOhnpDECQ&amp;hl=el&amp;id=UV1oAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22tower+houses%22+paramythia&amp;q=%22tower+houses%22#search_anchor Epirus, 4000 years of Greek history and civilization.] p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; Tower-houses in Gjirokastër were built in the 13th century predating Ottoman conquest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=d1yvT4PxDci48gO_7YnGCQ&amp;hl=el&amp;id=89ZKAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=byzantine+%22tower+houses%22&amp;q=%22cityscape+characterised+by+undulating+terrain+and+fortified+tower+houses%2C+imposing+fortifications+dating+from+the%22#search_anchor Internationale Tourismusattraktionen in Mittel- und Südosteuropa]. Österreichisches Ost- und Südosteuropa-Institut, 1999, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The northern Kullas are a heavily fortified residential building built in the north of Albania and [[Metohija|Dukagjin]] region of [[Kosovo]]. They contain small windows and shooting holes because their main purpose was to offer security from attack. Further they have been initially built from wood and stone and eventually only from stone.

The first Kullas were built in the 17th century, a time when there was continuous fighting in the Dukagjini region, although most of the ones that still remain are from the 18th or 19th century. They have been almost always built within a complex of buildings with various functions but Kullas in villages exists mostly as standalone structures. They are also positioned within the complex of buildings so that the inhabitants can look out over the surrounding area. Kullas in towns are usually built as standalone structures, while in villages they are more commonly found as a part of a larger ensemble of Kullas and stone houses, usually grouped together for the family clan they belonged to.

Certain Kullas were used as places of isolation and safe havens or "locked towers" (Kulla Ngujimi) intended for the use of persons targeted by [[gjakmarrja|blood feud]]s; an example can be found in [[Theth]].&lt;ref name="McAdamArcy2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marika McAdam|author2=Jayne d' Arcy|author3=Chris Deliso|author4=Peter Dragicevic|title=Western Balkans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5PSBrPoGf-8C&amp;pg=PA92|accessdate=11 May 2012|date=2 May 2009|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74104-729-5|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Kullas are three-story buildings. A characteristic unit of its architectural structure in "Oda e Burrave" (Chamber of Men or Gathering Room of Men), which was usually placed in the second floor of the Kulla, called Divanhane, while the ground floor served as a barn for cattle and the first floor was where the family quarters were located. The material from which the Divanhane is constructed, either wood or stone, is sometimes used to classify Kullas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Kulla of Mazrekaj family in Dranoc|date = |last = Limani|first = Jeta|url = http://www.lth.se/fileadmin/hdm/alumni/papers/CMHB_2007/Kosova___Jeta_Limani_-_Kulla_of_Mazrekaj_Family.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Arkitektura Vernakulare në Kosovë|last = Doli|first = Flamur|publisher = Association for the Preservation of Architectonic Heritage - SHRTA|year = 2009|isbn = 9789951878609|location = Prishtinë|pages = 93–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Are We Done Yet?''''' is a 2007 American [[family film|family]] [[comedy film]] starring [[Ice Cube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schager|first=Nick|title=Are We Done Yet?|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/are-we-done-yet/2798|work=Slant Magazine|date=March 29, 2007|accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is a loose remake of the 1948 [[Cary Grant]] comedy ''[[Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House]]'' and a sequel to the 2005 comedy ''[[Are We There Yet? (film)|Are We There Yet?]]'' The film was directed by [[Steve Carr]] from a screenplay by Hank Nelken. It was produced by [[Revolution Studios]] and [[RKO Pictures]] and distributed by [[Columbia Pictures]]. The film was shot on location in [[Tsawwassen]], [[British Columbia]], Canada, but is set in [[Newberg, Oregon]], United States.

==Plot==
Following the events of ''[[Are We There Yet? (film)|Are We There Yet?]]'', Nick Persons ([[Ice Cube]]) has married Suzanne ([[Nia Long]]) and moved her, Kevin ([[Philip Daniel Bolden]]), and Lindsey (Aleisha Allen) into his apartment, also purchasing a 2007 [[Cadillac Escalade]] (after he accidentally blew up his [[Lincoln Navigator]] SUV in the previous film by leaving the lighter unattended inside). He has also sold his sports memorabilia store to his best friend, Marty (played by [[Jay Mohr]] in the first film). The family has also got a [[Berger Picard]] and named it Coco. While getting ready for an interview with [[Magic Johnson]] to launch a sports magazine, Suzanne tells Nick that she is pregnant and they later find out that there will be twins. 

For more space, Suzanne and Nick go check out a house in the suburbs. They meet Chuck Mitchell Jr. ([[John C. McGinley]]), the resident real-estate agent/contractor there, and after some talking, Nick decides to take the house. The family then packs up their things and moves into the house, with Lindsey and Kevin (mostly the former) being against it. However, as it turns out, Nick failed to get the house inspected first, and they soon find a mold infestation, and Nick becomes angry with Chuck as while trying to resolve the mold issue, he discovers even more problems with the house, and almost destroys it trying to fix them all. Meanwhile, Lindsey sneaks out to go to a party with one of the teenage workers who is Chuck's friend, and when Nick finds out, he grounds her. He finally decides to fire Chuck, which causes all those working on the house to quit out of loyalty to Chuck, and Suzanne to take the kids and move into the guest house, with the parting shot, "You're the one tearing this family apart, Nick!" After taking some time to think, Nick decides to fix the house on his own and also to apologize to Chuck, especially when he was told that Chuck lost his wife a few years previously. Chuck responds by bringing his friends back to help.

When Suzanne goes into labor with the hospital half an hour away, Nick, Kevin and Lindsey have to deliver the babies. Chuck tries to get there, but his truck breaks down and he is forced to power walk down to the house. While she's still in labor, Nick gets a call from Magic. After Suzanne gives birth to twin boys, the movie ends six months later with a big barbecue in their backyard at which Nick debuts his new magazine titled ''Are We Done Yet?'', based on his experience building the house.

'''''Art and Scholasticism''''' ({{lang-fr|Art et scolastique}}) is a 1920 book by the philosopher [[Jacques Maritain]], his major contribution to [[aesthetics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hal05|Haldane 2005]]. p. 555.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gary Furnell, the work "was a key text that guided the work of writers such as [[Allen Tate]], [[Caroline Gordon]], Sally and [[Robert Fitzgerald]], [[François Mauriac|Francois Mauriac]], [[Thomas Merton]], [[John Howard Griffin]], [[Flannery O'Connor|Flannery O’Connor]] and [[T. S. Eliot|T.S. Eliot]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fu15|Furnell 2015]]. p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Maritain's Thomist-Aristotelian distinction between Art and Prudence was highly influential on the sculptor [[Eric Gill]], and were developed further in the seminal essay on theological aesthetics, entitled 'Art and Sacrament', by poet and painter [[David Jones (artist-poet)|David Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epoch and Artist|last=Jones|first=David|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|year=1955|isbn=978-0571242054|location=|pages=143-179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is located in the [[Civic Center, San Francisco|Civic Center]] of [[San Francisco]], [[California]], in the United States. The {{Convert|15|ft|adj=on}} [[statue]] depicting the Assyrian [[Ashurbanipal|king of the same name]] was commissioned by the Assyrian Foundation for the Arts and presented to the City of San Francisco in 1988 as a gift from the [[Assyrian people]]. The sculpture reportedly cost $100,000 and was the first "sizable" bronze statue of Ashurbanipal.&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt; It is administered by the City and County of San Francisco and the [[San Francisco Arts Commission]].

Parhad's work was met with some criticism by local Assyrians, who argued it was inaccurate to portray Ashurbanipal holding a [[clay tablet]] and a lion, or wearing a [[skirt]]. The critics thought the statue looked more like the [[Sumer]]ian king [[Gilgamesh]]; Renee Kovacs, a "scholar and self-stated Assyriologist", believed the sculpture depicted neither figure, but rather a [[Mesopotamia]]n "protective figure". Parhad defended the accuracy of his work, while also admitting that he took [[Artistic license|artistic liberties]].&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Hero lion Dur-Sharrukin Louvre AO19862.jpg|thumb|left|Possible representation of Enkidu as [[Master of Animals]] grasping a lion and snake, in an [[Assyrian palace relief]], from [[Dur-Sharrukin]], now Louvre]]
In [[Assyrian sculpture]], the famous colossal entrance way guardian figures of ''[[lamassu]]'' were often accompanied by a hero grasping a wriggling lion with one hand and typically a snake with the other, also colossal and in high relief; these are generally the only other types of high relief in Assyrian sculpture.  They continue the [[Master of Animals]] tradition in Mesopotamian art, and may represent [[Enkidu]], a central figure in the [[Ancient Mesopotamia]]n ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''.  In the palace of [[Sargon II]] at [[Khorsabad]], a group of at least seven ''lamassu'' and two such heroes with lions surrounded the entrance to the "throne room", "a concentration of figures which produced an overwhelming impression of power."&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Frankfort|Frankfort, Henri]], ''The Art and Architecture of the Ancient Orient'', pp. 147-148, 148 quoted, Pelican History of Art, 4th ed 1970, Penguin (now Yale History of Art), {{ISBN|0140561072}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The arrangement was repeated in [[Sennacherib]]'s palace at [[Nineveh]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, John M., Section 6.

==History==
''Ashurbanipal'' was designed by Fred Parhad, an [[Iraq]]i-born artist of [[Assyria]]n descent.

The {{Convert|8|ft|adj=on}} [[patina]]ted [[bronze]] statue,&lt;ref name=Smithsonian/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt; mounted on a base and a [[plinth]] to reach a total height of {{Convert|15|ft}}, weighs approximately {{Convert|1800|lb}}. It depicts Ashurbanipal, the Assyrian king known for building the eponymously named [[Library of Ashurbanipal]], the first and largest library in [[Nineveh]].&lt;ref name=Ishaya/&gt; The bearded king is shown wearing [[earring]]s and a [[tunic]]; he is holding a book (or [[clay tablet]]) in one arm and a lion cub in the other.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt; According to the Historical Marker Database, the tablet reads in [[cuneiform]]: "Peace unto heaven and earth / Peace unto countries and cities / Peace unto the dwellers in all lands / This is the statue presented to the City of San Francisco by the Assyrian people in the 210th year of America's sovereignty".&lt;ref name=HMD&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=32080|title=Ashurbanipal Monument|accessdate=August 9, 2013|publisher=Historical Marker Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "larger-than-life", full length statue stands above a plinth adorned with a lotus blossom design and a [[concrete]] base with an [[anti-graffiti coating]].&lt;ref name=Smithsonian/&gt; The base includes rosettes and a bronze plaque.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian/&gt; One inscription below the statue reads the text of the tablet in English, [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] cuneiform and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]. The text "Ashurbanipal, King of Assyria, 669–627 B.C." appears above and the text "Dedicated May 29, 1988" appears below, both in English.&lt;ref name=HMD/&gt; Another inscription below the statue reads, "Presented to the City of San Francisco by the Assyrian Foundation for the Arts through donations of American Assyrian Association of San Francisco / Assyrian American National Federation", followed by a list of names of donors.&lt;ref name=HMD/&gt; In December 2010, the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' reported that a large plaque from the sculpture was missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/Passenger-climbs-aboard-needles-and-all-2453277.php|title=Passenger climbs aboard, needles and all|date=December 17, 2010|first= Leah|last=Garchik|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=August 9, 2013|issn=1932-8672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:San Francisco Civic Center Historic District 11.jpg|thumb|right|The statue, mounted on its base in front of the [[Asian Art Museum of San Francisco|Asian Art Museum]], in 2011]]

In December 1987, as news began to circulate about the commissioned work, local Assyrians accused Parhad of misrepresenting Ashurbanipal. Criticisms included the depiction of the king holding both a book and a lion, which they argued he "wouldn't do", and for dressing him in a skirt, which they claimed he would never have worn.&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt; The critics thought the statue made a better portrayal of the [[Sumer]]ian king [[Gilgamesh]]. One critic said: &lt;blockquote&gt;It's very simple. The statue represents Gilgamesh.... No Assyrian has a right to imagine things about our king. It's exactly like making a copy of the Statue of Liberty and saying it is George Washington.... Assyrian kings didn't wear miniskirts. They wouldn't have been holding a lion or a book. It's an insult to the Assyrians.&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Narsai David responded: &lt;blockquote&gt;They are entitled to their opinion.... We have never said this is a museum-quality reproduction.... We have always said this is a characterization of Ashurbanipal as done by a 20th-century artist. If they choose to think of this as Gilgamesh, they are free to do so.&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Renee Kovacs, a "scholar and self-stated Assyriologist", said the statue depicted neither Ashurbanipal or Gilgamesh, but rather a [[Mesopotamia]]n "protective figure, like a guard."&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt; Parhad defended the accuracy of his work, while also admitting that he took [[Artistic license|artistic liberties]] and attempted to incorporate the various aspects of Assyrian culture, from its hunting mastery to its admiration for writing. He said of the sculpture: &lt;blockquote&gt;The piece has authentic qualities to it, but it is also my statue.... With the earrings and the clothing and the hair and his daggers, it is Ashurbanipal. But in the choice of (stance), the fact that he is holding a tablet and a lion, that is mine. I wanted myself to be represented in the piece.&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Assault at West Point''''' is a 1994 Showtime made-for-cable [[docudrama]] about [[Johnson Chesnut Whittaker]], one of the first black cadets at [[United States Military Academy|West Point]], and the trial that followed an assault he suffered in 1880. The film features [[Samuel L. Jackson]], who portrays a lawyer who defends Whittaker.

==Plot==
Johnson Whittaker, a black cadet at West Point, is attacked by three fellow students. The school administrators court-martial Whittaker in the mistaken belief that he staged his own attack, supposedly to avoid a philosophy exam.

The assault on him by fellow cadets quickly makes its way into the press and gained widespread attention. [[Richard Theodore Greener|Richard Greener]] is the Harvard alumnus [[lawyer]] who defends Whittaker at his trial and, since he is also black, has also personally experienced [[racism]]. Greener's partner, [[Daniel Henry Chamberlain|Daniel Chamberlain]], does not share his determination but rather has a different agenda – acquiring fame.

The trial begins and the two lawyers are at odds with one another. The prosecutor, Major [[Asa Bird Gardiner]], cross-examines Whittaker, who manages to evade his tactics. On the day the verdict is to be delivered, the judge whose vote they had hoped would be favorable does not show up in court. The other two judges find Whittaker guilty of assaulting himself so as not to participate in the exam.

The film closes in later years, with Whittaker being interviewed by a reporter. Whittaker tells him that he went on to become a school principal, while Greener is now retired. He also informs the reporter that Chamberlain later went on to defend [[lynching]]. "People will sometimes do anything to gather fame", states Whittaker, to which the reporter replies, "I wonder what hidden agenda he was carrying". The film ends with the reporter telephoning the newspaper and telling them to hold the first page; he has a great story.

'''Bastar Wooden Crafts''' are traditional Indian [[wood]]en crafts that are manufactured in the [[Bastar district|Bastar]] district of [[Chhattisgarh]] state, [[India]]. The wood-crafting work has been protected under the [[Geographical indication]] (GI) of the [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPS) agreement. It is listed at item 84 as "Bastar Wooden Craft" of the GI Act 1999 of the Government of India with registration confirmed by the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ipindia.nic.in/girindia/treasures_protected/registered_GI_18November2015.pdf|title=State Wise Registration Details Of G.I Applications|accessdate=4 February 2016|publisher=Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201065403/http://ipindia.nic.in/girindia/treasures_protected/registered_GI_18November2015.pdf|archivedate=1 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally people in Chhattisgarh, especially Bastar people have excellent skills in variety of craft work including [[Dhokra]], bamboo craft, wrought iron craft, tribal dress, traditional textile, Kantha embroidery, [[terracotta]], tribal painting, [[bell metal]], etc. Their skills have been recognized by national and state awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cghandicraft.com/state-award.aspx |title=AWARD LIST |publisher=Chhattisgarh Handicrafts Development Board |accessdate=4 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206232302/http://www.cghandicraft.com/state-award.aspx |archivedate=6 February 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Badhai]] people are skilled in this woodcraft work and they are divided into two groups.

The Murias are best in craftsmanship. Their skill apply in various objects that from small to big.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=History, Religion and Culture of India, Volume 5 | publisher=Gyan Publishing House | author=Gajrani, S. | pages=310 | isbn=8182050642}}&lt;/ref&gt; They turn craft skills into interpretation of basic lifestyles and basic routines of life such as [[threshing|chaffing]] of paddy, [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]] grains, etc. They express their culture and religious faiths into craft art that reflect through gods, goddess, music culture of the community and wildlife. The craft work heavily depended as hand-made where there is no machinery usage or rare use in particular areas only.

Woodcraft in Bastar has beautiful and unique form of art that was mastered by Bastar tribal and it helps their livelihood.

[[File:BlakeMalkin.jpg|thumb|William Blake's frontispiece to ''A Father's Memoirs of his Child'' (1806), combining a portrait with a symbolic image of the child's soul departing the earth]]
'''Benjamin Heath Malkin''' ({{Birth date|1769|03|23|df=y}}, London - {{Death date and age|1842|05|26|1769|03|23|df=y}} at [[Cowbridge]]&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;G. Martin Murphy, [[Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]&lt;/ref&gt;) was a British scholar and writer notable for his connection to the artist and poet [[William Blake]].

==Career and education==
Malkin was educated at [[Harrow School]] and [[Cambridge University]], receiving his MA in 1802 and his doctorate in 1810. In 1795 he published ''Essays on Subjects connected with Civilization'' (C. Dilly, London). From 1809 to 1828 he was headmaster of [[Bury St Edmunds Free School]], where he taught a number of pupils who would later go on to become [[Cambridge Apostles]].&lt;ref&gt;G. E. Bentley Jr, ''Blake Records'', 285 fn.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1829, Malkin became the first professor of History in the newly formed London University.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; During his scholarly career he published both historical and creative works on many subjects, including the history of South Wales, a translation of [[Gil Blas]], and the play ''Almahide and Hamet''.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, ''The Gentleman's Magazine'', 1842, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;   He contributed biographies to ''[[Rees's Cyclopædia]]''.

==Connections with Blake==
Today he is remembered for his 1806 book ''A Father's Memoirs of his Child'', which leads off with a 48-page introduction consisting of a dedication to his friend [[Thomas Johnes]] and the earliest biographical account of Blake. Blake had designed (though it was engraved by [[Robert Cromek]]) the frontispiece depicting Malkin's deceased son.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; G. E. Bentley suggests that Malkin met Blake in 1803, soon after Blake returned to London from his three years in Felpham.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley, 223&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also possible that the two men were acquainted via the publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]] for whom Blake had worked.  [[William Godwin]] reports meeting Malkin at dinner at [[Horne Tooke]]'s in 1796 and 1797 and at [[Henry Fuseli|Fuseli]]'s Milton Gallery in 1800.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley, 223 fn.&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore likely that Blake and Malkin shared radical sympathies.  Malkin also lived close to Blake's patron Thomas Butts in Hackney, London and knew [[George Cumberland]], another friend.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley, 285 fn.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to a short biography of Blake, Malkin published a number of Blake's lyric poems. This was the first time they had been published other than in Blake's own original illuminated etchings. Before the publication of [[Alexander Gilchrist]]'s ''[[Life of William Blake]]'' in 1863, Malkin's book was the principal means of public knowledge of Blake's poetry. [[William Wordsworth]] copied poems from it.

==''A Father's Memoirs of His Child''==

''A Father's Memoirs of His Child'' is an account of the life and death of Malkin's son Thomas Williams Malkin, who along with his brother Benjamin is described as a [[child prodigy]] with an insatiable thirst for knowledge. He apparently learned the alphabet from blocks as an infant and would point to the correct letters when they were named. He did not speak until he was about two years old. Before he was three, he taught himself to write by copying print in books. Malkin insists that he did not push Thomas but followed his lead and taught him subjects such as Latin or mathematics only by request. Thomas also invented an [[Fictional country|imaginary country]] called Allestone, including details of its history, geography and monetary system, and an elaborate (for a five-year-old) map. Much of this material is included in the book, partly as proof that Thomas acted independently and was not coerced to achievements.

The book was written in part because of a confrontation with a "medical expert" the day after Thomas' death. It was his stated belief that Thomas had died of so-called "water on the brain", citing Thomas' "large head" and high intelligence as symptomatic of this disease. In effect, he accused Malkin of causing his son's death through having allowed him to overindulge in mental activity. Thus, Malkin includes the medical details of Thomas' final illness. He also ordered an autopsy, which he says proved conclusively that Thomas died of [[inflammatory bowel disease]] and [[peritonitis]], and that his brain was perfectly normal. Malkin's grief and frustration are expressed vividly in this part of the text.&lt;ref&gt;Malkin, Benjamin Heath, ''[https://archive.org/details/fathersmemoirsof00malk A Father's Memoirs of His Child]''. Published 1806 and available at the Internet Archive as of 2009-03-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Malkin's other children survived to adulthood. Benjamin Jr. became a [[barrister]]. He worked in the Imperial legal service, first as [[List of Recorders of Penang, Singapore and Malacca|Recorder]] of [[Penang]], and later as one of the [[Puisne]] Judges of [[Calcutta]], for which he was knighted. He was noted for his high intelligence and pleasant manner. He married and had two children, including [[Herbert Malkin]], lawyer and cricketer. He died in 1838.

Frederic, who was an infant when Thomas died, wrote several books on history including a history of Greece. [[Arthur Malkin|Arthur]], the youngest, also wrote historical textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dinah Craik]], "A Child's Life Sixty Years Ago." In [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/abj7528.0001.001/43?page=root;size=100;view=image The Unkind Word &amp; Other Stories]. London: Hurst and Blackett, Publishers, 13, Great Marlborough Street, 1870. Craik criticizes Malkin for acceding to Thomas' requests to be educated at an early age and believes it did overtax his brain and contribute to his death; but she also admits that the other boys did well in life.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frederic Malkin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lRMMAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false History of Greece from the earliest times to its final subjection to Rome]''. London: Baldwin &amp; Craddock, Paternoster Row, 1829.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas' "Allestone" [[paracosm]] came to the attention of fantasy fans in 1973 when the map was reprinted in ''[[An Atlas of Fantasy]]'' by Jeremiah Post.

A '''book sales club''' is a [[subscription]]-based method of selling and purchasing [[book]]s. It is more often called simply a '''book club''', a term that is also used to describe a [[book discussion club]], which can cause confusion.

==How book sales clubs work==
Each member of a book sales club agrees to receive books by mail and pay for them as they are received. This may be done by means of [[negative option billing]], in which the customer receives an announcement of the book, or books, along with a form to notify the seller if the customer does not want the book: if the customer fails to return the form by a specified date, the seller will ship the book and expect the customer to pay for it. Alternatively, the business may operate via a "positive option", in which the customer is periodically sent a list of books offered, but none is sent until the customer specifically orders them.  The offer of a free book, often a large one, is a frequent enticement to membership. The Compact Edition of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' for years served this purpose. Some clubs offer new members other (non-book) free gifts, such as book notes or reading lights.

Some book sales clubs are "continuity" clubs, which send members a certain number of books (selected by the club or the member) every month until the membership expires or is cancelled. Harlequin Book Clubs are typical of such clubs. Other book sales clubs are "commitment" clubs, which require members to order a certain number of books in order to fulfill the membership obligation and cancel the membership. Most [[Book of the Month Club|Book-of-the-Month Clubs]] are commitment clubs.

Book sales clubs typically sell books at a sizable [[discounts and allowances|discount]] from their list prices. Often, the books sold are editions created specifically for sale by the clubs, and are manufactured more cheaply and less durably than the regular editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.abaa.org/glossary/entry/book-club-edition |title=Book club edition |website=ABAA Glossary of Terms |publisher=Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of America |access-date=January 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Book of the Month Club|Book-of-the-Month Club]] (founded 1926) is an early and well known example of this kind of business. Others include the Science Fiction Book Club, the Mystery Book Club, and the Quality Paperback Book Club, all of which are run by Booksonline / Doubleday Entertainment (a subsidiary of [[Bookspan]]). The largest book of the month clubs have millions of members.

[[Time-Life]] book produced a large number of book series in the book sales club format, including the [[Time Reading Program]].

==Text publication societies==
In 19th-century Britain, the term ''book club'' was sometimes applied to [[text publication society|text publication societies]]. Like the modern clubs, these were membership organizations whose members would receive publications automatically in return for their subscriptions. The books were usually scholarly editions of old works of historical or literary interest, or of [[archives|archival records]], which had been edited and published specifically (and often exclusively) for distribution to society members. The oldest of these societies was the highly exclusive [[Roxburghe Club]], founded in London in 1812. Although many of the 19th-century societies have ceased to exist, others (including the Roxburghe Club) continue to survive and flourish, and new societies continue to be founded. The modern societies mostly focus on publishing editions of archival records, and are now more usually known as record or records societies.

'''Bookselling''' is the commercial trading of [[book]]s which is the [[retail]] and distribution end of the [[publishing]] process. People who engage in bookselling are called '''booksellers''', '''bookwomen''', or '''bookmen'''. The founding of libraries in 300 BC stimulated the energies of the [[Athens|Athenian]] booksellers. In [[Rome]], toward the end of the republic, it became the fashion to have a library, and Roman booksellers carried on a flourishing trade.

The spread of [[Christianity]] naturally created a great demand for copies of the [[Gospel]]s, other sacred books, and later on for missals and other devotional volumes for both church and private use. The modern system of bookselling dates from soon after the introduction of [[printing]]. In the course of the 16th and 17th centuries the Low Countries for a time became the chief centre of the bookselling world. Modern book selling has changed dramatically with the advent of the Internet. With major websites such as [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[eBay]], and other big [[book distributor]]s offering [[affiliate programs]], book sales have now, more than ever, been put in the hands of the small business owner.

==Modern era==
[[File:Jakarta Kinokuniya Bookstore.jpg|thumb|A [[Books Kinokuniya]] shop in [[Jakarta]]]]
Bookstores (called ''bookshops'' in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]] and most of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] apart from [[Canada]]) may be either part of a [[List of bookstore chains|chain]], or local [[independent bookstores]]. Stores can range in size offering from several hundred to several hundred thousand titles. They may be [[brick and mortar]] stores or internet only stores or a combination of both. Sizes for the larger bookstores exceed half a million titles. Bookstores often sell other printed matter besides books, such as [[newspapers]], [[magazines]] and [[map]]s; additional product lines may vary enormously, particularly among independent bookstores. [[College]]s and [[University|universities]] often have their own student bookstore on campus that focuses on providing course [[textbook]]s and scholarly books, although some on-campus bookstores are owned by large chains such as [[WHSmith]] or [[Waterstone's]] in the United Kingdom, or [[Barnes &amp; Noble College Booksellers]] in the United States, which is a private firm controlled by the [[Chairman#Corporate governance|chair]] of [[Barnes &amp; Noble]].

Another common type of bookstore is the '''[[used bookstore]]''' or '''second-hand bookshop''' which buys and sells [[used book|used]] and [[out-of-print book]]s in a variety of [[List of used book conditions|conditions]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Richard &amp; Brett, Stanley. ''The London Bookshop''. Pinner, Middlesex: [[Private Libraries Association]], 1977 {{ISBN|0-900002-23-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, David. ''English Country Bookshops''. Pinner, Middlesex: [[Private Libraries Association]], 2010 {{ISBN|978-0-900002-18-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A range of titles are available in used bookstores, including in print and out of print books. [[Book collector]]s tend to frequent used book stores. Large online bookstores offer used books for sale, too. Individuals wishing to sell their used books using online bookstores agree to terms outlined by the bookstore(s): for example, paying the online bookstore(s) a predetermined commission once the books have sold. In [[Paris]], the [[Bouquinistes]] are antiquarian and used booksellers who have had outdoor stalls and boxes along both sides of the [[Seine]] for hundreds of years, regulated by law since the 1850s and contributing to the scenic ambience of the city.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Greek and Roman booksellers===
In the book of [[Jeremiah]] the prophet is represented as dictating to Baruch the scribe, who described the mode in which his book was written. These scribes were the earliest booksellers, and supplied copies as they were demanded. [[Aristotle]] possessed a somewhat extensive library, and [[Plato]] is recorded to have paid the large sum of one hundred [[mina (unit)|minae]] for three small treatises of [[Philolaus]] the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]]. When the [[Alexandrian library]] was founded about 300 BC, various expedients were used for the purpose of procuring books, and this appears to have stimulated the energies of the [[Athens|Athenian]] booksellers. In [[Rome]], toward the end of the republic, it became the fashion to have a library as part of the household furniture. Roman booksellers carried on a flourishing trade. Their shops (''taberna librarii'') were chiefly in the [[Argiletum]], and in the Vicus Sandalarius. On the door, or on the side posts, was a list of the books on sale; and [[Martial]], who mentions this also, says that a copy of his First Book of Epigrams might be purchased for five [[denarii]]. In the time of [[Augustus]] the great booksellers were the Sosii. According to [[Justinian]], a law was passed granting to the scribes the ownership of the material written; this may be the beginnings of the modern law of [[copyright]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Bookselling |volume=4 |pages=233-235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic bookshops===
[[Abbasid Caliphate]] in the east and [[Caliphate of Córdoba]] in the west, encouraged the development of bookshops, copyists, and book dealers across the entire [[Muslim world]], in Islāmic cities such as [[Damascus]], [[Baghdad]], and [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]]. According to ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'':

{{cquote|Scholars and students spent many hours in these bookshop schools reading, examining, and studying available books or purchasing favourite selections for their private libraries. Book dealers traveled to famous bookstores in search of rare manuscripts for purchase and resale to collectors and scholars and thus contributed to the spread of learning. Many such manuscripts found their way to private libraries of famous Muslim scholars such as [[Avicenna]], [[Al-Ghazali|al-Ghazālī]], and [[Al-Farabi|al-Fārābī]], who in turn made their homes centres of scholarly pursuits for their favourite students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|contribution=education|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2008|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/179408/education|accessdate=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There is a popular turn of phrase from the 1960s, "Books are written in [[Cairo]], published in [[Beirut]], and read in [[Baghdad]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plus de kutub, please|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21700672-industry-even-more-troubled-middle-east-elsewhere-plus-de|website=The Economist |accessdate=15 April 2018|ref=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21700672-industry-even-more-troubled-middle-east-elsewhere-plus-de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lyons|first1=Martyn|title=Books: A Living History|date=2011|publisher=J.

===French booksellers===
The first wave of French booksellers came soon after [[Johannes Gutenberg]] introduced his new printing technologies in Europe. The oldest known bookstore still opened in France (and Europe) is the Librairie Nouvelle d'Orléans. Its owner in 1545 was Étienne Rouzeau,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rs9EAAAAcAAJ |title=Recherches sur les imprimeurs &amp; libraires d'Orléans: recueil de documents pour servir à l'histoire de la typographie et de la librairie orlèanaise, depuis de XIVe siècle jusqu'a nos jours|first=Henri|last=Herluison|date=15 March 1868|publisher=H. Herluison|accessdate=15 March 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; it now belongs to publisher [[Albin Michel]]. In 1810 Napoleon created a system by which, a would-be bookseller had to apply for a license (brevet), and supply four references testifying to his morality, and four confirmations of his professional ability to perform the job. All references had to be certified by the local mayor. If the application was accepted, the bookseller would have to swear an oath of loyalty to the régime. The application process was conducted to ensure that the new bookstore was not a place that distributed rebellious publications. The brevet process continued until 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lyons|first=Martyn|title=Books: A Living History|year=2009|publisher=Getty Publications|location=Los Angeles, California|isbn=978-1-60606-083-4|pages=144–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
The spread of [[Christianity]] naturally created a great demand for copies of the [[Gospel]]s, other sacred books, and later on for missals and other devotional volumes for both church and private use. Before the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and the introduction of printing, scribes and stationers who sold books formed guilds. Some of these stationers had stations built against the walls of cathedrals.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Besides the sworn stationers there were many booksellers in [[Oxford]] who were not sworn; for one of the statutes, passed in 1373, expressly states that, in consequence of their presence,

{{cquote|books of great value are sold and carried away from Oxford, the owners of them are cheated, and the sworn stationers are deprived of their lawful business.  It was, therefore, enacted that no bookseller except two sworn stationers or their deputies, should sell any book being either his own property or that of another, exceeding half a mark in value, under a pain of imprisonment, or, if the offence was repeated, of forfeiting his trade within the university.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}}}

===Modern bookselling===

[[File:Gare Metz décor 20.png|thumb|left|In many parts of the world, bookstores—like this one in the [[train station]] in [[Metz]], [[France]]—are often found in transport facilities.]]

The modern system of bookselling dates from soon after the introduction of [[printing]]. Through the new mechanized process for printing, books became more affordable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lyons|first1=Martyn|title=Books: A Living History|date=2011|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|location=Los Angeles|isbn=9781606060834|page=10|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the nineteenth century, the model of bookselling as we know it began to emerge. A professional group of booksellers in [[Leipzig]] decided to create their own association in 1824, and [[Borsenverin des Deustchen Buchhandels]] became the first group to publish outside of the printer's guilds, leading to more people joining the profession without needing to be attached to a guild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lyons|first1=Martyn|title=Books: A Living History|date=2011|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|location=Los Angeles|isbn=9781606060834|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest printers were also [[editing|editors]] and booksellers; but being unable to sell every copy of the works they printed, they had agents at most of the seats of learning, such as [[Anton Koberger]], who introduced the art of printing into [[Nuremberg]] in 1470. The most common types of books printed in large quantities were able to be cheaply produced like [[catechisms]] and [[almanacs]] and often not bound at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lyons|first1=Martyn|title=Books: A Living History|date=2011|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|location=Los Angeles|isbn=9781606060834|page=64|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The religious dissensions of the continent, and the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]] in [[England]] under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], created a great demand for books; but in England neither monarchs of the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] nor [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] dynasties could easily tolerate a [[Freedom of the press|free press]], and various efforts were made to curb it.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The first patent for the office of king's printer was granted to [[Thomas Berthelet]] by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in 1529, but only such books as were first licensed were to be printed. At that time even the purchase or possession of an unlicensed book was a punishable offense. In 1556 the [[Company of Stationers]] was incorporated, and very extensive powers were granted in order that obnoxious books might be repressed. In the following reigns the [[Star Chamber]] exercised a rather effectual censorship; but, in spite of all precaution, such was the demand for books of a [[polemic]]al nature, that many were printed abroad and surreptitiously introduced into England.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In the course of the 16th and 17th centuries the Low Countries for a time became the chief centre of the bookselling world, and many of the finest folios and quartos in our libraries bear the names of Jansen, Blauw or Plantin, with the imprint of [[Amsterdam]], [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], [[Leiden]] or [[Antwerp]], while the Elzevirs besides other works produced their charming little pocket classics. The southern towns of [[Douai]] and [[Saint-Omer]] at the same time furnished polemical works in English.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

[[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] interfered little with books except when they emanated from [[Roman Catholics]], or touched upon her royal prerogatives; and towards the end of her reign, and during that of her successor, [[James I of England|James]], bookselling flourished. So much had bookselling increased during [[the Protectorate]] that, in 1658, was published ''A Catalogue of the most Vendible Books in England'' by [[William London]]. A bad time immediately followed. Although there were provincial booksellers the centre of the trade was [[St. Paul's Churchyard]]. When the [[Great Fire of London]] began in 1666 the booksellers put most of their stock in the vaults of the church, where it was destroyed. The [[English Restoration|Restoration]] also restored the office of Licenser of the Press, which continued until 1694.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In the first copyright statute, the [[Statute of Anne]] (1709), which specially relates to booksellers, it is enacted that, if any person shall think the published price of a book unreasonably high, he may make a complaint to the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], and to certain other persons named, who shall examine his complaint, and if well founded reduce the price; and any bookseller charging more than the price so fixed shall be fined [[english pound|£]]5 for every copy sold. The complaint procedure prescribed in this statute was apparently never used.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Modern book selling has changed dramatically with the advent of the computer. With major websites such as [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[eBay]], and other [[List of book distributors|book distributors]] offering [[affiliate programs]], book sales can be facilitated through an [[affiliate program]].

===Selling and publishing===
[[Image:Borders bookshelf.jpg|thumb|Books on a table in a [[Borders Group|Borders]] store in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], USA. Borders stores started closing in 2010.]]
For later times it is necessary to make a gradual distinction between ''booksellers'', whose trade consists in selling books, either by retail or wholesale, and ''[[publisher]]s'', whose business involves the production of the books from the author's [[manuscript]]s, and who are the intermediaries between author and bookseller, just as the booksellers (in the restricted sense) are intermediaries between the author and publisher and the public. The convenience of this distinction is not impaired by the fact either that a publisher is also a wholesale bookseller, or that a still more recent development in publishing started a reaction to some extent in the way of amalgamating the two functions. The scheme of ''The Times'' Book Club (started in 1905) was, again, a combination of a subscription library with the business of bookselling and it brought the organization of a [[newspaper]], with all its means of achieving publicity, into the work of promoting the sale of  books, in a way which practically introduced a new factor into the bookselling business.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

[[James Lackington]] is credited as the person responsible for changing this profession. His bookshop, known as "The Temple of the Muses," was in Finsbury Square in north London. http://www.templeofthemuses.org/

During the 19th century it remains the fact that the distinction between publisher and  bookseller—literary promoter and shopkeeper—became fundamental. The booksellers, as such, were
engaged either in wholesale bookselling, or in the retail, the old or [[second-hand]] (now includes rare and very old books trade, called '''antiquarian books'''), and the [[periodical]]s publishing or retailing trades.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Coming between the publisher and the retail bookseller is the important distributing agency of the ''wholesale bookseller''. It is to him that the retailer and libraries look for supplies, as it is impossible to stock all of the books published. [[Paternoster Row]], [[London]], was for over a hundred years the centre of this industry, where retail booksellers, busily engaged in obtaining the books ordered by the book-buying public. It is where the publisher calls first on showing or "subscribing" a new book, a critical process, for by the number thus ordered the fate of a book is sometimes determined.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; In the United States, [[Baker &amp; Taylor]] is a major distributor.

What may be termed the third partner in publishing is the ''retail bookseller''; and to protect their interests there was established in 1890 a London booksellers' society, which had for its object the restriction of discounts to 25%, and also to arrange prices generally and control all details connected with the trade.  The society a few years afterwards widened its field of operations so as to include the whole of the [[United Kingdom]], and it became "The Associated Booksellers of Great Britain and Ireland."&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Bookselling in the United States ===

[[File:Tattered-cover-16th-st.jpg|thumb|The [[Tattered Cover]] is a bookstore in Denver, Colorado, and one of the largest [[independent bookstore]]s in the United States.]]
The history of bookselling in the [[United States]] is of special interest.
The [[Spain|Spanish]] settlements drew away from the old country much of its enterprise and best talent, and the presses of [[Mexico]] and other cities teemed with publications mostly of a religious character, but many others, especially linguistic and historical, were also published. Bookselling in the United States was of a somewhat later growth, although printing and bookselling was introduced into [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], as early as 1640 by [[Hezekiah Usher]] and by Usher in 1652 in [[Boston]]. Bookselling was happening in [[Philadelphia]] in 1685, and [[New York City|New York]] in 1693. [[Ben Franklin|Franklin]] had served to make the trade illustrious, yet few persons were engaged in it at the commencement of the 19th century. Books chiefly for scholars and libraries were imported from [[Europe]]; but after the [[War of 1812]] printing-presses multiplied rapidly, and with the spread of newspapers and education there also arose a demand for books, and publishers set to work to secure the advantages offered by the wide field of English literature, the whole of which they had the liberty of reaping free of all cost beyond that of production. The works of [[Walter Scott]], [[Lord Byron]], [[Thomas Moore]], [[Robert Southey]], [[William Wordsworth]], and indeed of every author of note, were reprinted without the smallest payment to author or proprietor. Half the names of the authors in the so-called "American" catalogue of books printed between 1820 and 1852 are British. These titles were made available and affordable to the public. In consequence of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the high price of labour, and the restrictive duties laid on in order to protect native industry, coupled with the frequent dealings with England, a great change took place, and American publishers and booksellers, while there was still no international copyright, made liberal offers for early sheets of new publications. Boston, New York and Philadelphia still retained their old supremacy as bookselling centres. Meanwhile, the distinct publishing business also grew, until gradually the conditions of business became assimilated to those of Europe.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==== African-American Booksellers ====

Bookselling is a profession historically dominated by white Americans, but African Americans developed their own tradition of book selling, particularly in conjunction with radical political movements such as abolitionism, black nationalism, Black Power, and Marxism.  The first documented [[African-American Bookstores|African American bookstore]] was owned and operated by the abolitionist [[David Ruggles]] in the 1830s in New York City. In the years of the civil rights and Black Power era of the 1950s and 1960s, [[Lewis Michaux|Lewis Michaux's]] National Memorial African Bookstore became arguably the most prominent Black-owned bookstore in the United States. In the 1980s and '90s, Clara Villarosa's Hue Man Books became the most prominent Black-owned bookstore in the nation, first in Denver and later in Harlem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaihs.org/black-owned-bookstores-anchors-of-the-black-power-movement/|title=Black-Owned Bookstores: Anchors of the Black Power Movement – AAIHS|last=Davis|first=Joshua Clark|date=|website=www.aaihs.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their work began in public buildings, and then settled in a church in 1987. A few years later, a fire destroyed the church and forced Circle to find its own space. The company was led by Karen Skinner until 1998 when she turned the artistic leadership over to her daughter Alena Murguia, and two company members Tony Vezner and Greg Kolack.  The company left its building in 2012 to produce plays in a series of rented spaces in Chicago.&lt;ref name="PurcellSuspending"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Purcell|first1=Carey|title=Award-Winning Circle Theatre Pulls Productions of Lovesong and Evil Dead: The Musical|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/award-winning-circle-theatre-pulls-productions-of-lovesong-and-evil-dead-the-musical-com-207696|accessdate=2 August 2016|publisher=Playbill|date=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wood carving]] is a common art form in the [[Cook Islands]]. Sculpture in stone is much rarer although there are some excellent [[Petroglyph|carvings]] in [[basalt]] by Mike Taveoni. The proximity of islands in the southern group helped produce a homogeneous style of carving but which had special developments in each island. [[Rarotonga]] is known for its fisherman's gods and staff-gods, Atiu for its wooden seats, [[Mitiaro]], [[Mauke]] and [[Atiu]] for mace and slab gods and [[Mangaia]] for its [[ceremonial]] [[adzes]]. Most of the original wood carvings were either spirited away by early European collectors or were burned in large numbers by missionary zealots.

Today, carving is no longer the major art form with the same spiritual and cultural emphasis given to it by the [[Māori people|Maori]] in New Zealand. However, there are continual efforts to interest young people in their heritage and some good work is being turned out under the guidance of older carvers. Atiu, in particular, has a strong tradition of crafts both in carving and local fibre arts such as [[Tapa cloth|tapa]]. Mangaia is the source of many fine adzes carved in a distinctive, idiosyncratic style with the so-called double-k design. Mangaia also produces food pounders carved from the heavy calcite found in its extensive [[limestone]] caves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ck/culture.htm#visual Lords of the Dance - Culture of the Cook Islands: Visual arts]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carving==
[[File:British Museum - Wooden carving staff god from Rarotonga.jpg|thumb|150px|A staff-god made of [[casuarina]] wood.]]
Carving was an important part of ancient Cook Islands culture, although much of this is lost. Ancient Cook Islanders carved the poles of their huts, their canoes and weapons (clubs and spears). The patterns used were the same as that used in [[tattooing]] and dyed on [[tapa cloth]]. It is believed that families had their own symbols, much like some British families have crests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webcentral.co.ck/arts&amp;crafts.htm Arts &amp; Craft Cook Islands: Build your love of art]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Staff God===
Cult figures called staff-gods or ''atua rakau'' from [[Rarotonga]], apparently combine images of gods with their human descendants. They range in length between 28&amp;nbsp;inches (71&amp;nbsp;cm) and 18&amp;nbsp;feet (5.5&amp;nbsp;m) and were carried and displayed horizontally. At one end there is a schematized blade-shaped head and arms of the progenitive god with a succession of little figures rising from his body, alternatively full-face and in profile with penis erect. The staff itself terminated in a [[phallus]]. But this elaborately carved sexual imagery had less importance for the Rarotongans than the feathers and pieces of shell representing the soul of the god and enclosed in yards of [[Tapa cloth|bark cloth]] wound around the center of the staff.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qGb4pyoseH4C&amp;pg=PT751&amp;lpg=PT751&amp;dq=rarotonga+staff+god&amp;source#v=onepage&amp;q=rarotonga%20staff%20god&amp;f=false A world history of art by Hugh Honour &amp; John Fleming (2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fisherman's god===
A number of images called the fisherman's god are found in museums. These images are likely to be of the sea god ''Tangaroa''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5akbBi6sso8C&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=cook+islands+tangaroa&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Unu8TaroJouisQPf9sDXBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cook%20islands%20tangaroa&amp;f=false Rarotonga &amp; the Cook Islands by Errol Hunt &amp; Nancy Keller, Cook Islands Myths and Legends: Gods]&lt;/ref&gt; Their function rests solely on the authority of [[John Williams (missionary)|John Williams]], who figured one of them and referred to it thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"An idol, of which the figure on the opposite side is a correct representation, was placed on the fore part of every fishing canoe; and when the natives were going on a fishing expedition, prior to setting off, they invariably presented offerings to the god, and invoked him to grant them success."'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-BucArts-t1-body-d1-d16.html Arts and Crafts of the Cook Islands: Religion - nzetc.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Weaving==
[[File:British Museum - Fan with carved wooden figure handle from Rarotonga.jpg|thumb|150px|Weaved [[hand fan]] with a carved figure handle.]]
The outer islands produce traditional weaving of fans, mats, basketware and hats. Particularly fine examples of ''rito'' hats are worn by women to church on Sundays. They are made from the uncurled fibre of the [[coconut palm]] and are of very high quality. The Polynesian equivalent of [[Panama hats]], they are highly valued and are keenly sought by Polynesian visitors from Tahiti. Often, they are decorated with hatbands made of minuscule ''pupu'' shells which are painted and stitched on by hand. Although ''pupu'' are found on other islands, the collection and use of them in decorative work has become a speciality of [[Mangaia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ck/culture.htm#crafts Lords of the Dance - Culture of the Cook Islands: Crafts]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tattoo==
Tattooing was forbidden in the Cook Islands after the arrival of missionaries, but has recently become popular again. Historically the Cook Islands tribes or clans each usually recognized a particular fish, bird, insect or plant that was sacred to that tribe and symbolized its unity. The ritual association requires members of the clan to treat the [[totem]] with respect. Its supernatural help could also be sought in times of distress. The symbol for the [[centipede]] with a poisonous bite is a common totem of [[ariki|chiefs]] and was normally tattooed on the chief's back.

[[Captain James Cook]] recorded ''tatau'' as the Tahitian term when he arrived there in 1769, although tatau is not the only word for this art form. In some French Polynesian islands and some Cook Islands it was known as ''nana'o''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.janeresture.com/oceania_tattoos/cooks.htm Oceania tattoos: Cook Islands tattoos - janeresture.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tivaevae==
[[File:Woman sewing a tivaevae, Rarotonga.jpg|thumb|Woman sewing a ''tīvaevae'', [[Rarotonga]].]]
A major art form peculiar to the Cook Islands is ''tīvaevae''. This is needlework, specifically the making of [[patchwork]] [[quilts]] by hand. The designs are stunning. These beautiful and intricate works are made by women. They have great intrinsic value and become family [[heirloom]]s.

They are often given as gifts of love and friendship. They supplanted the traditional giving of [[tapa cloth]] on ceremonial occasions such as weddings, funerals and [[First haircut#Polynesian boys|hair-cutting]]. Tivaevae is a communal activity and several women will work on them together. The original idea was introduced by the wives of [[missionaries]] from England and nuns from Tahiti who taught [[embroidery]], [[needlework]], [[sewing]] and [[crochet]].

Tivaevae has played an important role in the daily life of Cook Island women. Since it is largely a social activity, it is nearly always carried out communally, it has had a major impact on the lives of the many women who practise it. Despite its European origin, patterns and techniques have evolved into styles which now belong quite distinctly to the Cooks. The tivaevae reflect the women's surroundings and usually employ designs of flowers, leaves, birds, fish, insects and animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ck/tivaevae.htm Quilts of the Cook Islands: Tivaevae]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary art==
Contemporary Artists Eruera Nia and Tim Buchanan are featured at the new International Terminal, [[Rarotonga Airport]]. 36 of Nia's concrete casts are positioned throughout the terminal while Buchanan's 10 metre mural farewell's passengers as they are processed through customs and security. In late 2010, two of Nia's sculptures were acquired for the permanent collection of the [[National Gallery of Australia]]. Buchanan will exhibit with BCA Gallery, Rarotonga in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallerybca.com/home/70-arrivals-and-departures-cook-islands-contemporary-art-rarotonga-international-airport.html BCA Gallery - Cook Islands Contemporary Art @ Rarotonga International Airport]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1715">'''Crunchiness''' is the sensation of muffled grinding of a foodstuff.  Crunchiness differs from [[crispness]] in that a crisp item is quickly atomized, while a crunchy one offers sustained, [[granular]] resistance to [[jaw]] action.  While crispness is difficult to maintain, crunchiness is difficult to overcome.

Crunchy foods are associated with freshness.&lt;ref name=Roach /&gt;

==Relationship to sound==
Crispness and crunchiness can each be "assessed on the basis of [[sound]] alone, on the basis of oral-tactile clues alone, or on the basis of a combination of auditory and oral-tactile information".&lt;ref name=crunch&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BTR7VEJPDWAC&amp;pg=PA384&amp;lpg=PA384&amp;dq=crunchiness&amp;source=web&amp;ots=iUlXba5eN4&amp;sig=r17PZ2f_wWPXBu_L2yigLsr9Z-M|title=Sensory Evaluation of Food: Principles and Practices}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An acoustic [[frequency]] of 1.9&amp;nbsp;kHz seems to mark the threshold between the two sensations, with crunchiness at frequencies below, and crispness at frequencies above.

Crunchy food breaks at speeds faster than the [[speed of sound]].  The sound of crunching food is therefore "a tiny [[sonic boom]]".&lt;ref name=Roach&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/26/health/mary-roach-on-studying-food-and-how-humans-eat-it.html|title=Mary Roach on Studying How Humans Chew and Eat |last=Roach |first=Mary |date=26 March 2013 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diane English''' (born May 18, 1948) is an American screenwriter, producer and director, best known for creating the television show ''[[Murphy Brown]]'' and writing and directing the 2008 feature film ''[[The Women (2008 film)|The Women]]''.

==Early life==
English was born in [[Buffalo, New York]], the daughter of Anne English and Richard English who was an electrical engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/66/Diane-English.html |title=Diane English Biography (1948-) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date=1992-11-23 |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated from [[Nardin Academy]] in Buffalo, and then from [[Buffalo State College]] in 1970.

==Career==
English began her career at [[WNET]], the PBS affiliate in New York City, working first as a story editor for ''The Theatre in America'' series, and then as associate director of ''[[TV Lab at Thirteen/WNET|TV Lab]]''. From 1977 to 1980, she wrote a monthly column on television for ''Vogue'' magazine.

In 1980, she co-wrote PBS' ''[[The Lathe of Heaven (film)|The Lathe of Heaven]]'', an adaptation of [[Ursula K. LeGuin]]'s classic [[The Lathe of Heaven|science fiction novel]] of the same name, and received her first Writers Guild Award Nomination. She followed that with the television movies ''Her Life as a Man'' (1984) and ''Classified Love'' (1986).

In 1985, English created ''[[Foley Square (TV series)]]'', her first half-hour comedy series, which aired on CBS during the 1985-1986 television season. It starred [[Margaret Colin]], [[Hector Elizondo]] , [[Michael Lembeck]], and [[Jon Lovitz]]. The show premiered on December 11, 1985, and languished near the bottom of the Nielsen ratings in the weeks that followed. After being put on hiatus after only 11 episodes, CBS rescheduled it to another night and aired the three remaining episodes of the season. With ratings low, CBS cancelled the show after only 14 episodes with the last episode airing on April 8, 1986. During 1986 and 1987, English executive produced and wrote the CBS comedy series ''[[My Sister Sam]]'', starring [[Pam Dawber]] which lasted for two seasons with 12 episodes that never aired before being cancelled.

In 1988, she created the CBS television series ''[[Murphy Brown]]'', for which she won three [[Emmy Award]]s (one for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series and two for Outstanding Comedy Series). The series ran from 1988 to 1998 for a total of 247 episodes. It garnered 18 Emmy wins from 62 nominations. In 1992, English stirred up controversy when the title character decided to have a child out of wedlock. Vice president [[Dan Quayle]] gave a speech entitled "Reflections on Urban America to the Commonwealth Club of California" on the subject of the Los Angeles riots. In this speech, Quayle blamed the violence on a decay of moral values and family structure in American society. In an aside, he cited the title character in the television program Murphy Brown as an example of how popular culture contributes to this "poverty of values", saying, "It doesn't help matters when prime time TV has Murphy Brown – a character who supposedly epitomizes today's intelligent, highly paid, professional woman – mocking the importance of fathers, by bearing a child alone, and calling it just another 'lifestyle choice'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,975627,00.html | title=Dan Quayle vs. Murphy Brown | work=Time  | date=June 1, 1992 | accessdate=June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English responded with a statement that read: "If the vice president thinks it's disgraceful for an unmarried woman to bear children (out of wedlock), and if he believes that a woman cannot adequately raise a child without a father, then he'd better make sure abortion remains safe and legal." In 2002, Candice Bergen, the actress who played Brown, said "I never have really said much about the whole episode, which was endless, but his speech was a perfectly intelligent speech about fathers not being dispensable and nobody agreed with that more than I did." This controversy along with the shifting times of that decade touched off a debate over the meaning of "family values" of Americans during that election year in which [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Al Gore]] ran against [[George H.W. Bush]] and Dan Quayle.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

English also created the comedy series ''[[Love &amp; War (TV series)|Love &amp; War]]'' (1992–1995), starring [[Susan Dey]] and [[Jay Thomas]] - [[Annie Potts]] replaced Dey after the first season. Other series she co-created and/or executive produced include '' [[Double Rush]]'' (1995), ''[[Ink (TV series)|Ink]]'' (1996), and ''[[The Louie Show]]'', starring [[Louie Anderson]] (1996), and ''[[Living in Captivity]]'' (1998). Unfortunately, none of the series were picked up for more than a single season with ''The Louie Show'' lasting six episodes.

In 2008, English wrote, produced and directed ''[[The Women (2008 film)|The Women]]'', her feature film debut. The comedy, a remake of the 1939 [[George Cukor]] film of the same name, stars [[Meg Ryan]], [[Annette Bening]], [[Eva Mendes]], [[Debra Messing]], and [[Jada Pinkett Smith]]. It was released to mostly negative reviews but tripled its budget when worldwide markets were factored in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Fleming |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117972296.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1&amp;query=diane+english |title=Femmes front 'Women' - Entertainment News, Film News, Media |publisher=Variety |date=2007-09-19 |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
That same year English and the ensemble cast of ''[[The Women (2008 film)|The Women]]'' were honored with the [[Women in Film Los Angeles|Women in Film]] [[Women in Film Crystal + Lucy Awards#THE CRYSTAL AWARD|Crystal]] award&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/leading-ladies-set-crystallucy-awards-109568 |title=Leading ladies set for Crystal+Lucy Awards|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter |date=2008-04-17 |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; which honors women in communications and media.

'''Elsa Schiaparelli''' ({{IPAc-en|s|k|æ|p|ə|ˈ|r|ɛ|l|i}} {{respell|skap|ə|REL|ee}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bradley |first1=Laura |last2=Watt |first2=Judith |title=Pronunciation Guide:ElsaSchiaparelli|url=http://www.anothermag.com/fashion-beauty/1313/elsa-schiaparelli |website=AnOther |accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-it|ɛlsa skjapaˈrɛlli|lang}}; 1890–1973)&lt;!--full dates in infobox, per MOS--&gt; was an Italian [[fashion designer]]. Along with [[Coco Chanel]], her greatest rival, she is regarded as one of the most prominent figures in fashion between the two World Wars.&lt;ref name="philexmicrosite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philamuseum.org/micro_sites/exhibitions/schiaparelli/tour/index.htm | title=Shocking! The Art and Fashion of Elsa Schiaparelli | publisher=[[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] | year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with knitwear, Schiaparelli's designs were heavily influenced by [[Surrealists]] like her collaborators [[Salvador Dalí]] and [[Jean Cocteau]]. Her clients included the heiress [[Daisy Fellowes]] and actress [[Mae West]]. Schiaparelli did not adapt to the changes in fashion following [[World War II]] and her couture house closed in 1954.

==Early life==
Elsa Luisa Maria Schiaparelli was born at the [[Palazzo Corsini, Rome]].&lt;ref name="philex"&gt;Philadelphia Museum of Art: [http://www.philamuseum.org/micro_sites/exhibitions/schiaparelli/kids/schiap-pack.pdf ''Shocking!'': Teacher's pack] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529134356/http://www.philamuseum.org/micro_sites/exhibitions/schiaparelli/kids/schiap-pack.pdf |date=2008-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother, Maria-Luisa, was a Neapolitan aristocrat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n04/rosemary-hill/hard-edged-chic | title=Hard-Edged Chic | first=Rosemary | last=Hill | work= | publisher=London Review of Books | date=2004-02-19 | volume=26 | issue=4 | pages=15–16 | issn=0260-9592 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411080719/http://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n04/rosemary-hill/hard-edged-chic | archivedate=2012-04-11 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, Celestino Schiaparelli, was an accomplished scholar with multiple areas of interest. His studies focused on the [[Islamic]] world and the era of the [[Middle Ages]] and he was, in addition, an authority on [[Sanskrit]] and a curator of [[medieval]] manuscripts. He also served as Dean of the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]], where Schiaparelli would herself later go on to study philosophy.&lt;ref name=secrest45&gt;Secrest, p. 4, 5,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt;&lt;ref name="philex" /&gt; His brother, astronomer [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]], had discovered the so-called ''canali'', or [[Martian canal]]s, and the young Schiaparelli often studied the heavens with her uncle.&lt;ref name="philex" /&gt;&lt;ref name=secrest45/&gt; A cousin of the brothers, [[Ernesto Schiaparelli]], was a noted [[Egyptologist]] who discovered the tomb of [[Nefertari]] and was Director of the [[Museo Egizio]] in [[Turin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gnoli |first1=Sofia |title=Un secolo di moda italiana, 1900-2000 |publisher=Meltemi Editore srl |isbn=9788883534287 |page=67 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Ck_IHlPHZQC&amp;pg=PA67|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural background and erudition of her family members served to ignite the imaginative faculties of Schiaparelli’s impressionable childhood years. She became enraptured with the lore of ancient cultures and religious rites. These sources inspired her to pen a volume of poems titled ''Arethusa'' based on the [[ancient Greek]] myth of the hunt. The content of her writing so alarmed the conservative sensibilities of her parents they sought to tame her fantasy life by sending her to a convent boarding school in [[Switzerland]]. Once within the school’s confines, Schiaparelli rebelled against its strict authority by going on a hunger strike, leaving her parents to see no alternative but to bring her home again.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, 14, 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Schiaparelli was dissatisfied by a lifestyle that whilst refined and comfortable, she considered cloistered and unfulfilling. Her craving for adventure and exploration of the wider world led to her taking measures to remedy this, and when a friend offered her a post caring for orphaned children in an English country house, she saw an opportunity to leave. The placement however, proved uncongenial to Schiaparelli, who subsequently planned a return to the stop-over city of Paris rather than admit defeat by returning to Rome and her family.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, p. 19, 20&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marriage ===
Schiaparelli fled to London to avoid the certainty of marriage to a persistent suitor, a wealthy Russian whom her parents favored and for whom she herself felt no attraction. In London, Schiaparelli who had held a fascination for psychic phenomena since childhood, attended a lecture on [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]]. The lecturer that night was Willem de Wendt, a man of various aliases who was also known as Willie Wendt and Wilhem de Kerlor. He was reported to have legally changed his name in England to Wilhelm Frederick Wendt de Kerlor, a combination of his father's last name and mother's maiden name.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; de Wendt's profession was one of a tireless, inventive self-promoter, in reality a con man who claimed to have psychic powers, and numerous academic credentials. He alternatively and simultaneously passed himself off as detective and criminal psychologist, doctor, and lecturer. In a stint on the [[vaudeville]] stage de Kerlor billed himself as "The World Famous Dr. W. de Kerlor."&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, p. 34, 37, 39, 42, 44&lt;/ref&gt; Schiaparelli was immediately attracted to this charismatic charlatan and they became engaged on the very next day of their first meeting. They married shortly thereafter in London on July 21, 1914, Schiaparelli was twenty-three, her new husband thirty.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; de Kerlor attempted to earn a living aggrandizing his reputation as a psychic practitioner as the couple subsisted primarily on the wedding dowry and an allowance provided by Schiaparelli’s wealthy parents.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, p. 28-30&lt;/ref&gt; Schiaparelli played the role of her husband's helpmate and helped facilitate the promotion of his fraudulent schemes. In 1915 the couple were forced to leave England after de Kerlor was deported following his conviction for practicing [[fortune-telling]], then illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, p. 26-27, 44&lt;/ref&gt; They subsequently lived a peripatetic existence in [[Paris]], [[Cannes]], [[Nice]], and [[Monte Carlo]], before leaving for America in the spring of 1916.

The de Kerlors disembarked in New York, initially staying at the Brevoort, a prominent hotel in [[Greenwich Village]], then relocated to an apartment above the [[Café des Artistes]] near Central Park West. De Kerlor rented offices to house his newly inaugurated "Bureau of Psychology" where he hoped to achieve fame and fortune through his paranormal and consulting work. His wife acted as his assistant, providing clerical support for self-promotions crafted to provide the newspapers with sensational copy, win celebrity and garner acclaim. During this period de Kerlor came under the surveillance of the Federal government’s [[Bureau of Investigation]], (BOI) a precursor of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], (FBI), not only for his dubious professional practices but also on suspicion of harboring anti-British and pro-German allegiance during wartime. By 1917, de Kerlor’s acquaintance with journalists [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]] and [[Louise Bryant]] had positioned him on the government radar as a possible [[Bolshevik]] sympathizer and [[Communist]] revolutionary. Attempting to avoid this unremitting scrutiny, the de Kerlors decamped to Boston in 1918, where they continued their activities as they had done in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, p. 17, 30, 36&lt;/ref&gt; De Kerlor, an incurable publicity hound, made imprudent admissions to a BOI investigator in prideful support of the [[Russian Revolution]] and went so far as to admit to an association with a notorious [[anarchist]], whilst his wife incriminated herself by revealing that she was tutoring Italians in Boston’s North End on the tenets of Bolshevism and that she herself had the knowledge to assemble explosive devices. Both were ultimately spared prosecution or deportation, the authorities concluding that such admissions so freely given were more indicative of foolish grandstanding than evidence of individuals who were a threat to society.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost immediately after their child, Maria Luisa Yvonne Radha (nicknamed 'Gogo'), was born on June 15, 1920, de Kerlor moved out leaving Schiaparelli alone with their newborn daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, p. 53,&lt;/ref&gt;  In later years, whenever Gogo asked her mother about her absent father, she was told that he was dead.&lt;ref name=seacrest84&gt;Secrest, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Schiaparelli apparently made no efforts to bring her husband back or to seek support payments for herself and Gogo.&lt;ref name=seacrest84/&gt; In 1921, the 18-month-old Gogo was diagnosed with [[polio]], which proved a stressful and protracted challenge for both mother and child. Years later Gogo recalled spending her early years in plaster casts and on crutches, with a largely absent mother who she barely saw. Fearing that de Kerlor would attempt to gain legal custody of Gogo, Schiaparelli had the child's surname legally changed to Schiaparelli prior to their return to France in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, p 66, 57&lt;/ref&gt;

Schiaparelli relied greatly on the emotional support offered her by her close friend Gabrielle 'Gaby' Buffet-Picabia, the wife of [[Dada]]/[[Surrealist]] artist [[Francis Picabia]], who she had first met on board ship during the transatlantic crossing to America in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Following de Kerlor's desertion, Schiaparelli returned to New York, attracted to its spirit of fresh beginnings and cultural vibrancy. Her interest in spiritualism translated into a natural affinity for the art of the Dada and Surrealist movements, and her friendship with Gaby Picabia facilitated entry into this creative circle which comprised noteworthy members such as [[Man Ray]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Alfred Stieglitz]] and [[Edward Steichen]].&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, p. 63, 67&lt;/ref&gt; Although technically still married, Schiaparelli took a lover, the opera singer [[Mario Laurenti]], but this relationship was cut short after Laurenti's death in 1922 after a sudden illness.&lt;ref name=secrest28305361a&gt;Secrest, p. 28-30, 53, 61a&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst they were together, de Kerlor had purportedly conducted affairs with the dancer [[Isadora Duncan]] and the actress [[Alla Nazimova]].&lt;ref name=secrest28305361a/&gt;

Schiaparelli and de Kerlor were eventually divorced in March 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, p. 33, 55, 74&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, de Kerlor was murdered in Mexico under circumstances never fully revealed.&lt;ref name=seacrest84/&gt;

== Return to Paris ==
Following the lead of Gabrielle Picabia and others, and after the death of her lover Laurenti, Schiaparelli left New York for France in 1922.  Upon her arrival in Paris, she took an expansive apartment in a fashionable quarter of the city taking on the requisite servants, cook and maid. The self-made associations she formed over the years along with the eminent social position held by her Italian family combined to ensure that she would be embraced by desirable social circles on her return to France.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

Although never threatened with destitution as she continued to receive financial support from her mother, Schiaparelli nevertheless felt the need to earn an independent income. She assisted Man Ray with his Dada magazine ''Société Anonyme'', which proved short lived. Gaby Picabia then suggested a business enterprise which would be beneficial to herself and Schiaparelli. Connected to the French couturier [[Paul Poiret]] through her association with his sister Nicole Groult, Picabia proposed that they sell French couture in America. This proposed project, however, never became a viable enterprise and was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, p. 63, 65&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fashion career ==

Schiaparelli’s design career was early on influenced by couturier [[Paul Poiret]], who was renowned for jettisoning corseted, over-long dresses and promoting styles that enabled freedom of movement for the modern, elegant and sophisticated woman. In later life, Schiaparelli referred to Poiret as "a generous mentor, dear friend."&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, p.138&lt;/ref&gt;

Schiaparelli had no training in the technical skills of pattern making and clothing construction. Her method of approach relied on both impulse of the moment and the serendipitous inspiration as the work progressed. She draped fabric directly on the body, sometimes using herself as the model. This technique followed the lead of Poiret who too had created garments by manipulating and draping. The results appeared uncontrived and wearable.

===House of Schiaparelli ===
Whilst in Paris, Schiaparelli - "Schiap" to her friends - began making her own clothes. With encouragement from Poiret, she started her own business but it closed in 1926 despite favourable reviews.&lt;ref name="philex" /&gt; She launched a new collection of knitwear in early 1927 using a special double layered stitch created by Armenian refugees and featuring sweaters with [[Surrealism|surrealist]] [[trompe l'oeil]] images.&lt;ref name="philex" /&gt; Although her first designs appeared in ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', the business really took off with a pattern that gave the impression of a scarf wrapped around the wearer's neck.&lt;ref name="philex" /&gt; The "pour le Sport" collection expanded the following year to include bathing suits, ski-wear, and linen dresses. Schiaparelli added evening wear to her collections in 1931, using the luxury silks of [[Robert Perrier]], and the business went from strength to strength, culminating in a move from [[Rue de la Paix, Paris|Rue de la Paix]] to acquiring the renowned salon of [[Louise Chéruit]] at 21 [[Place Vendôme]], which was rechristened the ''Schiap Shop''.&lt;ref name="philex" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maison Robert Perrier (Fédération Nationale du Tissu). 2000. Exhibit. Mairie du 4e arrondissement de Paris, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colin McDowell]] noted that by 1939, Schiaparelli was well-known enough in intellectual circles to be mentioned as the epitome of modernity by the Irish poet [[Louis MacNeice]]. Although McDowell cites MacNeice's reference as from ''Bagpipe Music'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McDowell|first1=Colin|title=McDowell's directory of twentieth century fashion|date=1988|publisher=Prentice Hall Press|location=New York|isbn=9780135669280|edition=Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McDowell|first1=Colin|title=The Fashion Website: Schiaparelli|url=http://www.colinmcdowell.com/directory/thedirectory/elsa/schaparelli.html|website=Colin McDowell: The Fashion Website|accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is actually from stanza XV of ''[[Autumn Journal]]''.&lt;ref name=macneice&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacNeice|first1=Louis|editor1-last=Skelton|editor1-first=Robin|title=Poetry of the Thirties|date=2000|publisher=Penguin UK|isbn=0141921455|page=266|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m2m_tGGUi5IC&amp;pg=PT266|chapter=Autumn Journal XV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A darker tone was set when France declared war on Germany in 1939. Schiaparelli's Spring 1940 collection featured "trench" brown and camouflage print taffetas.&lt;ref name="philex" /&gt; Soon after the [[Battle of France|fall of Paris]] on 14 June 1940, Schiaparelli sailed to New York for a lecture tour; apart from a few months in Paris in early 1941, she remained in [[New York City]] until the end of the war.&lt;ref name="philex" /&gt; On her return she found that fashions had changed, with [[Christian Dior]]'s "[[Christian Dior S.A.#The "New Look"|New Look]]" marking a rejection of pre-war fashion. The house of Schiaparelli struggled in the austerity of the post-war period, and Elsa finally closed the couture house down in December 1954,&lt;ref name="philex" /&gt; the same year that her great rival Chanel returned to the business.

==Later life and death==
Aged 64, Schiaparelli wrote her autobiography and then lived out a comfortable retirement between her Paris apartment and house in Tunisia. She died on 13 November 1973.

==Notable designs==
Schiaparelli was one of the first designers to develop the [[wrap dress]], taking inspiration from aprons to produce a design that would accommodate and flatter all female body types. Her design, which first appeared in 1930, offered a two-sided model with armholes on each side, brought together in the front of the garment and wrapped and tied at the waistline. Buttons may also have been incorporated into this early version. Initially conceived as beachwear and produced in four colours of [[Tussar silk|tussore silk]], the dress was popular with buyers and copied by garment manufacturers as a design for everyday street wear. Some forty years afterwards, this uncomplicated and easy-to-wear design was revisited in the 1970s by the American designer [[Diane von Fürstenberg]].&lt;ref name=secrest93&gt;Secrest, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web | last=Woods | first=Vicki | author-link= | publication-date=2003-10-24 | year=2003 | title=Chic value | publication-place=London | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2003/10/24/baschiap20.xml | work=The Daily Telegraph | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518043537/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=%2Farts%2F2003%2F10%2F24%2Fbaschiap20.xml | archivedate=2008-05-18 | deadurl=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, Schiaparelli's divided skirt - a forerunner of shorts, shocked the tennis world when worn by [[Lili de Alvarez]] at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] in 1931.&lt;ref name="philex" /&gt;

Other innovations included a swimsuit design which incorporated an interior [[bra]] with an alluring low-cut back by using hidden straps that crossed in the back and closed around the waist. This design was patented in 1930 and retailed by Best &amp; Company.&lt;ref name=secrest93/&gt; Other designs were made with detachable elements and reversible sections. Also in 1930, she is credited with having produced the first evening dress with a matching jacket.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; During [[Prohibition in the United States]], Schiaparelli's popularly named "[[speakeasy]] dress" provided a hidden pocket for a flask for alcoholic beverage.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, p. 118-119, 174&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fastenings===
[[File:Elsa Schiaparelli, tailleur 1938-39 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|1938-39 Schiaparelli suit with large buttons sculpted by [[Alberto Giacometti]].]]
Schiaparelli is one of the designers credited with offering the first clothes with visible [[zipper]]s in 1930.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; Rather than being concealed, [[zipper]]s became a key element of Schiaparelli's designs, visibly fastening necklines and running down sleeves and skirts.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, p. 153, 154&lt;/ref&gt; She used chunky plastic zippers made from [[cellulose nitrate]], the first semi-synthetic plastic fabric, and [[cellulose acetate]].&lt;ref name=haldane&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haldane |first1=Elizabeth-Anne |title=Surreal semi-synthetics |journal=Conservation Journal (V&amp;A) |date=Spring 2007 |issue=55 |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-55/surreal-semi-synthetics/|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Charles James (designer)|Charles James]], Schiaparelli had arrangements with the manufacturers to promote their zip fasteners, using specific brands depending on where the garment would be sold (such as Éclair for Paris models, Lightning Fastener Co. for London models, and Hookless Fastener Co. zips for American export models).&lt;ref name=haldane/&gt;

Schiaparelli was also renowned for her unusual buttons, which could resemble candlesticks, playing card emblems, ships, crowns, mirrors and [[cricket (insect)|crickets]];&lt;ref name=buttons&gt;{{cite web | title=Buttons. Jean Clément or Roger Jean-Pierre for Elsa Schiaparelli | url=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/80094073 | publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921115835/http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/80094073 | archivedate=2013-09-21 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; or silver [[tambourine]]s and silk-covered carrots and cauliflowers.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; Many of these fastenings were designed by [[Jean Clemént]] and [[Roger Jean-Pierre]] who also created jewellery for her.&lt;ref name=buttons/&gt; In 1936 Schiaparelli was one of the first people to recognise the potential of [[Jean Schlumberger (jewelry designer)|Jean Schlumberger]] who she originally employed as a designer of buttons.&lt;ref name=scarisbrick&gt;Scarisbrick, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewellery===

Schiaparelli's output also included distinctive costume jewellery in a wide range of novelty designs. One of her most directly Surrealist designs was a 1938 Rhodoid (a newly developed clear plastic) necklace studded with coloured metallic insects by Clément giving the illusion that the bugs were crawling directly on the wearer's skin.&lt;ref name="bugs-80093782"&gt;{{cite web | title=Necklace.

===Textiles===

Schiaparelli was noted for her use of innovative textiles which were woven to resemble textures such as tree bark or crepe paper; a [[plush]] made to mimic ermine; and novelty prints including a fabric patterned with newspaper clippings. She made garments from crumpled rayon 50 years before [[Issey Miyake]] produced similarly pleated and crinkled pieces.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; Schiaparelli enjoyed playing with juxtapositions of colours, shapes and textures,&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; and embraced the new technologies and materials of the time. With Charles Colcombet she experimented with acrylic, cellophane, a rayon jersey called "Jersela" and a rayon with metal threads called "Fildifer" - the first time synthetic materials had been used in couture.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; Some of these innovations were not pursued further, like her 1934 "glass" cape made from Rhodophane, a transparent plastic related to cellophane.&lt;ref&gt;Handley, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; Making clothes from these new and untested fabrics posed unexpected hazards - [[Diana Vreeland]] had a Schiaparelli dress melt at the dry cleaners' after its synthetic fabric reverted to chemical sludge upon contact with the cleaning fluids.&lt;ref&gt;Handley, p.27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artist collaborations===

Schiaparelli's fanciful imaginative powers coupled with involvement in the [[Dada]]/[[Surrealist]] art movements directed her into new creative territory.  Her instinctive sensibilities soon came to distinguish her creations from her chief rival [[Coco Chanel]], who referred to her as 'that Italian artist who makes clothes'.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;&lt;ref name="chicthrills"&gt;{{cite book | last=Steele | first=Valerie | author-link=Valerie Steele | contribution=Chanel in Context | editor1-last=Ash | editor1-first=Juliet | editor2-last=Wilson | editor2-first=Elizabeth | title=Chic Thrills: A Fashion Reader | pages=124 | publisher=Pandora Press (Harper Collins) | place=London | year=1992 | isbn=0-04-440824-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schiaparelli collaborated with a number of contemporary artists, most famously with [[Salvador Dalí]], to develop a number of her most notable designs. Schiaparelli also had a good relationship with other artists including [[Leonor Fini]],&lt;ref name="fini" /&gt; [[Méret Oppenheim]], and [[Alberto Giacometti]].&lt;ref name=steele&gt;Steele, p.146&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937 Schiaparelli collaborated with the artist [[Jean Cocteau]] to produce two of her most notable art-themed designs for that year's Autumn collection.&lt;ref name="coccoat"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/objectid/O117953 | title=Coat designed by Elsa Schiaparelli and Jean Cocteau | first= | last= | work=Collections database | publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]] | date= | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318011142/http://collections.vam.ac.uk/objectid/O117953 | archivedate=2009-03-18 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; An evening jacket was embroidered with a female figure with one hand caressing the waist of the wearer, and long blonde hair cascading down one sleeve.&lt;ref name="cocjacket"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/65317.html?mulR=23480 | title=Dinner jacket designed by Elsa Schiaparelli and Jean Cocteau | first= | last= | work=Collections database | publisher=[[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] | date= | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222000458/http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/65317.html?mulR=23480 | archivedate=2012-02-22 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; A long evening coat featured two profiles facing each other, creating the [[optical illusion]] of a vase of roses.&lt;ref name="coccoat" /&gt; The embroidering of both garments was executed by the couture embroiderers [[Maison Lesage|Lesage]].&lt;ref name="coccoat" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cocjacket" /&gt;

====Dalí====
The designs Schiaparelli produced in collaboration with Dalí are among her best known. In addition to well-documented collaborations such as the shoe hat and the Lobster, Tears and Skeleton dresses, Dalí's influence has been identified in designs such as the lamb-cutlet hat and a 1936-day suit with pockets simulating a chest of drawers.&lt;ref name=martin2&gt;Martin, pp.118-120&lt;/ref&gt;  While Schiaparelli did not formally name her designs, the four main garments from her partnership with Dalí are popularly known as follows:

;Lobster Dress
The 1937 Lobster Dress was a simple white silk evening dress with a crimson waistband featuring a large lobster painted (by Dalí) onto the skirt. From 1934, Dalí had started incorporating lobsters into his work, including ''New York Dream-Man Finds Lobster in Place of Phone'' shown in the magazine [[American Weekly]] in 1935, and the mixed-media [[Lobster Telephone]] (1936). His design for Schiaparelli was interpreted into a fabric print by the leading silk designer Sache. It was famously worn by [[Wallis Simpson]] in a series of photographs by [[Cecil Beaton]] taken at the [[Château de Candé]] shortly before her marriage to [[Edward VIII]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/65327.html?mulR=21188 | title=The Lobster Dress | first= | last= | work=Collections database | publisher=[[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] | date= | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222000513/http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/65327.html?mulR=21188 | archivedate=2012-02-22 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Tears Dress 
The Tears Dress, a slender pale blue evening gown printed with a Dalí design of [[trompe l'oeil]] rips and tears, worn with a thigh-length veil with "real" tears carefully cut out and lined in pink and magenta, was part of the February 1938 ''Circus Collection''.&lt;ref name="tears" /&gt; The print was intended to give the illusion of torn animal flesh, the tears printed to represent fur on the reverse of the fabric and suggest that the dress was made of animal pelts turned inside out.&lt;ref name="tearsp" /&gt; Figures in ripped, skin-tight clothing suggesting [[flayed]] flesh appeared in three of Dalí's 1936 paintings, one of which, ''Necrophiliac Springtime'', was owned by Schiaparelli; the other two are ''The Dream Places A Hand on a Man's Shoulder'' and ''Three Young Surrealist Women Holding in Their Arms the Skins of an Orchestra''.&lt;ref name="tears"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/objectid/O84418 | title=The Tears Dress | first= | last= | work=Collections database | publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]] | date= | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318011156/http://collections.vam.ac.uk/objectid/O84418 | archivedate=2009-03-18 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tearsp"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/65326.html?mulR=4749 | title=The Tears Dress | first= | last= | work=Collections database | publisher=[[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] | date= | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613162426/http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/65326.html?mulR=4749 | archivedate=2011-06-13 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Martin (curator)|Richard Martin]] saw the Tears Dress as a ''[[memento mori]]'' produced in response to the [[Spanish Civil War]] and the spread of [[Fascism]], declaring that to "tear the dress is to deny its customary decorum and utility, and to question the matter of concealment and revelation in the garment."&lt;ref name=martin136&gt;Martin, p.136-137&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that even if the tears in the dress were mere ornament like [[1400–1500 in European fashion#Slashing|slashing]], the real tears on the veil negated this, offering visual disagreements between reality and pretence.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, p.114&lt;/ref&gt;

;Skeleton Dress 
Dalí also helped Schiaparelli design the Skeleton Dress for the ''Circus Collection''.&lt;ref name="tears" /&gt; It was a stark black crepe dress which used [[trapunto quilting]] to create padded [[ribs]], [[Vertebral column|spine]], and [[Femur|leg bones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/objectid/O65687 | title=The Skeleton Dress | first= | last= | work=Collections database | publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]] | date= | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318011146/http://collections.vam.ac.uk/objectid/O65687 | archivedate=2009-03-18 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Shoe Hat 
In 1933, Dalí was photographed by his wife [[Gala Dalí]] with one of her slippers balanced on his head.&lt;ref name="vamshoehat" /&gt;&lt;ref name=martin1&gt;Martin, pp.110-111.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937 he sketched designs for a shoe hat for Schiaparelli, which she featured in her Fall-Winter 1937-38 collection.&lt;ref name=martin1/&gt; The hat, shaped like a woman's high heeled shoe, had the heel standing straight up and the toe tilted over the wearer's forehead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Elsa Schiaparelli: Hat (1974.139) | work=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History | location=New York |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art (2000–.) | url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1974.139 | date=April 2011 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208043116/http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1974.139 | archivedate=2011-12-08 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; This hat was worn by Gala Dalí,&lt;ref name="vamshoehat"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O183849/hat-shoe-hat/ | title=Shoe Hat worn by Gala Dalí | first= | last= | work=Collections database | publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]] | date= | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309102438/http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O183849/hat-shoe-hat/ | archivedate=2012-03-09 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schiaparelli herself, and by the Franco-American editor of the French [[Harper's Bazaar]], heiress [[Daisy Fellowes]], who was one of Schiaparelli's best clients.

===Film costumes===

Schiaparelli designed the wardrobe for several films, starting with the French version of 1933's ''[[Topaze (1933 French film)|Topaze]]'', and ending with [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]]'s outfits for the 1952 biopic of [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], ''[[Moulin Rouge (1952 film)|Moulin Rouge]]'' in which Gabor played [[Jane Avril]]. ''Moulin Rouge'' won [[Marcel Vertès]] an [[Academy Award for Costume Design]], although Schiaparelli's role in costuming the leading lady went unacknowledged beyond a prominent on-screen credit for Gabor's costumes. Authentically, Gabor's costumes were directly based upon Toulouse-Lautrec's portraits of Avril.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O15576/evening-dress-elsa-schiaparelli/?print=1 | title=1953 Schiaparelli evening dress | first= | last= | work=Collections database | publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]] | date= | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921120158/http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O15576/evening-dress-elsa-schiaparelli/ | archivedate=2013-09-21 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She famously dressed Mae West for ''[[Every Day's a Holiday (1937 film)|Every Day's a Holiday]]'' (1937) using a mannequin based on West's measurements, which inspired the torso bottle for ''Shocking'' perfume.

Schiaparelli's perfumes were noted for their unusual packaging and bottles. Her best-known perfume was "''Shocking!''" (1936), contained in a bottle sculpted by [[Leonor Fini]] in the shape of a woman's torso inspired by [[Mae West]]'s tailor's dummy and Dalí paintings of flower-sellers.&lt;ref name="fini"&gt;{{cite web | last=Webb | first=Peter | title=Une Grande Curiosité | url=http://www.weinstein.com/fini/fini_text.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216022119/http://www.weinstein.com/fini/fini_text.html | archivedate=2010-12-16 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="perfume"&gt;{{cite web | last= | first= | title=Perfume Intelligence - The Encyclopaedia of Perfume: Volume S : Schiaparelli, Elsa | url=http://www.perfumeintelligence.co.uk/library/perfume/s/houses/SchiapEl.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921175311/http://www.perfumeintelligence.co.uk/library/perfume/s/houses/SchiapEl.htm | archivedate=2013-09-21 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The packaging, also designed by Fini, was in [[shocking pink]], one of Schiaparelli's signature colours which was said to have been inspired by [[Daisy Fellowes]]' ''Tête de Belier'' (Ram's Head) pink diamond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Owens | first=Mitchell | author-link= | publication-date=1997-04-13 | year=1997 | title=Jewelry That Gleams With Wicked Memories | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/13/arts/jewelry-that-gleams-with-wicked-memories.html?pagewanted=2&amp;src=pm | work=The New York Times | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704091912/http://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/13/arts/jewelry-that-gleams-with-wicked-memories.html?pagewanted=2&amp;src=pm | archivedate=2012-07-04 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The failure of her business meant that Schiaparelli's name is not as well remembered as that of her great rival Chanel. But in 1934, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' placed Chanel in the second division of fashion, whereas Schiaparelli was one of "a handful of houses now at or near the peak of their power as arbiters of the ultra-modern haute couture....Madder and more original than most of her contemporaries, Mme Schiaparelli is the one to whom the word "genius" is applied most often".&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite web | last= | first= | author-link= | publication-date=1934-08-13 | title=Haute Couture | publication-place=New York | work=Time | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,747679-4,00.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716204503/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,747679-4,00.html | archivedate=2007-07-16 | deadurl=no }} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time Time recognised that Chanel had assembled a fortune of some US$15m despite being "not at present the most dominant influence in fashion", whereas Schiaparelli relied on inspiration rather than craftsmanship and "it was not long before every little dress factory in Manhattan had copied them and from New York's 3rd Avenue to San Francisco's Howard Street millions of shop girls who had never heard of Schiaparelli were proudly wearing her models".&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;

==The House of Schiaparelli==
The House of Schiaparelli was first opened in the 1930s at 21 [[Place Vendôme]], but was shut down on 13 December 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wmagazine.com/fashion/2013/10/marco-zanini-schiaparelli/photos |title = Schiaparelli: A Shocking Return

'''''Famine-33''''' ({{lang-ua|Голод-33}}, ''Holod-33'') is a 1991 [[drama film]] by Oles Yanchuk about the [[Holodomor]] famine in [[Ukraine]], and based on the novel ''The Yellow Prince'' by [[Vasyl Barka]]. The film is told through the lives of the Katrannyk family of six.

==Synopsis==
"In an early scene, the members of an impoverished farming family solemnly take turns dipping their ladles into the single bowl of watery soup that is their only meal of the day. Later in the film, scores of villagers numb with despair and hunger huddle silently in the pouring rain outside a Government office until a truckload of armed soldiers arrives to disperse them. In the most poignant scene, a little boy who has lost his parents calls for his mother as he wanders, panic-stricken, through a snowy woodland where the trees are outnumbered by crosses marking the dead."&lt;ref&gt;Holden, Stephen. "A Family's Struggle In Stalin's Man-Made Famine: Famine-33 Film Review." ''The New York Times.'' 15 December 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hatchment.JPG|thumb|right|Funerary hatchment at [[Grendon, Northamptonshire|Grendon]] parish church, showing in the dexter half the arms of Compton, [[Marquess of Northampton]]]]
A '''funerary hatchment''' is a depiction within a black [[lozenge]]-shaped frame, generally on a black (''[[Tincture (heraldry)|sable]]'') background, of a deceased's [[Achievement (heraldry)|heraldic achievement]], that is to say  the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] showing the [[Heraldry|arms]], together with the [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] and [[supporter]]s of his  family or person. Regimental Colours and other military or naval emblems are sometimes placed behind the arms of military or naval officers.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hatchment |volume=13 |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such funerary hatchments, generally therefore restricted in use to members of the nobility or armigerous gentry, used to be hung on the wall of a deceased person's house,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; and were later transferred to the parish church, often within the family chapel therein which appertained to the [[manor house]], the family occupying which, generally being [[lord of the manor]], generally held the [[advowson]] of the church. In Germany, the approximate equivalent is a [[:Category:Totenschilden|Totenschild]], literally "death shield".

==Etymology==
"Hatchment" is a corruption (through such historic forms as ''atcheament, achement, hathement'', etc.)&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; of the French ''achevèment'',&lt;ref&gt;Collins Dictionary of the English Language, London, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; from the verb ''achever'', a contraction of ''a chef venir'' ("to come to a head"), ultimately from Latin ''ad caput venire'', "to come to a head",&lt;ref&gt;Larousse Dictionnaire de la Langue Francaise, Paris, 1979: lat. pop. ''capum'', class. ''caput''&lt;/ref&gt; thus to reach a conclusion, accomplish, achieve.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The word in its historical usage is thus identical in meaning and origin to the English heraldic term [[Achievement (heraldry)|achievement]]. However in recent years the word "hatchment" has come to be used almost exclusively to denote "funerary hatchment", whilst "achievement" is now used in place of "hatchment" in a non-funereal context. An example of the historic use of "hatchment" in a non-funerary context is in the statute of the [[Order of the Garter]] laid down by King Henry VIII (1509-1547) concerning the regulation of [[Garter stall plate]]s:&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Horace Round|Round, J. Horace]], Family Origins and Other Studies, Page, William, (ed.), London, 1930, pp.174-189, The Garter Plates and Peerage Styles, p.174&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It is agreed that every knyght within the yere of his stallation shall cause to be made a [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|scauchon]] of his armes and [[Achievement (heraldry)|hachementis]] in a plate of metall suche as shall please him and that it shall be surely sett upon the back of his stall".&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The word appears in [[Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Hamlet]]'' (1599/1602): Laertes laments that his dead father Polonius has "No trophy, sword or hatchment o'er his bones" (Act IV, Scene 5).

==Usage==

===England===
[[File:Coat-of-arms of Sir Thomas Spring, 3rd Baronet.jpg|thumb|right|The funerary hatchment of [[Spring baronets|Sir Thomas Spring, 3rd Baronet]] (1672-1704), displayed in [[Lavenham]] Guildhall]]
[[File:Hatchment 7.jpg|thumb|Hatchment in [[Wymondham Abbey]] bell chamber]]
[[File:Bruxelles Saint-Jacques sur Coudenberg 904.jpg|thumb|Royal hatchments in Brussels]]
The funerary hatchment was usually placed over the entrance door of the deceased's residence at the level of the second floor, and remained ''in situ'' for six to twelve months, after which it was removed to the parish church.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The practice developed in the early 17th century from the custom of carrying an heraldic shield before the coffin of the deceased, then leaving it for display in the church. Funerary hatchments also survive displayed in homes or local museums. In medieval times and later, helmets and shields were sometimes deposited in churches, and helmets (made for the purpose) survive for example in the churches of [[Iron Acton]] in Gloucestershire and [[King's Nympton]] in Devon.

At the universities of [[university of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[university of Cambridge|Cambridge]] it was usual to hang the funerary hatchment of a deceased head of house over the entrance to his lodge or residence.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In the 21st century the display of funerary hatchments has  largely been discontinued, except in the case of royalty and occasionally by the higher nobility, but many ancient funerary hatchments survive displayed in parish churches throughout [[England]].

====Male and female usages====
For a bachelor the hatchment bears his heraldic achievement (shield, crest, supporters and other appendages) on a black lozenge. For a [[spinster]], her arms are represented upon a lozenge, bordered with knotted ribbons, also on a black lozenge.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; In the case of a married man  with a surviving wife, within his funerary hatchment is an escutcheon displaying his arms [[Impalement (heraldry)|impale]] the paternal arms of his wife. If she should be an [[heraldic heiress]] her paternal arms are placed upon an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|inescutcheon of pretence]], and crest and other appendages are added.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The [[Dexter and sinister|dexter]] half of the background is black (the husband being dead), whilst the [[Dexter and sinister|sinister]] half of the background is white&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; (his wife still being alive).

For a deceased woman whose husband is alive the same arrangement is used, but the sinister background is black (for the wife) and the dexter background is white (for the surviving husband). For a widower the same is used as for a married man, but the whole ground is black (both spouses being dead). For a widow the husband's arms are given with her own, but upon a lozenge in place of an escutcheon, with ribbons, without crest or appendages, with the whole of the ground black. When there have been two wives or two husbands the ground may be divided in a number of different ways.  Sometimes the shield is divided into three parts ''per pale'' (vertical divisions), with the husband's arms in the middle section and the arms of each of his wives to each side of his.  Sometimes the husband's arms remain in the dexter half and the two wives have their arms in the sinister half, divided ''per fess'' (horizontal divisions), each wife having one quarter of the whole shield, that is one half of the sinister half.

===Scotland===
In Scottish funerary hatchments it was not unusual to place the arms of the father and mother of the deceased in the two lateral angles of the lozenge, and sometimes there are 4, 8 or 16 [[genealogy|genealogical]] escutcheons ranged along the margin.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Belgium and Netherlands===
In the Netherlands hatchments (in Dutch, ''rouwbord'', literally meaning "mourning shield") with the word "OBIIT" (Latin:"deceased") and the date of death were hung over the door of the deceased's house and later on the wall of the church where he was buried. In the 17th century the hatchments were sober black lozenge-shaped frames with the coat of arms. In the 18th century both the frames and the heraldry got more and more elaborate. Symbols of death like batwings, skulls, hour-glasses and crying angels with torches were added and the names of the 8, 16 or even 32 armigerous forebearers (sometimes an invention, there were a lot of "nouveaux riches") and their genealogical escutcheons were displayed. The British tradition of differentiating between the hatchments of bachelors, widowers and others is unknown in the Low Countries. The arms of a widow are sometimes surrounded by a cordelière (knotted cord) and the arms of women are often, but not always, shaped like a lozenge. There were no Kings of Arms to rule and regulate these traditions.

In 1795 the Dutch republic, recently conquered by revolutionary France, issued a decree that banned all heraldic shields. Thousands of hatchments were chopped to pieces and burned. In the 19th century the hatchments were almost forgotten and only a few noble families kept the tradition alive.

In Flanders, the clergy of the Roman Catholic Church have kept the tradition of putting up hatchments alive to this day. Noble families have continued to put up hatchments in churches.

Unlike the British hatchments the Dutch and Belgian examples are often inscribed with dates of birth and death, often the [[Latin]] words "obit", "nascent" and "svea" are used to give the dates of death and birth and the age of the deceased. The name and titles are sometimes added along with the arms of various ancestors.

Sometimes the coats of arms of man and woman are shown on a hatchment.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Scotland==

Only about fifty hatchments still exist in Scotland, unlike the many to be found in England and the [[Netherlands]], where there may well be more Scots hatchments surviving than in Scotland. Part of this is undoubtedly due to the [[Church of Scotland]] in the mid 17th century. In 1643 the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|General Assembly]] passed an Act in 1643 which prohibited 'Honours of Arms or any such like monuments' to be displayed in any church. A surviving document of [[Huntly|Strathbogie]] in [[Aberdeenshire]] records that: "Att Grange, 19th December, 1649... the presbytry finding some pinselis in memorie of the dead hinging in the kirk, presentlie caused them to be pulled doun in face of presbytry, and the minister rebuiked for suffering to hing ther so long."

Scots hatchments do not follow in the sparse pattern that modern writers prescribe for hatchments and funeral heraldry, being sometimes quite highly decorated with the coats of antecedents and with tears, skulls (mort heads) and mantles.

Hatchments, and funeral heraldry in general, are discussed in a 1986 article by [[Charles Burnett (officer of arms)|Charles J Burnett]], [[Dingwall Pursuivant]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Burnett (officer of arms)|Burnett, C. J.]], "Funeral heraldry in Scotland with particular reference to hatchments" in ''The Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland'' 116 (1986), pp 473–559 [http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/library/psas]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Canada ==
There are eight hatchments in [[Nova Scotia]], Canada, which are located in [[St. Paul's Church (Halifax)]]. They include:

Twenty-nine 18th- and early 19th-century Dutch-style rouwborden are known to survive in the province of the [[Western Cape]], which was a Dutch colony from 1652 to 1806.  Twenty-five are in the [[Groote Kerk, Cape Town|Groote Kerk]] in Cape Town, one is in the Western Cape Archives, and the other three are in museums.

During the period of Dutch rule, the display of rouwborden was evidently restricted to senior officials and military officers, and a few high-ranking foreign dignitaries who died at the Cape.  When the main part of the church building was demolished in 1836, because it had become structurally unsound, the rouwborden were stored in the tower.  They were left there after the rebuilt church was completed in 1841, and reportedly deteriorated with the passage of time.  Some forty years later, the newly-established Colonial Archives rescued twenty-five of them,&lt;ref name=hcvl&gt;Leibbrandt, H.C.V., ''Rambles through the Archives of the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope'' (1886).&lt;/ref&gt; and they were displayed in the Archives until the church reclaimed them in 1910.&lt;ref name=hch&gt;Hopkins, H.C.,  ''Die Moeder van Ons Almal'' (1965).&lt;/ref&gt;  They were then hung in the vestry, and it was not until the 1960s that they were hung in the church itself.

'''''Hannah Free''''' is a 2009 American lesbian romance film, adapted from [[Claudia Allen]]'s play of the same name.  It is a story about living, loving, and letting go.  Hannah and Rachel grew up as little girls in the same small [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] town, where traditional gender expectations eventually challenged their deep love for one another. Hannah becomes an adventurous, unapologetic [[lesbian]] and Rachel a strong but quiet [[homemaker]]. Weaving back and forth between past and present, the film reveals how the women maintained their love affair despite a marriage, a [[world war]], [[Infidelity|infidelities]], and family denial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hannahfree.com/hannah_free_synopsis.html |title=Ripe Fruit Films |publisher=Hannah Free |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hannah Free'' is a feature-length motion picture shot in [[High-definition video|HD]] for distribution in worldwide theatrical and ancillary markets.  It stars [[Sharon Gless]], Maureen Gallagher, Kelli Strickland, Ann Hagemann, [[Taylor Miller]], and Jax Jackson. The film is produced by Ripe Fruit Films, LLC.

==Plot==
Set mostly in a nursing home, 70-something Hannah is kept separate from her lifelong friend and lover Rachel, who is not expected to emerge from her coma.  The nurses follow the orders of Rachel's daughter Marge, who claims her mother would be upset by a visit from Hannah.

While Hannah's heart is breaking at the thought of not being able to say goodbye, her mind is full of memories of their life together, and she is frequently visited by a younger, spirit Rachel.  Hannah sees, hears, and experiences her, but to anyone else, Hannah appears to be talking to herself.  Frustrated by feeling like a prisoner, Hannah grumbles, pleads to see Rachel, and writes in her journal.  The backstory gradually emerges.

Hannah transitioned easily from tomboy to openly gay while Rachel gave in to societal expectations, married, raised twins, and kept one foot in the closet most of her life, even though everyone knew about her and Hannah.  Having Hannah around was like flying a rainbow flag.  Hannah was born to wander.  Rachel never left Michigan, but Hannah spent time in Alaska, South America, and during WWII, stationed in New Mexico as a WAC.  She had affairs with other women in her travels and they remained good friends, but Rachel always was her true love.
There are many flashbacks that show Hannah and Rachel in many aspects of their relationship: being in love, making love, and arguing.

In the nursing home, Hannah deals with the annoying but well-meaning staff members, a bewildered resident, a nasty evangelist, and an equally nasty Marge.  The arrival of 21-year-old Greta serves as a catalyst to get Hannah out of bed and into Rachel's room.  Greta poses as a random student doing an interview for class, but turns out to be Rachel's biological great-granddaughter, whom Hannah had only met as a young child.  Greta has a complicated relationship with her grandmother, Marge, who has never truly accepted Hannah as any sort of important mother figure.  Greta, a young lesbian, is fully committed to the rights of Hannah and Rachel, and schemes to bring the family together.

In an emotional final scene, Rachel lays comatose, while Hannah, Marge and Greta hash out their differences.  Together, they say goodbye to Rachel, and lovingly set her free.

==Pre-production==
''Hannah Free'' was adapted by Claudia Allen from her own play. Claudia Allen is a playwright-in-residence at [[Victory Gardens Theater]] in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorygardens.org/content/node/194 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201120312/http://www.victorygardens.org/content/node/194 |date=December 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A hallmark of Allen’s plays is the portrayal of strong, compassionate women. Author’s note: “Few plays are written about elderly lesbians. Fewer plays deal with their extreme vulnerability in a system that doesn’t recognize our rights. I wanted to deal with those issues while also creating a love story about two women who loved each other for decades despite a few flaws and more than a few differences.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukgaynews.org.uk/Archive/08/Oct/3003.htm |title=Sharon Gless to Star in Lesbian-Themed Film "Hanna Free" |publisher=Ukgaynews.org.uk |date=2008-10-30 |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wendy Jo Carlton is a [[filmmaker]], writer, and photographer with a background in radio production, teaching, and [[media activism]].

'''List of American painters exhibited at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition.'''
Chicago hosted the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]], a world's fair commemorating the 400th anniversary of [[Christopher Columbus]]'s arrival in the New World. Artists from the United States and 19 foreign countries exhibited at the Exposition. A complete list of the artists and works exhibited in the Palace of Fine Arts can be found here:[https://archive.org/stream/worldscolumbian10worl#page/12/mode/2up]

The Art Department's focus was on modern American painting, works painted in the 17 years since the 1876 [[Centennial Exposition]].&lt;ref name="Carr"/&gt; Hundreds of American painters submitted works, and more than 1,000 paintings in oil and more than 200 in watercolor were selected for exhibition in the Palace of Fine Arts.{{efn|Art juries had been directed to select a maximum of 3 works per artist, but exceptions were made for prominent artists&amp;mdash;George Inness exhibited 15 paintings, Winslow Homer and D. W. Tryon each exhibited 14, Kenyon Cox and Robert Vonnoh each exhibited 13, Thomas Eakins exhibited 10 (plus another in the Pennsylvania State Building).&lt;ref name="Carr"/&gt;}} Additional works&amp;mdash;not in competition for medals&amp;mdash;were exhibited in other Exposition buildings, including the [[The Woman's Building (Chicago)|Woman's Building]] and individual state buildings.

The tradition of the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] was to award a single gold medal (first place), a couple silver medals (second place), several bronze medals (third place), and numerous honorable mentions (fourth place) in each medium (oils, watercolor, sculpture, etc.). Instead of this tiered system with medals awarded for individual paintings, Exposition judges awarded a single level of medals and for an artist's whole exhibit.{{efn|This medals system was unpopular with artists, who feared that "painters and sculptors whose work barely reached the mark" would receive "exactly the same distinction as artists who show masterpieces."&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', August 27, 1893, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The next American world's fair&amp;mdash;the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York&amp;mdash;returned to gold, silver and bronze medals and honorable mentions, but awarded them for an artist's whole exhibit.}} Fifty-seven American painters received medals "for excellence" for works in oil, and 11 for works in watercolor.&lt;ref name="Revised"&gt;Department of Fine Arts, ''World's Columbian Exposition, Revised Catalogue, Department of Fine Arts, with Index of Exhibitors'' (Chicago: W.B. Conkey Company, 1893).[https://archive.org/stream/revisedcatalogue00chic#page/14/mode/2up]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14–15}}

Author Henry Davenport Northrop made a key observation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The American artists are practically of three classes&amp;mdash;those who have studied entirely in this country; those who have studied abroad, but have returned to America and partly shaken off the foreign influence; and those who have remained abroad, painting very much like the artists of the country in which they live.&lt;ref name="Northrup"&gt;Henry Davenport Northrup and Nancy Huston Banks, ''The World's Fair as Seen in One Hundred Days'' (Philadelphia: Ariel Book Company, 1893).[https://archive.org/stream/worldsfairasseen00nort#page/290/mode/2up]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|291}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Exposition closed at the end of October 1893. Many of its buildings were destroyed in a July 1894 fire that swept through the vacant fairgrounds.

==About this list==
The table below lists American painters who received special recognition, and/or whose exhibited works can be found in the [[Smithsonian Institution Research Information System]] database:[https://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=153P810S2175O.14633&amp;profile=ariall&amp;lang=eng&amp;logout=true&amp;startover=true] Except where noted, the paintings were exhibited in the United States section of the Palace of Fine Arts and listed in the initial catalogue. A revised catalogue listed a small number of additional paintings.{{efn|The initial catalogue listed the painters alphabetically, but their works could be spread throughout more than a dozen rooms. The revised catalogue both listed the painters alphabetically and listed the paintings room-by-room and wall-by-wall.&lt;ref name="Revised"/&gt;}} Images of the works have been added, where available, as well as their current whereabouts.

A body has been washed up, a man is kneeling beside it to see who it is, a few fishermen and women give information about the shipwreck victim to a gendarme. So it looks somewhat like ''Victim of a Shipwreck'' that you have, but the drawing by R. has something of [Félix] Régamey, for example. It's a very fine print." &amp;mdash; Vincent van Gogh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let346/letter.html#translation Vincent van Gogh to Anthon van Rappard, 25 May 1883]&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;br&gt;Ex collection: Corcoran Gallery of Art

'''Luděk Alois Marold''' (7 August 1865, [[Prague]] – 1 December 1898, Prague) was a Czech painter and illustrator, best known for his panorama depicting the [[Battle of Lipany]]. It is the largest painting in the Czech Republic and currently has its own pavilion at the [[Výstaviště Praha|Výstaviště]] exhibition grounds.

== Biography ==
[[File:Ludek Marold Maler im Atelier.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The Artist in His Studio (1892)]]
He was born out of wedlock and given his mother's surname. His father, an Army Lieutenant, was killed the following year during the [[Austro-Prussian War]] and his mother died six years later. The next nine years of his life are largely undocumented, although he apparently tried to enter Cadet School, but failed the examinations.&lt;ref name="R"&gt;[http://www.rodon.cz/zivotopisy-umelcu/Marold-Ludek-73  Brief biography] @ Rodon.&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of sixteen, he entered the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Prague|Academy of Fine Arts]], but remained for only a year and was expelled. 

His studies did not resume until 1881, when he enrolled at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich]], where his instructors were [[Ludwig von Löfftz]] and [[Nikolaos Gysis]].&lt;ref name="O"&gt;{{ÖBL|6|106|107|Marold Luděk|V. Kratinová}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there, he exchanged ideas with other Czech painters such as [[Mikoláš Aleš]] and [[Alfons Mucha]]. His first professional successes came as an illustrator for several German and Czech magazines, such as ''[[Světozor]]''.&lt;ref name="R" /&gt;

During this time, he began to suffer from [[rheumatic fever]] so, in 1887, he returned to Prague,&lt;ref name="R" /&gt; where he worked in the studios of [[Maximilian Pirner]]&lt;ref name="O" /&gt; and edited publications from the newly established [[Mánes Union of Fine Arts]], headed by his old friend Aleš. Two years later, he received a state scholarship to study in Paris, where he found a position in the studios of [[Pierre-Victor Galland]]. In 1891, he was married. The following year, after Galland's death, he gave up his scholarship to become a freelance artist.&lt;ref name="R" /&gt; He continued to create illustrations for periodicals and books by Czech authors and received a gold medal at an exhibition in Munich in 1892. Later, he adopted the [[Art Nouveau]] style and began receiving orders for posters. In 1895, he was elected a member of the "{{ill|Czech Academy of Arts and Sciences|cs|Česká akademie věd a umění}}".

By 1897, he was back in Prague, where he proposed creating a gigantic panorama of the Battle of Lipany for an upcoming exhibition. His proposal was accepted and, after making sketches at the battlefield, he began work in early 1898. He collaborated with Karel Raška (1861-1918), the landscape painter [[Václav Jansa]], colorist  Theodor Hilšer (1866-1930) and the animal painter {{ill|Ludvík Vacátko|cs}}. It measures 11 meters (36 feet) high and 95 meters (311 feet) long. The stress of completing this huge work on schedule had a fatal effect on his already fragile health and he died shortly after it went on display in 1898. A major retrospective of his work was held the following year.&lt;ref name="R" /&gt; Three streets in have been named after him; in [[Děčín]], [[Kladno]] and Prague.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8688">The mosaic dance of [[Iran]] is as vibrant as the country's cultural diversity, and the [[Iranian dance]]s are the colorful tapestries of practices which permeate the country, as well as the [[Iranian diaspora]].&lt;ref&gt;Meftahi, Ida (2017). Gender and Dance in Modern Iran, Biopolitics on stage. Routledge publication, Volume: 5 Issue: 2, page:13&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Lurish dances''' include a range of [[folk dance]]s popular among different groups of [[Lur people]] which have formed, developed and transferred during the subsequent generations. They  usually include common [[Iranian dance]]s; Collective dances and [[quadrille]], the circular arrangement ([[circle dance]]), and the colorful clothing.&lt;ref&gt;ثابت زاده، منصوره.

==History==
Due to discovered objects and archeological excavations from Lurish-inhabited areas like Kozagaran, Tepe Giyan, Tepe Musiyan, CheghaMish and [[Kul-e Farah]], it is evident that dance history predates the [[Arian]] migrations inward the [[Iranian plateau]].&lt;ref&gt;Garfinkel, Y.(2010) Dancing at the Dawn of Agriculture.University of Texas Publication, 346 pages, {{ISBN|9780292779969}}, Available online at: [https://books.google.de/books?id=50uCw0DcW_MC&amp;pg=RA1-PT387&amp;lpg=RA1-PT387&amp;dq=tepe+giyan+dance&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yjhwbYtC26&amp;sig=j-u_l8j1Fo3tYQbFdtj-jj874r0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiep5nPxLDUAhWHtBQKHSgFBG0Q6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tepe%20giyan%20dance&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Contenau, G and R. Ghirshman (1935).Fouilles du Tepe Giyan, Paris: Librairie Orientaliste Paul Geuthner. Contenson, H. de. 1967. Troisieme campagne a Tell&lt;/ref&gt; Motifs depicting three dancing persons on the [[pottery]] discovered and  dance portrays on the bronze flags of [[Luristan]] of the first millennium BC, musicians and musical instruments depicted on the petroglyphs in [[Kul-e Farah]] of [[Izeh]] and Cheghamish are the most prominent archaeological evidences showing the value and history of dance in these areas.

==Styles==
There are many dance styles common in Lurish-inhabited areas. The most prevalent Lurish dance styles are handkerchief dance, Chupi dances (SanguinSama; slow rhythm along with strike and [[fiddle]], Se-Pa (three steps) dance that is performed faster than SanguinSama, and Du-Pa (Two steps) dance that is the fastest and the most exciting performance), and the stick dance (Çubâzi or Tarka-bâzi)(like Jitterbug wood) which is a martial show.&lt;ref&gt;Elton Daniel and AliAkbar Mahdi, 2006, Culture and Customs of Iran, Westport,Greenwood Press, 210 pages&lt;/ref&gt; Harvesting ceremony dances, PaPoshtePa dances, Suwaruna and the mourning dances are of less popular dances. Mourning dances are performed while loved persons are died as [[Chamariuna]] among [[Feylis]] and also among [[Great Lur]] tribes ([[Bakhtiari people|Bakhtiries]] and the [[Southern Lurs]]).

===Dasmâl-bâzi (Handkerchief dance)===
[[File:Lur handkerchief dancer, Mamasani, Iran.jpg|thumb|250px| Handkerchief dancers in a wedding ceremony, Mamasani, Iran|right]]
Handkerchief dance also known as scarf dance ([[Lurish language|Lurish]]:Dasmâl-bâzi) is a vibrant [[circle dance]] style. This dance style is more common among [[Southern Lurs]] and [[Bakhtiari people]]. This style is usually performed by both male and female persons and includes different performing styles like Ashtafi-manganâ. Men or women may dance and wave colorful scarves, called dastmâl. A dasmâl is held in each hand. In case of the philosophy, it is believed that these dances have originated in the actions the women do in their daily livelihood. As the dance rhythm increases slowly, each person may chooses patterns to perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://home.earthlink.net/~rcfriend/video-2.htm|title = Dances of Iran, Robyn Friend|date = 2000|accessdate = October 17, 2014|website = |publisher = Neil Siegel|last = Siegel|first = Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtiyari Dances, CD Number [174], Published [05/08/2004], Collected &amp; Researched by: Mansureh Sabetzadeh, available online at:[http://www.mahoor.com/cd/Folk-Music-Original/Bakhtiyari-Dances-211.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ču-bâzi (Twig dance)===
Ču-bâzi or Chubazi (twig dance) is a special [[dance double]] that is performed in the  celebrations and joys by [[Bakhtiari people|Bakhtiari]] and the [[southern Lurs]] and is inspired by the [[heroic]] battles.&lt;ref&gt;Elton Daniel and AliAkbar Mahdi, 2006, Culture and Customs of Iran, Westport,Greenwood Press, 210 pages&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually dance by two men, although sometimes is performed by the women too. One dancer (the defender) is equipped with a long heavy stick up to four or five feet long. The other (the attacker) whom holds a shorter flexible stick (tarka), has to attack the opponent only below the level of the knee. While the dance is accompanied by [[drum]] and [[karnâ]] (a horn music instrument), the defender is only allowed to escape the strike by leaping up in the air. The contributors change in turn till the protagaonists are specified.&lt;ref&gt;David Brooks, The enemy within: limitations on leadership in the Bakhtiari, in The Conflict of Tribes and State in Iran and Afghanistan, ed: Richard Tapper, London, 1983, pp 15-18.&lt;/ref&gt; The dancers are surrounded by female and male enthusiastic audiences whom cheer the winners by screams and whistles.

===Čupi (Choupi)===
[[File:A Feyli Lurish Čupi dancer.jpg|thumb|A Feyli Lur woman, performing Čupi dance]]
In [[Lurish language|Lurish]] dialects, mass dance styles that are mainly based on leg movements are said Čupi (چووپی, Choupi). Mixed male and female dancers hold hands to form rings, hearing the vibrant musics by musicians, they perform different styles of čupi. The leader performer (Sarčupi or Čupikeš) is a skillful dancer whose duty is to lead others and warm up them in accordance with dance music rhythms. Other performers should coordinate the movements and body rhythms with the leader. The dance usually starts with Sangin-Samâ rhythm which is performed slowly, following Sepâ (Three steps) the next rhythm with faster performing and soars when vibrant Dopâ (two steps) is performing. After a while, the dance concludes to Sangin-Samâ movements in a reversed trend.&lt;ref&gt;گژک, تارنمای اینترنتی تبار لر. [http://www.gezhek.ir/38«"رقص لری (چوپی)".»].

====Sangin-Samâ====
Sangin-samâ (also Sangin-sepâ or Samâ) is usually the first phase of Čupi mass dance style and includes gentle and slow movements. Performers, initially put their right foot in the form of a cross with left foot, then take it  and take two steps forward. Then they put the left foot with the tip of the toe and finally put it aside right foot. The hands bend from elbow and small fingers of dancers, in line with the shoulders, are tied among each other. It seems that each of the gestures and dance components of Sama, has a philosophy retrieved from thousands years of coexistence with humane and natural elements behind it.&lt;ref&gt;Mortezai Darikvand, Ali. [http://www.goftarema.ir/%D9%81%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%81%D9%87-%D8%B3%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D9%84%D8%B1%DB%8C-%DA%AF%D9%81%D8%AA-%D9%88%DA%AF%D9%88-%D8%A8%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A-%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%AA/ "The Philosophy Behind the Lurish Samâ dance"], ''Goftare Mâ, Information Agency'', Tehran, 12 February 2016. Retrieved on 27 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sepâ====
[[File:Čupi Dance by Feyli Lurs in Sweden.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Čupi Dance by Feyli Lurs in Sweden]]
In Čupi dance continuum, the second phase is Sepâ (three steps) which is performed faster and more dynamic than Sangin-Samâ in accordance with speeding up the music rhythm. Dancers start the dance with the right foot and take three steps forward. In Lurish dances, like most Iranian group dances, the start of the move is with the right foot. After removing the three steps, the dancers first bend the right leg and then the left foot. The dancers' hands in this dance are tied to each other and their shoulders rely on each other. The literal meaning of dance in [[Lurish language|Lurish]] (Dasgerta), is the bond between hands when dancing.

The '''Mermaid of Warsaw''' ({{lang-pl|Syrenka Warszawska}}) is a symbol of [[Warsaw]], represented on [[Coat of arms of Warsaw|the city's coat of arms]] as well as in a number of statues and other imagery.

==Etymology==
Polish ''syrenka'' is [[cognate]] with [[siren (mythology)|siren]], but she is more properly a fresh-water mermaid called [[Melusine|melusina]]. The common English translation, in any case, is neither siren nor melusina but [[mermaid]].

== Origin ==

A creature was on Warsaw's coat of arms in 1390. It showed an animal with bird's legs and a torso covered with dragon scales. The seal of 1459 had feminine characteristics, a bird torso, human hands, a fish tail, and bird legs and claws. The first presentation of a mermaid dates from 1622.

The inspiration for the coat of arms was probably derived from the 2nd century book [[Physiologus]].

== The legend of the Warsaw mermaid ==

There are several legends about mermaid. The City's literature and tour guides say the mermaid decided to stay after stopping on a riverbank near the Old Town. Fishermen noticed something was creating waves, tangling nets, and releasing their fish. They planned to trap the animal, then heard her singing and fell in love. A rich merchant trapped and inprisoned the mermaid. Hearing her cries, the fishermen rescued her. Ever since the mermaid, armed with a sword and a shield, has been ready to help protect the city and its residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.warsawtour.pl/en/warsaw-for-everyone/for-kids/warsaw-legends-3160.html |title=Warsaw legends |work=Warsaw Tour/Fall in love with Warsaw |publisher=Warsaw Tourist Office |accessdate=2014-10-02 |quote=Ever since, the Mermaid, armed with sword and shield, has been ready to help protect the city and its residents |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006120430/https://www.warsawtour.pl/en/warsaw-for-everyone/for-kids/warsaw-legends-3160.html |archivedate=2014-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes this legend is expanded to say the [[The Little Mermaid (statue)|Little Mermaid]] in [[Copenhagen]] is the Warsaw mermaid's sister and they went separate ways from the [[Baltic Sea]].

Another states she helped a prince lost hunting and he founded the city in her honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inyourpocket.com/poland/warsaw/The-story-of-Syrenka-The-Symbol-of-Warsaw_71466f |title=The Story of Syrenka - Symbol of Warsaw |work=In Your Pocket |publisher=In Your Pocket |accessdate=2014-10-02 |quote=Miraculously, a mermaid emerged and guided the prince to safety by firing burning arrows into the sky. Warsaw was founded out of gratitude, and the mermaid adopted as its emblem. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Monuments and carvings of the Warsaw mermaid ==

Examples include:

=== The Old Town Market Place ===
The sculpture in Warsaw's [[Old Town Market Place, Warsaw|Old Town Square]] was designed by Varsovian sculptor Konstanty Hegel.

Originally (1855-1928) and now (since 2000) it stands in the marketplace. At other times, it was moved to different places in Warsaw. In 2008, the original sculpture made of bronzed zinc was taken from the market for maintenance work. The sculpture was in a very poor condition due to mechanical damage and numerous acts of vandalism. The repaired original was transferred to the [[Museum of Warsaw]], and replaced with a copy of made by the Jacek Guzera foundry in Dąbrowie near [[Kielce]].

=== Powiśle ===
This statue, made of [[gunmetal]], was erected in April 1939 in [[Powiśle]] near the Vistula river. The sculpture is by Ludwika Nitschowa and posed by poet [[Krystyna Krahelska]].

In autumn of 2006, a silver plaque of the [[Virtuti Militari]] was added to the monument for [[Władysław Sikorski|General Sikorski]] who was awarded it in recognition of his defense of Warsaw in September 1939.

=== The Markiewicz viaduct ===
A mermaid sculpted by Jan Woydyga was erected on the Stanislaw Markiewicz viaduct in Karowa Street in 1905.

=== The Sejm ===
A mermaid designed by Alexander Żurakowski in 1947 was engraved onto the shield on the breast of a statue of an eagle located in the main meeting hall of the Polish parliament, the [[Sejm]].

=== Inżynierska Street ===
This mermaid is over the entrance to the former tram depot on 6 Inżynierska Street.

=== Katowicka Street ===
Located on the building of School No. 77 on the corner of Katowicka and Zwycięzców streets in [[Saska Kępa]], the [[Relief#Bas-relief or low relief|bas-relief]] is by Wojciech Czerwosz.

=== Grochowska Street ===
This mermaid is in front of the district office of the Warsaw borough of Praga-Południe at 274 Grochowska Street, and was made by Jerzy Chojnacki. It originally stood in Saska Kępa, in front of the Sawa movie theater.

=== The Palace of Culture and Science ===
At the top of the [[Palace of Culture and Science]], on each clock face (which were added prior to millennium celebrations in 2000), there is the Warsaw mermaid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Palac_Kultury_i_Nauki_Detal_80_30017.jpg |title=File:Palac Kultury i Nauki Detal 80 30017.jpg |author=User: TenKobuz |work=Wikimedia |publisher=Wikimedia |date=2014-06-10 |accessdate=2014-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Outside Warsaw ===
A memorial fountain of the Warsaw mermaid with a similar shape to the monument in Powiśle is located in the central square of [[Bielsko-Biała]]. It was created in 1954 by [[Ryszard Sroczyński]].

The '''New Zealand Institute of Architects gold medal''' is an award presented annually by the [[New Zealand Institute of Architects|NZIA]] to a New Zealand architect.
[[File:Auckland War Memorial Museum, 2016-01-21.jpg|thumb|Grierson, Aimer &amp; Draffin's design for the [[Auckland War Memorial Museum]] won the Gold Medal in 1929.]]

== History ==
From 1927 until 1977 a gold, silver or bronze prize was awarded each for the design of a public building and was judged by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects|Royal institute of British Architects]]. In 1978 a "National Award" replaced the Gold Medal. The Gold Medal was reintroduced in 2001 and is awarded to an architect who, over a period of time, has made an outstanding contribution to the practice of architecture, rather than for a specific building. This contribution is demonstrated through the production of a consistently high-quality body of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nzia.co.nz/news--media/aon-new-zealand-named-as-principal-sponsor-of-2016-gold-medal-tour.aspx|title=New Zealand Institute of Architects – Aon New Zealand named as Principal Sponsor of 2016 Gold Medal Tour|last=(www.bka.co.nz)|first=Site designed and developed by bka interactive ltd, Auckland, New Zealand|website=www.nzia.co.nz|access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Octopus's Garden'''" is a song by [[the Beatles]] written and sung by [[Ringo Starr]] (credited to his real name Richard Starkey) from the Beatles' 1969 album ''[[Abbey Road]]''. [[George Harrison]], who assisted Starr with the song, commented: "'Octopus's Garden' is Ringo's song. It's only the second song Ringo has ever written, mind you, and it's lovely." He added that the song gets very deep into the listener's consciousness "...because it's so peaceful. I suppose Ringo is writing cosmic songs these days without even realising it."&lt;ref name='Marks2009'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musicbyday.com/abbey-road-the-beatles-in-their-own-words/574/ |title=Abbey Road: The Beatles In Their Own Words |accessdate=18 September 2009 |last=Marks |first=Marvin |date=23 August 2009 |work=Music by Day |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jsjD06AO?url=http://www.musicbyday.com/abbey-road-the-beatles-in-their-own-words/574/ |archivedate=18 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the last song released by the Beatles featuring Starr on lead vocals.

==Composition==
The idea for the song came about when Starr was on a boat belonging to comedian [[Peter Sellers]] in [[Sardinia]] in 1968. He ordered [[fish and chips]] for lunch, but instead of fish he got [[squid]] (it was the first time he'd eaten squid, and he said, "It was OK. A bit rubbery. [[Tastes like chicken|Tasted like chicken]].")&lt;ref&gt;[[The Beatles Anthology|''Anthology'']] book (2000, p. 312)&lt;/ref&gt; The boat's captain then told Starr about how [[octopus]]es travel along the sea bed picking up stones and shiny objects with which to build gardens.&lt;ref name="interviewdb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beatlesinterviews.org/dba11road.html |title=Abbey Road |publisher=The Beatles Interview Database |accessdate=25 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starr's songwriting was further inspired by his desire to escape mounting hostility among the Beatles; he would later admit that he had "just wanted to be under the sea, too." Uncredited assistance in developing the song's chord changes was provided by Harrison, who can be seen helping Starr work the song out on piano, with Lennon later joining in with drums, in the ''[[Let It Be (film)|Let It Be]]'' documentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spizer|first=Bruce|authorlink=Bruce Spizer|title=The Beatles on Apple Records|publisher=498 Productions|year=2003|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The song, which contains the lyrics "Oh what joy for every girl and boy/Knowing they're happy and they're safe,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brianhartzog.com/beatles/beatles-song-lyrics-to-octopuss-garden.htm |title=The Beatles-"Octopus's Garden" Song Lyrics |publisher=Brianhartzog.com |accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is sometimes thought of as being a song for children,&lt;ref&gt;George Harrison,{{cite web |url=http://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/octopuss-garden|title=Octopus's Garden|publisher=beatlesbible.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; like "[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]"  or "[[All Together Now]]". It has also been performed by the [[Muppets]] several times in various episodes of their shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id = f9uo98lORhw|title =Classic Sesame Street - Octopus's Garden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recording==
The basic instrumental [[multitrack recording|track]] was recorded 26 April 1969, with the Beatles lineup of two [[electric guitar]]s (Harrison and Lennon, the latter using his fingerstyle technique as on "[[Julia (The Beatles song)|Julia]]", "[[Dear Prudence]]", etc.){{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}, [[bass guitar]] (McCartney) and [[drum kit|drums]] (Starr). Starr also provided a temporary guide vocal. (Take 2 of the recording, featuring this guide vocal, Starr singing the first verse three times, is track 14 on disc 2 of ''[[Anthology 3]]''.) In the absence of [[George Martin]], the Beatles themselves were listed as producer, with Martin's apprentice [[Chris Thomas (record producer)|Chris Thomas]] present in the [[control room]] to assist. Thirty-two takes were required before the Beatles were satisfied with the track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewisohn |first=Mark |title=The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions |publisher=Hamlyn |location=London |year=2004 |isbn=0-681-03189-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The backing vocals by McCartney and Harrison during the guitar solo were put through [[Audio level compression|compressors]] and [[Audio level compression#Limiting|limiters]] to create a gurgling sound. Starr added the sound of bubbles being blown into a glass of milk using a straw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Venue/8313/discography/a_12.htm |title=DM Beatle's Site: Abbey Road (UK, 1969) |publisher=Webcitation.org |accessdate=21 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kn5MMwun?url=http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Venue/8313/discography/a_12.htm |archivedate=25 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upv.es/~ecabrera/abbey.html |title=Only Some Northern Songs in Abbey Road}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personnel==
* [[Ringo Starr]] &amp;ndash; [[Lead vocalist|lead vocal]], [[Drum kit|drums]], [[Percussion instrument|percussion]], [[sound effect]]s
* [[George Harrison]] &amp;ndash; [[Backing vocalist|backing vocal]], [[lead guitar]]
* [[Paul McCartney]] &amp;ndash; backing vocal, [[Bass guitar|bass]], [[piano]]
* [[John Lennon]] &amp;ndash; backing vocal (over chorus, solo and coda), [[rhythm guitar]]

==Re-release==
The song was remixed in 2006 for the Beatles album ''[[Love (The Beatles album)|Love]]'', which contained remixes of classic Beatles songs.  The remix begins with Starr's vocals over the orchestration from "[[Good Night (Beatles song)|Good Night]]", then transitions into the original instrumental backing track on the line "I'd ask my friends...", with sound effects from "[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]" added in the background.  During the guitar solo, the drum track is replaced with that of "[[Lovely Rita]]".

The track, in its original form, is also available on the compilation ''[[1967-1970]]''.

==Book==
Starr wrote ''[[Octopus's Garden (book)|Octopus's Garden]]'', a 2014 children's book based on the song. The book, which consists of the song's lyrics, is illustrated by Ben Cort.&lt;ref name="Octopus's Garden"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Starr|first1=Ringo|last2=Cort|first2=Ben|title=Octopus's Garden|url=http://books.simonandschuster.com/Octopuss-Garden/Ringo-Starr/9781481403627|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|v7ErlAgTju8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A CD is included with the book, including an introduction by Starr, a new version of the song, the lyrics spoken as prose, and an instrumental version of the song.

==Other versions==
[[Jim Henson|Jim Henson's]] [[Muppets]] made three video cover versions of the song, on ''[[Sesame Street]]'', episode 19 in 1969, ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in March 1970, and ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' episode 312 in 1978, which was performed by [[Robin the Frog]], [[Kermit the Frog]] and [[Miss Piggy]].

In the PBS educational show ''[[Zoom (1972 TV series)|Zoom]]'', the cast from Season 5 did a version of the song.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

[[Reparata and the Delrons]] released the song as a single in 1972 on Dart records, backed with "Your Life Is Gone". It used vocal effects and ocean-themed sound effects to mimic the style of their 1968 UK hit, "[[Captain of Your Ship]]". It was re-released in 1976, with the A- and B-sides reversed, and credited to Reparata (no Delrons).

[[Noel Gallagher]] of [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] adds adapted lyrics from "Octopus's Garden" to the end of their song "[[Whatever (Oasis song)|Whatever]]" during some of his live performances. The phrase "I'd like to be under the sea" is in the refrain of one of Oasis' most popular b-sides, "Take Me Away". Also, the refrain from the chorus of "Octopus's Garden" can be heard about forty seconds from the end of ''[[The Masterplan (song)|The Masterplan]]'', also by Oasis.

The song was covered and recorded by Canadian children's musician [[Raffi (musician)|Raffi]] for the 1985 album ''[[One Light, One Sun]]''.

[[The Punkles]] did a punk cover on their fourth album ''For Sale'' sung by their drummer Markey Starkey.

In 1999, [[Melissa Joan Hart]] did an electropop cover for her film ''[[Sabrina Down Under]]''.

A [[Mashup (music)|mashup]] with [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]'s "[[Heart of Glass (song)|Heart of Glass]]" circulated on the Internet in 2007, as ''Glass Octopus''.

The comedy team at [[CollegeHumor]] created a parody tribute to the band entitled "[http://www.collegehumor.com/video:1913069 Ringo Wants to Sing More]". The video was posted on their website on 24 June 2009.

Leah Erbe performed the cover of "Octopus's Garden" on the Motion Picture Soundtrack for ''[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003DFJVFE IMAX: Under The Sea]''. The soundtrack was released by New Line Records on 1 April 2010.

==Popular culture==
There is a cocktail named after the song,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barnonedrinks.com/drinks/by_category/cocktails-2/o.html |title=Cocktail Recipes at Bar None : O |publisher=Barnonedrinks.com |accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which contains vermouth and gin.

In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Lisa the Vegetarian]]", Linda McCartney mentions that they like hanging out in Apu's "garden in the shade" when they are in Springfield, which is a lyric from the song.

In the 2009 romantic comedy film ''[[(500) Days of Summer]]'', Summer Finn ([[Zooey Deschanel]]) remarks that "Octopus's Garden" is the greatest Beatles song ever. Tom Hanson ([[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]]) tells Summer that no one loves Ringo Starr, to which Summer replies "That's what I love about him".

In the 2007 comedy film ''[[Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story]]'', Ringo Starr ([[Jason Schwartzman]]) refers to his "song about an octopus", which is followed by a crude remark from John Lennon ([[Paul Rudd]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0841046/quotes |title=Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story (2007) - Memorable quotes |publisher=The Internet Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OCL predates the GFDL (Nov 2002) and Creative Commons (Dec 2002) by over four years, while the improved OPL predates both by over three years. The OCL was developed primarily by me... The improved OPL was written primarily by Eric Raymond after discussions with me, Tim O’Reilly, and others... The OPL was truly innovative in that, in addition to requiring citation of the original author as source, it contained two license options which authors could choose to invoke: one restricts users’ abilities to creative derivative works, while the second restricts users’ abilities to make certain commercial uses of the material. The student of open content licensing will recognize that these are exactly the options that Creative Commons now employs. What may be forgotten is that in version 1.0 of the Creative Commons licenses, Attribution was actually included in the licenses only as an option. In version 2.0 of the CC licenses (May 24, 2004) attribution was standard on every license, and there were two licenses options: one regarding derivative works, and one regarding commercial use. So in terms of high level structure, the OPL was here about five years before CC. ... Actually, the [OCL and OPL] licenses weren’t that great, seeing as I am not a lawyer, and neither was anyone else involved in the creation of the license. The concept was right, and the execution was “good enough,” but Creative Commons (with its excellent lawyers and law school students) created a better legal instrument. As I said on the opencontent.org homepage on Monday June 30, 2003: 'My main goal in beginning OpenContent back in the Spring of 1998 was to evangelize a way of thinking about sharing materials, especially those that are useful for supporting education. ... I’m closing OpenContent because I think Creative Commons is doing a better job of providing licensing options which will stand up in court [and I'm joining] Creative Commons as Director of Educational Licenses. Now I can focus in on facilitating the kind of sharing most interesting to me ... with the pro bono support of really good IP lawyers... The OpenContent License and Open Publication License will remain online for archival purposes in their current locations. However, no future development will occur on the licenses themselves.' ... Anyone interested in a license like this is far better off using a Creative Commons license.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Paths of Glory''''' is a 1917 painting by British artist [[Christopher Nevinson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-27903827|title=The faceless men|date=23 June 2014|accessdate=23 June 2014|author=Allan Little|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title quotes from a line from [[Thomas Gray]]'s poem ''[[Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard]]'': "The paths of glory lead but to the grave". It is held by the [[Imperial War Museum]] in London, which describes it as "one of Nevinson's most famous paintings".&lt;ref name=IWMPaths&gt;{{cite web |author=Imperial War Museum|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/20211|title=Search the Collection;- ''Paths of Glory'' |year=|accessdate=3 February 2015|work=[[Imperial War Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCHistoryPaths&gt;{{cite web |author=Imperial War Museum|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/trail/wars_conflict/art/art_daily_life_04.shtml |title=''Paths of Glory'' by CRW Nevinson |date=4 April 2005|accessdate=3 February 2015|work=BBC History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Nevinson had served as a volunteer ambulance driver with the [[Friends' Ambulance Service]] on the Western Front in the early months of the First World War, from November 1914 to January 1915, and then returned to England.  He served as an orderly in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] in London but was invalided out in late 1915 due to [[rheumatic fever]]. During this period he painted several paintings such as ''[[La Mitrailleuse]]'' (1915) and ''The Doctor'' (1916).

He was commissioned as a [[war artist]] in 1917 and was sent to France by the British [[War Propaganda Bureau]].  He adopted a [[Realism (arts)|Realist]] style to depict the horror of the war, moved decisively away from his earlier [[Modernist]] and [[Vorticist]] styles.  

==Painting==
The painting measures {{convert|45.7|xx|60.9|cm|in}}. It depicts two dead British soldiers, face down in a battlefield on the Western Front.  They lie unburied in a muddy landscape that is bare save for barriers of barbed wire and the detritus of war.  

The painting was censored by the official censor of paintings and drawings in France, Lieutenant Colonel [[A N Lee]], on the grounds that displaying dead bodies would hinder the war effort. Nonetheless, Nevinson included the painting in his official exhibition at the [[Leicester Galleries]] in March 1918, but the work was displayed with a brown paper strip across the bodies bearing the word "censored".&lt;ref name="DBHcrisis"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[David Boyd Haycock]]|publisher=Old Street Publishing (London)|year=2009|title=A Crisis of Brilliance: Five Young British Artists and the Great War|ISBN=978-1-905847-84-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevinson was reprimanded by the [[War Office]] for exhibiting a censored image, and for using the word "censored" in public without authorisation, but obtained significant publicity, particularly as the first exhibition of official colour tinted photographs from the front (including images of actual dead bodies) opened on 4 March.  The painting was bought by the Imperial War Museum direct from the exhibition, as the work had been commissioned by the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]].

The same title was used for several books and the [[Paths of Glory|1957 war film]] directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]].

'''Performance studies''' is an interdisciplinary field that studies [[Performance (disambiguation)|performance]] and uses performance as a lens to study the world. The term 'performance' is broad, and can include artistic and aesthetic performances like concerts, theatrical events, and [[performance art]]; sporting events; social, political and religious events like rituals, ceremonies, proclamations and public decisions; certain kinds of language use; and those components of identity which require someone to do, rather than just be, something. Consequently, performance studies is interdisciplinary, drawing from theories of the performing arts, anthropology and sociology, literary theory, and legal studies.

Performance Studies has been challenged as an emerging discipline. Many academics have been critical of its instability. As an academic field it is difficult to pin down; either that is the nature of the field itself or it is still too young to tell. There are, however, numerous degree-granting programs that train researchers being offered by universities. Some have referred to it as an "inter discipline" or a "post discipline".&lt;ref&gt;Schechner, Richard. "Foreword: Fundamentals of Performance Studies," Nathan Stucky and Cynthia Wimmer, eds., ''Teaching Performance Studies,'' Southern Illinois University Press, 2002. P.x&lt;/ref&gt;

Performance Studies tends to concentrate on a mix of research methods. The application of practice-led or practice-based research methods has become a widespread phenomenon not just in the anglophone world. As such research projects integrate established methods like literature research and oral history with performance practice, i.e. artistic autoethnographic approaches and verbatim theatre. The documentation of ''Practice-as-Research in Performance'' (PARIP), a devoted research project conducted at the University of Bristol between 2001 and 2006, offers a number of inspiring articles and portraits of such research projects and was key for a breakthrough of using creative thinking within this subject field.&lt;ref&gt;Allegue, L., Jones, S., Kershaw, B., &amp; Piccini, A. (2009). Practice-as-Research in performance and screen. Basingstoke.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and basic concepts==

Richard Schechner author of ''Performance Studies: An Introduction'' states that Performance studies examine performances in two categories: Artistic and Cultural Performances. A. Artistic Performance are marked and understood as art. solo-performance, performance art, performance of literature, theatrical storytelling, plays, and performance poetry, This category considers performance as the art form. B. Cultural Performance includes events that occur in everyday life in which a culture values are displayed for their perpetuation: rituals such as parades, religious ceremonies, community festivals, controversial storytelling, and performances of social and professional roles, and individual performances of race, gender, sexuality and class. 

===Theatre and anthropology===
Performance Studies as an academic field has multiple origin narratives. On the theatrical and anthropological front, this origin is often regarded as the research collaborations of director [[Richard Schechner]] and anthropologist [[Victor Turner]]. This origin narrative emphasizes a definition of performance as being "between theatre and anthropology" and often stresses the importance of [[intercultural]] performances as an alternative to either traditional proscenium theatre or traditional anthropological fieldwork. [[Dwight Conquergood]] developed a branch of performance ethnography that centered the political nature of the practice and advocated for methodological dialogism from the point of encounter to the practices of research reporting. [[Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett]] has contributed an interest in tourist productions and ethnographic showmanship to the field, Judd Case has adapted performance to the study of media and religion,&lt;ref&gt;Case, J. A. "Sounds from the Center: Liriel's Performance and Ritual Pilgrimage" ''Journal of Media &amp; Religion'', October 2009, 209–225.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diana Taylor (professor)|Diana Taylor]] has brought a hemispheric perspective on Latin American performance and theorized the relationship between the [[archive]] and the performance repertoire, while Corinne Kratz developed a mode of performance analysis that emphasizes the role of multimedia communication in performance.&lt;ref&gt;Kratz, Corinne A. ''Affecting Performance: Meaning, Movement and Experience in Okiek Women's Initiation'', Smithsonian Institution Press, 1994 (new edition, Wheatmark 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Laurie Frederik argues for the importance of ethnographic research and a solid theoretical base in anthropological perspective.

===Literature===
On the literature front, Wallace Bacon (1914–2001), considered by many to be the father of performance theory, taught the performance of literature as the ultimate act of humility. In his defining statement of performance theory, "Our center is in the interaction between readers and texts which enriches, extends, clarifies, and (yes) alters the interior and even the exterior lives of students [and performers and audiences] through the power of texts" (''Literature in Performance'', Vol 5 No 1, 1984; p.&amp;nbsp;84). In addition, Robert Breen's text ''[[Chamber theatre|Chamber Theatre]]'' is a cornerstone in the field for staging narrative texts, though it remains controversial in its assertions about the place of narrative details in chamber productions. Breen is also regarded by many as a founding theorist for the discipline, along with advocate Louise Rosenblatt. More recently, performance theorist and novelist [[Barbara Browning]] has suggested that narrative fiction itself—and particularly the novel—demands the performative participation of the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Browning|first1=Barbara|title='Dear Reader': The Novel's Call to Perform|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1m4uWyRjvo|website=YouTube|publisher=The Book Lovers|accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speech-act theory and 'performatives'===
An alternative origin narrative stresses the development of [[J.L. Austin|speech-act theory]] by philosophers [[J.L. Austin]] and [[Judith Butler]], literary critic [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]], and also [[Shoshana Felman]]. The theory proposed by Austin in ''How To Do Things With Words''  states that "to say something ''is to do something'', or ''in'' saying something we do something, and even ''by'' saying something we do something".&lt;ref&gt;Austin, J. L. ''How To Do Things With Words''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1962. P. 94&lt;/ref&gt; the most illustrative example being "I do", as part of a marriage ceremony. For any of these performative utterances to be felicitous, per Austin, they must be true, appropriate and conventional according to those with the proper authority: a priest, a judge, or the scholar, for instance. Austin accounts for the infelicitous by noting that "there will always occur difficult or marginal cases where nothing in the previous history of a conventional procedure will decide conclusively whether such a procedure is or is not correctly applied to such a case".&lt;ref&gt;Austin, J. L. ''How To Do Things With Words''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1962. P. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of failure in performatives (utterances made with language and the body) is taken up by Butler and is understood as the "political promise of the performative".&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Judith. ''[[Excitable Speech : A Politics of the Performative]].'' New York: Routledge, 1997 P. 161&lt;/ref&gt; Her argument is that because the performative needs to maintain conventional power, convention itself has to be reiterated, and in this reiteration it can be expropriated by the unauthorized usage and thus create new futures. She cites Rosa Parks as an example:&lt;blockquote&gt;
When [[Rosa Parks]] sat in the front of the bus, she had no prior right to do so guaranteed by any…conventions of the South. And yet, in laying claim to the right for which she had no prior authorization, she endowed a certain authority on the act, and began the insurrectionary process of overthrowing those established codes of legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;''Excitable Speech : A Politics of the Performative.'' New York: Routledge, 1997 P. 147&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The question of the infelicitous  utterance (the misfire)is also taken up by Shoshana Felman when she states "Infelicity, or failure, is not for Austin an accident of the performative, it is inherent in it, essential to it. In other words…Austin conceives of failure not as external but as internal to the promise, as what actually constitutes it."&lt;ref&gt;Felman, Shoshana ''Scandal of the Speaking Body: Don Juan with J.L. Austin, or Seduction in Two Languages'' P. 45-46&lt;/ref&gt;

Performance studies has also had a strong relationship to the fields of feminism, [[psychoanalysis]], critical race theory and [[queer theory]]. Theorists like [[Peggy Phelan]],&lt;ref&gt;Phelan, Peggy. ''Unmarked: The Politics of Performance''. London; New York: Routledge, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; [[José Esteban Muñoz]],&lt;ref&gt;Muñoz, José Esteban. ''Disidentifications: Queers of Color and the Performance of Politics''. University of Minnesota Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; [[E. Patrick Johnson]],&lt;ref&gt;E. Patrick Johnson. Appropriating Blackness: Performance and the Politics of Authenticity. Duke University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Rebecca Schneider,&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, Rebecca. ''The Explicit Body in Performance''. London ; New York: Routledge, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[André Lepecki]] have been equally influential in both performance studies and these related fields.

==Academic programs==
Performance studies incorporates theories of [[drama]], [[dance]], [[art]], [[anthropology]], [[folkloristics]], [[philosophy]], [[cultural studies]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[comparative literature]], [[communication studies]], and increasingly, music performance.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g.
Nicholas Cook and Richard Pettengill (eds.), "Taking It to the Bridge. Music as Performance", University of Michigan Press, 2013; Nicholas Cook, "Between Process and Product: Music and/as Performance", in: [http://www.mtosmt.org/issues/mto.01.7.2/mto.01.7.2.cook.html "The Online Journal of the Society for Music Theory", Vol. 7, No. 2, April 2001]; Philip Auslander, "Music as Performance: Living in the Immaterial World," in: [http://lmc.gatech.edu/~auslander/publications/Auslander-Immaterial.pdf "Theatre Survey", Vol. 47, No. 4, Fall 2006]"; Melanie Fritsch and Stefan Strötgen, "Relatively Live: How to Identify Live Music Performances", in: [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.5406/musimoviimag.5.1.0047?uid=3737864&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103032208791 "Music and the Moving Image", Vol. 5 No. 1, 2012 (March), p. 47–66.]&lt;/ref&gt; More can be found out by reading Schechner's book: ''Performance Studies: An Introduction'' or in D. Soyini Madison and Judith Hamera's The Sage Handbook for Performance Studies.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, D. Soyini and Judith Hamera, eds. The Sage Handbook for Performance Studies. SAGE 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The first performance studies department was created at [[New York University|NYU]]. However, there is some debate that the joint-cradles of Performance Studies are [[Northwestern University]] and NYU. For more information on the different origins and disciplinary traditions of performance studies see Shannon Jackson's book ''Professing Performance'' and the introductory chapter in Nathan Stucky and Cynthia Wimmer's ''Teaching Performance Studies''.&lt;ref&gt;Stucky, Nathan and Cynthia Wimmer, eds. ''Teaching Performance Studies.'' Southern Illinois University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally the differences between the NYU and Northwestern models cite different disciplinary concerns. NYU is generally characterized as a program that pushed the definitions of theatrical practice influenced by the thearical avant-garde thus expanding its definition of what can be framed as an event. Interaction with departments that include [[New York University|NYU]]'s Postdoctoral Program in Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy have made this an ongoing pursuit. Northwestern transitioned from an elocution and performance of literature tradition to expand its definition of presentational aesthetics beyond oral interpretation. Northwestern's unique brand of performance studies has its origins in [[anthropology]], having been started by the ethnographer [[Dwight Conquergood]] with the goal of understanding all manner of local cultures through their performance practices. In both instances a focus on practice lead to a research methodology beyond theatre or literature/speech. In the United States, the interdisciplinary and multi-focus field has spread to [[Brown University|Brown]], [[University of California at Los Angeles|UCLA]], University of Northern Iowa, [[University of California at Irvine|UCI]],  [[University of California at Berkeley|UC Berkeley]], and elsewhere. Undergraduate and graduate programs are offered at [http://www.utexas.edu/finearts/tad/graduate-programs/performance-public-practice The University of Texas at Austin], [[University of California at Los Angeles|UCLA]]'s [http://www.wacd.ucla.edu/ Culture and Performance Program], [http://performancestudies.ucdavis.edu/ UC Davis], [http://drama.arts.uci.edu/graduate-programs/phd/phd-program/ UC Irvine], [[Kennesaw State University]], [[Louisiana State University]], [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]], [[California State University, Northridge]], [[San Jose State University]], [[University of San Diego]], [[University of Maryland]], the [[University of North Carolina Chapel Hill]], and [https://pad.artsci.wustl.edu/amprogram Washington University in St. Louis]. [[Texas A&amp;M University]]'s [http://performancestudies.tamu.edu/ Department of Performance Studies] is unique in including both Music and Theatre degree programs.

In the United Kingdom [[Aberystwyth University]] offers a degree scheme in performance studies with highly acclaimed performance artists such as Mike Pearson, Heike Roms and Jill Greenhalgh. The [[University of Roehampton]] in London offers a BA in Drama, Theatre and Performance Studies. [[Richmond University]], London also offers a BA in Performance and Theatre Arts. The University of Plymouth has offered a BA in Theatre &amp; Performance since the early 1990s; its postgraduate research programme (ResM and MPhil/PhD) specialises in performance studies. The [[University of Warwick]] also offers a BA in Theatre and Performance Studies, in addition to leading Postgraduate programmes.

In Denmark [[Roskilde University]] offers a master and ph.d. degree in "performance design", focusing on subjects such as theatrical performances, live music, festivals, and urban performances.

In Germany [[University of Hamburg]] offers a master program in performance studies at the centre for performance studies run by [[Gabriele Klein]]. The Centre for Performance Studies at the [[University of Bremen]] offers a certificate in performance studies focussing on the combination of academic and artistic research within performance projects.

In India, [[Jawaharlal Nehru University]] offers MPhil and PhD program in Theatre &amp; Performance Studies at the School of Arts &amp; Aesthetics. Since 2012, School of Culture and Creative Expressions, [[Ambedkar University Delhi]], started a MA program in Performance Studies, which focus on redefining methodologies of cultural studies and research on the basis of the nuances of performance studies. It is formulating the first Practice based PhD in the country and working extensively in the realm of Practice-as-Research. On the similar lines, the Centre for Performance Research and Cultural Studies in South Asia (CPRACSIS), Kerala have organised series of workshops and seminars over the last few years to engage scholars, artists and practitioners in conversation informed by Performance Studies.

In Australia, the [[University of Sydney]], [[Victoria University, Australia|Victoria University]] and [[Queensland University of Technology]] offer degrees majoring in performance studies, Honours, Masters and Phd. Performance Studies in some countries is also an A-level (AS and A2) course consisting of the integration of the discrete art forms of Dance, Music and Drama in performing arts.

In Brazil, The [[Universidade Federal de Goiás]], started an interdisciplinary program (masters) in Performances Culturais (Cultural Performances) in 2012, the first in a Latin country. The goal of this program is to analyze "rituals, games, performances, drama, dance" from a cross-cultural point of view.

[[Image:ProofRefute.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Cover of ''Proofs and Refutations'' by [[Imre Lakatos]].]]
'''''Proofs and Refutations''''' is a 1976 book by philosopher [[Imre Lakatos]] expounding his view of the progress of [[mathematics]]. The book is written as a series of [[Socratic dialogue]]s involving a group of students who debate the proof of the [[Euler characteristic]] defined for the [[polyhedron]]. A central theme is that [[definition]]s are not carved in stone, but often have to be patched up in the light of later insights, in particular failed [[Mathematical proof|proof]]s. This gives mathematics a somewhat experimental flavour. At the end of the Introduction, Lakatos explains that his purpose is to challenge [[formalism (mathematics)|formalism in mathematics]], and to show that [[informal mathematics]] grows by a logic of "proofs and refutations".

==Synopsis==
Many important logical ideas are explained in the book. For example, the difference between a [[counterexample]] to a [[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] (a so-called 'local counterexample') and a counterexample to the specific conjecture under attack (a 'global counterexample' to the Euler characteristic, in this case) is discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lakatos|1976|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lakatos argues for a different kind of textbook, one that uses heuristic style. To the critics that say such a textbook would be too long, he replies: 'The answer to this pedestrian argument is: let us try.'

The book includes two appendices.  In the first, Lakatos gives examples of the heuristic process in mathematical discovery.  In the second, he contrasts the deductivist and heuristic approaches and provides heuristic analysis of some 'proof generated' concepts, including [[uniform convergence]], [[bounded variation]], and the [[Outer measure|Carathéodory definition]] of a measurable set.

The pupils in the book are named after letters of the Greek alphabet.

== Method ==

Though the book is written as a narrative, an actual method of investigation, that of "proofs and refutations", is developed. In Appendix I, Lakatos summarizes this method by the following list of stages:

# Primitive conjecture.
# Proof (a rough thought-experiment or argument, decomposing the primitive conjecture into subconjectures).
# "Global" counterexamples (counterexamples to the primitive conjecture) emerge.
# Proof re-examined: the "guilty lemma" to which the global counter-example is a "local" counterexample is spotted. This guilty lemma may have previously remained "hidden" or may have been misidentified. Now it is made explicit, and built into the primitive conjecture as a condition. The theorem - the improved conjecture - supersedes the primitive conjecture with the new proof-generated concept as its paramount new feature.

He goes on and gives further stages that might sometimes take place:

&lt;ol start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proofs of other theorems are examined to see if the newly found lemma or the new proof-generated concept occurs in them: this concept may be found lying at cross-roads of different proofs, and thus emerge as of basic importance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hitherto accepted consequences of the original and now refuted conjecture are checked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Counterexamples are turned into new examples - new fields of inquiry open up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

==Publication history==
The 1976 book has been translated into more than 15 languages worldwide, including Chinese, Korean, Serbo-Croat and Turkish, and went into its second Chinese edition in 2007.

==Impact on teaching==
A number of mathematics teachers have implemented Lakatos' method of proofs and refutations in the classroom, when teaching other mathematical topics.&lt;ref&gt;Fatih Karakus &amp; Mesut Bütün; ''Examining the Method of Proofs and Refutations in Pre-Service Teachers Education'', Bolema vol. 27 no.45 Rio Claro Apr. 2013.[http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0103-636X2013000100011&amp;script=sci_arttext]&lt;/ref&gt; The method has been applied to the analysis and presentation  of problem  solving in mechanics
by high school to college level students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lakatosian Monsters|url=http://harveycohen.net/dragons/Lakatosian_Monsters.htm|accessdate= 18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal Drawing School''' is an educational organisation and [[Charitable organization#Charity registration|registered charity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|1101538}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[London Borough of Hackney]] in [[England]]. It was founded in 2000 by the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] as '''The Prince's Drawing School''' and received its current name in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Knox|first1=James|title=Royal Drawing School receives official title from The Queen|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Royal-Drawing-School-receives-official-title-from-The-Queen/36287|accessdate=19 November 2014|work=[[The Art Newspaper]]|date=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of the Royal Drawing School is to raise the standard and profile of drawing through teaching and practice. It is one of only a few institutions in the world offering in-depth, quality tuition for those who wish to develop their observational drawing skills.

As well as a Postgraduate Programme, the School runs a broad range of affordable courses designed for both professional artists and other interested adults, including master classes in the life room, in museums and galleries and in the streets and parks of [[London]]. Drawing instruction is delivered by distinguished artists and teachers from leading institutions including the [[Royal Academy Schools]], [[Central Saint Martins]], the [[Royal College of Art]] and the [[Slade School of Fine Art|Slade]]. Over 3,000 students have attended classes since 2000; there are over 130 alumni of the Postgraduate Programme.{{Update inline|date=August 2018}} The School, founded by the Prince of Wales, is based on the top floor of a converted warehouse in [[Shoreditch]], an area rich in galleries and design studios.

The School also aims to make it possible for every child with an aptitude for drawing to achieve their potential. The School provides serious, sustained tuition and mentoring, for children aged 10–14, from all backgrounds, through affordable programmes which are provided when and where it works for students.

The Royal Drawing School is part of [[The Prince's Charities]], a group of not-for-profit organizations of which the Prince of Wales is President: 17 of the 19 charities were founded personally by the Prince.

In 2006, The Prince's Drawing School received a donation of £85,000 from [[The Prince's Charities Foundation]].

In 2018, works created by The Royal Drawing School and two other charities founded by Prince Charles were put on display during the Prince &amp; Patron exhibition to mark his 70th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/themes/exhibitions/prince-patron/buckingham-palace|title=Prince &amp; Patron|publisher=Royal Collection Trust|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/prince-patron-exhibition-unveiled-buckingham-palace|title=Prince &amp; Patron exhibition unveiled at Buckingham Palace|publisher=The Prince of Wales|date=20 July 2018|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sites and collaborations ==
The Royal Drawing School has five campuses across London; in Shoreditch, [[Oxford Street]], South Kensington and Trinity Buoy Wharf. The School also collaborates with a number of institutions including [[National Gallery|The National Gallery]], [[British Museum|The British Museum]], [[Royal Academy of Arts]], [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]], [[Victoria and Albert Museum|V&amp;A]] and the [[Saatchi Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://royaldrawingschool.org/about/facilities/|title=Facilities {{!}} The Royal Drawing School|website=The Royal Drawing School|access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://royaldrawingschool.org/about/educational-partners/|title=Educational Partners {{!}} The Royal Drawing School|website=The Royal Drawing School|access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saul Yaffie''', {{aka}} '''Paul Jeffay''', (1898–1957) was a Scottish Jewish artist.

== Early life ==
Saul Yaffie was born in Blythswood, [[Glasgow]] on 29 April 1898. His mother was Kate Yaffie (née Karkinofski), and his father, Bernard Yaffie, was a master tailor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yaffie, Saul|url=http://www.gsaarchives.net/archon/index.php?p=core/search&amp;subjectid=677|website=Archives and Collections: Glasgow School of Art|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like many Russian Jews, Kate and Bernard Yaffie fled persecution in Russia during a wave of anti-Jewish pogroms triggered by the assassination of [[Tsar Alexander II]] in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Jewish community in Scotland|url=http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/higherscottishhistory/migrationandempire/experienceofimmigrants/jewish.asp|website=Education Scotland|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saul's father was naturalised as a British citizen by the time that Saul himself was three; a Bernard Yaffie is recorded as living at Abbortsford Place in the old [[Gorbals]], where the young Saul spent the early years of his childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Census|url=http://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk/|website=Scotland's People|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yaffies were not unique in their situation: the Gorbals was the centre of Scotland's Jewish community and home to a large proportion of Glasgow's immigrants throughout the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Jewish community in Scotland|url=http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/higherscottishhistory/migrationandempire/experienceofimmigrants/jewish.asp|website=Education Scotland|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, there was a movement to some of the more affluent communities in Glasgow, such as [[Pollokshields]] and [[Garnethill]], as many Jewish families gradually improved their social and economic situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Jewish community in Scotland|url=http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/higherscottishhistory/migrationandempire/experienceofimmigrants/jewish.asp|website=Education Scotland|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like these, the Yaffies also experienced a time of good fortune, moving to a more agreeable address on Sinclair Drive, [[Cathcart]] as Bernard's tailoring business prospered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Census|url=http://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk/|website=Scotland's People|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education and military service ==
Saul attended day classes in drawing and painting, modelling, and life drawing at [[Glasgow School of Art|The Glasgow School of Art]] from 1912 to 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yaffie, Saul|url=http://www.gsaarchives.net/archon/index.php?p=core/search&amp;subjectid=677|website=Archives and Collections: Glasgow School of Art|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[World War I|First World War]], he was required to interrupt his studies to serve in the King's Own Scottish Borderers in 1916/17. Although subject to military conscription, Yaffie reached the rank of corporal during his service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yaffie, Saul|url=http://www.gsaarchives.net/archon/index.php?p=core/search&amp;subjectid=677|website=Archives and Collections: Glasgow School of Art|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to his conscription Yaffie engaged in munitions work, something that was recorded in the GSA's student registers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yaffie, Saul|url=http://www.gsaarchives.net/archon/index.php?p=core/search&amp;subjectid=677|website=Archives and Collections: Glasgow School of Art|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life ==
The post-war economic depression that affected the country during the 1920s, also affected the Yaffie family directly: Bernard Yaffie's business suffered greatly, and the family eventually emigrated to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yaffie, Saul|url=http://www.gsaarchives.net/archon/index.php?p=core/search&amp;subjectid=677|website=Archives and Collections: Glasgow School of Art|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saul did not emigrate with his family, choosing instead to stay in Europe, and relocate to [[Paris]] where he continued his artistic practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yaffie, Saul|url=http://www.gsaarchives.net/archon/index.php?p=core/search&amp;subjectid=677|website=Archives and Collections: Glasgow School of Art|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now married, Saul sought to escape persecution in Europe by returning to the UK before the [[World War II|Second World War]] with his wife, Estusia. The two settled in Manchester, but returned to France after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yaffie, Saul|url=http://www.gsaarchives.net/archon/index.php?p=core/search&amp;subjectid=677|website=Archives and Collections: Glasgow School of Art|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death and legacy ==
Saul Yaffie is listed in the Glasgow School of Art's World War One Roll of Honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roll of Honour|url=http://www.gsaarchives.net/archon/index.php?p=collections/findingaid&amp;id=462&amp;rootcontentid=16306&amp;q=roll+of+honour#id16306|website=Archives and Collections: Glasgow School of Art|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later went by the name Paul Jeffay, and much of his work is signed under this name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Family History|url=http://www.sjac.org.uk/collections/family-history-genealogy/|website=Scottish Jewish Archives Centre|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saul Yaffie/Paul Jeffay died in Paris in 1957; his work is included the [[Ben Uri Gallery]]'s Collection of Jewish émigré artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Collection: Paul Jeffay|url=http://www.benuri.org.uk/public/?collection-details=1399|website=Ben Uri|publisher=Ben Uri Galleri|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''School of the Art Institute of Chicago''' ('''SAIC''') is one of America's largest accredited independent schools of art and design. It is located in the [[Chicago Loop|Loop]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. The school is associated with [[The Art Institute of Chicago|the museum of the same name]], and "The Art Institute of Chicago" or "Chicago Art Institute" often refers to either entity. Providing degrees at the undergraduate and graduate levels, SAIC has been recognized by ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' as one of the top graduate art programs in the nation, as well as by [[Columbia University]]'s National Arts Journalism survey as the most influential art school in the United States.

[[File:School of the Art Institute Chicago Grant Park.JPG|thumb|300px|The school's [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]], Columbus Avenue, building, attached to the museum, houses a premier gallery showcase.]]

Tracing its history to an art students' cooperative founded in 1866, which grew into the museum and school, SAIC has been accredited since 1936 by the [[Higher Learning Commission]], by the [[National Association of Schools of Art and Design]] since 1944 (charter member), and by the [[Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design]] (AICAD) since its founding in 1991. Additionally it is accredited by the [[National Architectural Accrediting Board]].

Its downtown Chicago campus consists of seven buildings located in the immediate vicinity of the [[Art Institute of Chicago Building|AIC building]]. SAIC is in an equal partnership with the AIC and share many administrative resources such as design, construction, and human resources. The campus, located in [[Chicago Loop|the Loop]], comprises chiefly three buildings: the Michigan (112 S. Michigan Ave.), the Sharp (37 S. Wabash Ave.), and the Columbus (280 S. Columbus Dr.). SAIC also owns additional buildings throughout Chicago that are used as student galleries or investments.

== History ==
The institute has its roots in the 1866 founding of the '''Chicago Academy of Design''', which local artists established in rented rooms on Clark Street.  It was financed by member dues and patron donations. Four years later, the school moved into its own Adams Street building, which was destroyed in the [[Great Chicago Fire of 1871]].

Because of the school's financial and managerial problems after this loss, business leaders in 1878 formed a [[Board of directors|board of trustees]] and founded the '''Chicago Academy of Fine Arts'''.  They expanded its mission beyond education and exhibitions to include collecting. In 1882, the academy was renamed the '''Art Institute of Chicago'''.  The banker [[Charles L. Hutchinson]] served as its elected president until his death in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, Diane. [http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/79.html "Art Institute of Chicago"], ''Encyclopedia of Chicago''&lt;/ref&gt;

Chancellor [[Walter E. Massey]] served as president from 2010–July 2016. The current president is [[Elissa Tenny]], formerly the school's provost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saic.edu/press/saic-names-elissa-tenny-president-succeed-walter-massey-effective-july-1-2016|title=SAIC Names Elissa Tenny President to Succeed Walter Massey, Effective July 1, 2016|author=|date=|website=saic.edu|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

===Visiting Artists Program===
Founded in 1868, the '''Visiting Artists Program (VAP)''' is one of the oldest public programs of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Formalized in 1951 by Flora Mayer Witkowsky's endowment of a supporting fund, the Visiting Artists Program hosts public presentations by artists, designers, and scholars each year in lectures, symposia, performances, and screenings. It is an eclectic program that showcases artists' working in all media, including sound, video, performance, poetry, painting, and independent film; in addition to significant curators, critics, and art historians.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

Recent visiting artists have included [[Catherine Opie]], [[Andi Zeisler]], [[Aaron Koblin]], [[Jean Shin]], [[Sam Lipsyte]], [[Ben Marcus]], [[Marilyn Minter]], [[Pearl Fryar]], [[Tehching Hsieh]], [[Homi K. Bhabha]], [[Bill Fontana]], [[Wolfgang Laib]], [[Suzanne Lee]], and [[Amar Kanwar]] among others.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

Additionally, the Distinguished Alumni Series brings alumni back to the community to present their work and reflect on how their experiences at SAIC have shaped them. Recent alumni speakers include [[Tania Bruguera]], Jenni Sorkin, Kori Newkirk, [[Maria Martinez-Cañas]], [[Saya Woolfalk]], [[Jun Nguyen-Hatsushiba]], and [[Sanford Biggers]] to name a few.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

===Galleries===
*'''Sullivan Galleries'''- Located to the 7th floor of the Sullivan Center at 33 S. State Street. With shows and projects often led by faculty or student curators, it is a teaching gallery that engages the exhibition process as a pedagogical model and mode of research.
*'''SITE Galleries (formerly Student Union Galleries)''' - Founded in 1994, SITE, once known as the Student Union Galleries (SUGs), is a ''student-run'' organization at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) for the exhibition of ''student work''. The two central tenets of the galleries are to build relationships between different departments and stakeholders throughout the institution and strengthen our role as a teaching gallery within and beyond SAIC. This is accomplished first through providing a consistent space for undergraduate and graduate directors to organize and generate exhibitions that realize the vision of student artists. Furthermore, with strategic programming, SITE supports these exhibitions and engages evolving currents and discourses in our communities. The student-led structure provides opportunities for emerging artists and scholars to explore artistic and administrative methods by placing emphasis on collaborative processes and professional practice in and out of the classroom. They have two locations: The SITE Sharp of the 37 South Wabash Avenue building; and SITE Columbus of the 280 South Columbus Drive building. The two locations allow the galleries to cycle two shows simultaneously.  

===Student organizations===

==== ExTV ====
ExTV is a student-run time-arts platform that broadcasts online and on campus. Its broadcasts are available via monitors located throughout the 112 S. Michigan building, the 37 S Wabash building, and the 280 S. Columbus building. It is available on campus and off campus at extvsaic.org and on cantv.

====''F Newsmagazine''====
''F Newsmagazine'' is a student-run newspaper with both paid and volunteer positions. The magazine is a monthly publication with a run of 12,000 copies. Copies are distributed throughout the city, mainly at locations frequented by students such as popular diners and movie theaters.

====Free Radio SAIC====
Free Radio SAIC is the student-run Internet radio station of The School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Free Radio uses an open programming format and encourage its DJs to explore and experiment with the medium of live radio. Program content and style vary but generally include music from all genres, sound art, narratives, live performances, current events and interviews. [http://freeradiosaic.org]

Featured bands and guests on Free Radio SAIC include [[Nü Sensae]], [[The Black Belles]], Thomas Comerford, [[Kevin Michael Richardson]], [[Jeff Bennett]], [[Carolyn Lawrence]], and much more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://freeradiosaic.org/shows/babewave/ |title=Babe Wave – freeradiosaic |publisher=Freeradiosaic.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141117112519/http://freeradiosaic.org/shows/babewave/ |archivedate=2014-11-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tarun on August 22, 2011 |url=http://freeradiosaic.org/shows/cartoons-on-the-radio/ |title=Cartoons On The Radio – freeradiosaic |publisher=Freeradiosaic.org |date=2011-08-22 |accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=andy on November 1, 2011 |url=http://freeradiosaic.org/shows/interviews-with-people/ |title=Interview With Thomas Comerford – freeradiosaic |publisher=Freeradiosaic.org |date=2011-11-01 |accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Student government====
The student government of SAIC is unique in that its constitution resembles a socialist republic, in which four officers hold equal power and responsibility. Elections are held every year. There are no campaign requirements. Any group of four students may run for office, but there must always be four students.

The student government is responsible for hosting a school-wide student meeting once a month. At these meetings students discuss school concerns of any nature. The predominant topic is funding for the various student organizations. Organizations which desire funding must present a proposal at the meeting by which the students vote whether they should receive monies or not. The student government cannot participate in the vote: only oversee it.

The student government is also responsible for the distribution of the Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly Fund, Welcome Back to School Party, Monthly Morning Coffees, Open Forums, Barbecues in the Pit (the outdoor area at the entrance of the 280 S Columbus Building), Holiday Art Sale, and a Materials Event. In the past Student Government has accomplished such things as campus-wide recycling, and access to the [[Chicago Transit Authority]]'s [[Universal Transit Pass|U-Pass]].

== Ranking ==
In a survey conducted by the National Arts Journalism Program at Columbia University, SAIC was named the “most influential art school” by art critics at general interest news publications from across the United States.&lt;ref name="Columbia_2002"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Visual Art Critic | url =http://www.najp.org/publications/researchreports/tvac.pdf | publisher = Columbia University National Arts Journalism Program | accessdate = 2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==

=== ''Mirth &amp; Girth'' ===
{{Main|Mirth &amp; Girth}}
On May 11,&amp;nbsp;1988, a student painting depicting [[Harold Washington]], the first black mayor of Chicago, was torn down by some of the city's African-American [[Chicago City Council|aldermen]] — over the protests of many who attempted to block them — based on its content. The painting, titled ''Mirth &amp; Girth'' by David Nelson, was of Washington clad only in women's underwear holding a pencil.&lt;ref name="sneed_19880704"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB36DE58EA8BDAC&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |author=Sneed, Michael |title=Untitled |publisher=Chicago Sun-Times |date=1988-07-04 |accessdate=2008-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Washington died on November 25,&amp;nbsp;1987.

The painting was returned after a day, and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) filed a lawsuit against the Chicago Police Department and the aldermen. The ACLU claimed the removal violated Nelson's First, Fourth, and Fourteenth amendment rights.  Nelson ended up receiving a monetary settlement for damage to the painting which occurred during its confiscation.&lt;ref name="Dubin 1992"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dubin | first = Steven | title = Arresting Images, Impolitic Art and Uncivil Actions | publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 1992 | isbn = 0-415-90893-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''What Is the Proper Way to Display a U.S. Flag?'' ===

In February&amp;nbsp;1989, a student named "Dread" Scott Tyler draped the [[Flag of the United States]] across the floor&lt;!-- United States Flag Code --&gt; for a piece titled ''What Is the Proper Way to Display a U.S. Flag?'' The piece consisted of a podium with a notebook for viewers to express how they felt about the exhibit. However, the podium was set upon a flag laid on the floor. In order for viewers to write in the notebook, they would have to walk on the flag. Viewers were occasionally arrested at the request of veterans.&lt;ref name="Dubin 1992"/&gt; The school stood by the student's art in the face of protests and threats. That year, the school's federal funding was cut from $70,000 to $1 and many benefactors pulled donations.{{citation needed|date = February 2013}}

===Academic Freedom controversy===
In 2017, a controversy arose over the resignation of [[Michael Bonesteel]], an [[Professors_in_the_United_States#Adjunct_professor|adjunct professor]] specializing in outsider art and comics after two Title IX complaints were filed. Bonesteel described the SAIC investigation as a "Kafkaesque trial" in which he was never shown copies of the complaints and in which he was guilty until proven innocent and that SAIC "feels more like a police state than a place where academic freedom and the open exchange of ideas is valued".&lt;ref name=TensionsintheArtClassroom&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/07/24/debate-over-art-teaching-and-prejudice-school-art-institute-chicago |title=Tensions in the Art Classroom |last=Roll |first=Nick |date=July  24, 2017 |website=Inside Higher Ed}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laura Kipnis]], author of [[Unwanted Advances: Sexual Paranoia Comes to Campus|a book]] on Title IX cases, described SAIC as displaying "jawdropping cowardice" and said "The idea that students are trying to censor or curb a professor’s opinions or thinking is appalling".  &lt;ref&gt;Jori Finkel, "Art school under fire for bowing to transgender student complaints", ''The Art Newspaper'', 18 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Bartlett, "The Offender", ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', August 10, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  The School said the claims made against it were "problematic" and "misleading" and said it supports [[academic freedom]].&lt;ref name="TensionsintheArtClassroom" /&gt;

[[Image:RomeForumRomanumArchofSeptimiusSeverus01.jpg|thumb|300px|Rome, [[Arch of Septimus Severus]]]]
'''Severan art''' is art production by the [[Roman Empire]] under the [[Severan dynasty]], usually taken as running from 193 to 235, through the emperors [[Septimius Severus]], [[Caracalla]], [[Elagabalus|Heliogabalus]] and [[Alexander Severus]]. Official Roman art of the military anarchy which followed, ending in 253 with [[Gallienus]], has no character of its own and so can be seen as a continuation of Severan art, and so that art can be seen as running for the whole first half of the 3rd century.

In this period began the process that ended in the rupture between Roman art and that of [[Late Antiquity]], the watershed between classical art and that of  [[Byzantine art|Byzantium]] and [[medieval art|the Middle Ages]]. Some of Severan art's products saw the emergence of obvious elements from [[plebeian art]] and [[Roman provincial art|provincial art]], whilst in other areas traditionally [[Hellenistic]] elements were kept alive longer, such as in portraiture, which flourished in this period with masterpieces of great psychological depth.

The '''Society of American Graphic Artists''' (SAGA) is a [[not for profit]] national fine arts organization serving professional artists in the field of [[printmaking]]. SAGA provides its members with exhibition, reviews and networking opportunities in the New York City area&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sagaprints.org/articles/17 Dr. Glenn F. Benge, "Hands On,An Exhibition of Hand-Pulled, Non-Digital Prints"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129002750/http://sagaprints.org/articles/17 |date=2013-01-29 }} Journal of the Print World, (April 2012): 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt; and, in addition to various substantial exhibition prizes, many purchase awards allow SAGA members to be included in major U.S. museum collections.

The origins of the organization date back to 1915 with the formation of the Brooklyn Society of Etchers.&lt;ref name="WP American print clubs"&gt;[[American print clubs]]&lt;/ref&gt; After several name changes, the present title was adopted in 1952 to allow for the inclusion of a full range of hand pulled printmaking techniques. Over the course of its close to 100 years of continuous operation, many important national and international modern artists have exhibited with SAGA, including [[Henri Matisse]], [[Kathe Kollowitz]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Mary Cassatt]], [[Joseph Pennell]], [[John Marin]], [[Childe Hassam]] and [[John Taylor Arms]]. SAGA continues to attract a diverse group of contemporary printmakers who serve as important contributors to and ambassadors of printmaking in the United States. SAGA also maintains a collector print collection of member work and publishes a periodical journal of writing on printmaking-related topics, which is entitled SAGAzine. SAGA’s current offices are at the former New York studio of John Sloan.

==History==
SAGA has been active since its inception in 1915 under the name of the Brooklyn Society of Etchers, and has organized over 79 National Member Exhibitions, in addition to various international, traveling and exchange exhibitions.&lt;ref name="WP American print clubs"/&gt;

In relation to other artists’ associations of the time, SAGA was modeled more closely to the French impressionist group (Cooperative Society of Painters, Sculptors, Engravers, etc.) which was focused on organizing exhibitions for its members, rather than other printmaking organizations such as the [[The Etching Club|British Etching Club]] or the French Society of Etchers ([[Societe des Aquafortistes]]) which were highly selective and secretive with very few members or focused more on commercial promotions, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Evan Lindquist, “The SAGA Website,” SAGAzine (Winter 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;   

With the advent of artists’ societies and clubs in the United States in the latter part of the 19th century, the New York Etching Club founded in 1877 gave way to establishment of the Brooklyn Society of Etchers which was organized 22 years after its disbandment. Founding members included Troy Kinney, Eugene Higgins, Fred Reynolds, Paul Roche, and Ernest Roth. Approximately 200 etchings by sixty-five artists including John Taylor Arms, Frank W. Benson, Mary Cassatt, Childe Hassam, John Marin, and Mahonri Young where exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum as part of the organization’s inaugural exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/exhibitions/1285/Brooklyn_Society_of_Etchers:_Annual_Exhibition_%7C03rd Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn Society of Etchers: Annual Exhibition 03rd]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Brooklyn Society of Etchers 3rd Annual Exhibition." Brooklyn Museum. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, NY 11238. January 1919.&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization continued to grow aggressively during the first fifteen years of its existence with both the membership and number of prints exhibited at the annual exhibitions tripling. The first international exhibition was organized at the Anderson Galleries in New York in 1922, including works by several major European and American artists such as Mary Cassatt, Ernest Haskell, Childe Hassam, Edward Hopper, Wilhelm Lembrook, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Camille Pissarro, and John Sloan. 

The organization decided to rename to the Society of American Etchers, Inc. since membership had grown to include many other geographic areas beyond Brooklyn, and the exhibitions were moved from the Brooklyn Museum to the National Arts Club in New York. Membership grew to include important printmakers of the 1930s including Isabelle Bishop, Mina Citron, Kenneth Hayes, Stanley William Hayter, John Sloan and Reginald Marsh. Further, it was during this time that exhibit exchanges with European print clubs were organized. 

In 1947, the society organized the largest show in its history, a collection of over 650 prints at the National Academy. Since many of these prints utilized techniques such as woodcut, wood engraving, and lithography, the organization was renamed to the Society of American Etchers, Gravers, Lithographers, and Woodcutters, Inc. and then again to its current designation the Society of American Graphic Artists in 1952.

With the ever changing climate of visual arts, printmaking has also undergone changes from the birth of non-objectivity, to surrealism, abstraction and beyond. A study of the catalogues of SAGA's exhibitions reflects these changes but it also shows SAGA's openness to all styles. In this respect the society has always followed the precept of its longtime president from 1931 to 1952, John Taylor Arms, who felt that SAGA should represent all techniques and styles in order to represent a true cross section of contemporary printmaking.

==Notable past and present members==

== Films ==
{{main|List of films featuring eclipses}}
There is a body of films featuring [[solar eclipse]]s. Compared to other astronomical events featured in films, such as [[full moon]]s and [[asteroid]] strikes, solar eclipses are less commonly seen. When they have featured in films, they often drive the plot and have a portentous presence.&lt;ref name="hickman"&gt;{{cite news | last=Hickman | first=Matt | url=https://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/blogs/movies-solar-eclipses-starring-role | title=9 movies starring solar eclipses | work=MNN | publisher=[[Mother Nature Network]] | date=August 8, 2017 | accessdate=September 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NPR]]'s Glen Weldon said that films use eclipses "to signal to audiences that the normal rules have temporarily lifted, and things are about to get weird." The first film to feature a solar eclipse was the 1907 silent film ''[[The Eclipse, or the Courtship of the Sun and Moon]]'', which featured a solar eclipse as a fantastical consummation between the sun and the moon.&lt;ref name="weldon"&gt;{{cite news | last=Weldon | first=Glen | url=https://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2017/08/17/543962064/in-movies-a-solar-eclipse-means-change-is-coming | title=In Movies, A Solar Eclipse Means Change Is Coming | work=npr.org | publisher=[[NPR]] | date=August 17, 2017 | accessdate=September 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eclipses have been seen as bad omens throughout history and filmmakers leverage that belief "as visual cues or key plot points", according to ''[[The Oregonian]]''{{'}}s Amy Wang.&lt;ref name="wang"&gt;{{cite news | last=Wang | first=Amy | url=http://www.oregonlive.com/eclipse/2017/08/15_movies_where_eclipses_play.html | title=15 movies that include eclipses (not always accurately) | work=[[The Oregonian]] | date=August 6, 2017 | accessdate=September 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most accurate depiction of a solar eclipse in film is seen in the 1961 religious epic film ''[[Barabbas (1961 film)|Barabbas]]'', which included film of an actual solar eclipse during a crucifixion scene.&lt;ref name="white"&gt;{{cite news | last=White | first=Amy | url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/8/18/16158544/solar-eclipses-science-fiction | title=Solar eclipses have been a science fiction theme for thousands of years | work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] | date=August 18, 2017 | accessdate=September 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1984 eclipse and ''Witness'' ===
While director [[Peter Weir]] was filming ''[[Witness (1985 film)|Witness]]'' (1985) in the [[Amish]] region of Pennsylvania, a solar eclipse occurred on [[Solar eclipse of May 30, 1984|May 30, 1984]]. Weir filmed several of his actors in costume, responding to the eclipse, with the vague intention of revising the film's plot to include a solar eclipse.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The eclipse footage was not included in the final edit.

== Television ==

* In one of his cartoons, [[Bugs Bunny]] accidentally travels through time to the [[Middle Ages]].  While there, he tricks everyone into believing that he has put out the sun with a spell. This was a parody of and homage to [[Mark Twain]]'s novel, ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]''.
* In an episode of ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'', the titular character accidentally travels to the Middle Ages and is about to be executed as a [[warlock]] when he remembers that his execution is timed exactly with an eclipse. He threatens everyone that he will black out the sun unless released and begins to speak [[gibberish]], pretending to put a spell on the sun. However, he has misread the date of the solar eclipse by one day, and stands on the gallows for 24 hours, continuing the gibberish until the eclipse happens.
* In the 1993 first season of ''[[Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers]]'', evil witch [[Rita Repulsa]] causes a solar eclipse to drain the [[Megazord]]'s power in the five-part episode, "[[Green With Evil]]".

* In the 2007 ''[[Avatar: the Last Airbender]]'' episode, "[[Avatar: The Last Airbender (season 3)|The Day of Black Sun Part 2: The Eclipse]]", [[Aang]] and his allies plan for the day of the invasion of the [[Fire Nation]] capital on the day a solar eclipse would occur, leaving the firebenders without firebending for about 8 minutes. The plan was expected to end the [[Avatar: The Last Airbender#Plot synopsis|war]]. The plan fails because [[Azula]], the princess of the Fire Nation, learns of the upcoming invasion beforehand.
* The 2007 Sci-Fi channel [[miniseries]] ''[[Tin Man (TV miniseries)|Tin Man]]'' is centered on a "double eclipse" which will give power to one of the two princesses of the O.Z.

Robert Frobisher-Smythe, who is central to the series' backstory, has been cursed by Anubis in this manner.  As an eclipse approaches, an attempt is made to re-awaken Robert.  One of the people who performs the ceremony, Caroline Denby, is impure of heart and causes Robert to be re-awoken evil.
* Episode 61 "[[List of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood episodes|He Who Would Swallow God]]" in the anime series ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood]]'' empowered stone fragments are activated by the eclipse's umbra.

{{Frankfurt School}}
'''''The Aesthetic Dimension: Toward a Critique of Marxist Aesthetics''''' ({{lang-de|Die Permanenz der Kunst: Wider eine bestimmte marxistische Ästhetik}}) is a 1977 book on [[aesthetics]] by the philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]], in which the author provides an account of [[modern art]]'s political implications and relationship with society at large.

It is the final major work by Marcuse, a founding member of the [[Frankfurt School]]. The book is also noteworthy as a demarcation of Marcuse's split with [[Marxism]] via his rejection of [[Marxist aesthetics]].

==Summary==
''The Aesthetic Dimension'' (not to be confused with a chapter from Marcuse's ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'' of the same name) is a response to previous writings within [[critical theory]] on the subject of art, notably those of [[Walter Benjamin]] and [[Theodor Adorno]]. Marcuse rejected Benjamin's call in "[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]" for the politicization (i.e., a literal reflection of perceived political realities) of modern, reproducible art both to reflect the state of a society and to incite change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC15folder/WalterBenjamin.html|title=Benjamin's '...Age of Mechanical Reproduction'|author=Richard Kazis|publisher=''Jump Cut''|accessdate=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like both Benjamin and Adorno, Marcuse believed that art promises resistance to societal repression, and that a cultural revolution is necessarily connected to a political or social revolution. Adorno (as represented mainly by his posthumous ''[[Aesthetic Theory]]'') and Marcuse agreed that this possibility must be realized through artistic detachment and symbolism.  Marcuse however offered a more inclusive and less radical suggestion for modern art's source of power than did Adorno, who believed that the works of [[high culture]] were the sole artistic source of potential emancipation.

Marcuse instead pointed to what he perceived to be the successes of high culture and translated these to all areas of art. For Marcuse, art's promise of transcendence could only be fulfilled via a conceptual independence from society, but this independence is accessible through a host of media. The successful artist will attain ''truth'' in his work through ''detachment'' that results in ''symbolic representation.'' This successful art must necessarily invoke a longing for something utopian and the promise of ultimate happiness represented by beauty. This symbolic longing for fulfillment will awaken us from complacency.&lt;ref name="questiaschool.com"&gt;http://www.questiaschool.com/read/82289404  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712013858/http://www.questiaschool.com/read/82289404 |date=July 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcuse stated in the book's introduction that he considered [[literature]] the primary source of his influence for this system, but feels that the ideas would apply to [[music]] and [[plastic arts]] as well.&lt;ref name="questiaschool.com"/&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''The Mosuo Sisters''''' is a 2012 [[documentary film]] written and directed by [[Marlo Poras]]. It chronicles the lives of two sisters, Jua Ma and La Tsuo, who are members of one of the last [[Matriarchy|matriarchal societies]], the [[Mosuo]] tribe. Being an ethnic minority in China, the film explores their journey from working at a bar in [[Beijing]] to moving back home to their village in the Himalayas, dealing with the modern world impinging upon the traditional Mosuo culture and way of life.

==Synopsis==
The filmmakers followed Jua Ma and La Tsuo for over two years, chronicling their lives as they moved back home and back to their culture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.libertasfilmmagazine.com/economic-inequality-in-china-lfm-reviews-the-mosuo-sisters-doc-nyc/&lt;/ref&gt; The Mosuo tribe is the last remaining matriarchal society in China and one of the last ones in the world.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/dec/19/china-mosuo-tribe-matriarchy&lt;/ref&gt; Both sisters face many misconceptions when it comes to their rare culture, especially about the concept of walking marriages.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.libertasfilmmagazine.com/economic-inequality-in-china-lfm-reviews-the-mosuo-sisters-doc-nyc/&lt;/ref&gt; As the sisters return to their home and the traditional culture of the Mosuo, they struggle with reconciling the modern society of Beijing with their own culture. Jua Ma returns to the city in hopes of pursuing an entertainment career that will allow her to support her family, while La Tsuo sacrifices her accounting class and hopes for a future in accounting in order to stay home and help on the farm.

'''Wolf ticket''' is a literal translation of the [[Russian language]] phrase {{lang|ru|волчий билет}} (volchiy bilyet), a colloquial expression to denote a version of a document with restrictive clauses in comparison to the full document. Figuratively, the phrase remains in use in many of the countries of the former [[communist bloc]], usually to denote any kind of document that negatively affects one's career.

Originally the phrase was used in [[Imperial Russia]] to denote a document issued in lieu of the [[internal passport]] to persons who were given a half-year postponement of [[katorga]] or [[exile]] for settling personal affairs. Later, it denoted a limited certificate for completion of studies. Unlike a regular diploma, it merely stated that the studies were completed, but the student was not allowed to take exams for reasons of poor study or improper behavior.

A wolf ticket was a serious impediment to one's career. Still later this phrase was applied to a document issued in place of an [[internal passport]] to persons released from imprisonment ("certificate of release"). Usually this kind of document restricted the rights of a citizen in terms of place of residence (the [[101st kilometre]] rule), occupation, and so on.

'''''Woman's Hour''''' is a radio magazine programme broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

==History==
Created by [[Norman Collins]]&lt;ref name=hist&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0165mfd October 1946 - Woman's Hour - The first dedicated radio programme for women], 11 March 2013, BBC, Retrieved 4 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and originally presented by [[Alan Ivimey]], ''Woman's Hour'' was first broadcast on 7 October 1946 on the [[BBC]]'s [[The Light Programme|Light Programme]] (now called [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]]). [[Janet Quigley]], who was also involved with the birth of the UK radio programme [[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]], has been credited with "virtually creating" the programme.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-kevin-fitzgerald-1504964.html Kevin FitzGerald], Obituary, ''[[The Independent]]'', Retrieved 4 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  

The programme was transferred to its current home in 1973. Over the years it has been presented by [[Joan Griffiths]], [[Violet Carson]], [[Olive Shapley]], [[Jean Metcalfe]] (1947, 1958), [[Marjorie Anderson]] (until 1972), [[Judith Chalmers]] (1966{{ndash}}1970), [[Sue MacGregor]] (1972{{ndash}}1987), [[Jenni Murray]] (since 1987), [[Martha Kearney]] (1998 to March 2007), and [[Jane Garvey (broadcaster)|Jane Garvey]] (since 8 October 2007). Fill-in presenters have included [[Sheila McClennon]], [[Carolyn Quinn]], [[Jane Little]], [[Ritula Shah]], [[Oona King]], [[Amanda Platell]] and [[Emma Barnett]].

On 31 December 2004, the show became ''Man's Hour'' for one day only, on which it was presented by [[Channel 4 News]] anchor [[Jon Snow (journalist)|Jon Snow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/b3cda5378e7c4b6c9f36003aacfe2ad4|title=Man's Hour - BBC Radio 4 FM - 31 December 2004 - BBC Genome|website=genome.ch.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 July 2010, after 64 years of ''Woman's Hour'', the BBC began broadcasting a full series called [[Men's Hour]] on [[BBC Radio 5 Live]], presented by [[Tim Samuels]].

As of 2013, the programme had 3.9 million listeners, 14% of whom were men.&lt;ref name=guardian-20130811&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/aug/11/womans-hour-jenni-murray-radio |title=The Woman's Hour mix - does it work? |author=Miranda Sawyer |newspaper=The Guardian |date=11 August 2013 |accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 it had 2.7 million listeners, 4% of whom were men.&lt;ref name=independent-20060203&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/womans-hour-discovers-a-new-audience-men-465457.html |title='Woman's Hour' discovers a new audience: men |author=Ciar Byrne |newspaper=The Independent |date=3 February 2006 |accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For one week in April 2014, the programme was guest edited by [[J. K. Rowling]], [[Kelly Holmes]], [[Naomi Alderman]], [[Doreen Lawrence]] and [[Lauren Laverne]]. It was the first time the programme had a guest editor since its initial decade of broadcast.&lt;ref name=guardian-20140410&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/10/jk-rowling-guest-editor-womans-hour |title=JK Rowling to become Woman's Hour first guest editor for 60 years |author=Alison Flood |newspaper=The Guardian |date=10 April 2014 |accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015, the programme hosted "Woman's Hour Takeover" with a week of guest editors, including [[Kim Cattrall]], [[Nimko Ali]], [[Rachel Treweek]], [[Michelle Mone, Baroness Mone|Michelle Mone]] and [[Jacqueline Wilson]].&lt;ref name=bbc-20150930&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p031y7r9 |title=BBC Radio 4 - Woman's Hour Takeover |accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Late Night Woman's Hour]]'', a spinoff series, was launched in 2015, presented by [[Lauren Laverne]]. The series airs in an 11{{nbsp}}pm timeslot and each episode takes a single topic for discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/aug/21/lauren-laverne-radio-4-late-night-womans-hour-bbc | title=Lauren Laverne raises eyebrows with Radio 4's Late Night Woman’s Hour |work=The Guardian | date=21 August 2015 | accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
In its current format, the first 45 minutes of the programme consist of reports, interviews and debates on health, education, cultural and political topics aimed at women and mothers. The last 15 minutes feature short-run drama [[Serial (radio and television)|serial]]s (''[[Woman's Hour Drama]]''), which periodically change.  One of the most popular of these are the recurring ''[[Ladies of Letters]]'' serials, starring [[Prunella Scales]] and [[Patricia Routledge]]. (This section is also broadcast at 7:45{{nbsp}}pm.) Before 1998 the last quarter of an hour was dedicated to readings.

==Schedule==
''Woman's Hour'' has been broadcast at 10{{nbsp}}am Monday to Friday since [[James Boyle (broadcasting)|James Boyle]]'s revision of the Radio 4 schedules in April 1998.  Between September 1991 and April 1998 it was broadcast at 10:30{{nbsp}}am, having previously gone out for many years in an early afternoon slot (2{{nbsp}}pm).  The programme's move to a morning slot was unpopular among some listeners who, for family or other reasons, work only in the morning. [[Michael Green (radio)|Michael Green]], the then controller of Radio 4, made his decision the previous year and considered the elimination of the programme title.&lt;ref&gt;David Hendy ''Life on Air: A History of Radio Four'', 2007, OUP, p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Weekend Woman's Hour'' is broadcast on Saturday afternoons at 4{{nbsp}}pm, and features highlights of the previous week. Additionally, episodes are made available as a podcast following the broadcast of each programme.

==Music==
In its earlier years, it used a variety of popular light classics as signature tunes, including such pieces as H. Elliott-Smith's ''Wanderlust (Waltz)'', [[Anthony Vincent Collins|Anthony Collins]]' ''Vanity Fair'', and the lively Overture from [[Gabriel Fauré]]'s ''[[Masques et Bergamasques (Fauré)|Masques et Bergamasques]].''  From the early 1970s, specially composed pieces were used, several of which were provided by the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]].

There is also a band called [[Woman's Hour (band)|Woman's Hour]] based in the UK and signed to [[Secretly Canadian]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secretlycanadian.com/artist/?name=womanshour|title=Woman's Hour – Biography|publisher=Secretly Canadian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  records who took their name from the radio show.

==Feminism==
The programme maintains links with [[Women's Aid]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womensaid.org.uk/page.asp?section=0001000100150003|title=Women's Aid|work=womensaid.org.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717051825/http://www.womensaid.org.uk/page.asp?section=0001000100150003|archivedate=17 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Fawcett Society]], a campaign group that promotes using the media to secure political change on women's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/2013/03/welcome-from-our-president/|title=Welcome from our President|work=The Fawcett Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''writer''' is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate their ideas. Writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, poetry, plays, screenplays, and essays as well as various [[report]]s and news articles that may be of interest to the public. Writers' texts are published across a range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express [[idea]]s well, often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Magill |first1=Frank N.|title=Cyclopedia of World Authors|edition=revised  |volume=vols. I, II, III |year=1974 |publisher=Salem Press |location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey |isbn= |pages=1–1973}} [A compilation of the bibliographies and short biographies of notable authors up to 1974.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term "writer" is also used elsewhere in the arts – such as songwriter – but as a standalone "writer" normally refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an [[oral tradition]].

Writers can produce material across a number of genres, fictional or non-fictional. Other writers use multiple media – for example, graphics or illustration – to enhance the communication of their ideas. Another recent demand has been created by civil and government readers for the work of non-fictional technical writers, whose skills create understandable, interpretive documents of a practical or scientific nature. Some writers may use [[image]]s (drawing, painting, graphics) or [[multimedia]] to augment their writing. In rare instances, creative writers are able to communicate their ideas via music as well as words.&lt;ref&gt;Nobel prize winner [[Rabindranath Tagore]] is an example.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as producing their own written works, writers often write on ''how'' they write (that is, the process they use);&lt;ref name=Nicolson1&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicolson|first=Adam|title=When God Spoke English: The Making of the King James Bible|year=2011|publisher=Harper Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-00-743100-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''why'' they write (that is, their motivation);&lt;ref name=Blythe&gt;See, for example, {{cite book|title=Why I write: thoughts on the practice of fiction|year=c. 1998|publisher=Little, Brown|location=Boston|isbn=0316102296|editor=Will Blythe}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also comment on the work of other writers (criticism).&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Franzen]], for example, criticised [[John Updike]] for being "exquisitely preoccupied with his own literary digestive processes ..." and his "lack of interest in the bigger postwar, postmodern, socio-technological picture" {{cite journal|last=Franzen|first=Jonathan|title=Franzen on Kraus: Footnote 89|journal=The Paris Review|date=6 September 2013|issue=206|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/category/issue-206/|accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers work professionally or non-professionally, that is, for payment or without payment and may be paid either in advance (or on acceptance), or only after their work is published. Payment is only one of the motivations of writers and many are never paid for their work.

The term ''writer'' is often used as a synonym of ''author'', although the latter term has a somewhat broader meaning and is used to convey legal responsibility for a piece of writing, even if its composition is anonymous, unknown or collaborative.

==Types==
Writers choose from a range of [[literary genre]]s to express their ideas. Most writing can be adapted for use in another medium. For example, a writer's work may be read privately or recited or performed in a play or film. Satire for example, may be written as a poem, an essay, a film, a comic play, or a piece of journalism. The writer of a letter may include elements of criticism, biography, or journalism.

Many writers work across genres. The genre sets the parameters but all kinds of creative adaptation have been attempted: novel to film; poem to play; history to musical. Writers may begin their career in one genre and change to another. For example, historian [[William Dalrymple (historian)|William Dalrymple]] began in the genre of [[travel literature]] and also writes as a journalist. Many writers have produced both fiction and non-fiction works and others write in a genre that crosses the two. For example, writers of [[historical romance]]s, such as [[Georgette Heyer]], invent characters and stories set in historical periods. In this genre, the accuracy of the history and the level of factual detail in the work both tend to be debated. Some writers write both creative fiction and serious analysis, sometimes using different names to separate their work. [[Dorothy L. Sayers|Dorothy Sayers]], for example, wrote crime fiction but was also a playwright, essayist, translator, and critic.

He had done for her all that a man could,
And some might say, more than a man should,
Then was ever a flame so recklessly blown out
Or a last goodbye so negligent as this?
‘I will write to you,' she muttered briefly,
Tilting her cheek for a polite kiss;
Then walked away, nor ever turned about.  ...

Long letters written and mailed in her own head –
There are no mails in a city of the dead.&lt;br /&gt;

Poets make maximum use of the language to achieve an emotional and sensory effect as well as a cognitive one. To create these effects, they use [[rhyme]] and rhythm and they also exploit the properties of words with a range of other techniques such as [[alliteration]] and [[assonance]]. A common theme is love and its vicissitudes. [[Shakespeare]]'s famous love story ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', for example, written in a variety of poetic forms, has been performed in innumerable theatres and made into at least eight cinematic versions.&lt;ref&gt;1936, 1954, 1955, 1966, 1968, 1978, 2013, 2014. [https://www.imdb.com/find?q=Romeo+and+Juliet&amp;s=all IMDb listing.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Donne]] is another poet renowned for his love poetry.

====Novelist====
{{Main|Novelist}}

Novelists write novels – stories that explore universal themes through fiction. They situate invented characters and plots in a narrative designed to be both credible and entertaining.
{{Quotation|''Every novel worthy of the name is like another planet, whether large or small, which has its own laws just as it has its own flora and fauna. Thus, [[William Faulkner|Faulkner]]'s technique is certainly the best one with which to paint Faulkner's world, and [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]]'s nightmare has produced its own myths that make it communicable. [[Benjamin Constant]], [[Stendhal]], [[Eugène Fromentin]], [[Jacques Rivière]], [[Raymond Radiguet|Radiguet]], all used different techniques, took different liberties, and set themselves different tasks.''&lt;br /&gt;[[François Mauriac]], novelist&lt;ref name="Le Marchand"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Le Marchand|first=Jean|title=Interviews: François Mauriac, The Art of Fiction No. 2|journal=The Paris Review|date=Summer 1953|issue= 2|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/5197/the-art-of-fiction-no-2-franois-mauriac|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Satirist====
{{Main|Satire}}

A satirist uses wit to ridicule the shortcomings of society or individuals, with the intent of exposing stupidity. Usually, the subject of the satire is a contemporary issue such as ineffective political decisions or politicians, although human vices such as [[greed]] are also a common and universal subject. Philosopher [[Voltaire]] wrote a satire about optimism called ''[[Candide]]'', which was subsequently turned into an opera, and many well known lyricists wrote for it. There are elements of [[Absurdism]] in ''Candide'', just as there are in the work of contemporary satirist [[Barry Humphries]], who writes comic satire for his character [[Dame Edna Everage]] to perform on stage.

Satirists use various techniques such as [[irony]], [[sarcasm]], and [[hyperbole]] to make their point and they choose from the full range of genres – the satire may be in the form of prose or poetry or dialogue in a film, for example. One of the most famous satirists is [[Jonathan Swift]] who wrote the four-volume work ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and many other satires, including ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'' and ''[[The Battle of the Books]]''.

{{Quotation|''It is amazing to me that ... our age is almost wholly illiterate and has hardly produced one writer upon any subject.''&lt;br /&gt;[[Jonathan Swift]], satirist (1704)&lt;ref&gt;The Epistle Dedicatory of ''[[A Tale of a Tub]]''. For text at Wikisource, see [[s:A Tale of a Tub|''A Tale of a Tub'']]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Short story writer====
{{Main|Short story}}
A short story writer is a writer of short stories, works of fiction that can be read in a single sitting.

===Performative===
====Librettist====
[[File:Wagner Luzern 1868.jpg|thumb|Composer [[Richard Wagner]], who also wrote the libretti for his works]]
{{Main|Libretto}}
Libretti (the plural of libretto) are the texts for musical works such as operas. The Venetian poet and librettist [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]], for example, wrote the libretto for some of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s greatest operas. [[Luigi Illica]] and [[Giuseppe Giacosa]] were Italian librettists who wrote for [[Giacomo Puccini]]. Most opera composers collaborate with a librettist but unusually, [[Richard Wagner]] wrote both the music and the libretti for his works himself.
{{Quotation|''Chi son? Sono poeta. Che cosa faccio? Scrivo. E come vivo? Vivo.''
("Who am I? I'm a poet. What do I do? I write. And how do I live? I live.")&lt;br /&gt;Rodolpho, in [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]'s ''[[La bohème]]''&lt;ref&gt;Excerpt of Rodolpho's aria in Act I of ''[[La bohème]]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Lyricist====
{{Main|Lyricist}}
Usually writing in verses and choruses, a lyricist specializes in writing [[lyrics]], the words that accompany or underscore a song or opera. Lyricists also write the words for songs. In the case of [[Tom Lehrer]], these were satirical. Lyricist [[Noël Coward]], who wrote musicals and songs such as "[[Mad Dogs and Englishmen (song)|Mad Dogs and Englishmen]]" and the recited song "[[I Went to a Marvellous Party]]", also wrote plays and films and performed on stage and screen as well. Writers of lyrics, such as these two, adapt other writers' work as well as create entirely original pieces.
{{Quotation|''Making lyrics feel natural, sit on music in such a way that you don't feel the effort of the author, so that they shine and bubble and rise and fall, is very, very hard to do.''&lt;br /&gt;[[Stephen Sondheim]], lyricist&lt;ref name=Lipton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lipton|first=James|title=Interview: Stephen Sondheim, The Art of the Musical|journal=The Paris Review|date=Spring 1997|issue= 142|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/1283/the-art-of-the-musical-stephen-sondheim|accessdate=May 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Playwright====
[[File:FF The Tempest title.jpg|thumb|Title page of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Tempest]]'' from the 1623 [[First Folio]]]]
{{Main|Playwright}}

A playwright writes plays which may or may not be performed on a stage by actors. A play's narrative is driven by dialogue. Like novelists, playwrights usually explore a theme by showing how people respond to a set of circumstances. As writers, playwrights must make the language and the dialogue succeed in terms of the characters who speak the lines as well as in the play as a whole. Since most plays are performed, rather than read privately, the playwright has to produce a text that works in spoken form and can also hold an audience's attention over the period of the performance. Plays tell "a story the audience should care about", so writers have to cut anything that worked against that.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sydneytheatre.com.au/magazine/posts/2015/november/feature-mike-bartlett-kciii?fptd_mode=validation|title=Mike Bartlett on writing King Charles III|last=Bartlett|first=Mike|date=18 November 2015|website=Sydney Theatre Company Magazine|publisher=Sydney Theatre Company|access-date=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plays may be written in prose or verse. Shakespeare wrote plays in [[iambic pentameter]] as does [[Mike Bartlett (playwright)|Mike Bartlett]] in his play ''King Charles III'' (2014).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Playwrights also adapt or re-write other works, such as plays written earlier or literary works originally in another genre. Famous playwrights such as [[Henrik Ibsen]] or [[Anton Chekhov]] have had their works adapted many times. The plays of early Greek playwrights [[Sophocles]], [[Euripides]], and [[Aeschylus]] are still performed. Adaptations of a playwright's work may be faithful to the original or creatively interpreted. If the writers' purpose in re-writing the play is to produce a film, they will have to prepare a screenplay. Shakespeare's plays, for example, while still regularly performed in the original form, are often adapted and abridged, especially for the [[filmmaking|cinema]]. An example of a creative modern adaptation of a play that nonetheless used the original writer's words, is [[Baz Luhrmann]]'s version of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. The amendment of the name to ''[[Romeo + Juliet]]'' indicates to the audience that the version will be different from the original. [[Tom Stoppard]]'s play ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' is a play inspired by Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'' that takes two of Shakespeare's most minor characters and creates a new play in which they are the protagonists.

{{Quotation|'''''Player''''': ''It's what the actors do best. They have to exploit whatever talent is given to them, and their talent is dying. They can die heroically, comically, ironically, slowly, suddenly, disgustingly, charmingly or from a great height.''&lt;br /&gt;[[Tom Stoppard]], [[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]] (Act Two)&lt;ref name=Stoppard&gt;{{cite book|last=Stopppard|first=Tom|title=Rosencrantz and Guildentern Are Dead|year=1967|publisher=Faber and Faber|isbn=0-571-08182-7|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Screenwriter====
{{Main|Screenwriter}}

Screenwriters write a screenplay – or script – that provides the words for media productions such as films, television programs and video games. Screenwriters may start their careers by writing the screenplay [[Spec script|speculatively]]; that is, they write a script with no advance payment, solicitation or contract. On the other hand, they may be employed or commissioned to adapt the work of a playwright or novelist or other writer. Self-employed writers who are paid by contract to write are known as [[freelancer]]s and screenwriters often work under this type of arrangement.

Screenwriters, playwrights and other writers are inspired by the great [[Theme (arts)|themes]] and often use similar and familiar plot devices to explore them. For example, in Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'' is a "play within a play", which the hero uses to demonstrate the king's guilt. Hamlet gains the co-operation of the actors to set up the play as a thing "wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king".&lt;ref&gt;''[[s:The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark/Act 2|The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark/Act 2]]'', (Act II, Sc.2, line 609)&lt;/ref&gt; [[teleplay]] writer [[Joe Menosky]] deploys the same "play within a play" device in an episode of the science fiction [[Television program#Seasons/series|television series]] ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]''. The bronze-age playwright/hero enlists the support of a ''Star Trek'' crew member to create a play that will convince the ruler (or "patron" as he is called), of the futility of war.&lt;ref&gt;See Season 6, Episode 22: [[Muse (Star Trek: Voyager)|"Muse", ''(Star Trek: Voyager)'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Speechwriter====
{{Main|Speechwriter}}
A speechwriter prepares the text for a [[Public speaking|speech]] to be given before a group or crowd on a specific occasion and for a specific purpose. They are often intended to be persuasive or inspiring, such as the speeches given by skilled orators like [[Cicero]]; charismatic or influential political leaders like [[Nelson Mandela]]; or for use in a court of law or parliament. The writer of the speech may be the person intended to deliver it, or it might be prepared by a person hired for the task on behalf of someone else. Such is the case when speechwriters are employed by many senior-level elected officials and executives in both government and private sectors.

===Interpretive and academic===
====Biographer====
{{Main|List of biographers}}
Biographers write an account of another person's life. [[Richard Ellmann]] (1918–1987), for example, was an eminent and award-winning biographer whose work focused on the Irish writers [[James Joyce]], [[W. B. Yeats|William Butler Yeats]], and [[Oscar Wilde]]. For the Wilde biography, he won the 1989 [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography|Pulitzer Prize for Biography]].

====Critic====

Critics consider and assess the extent to which a work succeeds in its purpose. The work under consideration may be literary, theatrical, musical, artistic, or architectural. In assessing the success of a work, the critic takes account of why it was done – for example, why a text was written, for whom, in what style, and under what circumstances. After making such an assessment, critics write and publish their evaluation, adding the value of their scholarship and thinking to substantiate any opinion. The theory of criticism is an area of study in itself: a good critic understands and is able to incorporate the theory behind the work they are evaluating into their assessment.&lt;ref name=Habib&gt;For example, see {{cite book|last=Habib|first= M.A.R.|title=A History of Literary Criticism and Theory|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=MA, USA; Oxford, UK; Victoria, Australia|isbn=978-0-631-23200-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics are already writers in another genre. For example, they might be novelists or essayists. Influential and respected writer/critics include the art critic [[Charles Baudelaire]] (1821–1867) and the literary critic [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]] (born 1965), both of whom have books published containing collections of their criticism. Some critics are poor writers and produce only superficial or unsubstantiated work. Hence, while anyone can be an uninformed critic, the notable characteristics of a good critic are understanding, insight, and an ability to write well.

{{Quotation|''We can claim with at least as much accuracy as a well-known writer claims of his little books, that no newspaper would dare print what we have to say. Are we going to be very cruel and abusive, then? By no means: on the contrary, we are going to be impartial. We have no friends – that is a great thing – and no enemies.''&lt;br /&gt;[[Charles Baudelaire]], introducing his Review of the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] of 1845&lt;ref name=Mayne&gt;{{cite book|last=Baudelaire|first=Charles|title=Baudelaire – Art in Paris 1845–1862: Reviews of Salons and other exhibitions|year=1965|publisher=Phaidon Press|location=London|page=1|editor = Jonathan Mayne (editor and translator)|chapter=The Salon of 1845}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Editor====
{{Main|Editing|Copywriting}}
[[File:Un Cœur simple (manuscrito).jpg|thumb|Flaubert's heavily edited page of his manuscript for [[Three Tales (Flaubert)#"A Simple Heart"|Un Cœur simple]]]]

An editor prepares literary material for publication. The material may be the editor's own original work but more commonly, an editor works with the material of one or more other people. There are different types of editor. [[Copy editing|Copy editors]] format text to a particular style and/or correct errors in grammar and spelling without changing the text substantively. On the other hand, an editor may suggest or undertake significant changes to a text to improve its readability, sense or structure. This latter type of editor can go so far as to excise some parts of the text, add new parts, or restructure the whole. The work of editors of ancient texts or [[manuscript]]s or collections of works results in differing editions. For example, there are many editions of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s plays by notable editors who also contribute original introductions to the resulting publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warner|first=Beverley Ellison|title=Famous Introductions to Shakespeare's Plays by the Notable Editors of the Eighteenth Century (1906)|date = 2012|publisher=HardPress|isbn=1290807086}}&lt;/ref&gt; Editors who work on journals and newspapers have varying levels of responsibility for the text – they may write original material, in particular, editorials; select what is to be included from a range of items on offer; format the material; or check its accuracy.

====Encyclopaedist====
[[File:Printing3 Walk of Ideas Berlin.JPG|thumb|Sculpture in Berlin depicting a stack of books on which are inscribed the names of great writers: [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]; [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]]; [[Thomas Mann|Mann]]; [[Theodor Fontane|Fontane]]; [[Hermann Hesse|Hesse]]; [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]; [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]]; [[Heinrich Böll|Böll]]; [[Karl Marx|Marx]]; [[Brothers Grimm]]; [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]; [[Anna Seghers|Seghers]]; [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]; [[Martin Luther|Luther]]; [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]]; [[Hannah Arendt|Arendt]]; [[Günter Grass|Grass]] ]]

{{Main|Encyclopedia}}
Encyclopaedists create organised bodies of knowledge. [[Denis Diderot]] (1713–1784) is renowned for his contributions to the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''. The encyclopaedist [[Bernardino de Sahagún]] (1499–1590) was a [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] whose ''Historia general de las cosas de Nueva España'' is a vast encyclopedia of [[Mesoamerica]]n civilisation, commonly referred to as the ''[[Florentine Codex]]'', after the Italian manuscript library which holds the best preserved copy.

====Essayist====
{{Main|List of essayists}}

Essayists write essays, which are original pieces of writing of moderate length in which the author makes a case in support of an opinion. They are usually in [[prose]], but some writers have used poetry to present their argument.

====Historian====
{{See also|List of historians}}
A historian is a person who studies and writes about the past and is regarded as an authority on it.&lt;ref name="wordnetprinceton"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=Historian |title= Historian |publisher=Wordnetweb.princeton.edu |accessdate=28 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of a historian is to employ [[Historiography|historical analysis]] to create coherent narratives that explain "what happened" and "why or how it happened". Professional historians typically work in colleges and universities, archival centers, government agencies, museums, and as freelance writers and consultants.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Grafton and Robert B. Townsend, "The Parlous Paths of the Profession" [http://www.historians.org/Perspectives/issues/2008/0810/0810pro1.cfm ''Perspectives on History'' (Sept. 2008) online]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Gibbon]]'s six volume ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' influenced the development of [[historiography]].

====Lexicographer====
{{Main|Lexicography}}
Writers who create dictionaries are called lexicographers. One of the most famous is [[Samuel Johnson]] (1709–1784), whose ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language|Dictionary of the English Language]]'' was regarded not only as a great personal scholarly achievement but was also dictionary of such pre-eminence, that would have been referred to by such writers as [[Jane Austen]].

====Researcher/Scholar====
{{Main|Research|Scholarly method}}
[[File:Chomsky 4 - On the elite's view of the poor.ogg|thumb|left|One of many interviews with prolific American writer, philosopher, linguist, scientist, historian and critic [[Noam Chomsky]] (2009)]]

Researchers and scholars who write about their discoveries and ideas sometimes have profound effects on society. Scientists and philosophers are good examples because their new ideas can revolutionise the way people think and how they behave. Three of the best known examples of such a revolutionary effect are [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], who wrote ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (1543); [[Charles Darwin]], who wrote ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859); and [[Sigmund Freud]], who wrote ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' (1899).

These three highly influential, and initially very controversial, works changed the way people understood their place in the world. Copernicus's [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] view of the cosmos displaced humans from their previously accepted place at the centre of the universe; Darwin's evolutionary theory placed humans firmly within, as opposed to above, the order of nature; and Freud's ideas about the power of the [[unconscious mind]] overcame the belief that humans were consciously in control of all their own actions.&lt;ref name=Weinert&gt;{{cite book|last=Weinert|first=Friedel|title=Copernicus, Darwin and Freud: Revolutions in the History and Philosophy of Science|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Malden, Massachusetts, USA; Oxford UK;|isbn=978-1-4051-8184-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Translator====
{{Main|Translation}}
Translators have the task of finding some equivalence in another language to a writer's meaning, intention and style. Translators whose work has had very significant cultural effect include [[Al-Ḥajjāj ibn Yūsuf ibn Maṭar]], who translated ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' from [[Greek language|Greek]] into [[Arabic]] and [[Jean-François Champollion]], who deciphered [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] with the result that he could publish the first translation of the [[Rosetta Stone]] hieroglyphs in 1822. Difficulties with translation are exacerbated when words or phrases incorporate rhymes, rhythms, or [[pun]]s; or when they have connotations in one language that are non-existent in another. For example, the title of ''[[Le Grand Meaulnes]]'' by [[Alain-Fournier]] is supposedly untranslatable because "no English adjective will convey all the shades of meaning that can be read into the simple [French] word 'grand' which takes on overtones as the story progresses."&lt;ref name=Gopnik&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gopnik|first1=Adam|title="Introduction" to the English translation of "Le Grand Meaulnes"|date=2007|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|isbn=9780141441894|page=vii–viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translators have also become a part of events where political figures who speak different languages meet to look into the relations between countries or solve political conflicts. It is highly critical for the translator to deliver the right information as a drastic impact could be caused if any error occurred. 

{{Quotation|''Even if translation is impossible – we have no choice but to do it: to take the next step and start translating. ... The translator's task is to make us either forget or else enjoy the difference.''&lt;br /&gt;[[Robert Dessaix]], translator, author&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dessaix|first=Robert|title="Dandenongs Gothic: On Translation" in (and so forth)|year=1998|publisher=Pan McMillan Australia Ltd|location=Sydney|isbn=0-7329-0943-0|pages=307|authorlink=Robert Dessaix}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Reportage===

====Blogger====
{{Main|Blog}}
Writers of blogs, which have appeared on the [[World Wide Web]] since the 1990s, need no authorisation to be published. The contents of these short opinion pieces or "posts" form a commentary on issues of specific interest to readers who can use the same technology to interact with the author, with an immediacy hitherto impossible. The ability to link to other sites means that some blog writers – and their writing – may become suddenly and unpredictably popular. [[Malala Yousafzai]], a young Pakistani education activist, rose to prominence because of her blog for [[BBC]].

A blog writer is using the technology to create a message that is in some ways like a newsletter and in other ways, like a personal letter.  "The greatest difference between a blog and a photocopied school newsletter, or an annual family letter photocopied and mailed to a hundred friends, is the potential audience and the increased potential for direct communication between audience members".&lt;ref name=Rettburg&gt;{{cite book|last=Rettberg|first=Jill Walker|title=Blogging|year=2008|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge UK; Malden, Massachusetts USA|isbn=978-0-7456-4133-1|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, as with other forms of letter, the writer knows some of the readers, but one of the main differences is that "some of the audience will be random" and "that presumably changes the way we [writers] write."&lt;ref name=Rettburg /&gt; It has been argued that blogs owe a debt to Renaissance essayist [[Michel de Montaigne]], whose ''Essais'' ("attempts"), were published in 1580, because Montaigne "wrote as if he were chatting to his readers: just two friends, whiling away an afternoon in conversation".&lt;ref name=Bakewell&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bakewell|first=Sarah|title=What Bloggers Owe Montaigne|journal=The Paris Review|date=12 November 2010|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2010/11/12/what-bloggers-owe-montaigne/|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Columnist====
{{Main|Columnist}}
Columnists write regular pieces for newspapers and other periodicals, usually containing a lively and entertaining expression of opinion. Some columnists have had collections of their best work published as a collection in a book, so that readers can re-read what would otherwise be no longer available. Columns are quite short pieces of writing so columnists often write in other genres as well. An example is the columnist [[Elizabeth Farrelly]], who besides being a columnist, is also an architecture critic and author of books.

====Diarist====
{{Main|List of diarists}}
[[File:Anne Frank signature.svg|thumb|Signature of [[Anne Frank]]]]
Writers who record their experiences, thoughts or feelings in a sequential form over a period of time in a diary are known as diarists. Their writings can provide valuable insights into historical periods, specific events or individual personalities. Examples include [[Samuel Pepys]] (1633–1703), an English administrator and Member of Parliament, whose detailed private diary provides eyewitness accounts of events during the 17th century, most notably of the [[Great Fire of London]]. [[Anne Frank]] (1929–1945) was a 13-year-old girl whose diary from 1942 to 1944 records both her experiences as a persecuted Jew in World War II and an adolescent dealing with intra-family relationships.

====Journalist====
{{Main|Journalism}}
Journalists write reports about current events after investigating them and gathering information. Some journalists write reports about predictable or scheduled events such as social or political meetings. Others are [[Investigative journalism|investigative journalists]] who need to undertake considerable research and analysis in order to write an explanation or account of something complex that was hitherto unknown or not understood. Often investigative journalists are reporting criminal or corrupt activity which puts them at risk personally and means that what it is likely that attempts may be made to attack or suppress what they write. An example is [[Bob Woodward]], a journalist who investigated and wrote about [[Watergate scandal|criminal activities by the US President]].
{{Quotation| ''Journalism ... is a public trust, a responsibility, to report the facts with context and completeness, to speak truth to power, to hold the feet of politicians and officials to the fire of exposure, to discomfort the comfortable, to comfort those who suffer.''&lt;br /&gt;Geoffrey Barker, journalist.&lt;ref name="Barker and de Brito"&gt;Barker and de Brito, controversially lamenting the preference for looks over experience in televised journalism. {{cite news|last=Geoffrey Barker|title=Switch off the TV babes for some real news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/comment/switch-off-the-tv-babes-for-some-real-news-20130501-2it0o.html|accessdate=May 3, 2013|newspaper=The Age|date=May 2, 2013}} {{cite news|last=Sam de Brito|title=Reality's bite worse than Barker|url=http://www.smh.com.au/executive-style/culture/blogs/all-men-are-liars/realitys-bite-worse-than-barker-20130502-2ivq8.html|accessdate=May 3, 2013|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=May 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Memoirist====
{{Main|Memoir}}

Writers of memoirs produce accounts from the memories of their own lives, which are deemed unusual, important, or scandalous enough to be of interest to general readers. Although intended to be factual, readers are alerted to the likelihood of some inaccuracies or bias towards an idiosyncratic perception by the choice of genre. A memoir, for example, is allowed to have a much more selective set of experiences than an autobiography which is expected to be more complete and make a greater attempt at balance. Famous memoirists include [[Frances Vane, Viscountess Vane]], and [[Giacomo Casanova]].

===Utilitarian===

====Ghostwriter====
{{Main|Ghostwriter}}
Ghostwriters write for, or in the style of, someone else so the credit goes to the person on whose behalf the writing is done.

====Letter writer====
[[File:Kusakabe Kimbei - Writing Letter (large).jpg|thumb|''Writing Letter''&lt;br /&gt;(Photograph by [[Kusakabe Kimbei]])]]

{{Main|Letter (message)}}
Writers of letters use a reliable form of transmission of messages between individuals, and surviving sets of letters provide insight into the motivations, cultural contexts, and events in the lives of their writers. [[Peter Abelard]] (1079–1142), philosopher, logician, and theologian is known not only for the heresy contained in some of his work, and the punishment of having to burn his own book, but also for the letters he wrote to [[Héloïse (abbess)|Héloïse d'Argenteuil]] {{nowrap|(1090?–1164)}}.&lt;ref&gt;For text see [[s:Letters of Abélard and Héloïse|Letters of Abélard and Héloïse]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The letters (or [[epistle]]s) of [[Paul the Apostle]] were so influential that over the 2000 years of Christian history, Paul became "second only to Jesus in influence and the amount of discussion and interpretation generated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Companion to St. Paul in the Middle Ages|year=2013|publisher=Koninklijke, Brill, NV|location=Leiden The Netherlands|isbn=978-90-04-23672-1 |pages=1|editor=Steven R. Cartwright}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Paul and the Legacies of Paul|year=1990|publisher=Southern Methodist University Press|location=Dallas|editor=William S. Babcock}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nla.ms-ms5393-2-s1.jpg|thumb|left|Water damaged unpublished autograph manuscript page of [[William Bligh|Bligh]]'s voyage in the launch of {{HMS|Bounty}}, from the ship to [[Tofua]] and from thence to [[Timor]] April 28 to June 14, 1789, after the ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty|Mutiny]]''. It contains notes used later as the basis for his report and all his subsequent narratives.]]

====Report writer====
{{Main|Report}}

Report writers are people who gather information, organise and document it so that it can be presented to some person or authority in a position to use it as the basis of a decision. Well-written reports influence policies as well as decisions. For example, [[Florence Nightingale]] (1820–1910) wrote reports that were intended to effect administrative reform in matters concerning health in the army. She documented her experience in the [[Crimean War]] and showed her determination to see improvements: "...after six months of incredible industry she had put together and written with her own hand her ''Notes affecting the Health, Efficiency and Hospital Administration of the British Army.'' This extraordinary composition, filling more than eight hundred closely printed pages, laying down vast principles of far-reaching reform, discussing the minutest detail of a multitude of controversial subjects, containing an enormous mass of information of the most varied kinds – military, statistical, sanitary, architectural" became for a long time, the "leading authority on the medical administration of armies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strachey|first=Lytton|title=[[Eminent Victorians]]|year=1918|publisher=Penguin Modern Classics|isbn=0-14-000649-4|pages=142–3|edition=1981|authorlink=Lytton Strachey|chapter=Florence Nightingale – 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nightingale|first=Florence|title=Notes on matters affecting the health, efficiency, and hospital administration of the British army : founded chiefly on the experience of the late war|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/notes-on-matters-affecting-the-health-efficiency-and-hospital-administration-of-the-british-army-founded-chiefly-on-the-experience-of-the-late-war/oclc/7660327|work=Adelaide Nutting historical nursing collection, AN 0054.|publisher=London : Harrison and Sons, 1858|accessdate=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The logs and reports of [[Master mariner]] [[William Bligh]] contributed to his being honourably acquitted at the [[court-martial]] inquiring into the loss of {{HMS|Bounty}}.

====Scribe====
[[File:The Letter Writer.jpg|thumb|Scribe in India taking instructions from a client]]
{{Main|Scribe}}

A scribe writes ideas and information on behalf of another, sometimes copying from another document, sometimes from oral instruction on behalf of an illiterate person, sometimes transcribing from another medium such as a [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|tape recording]], [[shorthand]], or personal notes.

Being able to write was a rare achievement for over 500 years in Western Europe so monks who copied texts were scribes responsible for saving many texts from classical times. The monasteries, where monks who knew how to read and write lived, provided an environment stable enough for writing. Irish monks, for example, came to Europe in about 600 and "found manuscripts in places like [[Tours]] and [[Toulouse]]" which they copied.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Kenneth|title=Civilisation|year=1969|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|isbn=0-14-016589-4|pages=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monastic writers also illustrated their books with highly skilled art work using gold and rare colours.

====Technical writer====
{{Main|Technical writer}}

A technical writer prepares instructions or manuals, such as [[user guide]]s or [[owner's manual]]s for users of equipment to follow. Technical writers also write various procedures for business, professional or domestic use. Since the purpose of technical writing is practical rather than creative, its most important quality is clarity. The technical writer, unlike the creative writer, is required to adhere to the relevant [[style guide]].

==Process and methods==

===Writing process===
[[File:Carlyle manuscript burning Japan cph.3g10399.tif|thumb|Japanese print depicting [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s horror at his manuscript burning]]
{{main|Writing process}}
There is a range of approaches that writers take to the task of writing. Each writer needs to find their own process and most describe it as more or less a struggle.&lt;ref name=Older&gt;{{cite news|last1=Older|first1=Daniel José|title=Writing Begins With Forgiveness: Why One of the Most Common Pieces of Writing Advice Is Wrong|url=http://sevenscribes.com/writing-begins-with-forgiveness-why-one-of-the-most-common-pieces-of-writing-advice-is-wrong/|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sometimes writers have had the bad fortune to lose their work and have had to start again. Before the invention of [[photocopier]]s and electronic text storage, a writer's work had to be stored on paper, which meant it was very susceptible to fire in particular. (In very early times, writers used [[vellum]] and clay which were more robust materials.) Writers whose work was destroyed before completion include [[L. L. Zamenhof]], the inventor of [[Esperanto]], whose years of work were thrown into the fire by his father because he was afraid that "his son would be thought a spy working code".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryson|first=Bill|title=Mother Tongue&amp;nbsp;– The English Language|year=1990|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-014305-8|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Essayist and historian [[Thomas Carlyle]], lost the only copy of a manuscript for ''[[The French Revolution: A History]]'' when it was mistakenly thrown into the fire by a maid. He wrote it again from the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, Charles William, Ed. "Introductory Note" in ''The Harvard Classics'', Vol. XXV, Part 3. New York: P.F. Collier &amp; Son, 1909–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Writers usually develop a personal schedule. [[Angus Wilson]], for example, wrote for a number of hours every morning.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Angus|title=Interview with Angus Wilson|journal=The Paris Review|year=1957|issue=Autumn-Winter No.17|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/4848/the-art-of-fiction-no-20-angus-wilson|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Writer's block]] is a relatively common experience among writers, especially professional writers, when for a period of time the writer feels unable to write for reasons other than lack of skill or commitment.

{{Quotation|''Happy are they who don't doubt themselves and whose pens fly across the page''&lt;br /&gt;[[Gustave Flaubert]] writing to [[Louise Colet]]&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;Plate caption to an image of a much-corrected page of [[Madame Bovary]] in the Bibliothèque Municipale de Rouen. In {{cite book|last=Brown|first=Frederick|title=Flaubert: a biography|year=2006|publisher=Little, Brown and Co|location=New York|isbn=9780316118781}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Leonid Pasternak - The Passion of creation.jpg|thumb|left|''Throes of Creation'' by [[Leonid Pasternak]] ]]

====Sole====
Most writers write alone – typically they are engaged in a solitary activity that requires them to struggle with both the concepts they are trying to express and the best way to express it. This may mean choosing the best genre or genres as well as choosing the best words. Writers often develop idiosyncratic solutions to the problem of finding the right words to put on a blank page or screen. "Didn't [[W. Somerset Maugham|Somerset Maugham]] also write facing a blank wall? ... [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] couldn't write a line if there was another person anywhere in the same house, or so he said at some point."&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Ted Hughes|Hughes]]|first=Ted|title=Ted Hughes: The Art of Poetry No. 71|journal=The Paris Review|year=1995|volume=Spring|issue= 134|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/1669/the-art-of-poetry-no-71-ted-hughes|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Collaborative====
Collaborative writing means that multiple authors write and contribute to a piece of writing. In this approach, it is highly likely the writers will collaborate on editing the piece too. The more usual process is that the editing is done by an independent editor after the writer submits a draft version.

In some cases, such as that between a librettist and composer, a writer will collaborate with another artist on a creative work. One of the best known of these types of collaborations is that between [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]. Librettist [[W. S. Gilbert]] wrote the words for the [[comic opera]]s created by the partnership.

====Committee====
Occasionally, a writing task is given to a committee of writers. The most famous example is the task of translating the Bible into English, sponsored by King [[James VI and I|James VI]] of England in 1604 and accomplished by six committees, some in [[Cambridge]] and some in [[Oxford]], who were allocated different sections of the text. The resulting [[King James Version|Authorized King James Version]], published in 1611, has been described as an "everlasting miracle" because its writers (that is, its Translators) sought to "hold themselves consciously poised between the claims of accessibility and beauty, plainness and richness, simplicity and majesty, the people and the king", with the result that the language communicates itself "in a way which is quite unaffected, neither literary nor academic, not historical, nor reconstructionist, but transmitting a nearly incredible immediacy from one end of human civilisation to another."&lt;ref name=Nicolson2&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicolson|first=Adam|title=When God Spoke English: The Making of the King James Bible|year=2011|publisher=Harper Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-00-743100-7}}(p.240, 243)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Multimedia====
[[File:William Blake Nurses Song Copy Z 1826.jpg|thumb|[[William Blake]] "[[Nurse's Song]]" from ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'']]
Some writers support the verbal part of their work with images or graphics that are an integral part of the way their ideas are communicated. [[William Blake]] is one of rare poets who created his own paintings and drawings as integral parts of works such as his ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]''. [[Cartoonist]]s are writers whose work depends heavily on hand drawn imagery. Other writers, especially writers for children, incorporate painting or drawing in more or less sophisticated ways. [[Shaun Tan]], for example, is a writer who uses imagery extensively, sometimes combining fact, fiction and illustration, sometimes for a didactic purpose, sometimes on commission.&lt;ref name=Tan&gt;{{cite book|last=Tan|first=Shaun|title=The Oopsatoreum|year=2012|publisher=Powerhouse Publishing|location=Sydney|isbn=9781863171441}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children's writers [[Beatrix Potter]], [[May Gibbs]], and [[Dr. Seuss|Theodor Seuss Geisel]] are as well known for their illustrations as for their texts.

====Crowd sourced====
{{main|Crowdsourcing}}
Some writers contribute very small sections to a piece of writing that cumulates as a result. This method is particularly suited to very large works, such as dictionaries and encyclopaedias. The best known example of the former is the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', under the editorship of lexicographer [[James Murray (lexicographer)|James Murray]], who was provided with the prolific and helpful contributions of [[William Chester Minor|W.C. Minor]], at the time an inmate of a hospital for the criminally insane.&lt;ref name=Crowthorne&gt;{{cite book|last=Winchester|first=Simon|authorlink=Simon Winchester|title=[[The Surgeon of Crowthorne: a tale of murder, madness and the love of words]]|year=1998|publisher=Viking|location=London|isbn=0670878626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known example of the latter – an encyclopaedia that is crowdsourced – is Wikipedia which relies on the contributions of thousands of volunteer writers and editors worldwide, such as [[Simon Pulsifer]].&lt;ref name=Grossman&gt;{{cite web|last=Grossman|first=Lev|title=Simon Pulsifer: The Duke of Data|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1570732,00.html|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=21 February 2013|date=16 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motivations===
Writers have many different reasons for writing, among which is usually some combination of self-expression&lt;ref name=Styron&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peter Matthiessen, George Plimpton|title=William Styron, The Art of Fiction No. 5|url= http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/5114/the-art-of-fiction-no-5-william-styron|journal=The Paris Review|year=1954|issue=Spring|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recording facts, history or research results. The many [[physician writer]]s, for example, have combined their observation and knowledge of the [[human condition]] with their desire to write and contributed many poems, plays, translations, essays and other texts. Some writers write extensively on their motivation and on the likely motivations of other writers. For example, [[George Orwell]]'s essay "[[Why I Write]]" (1946) takes this as its subject. As to "what constitutes success or failure to a writer", it has been described as "a complicated business, where the material rubs up against the spiritual, and psychology plays a big part".&lt;ref name=Sullivan&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sullivan|first1=Jane|title=JK Rowling on turning failure into success|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/jk-rowling-on-turning-failure-into-success-20141219-129vm6.html|accessdate=27 December 2014|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|''The moral I draw is that the writer should seek his reward in the pleasure of his work and in release from the burden of this thoughts; and, indifferent to aught else, care nothing for praise or censure, failure or success.''&lt;br /&gt;[[W. Somerset Maugham]] in ''[[The Moon and Sixpence]]'' (1919)&lt;ref name=Maugham&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maugham|first1=Somerset|title=The Moon and Sixpence|date=1999|publisher=Vintage|isbn=9780099284765|page=8|chapter=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

====Command====
Some writers are the authors of specific military orders whose clarity will determine the outcome of a battle. Among the most controversial and unsuccessful was [[FitzRoy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]]'s order at the [[Charge of the Light Brigade]], which being vague and misinterpreted, led to defeat with many casualties.

====Develop skill/explore ideas====
Some writers use the writing task to develop their own skill (in writing itself or in another area of knowledge) or explore an idea while they are producing a piece of writing. [[Philology|Philologist]] [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], for example, created a new language for his fantasy books.

{{Quotation| ''For me the private act of poetry writing is songwriting, confessional, diary-keeping, speculation, problem-solving, storytelling, therapy, anger management, craftsmanship, relaxation, concentration and spiritual adventure all in one inexpensive package.''&lt;br /&gt;[[Stephen Fry]], author, poet, playwright, screenwriter, journalist&lt;ref name=Fry&gt;{{cite book|last=Fry|first=Stephen|title=The Ode Less Travelled – Unlocking the Poet Within|year=2007|publisher=Arrow Books|isbn=978-0-09-950934-9|pages=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Entertain====
Some genres are a particularly appropriate choice for writers whose chief purpose is to entertain. Among them are [[Limerick (poetry)|limerick]]s, many comics and [[Thriller (genre)|thrillers]]. Writers of children's literature seek to entertain children but are also usually mindful of the educative function of their work as well.

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;''I think that I shall never see''
''a billboard lovely as a tree;''
''Indeed, unless the billboards fall''
''I'll never see a tree at all.''
[[Ogden Nash]], humorous poet, reworking a poem by [[Joyce Kilmer]] for comic effect.&lt;ref name="Nash"&gt;Nash, Ogden, "Song of the Open Road", ''The Face Is Familiar'' (Garden City Publishing, 1941), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

====Influence====
[[File:Ninety-Five Theses, Wittenberg.JPG|thumb|The ''[[Ninety-five Theses]]'' (at the All Saints' Church, [[Wittenburg]])]]
Anger has motivated many writers, including [[Martin Luther]], angry at religious corruption, who wrote the ''[[Ninety-five Theses]]'' in 1517, to reform the church, and [[Émile Zola]] (1840–1902) who wrote the public letter, ''[[J'accuse…!|J'Accuse]]'' in 1898 to bring public attention to government injustice, as a consequence of which he had to flee to England from his native France. Such writers have affected ideas, opinion or policy significantly.

'''Even though he is in love with the same woman, Cyrano helps his inarticulate friend, Rageneau, to woo her by writing on his behalf ...'''&lt;br /&gt;
CYRANO:   What hour is it now, Ragueneau?
RAGUENEAU (stopping short in the act of thrusting to look at the clock): Five minutes after six!...'I touch!' (He straightens himself):   ...Oh! to write a ballade!
...
RAGUENEAU:   Ten minutes after six.
CYRANO: (nervously seating himself at Ragueneau's table, and drawing some paper toward him): A pen!. . .
RAGUENEAU (giving him the one from behind his ear): Here – a swan's quill.
...
CYRANO (taking up the pen, and motioning Ragueneau away):  Hush! (To himself): I will write, fold it, give it her, and fly! (Throws down the pen): Coward! ...But strike me dead if I dare to speak to her, ...ay, even one single word! (To Ragueneau): What time is it?
RAGUENEAU:   A quarter after six! ...
CYRANO (striking his breast): Ay-a single word of all those here! here!  But writing, 'tis easier done... (He takes up the pen): Go to, I will write it, that love-letter!  Oh!  I have writ it and rewrit it in my own mind so oft that it lies there ready for pen and ink; and if I lay but my soul by my letter-sheet, 'tis naught to do but to copy from it.  (He writes.  ...)&lt;br /&gt;[[Edmond Rostand]], ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]''&lt;br /&gt;Act II, Scene 2, (3)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=1445091&amp;pageno=50 Rostand, ''Cyrano de Bergerac'': Act II, Scene 2, (3)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers may write a particular piece for payment (even if at other times, they write for another reason), such as when they are commissioned to create a new work, transcribe an old one, translate another writer's work, or write for someone who is illiterate or inarticulate. In some cases, writing has been the only way an individual could earn an income. [[Frances Milton Trollope|Frances Trollope]] is an example of women who wrote to save herself and her family from penury, at a time when there were very few socially acceptable employment opportunities for them. Her book about her experiences in America, called ''[[Domestic Manners of the Americans]]'' became a great success, "even though she was over fifty and had never written before in her life" after which "she continued to write hard, carrying this on almost entirely before breakfast".&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Katherine|title=Victorian Wives|year=1974|publisher=Allison &amp; Busby|location=London, New York|isbn=0-85031-634-0|pages=65–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to her writer son [[Anthony Trollope]] "her books saved the family from ruin".&lt;ref name=Moore /&gt;

{{Quotation| ''I write for two reasons; partly to make money and partly to win the respect of people whom I respect.''&lt;br /&gt;[[E. M. Forster]], novelist, essayist, librettist&lt;ref name=Forster&gt;Quoted in the introduction to the author in the 1962 edition of {{cite book|last=E.M. Forster|title=[[Aspects of the Novel]]|year=1927|publisher=Penguin|authorlink=E. M. Forster}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Teach====
[[Aristotle]], who was tutor to [[Alexander the Great]], wrote to support his [[education|teaching]]. He wrote two [[treatise]]s for the young prince: "On Monarchy", and "On Colonies"&lt;ref name=MacLeod&gt;{{cite book|title=The Library of Alexandria|year=2000|publisher=The American University in Cairo Press|location=Cairo, Egypt|isbn=977-424-710-8|pages=79–91|author=R.G. Tanner|chapter=Aristotle's Works: The Possible Origins of the Alexandria Collection|editor=Roy MacLeod}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his [[dialogue]]s also appear to have been written either "as lecture notes or discussion papers for use in his philosophy school at the Athens [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]] between 334 and 323 BC."&lt;ref name= MacLeod /&gt; They encompass both his 'scientific' writings ([[metaphysics]], [[physics]], [[biology]], [[meteorology]], and [[astronomy]], as well as [[logic]] and [[argument]]) the 'non-scientific' works (poetry, [[Public speaking|oratory]], ethics, and politics), and "major elements in traditional [[Classical Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] education".&lt;ref name= MacLeod /&gt;

Writers of [[textbook]]s also use writing to teach and there are numerous instructional guides to writing itself. For example, many people will find it necessary to make a speech "in the service of your company, church, civic club, political party, or other organization" and so, instructional writers have produced texts and guides for speechmaking.&lt;ref name=Dowis&gt;{{cite book|last=Dowis|first=Richard|title=The Lost Art of the Great Speech: How to Write One : How to Deliver It|year=2000|publisher=AMA publications|location=New York|isbn=0-8144-7054-8|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tell a story====
Many writers use their skill to tell the story of their people, community or cultural tradition, especially one with a personal significance. Examples include [[Shmuel Yosef Agnon]]; [[Miguel Ángel Asturias]]; [[Doris Lessing]]; [[Toni Morrison]]; [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]]; and [[Patrick White]].
Writers such as [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], [[Herta Müller]], and [[Erich Maria Remarque]] write about the effect of conflict, dispossession and war.

====Woo a lover====
Writers use prose, poetry, and letters as part of courtship rituals.  [[Edmond Rostand]]'s play ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'', written in verse, is about both the power of love and the power of the self-doubting writer/hero's writing talent.

==Authorship==
[[File:Autographe de Marianne Alcoforado (Maria Anna Alcoforada), comme écrivain du couvent de Béja.jpg|thumb|Signature of [[Mariana Alcoforado]] (Maria Anna Alcoforada), once thought to be the writer of the [[Epistolary novel|epistolary fiction]], ''[[Letters of a Portuguese Nun]]''. ]]

===Pen names===
Writers sometimes use a pseudonym, otherwise known as a pen name or "nom de plume". The reasons they do this include to separate their writing from other work (or other types of writing) for which they are known; to enhance the possibility of publication by reducing prejudice (such as against women writers or writers of a particular ethnicity); to reduce personal risk (such as political risks from individuals, groups or states that disagree with them); or to make their name better suit another language.

Examples of well-known writers who used a pen name include: [[George Eliot]] (1819–1880), whose real name was Mary Anne (or Marian) Evans; [[George Orwell]] (1903–1950), whose real name was Eric Blair; [[George Sand]] (1804–1876), whose real name was Lucile Aurore Dupin; [[Dr. Seuss]] (1904–1991), whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel; Stendhal (1783–1842), whose real name was Marie-Henri Beyle and [[Mark Twain]] (1835–1910), whose real name was Samuel Langhorne Clemens.

Apart from the large numbers of works attributable only to "Anonymous", there are a large number of writers who were once known and are now unknown. Efforts are made to find and re-publish these writers' works. One example is the publication of books like ''Japan As Seen and Described by Famous Writers'' (a 2010 reproduction of a pre-1923 publication) by "Anonymous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anonymous|title=Japan As Seen and Described by Famous Writers (published pre-1923)|year=2010 |publisher=BiblioLife|isbn=9781142479084}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the founding of a Library and Study Centre for the Study of Early English Women's Writing in Chawton, England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chawton.org/ Chawton House Library | Home to early English women's writing]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CumaeanSibylByMichelangelo.jpg|thumb|Cumaean Sibyl by [[Michelangelo]]]]

===Fictional writers===
Some fictional writers are very well known because of the strength of their characterization by the real writer or the significance of their role as writer in the plot of a work. Examples of this type of fictional writer include Edward Casaubon, a fictional scholar in George Eliot's ''[[Middlemarch]]'', and Edwin Reardon, a fictional writer in [[George Gissing]]'s ''[[New Grub Street]]''. Casaubon's efforts to complete an authoritative study affect the decisions taken by the protagonists in Eliot's novel and drive significant parts of the plot. In Gissing's work, Reardon's efforts to produce high quality writing put him in conflict with another character, who takes a more commercial approach. [[Robinson Crusoe]] is a fictional writer who was originally credited by the real writer ([[Daniel Defoe]]) as being the author of the confessional letters in the work of the same name. [[Bridget Jones]] is a comparable fictional diarist created by writer [[Helen Fielding]]. Both works became famous and popular; their protagonists and story were developed further through many adaptations, including film versions. [[Cyrano de Bergerac]] was a real writer who created a fictional character with his own name. The ''[[Sibylline Books]]'', a collection of prophecies were supposed to have been purchased from the [[Cumaean Sibyl]] by the last king of Rome. Since they were consulted during periods of crisis, it could be said that they are a case of real works created by a fictional writer.

===Writers of sacred texts===
[[File:Ethiopian - John the Evangelist - Walters W850153V - Open Reverse.jpg|thumb| [[John the Evangelist]] Ethiopian c. 1540]]
[[Religious text]]s or scriptures are the texts which various religious traditions consider to be [[sacred]], or of central importance to their religious tradition. Some religions and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] movements believe that their sacred texts are [[divinity|divinely]] or [[supernatural]]ly [[revelation|revealed or inspired]], while others have individual authors.

==Controversial writing==
[[File:Old Man with Water Studies.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Leonardo da Vinci]] c. 1513 ''Old Man with water studies''. In the [[Royal Librarian (United Kingdom)|Royal Library, Windsor]]. Thought to be a self-portrait, showing Leonardo's writing and drawing.]]
Skilled writers influence ideas and society, so there are many instances where a writer's work or opinion has been unwelcome and controversial. In some cases, they have been persecuted or punished. Aware that their writing will cause controversy or put themselves and others into danger, some writers self-censor; or withhold their work from publication; or hide their manuscripts; or use some other technique to preserve and protect their work. Two of the most famous examples are [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Charles Darwin]]. Leonardo "had the habit of conversing with himself in his writings and of putting his thoughts into the clearest and most simple form". He used "left-handed or mirror writing" (a technique described as "so characteristic of him") to protect his scientific research from other readers.&lt;ref name=Leonardo&gt;{{cite book|title="Leonardo's Manuscripts" in Leonardo de Vinci|publisher=Reynal and Company, in association with William Morris and Company|location=New York|pages=157|edition=Authoritative work, published in Italy by Istituto Geografico De Agostini, in conjunction with exhibition of Leonardo's work in Milan in 1938 (re-edited English translation)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fear of persecution, social disgrace, and being proved incorrect are regarded as contributing factors to Darwin's delaying the publication of his radical and influential work ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.

One of the results of controversies caused by a writer's work is scandal, which is a negative public reaction that causes damage to reputation and depends on public outrage. It has been said that it is possible to scandalise the public because the public "wants to be shocked in order to confirm its own sense of virtue".&lt;ref name="Wilson &amp; Wilson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Colin|title=Scandal!: An Explosive Exposé of the Affairs, Corruption and Power Struggles of the Rich and Famous|year=2011|publisher=Random House|author2=Damon Wilson }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scandal may be caused by what the writer wrote or by the style in which it was written. In either case, the content or the style is likely to have broken with tradition or expectation. Making such a departure may in fact, be part of the writer's intention or at least, part of the result of introducing innovations into the genre in which they are working. For example, novelist [[D H Lawrence]] challenged ideas of what was acceptable as well as what was expected in form. These may be regarded as literary scandals, just as, in a different way, are the scandals involving writers who mislead the public about their identity, such as [[Norma Khouri]] or [[Helen Darville]] who, in deceiving the public, are considered to have committed fraud.

Writers may also cause the more usual type of scandal – whereby the public is outraged by the opinions, behaviour or life of the individual (an experience not limited to writers). Poet [[Paul Verlaine]] outraged society with his behaviour and treatment of his wife and child as well as his lover. Among the many writers whose writing or life was affected by scandals are [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Lord Byron]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Albert Camus]], and [[H. G. Wells]]. One of the most famously scandalous writers was the [[Marquis de Sade]] who offended the public both by his writings ''and'' by his behaviour.

===Punishment===
[[File:Tyndale-martyrdom.png|thumb|Engraving depicting the death of [[William Tyndale]]]]
The consequence of scandal for a writer may be censorship or discrediting of the work, or social ostracism of its creator. In some instances, punishment, persecution, or prison follow. The [[list of journalists killed in Russia]] is an example. Others include:
* The [[Balibo Five]], a group of Australian television journalists who were killed while attempting to report on Indonesian incursions into [[Portuguese Timor]] in 1975.
* [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] (1906–1945), an influential theologian who wrote ''[[The Cost of Discipleship]]'' and was hanged for his resistance to [[Nazism]].
* [[Antonio Gramsci]] (1891–1937), who wrote political theory and criticism and was imprisoned for this by the Italian Fascist regime.
* [[Günter Grass]] (1927–2015), whose poem "[[What Must Be Said]]" led to his being declared ''[[persona non grata]]''  in [[Israel]].
* [[Peter Greste]] (born 1965), a journalist who was imprisoned in Egypt for news reporting which was "damaging to national security."&lt;ref name=bbc-crisis&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-25546389 |title=Egypt crisis: Al-Jazeera journalists arrested in Cairo |work=BBC News |date=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Primo Levi]] (1919–1987) who, among many Jews imprisoned during World War II, wrote an account of his incarceration called ''[[If This Is a Man]]''.
* [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564–1642), who was sentenced to imprisonment for [[heresy]] as a consequence of writing in support of the then controversial theory of [[heliocentrism]], although the sentence was almost immediately commuted to [[house arrest]].
* [[Sima Qian]] (145 or 135 BC – 86 BC) who "successfully defended a vilified master from defamatory charges" and was given "the choice between [[castration]] or execution." He "became a eunuch and had to bury his own book ... in order to protect it from the authorities."&lt;ref name=Battles&gt;{{cite book|last=Battles|first=Matthew|title=Library – An Unquiet History|year=2003|publisher=William Heinemann|location=London|isbn=0-434-00887-7}}p40&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Salman Rushdie]] (born 1947), whose novel ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' was banned and burned internationally after causing [[The Satanic Verses controversy|such a worldwide storm]] that a [[Fatwa|fatwā]] was issued against him. Though Rushdie survived, numerous others were killed in incidents connected to the novel.
* [[Roberto Saviano]] (born 1979), whose best-selling book ''[[Gomorrah (book)|Gomorrah]]'' provoked the Neapolitan [[Camorra]], annoyed [[Silvio Berlusconi]] and led to him receiving permanent police protection.
* [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] (1918–2008), who used his experience of imprisonment as the subject of his writing in ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]'' and ''[[Cancer Ward]]''—the latter, while legally published in the Soviet Union, had to gain the approval of the [[Union of Soviet Writers|USSR Union of Writers]].
* [[William Tyndale]] ({{Circa|1494}} – 1536), who was executed because he translated the Bible into English.
* [[Simon Sheppard (activist)|Simon Sheppard]] (born 1957) who was imprisoned in the UK for expressing controversial opinions on race and the Holocaust.

==Protection and representation==
The organisation [[Reporters Without Borders]] (also known by its French name: Reporters Sans Frontières) was set up to help protect writers and advocate on their behalf.

The professional and industrial interests of writers are represented by various national or regional guilds or unions. Examples include writers guilds in [[Australian Writers' Guild|Australia]] and [[Writers' Guild of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and unions in [[Arab Writers Union|Arabia]], [[Writers Union of Armenia|Armenia]], [[Union of Azerbaijani Writers|Azerbaijan]], [[Writers' Union of Canada|Canada]], [[Estonian Writers' Union|Estonia]], [[Hungarian Writers' Union|Hungary]], [[Irish Writers' Union|Ireland]], [[Moldovan Writers' Union|Moldova]], [[Unyon ng mga Manunulat sa Pilipinas|Philippines]], [[Polish Writers' Union|Poland]], [[Union des écrivaines et des écrivains québécois|Québéc]], [[Writers' Union of Romania|Romania]], [[Union of Russian Writers|Russia]], [[Sudanese Writers Union|Sudan]], and the [[Writer's Union of Ukraine|Ukraine]]. In the United States, there is both a [[Writers Guild of America|writers guild]] and a [[National Writers Union]].

==Awards==
[[File:Tomas Transtromer and Modhir Ahmed.jpg|thumb|[[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize]] Swedish winning poet and translator [[Tomas Tranströmer]] signs a book about his work by [[Modhir Ahmed]] (2007)]]
There are many awards for writers whose writing has been adjudged excellent. Among them are the many [[literary award]]s given by individual countries, such as the [[Prix Goncourt]] and the [[Pulitzer Prize]], as well as international awards such as the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. Russian writer [[Boris Pasternak]] (1890–1960), under pressure from his government, reluctantly declined the Nobel Prize that he won in 1958.
