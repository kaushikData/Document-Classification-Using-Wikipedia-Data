'''33 Whitecross Street''' is a [[grade II listed]] building in [[Monmouth]], [[Monmouthshire]], [[Wales]]. It is in the historic [[St James Square, Monmouth|St James Square]] neighbourhood. The property was the site of archaeological excavation in 2009, which demonstrated evidence of [[Neolithic]] (prehistoric), Roman, and Medieval activity. The following year, archaeological excavation in the square discovered the first evidence of [[Monmouth in the Mesolithic period|Mesolithic human settlement in Monmouth]].

"There are some lovely spots in the town centre, none prettier than St James's Square, with its old war memorial in the shadow of a romantic-looking tree." This is the description of St James Square ''(pictured)'' in Monmouth, Wales that appeared in ''The Telegraph'' of 25 February 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=City spotlight: Monmouth|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/cities/3347952/City-spotlight-Monmouth.html|accessdate=18 May 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=25 Feb 2006|author=Max Davidson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Monmouth War Memorial]] that was installed in the square in 1921 was the work of sculptor W. Clarke of [[Llandaff]].&lt;ref name=newman/&gt; 33 Whitecross Street is located at the eastern end of [[Whitecross Street, Monmouth|Whitecross Street]], where it terminates at the [[roundabout]] encircling the triangular St James Square.&lt;ref name=newman&gt;{{cite book|title=Gwent/Monmouthshire|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-09630-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=knRf4U60QjcC&amp;pg=PA408&amp;lpg=PA408&amp;dq=Old+Nag's+Head+tower+in+Monmouth&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1zMDTKNOco&amp;sig=yTn_DWXgO7q-kM-HUdPTH0cLZOY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TeOqT-yRGYag8QSqqMmyBg&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author=John Newman|edition=illustrated|accessdate=18 May 2012|page=408|date=11 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Latitude and Longitude of a Point|url=http://itouchmap.com/latlong.html|work=itouchmap.com|publisher=iTouchMap.com|accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The record held by the [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales]] gives the building an alternate address, 33 St James Square, on the west side of the square.&lt;ref name=coflein&gt;{{cite web|title=St. James Square, 33, W.

33 Whitecross Street ''(pictured)'' was grade II listed on 15 August 1974.&lt;ref name=coflein/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apria Gir, Monmouth|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-2329-apria-gir-monmouth|work=britishlistedbuildings.co.uk|publisher=British Listed Buildings|accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The listed building is a three storey house with a centrally positioned entrance. The porch has a six panelled door, with narrow [[cast iron]] columns flanking the entry. To the right of the entrance, there is a [[Cant (architecture)|canted bay window]] from the turn of the 20th century. All of the windows on the three bay elevation are of plate glass, although those on the uppermost floor are smaller.&lt;ref name=coflein/&gt; The roof is of [[Welsh slate]], and steeply pitched at the rear elevation which is two storeys. Two red brick chimneys are present. The painted, [[roughcast]] façade is remarkable for two [[band course]]s.&lt;ref name=coflein/&gt; The building was listed due to its "special architectural interest" and its location in a neighbourhood of other historic buildings. The dwelling is likely to have been constructed in the 18th century.&lt;ref name=coflein/&gt;

In January 2009, the [[Monmouthshire County Council]] reported that approval had been granted for two new extensions to the back of 33 Whitecross Street. Notice was given that an archaeological [[watching brief]] would be required.&lt;ref name=county&gt;{{cite web|title=monmouthshire sir fynwy|url=http://idox.monmouthshire.gov.uk/WAM/findCaseFile.do?address=33+Whitecross+Street&amp;appType=Planning&amp;action3=Search|work=idox.monmouthshire.gov.uk|publisher=Monmouthshire County Council|accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; That watching brief was undertaken by the firm of Monmouth Archaeology in July 2009. The subsequent report of the archaeological excavation was issued on 13 August 2009. The team of archaeologists that conducted the excavation included [[Stephen Clarke (archaeologist)|Stephen Clarke]], Jane Bray, Dave Hancocks, and Colin Harris. The conclusion indicated that there was evidence of prehistoric (Neolithic), Roman, Medieval, and Post-Medieval activity at 33 Whitecross Street.&lt;ref name=county/&gt; The following year, in November 2010, the ''BBC News'' reported that a team of local archaeologists had discovered [[Mesolithic]] artefacts at St James Square and Wyebridge Street. The discovery was remarkable because it represented the first evidence of [[Monmouth in the Mesolithic period|Mesolithic human settlement in Monmouth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Items found in Monmouth shed light on Mesolithic man|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-11710978|accessdate=18 May 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=8 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3272">'''André Vaillant''' (November 3, 1890 – April 23, 1977), was a [[French people|French]] [[linguist]], [[philologist]] and [[Linguist|grammarian]] who specialized in [[Slavic languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://proleksis.lzmk.hr/49832/ |contribution=Vaillant, André |title=[[Proleksis Encyclopedia]] |date=November 2013 |accessdate=January 16, 2014 |publisher=[[Leksikografski zavod Miroslav Krleža]] |language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in [[Soissons]]. After studying at [[École Normale Supérieure]] in [[Paris]], he taught as professor at the [[Collège de France]], becoming Chair of Slavic Languages and Literatures in 1952.

In [[Russia]] he studied manuscripts written in [[Old Church Slavonic]]. He worked at the Institute of [[Slavic Studies]] of Paris. He collaborated in the drafting of the Journal of Slavic Studies which served as the basis for the development of his comparative grammar of Slavic languages .

He wrote twenty books including the six-volume Comparative Grammar of Slavic languages (''Grammaire comparée des langues slaves''), the two-volume Handbook of Old Church Slavonic (''Manuel de vieux-slave'') and a grammar of [[Serbo-Croatian]] together with [[Antoine Meillet]].

He translated and published many liturgical texts written in [[Church Slavonic]].

He died in [[Paris]].

'''Aphasia''' is an inability to comprehend or formulate language because of damage to specific [[brain]] regions.&lt;ref name = "Damasio 1992"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Damasio | first1 = A.R. | title = Aphasia. | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 326 | issue = 8 | pages = 531–9 | date = February 1992 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199202203260806 | pmid = 1732792}}&lt;/ref&gt; This damage is typically caused by a cerebral vascular accident ([[stroke]]), or head trauma; however, these are not the only possible causes. To be diagnosed with aphasia, a person's speech or language must be significantly impaired in one (or several) of the four communication modalities following acquired brain injury or have significant decline over a short time period (progressive aphasia). The four communication modalities are auditory comprehension, verbal expression, reading and writing, and functional communication.

The difficulties of people with aphasia can range from occasional trouble finding words, to losing the ability to speak, read, or write; intelligence, however, is unaffected.&lt;ref name = "ASHA Aphasia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/Aphasia/ |title=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA):- Aphasia |format= |work=asha.org |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expressive language and receptive language can both be affected as well. Aphasia also affects [[visual language]] such as [[sign language]].&lt;ref name="Damasio 1992" /&gt; In contrast, the use of [[formulaic language|formulaic expressions]] in everyday communication is often preserved.&lt;ref name = "Sidtis 2015"&gt;{{Citation | title = Tapping into neural resources of communication: formulaic language in aphasia therapy | year = 2015 | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | pages = 1–5 | volume = 6 | issue = 1526 | url = http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01526/full | last1 = Stahl | first1 =  B | last2 = Van Lancker Sidtis | first2 = D | doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01526}}&lt;/ref&gt; One prevalent deficit in the aphasias is [[Anomic aphasia|anomia]], which is a deficit in word finding ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Manasco|first1=M. Hunter|title=Introduction to Neurogenic Communication Disorders|date=2014|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=9781449652449|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''aphasia'' implies that one or more communication modalities in the brain have been damaged and are therefore functioning incorrectly. Aphasia does not refer to damage to the brain that results in motor or sensory deficits, which produces [[dysarthria|abnormal speech]]; that is, aphasia is not related to the mechanics of [[speech]] but rather the individual's language cognition (although a person can have both problems). An individual's "language" is the socially shared set of rules as well as the thought processes that go behind verbalized speech. It is not a result of a more peripheral motor or sensory difficulty, such as [[paralysis]] affecting the speech muscles or a general hearing impairment.

Aphasia affects about 2 million people in the US and 250,000 people in Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aphasia.org/aphasia-resources/aphasia-statistics/&lt;/ref&gt; Though nearly 180,000 people in the US acquire the disorder a year, 84.5% of people have never heard of the condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Aphasia Fact sheet - National Aphasia Association |url=http://www.aphasia.org/aphasia-resources/aphasia-factsheet/ |website=National Aphasia Association|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
People with aphasia may experience any of the following behaviors due to an acquired brain injury, although some of these symptoms may be due to related or concomitant problems such as [[dysarthria]] or [[apraxia]] and not primarily due to aphasia. Aphasia symptoms can vary based on the location of damage in the brain. Signs and symptoms may or may not be present in individuals with aphasia and may vary in severity and level of disruption to communication.&lt;ref&gt;American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (1997-2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Often those with aphasia will try to hide their inability to name objects by using words like ''thing''. So when asked to name a pencil they may say it is a thing used to write.&lt;ref&gt;Nolen-Hoeksema, S. (2014). Neurodevelopmental and Neurocognitive Disorders. In ''Abnormal Psychology'' (6th ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Related behaviors===
Given the previously stated signs and symptoms the following behaviors are often seen in people with aphasia as a result of attempted compensation for incurred speech and language deficits:
* Self-repairs: Further disruptions in fluent speech as a result of mis-attempts to repair erred speech production.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}
* Speech disfluencies: Include previously mentioned disfluencies including repetitions and prolongations at the phonemic, syllable and word level presenting in pathological/ severe levels of frequency.
* Struggle in non-fluent aphasias: A severe increase in expelled effort to speak after a life where talking and communicating was an ability that came so easily can cause visible frustration.
* Preserved and automatic language: A behavior in which some language or language sequences that were used so frequently, prior to onset, they still possess the ability to produce them with more ease than other language post onset.
* Poor eye sight [[oral Dysmorphia]] usually characterized by tingling in the arms and legs, and sometimes heart disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Manasco|first1=M. Hunter|title=Introduction to Neurogenic Communication Disorders|date=2014|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|location=Burlington, MA|pages=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subcortical====
* Subcortical aphasias characteristics and symptoms depend upon the site and size of subcortical lesion. Possible sites of lesions include the [[thalamus]], internal capsule, and basal ganglia.

==Causes==
[[File:Aphasia.png|thumb|Regions of the left hemisphere that can give rise to aphasia when damaged&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henseler|first1=I.|last2=Regenbrecht|first2=F.|last3=Obrig|first3=H.|title=Lesion correlates of patholinguistic profiles in chronic aphasia: comparisons of syndrome-, modality- and symptom-level assessment|journal=Brain|date=12 February 2014|volume=137|issue=3|pages=918–930|doi=10.1093/brain/awt374|pmid=24525451}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Aphasia is most often caused by stroke, but any disease or damage to the parts of the brain that control language can cause aphasia. Some of these can include brain tumors, traumatic brain injury, and progressive neurological disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Aphasia|url = http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/Aphasia/|website = www.asha.org|access-date = 2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In rare cases, aphasia may also result from [[herpesviral encephalitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Soares-Ishigaki | first1 = EC. | last2 = Cera | first2 = ML. | last3 = Pieri | first3 = A. | last4 = Ortiz | first4 = KZ. | title = Aphasia and herpes virus encephalitis: a case study | journal = Sao Paulo Med J | volume = 130 | issue = 5 | pages = 336–41 |year= 2012 | doi =  10.1590/S1516-31802012000500011| pmid = 23174874 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[herpes simplex virus]] affects the frontal and temporal lobes, subcortical structures, and the hippocampal tissue, which can trigger aphasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Can herpes simplex virus encephalitis cause aphasia? | journal = Early Child Development and Care | date =  3 Jun 2010 | first1 = H | last1 = Naudé | first2 = E. | last2 = Pretorius | volume = 173 | issue = 6 | pages = 669–679 | doi = 10.1080/0300443032000088285 | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0300443032000088285#.UbKZCZxq95t | accessdate = 2013-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In acute disorders, such as head injury or stroke, aphasia usually develops quickly. When caused by brain tumor, [[infection]], or [[dementia]], it develops more slowly.&lt;ref name = "ASHA Aphasia" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "medicinenet.com" &gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.medicinenet.com/aphasia/article.htm | title = Aphasia | accessdate = 2011-05-23 | work = MedicineNet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Substantial damage to tissue anywhere within the region shown in blue on the figure below can potentially result in aphasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henseler|first1=I|last2=Regenbrecht|first2=F|last3=Obrig|first3=H|title=Lesion correlates of patholinguistic profiles in chronic aphasia: comparisons of syndrome-, modality- and symptom-level assessment.|journal=Brain |date=March 2014|volume=137|issue=Pt 3|pages=918–30|pmid=24525451|doi=10.1093/brain/awt374}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aphasia can also sometimes be caused by damage to subcortical structures deep within the left hemisphere, including the [[thalamus]], the [[Internal capsule|internal]] and [[external capsule]]s, and the [[caudate nucleus]] of the basal ganglia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuljic-Obradovic|first1=DC|title=Subcortical aphasia: three different language disorder syndromes?|journal=European Journal of Neurology|date=July 2003|volume=10|issue=4|pages=445–8|pmid=12823499|doi=10.1046/j.1468-1331.2003.00604.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kreisler|first1=A|last2=Godefroy|first2=O|last3=Delmaire|first3=C|last4=Debachy|first4=B|last5=Leclercq|first5=M|last6=Pruvo|first6=JP|last7=Leys|first7=D|title=The anatomy of aphasia revisited.|journal=Neurology|date=14 March 2000|volume=54|issue=5|pages=1117–23|pmid=10720284|doi=10.1212/wnl.54.5.1117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area and extent of brain damage or [[atrophy]] will determine the type of aphasia and its symptoms.&lt;ref name="ASHA Aphasia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="medicinenet.com" /&gt; A very small number of people can experience aphasia after damage to the [[right hemisphere]] only. It has been suggested that these individuals may have had an unusual brain organization prior to their illness or injury, with perhaps greater overall reliance on the right hemisphere for language skills than in the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coppens|first1=P|last2=Hungerford|first2=S|last3=Yamaguchi|first3=S|last4=Yamadori|first4=A|title=Crossed aphasia: an analysis of the symptoms, their frequency, and a comparison with left-hemisphere aphasia symptomatology.|journal=Brain and Language|date=December 2002|volume=83|issue=3|pages=425–63|pmid=12468397|doi=10.1016/s0093-934x(02)00510-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mariën|first1=P|last2=Paghera|first2=B|last3=De Deyn|first3=PP|last4=Vignolo|first4=LA|title=Adult crossed aphasia in dextrals revisited.|journal=Cortex |date=February 2004|volume=40|issue=1|pages=41–74|pmid=15070002|doi=10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70920-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Primary progressive aphasia]] (PPA), while its name can be misleading, is actually a form of dementia that has some symptoms closely related to several forms of aphasia. It is characterized by a gradual loss in language functioning while other cognitive domains are mostly preserved, such as memory and personality. PPA usually initiates with sudden word-finding difficulties in an individual and progresses to a reduced ability to formulate grammatically correct sentences (syntax) and impaired comprehension. The etiology of PPA is not due to a stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), or infectious disease; it is still uncertain what initiates the onset of PPA in those affected by it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Primary Progressive Aphasia|url = http://www.asha.org/Glossary/Primary-Progressive-Aphasia/|website = www.asha.org|accessdate = 2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Epilepsy]] can also include transient aphasia as a [[prodromal]] or episodic symptom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blumenfeld|first1=H|last2=Meador|first2=KJ|title=Consciousness as a useful concept in epilepsy classification.|journal=Epilepsia|date=August 2014|volume=55|issue=8|pages=1145–50|doi=10.1111/epi.12588|pmid=24981294|pmc=4149314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aphasia is also listed as a rare side-effect of the [[fentanyl]] patch, an opioid used to control chronic pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.drugs.com/pro/fentanyl-transdermal.html#A02A9CB6-35CF-4F01-A980-C3733E0F861A |title=Fentanyl Transdermal Official FDA information, side effects and uses |format= |work=Drug Information Online |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Aphasia is best thought of as a collection of different disorders, rather than a single problem. Each individual with aphasia will present with their own particular combination of language strengths and weaknesses. Consequently, it is a major challenge just to document the various difficulties that can occur in different people, let alone decide how they might best be treated. Most classifications of the aphasias tend to divide the various symptoms into broad classes. A common approach is to distinguish between the fluent aphasias (where speech remains fluent, but content may be lacking, and the person may have difficulties understanding others), and the nonfluent aphasias (where speech is very halting and effortful, and may consist of just one or two words at a time).

However, no such broad-based grouping has proven fully adequate. There is wide variation among people even within the same broad grouping, and aphasias can be highly selective. For instance, people with naming deficits (anomic aphasia) might show an inability only for naming buildings, or people, or colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Kolb, Bryan |author2=Whishaw, Ian Q. |title=Fundamentals of human neuropsychology |publisher=Worth |location=[New York] |year=2003 |pages= 502, 505, 511|isbn=0-7167-5300-6 |oclc=464808209 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that there are typical difficulties with speech and language that come with normal aging as well.  As we age language can become more difficult to process resulting in a slowing of verbal comprehension, reading abilities and more likely word finding difficulties. With each of these though, unlike some aphasias, functionality within daily life remains intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Manasco|first1=M.

*Individuals with '''Wernicke's''' aphasia, also referred to as receptive or fluent aphasia, may speak in long sentences that have no meaning, add unnecessary words, and even create new "words" ([[neologism]]s). For example, someone with receptive aphasia may say, "Delicious taco", meaning "The dog needs to go out so I will take him for a walk". They have poor auditory and reading comprehension, and fluent, but nonsensical, oral and written expression. Individuals with receptive aphasia usually have great difficulty understanding the speech of both themselves and others and are, therefore, often unaware of their mistakes. Receptive language deficits usually arise from lesions in the posterior portion of the left hemisphere at or near Wernicke's area.&lt;ref&gt;Manasco, M. H. (2014).

*Individuals with '''Broca's''' aphasia frequently speak short, meaningful phrases that are produced with great effort. It is thus characterized as a nonfluent aphasia. Affected people often omit small words such as "is", "and", and "the". For example, a person with expressive aphasia may say, "Walk dog," which could mean "I will take the dog for a walk", "You take the dog for a walk" or even "The dog walked out of the yard". Individuals with expressive aphasia are able to understand the speech of others to varying degrees. Because of this, they are often aware of their difficulties and can become easily frustrated by their speaking problems.&lt;ref name="Brookshire 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brookshire R |title=Introduction to neurogenic communication disorders (7th edition). St. Louis, MO: Mosby}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Broca's aphasia may appear to be solely an issue with language production, evidence suggests that Broca's aphasia may be rooted in an inability to process syntactical information.&lt;ref&gt;Embick, D., Marantz, A., Miyashita, Y., O'Neil, W., &amp; Sakai, K.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 97(11), 6150-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with Broca's aphasia may have a speech automatism (also called recurring or recurrent utterance. These speech automatisms can be repeated lexical speech automatisms; e.g., modalisations ('I can't..., I can't...'), expletives/swearwords, numbers ('one two, one two') or non-lexical utterances made up of repeated, legal but meaningless, consonant-vowel syllables (e.g.., /tan tan/, /bi bi/). In severe cases the individual may be able to utter only the same speech automatism each time they attempt speech. (examples taken from [Reference for this addition] Code, C. (1982) Neurolinguistic analysis of recurrent utterances in aphasia. '''Cortex''', 18, 141‑152.)
*Individuals with '''anomic''' aphasia have difficulty with naming. People with this aphasia may have difficulties naming certain words, linked by their grammatical type (e.g., difficulty naming verbs and not nouns) or by their [[semantic]] category (e.g., difficulty naming words relating to photography but nothing else) or a more general naming difficulty. People tend to produce grammatic, yet empty, speech. Auditory comprehension tends to be preserved.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Anomic aphasia is the aphasial presentation of tumors in the language zone; it is the aphasial presentation of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aphasia|last1=Alexander|first1=MP|last2=Hillis|first2=AE|work=Handbook of Clinical Neurology|year=2008|&lt;!--accessdate = 2013-06-09 | --&gt;isbn=9780444518972|editors=Georg Goldenberg; Bruce L Miller; Michael J Aminoff; Francois Boller; D F Swaab|edition=1|volume=88|pages=287–310|doi=10.1016/S0072-9752(07)88014-6|oclc=733092630}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anomic aphasia is the mildest form of aphasia, indicating a likely possibility for better recovery.&lt;ref name="Squire 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Squire LR |author2=Dronkers NF |author3=Baldo JV |title=Encyclopedia of neuroscience |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2017}}
*Individuals with '''transcortical sensory''' aphasia, in principle the most general and potentially among the most complex forms of aphasia, may have similar deficits as in receptive aphasia, but their repetition ability may remain intact.
* Global aphasia is considered a severe impairment in many language aspects since it impacts expressive and receptive language, reading, and writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Demeurisse G. |author2=Capon A. | year = 1987 | title = Language recovery in aphasic stroke patients: Clinical, CT and CBF studies | url = | journal = Aphasiology | volume = 1 | issue = 4| pages = 301–315 | doi=10.1080/02687038708248851}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these many deficits, there is evidence that has shown individuals benefited from speech language therapy.&lt;ref name="Basso 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Basso A |author2=Macis M |title=Therapy efficacy in chronic aphasia |journal=Behavioural Neurology |volume=24 |issue=4 |year=2001 |pages=317–325 |doi=10.1155/2011/313480}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though individuals with global aphasia will not become competent speakers, listeners, writers, or readers, goals can be created to improve the individual's quality of life.&lt;ref name = "Brookshire 2007"/&gt; Individuals with global aphasia usually respond well to treatment that includes personally relevant information, which is also important to consider for therapy.&lt;ref name = "Brookshire 2007"/&gt;
*Individuals with '''conduction''' aphasia have deficits in the connections between the speech-comprehension and speech-production areas. This might be caused by damage to the arcuate fasciculus, the structure that transmits information between Wernicke's area and Broca's area. Similar symptoms, however, can be present after damage to the [[insular cortex|insula]] or to the [[auditory cortex]]. Auditory comprehension is near normal, and oral expression is fluent with occasional paraphasic errors. Paraphasic errors include phonemic/literal or semantic/verbal. Repetition ability is poor.   Conduction and transcortical aphasias are caused by damage to the white matter tracts. These aphasias spare the cortex of the language centers but instead create a disconnection between them. Conduction aphasia is caused by damage to the arcuate fasciculus. The arcuate fasciculus is a white matter tract that connects Broca's and Wernicke's areas. People with conduction aphasia typically have good language comprehension, but poor speech repetition and mild difficulty with word retrieval and speech production. People with conduction aphasia are typically aware of their errors.&lt;ref name = "Brookshire 2007"/&gt; Two forms of conduction aphasia have been described: ''reproduction conduction aphasia'' (repetition of a single relatively unfamiliar multisyllabic word) and ''repetitionconduction aphasia'' (repetition of unconnected short familiar words (Reference: Shallice, T,. &amp; Warrington., E.K. (1977), Auditory-verbal short term memory impairment and conduction aphasia. Brain and Language, 3, 209-228.)
* Transcortical aphasias include transcortical motor aphasia, transcortical sensory aphasia, and mixed transcortical aphasia. People with transcortical motor aphasia typically have intact comprehension and awareness of their errors, but poor word finding and speech production. People with transcortical sensory and mixed transcortical aphasia have poor comprehension and unawareness of their errors.&lt;ref name = "Brookshire 2007"/&gt; Despite poor comprehension and more severe deficits in some transcortical aphasias, small studies have indicated that full recovery is possible for all types of transcortical aphasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Flamand-Roze C. |author2=Cauquil-Michon C. |author3=Roze E. |author4=Souillard-Scemama R. |author5=Maintigneux L. |author6=Ducreux D. |author7=Adams D. |author8=Denier C. | year = 2011 | title = Aphasia in border-zone infarcts has a specific initial pattern and good long-term prognosis | url = | journal = European Journal of Neurology | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 1397–1401 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-1331.2011.03422.x | pmid=21554494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical-localizationist approaches===
[[Image:BrocasAreaSmall.png|thumb|Cortex]]
Localizationist approaches aim to classify the aphasias according to their major presenting characteristics and the regions of the brain that most probably gave rise to them.&lt;ref name="Goodglass, H. 2001"&gt;Goodglass, H., Kaplan, E., &amp; Barresi, B. (2001). The assessment of aphasia and related disorders. Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kertesz, A. (2006). Western Aphasia Battery-Revised (WAB-R). Austin, TX: Pro-Ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the early work of nineteenth-century neurologists [[Paul Broca]] and [[Carl Wernicke]], these approaches identify two major subtypes of aphasia and several more minor subtypes:

* [[Expressive aphasia]] (also known as "motor aphasia" or "Broca's aphasia"), which is characterized by halted, fragmented, effortful speech, but well-preserved comprehension ''relative to expression''. Damage is typically in the anterior portion of the left hemisphere,&lt;ref name="Common Classifications of Aphasia"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Common Classifications of Aphasia|url = http://www.asha.org/Practice-Portal/Clinical-Topics/Aphasia/Common-Classifications-of-Aphasia/|website = www.asha.org|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably [[Broca's area]]. Individuals with Broca's aphasia often have [[hemiplegia|right-sided weakness]] or paralysis of the arm and leg, because the left frontal lobe is also important for body movement, particularly on the right side.
* [[Receptive aphasia]] (also known as "sensory aphasia" or "Wernicke's aphasia"), which is characterized by fluent speech, but marked difficulties understanding words and sentences. Although fluent, the speech may lack in key substantive words (nouns, verbs, adjectives), and may contain incorrect words or even nonsense words. This subtype has been associated with damage to the posterior left temporal cortex, most notably Wernicke's area. These individuals usually have no body weakness, because their brain injury is not near the parts of the brain that control movement.
* [[Conduction aphasia]], where speech remains fluent, and comprehension is preserved, but the person may have disproportionate difficulty where repeating words or sentences. Damage typically involves the [[arcuate fasciculus]] and the left parietal region.&lt;ref name="Common Classifications of Aphasia"/&gt;
* [[Transcortical motor aphasia]] and [[transcortical sensory aphasia]], which are similar to Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia respectively, but the ability to repeat words and sentences is disproportionately preserved.

Recent classification schemes adopting this approach, such as the "Boston-Neoclassical Model",&lt;ref name="Goodglass, H. 2001"/&gt; also group these classical aphasia subtypes into two larger classes: the nonfluent aphasias (which encompasses Broca's aphasia and transcortical motor aphasia) and the fluent aphasias (which encompasses Wernicke's aphasia, conduction aphasia and transcortical sensory aphasia). These schemes also identify several further aphasia subtypes, including: [[anomic aphasia]], which is characterized by a selective difficulty finding the names for things; and [[global aphasia]], where both expression and comprehension of speech are severely compromised.

Many localizationist approaches also recognize the existence of additional, more "pure" forms of language disorder that may affect only a single language skill.&lt;ref name="KolbWhishaw1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Fundamentals of human neuropsychology|author1=Kolb, Bryan|author2=Whishaw, Ian Q.|publisher=Worth|year=2003|isbn=0-7167-5300-6|location=[New York]|pages=502–504|oclc=464808209}}&lt;!-- The whole paragraph "fluent, non-fluent and pure aphasias" is written with help of this reference.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[pure alexia]], a person may be able to write but not read, and in [[pure word deafness]], they may be able to produce speech and to read, but not understand speech when it is spoken to them.

===Cognitive neuropsychological approaches===
Although localizationist approaches provide a useful way of classifying the different patterns of language difficulty into broad groups, one problem is that a sizeable number of individuals do not fit neatly into one category or another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Godefroy O. |author2=Dubois C. |author3=Debachy B. |author4=Leclerc M. |author5=Kreisler A. | year = 2002 | title = Vascular aphasias: main characteristics of patients hospitalized in acute stroke units | url = | journal = Stroke | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 702–705 | doi=10.1161/hs0302.103653}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ross K.B. |author2=Wertz R.T. | year = 2001 | title = Type and severity of aphasia during the first seven months poststroke | url = | journal = Journal of Medical Speech-Language Pathology | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 31–53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another problem is that the categories, particularly the major ones such as Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia, still remain quite broad. Consequently, even amongst individuals who meet the criteria for classification into a subtype, there can be enormous variability in the types of difficulties they experience.

Instead of categorizing every individual into a specific subtype, cognitive neuropsychological approaches aim to identify the key language skills or "modules" that are not functioning properly in each individual. A person could potentially have difficulty with just one module, or with a number of modules. This type of approach requires a framework or theory as to what skills/modules are needed to perform different kinds of language tasks. For example, the model of [[Max Coltheart]] identifies a module that recognizes [[phonemes]] as they are spoken, which is essential for any task involving recognition of words. Similarly, there is a module that stores phonemes that the person is planning to produce in speech, and this module is critical for any task involving the production of long words or long strings of speech. Once a theoretical framework has been established, the functioning of each module can then be assessed using a specific test or set of tests. In the clinical setting, use of this model usually involves conducting a battery of assessments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Coltheart, Max |author2=Kay, Janice |author3=Lesser, Ruth |title=PALPA psycholinguistic assessments of language processing in aphasia |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |location=Hillsdale, N.J |year=1992 |pages= |isbn=0-86377-166-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Porter, G., &amp; Howard, D. (2004). CAT: comprehensive aphasia test. Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; each of which tests one or a number of these modules. Once a diagnosis is reached as to the skills/modules where the most significant impairment lies, therapy can proceed to treat these skills.

===Progressive aphasias===
[[Primary progressive aphasia]] (PPA) is a neurodegenerative focal dementia that can be associated with progressive illnesses or dementia, such as 
[[frontotemporal dementia]] / [[Pick's disease|Pick Complex]] [[Motor neuron disease]], [[Progressive supranuclear palsy]], and [[Alzheimer's disease]], which is the gradual process of progressively losing the ability to think. Gradual loss of language function occurs in the context of relatively well-preserved memory, visual processing, and personality until the advanced stages. Symptoms usually begin with word-finding problems (naming) and progress to impaired grammar (syntax) and comprehension (sentence processing and semantics).&lt;American Speech-Language-Hearing Association&gt; The loss of language before the loss of memory differentiates PPA from typical dementias. People suffering from PPA may have difficulties comprehending what others are saying. They can also have difficulty trying to find the right words to make a sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mesulam MM |title=Primary progressive aphasia |journal=Ann.

[[Jargon aphasia|Progressive Jargon Aphasia]]{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}  is a fluent or receptive aphasia in which the person's [[Speech communication|speech]] is incomprehensible, but appears to make sense to them. Speech is fluent and effortless with intact [[syntax]] and [[grammar]], but the person has problems with the selection of [[noun]]s. Either they will replace the desired word with another that sounds or looks like the original one or has some other connection or they will replace it with [[sound]]s. As such, people with jargon aphasia often use [[neologism]]s, and may [[perseveration|perseverate]] if they try to replace the words they cannot find with sounds. Substitutions commonly involve picking another (actual) word starting with the same sound (e.g., clocktower - colander), picking another semantically related to the first (e.g., letter - scroll), or picking one phonetically similar to the intended one (e.g., lane - late).

===Deaf aphasia===
There have been many instances showing that there is a form of aphasia among deaf individuals. Sign languages are, after all, forms of language that have been shown to use the same areas of the brain as verbal forms of language. Mirror neurons become activated when an animal is acting in a particular way or watching another individual act in the same manner. These mirror neurons are important in giving an individual the ability to mimic movements of hands. Broca's area of speech production has been shown to contain several of these mirror neurons resulting in significant similarities of brain activity between sign language and vocal speech communication. Facial communication is a significant portion of how animals interact with each other. Humans use facial movements to create, what other humans perceive, to be faces of emotions. While combining these facial movements with speech, a more full form of language is created which enables the species to interact with a much more complex and detailed form of communication. Sign language also uses these facial movements and emotions along with the primary hand movement way of communicating. These facial movement forms of communication come from the same areas of the brain. When dealing with damages to certain areas of the brain, vocal forms of communication are in jeopardy of severe forms of aphasia. Since these same areas of the brain are being used for sign language, these same, at least very similar, forms of aphasia can show in the Deaf community. Individuals can show a form of Wernicke's aphasia with sign language and they show deficits in their abilities in being able to produce any form of expressions. Broca's aphasia shows up in some people, as well. These individuals find tremendous difficulty in being able to actually sign the linguistic concepts they are trying to express.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Neil|title=Physiology of Behavior|year=2013|publisher=Pearson|location=New York|pages=494–496}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Severity ===
The severity of the type of aphasia varies depending on the size of the stroke. However, there is much variance between how often one type of severity occurs in certain types of aphasia. &amp;nbsp;For instance, any type of aphasia can range from mild to profound. Regardless of the severity of aphasia, people can make improvements due to spontaneous recovery and treatment in the acute stages of recovery.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Klebic et al. (2011) found that people with severe aphasia improved after receiving therapy for a year, consequently reducing the severity of their aphasia.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Additionally, while most studies propose that the greatest outcomes occur in people with severe aphasia when treatment is provided in the acute stages of recovery, Robey (1998) also found that those with severe aphasia are capable of making strong language gains in the chronic stage of recovery as well.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This finding implies that persons with aphasia have the potential to have functional outcomes regardless of how severe their aphasia may be.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; While there is no distinct pattern of the outcomes of aphasia based on severity alone, global aphasia typically makes functional language gains, but may be gradual since global aphasia affects many language areas.

==Prevention==
Following are some precautions that should be taken to avoid aphasia, by decreasing the risk of stroke, the main cause of aphasia:
* Exercising regularly
* Eating a healthy diet
* Keeping alcohol consumption low and avoiding tobacco use
* Controlling blood pressure&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Management==

When addressing Wernicke's aphasia, according to Bakheit et al. (2007), the lack of awareness of the language impairments, a common characteristic of Wernicke's aphasia, may affect the rate and extent of therapy outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0269215507078452 |pmid=17981853 |title=The rate and extent of improvement with therapy from the different types of aphasia in the first year after stroke |journal=Clinical Rehabilitation |volume=21 |issue=10 |pages=941–9 |year=2016 |last1=Bakheit |first1=A.M.O |last2=Shaw |first2=S |last3=Carrington |first3=S |last4=Griffiths |first4=S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Klebic et al. (2011) suggests that people benefit from continuing therapy upon discharge from the hospital to ensure generalization.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.5455/medarh.2011.65.283-286 |pmid=22073852 |title=Aphasia Disorders Outcome After Stroke |journal=Acta Informatica Medica |volume=65 |issue=5 |pages=283–6 |year=2011 |last1=Klebic |first1=Jasmina |last2=Salihovic |first2=Nevzeta |last3=Softic |first3=Rusmir |last4=Salihovic |first4=Denisa }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robey (1998) determined that at least 2 hours of treatment per week is recommended for making significant language gains.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1044/jslhr.4101.172 |pmid=9493743 |title=A Meta-Analysis of Clinical Outcomes in the Treatment of Aphasia |journal=Journal of Speech Language and Hearing Research |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=172–87 |year=1998 |last1=Robey |first1=Randall R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spontaneous recovery may cause some language gains, but without speech-language therapy, the outcomes can be half as strong as those with therapy.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

When addressing Broca's aphasia, better outcomes occur when the person participates in therapy, and treatment is more effective than no treatment for people in the acute period.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Two or more hours of therapy per week in acute and post-acute stages produced the greatest results.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; High-intensity therapy was most effective, and low-intensity therapy was almost equivalent to no therapy.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

People with global aphasia are sometimes referred to as having irreversible aphasic syndrome, often making limited gains in auditory comprehension, and recovering no functional language modality with therapy. With this said, people with global aphasia may retain gestural communication skills that may enable success when communicating with conversational partners within familiar conditions. Process-oriented treatment options are limited, and people may not become competent language users as readers, listeners, writers, or speakers no matter how extensive therapy is.&lt;ref name="Brookshire 2007" /&gt; However, people's daily routines and quality of life can be enhanced with reasonable and modest goals.&lt;ref name="Brookshire 2007" /&gt;  After the first month, there is limited to no healing to language abilities of most people. There is a grim prognosis leaving 83% who were globally aphasic after the first month they will remain globally aphasic at the first year. Some people are so severely impaired that their existing process-oriented treatment approaches offer signs of progress, and therefore cannot justify the cost of therapy.&lt;ref name="Brookshire 2007" /&gt;

Perhaps due to the relative rareness of conduction aphasia, few studies have specifically studied the effectiveness of therapy for people with this type of aphasia. From the studies performed, results showed that therapy can help to improve specific language outcomes. One intervention that has had positive results is auditory repetition training. Kohn et al. (1990) reported that drilled auditory repetition training related to improvements in spontaneous speech, Francis et al. (2003) reported improvements in sentence comprehension, and Kalinyak-Fliszar et al. (2011) reported improvements in auditory-visual short-term memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/02687038.2011.577284 |pmid=22791930 |pmc=3393127 |title=Remediation of language processing in aphasia: Improving activation and maintenance of linguistic representations in (verbal) short-term memory |journal=Aphasiology |volume=25 |issue=10 |pages=1095–1131 |year=2011 |last1=Kalinyak-Fliszar |first1=Michelene |last2=Kohen |first2=Francine |last3=Martin |first3=Nadine }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/02687030344000201 |title=The treatment of an auditory working memory deficit and the implications for sentence comprehension abilities in mild 'receptive' aphasia |journal=Aphasiology |volume=17 |issue=8 |pages=723–50 |year=2003 |last1=Francis |first1=Dawn |last2=Clark |first2=Nina |last3=Humphreys |first3=Glyn }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3109/13682829009011962 |pmid=1695853 |title=The remediation of conduction aphasia via sentence repetition: A case study |journal=International Journal of Language &amp; Communication Disorders |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=45–60 |year=1990 |last1=Kohn |first1=Susan E |last2=Smith |first2=Katherine L |last3=Arsenault |first3=Joan Kelly }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most acute cases of aphasia recover some or most skills by working with a speech-language pathologist. Recovery and improvement can continue for years after the stroke. After the onset of Aphasia, there is approximately a six-month period of spontaneous recovery; during this time, the brain is attempting to recover and repair the damaged neurons. Improvement varies widely, depending on the aphasia's cause, type, and severity. Recovery also depends on the person's age, health, motivation, [[handedness]], and educational level.&lt;ref name = "medicinenet.com" /&gt;

There is no one treatment proven to be effective for all types of aphasias. The reason that there is no universal treatment for aphasia is because of the nature of the disorder and the various ways it is presented, as explained in the above sections. Aphasia is rarely exhibited identically, implying that treatment needs to be catered specifically to the individual. Studies have shown that, although there is no consistency on treatment methodology in literature, there is a strong indication that treatment, in general, has positive outcomes.&lt;ref name= "Schmitz O'Sullivan 2007"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Schmitz, Thomas J. |author2=O'Sullivan, Susan B. |title=Physical rehabilitation |publisher=F.A. Davis |location=Philadelphia |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-8036-1247-8 |oclc= 70119705 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therapy for aphasia ranges from increasing functional communication to improving speech accuracy, depending on the person's severity, needs and support of family and friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/PRPSpecificTopic.aspx?folderid=8589934663&amp;section=Treatment|title=Aphasia|work=asha.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Group therapy allows individuals to work on their pragmatic and communication skills with other individuals with aphasia, which are skills that may not often be addressed in individual one-on-one therapy sessions. It can also help increase confidence and social skills in a comfortable setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Manasco|first1=M. Hunter|title=Introduction to Neurogenic Communication Disorders|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=9781449652449|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence does not support the use of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for improving aphasia after stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elsner|first1=B|last2=Kugler|first2=J|last3=Pohl|first3=M|last4=Mehrholz|first4=J|title=Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for improving aphasia in patients with aphasia after stroke|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=2015|issue=5|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009760.pub3|pmid=25929694}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific treatment techniques include the following:
*Copy and Recall Therapy (CART) - repetition and recall of targeted words within therapy may strengthen orthographic representations and improve single word reading, writing, and naming&lt;ref&gt;Beeson, P. M., Egnor, H. (2007), Combining treatment for written and spoken naming, Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society, 12(6); 816-827.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Visual Communication Therapy (VIC) - the use of index cards with symbols to represent various components of speech
*Visual Action Therapy (VAT) - typically treats individuals with global aphasia to train the use of hand gestures for specific items&lt;ref&gt;"Aphasia". American Speech Language Hearing Association. Retrieved from http://www.asha.org/PRPSpecificTopic.aspx?folderid=8589934663&amp;section=Treatment&lt;/ref&gt;
*Functional Communication Treatment (FCT) - focuses on improving activities specific to functional tasks, social interaction, and self-expression
*Promoting Aphasic's Communicative Effectiveness (PACE) - a means of encouraging normal interaction between people with aphasia and clinicians. In this kind of therapy, the focus is on pragmatic communication rather than treatment itself. People are asked to communicate a given message to their therapists by means of drawing, making hand gestures or even pointing to an object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Alexander | first1 = MP | last2 = Hillis | first2 = AE | title = Neuropsychology and Behavioral Neurology: Handbook of Clinical Neurology | chapter = Aphasia | volume = 88 | editors = Georg Goldenberg; Bruce L Miller; Michael J Aminoff; Francois Boller; D F Swaab | publisher = Elsevier Health Sciences | year = 2008 | pages = 287–310 | &lt;!--accessdate = 2012-04-24 | --&gt;isbn = 978-0-444-51897-2 | oclc= 733092630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Semantic feature analysis (SFA) -a type of aphasia treatment that targets word-finding deficits. It is based on the theory that neural connections can be strengthened by using related words and phrases that are similar to the target word, to eventually activate the target word in the brain.  SFA can be implemented in multiple forms such as verbally, written, using picture cards, etc.  The SLP provides prompting questions to the individual with aphasia in order for the person to name the picture provided.&lt;ref&gt;Davis &amp; Stanton, 2005.  Semantic Feature Analysis as a Functional Therapy Tool. ''Contemporary Issues In Communication Science and Disorders." 35, 85-92.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show that SFA is an effective intervention for improving confrontational naming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maddy|first=K.M.|last2=Capilouto|first2=G.J.|last3=McComas|first3=K.L.|title=The effectiveness of semantic feature analysis: An evidence-based systematic review|journal=Annals of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine|volume=57|issue=4|pages=254–267|doi=10.1016/j.rehab.2014.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Melodic intonation therapy]] is used to treat non-fluent aphasia and has proved to be effective in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Norton A, Zipse L, Marchina S, Schlaug G |title=Melodic Intonation Therapy: shared insights on how it is done and why it might help |journal=Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. |volume=1169 |issue= |pages=431–6 |date=July 2009 |pmid=19673819 |pmc=2780359 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04859.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is still no evidence from [[randomized controlled trial]]s confirming the efficacy of MIT in chronic aphasia. MIT is used to help people with aphasia vocalize themselves through speech song, which is then transferred as a spoken word. Good candidates for this therapy include people who have had left hemisphere strokes, non-fluent aphasias such as Broca's, good auditory comprehension, poor repetition and articulation, and good emotional stability and memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van der Meulen|first1=I|last2=van de Sandt-Koenderman|first2=ME|last3=Ribbers|first3=GM|title=Melodic Intonation Therapy: present controversies and future opportunities|journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation|date=January 2012|volume=93|issue=1 Suppl|pages=S46-52|pmid=22202191|doi=10.1016/j.apmr.2011.05.029}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative explanation is that the efficacy of MIT depends on neural circuits involved in the processing of rhythmicity and [[formulaic language|formulaic expressions]] (examples taken from the MIT manual: “I am fine,” “how are you?” or “thank you”); while rhythmic features associated with melodic intonation may engage primarily left-hemisphere subcortical areas of the brain, the use of formulaic expressions is known to be supported by right-hemisphere cortical and bilateral subcortical neural networks.&lt;ref name = "Sidtis 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stahl|first1=B|last2=Kotz|first2=SA|title=Facing the music: Three issues in current research on singing and aphasia|journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=5 |issue=1033 |year=2013 |pages=1–4 |issn=1664-1078 |doi= 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), involving family with the treatment of an Aphasic loved one is ideal for all involved, because while it will no doubt assist in their recovery, it will also make it easier for members of the family to learn how best to communicate with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/aphasia |title=Aphasia |website=National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders |access-date=December 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a person's speech is insufficient, different kinds of [[augmentative and alternative communication]] could be considered such as alphabet boards, pictorial communication books, specialized software for computers or apps for tablets or smartphones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Russo|first=Maria Julieta|date=2017|title=High-technology Augmentative Communication for adults with post-stroke aphasia: a systematic review|url=|journal=Expert Review of Medical Devices|volume=April 26|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Intensity of treatment===
The intensity of aphasia therapy is determined by the length of each session, total hours of therapy per week, and total weeks of therapy provided. There is no consensus about what “intense” aphasia therapy entails, or how intense therapy should be to yield the best outcomes. A 2016 Cochrane review of speech and language therapy for people with aphasia found that treatments that are higher intensity, higher dose or over a long duration of time led to significantly better functional communication but people were more likely to drop out of high intensity treatment (up to 15 hours per week).&lt;ref name="Brady2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brady|first1=MC|last2=Kelly|first2=H|last3=Godwin|first3=J|last4=Enderby|first4=P|last5=Campbell|first5=P|title=Speech and language therapy for aphasia following stroke.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=1 June 2016|issue=6|pages=CD000425|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000425.pub4|pmid=27245310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intensity of therapy is also dependent on the recency of stroke. People with aphasia react differently to intense treatment in the acute phase (0–3 months post stroke), sub-acute phase (3–6 months post stroke), or chronic phase (6+ months post stroke). Intensive therapy has been found to be effective for people with nonfluent and fluent chronic aphasia, but less effective for people with acute aphasia.&lt;ref name="Cherney 2011" /&gt;&gt; People with sub-acute aphasia also respond well to intensive therapy of 100 hours over 62 weeks.  This suggests people in the sub-acute phase can improve greatly in language and functional communication measures with intensive therapy compared to regular therapy.&lt;ref name="Cherney 2011" /&gt;

===Individualized service delivery===

Intensity of treatment should be individualized based on the recency of stroke, therapy goals, and other specific characteristics such as age, size of lesion, overall health status, and motivation.&lt;ref name="Cherney 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cherney LR |author2=Patterson JP | author3=Raymer AM |title=Intensity of aphasia therapy: Evidence and efficacy |journal=Current Neurology and Neuroscience Reports |volume=11 |issue=6 |year=2011 |pages=560–569 |doi=10.1007/s11910-011-0227-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sage 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sage K |author2=Snell C | author3=Lambon Ralph MA |title=How intensive does anomia therapy for people with aphasia need to be? |journal=Neuropsychological Rehabilitation |volume=21 |issue=1 |year=2011 |pages=26–41 |doi=10.1080/09602011.2010.528966}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each individual reacts differently to treatment intensity and is able to tolerate treatment at different times post-stroke.&lt;ref name="Sage 2011" /&gt;  Intensity of treatment after a stroke should be dependent on the person's motivation, stamina, and tolerance for therapy.&lt;ref name="Palmer 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Palmer R|year=2015|title=Innovations in aphasia treatment after stroke: Technology to the rescue|journal=British Journal of Neuroscience Nursing|volume=38|pages=38–42|doi=10.12968/bjnn.2015.11.sup2.38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes==

If the symptoms of aphasia last longer than two or three months after a stroke, a complete recovery is unlikely. However, it is important to note that some people continue to improve over a period of years and even decades. Improvement is a slow process that usually involves both helping the individual and family understand the nature of aphasia and learning compensatory strategies for communicating. {{cite web |url=http://www.aphasia.org/aphasia-faqs/ |title=Aphasia FAQs |website=National Aphasia Association |access-date=December 16, 2017}}

After a traumatic brain injury (TBI) or cerebrovascular accident (CVA), the brain undergoes several healing and re-organization processes, which may result in improved language function. This is referred to as spontaneous recovery. Spontaneous recovery is the natural recovery the brain makes without treatment, and the brain begins to reorganize and change in order to recover.&lt;ref name="Brookshire 2007" /&gt; There are several factors that contribute to a person's chance of recovery caused by stroke, including stroke size and location.&lt;ref name=M2015/&gt; Age, sex, and education have not been found to be very predictive.&lt;ref name=M2015/&gt;

Specific to aphasia, spontaneous recovery varies among affected people and may not look the same in everyone, making it difficult to predict recovery.&lt;ref name=M2015&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jns.2015.03.020 |pmid=25888529 |title=Factors predicting post-stroke aphasia recovery |journal=Journal of the Neurological Sciences |volume=352 |issue=1–2 |pages=12–8 |year=2015 |last1=Watila |first1=M. M. |last2=Balarabe |first2=S. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though some cases of Wernicke's aphasia have shown greater improvements than more mild forms of aphasia, people with Wernicke's aphasia may not reach as high a level of speech abilities as those with mild forms of aphasia.&lt;ref name="Laska 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Laska AC |author2=Hellblom A |author3=Murray V |author4=Kahan T | author5=Arbin M |title=Aphasia in acute stroke and relation to outcome |journal=Journal of Internal Medicine |volume=249 |year=2001 |pages=413–422 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2796.2001.00812.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first recorded case of aphasia is from an Egyptian [[papyrus]], the [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]], which details speech problems in a person with a [[traumatic brain injury]] to the [[temporal lobe]].&lt;ref name=McCrory&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1212/WNL.57.12.2283 |pmid=11756611 |title=Concussion: The history of clinical and pathophysiological concepts and misconceptions |journal=Neurology |volume=57 |issue=12 |pages=2283–9 |year=2001 |last1=McCrory |first1=P. R |last2=Berkovic |first2=S. F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second half of the 19th century, aphasia was a major focus for scientists and philosophers who were working in the beginning stages of the field of psychology.&lt;ref name="Damasio 1992"/&gt;
In medical research, speechlessness was described as an incorrect prognosis, and there was no assumption that underlying language complications existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1016/S0072-9752(08)02136-2 |chapter=Chapter 36 History of aphasia |title=History of Neurology |volume=95 |pages=571–82 |series=Handbook of Clinical Neurology |year=2009 |last1=Eling |first1=Paul |last2=Whitaker |first2=Harry |isbn=978-0-444-52009-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Broca and his colleagues were some of the first to write about aphasia, but Wernicke was the first credited to have written extensively about aphasia being a disorder that contained comprehension difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boller|first=F.|date=|title=Johann Baptiste Schmidt: a pioneer in the history of aphasia|url=|journal=Archives of Neurology|volume=34|pages=306–307|doi=10.1001/archneur.1977.00500170060011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite claims of who reported on aphasia first, it was F.J. Gall that gave the first full description of aphasia after studying wounds to the brain, as well as his observation of speech difficulties resulting from vascular lesions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riese|first=W.|date=1947-05-01|title=The early history of aphasia|journal=Bulletin of the History of Medicine|volume=21|issue=3|pages=322–334|issn=0007-5140|pmid=20257374}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent book on the entire history of aphasia is available (Reference: Tesak, J. &amp; Code, C. (2008) '''Milestones in the History of Aphasia: Theories and Protagonists.'''Hove, East Sussex: Psychology Press.)

===Etymology===
''Aphasia'' is from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[Privative a|''a-'']] ("without") + ''phásis'' (''φάσις'', "speech").

The word ''aphasia'' comes from the word ἀφασία ''aphasia'', in [[Ancient Greek]], which means&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/217487.php|title=What is aphasia? What causes aphasia?|work=Medical News Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; "speechlessness",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29fa%29si%2Fa ἀφασία], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus.&lt;/ref&gt; derived from ἄφατος ''aphatos'', "speechless"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Da)%2Ffatos ἄφατος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus.&lt;/ref&gt; from ἀ- ''a-'', "not, un" and φημί ''phemi'', "I speak".

==Further research==

Research is currently being done using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to witness the difference in how language is processed in normal brains vs aphasic brains. This will help researchers to understand exactly what the brain must go through in order to recover from Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and how different areas of the brain respond after such an injury.

Another intriguing approach being tested is that of drug therapy. Research is in progress that will hopefully uncover whether or not certain drugs might be used in addition to speech-language therapy in order to facilitate recovery of proper language function. It's possible that the best treatment for Aphasia might involve combining drug treatment with therapy, instead of relying on one over the other.

One other method being researched as a potential therapeutic combination with speech-language therapy is brain stimulation. One particular method, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), alters brain activity in whatever area it happens to stimulate, which has recently led scientists to wonder if this shift in brain function caused by TMS might help people re-learn languages.

The research being put into Aphasia has only just begun. Researchers appear to have multiple ideas on how Aphasia could be more effectively treated in the future. {{cite web |url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/aphasia |title=Aphasia |website=National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders |access-date=December 16, 2017}}

An '''archaeological [[open-air museum]]''' is a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] permanent institution with outdoor true-to-scale [[Architecture|architectural]] reconstructions primarily based on [[Archaeology|archaeological]] sources. It holds collections of [[Intangible cultural heritage|intangible heritage resources]] and provides an interpretation of how people lived and acted in the past; this is accomplished according to sound scientific methods for the purposes of [[education]], study and enjoyment of its visitors.

==Components==
[[File:Colonial Williamsburg Thomas Jefferson Reenactment DSCN7269.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Thomas Jefferson]] reenactment by actor Bill Barker at ([[Colonial Williamsburg]], United States)]]

The above definition was made by [[EXARC]], using [[International Council of Museums|ICOM]]'s definition of museums. By that time [[Roeland Paardekooper]] was their director. Further explanation of its components:

*''Museum'' – "A museum is a non-profit, permanent institution in the service of society and its development, open to the public, which acquires, conserves, researches, communicates and exhibits the tangible and intangible heritage of humanity and its environment for the purposes of education, study and enjoyment."&lt;ref&gt;ICOM Statutes, approved in Vienna (Austria) – 24 August 2007. Art. 3, Section 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Professional practice and performance in archaeological open-air museums should respect the ICOM Code of Ethics for Museums.&lt;ref&gt;ICOM 2006, www.icom.museum&lt;/ref&gt;
*''True to scale architectural reconstructions in the open air'' – Archaeological open-air museums deal with outdoor true to scale reconstructed buildings. These can be constructed and interpreted only under the condition that: "the original buildings of the type portrayed are no longer available (and) the copies or reconstructions are made according to the strictest scientific methods".&lt;ref&gt;ICOM declaration: 9 July 1956/1957 Geneva, section 6&lt;/ref&gt; The authenticity of materials and techniques used should be clearly accounted for through written and accessible records, quoting the sources of information on which the reconstructions are based. An honest assessment of each reconstruction should be feasible.
*''Collections of intangible heritage resources'' – The overall presentation of an archaeological open-air museum can be regarded (classified/defined) as a collection of intangible heritage resources which provides an interpretation of how people lived and acted with reference to a specific context of time and place.
*''Connected to scientific research'' – The connection between scientific research and any specific archaeological open-air museum is provided by the active role of a trained archaeologist among the staff or an archaeological counsellor belonging to an affiliated organisation.
*''Appropriate interpretation with organisation of activities for visitors'' – Depending on the nature and number of visitors, different kinds of interpretation can be appropriate. These activities can involve (but are not limited to) guided tours, educational programmes, presentation of [[experimental archaeology]] research, demonstrations of ancient crafts and techniques, live interpretation and living history activities.

[[File:F07 0054.Ma.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Bison carved on reindeer [[antler]] fragment, National Museum of Prehistory in [[Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil]]]]
'''''Bison Licking Insect Bite''''' is a [[prehistoric art|prehistoric carving]] from the [[Upper Paleolithic]], found at [[Abri de la Madeleine]] near [[Tursac]] in [[Dordogne]], France, the [[type-site]] of the [[Magdalenian]] culture, which produced many fine small carvings in antler or bone.

Created sometime between 20,000 and 12,000 [[Before present|BP]] (15,000 BP according to the museum), it was formerly in the [[National Archaeological Museum (France)|Musee des Antiquites Nationales]], [[St. Germain-en-Laye]], but has been transferred to the expanded National Museum of Prehistory in [[Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil]] that opened in 2004, not far from its findspot. It is a carved and engraved fragment of a [[spear-thrower]] made of [[reindeer]] antler. It depicts the figure of a [[bison]], of the now extinct species [[steppe wisent]] (''bison priscus'') with its head turned around and showing its tongue extended. It is thought the spear-thrower was broken into roughly its present shape before the carving was made from the fragment, hence the need to show the turned-back head of the animal in order to fit the existing structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://musee-prehistoire-eyzies.fr/en/collection/tid-4/cid-5/collection-bison-se-lechant, "Collections", National Museum of Prehistory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430045958/http://musee-prehistoire-eyzies.fr/en/collection/tid-4/cid-5/collection-bison-se-lechant%2C |date=2015-04-30 }} in Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Charter of  Alliance''' ({{lang-tr|Sened-i İttifak}}), also known as  '''Deed of Agreement''' was a treaty between the [[grand vizier]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and a number of powerful local rulers signed in 1808, in an attempt to regulate their power and relations with the central Ottoman government.

== Background ==
In the Ottoman Empire, agricultural land was considered to be the sultan's private estate. These estates ({{lang-tr|dirlik}}) were granted  to cavalrymen ({{lang-tr|tımarlı sipahi}}, "[[timariot]] [[sipahi]]s") in return for their military services during war. The system was similar to the [[fief]] system of [[Medieval Europe]], except that the land was non-inheritable, precluding the rise of [[feudalism]] in the Ottoman Empire. However during the [[Decline of the Ottoman Empire|Empire's decline]] in the 18th century, two factors provoked a kind of feudalism:
*The advance in military technology, which rendered the Ottoman cavalry far less effective.
*Loss of profitable land and almost continuous wars forced the [[Ottoman Porte]] to collect more tax and to appoint tax collectors to provinces.

The cavalrymen were replaced by the tax collectors and local military rulers who were called [[derebey]]s ("river lords") or '''ayan'''. These powerful local leaders formed de facto local dynasties supported by considerable military power. By the end of the 18th century, the authority of the sultan had become almost non-existent outside the capital [[Istanbul]], and the empire had become highly decentralized.

== Alemdar Mustafa's rise to Grand Vizier ==

[[Alemdar Mustafa Pasha]] an ayan in [[Rusçuk]] (Ruse, [[Bulgaria]]) was supporting the reformist Sultan [[Selim III]] (reigned 1789–1807). After Selim III was dethroned, Alemdar marched to Istanbul to reenthrone Selim III. However Selim had been killed by the new Sultan [[Mustafa IV]]. Alemdar dethroned Mustafa IV and enthroned his brother [[Mahmut II]] (reigned 1808–1839). To show gratitude, Mahmut II appointed Alemdar as his grand vizier.

== The Charter of Alliance ==
Originally one of the ayans himself, Alemdar tried to end the chaos in the empire by a treaty. He invited other ayans to [[Istanbul]]. Although only four of them showed up, Alemdar and they signed a document called the "Charter of Alliance" ({{lang-tr|Sened’i İttifak}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anayasa.gen.tr/senediittifak.htm Constitution page {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; on 29 September 1808. The terms were
# The ayans promised to show respect to the Sultan.
# The ayans agreed to assign their military units in the Sultan's army.
# The ayans promised to help to protect the Sultan’s treasury.
# The ayans promised to obey the orders given by the Grand Vizier under the condition that the orders were not illegal. The ayans also agreed not to interfere in other ayans' sphere of influence.
# The Porte legitimised the ayans and their estates. Furthermore, the estates were declared inheritable.
# The ayans promised to support the Sultan against revolts.
# The Grand Vizier promised to consult with the ayans to solve taxation problems, while ayans promised not to oppress the poor.

== Aftermath ==
According to some historians,&lt;ref name="Aksin"&gt;Sina Akşin: ''Türkiye Tarihi'', Cem yayınevi,İstanbul, 2009, vol 3 {{ISBN|975-406-565-9}}, p 95&lt;/ref&gt; the Charter of  Alliance was a form of Turkish [[Magna Carta]]. Others, however;&lt;ref name="Aksin"/&gt; point out that the Charter, signed in the first half of the 19th century, can't be compared to the Magna Carta of the 13th century.

In any case, the Charter was short-lived. According to the treaty, Alemdar's successors would also sign the treaty. But after Alemdar's death no Grand Vizier ratified the treaty, probably due to the sultan's only half-hearted support to it.&lt;ref&gt;Lord Kinross: ''The Ottoman centuries'' (trans:Meral Gaspıralı) Altın Kitaplar,İstanbul, 2008,{{ISBN|978-975-21-0955-1}}, p 438&lt;/ref&gt; The Sultan saw this treaty as a challenge to his prestige.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Yaşar Yüce-Prof. Ali Sevim: ''Türkiye tarihi Cilt IV'', AKDTYKTTK Yayınları, İstanbul, 1991 p 173&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years however the energetic Sultan fought against the ayans and was able subdue most of them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4001">Chroniclers of the [[musical theater]] have been around for years, collecting  pictorial surveys, [[librettos]] and [[sheet music|scores]], and recording the careers of various theatrical celebrities.  Nothing in the American musical theater has been more inaccessible, however, than the record of its [[dance]] traditions, and there are many to recount.  

For the most part, dance movement itself was either the last to be mentioned by critics or ignored altogether, resulting in  dance numbers in [[musicals]] going unrecorded.  The only way to preserve dance movements from generation to generation was by demonstration, imitation, practice, and personal supervision.  

Not until 1960, with the musical ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (musical)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'', did the permanent notation of a show's complete [[choreography]] exist.  

==History==

In the late 1920s, the importance of dance in a musical changed.  Seymour Felix realized dance needed to aid in [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] and [[characterization|character development]] as well as enhance the spirit of the show. Having convinced [[Florenz Ziegfeld]], the [[theatrical producer|producer]] of ''[[Whoopee!]]'', that it is the story that counts, Felix set about to devise dances that unfolded gradually and consisted of plot development and [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] as if they were [[drama]]tic [[Unit of action|units]] themselves instead of "a mere pounding of the feet and kicking to music."{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

The major step of integrating dance into a unified effect onstage were vital and ingenuous for commercial dancing. One of the earliest successful examples of this concept was in ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]''. The dancing in the show enhanced the environment and projected character without any reduction in the flashy entertainment values then prized in musical shows.

==Famous director-choreographers==

When it was realized the importance of dancing as a tool for character development and plot advancement, famous director-choreographers began to emerge:  [[Jerome Robbins]], [[Bob Fosse]], and [[Gower Champion]].  

Robbins believed whoever controlled the movement controlled the show.  This was definitely evident in ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' when Robbins allowed the choreography and the intense, adolescent passion of a teenage boy in love to move him.  When Robbins abandoned commercial dance to pursue a career in choreography with the [[New York City Ballet]], Bob Fosse took up the cause and argued the case for director-choreographers with shows like ''[[Sweet Charity]]'', ''[[Pippin (musical)|Pippin]]'', ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'', and ''Dancin'''.

Fosse had a talent for manipulating, tampering with, or otherwise reconstructing the contribution from writers in order to make the material serviceable to his staging and choreography.  Fosse's style of self-contained acts of [[vaudeville]] and [[burlesque]] led him to a career of show-stopping numbers for audience approval.  

Champion wasn’t as personal as Fosse, or as material-oriented as Robbins, but nonetheless, his craft and work sustained the old-fashioned [[musical comedy]] scene for two decades, [1960 with ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (musical)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'' to 1980 with ''[[42nd Street (musical)|42nd Street]]''.  Champion used dancing to embellish, extend and enlarge an existing emotion.  He was no innovator, like Robbins.  He never created his own distinctive style, like Fosse.  Yet, Champion's body of work is as much a part of the history of the contemporary musical as that of his talented peers.

[[File:King Cross repair, Poznan.jpg|thumbnail|right|Repairing an historical neon sign in situ]]
The '''conservation and restoration of neon objects''' is the process of caring for and maintaining neon objects (artworks), and includes documentation, examination, research, and treatment to insure their long-term viability, when desired.

==Neon Technology==
[[Georges Claude]], a French engineer, developed neon technology in 1910.  Claude introduced neon technology in [[Paris]], and it later became popular in America during the 1920s for use in advertising signage. Its popularity rose until the 1940s, after which neon signage was used less due to the invention of inexpensive plastics.

Neon lights are low-pressure gas discharge bulbs. They produce light by charging [[noble gases]] in glass cathode tubes with electricity.

===Tubes===
Neon bulbs are composed of noble gases sealed in glass tubing. The tubing can be bent by a professional glass blower or neon vendor into a variety of shapes to produce different imagery or text. The tube is vacuum-pumped to remove all air, after which a small amount of selected gases are pumped into the tube prior to permanently sealing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stern |first=Rudi |date=1979 |title=Let There Be Neon |url=https://www.amazon.com/Let-there-neon-Rudi-Stern/dp/0810912554 |location=New York |publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc., Publishers |page=132 |isbn=0-8109-1255-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each end of the tube is fitted with metal terminals called electrodes, also as known as cathodes.  When the electrodes are connected an energy source, the tube will glow as the gas becomes electrically excited. Different gases produce different colors; in addition, the glass tubing can also be coated or tinted, and different tubing and gas combinations produce a range of 150 colors.

===Gases===
Noble gases are sealed inside airtight cathode tubes, and produce light when they are electrically excited. Different gases and gas combinations will produce different colors, and are used in varying degrees in neon lights:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Gas!! Frequency of Use!! Color Produced
|-
| [[Neon]]|| Very Popular || Orange-Red
|-
| [[Argon]] || Very Popular || Blue-Lavender
|-
| [[Yellow Phosphor]] || Common || Yellow; Orange
|-
| [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]]|| Common || Blue; Green; Yellow
|-
| [[Helium]] || Common || White
|-
| [[Xenon]] || Rare || Blue-White
|-
| [[Krypton]] || Rare || White-Green
|}

==Neon in fine art==
Prior to the 1960s, neon technology was associated with advertising and was not considered fine art. In the 1960s, visual artists began experimenting with neon in mixed media and installation artworks. Prominent neon artworks during this time include [[Jasper Johns]]’ ''Field Painting'' (c. 1963-1964), [[James Rosenquist|James Rosenquist’s]] ''Tumbleweed'' (1963-1966), and [[Robert Rauschenberg|Robert Rauschenberg’s]] ''Green Shirt'' (1965-1967).

Chryssa, a Greek artist, is largely credited with establishing neon as a visual art form. She was very active in the 1960s and 70s and created large-scale works with a focus on and constant incorporation of neon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/arts/chryssa-artist-who-saw-neons-potential-as-a-medium-dies-at-79.html |title=Chryssa, Artist Who Saw Neon’s Potential as a Medium, Dies at 79|last=Fox|first=Margalit|publisher=Arts |date=18 January 2014 |website=The New York Times|access-date=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists began exploring the neon technology in 1970s, and have continued to do so in contemporary art making.

Some artists both design and create neon artworks by learning the skill set; however, the majority of artists rely on professional neon vendors to fabricate artworks following the artists’ design.

Neon artworks can be found in many permanent public collections, including the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], Chicago, IL, and the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]], Washington, D.C. In 1981, [[Lili Lakich]] and Richard Jenkins founded the [[Museum of Neon Art]] (MONA) in Los Angeles, whose collection preserves and exhibits historical neon advertisements and neon fine art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-neon-downtown25-2009sep25-story.html |title=L.A.'s Museum of Neon Art is Glowing, Glowing, Gone|last=DiMassa|first=Cara Mia|date=25 September 2009 |website=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, the museum closed its Los Angeles location, and reopened in November, 2015, in [[Glendale, California]].

==Collection care and maintenance of neon artworks==

===Unpacking===
Unpacking a neon artwork slowly and carefully will help avoid damage. As the glass tubes are fragile, they may become damaged during shipping. Preparing a condition report of the work after receipt will document if any of the tubes or components were cracked or broken during transit, and can be addressed prior to display. Unpacking artworks in teams of at least two people will better allow safer handling of the work, and may aid in documentation and recording.

===Cleaning===
Over time, neon artworks may collect dust. To ensure safety of personnel and the artwork, neon artworks should be turned off and unplugged prior to any cleaning. Trained professionals may undertake cleaning the work with approved materials such as a feather duster or dry paintbrush. The use of water or other cleaning liquids may pose a safety hazard due to potential contact with the electrical components. A professional conservator, specialist, or electrician should be consulted whenever:

*Any component of the artwork requires more than a light dusting.
*Part or all of the neon tubes are flickering/failing to illuminate.
* There is any rusting of the metal support structures. 
*The piece incurs any damage.

===Electrical safety===
'''Outlets:''' Neon artworks require electricity in order to function. A building electrical engineer should always be consulted prior to installing and displaying a neon artwork to confirm safe use of an electrical outlet. An outlet should never be overloaded. If an outlet feels warm, an electrician should be consulted before further use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nfpa.org/safety-information/for-consumers/causes/electrical/electrical-safety-in-the-home/electrical-safety-tips|title=Electrical Safety Tips |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015 |website=National Fire Prevention Association |access-date=2 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cords:''' Electrical cords connecting a neon artwork to a power source should be checked on a regular basis for any signs of fraying or wear and tear. The placement of cords is also important. If cords are run in high traffic areas, they may pose a tripping hazard to visitors, which could potentially result in personal injury and damage to the cord and/or artwork. The placement of cords in and against walls and out of traffic areas provide better safety and use. Use of [[extension cords]] are not recommended, as they increase the risk of potential electrical and tripping hazards. Review of the artwork and its installation, including outlet and cord placement,by curatorial, installation, and electrical staff will help ensure the safety of the artwork.

'''Transformers:''' A transformer  is used to convert electricity into use by the neon sign. Transformers last approximate ten to fifteen years, and older transformers may fail or pose safety risks, and require replacement. Failure to replace an older transformer may result in flickering in the neon artwork, or complete failure to light. It is important to consult an electrical engineer or professional to confirm the voltage type and requirements for the replacement transformer. When cataloging a neon artwork, the transformer type and age may be noted in the artwork record, along with a reminder about potential future transformer replacements.

Like other media, neon artworks should be monitored and condition reports performed on a regular basis. If an artwork appears to flicker or fails to illuminate, the work can first be assessed on display. Potential problems may include damage to the tubes, disruptions to the electrical components, including frayed wires or unplugged cords, or potential disruptions of the electrical supply (such as a power outage in the building or circuit). Prior to removing from display, the work should be turned off and disconnected from the electrical source. Flickering may indicate a problem with gas pressures inside the tubes (possibly a result of age and/or damaged tubes) or a failing transformer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/tps/how-to-preserve/briefs/25-signs.htm|title=The Preservation of Historic Signs|last=Auer |first=Michael J. |date=October 1991| publisher=Preservation Briefs|website=National Park Service|access-date=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Handling damaged neon===
Cracked or damaged neon tubes present potential health risks from contact with broken glass and exposure to mercury, a heavy metal contaminant, in gas form.  Though any mercury vapor, if present, will be in small amounts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IMERC Fact Sheet Mercury Use in Lighting|url=http://www.newmoa.org/prevention/mercury/imerc/factsheets/lighting.cfm |date=2008|website=Interstate Mercury Education &amp; Reduction Clearinghouse|publisher=Northeast Management Waste Officials' Association|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; steps should still be taken to avoid contamination. If a neon tube appears damaged, it should not be handled. If handling is required for removal, barrier gloves, such as nitrile, and protective covering, such an apron or smock, will help avoid potential contamination to personnel. Broken tubes should be stored separately from other collection items to avoid contamination, and clearly labeled with hazard labels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions about Contaminated Museum Collections|url=https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/migrated/museum/upload/Contaminated_Collections_FAQs.pdf|date=2006 |website=Interior Museum|publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior |accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The broken tubes will require assessment from a professional conservator/neon specialist.

==Re-fabrication==
Neon technology is non-archival. The gases have limited lifespans, and older electrical components will degrade over time. This may result in a limited display capacity for a neon work, e.g. diminished or intermittent light, or a complete loss of function, as well as pose safety risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Winslow|first1=Margaret|title=Conservation of Rafael Ferrer's Neon Corner|url=http://blog.artbma.org/2014/11/http://www.delart.org/conservation-of-rafael-ferrers-neon-corner/|publisher=Delaware Art Museum|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other traditional art mediums, such as painting, conservation for neon artworks and other new materials does not necessarily focus on preserving and repairing the original materials. As neon is a newer technology and media, there is less data available about how the media changes over time and how to inhibit further degradation. In order to successfully conserve a contemporary artwork such as neon, the conservator must 
* identify the materials and understand are they were applied and function.
*collect detailed information about their alteration overt time.
*preserve the artist's intent, which must therefore be documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chiantore|first1=Oscar|last2=Rava |first2=Antonio|date=2012 |title=Conserving Contemporary Art: Issues, Methods, Materials, and Research |location=Los Angeles, CA |publisher=The Getty Conservation Institute|page=16 |isbn=978-1-60606-104-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the media or technology cannot be safely recovered or addressed, new and replacement technology may be used to return the artwork closest to the state originally envisioned by the artist. This refabrication may be undertaken by a conservator, or potentially by the artist himself/herself. This may include replacing the neon tubes, electrical components such as cords and transformers, the work's support structure, or other media included in the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hileman|first1=Kristen|title=BMA Voices: Re-fabricating a beloved sculpture|url=http://blog.artbma.org/2014/11/bma-voices-re-fabricating-a-beloved-sculpture/|website=BMA Blog|publisher=Brooklyn Museum of Art|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of refabrication is the conservation of [[Rockne Krebs]]' ''Miami Line''. In 1984, the Miami-Dade County's Art in Public Places program commissioned Krebs to create a public artwork for the Metrorail bridge. The resulting work, ''Miami Line'', consisted of a rainbow of neon lights spanning the 1,540 bridge. Over time, the vibrations caused by trains on the bridge caused the neon lights to burn out, and by 2013, the entire work was no longer illuminated. The Art in Public Places program worked with the artist's estate to develop a plan to recreate the work using LED lights, which would be resistant to train vibrations, but still maintain the visual effect created by the artist. Electrical assessments and conservation of the work began in 2014, and the work will be relit upon completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art in Public Places Annual Report 2014|url=http://www.miamidade.gov/mayor/library/memos-and-reports/2015/04/04.22.15-Art-in-Public-Places-Annual-Report-FY-2014.pdf|publisher=Miami-Dade County Department of Cultural Affairs|page=10|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of a potentially burnt out neon tube, a conservator may identify the burned out tube portion of a neon artwork through use of a neon light tester, also known as a [[test light]] or voltage tester. This electronic test device is used to determine whether an electric current is running through the equipment being tested.

==Replication==
Replication differs from Re-fabrication in that the original artwork is not altered, and instead a copy is produced for temporary exhibition purposes. While the replica may not contain the same materials used in the original artwork, the finished product is approximately identical of the original.

Replication can only be undertaken with the approval of the artist or the artist’s estate. Bruce Nauman is an artist who requires four criteria be met to replicate his original neon artworks. These criteria are:
# The original neon must still be in existence and in working order.
# The current owner must agree to loan the work prior to the creation of a replica.
# The display credit line for the loaned artwork acknowledges the work on view is an exhibition copy and acknowledges the owner of the original artwork.
# The replica will be destroyed at the completion of the exhibition, which must be proven through photographic documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Conservation of Bruce Nauman's Neon Templates|url=http://theglasshouse.org/learn/the-conservation-of-bruce-naumans-neon-templates/|website=The Glass House |publisher=National Trust for Historic Preservation|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Declarative content clauses */ punct.</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4945">In [[grammar]], a '''content clause''' is a [[subordinate clause]] that provides content implied or commented upon by its [[independent clause|main clause]]. The term was coined by [[Otto Jespersen]]. They are also known as "[[Dependent_clause#Noun_clause|noun clauses]]". There are two main kinds of content clauses: '''declarative content clauses''' (or '''''that''-clauses'''), which correspond to [[declarative sentence]]s, and '''interrogative content clauses''', which correspond to [[interrogative|interrogative sentence]]s.

==Declarative content clauses==
Declarative content clauses can have a number of different grammatical roles. They often serve as [[object (grammar)|direct objects]] of verbs of reporting, cognition, perception, and so on. In this use, the [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]] ''that'' may [[head (linguistics)|head]] the clause, but is often omitted, that is, unvoiced:

*''He told her '''(that) she was smart'''.''
*''She thought '''(that) he was friendly'''.''
*''I hear '''(that) they've started dating'''.''
*''They wish '''(that) they had met earlier'''.''

Similarly with certain verb-like [[adjective]]s:

*''I'm not sure '''(that) he was right'''.''
*''Convinced '''(that) he could manage it without help''', he decided to proceed.''

They also often serve as [[complement (linguistics)|complements]] of nouns—both nouns corresponding to the above verbs, and nouns like ''fact'', ''idea'', and so on. Here, ''that'' is almost always included:

*''... our hope '''that someday the whole world will know peace''' ...''
*''... the fact '''that all matter obeys the same physical laws''' ...''
*''... the idea '''that a son would do such a thing to his father''' ...''

Finally, they can serve as [[subject (grammar)|subjects]], or as direct objects of verbs that [[linking verb|link]] them to adjectives or other [[predicative expression|predicative]]s. In this use, they are commonly postponed to the end of their main clause, with an [[Syntactic expletive|expletive]] ''it'' standing in their original place:

*'''''It''' startled me '''that the students were so advanced'''.''
*'''''It''' is important '''that we remember this day'''.''
*''I find '''it''' sad '''that he doesn't know the answer'''.''
*'''''It''' annoys me '''that she does that'''.''

Here as before, a conjunction is almost always included, although it does not need to be ''that'':

*''I'd prefer (it) '''if''' you didn't mention this to anyone.''
*''I like (it) '''when''' she comes to visit.''
*''It bothers me '''how''' she doesn't care what he wants.''

==Interrogative content clauses==

Interrogative content clauses, often called '''indirect questions''', can be used in many of the same ways as declarative ones; for example, they are often direct objects of verbs of cognition, reporting, and perception, but here they emphasize knowledge or lack of knowledge of one element of a fact:

*''I know '''what you did'''.''
*''I can't guess '''how he managed it'''.''
*''I wonder '''whether I looked that bad'''.''
*''She asked '''where the files were'''.''

Such clauses correspond to '''direct questions''', which are [[question]]s actually asked. The direct questions corresponding to the examples above are ''What did you do? How did he manage it? Did I look that bad? Where are the files?'' Notice how, in English (and in some other languages), different [[syntax]] is used in direct and indirect questions: direct questions normally use subject-verb [[inversion (linguistics)|inversion]], while indirect questions do not. Reported questions (as in the last of the examples) are also subject to the [[verb tense|tense]] and other changes that apply generally in [[indirect speech]]. For more information see [[interrogative mood]] and [[English grammar]].  

Indirect questions can serve as adjective and noun complements. Here, in English, they are generally introduced by a preposition, especially ''of'':
*''… the question '''(of) who was responsible''' …''
*''… his curiosity '''over how it happened''' …''
*''… sure '''of what he had seen''' … ''

Like declarative content clauses, they are often postponed to the end of their main clause, with an expletive ''it'' standing in their original place, when they serve as the subject of a verb, or as the direct object of a verb that links them to a predicative:

*'''''It''' is not known '''where they came from'''.''
*''I find '''it''' encouraging '''how many young women are pursuing careers in science'''.''

}}
'''Cosmeston Medieval Village''' is a "living history" medieval village near [[Lavernock]] in the [[Vale of Glamorgan]] not far from [[Penarth]] and [[Cardiff]] in south [[Wales]]. Based upon remains discovered during a 1980s [[archaeology|archaeological]] dig in the grounds of [[Cosmeston Lakes Country Park]], it is a re-creation of 14th century peasant life in [[Wales in the Late Middle Ages]].

The reconstructed village regularly plays host to groups of [[historical reenactment|reenactors]], who camp in authentic tents around the outskirts of the village, and perform displays of [[medieval warfare|historical combat]] for the public.

==History==

===Early medieval===
The original Cosmeston village grew around a [[fortified manor house]] constructed sometime around the 12th century by the De Costentin family, who were among the first [[Normans|Norman]] [[Norman invasion of Wales|invaders of Wales]] in the early 12th century following [[William the Conqueror]]'s invasion of neighbouring England in 1066. It is unlikely that the manor house at the site was a substantial building and there is documentary evidence that by 1437 the manor house had already fallen into total ruin. Its precise site has just been located. The village would have consisted of a number of small stone round houses, or crofts, with [[thatching|thatched]] roofs, as depicted in the current reconstruction, and the village population would have been between 50 and 100 people at most, including children.

The de Costentin family originated on the Cotentin peninsula in northern [[France]]. They were the first lords of the manor and they called the village Costentinstune, which over time became known as Cosmeston. They built the original manor house and, perhaps, a few dwellings or small farms, but for the next two centuries it appears that little further development occurred.

===Later medieval period===
Around 1316 the manor passed into the hands of the de Caversham family, also of [[Normans|Norman]] descent.

The buildings that have been excavated so far seem to be from the 14th century. It would appear that the de Caversham family brought a more designed approach to the development of the community and a better regulated and more compact settlement began to develop during their stewardship of the village.

There is little sign that the village continued to develop much past the later [[middle ages]]. Unusually, no Norman church was ever established in the immediate area, so by 1824 all that remained of Cosmeston village were four isolated crofts and the Little Cosmeston Farmhouse as shown on the [[Marquis of Bute]]'s detailed maps of the time. It is quite possible that the majority of the villagers were wiped out during the [[Black Death]] plague of the 1340s or the later outbreaks, leaving Cosmeston a [[Deserted medieval village]].

In addition to the plague, the villagers would have had to combat other difficulties. The land is low-lying and at the mercy of the many water sources that now feed the Cosmeston Lake. There is substantial evidence of drainage dykes, but even they would have struggled to keep the arable land free from waterlogging and constant flooding. Additionally the period was one of permanent political upheaval with intermittent resistance and armed conflict between several local Welsh leaders.  In January 1316, for instance, [[Llywelyn Bren]] attacked [[Caerphilly Castle]], and for the next two months there was conflict and devastation throughout the Glamorgan region.

===Modern history===
&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Cosmeston Medieval Village.jpg|thumb|left|Cosmeston village]] --&gt;
By the 20th century all evidence of the village had vanished and local residents had no idea of its previous existence. When the Snocem Concrete works and the Cosmeston limestone quarry closed in 1970, the land was developed under [[Countryside Commission]] funding as a [[country park]]. During the landscaping of the new country park the [[earthworks (archaeology)|first evidence]] of the medieval village was unearthed and an [[excavation (archaeology)|archeological exploration]] was undertaken.

The resulting heritage reconstruction has been described as the best representation of a medieval village currently available in Britain. In addition to being open to the general public, the village accepts school tours and archeological groups, together with staging of special events and [[medieval reenactment|re-enactment]]s throughout the year.

===The present===
Cosmeston has been used as a film location for many productions, including a 2014 episode of the hit BBC TV drama series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[Merlin (TV series)|Merlin]]'' and ''[[Galavant]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishfilmcommission.org.uk/uk-based-abc-series-galavant-to-premiere-on-sunday|title=British Film Commission - Galavant to premiere on Sunday|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''culture of the United States of America''' is primarily of [[Western culture]] ([[Europe]]an) origin and form, but is influenced by a [[multi-culturalism|multicultural ethos]] that includes [[African American|African]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], [[Asian American|Asian]], [[Polynesian American|Polynesian]], and [[Latin America]]n people and their cultures. It also has its own social and cultural characteristics, such as [[American English|dialect]], [[Music of the United States|music]], [[Visual art of the United States|arts]], [[society of the United States|social habits]], [[cuisine of the United States|cuisine]], and [[Folklore of the United States|folklore]]. The [[United States|United States of America]] is an ethnically and racially [[Multiculturalism|diverse]] country as a result of large-scale migration from many countries throughout its history.&lt;ref name="Society in Focus"/&gt; Many American cultural elements, especially from [[popular culture]], have [[Cultural globalization|spread across the globe]] through modern [[mass media]].

==Origins, development, and spread==

The [[Europe]]an roots of the United States are in the [[English American|English]] settlers of [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial America]] during [[Thirteen Colonies|British rule]]. The varieties of English people as opposed to the other peoples in the British Isles were the overwhelming majority ethnic group in the 17th century (population of the colonies in 1700 250,000) and were 47.9% of percent of the total population  of 3. 9 million. They constituted 60% of the whites at the first census in 1790 (%, 3.5 Welsh, 8.5 Scotch Irish, 4.3 Scots, 4.7 Southern Irish, 7.2 German, 2.7 Dutch, 1.7 French and .2 Swedish), The American Revolution, Colin Bonwick, 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;254. The English ethnic group contributed the major cultural and social mindset and attitudes that evolved into the American character. Of the total population in each colony they numbered from 30% in Pennsylvania to 85% in Massachusetts, Becoming America, Jon Butler, 2000, pp.&amp;nbsp;9–11. Large non-English immigrant populations from the 1720s to 1775, such as the Germans (100,000 or more), Scotch Irish (250,000), added enriched and modified the English cultural substrate, The Encyclopedia of Colonial and Revolutionary America, Ed. John Mack Faragher, 1990, pp.&amp;nbsp;200–202. The religious outlook was some versions of Protestantism (1.6% of the population were English, German and Irish Catholics ).

The British colonies inherited the English language, [[English law|legal system]], and [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British culture]], which was the majority cultural heritage. Parts of what are now the United States were colonized by [[New France|France]], [[New Spain|Spain]], [[New Netherlands|the Netherlands]], [[New Sweden|Sweden]], [[Danish West Indies|Denmark]], [[Russian America|Russia]], and Japan ([[Northern Mariana Islands]] and briefly [[Guam]]).{{refn|Short-lived conquests and unsuccessful colonies which had little if any lasting cultural impact include [[Norse colonization of North America]] which was mainly confined to Greenland, possession of [[St. Croix]] by the [[Knights Hospitaller]], and the Scottish colony [[Scottish colonization of the Americas#Stuarts Town.2C Carolina .281684.29|Stuarts Town, Carolina]] which pre-dates English-Scottish unification into the United Kingdom.}}  Though eventually overtaken by British or American territorial expansion, the longer they lasted the more these earlier colonial societies contributed to modern-day culture, including place names, architecture, religion, language, and food.

[[Jeffersonian democracy]] was a foundational American cultural innovation, which is still a core part of the country's identity.&lt;ref name=MJ&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nf22_zMVdqsC&amp;dq "Mr. Jefferson and the giant moose: natural history in early America"], Lee Alan Dugatkin. University of Chicago Press, 2009. {{ISBN|0-226-16914-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-226-16914-9}}. University of Chicago Press, 2009. Chapter x.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Jefferson's ''[[Notes on the State of Virginia]]'' was perhaps the first influential domestic cultural critique by an American and was written in reaction to the views of some influential Europeans that America's native flora, fauna, including humans, were [[degeneration|degenerate]].&lt;ref name=MJ /&gt;

Major cultural influences have been brought by historical immigration, especially from [[Culture of Germany|Germany]] in much of the country,&lt;ref name=kirschbaum&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirschbaum|first=Erik|title=The eradication of German culture in the United States, 1917-1918|year=1986|publisher=H.-D. Heinz|isbn=3-88099-617-2|page=155|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_eradication_of_German_culture_in_the.html?id=JvUMAQAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland and Italy in the Northeast, Japan in Hawaii.  [[Latin American culture]] is especially pronounced in former Spanish areas but has also been introduced by immigration, as has [[Asian American culture]]s (especially on the West Coast).  Forced migration during the [[Atlantic slave trade]], followed by liberation won in the [[American Civil War]] created [[African-American culture]] which pervades the South and other areas receiving internal immigrants during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migrations]].  Blending Southern and traditional African culture to some degree, this uniquely American culture has its own dialect; has contributed significant innovation in music, dance, and fashion; embraced a struggle by many African-Americans for political and economic equality; and is associated with significant populations of African-American Muslims and Christians in "[[Black church]]es".  [[Rap]] and music videos featuring African-American urban street culture have appeared in countries and melded with local performance cultures worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;See [[:Category:Rappers by nationality]] for a sampling.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though many mainland [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes and nations were overpowered by European colonists and American territorial expansion, but even in the areas they were pushed out of left cultural influences such as place names, knowledge about [[New World crops]]; [[cultural appropriation]] and the history military rivalry resulted in Native American-themed sports mascots.  Native culture remains strong in areas with large undisturbed or relocated populations, including traditional government and communal organization of property now legally managed by [[Indian reservations]] (large reservations are mostly in the West, especially [[Arizona]] and [[South Dakota]]).  The fate of native culture after contact with Europeans is quite varied.  For example, [[Taíno]] culture in U.S. Caribbean territories is nearly extinct and like most Native American languages, the [[Taíno language]] is no longer spoken.  In contrast the [[Hawaiian language]] and [[culture of the Native Hawaiians]] has survived in [[Hawaii]] and mixed with that of immigrants from the mainland U.S. (starting before the [[Newlands Resolution|1898 annexation]]) and to some degree Japanese immigrants. It occasionally influences mainstream American culture with notable exports like [[surfing]] and [[Hawaiian shirt]]s.  Most languages native to what is now U.S. territory have gone extinct, and the economic and mainstream cultural dominance of English threatens the surviving ones in most places.  The most common native languages include [[Samoan language|Samoan]], [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], [[Navajo language]], [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]], [[Sioux language|Sioux]], and a spectrum of [[Inuit languages]].  (See [[Indigenous languages of the Americas]] for a fuller listing, plus [[Chamorro language|Chamorro]], and [[Carolinian language|Carolinian]] in the Pacific territories.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.native-languages.org/most-us-canada.htm|title=Most Commonly Spoken Native American/First Nations Languages|website=Native-languages.org|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samoan people|Ethnic Samoans]] are a majority in [[American Samoa]]; [[Chamorro people|Chamorro]] are still the largest ethnic group in [[Guam]] (though a minority), and along with [[Refaluwasch]] are smaller minorities in the [[Northern Mariana Islands]].

American culture includes both conservative and liberal elements, scientific and religious competitiveness, political structures, risk taking and free expression, materialist and moral elements. Despite certain consistent ideological principles (e.g. [[individualism]], [[egalitarianism]], and faith in [[freedom]] and [[democracy]]), American culture has a variety of expressions due to its geographical scale and demographic diversity. The flexibility of U.S. culture and its highly symbolic nature lead some researchers to categorize American culture as a [[Political myth|mythic]] identity;&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, James (2010) ''Interplay:Communication, Memory, and Media in the United States''. Goettingen: Cuvillier, p. 120. {{ISBN|3-86955-322-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; others see it as [[American exceptionalism]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The United States has traditionally been thought of as a [[melting pot]], with immigrants contributing to but eventually [[cultural assimilation|assimilating]] with mainstream American culture. However, beginning in the 1960s and continuing on in the present day, the country trends towards cultural [[Multiculturalism|diversity]], [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]], and the image of a [[Salad bowl (cultural idea)|salad bowl]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121231163410/http://www.hoover.org/publications/hoover-digest/article/132541]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/factover/ch1.htm |title=''One from Many, Portrait of the USA'' |publisher=United States Information Agency |last=Clack, George |date=September 1997 |chapter=Chapter 1|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dealing with Diversity"&gt;{{cite book | last =Adams  | first =J.Q.  |author2=Pearlie Strother-Adams  | year =2001  | title =''Dealing with Diversity''  | publisher=Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company  | location =Chicago, IL | isbn = 0-7872-8145-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the country's history, certain subcultures (whether based on ethnicity or other commonality, such as the [[gay village]]) have dominated certain neighborhoods, only partially melded with the broader culture.  Due to the extent of American culture, there are many integrated but unique social [[subculture]]s within the United States, some not tied to any particular geography. The cultural affiliations an individual in the United States may have commonly depend on [[Social class in the United States|social class]], [[Politics of the United States|political orientation]] and a multitude of demographic characteristics such as religious background, occupation, and ethnic group membership.&lt;ref name="Society in Focus"/&gt;

[[Mass media]] promote cross-cultural diffusion. Some subcultures have national media exposure with dedicated television channels and crossover with mainstream media (such as Latin, African American, and [[LGBT culture]], though there are many niche channels).  Some communities have local broadcast or paper publications that carry content from a specific culture, such as native radio stations or Chinese-language newspapers in [[Chinatown]]s.  Almost every subculture has a presence on the [[World Wide Web]] and [[social media]].

Military history has influenced American culture and its worldwide reach in several ways. German cuisine became stigmatized by [[World War I]]; but in contrast the end of [[World War II]] resulted in cross-fertilization of American and Japanese business techniques during reconstruction and occupation, and brought home troops with an increased taste for Italian dishes.  Wars have also forced progress on equal rights for women and racial minorities, as these groups proved their till-then unrealized potential either in industry while men were off fighting, or by serving in the military honorably and effectively.  The [[American Civil War]] highlighted differences in culture (including attitudes toward racism) between the [[Southern United States]] and the North. Though the issue of slavery was settled by the war, racism and discrimination persisted and were supported by laws in some Southern states. Combined with determined civil rights activism, later wars resulted in profound changes in social norms, including desegregation, more intermixing of Black and White cultures, and more egalitarian social roles for men and women compared to countries that have not undergone similar shifts.  [[Modern display of the Confederate flag]] and [[removal of Confederate monuments and memorials]] remain controversial cultural and political issues, though many elements of proud Southern identity and culture such as hospitality, drawl, and comfort food have nothing to do with racial division.  Some differences in modern cultural tendencies fall along liberal-conservative political lines, with people on both sides of that increasingly self-segregating.

The post-WWII economic and military power of the United States (not to mention its large, relatively unified population) also helped it become more of an exporter of its own culture and values compared to its initial tendency to import of European culture (especially in its early, largely rural decades).  The United States has also administered now-foreign territories for many years, creating opportunities for cultural intermingling among many government employees and military personnel.  The longest stays have included the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|Philippines]] (1898–1946), [[Panama Canal Zone]] (1903–1979), [[United States occupation of Haiti|Haiti]] (1915-1934,), the [[Dominican Republic]] (1916-1924), and various Japanese islands and the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] for decades after WWII.

Colonists from the United States formed the now-independent country of [[Liberia]], which inherited a considerable amount of American culture and values. Given its proximity, relatively free movement over the border, the highly integrated North American economy, strong military alliance, shared origins in British colonialism, and a common language, the English-speaking [[culture of Canada]] is strongly influenced by that of the United States.  Some Canadians resist the dominance of the United States includes requirements for domestically produced mass media, though especially since the [[Hollywood North]] phenomenon began in the 1980s, Canada also exports entertainment to the United States.  American movies may have made the biggest impact of all American exports on popular culture worldwide.

==Regional variations==
[[File:Dean Franklin - 06.04.03 Mount Rushmore Monument (by-sa)-3 new.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mount Rushmore]]]]
Semi-distinct cultural [[List of regions of the United States|regions of the United States]] include [[New England]], the [[Mid-Atlantic states]], the [[Southern United States]], the [[Midwestern United States]] and the [[Western United States]]—an area that can be further subdivided, on the basis of the local culture into the [[Pacific States]] and the [[Mountain States]].

[[Western United States|The western coast of the continental United States]] consisting of California, [[Oregon]], and the state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] is also sometimes referred to as the [[Left Coast]], indicating its [[Left-wing politics|left-leaning political orientation]] and tendency towards [[social liberalism]].

[[Southern United States]] are informally called "the [[Bible Belt]]" due to [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Protestantism]], which is a significant part of the region's culture and Christian [[church attendance]] across the denominations is generally higher there than the nation's average. This region is usually contrasted with the [[mainline Protestant]]ism and [[Catholicism]] of the [[northeastern United States]], the religiously diverse [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and [[Great Lakes region|Great Lakes]], the [[Mormon Corridor]] in [[Utah]] and southern [[Idaho]], and the [[Unchurched Belt|relatively secular]] [[western United States]]. The percentage of non-religious people is the highest in the northeastern state of [[Vermont]] at 34%, compared to the Bible Belt state of [[Alabama]], where it is 6%.&lt;ref name="gc.cuny.edu"&gt;{{cite web|title=American Religious Identification Survey |work=www.gc.cuny.edu |url=http://www.gc.cuny.edu/faculty/research_briefs/aris/key_findings.htm#StateFaith |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709082644/http://www.gc.cuny.edu/faculty/research_briefs/aris/key_findings.htm |archivedate=July 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strong cultural differences have a long history in the U.S. with the southern slave society in the antebellum period serving as a prime example. Not only social, but also economic tensions between the Northern and Southern states were so severe that they eventually caused the South to declare itself an independent nation, the [[Confederate States of America]]; thus initiating the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;{{cite book|last=Hine|first=Darlene|author2=William C. Hine |author3=Stanley Harrold |year=2006|title=''The African American Odyssey''|publisher=Pearson|location=Boston, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fischer's theory===
[[File:Vrijheidsbeeld.JPG|alt=Statue of Liberty, seen from the statue's front-left and below|thumb|upright|The [[Statue of Liberty]] in [[New York City]], is an important cultural symbol in the United States, and the values that it symbolizes—the virtues of freedom and liberty—are likewise integral to United States culture]]
[[David Hackett Fischer]] theorizes that the United States is made up today of four distinct regional cultures.&lt;ref&gt;1989 book, ''[[Albion's Seed]]'' ({{ISBN|0195069056}}), Paul Berinde&lt;/ref&gt; The book's focus is on the [[folkways (sociology)|folkways]] of four groups of settlers from the [[British Isles]] that emigrated from distinct regions of Britain and Ireland to the British American colonies during the 17th and 18th centuries. Fischer's thesis is that the culture and folkways of each of these groups persisted, albeit with some modification over time, providing the basis for the four modern regional cultures of the United States.

According to Fischer, the foundation of American culture was formed from four [[mass migrations]] from four different regions of the British Isles by four distinct socio-religious groups. [[New England]]'s earliest settlement period occurred between 1629 and 1640 when [[Puritans]], mostly from [[East Anglia]] in England, settled there, forming the New England regional culture. The next mass migration was of southern English [[cavalier]]s and their working class English domestic servants to the [[Chesapeake Bay]] region between 1640 and 1675. This facilitated the development of the Southern American culture.

Then (between 1675 and 1725), thousands of English and Welsh [[Quaker]]s, led by [[William Penn]], settled in the [[Delaware Valley]] followed by large numbers of German Lutherans. This settlement resulted in the formation of what is today considered the "General American" culture, although, according to Fischer, it is really just a regional American culture, even if it does today encompass most of the U.S. from the mid-Atlantic states to the Pacific Coast. Finally, Scotch-Irish, English and Scottish settlers from the borderlands of Britain and Ireland migrated to [[Appalachia]] between 1717 and 1775. They formed the regional culture of the [[Upland South]], which has since spread west to such areas as [[West Texas]] and parts of the [[U.S. Southwest]].

Fischer suggests that the U.S. today is not a country with one General American culture and three or more regional sub-cultures. He asserts that the country is composed of just regional cultures, and that understanding that helps one to understand many things about modern American life. Fischer also makes the point that the development of these regional cultures derived not only from where exactly the settlers first came, but when they came. Fischer asserts that during different periods of time, a population of people will have very distinct beliefs, fears, hopes and prejudices, and that various groups of settlers brought these feelings to the New World where they more or less froze in time in America, even if they eventually changed in their place of origin.

===Woodard's theory===
Continuing the work of Fischer, [[Colin Woodard]], in his book ''American Nations'',&lt;ref&gt;2011, ''American Nations'', {{ISBN|978-0143122029}}, Penguin Books&lt;/ref&gt; claims an existence of eleven rival regional cultures in North America, based on the cultural characteristics of the original settlers of these regions. These regions are: Yankeedom, New Netherland, The Midlands, Tidewater, Greater Appalachia, The Deep South, New France, El Norte, The Left Coast, The Far West and First Nation (a region in parts of northern Canada and Alaska, and Greenland).

According to Woodard, these regions cross and disregard formal state or even country borders. For example, he compares the Mexican border with the Berlin wall, saying that "El Norte in some ways resembles Germany during the Cold War: two peoples with a common culture separated by a large wall."

==Language==
{{Main|Languages of the United States}}
[[File:Tree map of languages in the United States.png|right|thumb|Tree map of languages in the US]]
Although the United States has no official language at the federal level, [[Languages of the United States|28 states]] have passed legislation making [[English language|English]] the [[official language]] and it is considered to be the ''[[de facto]]'' national language. According to the [[2000 U.S. Census]], more than 97% of Americans can speak English well, and for 81% it is the only language spoken at home. More than 300 languages besides English have native speakers in the United States—some of which are spoken by the [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous]] peoples (about 150 living languages) and others imported by immigrants.

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] has official status in the commonwealth of [[Puerto Rico]] and the state of [[New Mexico]]; Spanish is the primary spoken language in Puerto Rico and various smaller linguistic enclaves.&lt;ref name="2007 survey"&gt;{{cite web

Bilingual speakers may use both English and Spanish reasonably well but [[code-switch]] according to their dialog partner or context. Some refer to this phenomenon as [[Spanglish]].

Indigenous languages of the United States include the [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]], which are spoken on the country's numerous [[Indian reservations]] and Native American cultural events such as [[pow wows]]; [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], which has official status in the state of Hawaii; [[Chamorro language|Chamorro]], which has official status in the commonwealths of [[Guam]] and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]]; [[Carolinian language|Carolinian]], which has official status in the commonwealth of the [[Northern Mariana Islands]]; and [[Samoan language|Samoan]], which has official status in the commonwealth of [[American Samoa]]. [[American Sign Language]], used mainly by the deaf, is also native to the country.

The national dialect is known as [[American English]], which itself consists of numerous regional dialects but has some shared unifying features that distinguish it from other national varieties of English. There are four large [[List of dialects of the English language|dialect regions]] in the United States—the [[Inland Northern American English|North]], the [[Midland American English|Midland]], the [[Southern American English|South]], and the [[Western American English|West]]—and several smaller dialect regions such as those of [[New York City English|New York City]], [[Philadelphia English|Philadelphia]], and [[Boston accent|Boston]]. A [[standard dialect]] called "[[General American]]" (analogous in some respects to the [[Received Pronunciation|received pronunciation]] elsewhere in the [[English-speaking world]]), lacking the distinctive noticeable features of any particular region, is believed by some to exist as well; it is sometimes regionally associated with the vaguely-defined "[[Midwest]]".

===Native language statistics for the United States===

The right to freedom of expression in the American constitution can be traced to German immigrant [[John Peter Zenger]] and his legal fight to make truthful publications in the Colonies a protected legal right,{{Relevance inline|date=October 2012}} ultimately paving the way for the protected rights of American authors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/zenger/zenger.html "Famous American Trials: John Peter Zenger Trial 1735"], Doug Linder.

In the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, American art and literature took most of its cues from Europe. During its early history, America was a series of [[British colonization of the Americas|British colonies]] on the eastern coast of the present-day United States. Therefore, its literary tradition begins as linked to the broader tradition of [[English literature]]. However, unique American characteristics and the breadth of its production usually now cause it to be considered a separate path and tradition.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

America's first internationally popular writers were [[James Fenimore Cooper]] and [[Washington Irving]] in the early nineteenth century. They painted an American literary landscape full of humor and adventure. These were followed by [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]] who established a distinctive American literary voice in the middle of the nineteenth century.

[[Mark Twain]], [[Henry James]], and poet [[Walt Whitman]] were major figures in the century's second half; [[Emily Dickinson]], virtually unknown during her lifetime, would be recognized as America's other essential poet. Eleven U.S. citizens have won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], including [[John Steinbeck]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[Pearl S. Buck]], [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Sinclair Lewis]]. [[Ernest Hemingway]], the 1954 Nobel laureate, is often named as one of the most influential writers of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, Jeffrey (1999). ''Hemingway: A Biography''.

In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, American artists primarily painted landscapes and portraits in a realistic style. A parallel development taking shape in rural America was the [[American craft]] movement, which began as a reaction to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Developments in modern art in Europe came to America from exhibitions in New York City such as the [[Armory Show]] in 1913. After World War II, New York emerged as a center of the art world. Painting in the United States today covers a vast range of styles. American painting includes works by [[Jackson Pollock]], [[John Singer Sargent]], and [[Norman Rockwell]], among many others.

Architecture in the United States is regionally diverse and has been shaped by many external forces, not only English. U.S. architecture can therefore be said to be eclectic, something unsurprising in such a multicultural society.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dell Upton]]. 1998. ''Architecture in the United States-Oxford history of art.'' pp. 11 ff. {{ISBN|0-19-284217-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of a single large-scale architectural influence from indigenous peoples such as those in Mexico or Peru, generations of designers have incorporated influences from around the world. Currently, the overriding theme of American Architecture is [[Skyscraper#Modern skyscrapers|modernity, as manifest in the skyscrapers]] of the 20th century.

Early [[Neoclassicism]] accompanied the Founding Father's idealization of European Enlightenment, making it the predominant architectural style for public buildings and large manors. However, in recent years, suburbanization and mass migration to the [[Sun Belt]] has allowed architecture to reflect a [[Mediterranean Revival architecture|Mediterranean]] style as well.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

O'Neill is a four-time winner of the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for drama and the only American playwright to win the [[Nobel Prize]] for '''literature.''' After O'Neill, American drama came of age and flourished with the likes of [[Arthur Miller]], [[Tennessee Williams]], [[Lillian Hellman]], [[William Inge]], and [[Clifford Odets]] during the first half of the twentieth century. After this fertile period, American theater broke new ground, artistically, with the absurdist forms of [[Edward Albee]] in the 1960s.

Social commentary has also been a preoccupation of American theater, often addressing issues not discussed in the mainstream. Writers such as [[Lorraine Hansbury]], [[August Wilson]], [[David Mamet]] and [[Tony Kushner]] have all won [[Pulitzer Prizes]] for their polemical plays on American society. The [[United States]] is also the home and largest exporter of modern [[musical theater]], producing such musical talents as [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]], [[Lerner and Loewe]], [[Cole Porter]], [[Irving Berlin]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[George Gershwin|George]] and [[Ira Gershwin]], [[Kander and Ebb]], and [[Stephen Sondheim]].

The United States is represented by various genres of dance, from ballet to hip-hop and folk.

===Cinema===
{{Main|Cinema of the United States}}The [[Film|cinema]] of the [[United States]], often generally referred to as Hollywood, has had a profound effect on cinema across the world since the early twentieth century. While the [[Lumiere Brothers]] are generally credited with the birth of modern cinema, it is American cinema that has emerged as the most dominant force in the industry. Its history can be  separated into four main periods: the [[silent film|silent film era]], [[classical Hollywood cinema]], [[New Hollywood]], and the contemporary period. Actor [[James Dean]], who appeared in films during the classical Hollywood era until his untimely death, is widely regarded as an American cultural icon of teenage disillusionment.

American independent cinema was revitalized in the late 1980s and early 1990s when another new generation of moviemakers, including [[Spike Lee]], [[Steven Soderbergh]], [[Kevin Smith]], and [[Quentin Tarantino]] made movies like, respectively: ''[[Do the Right Thing]]''; ''[[Sex, Lies, and Videotape]]''; ''[[Clerks]]''; and ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]''. In terms of directing, screenwriting, editing, and other elements, these movies were innovative and often irreverent, playing with and contradicting the conventions of Hollywood movies. Furthermore, their considerable financial successes and crossover into popular culture reestablished the commercial viability of independent film. Since then, the independent film industry has become more clearly defined and more influential in American cinema. Many of the major studios have capitalized on this by developing subsidiaries to produce similar films; for example [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]].

To a lesser degree in the early 21st century, film types that were previously considered to have only a minor presence in the mainstream movie market began to arise as more potent American box office draws. These include foreign-language films such as ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'', ''[[Baahubali 2]]'' and ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' and documentary films such as ''[[Super Size Me]]'', ''[[March of the Penguins]]'', and [[Michael Moore]]'s ''[[Bowling for Columbine]]'' and ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]''.

There is a regard for scientific advancement and technological innovation in American culture, resulting in the flow of many modern innovations. The great American inventors include [[Robert Fulton]] (the [[steamboat]]); [[Samuel Morse]] (the [[telegraph]]); [[Eli Whitney]] (the [[cotton gin]], [[interchangeable parts]]); [[Cyrus McCormick]] (the [[reaper]]); and [[Thomas Edison]] (with more than a thousand inventions credited to his name). Most of the new technological innovations over the 20th and 21st centuries were either first invented in the United States, first widely adopted by Americans, or both. Examples include the [[lightbulb]], the [[airplane]], the [[transistor]], the [[atomic bomb]], [[nuclear power]], the [[personal computer]], the [[iPod]], [[video games]], [[e-commerce|online shopping]], and the development of the [[Internet]].

[[File:Replica-of-first-transistor.jpg|thumb|A replica of the first working transistor|187x187px]]
This propensity for application of scientific ideas continued throughout the 20th century with innovations that held strong international benefits. The twentieth century saw the arrival of the [[Space Age]], the [[Information Age]], and a renaissance in the [[health sciences]]. This culminated in cultural milestones such as the [[Apollo program|Apollo moon landings]], the creation of the Personal Computer, and the sequencing effort called the [[Human Genome Project]].

Throughout its history, American culture has made significant gains through the open immigration of accomplished scientists. Accomplished scientists include: Scottish-American scientist [[Alexander Graham Bell]], who developed and patented the telephone and other devices; German scientist [[Charles Steinmetz]], who developed new alternating-current electrical systems in 1889; Russian scientist [[Vladimir Zworykin]], who invented the motion camera in 1919; Serb scientist [[Nikola Tesla]] who patented a brushless electrical [[induction motor]] based on rotating magnetic fields in 1888. With the rise of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] party in Germany, a large number of Jewish scientists fled Germany and immigrated to the country, including theoretical physicist [[Albert Einstein]] in 1933.

In the years during and following WWII, several innovative scientists immigrated to the U.S. from Europe, such as [[Enrico Fermi]], who came from [[Italy]] in 1938 and led the work that produced the world's first self-sustaining [[nuclear chain reaction]]. Post-war Europe saw many of its scientists, such as rocket scientist [[Wernher von Braun]], recruited by the United States as part of [[Operation Paperclip]].{{Relevance inline|date=October 2012}}

==Education==
{{Main|Education in the United States|Educational attainment in the United States}}
[[File:Higher education in the US by race.svg|thumb|Higher education in the US by race as of 2003|188x188px]]

Education in the United States is and has historically been provided mainly by government. Control and funding come from three levels: [[Federal government of the United States|federal]], [[State government|state]], and [[Local government|local]]. School attendance is mandatory and nearly universal at the elementary and high school levels (often known outside the United States as the primary and secondary levels).

Students have the options of having their education held in [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]s, private schools, or [[homeschooling|home school]]. In most public and private schools, education is divided into three levels: [[Primary education in the United States|elementary school]], [[Middle school|junior high school]] (also often called middle school), and [[Secondary education in the United States|high school]]. In almost all schools at these levels, children are divided by age groups into [[Grade levels|grades]]. [[Post-secondary education]], better known as "college" in the United States, is generally governed separately from the elementary and high school system.

In the year 2000, there were 76.6&amp;nbsp;million students enrolled in schools from [[kindergarten]] through [[graduate school]]s. Of these, 72 percent aged 12 to 17 were judged academically "on track" for their age (enrolled in school at or above grade level). Of those enrolled in compulsory education, 5.2&amp;nbsp;million (10.4 percent) were attending private schools. Among the country's adult population, over 85 percent have completed high school and 27 percent have received a [[bachelor's degree]] or higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US High school census data|url=http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/censusandstatistics/a/highschool.htm|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among [[developed country|developed countries]], the U.S. is one of the most religious in terms of its demographics. According to a 2002 study by the [[Pew Global Attitudes Project]], the U.S. was the only developed nation in the survey where a majority of citizens reported that religion played a "very important" role in their lives, an opinion similar to that found in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =U.S. Stands Alone in its Embrace of Religion| work=Pew Global Attitudes Project| url = http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?ReportID=167| accessdate = January 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, governments at the national, state, and local levels are a secular institution, with what is often called the "[[Separation of church and state in the United States|separation of church and state]]".

Although participation in organized religion has been diminishing, the public life and [[popular culture]] of the United States incorporates many Christian ideals specifically about redemption, salvation, conscience, and morality. Examples are popular culture obsessions with confession and forgiveness, which extends from [[reality television]] to [[twelve-step meeting]]s. Americans expect public figures to confess and have public [[penitence]] for any sins, or moral wrongdoings they may have caused. According to ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', examples of inadequate public penitence may include the scandals and fallout regarding [[Tiger Woods]], [[Alex Rodriguez]], [[Mel Gibson]], [[Larry Craig]], and [[Lance Armstrong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Hehir|first=Andrew|title=Why do we care if Lance apologizes?|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/01/20/why_do_we_care_if_lance_apologizes/|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|publisher=Salon Media Group|accessdate=20 January 2013|date=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the original [[Thirteen Colonies]] were established by English settlers who wished to practice their own religion without discrimination or persecution: [[Pennsylvania]] was established by [[Quakers]], [[Maryland]] by Roman Catholics, and the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] by [[Puritan]]s. Separatist [[Congregationalists]] ([[Pilgrim Fathers]]) founded [[Plymouth Colony]] in 1620. They were convinced that the democratic form of government was the will of God.&lt;ref&gt;M.

By the time of the [[Philadelphia Convention]] of 1787, the United States became one of the first countries in the world to codify [[freedom of religion in the United States|freedom of religion]] into law, although this originally applied only to the federal government, and not to state governments or their political subdivisions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Modeling the provisions concerning religion within the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]], the framers of the [[United States Constitution]] rejected any religious test for office, and the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] specifically denied the central government any power to enact any law respecting either an establishment of religion, or prohibiting its free exercise. In following decades, the animating spirit behind the constitution's [[Establishment Clause]] led to the disestablishment of the official religions within the member states. The framers were mainly influenced by secular, [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideals, but they also considered the pragmatic concerns of minority religious groups who did not want to be under the power or influence of a [[state religion]] that did not represent them.&lt;ref&gt;Marsden, George M. 1990.

The United States observes holidays derived from events in [[History of the United States|American history]], Christian traditions, and [[Founding Fathers of the United States|national patriarchs]].

[[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] is the principal traditionally American holiday. It evolved from the English [[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrim's]] custom of giving thanks for one's welfare. Thanksgiving is generally celebrated as a family reunion with a large afternoon feast. [[Christmas Day]], celebrating the birth of [[Jesus Christ]], is widely celebrated and a federal holiday, though a fair amount of its current cultural importance is due to secular reasons. [[British colonization of the Americas|European colonization]] has led to some other Christian holidays such as [[Easter]] and [[St. Patrick's Day]] to be observed, though with varying degrees of religious fidelity.

[[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] (also known as the Fourth of July) celebrates the anniversary of the country's [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] from Great Britain. It is generally observed by parades throughout the day and the shooting of fireworks at night.

[[Halloween]] is thought to have evolved from the ancient Celtic/Gaelic festival of [[Samhain]], which was introduced in the American colonies by Irish settlers. It has become a holiday that is celebrated by children and teens who traditionally dress up in costumes and go door to door trick-or-treating for candy. It also brings about an emphasis on eerie and frightening [[urban legends]] and movies.

Additionally, [[Mardi Gras]], which evolved from the Catholic tradition of [[Carnival]], is observed in New Orleans, [[St. Louis]], [[Mobile, Alabama]], and numerous other towns.

Federally recognized holidays are as follows:

==Names==
{{Main|Naming in the United States|African-American names}}
The [[United States]] has few [[Naming laws|laws governing given names]]. Traditionally, the right to name your child or yourself as you choose has been upheld by court rulings and is rooted in the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|fourteenth Amendment]] of the United States Constitution and the [[Free Speech Clause]] of the [[First Amendment]]. A few restrictions do exist. Restrictions vary by state, but most are for the sake of practicality (for example: limiting the number of characters due to limitations in record keeping software). This freedom, along with the cultural diversity in the United States has given rise to a wide variety of names and naming trends. Creativity has also long been a part of American naming traditions and names have been used to express personality, cultural identity, and values&lt;ref name="Naming rights"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larson|first=Carlton F.W.|title=Naming Baby: The Constitutional Dimensions of Naming Rights|journal=George Washington Law Review|date=November 2011|volume=80|issue=1|url=http://www.gwlr.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/80-1-Larson.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baby Name Wizard"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wattenberg|first=Laura|title=The Baby Name Wizard, Revised 3rd Edition: A Magical Method for Finding the Perfect Name for Your Baby|date=May 7, 2013|publisher=Harmony|isbn=0770436471|url=https://www.amazon.com/Baby-Name-Wizard-Revised-Edition/dp/0770436471/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392242718&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=baby+name+wizard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naming trends vary by race, geographic area, and socioeconomic status. African-Americans, for instance, have developed a very distinct naming culture.&lt;ref name="Baby Name Wizard"/&gt; Both religious names and those inspired by popular culture are common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenkrantz|first=Linda|title=Beyond Jennifer &amp; Jason, Madison &amp; Montana: What to Name Your Baby Now|date=August 29, 2006|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fashion and dress==
{{Main|Fashion in the United States}}
[[File:jeans for men.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|A pair of blue jeans]]

Fashion in the United States is eclectic and predominantly informal. While Americans' diverse cultural roots are reflected in their clothing, particularly those of recent immigrants, [[cowboy hat]]s and [[cowboy boot|boots]] and leather [[motorcycle jackets]] are emblematic of specifically American styles.

[[Jeans|Blue jeans]] were popularized as work clothes in the 1850s by merchant [[Levi Strauss]], a German-Jewish immigrant in San Francisco, and adopted by many American teenagers a century later. They are worn in every state by people of all ages and social classes. Along with mass-marketed informal wear in general, blue jeans are arguably one of US culture's primary contributions to global fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Davis Fred (1992). ''Fashion, Culture, and Identity''&lt;/ref&gt;

Though informal dress is more common, certain professionals, such as [[bankers]] and [[lawyers]], traditionally dress formally for work, and some occasions, such as [[weddings]], [[funerals]], [[dance]]s, and some parties, typically call for [[formal wear]].

==Sports==
{{Main|Sports in the United States}}
Since 1820, American schools focused on gymnastics, hygiene training, and care and development of the human body.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}{{dubious|reason=gymnastics with Indian Clubs started in the late 19th century, but not in schools.

Before then, it was all book work. America followed England until then|date=June 2015}} In the 1800s, colleges were encouraged to focus on intramural sports, particularly [[track and field|track, field]], and, in the late 1800s, American football. Physical education was incorporated into primary school curriculums in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Excite"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.excite.com/education/subject/brief-history-of-physical-education | title=Brief History of Physical Education | website=Excite.com | accessdate=May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Typical baseball game.JPG|left|thumb|upright=0.9|A typical [[Baseball diamond]] as seen from the stadium]]
[[Baseball]] is the oldest of the major American team sports. Professional baseball dates from 1869 and had no close rivals in popularity until the 1960s. Though baseball is no longer the most popular sport,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poll: Adults who follow at least one sport|url=http://www.harrisinteractive.com/NewsRoom/HarrisPolls/tabid/447/mid/1508/articleId/675/ctl/ReadCustom%20Default/Default.aspx|work=Harris Interactive}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is still referred to as "the [[national pastime]]." Also unlike the professional levels of the other popular spectator sports in the U.S., [[Major League Baseball]] teams play almost every day. The Major League Baseball [[Season (sports)|regular season]] consists of each of the 30 teams playing 162 games from April to September. The season ends with the [[Major League Baseball postseason|postseason]] and [[World Series]] in October.

[[File:2007 Texas Longhorns football team entry.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.9|The opening of [[College football]] season is a major part of American pastime. Massive [[marching band]]s, [[cheerleaders]], and colorguard are common at [[American football]] games]]
[[American football]], known in the United States as simply "football," now attracts more television viewers than any other sport and is considered to be the most popular sport in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Krane, David K.|title=Professional Football Widens Its Lead Over Baseball as Nation's Favorite Sport|url=http://www.harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PID=337| publisher=Harris Interactive| date = 2002-10-30| accessdate=September 14, 2007}} Maccambridge, Michael (2004). ''America's Game: The Epic Story of How Pro Football Captured a Nation''. New York: Random House. {{ISBN|0-375-50454-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The 32-team [[National Football League]] (NFL) is the most popular professional American football league.
The [[National Football League]] differs from the other three [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major pro sports leagues]] in that each of its 32 teams plays one game a week over 17 weeks, for a total of 16 games with one [[Bye (sports)|bye]] week for each team. The [[National Football League regular season|NFL season]] lasts from September to December, ending with the [[National Football League playoffs|playoffs]] and [[Super Bowl]] in January and February.
Its championship game, the [[Super Bowl]], has often been the highest rated television show, and it has an audience of over 100 million viewers annually.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[College football]] also attracts audiences of millions. Some communities, particularly in rural areas, place great emphasis on their local [[high school football]] team. American football games usually include [[cheerleaders]] and [[marching band]]s, which aim to raise school spirit and entertain the crowd at [[halftime]].

[[Basketball]] is another major sport, represented professionally by the [[National Basketball Association]]. It was invented in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] in 1891, by Canadian-born physical education teacher [[James Naismith]]. [[College basketball]] is also popular, due in large part to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA men's Division I basketball tournament]] in March, also known as "March Madness."

[[Ice hockey]] is the fourth leading professional team sport. Always a mainstay of [[Great Lakes]] and [[New England]]-area culture, the sport gained tenuous footholds in regions like the [[American South]] since the early 1990s, as the [[National Hockey League]] pursued a policy of expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unitedstatesofhockey.com/2011/05/19/raw-numbers-the-nhls-impact-on-the-south/ |title=Raw Numbers: The NHL's Impact on the South |publisher=The United States of Hockey |date=2011-05-19 |accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lacrosse]] is a team sport of [[Native Americans in the United States|American]] and [[First Nations|Canadian]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] origin and is the fastest growing sport in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eight Interesting Facts About Team Sports Participation In America|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/44628826}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lacrosse is most popular in the East Coast area. [[National Lacrosse League|NLL]] and [[Major League Lacrosse|MLL]] are the national [[box lacrosse|box]] and [[outdoor lacrosse]] leagues, respectively, and have increased their following in recent years. Also, many of the top Division I college lacrosse teams draw upwards of 7–10,000 for a game, especially in the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[New England]] areas.

[[Soccer]] is very popular as a participation sport, particularly among youth, and the [[United States men's national soccer team|US national teams]] are competitive internationally. A twenty-team professional league, [[Major League Soccer]], plays from March to October, but its television audience and overall popularity lag behind other American professional sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Soccer will never be America's sport|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2013/07/soccer-will-never-be-americas-sport/ | work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Three-wide multiple row back.JPG|thumb|[[NASCAR]] is the most watched [[auto racing]] series in the United States]]
[[Boxing]] and [[horse racing]] were once{{When|date=February 2011}} the most watched individual sports, but they have been eclipsed by [[golf]] and [[auto racing]], particularly [[NASCAR]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Other popular sports are [[tennis]], [[softball]], [[rodeo]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[water polo]], [[fencing]], [[shooting sports]], [[hunting]], [[volleyball]], [[skiing]], [[snowboarding]], [[skateboarding]], [[Ultimate (sport)|Ultimate]], [[Disc golf]], [[cycling]], [[mixed martial arts|MMA]], roller derby, [[wrestling]], [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]] and [[rugby football|rugby]].

Relative to other parts of the world, the United States is unusually competitive in women's sports, a fact usually attributed to the [[Title IX]] antidiscrimination law, which requires most American colleges to give equal funding to men's and women's sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Amid 40th anniversary of Title IX, women set new standard in London|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/olympics/2012/writers/ann_killion/08/12/2012-olympics-women-title-ix/ | work=CNN | date=August 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite that, however, women's sports are not nearly as popular among spectators as men's sports.

The United States enjoys a great deal of success both in the [[Summer Olympics]] and [[Winter Olympics]], constantly finishing among the top medal winners.

===Sports and community culture===
[[File:13399-Homecoming Tailgate and Game-1839 (10714677125).jpg|thumb|right|Homecoming parade at Texas A&amp;M University–Commerce in 2013]]
[[Homecoming]] is an annual tradition of the United States. People, towns, high schools and colleges come together, usually in late September or early October, to welcome back former residents and [[alumni]]. It is built around a central event, such as a [[banquet]], a [[parade]], and most often, a game of [[American football]], or, on occasion, [[basketball]], [[wrestling]] or [[ice hockey]]. When celebrated by schools, the activities vary. However, they usually consist of a football game, played on the school's home football field, activities for students and alumni, a [[parade]] featuring the school's [[marching band]] and sports teams, and the coronation of a [[Homecoming Queen]].

American high schools commonly field football, basketball, baseball, softball, volleyball, soccer, golf, swimming, track and field, and cross-country teams as well.

==Cuisine==
{{Main|Cuisine of the United States}}
[[File:The First Thanksgiving cph.3g04961.jpg|thumb|left|''The First Thanksgiving 1621'', oil on canvas by [[Jean Leon Gerome Ferris]] (1899)]]
The cuisine of the United States is extremely diverse, owing to the vastness of the continent, the relatively large population (1/3 of a billion people) and the number of native and immigrant influences. Mainstream [[Cuisine of the United States|American culinary arts]] are similar to those in other Western countries. Wheat and corn are the primary cereal grains. Traditional American cuisine uses ingredients such as [[turkey (bird)|turkey]], potatoes, [[sweet potato]]es, [[maize|corn]], [[squash (plant)|squash]], and [[maple syrup]], indigenous foods employed by American Indians and early European settlers, African slaves and their descendants.

The types of food served at home vary greatly and depend upon the region of the country and the family's own cultural heritage. Recent immigrants tend to eat food similar to that of their country of origin, and [[Americanization|Americanized]] versions of these cultural foods, such as [[American Chinese cuisine]], [[Tex-Mex]] (Mexican-American cuisine) or [[Italian-American cuisine]] often eventually appear; an example is [[Vietnamese cuisine]], [[Korean cuisine]] and [[Thai cuisine]]. [[German cuisine]] has a profound impact on American cuisine, especially mid-western cuisine; potatoes, noodles, roasts, stews, cakes, and other pastries are the most iconic ingredients in both cuisines.&lt;ref name="Dealing with Diversity"/&gt; Dishes such as the hamburger, pot roast, baked ham, and hot dogs are examples of American dishes derived from German cuisine.&lt;ref name="History of the hot dog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hot-dog.org/hd/hd_history.htm|title=History of the hot dog|accessdate=2006-11-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061018070129/http://www.hot-dog.org/hd/hd_history.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History of the Hamburger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahamburgertoday.com/archives/2005/08/the_history_of.php|title=History of the Hamburger|accessdate=2006-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Motherhood and apple pie.jpg|thumb|right|[[Apple pie]] is one of a number of American cultural icons]]
Different regions of the United States have their own cuisine and styles of cooking. The states of Louisiana and Mississippi, for example, is known for its [[Cajun cuisine|Cajun]] and [[Louisiana Creole cuisine|Creole cooking]]. Cajun and Creole cooking are influenced by French, Acadian, and Haitian cooking, although the dishes themselves are original and unique. Examples include Crawfish Etouffee, Red Beans and Rice, Seafood or Chicken Gumbo, Jambalaya, and Boudin. Italian, German, Hungarian and Chinese influences, traditional Native American, Caribbean, Mexican and Greek dishes have also diffused into the general American repertoire. It is not uncommon for a "middle-class" family from "middle America" to eat, for example, restaurant pizza, home-made pizza, enchiladas con carne, chicken paprikas, beef stroganof and bratwurst with sauerkraut for dinner throughout a single week.

[[Soul food]], mostly the same as food eaten by white southerners, developed by southern African slaves, and their free descendants, is popular around the South and among many [[African-Americans]] elsewhere. [[Syncretism|Syncretic]] cuisines such as Louisiana creole, Cajun, [[Pennsylvania Dutch cuisine|Pennsylvania Dutch]], and [[Tex-Mex cuisine|Tex-Mex]] are regionally important. Iconic American dishes such as [[apple pie]], [[fried chicken]], [[pizza]], [[hamburger]]s, and [[hot dog]]s derive from the recipes of various immigrants and domestic innovations. [[French fries]], Mexican dishes such as [[burrito]]s and [[taco]]s, and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are consumed.&lt;ref name="IFT"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.ift.org/cms/?pid=1000496| author=Klapthor, James N.| title=What, When, and Where Americans Eat in 2003| publisher=Institute of Food Technologists| date=2003-08-23| accessdate=2007-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family structure==
{{Further|Family structure in the United States}}
[[File:Families US.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[American family structure]] has no particular household arrangement being prevalent enough to be identified as the average&lt;ref name="Marriages, Families &amp; Intimate Relationships"&gt;{{cite book | last = Williams | first = Brian |author2=Stacey C.

Family arrangements in the United States reflect the nature of contemporary American society, as they always have. Although the [[nuclear family]] concept (two-married adults with biological children) holds a special place in the mindset of Americans, it is single-parent families, [[childless]] couples, and fused families which now constitute the majority of families.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}  A person may grow up in a single-parent family, go on to marry and live in childless couple arrangement, then get divorced, live as a single for a couple of years, remarry, have children and live in a nuclear family arrangement.&lt;ref name="Society in Focus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marriages, Families &amp; Intimate Relationships"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The nuclear family... is the idealized version of what most people think when they think of "family..." The old definition of what a family is... the nuclear family- no longer seems adequate to cover the wide diversity of household arrangements we see today, according to many social scientists (Edwards 1991; Stacey 1996). Thus has arisen the term ''postmodern family'', which is meant to describe the great variability in family forms, including single-parent families and child-free couples.- Brian K. Williams, Stacey C. Sawyer, Carl M. Wahlstrom, ''Marriages, Families &amp; Intimate Relationships'', 2005.&lt;ref name="Marriages, Families &amp; Intimate Relationships"/&gt;

Single-parent households are households consisting of a single adult (most often a woman) and one or more children. In the single-parent household, one parent typically raises the children with little to no help at all, from the other. This parent is the sole "breadwinner" of the family and thus, these households are particularly vulnerable economically. They have higher rates of [[Poverty in the United States|poverty]], and children of these households are more likely to have educational problems.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===Youth dependence===
Other changes to the landscape of American family arrangements include dual-income earner households and delayed independence among American youths. Whereas most families in the 1950s and 1960s relied on one income earner, most commonly the husband, the vast majority of family households now have two-income earners.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}{{clarify|reason=how does two incomes affect youth dependence?|date=August 2013}}

Another change is the increasing age at which young Americans leave their parental home. Traditionally, a person past "college age" who lived with their parent(s) was viewed negatively, but today it is not uncommon for children to live with their parents until their mid-twenties. This trend can be mostly attributed to rising [[Real estate pricing|living costs]] that are more expensive compared to those in decades past. Thus, many young adults now remain with their parents well past their mid-twenties. This topic was a cover article of TIME magazine in 2005.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Exceptions to the custom of leaving home in one's mid-twenties can occur especially among Italian and Hispanic Americans, and in expensive urban real estate markets such as New York City,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/NY-New-York-Pricing.html New York apartments pricing and New York NY apartment reviews] Apartment Ratings&lt;/ref&gt; California,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/CA-San-Francisco-Pricing.html San Francisco apartments pricing and San Francisco CA apartment reviews] Apartment Ratings&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Honolulu]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/HI-Honolulu-Pricing.html |title=Honolulu apartments pricing and Honolulu HI apartment reviews |website=Apartmentratings.com |accessdate=2012-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; where monthly rents commonly exceed $1,000 a month.

==Housing==
{{Expand section|material about housing pre-World War II|date=August 2016}}
[[File:831Richland.jpg|thumb|left|The [[American Foursquare]] was a popular house style from the late 19th century until the 1930s]]
Historically, Americans mainly lived in a rural environment, with a few important cities of moderate size. Following World War II, however, increasing numbers of Americans began living in the suburbs, belts around major cities with higher density than [[rural sociology|rural]] areas, but much lower than urban areas. This move has been attributed to many factors such as the automobile, the availability of large tracts of land, the convenience of more and longer paved roads, increasing violence in urban centers (see [[white flight]]), and the lower expense of housing.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

[[File:Suburban tract house.JPG|thumb|A [[Neo-eclectic architecture|neo-eclectic]] home in [[Salinas, California]]]]
These new single-family houses were usually one or two stories tall, and often were part of large contracts of homes built by a single developer and often with little variation (sometimes referred to as cookie cutter houses or homes). Houses were separated. The resulting low-density development was given the pejorative label [[urban sprawl]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

This has changed;{{how|date=October 2012}}{{when|date=October 2012}} [[white flight]] has reversed, as [[Yuppies]] and upper-middle-class, [[empty nest syndrome|empty nest]] [[Baby Boomers]] return to urban living, usually in [[condominium]]s, such as in New York City's Lower East Side, [[Chicago Loop|Chicago's South Loop]] and Miami's [[Brickell]] Neighborhood. The result has been the [[gentrification|displacement of many poorer, inner-city residents]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

American cities with housing prices near the national median have also been losing the [[Household income in the United States|middle income]] neighborhoods, those with median income between 80% and 120% of the metropolitan area's median household income. Here, the more affluent members of the middle-class, who are also often referred to as being professional or upper middle-class, have left in search of larger homes in more exclusive suburbs. This trend is largely attributed to the ''[[American middle class#Middle class squeeze|Middle-class squeeze]]'', which has caused a starker distinction between the [[American middle class#statistical middle class|statistical middle class]] and the more privileged members of the [[American middle class|middle class]].&lt;ref name="Washington Post, America is losing its middle income neighborhoods"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/21/AR2006062101735.html|title=Washington Post, America is losing its middle income neighborhoods|accessdate=2006-07-25 | work=The Washington Post | first=Blaine | last=Harden | date=2006-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more expensive areas such as California, however, another trend has been taking place where an influx of more affluent middle-class households has displaced those in the actual middle of society and converted former [[American middle class#statistical middle class|middle-middle-class]] neighborhoods into [[Upper middle class#American upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/21/AR2006062101735.html|title=Washington Post, America is losing its middle income neighborhoods.|accessdate=2006-07-25 | work=The Washington Post | first=Blaine | last=Harden | date=2006-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The population of rural areas has been declining over time as more and more people migrate to cities for work and entertainment. The great exodus from the farms came in the 1940s; in recent years fewer than 2% of the population lives on farms (though others live in the countryside and commute to work). Electricity and telephones, and sometimes cable and Internet services are available to all but the most remote regions.

About half of Americans now live in what is known as the suburbs. The suburban nuclear family has been identified as part of the "[[American Dream]]": a married couple with children owning a house in the suburbs. This archetype is reinforced by mass media, religious practices, and government policies and is based on traditions from Anglo-Saxon cultures. One of the biggest differences in suburban living as compared to urban living; is the housing occupied by the families. The suburbs are filled with single-family homes separated from retail districts, industrial areas, and sometimes even public schools. However, many American suburbs are incorporating these districts on smaller scales, attracting more people to these communities.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Housing in urban areas may include more [[apartment]]s and semi-attached homes than in the suburbs or small towns. Aside from housing, the major differences from suburban living are the density and diversity of many different subcultures, and retail and manufacturing buildings mixed with housing in urban areas.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Automobiles and commuting===

Due to the low overall population density and [[urban sprawl]], the United States is one of the few developed nations where most people commute by car.

The rise of suburbs and the need for workers to commute to cities brought about the popularity of automobiles. In 2001, 90% of Americans drove to work by car.&lt;ref name=2001summary&gt;[http://www.bts.gov/publications/highlights_of_the_2001_national_household_travel_survey/html/executive_summary.html Highlights of the 2001 National Household Travel Survey], Bureau of Transportation Statistics, U.S. Department of Transportation, accessed May 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Lower energy and land costs favor the production of relatively large, powerful cars. The culture in the 1950s and 1960s often catered to the automobile with [[motel]]s and [[drive-in restaurant]]s. Outside of the relatively few urban areas, it is considered a necessity for most Americans to own and drive cars. New York City is the only locality in the United States where more than half of all households do not own a car.&lt;ref name=2001summary /&gt;

In the 1950s and 1960s [[subcultures]] began to arise around the modification and racing of American automobiles and converting them into [[hot rods]]. Later, in the late-1960s and early-1970s Detroit manufacturers began making [[muscle cars]] and [[pony cars]] to cater to the needs of wealthier Americans seeking hot rod style, performance and appeal.

Though most Americans in the 21st century identify themselves as [[American middle class|middle class]], American society and its culture are considerably fragmented.&lt;ref name="Society in Focus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Middle class according to The Drum Major Institute for public policy"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/now/politics/middleclassoverview.html|title=Middle class according to The Drum Major Institute for public policy|accessdate=2006-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Class, A Guide through the American status system"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fussel | first = Paul | year = 1983 | title = ''Class: A Guide through the American Status System'' | publisher=Touchstone | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-671-79225-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social class, generally described as a combination of [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]], [[Income in the United States|income]] and occupational prestige, is one of the greatest cultural influences in America.&lt;ref name="Society in Focus"/&gt; Nearly all cultural aspects of mundane interactions and consumer behavior in the U.S. are guided by a person's location within the country's [[Social structure of the United States|social structure]].

Distinct lifestyles, consumption patterns and values are associated with different classes. Early sociologist-economist [[Thorstein Veblen]], for example, said that those at the very top of the social ladder engage in [[conspicuous leisure]] and [[conspicuous consumption]]. [[Managerial Class|Upper-middle-class]] persons commonly identify [[Educational attainment in the United States|education]] and being cultured as prime values. Persons in this particular [[Social structure of the United States|social class]] tend to speak in a more direct manner that projects authority, knowledge and thus credibility. They often tend to engage in the consumption of so-called mass luxuries, such as [[designer label]] clothing. A strong preference for natural materials and organic foods and a strong health consciousness tend to be prominent features of the [[Managerial Class|upper middle class]]. [[American middle-class]] individuals in general value expanding one's horizon, partially because they are more educated and can afford greater leisure and travels. Working-class individuals take great pride in doing what they consider to be "real work" and keep very close-knit kin networks that serve as a safeguard against frequent economic instability.&lt;ref name="Society in Focus"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{cite book | last = Fussel | first = Paul | year = 1983 | title = Class, A Guide through the American status system | publisher=Touchstone | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-671-79225-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ehrenreich | first = Barbara | year = 1989 | title = ''Fear of Falling: The Inner Life of the Middle Class'' | publisher=HarperCollins | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-06-097333-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Working-class Americans and many of those in the middle class may also face occupation alienation. In contrast to upper-middle-class professionals who are mostly hired to conceptualize, supervise, and share their thoughts, many Americans have little autonomy or creative latitude in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Occupation and Class Consciousness in America"&gt;{{cite book | last = Eichar | first = Douglas | year = 1989 | title = ''Occupation and Class Consciousness in America'' | publisher=Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Connecticut | isbn = 0-313-26111-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, white collar professionals tend to be significantly more satisfied with their work.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William |author2=Joseph Hickey | year = 2005 | title = Society in Focus | publisher=Pearson | location = Boston, MA | isbn = 0-205-41365-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;{{cite book | last = Eichar | first = Douglas | year = 1989 | title = Occupation and Class Consciousness in America | publisher=Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Connecticut | isbn = 0-313-26111-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, [[Elizabeth Warren]] presented her article entitled "The Middle Class on the Precipice", stating that individuals in the center of the income strata, who may still identify as middle class, have faced increasing economic insecurity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Warren|first=Elizabeth|author-link1=Elizabeth Warren|url=https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2006/01/the-middle-class-on-the-html|title= The Middle Class on the Precipice - Rising financial risks for American families|date=January 2006|journal=[[Harvard Magazine]]|accessdate=August 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; supporting the idea of a working-class majority.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite book | last = Ehrenreich | first = Barbara | year = 1989 | title = Fear of Falling, The Inner Life of the Middle Class | publisher=Harper Collins | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-06-097333-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political behavior is affected by class; more affluent individuals are more likely to vote, and education and income affect whether individuals tend to vote for the Democratic or Republican party. [[Income in the United States|Income]] also had a significant impact on health as those with higher [[Income in the United States|incomes]] had better access to health care facilities, higher [[life expectancy]], lower [[infant mortality rate]] and increased health consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collison|first1=D.|last2=Dey|first2=C.|last3=Hannah|first3=G.|last4=Stevenson|first4=L. |url=https://academic.oup.com/jpubhealth/article/29/2/114/1505115|title=Income inequality and child mortality in wealthy nations|date=June 2007|department=Discussion-What is already known on this topic|journal=Journal of Public Health|volume=29|issue=2|page=116|doi=10.1093/pubmed/fdm009|accessdate=August 19, 2018|quote=[There] was evidence to suggest a statistically significant association between infant mortality and income inequality...this effect may have been because of the disproportionate influence of the USA which has 'exceptionally high income inequality and poor child health'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite work|last=Ehrenfreund|first=Max|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/09/how-income-affects-life-expectancy/|title=How income affects life expectancy|date=September 25, 2015|work=[[World Economic Forum]]|accessdate=August 19, 2018|quote=More affluent Americans have quit smoking en masse over the past few decades, but the poor have not...Richer beneficiaries live longer &amp; cash more generous checks from Social Security.

In the United States occupation is one of the prime factors of [[Social structure of the United States|social class]] and is closely linked to an individual's identity. The average work week in the U.S. for those employed full-time was 42.9 hours long with 30% of the population working more than 40 hours a week.&lt;ref name="U.S. Bureau of Labor, hours worked, 2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/lf/aat19.txt|title=U.S. Bureau of Labor, hours worked, 2005|accessdate=2006-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Average American worker earned $16.64 an hour in the first two quarters of 2006.&lt;ref name="U.S. Department of Labor, employment in 2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm|title=U.S. Department of Labor, employment in 2006|accessdate=2006-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall Americans worked more than their counterparts in other developed post-industrial nations.

In 2000 the average American worked 1,978 hours per year, 500 hours more than the average German, yet 100 hours less than the average [[Czech Republic|Czech]]. Overall the U.S. labor force is one of the most productive in the world, largely due to its workers working more than those in any other post-industrial country (excluding [[South Korea]]).&lt;ref name="CNN, work in American, UN report finds Americans most productive, 2002"/&gt; Americans generally hold working and being productive in high regard; being busy and working extensively may also serve as the means to obtain esteem.&lt;ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class"/&gt;

Race in the United States is based on physical characteristics &amp; skin color and has played an essential part in shaping American society even before the nation's conception.&lt;ref name="Society in Focus"/&gt; Until the civil rights movement of the 1960s, racial minorities in the United States faced [[institutionalized discrimination]] and both social and economic marginalization.&lt;ref name="The African American Odyssey"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hine|first=Darlene|author2=William C. Hine |author3=Stanley Harrold |year=2006|title=The African American Odyssey|publisher=Pearson|location=Boston, MA|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of the Census recognizes four races, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American or American Indian]], African American, [[Asian American|Asian]] and [[White American|White]] ([[European American]]). According to the U.S. government, Hispanic Americans do not constitute a race, but rather an ethnic group. During the 2000 U.S. Census, Whites made up 75.1% of the population; those who are Hispanic or Latino constituted the nation's prevalent minority with 12.5% of the population.

The [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]—ratified on Dec 6, 1865—abolished slavery in the United States. The northern states had outlawed slavery in their territory in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth century, though their industrial economies relied on raw materials produced by slaves. Following the Reconstruction period in the 1870s, racist legislation emerged in the Southern states named the [[Jim Crow laws]] that provided for legal segregation. Lynching was practiced throughout the U.S., including in the Northern states, until the 1930s, while continuing well into the civil rights movement in the South.&lt;ref name="The African American Odyssey"/&gt;

Chinese Americans were earlier marginalized as well during a significant proportion of U.S. history. Between 1882-1943 the United States instituted the [[Chinese Exclusion Act (United States)|Chinese Exclusion Act]] barring all Chinese immigrants from entering the United States.

Due to exclusion from or marginalization by earlier mainstream society, there emerged a unique subculture among the racial minorities in the United States. During the 1920s, [[Harlem, New York]] became home to the [[Harlem Renaissance]]. Music styles such as [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[hip hop music|rap]], [[rock and roll]], and numerous folk-songs such as [[Blue Tail Fly|Blue Tail Fly (Jimmy Crack Corn)]] originated within the realms of African-American culture, and were later adopted by the mainstream.&lt;ref name="The African American Odyssey"/&gt; Chinatowns can be found in many cities across the country and Asian cuisine has become a common staple in mainstream America.

Economic variance and substantive segregation, is commonplace in the United States. Asian Americans have [[Household income in the United States|median household income]] and [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]] exceeding that of other races.

After the attacks by Muslim terrorists on September 11, 2001, discrimination against Arabs and Muslims in the U.S. rose significantly.

==Death and funerals==
{{Off topic|date=January 2013}}
[[File:Pond in Mount Auburn Cemetery.jpg|thumb|[[Mount Auburn Cemetery]]]]

It is customary for Americans to hold a [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] in a [[funeral home]] within a couple days of the death of a loved one. The body of the deceased may be [[embalmed]] and dressed in fine clothing if there will be an open-casket [[Viewing (funeral)|viewing]]. Traditional Jewish and Muslim practice include a ritual bath and no embalming. Friends, relatives and acquaintances gather, often from distant parts of the country, to "pay their last respects" to the deceased. Flowers are brought to the [[coffin]] and sometimes [[eulogy|eulogies]], [[elegy|elegies]], personal anecdotes or group prayers are recited. Otherwise, the attendees sit, stand or kneel in quiet contemplation or prayer. Kissing the corpse on the forehead is typical among Italian Americans&lt;ref name="The Italian Way of Death"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/weekly/paglia960805.html|title=The Italian Way of Death|website=Salon.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503064519/http://www.salon.com/weekly/paglia960805.html|archivedate=May 3, 2009 |accessdate=2009-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others. [[Condolences]] are also offered to the widow or widower and other close relatives.

[[File:Tomb of the Unknowns crack.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Tomb of the Unknowns]]]]

A funeral may be held immediately afterwards or the next day. The funeral ceremony varies according to religion and culture. American Catholics typically hold a [[Catholic funeral|funeral mass]] in a church, which sometimes takes the form of a [[Requiem]] mass. Jewish Americans may hold a service in a synagogue or temple. [[Pallbearer]]s carry the coffin of the deceased to the [[hearse]], which then proceeds in a [[procession]] to the place of final repose, usually a cemetery. The unique [[Jazz funeral]] of New Orleans features joyous and raucous music and dancing during the procession.

[[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] (founded in 1831) is known as "America's first garden cemetery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Old Cambridge |last=Bunting |first=Bainbridge |author2=Robert H. Nylander |year=1973 |publisher=Cambridge Historical Commission |location= Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0-262-53014-7 |page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; American [[cemetery|cemeteries]] created since are distinctive for their [[rural cemetery|park-like setting]]. Rows of [[grave (burial)|grave]]s are covered by [[lawn]]s and are interspersed with trees and flowers. [[Headstone]]s, [[mausoleum]]s, statuary or simple plaques typically mark off the individual graves. [[Cremation]] is another common practice in the United States, though it is frowned upon by various religions. The ashes of the deceased are usually placed in an [[urn]], which may be kept in a private house, or they are interred. Sometimes the ashes are released into the atmosphere. The "sprinkling" or "scattering" of the ashes may be part of an informal ceremony, often taking place at a scenic natural feature (a cliff, lake or mountain) that was favored by the deceased.

A so-called [[death industry]] has developed in the United States that has replaced earlier, more informal traditions. Before the popularity of funeral homes, people usually held wakes in the [[parlour]] rooms of private houses.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Sociological issues==

===Marriage and divorce===
{{Main|Marriage in the United States|Divorce in the United States}}
{{See also|Cohabitation in the United States}}
[[File:Marilyn Monroe and Jerry Giesler 3.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marilyn Monroe]] signing divorce papers with celebrity attorney [[Jerry Giesler]]]]
Marriage laws are established by individual states. The typical wedding involves a couple proclaiming their commitment to one another in front of their close relatives and friends, often presided over by a religious figure such as a minister, priest, or rabbi, depending upon the faith of the couple. In traditional Christian ceremonies, the bride's father will "give away" (hand off) the bride to the groom. Secular weddings are also common, often presided over by a judge, [[Justice of the Peace]], or other municipal official. [[Same-sex marriage]] is legal in all states. [[Polygamy]] is universally banned.

[[Divorce]] is the province of state governments, so divorce law varies from state to state. Prior to the 1970s, divorcing spouses had to allege that the other spouse was guilty of a crime or [[sin]] like abandonment or adultery; when spouses simply could not get along, lawyers were forced to manufacture "uncontested" divorces. The [[no-fault divorce]] revolution began in 1969 in California; New York and South Dakota were the [[No-fault divorce#The adoption of no-fault divorce laws by the other states|last states to begin allowing no-fault divorce]]. No-fault divorce on the grounds of "irreconcilable differences" is now available in all states. However, many states have recently required separation periods prior to a formal divorce decree.

State law provides for [[child support]] where children are involved, and sometimes for [[alimony]]. "Married adults now divorce two-and-a-half times as often as adults did 20 years ago and four times as often as they did 50 years ago... between 40% and 60% of ''new'' marriages will eventually end in divorce. The probability within... the first five years is 20%, and the probability of its ending within the first 10 years is 33%... Perhaps 25% of children ages 16 and under live with a stepparent."&lt;ref&gt;Brian K. Williams, Stacy C. Sawyer, Carl M. Wahlstrom, ''Marriages, Families &amp; Intimate Relationships'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The median length for a marriage in the U.S. today is 11 years with 90% of all divorces being settled out of court.

Throughout most of the country's history following independence from Great Britain, the majority race in the United States has been Caucasian, and the largest racial minority has been African-Americans. This relationship has historically been the most important one since the founding of the United States. Currently, most African-Americans are descendants of African slaves imported to the United States, though some are more recent immigrants or their descendants. Slavery existed in the United States at the time of the country's formation in the 1770s. The U.S. banned importation of slaves in 1808. Slavery was partially abolished by the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] issued by president [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1862 for slaves in the Southeastern United States during the Civil War. Slavery was rendered illegal by the passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. [[Jim Crow Laws]] prevented full use of African American citizenship until the 20th century. The [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the 1960s and the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] outlawed official or legal segregation in public places or limited access to minorities.

Relations between white Americans and other racial or ethnic groups have been a source of tension at various times in U.S. history. With the advent of European colonization, and continuing into the early years of the republic, relations between whites and Native American was a significant issue. In 1882, in response to Chinese immigration due to the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]] and the labor needed for the Transcontinental Railroad, the U.S. signed into law the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] which banned immigration by Chinese people into the U.S. In the late 19th century, the growth of the Hispanic population in the U.S., fueled largely by Mexican immigration, generated debate over policies such as English as the official language and reform to immigration policies.

A huge majority of Americans of all races disapprove of racism. Nevertheless, some Americans continue to hold negative racial/ethnic [[Stereotypes of groups within the United States|stereotypes]] about various racial and ethnic groups. Professor Imani Perry, of [[Princeton University]], has argued that contemporary [[racism]] in the United States "is frequently unintentional or unacknowledged on the part of the actor",&lt;ref&gt;Imani Perry, More Beautiful More Terrible: The Embrace and Transcendence of Racial Inequality in the United States, New York University Press: 2011, p7&lt;/ref&gt; believing that racism mostly stems unconsciously from below the level of cognition.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drugs and alcohol===
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2012}}
{{Further|History of United States drug prohibition}}
[[File:Just Say No.jpg|thumb|"Just Say No" paraphernalia at the [[Ronald Reagan Presidential Library|Reagan Library]] display]]

American attitudes towards drugs and alcoholic beverages have evolved considerably throughout the country's history. In the 19th century, alcohol was readily available and consumed, and no laws restricted the use of other drugs. Attitudes on drug addiction started to change, resulting in the [[Harrison Narcotics Tax Act|Harrison Act]], which eventually became proscriptive.

A movement to ban alcoholic beverages, called the [[Temperance movement|Temperance]] movement, emerged in the late 19th century. Several American Protestant religious groups and women's groups, such as the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]], supported the movement. In 1919, Prohibitionists succeeded in [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|amending the Constitution]] to prohibit the sale of alcohol. Although the Prohibition period did result in lowering alcohol consumption overall,{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} banning alcohol outright proved to be unworkable, as the previously legitimate distillery industry was replaced by criminal gangs that trafficked in alcohol. Prohibition [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|was repealed]] in 1933. States and localities retained the right to remain "dry", and to this day, [[dry county|a handful]] still do.

During the [[Vietnam War]] era, attitudes swung well away from prohibition. Commentators noted that an 18-year-old could be [[Conscription in the United States|drafted]] to war but could not buy a beer.

Since 1980, the trend has been toward greater restrictions on alcohol and drug use. The focus this time, however, has been to criminalize behaviors associated with alcohol, rather than attempt to prohibit consumption outright. New York was the first state to enact tough [[drunk-driving]] laws in 1980; since then all other states have followed suit. All states have also banned the purchase of alcoholic beverages by individuals under 21.

A "[[Just Say No]] to Drugs" movement replaced the more liberal ethos of the 1960s. This led to stricter drug laws and greater police latitude in drug cases. Drugs are, however, widely available, and 16% of Americans 12 and older used an illicit drug in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Survey of Drug Use and Health|url=http://www.drugabuse.gov/national-survey-drug-use-health|accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1990s, [[marijuana]] use has become increasingly tolerated in America, and a number of states allow the [[Medical cannabis in the United States|use of marijuana for medical purposes]]. In most states marijuana is still illegal without medical prescription. Since the 2012 general election, voters in the District of Columbia and the states of [[Alaska]], [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Maine]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Nevada]], [[Oregon]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]] approved the legalization of marijuana for recreational use. Marijuana is classified as illegal under federal law.

==Volunteerism==
[[Alexis de Tocqueville|De Tocqueville]] first noted, in 1835, the American attitude towards helping others in need. A 2011 [[Charities Aid Foundation]] study found that Americans were the first most willing to help a stranger and donate time and money in the world at 60%. Many low-level crimes are punished by assigning hours of "[[community service]]", a requirement that the offender perform volunteer work;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first=David | last=Crary | title=Study finds Americans in generous mood | url=http://silentrebellion.newsvine.com/_news/2010/09/09/5079433-11-most-generous-countries-of-2010| publisher=Burlington Free Press | location=Burlington, Vermont | pages= 1A | date=September 9, 2010 | id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---note that location of soft copy and hard copy differ.

Since US citizens are required to attend [[jury duty]], they can be jurors in legal proceedings.

==Military culture==

[[File:USmilitary.JPG|thumb|Service members of the U.S. at an [[American football]] event, L-R: [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]], [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]], [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] and [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] personnel]]
From the time of its inception the military played a decisive role in the [[history of the United States]]. A sense of national unity and identity was forged out of the victorious [[First Barbary War]], [[Second Barbary War]], and the [[War of 1812]]. Even so, the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founders]] were suspicious of a permanent military force and not until the outbreak of [[World War II]] did a large standing army become officially established. The [[National Security Act of 1947]], adopted following World War II and during the onset of the Cold War, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level [[United States Department of War|Department of War]] and the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]] into the [[United States Department of Defense|National Military Establishment]] (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the [[United States Department of the Air Force|Department of the Air Force]] and National Security Council.

The U.S. military is one of the largest militaries in terms of number of personnel. It draws its manpower from a large pool of paid [[Volunteer military|volunteers]]; although [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]] has been used in the past in various times of both war and peace, it has not been used since 1972. As of 2011, the United States spends about $550&amp;nbsp;billion annually to fund its military forces,&lt;ref name="Budget FY2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy12/pdf/BUDGET-2012-BUD-7.pdf |title=Federal Government Outlays by Function and Subfunction: 1962–2015 Fiscal Year 2011 (Table 3.2) |authorlink=[[United States Department of Defense]] |publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]] |accessdate=21 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330224158/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy12/pdf/BUDGET-2012-BUD-7.pdf |archivedate=March 30, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and appropriates approximately $160&amp;nbsp;billion to fund [[War on Terrorism|Overseas Contingency Operations]]. Put together, the United States constitutes roughly [[List of countries by military expenditures|43 percent of the world's military expenditures]]. The U.S. armed forces as a whole possess large quantities of advanced and powerful equipment, along with widespread placement of forces around the world, giving them significant capabilities in both defense and [[power projection]].

There is and has been a strong military culture among those on active duty, those in the Reserve and National Guard, those retired from the military, and honorably discharged veterans who never served long enough on active duty and/or in the Reserve or National Guard to qualify for military retirement pay and benefits.

==Gun culture==
{{Main|Gun culture in the United States}}

In sharp contrast to most other [[developed nations]], [[Gun law in the United States|firearms laws in the United States]] are permissive and private gun ownership is common; almost half of American households contain at least one firearm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.gallup.com/poll/150353/self-reported-gun-ownership-highest-1993.aspx| title=Self-Reported Gun Ownership in U.S. Is Highest Since 1993| website=Gallup.com | date=October 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, there are more privately owned firearms in the United States than in any other country, both ''per capita'' and in total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2834893820070828| title=U.S. most armed country with 90 guns per 100 people| publisher=[[Reuters]] | date=August 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as freedom of religion is considered to be guaranteed by the First Amendment, considerable freedom to possess firearms is often considered by the people and the courts to be guaranteed by the Second Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news| url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf| title=US District of Columbia et al v Heller | publisher=US Supreme Court| date=June 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilians in the United States possess about 42% of the global inventory of privately owned firearms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/H-Research_Notes/SAS-Research-Note-9.pdf |title=Research Notes:Estimating Civilian Owned Firearms | publisher=Small Arms Survey |access-date=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rates of gun ownership vary significantly by region and by state; gun ownership is most common in [[Alaska]], the [[Mountain States]], and [[Southern United States|the South]], and least prevalent in Hawaii, the [[Territories of the United States|island territories]], [[California]], and the [[Northeast megalopolis]]. Gun ownership tends to be more common in rural than in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/health/interactives/guns/ownership.html| title=Gun Ownership by State|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunting, [[plinking]] and [[target shooting]] are popular pastimes, although ownership of firearms for purely utilitarian purposes such as personal protection is common as well. In fact, personal protection was the most common reason given for gun ownership in a 2013 Gallup poll of gun owners, at 60%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.gallup.com/poll/165605/personal-safety-top-reason-americans-own-guns-today.aspx| title=Personal Safety Top Reason Americans Own Guns Today| website=Gallup.com | date=October 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ownership of [[handguns]], while not uncommon, is less common than ownership of [[long guns]]. Gun ownership is considerably more prevalent among men than among women; men are approximately four times more likely than women to report owning guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/13/1/15.full| title=The U.S. gun stock: results from the 2004 national firearms survey |work=Injury Prevention Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governmental role==
In the [[federal government of the United States]], responsibilities that are usually in a [[Ministry of Culture|cultural minister]]'s portfolio elsewhere are divided among the [[President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities]], the [[Federal Communications Commission]], the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]], the [[United States Department of Commerce|U.S. Department of Commerce]], the [[United States Department of the Interior|U.S. Department of the Interior]], the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]], the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], the [[United States Commission of Fine Arts|U.S. Commission of Fine Arts]], the [[Library of Congress]], the [[Smithsonian Institution]], and the [[National Gallery of Art]]. However, many state and city governments have a department dedicated to cultural affairs.

==Influence==
&lt;!---probably ought to merge next two paragraphs--&gt;
The Hollywood cinema industry has been very influential on American culture, and to some extent in global culture through transmission of American movies overseas and as other film cultures like [[Bollywood]] have striven to emulate the American model.

The United States has influenced the cultures of many other countries, but as countries around the world become more inter-connected and inter-dependent, the general cultural trends (of the US and other countries) head towards [[multiculturalism]] and sociocultural [[globalization]].

'''Cutup''' is a group of London-based artists, whose work mainly revolves around the manipulation of [[billboard]] [[advertisements]]. Their first works consisted of removing a billboard, painstakingly cutting it up into roughly 4000 small rectangles, each one in essence a [[pixel]], and then reassembling the billboard.

More recently, Cutup have started other projects, such as replacing small bus-shelter advertisements with a drilled sheet of wood. The illuminating back lights that turn on at dusk reveal an image, as the many holes light up against the dark background.

Although they mainly deal with art on the street, the group have also created installations, including setting 96 different alarm clocks one a minute apart and sound installations, made up of 94 speakers, mini disks and circuit boards.

==Shows and exhibitions==
Cutup have held shows in London, New York and Barcelona, including two shows at London's [[Seventeen Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.17space.com/index.php?p=3&amp;id=3 Seventeen Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; including a recent show which exhibited a full size billboard and a bus shelter, brought inside especially for the show, as well as related video and film pieces.

Other shows have included "La Vida Te Espera" at [[NIU Gallery]], Barcelona in June 2006, "Satellites", at [[Tanya Bonakdar Gallery]], New York and a show at the Kemistry Gallery in Shoreditch.

'''''Dastūr al-Mulūk''''' ({{lang-fa|دستور الملوک}})&lt;ref&gt;Variants: ''Dastur al-Moluk'', ''Dastur-ol-Moluk'', ''Dastur-ul-Muluk'', ''Dastūr-ul-Mulūk''.&lt;/ref&gt; is one of only three surviving [[administrative handbook]]s from early 18th-century [[Safavid]] [[Iran]] and an important research tool for scholars in [[Iranology]]. The Persian manuscript was edited during the 1960s by the Iranian scholar [[Mohammad Taqi Danesh Pajouh]].

A Russian translation by Dr Vil'danova appeared in [[Tashkent]], [[Uzbekistan]], in the 1990s. In 2002, an annotated English translation ({{ISBN|983-9379-26-7}}), which contains also a facsimile of what was then thought among scholars to be the complete manuscript, was published and translated into English for the first time by the German scholar [[:de:Christoph Marcinkowski|Christoph Marcinkowski]], based on his dissertation. 

Already in 2000, this dissertation was awarded by then Iranian President [[Mohammad Khatami]] the First Prize for Best Research on Iranian Culture Award for the Year 2000 (International Category) by the Iranian Ministry of Culture. A Persian translation of Marcinkowski's 2002 study by Ali Kordabadi and Mansur Sefatgol appeared in 1385 AH solar (2006 CE) in Tehran at Markaz-e Asnad va Tarikh-e Diplomasi (published by the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs). 

Subsequently, the Iranian scholar [[Iraj Afshar]] discovered and edited the remainder of the manuscript. This part, too, was translated into English and discussed by Dr. Marcinkowski in the ''[[Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft]]'', the journal of the [[Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft|German Oriental Society]] (see below).

The '''Demirköy Foundry''' ({{lang-tr|Demirköy Dökümhanesi}}) is a historic [[foundry]] ruin of [[archaeology|archaeological]] importance located at [[Demirköy, Kırklareli|Demirköy]] in [[Kırklareli Province]], northwestern Turkey.

==Location==
The archaeological site is situated {{convert|3.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of the district seat Demirköy.&lt;ref name="ji"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kkve"/&gt; An iron metalworking center was established at this location in the 15th century during the [[Ottoman Empire]] due to the rich iron ore deposits in the region. The site is deep in the [[Strandzha]] forests, about {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} far from the [[Black Sea]] coast and {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the Bulgarian-Turkish border.&lt;ref name="ji"/&gt;

==History==
It is known that the [[round shot|cannonball]]s fired during the [[Fall of Constantinople|conquest of Constantinople]] in 1453 by [[Ottoman Sultan]] [[Mehmed II]] (Fatih Sultan Mehmet, Mehmed the Conqueror) were manufactured here.&lt;ref name="trt1"/&gt; The facility is also called today by the local people as '''Fatih Foundry''' (the "Conqueror's Foundry").&lt;ref name="mh1"/&gt; Demirköy means literally "Ironville". [[casting (metalworking)|Iron casting]] continued in the foundry from the mid-15th century until the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="db"/&gt; It appears that the foundry underwent a thoroughgoing renovation during the [[Mahmud II]] (1808–1839) period.&lt;ref name="db"/&gt; The foundry was then subordinated to the administration of Imperial Cannon Factory (Tophane-i Amire) in [[Istanbul]], which was established in 1839. According to the Ottoman documents,&lt;ref name="mh1"/&gt; its historic name was "Samakocuk Dökümhane-i Amiresi" (literally: Samakocuk İmperial Foundry).&lt;ref name="m"/&gt;

According to a 1923-published report of the government doctor in Kırklareli, the foundry was destroyed by the invading Russian troops during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)]].&lt;ref name="gt1"/&gt; In 1913, the state-owned foundry was leased to a British company for a period of 99 years, but in 1916 the lease was annulled due to the circumstances of [[World War I]]. After World War I, the foundry was abandoned; its structure, however, remained intact until the 1950s.&lt;ref name="m"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt; The metal parts of the foundry were sold to scrappers by the National Estate Authority ({{lang-tr|Milli Emlak}}) in 1947.&lt;ref name="gt1"/&gt;

==Archaeological findings==
The [[Kırklareli Museum]] identified and registered the remains of the Ottoman foundry as an archaeological conservation area in September 1991.&lt;ref name="ji"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kkve"/&gt; In May 2002, a research project was initiated on the iron mining and metalworking in the area. Archival investigations, surface surveys and archaeological excavations at the partly preserved site, which covers a total area of {{convert|9395|m2|sqft|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="kkve"/&gt; began in the summer of 2003.&lt;ref name="kkve"/&gt;

Important finds of industrial archaeology, unearthed in 2005 at a site {{convert|230|-|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} far from the original site, revealed the existence of another metalworking workshop with two melting furnaces.&lt;ref name="mh1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m"/&gt; The workshop was {{convert|20|x|50|m|ft|abbr=on}} in dimension and consisted of two sections with a central entrance. While the eastern wing furnace was identified as a [[blast furnace]] for iron production showing advanced technology of the 17th century, the west-wing furnace was used for [[copper]] smelting. According to 19th-century Ottoman documents, copper production was the second major activity following iron metalworking in the foundries of Demirköy-Samakocuk. Copper was used for [[list of copper alloys|copper alloy]] to make molds for casting cannonballs.&lt;ref name="ji"/&gt;
 
The units of the main foundry complex, which was built in a square-plan on a hillside, are situated on two ground levels of {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} difference in elevation. The upper section was fortified by {{convert|1.10|m|ft|abbr=on}}-thick and {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}}-high surrounding [[stone wall]]s with polygon-formed [[bastion]]s on the corners.&lt;ref name="m"/&gt; The main gate in the north opened to the courtyard at this upper terrace, which contains living and service spaces, a partly-preserved Ottoman [[Turkish bath|hammam]] and a [[mosque]].&lt;ref name="kkve"/&gt;&lt;ref name="trt1"/&gt; The quarters of the foundry workers for living and sleeping were placed along the walls in the north, west and east. In the southwest of the courtyard, the basement walls of the foundry mosque is situated with a brick minaret erected on stone base next to it.&lt;ref name="m"/&gt;

Foundry's production units were on the lower-level terrace south of the fortified courtyard. During the excavations in 2008, an iron workshop with two melting furnaces was unearthed southeast of the courtyard. While the archaeological excavations in the upper ground level are completed, research in the lower ground level is ongoing.&lt;ref name="m"/&gt;

In order to achieve high temperature needed in the melting fırnaces, [[bellows]] were utilized, which were worked up by a [[water wheel]]. It is believed that the power was transmitted from the water wheel to the bellows by a horizontal shaft.&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt; An open-deck canal northeast of the foundry provided [[water supply]] from a creek. The canal reaches the iron-made water wheel in the lower ground level after entering the facility under the eastern fortification wall in a brick [[vault (architecture)|vault]]-like tunnel, and running southwards under the courtyard.&lt;ref name="kkve"/&gt; This main canal has branches within the facility, and serves also the workshop far outside. During the excavations, iron parts and one of the bases belonging to the water wheel were found.&lt;ref name="ji"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m"/&gt;

Archaeologists discovered around the foundry the existence of a historic [[underground mine]] [[adit]] and metallurgy pits beside ruins of melting furnaces, [[slag]] heap deposits and [[charcoal]] piles. Scientific research revealed that processing of [[cast iron]] and [[ferroalloy]] was done here.&lt;ref name="m"/&gt;

Unearthed archaeological artifacts include molds for round shot, cannonballs of various size, nails of various length, iron powder, ashes, furnace [[blowpipe (tool)|blowpipe]]s, samples of domestic and imported [[fire brick]]s, parts of agricultural equipment, porcelain kitchenware and household tools manufactured in later years.&lt;ref name="trt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gt1"/&gt;

According to Ottoman documents of the 18th and 19th century, the [[intermediate good|semi-finished product]]s of the foundry were sent to "Tophane-i Amire" (Imperial Cannon Factory) and "[[Tersane-i Amire]]" (Imperial Shipyard) in Istanbul from the port of [[İğneada]] on the Black Sea coast.&lt;ref name="m"/&gt;

It is projected that the foundry will be transformed into an [[open-air museum]] for [[industrial archaeology]] after completion of the archaeological works, currently carried out by 35 archaeologists from several Turkish universities under the supervision of [[Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University]].&lt;ref name="trt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt; The foundry moaque building will be redeveloped as an industry museum for traditional iron production techniques.&lt;ref name="kkve"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2670">A '''discourse relation''' (or '''rhetorical relation''') is a description of how two segments of [[discourse]] are [[logic]]ally connected to one another.

One method of modeling discourse involves a set of concepts that constitute "[[segmented discourse representation theory]]" (SDRT).

'''Father-Daughter Day''' (sometimes called '''National Father-Daughter Day''') is a holiday recognized annually on the second Sunday of October in the United States, honoring the relationship between a father and a daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2017chasescalendarofevents.com/index.php|title=2017 CHASE'S Calendar of Events|website=2017chasescalendarofevents.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[Mother's Day]] and [[Father's Day]], it is not federally recognized.
	
==History==
The U.S. holiday was originally conceived by [[Smokey Robinson]] to honor his relationship with his six daughters. In human development the relationship between fathers and sons overshadows the bond with daughters. This holiday promotes the development of young women through their father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primarywave.com/smokey-robinson-announces-the-launch-of-father-daughter-day-on-october-8th/|title=Smokey Robinson Announces The Launch Of Father Daughter Day on October 8th – Primary Wave|website=primarywave.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Robinson stated: “There are many different kinds of families today, and we know that all parental relationships are important to the healthy development of children, but the father/daughter bond is unique and one that is near to my heart. The father/daughter relationship shapes a young woman’s perspective of men and what to expect from them. I believe that female empowerment begins in the home and fathers must set a healthy example through their personal actions and interactions.”

===Celebration===
Examples of commemoration during Father-Daughter Day can be both commercial or intangible. Nonmaterial examples of observances during this day include embracing one another with hugs, spending quality time together, and honoring their presence in your life.

In September 2017, [[Rockabye Baby!|Rockabye Baby! Music]] released a [[lullaby]] version of Smokey Robinson's "[[My Girl (The Temptations song)|My Girl]]" to support the holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rockabyebabymusic.com/collections/music/products/lullaby-rendition-of-temptations-my-girl|title=Lullaby Rendition of Temptations' "My Girl"|website=Rockabye Baby!}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, greeting card company [[American Greetings]] announced their plan to release a line of eCards with Smokey Robinson to celebrate the launch of Father-Daughter Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.americangreetings.com/ecards/smokey-robinson|title=Smokey Robinson's songs are now ecards!|website=AmericanGreetings.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Feminism sidebar}}

'''Feminist archaeology''' employs a [[feminism|feminist]] perspective in interpreting past societies. It often focuses on gender, but also considers gender in tandem with other factors, such as [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[Race (classification of humans)|race]], or [[Class (social)|class]]. Feminist [[archaeology]] has critiqued the uncritical application of modern, Western norms and values to past societies. It is additionally concerned with switching a perceived [[Androcentrism|androcentric]] bias in the structuring disciplinary norms of archaeology with a [[Gynocentrism|gynocentric]] bias within the profession.

==Emergence of feminist archaeology==
Feminist archaeology initially emerged in the late 1970s and early 80s, along with other objections to the [[epistemology]] espoused by the [[Processual archaeology|processual school]] of archaeological thought, such as symbolic and [[hermeneutics|hermeneutic]] archaeologies. [[Margaret Conkey]] and [[Janet D. Spector|Janet Spector’s]] 1984 paper ''Archaeology and the Study of Gender'' summed up the feminist critique of the discipline at that time: that archaeologists were unproblematically overlaying modern-day, Western gender norms onto past societies, for example in the sexual division of labor; that contexts and artifacts attributed to the activities of men, such as projectile point production and butchering at kill sites, were prioritized in research time and funding; and that the very character of the discipline was constructed around masculine values and norms. For example, women were generally encouraged to pursue laboratory studies instead of fieldwork (although there were exceptions throughout the history of the discipline)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hays-Gilpin |first=Kelley |date=September 1, 2000 |title=Feminist Scholarship in Archaeology |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/000271620057100107 |journal=[[Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science]] |volume=571 |issue=1 |pages=89-106 |publisher=[[Sage Publications, Inc.]] |agency=[[American Academy of Political and Social Science]] |doi=10.1177/000271620057100107 |issn=0002-7162 |oclc=1479265 |jstor=1049136}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the image of the archaeologist was centered on the rugged, masculine, “cowboy of science”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gero |first=Joan M. |author-link=Joan M. Gero |date=April 1985 |title=Sociopolitics and the Woman-at-Home Ideology |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-antiquity/article/div-classtitlesocio-politics-and-the-woman-at-home-ideologydiv/3AF8B813BE28E983FC3A6212CA68C44B |journal=[[American Antiquity]] |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=342-350 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |doi=10.2307/280492 |jstor=280492 |issn=0002-7316}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1991, two publications marked the emergence of feminist archaeology on a large scale: the edited volume ''Engendering Archaeology'',{{sfn|Gero|Conkey|1991}} which focused on women in prehistory, and a thematic issue of the journal ''Historical Archaeology'',&lt;ref&gt;(1991 Vol. 25 No. 4)&lt;/ref&gt; which focused on women and gender in post-Columbian America.  Outside the Americas, feminist archaeology enjoyed an earlier emergence and greater support among the greater archaeological community.

===Early feminist studies===
Notable challenges raised by early feminist archaeologists have concerned hunting and [[Stone tool|stone tool-making]], among many other topics. The [[Man the Hunter]] paradigm in anthropology, named after a symposium given in the 1960s by some of the most prominent names in archaeology, bifurcated the [[hominid]] [[Sexual Division of Labor (Evolutionary Perspective)|sexual division of labor]] along male and female sexes. Males were in charge of hunting, and presumably through this activity developed important evolutionary traits, such as increased brain size. Meanwhile, females stayed at home and raised the young. An assumption behind this model is that women were constrained from certain activities due to decreased mobility resulting from pregnancy and their role in raising young children. This model has been critiqued by feminist anthropologists, as underplaying the evolutionary importance of women in favor of portraying them strictly as passive objects of reproduction and nothing more. Adrienne Zihlman, tracing the evolutionary achievements ascribed to males as hunters, pointed out that female gathering activities could just as easily account for such adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1981 |title=Woman the Gatherer |first=Frances |last=Dahlberg |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=eTPULzP1MZAC&amp;printsec=frontcover |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |pages=250 |isbn=9780300029895}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joan Gero]]{{sfn|Gero|Conkey|1991|loc="Genderlithics: Women's Roles in Stone Tool Production"}} challenged androcentric explanations of tool-making on several levels. First, the common assumption that tool-making was almost exclusively associated with men was almost certainly false; at the least, women were far more likely to produce their own tools as needed in domestic contexts rather than wait for a man to come along and do it for them. The argument behind this assumption, that men possess greater upper-body strength, was dismissed by Gero, who pointed out physical strength is not an imperative quality in someone skilled at making stone tools. Additionally, Gero pointed out the great emphasis in research time and money towards studies concerned with the most “masculine” of stone tools, such as projectile points, while stone tools likely made and used by women, for example utilized flakes, have been relatively ignored.

== Feminist and gender archaeologies ==
Since the early feminist critiques of archaeology, gender has gained enormous popularity within the discipline. The label “feminist” has not been embraced by most archaeologists, however. A split between gender and feminist archaeologies formed during the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Wylie 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Gender archaeology has become a wide umbrella, including, but not limited to, feminist work that employs [[queer theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Caesalla 2000. Bulldaggers and Gentle Ladies: Archaeological Approaches to Female Homosexuality in Convict-Era Australia. ''Archaeologies of Sexuality'' ed. Robert Schmidt and Barbara Voss 160-178; Voss 2000. Colonial Sex: Archaeology, Structured Space, and Sexuality in Alta California's Spanish-Colonial Missions. See Schmidt and Voss volume 35-61&lt;/ref&gt; [[practice theory]],&lt;ref&gt;DeCunzo 1995. Reform, respite, ritual: An archaeology of institutions; The Magdalen Society of Philadelphia, 1800-1850. In ''Historical Archaeology'' Vol. 9 No. 23; Wilkie 2000. Magical passions: Sexuality and African-American archaeology. See Schmidt and Voss volume 129-142&lt;/ref&gt; and performance theory,&lt;ref&gt;Meskell and Joyce 2003. ''Embodied Lives: Figuring Ancient Maya and Egyptian Experience''&lt;/ref&gt; among others. Many archaeologists engaged in gender research avoid the label of “feminist,” largely due to the perceived negative connotations of the word.&lt;ref&gt;Conkey 2003. Has Feminism Changed Archaeology? In ''Signs'' Vol. 28 No. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Others within the discipline have an oversimplified understanding of feminist archaeology's history and aims, and as a consequence mistakenly conflate it with postmodernism.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Geller 2009. Identity and Difference: Complicating Gender in Archaeology. In ''Annual Review of Archaeology'' Vol. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Some archaeologists have argued against the continued incorporation of feminist thought, which is inherently political, into archaeological studies of gender.&lt;ref&gt;Sorenson 2000. ''Gender Archaeology''&lt;/ref&gt; Few works in gender archaeology have actively engaged in challenging patriarchal power structures beyond rectifying androcentric histories. Feminist archaeology engages in challenging and changing interpretive frameworks employed by archaeologists: “Feminism is a politics aimed at changing gender-based power relations.”&lt;ref&gt;Little 1994:10. People with history: An update on historical archaeology in the United States. ''Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory'' Vol. 1 No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Noted feminist philosopher [[Alison Wylie]] delineates several guidelines imperative for conducting feminist archaeology:&lt;ref&gt;2007. Doing Archaeology as a Feminist. ''Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory'' Vol. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

# To propose research questions that address people oppressed by systems of inequality structured by gender, in order to change such conditions.
# Feminist research should be grounded in the situated experience of women and other groups marginalized by conventional gender structures.
# Researchers should be held accountable to those affected by their research; under no means should feminist research exploit others.
# Feminist researchers should engage in self-reflexivity, recognizing their personal social positions, interests, and values, and discussing how these interact with their research.

In contrast, [[gender archaeology]] not employed by feminists lacks such characteristics. Gender is currently a common topic of study in archaeology among non-feminists. Such studies focus on identifying gendered activities and material culture and on the gender roles of past peoples, but do not present themselves in an overtly political way. Non-feminist archaeologists are less compelled to position themselves within their work, or reflect on how their position affects their work. Investigating gender independent of feminism, however, elides the aims of early studies and represents gender and sex in a conceptually deficient manner.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

== Ongoing feminist contributions to archaeology ==
Feminist archaeologists continue to challenge archaeological norms and expand research into new intellectual territories. They argue for the incorporation of alternative forms of knowledge and representation; for example, black and Indigenous epistemologies have been employed by feminist archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin 2001. A Black feminist-inspired archaeology? ''Journal of Social Archaeology'' Vol. 1 No. 1; Wilkie 2005. Inessential archaeologies: problems of exclusion in Americanist archaeological thought. ''World Archaeology'' Vol. 37 No. 3; Conkey 2005. Dwelling at the margins, action at the intersection? Feminist and indigenous archaeologies. ''Archaeologies'' Vol. 1 No. 1; Voss 2008. ''The archaeology of ethnogenesis: race and sexuality in colonial San Francisco''&lt;/ref&gt; There continues to be a feminist critique of the masculine character and organization of archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;Moser 2007. On Disciplinary Culture: Archaeology as Fieldwork and Its Gendered Associations. ''Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory'' Vol. 14 No. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alternative forms of knowledge and presentation ===
One important realm of research for feminist archaeologists, along with some non-feminists, is de-centering Westernized forms of history in favor of privileging alternative conceptions and interpretations of the past, and exploring non-traditional ways of conveying knowledge. A growing body of work involves involvement with descendant communities, giving them a voice in archaeological investigations and interpretations of the past. The public demand for allowing descendant communities a voice in the [[African Burial Ground National Monument|African Burial Ground]] controversy highlighted the importance of this kind of work. Parallels have been drawn between feminist archaeology and Indigenous archaeology, focusing on how both work to break down the male, white, middle-class, Western monopoly to accessing knowledge about the past.&lt;ref&gt;Conkey 2005&lt;/ref&gt; This type of work helps to de-center the privileged position of Western knowledge without removing its relevance.

Additionally, feminist archaeologists have engaged in the use of fiction to help access the past. This has taken the form of plays, as seen in ''Red-Light Voices'',&lt;ref&gt;Costello, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; based on letters and diaries by early 20th-century prostitutes to explore prostitution. Another example is seen in Laurie Wilkie’s fictional worker involved in the [[Federal Writers' Project]], interjected in her archaeological study of an African-American [[Midwifery|midwife]] in the post-emancipation South.&lt;ref&gt;2003 The archaeology of mothering: an African-American midwife's tale&lt;/ref&gt; [[Janet D. Spector]] interpreted the meaning behind a single artifact through a fictional narrative in ''What This Awl Means''.&lt;ref&gt;Spector 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Narrative has been argued as an effective means by which archaeologists can create multivocal and more broadly accessible interpretations and presentations.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce 2002. The Languages of Archaeology&lt;/ref&gt; The use of storytelling “demonstrate[s] 
how narrative is a powerful tool for bringing texture, nuance, and humanity to women’s experiences as evidenced through archaeology”&lt;ref&gt;Wilkie and Howlett Hayes 2006:252. Engendered and Feminist Archaeologies of the Recent and Documented Pasts. ''Journal of Archaeological Research'' Vol. 14&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Intersectional analysis ===
A common analytical technique employed by feminist (and some non-feminist) archaeologists is intersectional analysis, which, following the assertions of black feminists leading [[third-wave feminism]] in the U.S., maintains that gender cannot be accessed by itself but must be studied in conjunction with other forms of identity.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In [[historical archaeology]] the linkage between gender, race, and class has been increasingly explored, but other aspects of identity, notably sexuality, have been examined as well in relation to gender.&lt;ref&gt;see Schmidt and Voss volume 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Intersectional analysis has not been limited to feminist archaeology, as illustrated by the prevalent use of gender-race-class as a means of exploring identity by historical archaeologists. Although many such studies have focused on white, middle-class women of the recent Anglo-American past,&lt;ref&gt;Wilkie and Hayes 2006&lt;/ref&gt; the articulation of gender with other aspects of identity is starting to be applied to Native American women&lt;ref&gt;Lightfoot 2005. Indians, missionaries, and merchants: the legacy of colonial encounters on the Californian Frontiers; Howlett 2004. Gendered Practices: Ethnohistoric and Archaeological Evidence of Native American Social Divisions of Labor. ''Bulletin of the Archaeological Society of Connecticut'' No. 66&lt;/ref&gt; and African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Galle and Young 2004. ''Engendering African American archaeology: a southern perspective''&lt;/ref&gt; The work of Kathleen Deagan&lt;ref&gt;1985. The archaeology of the Spanish contact period in the Caribbean. ''Journal of World Prehistory'' Vol. 2 No. 2; 1996. Colonial Transformation: Euro-American Cultural Genesis in the Early Spanish-American Colonies. ''Journal of Anthropological Research'' Vol. 52 No. 2&lt;/ref&gt; on Spanish colonial sites in the US and Caribbean has pioneered a movement of study of gender in the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonies]].&lt;ref&gt;Jamieson 2000. ''Domestic architecture and power: the historical archaeology of colonial Ecuador''; Rothschild 2003. ''Colonial encounters in a Native American landscape: the Spanish and Dutch in North America''; see Voss 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The use of black feminist work, which calls to attention the inherent connectivity between gender and class in the U.S. has been an important step in advancing the use of intersectional analysis in archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;see Franklin 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The intersectional approach faced a lot of  “oppositional consciousness” that intervened in the flow of hegemonic feminist theory” and challenges in crossing the boundaries and negotiating with the terms of belonging in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Sandoval Feminist Theory Reader&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Household Studies ===
Archaeological studies of domestic sites have been particularly affected by ongoing feminist work. The long-standing trend in archaeology to associate women with domestic spaces, placed in opposition to the association with men and “public” spaces, has been a continuous locus of feminist research. Since the advent of the new millennium, there has been a shift away from such dichotomized spatial separation of gender. In historical archaeology, feminist archaeologists have been crucial to widening the definition of what constitutes a household from a familial model based on Western norms, such as household archaeology projects studying brothels&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Seifert et al 2000. Mary Ann Hall's First-Class House: the Archaeology of a Capital Brothel. See Schmidt and Voss volume&lt;/ref&gt; and fraternities.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkie 2010. ''The lost boys of Zeta Psi: a historical archaeology of masculinity in a university fraternity''&lt;/ref&gt; By engaging with broader household literature, 
archaeologists have begun to re-conceive household, long considered autonomous analytical units, as political spaces, occupied by social actors occupying different social positions shaped by gender, race, age, occupation, socioeconomic status, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Hendon 2006. Living and Working at Home:The Social Archaeology of Household Production and Social Relations. ''A Companion to Social Archaeology'' ed. by Lynn Meskell and Robert W. Preucel 255-271&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Georgian scripts''' are the three [[writing system]]s used to write the [[Georgian language]]: '''[[#Asomtavruli|Asomtavruli]]''', '''[[#Nuskhuri|Nuskhuri]]''' and '''[[#Mkhedruli|Mkhedruli]]'''. Although the systems differ in appearance, all three are [[unicase]], their [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]]s share the same names and alphabetical order, and are written horizontally from [[Writing system#Directionality|left to right]]. Of the three scripts, Mkhedruli, once the civilian royal script of the [[Kingdom of Georgia]] and mostly used for the [[royal charter]]s, is now the standard script for modern Georgian and its related [[Kartvelian languages]], whereas Asomtavruli and Nuskhuri are used only by the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]], in ceremonial religious texts and [[Iconography#Christian iconography|iconography]].&lt;ref name="addit"/&gt;

Georgian scripts are unique in their appearance and their exact origin has never been established; however, in strictly structural terms, their [[alphabetical order]] largely corresponds to the [[Greek alphabet]], with the exception of letters denoting uniquely Georgian sounds, which are grouped at the end.{{sfn|Shanidze|2000|p=444}}&lt;ref name=Lig1 /&gt; Originally consisting of 38 [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]],{{sfn|Machavariani|2011| p= 329}} Georgian is presently written in a 33-letter alphabet, as five letters are currently obsolete in that language. The number of Georgian letters used in other Kartvelian languages varies. [[Mingrelian language |Mingrelian]] uses 36: 33 that are current Georgian letters, one obsolete Georgian letter, and two additional letters specific to Mingrelian and [[Svan language|Svan]]. [[Laz language|Laz]] uses the same 33 current Georgian letters as Mingrelian plus that same obsolete letter and a letter borrowed from [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] for a total of 35. The fourth Kartvelian language, Svan, is not commonly written, but [[Svan alphabet|when it is]], it uses Georgian letters as utilized in Mingrelian, with an additional obsolete Georgian letter and sometimes supplemented by [[diacritic]]s for its many vowels.&lt;ref name="addit"/&gt;{{sfn|Hüning|Vogl|Moliner|2012|p=299}}

Georgian scripts were granted the national status of [[Intangible Cultural Heritage of Georgia|intangible cultural heritage]] in Georgia in 2015&lt;ref name="agenda.ge" /&gt; and inscribed on the [[UNESCO]] [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]] in 2016.&lt;ref name="unesco.org" /&gt;

The origin of the Georgian script is poorly known, and no full agreement exists among Georgian and foreign scholars as to its date of creation, who designed the script, and the main influences on that process.

The first version of the script attested is ''Asomtavruli'' which dates back at least to the 5th century; the other scripts were formed in the following centuries. Most scholars link the creation of the Georgian script to the process of [[Christianization of Iberia]] (not to be confused with the [[Iberian Peninsula]]), a core Georgian kingdom of [[Kartli]].{{sfn|Hewitt|1995|p=4}} The alphabet was therefore most probably created between the conversion of Iberia under King [[Mirian III of Iberia|Mirian III]] (326 or 337) and the [[Bir el Qutt inscriptions]] of 430,{{sfn|Hewitt|1995|p=4}} contemporaneously with the [[Armenian alphabet]].{{sfn|West|2010|p=230|ps=: Archaeological work in the last decade has confirmed that a Georgian alphabet did exist very early in Georgia's history, with the first examples being dated from the '''fifth century''' C.E.}} It was first used for translation of the Bible and other Christian literature into [[Old Georgian language|Georgian]], by monks in Georgia and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].&lt;ref name=Lig1 /&gt; Professor [[Levan Chilashvili]]'s dating of fragmented ''Asomtavruli'' inscriptions, discovered by him at the ruined town of [[Nekresi]], in Georgia's easternmost province of [[Kakheti]], in the 1980s, to the 1st or 2nd century has not been accepted.{{sfn|Rapp|2003|p=19|ps=: footnote 43: "The date of the supposed grave marker is hopelessly circumstantial ... I cannot support Chilashvili's dubious hypothesis."}}

A Georgian tradition first attested in the medieval chronicle ''Lives of the Kings of Kartli'' (ca. 800),&lt;ref name=Lig1 /&gt; assigns a much earlier, pre-Christian origin to the Georgian alphabet, and names King [[Pharnavaz I of Iberia|Pharnavaz I]] (3rd century BC) as its inventor. This account is now considered legendary, and is rejected by scholarly consensus, as no archaeological confirmation has been found.&lt;ref name=Lig1 /&gt;{{sfn|Rayfield|2013|p=}}{{sfn|Rapp|2010|p=139}} Rapp considers the tradition to be an attempt by the Georgian Church to rebut the earlier tradition that the alphabet was invented by the Armenian scholar [[Mesrop Mashtots]], and is a Georgian application of an Iranian model in which primordial kings are credited with the creation of basic social institutions. {{sfn|Rapp|2006|p=38}} Georgian linguist [[Tamaz Gamkrelidze]] offers an alternate interpretation of the tradition, in the pre-Christian use of foreign scripts (alloglottography in the [[Aramaic alphabet]]) to write down Georgian texts.{{sfn| Kemertelidze|1999|pp=228-}}

Another point of contention among scholars is the role played by [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian clerics]] in that process. According to a number of scholars and medieval Armenian sources, [[Mesrop Mashtots]], generally acknowledged as the creator of the [[Armenian alphabet]], also created the Georgian and [[Caucasian Albanian alphabet]]s. This tradition originates in the works of [[Koryun]], a fifth-century historian and biographer of Mashtots,&lt;ref name="Mashtots" /&gt; and has been quoted by [[Donald Rayfield]] and [[James R. Russell]],{{sfn|Rayfield|2013|p=19|ps=: "The Georgian alphabet seems unlikely to have a pre-Christian origin, for the major archaeological monument of the 1st century 4IX the bilingual Armazi gravestone commemorating Serafua, daughter of the Georgian viceroy of Mtskheta, is inscribed in Greek and Aramaic only. It has been believed, and not only in Armenia, that all the Caucasian alphabets — Armenian, Georgian and Caucaso-Albanian — were invented in the 4th century by the Armenian scholar Mesrop Mashtots.&lt;...&gt; The Georgian chronicles The Life of Kartli – assert that a Georgian script was invented two centuries before Christ, an assertion unsupported by archaeology. There is a possibility that the Georgians, like many minor nations of the area, wrote in a foreign language — Persian, Aramaic, or Greek — and translated back as they read."}}{{sfn|Bowersock|Brown|Grabar|1999|p=289|ps=: Alphabets. "Mastoc' was a charismatic visionary who accomplished his task at a time when Armenia stood in danger of losing both its national identity, through partition, and its newly acquired Christian faith, through Sassanian pressure and reversion to paganism. By preaching in Armenian, he was able to undermine and co-opt the discourse founded in native tradition, and to create a counterweight against both Byzantine and Syriac cultural hegemony in the church. Mastoc' also created the Georgian and Caucasian-Albanian alphabets, based on the Armenian model."}} but has been criticized by scholars, both Georgian&lt;ref name="Javakhishvili" /&gt; and Western,&lt;ref name=Lig1 /&gt; who judge the passage in Koryun unreliable or even a later interpolation. Other scholars quote Koryun's claims without taking a stance on its validity.{{sfn|Thomson|1996|pp=xxii-xxiii}}{{sfn|Rapp|2003|p=450|ps=: "There is also the claim advanced by Koriwn in his saintly biography of Mashtoc' (Mesrop) that the Georgian script had been invented at the direction of Mashtoc'. Yet it is within the realm of possibility that this tradition, repeated by many later Armenian historians, may not have been part of the original fifth-century text at all but added after 607. Significantly, all of the extant MSS containing The Life of Mashtoc* were copied centuries after the split. Consequently, scribal manipulation reflecting post-schism (especially anti-Georgian) attitudes potentially contaminates all MSS copied after that time. It is therefore conceivable, though not yet proven, that valuable information about Georgia transmitted by pre-schism Armenian texts was excised by later, post-schism individuals."}} Many agree, however, that Armenian clerics, if not Mashtots himself, must have played a role in the creation of the Georgian script.&lt;ref name=Lig1/&gt;{{sfn|Rapp|2010|p=139}}{{sfn|Greppin|1981|pp=449–456}}

Another controversy regards the main influences at play in the Georgian alphabet, as scholars have debated whether it was inspired more by the [[Greek alphabet]], or by Semitic alphabets such as [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]].{{sfn|Kemertelidze|1999|pp=228-}} Recent historiography focuses on greater similarities with the Greek alphabet than in the other Caucasian writing systems, most notably the order and numeric value of letters.{{sfn|Shanidze|2000|p=444}}&lt;ref name=Lig1 /&gt; Some scholars have also suggested certain pre-Christian Georgian cultural symbols or clan markers as a possible inspiration for particular letters.{{sfn|Haarmann|2012|p=299}}

== ''Asomtavruli'' ==
[[File:X საუკუნის ასომთავრული.jpg|thumb|Manuscript in Asomtavruli, 10th century.]]
'''Asomtavruli''' ({{lang-ka|ასომთავრული}}; {{IPA-ka|ɑsɔmtʰɑvruli}}) is the oldest Georgian script. The name ''Asomtavruli'' means "capital letters", from ''aso'' (ასო) "letter" and ''mtavari'' (მთავარი) "principal/head". It is also known as '''Mrgvlovani''' ({{lang-ka|მრგვლოვანი}}) "rounded", from ''mrgvali'' (მრგვალი) "round", so named because of its round letter shapes. Despite its name, this "capital" script is [[Unicase|unicameral]], just like the modern Georgian script, Mkhedruli.{{sfn|Daniels|1996|p=367}}

The oldest Asomtavruli inscriptions found so far date from the 5th century{{sfn|Machavariani|2011| p= 177}} and are [[Bir el Qutt inscriptions|Bir el Qutt]]&lt;ref&gt;ქსე, ტ. 7, თბ., 1984, გვ. 651–652&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Bolnisi inscriptions]].&lt;ref&gt;შანიძე ა., ქართული საბჭოთა ენციკლოპედია, ტ. 2, გვ. 454–455, თბ., 1977 წელი&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 9th century, Nuskhuri script starting becoming dominant, and the role of Asomtavruli was reduced. However, [[epigraphic]] monuments of the 10th to 18th centuries continued to be written in Asomtavruli script. Asomtavruli in this later period became more decorative. In the majority of 9th-century Georgian manuscripts which were written in Nuskhuri script, Asomtavruli was used for titles and the first letters of chapters.&lt;ref&gt;კ. დანელია, ზ. სარჯველაძე, ქართული პალეოგრაფია, თბილისი, 1997, გვ. 218–219&lt;/ref&gt; Although, some manuscripts written completely in Asomtavruli can be found until the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;ე. მაჭავარიანი, მწიგნობრობაჲ ქართული, თბილისი, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

===Form of Asomtavruli letters===
In early Asomtavruli, the letters are of equal height. Georgian historian and philologist [[Pavle Ingorokva]] believes that the direction of Asomtavruli, like that of Greek, was initially [[boustrophedon]], though the direction of the earliest surviving texts is from left to the right.&lt;ref&gt;პ. ინგოროყვა, „შოთა რუსთაველი“, „მნათობი“, 1966, № 3, გვ. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

In most Asomtavruli letters, straight lines are horizontal or vertical and meet at right angles.  The only letter with [[acute angle]]s is {{Script|Geok|Ⴟ}} ([[wikt:ჯ|ჯ]] ''jani''). There have been various attempts to explain this exception. Georgian linguist and art historian Helen Machavariani believes ''jani'' derives from a [[Chi Rho|monogram of Christ]], composed of the {{Script|Geok|Ⴈ}} ([[wikt:ი|ი]] ''ini'') and {{Script|Geok|Ⴕ}} ([[wikt:ქ|ქ]] ''kani'').{{sfn|Machavariani|2011| pp= 121-122}} According to Georgian scholar Ramaz Pataridze, the cross-like shape of letter ''jani'' indicates the end of the alphabet, and has the same function as the similarly shaped [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] letter [[taw]] ([[File:Phoenician taw.svg|20px]]), [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] [[Chi (letter)|chi]] (Χ), and [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] [[X]],&lt;ref&gt;რ. პატარიძე, ქართული ასომთავრული, თბილისი, 1980, გვ. 151, 260–261&lt;/ref&gt; though these letters do not have that function in Phoenician, Greek, or Latin.

&lt;center&gt;[[File:Coin of Queen Tamar 1200 AD.png|130px]] [[File:ლაშა-გიორგის მონეტა 1210 წ..png|130px]]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;Coins of Queen [[Tamar of Georgia]] and King [[George IV of Georgia]] minted using Asomtavruli script, 1200–1210 AD.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

From the 7th century, the forms of some letters began to change. The equal height of the letters was abandoned, with letters acquiring ascenders and descenders.&lt;ref&gt;ივ. ჯავახიშვილი, ქართული დამწერლობათა-მცოდნეობა ანუ პალეოგრაფია, თბილისი, 1949, 185–187&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ე. მაჭავარიანი, ქართული ანბანი, თბილისი, 1977, გვ. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asomtavruli illumination===
In Nuskhuri manuscripts, Asomtavruli are used for titles and [[illuminated capital]]s. The latter were used at the beginnings of paragraphs which started new sections of text. In the early stages of the development of Nuskhuri texts, Asomtavruli letters were not elaborate and were distinguished principally by size and sometimes by being written in [[cinnabar]] ink. Later, from the 10th century, the letters were illuminated. The style of Asomtavruli capitals can be used to identify the era of a text. For example, in the Georgian manuscripts of the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] era, when the styles of the [[Byzantine Empire]] influenced [[Kingdom of Georgia]], capitals were illuminated with images of birds and other animals.&lt;ref&gt;ელენე მაჭავარიანი, ენციკლოპედია „ქართული ენა“, თბილისი, 2008, გვ. 403–404&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;center&gt;[[File:Asomtavruli letter მ.png|110px]] [[File:Asomtavruli letter ნ (n).png|110px]] [[File:Asomtavruli letter თ (t).png|110px]]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;Decorative Asomtavruli capital letters, [[wikt:მ|მ]] (m), [[wikt:ნ|ნ]] (n) and [[wikt:თ|თ]] (t), 12–13th century.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

From the 11th-century "limb-flowery", "limb-arrowy" and "limb-spotty" decorative forms of Asomtavruli are developed.

The "Curly" decorative form of Asomtavruli is also used where the letters are wattled or intermingled on each other, or the smaller letters are written inside other letters.

== ''Nuskhuri'' ==
[[File:Mikael Modrekili manuscript.JPG|thumb|Nuskhuri of [[Mikael Modrekili]], 10th century.]]
'''Nuskhuri''' ({{lang-ka|ნუსხური}}; {{IPA-ka|nusxuri}}) is the second Georgian script. The name ''nuskhuri'' comes from ''nuskha'' (ნუსხა), meaning "inventory" or "schedule". Nuskhuri was soon augmented with Asomtavruli [[illuminated capital]]s in religious manuscripts. The combination is called '''Khutsuri''' ({{lang-ka|ხუცური}}, "clerical", from ''khutsesi'' ({{lang|ka|ხუცესი}} "[[clergy|cleric]]"), and it was principally used in [[hagiography]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;კ. დანელია, ზ. სარჯველაძე, ქართული პალეოგრაფია, თბილისი, 1997, გვ. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuskhuri first appeared in the 9th century as a graphic variant of Asomtavruli.{{sfn|Hewitt|1995|p=4}} The oldest inscription is found in the [[Ateni Sioni Church]] and dates to 835 AD.&lt;ref&gt;გ. აბრამიშვილი, ატენის სიონის უცნობი წარწერები, "მაცნე" (ისტ. და არქეოლოგ. სერია), 1976, №2, გვ. 170&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest surviving Nuskhuri manuscripts date to 864 AD.&lt;ref&gt;კ. დანელია, ზ. სარჯველაძე, ქართული პალეოგრაფია, თბილისი, 1997, გვ. 218&lt;/ref&gt; Nuskhuri becomes dominant over Asomtavruli from the 10th century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Form of Nuskhuri letters===
Nuskhuri letters vary in height, with ascenders and descenders, and are slanted to the right. Letters have an angular shape, with a noticeable tendency to simplify the shapes they had in Asomtavruli. This enabled faster writing of manuscripts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;ე. მაჭავარიანი, ქართული ანბანი, თბილისი, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

A ligature of these letters produced a new letter in Nuskhuri, [[wikt:უ|უ]] ''uni''.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

'''Mkhedruli''' ({{lang-ka|მხედრული}}; {{IPA-ka|mxɛdruli}}) is the third and current Georgian script. Mkhedruli, literally meaning "[[cavalry]]" or "[[military]]", derives from ''mkhedari'' (მხედარი) meaning "[[Equestrianism|horseman]]", "[[knight]]", "[[warrior]]"{{sfn|Nakanishi|1990|p=22}} and "[[cavalier]]".{{sfn|Allen|Gugushvili|1937|p=324}}

Mkhedruli is bicameral, with capital letters that are called Mkhedruli Mtavruli ({{lang|ka|მხედრული მთავრული}}) or simply Mtavruli ({{lang|ka|მთავრული}}; {{IPA-ka|mtʰɑvruli}}). Nowadays, Mtavruli is typically used in [[all-caps]] text in titles or to emphasize a word, though in the late 19th and early 20th centuries it was occasionally used, as in Latin and Cyrillic scripts, to capitalize proper nouns or the first word of a sentence.&lt;ref name="Unicode Mtavruli proposal" /&gt;

Mkhedruli first appears in the 10th century. The oldest Mkhedruli inscription is found in [[Ateni Sioni Church]] dating back to 982 AD. The second oldest Mkhedruli-written text is found in the 11th-century royal charters of King [[Bagrat IV of Georgia]]. Mkhedruli was mostly used then in the [[Kingdom of Georgia]] for the [[royal charter]]s, historical documents, manuscripts and inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;ატენის სიონის უცნობი წარწერები, აბრამიშვილი, გვ. 170-1&lt;/ref&gt; Mkhedruli was used for non-religious purposes only and represented the "civil", "royal" and "secular" script.{{sfn|Katzner|Miller|2002|p=118}}{{sfn|Chambers Encyclopedia|1901|p=165}}

Mkhedruli became more and more dominant over the two other scripts, though Khutsuri (Nuskhuri with Asomtavruli) was used until the 19th century. Mkhedruli became the universal writing Georgian system outside of the Church in the 19th century with the establishment and development of printed Georgian fonts.&lt;ref name="Putkaradze2006" /&gt;

===Form of Mkhedruli letters===
Mkhedruli inscriptions of the 10th and 11th centuries are characterized in rounding of angular shapes of Nuskhuri letters and making the complete outlines in all of its letters. Mkhedruli letters are written in the four-linear system, similar to Nuskhuri.
Mkhedruli becomes more round and free in writing. It breaks the strict frame of the previous two alphabets, Asomtavruli and Nuskhuri. Mkhedruli letters begin to get coupled and more free calligraphy develops.&lt;ref&gt;მაჭავარიანი, თბილისი, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Letters removed from the Georgian alphabet ===

*&lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;ჱ&lt;/span&gt; (''he''), sometimes called "''ei''"{{sfn|Shanidze|1973|p=18}} or "''e-merve''" ("eighth ''e''"),&lt;ref name="obsol"&gt;Otar Jishkariani, Praise of the Alphabet, 1986, Tbilisi, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; was equivalent to ეჲ ''ey'', as in ქრისტჱ ~ ქრისტეჲ ''krist'ey'' 'Christ'.
*&lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;ჲ&lt;/span&gt; (''hie''), also called ''iota'',&lt;ref name="obsol"/&gt; appeared instead of ი (''ini'') after a vowel, but came to have the same pronunciation as ი (''ini'') and was replaced by it.  Thus ქრისტჱ ~ ქრისტეჲ ''krist'ey'' "Christ" is now written ქრისტე ''krist'e''.
*&lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;ჳ&lt;/span&gt; (''vie'')&lt;ref name="obsol"/&gt; came to be pronounced the same as ვი ''vi'' and was replaced by that sequence, as in სხჳსი &gt; სხვისი ''skhvisi'' "others'".
*&lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;ჴ&lt;/span&gt; (''qari'', ''hari'')&lt;ref name="obsol"/&gt; came to be pronounced the same as ხ (''khani''), and was replaced by it. e.g. ჴლმწიფე became ხელმწიფე "sovereign".
*&lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;ჵ&lt;/span&gt; (''hoe'')&lt;ref name="obsol"/&gt; was used for the [[interjection]] ''hoi!'' and is now spelled ჰოი.

All but ჵ (''hoe'') continue to be used in the [[Svan alphabet]]; ჲ (''hie'') is used in the [[Mingrelian alphabet|Mingrelian]] and [[Laz alphabet|Laz]] alphabets as well, for the y-sound {{IPAslink|j}}. Several others were used for [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]] and [[Ossetian language|Ossetian]] in the short time they were written in Mkhedruli script.

=== Letters added to other alphabets ===
Mkhedruli has been adapted to languages besides Georgian.  Some of these alphabets retained letters obsolete in Georgian, while others required additional letters:

[[File:Mkhedruli.svg|750px|center]]

&lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;ზ&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;ო&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;ხ&lt;/span&gt; (''zeni, oni, khani'') are almost always written without the small tick at the end, while the handwritten form of &lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;ჯ&lt;/span&gt; (''jani'') often uses a vertical line, [[File:ჯ (other form).png|14px]] (sometimes with a taller ascender, or with a diagonal cross bar); even when it is written at a diagonal, the cross-bar is generally shorter than in print.

*Only four letters are [[x-height]], with neither ascenders nor descenders:  ა, თ, ი, ო. 
*Thirteen have [[ascender (typography)|ascender]]s, like b or d in English: ბ, ზ, მ, ნ, პ, რ, ს, შ, ჩ, ძ, წ, ხ, ჰ
*An equal number have [[descender (typography)|descender]]s, like p or q in English: გ, დ, ე, ვ, კ, ლ, ჟ, ტ, უ, ფ, ღ, ყ, ც
*Three letters have both ascenders and descenders, like [[thorn (letter)|þ]] in [[Old English]]:  ქ, ჭ, and (in handwriting) ჯ. წ has both ascender and descender in print, and sometimes in handwriting.

====Variation====
[[File:Shota Rustaveli Ave. 50.jpg|thumb|Stylistic variation of letters რ and ლ on a [[street name sign]] for [[Rustaveli Avenue]], showing variations in the name [[Shota Rustaveli|Rustaveli]], with &lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;რ&lt;/span&gt;უსთავე&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;ლ&lt;/span&gt;ის resembling &lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;ɦ&lt;/span&gt;უსთავე&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;ჺ&lt;/span&gt;ის.]]
[[File:Police car in Tbilisi (78).jpg|thumb|''Mtavruli'' (all-caps) text on a Georgian [[police car]].]]

There is individual and stylistic variation in many of the letters.  For example, the top circle of &lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;ზ&lt;/span&gt; (''zeni'') and the top stroke of &lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;რ&lt;/span&gt; (''rae'') may go in the other direction than shown in the chart (that is, counter-clockwise starting at 3 o'clock, and upwards – see the external-link section for videos of people writing).

Other common variants:

* &lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;გ&lt;/span&gt; (''gani'') may be written like &lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;ვ&lt;/span&gt; (''vini'') with a closed loop at the bottom.
* &lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;დ&lt;/span&gt; (''doni'') is frequently written with a simple loop at top, [[File:Doni (other form).svg|15px]].
* &lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;კ&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;ც&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;ძ&lt;/span&gt; (''k'ani, tsani, dzili'') are generally written with straight, vertical lines at the top, so that for example &lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;ც&lt;/span&gt; (''tsani'') resembles a U with a dimple in the right side.
* &lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;ლ&lt;/span&gt; (''lasi'') is frequently written with a single arc, [[File:Lasi (other form).svg|15px]].  Even when all three are written, they're generally not all the same size, as they are in print, but rather riding on one wide arc like two dimples in it.
* Rarely, &lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;ო&lt;/span&gt; (''oni'') is written as a [[right angle]], [[File:Oni (other form).svg|10px]].
* &lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;რ&lt;/span&gt; (''rae'') is frequently written with one arc, [[File:Rae (other form).svg|10px]], like a Latin {{angbr|h}}.
* &lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;ტ&lt;/span&gt; (''t'ari'') often has a small circle with a tail hanging into the bowl, rather than two small circles as in print, or as an O with a straight vertical line intersecting the top.  It may also be rotated a bit clockwise, with the small circles further to the right and not as close to the top.
* &lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;წ&lt;/span&gt; (''ts'ili'') is generally written with a round bowl at the bottom, [[File:Ts'ili (other form).svg|12px]]. Another variation features a triangular bowl.
* &lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;ჭ&lt;/span&gt; (''ch'ari'') may be written without the hook at the top, and often with a completely straight vertical line.
* &lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;ჱ&lt;/span&gt; (''he'') may be written without the loop, like a conflation of ს and ჰ.
* &lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;ჯ&lt;/span&gt; (''jani'') is sometimes written so that it looks like a hooked version of the Latin "X"

====Similar letters====

Several letters are similar and may be confused at first, especially in handwriting. 
*For &lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;ვ&lt;/span&gt; (''vini'') and &lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;კ&lt;/span&gt; (''k'ani''), the critical difference is whether the top is a full arc or a (more-or-less) vertical line.  
*For &lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;ვ&lt;/span&gt; (''vini'') and &lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;გ&lt;/span&gt; (''gani''), it is whether the bottom is an open curve or closed (a loop).  The same is true of &lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;უ&lt;/span&gt; (''uni'') and &lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;შ&lt;/span&gt; (''shini''); in handwriting, the tops may look the same.  Similarly &lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;ს&lt;/span&gt; (''sani'') and &lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;ხ&lt;/span&gt; (''khani'').
*For &lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;კ&lt;/span&gt; (''k'ani'') and &lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;პ&lt;/span&gt; (''p'ari''), the crucial difference is whether the letter is written below or above x-height, and whether it's written top-down or bottom-up. 
*&lt;span style="font-size:170%;"&gt;ძ&lt;/span&gt; (''dzili'') is written with a vertical top.

== Ligatures, abbreviations and calligraphy ==
{{Calligraphy}}
Asomtavruli is often highly stylized and writers readily formed [[Typographic ligature|ligatures]], intertwined letters, and placed letters within letters or other such [[monograms]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pavle Ingorokva|Ingorokva, Pavle]] [http://www.amsi.ge/istoria/pi/damcerlobis_Zegli.pdf ქართული დამწერლობის ძეგლები ანტიკური ხანისა (The monuments of ancient Georgian script)]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;small&gt;A ligature of the Asomtavruli initials of King [[Vakhtang I of Iberia]], Ⴂ Ⴌ (გნ, GN)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;small&gt;A ligature of the Asomtavruli letters Ⴃ Ⴀ (და, da) "and"&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Nuskhuri, like Asomtavruli, is also often highly stylized. Writers readily formed [[Typographic ligature|ligature]]s and abbreviations for ''[[nomina sacra]]'', including diacritics called ''karagma'', which resemble ''[[titlo|titla]]''. Because writing materials such as [[vellum]] were scarce and therefore precious, abbreviating was a practical measure widespread in [[manuscript]]s and [[hagiography]] by the 11th century.{{sfn|Shanidze |2003|p=}}

&lt;small&gt;A Nuskhuri abbreviation of იესუ ქრისტე (iesu kriste) "Jesus Christ"&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Mkhedruli, in the 11th to 17th centuries also came to employ digraphs to the point that they were obligatory, requiring adherence to a complex system.&lt;ref&gt;შანიძე, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;center&gt;[[File:Ani Mkhedruli.svg|40px]]&lt;br/&gt;

== Type faces ==
Georgian scripts come in only a single [[type face]], though word processors can apply automatic ("fake")&lt;ref name="Simonson2005" /&gt; [[oblique type|oblique]] and [[bold type|bold]] formatting to Georgian text.  Traditionally, Asomtavruli was used for chapter or section titles, where Latin script might use bold or italic type.

== Punctuation ==
In Asomtavruli and Nuskhuri punctuation, various combinations of dots were used as [[word divider]]s and to separate phrases, clauses, and paragraphs. In monumental inscriptions and manuscripts of 5th to 10th centuries, these were written as dashes, like −, = and =−. In the 10th century, clusters of one (·), two (:), three ([[wikt:჻|჻]]) and six (჻჻) dots (later sometimes small circles) were introduced by [[Ephrem Mtsire]] to indicate increasing breaks in the text. One dot indicated a "minor stop" (presumably a simple word break), two dots marked or separated "special words", three dots for a "bigger stop" (such as the [[appositive]] name and title "the sovereign Alexander", below, or [[#Gospel of Matthew|the title of the Gospel of Matthew]], above), and six dots were to indicate the end of the sentence. Starting in the 11th century, marks resembling the apostrophe and comma came into use. An apostrophe was used to mark an interrogative word, and a comma appeared at the end of an interrogative sentence. From the 12th century on, these were replaced with the semicolon (the [[Greek question mark]]). In the 18th century, Patriarch [[Anton I of Georgia]] reformed the system again, with commas, single dots, and double dots used to mark "complete", "incomplete", and "final" sentences, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[[Georgian Soviet Encyclopedia]], V. 8, p. 231, Tbilisi, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; For the most part, Georgian today uses the punctuation as in international usage of the [[Latin script]].{{sfn|Gillam|2003|p=252}}

=== Unicode ===

The first Georgian script was included in [[Unicode]] Standard in October, 1991 with the release of version 1.0. In creating the Georgian Unicode block, important roles were played by German [[Jost Gippert]], a linguist of [[Kartvelian studies]], and American-Irish linguist and script-encoder [[Michael Everson]], who created the Georgian Unicode for the [[Macintosh]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bpgfonts.wordpress.com/2009/01/31/%E1%83%A3%E1%83%9C%E1%83%98%E1%83%99%E1%83%9D%E1%83%93%E1%83%A8%E1%83%98-%E1%83%A5%E1%83%90%E1%83%A0%E1%83%97%E1%83%A3%E1%83%9A%E1%83%98%E1%83%A1-%E1%83%90%E1%83%A1%E1%83%90%E1%83%AE%E1%83%95%E1%83%98/ უნიკოდში ქართულის ასახვის ისტორია (History of the Georgian Unicode)] Georgian Unicode fonts by BPG-InfoTech&lt;/ref&gt; Significant contributions were also made by Anton Dumbadze and Irakli Garibashvili&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unicode.org/charts/fonts.html Font Contributors Acknowledgements] Unicode&lt;/ref&gt; (not to be mistaken with the former [[Prime Minister of Georgia]] [[Irakli Garibashvili]]).

Mtavruli letters were added in Unicode version 11.0 in June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Unicode 11.0.0 | url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode11.0.0/ | publisher=[[Unicode Consortium]] | date=June 5, 2018 | accessdate=June 5, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are capital letters with similar letterforms to Mkhedruli, but with [[descender]]s shifted above the [[baseline (typography)|baseline]], with a wider central oval, and with the top slightly higher than the [[ascender (typography)|ascender]] height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bpgfonts.wordpress.com/2016/02/24/mtavruli-for-perfection/ |title=Mtavruli for Perfect Bicameral Fonts|website=BPG Georgian Fonts |date=February 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/Unicode-11.0/U110-1C90.pdf |title=The Unicode Standard, Version 11.0 - U110-1C90.pdf |publisher=Unicode.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2017/17199-n4827-mtavruli.pdf |first1=Michael |last1=Everson |first2=Nika |last2=Gujejiani |first3=Giorgi |last3=Vakhtangishvili |first4=Akaki |last4=Razmadze |title=Action plan for the complete representation of Mtavruli characters |date=2017-06-24 |website=Unicode® Technical Committee Document Registry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this addition, font creators included Mtavruli in various ways. Some fonts came in pairs, of which one had lowercase letters and the other uppercase; some Unicode fonts placed Mtavruli letterforms in the Asomtavruli range (U+10A0-U+10CF) or in the [[Private Use Area]], and some ASCII-based ones mapped them to the ASCII capital letters.&lt;ref name="Unicode Mtavruli proposal"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2016/16034-n4707-georgian.pdf |title=Proposal for the addition of Georgian characters to the UCS |last1=Everson |first1=Michael |last2=Gujejiani |first2=Nika |last3=Razmadze |first3=Akaki |date=January 24, 2016 |website=Unicode® Technical Committee Document Registry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Blocks ====
{{Main article | Georgian (Unicode block) | Georgian Supplement | Georgian Extended | l2 = Georgian Supplement (Unicode block) | l3= Georgian Extended (Unicode block) }}

Georgian characters are found in three Unicode blocks. The first block (U+10A0–U+10FF) is simply called Georgian. Mkhedruli (modern Georgian) occupies the U+10D0–U+10FF range (shown in the bottom half of the first table below) and Asomtavruli occupies the U+10A0–U+10CF range (shown in the top half of the same table). The second block is the Georgian Supplement (U+2D00–U+2D2F), and it contains Nuskhuri.&lt;ref name="addit"/&gt; Mtavruli capitals are included in the Georgian Extended block (U+1C90–U+1CBF).

Mtavruli is defined as the upper case, but not [[title case]], of Mkhedruli, and Asomtavruli as the upper case and title case of Nuskhuri.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=The Unicode® Standard Version 11.0 – Core Specification |chapter=7: Europe-I: Modern and Liturgical Scripts | chapter-url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode11.0.0/ch07.pdf | publisher=Unicode Consortium | date=June 5, 2018 | accessdate=8 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Horom Citadel''' ({{lang-hy|Հոռոմ Բերդ}}, also [[Romanize]]d as '''Orom''' and '''Horrom''') is an ancient [[Bronze Age]] through [[Urartu|Urartian]] fortification atop two large hills south of the main road and opposite of the dam and Kamut Reservoir.  It is about {{convert|1|km|mi|1}} east of the village of [[Horrom]] in the [[Shirak Province]] of northwestern [[Armenia]].  Not far from this location in Ghak and Shvaghtapa are two Urartian [[cyclopean masonry|cyclopean]] forts.
  
Horom is considered to be one of the most impressive archaeological sites in Armenia because of its unique architecture.  There are [[potsherd]]s and [[obsidian]] flakes strewn on the surface of the ground.  Recent excavations have been underway at the site recently by Armenian and American archaeologists led by Ruben Badalian and Philip Kohl.  The teams have uncovered well preserved fortification walls as well as large amounts of cultural artifacts that have given insight into those who once resided at the site.

Board of Education, 05311955.gif|thumb|right|220px|The first page of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] judgement in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', the "mother of all impact litigation".{{sfn | Schuck | 2006 | p=104}}]]
'''Impact litigation''' or '''strategic litigation''' is the practice of bringing [[lawsuit]]s intended to effect societal change.{{sfn | Schuck | 2006 | p=103}}{{sfn | Okafor | 2006 | p=81}} Impact litigation cases may be [[class action]] lawsuits or individual claims with broader significance,{{sfn | Schuck | 2006 | p=104}} and may rely on [[statutory law]] arguments or on [[constitution]]al claims.{{sfn | Tushnet | 2008 | p=383}} Such litigation has been widely and successfully used to influence public policy, especially by [[Left-wing politics|left-leaning]] groups, and often attracts significant media attention.{{sfn | Schuck | 2006 | p=103}}

==History==
In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (at times though its [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund|Legal Defense Fund]]) both pursued legal action to advance and protect civil rights in the [[United States of America|United States]]. The ACLU followed a primarily "defensive" strategy, fighting individual violations of rights when they were identified. The NAACP, in contrast, developed a more coordinated plan to actively file suits to challenge discrimination, known as "affirmative" or "strategic" litigation.{{sfn |Tushnet |2008 |p=380}} The NAACP's model became the pattern for "impact litigation" strategies, which applied similar tactics in contexts other than racial discrimination.{{sfn|Tushnet |2008 |p=383}}

Important early impact litigation cases included ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' and ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''.{{sfn | Schuck | 2006 | p=104}} ''Brown'', a 1954 U.S. [[school desegregation]] decision, was carefully prepared by [[Thurgood Marshall]] and other NAACP lawyers so that the eventual [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling invalidated official racial discrimination throughout the U.S. government. Many cases since then have closely imitated it, in the course of seeking greater protections for other disadvantaged groups.{{sfn | Schuck | 2006 | p=104}}

==Scope==
Impact litigation has played a major role in the development of American desegregation, [[abortion]],  [[Regulation of tobacco by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration |tobacco regulation]] policy{{sfn | Mason | Leavitt | Chaffee | 2013 | p=547}} and [[gay marriage]].  

Since the 1980s, impact litigation has been used to seek reform in the reform of U.S. [[Child protection|child welfare law]], following earlier work which involved the courts in jail and mental hospital reforms and in school desegregation.{{sfn| Lowry |1986 |p=260}}

Strategic impact litigation has also been used in [[Nigeria]], among other things to push for convictions of perpetrators of [[police brutality]] and to defeat legal attacks on the [[freedom of the press]].{{sfn | Okafor | 2006 | p=81}}

In a few jurisdictions where attorneys are prohibited from bringing class action lawsuits, citizens have filed "grassroots impact litigation" cases and successfully represented their own claims.{{sfn |Freeman |1991 }}

==Debate==
Impact litigation has been criticized by legal scholars and politicians on the bases of judicial legitimacy and competence.

The legitimacy argument holds that, in countries with a constitutional [[separation of powers]], societal changes are to be enacted by democratically elected bodies and are outside the purview of individual judges. The competence argument claims that institutional limitations on the amount and quality of information that can be made available in a court proceeding make the courts poorly prepared to handle complex policy issues. Another version of this argument points out that courts are limited in the scope of their responses, relative to legislative bodies.{{sfn | Schuck | 2006 | pp=107-111}} These debates overlap with those concerning so-called "[[judicial activism]]".{{sfn| Lowry |1986 |p=260}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2589">'''Institutional ethnography''' ('''IE''') is a method of social research. IE explores the social relations that structure people's everyday lives, specifically by looking at the ways that people interact with one another in the context of social institutions (school, marriage, work, for example) and understanding how those interactions are institutionalized. IE is best understood as an ethnography of interactions which have been institutionalized, rather than an ethnography of specific companies, organizations or employment sectors, which would be considered [[industrial sociology]] or the sociology of work. For the institutional ethnographer, ordinary daily activity becomes the site for an investigation of social organization. 
IE was first developed by [[Dorothy E. Smith]] as a [[Marxist]] [[feminist]] [[sociology]] "for women, for people"; and is now used by researchers in social sciences, education, human services and policy research as a method for mapping the translocal relations that coordinate people's activities within institutions.

'''Juan Poblete''' is Professor of Latin American Literature and Cultural Studies at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]].&lt;ref&gt;Castro-Klarén, Sara. A Companion to Latin American Literature and Culture. Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;   Poblete began his career as a UCSC Assistant Professor in 1997. He is also the [[Provost (education)|provost]] of [[Kresge College]] at UCSC and a Governing Board Member of the Latino Literary Cultures Project/Proyecto Culturas Literarias Latinas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://culturas.ucsc.edu/about], UC Santa Cruz. The Latino Literary Cultures Project.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Poblete earned his [[Bachelor of Arts]] from the [[University of Chile]] and his Ph.D. from [[Duke University]] where he studied literary markets in [[Chile]], the role subaltern readers play in influencing these markets, and the influence of cultural values on curricular choices in schools. One of Poblete’s professors at [[Duke University]] was Argentine born [[Walter Mignolo]] who contributed to Poblete's ''Critical Latin American and Latino Studies''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.ucsc.edu/oncampus/currents/97-10-20/newfac.htm], University of California, Santa Cruz. Currents. New Faculty. October 20, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Poblete’s current research focuses on the 19th century [[Latin America]] and contemporary [[Latino]] culture. His research on the 19th century culture focuses on [[literature]] as a disciplinary discourse for the formation of national subjects, as a set of social practices, and as a product in the cultural market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://humanities.ucsc.edu/about/singleton.php?&amp;singleton=true&amp;cruz_id=jpoblete], Humanitites. University Of California Santa Cruz. "Juan Poblete."&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition, Poblete has written and researched various aspects of Latin American and Latino culture and experiences, with consideration to modern phenomenons including [[globalization]] and [[transnationalism]]. His studies on US Latinos and contemporary Chilean culture  “participate in an effort to rethink Latin/o American Studies in a global framework. That is to say, capable of encompassing [[Latin America]] and the [[United States]] from interdisciplinary angles, which can do justice to the new complex cultural, social and political developments of a globalized Latin/o America.” Poblete’s work has also often analyzed literary works (including comics, film, and literature) and their political or social role in the U.S./Latin America.

==Family==
Juan Poblete is the son of Clara Garrido and Juan Poblete. He has four siblings: Haifa, Clara,  Fernando,  and Juan Claudio Poblete.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ESSpzhvODy8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=juan+poblete&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3c_HT_O3FOew2wWiz9ynCw&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=juan%20poblete&amp;f=false], Literatura chilena del siglo XIX, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions to the field==

===Affect in a Post-Social Space===
Poblete refers to the productivity of affect in a post-social space to describe a space dominated by fear and insecurity between different bodies and experiences as a result of both virtual and real, social/political, and economic circumstances. When Poblete uses the concept “post-social space,” he refers to societies where social security, pensions, health care, education, and other social services or rights are fully or partially privatized, leading to an increase in insecurity and anxiety within society. In this post-social context, it becomes easier and seems necessary for members of society to receive privatized services through the work afforded by racialized immigrants who work for less than the [[minimum wage]]. Therefore, a post-social space leads to both confidence in and  interdependence between the migrant and non-migrant as well as fear, suspicion, and externalization of the “other.” Poblete explains how non-migrants need migrants for the services they offer in a post-social space, while migrants need non-migrants’s employment for their own economic survival. Despite this interdependence, mutual effects including fear, anxiety, and resentment within conditions of exploitation lead to insecurity. As a result of this externalization or “otherization,” the migrant and non-migrant are both ''affected'' by  a form of exclusion dominated by what becomes a subconscious form of fear and suspicion.&lt;ref&gt;Poblete, Juan “La Productividad del Afecto.” Moraña, Mabel. El Lenguaje De Las Emociones: Afecto Y Cultura En América Latina. Madrid: Iberoamericana, 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production of in/visibility===
In his focus on undocumented migrants, Poblete notes that more than a third of U.S. immigrants have been undocumented and a large percent has been Latino. Within this context, Poblete analyzes the dialectics of both visibility and invisibility affecting migrant populations in the United States. By in/visibility, Poblete refers to the ways migrants are invisibilized as political actors who have contributed to the economy of U.S., while they are visibilized as publics, audiences, and consumers. Their invisibilization as political actors therefore allows for their exploitation and vulnerability while their visibility as publics and consumers allows society to profit from them as a market, often representing them in a culturally homogeneous or stereotyped fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Poblete, Juan. “U.S. Latino Studies in a Global Context: Social Imagination and the Production of In/visibility.” ''Works and Days'' 47/48. Vol. 24. Nos. 1&amp;2. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latino Literary Cultures Project, UCSC==
Juan Poblete is a governing board member of the Latino Literary Cultures Project/Proyecto Culturas Literarias Latinas. This project was formed in 1992 and connects faculty and graduate students from the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], with local, regional, and global groups to promote transnational and interdisciplinary research focused on the Americas. The project also promotes creative writing by and about Latin@s, sponsoring a major biennial conference and smaller events involving students, scholars, writers, reviewers, and librarians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://culturas.ucsc.edu/about], UC Santa Cruz.

'''Kuntillet Ajrud''' ({{lang-ar|كونتيلة عجرود}}) is a late 9th/early 8th centuries BCE site in the northeast part of the [[Sinai Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0Kf1ZwDifdAC&amp;dq=Robert+Karl+Gnuse,+%22No+Other+Gods:+Emergent+Monotheism+in+Israel%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_f5DTMnIGMjQcZHo2bAP&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Gnuse, Robert Karl, "No other gods: emergent monotheism in Israel" (Sheffield Academic Press, 1997) pp.69-70]&lt;/ref&gt; It is frequently described as a shrine, though this is not certain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=F-nUGHehMPEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+cult+of+Asherah+in+ancient+Israel+and+Judah:+evidence+for+a+Hebrew+goddess&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6EXw2Fmzf8&amp;sig=yWGcsOOSwNyM62D6bdpul33DWEI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bjtETNPZF4TfcZDF4LIP&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Judith M. Hadley, "The cult of Asherah in ancient Israel and Judah: evidence for a Hebrew goddess", (University of Cambridge Press, 2000) pp.108ff.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excavations==
The site was excavated in 1975/76 by [[Tel Aviv University]] archaeologist [[Ze’ev Meshel]]. The fortress-like main building is divided into two rooms, one large and the other small, both with low benches. Both rooms contained various paintings and inscriptions on the walls and on two large water-jars (''[[Pithos|pithoi]]''), one found in each room. The paintings on the pithoi show various animals, stylised trees, and human figures, some of which may represent gods. They appear to have been done over a fairly considerable period and by several different artists, and do not form coherent scenes. The iconography is entirely Syrian/Phoenician and lacks any connection to the Egyptian models commonly found in Iron Age IIB Israel art.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NjYAWXO-jdAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Gods,+goddesses,+and+images+of+God+in+ancient+Israel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=js9Jn2MvVT&amp;sig=KLepiBQ_bBp_NB7juf2-4TGVfNY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yjtETK72JobZcf-21acP&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Keel, Othmar, and Uehlinger, Christoph, "Gods, goddesses, and images of God in ancient Israel" (Fortress Press, 1998) pp.210ff.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The inscriptions are mostly in early Hebrew with some in [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] script.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uuKfXsvfr2YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Archaeology+and+fertility+cult+in+the+ancient+Mediterranean&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4zpO-GQUDW&amp;sig=ouzVE1ASsmPhcVYZNZh0ZVqwbfk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=HTtETK3oOYTfcbvE1LIP&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Bonanno, Anthony, "Archaeology and fertility cult in the ancient Mediterranean", (University of Malta, 1986) pp.238ff.]&lt;/ref&gt; Many are religious in nature, invoking  [[Yahweh]], [[El (deity)|El]] and [[Baal]], and two include the phrases "Yahweh of [[Samaria]] and his [[Asherah]]" and "Yahweh of [[Teman (Edom)|Teman]] and his Asherah."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uuKfXsvfr2YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Archaeology+and+fertility+cult+in+the+ancient+Mediterranean&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4zpO-GQUDW&amp;sig=ouzVE1ASsmPhcVYZNZh0ZVqwbfk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=HTtETK3oOYTfcbvE1LIP&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Bonanno, Anthony, "Archaeology and fertility cult in the ancient Mediterranean", (University of Malta, 1986) pp.238ff.]&lt;/ref&gt; There is general agreement that Yahweh is being invoked in connection with Samaria (capital of the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|kingdom of Israel]]) and Teman (in [[Edom]]); this suggests that Yahweh had a temple in Samaria, and raises a question over the relationship between Yahweh and [[Qos (deity)|Kaus]], the national god of [[Edom]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NjYAWXO-jdAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Gods,+goddesses,+and+images+of+God+in+ancient+Israel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=js9Jn2MvVT&amp;sig=KLepiBQ_bBp_NB7juf2-4TGVfNY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yjtETK72JobZcf-21acP&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Keel, Othmar, and Uehlinger, Christoph, "Gods, goddesses, and images of God in ancient Israel" (Fortress Press, 1998) p.228.]&lt;/ref&gt; The "Asherah" is most likely a cultic object, although the relationship of this object (a stylised tree perhaps) to Yahweh and to the goddess Asherah, consort of El, is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NjYAWXO-jdAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Gods,+goddesses,+and+images+of+God+in+ancient+Israel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=js9Jn2MvVT&amp;sig=KLepiBQ_bBp_NB7juf2-4TGVfNY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yjtETK72JobZcf-21acP&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Keel, Othmar, and Uehlinger, Christoph, "Gods, goddesses, and images of God in ancient Israel" (Fortress Press, 1998) p.232–33.]&lt;/ref&gt;

An image on the piece of pottery (belonging to a [[pithos]] vase) found at Kuntillet Ajrud is adjacent to a Hebrew inscription "''Berakhti etkhem l’YHVH Shomron ul’Asherato''" ("I have blessed you by Yahweh of Samaria and [his] Asherah"). Scholars disputed about the meaning and the significance of this. The two figures portrayed are generally identifiable as representing the Egyptian god [[Bes]]. Also, it is believed that part of this image was drawn after the inscription was written, namely the figure labeled as S (the leftmost humanoid figure depicted).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proyectos.cchs.csic.es/SEL/sites/default/files/05merlo2.pdf L`Aserah di YHWH a Kuntillet Ajurd, Rassegna critica degli studi e delle interpretazioni, Paolo Merlo, 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;

The excavation report by Ze'ev Meshel was published in 2012.

A '''limner''' is an [[illuminated manuscript|illuminator of manuscripts]], or more generally, a painter of ornamental decoration. One of the earliest mentions of a limner's work is found in the book ''Methods and Materials of Painting'' by [[Charles Lock Eastlake]] (1793–1865).

In London in the mid-19th century the limner [[David Laurent de Lara]] established himself as a modern illuminator of manuscripts and documents.&lt;ref name=pal&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Rubinstein |editor1-first=William L.|editor2-last=Jolles|editor2-first=Michael|editor3-last=Rubinstein |editor3-first=Hilary |title=The Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish History |isbn=9780230318946 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=spOxzrifZjcC&amp;pg=PA551&amp;lpg=PA551#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |chapter=Laurent de Lara, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work broke new ground and helped establish the idea of illumination as a contemporary artform in its own right, rather than as a historical artform.&lt;ref name=rowan&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watson|first1=Rowan|editor1-last=Coomans D|editor1-first=Thomas|editor2-last=De Maeyer|editor2-first=Jan|title=The revival of medieval illumination : nineteenth-century Belgium manuscripts and illuminations from a european perspective = Renaissance de l'enluminure médiévale : manuscripts et enluminures belges du XIXe siècle et leur contexte européen |date=2007 |publisher=KADOC |location=Leuven |isbn=9789058675910 |pages=88–92 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7VsLdTWjlnoC&amp;pg=PA88|chapter=Publishing for the Leisure Industry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The office of Her Majesty's [[Painter and Limner]] is a position within the [[Great Officer of State|Royal Household]] unique to Scotland. It is currently held by Dame Elizabeth Blackadder.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Birthdays Today 24 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The position of portrait painter to the royal household is honorary and for life.

==United States==
In early 19th-century America, a limner artist was one who had little if any formal training and would travel from place to place to solicit commissions.

Among colonial America's rising mercantile class, a limner was an unattributed [[portrait]] commissioned as a status symbol. The local landowners and merchants who commissioned these portraits posed in their finest clothes, in well-appointed interiors, or in landscapes that identified their position, property, good taste, and sophistication.

A late named artist who began in this genre is the [[Maine]] landscape artist [[Charles Codman]], who in Eastern Argus (April 1, 1831) is described as an "ornamental and sign painter" or "limner" who practiced "Military, Standard, Fancy, Ornamental, Masonic and Sign Painting".&lt;ref&gt;Nicoll, Jessica.

The Victoria Limners Society was a group of artists working in Victoria, British Columbia from 1971 through 2008. They worked within a variety of artistic styles and mediums, such as painting, sculpting, pottery, and other forms of visual art.&lt;ref&gt;Bovey, Patricia.

Victoria, B.C.: Sono Nis Press, 1996. {{ISBN|9781550390704}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artists include Maxwell Bates, Pat Martin Bates, Richard Ciccimarra, Robert De Castro, Colin Graham, Helga Grove, Jan Grove, [[Elza Mayhew]], [[Myfanwy Pavelic]], Carole Sabiston, [[Herbert Siebner]], [[Robin Skelton]], and Karl Spreitz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memorybc.ca/limners-group-of-artists;isaar "Limners (Group of artists)"] MemoryBC&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4579">The following is a refined listing of Levantive [[archaeology|archeological]] periods, expanded from the basic [[three-age system]] with finer subdivisions and extension into the modern [[history|historical]] period.  The particular dates selected as the boundary between ages, as well as the period names for the historical era, are specific to [[Levant]]ine archaeology and therefore are most accurate in that context.  Beginning and ending dates of prehistoric ages are based on the introduction and prevalence of certain technologies, which varied from culture to culture (note: "BP" = "[[Before Present]]"); similarly, historical eras are named after cultures in whose [[sphere of influence]] the Levant was included.  However, archaeologists studying other regions have sometimes found it useful to apply the same or similar eras to their fields of research (particularly prehistoric eras), and thus this list represents the most common interpretation of broad archaeological periods.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37223">This '''list of preserved historic blast furnaces''' contains decommissioned [[blast furnace]]s, of which substantial remains survive. The furnaces are preserved in a [[park]] or museum, or as a site otherwise open to visitors, or intended to become such.

While pre-20th-century blast furnaces already have a long history of monument preservation, the perception of 20th century mass production blast furnace installations as [[industrial heritage]] is a comparably new trend. For a long time, it has been normal procedure for such a blast furnace to be demolished after being decommissioned and either be replaced with a newer, improved one, or to have the entire site demolished to make room for follow-up use of the area. It has only been in recent years{{When|date=January 2011}} that numerous countries have realized the value of blast furnaces as a part of their [[industrial history]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Historically, the first such blast furnace not to be demolished stands in [[Starachowice]], [[Poland]] (decommissioned in 1968), followed by the last blast furnace of Yahata Steel Works in [[Yahatahigashi-ku, Kitakyūshū]], [[Japan]] (decommissioned in 1972) and the "Carrie Furnaces" in [[Homestead, Pennsylvania|Homestead]], [[Pennsylvania]] in the [[United States]] (decommissioned in 1978). One of the two blast furnaces in [[Neunkirchen, Saarland|Neunkirchen]] in [[Germany]] (decommissioned in 1982) was the first blast furnace worldwide to be not just preserved, but actively refurbished for the purpose of preservation.

For 20th-century mass production blast furnaces, the degree of accurate preservation versus integration into new structures, or even re-purposing, differs between the various sites. Colorful illumination installations at night are common.

==List of preserved industrial mass production blast furnaces around the world==
These installations all date from the 20th century. They are supported by outer frames made of metal, were supplied with pre-heated blast air from external Cowper stoves, were typically part of large industrial compounds where, at one point, multiple blast furnaces were typically standing and operating side by side for efficiency reasons, raw materials were delivered by external elevating mechanisms, and the entire site was accessible by [[Freight rail transport|freight trains]] which delivered the raw materials and carried off the freshly smelted [[pig iron]] in [[Ladle (metallurgy)|ladles]].

In many cases, the preserved sites have been deliberately stripped down to minimize maintenance costs; namely, some blast furnaces and related installations have been demolished. The goal was to only retain one or two blast furnaces including the relevant related installations (such as Cowper stoves, cast house, winch house etc.), which are considered sufficient to explain the blast furnace process and all related functions to visitors.

The first such decommissioned blast furnace that wasn't demolished and has been preserved to this very day stands in [[Starachowice]], [[Poland]], and has ceased operation as early as 1968.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9081">'''Donatien Alphonse François de Sade''', best known as the [[Marquis de Sade]], was a French [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]], [[revolutionary]] and author of [[philosophical novel|philosophical]] and [[sadomasochistic]] novels exploring such controversial subjects as rape, [[bestiality]] and [[necrophilia]]. His works evidence a philosophical mind advocating a materialist philosophy in which Nature dictates absolute [[Freedom (philosophy)|freedom]], unrestrained by [[morality]], religion or law, with the pursuit of personal pleasure as its foremost principle. Besides novels, he wrote philosophical tracts, novellas, short tales, and a number of plays (many of which no longer extant).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2392">'''Minor syllable''' is a term used primarily in the description of [[Mon-Khmer languages]], where a word typically consists of a reduced (minor) [[syllable]] followed by a full tonic or stressed syllable. The minor syllable may be of the form {{IPA|/[[Consonant|C]]ə/}} or {{IPA|/Cə[[nasal consonant|N]]/}}, with a [[reduced vowel]], as in colloquial [[Khmer language|Khmer]], or of the form {{IPA|/CC/}} with no vowel at all, as in [[Mlabri language|Mlabri]] {{IPA|/kn̩diːŋ/}} "navel" (minor syllable {{IPA|/kn̩/}}) and {{IPA|/br̩poːŋ/}} "underneath" (minor syllable {{IPA|/br̩/}}), and [[Khasi language|Khasi]] ''kyndon'' {{IPA|/kn̩dɔːn/}} "rule" (minor syllable {{IPA|/kn̩/}}), ''syrwet'' {{IPA|/sr̩wɛt̚/}} "sign" (minor syllable {{IPA|/sr̩/}}), ''kylla'' {{IPA|/kl̩la/}} "transform" (minor syllable {{IPA|/kl̩/}}), ''symboh'' {{IPA|/sm̩bɔːʔ/}} "seed" (minor syllable {{IPA|/sm̩/}}) and ''tyngkai'' {{IPA|/tŋ̩kaːɪ/}} "conserve" (minor syllable {{IPA|/tŋ̩/}}). This [[Iamb (foot)|iambic]] pattern is sometimes called ''sesquisyllabic'' (lit. 'one and a half syllables'), a term coined by the American linguist [[James Matisoff]] in 1973:86. Outside Mon-Khmer, minor syllables are found in [[Burmese language|Burmese]], where in contrast to full syllables they have the form {{IPA|/Cə/}}, with no [[consonant cluster]]s allowed in the [[syllable onset]], no [[syllable coda]], and no [[tone (linguistics)|tone]].  Recent reconstructions of [[Proto-Tai]] and [[Old Chinese]] also include sesquisyllabic roots with minor syllables, as transitional forms between fully disyllabic words and the monosyllabic words found in modern [[Tai languages]] and modern [[Chinese language|Chinese]].

{{nihongo|'''''Montana Jones'''''|モンタナ・ジョーンズ|Montana Jōnzu}} is an Italian-Japanese comedy adventure [[anime]] [[television program|television series]] which was broadcast in [[Japan]] on [[NHK]] from April 2, 1994 through April 8, 1995. [[Studio Junio]] ([[Japan]]) and [[REVER]] ([[Italy]]) created the 52 episode series as a joint production. ''Montana Jones'' has a similar atmosphere to ''[[Sherlock Hound]]'', a joint production of [[RAI]] and [[TMS Entertainment]] ten years earlier. The [[anthropomorphic]] characters in ''Montana Jones'' were [[big cat]]s instead of the dogs used in ''Sherlock Hound''. It was subsequently broadcast in over 30 other countries.

The series takes place in the 1930s and is about the adventures of Montana Jones, who goes treasure hunting with his [[cousin]] Alfred Jones and the beautiful [[reporter]] Melissa Thorn. They visit real locations and cities like the [[Pyramids of Giza]], the [[Taj Mahal]], [[Istanbul]] or [[Easter Island]]. Frequently they cross paths with Lord Zero - a rich, eccentric art lover and master thief. All characters in the series are anthropomorphized big cats. The anime was inspired by the [[Indiana Jones]] movies.

== Synopsis ==
[[Boston]], 1930:
Montana Jones and his cousin professor Alfred Jones travel around the world to search lost treasures in order to bring them  to museums. Alfred's mentor Professor Gerrit helps them by sending [[gramophone records]] with information. On one trip they meet Melissa, a wealthy reporter, who speaks nearly all languages. She accompanies the two on their trips. Their opponent is Lord Zero, a rich, bizarre art lover and master thief. Lord Zero has two henchmen: Slim and Slam. There is also the inventor Dr. Nitro, who invents strange engines, which to help finding treasures.

== Main characters ==

===Montana Jones===
{{nihongo|Montana|モンタナ・ジョーンズ|Montana Jōnzu}} is always seeking the unknown and isn't afraid to do dangerous things. Together with his cousin Alfred he travels around the world finding treasures for Gerrit, Alfred's professor. The group's plans are often foiled by Lord Zero.  Montana works in his aunt's restaurant to finance his airplane Ketty, a Supermarine GS waterplane constantly in need of repair. He lives somewhere on the coast in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. It is believed that Montana is infatuated with Melissa Thorn.

He was voiced by [[Akio Ohtsuka]].

===Alfred Jones===
{{nihongo|Alfred|アルフレッド・ジョーンズ|Arufureddo Jōnzu}} likes to study old cultures, strange languages, and treasures.  On the other hand, he hates danger, travelling, and can't swim, making him an opposite of his cousin Montana.  Together, the two make a good team. Alfred loves his mother and eating spaghetti bolognese, which he often prepares for Melissa and Montana.

He was voiced by [[Ryusei Nakao]].

===Melissa Thorn===
{{nihongo|Melissa Thorn|メリッサ・ソーン|Merissa Sōn}} often helps Montana and Alfred and is the daughter of a diplomat. Melissa is a journalist and enjoys shopping and adventures with the two.
In the last episode her father is revealed to be Professor Gerrit, explaining why Melissa was always at the right time and place to help Montana and Alfred.

She was voiced by [[Junko Iwao]].

===Agatha Jones===
{{nihongo|Agatha|アガサ・ジョーンズ|Agasa Jōnzu}}（episodes 1-8, 10, 12-13, 15-18, 23, 24-28, 33-34, 38-39, 45, 51-52) is Alfred's mother, and Montana's aunt.

She was voiced by [[Rihoko Yoshida]].

===Lord Zero===
{{nihongo|Lord Zero|ゼロ卿|Zero-kyō}} is the main antagonist of the story, constantly trying to get all the treasure for himself only to be thwarted by Montana and Alfred. Usually his plans are foiled because of a mistake from his minions Slim, Slam or Dr. Nitro. Lord Zero is notable for his walking staffs, which all have strange and diverse functionalities. Zero is constantly in a bad mood, and personally hates the excuse "I'm sorry, it wouldn't have happened if you gave me more time and money."

He was voiced by [[Ryuzaburo Otomo]].

===Slim and Slam===
{{nihongo|Slim and Slam|スリム＆スラム|Surimu to Suramu}} are the bumbling minions of Lord Zero. The two know searching for the treasures themselves would be more successful but their loyalty is greater than their daring. They often do the difficult work for Lord Zero, and when things go wrong they usually take the blame. Ironically, Slim is the larger of the two.

Slim was voiced by [[Toshiharu Sakurai]] and Slam was voiced by [[Chō]].

===Dr. Nitro===
{{nihongo|Doctor Nitro|ニトロ博士|Nitoro-hakase}} is a minion of Lord Zero and a genius. He is a creator of machines for Lord Zero that never seem to work the right way, and often gives the excuse "it wouldn't have happened if you gave me more time and money" to defend them.  Unfortunately, Lord Zero hates that excuse.

He was voiced by [[Junpei Takiguchi]].

The full title is '''An Act to Authorize Appropriations for fiscal year 2013 for military activities of the Department of Defense, for military construction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes.'''  This law has been assigned the number PL 112-239.

==Information regarding the bill prior to bill enactment==
So as to not have the Act run into the same legal trouble [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012|as the 2012 version did]], the United States House of Representatives included section 1029, which affirmed the right of [[habeas corpus]] and the Constitutional right of due process for American citizens.&lt;ref name="H.R. 4310" /&gt; However, there were criticisms of the Act, especially with regard to a "readiness" and funding for an attack on Iran.&lt;ref name="Reuters20120518"&gt;{{cite web|last=Alexander|first=David|title=House-backed defense budget sets up clash with Obama|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/18/us-usa-defense-budget-idUSBRE84G1IM20120518|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=13 July 2012|date=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism had also been voiced regarding section 1033 of the House bill version which would state that nothing in the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists|Authorization for Use of Military Force]] (Public Law 107-40) or the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012]] (Public Law 112-81) shall be construed to deny the availability of the writ of habeas corpus in [[Article Three of the United States Constitution#Section 1: Federal courts|a court ordained or established by or under Article III of the Constitution]] for any person who is detained in the United States pursuant to the Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-40).&lt;ref name="Reuters20120518" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 4310—FY13 National Defense Authorization Bill Chairman's Mark|url=http://armedservices.house.gov/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=e7c34102-53e4-455a-b345-358f3e99e8cc|publisher=[[United States House Committee on Armed Services]]|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feinstein-Lee Amendment===

The NDAA, an otherwise mundane annual bill that lays out the use of funds for the Department of Defense, has come under attack during the Obama administration for the introduction of a provision in 2012  that allows the military to detain United States citizens indefinitely without charge or trial for mere suspicions of ties to terrorism. Under the 2012 NDAA's Sec. 1021, U.S. President Obama did not agree to give the military the power to arrest and hold Americans without the writ of habeas corpus as he promised with that year's signing statement that his administration would not abuse that privilege.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obama signs NDAA 2013 without objecting to indefinite detention of Americans|url=http://rt.com/usa/news/obama-ndaa-detention-president-288/|work=Russia Today|publisher=Russia Today|accessdate=24 January 2013|date=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anders was also worried that the amendment could be construed to actually imply that the U.S. government has the constitutional authority for indefinite detention without charge and trial.&lt;ref name="MJ20121130" /&gt; "Moreover, we are very concerned that the Feinstein amendment implicitly authorizes domestic military detention. By seeking to protect only United States citizens and legal permanent residents, the amendment could be read to imply that indefinite military detention of any other persons apprehended within the United States was authorized in 2001 and was lawful," the ACLU wrote, referring to the Authorization for Use of Military Force, the founding document of the "war on terror" that was passed the week after the 9/11 attacks. "In addition, the clause 'unless an Act of Congress expressly authorizes such detention' could be read to imply that there are no constitutional obstacles to Congress enacting a statute that would authorize the domestic military detention of any person in the United States," the ACLU wrote.&lt;ref name="IndianCountry20121206" /&gt;

A Congressional conference committee tasked with merging the House and Senate versions of the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) decided on December 18, 2012 to drop the Feinstein-Lee provision, which would have explicitly barred the military from holding American citizens and permanent residents in indefinite detention without trial as terrorism suspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bell|first=Zachary|title=NDAA's indefinite detention without trial returns|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/12/19/ndaas_indefinite_detention_without_trial_returns/|publisher=salon.com|accessdate=20 December 2012|date=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Savage|first=Charlie|title=Congressional Negotiators Drop Ban on Indefinite Detention of Citizens, Aides Say|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/19/us/politics/congressional-committee-is-said-to-drop-ban-on-indefinite-detention-of-citizens.html?_r=0|accessdate=20 December 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelley|first=Michael|title=Lawyers Fighting NDAA Indefinite Detention Slam Congress' Latest Decision|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/lawyers-mad-about-feinstein-amendment-2012-12|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=20 December 2012|date=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no reason given for this.&lt;ref name="Politico20121812"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gerstein|first=Josh|title=Conference committee drops ban on indefinite detention of Americans|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2012/12/conference-committee-drops-ban-on-indefinite-detention-152352.html|accessdate=20 December 2012|newspaper=Politico|date=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the following replacement provivison was added:

{{quote|Nothing in the Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107–40; 50 U.S.C. 1541) or the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (Public Law 112–81) shall be construed to deny the availability of the writ of habeas corpus or to deny any Constitutional rights in a court ordained or established by or under Article III of the Constitution to any person inside the United States who would be entitled to the availability of such writ or to such rights in the absence of such laws.&lt;ref name="THP20121218"&gt;{{cite news|last=McAUliff|first=Michael|title=NDAA Indefinite Detention Provision Mysteriously Stripped From Bill|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/18/ndaa-indefinite-detention_n_2326225.html|accessdate=20 December 2012|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Huffington Post noted that the replacement version appeared to do little, because the Supreme Court has already declared that the writ of habeas corpus, i.e. the constitutional requirement that someone be presented to a judge, applies to all people. This was echoed from the civil liberties groups. "This language doesn't do anything of substance," said Raha Wala, a lawyer in the law and national security program of Human Rights First. "It doesn't ban indefinite detention within the United States or change anything about existing law."&lt;ref name="THP20121218" /&gt; Chris Anders from the American Civil Liberties Union called the language on indefinite detention of Americans "completely meaningless" and added there's no doubt that habeas rights are available to anyone who's detained in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Politico20121812" /&gt;

HJ Adams, a lawyer for the group of journalists and activists suing the U.S. government over the 2012 NDAA, explained that the above quoted provision gives U.S. citizens a right to go to civilian (i.e. [[Federal tribunals in the United States|Article III]]) court based on "any [applicable] constitutional rights," but since there are no rules in place to exercise this right, detained U.S. citizens currently have no way to gain access to lawyers, family or the court itself once they are detained within the military. Afran added that the new statute actually states that persons lawfully in the U.S. can be detained under the Authorization for the Use of Military Force [AUMF], while [[w:Hedges v. Obama|the original statute from the 2012 NDAA which he is fighting]] never went that far. Afran concluded: "Therefore, under the guise of supposedly adding protection to Americans, the new statute actually expands the AUMF to civilians in the U.S."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelley|first=Michael|title=Actually, The Newest Version Of NDAA Makes It EASIER To Detain Citizens Indefinitely|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/ndaa-americans-indefinite-detention2012-11#ixzz2FVuWSoLd|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=20 December 2012|date=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Media and Outreach Coordinator for the U.S. State Department's Bureau of African Affairs, Gregory L.

Tear down that firewall, and it will be a matter of time before resources and personnel who focus on talking about America overseas are diverted in favor of domestic "public affairs," the short-term political imperative of any administration." An unnamed Pentagon official who was concerned about the 2012 law version stated: "It removes the protection for Americans. It removes oversight from the people who want to put out this information. There are no checks and balances. No one knows if the information is accurate, partially accurate, or entirely false."&lt;ref name="BFD20120518" /&gt; The monthly magazine ''The Atlantic'' echoed those concerns by pointing out to two USA Today journalists who became target of a smear and propaganda campaign after they reported that the U.S. military "information operations" program spent millions of U.S. dollars in marketing campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq criticized as ineffective and poorly monitored.&lt;ref name="FP20130716" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Korte|first=Gregory|title=Misinformation campaign targets USA Today reporter, editor|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/story/2012-04-19/vanden-brook-locker-propaganda/54419654/1|accessdate=5 April 2014|newspaper=USA Today|date=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it turned out one of firm leaders who executed the marketing campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan admitted to be a part of the smear and propaganda campaign against the USA Today reporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cook|first=John|title=Propaganda Contractor Admits to Running Smear Campaign Against USA Today Reporters (Update)|url=http://gawker.com/5913166/propaganda-contractor-admits-to-running-smear-campaign-against-usa-today-reporters|accessdate=5 April 2014|date=24 May 2012|publisher=gawker.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are concerns as the described above there are also advantages by repealing the release prohibition of material materials produced by the State Department and the BBG within US borders. Garland for example wrote that the provision banning domestic dissemination deprives the United States in a communication age with no frontiers the U.S. of its "most powerful tool of soft power: our ideals."&lt;ref name="ADMarch2012" /&gt;

'''Oxford Archaeology''' ('''OA''', trading name of '''Oxford Archaeology Limited''') is one of the largest and longest-established independent [[archaeology]] and heritage practices in [[Europe]], operating from three permanent offices in Oxford, Lancaster and Cambridge, and working across the UK. OA is a Registered Organisation with the Chartered [[Institute for Archaeologists]] (CIfA), and carries out commercial archaeological fieldwork in advance of development, as well as a range of other heritage related services. Oxford Archaeology primarily operates in the UK, but has also carried out contracts around the world, including [[Sudan]], [[Qatar]], [[Central Asia]], [[China]] and the [[Caribbean]]. Numbers of employees vary owing to the project-based nature of the work, but in 2014 OA employed over 220 people.

The registered head office is in [[Osney Mead]], [[Oxford]], southern [[England]]; this address is also the base for '''OA South'''. Other offices are '''OA North''' in [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], northern [[England]], '''OA East''' in [[Bar Hill, Cambridgeshire]], eastern [[England]]. Between 2007 and 2011, OA had offices in [[Mauguio]] ('''OA Méditerranée'''), southern [[France]] and [[Caen]] ('''OA Grand Ouest'''), northern [[France]].

==Oxford Archaeology South (OAS)==

In the late 1960s, the recently created Oxford City and County Museum led the archaeological response to a development boom in [[Oxfordshire]]. However, the [[museum]] lacked the resources to tackle the rescue crisis alone. The museum's answer was to form independent excavation committees in response to specific development threats, starting in [[Oxford]] in 1967. These committees were registered charities with public benefit at the heart of their purpose. They employed short-term contract staff, supplemented by volunteer diggers.

Soon a number of committees were operating, which tended to have the same governing members drawn from Central and Local Government, [[Oxford University]] and local archaeological societies. They also competed for the same funds. A consensus rapidly emerged that this duplication was wasteful and that all the committees should pool their resources to provide a county-wide service for archaeological research, using the opportunities presented by development. Thus the Oxfordshire Archaeological Committee and its executive arm, the Oxfordshire Archaeological Unit, came into existence in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9425710&amp;fileId=S0003598X00054338 |title=The Oxfordshire Archaeological Unit &amp;#124; Cambridge Core |doi=10.1017/S0003598X00054338 |website=Journals.cambridge.org |date=2015-01-01 |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following years, the company adjusted flexibly to changing conditions, and expanded outside the county (hence the change in name to the Oxford Archaeological Unit). It also became a limited liability company, adjusted to new funding streams, and it embraced new methods and technologies. The company began trading as Oxford Archaeology in 2001.

Recent notable excavations include the excavation of prehistoric flint scatters and a Roman bloomery at the Bexhill-Hastings Link Road,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxfordarchaeology.com/news/oasouth-news/278-remarkable-prehistoric-discoveries-beneath-bexhill-to-hastings-link-road |title=Flint scatters and other prehistoric discoveries beneath Bexhill-Hastings link road |publisher=Oxford Archaeology |date=2014-03-15 |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; the medieval friary of Greyfriars at [[Wesgate, Oxford|Westgate Oxford]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oxfordarchaeology.com/our-projects/westgate-oxford |title=Westgate Oxford |publisher=Oxford Archaeology |date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a WWI mass grave of Australian soldiers at [[Fromelles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bhattacharya |first=Shaoni |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22429940.700-mass-grave-tells-tales-of-life-on-the-forgotten-front.html |title=Mass grave tells tales of life on the Forgotten Front |doi=10.1111/1556-4029.12361 |publisher=[[New Scientist]] |date=2014-11-05 |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oxford Archaeology North (OAN)==
The [[Lancaster University]] Archaeological Unit (LUAU), together with its staff, became the northern office of Oxford Archaeology on 1 November 2001. This followed a decision that the needs of a professional archaeological unit could no longer be best served by its continuance within the university. OAN continued the wide range of work undertaken in the past, from desk-based assessments, through evaluation and rapid surveys of both the landscape and the built and industrial environments, to major excavations. Particular specialisations are upland survey and the excavation and recording of standing industrial remains.

OAN has taken the lead within OA on all archaeological projects carried out by the organisation throughout the north of England. OAN has worked on a great number of sites across northern England, and brought them to publication. These have included infrastructure projects on the A1(M), A66, the Asselby to Pannal and West East Link Main pipelines, and the [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] North Development Route (CNDR)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cndr.thehumanjourney.net/ |title=Carlisle Northern Development Route &amp;#124; Archaeological Post-Excavation Project |website=Cndr.thehumanjourney.net |date= |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;. OAN has also worked extensively on cemeteries and burials across northern England, including a [[Viking]] cemetery at [[Cumwhitton]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehumanjourney.net/html_pages/microsites/vikingburial/indepth.htm |title=Norse Burials at Cumwhitton - in depth |website=Thehumanjourney.net |date=2004-04-23 |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;, medieval and post-medieval graveyards, and at [[Furness Abbey]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxfordarchaeology.com/featured-projects-by-name/226-furness-abbey-cumbria |title=Furness Abbey, Cumbria |publisher=Oxford Archaeology |date= |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a high-ranking clergyman was excavated. Since the North was the cradle of the [[Industrial Revolution]], the investigation of factories, mills and workers’ housing also forms an important part of OAN’s work.

==Oxford Archaeology East (OAE)==
In 2008, [[Cambridgeshire County Council]]'s Field Unit, CAMARC, joined Oxford Archaeology as its third regional centre. CAMARC itself was a recently revised name for an organisation that had been given a variety of titles over more than 20 years of existence. Its lineage started in the early 1980s with [[Manpower Services Commission]]-funded community programme projects, and it continued to carry out developer-funded work in the mid-80s as the 'Archaeological Field Unit'.

OAE continues to deliver major programmes for infrastructure projects and for smaller-scale developments in both rural and urban areas. Its large rural landscape projects include complex [[Middle Bronze Age]] field systems, enclosures and settlements at Clay Farm, [[Trumpington, Cambridgeshire|Trumpington]]. Recent urban schemes include the Itter Crescent [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[villa]] excavation in [[Peterborough]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-16512512 |title=Roman villa 'rare and important for Peterborough' says archaeologist |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and excavations of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Medieval]] settlement relating to [[Stourbridge Fair]] at Harvest Way, Newmarket Road, [[Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxfordarchaeology.com/news/oaeast-news |title=oaeast news |publisher=Oxford Archaeology |date= |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
Having published some 200 monographs, reports and booklets, Oxford Archaeology has established itself as a major publisher of archaeological reports with the production of monograph series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxfordarchaeology.com/professional-services/researchandpublication/35-oxford-archaeologys-services/archaeological-research-and-publication/67-academic-monographs-and-books |title=Monographs and books |publisher=Oxford Archaeology |date= |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as Thames Valley Landscapes and Lancaster Imprints, and contributions to other major series, including East Anglian Archaeology Reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eaareports.org.uk/ |title=East Anglian Archaeology |website=Eaareports.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; OA has also produced many ‘popular’ publications, pamphlets and booklets written in a less technical style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxfordarchaeology.com/professional-services/researchandpublication/7-top-level-pages/122-archaeology-popular-publications |title=Popular publications |publisher=Oxford Archaeology |date= |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxford Archaeology has contributed many archaeology reports and research papers to county, national and period archaeological journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxfordarchaeology.com/professional-services/researchandpublication/35-oxford-archaeologys-services/archaeological-research-and-publication/69-journal-articles |title=Journal articles |publisher=Oxford Archaeology |date= |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, as part of its commitment to open access for archaeological data, Oxford Archaeology has developed the OA Library, an online resource used to disseminate digital material, including ‘grey literature’ client reports [[grey literature]] online,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.thehumanjourney.net |title=Welcome to the OA Library |website=Library.thehumanjourney.net |date= |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; selected monographs, and supporting archives produced by Oxford Archaeology. It also makes available internally developed software on the [[Launchpad (website)|Launchpad]] site under the umbrella project ''Open Archaeology''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://launchpad.net/openarchaeology |title=The Open Archaeology Software Suite in Launchpad |website=Launchpad.net |date= |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological survey==
Oxford Archaeology has incorporated digital survey techniques into its geomatics work. The most notable of these techniques is [[Photogrammetry|photogrammetric mapping]], which uses photographs taken from an [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)]] to create accurate three-dimensional models of the archaeological evidence, including artefacts, historic buildings or whole landscapes. Other techniques for data capture include differential [[Real Time Kinematic|RTK GPS]], [[3D scanner|3D laser scanning]], [[Lidar]] and [[Total station|Total Station]] surveys. 

During excavations by OAS at [[Westgate, Oxford|Westgate Oxford]], the site of a medieval Greyfriars friary, three-dimensional models were generated through a combination of standard archaeological survey techniques and photogrammetric or [[Structure from motion|structure from motion]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://skfb.ly/MsCz |title=Oxford Westgate - Medieval Greyfriars Complex |publisher=Sketchfab |accessdate=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photogrammetry and 3D modelling has not been confined to structures. The skeletons from a late Roman and Saxon cemetery at Cherry Hinton in Cambridge,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/news/cambridge-news/highly-important-anglo-saxon-village-12432124 |title='Highly important' Anglo-Saxon village remains discovered in Cambridge housing site |publisher=Cambridge News |accessdate=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; excavated by OAE, were recorded using photogrammetry. UAVs have been used by OAN to map extensive landscapes, such as the former [[Greenside Mine|Greenside lead mine]] in the [[Lake District]]. The combination of a UAV, photogrammetry and detailed [[Orthophoto|orthophotos]] captured the complex lead mining landscape, which comprised spoil heaps, mine shafts, wheel pits, engine houses, and trackways, among other remains. Oxford Archaeology uses a hand-held laser scanner that has an [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measurement unit (IMU)]] and a small scanner mounted on top. These features allow the scanner to fix its location precisely and the surveyor to record the interior of a building in as much time as it takes to walk through it. Combining photogrammetry with the laser scanner also allows whole buildings to be recorded in 3D. OAN has employed the hand-held laser scanner to record Daisy Mill, a former Victorian cotton mill in south Manchester, and Lion Mill, a corn mill in Stonyhurst in Lancashire.

==Charitable aims and outreach==
A registered charitable trust&lt;ref&gt;Registered charity 285627&lt;/ref&gt; with educational aims, OA has various outreach and community archaeology projects running alongside its commercial work. All three offices engage in outreach and public engagement, with a particular focus at OAE. Recent highlights include the volunteer dig at Maryport [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] settlement &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cumbria-27592597 |title=Maryport Roman settlement: Dig unearths 'lost harbour' |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Jigsaw Cambridgeshire project which trains and supports local archaeology societies across [[Cambridgeshire]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jigsawcambs.org |title=Home |website=Jigsawcambs.org |date= |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of [[geodesy]], '''Receiver Independent Exchange Format''' ('''RINEX''') is a data interchange format for raw [[global navigation satellite system|satellite navigation system]] data. This allows the user to post-process the received data to produce a more accurate result &amp;mdash; usually with other data unknown to the original receiver, such as better models of the atmospheric conditions at time of measurement.

The final output of a navigation receiver is usually its position, speed or other related physical quantities. However, the calculation of these quantities are based on a series of measurements from one or more satellite constellations. Although receivers calculate positions in real time, in many cases it is interesting to store intermediate measures for later use. RINEX is the standard format that allows the management and disposal of the measures generated by a receiver, as well as their off-line processing by a multitude of applications, whatever the manufacturer of both the receiver and the computer application.

The RINEX format is designed to evolve over time, adapting to new types of measurements and new satellite navigation systems. The first RINEX version was published by W. Gurtner and G. Mader in the CSTG GPS Bulletin of September/October 1990. Since 1993 the RINEX 2 is available, which has been revised and adopted several times. RINEX enables storage of measurements of [[pseudorange]], [[Global_Positioning_System#Carrier_phase_tracking_.28surveying.29|carrier-phase]], [[Doppler radar|Doppler]] and signal-to-noise from [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] (including [[GPS modernization signals]] e.g. L5 and L2C), [[GLONASS]], [[Galileo_(satellite_navigation)|Galileo]], [[Beidou_navigation_satellite_system|Beidou]], along with data from [[European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service|EGNOS]] and [[Wide Area Augmentation System|WAAS]] [[satellite based augmentation system]]s (SBAS), [[QZSS]], simultaneously. RINEX version 3.02 was submitted in April 2013 and is capable of new measurements{{what|date=March 2014}} from [[GPS modernization|GPS]] or [[Galileo_(satellite_navigation)|Galileo]] systems. The most recent version is RINEX 3.03 from July 2015 with update 1 to 3.03 published in 2017.&lt;ref name="Rinex2107"&gt;{{cite web|title=RINEX The Receiver Independent Exchange Format Version 3.03, Update 1|url=ftp://igs.org/pub/data/format/rinex303_update1.pdf|publisher=International GNSS Service|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not part of the RINEX format, the ''Hatanaka compression scheme '' is commonly used to reduced the size of RINEX files, resulting in an ASCII-based CompactRINEX format.&lt;ref name="Rinex2107" /&gt;. It uses higher-order time differences to reduce the number of characters needed to store time data.&lt;ref name="Hatanaka2008"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hatanaka|first1=Yuki|title=A Compression Format and Tools for GNSS Observation Data|url=http://www.gsi.go.jp/common/000045517.pdf|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21234">'''Remodernism''' revives aspects of [[modernism]], particularly in its early form, and follows [[postmodernism]], to which it contrasts. Adherents of remodernism advocate it as a forward and radical, not reactionary, impetus.&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt;&lt;ref name=medina/&gt;

In 2000, [[Billy Childish]] and [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]], founders of the [[stuckism]] art movement instigated remodernism,&lt;ref name=packer/&gt; with a manifesto, ''Remodernism'' in an attempt to introduce a period of new spirituality into art, culture and society to replace postmodernism, which they said was cynical and spiritually bankrupt. In 2002, a remodernism art show in [[Albuquerque]] was accompanied by an essay from [[University of California, Berkeley]] art professor, Kevin Radley, who said there was a renewal of artists working without the limitation of irony and cynicism, and that there was a renewal of the sense of beauty.

In 2006, the [[Stedelijk Museum]] and the [[University of Amsterdam]] held a talk on remodernism with Daniel Birnbaum and Alison Gingeras; the introduction to this talked of the revival of painting as a possible return to traditional modernist values, such as [[Authenticity in art|authenticity]], self-expression and autonomy, as opposed to multimedia practice.
&lt;ref name=amsterdam/&gt; In 2008, London ''[[Evening Standard]]'' critic, Ben Lewis, applied the term to three [[Turner Prize]] nominees and saw them amongst a movement which was reviving the formalism of the early 20th century; he advocated values of an aesthetic informed by modesty, generosity and genuine emotion.&lt;ref name=lewis-turner/&gt;

==History==
[[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]] and [[Billy Childish]], the founders of the [[stuckism]] art movement, inaugurated the period of remodernism.&lt;ref name=packer&gt;Packer, William. "Childish artists coming unstuck", p.13, and "Young pretenders of art have much to learn", p. 20, ''[[Financial Times]]'', March 13, 2001. The text from different editions is the same: "Childish and his co-founder, Charles Thomson, ushered in remodernism, 'a period of art . . . to reclaim the vision and spiritual values of the early Modernists and replace the ennui of Post-Modernism'."&lt;/ref&gt; Their ''Remodernism'' manifesto was published on March 1, 2000 to promote vision, authenticity and self-expression, with an emphasis on painting, and subtitled "towards a new spirituality in art." Its premise is that the potential of the [[Modernism|modernist]] vision has not been fulfilled, that its development has been in the wrong direction and that this vision needs to be reclaimed, redefined and redeveloped. It advocates the search for truth, knowledge and meaning, and challenges [[formalism (art)|formalism]].

|colspan="2"|&lt;small&gt;In 1999, Childish and Thomson wrote a remodernism manifesto, calling for a period of new spirituality in art, culture and society to replace [[postmodernism]].&lt;/small&gt;
|}

It has a short introduction, summing up: "Modernism has progressively lost its way, until finally toppling into the bottomless pit of Postmodern balderdash." This is followed by 14 numbered points, stressing bravery, individuality, inclusiveness, communication, humanity and the perennial against nihilism, scientific materialism and the "brainless destruction of convention." Point 7 states:
{{quote|Spirituality is the journey of the soul on earth. Its first principle is a declaration of intent to face the truth. Truth is what it is, regardless of what we want it to be. Being a spiritual artist means addressing unflinchingly our projections, good and bad, the attractive and the grotesque, our strengths as well as our delusions, in order to know ourselves and thereby our true relationship with others and our connection to the divine.}}
Point 9 states: "Spiritual art is not religion. Spirituality is humanity's quest to understand itself and finds its symbology through the clarity and integrity of its artists." Point 12 links its use of the word "God" to enthusiasm&amp;mdash;from the Greek root ''en theos'' (to be possessed by God).

The summary at the end starts, "It is quite clear to anyone of an uncluttered mental disposition that what is now put forward, quite seriously, as art by the ruling elite, is proof that a seemingly rational development of a body of ideas has gone seriously awry," and finds the solution is a spiritual renaissance because "there is nowhere else for art to go. Stuckism's mandate is to initiate that spiritual renaissance now."&lt;ref&gt;Childish, Billy, and Thomson, Charles. [http://www.stuckism.com/remod.html "Remodernism"], stuckism.com, March 1, 2000.

Childish and Thomson sent their remodernism manifesto to [[Nicholas Serota|Sir Nicholas Serota]], Director of the [[Tate Gallery]], who replied, "You will not be surprised to learn that I have no comment to make on your letter, or your manifesto ''Remodernism''."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021221052217/http://www.hatii.arts.gla.ac.uk/MultimediaStudentProjects/00-01/9704524l/MM%20Project/Html/stuck2.htm "Stuck on the Turner Prize: Send in the clowns"], [[University of Glasgow]].

In March 2000 the [[Stuckism|Stuckists]] declared themselves to be the first remodernist art group at a show ''The Resignation of Sir Nicholas Serota''. In April, remodernism was quoted in ''The Gulf News'' ([[UAE]]).&lt;ref&gt;Lethbridge, Lucy (2000)[&lt;!--http://www.gulf-news.co.ae/18042000/FRIDAY/fri6.htm DEAD LINK REPLACED WITH INTERNET ARCHIVE CACHE --&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20010222155937/http://www.gulf-news.co.ae/18042000/FRIDAY/fri6.htm "Letter from London"] ''The Gulf News'', May 14, 2000.

In June, Thomson and Childish gave a talk on stuckism and remodernism at the Salon des Arts, Kensington, promoted by the [[Institute of Ideas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/Vine1/Salon.html "Stella Vine meets (and joins) the Stuckists"] stuckism.com.

The show curator, Yoshimi Hayashi, said:
{{quote|ReMo incorporates ideas from Modernism, Avantegardism, and Post Modernism; thus synthesizing an alternative and real time contemporary approach to art. In ReMo, issues such as multiculturalism, irony, the sublime, and identity are considered; however, they do not become the art itself. The reconsideration and redefinition of the traditions are sought not by mere deconstructionism, but rather by connecting new nodes of ideas. Therefore, by definition, ReMo is fundamentally cellular and its roots stem from provincial art settings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020207064328/http://www.magnifico.org/exh_pgm/ReMo_2002.html "Magnífico presents ReMo"], Magnifico, 2002.

Stuckist artist [[Bill Lewis]], interviewed by the [[BBC]] at the 2004 [[Liverpool Biennial]], said that remodernism was "not a movement as such,"&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt; but a return to the start of modernism in order to move forward with an art for a new paradigm.&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt; To "remodernise" is to go "back to the root again, starting with painting ... and see where it goes."&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt; He said that this had been called reactionary, but it was radical "in the true sense of the word."&lt;ref name=lewis&gt;[[Bill Lewis|Lewis, Bill]].

In August 2006, an online group called "The Remodernists of Deviantart" was founded by Clay Martin. The group is composed of artists who are active on the website deviantart.com. 

In 2006, artist Matt Bray said, "I do not wish to be considered a Stuckist, as I find some of there (sic) antics unnecessary. The Stuckists are however the first and most famous Remodernist group, so for that, and for bringing this particular manifesto to my attention; I thank them."&lt;ref&gt;Bray, Matt (2006)[http://www.artnowuk.com/ "Art Portal: Matt Bray 2006"] artnow.uk.com.

{{quote|Remodernism in general embraces the bravery of the amateur, so craft is a strange thing to think about. Craft is usually about something striving for perfection, without flaws, to be "professional". I don't like that. However if you consider craft something that can be developed and grown, I like that. I like the idea of filmmakers teaching themselves to paint pictures, to try acting in their own movies and those of others (especially if they are shy), to be nude models for other artists, to meditate, worship if they are religious, to do things that affect their levels of consciousness, try things that make them nervous or uncomfortable, to go out and be involved in life, to find adventure, to jump in the ocean. I think that is the exploration of craft.&lt;ref name=MungBeing&gt;[http://www.mungbeing.com/issue_28.html?page=32&amp;sub_id=1565#1565 "Remodernist Film", MungBeing, October 4, 2009] Retrieved October 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''For semantic arguments in [[linguistics]], see [[verb argument]].''

A '''semantic dispute''' is a [[consensus|disagreement]] that arises if the parties involved disagree about the definition of a word or phrase, not because they disagree on material facts, but rather because they disagree on the [[definition]]s of a word (or several words) essential to formulating the claim at issue. It is sometimes held that semantic disputes are not genuine disputes at all, but very often they ''are'' regarded as perfectly genuine, e.g., in [[philosophy]]. It is also sometimes held that when a semantic dispute arises, the focus of the debate should switch from the original thesis to the meaning of the terms of which there are different definitions (understandings, concepts, etc.). Semantic disputes can result in the logical fallacy of [[equivocation]]. In politics, for example, semantic disputes can involve the meaning of words such as [[liberalism|liberal]], [[democracy|democrat]], [[conservatism|conservative]], [[republicanism|republican]], [[progressivism|progressive]], [[Freedom (political)|free]], [[Social welfare|welfare]] or [[socialist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Devitt|first=Michael|title=The Methodology of Naturalistic Semantics|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=1994|volume=91|issue=10|pages=545–572|jstor=2940802|doi=10.2307/2940802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social support''' is the perception and actuality that one is cared for, has assistance available from other people, and most popularly, that one is part of a supportive [[social network]]. These supportive resources can be emotional (e.g., nurturance), tangible (e.g., financial assistance), informational (e.g., advice), or companionship (e.g., sense of belonging) and intangible (e.g., personal advice).

Social support can be measured as the perception that one has assistance available, the actual received assistance, or the degree to which a person is integrated in a social network. Support can come from many sources, such as family, friends, pets, neighbors, coworkers, organizations, etc. Government-provided social support is often referred to as '''public aid''' in foreign nations. 

Social support is studied across a wide range of disciplines including [[psychology]], [[medicine]], [[sociology]], [[nursing]], [[public health]], [[education]], [[Psychiatric rehabilitation|rehabilitation]], and [[social work]]. Social support has been linked to many benefits for both physical and mental health, but "social support" (e.g., gossiping about friends) is not always beneficial.

Social support theories and models were prevalent as intensive academic studies in the 1980s and 1990s &lt;ref&gt; Vaux, A. (1988). ''Social Support: Theory, Research and Interventions''. My, NY: Praeger. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Racino, J. (2006). Social support. In: G. Albrecht, ''Encyclopedia on Disability'', 1470-1471. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE. &lt;/ref&gt;, and are linked to the development of caregiving and payment models, and community delivery systems in the US and around the world. &lt;ref&gt; O'Connor, S. (1995). More than they bargained for: The meaning of support to families. In: S. J. Taylor, R. Bogdan, &amp; Lutfiyya, Z.M. ''The Variety of Community Experience'' (pp.193-210). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes. &lt;/ref&gt; 

Two main models have been proposed to describe the link between social support and health: the buffering hypothesis and the direct effects hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=Q6xkh3QdyGEC&amp;lpg=PA426&amp;dq=%22direct%20effects%20hypothesis%22%20%22main%20effects%20hypothesis%22&amp;pg=PA426#v=onepage&amp;q=%22direct%20effects%20hypothesis%22%20%22main%20effects%20hypothesis%22&amp;f=false | title=DSM-IV Sourcebook| isbn=9780890420744| last1=Association| first1=American Psychiatric| year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gender]] and [[culture|cultural]] differences in social support have also been found &lt;ref&gt;Harry, B., Kaylanpur, M. and Day, M. (1999). ''Building Cultural Reciprocity with Families: Case Studies in Special Education.'' London, Toronto: Brookes. &lt;/ref&gt;in fields such as education "which may not control for age, disability, income and social status, ethnic and racial, or other significant factors".

===Distinctions in measurement===
Social support can be categorized and measured in several different ways.

There are four common functions of social support:&lt;ref name=Wills91&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wills|first=T.A.|title=Social support and interpersonal relationships|journal=Prosocial Behavior, Review of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1991|volume=12|pages=265–289|editor1-first=Clark|editor1-last=Margaret}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wills|first=T.A.|title=Social support and health|year=1985|publisher=Academic Press|location=Orlando, FL|pages=61–82|editor=S.

*''Emotional support'' is the offering of empathy, concern, affection, love, trust, acceptance, intimacy, encouragement, or caring.&lt;ref name=Nursing&gt;{{cite journal|last=Langford|first=C.P.H.|author2=Bowsher, J. |author3=Maloney, J.P. |author4=Lillis, P.P. |title=Social support: a conceptual analysis|journal=Journal of Advanced Nursing|year=1997|volume=25|issue=1|pages=95–100|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2648.1997.1997025095.x|pmid=9004016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Slevin 1996 1275–1279"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Slevin|first=M.L. |author2=Nichols, S.E. |author3=Downer, S.M. |author4=Wilson, P. |author5=Lister, T.A. |author6=Arnott, S. |author7=Maher, J. |author8=Souhami, R.L. |author9=Tobias, J.S. |author10=Goldstone, A.H. |author11=Cody, M.|title=Emotional support for cancer patients: what do patients really want?|journal=British Journal of Cancer|year=1996|volume=74|issue=8 |pages=1275–1279|doi=10.1038/bjc.1996.529 |pmid=8883417 |pmc=2075927}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the warmth and nurturance provided by sources of social support.&lt;ref name=SETReview&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=S.E.|title=The Handbook of Health Psychology|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|pages=189–214|editor=M.S.

*''Tangible support'' is the provision of financial assistance, material goods, or services.&lt;ref name=HealthBehav&gt;{{cite book|last=Heaney, C.A., &amp; Israel, B.A.|title=Health Behavior and Health Education: Theory, Research, and Practice|year=2008|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco, CA|edition=4th|editor=Glanz, K. |editor2=Rimer, B.K. |editor3=Viswanath, K.|chapter=Social networks and social support}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=House&gt;{{cite book|last=House|first=J.S.|title=Work stress and social support|year=1981|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also called instrumental support, this form of social support encompasses the concrete, direct ways people assist others.&lt;ref name=Nursing /&gt;
*''Informational support'' is the provision of advice, guidance, suggestions, or useful information to someone.&lt;ref name=Wills91 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krause|first=N.|title=Social support, stress, and well-being|journal=Journal of Gerontology|year=1986|volume=41|issue=4|pages=512–519|doi=10.1093/geronj/41.4.512}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of information has the potential to help others problem-solve.&lt;ref name=Nursing /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tilden|first=V.P.|author2=Weinert, S.C. |title=Social support and the chronically ill individual|journal=Nursing Clinics of North America|year=1987|volume=22|issue=3|pages=613–620}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Companionship support'' is the type of support that gives someone a sense of social belonging (and is also called belonging).&lt;ref name=Wills91 /&gt;   This can be seen as the presence of companions to engage in shared social activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Uchino|first=B.|title=Social Support and Physical Health: Understanding the Health Consequences of Relationships|year=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers also commonly make a distinction between perceived and received support.&lt;ref name=SETReview /&gt;&lt;ref name=Barrera&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barrera|first=M|title=Distinctions between social support concepts, measures, and models|journal=American Journal of Community Psychology|year=1986|volume=14|issue=4|pages=413–445|doi=10.1007/bf00922627}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Perceived support'' refers to a recipient’s subjective judgment that providers will offer (or have offered) effective help during times of need. ''Received support'' (also called enacted support) refers to specific supportive actions (e.g., advice or reassurance) offered by providers during times of need.&lt;ref name=Cultural&gt;{{cite book|last=Gurung|first=R.A.R.|title=Health Psychology: A Cultural Approach|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Wadsworth|location=Belmont, CA|pages=131–171|chapter=Coping and Social Support}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, social support can be measured in terms of structural support or functional support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wills|first=T.A.|title=Behavioral medicine and women: A comprehensive handbook|year=1998|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York, NY|pages=118–128|editor=Blechman, E.A. |editor2=Brownell, K.D.|chapter=Social support}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Structural support'' (also called ''social integration'') refers to the extent to which a recipient is connected within a social network, like the number of social ties or how integrated a person is within his or her social network.&lt;ref name=Barrera /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wills91 /&gt;  Family relationships, friends, and membership in clubs and organizations contribute to social integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lakey|first=B|title=Social support and social integration|url=http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/brp/constructs/social_support/social_support.pdf|accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Functional support'' looks at the specific functions that members in this social network can provide, such as the emotional, instrumental, informational, and companionship support listed above.&lt;ref name=UBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Uchino|first=B.|title=Social Support and Physical Health: Understanding the Health Consequences of Relationships|year=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Data suggests that emotional support may play a more significant role in protecting individuals from the deleterious effects of stress than structural means of support, such as social involvement or activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kessler|first=R. C.|author2=McLeod, J. D. |title=Sex differences in vulnerability to undesirable life events|year=1984|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=49|issue=5|pages=620–631|doi=10.2307/2095420|jstor=2095420|citeseerx=10.1.1.455.9669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These different types of social support have different patterns of correlations with [[health]], [[personality]], and [[interpersonal relationship|personal relationships]].&lt;ref name=Barrera /&gt;&lt;ref name=U2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Uchino|first=B.|title=Understanding the links between social support and physical health: A life-span perspective with emphasis on the separability of perceived and received support.|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|year=2009|volume=4|issue=3|pages=236–255|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6924.2009.01122.x|pmid=26158961|citeseerx=10.1.1.713.8624}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, perceived support is consistently linked to better mental health whereas received support and social integration are not.&lt;ref name=Barrera /&gt;&lt;ref name=U2009/&gt; In fact, research indicates that perceived social support that is untapped can be more effective and beneficial than utilized social support.&lt;ref name="Culture and Social Support: Who Seeks It and Why?"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=S.E.|last2=Sherman|first2=D.K.|last3=Kim|first3=H.S.|last4=Jarcho|first4=J.|last5=Takagi|first5=K.|last6=Dunagan|first6=M.S.|title=Culture and Social Support: Who Seeks It and Why?|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=2004|volume=87|issue=3|pages=354–362|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.87.3.354|pmid=15382985|ref=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have suggested that [[invisible support]], a form of support where the person has support without his or her awareness, may be the most beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bolger|first=N.|author2=Amarel, D. |title=Effects of social support visibility on adjustment to stress: Experimental evidence|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2007|volume=92|issue=3|pages=458–475|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.92.3.458|pmid=17352603|citeseerx=10.1.1.323.9906}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bolger 2000 953–961"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bolger|first=N.|author2=Zuckerman, A. |author3=Kessler, R.C. |title=Invisible support and adjustment to stress|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2000|volume=79|issue=6|pages=953–961|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.79.6.953|citeseerx=10.1.1.488.333}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Uchino, B. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Uchino | first1 = B | year = 2006 | title = Social support and health: A review of physiological processes potentially  underlying links to disease outcomes | url = | journal = Journal of Behavioral Medicine | volume = 29 | issue = 4| pages = 377–387 | doi=10.1007/s10865-006-9056-5| pmid = 16758315 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sources===

Social support can come from a variety of sources, including (but not limited to): family, friends, romantic partners, pets, community ties, and coworkers.&lt;ref name=SETReview /&gt; Sources of support can be natural (e.g., family and friends) or more formal (e.g., mental health specialists or community organizations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hogan, B.|author2=Linden, W. |author3=Najarian, B. |title=Social support interventions: Do they work?|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|year=2002|volume=22|issue=3|pages=381–440|doi=10.1016/s0272-7358(01)00102-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The source of the social support is an important determinant of its effectiveness as a coping strategy. Support from a romantic partner is associated with health benefits, particularly for men.&lt;ref name=KG&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kiecolt-Glaser|first=J.K.|author2=Newton, T.L. |title=Marriage and health: His and hers|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2001|volume=127|issue=4|pages=472–503|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.127.4.472|pmid=11439708}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, one study has found that although support from spouses buffered the negative effects of work stress, it did not buffer the relationship between marital and parental stresses, because the spouses were implicated in these situations.However, work-family specific support worked more to alleviate work-family stress that feeds into marital and parental stress.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1744-6570.2011.01211.x | pmid=21691415 | volume=64 | issue=2 | title=Workplace and Social Support and Work-Family Conflict: A Meta-analysis Clarifying the Influence of General and Work-Family-Specific Supervisor and Organizational Support | journal=Personnel Psychology | pages=289–313 | last1 = Ernst Kossek | first1 = Ellen |author2=Pichler, S. | pmc=3116443 | year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Employee humor is negatively associated with burnout, and positively with, stress, health and stress coping effectiveness.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"/&gt; Additionally, social support from friends did provide a buffer in response to marital stress, because they were less implicated in the marital dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jackson|first=P.

Social support is also available among [[social media]] sites. As technology advances, the availability for online support increases. Social support can be offered through social media websites such as [[blog|blogs]], [[Facebook]] groups, health forums, and online support groups. According to Hwang, the support is similar to face-to-face social support, but also offers the unique aspects of convenience, anonymity, and non-judgmental interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social support in an Internet weight loss community|journal = International Journal of Medical Informatics|date = 2010-01-01|issn = 1386-5056|pmc = 3060773|pmid = 19945338|pages = 5–13|volume = 79|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2009.10.003|first = Kevin O.|last = Hwang|first2 = Allison J.|last2 = Ottenbacher|first3 = Angela P.|last3 = Green|first4 = M.

Research conducted by Winzelberg et al. evaluated an online support group for women with breast cancer finding participants were able to form fulfilling supportive relationships in an asynchronous format and this form of support proved to be effective in reducing participants' scores on [[Depression (mood)|depression]], perceived [[Stress (biology)|stress]], and cancer-related trauma measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Evaluation of an internet support group for women with primary breast cancer|journal = Cancer|date = 2003-03-01|issn = 1097-0142|pages = 1164–1173|volume = 97|issue = 5|doi = 10.1002/cncr.11174|pmid = 12599221|first = Andrew J.|last = Winzelberg|first2 = Catherine|last2 = Classen|first3 = Georg W.|last3 = Alpers|first4 = Heidi|last4 = Roberts|first5 = Cheryl|last5 = Koopman|first6 = Robert E.|last6 = Adams|first7 = Heidemarie|last7 = Ernst|first8 = Parvati|last8 = Dev|first9 = C. Barr|last9 = Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of online communication can increase the ability to cope with stress. Social support through social media is available to everyone with internet access and allows users to create relationships and receive encouragement for whatever issue they may be facing.

Coulson claims online support groups provide a unique opportunity for health professionals to learn about the experiences and views of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social support in cyberspace: a content analysis of communication within a Huntington's disease online support group|journal = Patient Education and Counseling|date = 2007-10-01|issn = 0738-3991|pmid = 17629440|pages = 173–178|volume = 68|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/j.pec.2007.06.002|first = Neil S.|last = Coulson|first2 = Heather|last2 = Buchanan|first3 = Aimee|last3 = Aubeeluck|url = http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/721/1/Coulson_Buchanan_Aubeeluck_2007_PEC.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of social support can also benefit users by providing them with a variety of information. Seeking informational social support allows users to access suggestions, advice, and information regarding health concerns or recovery. Many need social support, and with its emergence on social media access can be obtained from a wider range of people in need. Wong and Ma (2016) have done research that shows online social support affects users' online [[subjective well-being]].

In a 2013 study, Akey et al. did a qualitative study of 34 men and women diagnosed with an eating disorder and used the [[Health Belief Model]] (HBM) to explain the reasons for which they forgo seeking social support. Many people with eating disorders have a low perceived susceptibility, which can be explained as a sense of denial about their illness. Their perceived severity of the illness is affected by those to whom they compare themselves to, often resulting in people believing their illness is not severe enough to seek support. Due to poor past experiences or educated speculation, the perception of benefits for seeking social support is relatively low. The number of perceived barriers towards seeking social support often prevents people with eating disorders from getting the support they need to better cope with their illness. Such barriers include fear of social stigma, financial resources, and availability and quality of support. Self-efficacy may also explain why people with eating disorders do not seek social support, because they may not know how to properly express their need for help. This research has helped to create a better understanding of why individuals with eating disorders do not seek social support, and may lead to increased efforts to make such support more available. Eating disorders are classified as mental illnesses but can also have physical health repercussions. Creating a strong social support system for those affected by eating disorders may help such individuals to have a higher quality of both mental and physical health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Akey, J.

Various studies have been performed examining the effects of social support on psychological distress. Interest in the implications of social support were triggered by a series of articles published in the mid-1970s, each reviewing literature examining the association between psychiatric disorders and factors such as change in marital status, geographic mobility, and social disintegration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cobb|first=S.|title=Social support as a moderator of life stress|year=1976|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|volume=98|issue=5|pages=300–314|doi=10.1097/00006842-197609000-00003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cassel|first=J.|title=Psychosocial processes and "stress":theoretical formulation|year=1974|journal=International Journal of Health Services|volume=4|issue=3|pages=471–482|doi=10.2190/wf7x-y1l0-bfkh-9qu2|pmid=4475665}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers realized that the theme present in each of these situations is the absence of adequate social support and the disruption of social networks. This observed relationship sparked numerous studies concerning the effects of social support on mental health.

One particular study documented the effects of social support as a coping strategy on psychological distress in response to stressful work and life events among police officers. Talking things over among coworkers was the most frequent form of coping utilized while on duty, whereas most police officers kept issues to themselves while off duty. The study found that the social support between co-workers significantly buffered the relationship between work-related events and distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Patterson|first= George T.|title=Examining the effects of coping and social support on work and life stress among police officers|journal=Journal of Criminal Justice|year=2003|volume=31|issue= 3|pages=215–226|doi=10.1016/s0047-2352(03)00003-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have examined the social support systems of single mothers. One study by D'Ercole demonstrated that the effects of social support vary in both form and function and will have drastically different effects depending upon the individual. The study found that supportive relationships with friends and co-workers, rather than task-related support from family, was positively related to the mother's psychological well-being. D'Ercole hypothesizes that friends of a single parent offer a chance to socialize, match experiences, and be part of a network of peers. These types of exchanges may be more spontaneous and less obligatory than those between relatives. Additionally, co-workers can provide a community away from domestic life, relief from family demands, a source of recognition, and feelings of competence. D'Ercole also found an interesting statistical interaction whereby social support from co-workers decreased the experience of stress only in lower income individuals. The author hypothesizes that single women who earn more money are more likely to hold more demanding jobs which require more formal and less dependent relationships. Additionally, those women who earn higher incomes are more likely to be in positions of power, where relationships are more competitive than supportive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=D'Ercole|first=Ann|title=Single Mothers: Stress, Coping, and Social Support|year=1988|journal=Journal of Community Psychology|volume=16|pages=41–54|doi=10.1002/1520-6629(198801)16:1&lt;41::aid-jcop2290160107&gt;3.0.co;2-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many studies have been dedicated specifically to understanding the effects of social support in individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In a study by Haden et al., when victims of severe trauma perceived high levels of social support and engaged in interpersonal coping styles, they were less likely to develop severe PTSD when compared to those who perceived lower levels of social support. These results suggest that high levels of social support alleviate the strong positive association between level of injury and severity of PTSD, and thus serves as a powerful protective factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haden|first=Sara C. |author2=Scarpa, Angela |author3=Jones, Russell T. |author4=Ollendick, Thomas H.|title=Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and injury: the moderating role of perceived social support and coping for young adults|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|year=2007|volume=42|issue=7 |pages=1187–1198|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2006.09.030}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, data shows that the support of family and friends has a positive influence on an individual's ability to cope with trauma. In fact, a meta-analysis by Brewin et al. found that social support was the strongest predictor, accounting for 40%, of variance in PTSD severity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brewin|first=C.

R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the face of such mounting stress, students naturally seek support from family and friends in order to alleviate psychological distress. A study by Chao found a significant two-way correlation between perceived stress and social support, as well as a significant three-way correlation between perceived stress, social support, and dysfunctional coping. The results indicated that high levels of dysfunctional coping deteriorated the association between stress and well-being at both high and low levels of social support, suggesting that dysfunctional coping can deteriorate the positive buffering action of social support on well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chao|first=Ruth Chu-Lien|title=Managing Perceived Stress Among College Students: The Roles of Social Support and Dysfunctional Coping|year=2012|journal=Journal of College Counseling|volume=15|issue=1|pages=5–21|doi=10.1002/j.2161-1882.2012.00002.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students who reported social support were found more likely to engage in less healthy activities, including sedentary behavior, drug and alcohol use, and too much or too little sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thorsteinsson|first= E.

===Costs===
Social support is integrated into service delivery schemes and sometimes are a primary service provided by governmental contracted entities (e.g., companionship, peer services, family caregiving). Community services known by the nomenclature community support, and workers by a similar title, Direct Support Professional, have a base in social and community support "ideology". &lt;ref&gt; Racino, J. (2000). ''Personnel Preparation in Disability and Community Life''. Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas Publishers. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Wehman, P. and Kregel, J. (1998). ''More than a Job: Securing Satisfying Careers for People with Disabilities''. London, Toronto: Paul H. Brookes. &lt;/ref&gt; All supportive services from [[supported employment]] to [[supported housing]], [[family support]], [[supported education]], and [[supportive living]] are based upon the relationship between "informal and formal" supports, and "paid and unpaid caregiving". &lt;ref&gt; Nisbet, J. and Hagner, D. (1988). Natural supports in the workplace: A reexamination of supported employment. ''JASH'', 13(4): 260-267. &lt;/ref&gt;Inclusion studies, based upon affiliation and friendship, or the conversely, have a similar theoretical basis &lt;ref&gt; Sapon-Shevin, M. (1992). Including all children and their gifts within regular classrooms. In: S. Stainback &amp; W. Stainback, ''Controversial Issues Confronting Special Education'' (pp. 69-81). London: Allyn and Bacon. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Strully, J. and Strully, C. (1985). Friendship and our children. ''JASH,'' 10(4): 224-227. &lt;/ref&gt; as do "person-centered support" strategies.

Social support theories are often found in "real life" in cultural, music and arts communities, and as might be expected within religious communities. Social support is integral in theories of aging, and the "social care systems" have often been challenged (e.g., creativity throughout the lifespan, extra retirement hours). &lt;ref&gt; Maduro, R. (1991, Spring). The 
old man as a creative artist in India. ''Generations'', XV (2):17-20. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Kunkel, S. (1989, Spring). An extra eight hours a day. ''Generations'', XIII(2): 57-60. &lt;/ref&gt; Ed Skarnulis' (state director) adage, "Support, don't supplant the family" applies to other forms of social support networks.

Although there are many benefits to social support, it is not always beneficial.  It has been proposed that in order for social support to be beneficial, the social support desired by the individual has to match the support given to him or her; this is known as the matching hypothesis.&lt;ref name = Cohen /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cut&gt;{{cite book|last=Cutrona|first=C.E|title=Russell, D.W.|year=1990|publisher=Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York|pages=319–366|editor=Sarason, B.R. |editor2=Sarason, I.G. |editor3=Pierce, G.R.|chapter=Types of social support and specific stress: Toward a theory of optimal matching}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McKay&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen, S., &amp; McKay, G.|title=Handbook of psychology and health|year=1984|publisher=Erlbaum|location=Hillsdale, NJ|pages=253–268|editor=Baum, A. |editor2=Taylor, S.E. |editor3=Singer, J.|chapter=Social support, stress, and the buffering hypothesis: A theoretical analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Psychological stress may increase if a different type of support is provided than what the recipient wishes to receive (e.g., informational is given when emotional support is sought).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horowitz|first=L.M.|author2=Krasnoperova, E.N. |author3=Tatar, D.G. |author4=Hansen, M.B. |author5=Person, E.A. |author6=Galvin, K.L. |author7=Nelson, K.L. |title=The way to console may depend on the goal: Experimental studies of social support|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2001|volume=37|pages=49–61|doi=10.1006/jesp.2000.1435}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thoit"/&gt;  Additionally, elevated levels of perceived stress can impact the effect of social support on health-related outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhou|first=Eric S.|author2=Penedo, Frank J. |author3=Lewis, John E. |title=Perceived stress mediates the effects of social support on health-related quality of life among men treated for localized prostate cancer|journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research|date=December 2010|volume=69|issue=6|pages=587–590|pmid=21109047|doi=10.1016/j.jpsychores.2010.04.019|pmc=2994072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other costs have been associated with social support. For example, received support has not been linked consistently to either physical or mental health;&lt;ref name=Barrera /&gt;&lt;ref name=U2009 /&gt; perhaps surprisingly, received support has sometimes been linked to worse mental health.&lt;ref name="Bolger 2000 953–961"/&gt;  Additionally, if social support is overly intrusive, it can increase stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shumaker|first=S.A.|author2=Hill, D.R. |title=Gender differences in social support and physical health|journal=Health Psychology|year=1991|volume=10|issue=2|pages=102–111|doi=10.1037/0278-6133.10.2.102}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important when discussing social support to always consider the possibility that the social support system is actually an antagonistic influence on an individual.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Two dominant models===
There are two dominant hypotheses addressing the link between social support and health: the buffering hypothesis and the direct effects hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt;  The main difference between these two hypotheses is that the direct effects hypothesis predicts that social support is beneficial all the time, while the buffering hypothesis predicts that social support is mostly beneficial during [[stress (psychological)|stressful times]].  Evidence has been found for both hypotheses.&lt;ref name=SETReview /&gt;

In the buffering hypothesis, social support protects (or "buffers") people from the bad effects of stressful life events (e.g., death of a spouse, job loss).&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt;  Evidence for stress buffering is found when the [[correlation]] between stressful events and poor health is weaker for people with high social support than for people with low social support.  The weak correlation between stress and health for people with high social support is often interpreted to mean that social support has protected people from stress. Stress buffering is more likely to be observed for perceived support than for social integration&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt; or received support.&lt;ref name=Barrera /&gt; The theoretical concept or construct of resiliency is associated with coping theories. 

In the direct effects (also called main effects) hypothesis, people with high social support are in better health than people with low social support, regardless of stress.&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt; In addition to showing buffering effects, perceived support also shows consistent direct effects for mental health outcomes.&lt;ref name="Lakey, B., &amp; Cronin, A. 2008 385–408"/&gt; Both perceived support and social integration show main effects for physical health outcomes.&lt;ref name=U2009 /&gt;  However, received (enacted) support rarely shows main effects.&lt;ref name=Barrera /&gt;&lt;ref name=U2009 /&gt;

===Theories to explain the links===

Several theories have been proposed to explain social support’s link to health. Stress and coping social support theory&lt;ref name=Barrera /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt;&lt;ref name = Cut/&gt;&lt;ref name =Thoit&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thoits|first=P.A.|title=Social support as coping assistance|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|year=1986|volume=54|issue=4|pages=416–423|doi=10.1037/0022-006x.54.4.416}}&lt;/ref&gt; dominates social support research&lt;ref name=RRT&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lakey|first=B.|author2=Orehek, E. |title=Relational Regulation Theory: A new approach to explain the link between perceived support and mental health|journal=Psychological Review|year=2011|volume=118|issue=3|pages=482–495|doi=10.1037/a0023477|pmid=21534704}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is designed to explain the buffering hypothesis described above. According to this theory, social support protects people from the bad health effects of stressful events (i.e., stress buffering) by influencing how people think about and [[coping (psychology)|cope]] with the events. An example in 2018 are the effects of school shootings on the well being and future of children and children's health. According to stress and coping theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lazarus, R.S., &amp; Folkman, S.|title=Stress, appraisal, and coping|year=1984|publisher=Springer|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; events are stressful insofar as people have negative thoughts about the event ([[appraisal theory|appraisal]]) and cope ineffectively. Coping consists of deliberate, conscious actions such as problem solving or relaxation. As applied to social support, stress and coping theory suggests that social support promotes [[adaptation|adaptive]] appraisal and coping.&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt;&lt;ref name = Thoit /&gt; Evidence for stress and coping social support theory is found in studies that observe stress buffering effects for perceived social support.&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt; One problem with this theory is that, as described previously, stress buffering is not seen for social integration,&lt;ref name=T95&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thoits|first=P.A.|title=Stress, coping, and social support processes: Where are we? What next?|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior|year=1995|volume=35|pages=53–79|doi=10.2307/2626957|jstor=2626957}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that received support is typically not linked to better health outcomes.&lt;ref name=Barrera /&gt;&lt;ref name=U2009 /&gt;

Relational regulation theory (RRT)&lt;ref name=RRT /&gt; is another theory, which is designed to explain main effects (the direct effects hypothesis) between perceived support and mental health. As mentioned previously, perceived support has been found to have both buffering and direct effects on mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wethington|first=E.|author2=Kessler, R.C. |title=Perceived support, received support, and adjustment to stressful life events|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior|year=1986|volume=27|issue=1|pages=78–89|doi=10.2307/2136504|pmid=3711634|jstor=2136504}}&lt;/ref&gt;  RRT was proposed in order to explain perceived support’s main effects on mental health which cannot be explained by the stress and coping theory.&lt;ref name=RRT /&gt;  RRT hypothesizes that the link between perceived support and mental health comes from people [[Emotional self-regulation|regulating their emotions]] through ordinary conversations and shared activities rather than through conversations on how to cope with stress. This regulation is relational in that the support providers, conversation topics and activities that help regulate emotion are primarily a matter of personal taste. This is supported by previous work showing that the largest part of perceived support is relational in nature.&lt;ref name=L2010&gt;{{cite book|last=Lakey|first=B.|title=Social Psychological Foundations of Clinical Psychology|year=2010|publisher=Guildford|location=New York|pages=177–194|editor=Maddux, J.E. |editor2=Tangney, J.P.|chapter=Social support: Basic research and new strategies for intervention}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life-span theory&lt;ref name=U2009 /&gt; is another theory to explain the links of social support and health, which emphasizes the differences between perceived and received support. According to this theory, social support develops throughout the life span, but especially in childhood [[attachment theory|attachment]] with parents.  Social support develops along with adaptive [[Trait theory|personality traits]] such as low hostility, low neuroticism, high optimism, as well as social and coping skills.  Together, support and other aspects of personality ("psychological theories") influence health largely by promoting health practices (e.g., exercise and weight management) and by preventing health-related stressors (e.g., job loss, divorce).  Evidence for life-span theory includes that a portion of perceived support is trait-like,&lt;ref name = L2010 /&gt; and that perceived support is linked to adaptive personality characteristics and attachment experiences.&lt;ref name=U2009 /&gt; Lifespan theories are popular from their origins in Schools of Human Ecology at the universities, aligned with family theories, and researched through federal centers over decades (e.g., University of Kansas, Beach Center for Families; Cornell University, School of Human Ecology).  

Of [[The Big Five personality traits|the Big Five Personality Traits]], agreeableness is associated with people receiving the most social support and having the least-strained relationships at work and home.  Receiving support from a supervisor in the workplace is associated with alleviating tensions both at work and at home, as are interdependency and idiocentrism of an employee.&lt;ref name="The effects of allocentrism, idiocentrism, social support, and big five personality dimensions on work-family conflict."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shafiro|first1=M.|title=The effects of allocentrism, idiocentrism, social support, and big five personality dimensions on work-family conflict.|journal=Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering|date=2011|volume=66|issue=3|pages=191–203|doi=10.1016/j.jvb.2010.12.010|ref=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological pathways===
Many studies have tried to identify [[biopsychosocial model|biopsychosocial]] pathways for the link between social support and health. Social support has been found to positively impact the [[immune system|immune]], [[neuroendocrine system|neuroendocrine]], and [[cardiovascular system]]s.&lt;ref name=T07&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=S.E.|title=Foundations of health psychology|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=145–171|editor=Friedman, H.S. |editor2=Silver, R.C.|chapter=Social support}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these systems are listed separately here, evidence has shown that these systems can interact and affect each other.&lt;ref name=U2009 /&gt;

*Immune system: Social support is generally associated with better immune function.&lt;ref name=U2006 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herbert|first=T.B.|author2=Cohen, S. |title=Stress and immunity in humans: A meta-analytic review|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|year=1993|pages=364–379|doi=10.1097/00006842-199307000-00004|volume=55|issue=4|citeseerx=10.1.1.125.6544}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, being more socially integrated is correlated with lower levels of inflammation (as measured by [[C-reactive protein]], a marker of inflammation),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loucks|first=E.B.|author2=Berkman, L.F. |author3=Gruenewald, T.L. |author4=Seeman, T.E. |title=Relation of social integration to inflammatory marker concentrations in men and women 70-79 years|journal=American Journal of Cardiology|year=2006|volume=97|issue=7|pages=1010–1016|doi=10.1016/j.amjcard.2005.10.043|pmid=16563907}}&lt;/ref&gt; and people with more social support have a lower susceptibility to the common cold.&lt;ref name=C97 /&gt;
*Neuroendocrine system: Social support has been linked to lower [[cortisol]] ("stress hormone") levels in response to stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turner-Cobb|first=J.M.|author2=Sephton, S.E. |author3=Koopman, C. |author4=Blake-Mortimer, J. |author5=Spiegel, D. |title=Social support and salivary cortisol in women with metastatic breast cancer|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|year=2000|volume=62|pages=337–345}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Neuroimaging]] work has found that social support decreases activation of regions in the brain associated with social distress, and that this diminished activity was also related to lowered cortisol levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eisenberger|first=N.I.|author2=Taylor, S.E. |author3=Gable, S.L. |author4=Hilmert, C.J. |author5=Lieberman, M.D. |title=Neural pathways link social support to attenuated neuroendocrine stress response|journal=NeuroImage|year=2007|volume=35|issue=4|pages=1601–1612|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.01.038 |pmid=17395493 |pmc=2710966}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cardiovascular system: Social support has been found to lower cardiovascular reactivity to stressors.&lt;ref name=U2006 /&gt; It has been found to lower [[blood pressure]] and [[heart rate]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Unden|first=A.L.|author2=Orth-Gomer, K. |author3=Elofsson, S. |title=Cardiovascular effects of social support in the work place: twenty-four hour ECG monitoring of men and women|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|year=1991|volume=53|issue=1|pages=50–60|pmid=2011650}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are known to benefit the cardiovascular system.

Though many benefits have been found, not all research indicates positive effects of social support on these systems.&lt;ref name=SETReview /&gt; For example, sometimes the presence of a support figure can lead to increased neuroendocrine and [[physiological]] activity.&lt;ref name=KG /&gt;

Social support groups can be a source of informational support, by providing valuable educational information, and emotional support, including encouragement from people experiencing similar circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Helgeson|first=V.S.|author2=Cohen, S. |title=Social support and adjustment to cancer: Reconciling descriptive, correlational, and intervention research|journal=Health Psychology|year=1996|volume=15|issue=2|pages=135–148|doi=10.1037/0278-6133.15.2.135|citeseerx=10.1.1.559.9698}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gottlieb, B.H.|title=Marshalling social support: Formats, processes, and effects|year=1988|publisher=Sage|location=Newbury Park, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies have generally found beneficial effects for social support group interventions for various conditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hogan|first=B.E.|author2=Najarian, B. |title=Social support interventions: Do they work?|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|year=2002|volume=22|issue=3|pages=381–440|doi=10.1016/s0272-7358(01)00102-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Internet support groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hazzard|first=A.|author2=Celano, M. |author3=Collins, M. |author4=Markov, Y. |title=Effects of STARBRIGHT World on knowledge, social support, and coping in hospitalized children with sickle cell disease and asthma|journal=Children's Health Care|year=2002|volume=31|pages=69–86|doi=10.1207/s15326888chc3101_5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups may be termed "self help" groups in nation-states, may be offered by non-profit organizations, and in 2018, may be paid for as part of governmental reimbursement schemes.

===Providing support===
There are both costs and benefits to providing support to others. Providing [[long-term care]] or support for someone else is a chronic stressor that has been associated with anxiety, depression, alterations in the immune system, and increased mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schulz|first=R.|author2=O'Brien, A.T. |author3=Bookwala, J. |author4=Fleissner, K. |title=Psychiatric and physical morbidity effects of dementia caregiving: Prevalence, correlates, and causes|journal=The Gerontologist|year=1995|volume=35|pages=771–791|doi=10.1093/geront/35.6.771 |pmid=8557205 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kiecolt-Glaser|first=J.K.|author2=Marucha, P.T. |author3=Malarkey, W.B. |author4=Mercado, A.M. |author5=Glaser, R. |title=Slowing of wound healing by psychological stress|journal=Lancet|year=1995|volume=346|issue=8984|pages=1194–1196|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(95)92899-5 |pmid=7475659}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, family caregivers and "university personnel" alike have advocated for both respite or relief, and higher payments related to ongoing, long-term caregiving. However, providing support has also been associated with health benefits. In fact, providing instrumental support to friends, relatives, and neighbors, or emotional support to spouses has been linked to a significant decrease in the risk for mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=S.L.|author2=Nesse, R.M. |author3=Vinokur, A.D. |author4=Smith, D.M. |title=Providing social support may be more beneficial than receiving it: Results from a prospective study of mortality|journal=Psychological Science|year=2003|volume=14|issue=4|pages=320–327|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.14461|pmid=12807404}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, a recent neuroimaging study found that giving support to a significant other during a distressful experience increased activation in [[reward system|reward]] areas of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Inagaki|first=T.K.|author2=Eisenberger, N.I. |title=Neural correlates of giving support to a loved one|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|year=2011|volume=epub ahead of print|issue=1|doi=10.1097/psy.0b013e3182359335|pmid=22071630|pages=3–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social defence system===
In 1959 [[Isabel Menzies Lyth]] identified that threat to a person’s identity in a group where they share similar characteristics develops a defence system inside the group which stems from emotions experienced by members of the group, which are difficult to articulate, cope with and finds solutions to. Together with an external pressure on efficiency a collusive and injunctive system develops that is resistant to change, supports their activities and prohibit others from performing their major tasks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.moderntimesworkplace.com/archives/ericsess/sessvol1/Lythp439.opd.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesscoachinstitute.com/library/key_concepts.shtml|title=Key Concepts in Interpersonal Psychology|author=|date=|website=www.businesscoachinstitute.com|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender and culture==

===Gender differences===
Gender differences have been found in social support research.&lt;ref name=Cultural /&gt;  Women provide more social support to others and are more engaged in their social networks.&lt;ref name=T95 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Belle|first=D.|title=Gender and stress|year=1987|publisher=The Free Press|location=New York|editor=Barnett, R.C. |editor2=Biener, L. |editor3=Baruch, G.K.|pages=257–277|chapter=Gender differences in the social moderators of stress}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tend&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=S.E.|author2=Klein, L.C. |author3=Lewis, B.P |author4=Gruenewald, T.L. |author5=Gurung, R.A.R. |author6=Updegraff, J.A. |title=Biobehavioral responses to stress in females: Tend-and-befriend, not fight-or-flight|journal=Psychological Review|year=2000|volume=107|pages=411–429|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.107.3.411|pmid=10941275 |issue=3|citeseerx=10.1.1.386.912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence has also supported the notion that women may be better providers of social support.&lt;ref name=T95 /&gt;  In addition to being more involved in the giving of support, women are also more likely to seek out social support to deal with stress, especially from their spouses.  However, one study indicates that there are no differences in the extent to which men and women seek appraisal, informational, and instrumental types of support.  Rather, the big difference lies in seeking emotional support.&lt;ref name="Gender Differences In Perceptions Of Stressors And Utilization Of Social Support Among University Students"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Day|first1=A.|last2=Livingtone1|first2=H.|title=Gender Differences In Perceptions Of Stressors And Utilization Of Social Support Among University Students|journal=Canadian Journal of Behavioural Science|date=2003|volume=35|issue=2|pages=73–83|ref=109|doi=10.1037/h0087190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tamres|first=L.|author2=Janicki, D. |author3=Helgeson, V.S. |title=Sex differences in coping behavior: A meta-analytic review|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|year=2002|volume=6|pages=2–30|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0601_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, social support may be more beneficial to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwarzer|first=R.|author2=Leppin, A. |title=Social support and health: A meta-analysis|journal=Psychology and Health|year=1989|volume=3|pages=1–15|doi=10.1080/08870448908400361}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Shelley Taylor]] and her colleagues have suggested that these gender differences in social support may stem from the biological difference between men and women in how they respond to stress (i.e., [[flight or fight response|flight or fight]] versus [[tend and befriend]]).&lt;ref name=Tend /&gt;  Married men are less likely to be depressed compared to non-married men after the presence of a particular stressor because men are able to delegate their emotional burdens to their partner, and women have been shown to be influenced and act more in reaction to social context compared to men.&lt;ref name="Hobfoll"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hobfoll | first1 = S.E. | last2 = Cameron | first2 = R.P. | last3 = Chapman | first3 = H.A. | last4 = Gallagher | first4 = R.W. | year = 1996 | title = Social support and social coping in couples | url = | journal = Handbook of Social Support and the Family | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 413–433 | doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-1388-3_17| isbn = 978-1-4899-1390-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   It has been found that men’s behaviors are overall more antisocial, with less regard to the impact their coping may have upon others, and women more prosocial-active with importance stressed on how their coping affects people around them.&lt;ref&gt;Malek, M.J. (2000). Coping profiles within the strategic approach to coping ccale and their relationship to physical and psychological well-being. Kent State University, 1-151.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roussi | first1 = P. | last2 = Vassilaki | first2 = E. | year = 2000 | title = The applicability of the multiaxial model of coping to a greek population | url = | journal = Anxiety, Stress, &amp; Coping | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 125–147 | doi=10.1080/10615800108248351}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may explain why women are more likely to experience negative psychological problems such as depression and anxiety based on how women receive and process stressors.&lt;ref name="Hobfoll" /&gt;  In general, women are likely to find situations more stressful than males are. It is important to note that when the perceived stress level is the same, men and women have much fewer differences in how they seek and use social support.&lt;ref name="Gender Differences In Perceptions Of Stressors And Utilization Of Social Support Among University Students"/&gt;

===Cultural differences===

Although social support is thought to be a universal resource, cultural differences exist in social support.&lt;ref name=Cultural /&gt; In many Asian cultures, the person is seen as more of a collective unit of society, whereas Western cultures are more individualistic and conceptualize social support as a transaction in which one person seeks help from another.  In more interdependent Eastern cultures, people are less inclined to enlist the help of others.&lt;ref name="Culture and Social Support: Who Seeks It and Why?"/&gt;  For example, [[European Americans]] have been found to call upon their social relationships for social support more often than [[Asian Americans]] or Asians during stressful occasions,&lt;ref name=S04&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=S.E.|author2=Sherman, D.K. |author3=Kim, H.S. |author4=Jarcho, J. |author5=Takagi, K. |author6=Dunagan, M.S. |title=Culture and social support: Who seeks it and why?|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2004|volume=87|issue=3|pages=354–62|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.87.3.354 |pmid=15382985}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Asian Americans expect social support to be less helpful than European Americans.&lt;ref name=S06&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=H.S.|author2=Sherman, D.K. |author3=Ko, D. |author4=Taylor, S.E |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=2006|volume=32|issue=12|pages=1596–1607|doi=10.1177/0146167206291991 |pmid=17122173|title=Pursuit of Comfort and Pursuit of Harmony: Culture, Relationships, and Social Support Seeking|citeseerx=10.1.1.584.9979}}&lt;/ref&gt; These differences in social support may be rooted in different cultural ideas about [[social groups]].&lt;ref name=S04 /&gt;&lt;ref name=S06/&gt;  It is important to note that these differences are stronger in emotional support than instrumental support.&lt;ref name="Culture and Social Support: Who Seeks It and Why?"/&gt;  Additionally, ethnic differences in social support from family and friends have been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sagrestano|first=L.M.|author2=Feldman, P. |author3=Killingsworth-Rini, C. |author4=Woo, G. |author5=Dunkel-Schetter, C |title=Ethnicity and social support during pregnancy|journal=American Journal of Community Psychology|year=1999|volume=27|issue=6|pages=873–902 |doi=10.1023/a:1022266726892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural differences in coping strategies other than social support also exist.  One study shows that Koreans are more likely to report substance abuse than European Americans are.  Further, European Americans are more likely to exercise in order to cope than Koreans. Some cultural explanations are that Asians are less likely to seek it from fear of disrupting the harmony of their relationships and that they are more inclined to settle their problems independently and avoid criticism.  However, these differences are not found among Asian Americans relative to their Europeans American counterparts.&lt;ref name="Culture and Social Support: Who Seeks It and Why?"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7166">A '''story arc''' (also '''narrative arc''')&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-narrative-arc-in-literature-852484 "Narrative Arc – What is Narrative Arc in Literature?"]. ThoughtCo.&lt;/ref&gt; is an extended or continuing [[narrative|storyline]] in [[episode|episodic]] storytelling media such as [[television]], [[comic book]]s, [[comic strip]]s, [[boardgames]], [[video game]]s, and [[films]] with each episode following a [[dramatic arc]]. On a [[television program]], for example, the story would unfold over many episodes. In television, the use of the story arc is much more common in [[comedy|comedies]], especially in [[soap opera]]s. In a traditional Hollywood film, the story arc usually follows a three-act format.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, Lew, "Lew Hunter's Screenwriting 434: The Industry's Premier Teacher Reveals the Secrets of the Successful Screenplay", Peregee Books, a division of Penguin, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[Webcomic]]s are more likely to use story arcs than [[comic strip|newspaper comics]], as most web comics have readable archives online that a newcomer to the strip can read in order to understand what is going on. Although story arcs have existed for decades, the term "story arc" was coined in 1988 in relation to the television series ''[[Wiseguy]]'',{{clarification needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Boulware, Hugh (September 18, 1988). [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-09-18/entertainment/8802010198_1_wiseguy-ken-wahl-sonny-steelgrave "Hollywood Not Ken Wahl's Kind Of Town"]. ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and was quickly adapted for other uses.

Many American comic book series are now written in four or six-issue arcs, within a continuing series. Short story arcs are easier to package as [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]s for resale, and more accessible to the casual reader than the never-ending [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] that once characterised US comics.
A corollary to the absence of continuity, however, is that, as exemplified in 1950s DC ''Superman'' comics, no permanent change to characters or situations occurs, meaning no growth can take place; thus storylines repeat over time in an endless loop.

==Dramatic structure and purpose==
The purpose of a story arc is to move a character or a situation from one state to another; in other words, to [[Peripeteia|effect change]]. This change or transformation often takes the form of either a [[tragedy|tragic]] fall from grace or a reversal of that pattern. One common form in which this reversal is found is a character going from a situation of weakness to one of strength. For example, a poor woman goes on adventures and in the end makes a fortune for herself, or a lonely man falls in love and marries.

Another form of storytelling that offers a change or transformation of [[Character arc|character]] is that of "hero's journey," as laid out in [[Joseph Campbell]]'s theory of the [[monomyth]] in his work, ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''. [[Christopher Vogler]]'s ''[[The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers]]'' details the same theory specifically for western storytelling.

Story arcs in contemporary drama often follow the pattern of bringing a character to a low point, removing the structures the character depends upon, and then forcing the character to find new strength without those structures. In a story arc, the character undergoes substantial growth or change, which culminates in the [[denouement]] in the last third or quarter of a story.

==In television and radio==
{{See also|Serial (radio and television)}}
Story arcs on television (and also on radio) have existed for decades (one notable (albeit, unusual) example, from the so-called "Golden Age of Radio", being the 1946 [[NBC Red Network|NBC Radio]] Summer-run docudrama serial, ''The Fifth Horseman'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/The_Fifth_Horseman|title=The Fifth Horseman|publisher=|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; which (in part) featured a four-episode arc regarding a hypothetical chain of events (spanning nearly two full "future" decades) surrounding a fictitious [[nuclear holocaust]]), and are common in many countries where multi-episode storylines are the norm (an example being the UK's ''[[Doctor Who]]''), as well as most [[anime]] series.

Many arc-based series in past decades, such as ''[[V (1984 TV series)|V]]'', were often short-lived and found it difficult to attract new viewers; they also rarely appear in traditional [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] (one notable example being the science fiction "novel for television" ''[[Babylon 5]]''). However, the rise of [[DVD]] retail and [[Digital video recorder|DVR]] of television series has worked in arc-based productions' favor as the standard season collection format allows the viewer to have easy access to the relevant episodes. One area of television where story arcs have always thrived, however, is in the realm of the soap opera, and often episodic series have been derisively referred to as "soap operas" when they have adopted story arcs.

Arc-based series draw and reward dedicated viewers, and fans of a particular show follow and discuss different story arcs independently from particular episodes. Story arcs are sometimes split into subarcs, if deemed significant by fans, making it easy to refer to certain episodes if their production order titles are unknown. Episodes not relevant to story arcs (such as "monsters of the week") are sometimes dismissed as [[filler (media)|filler]] by fans, but might be referred to as self-contained or stand-alone episodes by producers.

===Usage in manga and anime===
[[Manga]] and anime are usually good examples of arc-based stories, to the point that most series shorter than twenty-six chapters are a single arc spanning all the chapters. This makes syndication difficult, as episodes watched in isolation often confuse viewers unless watched in conjunction with the series as a whole. Series of thirty chapters or longer usually have multiple arcs.

''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion (TV)|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', for example, is a single story arc spanning twenty-six episodes. Other longer anime have multiple story arcs, such as ''[[Bleach (manga)|Bleach]]'', ''[[Higurashi When They Cry|Higurashi no Naku Koro ni]]'', ''[[One Piece]]'', ''[[Naruto]]'', ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' and ''[[Fairy Tail]]''. The anime ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' adapts four different story arcs from the ''Dragon Ball'' manga, each with its own ultimate antagonist, along with original story arcs created for the TV series.

{{Maya civilization}}

'''Tazumal''' ({{IPA|/täsuːˈm äl/}}) is a [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization|Maya]] archeological site in [[Chalchuapa]], [[El Salvador]]. Tazumal is an [[Maya architecture|architectural]] complex within the larger area of the ancient [[Mesoamerica]]n city of Chalchuapa, in western El Salvador. The Tazumal group is located in the southern portion of the Chalchuapa archaeological zone.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p193"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologist [[Stanley Boggs]] excavated and restored the Tazumal complex during the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 193. Kato et al 2006, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological investigations indicate that Tazumal was inhabited from the Classic period through to the Postclassic and that the site had links as far afield as central Mexico, the northern Yucatán Peninsula and lower Central America. [[Metallurgy in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica|Metal artifacts]] from the complex date to the 8th century AD and are among the earliest metal artifacts reported from Mesoamerica.

==Location==
Tazumal is situated within the municipality of Chalchuapa in the department of [[Santa Ana Department|Santa Ana]],&lt;ref name="Kato&amp;c06p211"&gt;Kato et al 2006, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; within the [[Paz River|Río Paz]] drainage basin.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p193"/&gt; The ruins are at an altitude of {{convert|720|m|ft}} [[Height above mean sea level|above mean sea level]].&lt;ref name="Ito&amp;Shibata07p872"&gt;Ito and Shibata 2007, p. 872.&lt;/ref&gt; It is about {{convert|120|km|mi}} from the contemporary Maya city of [[Kaminaljuyu]].&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p193"/&gt; Tazumal is {{convert|4|km|mi}} southwest of the small Late Classic site of Alumulunga.&lt;ref&gt;Cobos 1994, 1998, pp. 28-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Chalchuapa was inhabited since the Preclassic period, when massive construction activity took place. Around the boundary between the end of the Late Preclassic and the start of the Early Classic, construction at Tazumal was interrupted by the eruption of the [[Lake Ilopango|Ilopango]] volcano, some {{convert|75|km|mi}} to the east of the city. This eruption caused a hiatus in construction activity at Tazumal that may have lasted several generations. Activity resumed during the Early to Middle Classic (c. AD 250-650) although the city never fully recovered to its Preclassic levels of activity. The Tazumal complex came closest to matching the enormous structures of the Preclassic period.&lt;ref name="Sharer74p172"&gt;Sharer 1974, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal structures of the Tazumal group date to the Classic period (c. AD 250-900) of [[Mesoamerican chronology]]. By the Late Classic (c. AD 600&amp;ndash;900) Tazumal was an important ceremonial complex.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p193"/&gt; Construction activity is evident from the Early Classic through to the Middle Classic (c. AD 400&amp;ndash;600).&lt;ref&gt;Cobos 1994, 1998, pp. 63-64.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time Tazumal had important links with the [[Maya city]] of [[Kaminaljuyu]] in the Valley of Guatemala, which acted to extend the influence of the powerful central Mexican city of [[Teotihuacan]] into the Pacific coastal areas of Guatemala and El Salvador.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 1996, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Late Classic Tazumal had links with [[Copán]] in [[Honduras]], as evidenced by architecture, sculpture and ceramics at Tazumal.&lt;ref&gt;Sheets 2000, p. 485.&lt;/ref&gt; The ceramic sequence at Tazumal continues uninterrupted from the Classic period through to approximately AD 1200.&lt;ref&gt;Cobos 1994, 1998, pp. 75, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Early Classic features indicate links with [[Chichen Itza]], in the northern [[Yucatán Peninsula]], or with [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]] in central Mexico.&lt;ref name="Cobos94-98p80"/&gt;

The population of Tazumal coexisted with the [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]]-speaking [[Pipil people|Pipils]] from the Classic through to the Early Postclassic until at least AD 1200.&lt;ref&gt;Cobos 1994, 1998, pp. 81-82. Sharer 1974, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pipil influence may have been due to trade with neighbouring Pipil populations rather than a direct Pipil presence, judging by the level of evidence.&lt;ref name="Sharer74p173"/&gt;

After 1200, Tazumal was largely abandoned, with occupation shifting westwards towards the centre of what is now the modern town of Chalchuapa.&lt;ref name="Sharer74p173"/&gt; Chalchuapa was still occupied at the time of the [[El Salvador#Conquest of Cuzcatlán|Spanish conquest]], at which time its inhabitants were [[Poqomam people|Poqomam Maya]].&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p193"/&gt; The Pokomam are believed to have been relatively late settlers in Chalchuapa, postdating the Pipil influence that lasted until 1200.&lt;ref name="Sharer74p173"/&gt;

Between 1942 and 1944 Stanley Boggs excavated and restored structures B1-1 and B1-2.&lt;ref&gt;Cobos 1994, 1998, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; This restoration included coating the structures with modern cement, which Boggs judged to be sufficiently similar to their original appearance as to justify its use.&lt;ref name="Kato&amp;c06p221"/&gt; Boggs' final report was not made generally available and no further archaeological investigations were carried out until the early 21st century.&lt;ref name="Kato&amp;c06p212"/&gt; In 1947 Tazumal was declared a National Historic Monument. Until 2001, the Salvadoran 100 [[Salvadoran colón|colón]] note carried an illustration of the ruins of Tazumal. In 2004,  the side of Structure B1-2 collapsed and the Salvadoran ''Consejo Nacional para la Cultura y el Arte'' (CONCULTURA - National Council for Culture and Art) initiated operations to excavate and stabilise the ruins.&lt;ref name="Kato&amp;c06p211"/&gt; During the first decade of the 21st century, two simultaneous archaeological projects were initiated, the investigation of Structure B1-2 by CONCULTURA and the Proyecto Arqueológico de El Salvador (PAES) by the Japanese [[Nagoya University|University of Nagoya]].&lt;ref name="Ito&amp;Shibata07p868"&gt;Ito and Shibata 2007, p. 868.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site description==
All the buildings in the Tazumal complex face west.&lt;ref name="Kato&amp;c06p220"/&gt; Tazumal is believed to possess a [[Mesoamerican ballcourt]];&lt;ref&gt;Parsons 1991, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; this is based upon the external appearance of two unexcavated mounds that are situated in the northwestern portion of the site, within a 20th-century cemetery. One of the mounds is badly damaged.&lt;ref name="Kato&amp;c06p212"&gt;Kato et al 2006, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; Green [[obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]]  artefacts found at Tazumal indicate links with central Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Cobos 1994, 1998, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure B1-1===
[[File:ES Tazumal 06 2011 2229.jpg|thumb|right|View towards the main pyramid B1-1, with Structure B1-2 on the right hand side]]
Structure B1-1 is the principal structure in the Tazumal group and dominates the complex. The pyramid underwent various phases of construction through the Classic and Early Postclassic periods.&lt;ref name="Sharer74p172"/&gt; Structure B1-1 was built upon a basal platform, called the Great Platform by Boggs, that measures {{convert|73|by|87|m|ft}} (east-west by north-south).&lt;ref name="Kato&amp;c06p220"&gt;Kato et al 2006, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; The pyramid was surveyed in 2003&amp;ndash;2004. A {{convert|30|m|ft}} long platform runs north-south along the western facade of the pyramid and a platform of similar length runs east-west along the north side of the structure.&lt;ref name="Kato&amp;c06p218"/&gt; These two side platforms were originally built as separate structures but were later incorporated into the Great Platform; it is presumed by investigators that the temple was radially symmetrical and that further platforms existed on the east and south sides. The remains of a platform measuring {{convert|4|by|3|m|ft}} were found in roughly the correct position for such a platform on the east side.&lt;ref name="Kato&amp;c06p220"/&gt; A test pit sunk into the presumed area of the southern platform uncovered an offering containing a cylindrical ceramic vessel with a polychrome bowl placed upon it like a lid. Within the vessel were two larger pieces of [[Jade use in Mesoamerica|jade]] and 50 smaller jade fragments, a fragment of seashell and a fragment of snail shell, various pieces of animal bone, [[mica]] and traces of red pigment. The offering was covered with a slab of stone. The cylindrical vessel was decorated with two panels, each containing a personage wearing a headdress and performing autosacrifice.&lt;ref name="Ito&amp;Shibata07p880"&gt;Ito and Shibata 2007, p. 880.&lt;/ref&gt;

Structure B1-1 is believed to have developed from a central temple and platforms on each side in the cardinal directions, with the west platforms serving as the main approach.&lt;ref name="Kato&amp;c06p220"/&gt; As the complex developed, the space between the platforms was filled to form the Great Platform, the earliest version of which measured {{convert|65|by|74|m|ft}}. The main pyramid B1-1 was then built upon the Great Platform, behind the western platform and covering the original central temple. The Great Platform was remodelled at least three times before it reached its final dimensions.&lt;ref name="Kato&amp;c06p221"&gt;Kato et al 2006, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Temple of the Columns====
The western platform of Structure B1-1 supports a superstructure, which has been called the Temple of the Columns.&lt;ref&gt;Kato et al 2006, p. 218. Kelly 1996, p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the westward orientation of all the structures at Tazumal, the Temple of the Columns standing on the west side of the main pyramid may have served as its main facade. This structure had square columns and two identically sized chambers, separated by a space with two columns. The northern chamber had an entrance on the east side, with a possible additional entrance on the south side.&lt;ref name="Kato&amp;c06p220"/&gt;

===Structure B1-2===
Structure B1-2 dates to the Late Classic.&lt;ref name="Cobos94-98p74"/&gt; It is located to the southwest of the main pyramid B1-1.&lt;ref name="Kato&amp;c06p213"&gt;Kato et al 2006, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a west-facing pyramid with three stepped levels standing upon a low basal platform.&lt;ref name="Kato&amp;c06p213"/&gt; It was built using the ''[[talud-tablero]]'' style of architecture;&lt;ref name="Cobos94-98p74"&gt;Cobos 1994, 1998, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; the pyramid measures {{convert|25|by|25|m|ft}} and stands approximately {{convert|6.8|m|ft}} tall. In October 2004 the south side of the pyramid collapsed; this is believed to have been caused by a combination of damage caused by the roots of nearby trees and water damage. The restoration of the pyramid with cement in the 1950s had converted the structure into a water trap, while cedar roots had penetrated the building to a height of {{convert|6|m|ft}} causing significant cracking.&lt;ref name="Kato&amp;c06p213"/&gt;

Structure B1-2 underwent four phases of construction.&lt;ref&gt;Kato et al 2006, pp. 214-217.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest phase had a total height of {{convert|4.7|m|ft}}; the lowest level measured {{convert|1.1|m|ft}} high while the middle and upper levels both measured {{convert|1.8|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref&gt;Kato et al 2006, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; This first phase was completely covered by the second phase of construction, executed in three sub-phases (labelled 2A, 2B and 2C).&lt;ref&gt;Kato et al 2006, pp. 215-216.&lt;/ref&gt; This was built in a style very similar to that of the first phase, first with the extension of the lower two levels while still using the earlier top level; a new third level was added later, completely covering the previous version. The lower two levels were first raised to {{convert|1.5|m|ft}} high; the middle level was then raised an additional {{convert|0.6|m|ft}} and the upper level was increased to {{convert|2|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref name="Kato&amp;c06p215"&gt;Kato et al 2006, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, a fourth level was added to the pyramid, bringing its total height to {{convert|6.5|m|ft}}. During the third phase of construction, the structure was increased from four to five levels. The levels varied in height between them, measuring {{convert|1.2|m|ft}}, {{convert|1|m|ft}}, {{convert|1.4|m|ft}}, {{convert|0.7|m|ft}} and {{convert|1.4|m|ft}} respectively.&lt;ref name="Kato&amp;c06p216"&gt;Kato et al 2006, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth and final construction phase was badly damaged by the collapse of the structure in 2004.&lt;ref name="Kato&amp;c06p217"&gt;Kato et al 2006, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other structures===
'''Structure B1-3''' and '''Structure B1-4''' are the two structures that comprise the ballcourt.&lt;ref&gt;Ito and Shibata 2008, p. 461.&lt;/ref&gt; Test pits excavated during the first decade of the 21st century found the mortar floor of an I-shaped ballcourt.&lt;ref&gt;Kato et al 2006, p. 218. Ito and Shibata 2008, p. 461.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structure B1-8''' is a circular platform dating to the Late Classic period.&lt;ref name="Cobos94-98p74"/&gt;

==Sculpture==
[[File:ES Tazumal 06 2011 Xipe Totec 2292.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Sculpture in the Tazumal site museum representing the god Xipe Totec]]
Sculpture at the site dates as far back as the Preclassic period.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons 1991, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; Two Terminal Classic to Early Postclassic [[chacmool]] sculptures were recovered from Tazumal, as well as a jaguar effigy sculpture and an anthropomorphic sculpture depicting the central Mexican deity [[Xipe Totec]].&lt;ref&gt;Cobos 1994, 1998, pp. 74-75, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; These artefacts are stylistically similar to artefacts from central Mexico and the northern Yucatán Peninsula.&lt;ref name="Cobos94-98p80"&gt;Cobos 1994, 1998, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the crude chacmool sculptures is housed in the Museo Nacional de Antropología in [[San Salvador]]; the other is in private ownership.&lt;ref name="Sharer74p173"&gt;Sharer 1974, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metal artifacts==
Three gold ornaments have been excavated from Tazumal. They were created using the [[Lost-wax casting|lost wax method]] and have been tentatively dated to the 8th century AD; their presence indicates contacts with lower Central America.&lt;ref&gt;Sheets 2000, p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt; These, together with some contemporary metal artefacts from Copán, are among the earliest reported metal artefacts from Mesoamerica.&lt;ref&gt;Sorenson 1954, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; These items were recovered from a Late Classic tomb and at least one item was a traded artefact from the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]].&lt;ref&gt;Bray 1971, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burials==
According to anecdotal evidence from workers who excavated the area of the presumed eastern platform of B1-1, many burials were found in that area. However, these were not mentioned by Boggs in any of his excavation reports.&lt;ref name="Kato&amp;c06p220"/&gt;

'''Burial 1''' was found interred {{convert|20|cm|in}} under the ledge joining the first and second levels of Pyramid B1-2. The burial consisted of a lower jaw and the remains of several other bones, accompanied by ceramic fragments and some obsidian artefacts. The dispersed remains indicate that Burial 1 was a [[secondary burial]], possibly that of a [[human sacrifice in Maya culture|human sacrifice]] associated with the dedication of the final phase of the pyramid.&lt;ref name="Kato&amp;c06p217"/&gt; The teeth indicate that the remains were those of a young adult; the associated ceramics date the burial to the Terminal Classic or Early Postclassic.&lt;ref&gt;Kato et al 2006, pp. 217-218.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Burial 2''' was found under the western facade of Structure B1-2. Its dating is uncertain but it is believed to be associated with the final phase of construction and contemporaneous with Burial 1. The burial consisted of many bone fragments, including skull, longbones, ribs, jaw and vertebrae. The teeth indicate that the remains were those of a child. The remains were accompanied by ceramic pieces and some ashes. The ashes were subjected to [[radiocarbon dating]], which indicated a date in the Late Classic to Early Postclassic, between AD 770 and 1000.&lt;ref name="Kato&amp;c06p218"&gt;Kato et al 2006, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The American Monomyth''''' is a 1977 book by [[Robert Jewett]] and [[John Shelton Lawrence]] arguing for the existence and cultural importance of an 'American Monomyth', a variation on the classical [[monomyth]] as proposed by [[Joseph Campbell]].

Campbell's monomyth describes a hero's journey: a hero ventures from the normal world into a supernatural one, winning a decisive victory there and returning with a 'boon'. In contrast, Jewett and Lawrence define the American monomyth as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"A community in a harmonious paradise is threatened by evil; normal institutions fail to contend with this threat; a selfless superhero emerges to renounce temptations and carry out the redemptive task; aided by fate, his decisive victory restores the community to its paradisiacal condition; the superhero then recedes into obscurity."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In their 2002 book ''The Myth of the American Superhero'' (with Lawrence as first author) and their 2003 book ''Captain America And The Crusade Against Evil: The Dilemma Of Zealous Nationalism'' (with Jewett as first author), the authors extend the thesis by using examples from both American popular culture and the American religious tradition.

''The American Monomyth'' posits a level of cultural belief in American society that helps to explain the desire in American government to [[American exceptionalism|"save" the world]].

'''''The Doctor''''' is an 1891 painting by [[Luke Fildes]] that depicts a Victorian doctor observing the critical stage in a child's illness while the parents gaze on helplessly from the periphery. It has been used to portray the values of the ideal physician and the inadequacies of the medical profession. Different theories exist as to the painting's origin but it is most likely based upon Fildes' own experience of the death of his son. Critics have noted that Fildes omitted common medical equipment of his era in order to focus on the relationship between physician and patient.

The painting was commissioned by [[Henry Tate]] in 1890 as a work of "[[social realism]]" on a topic of Fildes' choosing to be displayed in the National Gallery of British Art, now known as the [[Tate Gallery London]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Fildes was paid £3,000 for the work, a sum he felt was too small for such a painting and less than he expected for painting portraits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/Jfildes.htm|title=Luke Fildes|work=Spartacus Educational|access-date=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two Victorian doctors, Dr [[Thomas Buzzard]] (neurologist) and Dr [[Gustavus Murray]] (obstetrician), have been particularly associated with the painting, as has the genre of the period in which it was painted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rinsler|first=Albert|date=1 August 1993|title="The Doctor"|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/096777209300100307|journal=Journal of Medical Biography|language=en|volume=1|issue=3|pages=165–170|doi=10.1177/096777209300100307|via=Sage}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fildes had the particular desire "to put on record the status of the doctor in our time".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Different theories exist as to the origins of the painting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Fildes' personal loss ===
The most important personal influence was probably the death of Fildes' first child, his one-year-old son, Philip, from [[typhoid fever]] on Christmas morning, 1877.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shankar|first=Ravi|last2=Morgan|first2=Huw|date=March 2012|title=The Doctor, by Luke Fildes|url=http://ovidsp.tx.ovid.com.rsm.idm.oclc.org/sp-3.27.2b/ovidweb.cgi?WebLinkFrameset=1&amp;S=JNFOFPCLGJDDFNGFNCFKEDLBAFDIAA00&amp;returnUrl=ovidweb.cgi%3f%26Full%2bText%3dL%257cS.sh.22.23%257c0%257c00001888-201203010-00020%26S%3dJNFOFPCLGJDDFNGFNCFKEDLBAFDIAA00&amp;directlink=http%3a%2f%2fovidsp.tx.ovid.com%2fovftpdfs%2fFPDDNCLBEDGFGJ00%2ffs047%2fovft%2flive%2fgv024%2f00001888%2f00001888-201203010-00020.pdf&amp;filename=The+Doctor.&amp;pdf_key=FPDDNCLBEDGFGJ00&amp;pdf_index=/fs047/ovft/live/gv024/00001888/00001888-201203010-00020|journal=Academic Medicine|volume=87| issue =  3|pages=332–333|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fildes' biographer has described how the boy's death compelled Fildes to paint a picture revolving around the compassionate Dr Murray visiting his dying child. The story was confirmed later by Fildes' second son, who described this as Fildes' "quickest painted of his 'big' pictures".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Friedlaender|first=Linda K.|last2=Friedlaender|first2=Gary E.|title=Art in Science: The Doctor by Luke Fildes: Putting the Patient First|url=https://doi-org.rsm.idm.oclc.org/10.1007/s11999-015-4527-z|journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research|volume=473|issue=11|pages=3355–3359|doi=10.1007/s11999-015-4527-z|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fildes' experiences ===
Documentation of Fildes' work with the homeless reveals that a child was once brought into the studio by a labourer, a scenario which prompted the painting ''The Widower'' (1876). This painting included many features&amp;nbsp;later seen in ''The Doctor''.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Fildes most likely modelled the characters in the painting on his own family and himself. Observing photographs of himself, Fildes guided his models, who were frequently his friends. His daughter was likely the prototype of the sick child, and a professional model was used for the mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sweeney|first=Patrick J|title=The Doctor|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(05)60059-1|journal=The Lancet|language=en|volume=352|issue=9131|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(05)60059-1|year=1998|page=912}}&lt;/ref&gt; The child's resting hand and extended arm may have been drawn from Fildes' older son. Despite reports that doctors visited Fildes in the hope of being used as models, the final painting of the doctor resembles Fildes himself.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Paying tribute to his family origins in the fishing industry, Fildes adds a fishing net hanging from the ceiling. His father was a [[mariner]] and shipping agent.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== On Queen Victoria's orders ===
The cottage setting has led some to believe that the painting was ordered by [[Queen Victoria]] to honour her own physician, [[Sir James Clark, 1st Baronet|Sir James Clark]]. This alternative account also originates in the story about her physician being sent to Balmoral to care for the sick child of a servant.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefamousartists.com/luke-fildes/the-doctor|title=The Doctor by Luke Fildes|website=www.thefamousartists.com|language=en-US|access-date=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social context ===
18th and 19th century concerns by society of the rise of scientific medicine also could have possibly influenced the format of the painting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Composition==
=== Preparation ===
The painting was first exhibited in 1891.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Jane|date=1 March 2008|title=What Sir Luke Fildes' 1887 painting The Doctor can teach us about the practice of medicine today|url=http://bjgp.org/content/58/548/210|journal=Br J Gen Pract|language=en|volume=58|issue=548|pages=210–213|doi=10.3399/bjgp08X279571|issn=0960-1643|pmid=18318983|pmc=2249807}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to completion, a number of sketches were made which are preserved at the Tate Gallery and depict various alternative compositions such as the doctor being on the right side of the canvas, the child seated rather than lying down, and different facial expressions for the doctor.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/fildes-the-doctor-n01522|title='The Doctor', Sir Luke Fildes, exhibited 1891|website=TATE|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fildes built a model cottage to copy after visiting numerous cottages in north-east Scotland, ensuring that the picture included authentic detail of roof rafters, tablecloth, lampshade, and lighting.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Particular attention was paid to ensuring the room had a poor, Victorian, multi-purpose appearance.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Doctor and patient ===
[[File:The Doctor by Luke Fildes (detail).jpg|right|thumb|Detail of the doctor and patient]]
The focus of the picture is the worried but sympathetic physician and the sick child, with everything else in the shadows. The child had experienced a 'crisis', the critical stage of a potentially life-threatening illness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The ' dawn' light through the window, represents recovery and hope as the child survived the night.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The concentrated focus of the doctor on the child shows the patient as a person and individual and the doctor as a compassionate carer with empathy for the patient's suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/905231381|title=Textbook of family medicine|last=Rakel|first=Robert|publisher=Elsevier|others=Rakel, Robert E.,, Rakel, David,|year=|isbn=9780323239905|edition=Ninth|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=3–16|oclc=905231381}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In 2002, Douglas wrote in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'', "So his manner is all, and Fildes captures it forever: the furrowed brow; the hand propping the firm bearded chin; the calm, concerned authority".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Parents ===
The parents are insignificant, helpless, and not central to the picture. A dominating male father gives support to his weaker female wife by extending his arm and resting his hand on her shoulder. She appears to be crying and possibly praying.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; He, however, is also helpless and peers on at the doctor and child.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Lighting and room ===
The artificial light from the lamp on the table and the natural rising sunlight beginning to shine through the single window suggest that the doctor has been in attendance all night.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  A distressed, poor, and modest family is depicted by one small carpet and the washing suspended in a small room.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Two mismatched chairs, pressed together, construct a makeshift bed in the labourer's cottage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A couple of scrunched up papers lie on the floor, "most probably a filled prescription" which has been frustratingly discarded.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; An easily missed medicine bottle is placed in the shadow of the lamp and in close proximity to the doctor and his control, not the parents'.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Accuracy==
Fildes stated that his choice of subject was "to put on record the status of the doctor in our own time",&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; but his depiction of 19th-century healthcare is not entirely accurate. There is no [[stethoscope]], [[microscope]], [[sphygmomanometer]], or [[thermometer]] in the picture, well-known instruments of physicians in the late 19th century which saved time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It may be that these instruments were omitted in order to show the doctors' "professional and personal commitment".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Fildes does include a pestle and mortar, and a cup and a spoon, equipment used before the scientific era of medicine.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

It has also been pointed out that it was unlikely that a Victorian physician would make an overnight home visit to a poor family, such services being available only to the middle class and the wealthy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Reception and legacy ==
[[File:Health-Doctors-Cartoons-Punch-1911-06-14-461.jpg|thumb|left|''The Doctor'' used ironically in a 1911 ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoon by [[Bernard Partridge]] commenting on the effects of the [[National Insurance Act 1911]]&lt;ref name=punch/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw43340/The-Doctor-with-apologies-to-Sir-Luke-Fildes-RA-David-Lloyd-George The Doctor (with apologies to Sir Luke Fildes, R.A.) (David Lloyd George).] National Portrait Gallery. Retrieved 7 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The painting caught the public's attention and toured Britain. Received with a striking admiration, there is one report of an observer who, overwhelmed at the painting, died on the spot.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The work is considered one of the most famous depictions of the practice of medicine and has been described as "iconic".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It epitomises an idyllic kind of medicine&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=The Doctor by Luke Fildes: an icon in context.|url=|journal=Journal of Medical Humanities|volume=28|issue=2|pages=|issn=1573-3645|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has often been used to illustrate the virtues of a good doctor and the inadequacies of the medical profession.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Subsequently, the painting received comments including this by surgeon W. Mitchell Banks: "What do we not owe to Mr. Fildes for showing to the world the typical doctor as we would all like him to be shown – an honest man and a gentle man, doing his best to relieve suffering?" He continued: "A library of books written in your honour would not do what this picture has done and will do for the medical profession in making the hearts of our fellow men warm to us with confidence and affection".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Seen today as "Victorian spin" by some, in its time the depiction of the doctor as a hero serving the poor raised the status of the medical profession during a period when public opinion was critical of the increasingly impersonal nature of medicine.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The painting has inspired poetry and film.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1911 it featured in a ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoon commenting satirically on the effect of the [[National Insurance Act 1911]] on doctors.&lt;ref name=punch&gt;''Punch'', 14 June 1911, p. 461.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, the American artist [[Joseph Tomanek]] painted a version of the painting making small changes to the composition.&lt;ref name=nlm/&gt; In 1947 it was reproduced on a United States postage stamp for the centenary of the [[American Medical Association]],&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Milligan|first=Barry|date=September 2016|title=Luke Fildes' The Doctor, narrative painting, and the selfless professional ideal|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/victorian-literature-and-culture/article/luke-fildess-the-doctor-narrative-painting-and-the-selfless-professional-ideal/1E22DA494165711967D825D475D21223/core-reader|journal=Victorian Literature and Culture|volume=44|issue=3|pages=641–668|doi=10.1017/S1060150316000097|issn=1060-1503|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in 1949 used it in their campaign against nationalised medical care as proposed by President [[Harry S. Truman]]. The image was printed on 65,000 posters and brochures with the slogan, "Keep Politics Out of this Picture". This has been described as contributing to public distrust of nationalised medical care in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2009/06/to-the-ama-its-not-about-you/19303/|title=To the AMA: It's not about you.|last=Verghese|first=Abraham|date=|work=The Atlantic|access-date=4 December 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, in Britain it was used as the emblem for a celebration of Britain's [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 1933, a sculpture of the scene in the painting was made using the "life-size, life-like, new art form" of [[sculpticolor]] and displayed at the [[Petrolagar]] laxative exhibit in the Hall of Science at the Chicago [[Century of Progress]] exhibition. It was cast from a model made by the sculptor [[John Paulding (sculptor)|John Paulding]] and then painted by [[Rudolph F. Ingerle]], the entire work measuring {{convert|15|ft}} in length, {{convert|11|ft}} in height, and {{convert|9|ft}} in depth. Publicity stated that "''The Doctor'' impressively emphasizes the ideal relationship between physician and patient - 'The Human Touch'".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/ead/pdf/century0364.pdf ''A Souvenir of the famous painting "The Doctor"''], Petrolagar Laboratories, Chicago, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/ead/pdf/century0273.pdf ''A Remembrance of the Famous Painting ''The Doctor'' by Sir Luke Fildes, R.A."], Petrolagar Laboratories, Chicago, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt;

As late as 1951, the painting was used in advertising for [[Wyeth]] pharmaceuticals, which repeated the story that Queen Victoria commissioned it, adding: "the pictured child recovered despite the inadequacies of her humble home–a tribute to her doctor's genius and to the progress of medical science".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/vigil51hahn#page/n96/mode/2up ''The 1951 Vigil''.] Hahnemann Hospital School of Nursing, Philadelphia, 1951. pp. 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the mid-1990s, the medical humanities journals ''The Lancet'' and the ''British Medical Journal'' have revived interest in the painting, stimulating discussion about the role of the doctor.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Debate on the role and status of doctors has led to the inclusion of medical humanities in medical schools, where this painting has been used as a teaching aid for medical students.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The reason for the painting's popularity has been much debated. The universal sentiment associated with a doctor tending to a sick child appears simple. Ultimately, it is likely that ''The Doctor'' was hailed as iconic due to the wish to be cared for with single-minded attentiveness.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[File:Mercury-Wonder-Show-1943.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Advertising herald for ''The Mercury Wonder Show'' (August 1943)]]
'''''The Mercury Wonder Show for Service Men''''' was a 1943 magic-and-variety stage show by the [[Mercury Theatre]], produced by [[Orson Welles]] and [[Joseph Cotten]] as a morale-boosting entertainment for US soldiers in [[World War II]]. Directed by Welles, the show starred Welles ("Orson the Magnificent"), Cotten ("Jo-Jo the Great"), [[Agnes Moorehead]] ("[[Calliope]] Aggie") and [[Rita Hayworth]], whose part was later filled by [[Marlene Dietrich]]. [[Jean Gabin]] also worked on the show backstage, as a propman. The show ran to 150 minutes.

==Background==
[[File:Welles-Draft-1943.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Orson Welles leaving his Army physical examination after being judged unfit for military service (May 6, 1943)]]
In early 1943, the two concurrent radio series (''[[Ceiling Unlimited]]'', ''[[Hello Americans]]'') that Orson Welles created for [[CBS Radio|CBS]] to support the war effort had ended. Filming also had wrapped on ''[[Jane Eyre (1943 film)|Jane Eyre]]'' and that fee, in addition to the income from his regular guest-star roles in radio, made it possible for Welles to fulfill a lifelong dream. He approached the War Assistance League of Southern California and proposed a show that evolved into a big-top spectacle, part [[circus]] and part [[magic (illusion)|magic show]]. He offered his services as magician and director,&lt;ref name="Magic"&gt;Charvet, David, "Orson Welles and The Mercury Wonder Show". ''[[Magic (magazine)|Magic, An Independent Magazine for Magicians]]'', Volume 2 Number 12, August 1993&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|40|date=June 2014}} and invested some $40,000 of his own money in an extravaganza he called ''The Mercury Wonder Show for Service Men''. Members of the U.S. armed forces were admitted free of charge, while the general public had to pay.&lt;ref name="Genii"/&gt;{{Rp|26|date=June 2014}} The show entertained more than 1,000 service members each night, and proceeds went to the War Assistance League, a charity for military service personnel.&lt;ref name="Billboard"/&gt;

"It was just like a circus — I would have adored it if I'd been a member of the audience, I know that," Welles later told filmmaker [[Peter Bogdanovich]].&lt;ref name="TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|177|date=June 2014}}

The development of the show coincided with the resolution of Welles's [[Selective Service System|draft status]] in May 1943, when he was finally declared 4-F — unfit for military service — for a variety of medical reasons. "I felt guilty about the war," Welles told biographer Barbara Leaming. "I was guilt-ridden about my civilian status."&lt;ref name="Leaming Hayworth"&gt;Leaming, Barbara, ''If This Was Happiness: A Biography of Rita Hayworth''. New York: Viking, 1989 {{ISBN|0-670-81978-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|86|date=June 2014}} He had been publicly hounded about his patriotism since ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', when the Hearst press began persistent inquiries about why Welles had not been drafted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://framework.latimes.com/2011/09/28/orson-welles-rejected-by-army/ |title=Orson Welles Rejected by Army (May 6, 1943) |publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', September 28, 2011 |accessdate=2014-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wellesnet.com/?p=6392 |title=70 years ago: Orson Welles’ patriotism, military service made headlines |publisher=Wellesnet, May 3, 2013 |accessdate=2014-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McBride"&gt;[[Joseph McBride (writer)|McBride, Joseph]], ''What Ever Happened to Orson Welles? A Portrait of an Independent Career''. Lexington, Kentucky: [[University Press of Kentucky]], 2006, {{ISBN|0-8131-2410-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|66–67|June 2014}}

Welles's fascination with illusion dated back to childhood; [[Harry Houdini]] gave him his first lessons in magic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wellesnet.com/sketchbook4.htm |title=Orson Welles Sketch Book Transcripts, Episode 4  |publisher=''[[Orson Welles' Sketch Book]]'' at Wellesnet: The Orson Welles Web Resource |accessdate=2014-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1941 debut at the [[California State Fair]] (assisted by [[Dolores del Río]]) was a hit and, as "The Ace", he continued practicing his performance skills at vaudeville theaters and army camps. By 1943 Welles had developed a two-hour magic show.&lt;ref name="Genii"/&gt;{{Rp|26|date=June 2014}}

==Rehearsal and previews==

For ''The Mercury Wonder Show'', Welles selected [[Rita Hayworth]], one of the most popular women in motion pictures, as his chief assistant.&lt;ref name="Magic"/&gt;{{Rp|40|date=June 2014}}&lt;ref name="Genii"/&gt;{{Rp|26|date=June 2014}} In April 1943 he began teaching illusions to Hayworth, who was then living with him.&lt;ref name="Whaley"/&gt;{{Rp|163}} The couple practiced the [[Metamorphosis (illusion)|Houdini Substitution Trunk]] routine in the 125-seat private theater of [[Bill Larsen]], a successful Los Angeles attorney and magician who operated Thayer's Studio of Magic.&lt;ref name="Whaley"/&gt;{{Rp|163}}

Other cast included co-producer Joseph Cotten and, in his stage debut as comedy assistant, Welles's chauffeur, George (Shorty) Chirello.&lt;ref name="Whaley"/&gt;{{Rp|165|date=June 2014}} Welles hired [[Keye Luke]] — an accomplished visual artist as well as an actor — to design culturally authentic scenery and graphics, in contrast to the fake-Oriental visuals typically seen in [[Western culture|Western]] magic shows.&lt;ref name="Whaley"/&gt;{{Rp|167|date=June 2014}}

The show was rehearsed for 17 weeks.&lt;ref name="Magic"/&gt;{{Rp|40|date=June 2014}} Welles leased the Playtime Theatre (later the Las Palmas Theatre), a 350-seat house in Hollywood.

A portion of the stage show was filmed and included in the 1944 variety film, ''[[Follow the Boys]]''. The film segment was directed by Welles, uncredited.

Welles and Dietrich agreed to appear in the film while ''The Mercury Wonder Show'' was still running. The seven-minute segment was shot on the Universal lot in late September 1943. Welles traded his robe and fez for white tie and tails, and brought along a crew from the show — Shorty Chirello, Tommy Hanlon, Professor Bill and his Circus Symphony, Death Valley Mack, two female assistants and eight chorus girls. Welles performed a few illusions; his own appearance on stage and the comic version of the sawing-a-woman-in-half illusion featuring Dietrich were achieved with trick photography.&lt;ref name="Whaley"/&gt;{{Rp|184}} Welles received $30,000 for his part in the film.

'''''The Silmarillion''''' &lt;small&gt;(pronounced: [[Sindarin|/sɪlmaˈrɪljɔn/]])&lt;/small&gt; is a collection of [[Mythopoeia|mythopoeic]] works by English writer [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], edited and published posthumously by his son, [[Christopher Tolkien]], in 1977, with assistance from [[Guy Gavriel Kay]].&lt;ref name="Silf"&gt;{{Harv|Silmarillion|1977|loc=Foreword|Ref=Silmarillion}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Silmarillion'', along with J. R. R. Tolkien's other works, forms an extensive, though incomplete, narrative that describes the universe of [[Eä]] in which are found the lands of [[Valinor]], [[Beleriand]], [[Númenor]], and [[Middle-earth]], within which ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' take place.

After the success of ''The Hobbit'', Tolkien's publisher requested a sequel. Tolkien sent them an early draft of ''The Silmarillion'' but they rejected the work as being obscure and "too Celtic". The result was that Tolkien began work on "A Long Expected Party", the first chapter of what he described at the time as "a new story about [[Hobbit]]s", which became ''The Lord of the Rings''.&lt;ref name=beleriand&gt;{{Citation|title=The Lays of Beleriand|last=Tolkien |first=J.R.R.|publisher=Ballantine|editor=Christopher Tolkien|pages=433–4|isbn=0-345-38818-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Silmarillion'' comprises five parts. The first part, ''[[Ainulindalë]]'', tells of the creation of Eä, the "world that ''is''". ''[[Valaquenta]]'', the second part, gives a description of the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]] and [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maiar]], the supernatural powers in Eä. The next section, ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', which forms the bulk of the collection, chronicles the history of the events before and during the [[First Age]], including the wars over the [[Silmaril]]s that gave the book its title. The fourth part, ''[[Akallabêth]]'', relates the history of the Downfall of Númenor and its people, which takes place in the [[Second Age]]. The final part, ''[[Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age]]'', is a brief account of the circumstances which led to and were presented in ''The Lord of the Rings''.

The five parts were initially separate works, but it was the elder Tolkien's express wish that they be published together.&lt;ref name="Silf" /&gt; Because J. R. R. Tolkien died before he finished revising the various legends, Christopher gathered material from his father's older writings to fill out the book. In a few cases, this meant that he had to devise completely new material in order to resolve gaps and inconsistencies in the narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=My father's "eviscerated" work – son of Hobbit scribe J.R.R.

==Overview==
''The Silmarillion'', like Tolkien's other [[Middle-earth writings]], was meant to have taken place at some time in Earth's past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#165, 211}}&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with this idea, ''The Silmarillion'' is meant to have been translated from [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]]'s three-volume ''[[Red Book of Westmarch|Translations from the Elvish]]'', which he wrote while at [[Rivendell]].&lt;ref name="BoLTF"&gt;{{ME-ref|BolT|Foreword}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapters in the book include:
*"The [[Music of the Ainur]]"
*"Quenta Silmarillion" (the history of the [[Silmaril]]s and the war of the [[Noldor]] against [[Morgoth]])
*"Of [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]]"
*"[[Túrin Turambar]]" (closely associated with "[[Narn i Hîn Húrin|Narn i Chîn Húrin: The Tale of the Children of Húrin]]" in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' and ''[[The Children of Húrin]]'') &lt;!-- please note Chîn is the correct spelling --&gt;
*"Of [[Tuor]] and The Fall of [[Gondolin]]"
*"Of the Voyage of [[Eärendil]] and the [[War of Wrath]]"

The inside title page contains an inscription written in [[Tengwar]]. In the common script, it reads "The tales of the [[First Age]] when [[Morgoth]] dwelt in Middle-earth and the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] made war upon him for the recovery of the Silmarils to which are appended the downfall of Númenor and the history of the [[Rings of Power]] and the Third Age in which these tales come to their end."

==Synopsis==
{{Silmarillion}}

===''Ainulindalë'' and ''Valaquenta''===
{{Main article|Ainulindalë|Valaquenta}}

The first section of ''The Silmarillion'', ''Ainulindalë'' ("The Music of the [[Ainu (Middle-earth)|Ainur]]"&lt;ref name="SilNameIndex"&gt;{{Harv|Silmarillion|1977|loc=Index of Names|Ref=Silmarillion}}&lt;/ref&gt;), takes the form of a primary creation narrative. Eru ("The One"&lt;ref&gt;(Silmarillion 1977, pp. 15, 329)&lt;/ref&gt;), also called [[Eru Ilúvatar|Ilúvatar]] ("Father of All"), first created the Ainur, a group of eternal spirits or [[demiurge]]s, called "the offspring of his thought". Ilúvatar brought the Ainur together and showed them a theme, from which he bade them make a great music. [[Morgoth|Melkor]] – whom Ilúvatar had given the "greatest power and knowledge" of all the Ainur – broke from the harmony of the music to develop his own song. Some Ainur joined him, while others continued to follow Ilúvatar, causing discord in the music. This happened thrice, with Eru Ilúvatar successfully overpowering his rebellious subordinate with a new theme each time. Ilúvatar then stopped the music and showed them a vision of [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]] and its peoples. The vision disappeared after a while, and Ilúvatar offered the Ainur a chance to enter into Arda and govern over the new world.

Many Ainur descended, taking physical form and becoming bound to that world. The greater Ainur became known as the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]], while the lesser Ainur were called the [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maiar]]. The Valar attempted to prepare the world for the coming inhabitants (Elves and [[Men (Middle-earth)|Men]]), while Melkor, who wanted Arda for himself, repeatedly destroyed their work; this went on for thousands of years until, through waves of destruction and creation, the world took shape.

''Valaquenta'' ("Account of the Valar"&lt;ref name="SilNameIndex" /&gt;) describes Melkor and each of the 14 Valar in detail, as well as a few of the Maiar. It also reveals how Melkor seduced many Maiar – including those who would eventually become [[Sauron]] and the [[Balrog]]s – into his service.

===''Quenta Silmarillion''===
{{Main article|Quenta Silmarillion}}

''Quenta Silmarillion'' ("The History of the [[Silmaril]]s"&lt;ref name="SilNameIndex" /&gt;), which makes up the bulk of the book, is a series of interconnected tales set in the First Age that make up the tragic saga of the three jewels, the Silmarils.

The Valar had attempted to fashion the world for [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] and [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]], but Melkor continually destroyed their handiwork. After he destroyed the two lamps that illuminated the world, the Valar moved to [[Aman (Middle-earth)|Aman]], a continent to the west of Middle-earth, where they established their home called [[Valinor]]. [[Yavanna]] created [[Two Trees of Valinor|Two Trees]] that illuminated Valinor and left Middle-earth to darkness and Melkor. Soon after, stars created by [[Varda]] began to shine and the [[Awakening of the Elves|Elves awoke]]. The elves originally formed three groups: the [[Vanyar]], the [[Noldor]], and the [[Teleri]], though some elves were captured and enslaved by Melkor, eventually to be bred into [[orc]]s. Knowing the danger the Elves were in, the Valar decided to fight Melkor to keep the Elves safe. After defeating and capturing Melkor, they invited the Elves to live in Aman. Many Elves travelled to Aman, while others refused and still others stopped along the way, including the Elves who later became the [[Sindar]], ruled by the Elf King [[Thingol]] and [[Melian]], a Maia. Of the three tribes that set out, all of the [[Vanyar]] and [[Noldor]], and many of the [[Teleri]] reached Aman.

In Aman, [[Fëanor]], son of [[Finwë]], King of the Noldor, created the Silmarils, jewels that glowed with the light of the Two Trees. Melkor, who had been held in captivity by the Valar, was eventually released after feigning repentance. Upon release, Melkor deceived Fëanor into believing that his eldest half-brother [[Fingolfin]] was attempting a coup against [[Finwë]]. This rift led to the banishment of [[Fëanor]] from the Noldor city [[Tirion]], and Fëanor thereafter created the fortress Formenos to the North of [[Tirion]]. Finwë moved to Formenos to live with Fëanor, his favourite of three sons, and there they safely kept the Silmarils. After many years, Fëanor travelled to Tirion to make amends with Fingolfin, while Finwë stayed at Formenos. While making amends, Melkor destroyed the Two Trees with the help of [[Ungoliant]], a dark spider spirit Melkor found in Avathar, on the Southeast side of Aman. Together, Melkor and Ungoliant then escaped to Formenos, killed Finwë, stole the Silmarils, and fled to Middle-earth. Melkor kept the Silmarils and banished Ungoliant, later attacking the Elvish kingdom of [[Doriath]], ruled by the Elf King [[Thingol]] and his wife [[Melian]]. He was defeated in the [[Battles of Beleriand|first of five battles of Beleriand]], however, and barricaded himself in his northern fortress of [[Angband]].

Fëanor and his sons swore an oath of vengeance against Melkor – and against anyone who withheld the Silmarils from them, even the Valar. Fëanor persuaded most of the Noldor to pursue Melkor, whom [[Fëanor]] renamed as [[Morgoth]], into Middle-earth. Fëanor's sons seized ships from the Teleri, attacking and killing many of them, and left the other Noldor to make the voyage by foot. Upon arriving in Middle-earth, the Noldor under Fëanor attacked Melkor and defeated his host, though Fëanor was slain by Balrogs. After a period of peace, Melkor attacked the Noldor but was again defeated and besieged. Nearly 400 years later, he broke the siege and drove the Noldor back.

After the destruction of the Trees and the theft of the Silmarils, the Valar created the moon and the sun. At the same time, Men awoke, some of whom later arrived in Beleriand and allied themselves with the Elves. [[Beren]], a man who had survived the latest battle, wandered to Doriath, where he fell in love with the elf [[Lúthien]], the king's daughter. The king sought to prevent their marriage by imposing what he believed an impossible task: retrieving one of the Silmarils from Melkor. But together, Beren and Lúthien embarked on this quest. [[Sauron]], a powerful servant of Melkor, imprisoned Beren along the way; but with Lúthien's help he escaped, crept into Melkor's fortress, and stole a Silmaril from Melkor's crown. Having achieved the task, the first union of man and elf was formed, though Beren was soon mortally wounded and Lúthien also died of grief. However she convinced the Vala [[Mandos]] to revive Beren and herself, choosing to sacrifice her immortality in favour of a mortal life with her beloved.

The Noldor, seeing that a mortal and an elf-woman could infiltrate Angband, perceived that Melkor was not invincible. They attacked again with a great army of Elves, [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] and Men. But they were deceived by Melkor, who had secretly darkened the hearts of many of the men. Thus it was that the Elvish host were utterly defeated, due in part to the treachery of some Men. However, many Men remained loyal to the Elves and were honoured thereafter.

None received more honour than the brothers [[Húrin]] and [[Huor]]. Huor died in battle, but Melkor captured Húrin, and cursed him to watch the downfall of his kin. Húrin's son, [[Túrin Turambar]], was sent to Doriath, leaving his mother and unborn sister behind in his father's kingdom (which had been overrun by the enemy). Túrin achieved many great deeds of valour, the greatest being the defeat of the [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]] [[Glaurung]]. Despite his heroism, however, Túrin was plagued by the curse of Melkor, which led him unwittingly to murder his friend [[Beleg]] and to marry and impregnate his sister [[Nienor Níniel|Nienor]], whom he had never met before, and who had lost her memory through Glaurung's enchantment. Before their child was born, the bewitchment was lifted as the dragon lay dying. Nienor, realizing what grew within her, took her own life. Upon learning the truth, Túrin threw himself on his sword.

Huor's son, [[Tuor]], became involved in the fate of the hidden Noldorin kingdom of Gondolin. He married the elf [[Idril]], daughter of [[Turgon]], Lord of [[Gondolin]] (the second union between Elves and Men). When Gondolin fell, betrayed from within by [[Maeglin]], Tuor saved many of its inhabitants from destruction. All of the Elvish kingdoms in Beleriand eventually fell, and the refugees fled to a haven by the sea created by Tuor. The son of Tuor and Idril, [[Eärendil]] the [[Half-elven]], was betrothed to [[Elwing]], herself descended from Beren and Lúthien. Elwing brought Eärendil the Silmaril of Beren and Lúthien, and using its light Eärendil travelled across the sea to Aman to seek help from the Valar. The Valar obliged; they attacked and defeated Melkor, completely destroying his fortress [[Angband]] and sinking most of [[Beleriand]]; and they expelled Melkor from Arda. This ended the First Age of Middle-earth. The last two Silmarils were taken by [[Fëanor]]'s surviving sons [[Maedhros]] and Maglor. However, Maedhros killed himself by leaping into a fiery chasm with a Silmaril while Maglor threw his into the sea and spent the rest of his days wandering along the shores of the world, singing his grief.

Eärendil and Elwing had two children: [[Elrond]] and [[Elros]]. As descendants of immortal elves and mortal men, they were given the choice of which lineage to belong to: Elrond chose to belong to the Elves, his brother to Men. Elros became the first king of Númenor and lived to 500 years old, being given an extended life in return for choosing to be a Man.

===''Akallabêth''===
{{Main article|Akallabêth}}

''Akallabêth'' ("The Downfallen"&lt;ref name="SilNameIndex" /&gt;) comprises about 30 pages, and recounts the rise and fall of the island kingdom of [[Númenor]], inhabited by the [[Dúnedain]]. After the defeat of Melkor, the Valar gave the island to the [[Edain|three loyal houses of Men]] who had aided the Elves in the war against him. Through the favour of the Valar, the Dúnedain were granted wisdom and power and life more enduring than any other of mortal race had possessed, making them comparable to the High-Elves of [[Aman (Middle-earth)|Aman]]. Indeed, the isle of Númenor lay closer to Aman than to Middle-earth. But their power lay in their bliss and their acceptance of mortality. The fall of Númenor came about in large measure through the influence of the corrupted Maia [[Sauron]] (the chief servant of Melkor), who arose during the Second Age and tried to conquer Middle-earth.

The Númenóreans moved against Sauron, who saw that he could not defeat them by force and allowed himself to be taken as a prisoner to Númenor. There he quickly enthralled the king, [[Ar-Pharazôn]], urging him to seek out the immortality that the Valar had apparently denied him, thus nurturing the seeds of envy that the Númenóreans had begun to hold against the Elves of the West and the Valar. So it was that all the knowledge and power of Númenor was turned towards seeking an avoidance of death; but this only weakened them and sped the gradual waning of the lifespans to something more similar to that of other Men. Sauron urged them to wage war against the Valar themselves to win immortality, and to worship his master Melkor, whom he said could grant them their wish. Ar-Pharazôn created the mightiest army and fleet Númenor had seen, and sailed against Aman. The Valar and Elves of Aman, stricken with grief over their betrayal, called on [[Ilúvatar]] for help. When Ar-Pharazôn landed, Ilúvatar destroyed his fleet and drowned Númenor itself as punishment for the rebellion against the rightful rule of the Valar. Ilúvatar created a great wave, such as had never before been seen, which utterly destroyed and submerged the isle of Númenor, killing all but those Dúnedain who had already sailed east, and changing the shape of all the lands of Middle-earth.

Sauron's physical manifestation was also destroyed in the ruin of Númenor, but as a Maia, his spirit returned to Middle-earth, no longer able to take upon himself the fair form he once had. Some Númenóreans who had remained loyal to the Valar were spared and were washed up on the shores of Middle-earth. Among these survivors were [[Elendil]] their leader, a descendant of Elros, and his two sons [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]] who had also saved a seedling from Númenor's white tree, the ancestor of that of Gondor. They founded the Númenórean Kingdoms in Exile:  [[Arnor]] in the north and [[Gondor]] in the south.  Elendil reigned as High-king of both kingdoms, but committed the rule of Gondor jointly to Isildur and Anárion.  The power of the kingdoms in exile was greatly diminished from that of Númenor, "yet very great it seemed to the wild men of Middle-earth".

At the end, it is mentioned that the sunken Númenor came to be called "Atalantë", a name not used when it existed. This led many readers to the conclusion that Númenor is [[Atlantis]]; this direct link was, however, denied by Tolkien himself, who asserted that it's a natural word following the constructs of [[Quenya]].

===''Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age''===
{{Main article|Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age}}

The concluding section of the book, comprising about 20 pages, describes the events that take place in Middle-earth during the Second and [[Third Age]]s. In the Second Age, Sauron emerged as the main power in Middle-earth, and the Rings of Power were forged by Elves led by [[Celebrimbor]]. Sauron secretly forged [[One Ring|his own ring]] to control the others, which led to war between the peoples of Middle-earth and Sauron, culminating in the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men|War of the Last Alliance]], in which Elves and the remaining Númenóreans united to defeat Sauron, bringing the Second Age to an end. The Third Age began with the passing of the [[One Ring]] to [[Isildur]], who was ambushed at the [[Gladden Fields]] shortly afterwards, and lost the ring in the [[Anduin|River Anduin]]. This section also gives a brief overview of the events leading up to and taking place in ''The Lord of the Rings'', including the waning of Gondor, the re-emergence of Sauron, the [[White Council]], [[Saruman]]'s treachery, and Sauron's final destruction along with the One Ring, after which the ages of magic end.

==Concept and creation==

===Development of the text===
Tolkien first began working on the stories that would become ''The Silmarillion'' in 1914,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#115}}&lt;/ref&gt; intending them to become an English mythology that would explain the origins of English history and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#131, 180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this early work was written while Tolkien, then a British officer returned from France during World War I, was in hospital and on sick leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#165, 180, 282}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed the first story, "[[The Fall of Gondolin]]", in late 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#163, 165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He called his collection of nascent stories ''The Book of Lost Tales''.&lt;ref name="BoLTF" /&gt; This became the name for the first two volumes of ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', which include these early texts. The stories employ the narrative device of a mariner named Eriol (in later versions, an Anglo-Saxon named [[Ælfwine of England|Ælfwine]]) who finds the island of [[Tol Eressëa]], where the Elves live; and the Elves tell him their history.&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|BolT|Chapter I, "The Cottage of Lost Play"}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Tolkien never completed ''The Book of Lost Tales''; he left it to compose the poems "[[The Lay of Leithian]]" and "[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]".&lt;ref name="BoLTF" /&gt;

The first complete version of ''The Silmarillion'' was the "Sketch of the Mythology" written in 1926&lt;ref name="LoB1"&gt;{{ME-ref|LoB|Chapter I, "The Lay of the Children of Húrin"}}&lt;/ref&gt; (later published in Volume IV of ''The History of Middle-earth''). The "Sketch" was a 28-page synopsis written to explain the background of the story of [[Túrin]] to R. W. Reynolds, a friend to whom Tolkien had sent several of the stories.&lt;ref name="LoB1" /&gt; From the "Sketch" Tolkien developed a fuller narrative version of ''The Silmarillion'' called ''Quenta Noldorinwa''&lt;ref name="SoMEP"&gt;{{ME-ref|SoME|Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also included in Volume IV). The ''Quenta Noldorinwa'' was the last version of ''The Silmarillion'' that Tolkien completed.&lt;ref name="SoMEP" /&gt;

In 1937, encouraged by the success of ''The Hobbit'', Tolkien submitted to his publisher [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] an incomplete but more fully developed version of ''The Silmarillion'' called ''Quenta Silmarillion'',&lt;ref name="BoLTF" /&gt; but they rejected the work as being obscure and "too [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]]".&lt;ref name="Letter19"&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publisher instead asked Tolkien to write a sequel to ''The Hobbit''.&lt;ref name="Letter19" /&gt; Tolkien began to revise ''The Silmarillion'', but soon turned to the sequel, which became ''The Lord of the Rings''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|LRoW|Part II, Chapter VI, "Quenta Silmarillion"}}&lt;/ref&gt; He renewed work on ''The Silmarillion'' after completing ''The Lord of the Rings'',&lt;ref name="MRF"&gt;{{ME-ref|MR|Foreword}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he greatly desired to publish the two works together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#124}}&lt;/ref&gt; But when it became clear that would not be possible, Tolkien turned his full attention to preparing ''The Lord of the Rings'' for publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1950s Tolkien returned to ''The Silmarillion'', but much of his writing from this time was concerned more with the theological and philosophical underpinnings of the work than with the narratives themselves. By this time, he had doubts about fundamental aspects of the work that went back to the earliest versions of the stories, and it seems that he felt the need to resolve these problems before he could produce the "final" version of ''The Silmarillion''.&lt;ref name="MRF" /&gt; During this time he wrote extensively on such topics as the nature of evil in Arda, the origin of [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]], the customs of the Elves, the nature and means of Elvish rebirth, and the "flat" world and the story of the Sun and Moon.&lt;ref name="MRF" /&gt; In any event, with one or two exceptions, he wrought little change to the narratives during the remaining years of his life.&lt;ref name="MRF" /&gt;

===Posthumous publication===

For several years after his father's death, Christopher Tolkien compiled a ''Silmarillion'' narrative. Christopher's intentions seem to have been mostly to use the latest writings of his father's that he could,{{citation needed&lt;!--ME-fact--&gt;|date=November 2007}} and to keep as much internal consistency (and consistency with ''The Lord of the Rings'') as possible,&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|UT|Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he admitted that a complete consistency was impossible.&lt;ref name="Silf" /&gt; As explained in ''The History of Middle-earth'', Christopher drew upon numerous sources for his narrative, relying on post-Lord of the Rings works where possible, but ultimately reaching back as far as the 1917 ''Book of Lost Tales'' to fill in portions of the narrative which his father had planned to write but never addressed. In one later chapter of ''Quenta Silmarillion'', "Of the Ruin of Doriath", which had not been touched since the early 1930s, he had to construct a narrative practically from scratch.&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|WotJ|Part Three, Chapter V "The Tale of Years"}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final result, which included genealogies, maps, an index, and the first-ever released Elvish word list, was published in 1977.
Because of Christopher's extensive explanations (in ''The History of Middle-earth'') of how he compiled the published work, much of ''The Silmarillion'' has been debated by readers. Christopher's task is generally accepted as very difficult given the state of his father's texts at the time of his death: some critical texts were no longer in the Tolkien family's possession, and Christopher's task compelled him to rush through much of the material. Christopher reveals in later volumes of ''The History of Middle-earth'' many divergent ideas which do not agree with the published version. Christopher Tolkien has suggested that, had he taken more time and had access to all the texts, he might have produced a substantially different work. But he was compelled by considerable pressure and demand from his father's readers and publishers to produce something publishable as quickly as possible{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}.

In October 1996, Christopher Tolkien commissioned illustrator [[Ted Nasmith]] to create full-page full-colour artwork for the first illustrated edition of ''The Silmarillion''. It was published in 1998, and followed in 2004 by a second edition featuring corrections and additional artwork by Nasmith.

During the 1980s and 1990s, Christopher Tolkien published most of his father's Middle-earth writings as the 12-volume ''The History of Middle-earth'' series. In addition to the source material and earlier drafts of several portions of ''The Lord of the Rings'', these books greatly expand on the original material published in ''The Silmarillion'', and in many cases diverge from it. There is much that Tolkien intended to revise but only sketched out in notes, and some new texts surfaced after the publication of ''The Silmarillion''. These books also make it clear just how [[Unfinished work|unfinished]] the later parts of ''The Silmarillion'' really were: some parts were never rewritten after the early versions in ''Lost Tales''.

===Influences===
{{Main article|J. R. R. Tolkien's influences}}
''The Silmarillion'' is a complex work exhibiting the influence of many sources. A major influence was the [[Finnish mythology|Finnish]] epic ''[[Kalevala]]'', especially the tale of [[Kullervo]]. Influence from [[Greek mythology]] is also apparent. The island of [[Númenor]], for example, recalls [[Atlantis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#154, 227}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, Tolkien later described in a letter to Christopher Bretherton as merely a "curious chance".

Greek mythology also colours the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]], who borrow many attributes from the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian gods]].&lt;ref name="Olympian"&gt;{{Citation

Influence of the Bible and traditional Christian narrative are seen in ''The Silmarillion'' in the conflict between Melkor and Eru Ilúvatar, a parallel of the polarity of Lucifer and God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Chance|2001|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, ''The Silmarillion'' tells of the creation and fall of the Elves, as ''Genesis'' tells of the creation and fall of Man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Medieval Christian cosmology shows its influence especially in the account of the creation of the universe as the manifestation of a sort of song sung by God with which the angels harmonize until the fallen angel introduces discord. St. Augustine's writings on music, as well as the extensive medieval tradition of the divine harmony—more familiar to us today in the notion of the "[[music of the spheres]]"—served as bases for this telling of creation.

[[Celtic mythology]] show its influence in the exile of the [[Noldor]]in Elves, for example, that borrow elements from the story of [[Irish legend]]s of the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]].&lt;ref name="Celtic"&gt;Fimi, Dimitra (August 2006). {{"'}}Mad' Elves and 'Elusive Beauty': Some Celtic Strands of Tolkien's Mythology". ''Folklore'', '''117'''(2), 156–170 . {{JSTOR|30035484}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Welsh influence is seen in the Elvish language [[Sindarin]], that Tolkien gave "a linguistic character very like (though not identical with) [[Welsh language|British-Welsh]] ... because it seems to fit the rather 'Celtic' type of legends and stories told of its speakers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Carpenter|1981|loc=#144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical response==
At the time of release, reviews of ''The Silmarillion'' were generally mixed to negative. ''The Silmarillion'' was criticized for being too serious, lacking the light-hearted moments that were found in ''The Lord of the Rings'' and especially ''The Hobbit''.&lt;ref name="TIME"&gt;{{Citation

Robert M. Adams of ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' called ''The Silmarillion'' "an empty and pompous bore", "not a literary event of any magnitude", and even claimed that the main reason for its "enormous sales" was the "Tolkien cult" created by the popularity of ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'', predicting that more people would buy ''The Silmarillion'' than would ever read it.&lt;ref name="NYRB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert M.

Nonetheless, a few reviewers praised the scope of Tolkien's creation. ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' acknowledged that "what is finally most moving is … the eccentric heroism of Tolkien's attempt".&lt;ref name="NYTBR" /&gt; ''TIME'' described ''The Silmarillion'' as "majestic, a work held so long and so powerfully in the writer's imagination that it overwhelms the reader".&lt;ref name="TIME" /&gt; The ''[[Horn Book Magazine]]'' even lauded the "remarkable set of legends conceived with imaginative might and told in beautiful language".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

*The German [[power metal]] band [[Blind Guardian]] released ''[[Nightfall in Middle-Earth]]'' in 1998, a [[concept album]] based upon ''The Silmarillion''. The album contains not only songs but also spoken passages narrating parts of the story.
*The German [[Drum &amp; Bass]] [[DJ]] [[Mathis Mootz]] released ''War of Sound'' in 2003, a [[glitch music|clicks n' cuts]] side project as m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which contains spoken word samples from an adaptation of ''The Silmarillion''.
*The Irish [[Celtic metal]] band [[Cruachan (band)|Cruachan]] released a song called the "Fall of Gondolin" on their 2004 album ''[[Pagan (album)|Pagan]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11286">[[File:Aristotle and Phyllis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Woodcut of Aristotle ridden by Phyllis by [[Hans Baldung]], 1515]]
The '''tale of Phyllis and Aristotle''' is a [[Cautionary tale|cautionary medieval tale]] about the triumph of a seductive woman, Phyllis, over the greatest male intellect, the ancient Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]]. It is one of several [[Power of Women]] stories from that time. Among early versions is the French '''''Lai d'Aristote''''' from 1220.

The story of the [[dominatrix]] and the famous intellectual was taken up by artists from the 12th century onwards, in media from stone sculpture in churches to panels of wood or ivory, textiles such as carpets and tapestries, engravings, oil paintings, brass jugs ([[aquamanile]]), and stained glass. Artists attracted to the theme include [[Hans Baldung]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], and [[Alessandro Turchi]].

==Story==
The tale varies in the telling, but the core of it is as follows: [[Aristotle]] advised his pupil [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] to avoid the [[Philip of Macedon|king]]'s seductive mistress, Phyllis, but was himself captivated by her. She agreed to ride him, on condition that she could play the role of [[dominatrix]]. Phyllis had secretly told Alexander what to expect, and he witnessed Phyllis proving that a woman's charms could overcome even the greatest philosopher's male intellect. Phyllis is also described as Alexander's mistress, or possibly wife, rather than his father's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Aristotle and Phyllis |url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/20121 |publisher=[[Art Institute Chicago]] |accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith2013"&gt;{{cite web |author=Smith, Justin E.

===Origins===
The story is said by the [[Louvre]] to derive from the German work &lt;!--''{{Aristoteles und Phyllis|de}}'' --&gt;by [[Jacques de Vitry]] in the 13th century.&lt;ref name=Louvre/&gt; The French work ''Le {{ill|Lai d'Aristote|fr}}'' (The Lay of Aristotle) is known from manuscripts dating from as early as 1220, attributed by scholars to either [[Henri d'Andeli]] or {{ill|Henri de Valenciennes|fr}}.&lt;ref&gt;Wathelet-Willem, Jeanne. "[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rbph_0035-0818_1953_num_31_1_2167_t1_0084_0000_3 Henri d'Andeli. ''Le lai d'Aristote'', publié d'après tous les manuscrits par Maurice Delbouille]", in ''Revue belge de philologie et d'histoire'', 1953, Vol. 31, n° 31-1, pp. 84–87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;François Zufferey, "Un problème de paternité: le cas d'Henri d'Andeli. II. Arguments linguistiques", ''Revue de linguistique romane'', n° 68, 2004, pp. 57–78, and "Henri de Valenciennes, auteur du Lai d'Aristote et de la Vie de saint Jean l'Évangéliste", in ''Revue de linguistique romane'', n° 69, 2004, pp. 335–358.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The source of the work was still contested in 2007 - see Mihai Cristian Bratu, ''L'Émergence de l'auteur dans l'historiographie médiévale en prose en langue française'', Ph.D., New York University, 2007, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1386, the English poet [[John Gower]] included a summary of the tale in his ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' (in English, unlike his other major works), a collection of stories of immoral love told in verse. It appears in the poem on [[Apollonius of Tyre]] (Book 8, 271–2018), where Gower quips that the philosopher's logic and syllogisms do not save him:&lt;ref name=DNBG&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Gower, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''I syh there Aristotle also'',&lt;br&gt;
:''Whom that the queene of Grece so''&lt;br&gt;
:''Hath [[bridle]]d, that in thilke time''&lt;br&gt;
:''Sche made him such a [[Syllogism|Silogime]],''&lt;br&gt;
:''That he foryat al his [[Logic|logique]];''&lt;br&gt;
:''Ther was non art of his [[Aristotle#Practical philosophy|Practique]],''&lt;br&gt;
:''Thurgh which it mihte ben excluded''&lt;br&gt;
:''That he ne was fully concluded''&lt;br&gt;
:''To love, and dede his obeissance''

Also in the 14th century, the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] John Herold wrote a Latin version of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sarton |first1=George |authorlink=George Sarton |title=Aristotle and Phyllis |journal=Isis |date=1930 |volume=14 |pages=8–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Latin and English"&gt;{{cite web|title=Phyllis and Aristotle|url=http://www2.latech.edu/~bmagee/201/phyllis/phyllis_w_img.htm|accessdate=1 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122070456/http://www2.latech.edu/~bmagee/201/phyllis/phyllis_w_img.htm|archivedate=22 November 2012|language=Latin|quote=ARISTOTLES, cum doceret Alexandrum ut se contineret ab accessu frequenti uxoris suae, quae erat pulcra valde, ne animum suum a communi providentia impediret, et Alexander ei acquiesceret, hoc advertens regina et dolens, coepit Aristotelem trahere ad amorem suum, quia multociens sola transibat cum pedibus nudis et dissoluto crine, ut eum alliceret.|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 15th century, it was featured in the German comedy ''Ain Spil van Maister Aristotiles'' (A play of Master Aristotle).&lt;ref name=Louvre/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Briski, Marija Javor |editor1=Winkelman, Johan H. |editor2=Wolf, Gerhard |title=Eine Warnung vor dominanten Frauen oder Behajung der Sinnenlust?

===Medieval===

The [[cautionary tale]] of the dominatrix who made a fool of the famous philosopher became popular across medieval Europe.&lt;ref name="Smith2013"/&gt; Medieval sculptors in Maasland created [[aquamanile]], jugs in the forms of scenes with human or other figures, depicting Phyllis and Aristotle. The story was depicted in a variety of media including stone, ivory, brass, carpet, [[tapestry]], and engravings.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Early Modern to Enlightenment===
Artists such as [[Hans Baldung]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], [[Bartholomeus Spranger]] and [[Jan Sadeler]] continued to exploit the theme, eventually with Phyllis entirely naked.&lt;ref name=Louvre&gt;{{cite web |title=Phyllis and Aristotle {{!}} The Triumph of Seduction over Intellect |url=https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/phyllis-and-aristotle |publisher=[[Louvre]] |accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alessandro Turchi]] called the woman [[Campaspe]], the mistress of Alexander. The works used media including engraving, stained glass, wood, and oil painting.

===Nineteenth and twentieth centuries===
Artists such as [[Julio Ruelas]] continued to adapt the Phyllis and Aristotle theme.
[[Oscar Kokoschka]] produced a version in 1913.&lt;ref name="Hayton2016"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hayton |first1=Darin |title=The Curious History of Phyllis on Aristotle |url=http://dhayton.haverford.edu/blog/2016/02/19/the-curious-history-of-phyllis-on-aristotle/#fn:72587 |accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tourgasm''''' is an American [[documentary television]] series that aired on [[HBO]] in 2006. The series follows the 2005 30-day 20-show [[stand-up comedy]] tour featuring [[Dane Cook]] and three of his best friends in the industry: [[Robert Kelly (comedian)|Robert Kelly]], [[Gary Gulman]], and [[Jay Davis]].

The documentary was created and directed by Dane Cook. Gary Gulman left the tour because of unknown reasons, but returned after a few dates. At each destination Dane Cook and fellow comedians play a game or do an activity before performing. Some of the events include horseback riding, riding [[Segway PT|Segway]] scooters, and visiting [[Niagara Falls]].

==Overview==
''Tourgasm'' is very similar in format to the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]/[[Comedy Central]] film and short series [[The Comedians of Comedy]]. The Comedians of Comedy consisted of comedians [[Patton Oswalt]], [[Maria Bamford]], [[Zach Galifianakis]], and [[Brian Posehn]]. Although similar in format both shows differ in audience numbers. The Comedians Of Comedy mostly play to small rock club audiences whereas Tourgasm plays to mostly college arena audiences.
''Tourgasm'' also appeared in select theatres in Canada during the month of September.

The song heard in the beginning and end credits is "[[Dimension (song)|Dimension]]" by Australian rock-band [[Wolfmother]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6367">'''Zhuang studies''' (or Zhuangology; [[Standard Zhuang]]: Cuenghhag; {{zh|t=壯學|s=壮学|p=Zhuàngxué}})  is an [[interdisciplinary]] intellectual field concerned with the [[Zhuang people]]&amp;nbsp;– their history, anthropology, religion, politics, [[Zhuang languages|languages]], and literature. The majority of such research is being carried out in the [[People's Republic of China]]. [[Huang Xianfan]] (黄现璠) is considered by many to be the father of Zhuang studies.&lt;ref&gt;Mo jun:《A Master of Zhuang Studies》.Guangxi's daily, on 3 September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Areas commonly included under this rubric include [[history]] of Zhuang, [[literature]] of Zhuang, [[art]] of Zhuang, [[music]] of Zhuang, [[language]] of Zhuang, [[sociology]] of Zhuang, political science of Zhuang, [[economics]] of Zhuang, [[folklore]] of Zhuang, and ethnomusicology of Zhuang. It may be compared to other ethnic groups studies disciplines, such as Tai studies and Yao studies. Zhuang studies is sometimes included within a broader regional area of focus including: "[[Lingnan]] studies", "[[Baiyue|Yue people]] studies","[[South Asia]] studies", or "[[ASEAN]] Studies".

==History==
Zhuang studies is a relatively new discipline.

Huang Xianfan may be considered as the first Zhuangologist and he did much to make Zhuang known in China. Since 1950, Huang Xianfan led the group making a largest and deepest investigation on ethnic history and traditional [[culture]] in [[Guangxi]] history. They had collected a lot of valuable materials and laid a foundation for further research on Zhuang ethnic social and historical culture.That was a very important beginning for later development of Zhuang ethnic research and establishment of Guangxi institute of ethnic studies. Therefore, the inception of Zhuang studies as an authentic academic discipline is thus associated with the  first  ethnologist Huang Xianfan de Zhuang who is considered as its founder to present day,&lt;ref&gt;Mo jun:《A Master of Zhuang Studies》.Guangxi's daily, on 3 September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; the other early zhuang studies of note being Huang Zengqing ([[Huang group]]'s member and the first archaeological researcher of the Guangxi) who in 1957 occupied the first chair for Zhuang's  [[archaeology]] studies in China and Zhou Zuoqiou, who was primarily the pioneering subject of the zhuang literature in [[Guangxi Normal University]].

The [[Huang group|Bagui School]] (The first ethnic school in [[China]] and pioneer is [[Huang Xianfan]]) was particularly significant for the development of the discipline since the early 1950s with Huang Xianfan, Huang Zengqing, Ban Xiouwen, Ou Yang Ruoxiou, Qin Cailuan, Qin Naichang, Qin Shengmin, He Longqun, Yu Shijie, Qin Deqing, Pan Qixu, Huang Hanjin and Zeng Chaoxiong.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnki.com.cn/Article/CJFDTOTAL-HSKX200808010.htm Chen Ji Sheng:《On Bagui School of Chinese Ethnology》, Guangxi Social Sciences，7th–11th Issues，2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doc88.com/p-405985601120.html  Chen Ji Sheng:《On Bagui School of Chinese Ethnology]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, the Guangxi government established the Guangxi institute of ethnic studies to promote Zhuang studies around China. In 1991 the Guangxi Zhuang Studies Society was established, and in April 1999 the first international Zhuang studies conference was held in Wuming with scholars from 8 different countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnki.com.cn/Article/CJFDTotal-MZYJ903.012.htm 郭爱民  :《壮学首届国际学术研讨会综述》, 《民族研究》 1999年03期]&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the last few decades in other countries the studies of the Zhuang have opened towards other disciplines, resulting in works with interdisciplinary approach. As examples of such open-minded Zhuang researcher we might mention the [[United States|American]] anthropologist Jeffrey Barlow, among others, who has done noted research and publications on lexical questions, about Zhuang culture  and the modern history of Zhuang. Others are [[Japanese people|Japanese]] anthropologist Chikada Sigeyuki, [[Australian]] anthropologist David Holm, and many more.
