      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30449">In [[linguistics]], an '''A-not-A question''' is a [[polar question]] that offers two opposite possibilities for the answer. This disjunctive question is predominantly found in [[Sinitic]] languages that offers a choice between an affirmative predicate and its negative counterpart. They are functionally regarded as a type of [[Yes–no question|"yes/no" question]] as they are very similar to a large extent. "A-not-A" questions are often interpreted as having a 'neutral' presupposition or is used in a neutral context.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Law, Ann (2001) A-not-A questions in Cantonese. UCLWPL 13, 295-318.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the person asking the A-not-A question does not assume the truth value of the proposition expressed by the question. The “A-not-A” question structure is commonly found in Chinese. The overarching principle is the contrasting of the positive and negative form of a premise side by side. A-not-A questions have a special interrogative type pattern of which YES/NO answers are not permitted, and instead requires an echo response. Therefore, to properly answer the query, the recipient must select the positive (affirmative form “A”) or negative (negative predicate form “not-A”) version and use it in the formation of their response.&lt;ref name="gasde" /&gt;

==A-not-A questions in English==

An example of an A-not-A question in English is in (1.a) "Are you happy or sad?". The response to this question must be an [[echo answer]], stating either "I am happy," or the correct alternative, "I am sad". In other words, this sentence is a [[leading question]], where the speaker has an expectation as to what the answer will be. In contrast, (1.b) "Are you happy or not?" is a neutral question where the answer to this can be [[yes and no|yes or no]] in response to the first and more explicitly stated alternative.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew S. Dryer. 2013. Position of Polar Question Particles. In: Dryer, Matthew S. &amp; Haspelmath, Martin (eds.) The World Atlas of Language Structures Online. Leipzig: Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.&lt;/ref&gt;

          (1.a) Q: ''Are you '''happy''' or '''sad'''?''
                A: ''I am happy''.
                   ''I am sad''.
 
          (1.b) Q: ''Are you '''happy''' or '''not (happy)'''?''
                A: ''Yes.''
                   ''No.'' 
A-not-A questions are not usually used in English, but the following example shows how A-not-A questions are answered.

          (2) Q: ''Did John eat beans or not?''
              A: ''(Yes,) John ate beans.''
                 ''(No,) John didn't eat beans.''
                 ''*Yes.''
                 ''*No.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Han|first=Chung-Hye|author2=Romero, Maribel|title=The Syntax of Whether/Q... or Questions: Ellipsis Combined with Movement|journal=Natural Language &amp; Linguistic Theory|date=August 2004|volume=22|issue=3|pages=527–564|doi=10.1023/b:nala.0000027674.87552.71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As seen in this example, simply answering "Yes" or "No" does not suffice as a response to the question. This question must be answered in the "A" or "not A" form. If this question was asked in the A-not-A pattern, its direct form would be "Did John eat or not eat the beans?"

==A-not-A questions in Mandarin==

In forming A-not-A questions, "A" must remain the same on both sides. "A" is essentially a variable which can be replaced with a grammatical particle such as a [[Modal verb|modal]], adverb, adjective, verb, or preposition.

=== Patterns of A-not-A question ===
In [[Chinese grammar|Chinese]], there are 6  attested patterns of A-not-A: A-not-A, AB-not-AB, A-not-AB, AB-not-A, a-not-A, and a-not-AB of which "A" stands for the full form of the predicate, "B" stands for the complement, and "a" stands for the first syllable of a disyllabic predicate.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clare|first=Li,|date=2017|title=The syntactic and pragmatic properties of a-not-a question in Chinese.|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13628|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

              you see here '''suit(able)'''-not '''suitable''' ''teaching fist''
              Is this suitable for your martial club?

=== Grammatical particles ===
A-not-A can be formed by a verb, an adjective, or an adverb,&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Y., &amp; Weiyun He, A. (2001). Dui bu dui as a pragmatic marker: Evidence from chinese classroom discourse. ''Journal of Pragmatics'', 33(9), 1441–1465&lt;/ref&gt; as well as modals.&lt;ref name="gasde" /&gt;

====Verb====
In the interrogative clause, A-not-A occurs by repeating the first part in the verbal group (with the option of an auxiliary) and the negative form of the particle is placed in between. However, this clause does not apply when using perfective in [[grammatical aspect|aspect]]. Instead, 沒有 ''meiyou'' is used to replace the repeated verb used in A-not-A form.&lt;ref&gt;Li, E. S. &amp; Yan, F. (2007). Enacting Relationships: Clause as Exchange. Systemic Functional Grammar of Chinese. 116-197.&lt;/ref&gt;

:V-NEG-V type:&lt;ref name=gasde&gt;Gasde, H. (2004). Yes/no questions and A-not-A questions in Chinese revisited. Linguistics - Interdisciplinary Journal of the Language Sciences, 42(2), 293-326. Retrieved October 13, 2013, from the Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete database&lt;/ref&gt;
Here, the verb ''go'' is "A", and there is no object.

          (9.a) 你'''去'''不'''去'''？         A: '''去'''/不'''去'''
                ni '''qu''' bu '''qu'''?         '''qu'''/bu '''qu'''
                you '''go''' not '''go'''        '''go'''/not '''go'''
                DP '''V'''-NEG-'''V'''           '''V'''/NEG '''V'''
                Are you '''going'''?       Yes/No

:V-NEG-V-Object type:&lt;ref name=gasde /&gt;
Here, the verb ''watch'' is "A", and while there is an object, the object is not included in "A", and is therefore not reduplicated.

          (9.b) 你'''看'''不'''看'''电影？                     A: '''看'''/不'''看'''
                ni '''kan''' bu '''kan''' dianying?              '''kan'''/bu '''kan'''
                you '''watch''' not '''watch''' movie            '''watch'''/not '''watch'''
                N '''V'''-NEG-'''V'''-N                          '''V'''/NEG '''V'''
                Will you '''watch''' the movie?            Yes/No

:V-Object-NEG type:&lt;ref name=gasde /&gt;
Here, the verb ''watch'' is "A", and while the object is included before NEG, it is not included in "A", and is therefore not reduplicated. Reduplication is optional here.

          (9.c) 你'''看'''电影不？                     A: '''看'''/不'''看'''
                ni '''kan''' dianying bu?                '''kan'''/bu '''kan'''
                you '''watch''' movie not                '''watch'''/not '''watch'''
                N  '''V'''-DP-NEG                        '''V'''/NEG '''V'''
                Will you '''watch''' the movie?          Yes/No

:V-Object-NEG-V type&lt;ref name=gasde /&gt;(debatable):
Here, the verb ''watch'' is "A", and while the object is included before NEG, it is not included in "A", and is therefore not reduplicated. "A" is reduplicated here.

          (9.d) 你'''看'''电影不'''看'''？                  A: '''看'''/不'''看'''
                ni '''kan''' dianying bu '''kan'''?           '''kan'''/bu '''kan'''
                you '''watch''' movie not '''watch'''         '''watch'''/not '''watch'''
                DP '''V'''-DP-NEG-'''V'''                     '''V'''/NEG '''V'''
                Will you '''watch''' the movie?         Yes/No

:Answers to (9.a), (9.b), (9.c), (9.d) must be in the form “V” or “not-V”

There is some debate amongst speakers as to whether or not 3.d. is grammatical, and Gasde argues that it is.

====Adjective or adverb====

:A-NEG-A type:&lt;ref name=gasde /&gt;
Here, the adjective ''good'' is "A", and it is reduplicated. The word ''ben'' is a [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifier]], which means it is a counter word for the Noun ''book.''

          (10.a) 这本书'''好'''不'''好'''？               A: '''好'''/不'''好'''
                 zhe ben shu '''hao''' bu '''hao'''?        '''hao'''/bu '''hao'''
                 this CL book '''good''' not '''good'''     '''good'''/not '''good'''
                 DP          '''A'''-NEG-'''A'''            '''A'''/NEG '''A'''
                 Is this book '''good'''?             Yes/No

:A-NEG type:&lt;ref name=gasde /&gt;
Here, the adjective ''good'' is "A", but it is not reduplicated.

          (10.b) 这本书'''好'''不？                      A: '''好'''/不'''好'''
                 zhe ben shu '''hao''' bu?                 '''hao'''/bu '''hao'''
                 this CL book '''good''' not               '''good'''/not '''good'''
                 DP           '''A'''-NEG                  '''A'''/NEG '''A'''
                 Is this book good?                  Yes/No

:Answers to (10.a), (10.b) must be in the form “A” or “not-A”

====Preposition====

:P-NEG-P type:&lt;ref name=tseng /&gt;  
Here, the preposition ''at'' is "A", and it is reduplicated.

          (11.a) 张三'''在'''不'''在'''图书馆？                  A: '''在'''/不'''在'''
                 Zhangsan '''zai''' bu '''zai''' tushuguan?        '''zai'''/bu '''zai'''
                 Zhangsan '''at''' not '''at''' library            '''at'''/not '''at'''
                 DP   '''P'''-NEG-'''P''' DP                       '''P'''/NEG '''P'''
                 Is Zhangsan '''at''' the library?           Yes/No

:P-NEG-P type:&lt;ref name=tseng /&gt;  
Here, the preposition ''at'' is "A", and it is not reduplicated.

          (11.b) 张三'''在'''图书馆不？                A: '''在'''/不'''在'''
                 Zhangsan '''zai''' tushuguan bu?        '''zai'''/bu '''zai'''
                 Zhangsan '''at''' library not           '''at'''/not '''at'''
                 DP  '''P'''-DP-NEG                      '''P'''/NEG '''P'''
                 Is Zhangsan '''at''' the library?       Yes/No

:Answers to (11.a), (11.b) must be in the form “P” or “not-P”

====Modal====
:M-NEG-M-V-Object type:&lt;ref name=gasde /&gt;
Here, the modal ''dare'' is "A" and it is reduplicated.

          (12.a) 你'''敢'''不'''敢'''杀鸡?                       A: '''敢'''/不'''敢'''
                 ni '''gan''' bu '''gan''' sha ji?                 '''gan'''/bu '''gan'''
                 you '''dare''' not '''dare''' kill chicken        '''dare'''/not '''dare'''
                 N '''M'''-NEG-'''M''' -V -DP                      '''M'''/NEG '''M'''
                 Do you '''dare''' kill chicken?             Yes/No

: The answer to (12.a) must be in the form “M” or “not-M”.

== A-not-A questions in Cantonese ==
Despite having the same negative marker as [[Standard Chinese]], "不" ''bat1'' is only used in fixed expressions or to give literacy quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cantonese: A Comprehensive Grammar.|last=Matthews|first=Stephen|last2=Yip|first2=Virginia|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=0415471311|location=London and New York|pages=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;  And only "唔" ''m4''  is used as a negative marker in A-not-A questions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One distinction in [[Cantonese]] when compared to Standard Chinese is that certain forms of A-not-A questions are not attested due to dialectal differences.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Patterns of A-not-A question ===

==== A-not-A form ====
Like it's Standard Chinese counterpart, this form is attested in Cantonese as shown by the sentence pair in (13).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
          (13.a) 佢哋     '''嚟'''  唔   '''嚟''' ？                  
                 keoidei '''lai'''  m   '''lai'''?        
                 they    '''come''' not '''come'''
                 Are they coming?

          (13.b) 他們   '''來'''   不  '''來'''？                  
                 tamen '''lai'''  bu  '''lai'''?        
                 they  '''come''' not '''come'''
                 Are they coming?

==== AB-not-AB form ====
As shown by (14.a), this is '''not''' an attested form in Cantonese, unlike the counterpart in Standard Chinese in (14.b).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
          (14.a) ??/*你   '''鐘意'''   ''音樂''  唔  '''鐘意'''    ''音樂''？                  
                 ??/*nei '''zungji jamok''' m   '''zungji''' ''jamok''?        
                 ??/*you '''like'''   ''music'' not '''like'''   ''music''
                 Do you like music?

          (14.b) 你  '''喜歡'''   ''音樂''    不  '''喜歡'''   ''音樂''？                  
                 ni  '''xihuan''' ''yinyue'' bu  '''xihuan''' ''yinyue''?        
                 you '''like'''   ''music''  not '''like'''   ''music''
                 Do you like music?

==== A-not-AB form ====
This form is '''only''' attested in Cantonese if the predicate is a monosyllabic word as shown by (15.a), compared to the Standard Chinese counterpart in (15.b).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
          (15.a) 你   '''返'''    唔   '''返'''     ''屋企''？                  
                 nei '''faan'''   m   '''faan'''   ''ukkei''?        
                 you '''return''' not '''return''' ''home''
                 Are you going home?

          (15.b) 你   '''回'''    不   '''回'''     ''家''？                  
                 ni  '''hui'''    bu  '''hui'''    ''jia''?        
                 you '''return''' not '''return''' ''home''
                 Are you going home?
A-not-AB is '''not''' attested in Cantonese if the predicate is a bi-syllabic word as shown by (16.a), unlike it's Standard Chinese counterpart in (16.b).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In such cases, Cantonese speakers usually use the form a-not-AB, like (19).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
          (16.a) ??/*你   '''鐘意'''唔'''鐘意'''      ''音樂''？                  
                 ??/*nei '''zungji'''-m-'''zungji''' ''jamok''?        
                 ??/*you '''like'''-not-'''like'''   ''music''
                 Do you like music?

          (16.b) 你   '''喜歡'''不'''喜歡'''       ''音樂''？                  
                 ni  '''xihuan'''-bu-'''xihuan''' ''yinyue''?        
                 you '''like'''-not-'''like'''    ''music''
                 Do you like music?

==== AB-not-A form ====
This form is '''only''' attested if the predicate is a monosyllabic word ("A") with an object ("B") as shown by the sentence pair with its Standard Chinese counterpart in (17).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
          (17.a) ?你   '''返'''    ''屋企''    唔  '''返'''？                  
                 ?nei '''faan'''   ''ukkei''   m  '''faan'''?        
                 you  '''return''' ''home''   not '''return'''
                 Are you going home?

          (17.b) 你  '''回'''      ''家''   不  '''回'''？                  
                 ni  '''hui'''    ''jia''  bu  '''hui'''?        
                 you '''return''' ''home'' not '''return'''
                 Are you going home?
Note that such forms of AB-not-A in monosyllabic word is used by the old generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=漢語方疑問範疇比較研究 Hanyu fangyan yiwen fanchou bijiao yanjiu [Comparative Study of Chinese Dialect Interrogative Question Category]|last=Shao|first=J. -M|publisher=Jinan Daxue Database|year=2010|isbn=|location=Guangzhou|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the predicate is a bi-syllabic word, then AB-not-A form is '''not''' attested as shown in (18.a), unlike it's Standard Chinese counterpart in (18.b).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
          (18.a) *你   '''鐘意'''   ''佢''   唔  '''鐘意'''?

                 you '''like'''   ''she''  not '''like'''
                 Do you like her?

==== a-not-A form ====
This form is attested in both Cantonese and its Standard Chinese counterpart as shown in the sentence pair in (18).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
          (18.a) 唔   知  你   '''方'''唔'''方便'''                  呢？

==In Korean&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ceong|first=Hailey Hyekyeong|title=The Syntax of Korean Polar Alternative Questions: A-not-A|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
There are three salient morphological varieties of A-not-A question in Korean.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; And like all A-not-A questions, the questions cannot be answered with Yes ("네" Ney) or No ("아니요" Anyo)

=== Pre-predicate negtation ===
Both "an" and "mos" can precede the predicate in A-not-A

==== An ====
"An", short form for "ani-", expresses simple negation
          (20)  Q: 지우-는    '''자-니'''      안  '''자-니'''?        A:  '''자'''-요    /안 '''자'''-요
                   ciwu-nun  '''ca-ni'''      an  '''ca-ni'''?           '''ca'''-yo    /an '''ca'''-yo
                   Jiwoo-TOP '''sleep-COMP''' not '''sleep-COMP'''       '''sleep'''-HON/not '''sleep'''-HON 
                   Is Jiwoo '''sleeping''' or not?                 (She) is '''sleeping'''/(She) isn’t '''sleeping'''

==== Mos ====
"Mos" expresses impossibility or inability
          (21)  Q: 민수  -는    학교  -에  '''갔-니'''          안     '''갔-니'''?        
                   Minsoo-nun  hakkuo-ey  '''ka-ss-ni'''      mos    '''ka-ss-ni'''?           
                   Minsoo-TOP  School-LOC '''go-PAST-COMP''' cannot  '''go-PAST-COMP'''       
                   Could Minsooo go to school or not?

=== Inherently-negative predicate ===
Korean has three negative predicates that can form A-not-A question, "molu-", "eps-", and "ani-"

==== Molu- ====
"Molu-" means "don't know"
          (22)  너-는   저    학생-을     '''아-니'''      '''모르-니'''?
                ne-nun  ce   haksayng-ul '''a-ni'''      '''molu-ni'''?    
                you-TOP that student-ACC '''know-COMP''' '''not.know-COMP'''       
                Do you know that student or not?

==== Eps- ====
"Esp-" means "do not have; do not exist"
          (23)  지우-는   집-에     '''있니'''     '''없니'''?
                ciwu-nun  cip-e    '''iss-ni'''  '''esp-ni'''?    
                Jiwoo-TOP home-LOC '''be-COMP''' '''not.be-COMP'''        
                Is Jiwoo at home or not?

==== Ani- ====
"Ani-" means "is not"
          (24)  이게 네   책-'''이-니'''     '''아니-니'''
                ike  ne  chayk-'''i-ni'''   '''ani-ni'''?    
                this you book-'''be-COMP''' '''not.be-COMP'''        
                IS this your book or not?

=== Negative modal auxiliary ===

==== Mal ====
Meaning "desist from", "mal" follows an affirmative polar question, and will occur instead of a reduplicated full verb that has a post predicate negation. This means that there is only one full verb in this type of A-not-A question.
          (25)  우리-는   '''잘-까'''            '''말-까'''?
                wili-nun '''ca-l-kka'''        '''mal-kka'''?    
                we-TOP   '''sleep-MOOD-COMP''' '''not.MOOD-COMP'''       
                Should or shouldn't we go to bed?      
However, the modal auxiliary verb "mal" is restricted in that it does not co-occur in predicative adjectives or the factual complementizer "ni". Moreover, with "mal" being a bound form, it cannot be the echo negative answer. Instead, the full negative verb will be provided as the answer, taking "an-" negation, as illustrated in (26)
          (26)  너-는    콘서트-에     '''갈-래'''         '''말-래'''?               A: *'''말-래'''            안    '''갈-래'''
                ne-nun  khonsethu-ey  '''ka-l-ay'''      '''mal-lay'''?                *'''mal-lay'''       /  an  '''ka-l-ay'''
                you-TOP concert-LOC   '''go-MOOD-COMP''' '''not.MOOD-COMP'''            '''not-MOOD-COMP''' /  not '''go-MOOd-COMP'''
                Are (you) going to the concert or not?                                       (I) am not going

==Analysis: the post-syntactic approach==
One analysis of the formation of the A-not-A construction is the post-syntactic approach, through two stages of M-merger. First, the A-not-A operator targets the MWd which is the head that is closest to it and undergoes lowering. Then, [[reduplication]] occurs to yield the surface form of the A-not-A question.&lt;ref name=tseng&gt;Tseng, W. H. K., &amp; Lin, T. H. J. (2009). A Post-Syntactic Approach to the A-not-A Questions. UST Working Papers in Linguistics, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, 107-139.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MWd vs SWd.png|thumb|Syntactic distinctions between morphosyntactic words (MWd) and subwords (SWd)]]

Tseng suggests A-not-A occurs post-syntactically, at the morphological level. It is movement that occurs overtly at the phonetic form, after the syntactic movement has occurred. A-not-A is a feature of T that operates on the closest, c-commanded morphosyntactic words (MWd), and not subwords (SWd). The elements that undergo post-syntactic movement are morphosyntactic words (MWd). A node X  is a MWd iff X is the highest segment and X is not contained in another X. A node X is a SWd if X  is a terminal node and not an MWd.&lt;ref name=tseng /&gt; The A-not-A operation is a MWd to MWd movement.

===Conditional criteria for grammatical A-not-A question derivation===

====A-not-A operator lowering====
The A-not-A operator is defined as an MWd. The A-not-A operator can only lower to a MWd which is immediately dominated by the [[Government and binding theory#Government|maximal projection]] that is also immediately dominated by the maximal projection of the A-not-A operator. An SWd cannot be the target for the A-not-A operator. In addition, if there is an intervening MWd or SWd between the A-not-A operator and its target, the A-not-A operation fails.&lt;ref name=tseng /&gt;

A-not-A operator lowering must satisfy four conditions:

# The A-not-A operator targets the closest MWd that is the [[X-bar theory|X’-theoretic head]] that it [[c-command]]s.
# Closeness of the head is qualified by: (i) The closest head is a X’-theoretic head of the maximal which is immediately dominated by the maximal projection of the A-not-A operator. (ii) The target must have overt phonological realization. 
# There is not any non-X’-theoretic head or SWd intervening between the A-not-A operator and its target. 
# Intervention is defined by c-command relation.

[[File:Grammatical a-not-a lowering, xihuan Lisi.png|thumb|right|Grammatical A-not-A operator lowering to adjacent MWd verb ''xihuan''. ''Xihuan'' is the closest X’-theoretical head that the A-not-A operator c-commands, thus satisfies lowering conditions.]]
[[File:Ungrammatical a-not-a lowering, xihuan Lisi.png|thumb|right|Ungrammatical A-not-A operator lowering to adjacent MWd ''hen''. Even though ''hen'' is the closest adjacent MWd, it is not an X’-theoretical head, thus lowering to it violates A-not-A lowering conditions]]

After lowering, the A-not-A operator triggers [[reduplication]] on the target node. The reduplication domain can be the first syllable of the targeted element, the targeted element itself, and the [[Government and binding theory#Government|maximal projection]] that contains the targeted element. Reduplication is linear and the A-not-A operator cannot skip the adjacent constituent to copy the next constituent.&lt;ref name=tseng /&gt;

====Reduplication of first syllable of adjacent MWd====
In first syllable reduplication, the A-not-A operator copies the first syllable of the adjacent MWd and moves the reduplicant, the copied syllable, to the left of the base MWd. Then the negation is inserted between the reduplicant and base to form a grammatical sentence. In fig. (1.a) The A-not-A operator copies the first syllable ''tao'' of the MWd ''taoyan''. The reduplicant ''tao'' is put at the left of the base ''taoyan'' and then the negative constituent ''bu'' is inserted in between. In fig. (1.b) ''*Zhangsan taoyan Lisi-bu-tao'' is ungrammatical because ''tao'' cannot be put to the right of the maximal projection VP, ''taoyan Lisi''.

          (8.a) 张三     '''讨'''不'''讨'''厌       李斯
                Zhangsan '''tao'''-bu-'''tao'''yan Lisi
                Zhangsan '''hate'''-not-'''hate''' Lisi
                Does Zhangsan hate Lisi or not?&lt;ref name=tseng /&gt;
 
          (8.b)*张三     '''讨'''厌    李斯不'''讨'''
               *Zhangsan '''tao'''yan Lisi-bu-'''tao'''
                Zhangsan hate   Lisi-not-hate&lt;ref name=tseng /&gt;

====Reduplication of adjacent MWd====
In MWd reduplication, the A-not-A operator copies the adjacent MWd and moves the reduplicant MWd overtly to the left of the base MWd or to right of the base maximal projection containing the MWd. Otherwise, the reduplicant can move [[Covert (linguistics)|covertly]], not spelled-out, to the right of the base maximal projection containing the MWd. The negation is then inserted between the reduplicant and base to form a grammatical sentence. In (9.a) the A-not-A operator copies the MWd ''taoyan''. The reduplicant ''taoyan'' is overtly put at the left of the base ''taoyan'' and then the negative constituent ''bu'' is inserted in between. In (9.b) the A-not-A operator copies the MWd ''taoyan''. The reduplicant ''taoyan'' is overtly put at the right of the base ''taoyan Lisi'' and then the negative constituent ''bu'' is inserted in between. In (9.c) the A-not-A operator copies the MWd ''taoyan''. The reduplicant ''taoyan'', not spelled-out here, is covertly put at the right of the base ''taoyan Lisi'' and then the negative constituent ''bu'' is inserted.

          (9.a) 张三     '''讨厌'''不'''讨厌'''        李斯
                Zhangsan '''taoyan'''-bu-'''taoyan''' Lisi
                Zhangsan hate-not-hate Lisi
                Does Zhangsan hate Lisi or not?&lt;ref name=tseng /&gt;
 
          (9.b) 张三     '''讨厌'''    李斯 不 '''讨厌'''
                Zhangsan '''taoyan''' Lisi bu '''taoyan'''
                Zhangsan hate Lisi not hate
                Does Zhangsan hate Lisi or not?&lt;ref name=tseng /&gt; 
 
          (9.c) 张三     '''讨厌'''    李斯 不 ('''讨厌)'''
                Zhangsan '''taoyan''' Lisi bu ('''taoyan''')
                Zhangsan hate Lisi not (hate)
                Does Zhangsan hate Lisi or not?&lt;ref name=tseng /&gt;

====Reduplication of the maximal projection containing adjacent MWd====
In maximal projection reduplication, the A-not-A operator copies the maximal projection that contains the adjacent MWd and moves the reduplicant either to the left or to the right of the base. The base may be just the MWd or the maximal projection containing the MWd. The maximal projection may be any XP (VP, AP, PP etc.). The negation is then inserted between the reduplicant and base to form a grammatical sentence. In (10.a) the A-not-A operator copies the maximal projection VP ''taoyan Lisi''. The reduplicant ''taoyan Lisi'' is put at the left of the base ''taoyan Lisi'' and then the negative constituent ''bu'' is inserted in between.

          (10.a) 张三      '''讨厌   李斯''' 不 '''讨厌    李斯'''
                 Zhangsan '''taoyan Lisi''' bu '''taoyan Lisi'''
                 Zhangsan hate Lisi not hate Lisi
                 Does Zhangsan hate Lisi or not?&lt;ref name=tseng /&gt;

In: Proceedings of ASLIB, London, 19–20 November&lt;/ref&gt;

''AUTINDEX'', resulting from research in [[information extraction]],&lt;ref&gt;Paul Schmidt, Thomas Bähr &amp; Dr.-Ing. Jens Biesterfeld &amp;Thomas Risse &amp; Kerstin Denecke &amp; Claudiu Firan, 2008: LINSearch. Aufbereitung von Fachwissen für die gezielte Informationsversorgung.

In: Proceedings Knowtech, Frankfurt&lt;/ref&gt; is a product of the Institute of Applied Information Sciences (IAI) which is a non-profit institute that has been researching and developing [[language technology]] since its foundation in 1985. IAI is an institute affiliated to [[Saarland University]] in Saarbrücken, Germany.

''AUTINDEX'' is the result of a number of research projects funded by the EU (Project BINDEX),&lt;ref&gt;[//www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2002/pdf/255.pdf]. Dieter Maas, Nuebel Rita, Catherine Pease, Paul Schmidt: Bilingual Indexing for Information Retrieval with AUTINDEX. LREC 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft and the German Ministry for Economy. Amongst the latter there are the projects LinSearch,&lt;ref&gt;[//www.l3s.de/AR07/layout/L3S-AR2007_screen.pdf]. Project LinSearch. P. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; and WISSMER,&lt;ref&gt;[//www.wissmer.info/index.php/de/]. Project Wissmer.&lt;/ref&gt; see also the reference to IAI-Website.&lt;ref&gt;[//www.iai-sb.de/forschung/content/view/67/89/]. Wissmer-Project on IAI-Site.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic functionality of AUTINDEX is the extraction of key words from a document to represent the semantics of the document.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Schmidt, Mahmoud Gindiyeh, Gintare Grigonyte: ''Language Technology for Information Systems.'' In: ''Proceedings of KDIR – The International Joint Conference on Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management Madeira.'' 6.–8. Oktober 2009, Portugal. 2009, S. 259 - 262.&lt;/ref&gt; Ideally the system is integrated with a [[thesaurus]] that defines the standardised terms to be used for key word assignment.&lt;br&gt; 
AUTINDEX is used in library applications (e.g. integrated in [[dandelon.com]]) as well as in high quality (expert) information systems,&lt;ref&gt;[//www.wti-frankfurt.de]. WTI Information system.&lt;/ref&gt; and in document management and content management environments. &lt;br&gt; 
 
Together with AUTINDEX a number of additional software comes along such as an integration with [[Apache Solr]] / [[Lucene]] to provide a complete [[information retrieval]] environment, a classification and [[categorisation]] system on the basis of a [[machine learning]] software that assigns domains to the document,&lt;ref&gt;Mahmoud Gindiyeh: Anwendung wahrscheinlichkeitstheoretischer Methoden in der linguistischen Informationsverarbeitung, Logos Verlag, Berlin, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and a system for searching with semantically similar terms that are collected in so called [[tag clouds]].&lt;ref&gt;[//www.wissmer.info]. Electro mobility information system.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Argumentum a fortiori''''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|ɑː|_|f|ɔːr|t|i|ˈ|oʊ|r|i}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Dictionary of Latin Words and Phrases|last=Morwood|first=James|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-19-860109-8|location=Oxford|pages=x–xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|eɪ|_|f|ɔːr|ʃ|i|ˈ|ɔːr|aɪ}}; [[Latin]]: "from a/the stronger [thing]") is a form of [[Argumentation theory|argumentation]] which draws upon existing [[confidence]] in a [[proposition]] to argue in favor of a second proposition that is held to be [[Logical consequence|implicit]] in the first. The second proposition may be considered "weaker," and therefore the arguer utilises the former as the "stronger" proposition from which the second proposition is deduced.

== Examples ==
{{Expand section|More examples would better illustrate this concept|date=May 2016|small=no}}
* If a person is dead (the stronger reason), then one can with equal or greater certainty argue ''a fortiori'' that the person is not [[Breathing#Control of breathing|breathing]]. "Being dead" trumps other arguments that might be made to show that the person is dead, such as "he is no longer breathing", therefore "he is no longer breathing" is an extrapolation from his being dead and is a derivation of this strong argument.
* If driving '''10&amp;nbsp;mph''' over the speed limit is punishable by a fine of $50, it can be inferred ''a fortiori'' that driving '''20&amp;nbsp;mph''' over the speed limit is also punishable by a fine of at least $50.
*If a teacher refuses to add '''5''' points to a student's grade, on the grounds that the student does not deserve an additional 5 points, it can be inferred ''a fortiori'' that the teacher will also refuse to raise the student's grade by '''10''' points.

==Usage==

In the [[English language]], the phrase ''a fortiori'' is most often used as an [[adverbial phrase]] meaning "by even greater force of logic" or "all the more so".{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

[[Bryan A. Garner]] has written in ''[[Garner's Modern American Usage]]'' that writers sometimes use ''a fortiori'' as an [[adjective]], which he says is "a usage to be resisted." As an example of this he gives the sentence, "Clearly, if laws depend so heavily on public acquiescence, the case of conventions is an ''a fortiori'' [read ''even more compelling''] one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Garner's Modern American Usage |last=Garner |first=Bryan A.|edition=3rd |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-538275-4 |page=28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''A fortiori'' arguments are regularly used in [[Halakha|Jewish law]] under the name [[Talmudical hermeneutics#Kal va-chomer (קל וחומר)|kal va-chomer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abramowitz|first1=Jack|title=Torah Methodology #1 – Kal v’Chomer|url=https://www.ou.org/torah/gemara/the-13-rules-of-rabbi-yishmael/methodology1/|website=Orthodox Union|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; literally "mild and severe", the mild case being the one we know about, while trying to infer about the more severe case.


In [[Indian logic|ancient Indian logic]] ([[nyaya]]), an inference derived from an ''a fortiori'' postulation is known as ''kaimutika'' or ''kaimutya nyaya'', from the words ''kim uta'' meaning "even more so."{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

In [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]], ''a fortiori'' arguments are proved utilising the methods used in ''[[qiyas]]'' (reasoning by [[analogy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sharī'a: Theory, Practice, Transformations |last=Hallaq |first=Wael |edition=1st |year=2009 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0521678749 |page=105 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}

===''A maiore ad minus''===
In [[logic]], '''''a maiore ad minus''''' describes a simple and obvious inference from a claim about a stronger entity, greater quantity, or general class to one about a weaker entity, smaller quantity, or specific member of that class:
* From general to particular ("What holds for all X also holds for one particular X")
* From greater to smaller ("If a door is big enough for a person two metres high, then a shorter person may also come through"; "If a canister may store ten litres of petrol, then it may also store three litres of petrol.")
* From the whole to the part ("If the law permits a testator to revoke the entirety of a bequest by destroying or altering the document expressing it, then the law also permits a testator to revoke the portion of a bequest contained in a given portion of a document by destroying or altering that portion of the document.")
* From stronger to weaker ("If one may safely use a rope to tow a truck [in the American usage], one may also use it to tow a car.")

===''A minore ad maius''===
The reverse, less known and less frequently applicable argument is '''''a minore ad maius''''', which denotes an inference from smaller to bigger.

==In law==

 “Argumentum a maiori ad minus” (from the greater to the smaller) –  works in two ways:

*  “who may more, all the more so may less” and relates to the statutory provisions that permit to do something

* “who is ordered more, all the more so, is ordered less”  and relates to the stautory provisions that order to do something
 
 “Argumentum a minori ad maius”  (from the smaller to the greater) – works in the way:

*  “who is forbidden less is all the more so forbidden the more” and relates to the statutory provisions that prohibit to do something.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski,   [http://www.aijcrnet.com/journals/Vol_7_No_1_March_2017/3.pdf The Scope of Application of Analogical Reasoning in Statutory Law]. American International Journal of Contemporary Research no. 1/2017 (v. 7), p. 28 footnote 90.&lt;/ref&gt; 

An ''a fortiori'' argument is sometimes considered in terms of analogical reasoning – especially in its legal applications. Reasoning ''a fortiori'' posits not mere that a case regulated by precedential or statutory law and an unregulated case should be treated alike since these cases  sufficiently resemble each other, but that the unregulated case deserves to be treated in the same way as the regulated case in a higher degree. The unregulated case is here more similar (analogues) to the regulated case than this case is similar (analogues) to itself.&lt;ref&gt;See Maciej Koszowski,   [http://www.aijcrnet.com/journals/Vol_7_No_1_March_2017/3.pdf The Scope of Application of Analogical Reasoning in Statutory Law].

In [[Mathematics]], the '''Atiyah conjecture''' is a collective term for a number of statements about restrictions on possible values of [[L2 cohomology|&lt;math&gt;l^2&lt;/math&gt;-Betti numbers]].

==History==
In 1976 [[Michael Atiyah]] introduced [[L2 cohomology|&lt;math&gt; l^2&lt;/math&gt; -cohomology]] of [[manifold]]s with a free co-compact [[group action|action]] of a discrete countable group (e.g. the [[universal cover]] of a compact manifold together with the action of the [[fundamental group]] by [[deck transformations]].) Atiyah defined also &lt;math&gt;l^2&lt;/math&gt;-Betti numbers as [[von Neumann dimension]]s of the resulting &lt;math&gt;l^2&lt;/math&gt;-cohomology groups, and computed several examples, which all turned out to be rational numbers. He therefore asked if it is possible for &lt;math&gt;l^2&lt;/math&gt;-Betti numbers to be [[irrational numbers|irrational]].

Since then, various researchers asked more refined questions about possible values of &lt;math&gt;l^2&lt;/math&gt;-Betti numbers, all of which are customarily referred to as "Atiyah conjecture".

==Results==
Many positive results were proven by [[Peter Linnell]]. For example, if the group acting is a free group,  then the &lt;math&gt;l^2&lt;/math&gt;-Betti numbers are integers.

The most general question open as of late 2011 is whether &lt;math&gt;l^2&lt;/math&gt;-Betti numbers are rational if there is a bound on the orders of finite subgroups of the group which acts. In fact, a precise relationship between possible denominators and the orders in question is conjectured; in the case of torsion-free groups this statement generalizes the [[group ring#Group rings over an infinite group|zero-divisors conjecture]]. For a discussion see
the article of B. Eckmann.

In the case there is no such bound, [[Tim Austin (mathematician)|Tim Austin]] showed in 2009 that &lt;math&gt;l^2&lt;/math&gt;-Betti numbers can assume transcendental values. Later it was shown that in that case they can be any non-negative real numbers.

{{Wiktionary| cadre}}

In political contexts a '''cadre''' ({{IPAc-en|uk|ˈ|k|ɑː|d|ər}} or {{IPAc-en|us|ˈ|k|æ|d|r|eɪ}}) consists of a small group of people. The word may also refer to a single member of such a group.

== Cadre policies ==
A cadre policy as a political mechanism may take one of two forms:

# Cadre deployment: The appointment by a government's governing party of a loyalist to an institution, as a means of circumventing public reporting-lines and bringing that institution under the control of the party, as opposed to the state. It involves the creation of a parallel power-structure to a constitution, so that party members answer first to the party and second to the public. In turn, that party advances its own interests ahead of those of the public.
# Cadre employment: Economic patronage dispensed to individuals, companies and agencies, by the government, not on merit but on the basis that they enjoy some political connection to the governing party.

Under cadre policies, every level of government often{{quantify|date=August 2016}} acts to reward loyalists with tenders and with government contracts.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}  The [[ANC|African National Congress]] government in [[South Africa]] commonly{{quantify|date=August 2016}} practises{{when|date=August 2016}} this form of [[tenderpreneur]]ship.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Together with [[Black Economic Empowerment]] policies, cadre policy is used{{by whom|date=August 2016}} to address the injustices of the former [[apartheid]] system in South Africa.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

'''Card stunts''' are a planned, coordinated sequence of actions performed by an audience, whose members raise cards that, in the aggregate, create a recognizable image.  The images they create can range widely and, through careful planning, the same cards can create a number of different images by systematically changing how the cards are held up.  Although card stunts are now performed at a variety of events ranging from [[sports]] to [[political rallies]], the card stunt is closely associated with [[American football]], particularly [[college football]], as well as [[football (soccer)]] where it can form part of a [[tifo]].  The [[North Korea]]n [[mass games]] [[Arirang Festival]], however, were the first to extend the card stunt to an art form, using flip-book cards to produce enormous hour-long animated sequences.

==By country==
===Mexico===
In Mexico's Heroic Military Academy, card stunts are done during various occasions, especially on September 13, the anniversary of the [[Battle of Chapultepec]], where a program is made in honor of this great battle.

===North Korea===
[[File:North korea mass games.jpg|right|thumb|Arirang Festival in North Korea]]
[[North Korea]]'s yearly [[Arirang Festival]], also known as the Mass Games, in [[Pyongyang]] capitalizes on [[choreography]] and card stunt to create sweeping images across the stadium. The festival is famed for the use of this technique as part of the iconographic propaganda art of the regime.

===Thailand===
[[File:Card stunt coloured card booklets from 66th CU-TU match.jpg|thumb|upright|Colored card booklets on a card stunt "plate"—the performers arrange the cards according to predesigned patterns in order to achieve a detailed aggregate image.]]
Card stunts ({{lang-th|การแปรอักษร}}) are regularly performed in certain sporting events in [[Thailand]]. They are especially associated with [[Jaturamitr Samakkee]] and [[Chula–Thammasat Traditional Football Match]], but are also employed in most school- and university-level sporting events where performances by the seated crowd often play an important part in the competition. In addition to plain colored cards, other objects such as umbrellas, flashlights and reflective surfaces are also used, and special plates with multiple tiles of colored card booklets are used to create detailed aggregate images.

The origin of such performances in Thailand can be traced back to [[Assumption College (Thailand)|Assumption College]], a member of the Jaturamitr, where in 1942, by the instruction of Cherd Sudara, a teacher at the school, differently-uniformed students in the audience arranged to form the school's initials. This developed into dynamic messages by physical movement of the crowd and later the covering and exposure of specific-colored clothing. The Chula–Thammasat Traditional Football Match adopted the card stunt in 1957; in the following years, cardboard cards became the predominant medium for the stunts. As a part of larger events, performances by Chulalongkorn University students were featured in the opening ceremony of the [[1974 Asian Games]] at Tehran, and eight thousand students from the Jaturamitr schools performed during the 1999 [[FESPIC Games]] in Bangkok.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Assumption Association|title=อัสสัมชัญประวัติ (Assumption College 115th anniversary commemoration)|publisher=Assumption Association|location=Bangkok|year=2003|pages=114–124|isbn=974-91380-1-5|language=Thai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
A 2006 [[Advertising in the Super Bowl|Super Bowl commercial]] by [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]], titled "The Wave", features a fictional card stunt using computer animation. The crowd at the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] performs a card stunt which shows a beer bottle being opened and poured around the stadium into a glass and subsequently being consumed one gulp at a time. The crowd finished with a collective "AHHHH".{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

In February, 2006 the [[Global Gillette|Gillette]] company sponsored the "World's Largest Card Stunt" at the [[NASCAR]] [[Daytona 500]] with over 118,000 fans set to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pginvestor.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=104574&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=818705&amp;highlight= |title=2006 Daytona 500 |publisher=Pginvestor.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022145119/http://www.pginvestor.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=104574&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=818705&amp;highlight= |archivedate=2006-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the singing of the [[Star-spangled banner|US National Anthem]], fans held up cards forming a patriotic design consisting of stars and stripes. Following the anthem, fans flipped the cards to display the "Gillette Fusion" logo. The card stunt was produced by [[Jacob Davis Productions|JacobDavis Productions]].

==Other performances==

===College traditions===
The first card stunt was performed by students at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] ("Cal") during the 1910 [[Big Game (football)|Big Game]] against rival [[Stanford University]], and consisted of two stunts in total: a picture of the [[Stanford Axe]] and a large blue "C" on a white background.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  While the card stunt is closely associated with college football, this first instance took place at a [[Rugby football|rugby]] match because all the major colleges and universities on the West Coast of the United States had briefly dropped football in favor of rugby during the early 1910s.  As universities switched back, students brought the card stunts with them and by that time they became a national phenomenon associated with college football.  While the tradition has subsided at many American colleges and universities, Cal maintains the tradition through the UC Rally Committee. 

"Block I", the football student cheering section at the [[University of Illinois]], also maintains the tradition by performing a 2000-member, 12-image card stunt during halftime of each home football game.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

Card stunts have been the object of several famous college pranks, including the [[Great Rose Bowl Hoax]] and the [[2004 Harvard-Yale Prank]].

===Olympics===
[[File:RIAN archive 488322 Flag-bearers of states-participants of the XXII Summer Olympic Games cropped.jpg|thumb|Misha in 1980, Moscow]]

At the opening and closing ceremonies of Moscow [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]] at the Olympic Stadium (now [[Luzhniki Stadium]]), some 6,800 Soviet Army cadets in front of the presidium created many images using this technique.  The cadets practiced some six months to perfect their card formations.  One of the most memorable was a [[Misha]] with a tear dropping, during the closing ceremonies of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&amp;OLGY=1980 |title=Moscow 1980 Summer Olympics &amp;#124; Olympic Videos, Photos, News |publisher=Olympic.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Secrets of the Olympic Ceremonies" by Myles A.

The opening ceremony of the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] boasted the single, biggest card stunt at the time.  85,000 spectators found colored cards in their seats (which had been preassigned by computer); and at one point the ceremony, just before the various national delegations marched in, all 85,000 spectators flashed their cards to form supposedly all the flags of the nations in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&amp;OLGY=1984 |title=los-angeles 1984 Summer Olympics &amp;#124; Olympic Videos, Photos, News |publisher=Olympic.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there is question today whether 140 flags were indeed flashed because only 87 sections at that time could actually accommodate only 87 flag sections.  {{CN|date=June 2015}}

A similar stunt was tried at the Vancouver 2010 Winter Games opening ceremony as well, which featured 82 nations vs. Los Angeles' supposed 140 images flashed, and 55,000 spectators in Vancouver vs. the 85,000 cards ordered and used in 1984.  The stunt at Vancouver was performed in a dimly lit setting (again, as the national delegations started to march in), whereas LA's was performed in broad sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;"Secrets of the Olympic Ceremonies" by Myles A. Garcia, MAG Publishing, (c) 2010, footnote, page 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony]], an effect similar to a card stunt was achieved by mounting a small panel with LED lights next to every spectator seat in the stadium, effectively turning the entire seating area into a big display for the audience seated on the opposite side.  The show's producers, rather than the audience, controlled the light panels.   

Card stunts involving large numbers of people have become a standard part of similar celebratory gatherings in countries such as [[North Korea]].

== Fiction ==
In 1958, the [[science fiction]] author [[Arthur C. Clarke]] published "A Slight Case of Sunstroke" (also called "The Stroke of the Sun"), a short story in which a diabolical card stunt was used to kill an unpopular [[soccer referee]].&lt;ref name=Valia01&gt;{{cite web|last=Valia|first=Tinkoo|title=Arthur C Clarke's "A Slight Case of Sunstroke" aka "The Stroke of the Sun" (short story, free): An innocent murder weapon|url=http://variety-sf.blogspot.com/2007/09/arthur-clarkes-slight-case-of-sunstroke.html|publisher=Variety SF|accessdate=2011-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the narrative, a large number of hostile spectators aim reflective program covers at the unfortunate umpire, who is stricken with [[heat prostration]] in the resulting [[solar furnace]].

'''Chimila''' (Shimizya) is a [[Chibchan language]] of [[Colombia]], spoken by the [[Chimila people|Chimila]]. At one time the [[Malibu languages]] were grouped with Chimila, before Chimila was considered a Chibchan language.

The "Cesar" name of the [[Cesar River]] and [[Cesar Department]] is an adaptation from the Chimila indigenous word ''Chet-tzar'' or ''Zazare'' ("calm water") into [[Spanish language|Spanish]], in reference to the [[Cesar River]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/musica/musabo/pag09-17.htm LABLAA - Luis Galvis: Don Gonzalo] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Guatapurí'' derives from the Chimila for "cold water", and provides the name of the [[Guatapurí River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} Marcos Fidel Vega Seña (2005), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vp2UXZwctVEC&amp;pg=PA14 Vallenato: Cultura y sentimiento]'', U.

'''Colorado River Numic''' (also called '''Ute''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|juː|t}}, '''Southern Paiute''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|aɪ|juː|t}}, '''Ute–Southern Paiute''', or '''Ute-Chemehuevi''' {{IPAc-en|tʃ|ɛ|m|ᵻ|ˈ|w|eɪ|v|i}}), of the [[Numic languages|Numic branch]] of the [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]] language family, is a [[dialect chain]] that stretches from southeastern [[California]] to [[Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;Mithun (1999:542)&lt;/ref&gt; Individual dialects are Chemehuevi, which is in danger of extinction, Southern Paiute (Moapa, Cedar City, Kaibab, and San Juan subdialects), and [[Ute dialect|Ute]] (Central Utah, Northern, White Mesa, Southern subdialects). According to the ''[[Ethnologue]]'', there were a little less than two thousand speakers of Colorado River Numic Language in 1990, or ca. 40% out of an ethnic population of 5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ute|title=Ethnologue report for language code:ute|publisher=Ethnologue|accessdate=2009-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Southern Paiute dialect has played a significant role in [[linguistics]], as the background for a famous article by linguist [[Edward Sapir]] and his collaborator [[Tony Tillohash]] on the nature of the [[phoneme]].&lt;ref name="sapir1933"&gt;{{cite journal|language=French|last=Sapir|first= Edward|year= 1933 |title=La réalité psychologique des phonèmes (The psychological reality of phonemes) |journal= Journal de Psychologie Normale et Pathologique}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialects==
The three major dialect groups of Colorado River are Chemehuevi, Southern Paiute, and [[Ute dialect|Ute]], although there are no strong isoglosses. The threefold division is primarily one of culture rather than strictly linguistic. There are, however, three major phonological distinctions among the dialects:
:*In Southern Paiute and Ute, initial /h/ has been lost: Chemehuevi /hipi/ 'drink', other dialects /ipi/ 'drink'.
:*In Ute, nasal-stop clusters have become voiceless geminate stops: Ute /pukku/ 'horse, pet', other dialects /puŋku/.
:*In Ute, the mid back round vowel /o/ has been fronted to /ö/: Ute /söö-/ 'lungs', other dialects /soo-/.

There are no strong isoglosses between Southern Paiute and Ute for the changes but an increasing level of change, as one moves from Kaibab Southern Paiute (0% of nasal-stop clusters have changed) to Southern Ute (100% of nasal-stop clusters have changed).

==Phonology==
Consonant and vowel charts for the westernmost and easternmost dialects are given.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chemehuevi: A Grammar and Lexicon|last=Press|first=Margaret L.|publisher=University of California Press|year=1979|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ute Reference Grammar|last=Givon|first=T.|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morphology==
The Colorado River Numic language is an [[agglutinative]] language, in which words use suffix complexes for a variety of purposes with several [[morpheme]]s strung together.

{{Linguistics}}
'''Constraint-based grammars''' can perhaps be best understood in contrast to [[generative grammar]]s. A generative grammar lists all the transformations, merges, movements, and deletions that can result in all [[well-formedness|well-formed]] sentences, while constraint-based grammars, take the opposite approach, allowing anything that is not otherwise constrained. "The grammar is nothing but a set of constraints that structures are required to satisfy in order to be considered well-formed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pollard|first1=Carl|title=The nature of constraint-based grammar|url=http://isli.khu.ac.kr/journal/content/data/15/1.pdf|website=11th Pacific Asian conference on language, information and computation}}&lt;/ref&gt; "A constraint-based grammar is more like a data base or a knowledge representation system than it is like a collection of algorithms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pollard|first1=Carl|title=The nature of constraint-based grammar|url=http://isli.khu.ac.kr/journal/content/data/15/1.pdf|website=11th Pacific Asian conference on language, information and computation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of such grammars include

A '''dummy candidate''' is a [[candidate]] who stands for [[election]], usually with no intention or realistic chance of winning.

A dummy candidate can serve any of the following purposes:

* In [[instant-runoff voting]], a dummy candidate may direct preferences to other candidates in order to increase the serious candidate's share of the [[vote]].
* A dummy candidate may be used by a serious candidate to overcome limits on advertising or campaign financing. For example, in India, there have been cases of serious candidates fielding multiple dummy candidates to distribute their poll expenses. The expenses are directed towards the campaign of the serious candidate, but shown to the election commission under the dummy candidates' names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.firstpost.com/politics/ec-warns-of-strict-action-against-dummy-candidates-1169121.html |title=EC warns of strict action against dummy candidates |date=2013-10-13 |publisher=Firstpost }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dummy candidates with names similar to that of a more established candidate may be fielded by political parties to confuse the voters, and cut that candidate's vote share.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/complaint-against-dummy-candidate-for-mislea/453191/ Complaint against dummy candidate for misleading people]&lt;/ref&gt; The dummy candidate's name also may be deceptively similar to that of a retiring incumbent, a former candidate or officeholder, or even a deceased former candidate or officeholder.  (The [[Eddie Murphy]] film ''[[The Distinguished Gentleman]]'' was somewhat based on this premise.) For example, in the [[Indian general election, 2014|2014 Indian general elections]], there were seven candidates named Chandu Lal Sahu and another four named Chandu Ram Sahu in the [[Mahasamund (Lok Sabha constituency)|Mahasamund]]. The serious candidate &amp;ndash; Chandu Lal Sahu of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] &amp;ndash; received 503,514 votes, but his margin of win was just 1,217 votes. The dummy candidates received the votes intended for him, with one of them finishing third in the constituency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1140525/jsp/7days/18379590.jsp |title=What's in a name? |author=V. Kumara Swamy |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=2014-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To solve this problem, the Election Commission of India is designing [[Indian voting machines|Electronic Voting Machines]] with candidates' photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/candidate-photos-on-evms-soon-to-counter-duplicates/article1-1264048.aspx |title=
Soon, more voting machines will have candidate photos |date=2015-09-15 |newspaper=Hindustan Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A dummy candidate may serve as a placeholder for a party in a [[Primary election|primary]] and then withdraw after winning the primary, allowing the leadership of the party an opportunity to nominate the candidate they really desire to fill their line for the [[general election]].
* Dummy candidates can also result from candidates withdrawing from a particular race, but being unable to pull their name off the ballot, remaining listed as a choice.

'''ECLR-attributed grammars''' are a special type of [[attribute grammar]]s.

They are a variant of LR-attributed grammars where an equivalence relation on inherited attributes is used to optimize attribute evaluation. EC stands for equivalence class. Rie is based on ECLR-attributed grammars. They are a superset of [[LR-attributed grammar]]s.

'''Ghanaian English''' is a variety of [[English language|English]] spoken in [[Ghana]]. English is the official language of Ghana, and is used as a [[lingua franca]] throughout the state.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;http://www.statsghana.gov.gh/docfiles/2010phc/Census2010_Summary_report_of_final_results.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; English is the most used of the 11 official languages spoken in Ghana.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Demographics ==
Of the more than 28 million people in Ghana, more than half of the population uses English, and most use English exclusively.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Most [[Primary school|primary]] and [[Secondary school|secondary]] school classes are taught in English only.

== Phonology ==
Due to Ghana's colonial history, Ghanaian English most closely resembles [[British English]], although it is wildly varied and deviates from the standard in many ways based on location and context.

In contrast to the twelve [[monophthong]]al vowels of [[Received Pronunciation]], Ghanaian English has only seven, an attribute shared with other forms of [[African English]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56880203|title=A handbook of varieties of English : a multimedia reference tool.|date=2004|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|others=Schneider, Edgar W. (Edgar Werner), 1954-, Kortmann, Bernd, 1960-|isbn=3110175320|location=Berlin|oclc=56880203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghanaian English exhibits several mergers including the fleece-kit, goose foot, and thought-cloth mergers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In Ghanaian English, the [[voiceless alveolo-palatal sibilant]] [ɕ] is the usual realization of the phoneme {{IPA|/ʃ/}} (as in "'''sh'''ip" and "'''ch'''icago"), the [[voiceless alveolo-palatal affricate]] [tɕ] is the usual realization of {{IPA|/tʃ/}} (as in "'''ch'''eese" and ""wa'''tch'''ing") and the [[voiced alveolo-palatal affricate]] [dʑ] is the usual realization of {{IPA|/dʒ/}} (as in "'''g'''eneral" and "ma'''g'''ic").&lt;ref name="huber"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Huber|2004|p=859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="634">In [[telephone|telephony]], a call may be placed on '''hold''', in which case the connection is not terminated but no verbal communication is possible until the call is removed from hold by the same or another extension on the [[key telephone system]].  [[Music on hold]] or [[on hold messaging]] may be played for the caller while the call is on hold, especially if the call has been placed to a [[customer service]] center.  Alternatives to placing a caller on hold include virtual hold or virtual queuing solutions that allow scheduled or queue-based callbacks to be made to the caller.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1550">The '''International Cognitive Linguistics Association''' (ICLA) is a linguistics association that sponsors conferences, major journals and books for relevant research in the field of linguistics. It is involved in the publication of research, a website and discussion forum, fosters regional affiliates, and provides a community for researchers in [[cognitive linguistics]] and others interested in such research&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cognitivelinguistics.org/about.shtml About ICLA]. cognitivelinguistics.org. Retrieved July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The ICLA is affiliated, among others,  with the UK Cognitive Linguistics Association (UK-CLA) [http://www.uk-cla.org.uk/] the Slavic Cognitive Linguistics Association (SLCA)[http://languages.uchicago.edu/scla/] and [[Polish Cognitive Linguistics Association]].

The association is multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary in order to include human cognitive and cultural models.  It has links with cognitive and [[social psychology]], evolutionary and [[cultural anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[philosophy]], and [[human interaction]].

== Conferences ==
The ICLA holds official ICLA conferences. The first ICLA conference was held in June 1989 in Duisburg, Germany. Subsequent conferences were held at universities such as the University of California, Free University of Amsterdam, Stockholm University, and there is an upcoming event in 2011, Xi'an, China.

&lt;/div&gt;

'''Inverted nun''' ({{Hebrew|נו"ן מנוזרת}} "isolated nun" or {{Hebrew|נו"ן הפוכה}} "inverted nun" or "{{Hebrew|׆}}" in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]&lt;ref name="sofer"&gt;[http://www.sofer.co.uk/html/nun_hafucha.html Nun hafucha described at sofer.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a rare [[glyph]] used in classical Hebrew. Its function in the ancient texts is disputed. It takes the form of the letter [[Nun (letter)|nun]] in [[mirror image]], and appears in the [[Masoretic]] text of the [[Tanakh]] in nine different places:&lt;ref name="IOS"&gt;[http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n2714.pdf Universal Multiple-Octet Coded Character Set: International Organization for Standardization]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Twice in the [[Book of Numbers]], 10:35&amp;ndash;36: the two verses are delineated by inverted nuns.
* Seven times in chapter 107 of the [[Book of Psalms]].

The images at right show three common variants of the inverted nun &amp;ndash; vertically flipped, horizontally flipped, and Z-shaped. Other renderings exist, corresponding to alternative interpretations of the term "inverted".&lt;ref name="kasher"&gt;e.g. Menahem Kasher, ''Torah Sheleima'', v. 29&lt;/ref&gt; It may also occur with a dot above.&lt;ref name="sil"&gt;[http://scripts.sil.org/CMS/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;item_id=ReversedNun_intheBHS Reversed Nun in the BHS]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occurrence and appearance ==

Inverted nuns are found in nine passages of the [[Masoretic Text]] of the [[Bible]]. The exact shape varies between different manuscripts and printed editions. In many manuscripts, a reversed nun is found—referred to as a "nun hafucha" by the [[Masoretes]]. In some earlier printed editions, they are shown as the standard nun upside down or rotated, because the printer did not want to bother to design a character to be used only nine times. The recent scholarly editions of the Masoretic text show the reversed nun as described by the Masoretes. In some manuscripts, however, other symbols are occasionally found instead. These are sometimes referred to in rabbinical literature as "simaniyot" (markers).

In the [[Torah]], the inverted nuns frame the text

The nuns are generally positioned close to, but not touching, the first and last words of the couplet.&lt;ref name="ganzfried16"&gt;e.g. Ganzfried, ''Keset ha-Sofer'', ch. 16 [http://www.hasoferet.com/ritual/keset/chapter16.shtml English translation]&lt;/ref&gt; They are supposed to be positioned between the gaps in between the paragraphs, but there is disagreement as to how this should be done.&lt;ref name="ganzfried15"&gt;e.g. Ganzfried, ''Keset ha-Sofer'', ch. 15 [http://www.hasoferet.com/ritual/keset/chapter15.shtml English translation]&lt;/ref&gt; Some texts invert the existing nuns in the Torah text and don't add inverted nuns before and after it.&lt;ref name="seforim"&gt;[http://seforim.blogspot.com/2006/06/inverted-nuns.html The Seforim blog: Inverted Nuns]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rashi]]'s commentary states that the name of the city of [[Haran (biblical place) |Haran]] at the end of the Torah portion [[Noach (parsha)|Noach]] also occurs with an inverted nun, but this is not found in existing texts.&lt;ref name="Genesis Chapter 11 English Bible with Rashi"&gt; [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8175/showrashi/true/jewish/Chapter-11.htm, Genesis Chapter 11 English Bible with Rashi - Chabad.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rabbinic basis ==

The Babylonian Talmud records in the tractate Shabbath, folio 116a, that the markings surrounding Numbers 10:35&amp;ndash;36 were thought to denote that this 85 letter text was not in its proper place. One opinion goes so far as to say that it would appear in another location which discusses the order of tribal column, with the position of the Ark already stated there.

The 85-letter text found between the nuns is also said to be denoted because it is the model for the least number of letters which constitute a 'text' which one would be required to save from fire due to its holiness. It also suggests that the inverted nuns may suggest the Hebrew word נֵר ''ner'', meaning 'a light'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oztorah.com/2007/05/inverted-nun-bhaalotcha/ Inverted Nun – B'ha'alot'cha]&lt;/ref&gt;


The tractate [[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]] in the [[Talmud]] says regarding the inverted nuns:

{{quote|It is taught in a [[baraita]]: "{{lang|he|ויהי בנסוע הארון ויאמר משה}}" &amp;ndash; The Holy One, blessed be He, placed signs above and below this portion, to say that this is not its place. Rabbi &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Judah haNasi]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; said: It was not for this reason, but rather because it is an important book in and of itself.|[[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]] 115b&amp;ndash;116a}}

[[Sifrei]] explains these "signs":
{{quote|It was marked with points above and below.|[[Sifrei]]}}&lt;ref name="jafi"&gt;[http://www.jafi.org.il/education/torani/nehama/behaalo.html Iyunim &amp;ndash; Weekly insights on the Parasha with commentaries by Nehama Leibovitz, za"l]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Talmud continues, stating that as this section is a separate book, the portions of Numbers before and after it also count as books and thus the [[Torah]] contains seven books in total:&lt;ref name="sofer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jafi" /&gt;
{{quote|For R. Shemuel bar Nahmani said in the name of R. Yohanan: “She hath hewn out her seven pillars” (Proverbs 9,1) &amp;ndash; these are the seven books of the Pentateuch; according to whom? According to Rabbi &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Judah Hanasi&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;|[[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]] 115b&amp;ndash;116a}}
[[Bar Kappara]] is known to have considered our Torah as composed of 7 volumes in the Gemara "The seven pillars with which Wisdom built her house (Prov. 9:1) are the seven Books of Moses". Genesis, Exodus and Leviticus and Deuteronomy as we know them but Numbers was really 3 separate volumes Num 1:1 to Num 10:35 followed by Number 10:35&amp;ndash;36 and the third text from there to the end of Numbers. {quote|R. Shimon Ben Gamliel says: This section will be uprooted from its place and written in its rightful place in the future (but for now it is in its correct location). Why is it written here? So as to separate between first and second retribution [3]. Second retribution is "and the people grumbled". First retribution is "and they traveled from the mountain of G-d (i.e., they eagerly run away from G-d's presence)". Where is it its appropriate place? Rav Ashi says: "In the section dealing with the disposition of the Israelites according to their banners and their travelling arrangements" (Numbers 1:52-2:34, Shabbath 116a).

The [[Mishnah]], in tractate [[Yadayim]], states:
{{quote|A book that became erased and there remain in it 85 letters, like the section:and it was when the Ark was carried", renders hands impure|[[Yadaim]] 3,5}}

According to [[Midrash]]:
{{quote|These verses were incorporated in to the Torah from the prophecy of Eldad and Meidad. Their prophecy so remained and was explained by the Ezekiel: "So says the Lord, G-d. Are you the one of whom I have spoken in the days of yore through prophets of Israel. And some say that there was a hidden book (of prophecy).|Midrash Chaseiros V'Yoseiros}}
{{quote|The two nuns are similar to khaf and reish &amp;ndash; to say that they are Ach and Rak (Only and however). Ach and Rak always exclude &amp;ndash; to say that this is not the place of this section. Rebbi says because it is a book of its own.|(Lekach Tov)}}

[[Maharshal]] ruled that the Talmud only mandates the usual break for a [[parashah]] section, and Torah scrolls with extra letters are ''passul'' (unfit for ritual use).&lt;ref name="seforim" /&gt; [[Rabbi Yechezkel Landau]], however, defends the custom, stating that punctuation such as inverted nuns don't count as extra letters and thus don't invalidate the scroll.&lt;ref name="seforim" /&gt;

== Elsewhere ==
Inverted nun appears to have been used as a scribal or editorial annotation or text-critical mark.&lt;ref name="sil" /&gt;

The primary set of inverted nuns is found surrounding the text of Numbers 10:35&amp;ndash;36. The Mishna notes that this text is 85 letters long and dotted. This demarcation of this text leads to the later use of the inverted nun markings. [[Saul Lieberman]] demonstrated that similar markings can be found in ancient Greek texts where they are also used to denote 'short texts'.&lt;!--is this in I.Yavin, Introduction to Tiberian Masorah, Masoretic studies 5, Scholar's Press, 1980 ?--&gt; Greek sources, especially Alexandrian ones, refer to the sign as [[Antisigma (Claudian letter)|reversed sigma]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=U1UfMyO-RiEC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=inverted+nun&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cxHGDs0AvK&amp;sig=mUdvA1-w9xH_Np7DaLSNmFHfwEI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bvCRSu_SKZTUsgPajJAM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5#v=onepage&amp;q=inverted%20nun&amp;f=false Textual criticism of the Hebrew Bible, pp. 54&amp;ndash;55]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unicode ==
The inverted nun is not part of any word, and is never pronounced; thus it is classed as [[punctuation]] and not a letter.&lt;ref name="IOS"/&gt;

'''Itonama''' is a [[moribund language|moribund]] [[language isolate]] spoken in the Amazonian lowlands of north-eastern [[Bolivia]]. Greenberg’s (1987) classification of Itonama as Paezan, a sub-branch of Macro-Chibchan, remains unsupported and Itonama continues to be considered an isolate or unclassified language.

== Morphology ==
Itonama is a [[polysynthetic]], head-marking, verb-initial language with an accusative alignment system along with an inverse subsystem in independent clauses, and straightforward accusative alignment in dependent clauses.

Nominal morphology lacks case declension and adpositions and so is simpler than verbal morphology (which has body-part and location incorporation, directionals, evidentials, verbal classifiers, among others).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Who did what to whom in Magdalena |last= Crevels |first= M |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= 3 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Jenkins''' (died 1710) was a [[Cornish people|Cornish]] scholar who left some verses giving moral advice on child raising and marriage in the [[Cornish language]]. 
In his day he was considered a learned scholar of the [[Cornish language]]. Little of his work has survived.

==Life==

James Jenkins resided in the [[Manor of Alverton]], near Penzance.{{sfn|Talat|2007|p=10}}
[[Edward Lhuyd]] (1660–1709), the Celtic philologist, spent four months in 1700 in Cornwall learning Cornish as the basis for his planned Cornish-English vocabulary. 
His main informants included James Jenkins, [[John Keigwin]], the Reverend Henry Ustick and [[Nicholas Boson]].{{sfn|Mills|2002|p=32}}
Lhuyd published a phonetically spelled transcript of Jenkins' verses.{{sfn|Mills|2002|p=82}}
James Jenkins died in 1710.{{sfn|Talat|2007|p=10}}
Although little of his work has survived, during his lifetime Jenkins was considered one of the most learned of writers in Cornish.{{sfn|Hardie|2000|p=44–45}}
In 1712 [[John Boson]] wrote an ''Elegy for James Jenkins'', attached to a letter to [[William Gwavas]], and an ''Epitaph for James Jenkins'', which William Gwavas rewrote.{{sfn|Talat|2007|p=14}}
The elegy was titled ''En levra coth po vo Tour Babel gwres''.{{sfn|Mills|2002|p=104}}

==Work==

Jenkins wrote his verses of moral advice around 1700.{{sfn|Talat|2007|p=10}}
In total there are about three dozen lines. 
They may be two separate poems, but [[Henry Jenner]] considered that they formed a long poem, or "irregular ode", of five stanzas.{{sfn|Murdoch|1993|p=138}}
The Gwavas manuscript has a complete copy, and this has been printed with a translation by Pryce and Davies Gilbert. 
A note in the Price edition says Tonkin had it from Lhuyd, who had it from Gwavas, who made the translation.
The song is in idiomatic late Cornish, and the spelling is erratic.{{sfn|Jenner|1904|p=14}}

The song starts with ''Ma leeas gwreage, lacka vel zeage,'' and is a series of moral platitudes on marriage and child raising. 
It has five stanzas of five or six lines each.{{sfn|Jenner|1904|p=14}}
The first part, or the first poem, consists of nine short rhymed couplets. 
They compare between good and bad wives, and thoughtful and thoughtless children.
The second part, or second poem, is written in longer couplets.
It advises a wise man on how to treat a good wife, and advises him to build a solid house.{{sfn|Murdoch|1993|p=138}}
The first part may be translated,{{sfn|Hardie|2000|p=45}}
{{blockquote|
There are many wives worse than chaff,&lt;br&gt;
Better left than taken,&lt;br&gt;
And there are many women like the bees,&lt;br&gt;
They will help their men to earn worldly wealth,&lt;br&gt;
Children without wisdom will do their whim,&lt;br&gt;
But if they think what their play is worth&lt;br&gt;
And take careful note of what father and mother did&lt;br&gt;
They would not go to the wood to collect their food&lt;br&gt;
But with a little labour they would earn their food and drink.}}

'''Jibu''' is a [[Jukunoid language]] spoken in the [[Taraba State]] of [[Nigeria]] by 30,000 people.

== Phonology ==
In Jibu, there are 18 consonant phonemes, 9 vowels (which are represented just using three letters), and three tones (rising, mid-level, and falling). In Jibu, nasalization, labialization, and palatalization are considered to be part of the syllable, and are written along with it after the vowel. [[Nasalization]] is represented with ''n'', except when it is at the end of a syllable it becomes doubled (/kʲã/ becomes ''kyann''). [[Labialization]] is represented with ''w'', and [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]] with ''y'' respectively.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jibu Narrative Discourse Structure|last=Bradley|first=Virginia|publisher=SIL|year=1971|isbn=|location=|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vowels ===
In Jibu, there are 9 phonemically different [[Vowel|vowels]], which are represented by three different symbols. A tenth sound resembling /u/ (as in ''y&lt;u&gt;ou&lt;/u&gt;''), is only used in loanwords from other languages, such as the neighboring [[Hausa language|Hausa]], and is represented by ''u''.

=== Consonants ===
Jibu has 18 different [[consonant]] phonemes. Some different phonemes are represented by the same symbol, such as /ʃ/ and /s/ being both represented as ''s'' in their older modified [[Americanist phonetic notation|Americanist Phonetic Notation]] [[Orthography|orthographic]] forms. If all of the consonant phonemes are represented using their older [[Americanist phonetic notation|Americanist Phonetic Notation]] counterparts, there is no orthographic overlap. The sound /ɗ/, which is used in some [[Hausa language|Hausa]] loanwords, is commonly represented using ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'d''.

=== Tones ===
Jibu has three tones (four if the base tone is included). These tones are high (´), lowered-mid (') and low (`). The base tone is not written on words and in more recent publications, neither is the lowered-mid tone.

== Orthography ==
The system used today in Jibu includes some symbols for transcribing sounds in Hausa loanwords, the older system, which is a slightly modified version of Americanist Phonetic Notation, does not include a symbol for the transcription of ''h'', and includes the fact that multiple phonemes are [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcribed]] as a single symbol in multiple cases.

== Verbs ==
In Jibu, verbs are not conjugated, which is a common aspect among Junkanoid languages. Instead, the pronoun is placed before the verb, and all aspect markers are placed before the pronoun.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Intransitive: á (work! - ''á sar'')

Continuative action: ri (are working - ''ri sar'')

Completed action: hiŋ (did work - ''hiŋ sar'')

Completive action: rìg, rìghiŋ (work has been completed - ''rìg sar'')

== Pronouns ==
Jibu pronouns do not reflect gender, the word ''wá'' meaning he, she, or it, unlike English, does not have multiple forms based on gender.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Kadu''' or '''Kado''' is a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan language]] of the [[Sal languages|Sal branch]] spoken in [[Sagaing Region]], [[Myanmar]]. Dialects are Settaw, Mawkhwin, and Mawteik [extinct], with 30,000 speakers total.

==Names==
Alternate names for Kadu listed in ''Ethnologue'' are Gadu, Ka’do, Kadu-Ganaan, Kantu’, Kato, Kudo, Maw, Mawteik, Puteik, and Thet; the autonym is ''Asak''.

==Geographical distribution==
Statistics for Kadu-speaking villages are as follows (''[[Ethnologue]]'').
*over 30 villages speaking the Mawteik dialect (nearly extinct)
*over 30 villages speaking the Settaw dialect
*5 villages speaking the Mawkhwin dialect
*The speakers of the Kadu language live in [[Banmauk]], [[Indaw]], and [[Pinlebu]], which are three townships in Katha District, [[Sagaing Region]], Myanmar. Among these three, Banmauk has the largest Kadu population and Pinlebu has the smallest Kadu population.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tibeto-burman.net/files/Sangdong-2012-Grammar_of_Kadu.pdf|title=A grammar of the Kadu (Asak) language|last=Sangdong|first=David|date=2012|website=|publisher=|access-date=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is low mutual intelligibility among the Kadu dialects.

== History ==
The Kadu were the dominant ethnic group in the [[Chindwin River]] valley at the beginning of the early 2nd millennium A.D. until the [[Chin people]] and subsequently the [[Shan people]] migrated into the Chindwin Valley (Matisoff 2013:13).&lt;ref name="Matisoff2013"&gt;Matisoff, James A. 2013.

''Linguistics of the Tibeto-Burman Area'' 36(2). 1–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===
Kadu vowels consist of eight monophthongs and a diphthong /ai/.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huziwara|first=Keisuke|date=2013|title=カドゥー語音韻論|url=http://ci.nii.ac.jp/els/110009592446.pdf?id=ART0010049043&amp;type=pdf&amp;lang=en&amp;host=cinii&amp;order_no=&amp;ppv_type=0&amp;lang_sw=&amp;no=1455307449&amp;cp=|journal=東南アジア研究|doi=|pmid=|access-date=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Syllabic structure ===
C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;: optional, this can be only /p, t, m, n, ʔ, ŋ/.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Grammar ==
Kadu is an SOV language.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Nouns ===
Abstract nouns such as freedom, love, experience, and anger  are not attested in the Kadu noun class. They are usually expressed by verbs or adjectival verbs.

The language has two categories of nouns:

1, So called "simple nouns" are treated as monomorphemic by the native speakers.

2, Nouns known as "complex nouns" are polymorphemic, and most of the complex nouns come from the process of compounding.

=== Verbs ===
Adjectives that expresses dimensions and qualities such as "tong" (=big) and "lom" (=warm) function as verbs, and are categorized as verbs.

The verbs are structurally categorized as:

1, Simple verbs, which are treated as monomorphemic words by the native speakers.

and

2, Polymorphemic complex verbs.

Kadu verbs may be reduplicated using the same morpheme or may take attendant words to express the repeated or frequent actions.

V-V constructions function as resultative, directional, evaluative, explanatory, or manner.

=== Adverbs ===
The adverbs are also "simple" or "complex" like nouns and verbs.

One thing to point up is that the complex adverbs are derived from verbs or nominals by the processes of reduplication or semi-reduplication.

=== Numerals ===
Most of the native numerals in Kadu are lost.

Numerals are always attached to classifiers, although classifiers do not occur with multiples of ten.

As for ordinal numbers, Burmese ordinal numbers are used because the original ordinal numbers are already lost.

=== Pronouns ===

|/nga/
|/maleq/
|-
|2nd person
|/nang/
|/haning/
|-
|3rd person
|/hing/
|/antak/, /matak/
|}

=== Quantifiers ===
Quantifiers follow the head noun they quantify.

=== Particles ===
There are nominal relational markers, verbal particles, clausal particles, utterance final particles, and speaker attitude particles.

=== Interrogatives ===

==== Yes/no interrogatives ====
Yes/no questions are formed by simply adding either of the two interrogative particles "la" and "ka" at the end of the phrase.

==== Alternative questions ====
Yes/no questions can also be expressed by an alternative interrogative expression like "is it A or not A", which can be found in [[Mandarin Chinese]] as well.

==== Tag questions ====
Interrogative sentences can be made by adding "chi" (=true) at the end of sentences, like "right?" in [[English language]].

==== Wh- questions ====
Wh- questions are formed by attaching the Wh-word forming morphemes, "ma" or "ha", to specific nomials or nominal postpositions.

Wh- question words also may function as indefinite pronouns such as "whatever", "anyone" and so on.

=== Negation ===
Verbs can be negated by negative proclitics, "a-" and "in-".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{Culture of Serbia}}

[[Serbia]] has only one nationwide official language, which is [[Serbian language|Serbian]]. Other languages spoken in Serbia include [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Pannonian Rusyn language|Rusyn]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] (all of which are official regional languages in the [[Vojvodina]] province), [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Romani language|Romani]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Vlach language in Serbia|Vlach]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]], [[Bunjevac language|Bunjevac]], etc.

==Serbian language==
{{Main article|Serbian language}}

Serbian language predominates in most of [[Serbia]]. [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Bunjevac language]], which are, according to census, spoken in some parts of Serbia are [[Serbo-Croatian|virtually identical]] with Serbian, while speakers of [[Bulgarian language]] from southern Serbia speak in the [[Torlakian dialect]], which is considered as one of the dialects of the Serbian language by Serbian linguists.

Serbian language spoken in Serbia has several dialects: [[Šumadija-Vojvodina dialect|Šumadija-Vojvodina]], [[Smederevo-Vršac dialect|Smederevo-Vršac]], [[Kosovo-Resava dialect|Kosovo-Resava]], [[Prizren-South Morava dialect|Prizren South Morava]], [[Svrljig-Zaplanje dialect|Svrljig-Zaplanje]], [[Timok-Lužnica dialect|Timok-Lužnica]] (Torlakian), [[Eastern Herzegovinian dialect|Eastern Herzegovina]], and [[Zeta-South Sandžak dialect|Zeta-South Sandžak]]. [[Šumadija-Vojvodina dialect|Šumadija-Vojvodina]] and [[Eastern Herzegovinian dialect|Eastern Herzegovina]] dialects are basys for modern standard Serbian.

Throughout part of southern Serbia, a dialect by the name of [[Torlak dialect|Torlakian]] is spoken. Although it has no standard form and continues to be spoken without any form of official status, Torlakian may be seen by some as constituting a separate language. It forms a part of the South Slavic dialect continuum, and is transitional between the eastern south Slavic languages (mainly Bulgarian and Macedonian) and the western south Slavic languages (of which Serbian is a part).

==Minority languages==

Besides [[Serbian language|Serbian]], which is the official language in the whole country, there are five minority languages in the official use by the provincial administration in Vojvodina: [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Pannonian Rusyn language|Rusyn]], and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. Serbian is a main language used by provincial administration and by all city and municipal administrations in Vojvodina. The other five languages are used by provincial administration and by selected city or municipal administrations. In practice, Serbian is a ''lingua franca'' of the region and number of declared native speakers of Serbian in the province exceeds the number of declared ethnic [[Serbs]]. Among other languages, Hungarian and Slovak are dominant in several municipalities, while other languages are dominant only in several villages.

In total there are 15 minority languages spoken in [[Serbia]].&lt;ref name="Latest Council of Europe report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npld.eu/news/latest-news/60/latest-council-of-europe-report-on-regional-or-minority-languages-in-serbia-published-/|title=Latest Council of Europe report on regional or minority Languages in Serbia published|publisher=[[The Network to Promote Linguistic Diversity]]| format=|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those languages are [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Bunjevac language|Bunjevac]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[German language|German]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Romani language|Romani]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Pannonian Rusyn language|Pannonian Rusyn]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and [[Vlach language|Vlach]].&lt;ref name="Latest Council of Europe report" /&gt; The [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] was signed by [[Serbia and Montenegro]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="Council of Europe report PDF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/education/minlang/Report/EvaluationReports/SerbiaECRML2_en.pdf|title=EUROPEAN CHARTER FOR REGIONAL OR MINORITY LANGUAGES-APPLICATION OF THE CHARTER IN SERBIA, 2nd monitoring cycle|publisher=[[Council of Europe]]| format=|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Republic of Serbia as the successor of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro continue its legal obligations toward charter and it entered into force in 2006.&lt;ref name="Council of Europe report PDF" /&gt; In municipalities where certain minority constitute more than 15% of total population introduction of a minority language in official use is compulsory.&lt;ref name="Council of Europe report PDF" /&gt; Additionally, In province of [[Vojvodina]], minority language and script which is not in official use on the entire territory of the municipality shall be introduced into official use in a settlements of that municipality if the percentage of given minority reaches 25% in that settlement.&lt;ref name="Council of Europe report PDF" /&gt;

The '''lexical definition''' of a term, also known as the [[dictionary]] definition, is the [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]] of the term in common usage. As its other name implies, this is the sort of [[definition]] one is likely to find in the dictionary. A lexical definition is usually the type expected from a request for definition, and it is generally expected that such a definition will be stated as simply as possible in order to convey information to the widest audience. 

Note that a lexical definition is ''descriptive'', reporting actual usage within speakers of a [[language]], and changes with changing usage of the term, rather than ''prescriptive'', which would be to stick with a version regarded as "correct", regardless of drift in accepted meaning. They tend to be inclusive, attempting to capture everything the term is used to refer to, and as such are often too vague for many purposes. 

When the breadth or vagueness of a lexical definition is unacceptable, a [[precising definition]] or a [[stipulative definition]] is often used. 

Words can be classified as lexical or nonlexical. Lexical words are those that have independent meaning (such as a [[Noun|Noun (N)]], [[Verb|verb (V)]], [[Adjective|adjective (A)]], [[adverb|adverb (Adv)]], or [[preposition|preposition (P)]].

The definition which reports the meaning of a word or a phrase as it is actually used by people is called a lexical definition. Meanings of words given in a dictionary are lexical definitions. As a word may have more than one meaning, it may also have more than one lexical definition.

Lexical definitions are either true or false. If the definition is the same as the actual use of the word then it is true, otherwise it is false.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="928">The '''Malagasy Sign Language''' is a [[sign language]] used for communication among hearing impaired people in [[Madagascar]]. An estimated 110,000 to 170,000  people (or 1% of the population of Madagascar) are capable of using it. It also shows similarities with the [[Norwegian Sign Language]]. Seven deaf schools in Madagascar are being sponsored by Evangelical Lutherans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ethnologue.com/language/mzc/20 Ethnologue]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mobility kill''' (or '''M-kill''') in [[armoured warfare]] is a weapon or vehicle that is immobilized, or the act of immobilizing such a target. This is often caused by the vehicle triggering an [[anti-tank mine]] by driving over it, though it may also result from being hit by an [[rocket propelled grenade]] or [[anti-tank missile]].

[[Tank]]s and other [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s can be immobilized by damage to their engines, tracks, or running gear. Because of the mobile nature of modern warfare, such a vehicle is often effectively useless on the battlefield, though it may later be salvaged for spares, or repaired and brought back into action. In rare cases, tanks that have suffered mobility kills have continued to engage enemy targets with their main gun, even though they are immobile. However, in an active battlefield situation any armoured fighting vehicles which have suffered mobility kills are stationary targets for ground-attack planes armed with ordnance such as rockets or [[cluster bomb]]s. Alternatively they may be subject to artillery bombardment. In any case, enemy ground troops may attack stranded vehicles with additional [[ATGM]]s or [[rocket propelled grenade|RPG]]s.

It is claimed that the [[Wehrmacht]] lost more [[Panther tank]]s as mobility kills than as catastrophic kills in [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Panther vs T-34: Ukraine 1943 (Duel) by Robert Forczyk{{page needed|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''n''-gram}}
{{More footnotes|date=February 2011}}

In the fields of [[computational linguistics]] and [[probability]], an '''''n''-gram''' is a contiguous sequence of ''n'' items from a given [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] of text or speech. The items can be [[phoneme]]s, [[syllable]]s, [[letter (alphabet)|letters]], [[word]]s or [[base pairs]] according to the application.  The ''n''-grams typically are collected from a [[text corpus|text]] or [[speech corpus]]. When the items are words, {{mvar|n}}-grams may also be called ''shingles''{{clarify|date=December 2017}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Broder |first1=Andrei Z. |first2=Steven C. |last2=Glassman |first3=Mark S. |last3=Manasse |first4=Geoffrey |last4=Zweig |title=Syntactic clustering of the web |journal=Computer Networks and ISDN Systems |volume=29 |issue=8 |year=1997 |pages=1157–1166 |doi=10.1016/s0169-7552(97)00031-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using [[Latin numerical prefixes]], an ''n''-gram of size 1 is referred to as a "unigram"; size 2 is a "[[bigram]]" (or, less commonly, a "digram"); size 3 is a "[[trigram]]". [[Cardinal number (linguistics)|English cardinal numbers]] are sometimes used, e.g., "four-gram", "five-gram", and so on.    In computational biology, a [[polymer]] or [[oligomer]] of a known size is called a [[k-mer|''k''-mer]] instead of an ''n''-gram, with specific names using [[Greek numerical prefixes]] such as "monomer", "dimer", "trimer", "tetramer", "pentamer", etc., or English cardinal numbers, "one-mer", "two-mer", "three-mer", etc.

== Applications ==
An '''''n''-gram model''' is a type of probabilistic [[language model]] for predicting the next item in such a sequence in the form of a (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)–order [[Markov chain|Markov model]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.coursera.org/learn/natural-language-processing/lecture/UnEHs/07-01-noisy-channel-model-8-33&lt;/ref&gt; ''n''-gram models are now widely used in [[probability]], [[communication theory]], [[computational linguistics]] (for instance, statistical [[natural language processing]]), [[computational biology]] (for instance, biological [[sequence analysis]]), and [[data compression]]. Two benefits of ''n''-gram models (and algorithms that use them) are simplicity and scalability – with larger ''n'', a model can store more context with a well-understood [[space–time tradeoff]], enabling small experiments to scale up efficiently.

== ''n''-gram models ==
An '''''n''-gram model''' models sequences, notably natural languages, using the statistical properties of ''n''-grams.

This idea can be traced to an experiment by [[Claude Shannon]]'s work in [[information theory]].  Shannon posed the question: given a sequence of letters (for example, the sequence "for ex"), what is the [[likelihood]] of the next letter?  From training data, one can derive a [[probability distribution]] for the next letter given a history of size &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;:  ''a'' = 0.4, ''b'' = 0.00001, ''c'' = 0, ....; where the probabilities of all possible "next-letters" sum to 1.0.

More concisely, an ''n''-gram model predicts &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; based on &lt;math&gt;x_{i-(n-1)}, \dots, x_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt;. In probability terms, this is &lt;math&gt;P(x_i \mid x_{i-(n-1)}, \dots, x_{i-1})&lt;/math&gt;. When used for [[language model]]ing, independence assumptions are made so that each word depends only on the last ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 words.  This [[Markov model]] is used as an approximation of the true underlying language.  This assumption is important because it massively simplifies the problem of estimating the language model from data.  In addition, because of the open nature of language, it is common to group words unknown to the language model together.

Note that in a simple ''n''-gram language model, the probability of a word, conditioned on some number of previous words (one word in a bigram model, two words in a trigram model, etc.) can be described as following a [[categorical distribution]] (often imprecisely called a "[[multinomial distribution]]").

In practice, the probability distributions are smoothed by assigning non-zero probabilities to unseen words or ''n''-grams; see [[N-gram#Smoothing techniques|smoothing techniques]].

== Applications and considerations ==
''n''-gram models are widely used in statistical [[natural language processing]].  In [[speech recognition]], [[phonemes]] and sequences of phonemes are modeled using a ''n''-gram distribution.  For parsing, words are modeled such that each ''n''-gram is composed of ''n'' words.  For [[language identification]], sequences of [[Character (symbol)|characters]]/[[grapheme]]s (''e.g.'', [[Letter (alphabet)|letters of the alphabet]]) are modeled for different languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|author=Ted Dunning
|year=1994
|title=Statistical Identification of Language

|publisher= New Mexico State University
}} Technical Report MCCS 94–273&lt;/ref&gt;  For sequences of characters, the 3-grams (sometimes referred to as "trigrams") that can be generated from "good morning" are "goo", "ood", "od ", "d m", " mo", "mor" and so forth, counting the space character as a gram (sometimes the beginning and end of a text are modeled explicitly, adding "__g", "_go", "ng_", and "g__").  For sequences of words,  the trigrams (shingles) that can be generated from "the dog smelled like a skunk" are "# the dog", "the dog smelled", "dog smelled like", "smelled like a", "like a skunk" and "a skunk #".

Practitioners {{who|date=June 2014}} more interested in multiple word terms might preprocess strings to remove spaces. {{who|date=June 2014}} Many simply collapse [[Whitespace character|whitespace]] to a single space while preserving paragraph marks, because the whitespace is frequently either an element of writing style or introduces layout or presentation not required by the prediction and deduction methodology. Punctuation is also commonly reduced or removed by preprocessing and is frequently used to trigger functionality.

''n''-grams can also be used for sequences of words or almost any type of data. For example, they have been used for extracting features for clustering large sets of satellite earth images and for determining what part of the Earth a particular image came from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Soffer | first1 = A | year = 1997 | title = Image categorization using texture features | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on | volume = 1 | issue = 233| page = 237 | doi = 10.1109/ICDAR.1997.619847 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They have also been very successful as the first pass in genetic sequence search and in the identification of the species from which short sequences of DNA originated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tomović | first1 = Andrija | last2 = Janičić | first2 = Predrag | last3 = Kešelj'' | first3 = Vlado | year = 2006 | title = ''n''-Gram-based classification and unsupervised hierarchical clustering of genome sequences | url = | journal = Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine | volume = 81 | issue = 2| pages = 137–153 | doi = 10.1016/j.cmpb.2005.11.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''n''-gram models are often criticized because they lack any explicit representation of long range dependency. This is because the only explicit dependency range is (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1) tokens for an ''n''-gram model, and since natural languages incorporate many cases of unbounded dependencies (such as [[wh-movement]]), this means that an ''n''-gram model cannot in principle distinguish unbounded dependencies from noise (since long range correlations drop exponentially with distance for any Markov model). For this reason, ''n''-gram models have not made much impact on linguistic theory, where part of the explicit goal is to model such dependencies.

Another criticism that has been made is that Markov models of language, including ''n''-gram models, do not explicitly capture the performance/competence distinction.  This is because ''n''-gram models are not designed to model linguistic knowledge as such, and make no claims to being (even potentially) complete models of linguistic knowledge; instead, they are used in practical applications.

In practice, ''n''-gram models have been shown  to be extremely effective in modeling language data, which is a core component in modern statistical [[natural language processing|language]] applications.

Most modern applications that rely on ''n''-gram based models, such as [[machine translation]] applications, do not rely exclusively on such models; instead, they typically also incorporate [[Bayesian inference]]. Modern statistical models are typically made up of two parts, a [[prior distribution]] describing the inherent likelihood of a possible result and a [[likelihood function]] used to assess the compatibility of a possible result with observed data. When a language model is used, it is used as part of the prior distribution (e.g. to gauge the inherent "goodness" of a possible translation), and even then it is often not the only component in this distribution.

[[Feature engineering|Handcrafted features]] of various sorts are also used, for example variables that represent the position of a word in a sentence or the general topic of discourse. In addition, features based on the structure of the potential result, such as syntactic considerations, are often used. Such features are also used as part of the likelihood function, which makes use of the observed data. Conventional linguistic theory can be incorporated in these features (although in practice, it is rare that features specific to generative or other particular theories of grammar are incorporated, as [[computational linguistics|computational linguists]] tend to be "agnostic" towards individual theories of grammar{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}).

=== Out-of-vocabulary words ===
{{Main|Statistical machine translation}}

An issue when using n-gram language models are out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. They are encountered in [[computational linguistics]] and [[natural language processing]] when the input includes words which were not present in a system's dictionary or database during its preparation. By default, when a language model is estimated, the entire observed vocabulary is used. In some cases, it may be necessary to estimate the language model with a specific fixed vocabulary. In such a scenario, the n-grams in the [[text corpus|corpus]] that contain an out-of-vocabulary word are ignored. The n-gram probabilities are smoothed over all the words in the vocabulary even if they were not observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wołk | first1 = K. | last2 = Marasek | first2 = K. | last3 = Glinkowski | first3 = W. | year = 2015 | title = Telemedicine as a special case of Machine Translation | url = | journal = Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, it is essential in some cases to explicitly model the probability of out-of-vocabulary words by introducing a special token (e.g. ''&lt;unk&gt;'') into the vocabulary. Out-of-vocabulary words in the corpus are effectively replaced with this special &lt;unk&gt; token before n-grams counts are cumulated. With this option, it is possible to estimate the transition probabilities of n-grams involving out-of-vocabulary words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference | author = Wołk K., Marasek K. | year = 2014 | title = Polish-English Speech Statistical Machine Translation Systems for the IWSLT 2014 | conference = Proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation. Tahoe Lake, USA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''n''-grams for approximate matching ==
{{Main|Approximate string matching}}
''n''-grams can also be used for efficient approximate matching.  By converting a sequence of items to a set of ''n''-grams, it can be embedded in a [[vector space]], thus allowing the sequence to be compared to other sequences in an efficient manner. For example, if we convert strings with only letters in the English alphabet into single character 3-grams, we get a &lt;math&gt;26^3&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional space (the first dimension measures the number of occurrences of "aaa", the second "aab", and so forth for all possible combinations of three letters). Using this representation, we lose information about the string. For example, both the strings "abc" and "bca" give rise to exactly the same 2-gram "bc" (although {"ab", "bc"} is clearly not the same as {"bc", "ca"}). However, we know empirically that if two strings of real text have a similar vector representation (as measured by [[cosine similarity|cosine distance]]) then they are likely to be similar. Other metrics have also been applied to vectors of ''n''-grams with varying, sometimes better, results. For example, [[z-score]]s have been used to compare documents by examining how many standard deviations each ''n''-gram differs from its mean occurrence in a large collection, or [[text corpus]], of documents (which form the "background" vector).  In the event of small counts, the [[g-score]] (also known as [[g-test]]) may give better results for comparing alternative models.

It is also possible to take a more principled approach to the statistics of ''n''-grams, modeling similarity as the likelihood that two strings came from the same source directly in terms of a problem in [[Bayesian inference]].

''n''-gram-based searching can also be used for [[plagiarism detection]].

== Other applications ==
''n''-grams find use in several areas of computer science, [[computational linguistics]], and applied mathematics.

They have been used to:
* design [[kernel trick|kernels]] that allow [[machine learning]] algorithms such as [[support vector machine]]s to learn from string data
* find likely candidates for the correct spelling of a misspelled word
* improve compression in [[data compression|compression algorithms]] where a small area of data requires ''n''-grams of greater length
* assess the probability of a given word sequence appearing in text of a language of interest in pattern recognition systems, [[speech recognition]], OCR ([[optical character recognition]]), [[Intelligent Character Recognition]] ([[Intelligent character recognition|ICR]]), [[machine translation]] and similar applications
* improve retrieval in [[information retrieval]] systems when it is hoped to find similar "documents" (a term for which the conventional meaning is sometimes stretched, depending on the data set) given a single query document and a database of reference documents
* improve retrieval performance in genetic sequence analysis as in the [[BLAST]] family of programs
* identify the language a text is in or the species a small sequence of DNA was taken from
* predict letters or words at random in order to create text, as in the [[dissociated press]] algorithm.
* [[cryptanalysis]]

== Bias-versus-variance trade-off ==
To choose a value for ''n'' in an ''n''-gram model, it is necessary to find the right trade off between the stability of the estimate against its appropriateness. This means that trigram (i.e. triplets of words) is a common choice with large training corpora (millions of words), whereas a bigram is often used with smaller ones.

=== Smoothing techniques ===
There are problems of balance weight between ''infrequent grams'' (for example, if a proper name appeared in the training data) and ''frequent grams''.   Also, items not seen in the training data will be given a [[probability]] of 0.0 without [[smoothing]]. For unseen but plausible data from a sample, one can introduce [[pseudocount]]s.  Pseudocounts are generally motivated on Bayesian grounds.

In practice it is necessary to ''smooth'' the probability distributions by also assigning non-zero probabilities to unseen words or ''n''-grams.  The reason is that models derived directly from the ''n''-gram frequency counts have severe problems when confronted with any ''n''-grams that have not explicitly been seen before – [[PPM compression algorithm|the zero-frequency problem]].  Various smoothing methods are used, from simple "add-one" (Laplace) smoothing (assign a count of 1 to unseen ''n''-grams; see [[Rule of succession]]) to more sophisticated models, such as [[Good–Turing discounting]] or [[Katz's back-off model|back-off models]].  Some of these methods are equivalent to assigning a [[prior distribution]] to the probabilities of the ''n''-grams and using [[Bayesian inference]] to compute the resulting [[posterior distribution|posterior]] ''n''-gram probabilities.  However, the more sophisticated smoothing models were typically not derived in this fashion, but instead through independent considerations.
* [[Linear interpolation]] (e.g., taking the [[weighted mean]] of the unigram, bigram, and trigram)
* [[Good–Turing frequency estimation|Good–Turing]] discounting
* [[Witten–Bell discounting]]
* [[Additive smoothing|Lidstone's smoothing]]
* [[Katz's back-off model]] (trigram)
* [[Kneser–Ney smoothing]]

=== Skip-gram ===
In the field of [[computational linguistics]], in particular [[language model]]ing, '''skip-grams'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.45.1629|title=The SPHINX-II Speech Recognition System: An Overview|first1=Xuedong|last1=Huang|first2=Fileno|last2=Alleva|first3=Hsiao-wuen|last3=Hon|first4=Mei-yuh|last4=Hwang|first5=Ronald|last5=Rosenfeld|date=1 January 1992|publisher=|volume=7|pages=137–148|via=CiteSeer}}&lt;/ref&gt; are a generalization of ''n''-grams in which the components (typically words) need not be consecutive in the text under consideration, but may leave gaps that are ''skipped'' over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ballison/pdf/lrec_skipgrams.pdf|title=A Closer Look at Skip-gram Modelling|author=David Guthrie|date=2006|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; They provide one way of overcoming the [[data sparsity problem]] found with conventional ''n''-gram analysis.

Formally, an {{mvar|n}}-gram is a consecutive subsequence of length {{mvar|n}} of some sequence of tokens {{math|''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; … ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. A {{mvar|k}}-skip-{{mvar|n}}-gram is a length-{{mvar|n}} subsequence where the components occur at distance at most {{mvar|k}} from each other.

For example, in the input text:

:''the rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain''

the set of 1-skip-2-grams includes all the bigrams (2-grams), and in addition the subsequences

:''the in'', ''rain Spain'', ''in falls'', ''Spain mainly'', ''falls on'', ''mainly the'', and ''on plain''.
&lt;!--Merged from skip gram--&gt;

== Syntactic ''n''-grams ==
Syntactic ''n''-grams are ''n''-grams defined by paths in syntactic dependency or constituent trees rather than the linear structure of the text.&lt;ref name="sng"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sidorov|first1=Grigori|last2=Velazquez|first2=Francisco|last3=Stamatatos|first3=Efstathios|last4=Gelbukh|first4=Alexander|last5=Chanona-Hernández|first5=Liliana|title=Syntactic Dependency-based ''n''-grams as Classification Features|journal=LNAI 7630|date=2012|pages=1–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sidorov|first1=Grigori|title=Syntactic Dependency-Based ''n''-grams in Rule Based Automatic English as Second Language Grammar Correction|journal=International Journal of Computational Linguistics and Applications|date=2013|volume=4|issue=2|pages=169–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Figueroa | first1 = Alejandro | last2 = Atkinson | first2 = John | year = 2012 | title = Contextual Language Models For Ranking Answers To Natural Language Definition Questions | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262176888_Contextual_Language_Models_For_Ranking_Answers_To_Natural_Language_Definition_Questions | journal = Computational Intelligence | volume = 28 | issue = 4| pages = 528–548 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8640.2012.00426.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the sentence "economic news has little effect on financial markets" can be transformed to syntactic ''n''-grams following the tree structure of its [[Dependency grammar|dependency relations]]: news-economic, effect-little, effect-on-markets-financial.&lt;ref name="sng" /&gt;

Syntactic ''n''-grams are intended to reflect syntactic structure more faithfully than linear ''n''-grams, and have many of the same applications, especially as features in a Vector Space Model. Syntactic ''n''-grams for certain tasks gives better results than the use of standard ''n''-grams, for example, for authorship attribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sidorov|first1=Grigori|last2=Velasquez|first2=Francisco|last3=Stamatatos|first3=Efstathios|last4=Gelbukh|first4=Alexander|last5=Chanona-Hernández|first5=Liliana|title=Syntactic ''n''-Grams as Machine Learning Features for Natural Language Processing|journal=Expert Systems with Applications|volume=41|issue=3|pages=853–860|doi=10.1016/j.eswa.2013.08.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of syntactic ''n''-grams are part-of-speech ''n''-grams, defined as fixed-length contiguous overlapping subsequences that are extracted from part-of-speech sequences of text. Part-of-speech ''n''-grams have several applications, most commonly in information retrieval&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lioma | first1 = C. | last2 = van Rijsbergen | first2 = C. J.

'''Philippine Spanish''' ({{lang-es|español filipino, castellano filipino}}) is a variant of standard [[Spanish language|Spanish]] spoken in the [[Philippines]] mostly by [[Spanish Filipino]]s. Since the [[United States Military Government of the Philippine Islands|capture and occupation]] of the Philippines by the United States following the [[Spanish-American War]], the dialect has lost most of its speakers and it might be now close to disappearing.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==History==
{{see also|Spanish East Indies|Captaincy General of the Philippines}}
[[File:Variedades principales del español.png|thumb|right|300px|Primary dialects of Spanish]]

Philippine Spanish  is a [[Spanish dialects and varieties|dialect]] of the [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish language]] in the [[Philippines]]. The variant is very similar to [[Mexican Spanish]], because of Mexican and Latin American emigration to the [[Spanish East Indies]] over the years.

From 1565 to 1821, the Philippines which were a part of the [[Spanish East Indies]], were governed by the [[Captaincy General of the Philippines]] as a territory of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] centered in [[Mexico]]. It was only administered directly from Spain in 1821 after Mexico gained its independence that same year. Since the Philippines was a former territory of the Viceroyalty of New Spain for most of the Spanish colonial period, Spanish as was spoken in the Philippines had a greater affinity to [[Spanish language in the Americas|American Spanish]] rather than to [[Peninsular Spanish]].

===Chavacano===
{{see also|Spanish Filipino|Chavacano}}
{{Spanish language}}

An estimated 689,000 people speak [[Chavacano]], a [[Spanish-based creole languages|Spanish-based creole]].&lt;ref&gt;Spanish creole: {{Citation | first = Antonio | last = Quilis | title = La lengua española en Filipinas | year = 1996 | page = 54 and 55 | url = http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/01350553135573500088680/209438_0013.pdf | publisher = Cervantes virtual | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cervantes"&gt;[http://cvc.cervantes.es/lengua/anuario/anuario_98/moreno/cuadro03.htm Número de hispanohablantes en países y territorios donde el español no es lengua oficial] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429103156/http://cvc.cervantes.es/lengua/anuario/anuario_98/moreno/cuadro03.htm |date=29 April 2012 }}, [[Instituto Cervantes]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the [[Instituto Cervantes]] de Manila put the number of Spanish speakers in the Philippines in the area of three million, which included the native and the non-native Chavacano and Spanish speakers as well since there are some Filipinos who can speak Spanish and Chavacano as a second, third, or fourth language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =El retorno triunfal del español a las Filipinas | url=http://www.elcastellano.org/noticia.php?id=505 | accessdate = 2010-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
{{See also|Spanish phonology}}

Philippine Spanish has the following characteristics. Some of these have been passed on the manner of everyday speech of Filipinos; such as {{IPA|/x/}} being {{IPA|[h]}} and seseo.

=== y/ll distinction ===
As in some dialects in northern Spain and in some bilingual zones (Bolivia, Paraguay, and Peru) in Latin America, there is a phonological distinction between the sounds represented by 'll' {{IPA|/ʎ/}} and 'y' {{IPA|/ʝ/}}. For example, "{{wiktspa|silla}}" {{IPA|/ˈsiʎa/}} is not pronounced {{IPA|/ˈsiʝa/}} (Tagalog "{{wiktgl|silya}}"). However, [[yeísmo]], which merged the two, occurs in some words like "{{wiktspa|cebollas}}" {{IPA|/seˈboʝas/}} (Tagalog "{{wikttgl|sibuyas}}") and "{{wiktspa|caballo}}" {{IPA|/kaˈbaʝo/}} (Tagalog "{{wikttgl|kabayo}}").

===Seseo===
As in Latin American Spanish, {{IPA|/θ/}} is not distinguished from {{IPA|/s/}}. For example, cerveza {{IPA|/seɾˈbesa/}} (Tagalog "serbesa").

===Retraction of {{IPA|/x/}} to {{IPA|[h]}}===
The velar jota sound {{IPA|/x/}} is retracted to glottal {{IPAblink|h}}, which also occurs in Andalusian, Caribbean, Canarian, and Colombian Spanish: "Jorge" {{IPA|[ˈhoɾhe ~ ˈholhe]}}.

===Merger of {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/ɾ/}}, {{IPA|/p/}}, and {{IPA|/f/}} and non-open vowels===
Malayo-Polynesian countries often interchange {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/ɾ/}}, {{IPA|/p/}} and {{IPA|/f/}}, {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} as well as {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}), which also occurs in Philippine Spanish. For example, "pared" {{IPA|[paˈdeɾ]}} (Tagalog "pader"), Filipinas {{IPA|[piliˈpinas]}} (Tagalog "Pilipinas"), entender {{IPA|[intinˈdiɾ]}} (Tagalog "intindi") and ojal {{IPA|[uˈhal]}} (Tagalog "uhal").

===No aspiration of {{IPA|/s/}}===
Unlike many Spanish and Latin American dialects, syllable-final "s" is always pronounced as an alveolar sibilant {{IPAblink|s}}, rather than a glottal fricative {{IPAblink|h}}. For example, "amores secos" {{IPA|[aˈmoɾes ˈsekos]}}.

===Retention of [h] of words originating from Latin ''f''===
Words like "hacer" {{IPA|[aˈseɾ]}}, "hablar" {{IPA|[aˈblaɾ]}} come from the Latin words "facere" and "fabulare," respectively. However, in Philippine Spanish, the initial letter is pronounced as {{IPAblink|h}}; in other dialects, it is either silent or {{IPAblink|x}}: {{IPA|[haˈseɾ]}} and {{IPA|[haˈblaɾ]}} (Tagalog "habla"). Because {{IPA|/x/}} in Philippine Spanish is glottal {{IPAblink|h}}, it is best to consider such words to be phonemically {{IPA|/xaˈseɾ/}} and {{IPA|/xaˈblaɾ/}}, rather than to postulate a marginal phoneme {{IPA|/h/}}. The same can occur in Andalusian and Caribbean Spanish.

==={{IPA|[ɾ–l]}} shift at the end of syllables===
At the end of a syllable of a word or a word itself, if the syllable/word ends with an l or r, {{IPA|/l/}} becomes {{IPA|[ɾ]}} and {{IPA|/ɾ/}} becomes {{IPA|[l]}} often. For instance, almíbar {{IPA|[aɾˈnibal]}} (Tagalog "arnibal), rezar {{IPA|[daˈsal]}} (Tagalog "dasal"). This also occurs in Andalusian and Caribbean Spanish.

==Orthography==
{{See also|Spanish orthography}}

[[diacritic|Diacritic marks]] are almost always left out except for the tilde on the ''[[ñ]]'' because of the use of American machines and the in capability of using such marks by English-language media companies. Typewriters sometimes include the ''ñ'', but they do not include accented vowels. Computer keyboards have always used the US standard layout, which includes neither ''ñ'' nor combining diacritics. Spanish words, however, are vocally stressed the same way as by other Spanish-speakers.

A '''poster''' is any piece of printed paper designed to be attached to a wall or vertical surface.&lt;ref&gt;[Gosling, Peter. (1999). Scientist's Guide to Poster Presentations. New York: Kluwer. {{ISBN|978-0-306-46076-0}}.]&lt;/ref&gt; Typically posters include both [[typography|textual]] and [[graphic]] elements, although a poster may be either wholly graphical or wholly text. Posters are designed to be both eye-catching and informative. Posters may be used for many purposes.  They are a frequent tool of advertisers (particularly of events, musicians, and films), [[propaganda|propagandists]], [[protest]]ors, and other groups trying to communicate a message. Posters are also used for reproductions of artwork, particularly famous works, and are generally low-cost compared to the original artwork. The modern poster, as we know it, however, dates back to the 1840s and 1850s when the [[printing]] industry perfected colour [[lithography]] and made [[mass production]] possible.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Eskilson, Graphic Design: A New History, Yale University Press, 2012, pp. 43-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Introduction===
According to the French historian [[Max Gallo]], "for over two hundred years, posters have been displayed in public places all over the world. Visually striking, they have been designed to attract the attention of passers-by, making us aware of a political viewpoint, enticing us to attend specific events, or encouraging us to purchase a particular product or service."&lt;ref name=Gallo&gt;Gallo, Max, ''The Poster in History'', (2002) W.W. Norton&lt;/ref&gt; The modern poster, as we know it, however, dates back to the mid-nineteenth century,  when several separate but related changes took place. First, the [[printing]] industry perfected colour [[lithography]] and made [[mass production]] of large and inexpensive images possible. Second, government censorship of public spaces in countries like France was lifted. And finally, advertisers began to market mass-produced consumer goods to a growing populace in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Guffey, Posters: A Global History, Reaktion: 2015, pp. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

"In little more than a hundred years", writes poster expert John Barnicoat, "it has come to be recognized as a vital art form, attracting artists at every level, from painters like [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] and [[Mucha]] to theatrical and commercial designers."&lt;ref name=Barnicoat&gt;Barnicoat, John, ''Posters: A Concise History'', (1985) Thames and Hudson&lt;/ref&gt;  They have ranged in styles from [[Art Nouveau]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[Cubism]], and [[Art Deco]] to the more formal [[Bauhaus]] and the often incoherent [[hippie]] posters of the 1960s.

===Mass production===
Posters, in the form of placards and posted bills, have been used since earliest times, primarily for advertising and announcements. Purely textual posters have a long history: they advertised the plays of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and made citizens aware of government proclamations for centuries.  However, the great revolution in posters was the development of printing techniques that allowed for cheap mass production and printing, including notably the technique [[lithography]] which was invented in 1796 by the German [[Alois Senefelder]]. The invention of lithography was soon followed by [[chromolithography]], which allowed for mass editions of posters illustrated in vibrant colours to be printed.

===Developing art form===
By the 1890s, the technique had spread throughout Europe.  A number of noted French artists created poster art in this period, foremost amongst them [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Jules Chéret]], [[Eugène Grasset]], [[Adolphe Willette]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Louis Anguetin]], [[Alfred Choubrac]], [[Georges de Feure]] and [[Henri-Gabriel Ibels]].&lt;ref&gt;The modern poster by Arsène Alexandre&lt;/ref&gt; Chéret is considered to be the "father" of advertisement placards. He was a pencil artist and a scene decorator, who founded a small lithography office in Paris in 1866. He used striking characters, contrast and bright colours, and created over 1000 advertisements, primarily for exhibitions, theatres, and products. The industry soon attracted the service of many aspiring painters who needed a source of revenue to support themselves.

[[Chéret]] developed a new [[lithographic]] technique that suited better the needs of advertisers: he added a lot more colour which, in conjunction with innovative [[typography]], rendered the poster much more expressive. Not surprisingly, Chéret is said to have introduced sex in advertising or, at least, to have exploited the feminine image as an advertising ploy. In contrast with those previously painted by [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], Chéret's laughing and provocative feminine figures, often called "chérettes," meant a new conception of art as being of service to advertising.

Posters soon transformed the thoroughfares of Paris, making the streets into what one contemporary called "the poor man’s picture gallery."&lt;ref&gt;Roger Marx, Masters of the Poster, 1896–1900 (New York, 1977), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Their commercial success was such that some fine artists took up poster design in earnest.  Some of these artists were, like Alphonse Mucha, in great demand and theatre stars personally selected their own favorite artist to do the poster for an upcoming performance. The popularity of poster art was such that in 1884 a major exhibition was held in Paris.

===Golden age of the poster===

By the 1890s, poster art had widespread usage in other parts of Europe, advertising everything from bicycles to bullfights. By the end of the 19th century, during an era known as the [[Belle Époque]], the standing of the poster as a serious artform was raised even further. Between 1895 and 1900, Jules Chéret created the [[Maîtres de l'Affiche]] (Masters of the Poster) series that became not only a commercial success but is now seen as an important historical publication. [[Alphonse Mucha]] and [[Eugène Grasset]] were also influential poster designers of this generation, known for their [[Art Nouveau]] style and stylized figures, particularly of women. Advertisement posters became a special type of graphic art in the modern age. [[Poster artist]]s such as [[Théophile Steinlen]], [[Albert Guillaume]], [[Leonetto Cappiello]], [[Henri Thiriet]] and others became important figures of their day, their art form transferred to magazines for advertising as well as for social and political commentary.. Indeed, as design historian Elizabeth Guffey notes, “As large, colorful posters began to command the spaces of public streets, markets, and squares, the format itself took on a civic respectability never afforded to Victorian handbills.”&lt;ref&gt;Guffey, op cit, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], posters underwent a slightly different evolution.  By the 1850s,  the advent of the traveling circus brought colorful posters to tell citizens that a carnival was coming to town. While many of these posters were beautifully printed, the earliest were mass-produced woodcuts; that technique, as well as their subject matter, crowded style, and bright colors, was often derided by contemporary critics.   As chromo-lithography began to reshape European posters, American artists began to take the medium more seriously.  Indeed, with work of designers like [[Edward Penfield]], or [[Will Bradley]] gained an audience in Europe as well as America.

==Decline and resurgence==
Challenged by newer modes of advertising, the poster as a communicative form began to decline after the First World War.  Civic groups had long assailed the poster, arguing that the form made public spaces ugly.  But the real threat to posters came from newer forms of advertising.  Mass-market magazines, radio and later television, and bill-boards all cut into advertiser’s marketing budgets. While posters continued to be made and advertised products, they were no longer considered a primary form of advertising.  More and more, posters purpose shifted toward political and decorative uses.

Indeed, by the mid 1960s, posters were reborn as part of a broader counter-cultural shift. By 1968 the poster craze was described as "half way between a passing fashion and a form of mass hysteria." &lt;ref&gt;David Kunzle, Posters of Protest: The Posters of Political Satire in the U.S., 1966–1970 (New York, 1971), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Sometimes called a “second golden age” or "postermania"&lt;ref&gt;Hilton Kramer, ‘Postermania’, New York Times Magazine (11 February 1968).&lt;/ref&gt; however, this resurgence of popularity saw posters used as decoration and self-expression as much as public protest or advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Guffey, op cit, 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial uses==

By the 1890s, poster art had widespread usage in other parts of Europe, advertising everything from bicycles to bullfights. Many posters have had great [[artistic merit]].  These include the posters advertising consumer products and entertainment, but also events like the [[World's Fair]]s and [[Colonialism|Colonial]] [[Art exhibitions|Exhibitions]].

===Political uses===
[[File:In God We Trust AFA Poster in New Philadelphia High School.jpg|thumb|right|A framed poster displaying the national motto of the United States, "[[In God We Trust]]," in a [[New Philadelphia High School]] classroom.|200px]]
Other times of great turmoil also produced great posters. The first widespread use of illustrated posters for political ends occurred during the First World War.  War bond drives and recruitment posters soon replaced commercial advertisements. German graphic designers, who had pioneered the simple Sachplakat style in the years leading up to the war, applied their talents to the war effort. Artists working for the Allied cause also made over their art in wartime, as well.

The 1960s saw the rise of [[pop art]] and protest movements throughout the West; both made great use of posters and contributed to the poster's revitalization at this time.
Perhaps the most acclaimed posters were those produced by [[France|French]] students during the so-called "''événements''" of May 1968. During the [[May 1968 in France|1968 Paris student riots]] and for years to come, [[Jim Fitzpatrick (artist)|Jim Fitzpatrick's]] stylized poster of [[Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] (based on the photo ''[[Guerrillero Heroico]]''), also became a common youthful symbol of rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;''Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon'', by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 19&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[September 11 attacks]], in the United States, public schools across the country posted "[[In God We Trust]]" framed posters in their "libraries, cafeterias and classrooms." The [[American Family Association]] supplied several 11-by-14-inch posters to school systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2002/02/20/usat-posters.htm |title='In God We Trust' pressed for schools - USA Today |publisher=Usatoday30.usatoday.com |date=2002-02-19 |accessdate=2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poster printing==
Many [[printing]] techniques are used to produce posters. While most posters are mass-produced, posters may also be printed by hand or in limited editions. Most posters are printed on one side and left blank on the back, the better for affixing to a wall or other surface. Pin-up sized posters are usually printed on A3 Standard Silk paper in full colour. Upon purchase, most commercially available posters are often rolled up into a cylindrical tube to allow for damage-free transportation. Rolled-up posters can then be flattened under pressure for several hours to regain their original form.

It is possible to use [[Tiled printing|poster creation software]] to print large posters on standard home or office printers.

==Types of poster designs==
Many posters, particularly early posters, were used for advertising products. Posters continue to be used for this purpose, with posters advertising [[film]]s, [[music]] (both concerts and recorded albums), [[comic book]]s, and [[tourism|travel]] destinations being particularly notable examples.

===Propaganda and political posters===
[[File:German propaganda poster, Upper Silesia Plebiscite 1.jpg|thumb|[[German propaganda]] poster, 1921]]

During the [[World War I|First]] and [[Second World War]]s, recruiting posters became extremely common, and many of them have persisted in the national consciousness, such as the "[[Lord Kitchener Wants You]]" posters from the [[United Kingdom]], the "[[Uncle Sam]] wants you" posters from the United States, or the "[[Loose lips sink ships|Loose Lips Sink Ships]]" posters&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlcsmith.com/graphics/not_mine/tits.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022072541/http://www.mlcsmith.com/graphics/not_mine/tits.html |date=October 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that warned of foreign spies. Also in Canada, they were widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.mcgill.ca/warposters/english/introduction.htm |title='Canadian War Poster Collection' |publisher=Digital.library.mcgill.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Posters during wartime were also used for [[propaganda]] purposes, persuasion, and motivation, such as the famous [[Rosie the Riveter]] posters which exhorted women workers to work in factories during World War II. The [[Soviet Union]] also produced a plethora of [[World War II posters from Soviet Union|propaganda posters]],&lt;ref name="spam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://posters.nce.buttobi.net |title=Propaganda posters - Collection of 1400+ POSTERS from Russia, Czech republic, Poland and Cuba |publisher=Posters.nce.buttobi.net |date= |accessdate=2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of which became iconic representations of the [[Great Patriotic War]].
During the democratic [[revolutions of 1989]] in [[Central and Eastern Europe]] the poster was very important weapon in the hand of the opposition. Brave printed and hand-made political posters appeared on the [[Berlin Wall]], on the statue of St. Wenseslas in [[Prague]] and around the unmarked grave of [[Imre Nagy]] in [[Budapest]] and the role of them was indispensable for the democratic change. An example of an influential political poster is [[Shepard Fairey]]'s [[Barack Obama "HOPE" poster]].

===Movie posters===

{{Main article|Film poster}}
The [[film]] industry quickly discovered that vibrantly coloured posters were an easy way to sell their pictures. Today, posters are produced for most major films, and the collecting of movie posters has become a major hobby. The record price for a poster was set on November 15, 2005 when US$690,000 was paid for a poster of [[Fritz Lang]]'s 1927 film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' from the Reel Poster Gallery in London.&lt;ref name="metropolis"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4438948.stm |title=Lang film poster fetches record |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-11-15 |accessdate=2009-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early horror and science fiction posters are known to bring tremendous prices as well, with an example from [[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]] realizing $452,000 in a 1997 [[Sotheby's]] auction,&lt;ref name=metropolis /&gt; and posters from both [[The Black Cat (1934 film)|The Black Cat]] and [[Bride of Frankenstein]] selling for $334,600 in various [[Heritage Auctions|Heritage]] Auctions.&lt;ref&gt;http://movieposters.ha.com/common/search_results.php?ic=homepage_search&amp;Nty=1&amp;N=54+790+231&lt;/ref&gt; The 1931 [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]] 6-sheet poster, of which only 1 copy is known to exist, is considered to be the most valuable film poster in the world.&lt;ref&gt;BIRD GEI Consultoria Idiomas. "http://birdgei.com/2012/02/07/film-posters/"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travel posters===
Poster advertising or proposing a travel destination, or simply artistically articulating a place have been made. An example is the [[Beach Town Posters]] series, a collection of Art Deco travel posters of American beach resorts that refer to the advertising style of the 1920s and 1930s.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

====Railway posters====
In the early days of steam railways in Britain, the various rail companies advertised their routes and services on simple printed sheets. By the 1850s, with increasing competition and improvements in printing technology, pictorial designs were being incorporated in their advertising posters. The use of graphic artists began to influence the design of the pictorial poster. In 1905,  the [[London and North Western Railway]] (LNWR) commissioned [[Norman Wilkinson (artist)|Norman Wilkinson]] to produce artwork for a new landscape poster, advertising their rail/steam packet link to Ireland.  In 1908, for the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] (GNR),  [[John Hassall (illustrator)|John Hassall]] produced the famous image of the "Jolly Fisherman" with the "Skegness is so Bracing" slogan.  The development of this commercial art form throughout the first half of the 20th century reflected the changes in British society, along with the changing styles of art, architecture and fashion as well as changing patterns of holidaymaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrm.org.uk/OurCollection/Posters.aspx |title=Railway posters - Our collection - National Railway Museum |publisher=Nrm.org.uk |date=2009-10-13 |accessdate=2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Event posters===

[[Image:Replacing an advertising poster in London using an articulated platform 02.JPG|thumb|right|Replacing an advertising poster in London using an aerial work platform.]]
Posters advertising events have become common. Any sort of public event, from a rally to a play, may be advertised with posters; a few types of events have become notable for their poster advertisements.

====Boxing posters====
Boxing Posters were used in and around the actual venue to advertise the forthcoming fight, date, ticket prices, and usually consisted of pictures of each boxer. Boxing Posters vary in size and vibrancy, but are not usually smaller than 18x22 inches. In the early days, few boxing posters survived the actual event and have thus become a [[collectible]].

====Concert posters====
Many [[concert]]s, particularly [[rock concert]]s, have custom-designed posters that are used for advertisement of the event. These often become collectors items as well.

===Band/music posters===
Posters that showcase a person's favorite artist or music group are popular in [[teenager]]s' bedrooms, as well as in [[college]] [[dorm room]]s and [[apartment]]s. Many posters have pictures of popular [[rock band]]s and artists.

====Blacklight poster====
{{Main article|Blacklight poster}}
Blacklight posters are designed to have a special effect under a [[blacklight]] (ultraviolet light).

===Pin-up posters===
Pinup posters, "pinups," or cheesecake posters are pictures of attractive women designed to be displayed, first coming to popularity in the 1920s. The popularity of sexy [[pin-up girl]] posters has been erratic in recent decades.  Pin-ups such as [[Betty Grable]] and [[Jane Russell]] were highly popular with soldiers during [[World War II]] but much less so during the [[Vietnam War]]. The late 1970s and into the beginning of the 1980s were boom years for large posters of television actresses, especially [[Farrah Fawcett]] and  [[Cheryl Tiegs]].

===Affirmation posters===
[[File:Goals affirmation poster, Navy · DF-SD-04-09850.JPEG|thumb|An example of an [[Affirmation posters|affirmation poster]]]]
{{Main article|Affirmation posters}}
This refers to decorative posters that are meant to be motivational and inspirational. One popular series has a black background, a scene from nature, and a word such as "Leadership" or "Opportunity." Another version (usually [[picture frame|framed]] and matted) uses a two-image [[hologram]] which changes as the viewer walks past.

===Publications===

====Comic book posters====
The resurgence of [[comic book]] popularity in the 1960s led to the mass production of comic book posters in the 1970s and onward.  These posters typically feature popular characters in a variety of action poses.  The fact that comic books are a niche market means that a given poster usually has a smaller printing run than other genres of poster.  Therefore, older posters may be quite sought after by collectors.  Promotional posters are usually distributed folded, whereas retail posters intended for home decoration are rolled.

===Educational posters===

====Research posters and "poster sessions"====
{{Main article|Poster session}}
Posters are used in academia to promote and explain research work. They are typically shown during conferences, either as a complement to a talk or scientific paper, or as a publication. They are of lesser importance than actual articles, but they can be a good introduction to a new piece of research before the paper is published. They may be considered as [[grey literature]]. Poster presentations are often not [[peer-review]]ed,{{Contradict-inline|article=Poster session|reason=Text in the article on Poster Sessions says that the work usually HAS been peer-reviewed.|date=March 2018}} but can instead be submitted, meaning that as many as can fit will be accepted.

====Classroom posters====
Posters are a standard feature of [[classrooms]] worldwide. A typical school in North America will display a variety, including: advertising tie-ins (e.g. an historical movie relevant to a current topic of study); alphabet and grammar; numeracy and scientific tables; safety and other instructions (such as lab safety and proper hand washing) ; artwork and displays by the students.

'''Pressure of speech''' is a tendency to [[Speech communication|speak]] rapidly and frenziedly, as if motivated by an urgency not apparent to the listener.  The speech produced, sometimes called '''pressured speech''', is difficult to interrupt. 

Such speech may be too fast, erratic, irrelevant, or too tangential for the listener to understand. It is an example of [[cluttered speech]], and often associated with certain mental disorders particularly [[mania]] and [[schizophrenia]]. It can be unrelenting, loud and without pauses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing|last = Videbeck|first = Sheila|publisher = Lippincott Williams and Wilkins|year = 2010|isbn = 160547861X|location = |pages = |edition = 5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychological causes ==
Pressure of speech is a classic hallmark of [[mania]] and is often seen during manic periods in patients with [[bipolar disorder]].  The pace of the speech indicates an underlying [[thought disorder]] known as “[[Glossary of psychiatry#Flight of ideas|Flight of ideas]]” wherein the flowing of ideas and information through one's mind is so fast that it is difficult to follow their train of thought. This is also tied to an inability to focus on one topic or task.&lt;ref name="StevensRodin2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lesley Stevens|author2=Ian Rodin|title=Psychiatry: an illustrated colour text|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RMoisJndtvoC&amp;pg=PA24|accessdate=25 November 2010|date=23 April 2001|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-443-05703-8|pages=24–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People with [[schizophrenia]], as well as anyone experiencing extreme [[anxiety]], may also exhibit pressure of speech.  Pressure of speech usually refers to the improperly verbalized speech which is a feature of [[hypomanic]] and manic illness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/cache/-483065844.htm Pressure of Speech - General Practice Notebook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050205204147/http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/cache/-483065844.htm |date=2005-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pressure of speech has commonly been observed in people diagnosed with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]].

== Stimulants ==
[[Psychostimulants]] such as [[cocaine]] or [[amphetamines]] may cause speech resembling pressured speech in individuals with pre-existing psychopathology and produce hypomanic or manic symptoms in general, owing both to the substance's own qualities and the underlying nature of an individual's psyche. In many psychotic disorders, use of certain drugs amplifies certain expressions of symptoms, and stimulant-induced pressured speech is among them.

== Related conditions ==
* [[Cluttering]] is a speech disorder that is related to pressure of speech in that the speech of a clutterer sounds improperly verbalized. However, cluttering is a distinct [[language disorder]], whereas pressure of speech is a symptom of mania, anxiety, or schizophrenia.  Even though cluttering sounds almost identical to pressure of speech, it differs in that pressure of speech is rooted in [[anxiety]], where cluttering is not.
* Pressure of speech is an instance of [[tachylalia]], or rapid speech.  Pressure of speech is also variously related to [[agitolalia]], [[agitophasia]], [[tachyphasia]], and [[verbomania]].
* [[Circumstantial speech]] is a [[communication disorder]] in which the focus of a conversation drifts, but often comes back to the point.&lt;ref name=BG &gt;''Problem-Based Psychiatry'' by Ben Green 2009 {{ISBN|1-84619-042-8}} page 15&lt;/ref&gt; In circumstantiality, unnecessary details and irrelevant remarks cause a delay in getting to the point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dorlands.com/|title=Dorlands.com|website=www.dorlands.com|access-date=2017-03-05|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229082507/http://dorlands.com/|archivedate=2016-12-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stutter formation ==
Pressured speech may also lead to the development of a [[stuttering|stutter]]. The person's need or pressure to speak causes them to involuntarily stutter. Therefore, the person's need to express themselves is greater than their ability to vocalise their thoughts.&lt;ref name="Boberg1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Einer Boberg|title=Neuropsychology of stuttering|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HjB9cGkloPgC&amp;pg=PA226|accessdate=13 December 2010|date=1 January 1993|publisher=University of Alberta|isbn=978-0-88864-239-4|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, a '''railway post office''', commonly abbreviated as '''RPO''', was a [[railroad]] car that was normally operated in passenger service as a means to sort [[mail]] en route, in order to speed delivery.  The RPO was staffed by highly trained [[Railway Mail Service]] postal clerks, and was off-limits to the passengers on the [[passenger train|train]].  In the UK and Ireland, the equivalent term was [[Travelling Post Offices in the United Kingdom|Travelling Post Office]] (TPO).

From the middle of the 19th century, many American railroads earned substantial revenues through contracts with the  [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Post Office Department (USPOD)]] to carry mail aboard high-speed passenger trains; and the Railway Mail Service enforced various standardized designs on RPOs. In fact, a number of companies maintained passenger routes where the financial losses from moving people were more than offset by transporting the mail.

==History==
The world's first official carriage of mail by rail was by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom's]] [[General Post Office]] in November 1830, using adapted railway carriages on the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]]. Sorting of mail en route first occurred in the United Kingdom with the introduction of the [[Travelling Post Offices in the United Kingdom|Travelling Post Office]] in 1838 on the [[Grand Junction Railway]]&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="White 472" /&gt; following the introduction of the [[Railways (Conveyance of Mails) Act 1838]].

In the United States, some references suggest that the first shipment of mail carried on a train (sorted at the endpoints and merely carried in a bag on the train with other baggage) occurred in 1831 on the [[South Carolina Rail Road]].  Other sources state that the first official contract to regularly carry mail on a train was made with the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] in either 1834 or 1835.  The [[United States Congress]] officially designated all railroads as official postal routes on July 7, 1838.&lt;ref name="White 472"&gt;White, p 472.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar services were introduced on Canadian railroads in 1859.&lt;ref name="White 473"&gt;White, p 473&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:First RPO 1862 ppc.jpeg|left|thumb|The first RPO (1862)]]
The Railway post office was introduced in the United States on July 28, 1862, using converted [[baggage car]]s on the [[Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad]] (which also delivered the first letter to the [[Pony Express]]).  Purpose-built Railway Post Office (RPO) cars entered service on this line a few weeks after the service was initiated.  Their purpose was to separate mail for connection with a westbound stagecoach departing soon after the train's arrival at St. Joseph.  This service lasted approximately one year.&lt;ref name="White 475"&gt;White, p 475.&lt;/ref&gt; The first permanent Railway Post Office route was established on August 28, 1864, between [[Chicago, Illinois]], and [[Clinton, Iowa]].&lt;ref name="ClassicTrains-First"&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Classic Trains| title=First as well as fast|date=Fall 2006| volume=7| issue=3|page=27| issn=1527-0718 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This service is distinguished from the 1862 operation because mail was sorted to and received from each post office along the route, as well as major post offices beyond the route's end-points.

George B. Armstrong, assistant postmaster at Chicago, originally came up with the idea of having mail processed and distributed while the mail was on board, en route in mail cars. With the assistance of Schuyler Colfax, Speaker of the House at the time, and A. N. Zevely, Third Assistant Postmaster General, he was duly authorized to test his ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catskillarchive.com/rrextra/mails.Html CATSKILL ARCHIVE: GEORGE B. ARMSTRONG]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Great Northern RPO No 42 interior.jpg|thumb|upright|An interior view of [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] #42, a restored RPO on display at the [[California State Railroad Museum]] in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]].]]
In 1869, the [[Railway Mail Service]] (RMS), headed by [[George B. Armstrong]], was officially inaugurated to handle the transportation and sorting of mail aboard trains.  Armstrong was promoted from a supervisory position in the Chicago post office following his experiments in 1864 with a converted route agent's car on runs between Chicago and Clinton, Iowa.&lt;ref name="White 475-6"&gt;White, pp 475-476.&lt;/ref&gt;

RPO car interiors, which at first consisted of solid wood furniture and fixtures, would also soon be redesigned.  In 1879, an RMS employee named Charles R. Harrison developed a new set of fixtures that soon gained widespread use.  Harrison's design consisted of hinged, cast-iron fixtures that could be unfolded and set up in a number of configurations to hold mail pouches, racks and a sorting table as needed for specific routes.  The fixtures were also designed so they could be folded away completely to provide a wholly open space to carry general baggage and express shipments as needed by the railroads.  Harrison followed through with manufacturing his design at a factory he opened in [[Fond du Lac, Wisconsin]] in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp 481-482.&lt;/ref&gt;

The July 1, 1862, [[Pacific Railroad Act]] signed by [[Abraham Lincoln|President Lincoln]] established government funding for the construction of a railroad from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean with the express idea of opening a main line mail route across the western frontier. The act was officially entitled ''"AN ACT to aid in the construction of a railroad and telegraph line from the Missouri river to the Pacific Ocean, and to secure to the government the use of the same for postal, military, and other purposes,"''    The Act opened the door to government funded railroad mail routes across the American continent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cprr.org/Museum/Pacific_Railroad_Acts.html Central Pacific Railroad Photographic History Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Railway Post Office at work 1965.JPG|thumb|A working RPO on the [[Chicago and North Western Transportation Company|Chicago and North Western]] in 1965.]]
By the 1880s, railway post office routes were operating on the vast majority of [[passenger train]]s in the United States. A complex network of interconnected routes allowed mail to be transported and delivered in a remarkably short time. Railway mail clerks were subjected to stringent training and ongoing testing of details regarding their handling of the mail.  On a given RPO route, each clerk was expected to know not only the post offices and rail junctions along the route, but also specific local delivery details within each of the larger cities served by the route. Periodic testing demanded both accuracy and speed in sorting mail, and a clerk scoring ''only'' 96% accuracy would likely receive a warning from the Railway Mail Service division superintendent. [[Interurban]] and [[Streetcar]] systems were also known to operate RPOs. The [[Boston Elevated Railway]] car being noted as making circuits of the city to pick up mail.&lt;ref&gt;Trolley Car Treasury by Frank Rowsome Jr. McGraw-Hill New York 1956 Library of Congress 56-11054&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, RPO cars (also known as '''mail cars''' or '''postal''' cars) were equipped and staffed to handle most back-end postal processing functions. First class mail, magazines and newspapers were all sorted, cancelled when necessary, and dispatched to post offices in towns along the route. Registered mail was also handled, and the foreman in charge was required to carry a regulation pistol while on duty to discourage theft of the mail.

==Standardization==
[[File:Interior of Great Northern Railway Post Office Car 42.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Interior of Great Northern Railway Post Office Car 42 at the California State Railroad Museum]] Because of the physical and mental demands placed on RPO clerks, the Railway Mail Service pushed the adoption of standardized floor plans and fixtures for all RPO cars, with the first plans published in 1885.  The RMS also pressed for improved lighting fixtures to help the clerks see the addresses on the mail they sorted, first by improving the reflectors in the 1880s, then calling for discontinuance of [[Kerosene lamp|oil lamps]] in the 1890s and the first experiments with electric lighting in 1912.  Clerks' safety was also of great concern to the RMS, with the first comprehensive statistics on work-related injuries published in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;White, p 482.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the second half of the 19th century, most RPO cars were painted in a somewhat uniform color scheme regardless of the railroad that owned or operated them.  Most were painted white with trim in either buff, red or blue, which made the cars stand out from the other cars.  By the 1890s, this practice had waned as railroads painted their RPO cars to match the rest of their passenger equipment.  One RPO car that was displayed at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago is one of the last known examples of the early white color scheme.&lt;ref name="White 480"&gt;White, p 480.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the development of [[Passenger car (rail)|passenger car]]s progressed, so too did the development of RPO cars.  The first plans for RPO car designs were based on light [[baggage car]] frames and bodies, which sometimes resulted in catastrophe for RMS employees when the trains were involved in accidents. From 1900 to 1906 some 70 workers were killed in train wrecks while on duty in the RPOs, leading to demands for stronger steel cars.&lt;ref name=DM&gt;[[Daily Mirror]] March 16, 1906 p6 Last night's news&lt;/ref&gt; The RMS developed its first standards for car design in 1891 to address some of these issues.&lt;ref&gt;White, p 483.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, the Railway Mail Service developed a set of strength requirements for new cars in an effort to push the car building companies into using [[steel]] for the cars' major structural components and underframes.  The core of the requirements was that each car should be able to withstand a buffer force of at least 400,000 pounds.  This requirement was doubled to 800,000 pounds in a 1938 revision of the standards.  The requirements were again strengthened in 1945 with specifications that precluded the use of [[aluminium]] for framing and major structural components.  The 1945 revisions also included a requirement for end posts to prevent telescoping in the event of a collision.  Car manufacturers adopted these requirements and carried them through to all other models of passenger cars that they built.&lt;ref name="White 190"&gt;White, p 190.&lt;/ref&gt; The 800,000 lb buffer load and end post requirements were later adopted by the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] (ICC) for all passenger MU locomotives as of April 1, 1956&lt;ref&gt;49 CFR Part 229.141, 2015 edition (10-1-2015) https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2015-title49-vol4/xml/CFR-2015-title49-vol4-sec229-141.xml&lt;/ref&gt;  and to all passenger cars and locomotives in 1999 by the USDOT.&lt;ref&gt;49 CFR Part 238, Subpart C, U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Railroad Administration, 2015 edition https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2015-title49-vol4/xml/CFR-2015-title49-vol4-part238-subpartC.xml&lt;/ref&gt;
An interesting feature of most RPO cars was a hook that could be used to snatch a leather or canvas pouch of outgoing mail hanging on a track-side [[Mail hook|mail crane]] at smaller towns where the train did not stop.  The first US patent for such a device ({{US patent|61584}}) was awarded to L.F. Ward of Elyria, Ohio, on January 29, 1867.&lt;ref name="White 476"&gt;White, p 476.&lt;/ref&gt; With the train often operating at 70&amp;nbsp;mph or more, a postal clerk would have a pouch of mail ready to be dispatched as the train passed the station.  In a co-ordinated movement, the catcher arm was swung out to catch the hanging mail pouch while the clerk stood in the open doorway.  As the inbound pouch slammed into the catcher arm, the clerk kicked the outbound mail pouch out of the car, making certain to kick it far enough that it was not sucked back under the train.  An employee of the local post office would retrieve the pouch and deliver it to the post office.

In the 1950s the [[Budd Company]] offered two versions of its self-propelled diesel [[Budd Rail Diesel Car|RDC]] with RPO: the RDC-3 combine and the RDC-4 (a baggage/mail/express only unit). These models were purchased by the [[New York Central]], [[Boston &amp; Maine]], [[New Haven Railroad]], [[Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific|Rock Island]], [[Pacific Great Eastern]], [[Northern Pacific]], [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], [[Canadian National]] and [[Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis]].&lt;ref&gt;Budd Company Red Lion Plant Order List, Philadelphia Chapter of the National Railway Historical Society. http://www.trainweb.org/phillynrhs/BuddCarOrders.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cancellation stamps==
{{Main|Postal Transportation Service}}
Most RPO cars had a mail slot on the side of the car, so that mail could actually be deposited in the car, much like using the corner mail box, while the train was stopped at a station.  Those desiring the fastest delivery would bring their letters to the train station for dispatch on the RPO, knowing that overnight delivery would be virtually assured.  The mail handled in this manner received a [[Cancellation (mail)|cancellation]] just as if it had been mailed at a local post office, with the cancel giving the train number, endpoint cities of the RPO route, the date, and '''RMS''' Railway Mail Service or '''PTS''' [[Postal Transportation Service]] between the killer bars.  Collecting such cancellations is a pastime of many [[philatelist]]s and [[postal history]] researchers.

The Railway Mail Service organization within the [[Post Office Department]] existed between 1864 and September 30, 1948.  It was renamed the Postal Transportation Service on October 1, 1948, and existed until 1960.  After 1960, the management of railway post office routes as well as [[Highway Post Office]] routes, [[Air Mail Facility]], [[Terminal Railway Post Office]], and [[Transfer Office]], were shifted to the [[Bureau of Transportation]].

==Decline and withdrawal==
At their height, RPO cars were used on over 9,000 train routes covering more than 200,000 route miles in North America.  While the majority of this service consisted of one or more cars at the head end of passenger trains, many railways operated solid mail trains between major cities; these solid mail trains would often carry 300 tons of mail daily.&lt;ref name="White 472" /&gt;&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;As the United States Postal Service undergoes its fiscal crisis in the second decade of the 21st Century, it is well to note that these are not entirely new problems. A national pick up and delivery system to remote and small locales is a fiscally challenging model. "A Congressional Investigation of the United States Post Office Department in 1900 disclosed that postal expeditures were not and, in some cases, could not be apportioned to revenues. A remarkable anomaly in Maine, at the intersection of mail bags and a printing press, provided, at the time, a basis for costing questions of policy and regulation and, for us now, an understanding of the postal commons in its Golden Age." {{cite web |url=http://postalmuseum.si.edu/Symposium2011/papers/DeBlois-1900.pdf |title=It’s in the Bag" – The Shape of Turn-of-the-Century Mail |first1=Diane |last1=DeBlois |first2=Robert Dalton |last2=Harris |accessdate=August 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RPO-cancel-w.jpg|thumb|'''R.P.O.''' postal cancellation applied to mail handled in the railway post office car of [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway]]'s [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] &amp; [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] train No. 5, the inaugural eastbound run of the ''City of Memphis''.&lt;ref&gt;''Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railway: The Dixie Line'' by Charles B. Castner, Jr. page 92 {{ISBN|0-911868-87-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
After 1948, the railway post office network began its decline although it remained the principal intercity mail transportation and distribution function within the Post Office Department (POD). There were 794 RPO lines operating over 161,000 miles of railroad in that year.  Only 262 RPO routes were still operating by January 1, 1962.  In 1942, the POD began experimenting with a highway version of the RPO to serve the same purposes along routes where passenger train service was not available.  These '''highway post office''' (HPO) vehicles were initially intended to supplement RPO service, but in the 1950s and 1960s, HPOs often replaced railway post office cars after passenger train service was discontinued. The last [[interurban]] RPO service was operated by [[Pacific Electric Railway]] on its route between [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Bernardino, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Demoro, Harre W.| title=California's Electric Railways| publisher=[[Interurban Press]]|location=[[Glendale, California]]| year=1986| page=19| isbn=0-916374-74-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the post office made a controversial policy change to process mail in large regional "sectional centers," mail was now sorted by large machines, not by people, and the remaining railway post office routes, along with all highway post office routes, were phased out of service. In September 1967 the POD cancelled all "mail by rail" contracts, electing to move all First Class mail via air and other classes by road (truck) transport. This announcement had a devastating effect on passenger train revenues; the Santa Fe, for example, lost $35 million (US) in annual business, and led directly to the ending of many passenger rail routes.

After 113 years of railway post office operation, the last surviving railway post office running on rails between New York and [[Washington, D.C.]] was discontinued on June 30, 1977. The last route with a railway post office title was actually a boat run that lasted a year longer. This [[Boat Railway Post Office]] was the Lake Winnipesaukee RPO operating between [[Weirs Beach, New Hampshire|The Weirs, New Hampshire]], and [[Bear Island (Lake Winnipesaukee)|Bear Island]] on [[Lake Winnipesaukee]].  The final date it operated with a [[postmark]] was September 30, 1978.

== Preservation ==
[[File:Interurban Railway Museum October 2015 13 (Texas Electric Railway Car 360).jpg|thumb|The RPO section of preserved [[Texas Electric Railway]] Car 360, at the [[Interurban Railway Museum]] in [[Plano, Texas]]]]

Many RPO cars have been preserved in railroad museums across North America; some of the cars are kept in operational condition.  In 1933, [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]] rebuilt one of its baggage cars into a replica of the first RPOs that were used on the Hannibal and St. Joseph in 1862.  The railroad displayed the car in several cities along the railroad; it now resides at the [[Patee House Museum]] in [[St. Joseph, Missouri]].&lt;ref name="ClassicTrains-First" /&gt;

The Minnesota Transportation Museum (MTM) maintains Northern Pacific #1102, a 1914 Mail RPO, that is classed as a "combine" car, having sections for the RPO, Railway Express Agency and twenty seats for paying passengers. Currently, it is the only Railway Post Office car known to be operational and currently certified for operation on commercial rail. The Osceola &amp; St Croix Valley Railway (division of MTM/reporting mark MNTX) operates the car as part of its tour line, actually "catching the mail on the fly" as a part of its regular runs.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

As part of the 40th anniversary of the end of RPO service, Minnesota Transportation Museum will be placing #1102 on display at Saint Paul Union Depot as part of its "Last Mail Train" for National Train Day, 6 May 2017. At the end of the day, [[Great Northern 400]], Northern Pacific RPO #1102 and two coaches will be departing Union Depot as Train #1 bound for Osceola, Wisconsin. It will be hauling commemorative envelopes and cards to be sent all across the United States, following which it will operate in regular service as part of the Museum operations out of Osceola, WI.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

[[Steamtown National Historic Site]] in Scranton, PA has RPO car #1100, Louisville &amp; Nashville, on display. It is an all-steel car built in 1914 by the [[American Car and Foundry Company]].

Tory Higgins]] regarding people's [[perceptions]] in the [[decision making]] process. RFT examines the relationship between the [[motivation]] of a person and the way in which they go about achieving their [[goal]].&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, E: "Making a Good Decision: Value From Fit", ''American Psychologist'' 55(11):1217&lt;/ref&gt; RFT posits two separate and independent self-regulatory orientations: prevention and promotion (Higgins, 1997).

This psychological [[theory]], like many others, is applied in [[communication]], specifically in the subfields of [[nonverbal communication]] and [[persuasion]].Chronic regulatory focus is measured using the Regulatory Focus Questionnaire (Higgins et al., 2001) or the Regulatory Strength measure. Momentary regulatory focus can be primed or induced.

==Background==

===Regulatory fit theory===
To understand RFT, it is important to understand another of [[E. Tory Higgins]]' [[theories]]: regulatory fit theory. When a person believes that there is "fit", they will involve themselves more in what they are doing and "feel right" about it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Higgins, E. T. (2005). Value From Regulatory Fit. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 14(4), 209–213. {{doi|10.1111/j.0963-7214.2005.00366.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|209}}  Regulatory fit should not directly affect the [[hedonic]] occurrence of a thing or occasion, but should influence a person's assurance in their reaction to the [[Object (philosophy)|object]] or event.

Regulatory fit theory suggests that a match between orientation to a goal and the means used to approach that goal produces a state of regulatory fit that both creates a feeling of rightness about the goal pursuit and increases task engagement (Higgins, 2001, 2005). Regulatory fit intensifies responses, such as the value of a chosen object, persuasion, and job satisfaction&lt;ref&gt;Kruglanski, A. W., Pierro, A., &amp; Higgins, E. T. (2007). Regulatory Mode and Preferred Leadership Styles: How Fit Increases Job Satisfaction. Basic and Applied Social Psychology, 29(2), 137–149. {{doi|10.1080/01973530701331700}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Regulatory fit does not increase the assessment of a [[decision making|decision]]; instead when someone feels "right" about their decision, the [[experience]] of "correctness and importance" is transferred to the ensuing assessment of the chosen [[Object (philosophy)|object]], increasing its superficial worth.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Avnet, T: "Locomotion, assessment, and regulatory fit: Value transfer from 'how' to 'what'", Journal of Experimental Psychology 39(5):525&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that the "feeling right" [[experience]] can then sway [[retrospective]] or prospective evaluations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Regulatory fit can be manipulated incidentally (outside the context of interest) or integrally (within the context of interest).

===Definition===
RFT refers to when a person pursues a [[goal]] in a way that maintains the person's own personal [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]s and [[beliefs]], also known as ''regulatory orientation''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; This [[theory]] operates on the basic [[principle]] that people embrace [[pleasure]] but avoid [[suffering|pain]], and they then maintain their regulatory fit based on this standard.

The ''regulatory focus'' is basically the way in which someone approaches pleasure but avoids pain. An individual's regulatory focus concentrates on desired end-states, and the approach [[motivation]] used to go from the current state to the desired end-state. This theory differentiates between a ''promotion-focus'' on [[hope]]s and accomplishments, also known as gains. This focus is more concerned with higher level gains such as advancement and accomplishment.&lt;ref name=Higgins&gt;Higgins, E: "Achievement orientations from subjective histories of success: promotion pride versus prevention pride", ''European Journal of Social Psychology''. 31(1):4&lt;/ref&gt;

Another focus is the ''prevention-focus'' based on [[safety]] and [[moral responsibility|responsibilities]], also known as non-losses. This focus emphasizes security and safety by following the guidelines and the rules.&lt;ref name=Higgins/&gt;

These two regulatory focuses regulate the influences that a person would be exposed to in the [[decision-making]] process, and determine the different ways they achieve their goal, as discussed by RFT. An individual's regulatory orientation is not necessarily fixed. While individuals have [[Habit (psychology)|chronic]] tendencies towards either promotion or prevention, these preferences may not hold for all situations. Furthermore, a specific regulatory focus can be [[wikt:induce|induced]].

The [[Value (ethics)|value]] taken from interaction and goal attainment can be either positive or negative. The decision has positive value when people attempt to attain their goal in a way that fits their regulatory orientation and it will have negative value when people attempt to attain their goal in a way that does not fit their regulatory orientation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Regulatory fit allows value to be created by intensifying the commitment, based on one of the regulatory focus orientations. Making [[choices]] and fulfilling [[objective (goal)|objective]]s are considered as activities, and with any activity, people can be more or less involved. When this involvement is strong, it can intensify the feelings and values about this activity, and the approach to the activity determines whether they are or are not satisfied with the outcome and method of achieving the outcome.

This theory has noteworthy implications for increasing the value of life.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} For example, in [[interpersonal]] conflict, if each person experiences "fit", each one will be satisfied with and committed to the outcome. In the broad sense, for people to appreciate their own lives, they need to be satisfied and "feel right" about what they are doing, and the way they are doing it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{rp|210}} If it is not satisfying, it is known as "non-fit", and they will not reach their desired goal.

===Goal attainment and motivation===
Regulatory focus theory, according to Higgins, views motivation in a way that allows an understanding of the foundational ways we approach a task or a [[goal]].&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, E. (1997, December) Beyond pleasure and pain. ''American Psychologist'', 52(12):1281&lt;/ref&gt; Different factors can motivate people during goal pursuit, and we self-regulate our methods and processes during our goal pursuit. RFT proposes that motivational strength is enhanced when the manner in which people work toward a goal sustains their regulatory orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Spiegel, S: "How regulatory fit enhances motivational strength during goal pursuit", European Journal of Social Psychology. 34(1):40&lt;/ref&gt; Achieving a goal in a way that is consistent to a person's regulatory orientation leads to an [[individual]] sense of importance to the event. The impact of [[motivation]] is considered calculated and this creates a greater sense of commitment to the goal. The more strongly an individual is engaged (i.e., involved, occupied, fully engrossed) in an activity, the more intense the motivational force experienced. Engagement is of great importance to attain and motivate in order to reach a goal. Engagement serves as intensifier of the directional component of the value experience. An individual who is strongly engaged in a goal pursuits will experience a positive target more positively and a negative target more negatively.

Individuals can pursue different goals with diverse regulatory orientations and in unlike ways. There are two different kinds of regulatory orientations that people use to obtain their goals: ''promotion-focus orientation'' and ''prevention-focus orientation''. These terms are derived from [[E. Tory Higgins]]'s Theory of Regulatory Focus. In which, he adds to the notion that people regulate their goal-oriented behavior in two very distinct ways, coined ''promotion-focus orientation'' and ''prevention-focus orientation''

[[E. Tory Higgins]] uses this example: there is Student A and Student B, and they both have the shared goal to make an ''A'' in a class they are both taking in college. Student A uses a ''promotion-focus orientation'' which slants them towards achieving their goal and towards advancement, growth and life accomplishment. This would cause Student A to view the goal as an [[ideal (ethics)|ideal]] that satisfies their need for accomplishment. Student B uses a ''prevention-focus orientation'' where the goal is something that should be realized because it fulfills their need for [[security]], [[Safety|protection]] and prevention of negative outcomes. Student A uses an eager approach where they read extra materials to obtain their goal of an ''A''. Student B uses a vigilant approach where they become more detail oriented and pay careful attention to completing all of the course requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, R., &amp; Buss, D. (2009). Personality psychology: domains of knowledge about human nature. (4th ed., p. 388).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Completed RFT flowchart 3.jpg]]

Both forms of regulatory orientation can work to fulfill goals, but the choice of [[orientation (mental)|orientation]] is based on individual [[preference]]s and style. When a person pursues their goal in the focus that fits their regulatory orientation, they are more likely to pursue their goal more eagerly and aggressively than if they were using the other focus.In this case each student has different styles. They both feel more comfortable in persuading their goal. The outcome in this experiment would have been different if the students were given an undesirable choice.

When people make decisions, they often envision the possible "[[pleasure]] or [[suffering|pain]]" of the possible outcomes that the focus orientation will produce.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{rp|209}} A person imagining making a pleasing choice is more likely to engage in promotion-focus orientation because envisioning the possible outcome of success maintains eagerness about the outcome but does not place importance on [[Vigilance (psychology)|vigilance]]. A person imagining the possible [[suffering|pain]] by making an undesirable choice maintains more vigilance but less eagerness.

A person with promotion-focus orientation is more likely to remember the occasions where the goal is pursued by using eagerness approaches and less likely to remember occasions where the goal is pursued by vigilance approaches. A person with prevention-focus orientation is more likely to remember events where the goal is pursued by means of vigilance than if it was pursued using eagerness approaches.

==Application==

===Regulatory focus theory and persuasion===
When relating regulatory focus theory to [[persuasion]], it is important to remember that RFT is a [[goal]]-attainment [[theory]], and that RFT can spawn feelings of rightness/wrongness which in turn may produce formulations for [[judgment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughn, A: "'This story is right on': The impact of regulatory fit on narrative engagement and persuasion", European Journal of Social Psychology. 39:448&lt;/ref&gt;

The feelings of rightness give an [[individual]] more commitment to the [[information]] coming in and therefore can avoid endangering their regulatory fit which in turn changes their regulatory focus and accepting a probable motive to change. If a person experiences feelings of wrongness they will suffer negative [[emotion]]s and deem the [[experience]] 
and information as a [[threat]] to their regulatory fit and therefore a threat to their regulatory focus and their [[goal]].

Studies have been done where fit and focus have been applied to show their applicability to [[consumer]] [[purchasing]], health advisories, and [[social policy]] issues.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;{{rp|446}} To be persuaded is to change your prior feelings, actions, and/or beliefs on a matter to where you agree with the persuader.

The "fit" involved in RFT plays a large role in such issues and stories because it can be a device to help an [[individual]] receive and review the experience during a particular [[message]] delivery. [[Positive reinforcement]] and [[feeling]]s of rightness while decoding the [[message]] creates a stronger engagement and relationship with processing the [[message]], and [[negative reinforcement]] and feelings of wrongness lessens the engagement and [[Attachment theory|attachment]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;{{rp|449}}

[[Researcher]]s found that targeting the two different regulatory focus orientations, and their coinciding types of fit, works as an effective process to aid in [[persuasive]] charm or pull when they introduced a manner of [[persuasion]] where the framing of the [[message]] was everything and the content was [[irrelevant]] to uphold or interrupt a person's regulatory fit and follow the pattern of logic used in regulatory orientation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;{{rp|446}}

Lee and Aaker (2004) conducted an [[experiment]] that involved whether or not to give their information in a prevention-focus- or promotion-focus-concerning way. The study involved an [[advertisement]] for a grape juice drink, which they split into two to create prevention-focus concerns (disease-preventing) and then promotion-focus concerns (energy enhancement).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;{{rp|449}} In doing so, they demonstrated that rather than trying to know each [[individual]] recipient's qualities, one needs only to start by nailing the focus (prevention/promotion) and then framing the [[message]] so that it creates that "rightness".

Some may confuse RFT with regulatory fit, regulatory relevance, message matching, and source attractiveness in such an example. The extent of similarities between closely related [[theories]] of RFT, such as ones stated above, make it hard to clarify when this theory is applicable or apparent in respect to the [[persuasion]] process.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;{{rp|444–5}}

===Regulatory focus theory and nonverbal communication===
RFT can be a useful outline for a better understanding of the effects of [[nonverbal]] cues in [[persuasion]] and [[impression formation]]. Regulatory Fit Theory suggests that the effect of a cue cannot be understood without remembering what the cue means given a recipient's focus orientation.&lt;ref name="Cesario 2008"&gt;Cesario, J., Higgins, E. (2008 May) Making Message Recipients "Feel Right": How Nonverbal Cues Can Increase Persuasion. Psychological Science, 19(5)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|419}}

[[Nonverbal]] cues can be used by the [[message]] source to vary delivery style, more specifically to convey eagerness or vigilance, of a given message in a way that will produce regulatory fit in message recipients of different focus orientations.

Advancement implies eager movement forward, so eagerness is conveyed by gestures that involve animated, broad opening movements such as hand movements projecting outward, forward leaning body positions, fast body movement, and fast [[speech]] rate. Caution implies vigilant carefulness, so vigilance should be conveyed by [[gesture]]s that show precision like slightly backward-leaning body positions, slower body movement, and slower speech rate.

An eager [[nonverbal]] delivery style will result in greater [[message]] effectiveness for promotion-focus recipients than for prevention-focus recipients, while the opposite is true for a vigilant [[nonverbal]] style.

There are various aspects, which may contribute to whether or not a [[message]]'s [[persuasive]] element is successful. One aspect is the effect of [[nonverbal]] cues and their association with [[persuasive]] appeals based on the [[message]] recipient's [[motivation]]al regulatory orientation. This determines the recipient's impression of the source during [[impression formation]].

Research has found that [[nonverbal]] cues are an essential element of most [[persuasive]] appeals. RFT creates the background that allows a [[prediction]] for when and for whom a [[nonverbal]] cue can have an effect on [[persuasion]]. When [[nonverbal]] cues and signals are used appropriately, they increase the effectiveness of [[persuasion]].&lt;ref name="Cesario 2008"/&gt;{{rp|415}}

In [[computer science]], '''SLR grammars''' are the class of [[formal grammar]]s accepted by a [[Simple LR parser]].  SLR grammars are a superset of all LR(0) grammars and a subset of all LALR(1) and LR(1) grammars.

When processed by an SLR parser, an SLR grammar is converted into parse tables with no shift/reduce or reduce/reduce conflicts for any combination of LR(0) parser state and expected lookahead symbol.  If the grammar is not SLR, the parse tables will have shift/reduce conflicts or reduce/reduce conflicts for some state and some lookahead symbols, and the resulting rejected parser is no longer deterministic.  The parser cannot decide whether to shift or reduce next, or cannot decide between two candidate reductions.  SLR parsers use a Follow(A) calculation to pick the lookahead symbols to expect for every completed nonterminal.  

[[LALR parser]]s use a different calculation which sometimes gives smaller, tighter lookahead sets for the same parser states.  Those smaller sets can eliminate overlap with the state's shift actions, and overlap with lookaheads for other reductions in this same state.  The overlap conflicts reported by SLR parsers are then spurious, a result of the approximate calculation using Follow(A).

A grammar which is ambiguous will have unavoidable shift/reduce conflicts or reduce/reduce conflicts for every LR analysis method, including SLR.  A common way for computer language grammars to be ambiguous is if some nonterminal is both left- and right-recursive:
::Expr → Expr * Val
::Expr → Val + Expr
::Expr → Val


== Definitions ==
A rule of the form ''B → y •'' within a state of a SLR(1) automaton is said to be irreducible or in a ''reduced state'' because it has been completely expanded and is incapable of undergoing any shift transition. Rules in this state will have a dot ( • , the current look-ahead position) located at the rightmost end of its RHS (Right Hand Side).

== Rules ==
A Grammar is said to be SLR(1) if and only if, for each and every state ''s'' in the SLR(1) automaton, none of the following conditions are violated:

# For any reducible rule ''A → a • Xb'' in state ''s'' (where ''X'' is some terminal), there must not exist some irreducible rule, ''B → a •'' in the same state ''s'' such that the ''follow'' set of B contains the terminal ''X''. In more formal terms, the intersection of set containing the terminal ''X'' and the follow set of ''B'' must be empty. Violation of this rule is a '''Shift-Reduce Conflict'''.
# For any two complete items ''A → a •'' and ''B → b •'' in ''s'', ''Follow(A)'' and ''Follow(B)'' are disjoint (their intersection is the empty set). Violation of this rule is a '''Reduce-Reduce Conflict'''.

== Parsing algorithm ==
A grammar is said to be SLR(1) if the following [[simple LR parser]] algorithm results in no ambiguity.
# If state ''s'' contains any item of the form ''A → a • Xb'', where ''X'' is a terminal, and ''X'' is the next token in the input string, then the action is to shift the current input token onto the stack, and the new state to be pushed on the stack is the state containing the item ''A → aX • b''.
# If state ''s'' contains the complete item ''A → y •'' , and the next token in the input string is in ''Follow(A)'', then the action is to reduce by the rule ''A → y''. A reduction by the rule ''S' → S'', where ''S'' is the start state, is equivalent to acceptance; this will happen only if the next input token is ''$''. In all other cases, the new state in computed as follows. Remove the string ''y'' and all of its corresponding states from the parsing stack. Correspondingly, back up in the DFA to the state from which the construction of ''y'' began. By construction, this state must contain an item of the form ''B → a • Ab''. Push ''A'' on to the stack, and push the state containing the item ''B → aA • b''.
# If the next input token is such that neither of the above two cases applies, an error is declared.

'''SuperWrite''' is an English [[shorthand]] system based largely on previous shorthand systems and largely intended for people who need to increase their writing speed without devoting months to learning more complicated systems.  It is a [[writing system]], as it uses cursive forms of the letters of the spoken [[alphabet]] to represent sounds.  Aside from assigning special [[Abbreviation|abbreviations]] to [[common words]], the system functions largely by omitting short [[Vowel|vowels]] from within words.  Hence, SuperWrite could be considered an impure [[abjad]].  Its publishers claim it uses only the 26 letters of the [[longhand]] alphabet with no extra [[Symbol|symbols]], however, the [[Letter case|capital letters]] used (C, O, S, T, U, X) have different functions from their [[lowercase]] forms, and the uncrossed '''t''' — which would be considered a mistake in longhand — has a different function from the crossed '''t''', bringing the total number of symbols in SuperWrite to 33.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Lemaster | first=A James | year=1990 | title=SuperWrite : alphabetic writing system.

'''Tata-tonga''' ({{lang-mn|Тататунга}}, [[Mongolian script]]: {{Mongolunicode|ᠲᠠᠲᠠᠲᠤᠩᠭ᠎ᠠ}}, ''{{lang|mn-Latn|Tatatungү{{nbh}}a}}'', {{zh|c=塔塔统阿|p=Tǎtǎ-tǒng'ā}}) was a [[Naimans|Yugur]] man involved in bringing and adapting the [[Old Uyghur alphabet]] to [[Mongolia]] in what is called the [[traditional Mongolian alphabet]] (Mongol bichig or hurdum bichig).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YLQW5lUajgkC&amp;pg=PA398&amp;lpg=PA398&amp;dq=%22Tata-tonga%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MkUutsYH3C&amp;sig=0_Vbz8TIylsEiLs61odq0OHoatA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1fVNTIr6FYXgnAew4oHYCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=12&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwCw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Tata-tonga%22&amp;f=false A history of Russia, Central Asia, and Mongolia] by David Christian&lt;/ref&gt; He was captured by [[Genghis Khan]] in the 13th century and soon taught the Old Uyghur [[alphabet]] to members of the court and adapted it, to match the Mongol [[Khalkha]] {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} language, although Genghis (or Chingis) himself never learned it.

The Uyghur script was used in Mongolia until its independence from [[Qing dynasty]] China, at the beginning of the 20th century and few years before Russia introduced [[Cyrillic]]. It is still used mainly in [[Inner-Mongolia]]. In current day Mongolia, Cyrillic is the official script for the Mongolian language, and the traditional script is referred to as the ''Old Mongol script'' ({{lang-mn|Хуучин монгол бичиг}}). Today, an estimated 6 million Mongolians from China can still read the traditional Mongolian script but only 3 million from Mongolia.

The [[Manchu alphabet]] was derived since the very end of the 16th century from this Mongolian script.

'''Telegraphic speech''', according to [[linguistics]] and [[psychology]], is speech during the [[Critical period#Linguistics|two-word stage]] of [[language acquisition]] in children, which is laconic and efficient.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, S. (2004). ''Psychology (2nd ed.).'' Boston: Pearson Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name derives from the fact that someone sending a [[Telegraphy|telegram]] was generally charged by the word. To save money, people typically wrote their telegrams in [[Telegram style|a very compressed style]], without [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunctions]] or [[Article (grammar)|articles]]. As children develop language, they speak similarly: when a child says "Daddy here", it is understood that the child means "Daddy is here", omitting the copula. The words dropped in this style of speech are [[closed class]] or [[function word|function]] words.

In the field of [[psychology]], telegraphic speech is defined as a form of communication consisting of simple two-word long sentences often composed of a noun and a verb that adhere to the grammatical standards of the culture's language. For example, an English-speaking child would say "Give cupcake" to express that they would like a cupcake rather than "Cupcake give", as a Turkish- or Japanese-speaking child would. Researchers have noted that this period of [[language acquisition]] occurs some time between the ages of 18–36 months and is present not just in English-speaking cultures, but can be found worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, L. (1970). ''Language development: Form and function in emerging grammars.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In adults, regression to telegraphic speech may indicate a neurological problem such as [[multiple sclerosis]]. Telegraphic speech is also common in non-fluent aphasia ([[Broca's aphasia]]), which is caused by a stroke damaging the posterior-inferior frontal lobe. It is also a potential symptom of schizophrenia, as a manifestation of manneristic speech.

'''Transcode''', or ''Transmission Code'', is a no longer used 6-bit plus parity [[BCD (6-bit)|BCD]] [[character encoding|character set]] which was used by [[IBM]] for a short time for [[Binary Synchronous Communications|Binary Synchronous communications]].  The [[IBM 2780]] data transmission terminal was announced with Transcode support in 1967.  The [[IBM 2780#3780|IBM 3780]] data communication terminal, the 2780 successor announced in 1972, dropped Transcode support.

Transcode was a 64 character set including twenty-six upper case alphabetic characters, ten numerics, thirteen special characters, and sixteen [[control characters]].  Characters were transmitted with [[odd parity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=IBM Corporation |title=Component Description: IBM 2780 Communications Terminal |year=1971 |url=http://computer-refuge.org/bitsavers/pdf/ibm/27xx/GA27-3005-3-2780_Data_Terminal_Description_Aug71.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929024649/http://computer-refuge.org/bitsavers/pdf/ibm/27xx/GA27-3005-3-2780_Data_Terminal_Description_Aug71.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Turoyo''' (also called '''Surayt''') is a [[Central Neo-Aramaic]] language traditionally spoken in Southeastern [[Turkey]] and Northeastern [[Syria]] by [[Assyrian people|Syriac Christians]]. Most speakers use the Classical [[Syriac language]] for literature and worship.

Turoyo speakers are currently mostly members of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], but there are also Turoyo-speaking members of the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], especially from the town of [[Midyat]], and of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]. It is also currently spoken in the [[Assyrian–Chaldean–Syriac diaspora|Syriac Diaspora]], although classified as a vulnerable language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/3502|title=Did you know Turoyo is vulnerable?|website=Endangered Languages|language=en|access-date=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saouk, J (2015). "Quo Vadis Turoyo? A Description of the Needs of the Neo-Aramaic of Tur-Abdin (Turkey)". ''Parole de L'Orient''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Turoyo is not [[mutually intelligible]] with [[Western Neo-Aramaic]] having been separated for over a thousand years, while mutual intelligibility with [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] and [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]] is limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Language Diversity Endangered | publisher=Walter de Gruyter | author=Brenzinger, Matthias | year=2007 | pages=268 | isbn=9783110170498 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qtcmm6N6LPYC&amp;pg=PA268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to what these language names suggest, they are not specific to a particular church, with members of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] speaking Turoyo, and members of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] speaking [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic|Assyrian]] or [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]] dialects.

==Etymology==
From the word ''{{lang|arc-Latn|ṭuro}}'', meaning 'mountain', {{lang|arc-Latn|Ṭuroyo}} is the mountain tongue of the [[Tur Abdin]] in southeastern [[Turkey]]. Another name for the language is ''{{lang|arc-Latn|Surayt}}'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uobw_kBXx74C&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA36,M1 |title=Aramaic (Assyrian/Syriac) Dictionary and Phrasebook - Nicholas Awde, Nineb Lamassu, Nicholas Al-Jeloo - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2007-06-30 |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is used by a number of speakers of the language, as well as the recent EU funded programme to revitalize the language in preference to ''{{lang|arc-Latn|Ṭuroyo}}'', since Surayt is a historical name for the language used by Assyrians while Turoyo is an academic name for the language used to distinguish it from other Neo-Aramaic languages and Classical Syriac. However, especially in the [[diaspora]], the language is frequently called ''Surayt/Suryoyo/Suroyo'' (or ''Sureyt'', ''Sŭryoyo'' or ''Süryoyo'' depending on dialect), meaning "Syriac". Turoyo is sometimes also referred to as ''Western Syriac'' or ''Western Assyrian''.

==History==
Turoyo has evolved from the Eastern Aramaic colloquial varieties that have been spoken in [[Tur Abdin]] and the surrounding plain for more than a thousand years since the initial introduction of Aramaic to the region. However, it has also been influenced by [[Syriac language|Classical Syriac]], which itself was the variety of the Eastern Middle Aramaic spoken farther west, in the city of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]]. Due to the proximity of Tur Abdin to Edessa, and the closeness of their parent languages, meant that Turoyo bears a greater similarity to Classical Syriac than do Northeastern Neo-Aramaic varieties.

The homeland of Turoyo is the [[Tur Abdin]] region in southeastern Turkey.{{sfn|Weninger|2012|p=697}} This region is a traditional stronghold of Syriac Orthodox Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Aphram I. Barsoum|author2=Ighnāṭyūs Afrām I (Patriarch of Antioch)|title=The History of Tur Abdin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1TMsAQAAMAAJ|year=2008|publisher=Gorgias Press|isbn=978-1-59333-715-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Turoyo-speaking population prior to the Assyrian genocide largely adhered to the Syriac Orthodox Church.{{sfn|Weninger|2012|p=697}} In 1970 it was estimated that there were 20,000 Turoyo-speakers still living in the area, however, they gradually migrated to [[Western Europe]] and elsewhere in the world.{{sfn|Weninger|2012|p=697}} The Turoyo-speaking diaspora is now estimated at 40,000.{{sfn|Weninger|2012|p=697}} In the diaspora communities, Turoyo is usually a second language which is supplemented by more mainstream languages.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, C; Kiraz, G (2016). "Turoyo Neo-Aramaic in northern New Jersey". ''International Journal of the Sociology of Language''.&lt;/ref&gt; The language is considered endangered by UNESCO, but efforts are still made by Turoyo-speaking communities to sustain the language through use in homelife, school programs to teach Turoyo on the weekends, and summer day camps.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sorosoro.org/en/turoyo/ "Turoyo «  Sorosoro"]. ''www.sorosoro.org''. Retrieved 2017-04-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Today only hundreds of speakers remain in Tur Abdin.{{sfn|Weninger|2012|p=697}}

Until recently, Turoyo was a spoken vernacular and was never written down: Kthobhonoyo was the written language. In the 1880s, various attempts were made, with the encouragement of western missionaries, to write Turoyo in the [[Syriac alphabet]], in the ''Serto'' and in "Estrangelo" script used for West-Syriac Kthobhonoyo.

However, with upheaval in their homeland through the twentieth century, many Turoyo speakers have emigrated around the world (particularly to [[Syria]], the [[Lebanon]], [[Sweden]] and [[Germany]]). The Swedish government's education policy, that every child be educated in his or her first tongue, led to the commissioning of teaching materials in Turoyo. Yusuf Ishaq thus developed an alphabet for Turoyo/Surayt based on the [[Latin script]]. Silas Üzel also created a separate Latin alphabet for Turoyo in Germany.

A series of reading books and workbooks that introduce Ishaq's alphabet are called ''Toxu Qorena!'', or "Come Let's Read!" This project has also produced a [[Swedish language|Swedish]]-Turoyo dictionary of 4500 entries: the ''Svensk-turabdinskt Lexikon: Leksiqon Swedoyo-Suryoyo''. Another old teacher, writer and translator of Turoyo is [[Yuhanun Üzel]] (born in Midun in 1934) who in 2009 finished the translation of the [[Peshitta]] Bible in Turoyo, with [[Benjamin Bar Shabo]] and Yahkup Bilgic, in [[Serto]] (West-Syriac) and Latin script, a foundation for the "Aramean-Syriac language".

==Dialects==
Turoyo has borrowed some words from [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. The main dialect of Turoyo is that of [[Midyat]] (Mëḏyoyo), in the east of Turkey's [[Mardin Province]]. Every village have distinctive dialects (Midwoyo, Kfarzoyo, `Iwarnoyo, Nihloyo and Izloyo, respectively).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} All Turoyo dialects are mutually intelligible with each other. There is a dialectal split between the town of Midyat and the villages, with only slight differences between the individual villages.{{sfn|Weninger|2012|p=697}} A closely related language or dialect, [[Mlahsô language|Mlaḥsô]], spoken in two villages in Diyarbakir, is now deemed extinct.{{sfn|Weninger|2012|p=697}}

Many Turoyo-speakers who have left their villages now speak a mixed dialect of their village dialect with the Midyat dialect. This mixture of dialects was used by Ishaq as the basis of his system of written Turoyo. For example, Ishaq's reading book uses the word ''qorena'' in its title instead of the Mëḏyoyo ''qurena'' or the village-dialect ''qorina''. All speakers are bilingual in another local language. Church schools in Syria and the Lebanon teach Kthobonoyo rather than Turoyo, and encourage the replacement of non-Syriac loanwords with authentic Syriac ones. Some church leaders have tried to discourage the use and writing of Turoyo, seeing it as an impure form of Syriac.

==Alphabet==
Surayt is written both in Latin and Syriac (Serto) characters. The orthography provided below for Turoyo/Surayt was the outcome of the International Surayt Conference held at the University of Cambridge (27-30 August 2015).&lt;ref&gt;https://aramaic.geschkult.fu-berlin.de/course/en/a1-intro#1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://userblogs.fu-berlin.de/wp-includes/ms-files.php?path=/aramaic-ol/&amp;file=2017/08/Surayt-Orthography.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to write down Turoyo have begun since the 16th century, with Jewish Neo-Aramaic adaptions and translations of Biblical texts, commentaries, as well as hagiographic stories, books, and folktales in Christian dialects.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Tomal, Maciej (2015). Khan, Geoffrey; Napiorkowska, Lidia, eds. ''Towards a Description of Written Surayt/Turoyo: Some Syntactic Functions of the Particle Kal''. Gorgias Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nestorian Bishop Mar Yohannan working with American missionary Rev. Justin Perkins also tried to write the vernacular version of religious texts, culminating in the production of school-cards in 1836.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1970s Germany, members of the Syriac evangelical movement (Aramäische freie Christengemeinde in German) used Turoyo to write short texts and songs.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Talay, Shabo (2015). "Turoyo, the Aramaic Language of Turabdin and the Translation of Alice". In Lindseth, Jon A. ''Alice In a World of Wonderland The Translations of Lewis Carroll's Masterpiece''. Oak Knoll Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The Syriac evangelical movement has also published over 300 Turoyo hymns in a compedium named ''Kole Ruhonoye'' in 2012, as well as translating the four gospels with Mark and John being published so far.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The alphabet as used in a forthcoming translation of ''New Peshitta in Turoyo'' by [[Yuhanun Bar Shabo]], ''Sfar mele surtoṯoyo - Picture dictionary'' and [[Benjamin Bar Shabo]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''.

In the 1970s, educator Yusuf Ishaq attempted to systematically incorporate the Turoyo language into a Latin orthography, which resulted in a series of reading books, entitled [toxu qorena].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weaver|first=C.M.|last2=Kiraz|first2=G.A.|year=2016|title=Turoyo Neo-Aramaic in northern New Jersey|url=|journal=International Journal of the Sociology of Language|volume=|pages=|via=|doi=10.1515/ijsl-2015-0033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this system is not used outside of Sweden, other Turoyo speakers have developed their own non-standardized Latin script to use the language on digital platforms.

The Swedish government's "mother-tongue education" project treated Turoyo as an immigrant language, like Arabic, Turkish, Kurdish, and began to teach the language in schools.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The staff of the National Swedish Institute for Teaching Material produced a Latin letter-based alphabet, grammar, dictionary, school books, and instructional material. Due to religious and political objections, the project was halted.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

There are other efforts to translate famous works of literature, including The Aramaic Students Association's translation of ''The Little Prince'', the Nisbin Foundation's translation of ''Cinderella'' and ''Little Red Riding Hood.''&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Phonology==
Phonetically, Turoyo is very similar to Classical Syriac. The additional [[phoneme]]s {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}} (as in '''''j'''u'''dg'''e''), {{IPA|/t͡ʃ/}} (as in '''''ch'''ur'''ch''''') {{IPA|/ʒ/}} (as in ''a'''z'''ure'') and a few instances of {{IPA|/ðˤ/}} (the Arabic [[ẓāʾ]]) mostly only appear in loanwords from other languages.

The most distinctive feature of Turoyo phonology is its use of [[reduced vowel]]s in [[syllable|closed syllable]]s. The phonetic value of such reduced vowels differs depending both on the value of original vowel and the dialect spoken. The Miḏyoyo dialect also reduces vowels in pre-stress open syllables. That has the effect of producing a syllabic [[schwa]] in most dialects (in Classical Syriac, the schwa is not syllabic).

=== Vowels ===
Turoyo has the following set of vowels:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omniglot.com/writing/turoyo.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Close front unrounded vowel]] – /{{IPAlink|i}}/
* [[Close-mid front unrounded vowel]] – /{{IPAlink|e}}/
* [[Open front unrounded vowel]] – /{{IPAlink|a}}/
* [[Open back rounded vowel]] – /{{IPAlink|ɒ}}/
* [[Close back rounded vowel]] – /{{IPAlink|u}}/
* [[Mid central unrounded vowel]] – /{{IPAlink|ə}}/

==Morphology==
The verbal system of Turoyo is similar to that used in other [[Neo-Aramaic languages]]. In Classical Syriac, the ancient [[perfect tense|perfect]] and [[imperfect tense]]s had started to become [[preterite]] and [[future tense]]s respectively, and other tenses were formed by using the [[participle]]s with [[pronoun|pronominal]] [[clitic]]s or shortened forms of the verb ''hwā'' ('to become'). Most modern Aramaic languages have completely abandoned the old tenses and form all tenses from stems based around the old participles. The classical clitics have become incorporated fully into the verb form, and can be considered more like inflections.

Turoyo has also developed the use of the [[demonstrative pronoun]]s much more than any other Aramaic language. In Turoyo/Surayt, they have become [[definite article]]s:
*masculine singular: u malko (''the king'')
*feminine singular: i malëkṯo (''the queen'')
*plural common: am malke (''the kings''), am malkoṯe (''the queens'').

The Modern Western Syriac dialect of [[Mlahsô language|Mlahsô]] and Ansha villages in [[Diyarbakır Province]] is quite different from Turoyo.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} It is virtually extinct; its last few speakers live in [[Qamishli]] in northeastern [[Syria]] and in the diaspora. Turoyo/Surayt is also more closely related to other Eastern Neo-Aramaic dialects than the Western Neo-Aramaic dialect of [[Western Neo-Aramaic|Maaloula]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/614310 Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 31, No. 3 (1968), pp. 605-610]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Syntax ==
Turoyo has three sets of particles that take the place of the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] in [[nominal clause]]s: enclitic copula, independent copula, and emphatic independent copula. In Turoyo, the non-enclitic copula (or the existential particle) is articulated with the use of two sets of particles: ''kal'' and ''kit''.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

'''Uses and gratifications theory''' (UGT) is  an approach to understanding why and how people actively seek out specific media to satisfy specific needs. UGT is an audience-centered approach to understanding [[mass communication]].&lt;ref name="SeverinTankard"&gt;{{cite book|last=Severin|first=Werner|last2=Tankard|first2=James|year=1997|isbn=0801317037|title=Communication theories: Origins, methods, and uses in the mass media|publisher=[[Longman]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diverging from other media effect theories that question "what does media do to people?", UGT focuses on "what do people do with media?"&lt;ref name=Katz_1959&gt;{{cite journal|last=Katz|first=Elihu|authorlink=Elihu Katz|title=Mass Communications Research and the Study of Popular Culture: An Editorial Note on a Possible Future for this Journal|journal=Departmental Papers (ASC)|year=1959|pages=1–6|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1168&amp;context=asc_papers&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.com%2Fscholar_url%3Fhl%3Den%26q%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Frepository.upenn.edu%2Fcgi%2Fviewcontent.cgi%253Farticle%253D1168%2526context%253Dasc_papers%26sa%3DX%26scisig%3DAAGBfm3sEC9JZkct13HTnv8rJNash_GE2Q%26oi%3Dscholarr#search=%22http%3A%2F%2Frepository.upenn.edu%2Fcgi%2Fviewcontent.cgi%3Farticle%3D1168%26context%3Dasc_papers%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It postulates that media is a highly available product and the audiences are the consumers of the same product

This [[communication theory]] is [[positivistic]] in its approach, based in the [[Social psychology|socio-psychological]] communication tradition, and focuses on communication at the [[mass media]] scale.&lt;ref name="West 2007 392–409"&gt;{{cite book|last=West|first=Richard|last2=Turner|first2=Lynn H.|year=2007|title=Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application|pages=392–409|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Education|McGraw-Hill Higher Education]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The driving question of UGT is: ''Why'' do people use media and what do they use them for? UGT discusses how users deliberately choose media that will satisfy given needs and allow one to enhance knowledge, relaxation, social interactions/companionship, diversion, or escape.&lt;ref name=Severin_Tankard&gt;{{cite book|last=Severin|first=Werner J.|title=Communication Theories: Origins, Methods and Uses in the Mass Media|year=2000|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman|isbn=0801333350|last2=Tankard Jr.|first2=James W.|chapter=2: New Media Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McQuail_2010&gt;{{cite book|last=McQuail|first=Denis|authorlink=Denis McQuail|title=Mass communication theory: an introduction|year=2010|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|location=[[London]]|isbn=1849202923|pages=420–430}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"What Can Uses and Gratifications Theory Tell Us About Social Media?" Education|Ithink. 29 July 2010. Web. 17 October 2011. &lt;http://matei.org/ithink/2010/07/29/what-can-uses-and-gratifications-theory-tell-us-about-social-media&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

It assumes that audience members are not passive consumers of media. Rather, the audience has power over their [[media consumption]] and assumes an active role in interpreting and integrating media into their own lives. Unlike other theoretical perspectives, UGT holds that audiences are responsible for choosing media to meet their desires and needs to achieve gratification. This theory would then imply that the media compete against other information sources for viewers' gratification.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;[[Elihu Katz|Katz, Elihu]], [[Jay Blumler|Jay G. Blumler]], and Michael Gurevitch. "Uses and Gratifications Research." ''[[Public Opinion Quarterly]]'' 4th ser. 37 (1973–1974): 509-23. JSTOR. Web. 14 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://jstor.org/stable/2747854&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

UGT has a [[heuristic]] value today because it gives communication scholars a "perspective through which a number of ideas and theories about media choice, consumption, and even impact can be viewed".&lt;ref name=Baran_Davis&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baran|first1=Stanley J.|last2=Davis|first2=Dennis K.|title=Mass communication theory : foundations, ferment, and future|year=2009|publisher=[[Cengage|Wadsworth]]|location=[[Boston]], MA|isbn=0495898872|pages=416|edition=6th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jpokJDPWt_MC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Mass+communication+theory+:+foundations,+ferment,+and+future&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zFJhUqXwLoS69gTnhIGICg&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Mass%20communication%20theory%20%3A%20foundations%2C%20ferment%2C%20and%20future&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses and gratifications approach==
Mark Levy and [[Sven Windahl]] provide a good description of what it means to be an "active consumer" of media:

:"As commonly understood by gratifications researchers, the term "audience activity" postulates a voluntaristic and selective orientation by audiences toward the communication process. In brief, it suggests that media use is motivated by needs and goals that are defined by audience members themselves, and that active participation in the communication process may facilitate, limit, or otherwise influence the gratifications and effects associated with exposure. Current thinking also suggests that audience activity is best conceptualized as a variable construct, with audiences exhibiting varying ''kinds'' and ''degrees'' of activity."&lt;ref name=Levy_Windahl&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levy|first=Mark|author2=Sven Windahl|title=The concept of audience activity|journal=Media gratifications research: Current perspectives|year=1985|pages=109–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assumptions of the theory===
Unlike other theories concerning media consumption, UGT gives the consumer power to discern what media they consume, with the assumption that the consumer has a clear intent and use. This contradicts previous theories such as '''mass society theory''', that states that people are helpless victims of mass media produced by large companies; and '''individual differences perspective''', which states that intelligence and self-esteem largely drive an individual's media choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gusfield|first1=Joseph R.|title=The reflexivity of social movements: Collective behavior and mass society theory revisited.|date=1994|publisher=[[Temple University Press]]|location=[[Philadelphia]]|isbn=978-1566391870|page=60|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given these differing theories, UGT is unique in its assumptions:&lt;ref name="West 2007 392–409"/&gt;
*The audience is active and its media use is goal oriented
*The initiative in linking need gratification to a specific medium choice rests with the audience member
*The media compete with other resources for need satisfaction
*People have enough self-awareness of their media use, interests, and motives to be able to provide researchers with an accurate picture of that use.
*Value judgments of media content can only be assessed by the audience.

===Heuristic approach of UGT===
Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch synthesized that UGT's approach was focused on "the social and psychological origins of needs, which generate expectations of the mass media or other sources, which lead to differential patterns of media exposure (or engagement in other activities), resulting in need gratifications and some other consequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones."&lt;ref name=Severin_Tankard /&gt;&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

According to Katz, Blumler and Gurevitch's research there were five components comprising the Uses and Gratifications Approach. The components are:&lt;ref&gt;[[Elihu Katz|Katz, Elihu]], [[Jay Blumler|Jay G. Blumler]], and Michael Gurevitch. "Uses and Gratifications Research."The Public Opinion Quarterly 4th ser. 37 38(1973–1974): 509-23. JSTOR. Web. 14 Oct. 2011.&lt;http://jstor.org/stable/2747854&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The audience is conceived as active.
#In the mass communication process, much initiative in linking gratification and media choice lies with the audience member. 
#The media compete with other sources of satisfaction.
#Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived from data supplied by individual audience members themselves. 
#Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms.

According to the research, goals for media use can be grouped into five uses.&lt;ref name=McQuail_2010 /&gt; The audience wants to:
#be informed or educated
#identify with characters of the situation in the media environment
#simple entertainment
#enhance social interaction
#escape from the stresses of daily life

===Gratifications sought (GS) vs. gratifications obtained (GO)===
GS and GO is one of the research issues dealing with U&amp;G theory, and it is a contrast between "what you were seeking from experience" versus "what you actually got from the experience - whether it was a satisfying experience or not."

==History==
Beginning in the 1940s, researchers began seeing patterns under the perspective of the uses and gratifications theory in radio listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lazarsfeld|first1=Paul F.|authorlink=Paul Lazarsfeld|title=Radio and the printed page; an introduction to the study of radio and its role in the communication of ideas.|date=1940|publisher=[[Duell, Sloan, and Pearce]]|location=New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early research was concerned with topics such as children's use of comics and the absence of newspapers during a newspaper strike. An interest in more psychological interpretations emerged during this time period. 

In 1948, Lasswell introduced a four-functional interpretation of the media on a macro-sociological level. Media served the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment and cultural transmission for both society and individuals&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

===Stages of the theory===
Uses and gratifications theory was developed from a number of prior communication theories and research conducted by fellow theorists.

====Stage 1====
*In 1944, researchers began to look into the earliest forms of uses and gratifications with their work classifying the reasons for why people chose specific types of media. Whilst researchers were studying, Herzog interviewed various soap opera fans and was able to identify three types of gratifications. The three gratifications categories, based on why people listened to soap operas, were emotional, wishful thinking, and learning.&lt;ref name="WestTurner392409"/&gt;
*According to West and Turner, UGT was an extension of [[Needs and Motivation Theory]], as outlined by [[Abraham Maslow]] in 1954, which argues that people actively looked to satisfy their needs based on a hierarchy. These needs are organized as [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]] in the form of a pyramid with the largest, most fundamental needs at the base and the need for self-actualization at the top. From the bottom-up the pyramid contains Biological/Physical, Security/Safety, Social/Belonging, Ego/Self-Respect and Self-actualization at the top.&lt;ref name="WestTurner392409"/&gt;
*In 1954 [[Wilbur Schramm]] developed the fraction of selection, a formula for determining which form of mass media an individual would select. The formula helped to decide the amount of gratification an individual would expect to gain from the medium over how much effort they had to make to achieve gratification.&lt;ref name="WestTurner392409"&gt;West, Richard L., and Lynn H. Turner. "Uses and Gratifications Theory." Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application. Boston: McGraw-Hill, 2010. 392-409. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stage 2====
*In 1969 [[Jay Blumler]] and [[Denis McQuail]] studied the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|1964 election]] in the United Kingdom by examining people's motives for watching certain political programs on television. By categorizing the audience's motives for viewing a certain program, they aimed to classify viewers according to their needs in order to understand any potential mass-media effects.&lt;ref name=Severin_Tankard /&gt; The audience motivations they were able to identify helped lay the groundwork for their research in 1972 and eventually uses and gratifications theory.&lt;ref name="WestTurner392409"/&gt;
*In 1972 Denis McQuail, Jay Blumler and Joseph Brown suggested that the uses of different types of media could be grouped into 4 categories. The four categories were: diversion, personal relationships, personal identity and surveillance.&lt;ref name="WestTurner392409"/&gt;
*In 1973-74 McQuail, Blumler and Brown were joined by [[Elihu Katz]], [[Michael Gurevitch]] and [[Hadassah Haas]], in their media exploration. The collaborative research began to indicate how people saw the mass media.&lt;ref name="WestTurner392409"/&gt;

====Stage 3====
*The most recent interest surrounding Uses and Gratifications Theory is the link between the reason why media is used and the achieved gratification.&lt;ref name="WestTurner392409"/&gt;
*UGT researchers are developing the theory to be more predictive and explanatory by connecting the needs, goals, benefits, and consequences of media consumption and use along with individual factors.&lt;ref name="WestTurner392409"/&gt;
*Work in UGT was trailblazing because the research of Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch built on Herzog's research and caused a paradigm shift from how media influences people to how audiences use media, diminishing the dominance of the limited effects approach to mass media studies.&lt;ref name="WestTurner392409"/&gt;
*In the 1980s, Rehman (1983) applied UGT to study the relationship between the movie audience expectations and satisfaction derived from going to the movies.

==Modern applications of uses and gratifications research==
===Mobile phone usage===
[[Mobile phones]], a comparatively new technology, have many uses and gratifications attached to them. Due to their nature of mobility, constant access, and options to both add and access content, this field is expanding with new research on the motivations behind using mobile phones.

In general, people use mobile phones for the following uses and gratifications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leung|first=L.|author2=Wei, R.|title=More than just talk on the move: A use-and-gratification study of the cellular phone|journal=Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|year=2000|volume=77|issue=2|pages=308–320|doi=10.1177/107769900007700206}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Affection/sociability
*Entertainment
*Instrumentality
*Psychological reassurance
*Fashion/status
*Mobility
*Immediate access

Uses and gratifications do, however, differ based on location and audience:
*Using mobile phones on buses, cars, and trains is related to the UG of mobility and immediate access
*Talking to business partners is related to the UG of instrumentality
*Talking to family members is related to the UG of mobility and affection

The specific function of text messaging has been studied&lt;ref name="Grellhesl 2012 2175–2181"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grellhesl|first=Melanie|author2=Narissra M. Punyanunt-Carter|title=Using the Uses and Gratifications Theory to Understand Gratifications Sought through Text Messaging Practices of Male and Female Undergraduate Students|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|year=2012|volume=28|issue=6|pages=2175–2181|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2012.06.024}}&lt;/ref&gt; to find its uses and gratifications and explore any potential gender differences. The researchers proposed seven uses and gratifications; they are listed below, from highest to lowest ranked according to the study's results:
*Accessibility/mobility
*Relaxation
*Escape
*Entertainment
*Information seeking
*Coordination for business
*Socialization/affection seeking
*Status seeking

The results also displayed gender differences (in an undergraduate population): women scored the UG of accessibility/mobility, relaxation and escape, and coordination higher than the men did. These results may imply social and societal expectations for females around independence but connected to family and friends and/or a tendency for women to rely more on detailed conversation in text messaging than men.&lt;ref name="Grellhesl 2012 2175–2181"/&gt;

Since many now use their mobile phones as devices to connect to the internet and both contribute and retrieve content, researchers have investigated the UG of smart devices which engage multiple media. The uses and gratifications for contributing mobile content differ from those for retrieving mobile content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chua|first=Alton Y.K.|author2=Dion Hoe-Lian Goh|author3=Chei Sian Lee|title=Mobile Content Contribution and Retrieval: An Exploratory Study Using the Uses and Gratifications Paradigm|journal=Information Processing &amp; Management|year=2012|volume=48|issue=1|pages=13–22|doi=10.1016/j.ipm.2011.04.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Contribution''': Leisure, entertainment, easy access, and passing time are all motivations for adding material.
*'''Retrieval''': Efficient access of information resources/services and the need for high quality information are uses and gratifications for accessing content.

===Internet usage===
The [[Internet]] provides a new and deep field for exploring UGT. It was found to have three main categories of gratifications: content gratification, process gratification, and social gratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stafford|first=Thomas F.|author2=Marla Royne Stafford|author3=Lawrence L. Schkade|title=Determining Uses and Gratifications for the Internet|journal=Decision Sciences|date=Spring 2004|volume=35|issue=2|pages=259–288|doi=10.1111/j.00117315.2004.02524.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Content''': Uses for the Internet include the need for researching or finding specific information or material, which are gratified with content.
*'''Process''': Users gain gratification from the experience of purposeful navigating or random browsing of the Internet in its functional process.
*'''Social''': Uses encompass a wide range of forming and deepening social ties.

Scholars like LaRose et al. utilize UGT to understand Internet usage via a socio-cognitive framework to reduce uncertainties that arise from homogenizing an Internet audience and explaining media usage in terms of only positive outcomes (gratifications). LaRose et al. created measures for self-efficacy and self-disparagement and related UGT to negative outcomes of online behavior (like Internet addiction) as well.&lt;ref name=LaRose_2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=LaRose|first=Robert|author2=Dana Mastro|author3=Matthew S. Eastin|title=Understanding Internet Usage: A Social-Cognitive Approach to Uses and Gratifications|journal=Social Science Computer Review|year=2001|volume=19|issue=395|url=http://www.ensani.ir/storage/Files/20110209150302-%D9%81%D9%87%D9%85%20%DA%A9%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C%20%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%86%D8%AA.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social media usage===
Recent research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leung|first=Louis|title=Generational Differences in Content Generation in Social Media: The Roles of the Gratifications Sought and of Narcissism|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|year=2013|volume=29|issue=3|pages=997–1006|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2012.12.028}}&lt;/ref&gt; has looked at [[social networking services]], personal and subject-based [[blogs]], and [[internet forums]] put together to study the U&amp;G in posting social content, the relationship between gratifications and narcissism, and the effects of age on this relationship and these gratifications. Users have motivations of the following overall:
*'''Social and affection'''
*'''Need to vent negative feelings'''
*'''Recognition'''
*'''Entertainment'''
*'''Cognitive needs'''

Forums were found to be the main media for venting negative feelings, potentially due to the fact that comparatively, forums are more of a one-way street. Use of social media cures loneliness and satisfies a compulsion for addictive behaviors. Similar to the variables of gender, location, and audience as previous research has found, the U&amp;G differed by category of narcissism. The researchers found four multi-dimensional narcissistic personality types: feeling authoritative or superior, exhibitionistic, exploitative, and often hungry for vanity. The U&amp;G differed depending on the specific type of narcissism a given user had. For instance, those who were exhibitionistic tended to focus on the social media U&amp;G of showing affection, expressing negative feelings, and being recognized. Those who viewed themselves as superior had higher uses and gratifications by cognitive motivations than by recognition. The vain narcissists were most gratified by recognition and attention, and they did not vent negative feelings. Exhibitionists were motivated by all gratifications of social media. No generational differences were found in the narcissistic tendencies.

====Friend-networking sites====
Basic research finds that socialization motivates use of friend-networking sites such as MySpace and Facebook. Particulars under socialization might be finding old friends, making new friends, learning about events, creating social functions, and feeling connected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raacke|first=John|author2=Jennifer Bonds-Raacke|title=MySpace and Facebook: Applying the Uses and Gratifications Theory to Exploring Friend-Networking Sites|journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior|year=2008|volume=11|issue=2|pages=169–174|doi=10.1089/cpb.2007.0056}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some further exploration has demonstrated that although emotional, cognitive, social, and habitual uses are motivational to use social media, not all uses are consistently gratified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Zheng|author2=John M. Tchernev|author3=Tyler Solloway|title=A Dynamic Longitudinal Examination of Social Media Use, Needs, and Gratifications Among College Students|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|year=2012|volume=28|issue=5|pages=1829–1839|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2012.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In research examining [[Facebook]] groups' users' gratifications in relation to their civic participation offline, 1,715 college students were asked "to rate their level of agreement with specific reasons for using [[Facebook]] groups, including information acquisition about campus/community, entertainment/recreation, social interaction with friends and family, and peer pressure/self satisfaction."&lt;ref&gt;Park, Namsu, Kerk F. Kee, and Sebastian Valenzuela. "Being Immersed in Social Networking Environment: Facebook Groups, Uses and Gratifications, and Social Outcomes. "CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior 12.6 (2009) 729-33. Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The study ultimately yielded results through principal components factor analysis with varimax rotation. The results showed that there were four needs for using Facebook groups, "socializing, entertainment, self-status seeking, and information."
*'''Socializing''': Students were interested in talking and meeting with others to achieve a sense of community and peer support on the particular topic of the group.
*'''Entertainment''': Students engaged with the groups to amuse themselves.
*'''Self-Seeking''': Students sought out or maintained their personal status, as well as those of their friends, through the online group participation.
*'''Information''': Students used the group to receive information about related events going on and off campus.

====Twitter====
[[Twitter]] is an online micro-blogging platform that contains both mass-media functions and interpersonal communication options via sending tweets. Research has found a positive correlation between active time spent on Twitter and the gratification of a need for "an informal sense of camaraderie"—connection—with other users. Furthermore, the frequency of tweets and number of replies and public messages mediated the relationship between Twitter users. This helped increase both use and gratification of the media by satisfying the need for connection.&lt;ref name=Chen_2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Gina Masullo|title=Tweet this: A uses and gratifications perspective on how active Twitter use gratifies a need to connect with others|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=March 2011|volume=27|issue=2|pages=755–762|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2010.10.023|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2010.10.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Snapchat====
Snapchat is a photo-sharing social media platform with more than 178 million users worldwide. Similar to other forms of social media, people use Snapchat to fulfill specific media needs. Compared to social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, Snapchat is used more to fulfill private media needs. For example, Phua, Jin, and Kim found that Snapchat interactions were similar to interactions found in close interpersonal relationships. The application has been used to attain emotional support from others, look for advice on important decisions, and seek help to solve problems, satisfying the need to socialize, vent negative feelings, and connect with others.&lt;ref name=Phua_2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phua|first1=Joe|last2=Jin|first2=Seunga Venus|last3=Kim|first3=Jihoon|title=Uses and Gratifications of social networking cites for bridging and bonding social capital: A comparison of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=72|issue=July 2017|pages=115–122|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2017.02.041|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other applications====
Many other aspects of UGT are featured in using various websites that are related to social networking. Many review services, such as [[Yelp.com]], have an aspect of social networking, with user profiles and interconnectivity. Many news websites feature the ability to share articles and pictures directly from their page to users' personal social networking pages across platforms. Understandably, information seeking is an overwhelming U&amp;G for these applications, especially the review sites like Yelp.com. Other U&amp;G included entertainment, convenience, interpersonal utility, and passing time. A more sinister aspect of UGT and a reason to use social media establishes a platform for cyberbullying.

People engage in cyberbullying online and through social media in order to gratify themselves. Cyberbullying fulfills a need to be vengeful and malicious, while avoiding face-to-face contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hicks|first=Amy|author2=Stephen Comp|author3=Jeannie Horovitz|author4=Madeline Hovarter|author5=Maya Miki|author6=Jennifer L. Bevan|title=Why People Use Yelp.com: An Exploration of Uses and Gratifications|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|year=2012|volume=28|issue=6|pages=2274–2279|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2012.06.034}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, besides information seeking, users who share news are motivated by U&amp;G of socializing and status seeking, especially if they have had prior experience with social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Chei Sian|author2=Long Ma|title=News Sharing in Social Media: The Effect of Gratifications and Prior Experience|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|year=2012|volume=28|issue=2|pages=331–339|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2011.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instant messaging===
As with text messaging, similar U&amp;G were studied&lt;ref name="Leung 2001 482–500"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leung|first=L.|title=College student motives for chatting on ICQ|journal=New Media &amp; Society|year=2001|volume=3|issue=4|pages=482–500|doi=10.1177/14614440122226209}}&lt;/ref&gt; with instant messaging, or participating in an "[[online chat]]," and these results were also mitigated by gender:

Again, differences were found based on amount of use and gender. Those who used the instant messaging service frequently ("heavy users") were found to be most motivated by affection and sociability; those who did not ("light users") were most motivated by fashion. Women chatted longer and for sociability; men chatted for less time per session and for entertainment and relaxation.&lt;ref name="Leung 2001 482–500"/&gt;

===Online gaming===
This new branch of research explores the U&amp;G of starting to play games online. Achievement, enjoyment and social interaction are all motivations for starting to play an online game, and their success at the game as well as the extent to which their uses were gratified predicted their continuance in playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wu|first=Jen-Her|author2=Shu-Ching Wang|author3=Ho-Huang Tsai|title=Falling in Love with Online Games: The Uses and Gratifications Perspective|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|year=2010|volume=26|issue=6|pages=1862–1871|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2010.07.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mobile Gaming and Augmented Reality===
In 2017, researchers applied Uses and Gratification Theory to study user behavior among [[Pokémon Go]] users. Results show that enjoyment, physical activity, nostalgia, image, normative influences and flow drive various forms of user behavior. In addition, perceived physical risks (but not perceived privacy risks) lead to weaker forms of usage. Findings of this study show that Uses and Gratification theory provides a promising framework to study Augmented Reality, and that U&amp;GT provides a robust framework that can be supplemented with other theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rauschnabel|first=Philipp A.|last2=Rossmann|first2=Alexander|last3=Dieck|first3=M.

===Animated news===
In 2011, a test was conducted with 312 college students to investigate their viewing of animated news. The use of melodramatic animation in news was seen as an emerging technique used in news reporting at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://enx.sagepub.com/content/6/3/131.short|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130105001915/http://enx.sagepub.com/content/6/3/131.short|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-05|title=Can News Be Imaginative?

Factor analysis and hierarchical regression were employed for data analysis.

In the study, seven motives were identified, through factor analysis, for viewing such animated news videos. These motives included companionship, social interaction, relaxation, information seeking, interpersonal learning, entertainment and pass time.
*'''Social interaction motive''': getting information for facilitating discussion with others
*'''Relaxation motive''': watching animated news to release pressure and unwind
*'''Information-seeking motive''': viewing animated news to stay abreast of current events or to search for information
*'''Entertainment motive''': viewing animated news for amusement and enjoyment
*'''Pass time motive''': viewing animated news to occupy time or when individuals have nothing better to do
*'''Interpersonal learning motive''': the desire to understand the minds of friends or significant others by watching the animated news videos that are shared by these individuals
*'''Companionship motive''': to alleviate loneliness

The results of hierarchical regression analysis suggest predictive relationships among personality characteristics (sensation seeking and locus of control), the seven motives, the effects of perceived news credibility and newsworthiness, and the intention to share such animated news videos with others.

===Entertainment media===
Research has shown that media taken in for entertainment purposes (i.e., movies, songs, television, etc.) have a wide range of uses and emotional gratifications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bartsch|first=Anne|author2=Reinhold Viehoff|title=The Use of Media Entertainment and Emotional Gratification|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|date=March 29, 2010|volume=5|pages=2247–2255|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2010.07.444}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that these are not mutually exclusive but can overlap with each other. Rehman (1983) demonstrated a relationship between gratifications sought and obtained from the movies and movie attendance.
*'''Mood management''': This is the most prominently cited emotional gratification of media use. People prefer to maintain a state of intermediate arousal; this is a pleasant medium. When in a bad mood, bored, or over-aroused, people will seek media as regulation for or distraction from their mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zillman|first=D|title=Mood management through communication choices|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|year=1988|volume=31|pages=327–340|doi=10.1177/000276488031003005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zillman|first=D|title=Mood Management in the context of selective exposure theory.|journal=Communication Yearbook|year=2000|volume=23|pages=103–123|editor1-first=M.

*'''Affective disposition''': Affective disposition theory states that people enjoy "rooting for" characters depicted as good and moral. Users experience gratification when good things happen to characters with "good" morals and also when bad things happen to "evil" or "bad" characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Communication and emotion: Essays in honor of Dolf Zillmann|year=2003|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ|pages=61–84|author=Raney, A.

*'''Modes of reception''': "Emotional involvement correlates with other modes of reception, especially with diegetic involvement (getting absorbed in the fictional world), socio-involvement (identifying with characters), and ego-involvement (relating the film to one's own life). ...Emotional involvement can be helpful for the pursuit of a broader variety of goals in the reception process. ... It can be concluded that the experience of emotions can be functional in a number of other ways than just regulating emotions in terms of affective valence and arousal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bartsch|first=Anne|author2=Reinhold Viehoff|title=The Use of Media Entertainment and Emotional Gratification|journal=Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences|year=2010|volume=5|pages=2247–2255|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2010.07.444}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sückfull|first=M.|title=Rezeptionsmodalitäten.

*'''Intrinsic motivation''': If the user experiences a challenge to his or her media-related skills, but not to the point of being frustrated or overwhelmed, then the gratification is a reward in a feeling of competence that inspires the user to continue using the media in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vorderer|first=P|title=Psychology of Entertainment|year=2006|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ|author2=Steen, F. and Chan, E.|editor=Bryant, J.|editor2=Vorderer, P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Mood adjustment''': Users are gratified by using media to adjust their mood to whatever is currently happening. For instance, once already provoked by an aggressor and promised a chance to retaliate, males were found to prefer bad news over good news in that emotionally charged moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knobloch|first=S.|title=Mood adjustment via mass communication|journal=Journal of Communication|year=2003|volume=53|pages=233–250|doi=10.1093/joc/53.2.233|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/72504/1/j.1460-2466.2003.tb02588.x.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knobloch-Westerwick|first=S.|author2=Alter, S.|title=Mood adjustment to social situations through mass media use: How men ruminate and women dissipate angry moods|journal=Human Communication Research|year=2006|volume=32|pages=58–73|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.2006.00003.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Relationship functions of entertainment''': According to this particular branch of use and gratification, we use entertainment to apply lessons to or escape from our real-life relationships.

==Related theories==
===Media system dependency theory===
[[Media system dependency theory]] (MSDT or media dependency theory) has been studied as an offshoot of UGT. However, media dependency theory focuses on audiences' goals for media consumption as the source of their dependency; while uses and gratification theory focuses on audience's needs as drivers for media consumption. MSDT states that as a person becomes increasingly dependent on media to satisfy their needs, that media will become more important in a person's life and thereby have increased influence and effects that person. MSDT acknowledges and builds upon UGT because it is based on the assumptions that people have different uses for media that arise from their needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ball-Rokeach |first1=S.J. |last2=DeFleur |first2=M.L.|authorlink=Melvin Defleur|title=A dependency model of mass-media effects |journal=Communication Research |date=January 1976 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=3–21 |doi=10.1177/009365027600300101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social cognitive theory===
Building on UGT, [[Social Cognitive Theory]] helped distinguish GS versus GO stimulus for media consumption. Social cognitive theory explains behavior in terms of the reciprocal causation between individuals, environments, and behaviors. This allows for a more personal application of UGT instead of a large, blanketing assumption about a large audience of mass media. If GO is greater than GS then there will be more audience satisfaction. Lastly, audiences' GS are not always the reality of their GO.&lt;ref name=LaRose_2001 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Palmgreen_1985&gt;{{cite journal|last=Palmgreen|first=P|author2=L. Wenner|author3=K. Rosengren|title=Uses and gratifications research: The past ten years.|journal=Media gratifications research|year=1985|pages=1–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultivation theory===
[[Cultivation theory]] is concerned with understanding the role that media play in shaping a person's world view—specifically television. Whereas UGT tries to understand the motivations that drive media usage, Cultivation theory focuses on the psychological effects of media. Cultivation theory is used especially to study violence in television and how it shapes audience's understanding of the reality of violence in society. Often, because of media's influence, audiences have a more heightened and unrealistic perception of the amount of violence. A UGT approach may be implemented to Cultivation theory cases to understand why an audience would seek violent media and if audiences seek [[Research on the effects of violence in mass media|television violence]] to satisfy the need of confirmation of their worldview.

==Theory criticism==
Uses and gratifications has, almost since its inception, been viewed by some as the Pluto of communication theory, which is to say critics argue that it does not meet the standards necessary to be theory. Critics argue that it instead is more of an approach to analysis or a data-collecting strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Littlejohn, 2002; Severin and Tankard, 1997; McQuail 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;
Among the criticism most commonly raised in academic literature:
*Gratifications are more dependent on input by researchers than on decisions made by research subjects.&lt;ref name="Lometti, G. E. 1977"&gt;Lometti, G. E., Reeves, B., &amp; Bybee, C. R. (1977). Investigating the assumptions of uses and gratifications research. Communication Research, 4(3), 321-338.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Early research required participants to identify gratifications associated with specific channels of communication, raising the possibility that they would conflate gratifications and channels. Lometti et al. argued that this could "substantially overestimate" the number of gratifications, and that attempts to address it using in-depth interviews were problematic (p.&amp;nbsp;323).&lt;ref name="Lometti, G. E. 1977"/&gt;
*Audiences of different ages likely have different motivations for using identical media, and also likely have different gratifications.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, B. S. (1974). Gratifications of television viewing and their correlates for British children. The uses of mass communications: Current perspectives on gratifications research, 3, 71-92.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Due to the individualistic nature of uses and gratification, it is difficult to take the information that is collected in studies. Most research relies on pure recollection of memory rather than data.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elihu Katz|Katz, Elihu]], [[Jay Blumler|Jay G. Blumler]], and Michael Gurevitch. "Uses and Gratifications Research."The Public Opinion Quarterly 4th ser. 37 (1973–1974): 509-23. JSTOR. Web. 14 Oct. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This makes self-reports complicated and immeasurable.
*The theory has been denounced by media hegemony advocates who say it goes too far in claiming that people are free to choose the media and the interpretations they desire.&lt;ref&gt;Severin, W. J., &amp; Tankard, J. W. (1997). Uses of mass media. Communication theories: Origins, methods, and uses in the mass media.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Audiences interpret the media in their own terms and any debate for or against this can be argued, and depending on the circumstances, won by either side. Each individuals' actions and effects on those actions will depend solely on the situation. Each individual has unique uses to which the media attempts to meet their gratifications.

Using this sociologically-based theory has little to no link to the benefit of psychology due to its weakness in operational definitions and weak analytical mode. It also is focused too narrowly on the individual and neglects the social structure and place of the media in that structure. Ruggiero (2000) wrote that "most scholars agree that early research had little theoretical coherence and was primarily behaviorist and individualist in its methodological tendencies."&lt;ref name="Ruggiero, T. E. 2000"&gt;Ruggiero, T. E. (2000). Uses and gratifications theory in the 21st century. Mass communication &amp; society, 3(1), 3-37.&lt;/ref&gt; Blumler (1979) and other critics have argued that line between gratification and satisfaction is blurred, and Blumler wrote that "the nature of the theory underlying uses and gratifications research is not totally clear."&lt;ref&gt;Blumler, J. G. (1979). The role of theory in uses and gratifications studies. Communication research, 6(1), 9-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite such criticism, contemporary thought suggests that uses and gratifications as theory may be in the process of gaining new life as a result of new communication technology. While it was easy to question the agency of media consumers who had three television networks from which to choose, it's much harder to argue that a consumer who now has 100 cable channels and Internet-streaming video is not making his own decisions. Sundar &amp; Limperos (2013) write that what had been called the "audience" is now referred to as "users," and "usage implies volitional action, not simply passive reception."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Sundar|first1 = S. S.|last2 = Limperos|first2 = A. M.|year = 2013|title = Uses and Grats 2.0: New Gratifications for New Media|url =|journal = Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media|volume = 57|issue = 4| pages = 504–525|doi = 10.1080/08838151.2013.845827 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The active audience===
Among the most criticized tenets of uses and gratifications as theory is the assumption of an active audience. Ruggerio (2000) noted three assumptions that are necessary to the idea of active audience: First, media selection is initiated by the individual.&lt;ref name="Ruggiero, T. E. 2000"/&gt; Second, expectations regarding the use of media must be a product of individual predispositions, social interactions and environmental factors. And third, the active audience exhibits goal-directed behavior. This concept of active audience finds, at best, limited acceptance outside of the United States.&lt;ref name="Ruggiero, T. E. 2000"/&gt;

Jay Blumler presented a number of interesting points, as to why Uses and Gratifications cannot measure an active audience. He stated, "The issue to be considered here is whether what has been thought about Uses and Gratifications Theory has been an article of faith and if it could now be converted into an empirical question such as: How to measure an active audience?" (Blumler, 1979). Blumler then offered suggestions about the kinds of activity the audiences were engaging with in the different types of media.
*'''Utility''' : "Using the media to accomplish specific tasks"&lt;ref name="WestTurner392401"&gt;West, Richard L., and Lynn H. Turner. "Uses and Gratifications Theory." Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application. Boston: McGraw-Hill, 2010. 392-401. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Intentionality''': "Occurs when people's prior motive determine use of media"&lt;ref name="WestTurner392401"/&gt;
*'''Selectivity''': "Audience members' use of media reflect their existing interests"&lt;ref name="WestTurner392401"/&gt;
*'''Imperviousness to Influence''': "Refers to audience members' constructing their own meaning from media content"&lt;ref name="WestTurner392401"/&gt;

25 years later, in 1972, Blumler, McQuail and Brown extended Lasswell's four groups. These included four primary factors for which one may use the media:&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;
*'''Diversion''': Escape from routine and problems; an emotional release&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;
*'''Personal Relationships''': Social utility of information in conversation; substitution of media for companionship&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;
*'''Personal Identity or Individual Psychology''': Value reinforcement or reassurance; self-understanding, reality exploration&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;
*'''Surveillance''': Information about factors which might affect one or will help one do or accomplish something&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1973) saw mass media as a means by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others. They developed 35 needs taken from the largely speculative literature on the social and psychological functions of the mass media and put them into five categories:
*'''Cognitive Needs''': Acquiring information, knowledge and understanding&lt;ref name="WestTurner392401"/&gt;
**''Media Examples'': Television (news), video (how-to), movies (documentaries or based on history)
*'''Affective Needs''': Emotion, pleasure, feelings&lt;ref name="WestTurner392401"/&gt;
**''Media Examples'': Movies, television (soap operas, sitcoms)
*'''Personal Integrative Needs''': Credibility, stability, status&lt;ref name="WestTurner392401"/&gt;
**''Media Examples'': Video
*'''Social Integrative Needs''': Family and friends&lt;ref name="WestTurner392401"/&gt;
**''Media Examples'': Internet (e-mail, instant messaging, chat rooms, social media)
*'''Tension Release Needs''': Escape and diversion&lt;ref name="WestTurner392401"/&gt;
**''Media Examples'': Television, movies, video, radio, internet
