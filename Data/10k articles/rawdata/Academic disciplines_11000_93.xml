      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51737">The '''APG IV system''' of flowering plant classification is the fourth version of a modern, mostly [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular]]-based, [[list of systems of plant taxonomy|system of plant taxonomy]] for [[flowering plant]]s (angiosperms) being developed by the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]] (APG). It was published in 2016, seven years after its predecessor the [[APG III system]] was published in 2009, and 18 years after the first [[APG system]] was published in 1998.{{sfnp|ps=none|APG IV|2016}} In 2009, a linear arrangement of the system was published separately;{{sfnp|ps=none|Haston|Richardson|Stevens|Chase|2009}} the APG IV paper includes such an arrangement, cross-referenced to the 2009 one.{{sfnp|ps=none|APG IV|2016}}

Compared to the APG III system, the APG IV system recognizes five new orders ([[Boraginales]], [[Dilleniales]], [[Icacinales]], [[Metteniusales]] and [[Vahliales]]), along with some new families, making a total of 64 angiosperm orders and 416 families.{{sfnp|ps=none|APG IV|2016}} In general, the authors describe their philosophy as "conservative", based on making changes from APG III only where "a well-supported need" has been demonstrated. This has sometimes resulted in placements that are not compatible with published studies, but where further research is needed before the classification can be changed.{{sfnp|ps=none|APG IV|2016|p=5}}

{{Advanced Placement}}

'''Advanced Placement World History''' (also known as '''AP World History''', '''WHAP''', '''AP World''' or '''APWH''') is a college-level course and examination offered to high school students through the [[College Board|College Board's]] [[Advanced Placement|Advanced Placement Program]] designed to help students develop a greater understanding of the evolution of global processes and contacts as well as interactions between different types of human society. The course advances this understanding through a combination of selective factual knowledge and appropriate analytical skills. Students study all prehistory and history, especially from 8000 [[Common Era|BC]]E to the present day. It was announced in July 2018 that the test would be changed to an AP World History: Modern exam that only contains content since 1200 CE, starting in the 2019-2020 school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-world-history/course/2019-20-changes|title=SA:WH:2019-20 AP World History Changes|work=AP Central|access-date=2018-09-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AP World History exam was first administered in 2002. The course has undergone multiple changes with the latest changes effective Fall 2017. Often times in the United States, students take the course in their sophomore year of high school, but this is not a requirement.

The multiple choice section is weighted as 40% of one's  total score (Section I Part A). It consists of 55 questions to be answered in 55 minutes based on the accompanying sources.

While previously the exam deducted 1/4 of a point for every incorrect answer, starting from 2011 on, the penalty for incorrect answers had been removed. It is to one's advantage to attempt every question possible within the time limit.  Note also that the number of multiple choice options is being reduced from five to four at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AP World History Course and Exam Description|url=http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/AP_WorldHistoryCED_Effective_Fall_2011.pdf|publisher=College Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This test underwent a major re-haul for the 2017 exam, however, due to the prodigious number of students that struggled with the free response section, the College Board decided to initiate yet another round of sweeping reform, to be put in effect in May 2018. Currently it has the same format as [[Advanced Placement United States History]] and [[Advanced Placement European History]]. The exam features a new section (Section I Part B) that requires three short answer questions, one of which is selected from two options. Each question has three parts, making for a total of 9 parts within the SAQ section. Students have forty minutes to answer these, and they count for twenty percent of the exam score.

Section II lasts for a total of 100 minutes, and it includes a document-based question (DBQ) and a long essay question (LEQ). Students are allowed to work on either essay within this total time period. The section begins with a 15-minute reading period where students are advised to read both the documents for DBQ. However, students may begin writing during this time; most students take notes on the documents in order to plan out the DBQ. Students are advised to spend 45 minutes writing the DBQ and then 40 writing the LEQ, but there are no rules on when each essay must be worked on. There are three prompts for the LEQ, but only one needs to be chosen. Each LEQ prompt addresses a different period, with one addressing periods 1 &amp; 2, another addressing periods 3 &amp; 4, and a third addressing periods 5 &amp; 6.

The DBQ counts for 25% of the total exam score, and the LEQ is 15%. The essays are out of seven points and six points, respectively. Students are required to analyze and synthesize the documents of the DBQ, but some outside information is still needed. The LEQ only provides a prompt and no sort of stimulus, so a large amount of outside information is necessary.

In 2012, the head of AP Grading, Trevor Packer, stated that the reason for the low percentages of 5s is that "AP World History is a college-level course, &amp; many sophomores aren't yet writing at that level." 10.44 percent of all seniors who took the exam in 2012 received a 5, while 6.62 percent of sophomores received a 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/AP_Trevor/status/215559243930144770|title=Trevor Packer|work=Twitter|accessdate=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Asymptotic safety''' (sometimes also referred to as '''nonperturbative renormalizability''') is a concept in [[quantum field theory]] which aims at finding a consistent and predictive quantum theory of the [[Gravitation|gravitational field]]. Its key ingredient is a [[#Gaussian_and_non-Gaussian_fixed_points|nontrivial fixed point]] of the theory's [[renormalization group]] flow which controls the behavior of the [[coupling constants]] in the ultraviolet (UV) regime and renders physical quantities safe from divergences. Although originally proposed by [[Steven Weinberg]] to find a theory of [[quantum gravity]], the idea of a nontrivial fixed point providing a possible [[UV completion]] can be applied also to other field theories, in particular to [[Renormalization#Renormalizability|perturbatively nonrenormalizable]] ones.  In this respect, it is similar to [[quantum triviality]].

The essence of asymptotic safety is the observation that nontrivial renormalization group fixed points can be used to generalize the procedure of [[Renormalization|perturbative renormalization]]. In an asymptotically safe theory the [[coupling constant|couplings]] do not need to be small or tend to zero in the high energy limit but rather tend to finite values: they approach a nontrivial [[UV fixed point]]. The running of the coupling constants, i.e. their scale dependence described by the renormalization group (RG), is thus special in its UV limit in the sense that all their dimensionless combinations remain finite. This suffices to avoid unphysical divergences, e.g. in [[S-Matrix|scattering amplitudes]]. The requirement of a UV fixed point restricts the form of the [[Action (physics)|bare action]] and the values of the bare coupling constants, which become predictions of the asymptotic safety program rather than inputs.

As for gravity, the standard procedure of perturbative renormalization fails since [[Newton's constant]], the relevant expansion parameter, has negative [[classical scaling dimension|mass dimension]] rendering [[general relativity]] perturbatively nonrenormalizable. This has driven the search for nonperturbative frameworks describing quantum gravity, including asymptotic safety which — in contrast to other approaches—is characterized by its use of quantum field theory methods, without depending on perturbative techniques, however. At the present time, there is accumulating evidence for a fixed point suitable for asymptotic safety, while a rigorous proof of its existence is still lacking.

== Motivation ==
Gravity, at the classical level, is described by [[Einstein field equation|Einstein's field equations]] of general relativity,
&lt;math&gt;\textstyle R_{\mu \nu} - {1 \over 2}g_{\mu \nu}\,R + g_{\mu \nu} \Lambda = 8 \pi G \, T_{\mu \nu}&lt;/math&gt;. These equations combine the [[spacetime]] geometry encoded in the [[metric tensor|metric]] &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; with the matter content comprised in the [[stress–energy tensor|energy–momentum tensor]] &lt;math&gt;T_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;. The quantum nature of matter has been tested experimentally, for instance [[quantum electrodynamics]] is by now one of the most accurately confirmed theories in physics. For this reason quantization of gravity seems plausible, too. Unfortunately the quantization cannot be performed in the standard way (perturbative renormalization): Already a simple power-counting consideration signals the perturbative nonrenormalizability since the [[classical scaling dimension|mass dimension]] of Newton's constant is &lt;math&gt;-2&lt;/math&gt;. The problem occurs as follows. According to the [[renormalization|traditional point of view]] renormalization is implemented via the introduction of counterterms that should cancel divergent expressions appearing in [[loop integral]]s. Applying this method to gravity, however, the counterterms required to eliminate all divergences proliferate to an infinite number. As this inevitably leads to an infinite number of free parameters to be measured in experiments, the program is unlikely to have predictive power beyond its use as a low energy [[Effective field theory|effective theory]].

It turns out that the first divergences in the quantization of general relativity which cannot be absorbed in counterterms consistently (i.e. without the necessity of introducing new parameters) appear already at one-loop level in the presence of matter fields.&lt;ref name=tHooft&gt;{{cite journal|last='t Hooft|first=Gerard|last2=Veltman |first2=Martinus J. G.|title=One-loop divergences in the theory of gravitation|journal=Annales de l'Institut Henri Poincaré|year=1974|volume=20|series=A|pages=69–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
At two-loop level the problematic divergences arise even in pure gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goroff|first=Marc H.|author2=Sagnotti, Augusto|title=The ultraviolet behavior of Einstein gravity|journal=Nuclear Physics|year=1986|volume=266|series=B|issue=3–4|pages=709–736|doi=10.1016/0550-3213(86)90193-8|bibcode = 1986NuPhB.266..709G }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In order to overcome this conceptual difficulty the development of nonperturbative techniques was required, providing various [[Quantum gravity#Candidate theories|candidate theories of quantum gravity]].
For a long time the prevailing view has been that the very concept of quantum field theory — even though remarkably successful in the case of the other fundamental interactions — is doomed to failure for gravity. By way of contrast, the idea of asymptotic safety retains quantum fields as the theoretical arena and instead abandons only the traditional program of perturbative renormalization.

== History of asymptotic safety ==
After having realized the perturbative nonrenormalizability of gravity, physicists tried to employ alternative techniques to cure the divergence problem, for instance resummation or extended theories with suitable matter fields and symmetries, all of which come with their own drawbacks. In 1976, [[Steven Weinberg]] proposed a generalized version of the condition of renormalizability, based on a nontrivial fixed point of the underlying [[renormalization group]] (RG) flow for gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weinberg|first=Steven|chapter=Critical Phenomena for Field Theorists |editor-last=Zichichi |editor-first=Antonino |title=Understanding the Fundamental Constituents of Matter |pages=1–52|year=1978|series= The Subnuclear Series|volume=14 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4684-0931-4_1|isbn=978-1-4684-0931-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This was called asymptotic safety.&lt;ref name="Weinberg"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weinberg|first=Steven|chapter=Ultraviolet divergences in quantum theories of gravitation|year=1979|title=General Relativity: An Einstein centenary survey |editor1=S.

The idea of a UV completion by means of a nontrivial fixed point of the renormalization groups had been proposed earlier by [[Kenneth G. Wilson]] and [[Giorgio Parisi]] in [[scalar field theory]]&lt;ref name="WilsonReview"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Kenneth G.|author2=Kogut, John B.|title=The renormalization group and the ε expansion|journal=Physics Reports|year=1974|volume=12|issue=2|pages=75–199|doi=10.1016/0370-1573(74)90023-4|bibcode = 1974PhR....12...75W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Parisi| first= Giorgio | title=On Non-Renormalizable Interactions | journal= New Developments in Quantum Field Theory and Statistical Mechanics Cargèse | year=1976 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4615-8918-1_12 | pages=281–305| isbn= 978-1-4615-8920-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
(see also [[Quantum triviality]]).
The applicability to perturbatively nonrenormalizable theories was first demonstrated explicitly for the [[Non-linear sigma model]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Brezin | first= Eduard |author2= Zinn-Justin, Jean| title=Renormalization of the nonlinear sigma model in 2 + epsilon dimensions | journal=Physical Review Letters| year= 1976 | volume=36 | issue= 13 |pages=691–693|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.36.691 |bibcode = 1976PhRvL..36..691B }}&lt;/ref&gt; and for a variant of the [[Gross-Neveu model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaw&amp;#281;dzki|first=Krzysztof|author2=Kupiainen, Antti|title=Renormalizing the nonrenormalizable|journal=Physical Review Letters|year=1985|volume=55|issue=4|pages=363–365|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.55.363|bibcode = 1985PhRvL..55..363G|pmid=10032331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for gravity, the first studies concerning this new concept were performed in &lt;math&gt;d=2+\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; spacetime dimensions in the late seventies. In exactly two dimensions there is a theory of pure gravity that is renormalizable according to the old point of view. (In order to render the [[Einstein–Hilbert action]] &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {1 \over 16\pi G} \int \mathrm{d}^2 x \sqrt{g} \, R&lt;/math&gt; dimensionless, Newton's constant &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; must have [[classical scaling dimension|mass dimension]] zero.) For small but finite &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]] is still applicable, and one can expand the [[Beta function (physics)|beta-function]] (&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-function) describing the renormalization group running of Newton's constant as a power series in &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, in this spirit it was possible to prove that it displays a nontrivial fixed point.&lt;ref name="Weinberg" /&gt;

However, it was not clear how to do a continuation from &lt;math&gt;d=2+\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;d=4&lt;/math&gt; dimensions as the calculations relied on the smallness of the expansion parameter &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. The computational methods for a nonperturbative treatment were not at hand by this time. For this reason the idea of asymptotic safety in quantum gravity was put aside for some years. Only in the early 90s, aspects of &lt;math&gt;2+\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; dimensional gravity have been revised in various works, but still not continuing the dimension to four.

As for calculations beyond perturbation theory, the situation improved with the advent of new [[functional renormalization group]] methods, in particular the so-called ''effective average action'' (a scale dependent version of the [[effective action]]). Introduced in 1993 by [[Christof Wetterich]] and Tim R Morris for scalar theories,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wetterich|first=Christof|title=Exact evolution equation for the effective potential|journal=Phys.

In 1996, Martin Reuter constructed a similar effective average action and the associated flow equation for the gravitational field.&lt;ref name="MR1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reuter|first=Martin|title=Nonperturbative evolution equation for quantum gravity|journal=Phys. Rev.|volume=57|series=D|year=1998|pages=971–985|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.57.971|issue=2|arxiv=hep-th/9605030|bibcode = 1998PhRvD..57..971R }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It complies with the requirement of [[background independence]], one of the fundamental tenets of quantum gravity. This work can be considered an essential breakthrough in asymptotic safety related studies on quantum gravity as it provides the possibility of nonperturbative computations for arbitrary spacetime dimensions. It was shown that at least for the [[#The_Einstein–Hilbert_truncation|Einstein–Hilbert truncation]], the simplest ansatz for the effective average action, a nontrivial fixed point is indeed present.

These results mark the starting point for many calculations that followed. Since it was not clear in the pioneer work by Martin Reuter to what extent the findings depended on the truncation ansatz considered, the next obvious step consisted in enlarging the truncation. This process was initiated by Roberto Percacci and collaborators, starting with the inclusion of matter fields.&lt;ref name="DouPercacci"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dou|first=Djamel|author2=Percacci, Roberto|title=The running gravitational couplings|journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity|year=1998|volume=15|issue=11|pages=3449–3468|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/15/11/011|arxiv=hep-th/9707239|bibcode = 1998CQGra..15.3449D }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Up to the present many different works by a continuously growing community – including, e.g., &lt;math&gt;f(R)&lt;/math&gt;- and [[Weyl tensor]] squared truncations – have confirmed independently that the asymptotic safety scenario is actually possible: The existence of a nontrivial fixed point was shown within each truncation studied so far.&lt;ref name="reviews"&gt;For reviews on asymptotic safety and QEG with comprehensive lists of references see [[#Further_reading|Further reading]].&lt;/ref&gt; Although still lacking a final proof, there is mounting evidence that the asymptotic safety program can ultimately lead to a consistent and predictive quantum theory of gravity within the general framework of [[quantum field theory]].

== Asymptotic safety: The main idea ==

=== Theory space ===

[[File:UVCriticalSurfaceInTheorySpace.png|thumb|380px|Trajectories of the [[renormalization group]] flow in theory space, parametrized by infinitely many coupling constants. By convention, the arrows of the vector field (and the one on the green trajectory) point from UV to IR scales. The set of actions which lie inside the theory space and are pulled into the [[UV fixed point|fixed point]] under the inverse RG flow (i.e., going in the direction opposite to the arrows) is referred to as UV critical surface. The asymptotic safety hypothesis is that a trajectory can only be realized in Nature if it is contained in the UV critical surface since only then it has a well-behaved high energy limit (orange, blue, and magenta trajectories, by way of example). Trajectories outside this surface escape theory space for &lt;math&gt;k\rightarrow\infty&lt;/math&gt; since they develop unacceptable divergences in the UV, while going to lower scales they approach the UV critical surface. This situation is represented by the green trajectory which lies above the surface and runs away from it for increasing RG scale (opposite to the green arrow).]]

The asymptotic safety program adopts a modern [[Renormalization group|Wilsonian viewpoint]] on quantum field theory. Here the basic input data to be fixed at the beginning are, firstly, the kinds of quantum fields carrying the theory's [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] and, secondly, the underlying [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetries]]. For any theory considered, these data determine the stage the renormalization group dynamics takes place on, the so-called theory space. It consists of all possible action functionals depending on the fields selected and respecting the prescribed symmetry principles. Each point in this theory space thus represents one possible action. Often one may think of the space as spanned by all suitable field monomials. In this sense any action in theory space is a linear combination of field monomials, where the corresponding coefficients are the [[coupling constants]], &lt;math&gt;\{g_\alpha\}&lt;/math&gt;. (Here all couplings are assumed to be dimensionless. Couplings can always be made dimensionless by multiplication with a suitable power of the RG scale.)

=== Renormalization group flow ===

The [[renormalization group]] (RG) describes the change of a physical system due to smoothing or averaging out microscopic details when going to a lower resolution. This brings into play a notion of scale dependence for the action functionals of interest. Infinitesimal RG transformations map actions to nearby ones, thus giving rise to a vector field on theory space. The scale dependence of an action is encoded in a "running" of the coupling constants parametrizing this action, &lt;math&gt;\{g_\alpha\} \equiv \{g_\alpha(k)\}&lt;/math&gt;, with the RG scale &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. This gives rise to a trajectory in theory space (RG trajectory), describing the evolution of an action functional with respect to the scale. Which of all possible trajectories is realized in Nature has to be determined by measurements.

=== Taking the UV limit ===

The construction of a quantum field theory amounts to finding an RG trajectory which is infinitely extended in the sense that the action functional described by &lt;math&gt;\{g_\alpha(k)\}&lt;/math&gt; is well-behaved for all values of the momentum scale parameter &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, including the [[infrared limit]] &lt;math&gt;k \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; and the ultraviolet (UV) limit &lt;math&gt;k \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;. Asymptotic safety is a way of dealing with the latter limit. Its fundamental requirement is the existence of a [[UV fixed point|fixed point]] of the RG flow. By definition this is a point &lt;math&gt;\{g_\alpha^*\}&lt;/math&gt; in the theory space where the running of all couplings stops, or, in other words, a zero of all [[Beta function (physics)|beta-functions]]: &lt;math&gt;\beta_\gamma(\{g_\alpha^*\})=0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;. In addition that fixed point must have at least one UV-attractive direction. This ensures that there are one or more RG trajectories which run into the fixed point for increasing scale. The set of all points in the theory space that are "pulled" into the UV fixed point by going to larger scales is referred to as ''UV critical surface''. Thus the UV critical surface consists of all those trajectories which are safe from UV divergences in the sense that all couplings approach finite fixed point values as &lt;math&gt;k\rightarrow\infty&lt;/math&gt;. The key hypothesis underlying asymptotic safety is that only trajectories running entirely within the UV critical surface of an appropriate fixed point can be infinitely extended and thus define a fundamental quantum field theory. It is obvious that such trajectories are well-behaved in the UV limit as the existence of a fixed point allows them to "stay at a point" for an infinitely long RG "time".

With regard to the fixed point, UV-attractive directions are called relevant, UV-repulsive ones irrelevant, since the corresponding scaling fields increase and decrease, respectively, when the scale is lowered. Therefore, the dimensionality of the UV critical surface equals the number of relevant couplings. An asymptotically safe theory is thus the more predictive the smaller is the dimensionality of the corresponding UV critical surface.

For instance, if the UV critical surface has the finite dimension &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; it is sufficient to perform only &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; measurements in order to uniquely identify Nature's RG trajectory. Once the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; relevant couplings are measured, the requirement of asymptotic safety fixes all other couplings since the latter have to be adjusted in such a way that the RG trajectory lies within the UV critical surface. In this spirit the theory is highly predictive as infinitely many parameters are fixed by a finite number of measurements.

In contrast to other approaches, a bare action which should be promoted to a quantum theory is not needed as an input here. It is the theory space and the RG flow equations that determine possible UV fixed points. Since such a fixed point, in turn, corresponds to a bare action, one can consider the bare action a prediction in the asymptotic safety program. This may be thought of as a systematic search strategy among theories that are already "quantum" which identifies the "islands" of physically acceptable theories in the "sea" of unacceptable ones plagued by short distance singularities.

=== Gaussian and non-Gaussian fixed points ===

A fixed point is called ''Gaussian'' if it corresponds to a free theory. Its [[critical exponents]] agree with the [[classical scaling dimension|canonical mass dimensions]] of the corresponding operators which usually amounts to the trivial fixed point values &lt;math&gt;g_\alpha^* = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all essential couplings &lt;math&gt;g_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. Thus standard perturbation theory is applicable only in the vicinity of a Gaussian fixed point. In this regard asymptotic safety at the Gaussian fixed point is equivalent to perturbative renormalizability plus [[asymptotic freedom]]. Due to the arguments presented in the introductory sections, however, this possibility is ruled out for gravity.

In contrast, a nontrivial fixed point, that is, a fixed point whose critical exponents differ from the canonical ones, is referred to as ''non-Gaussian''. Usually this requires &lt;math&gt;g_\alpha^* \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; for at least one essential &lt;math&gt;g_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. It is such a non-Gaussian fixed point that provides a possible scenario for quantum gravity. As yet, studies on this subject thus mainly focused on establishing its existence.

=== Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG) ===

Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG) is the generic name for any quantum field theory of gravity that (regardless of its [[Action (physics)|bare action]]) takes the [[metric tensor|spacetime metric]] as the dynamical field variable and whose symmetry is given by [[diffeomorphism invariance]]. This fixes the [[#Theory_space|theory space]] and an RG flow of the effective average action defined over it, but it does not single out a priori any specific action functional. However, the flow equation determines a vector field on that theory space which can be investigated. If it displays a non-Gaussian fixed point by means of which the UV limit can be taken in the "asymptotically safe" way, this point acquires the status of the bare action.

The primary tool for investigating the gravitational [[renormalization group|RG]] flow with respect to the energy scale &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; at the nonperturbative level is the effective average action &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k &lt;/math&gt; for gravity.&lt;ref name="MR1"/&gt; It is the scale dependent version of the [[effective action]] where in the underlying [[Functional integration|functional integral]] field modes with covariant [[momenta]] below &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; are suppressed while only the remaining are integrated out. For a given theory space, let &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of dynamical and background fields, respectively. Then &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k &lt;/math&gt; satisfies the following [[Functional renormalization group|Wetterich-Morris-type functional RG equation]] (FRGE):&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
k \partial_k \Gamma_k\big[\Phi, \bar{\Phi}\big] = \frac{1}{2}\,\mbox{STr}\Big[\big(\Gamma_k^{(2)}\big[\Phi, \bar{\Phi}\big] + \mathcal{R}_k[\bar{\Phi}]\big)^{-1} k \partial_k \mathcal{R}_k[\bar{\Phi}] \Big] .
&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k^{(2)} &lt;/math&gt; is the second [[functional derivative]] of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the quantum fields  &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; at fixed &lt;math&gt;\bar{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt;. The mode suppression operator &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}_k[\bar{\Phi}]&lt;/math&gt; provides a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-dependent mass-term for fluctuations with covariant momenta &lt;math&gt;p^2 \ll k^2&lt;/math&gt; and vanishes for &lt;math&gt;p^2 \gg k^2&lt;/math&gt;.
Its appearance in the numerator and denominator renders the [[supertrace]] &lt;math&gt;(\mbox{STr})&lt;/math&gt; both infrared and UV finite, peaking at momenta &lt;math&gt;p^2 \approx k^2&lt;/math&gt;. The FRGE is an exact equation without any perturbative approximations. Given an initial condition it determines &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k&lt;/math&gt; for all scales uniquely.

The solutions &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k&lt;/math&gt; of the FRGE interpolate between the bare (microscopic) action at &lt;math&gt;k \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt; and the [[effective action]] &lt;math&gt;\Gamma[\Phi] = \Gamma_{k=0}\big[\Phi, \bar{\Phi}=\Phi\big] &lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;k \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;. They can be visualized as trajectories in the underlying [[#Theory_space|theory space]]. Note that the FRGE itself is independent of the bare action. In the case of an asymptotically safe theory, the bare action is determined by the fixed point functional &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_* = \Gamma_{k\rightarrow\infty}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Truncations of the theory space ===

Let us assume there is a set of basis functionals &lt;math&gt;\{P_\alpha[\,\cdot\,]\}&lt;/math&gt; spanning the [[#Theory_space|theory space]] under consideration so that any action functional, i.e. any point of this theory space, can be written as a linear combination of the &lt;math&gt;P_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;'s. Then solutions &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k&lt;/math&gt; of the [[#Exact_functional_renormalization_group_equation|FRGE]] have expansions of the form

:&lt;math&gt;
\Gamma_k[\Phi,\bar{\Phi}] = \sum\limits_{\alpha=1}^{\infty} g_\alpha(k) P_\alpha[\Phi,\bar{\Phi}] .
&lt;/math&gt;

Inserting this expansion into the FRGE and expanding the trace on its right-hand side in order to extract the [[Beta function (physics)|beta-functions]], one obtains the exact RG equation in component form: &lt;math&gt;k \partial_k g_\alpha(k) = \beta_\alpha(g_1,g_2,\cdots)&lt;/math&gt;. Together with the corresponding initial conditions these equations fix the evolution of the running couplings &lt;math&gt;g_\alpha(k)&lt;/math&gt;, and thus determine &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k&lt;/math&gt; completely. As one can see, the FRGE gives rise to a system of ''infinitely many'' coupled differential equations since there are infinitely many couplings, and the &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-functions can depend on all of them. This makes it very hard to solve the system in general.

A possible way out is to restrict the analysis on a finite-dimensional subspace as an approximation of the full theory space. In other words, such a ''truncation of the theory space'' sets all but a finite number of couplings to zero, considering only the reduced basis &lt;math&gt;\{P_\alpha[\,\cdot\,]\}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\alpha=1,\cdots,N&lt;/math&gt;. This amounts to the ansatz

:&lt;math&gt;
\Gamma_k[\Phi,\bar{\Phi}] = \sum\limits_{\alpha=1}^N g_\alpha(k) P_\alpha[\Phi,\bar{\Phi}] ,
&lt;/math&gt;

leading to a system of finitely many coupled differential equations, &lt;math&gt;k\partial_k g_\alpha(k) = \beta_\alpha(g_1,\cdots,g_N)&lt;/math&gt;, which can now be solved employing analytical or numerical techniques.

Clearly a truncation should be chosen such that it incorporates as many features of the exact flow as possible. Although it is an approximation, the truncated flow still exhibits the nonperturbative character of the FRGE, and the &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-functions can contain contributions from all powers of the couplings.

Dark background color indicates a region of fast flow, in regions of light background the flow is slow or even zero. The latter case includes a vicinity of the Gaussian fixed point in the origin, and the NGFP in the center of the spiralling arrows, respectively. The cross-over trajectory tangent to the &lt;span style="color:#00d000"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt; arrows connects the non-Gaussian to the Gaussian fixed point and plays the role of a [[Separatrix (dynamical systems)|separatrix]].]]

=== The Einstein–Hilbert truncation ===

As described in the previous section, the [[#Exact_functional_renormalization_group_equation|FRGE]] lends itself to a systematic construction of nonperturbative approximations to the gravitational [[beta function (physics)|beta-functions]] by projecting the exact RG flow onto subspaces spanned by a suitable ansatz for &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k &lt;/math&gt;. In its simplest form, such an ansatz is given by the Einstein–Hilbert action where [[gravitational constant|Newton's constant]] &lt;math&gt;G_k&lt;/math&gt; and the [[cosmological constant]] &lt;math&gt;\Lambda_k&lt;/math&gt; depend on the RG scale &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar{g}_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; denote the dynamical and the background metric, respectively. Then &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k &lt;/math&gt; reads, for arbitrary spacetime dimension &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;
\Gamma_k[g,\bar{g},\xi,\bar{\xi}] = \frac{1}{16\pi G_k} \int\text{d}^d x\, \sqrt{g}\, \big( -R(g) + 2\Lambda_k \big) + \Gamma_k^\text{gf}[g,\bar{g}] + \Gamma_k^\text{gh}[g,\bar{g},\xi,\bar{\xi}] .
&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:QEGPhasePortraitEH.png|thumb|220px|Phase portrait for the Einstein–Hilbert truncation. Shown are the [[#Renormalization_group_flow|RG trajectories]] corresponding to the flow diagram on the left-hand side. (First obtained in Ref.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Reuter|first=Martin|author2=Saueressig, Frank|title=Renormalization group flow of quantum gravity in the Einstein-Hilbert truncation|journal=Phys. Rev. |year=2002|volume=65|issue=6|series=D|pages=065016|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.65.065016|arxiv=hep-th/0110054|bibcode = 2002PhRvD..65f5016R }}
&lt;/ref&gt;)]]

Here &lt;math&gt;R(g)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[scalar curvature]] constructed from the metric &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k^\text{gf}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[gauge fixing|gauge fixing action]], and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k^\text{gh}&lt;/math&gt; the [[Faddeev–Popov ghost|ghost action]] with the ghost fields &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar{\xi}&lt;/math&gt;.

The corresponding &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-functions, describing the evolution of the dimensionless Newton constant &lt;math&gt;g_k=k^{d-2} G_k&lt;/math&gt; and the dimensionless cosmological constant &lt;math&gt;\lambda_k=k^{-2}\Lambda_k&lt;/math&gt;, have been derived for the first time in reference&lt;ref name="MR1" /&gt; for any value of the spacetime dimensionality, including the cases of &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; below and above &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt; dimensions. In particular, in &lt;math&gt;d=4&lt;/math&gt; dimensions they give rise to the RG flow diagram shown on the left-hand side. The most important result is the existence of a non-Gaussian fixed point suitable for asymptotic safety. It is UV-attractive both in &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;- and in &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-direction.

This fixed point is related to the [[#History_of_asymptotic_safety|one]] found in &lt;math&gt;d=2 + \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; dimensions by perturbative methods in the sense that it is recovered in the nonperturbative approach presented here by inserting &lt;math&gt;d=2 + \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; into the &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-functions and expanding in powers of &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="MR1" /&gt; Since the &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-functions were shown to exist and explicitly computed for any real, i.e., not necessarily integer value of &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, no analytic continuation is involved here. The fixed point in &lt;math&gt;d=4&lt;/math&gt; dimensions, too, is a direct result of the nonperturbative flow equations, and, in contrast to the earlier attempts, no extrapolation in &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is required.

=== Extended truncations ===

Subsequently, the existence of the fixed point found within the Einstein–Hilbert truncation has been confirmed in subspaces of successively increasing complexity. The next step in this development was the inclusion of an &lt;math&gt;R^2&lt;/math&gt;-term in the truncation ansatz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lauscher|first=Oliver|author2=Reuter, Martin|title=Flow equation of quantum Einstein gravity in a higher-derivative truncation|journal=Physical Review D|year=2002|volume=66|issue=2|pages=025026|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.66.025026|arxiv=hep-th/0205062|bibcode = 2002PhRvD..66b5026L }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This has been extended further by taking into account polynomials of the scalar curvature &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; (so-called &lt;math&gt;f(R)&lt;/math&gt;-truncations),&lt;ref name="fRgravity"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Codello|first=Alessandro|author2=Percacci, Roberto|author3= Rahmede, Christoph|title=Ultraviolet properties of f(R)-gravity|journal=International Journal of Modern Physics A|year=2008|volume=23|issue=1|pages=143–150|doi=10.1142/S0217751X08038135|arxiv=0705.1769|bibcode = 2008IJMPA..23..143C }}&lt;/ref&gt;
and the square of the [[Weyl tensor|Weyl curvature tensor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benedetti|first=Dario|author2=Machado, Pedro F.|author3= Saueressig, Frank|title=Asymptotic safety in higher-derivative gravity|journal=Modern Physics Letters A|year=2009|volume=24|issue=28|pages=2233–2241|doi=10.1142/S0217732309031521|arxiv=0901.2984|bibcode = 2009MPLA...24.2233B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The contact to perturbation theory is established in: {{cite journal|last=Niedermaier|first=Max|title=Gravitational Fixed Points from Perturbation Theory|journal=Physical Review Letters|year=2009|volume=103|issue=10|pages=101303|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.101303|bibcode = 2009PhRvL.103j1303N|pmid=19792294}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Moreover, the impact of various kinds of matter fields has been investigated.&lt;ref name="DouPercacci" /&gt;
Also computations based on a field reparametrization invariant effective average action seem to recover the crucial fixed point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last=Donkin|first=Ivan|author2=Pawlowski, Jan M.|title=The phase diagram of quantum gravity from diffeomorphism-invariant RG-flows|year=2012|eprint=1203.4207|&lt;!--bibcode = 2012arXiv1203.4207D--&gt; |class=hep-th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In combination these results constitute strong evidence that gravity in four dimensions is a nonperturbatively renormalizable quantum field theory, indeed with a [[#Asymptotic safety: The main idea|UV critical surface]] of reduced dimensionality, coordinatized by only a few relevant couplings.&lt;ref name="reviews" /&gt;

== The microscopic structure of spacetime ==

Results of asymptotic safety related investigations indicate that the effective [[spacetime]]s of [[#Quantum_Einstein_Gravity_(QEG)|QEG]] have [[fractal]]-like properties on microscopic scales. It is possible to determine, for instance, their spectral dimension and argue that they undergo a dimensional reduction from 4 dimensions at [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic distances]] to 2 dimensions microscopically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lauscher|first=Oliver|author2=Reuter, Martin|title=Ultraviolet fixed point and generalized flow equation of quantum gravity|journal=Physical Review D|year=2001|volume=65|issue=2|pages=025013|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.65.025013|arxiv=hep-th/0108040|bibcode = 2002PhRvD..65b5013L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lauscher|first=Oliver|author2=Reuter, Martin|title=Fractal spacetime structure in asymptotically safe gravity|journal=Journal of High Energy Physics|year=2005|volume=10|issue=10|pages=050|doi=10.1088/1126-6708/2005/10/050|arxiv=hep-th/0508202|bibcode = 2005JHEP...10..050L }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this context it might be possible to draw the connection to other approaches to quantum gravity, e.g. to [[causal dynamical triangulation]]s, and compare the results.&lt;ref&gt;For a review see [[#Further_reading|Further reading]]: Reuter; Saueressig (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physics applications of asymptotically safe gravity ==

{{Main article|Physics applications of asymptotically safe gravity}}

Phenomenological consequences of the asymptotic safety scenario have been investigated in many areas of gravitational physics. As an example, asymptotic safety in combination with the [[Standard Model]] allows a statement about the mass of the [[Higgs boson]] and the value of the [[fine structure constant]].&lt;ref name="appl"&gt;See main article [[Physics applications of asymptotically safe gravity]] and references therein.&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, it provides possible explanations for particular phenomena in [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]] and [[astrophysics]], concerning [[black holes]] or [[Inflation (cosmology)|inflation]], for instance.&lt;ref name="appl" /&gt; These different studies take advantage of the possibility that the requirement of asymptotic safety can give rise to new predictions and conclusions for the models considered, often without depending on additional, possibly unobserved, assumptions.

{{Refimprove|date=April 2009}}
The '''Berlin Circle''' ({{lang-de|die Berliner Gruppe}}) was a group that maintained [[Logical positivism|logical empiricist]] views about [[philosophy]].

==History==
Berlin Circle was created in the late 1920s by [[Hans Reichenbach]], [[Kurt Grelling]] and [[Walter Dubislav]] and composed of philosophers and scientists such as [[Carl Gustav Hempel]], [[David Hilbert]] and [[Richard von Mises]]. Its original name was ''Die Gesellschaft für empirische Philosophie'', which in English may be translated as "the society for empirical philosophy". Together with the [[Vienna Circle]], they published the journal ''[[Erkenntnis]]'' ("Knowledge") edited by [[Rudolf Carnap]] and Reichenbach, and organized several congresses and colloquia concerning the [[philosophy of science]], the first of which was held in [[Prague]] in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/berlincr/ "Berlin Circle" entry in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berlin Circle had much in common with the Vienna Circle, but the philosophies of the circles differed on a few subjects, such as [[probability]] and [[conventionalism]]. Reichenbach insisted on calling his philosophy logical empiricism, to distinguish it from the logical positivism of the Vienna Circle. Few people today make the distinction, and the words are often used interchangeably.

Members of the Berlin Circle were particularly active in analyzing the philosophical and [[logical consequence]]s of the advances in contemporary [[physics]], especially the [[theory of relativity]]. Apart from that, they denied the [[soundness]] of [[metaphysics]] and traditional philosophy and asserted that many philosophical problems are indeed meaningless.

After the rise of [[Nazism]], several of the group's members emigrated to other countries, including Reichenbach, who moved to [[Turkey]] in 1933  and later to the United States in 1938; Dubislav emigrated in 1936; Hempel moved to Belgium in 1934 and later to the United States in 1939; and Grelling was killed in a [[concentration camp]]. A younger member of the Berlin Circle or Berlin School to leave Germany was [[Olaf Helmer]] who joined the [[RAND Corporation]] and played an important role in the development of the [[Delphi method]] used for predicting future trends, and other early forms of [[social technology]].&lt;ref&gt;''Berlin School of Logical Empiricism'' by [[Nicholas Rescher]] (Springer, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

After emigrating to various countries the group effectively came to an end, but not without influencing a wide range of philosophers of the 20th century, its method having been especially influential on [[analytic philosophy]] and [[futurology]].

Historical accounts for early U.S. naval history now occur across the spectrum of two and more centuries. This Bibliography lends itself primarily to [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] covering early U.S. naval history beginning around the [[American Revolution]] period on through the 18th and 19th centuries and includes sources which cover notable naval commanders, Presidents, important ships, major naval engagements and corresponding wars. The bibliography also includes sources that are not committed to the subject of U.S. naval history per se but whose content covers this subject extensively.

Among the contemporary and earlier historical accounts are [[WP:PSTS|primary sources]], historical accounts, often derived from letters, dispatches, government and military records, captain's logs and diaries, etc., written by authors who were involved in or closely associated to the historical episode in question. Primary source material is often collected, compiled and published by other editors also, sometimes many years after the historical subject has passed. Many of the authors are notable and even famous in their own right and are linked to their corresponding biographies.

==Listing and format of sources==
Sources dedicated to or well committed to a subject are listed under that subject/section.
Sources in any given section can often be used for other subjects/section so a link is sometimes provided to those section(s). A few of the more general sources are sometimes duplicated in the various sections where they equally apply. Sections/subjects are listed in chronological order.  For uniformity in the listing, sources in this bibliography employ the format supported by [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Bibliographies#Examples|WikiProject Bibliographies]], presented in the example shown directly below, noting author's ''lastname'' first, etc., year-date of publication, book title in ''italics'', number of pages, ISBN and/or OCLC number (when available):
&lt;center&gt;
*'''Last, First, (1900), ''Book-title'', Publisher, 123 pages, ISBN '''0123...''', Url'''''
&lt;/center&gt;
Primary sources listed in this bibliography are denoted with an uppercase bold ' ('''P''') ' before the book title. Many of the historical accounts were authored by members and ex-members of the U.S. Navy who have not only offered primary accounts but have very often gone on to write about naval history in other general and specific capacities—these sources will be denoted with an  ' ('''N''') ' following the author's name.

Many of the sources are available for searching and viewing online. Copyrighted publications are often offered for partial viewing, while sources in the public domain can be viewed in their entirety and are denoted with '' 'E'book' ''. At this late date most of the publications are now available in PDF and/or EPUB formats.  A link to the publication is included at the end of a given title listing.

As the listings in the various sections are often lengthy, a link to the ''' 'Top' ''' of a given section is provided at the end of that section.

[[File:Parygin boris dmitrievitch.jpg|thumb|alt="Photo of Russian scientist Boris Parygin."|'''Boris Parygin'''.]]

'''Boris Dmitrievitch Parygin''' (Russian: Борис Дмитриевич Парыгин) (19 June 1930 – 9 April 2012) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and Russian philosopher, sociologist and one of the founders of [[social psychology]] and member of a wide range of international academies. Parygin was a specialist in a sphere of philosophical and psychological problems of social psychology – its history, methodology, theory and [[praxeology]].

== Biography ==
Parygin was born in [[Leningrad]], [[USSR]], where he survived the [[Siege of Leningrad]]. After school he attended [[Saint Petersburg State University]] where he studied philosophy (1948—1953, diploma with distinction). In 1961 he defended a theses about a problem of the social mood. In 1967 defended a doctoral theses ''Social Psychology as a science (questions of history, methodology and theory)''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childpsy.ru/upload/dissertations/%CF%E0%F0%FB%E3%E8%ED_%C1_%C4_8_1967.htm Парыгин_Б_Д_8_1967&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
After graduation he was teaching philosophy at [[Saint Petersburg State Pediatric Medical Academy]] (1957–1962). In 1965, Saint Petersburg State University publishing house had released Parygin’s first monograph "Social Psychology as a Science", which became a bibliographical rarity. In 1967, a revised edition of the monograph (15,000 copies) was translated into Czech, Bulgarian and Spanish. 

From 1968 Parygin was at the head of the Philosophy Department of a [[Herzen University]]. There he created the laboratory of the social and psychologic studies and social psychology faculty which was the first one in the Soviet Union. Many first-rate scientists lectured there and books edited by Boris Parygin were published. 

In 1971, Parygin’s work titled ''The Basics of Socio-Psychological Theory'' was published (20,000 printed copies). In his book, Parygin presented the concept of the main social and psychological problems and first of all—the question of personality and human communication. This book drew a wide response in a scientific sphere of the Soviet Union and abroad. The monograph was republished in Germany (Cologne, 1975, Berlin, 1976) and in Japan (Tokyo, 1977).

At the meeting of [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (1972), however, Parygin was called a leader of international [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionism]] of [[Marxism]] because of his independent interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unlv.edu/centers/cdclv/archives/Interviews/parygin.html Parygin Interview&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206173745/http://www.unlv.edu/centers/cdclv/archives/Interviews/parygin.html |date=6 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he was accused of the intention to substitute Marxist philosophy by the Philosophy of Personality. Due to this, he had got a different job in a Social and Economic Problems Institute, where he organized and led the department of socio-psychologic problems of the labor collectives. The results of his work have found reflection in his books ''The Scientific-Technical Revolution and personality'' (1978),&lt;ref&gt;http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/415493?lookfor=author:%22Parygin,%20Boris%20Dmitrievich%22&amp;offset=2&amp;max=2 NLA catalogue&lt;/ref&gt; “Social and psychological climate of the collective” (1981),&lt;ref&gt;http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Search/Home?lookfor=author:%22Parygin,%20B.%20D.%20%28Boris%20Dmitrievich%29,%201930-%22&amp;iknowwhatimean=1 National Library of Austria&lt;/ref&gt; ''Social psychology of  territorial self-government'' (1993) and others.
Parygin was the head of the Research Committee of a Social Association, coordinated international researches within a [[Comecon]].

== Publications ==

He was the author of 10 prominent monographs and more than 400 articles, which were translated into many foreign languages (English, French, German, Spanish, Chinese, Portuguese, Bulgarian, Czech, Hungarian, Lithuanian, Lettish and others).

A chord is a function body that is associated with multiple function headers and cannot execute until all function headers are called.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://research.microsoft.com/Comega/doc/comega_whatis.htm | title=Cω Overview | accessdate=2008-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synchronicity ==
[[Cω]] defines two types of functions synchronous and asynchronous.  A synchronous function acts like a standard function in most Object-Oriented Language, upon invocation the function body is executed and a return value may or may not be returned to the caller.  An asynchronous function acts similar to a function that returns void except that it is guaranteed to return immediately with the execution being done in a separate thread.

'''Companion planting''' in gardening and agriculture is the planting of different crops in proximity for any of a number of different reasons, including  [[pest control]], [[pollination]], providing [[habitat]] for beneficial creatures, maximizing use of space, and to otherwise increase [[crop productivity]].&lt;ref name="mcclure"&gt;{{cite book |last=McClure |first=Susan |year=1994 |title=Companion Planting |publisher=Rodale Press |isbn=978-0-87596-616-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companion planting is a form of [[polyculture]].

Companion planting is used by farmers and gardeners in both industrialized and developing countries for many reasons. Many of the modern principles of companion planting were present many centuries ago in [[cottage garden]]s in England and [[forest garden]]s in Asia, and thousands of years ago in [[Mesoamerica]].

==History==
In China, [[Azolla|mosquito ferns]] (''Azolla'' spp.) have been used for at least a thousand years as companion plants for [[rice]] crops. They host a [[Cyanobacteria|cyanobacterium]] that fixes nitrogen from the atmosphere, and they block light from plants that would compete with the rice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhakai.com/botany/Keynote%20paper.pdf|title=Plant Resources for Human Development-Nitrogen in Rice|publisher=Dhakai.com|format=PDF|accessdate=February 21, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304231916/http://www.dhakai.com/botany/Keynote%20paper.pdf|archivedate=March 4, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companion planting was practiced in various forms by the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] prior to the arrival of Europeans. These peoples domesticated [[Cucurbita pepo|squash]] 8,000 to 10,000 years ago,&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;Smith, B. D. (1997). [http://fbae.org/2009/FBAE/website/images/PDF%20files/Imporatant%20Publication/1997%20Squash%20origin.pdf The initial domestication of ''Cucurbita pepo'' in the Americas 10,000 years ago.] ''Science'' 276 932-34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ucla"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanytextbooks/economicbotany/Cucurbita/|title=Cucurbitaceae--Fruits for Peons, Pilgrims, and Pharaohs|publisher=University of California at Los Angeles|accessdate=September 2, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016003715/http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanytextbooks/economicbotany/Cucurbita/|archivedate=October 16, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; then [[maize]], then [[Phaseolus vulgaris|common bean]]s, forming the [[Three Sisters (agriculture)|Three Sisters]] agricultural technique.

Companion planting was widely promoted in the 1970s as part of the [[Organic horticulture|organic gardening]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Companion Planting Guide |url=https://wheelbarrowexpert.com/companion-planting-guide/ |website=Mel's Garden |accessdate=12 July 2018|date=2018-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was encouraged for pragmatic reasons, such as natural [[Trellis (architecture)|trellising]], but mainly with the idea that [[List of companion plants|different species of plant]] may thrive more when close together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=7 Reasons For Companion Planting |url=http://www.gardenandgreenhouse.net/articles/september-2017/7-reasons-companion-planting/ |website=Garden &amp; Greenhouse |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a technique frequently used in [[permaculture]], together with [[mulch]]ing, [[polyculture]], and [[intercropping|changing of crops]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Companion Planting Guide |url=https://wheelbarrowexpert.com/companion-planting-guide/ |website=Mel's Garden |accessdate=12 July 2018|date=2018-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
{{See also|List of companion plants|List of beneficial weeds|List of pest-repelling plants}}
[[Nasturtium (popular name)|Nasturtium]] (''Tropaeolum majus'') is a food plant of some [[caterpillar]]s which feed primarily on members of the [[Brassicaceae|cabbage family]] (brassicas),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/advicesearch/profile.aspx?pid=457|publisher=Royal Horticultural Society|title=Cabbage caterpillars|accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some gardeners claim that planting them around brassicas protects the food crops from damage, as eggs of the pests are preferentially laid on the nasturtium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pleasant|first1=Barbara|title=ORGANIC PEST CONTROL WHAT WORKS, WHAT DOESN'T.|journal=Mother Earth News|date=June–July 2011|issue=246|page=36–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is called [[trap crop]]ping (using alternative plants to attract pests away from a main crop). However, while many trap crops have successfully diverted pests off of focal crops in small scale greenhouse, garden and field experiments, only a small portion of these plants have been shown to reduce pest damage at larger commercial scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holden|first=Matthew H.|last2=Ellner|first2=Stephen P.|last3=Lee|first3=Doo-Hyung|last4=Nyrop|first4=Jan P.|last5=Sanderson|first5=John P.|date=2012-06-01|title=Designing an effective trap cropping strategy: the effects of attraction, retention and plant spatial distribution|journal=Journal of Applied Ecology|language=en|volume=49|issue=3|pages=715–722|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02137.x|issn=1365-2664}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The smell of the foliage of [[Tagetes|marigold]]s is claimed to deter [[aphid]]s from feeding on neighbouring crops. Marigolds with simple flowers also attract nectar-feeding adult [[Hoverfly|hoverflies]], the larvae of which are predators of aphids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/organic-gardening/pest-control/hoverflies-organic-aphid-control-zw0z1301zkin|title=Attract Hoverflies for Organic Aphid Control}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Various [[legume]] crops benefit from being commingled with a grassy [[nurse crop]]. For example, [[common vetch]] or [[hairy vetch]] is planted together with [[rye]] or [[winter wheat]] to make a good [[cover crop]] or [[green manure]] (or both).

The terms "undersowing" and "overseeding" both involve [[intercropping]] as a type of companion planting. "Undersowing" conveys the idea of sowing the second crop among the young plants of the first crop (or in between the rows, if rows are used). A connotation of [[understory]] growth is conveyed, albeit exaggerated (because the first crop is not yet a dense [[canopy (biology)|canopy]]). "Overseeding" conveys the idea of broadcasting the seeds of the second crop over the existing first crop. This is analogous to overseeding a lawn to improve the mix of grasses present.

==Versions==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}
There are a number of systems and ideas using companion planting.

[[Square foot gardening]] attempts to protect plants from many normal gardening problems, such as weed infestation, by packing them as closely together as possible, which is facilitated by using companion plants, which can be closer together than normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bartholomew |first1=Mel |title=All New Square Foot Gardening |date=2013 |publisher=Cool Springs Press |isbn=978-1591865483 |edition=2nd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another system using companion planting is the [[Forest gardening|forest garden]], where companion plants are intermingled to create an actual ecosystem, emulating the interaction of up to seven levels of plants in a forest or [[woodland]].

[[Organic horticulture|Organic gardening]] may make use of companion planting, since many synthetic means of fertilizing, weed reduction and pest control are forbidden.

===Host-finding disruption===
Recent studies on host-plant finding have shown that flying pests are far less successful if their host-plants are surrounded by any other plant or even "decoy-plants" made of green plastic, cardboard, or any other green material.

The host-plant finding process occurs in phases:
* The first phase is stimulation by odours characteristic to the host-plant. This induces the insect to try to land on the plant it seeks. But insects avoid landing on brown (bare) soil. So if only the host-plant is present, the insects will quasi-systematically find it by simply landing on the only green thing around. This is called (from the point of view of the insect) "appropriate landing". When it does an "inappropriate landing", it flies off to any other nearby patch of green. It eventually leaves the area if there are too many 'inappropriate' landings.
* The second phase of host-plant finding is for the insect to make short flights from leaf to leaf to assess the plant's overall suitability. The number of leaf-to-leaf flights varies according to the insect species and to the host-plant stimulus received from each leaf. The insect must accumulate sufficient stimuli from the host-plant to lay eggs; so it must make a certain number of consecutive 'appropriate' landings. Hence if it makes an 'inappropriate landing', the assessment of that plant is negative, and the insect must start the process anew.

Thus it was shown that [[clover]] used as a ground cover had the same disruptive effect on eight pest species from four different insect orders. An experiment showed that 36% of cabbage root flies laid eggs beside cabbages growing in bare soil (which resulted in no crop), compared to only 7% beside cabbages growing in clover (which allowed a good crop). Simple decoys made of green cardboard also disrupted appropriate landings just as well as did the live ground cover.&lt;ref name="warwick"/&gt;

==Companion plant categories==
The use of companion planting can be of benefit to the grower in a number of different ways, including:
* '''Hedged investment'''{{spaced ndash}} the growing of different crops in the same space increases the odds of some yield being given, even if one crop fails.
* '''Increased level interaction'''{{spaced ndash}} when crops are grown on different levels in the same space, such as providing ground cover or one crop working as a trellis for another, the overall yield of a plot may be increased. 
* '''Protective shelter''' is when one type of plant may serve as a [[wind break]] or provide shade for another.
* '''Pest suppression'''{{spaced ndash}} some companion plants may help prevent pest insects or pathogenic [[fungi]] from damaging the crop, through chemical means.&lt;ref name="theselfsufficientgardener1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theselfsufficientgardener.com/episode-24-companion-planting-and-crop-rotation/| title=The Self-Sufficient Gardener Podcast--Episode 24 Companion Planting and Crop Rotation|date=|accessdate= 2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Predator recruitment''' and '''positive hosting'''{{spaced ndash}} The use of companion plants that produce copious nectar or [[pollen]] in a vegetable garden ([[insectary plants]]) may help encourage higher populations of beneficial insects that control pests,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oregonstate.edu/dept/nurspest/Insectary_plants.htm|title=Pacific Northwest Nursery IPM. Flowers, Sweets and a Nice Place to Stay: Courting Beneficials to Your Nursery|publisher=Oregon State University|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as some beneficial predatory insects only consume pests in their larval form and are nectar or pollen feeders in their adult form.
* '''[[Trap crop]]ping'''{{spaced ndash}} some companion plants are claimed to attract pests away from others.
* '''Pattern disruption'''{{spaced ndash}} in a [[monoculture]] pests spread easily from one crop plant to the next, whereas such easy progress may be disrupted by surrounding companion plants of a different type.&lt;ref name="warwick"&gt;[http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/lifesci/wcc/research/pests/companionplanting/biologist_jun03.pdf Horticulture Research International, Wellesbourne : "Insects can see clearly now the weeds have gone".

'''Compartmental modelling of dendrites''' deals with [[multi-compartment model]]ling of the [[dendrite]]s, to make the understanding of the electrical behavior of complex dendrites easier. Basically, compartmental modelling of dendrites is a very helpful tool to develop new [[biological neuron model]]s. Dendrites are very important because they occupy the most membrane area in many of the neurons and give the neuron an ability to connect to thousands of other cells. Originally the dendrites were thought to have constant [[Electrical conductance|conductance]] and [[Electric current|current]] but now it has been understood that they may have active [[Voltage-gated ion channel]]s, which influences the firing properties of the neuron and also the response of [[neuron]] to [[Synapse|synaptic]] inputs.&lt;ref name="Mathematical foundations of neuroscience"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ermentrout|first=Bard|title=Mathematical Foundations of Neuroscience|year=2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-87707-5|pages=29–45|author2=Terman H. David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many mathematical models have been developed to understand the electric behavior of the dendrites. Dendrites tend to be very branchy and complex, so the compartmental approach to understand the electrical behavior of the dendrites makes it very useful.
&lt;ref name="Mathematical foundations of neuroscience" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lindsay"&gt;Lindsay, A. E., Lindsay, K. A., &amp; Rosenberg, J. R. (2005). Increased computational accuracy in multi-compartmental cable models by a novel approach for precise point process localization. Journal of Computational Neuroscience, 19(1), 21–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
* Compartmental modelling is a very natural way of modelling dynamical systems that have certain inherent properties with conservation principles. The compartmental modelling is an elegant way, a state space formulation to elegantly capture the dynamical systems that are governed by the conservation laws. Whether it is the conservation of mass, energy, fluid flow or information flow. Basically, they are models whose [[state variables]] tend to be [[non-negative]] (such as mass, concentrations, energy). So the equations for mass balance, energy, concentration or fluid flow can be written. It ultimately goes down to networks in which the brain is the largest of them all, just like [[Avogadro number]], very large amount of molecules that are interconnected. The brain has very interesting interconnections. On a microscopic level [[thermodynamics]] is virtually impossible to understand but from a [[macroscopic]] view we see that these follow some universal laws. In the same way brain has numerous interconnections, which is almost impossible to write a [[differential equation]] for. (These words were said in an interview by [http://soliton.ae.gatech.edu/people/whaddad/ Dr. Wassim Haddad] )
* General observations about how the brain functions can be made by looking at the first and second [[thermodynamic laws]], which are universal laws. [[Brain]] is a very large-scale interconnected system; the [[neurons]] have to somehow behave like the chemical reaction system, so, it has to somehow obey the chemical thermodynamic laws. This approach may lead to more generalized model of brain. (These words were said in an interview by [http://soliton.ae.gatech.edu/people/whaddad/ Dr. Wassim Haddad] )

==Multiple compartments ==
[[File:Dendrites Modelling.jpg|thumb|a) Branched dendrites viewed as cylinders for modelling. b) Simple model with three compartments]]

* Complicated dendritic structures can be treated as multiple compartments interconnected. The dendrites are divided into small compartments and they are linked together as shown in the figure.&lt;ref name="Mathematical foundations of neuroscience" /&gt;
* It is assumed that the compartment is isopotential and spatially uniform in its properties. Membrane non-uniformity such as diameter changes, and voltage differences are occurred in between the compartments but not inside them.&lt;ref name="Mathematical foundations of neuroscience" /&gt;
* An example of a simple two-compartment model:
Consider a two-compartmental model with the compartments viewed as isopotential cylinders with radius &lt;math&gt; a_i &lt;/math&gt; and length &lt;math&gt; L_i &lt;/math&gt;. 
:&lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt; is the membrane potential of ith compartment.
:&lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; is the specific membrane capacitance.
:&lt;math&gt;r_{Mi}&lt;/math&gt; is the specific membrane resistivity.
:The total electrode current, assuming that the compartment has it, is given by &lt;math&gt;I^i_{electrode}&lt;/math&gt;.
:The longitudinal resistance is given by &lt;math&gt;r_L&lt;/math&gt;.
:Now according to the balance that should exist for each compartment, we can say
:  &lt;math&gt;  i^i_{cap} + i^i_{ion} = i^i_{long} + i^i_{electrode}&lt;/math&gt;.....eq(1)
: Where &lt;math&gt; i^i_{cap}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; i^i_{ion}&lt;/math&gt; are the capacitive and ionic currents per unit area of ith compartment membrane. i.e. they can be given by
: &lt;math&gt; i^i_{cap} = c_i \frac{dV_i}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; i^i_{ion} = \frac{V_i}{r_{Mi}}&lt;/math&gt;.....eq(2)
: If we assume the resting potential is 0. Then to compute &lt;math&gt;i^i_{long}&lt;/math&gt;, we need total axial resistance. As the compartments are simply cylinders we can say
: &lt;math&gt;R_{long} = \frac{r_LL_1}{2 \pi a_1^2} + \frac{r_LL_2}{2 \pi a_2^2}&lt;/math&gt;.....eq(3)
: Using ohms law we can express current from ith to jth compartment as
: &lt;math&gt; i^1_{long} = g_{1,2}(V_2-V_1) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; i^2_{long} = g_{2,1}(V_1-V_2) &lt;/math&gt; .....eq(4)
: The coupling terms &lt;math&gt; g_{1,2} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; g_{2,1} &lt;/math&gt; are obtained by inverting eq(3) and dividing by surface area of interest.
: So we get,
: &lt;math&gt;g_{1,2} = \frac{a_1a_2^2}{r_LL_1(a_2^2L_1+a_1^2L_2)} &lt;/math&gt;
: and
: &lt;math&gt;g_{2,1} = \frac{a_2a_1^2}{r_LL_1(a_1^2L_2+a_2^2L_1)} &lt;/math&gt;
: Finally, &lt;math&gt; i_{electrode}^I = \frac {I_{electrode}^i}{A_i}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; A_i = 2 \pi a_iL_i &lt;/math&gt; is the surface area of the compartment i.
: If we put all these together we get
: &lt;math&gt; c_1 \frac{dV_1}{dt} + \frac{V_1}{r_{M1}} = g_{1,2}(V_2 - V_1) + \frac {I_{electrode}^1}{A_1}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; c_2 \frac{dV_2}{dt} + \frac{V_2}{r_{M2}} = g_{2,1}(V_1 - V_2) + \frac {I_{electrode}^2}{A_2}&lt;/math&gt;.....eq(5)
: If we use &lt;math&gt; r_1 = 1/g_{1,2} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; r_2 = 1/g_{2,1} &lt;/math&gt; then eq(5) will become
: &lt;math&gt; c_1 \frac{dV_1}{dt} + \frac{V_1}{r_{M1}} = \frac {V_2 - V_1}{r_1} + \frac {I_{electrode}^1}{A_1}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; c_2 \frac{dV_2}{dt} + \frac{V_2}{r_{M2}} = \frac {V_1 - V_2}{r_2}  + \frac {I_{electrode}^2}{A_2}&lt;/math&gt;.....eq(6)

: Now if we inject current in cell 1 only and each cylinder is identical then &lt;math&gt; r_1 = r_2 \equiv r &lt;/math&gt;
: Without loss in generality we can define &lt;math&gt; r_M = r_{M1} = r_{M2} &lt;/math&gt;
:After some algebra we can show that
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{V_1}{i_1} = \frac {r_M(r+r_M)}{r+2r_M} &lt;/math&gt;
: also
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{R_{input,coupled}}{R_{input,uncoupled}} = 1- \frac{r_M}{r+2r_M} &lt;/math&gt;
: i.e. the input resistance decreases. For increment in the potential, coupled system current should be greater than that is required for uncoupled system. This is because the second compartment drains some current.
: Now, we can get a general compartmental model for a treelike structure and the equations are
: &lt;math&gt; C_j \frac{dV_j}{dt} = - \frac{V_j}{R_j} + \sum_{k connected j}{} \frac{V_k - V_j}{R_{jk}}+I_j &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="Mathematical foundations of neuroscience" /&gt;

===Increased computational accuracy in multi-compartmental cable models===

* Input at the center
Each dendridic section is subdivided into segments, which are typically seen as uniform circular cylinders or tapered circular cylinders. In the traditional compartmental model, point process location is determined only to an accuracy of half segment length. This will make the model solution particularly sensitive to segment boundaries. The accuracy of the traditional approach for this reason is [[Big O notation|O]](1/n) when a point current and synaptic input is present. Usually the trans-membrane current where the membrane potential is known is represented in the model at points, or nodes and is assumed to be at the center. The new approach partitions the effect of the input by distributing it to the boundaries of the segment. Hence any input is partitioned between the nodes at the proximal and distal boundaries of the segment. Therefore, this procedure makes sure that the solution obtained is not sensitive to small changes in location of these boundaries because it affects how the input is partitioned between the nodes. When these compartments are connected with continuous potentials and conservation of current at segment boundaries then a new compartmental model of a new mathematical form is obtained. This new approach also provides a model identical to the traditional model but an order more accurate. This model increases the accuracy and precision by an order of magnitude than that is achieved by point process input.&lt;ref name=Lindsay /&gt;

==Cable Theory==
{{Main|Cable theory}}
Dendrites and axons are considered to be continuous (cable-like), rather than series of compartments.&lt;ref name="Mathematical foundations of neuroscience" /&gt;

==Some applications==

=== Information processing ===

* A theoretical framework along with a technological platform are provided by [[computational model]]s to enhance the understanding of [[nervous system]] functions. There was a lot of advancement in the [[molecular]] and [[biophysical]] mechanisms underlying the neuronal activity. The same kind of advances have to be made in understanding the structure-functional relationship and rules followed by the information processing.&lt;ref name = "Information Processing"&gt;Poirazi, P. (2009). Information Processing in Single Cells and Small Networks: Insights from Compartmental Models. In G. Maroulis &amp; T. E. Simos (Eds.), Computational Methods in Science and Engineering, Vol 1 (Vol. 1108, pp. 158–167).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Previously a neuron used to be thought as a transistor. However, it is shown recently that morphology and ionic composition of different neurons provide the cell with enhanced computational capabilities. These abilities are far more advanced than those captured by a point neuron.&lt;ref name="Information Processing" /&gt;
* Some findings:
** Different outputs given by the individual apical [[oblique dendrite]]s of [http://www-lnc.usc.edu/CA1-pyramidal-cell-model/ CA1 pyramidal neurons] are linearly combined in the cell body. The outputs that come from these dendrites actually behave like individual computational units that use [[sigmoid function|sigmoidal]] activation function to combine inputs.&lt;ref name="Information Processing" /&gt;
** The thin dendritic branches each act as a typical point neuron, which are capable of combining the incoming signals according to the [[Threshold potential|threshold]]ing [[non-linearity]].&lt;ref name="Information Processing" /&gt;
** Considering the accuracy in prediction of different input patterns by a two-layer [[artificial neural network|neural network]], it is assumed that a simple mathematical equation can be used to describe the model. This allows the development of network models in which each neuron, instead of being modelled as a full blown compartmental cell, it is modelled as a simplified two layer neural network.&lt;ref name="Information Processing" /&gt;
** The firing pattern of the cell might contain the temporal information about incoming signals. For example, the delay between the two simulated pathways.&lt;ref name="Information Processing" /&gt;
** Single CA1 has a capability of encoding and transmitting spatio-temporal information on the incoming signals to the recipient cell.&lt;ref name="Information Processing" /&gt;
** Calcium-activated nonspecific cationic ([[Calcium-activated nonspecific cationic|CAN]]) mechanism is needed for giving constant activity and the synaptic [[stimulation]] alone does not induce persistent activity using the increasing conductance of [[NMDA]] mechanism. NMDA/ [[AMPA]] positively expands the range of persistent activity and negatively regulates the amount of CAN needed for constant activity.&lt;ref name="Information Processing" /&gt;

=== Midbrain dopaminergic neuron===

* [[:wikt:movement|Movement]], [[motivation]], [[attention]], neurological and [[psychiatric disorders]] and addictive behavior have a strong influence by [[Dopaminergic]] signalling.&lt;ref name = "Midbrain neuron"&gt;Kuznetsova, A. Y., Huertas, M. A., Kuznetsov, A. S., Paladini, C. A., &amp; Canavier, C. C. (2010). Regulation of firing frequency in a computational model of a midbrain dopaminergic neuron. Journal of Computational Neuroscience, 28(3), 389–403.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The dopaminergic neurons have a low irregular basal firing frequency in 1–8&amp;nbsp;Hz range ''in vivo'' in the [[ventral tegmental area]] (VTA) and [[substantia nigra pars compacta]] (SNc). This frequencies can dramatically increase in response to a cue predicting reward or unpredicted reward. The actions that preceded the reward are reinforced by this burst or phasic signal.&lt;ref name="Midbrain neuron" /&gt;
* The low safety factor for action potential generation gives a result of low maximal steady frequencies. The transient initial frequency in response to depolarizing pulse is controlled by rate of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; accumulation in distal dendrites.&lt;ref name="Midbrain neuron" /&gt;
* Results obtained from a mulch-compartmental model realistic with reconstructed morphology were similar. So, the salient contributions of the dendritic architecture have been captures by simpler model.&lt;ref name="Midbrain neuron" /&gt;

===Mode locking ===

* There are many important applications in neuroscience for [[Mode-locking]] response of excitable systems to periodic forcing. For example, The theta rhythm drives the spatially extended place cells in the [[hippocampus]] to generate a code giving information about spatial location. The role of neuronal dentrites in generating the response to periodic current injection can be explored by using a compartmental model (with linear dynamics for each compartment) coupled to an active soma model that generates action potentials.&lt;ref name = "Mode Locking"&gt;Svensson, C. M., &amp; Coombes, S. (2009). MODE LOCKING IN A SPATIALLY EXTENDED NEURON MODEL: ACTIVE SOMA AND COMPARTMENTAL TREE. International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos, 19(8), 2597–2607.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some findings:
** The response of whole neuron model i.e. soma and dendrites, can be written in closed form. The response of the spatially extended model to periodic forcing is described by [[Poincaré map|stroboscopic map]]. A [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ArnoldTongue.html Arnol'd tongue] [[quasi-active]] model can be constructed with a [[linear stability]] [[analysis]] of the map with carefully treating the non-[[differentiability]] of [[soma (biology)|soma]] model.&lt;ref name="Mode Locking" /&gt;
** The shape of the tongues is influenced by the presence of the quasi-active membrane.&lt;ref name="Mode Locking" /&gt;
** The windows in parameter space for chaotic behavior can be enlarged with the resonant dendritic membrane.&lt;ref name="Mode Locking" /&gt;
** The response of the spatially extended neuron model to global forcing is different from that of point forcing.&lt;ref name="Mode Locking" /&gt;

===Compartmental neural simulations with spatial adaptivity===

* The computational cost of the method scales not with the physical size of the system being simulated but with the amount of activity present in the simulation. Spatial adaptivity for certain problems reduces up to 80%.&lt;ref name = "Compartmental neural simulations"&gt;Rempe, M. J., Spruston, N., Kath, W. L., &amp; Chopp, D. L. (2008). Compartmental neural simulations with spatial adaptivity. Journal of Computational Neuroscience, 25(3), 465–480.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Action potential (AP) initiation site===
* Establishing a unique site for AP initiation at the axon initial segment is no longer accepted. The APs can be initiated and comdected by different sub-regions of the neuron morphology, which widened the capabilities of individual neurons in computation.&lt;ref name = "axosomatodendritic"&gt;Ibarz, J. M., &amp; Herreras, O. (2003). A study of the action potential initiation site along the axosomatodendritic axis of neurons using compartmental models. In J. Mira &amp; J. R. Alvarez (Eds.), Computational Methods in Neural Modeling, Pt 1 (Vol. 2686, pp. 9–15).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Findings from a study of the Action Potential Initiation Site Along the Axosomatodendritic Axis of Neurons Using Compartmental Models:
** Dendritic APs are initiated  more effectively by synchronous spatially clustered inputs than equivalent disperse inputs.&lt;ref name=axosomatodendritic /&gt;
** The initiation site can also be determined by the average electrical distance from the dendritic input to the axon trigger zone, but it may be strongly modulated by the relative excitability of the two trigger zones and a number of factors.&lt;ref name=axosomatodendritic /&gt;

===A finite-state automaton model===

* Multi-neuron simulations with finite state automation model is capable of modelling the most important characteristics of neural membranes.&lt;ref name = "finite State"&gt;Schilstra, M., Rust, A., Adams, R., &amp; Bolouri, H. (2002). A finite state automaton model for multi-neuron simulations. Neurocomputing, 44, 1141–1148.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multi-compartmental model of a CA1 pyramidal cell===

* To study changes in hippocampal excitability that result from aging-induced alterations in calcium-dependent membrane mechanisms, the multi-compartmental model of CA1 pyramidal cell can be used. We can model the aging-induced alterations in CA1 excitability can be  with simple coupling mechanisms that selectively link specific types of calcium channels to specific calcium-dependent potassium channels.&lt;ref name = "CA1 pyramidal cell"&gt;Markaki, M., Orphanoudakis, S., &amp; Poirazi, P. (2005). Modelling reduced excitability in aged CA1 neurons as a calcium-dependent process. Neurocomputing, 65, 305–314.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrical compartmentalization===

* Spine Neck Plasticity Controls Postsynaptic Calcium Signals through Electrical Compartmentalization. The spine neck plasticity through a process of electrical compartmentalization can dynamically regulate Calcium influx into spines (a key trigger for synaptic plasticity).&lt;ref name = "Electrical Compartmentalization"&gt;Grunditz, A., Holbro, N., Tian, L., Zuo, Y., &amp; Oertner, T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2114">A '''contrast set''' is a bounded collection of items, each of which could fill the same slot in a given [[Schema (psychology)|schema]], syntactic structure, or other linguistic environment. The seven days of the week, the fifty United States, the eight Hawaiian islands, the letters in the alphabet, the categories "male" and "female," the students in a class, or the flavors on offer at an ice cream store are all examples of contrast sets.

Contrast sets may be relatively natural in origin (such as the eight Hawaiian islands) or relatively conventional (such as the fifty United States). The mastery of certain conventional contrast sets is essential to basic socialization: for example, calendrical units, [[musical notes]], and elements of writing systems like [[Numeral system|numerals]] and the [[alphabet]]. These contrast sets frequently become the subject of [[synesthesia]]s.

[[Linguistic anthropology|Linguistic anthropologists]] [[Harold Conklin]] and [[Charles Frake]] were the first to work out the concept of the contrast set in the 1950s, and the concept was described in detail in Frake's article "The ethnographic study of cognitive systems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Charles O. |last=Frake |chapter=The Ethnographic Study of Cognitive Systems |pages=28–41 |title=Cognitive Anthropology |editor-first=Stephen |editor-last=Tyler |location=New York |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |year=1969 |isbn=0-03-073255-7 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=W6aAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tihanyi The Critic.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''Critic'' by [[Lajos Tihanyi]]. Oil on canvas, c.1916.]]

A '''critic''' is a professional who communicates an assessment and an opinion of various forms of creative works such as art, literature, music, cinema, theater, fashion, architecture, and food. Critics may also take as their subject social or government policy. Critical judgments, whether derived from [[critical thinking]] or not, weigh up a range of factors, including an assessment of the extent to which the item under review achieves its purpose and its creator's intention and a knowledge of its context. They may also include a positive or negative personal response.

Characteristics of a good critic are articulateness, preferably having the ability to use language with a high level of appeal and skill. Sympathy, sensitivity and insight are important too. Form, style and medium are all considered by the critic. In architecture and food criticism, the item's function, value and cost may be added components.

Critics are publicly accepted and, to a significant degree, followed because of the quality of their assessments or their reputation. Influential critics of art, music, theatre and architecture often present their arguments in complete books. One very famous example is [[John Ruskin]]'s ''[[Seven Lamps of Architecture]]'' and ''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]''. Critics may base their assessment on a range of theoretical positions. For instance, they may take a Feminist or Freudian perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdP2BgxsM3wC|title=The Feminist Spectator as Critic|last=Dolan|first=Jill|date=2012-10-24|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0472035193|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other individuals who may editorialize on subjects via websites or letters written to publications, professional critics are paid to produce their assessment and opinions for print, radio, magazine, television, or Internet companies. When their personal opinion outweighs considered judgment, people who give opinions, whether on current events, public affairs, sports, media or art are often referred to as "[[pundits]]" instead of critics.

Critics are themselves subject to competing critics, since the final critical judgment always entails some [[subjectivity]]. An established critic can play a powerful role as a public [[arbitration|arbiter]] of taste or opinion. Also, critics or a coordinated group of critics, may award symbols of recognition.

== Derivation ==

The word "critic" comes {{ety|gre|''κριτικός'' (kritikós)|able to discern}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkritiko%2Fs Greek-English Lexicon, at Perseus], ''Kritikos'', Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott.&lt;/ref&gt; which is a Greek derivation of the word {{lang|grc|κριτής}} ''(krités)'', meaning a person who offers reasoned judgment or analysis, value judgment, interpretation or observation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkrith%2Fs Greek-English Lexicon, at Perseus], ''Krites'', Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott.&lt;/ref&gt; Early English meaning of criticism was based mainly on the criticism of literature and it was in the 17th century that more general forms of criticism began.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

== Critics' views of criticism ==

Cultural critic [[Clement Greenberg]] wrote that a good critic excels through "insights into the evidence … and by … loyalty to the relevant"; poet and critic [[T. S. Eliot|T.S. Eliot]] wrote "a critic must have a very highly developed sense of fact".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Art and Culture – Critical Essays|last = Greenberg|first = Clement|publisher = Beacon Press|year = 1961|isbn = |location = Boston|page = 239|chapter = T.S. Eliot: A Book Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, [[Harold C. Schonberg]], chief music critic of ''[[The New York Times]]'' from 1960 to 1980, said that he wrote for himself, &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;not necessarily for readers, not for musicians. ...It's not a critic's job to be right or wrong; it's his job to express an opinion in readable English.&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/27/nyregion/harold-c-schonberg-87-dies-won-pulitzer-prize-as-music-critic-for-the-times.html|title=Harold C. Schonberg, 87, Dies; Won Pulitzer Prize as Music Critic for ''The Times''|last=Kozinn|first=Allan|date=2003-07-27|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schonberg was the first music critic to receive the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for [[criticism]].

[[Daniel Mendelsohn]] described the equation of criticism for critics as [[knowledge]] + [[Taste (sociology)|taste]] = meaningful [[judgement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/a-critics-manifesto|title=A Critic’s Manifesto|last=Mendelsohn|first=Daniel|date=2012-08-28|newspaper=The New Yorker|issn=0028-792X|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/everyones-a-critic-1455147994|title=Everyone’s a Critic|last=Spiegelman|first=Willard|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Restaurant critic Terry Durack explained that from a critic "you hope for a thorough, objective and legitimate discussion" that puts "opera, art or book into context, so that it adds to your own body of knowledge"; in the context of a restaurant criticism, this means it is "not about me liking it or not; it's about me helping you decide whether you are going to like it or not."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/good-weekend/the-role-of-a-restaurant-critic-in-the-digital-age-20161201-gt1ndf.html|title=The role of a restaurant critic in the digital age|last=Durack|first=Terry|date=3 December 2016|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=5 December 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotebox|quote=''Rothko's dilemma was that he wanted to employ the vocabulary of symbolism{{snds}}the palpitating indeterminate space, the excruciatingly refined colour, the obsession with nuance, the presence of Mallarmé's "negated object"{{snds}}to render the patriarchal despair and elevation of the Old Testament. Criticism doesn't get sharper, or more sensitive, or more deeply sympathetic to the object, than that.''

== Social and political critics ==

Social and political critics have used various forms of art to express their criticism, including literature and music. [[Pierre Beaumarchais]], for example, prior to the [[French Revolution]], used his play [[The Marriage of Figaro (play)|''The Marriage of Figaro'']] to denounce aristocratic privilege. A critic's influence is enhanced by subsequent reworkings such as the operatic versions of Beaumarchais's play (''[[The Barber of Seville]]'') by [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] and (''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'') by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]. Among the most famous social/political criticism in literary form are [[Jonathan Swift|Jonathan Swift's]] [[satire]] ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and [[George Orwell]]'s satire ''[[Animal Farm]]''. Some political critics, such as [[Ai Weiwei]] use visual art as their medium. Throughout history, political critics have faced higher risks, including the risk of imprisonment or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/hrw-calls-for-release-of-thai-government-critic/3238970.html|title=HRW Calls for Release of Thai Government Critic|website=VOA|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.africanews.com/2016/03/21/zambian-opposition-leader-arrested-for-defaming-president-lungu/|title=Zambian opposition leader arrested for ‘defaming’ President Lungu|website=africanews.channel|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/pakistanis-throng-for-funeral-of-man-hanged-for-killing-critic-of-blasphemy-laws-1456855688|title=Pakistanis Throng Funeral of Man Hanged for Killing Critic of Blasphemy Laws|last=Shah|first=Saeed|last2=Nauman|first2=Qasim|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-nemtsov-idUSKCN0W00M4|title=Thousands march in Moscow to honor slain Kremlin critic Nemtsov|date=2016-02-28|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/beijing-critic-family-detained-china-internet-crackdown/3256261.html|title=Beijing Critic Says Family Detained in China in Internet Crackdown|website=VOA|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Online critics ==

Several websites have developed for the purpose of compiling or publishing original critical reviews. Examples include ''[[Blogcritics|BlogCritics Magazine]]'', [[Rotten Tomatoes]], and [[Yelp]]. According to [[A. O. Scott]], chief film critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'', everyone on the Internet is a critic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/sunday-review/everybodys-a-critic-and-thats-how-it-should-be.html|title=Everybody’s a Critic.

== Responses to critics ==

People whose work is the subject of criticism have a full range of responses to it. For example, they may be appreciative, offended, distressed, encouraged, amused or nonplussed.
{{Quotebox|quote=''We do not object to criticism; and we do not expect that the critic will read the book before writing a notice of it. We do not even expect the reviewer of the book will say that he has not read it. No we have no anticipations of anything unusual in this age of criticism.''|source=[[Satire|Satirical]] comment about potential criticism by [[Mark Twain]] and [[Charles Dudley Warner]] in their Preface to the American Edition of their co-authored novel ''[[The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today]]''.&lt;ref name="SLC&amp;CDW"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner|title=The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today|date=1903|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus|page=ix|chapter=Preface to the American edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cyber Storm exercise''' was a [[simulated]] exercise overseen by the [[Department of Homeland Security]] that took place February 6 through February 10, 2006 with the purpose of testing the nation's defenses against [[Hacker (computer security)|digital espionage]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dhs.gov/xnews/releases/pr_1158340980371.shtm Fact Sheet: Cyber Storm Exercise] ([[Department of Homeland Security]]). Accessed February 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/prep_cyberstormreport_sep06.pdf Cyber Storm Exercise Report] (Department of Homeland Security)&lt;/ref&gt; The simulation was targeted primarily at American security organizations but officials from the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand participated as well.&lt;ref&gt;Kapica, Jack.

== Simulation ==
The exercise simulated a large scale attack on critical digital infrastructure such as [[communications]], [[transportation]], and [[energy production]]. The simulation took place a series of incidents which included:

*[[Washington, D.C. Metro]] trains mysteriously shutting down.
*[[Bloggers]] revealing locations of railcars containing hazardous materials.
*The [[Control tower|airport control towers]] of [[Philadelphia]] and Chicago mysteriously shutting down.
*A mysterious liquid appearing on a London subway.
*Significant numbers of people on [[No Fly List|"no fly" lists]] suddenly appearing at airports all over the nation.
*Planes flying too close to the [[White House]].
*Water utilities in Los Angeles getting compromised.

== Internal difficulties ==
During the exercise the computers running the simulation came under attack by the players themselves. Heavily censored files released to the [[Associated Press]] reveal that at some time during the exercise the organizers sent every one involved an [[e-mail]] marked "IMPORTANT!" telling the participants in the simulation not to attack the game's control computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cybertalkblog.co.uk/cyber-news-blog/cyber-war-games-highlight-vital-security-flaws/|title=Cyber ‘War’ Games Highlight Vital Security Flaws|website=www.cybertalkblog.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Performance of participants ==
The Cyber Storm exercise highlighted the gaps and shortcomings of the nation's cyber defenses. The cyber storm exercise report found that institutions under attack had a hard time getting the bigger picture and instead focused on single incidents treating them as "individual and discrete".&lt;ref&gt;Wait, Patience.

A '''domatium''' (plural: '''domatia''', from the Latin "domus", meaning home) is a tiny chamber produced by plants that houses arthropods.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last=O'Dowd |first=Dennis J. |author2=Mary F. Willson |date=June 1991 |title=Associations Between Mites and Leaf Domatia |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=179–182 |doi=10.1016/0169-5347(91)90209-G}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ideally domatia differ from [[gall]]s in that they are produced by the plant rather than being induced by their inhabitants, but the distinction is not sharp; the development of many types of domatia is influenced and promoted by the inhabitants. Most domatia are inhabited either by [[mites]] or [[ants]], in what can be a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualist]] relationship, but other arthropods such as [[thrips]] may take parasitic advantage of the protection offered by this structure. 

Domatia occupied by ants are called '''myrmecodomatia'''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Edward O., The Insect Societies,  Publisher: Belknap Press 1971, {{ISBN|978-0-674-45490-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important class of myrmecodomatia comprise large, hollow spines of certain acacias such as ''[[Acacia sphaerocephala]]'', in which ants of the genera ''[[Pseudomyrmex]]'' and ''[[Tetraponera]]'' make their nests. Plants that provide myrmecodomatia are called '''[[myrmecophyte]]s'''. The variety of the plants that provide myrmecodomatia, and the ranges of forms of such domatia are considerable. Some plants, such as ''[[Myrmecodia]]'', grow large bulbous structures riddled with channels in which their ants may establish themselves, both for mutual protection and for the nutritive benefit of the ants' wastes.

Often domatia are formed on the lower surface of leaves, at the juncture of the midrib and the veins.  They usually consist of small depressions partly enclosed by leaf tissue or hairs.  Many members of the [[Lauraceae]] family develop leaf domatia.  Domatia are also found in some rainforest tree species in the families [[Alangiaceae]], [[Elaeocarpaceae]], [[Fabaceae]], [[Icacinaceae]], [[Meliaceae]], [[Rubiaceae]], [[Sapindaceae]] and [[Simaroubaceae]].&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Drake equation''' is a [[probability theory|probabilistic argument]] used to estimate the number of active, communicative [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial civilizations]] in the [[Milky Way]] [[galaxy]].&lt;ref name="Burchell"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Glade |first1=N. |last2=Ballet |first2=P. |last3=Bastien |first3=O. |date=2012 |title=A stochastic process approach of the drake equation parameters |journal=[[International Journal of Astrobiology]] |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=103–108 |arxiv=1112.1506 |bibcode=2012IJAsB..11..103G |doi=10.1017/S1473550411000413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The equation was written in 1961 by [[Frank Drake]], not for purposes of quantifying the number of civilizations, but as a way to stimulate scientific dialogue at the first scientific meeting on the [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI).&lt;ref name='December 2002'&gt;{{cite web |date=December 2002 |title=Chapter 3 — Philosophy: "Solving the Drake Equation |url=http://www.setileague.org/askdr/drake.htm |work=Ask Dr. SETI |publisher=SETI League  |accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Drake |first=N. |date=30 June 2014 |title=How my Dad's Equation Sparked the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/06/140630-drake-equation-50-years-later-aliens-science/ |work=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equation summarizes the main concepts which scientists must contemplate when considering the question of other radio-communicative life.&lt;ref name='December 2002'/&gt;  It is more properly thought of as a [[Fermi problem]] rather than as a serious attempt to nail down a precise number.

Criticism related to the Drake equation focuses not on the equation itself, but on the fact that the estimated values for several of its factors are highly conjectural, the combined effect being that the uncertainty associated with any derived value is so large that the equation cannot be used to draw firm conclusions.

==Equation==
The Drake equation is:

:&lt;math&gt;N = R_* \cdot f_\mathrm{p} \cdot n_\mathrm{e} \cdot f_\mathrm{l} \cdot f_\mathrm{i} \cdot f_\mathrm{c} \cdot L&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:{{math|''N''}} = the number of [[civilization]]s in our galaxy with which communication might be possible (i.e. which are on our current past [[light cone]]);

and

:{{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;}} = the average rate of [[star formation]] in [[Milky Way|our galaxy]]
:{{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}} = the fraction of those stars that have [[planet]]s
:{{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}} = the average number of planets that can potentially support [[life]] per star that has planets
:{{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;}} = the fraction of planets that could support life that actually develop life at some point
:{{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} = the fraction of planets with life that actually go on to develop [[intelligence|intelligent]] life (civilizations)
:{{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}} = the fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that releases detectable signs of their existence into space
:{{math|''L''}} = the length of time for which such civilizations release detectable signals into space&lt;ref name="NOVA"&gt;

==History==
In September 1959, physicists [[Giuseppe Cocconi]] and [[Philip Morrison]] published an article in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' with the provocative title "Searching for Interstellar Communications".&lt;ref name='Cocconi 1959'&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cocconi and Morrison argued that [[radio telescope]]s had become sensitive enough to pick up transmissions that might be broadcast into space by civilizations orbiting other stars. Such messages, they suggested, might be transmitted at a [[wavelength]] of 21&amp;nbsp;cm (1,420.4&amp;nbsp;[[megahertz|MHz]]). This is the wavelength of radio emission by neutral [[hydrogen]], the most common element in the universe, and they reasoned that other intelligences might see this as a logical landmark in the [[radio spectrum]].

Two months later, Harvard University astronomy professor [[Harlow Shapley]] speculated on the number of inhabited planets in the universe, saying "The universe has 10 million, million, million suns (10 followed by 18 zeros) similar to our own. One in a million has planets around it. Only one in a million million has the right combination of chemicals, temperature, water, days and nights to support planetary life as we know it. This calculation arrives at the estimated figure of 100 million worlds where life has been forged by evolution."&lt;ref name="SydneyMorningHerald"&gt;

Seven months after Cocconi and Morrison published their article, Drake made the first systematic search for signals from communicative extraterrestrial civilizations. Using the 25&amp;nbsp;m dish of the [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]] in [[Green Bank, West Virginia]], Drake monitored two nearby Sun-like stars: [[Epsilon Eridani]] and [[Tau Ceti]]. In this project, which he called [[Project Ozma]], he slowly scanned frequencies close to the 21&amp;nbsp;cm wavelength for six hours per day from April to July 1960.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; The project was well designed, inexpensive, and simple by today's standards. It detected no signals.

Soon thereafter, Drake hosted a "[[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]]" meeting on detecting their radio signals. The meeting was held at the Green Bank facility in 1961. The equation that bears Drake's name arose out of his preparations for the meeting.&lt;ref name="Astrobiology Magazine"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.astrobio.net/alien-life/the-drake-equation-revisited-part-i/ | title=The Drake Equation Revisited: Part I | work=[[Astrobiology Magazine]] | date=Sep 29, 2003 | accessdate=May 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; As I planned the meeting, I realized a few day[s] ahead of time we needed an agenda. And so I wrote down all the things you needed to know to predict how hard it's going to be to detect extraterrestrial life. And looking at them it became pretty evident that if you multiplied all these together, you got a number, N, which is the number of detectable civilizations in our galaxy. This was aimed at the radio search, and not to search for primordial or primitive life forms.

Peter Pearman, Frank Drake, [[Philip Morrison]], businessman and radio amateur Dana Atchley, chemist [[Melvin Calvin]], astronomer [[Su-Shu Huang]], neuroscientist [[John C.

Within the limits of our existing technology, any practical search for distant intelligent life must necessarily be a search for some manifestation of a distant technology. After about 50 years, the Drake equation is still of seminal importance because it is a 'road map' of what we need to learn in order to solve this fundamental existential question.&lt;ref name="Burchell"/&gt; It also formed the backbone of [[astrobiology]] as a science; although speculation is entertained to give context, astrobiology concerns itself primarily with [[hypotheses]] that fit firmly into existing [[Theory#Science|scientific theories]]. Some 50 years of SETI have failed to find anything, even though radio telescopes, receiver techniques, and computational abilities have improved enormously since the early 1960s, but it has been discovered, at least, that our galaxy is not teeming with very powerful alien transmitters continuously broadcasting near the 21&amp;nbsp;cm [[Hydrogen frequencies|hydrogen frequency]]. No one could say this in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astronomynow.com/news/n1004/SETI/ SETI: A celebration of the first 50 years]. Keith Cooper. ''Astronomy Now''. 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modifications==
As many observers have pointed out, the Drake equation is a very simple model that does not include potentially relevant parameters,&lt;ref&gt;

Others note that the Drake equation ignores many concepts that might be relevant to the odds of contacting other civilizations.  For example, [[David Brin]] states: "The Drake equation merely speaks of the number of sites at which ETIs spontaneously arise. The equation says nothing directly about the contact cross-section between an ETIS and contemporary human society".&lt;ref name="GS"&gt;
{{cite journal
 |last=Brin |first=G. D.

 |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society]]
 |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=283–309
 |bibcode=1983QJRAS..24..283B
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because it is the contact cross-section that is of interest to the SETI community, many additional factors and modifications of the Drake equation have been proposed.

;Colonization : It has been proposed to generalize the Drake equation to include additional effects of alien civilizations colonizing other [[star system]]s. Each original site expands with an expansion velocity {{mvar|v}}, and establishes additional sites that survive for a lifetime {{mvar|L}}.  The result is a more complex set of 3 equations.&lt;ref name="GS"/&gt;

;Reappearance factor : The Drake equation may furthermore be multiplied by ''how many times'' an intelligent civilization may occur on planets where it has happened once. Even if an intelligent civilization reaches the end of its lifetime after, for example, 10,000 years, life may still prevail on the planet for billions of years, permitting the next [[Sociocultural evolution|civilization to evolve]]. Thus, several civilizations may come and go during the lifespan of one and the same planet. Thus, if {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the average number of times a new civilization reappears on the same planet where a previous civilization once has appeared and ended, then the total number of civilizations on such a planet would be {{math|1 + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;}}, which is the actual ''reappearance factor'' added to the equation.

:The factor depends on what generally is the cause of [[civilization extinction]]. If it is generally by temporary uninhabitability, for example a [[nuclear winter]], then {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;}} may be relatively high. On the other hand, if it is generally by permanent uninhabitability, such as [[stellar evolution]], then {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;}} may be almost zero. In the case of total life extinction, a similar factor may be applicable for {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;}}, that is, ''how many times'' life may appear on a planet where it has appeared once.

;METI factor : [[Aleksandr Leonidovich Zaitsev|Alexander Zaitsev]] said that to be in a communicative phase and emit dedicated messages are not the same. For example, humans, although being in a communicative phase, are not a communicative civilization; we do not practise such activities as the purposeful and regular transmission of interstellar messages. For this reason, he suggested introducing the METI factor (messaging to extraterrestrial intelligence) to the classical Drake equation.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defined the factor as "the fraction of communicative civilizations with clear and non-paranoid planetary consciousness", or alternatively expressed, the fraction of communicative civilizations that actually engage in deliberate interstellar transmission.

:The METI factor is somewhat misleading since active, purposeful transmission of messages by a civilization is not required for them to receive a broadcast sent by another that is seeking first contact. It is merely required they have capable and compatible receiver systems operational; however, this is a variable humans cannot accurately estimate.

Seager stresses, “We’re not throwing out the Drake Equation, which is really a different topic,” explaining, “Since Drake came up with the equation, we have discovered thousands of exoplanets. We as a community have had our views revolutionized as to what could possibly be out there. And now we have a real question on our hands, one that’s not related to intelligent life: Can we detect any signs of life in any way in the very near future?”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/what-a-brand-new-equation-reveals-about-our-odds-of-fin-531575395|title=A New Equation Reveals Our Exact Odds of Finding Alien Life|publisher=[[io9]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Original estimates===
There is considerable disagreement on the values of these parameters, but the 'educated guesses' used by Drake and his colleagues in 1961 were:&lt;ref&gt;

}} Note: This reference has a table of 1961 values, claimed to be taken from Drake &amp; Sobel, but these differ from the book.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;}} = 1 yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (1 star formed per year, on the average over the life of the galaxy; this was regarded as conservative)
* {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}} = 0.2 to 0.5 (one fifth to one half of all stars formed will have planets)
* {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}} = 1 to 5 (stars with planets will have between 1 and 5 planets capable of developing life)
* {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;}} = 1 (100% of these planets will develop life)
* {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} = 1 (100% of which will develop intelligent life)
* {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}} = 0.1 to 0.2 (10–20% of which will be able to communicate)
* {{math|''L''}} = 1000 to 100,000,000 years (which will last somewhere between 1000 and 100,000,000 years)

Inserting the above minimum numbers into the equation gives a minimum N of 20 (see: [[Drake equation#Range of results|Range of results]]). Inserting the maximum numbers gives a maximum of 50,000,000. Drake states that given the uncertainties, the original meeting concluded that {{math|''N'' ≈ ''L''}}, and there were probably between 1000 and 100,000,000 civilizations in the [[Milky Way]] galaxy.

The discovery of numerous [[gas giant]]s in close orbit with their stars has introduced doubt that life-supporting planets commonly survive the formation of their stellar systems. So-called [[hot Jupiter]]s may migrate from distant orbits to near orbits, in the process disrupting the orbits of habitable planets.

On the other hand, the variety of [[star system]]s that might have habitable zones is not just limited to solar-type stars and Earth-sized planets. It is now estimated that even tidally locked planets close to [[red dwarf]] stars [[habitability of red dwarf systems|might have habitable zones]],&lt;ref&gt;

The authors of the [[rare Earth hypothesis]] propose a number of additional constraints on habitability for planets, including being in galactic zones with suitably low radiation, high star metallicity, and low enough density to avoid excessive asteroid bombardment. They also propose that it is necessary to have a planetary system with large gas giants which provide bombardment protection without a [[hot Jupiter]]; and a planet with [[plate tectonic]]s, a large moon that creates tidal pools, and moderate [[axial tilt]] to generate seasonal variation.&lt;ref name="RareEarth"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ward |first1=Peter D. |last2=Brownlee |first2=Donald |title=Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe |publisher=Copernicus Books (Springer Verlag) |date=2000 |isbn=0-387-98701-0 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fraction of the above that actually go on to develop life, {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;}}====
Geological evidence from the Earth suggests that {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;}} may be high; life on Earth appears to have begun around the same time as favorable conditions arose, suggesting that [[abiogenesis]] may be relatively common once conditions are right. However, this evidence only looks at the Earth (a single model planet), and contains [[anthropic bias]], as the planet of study was not chosen randomly, but by the living organisms that already inhabit it (ourselves). From a classical [[hypothesis testing]] standpoint, there are zero [[degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]], permitting no valid estimates to be made. If life were to be found on [[life on Mars|Mars]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Enceladus]] or [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] that developed independently from life on Earth it would imply a value for {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;}} close to 1. While this would raise the degrees of freedom from zero to one, there would remain a great deal of uncertainty on any estimate due to the small sample size, and the chance they are not really independent.

Countering this argument is that there is no evidence for abiogenesis occurring more than once on the Earth — that is, all terrestrial life stems from a common origin. If abiogenesis were more common it would be speculated to have occurred more than once on the Earth. Scientists have searched for this by looking for [[bacteria]] that are unrelated to other life on Earth, but none have been found yet.&lt;ref&gt;

Biochemists [[Francis Crick]] and [[Leslie Orgel]] laid special emphasis on this uncertainty: "At the moment we have no means at all of knowing" whether we are "likely to be alone in the galaxy (Universe)" or whether "the galaxy may be pullulating with life of many different forms."&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an alternative to abiogenesis on Earth, they proposed the hypothesis of [[directed panspermia]], which states that Earth life began with "microorganisms sent here deliberately by a technological society on another planet, by means of a special long-range unmanned spaceship".

====Fraction of the above that develops intelligent life, {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}====
This value remains particularly controversial. Those who favor a low value, such as the biologist [[Ernst Mayr]], point out that of the billions of species that have existed on Earth, only one has become intelligent and from this, infer a tiny value for {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref name="Ernst Mayr on SETI"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the Rare Earth hypothesis, notwithstanding their low value for {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}} above, also think a low value for {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} dominates the analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Rare Earth, p. xviii.: "We believe that life in the form of microbes or their equivalents is very common in the universe, perhaps more common than even Drake or Sagan envisioned. However, ''complex'' life – animals and higher plants – is likely to be far more rare than commonly assumed."&lt;/ref&gt; Those who favor higher values note the generally increasing complexity of life over time, concluding that the appearance of intelligence is almost inevitable,&lt;ref name="acampbell.ukfsn.org"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; implying an {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} approaching 1. Skeptics point out that the large spread of values in this factor and others make all estimates unreliable. (See [[#Criticism|Criticism]]).

In addition, while it appears that life developed soon after the formation of Earth, the [[Cambrian explosion]], in which a large variety of multicellular life forms came into being, occurred a considerable amount of time after the formation of Earth, which suggests the possibility that special conditions were necessary. Some scenarios such as the [[snowball Earth]] or research into the [[extinction events]] have raised the possibility that life on Earth is relatively fragile. Research on any past [[life on Mars]] is relevant since a discovery that life did form on Mars but ceased to exist might raise our estimate of f&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; but would indicate that in half the known cases, intelligent life did not develop.

Estimates of {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} have been affected by discoveries that the Solar System's orbit is circular in the galaxy, at such a distance that it remains out of the spiral arms for tens of millions of years (evading radiation from [[nova]]e). Also, Earth's large moon may aid the evolution of life by [[Rare Earth hypothesis#A large moon|stabilizing the planet's axis of rotation]].

====Fraction of the above revealing their existence via signal release into space, {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}}====
For deliberate communication, the one example we have (the Earth) does not do much explicit communication, though there are [[Active SETI|some efforts]] covering only a tiny fraction of the stars that might look for our presence. (See [[Arecibo message]], for example). There is [[Fermi paradox#They choose not to interact with us|considerable speculation]] why an extraterrestrial civilization might exist but choose not to communicate. However, deliberate communication is not required, and calculations indicate that current or near-future Earth-level technology might well be detectable to civilizations not too much more advanced than our own.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this standard, the Earth is a communicating civilization.

Another question is what percentage of civilizations in the galaxy are close enough for us to detect, assuming that they send out signals. For example, existing Earth radio telescopes could only detect Earth radio transmissions from roughly a light year away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) |journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics |author=J.

====Lifetime of such a civilization wherein it communicates its signals into space, {{math|''L''}}====
[[Michael Shermer]] estimated {{math|''L''}} as 420 years, based on the duration of sixty historical Earthly civilizations.&lt;ref name="Why ET Hasn’t Called"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using 28 civilizations more recent than the Roman Empire, he calculates a figure of 304 years for "modern" civilizations. It could also be argued from Michael Shermer's results that the fall of most of these civilizations was followed by later civilizations that carried on the technologies, so it is doubtful that they are separate civilizations in the context of the Drake equation. In the expanded version, including ''reappearance number'', this lack of specificity in defining single civilizations does not matter for the end result, since such a civilization turnover could be described as an increase in the ''reappearance number'' rather than increase in {{math|''L''}}, stating that a civilization reappears in the form of the succeeding cultures. Furthermore, since none could communicate over interstellar space, the method of comparing with historical civilizations could be regarded as invalid.

[[David Grinspoon]] has argued that once a civilization has developed enough, it might overcome all threats to its survival. It will then last for an indefinite period of time, making the value for {{math|''L''}} potentially billions of years. If this is the case, then he proposes that the Milky Way galaxy may have been steadily accumulating advanced civilizations since it formed.&lt;ref name="David Grinspoon 2004"&gt;

This has the advantage that {{math|''T''}} would be a relatively easy to discover number, as it would simply be some fraction of the age of the universe.

It has also been hypothesized that once a civilization has learned of a more advanced one, its longevity could increase because it can learn from the experiences of the other.&lt;ref name="GoldsmithOwen"&gt;

The astronomer [[Carl Sagan]] speculated that all of the terms, except for the lifetime of a civilization, are relatively high and the determining factor in whether there are large or small numbers of civilizations in the universe is the civilization lifetime, or in other words, the ability of technological civilizations to avoid self-destruction. In Sagan's case, the Drake equation was a strong motivating factor for his interest in environmental issues and his efforts to warn against the dangers of [[nuclear warfare]].

(We expect that a much higher number will have microbial life.)"&lt;/ref&gt; Mayr's view on intelligence arising, Drake's view of communication, and Shermer's estimate of lifetime:

===Has intelligent life ''ever'' existed?===
The Drake equation can be modified to determine just how unlikely intelligent life must be, to give the result that Earth has the only intelligent life that has ever arisen, either in our galaxy or the universe as a whole. This simplifies the calculation by removing the lifetime and communication constraints. Since star and planets counts are known, this leaves the only unknown as the odds that a habitable planet ''ever'' develops intelligent life. For Earth to have the only civilization that has ever occurred in the universe, then the odds of any habitable planet ever developing such a civilization must be less than {{val|2.5|e=-24}}. Similarly, for Earth to host the only civilization in our galaxy for all time, the odds of a habitable zone planet ever hosting intelligent life must be less than {{val|1.7|e=-11}} (about 1 in 60 billion). The figure for the universe implies that it is highly unlikely that Earth hosts the only intelligent life that has ever occurred. The figure for our galaxy suggests that other civilizations may have occurred or will likely occur in our galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://phys.org/news/2016-04-limits-uniqueness.html |title= Are we alone?

==Criticism==
Criticism of the Drake equation follows mostly from the observation that several terms in the equation are largely or entirely based on conjecture.  Star formation rates are well-known, and the incidence of planets has a sound theoretical and observational basis, but the other terms in the equation become very speculative. The uncertainties revolve around our understanding of the evolution of life, intelligence, and civilization, not physics.  No statistical estimates are possible for some of the parameters, where only one example is known.  The net result is that the equation cannot be used to draw firm conclusions of any kind, and the resulting margin of error is huge, far beyond what some consider acceptable or meaningful.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that even though the Drake equation currently involves speculation about unmeasured parameters, it was intended as a way to stimulate dialogue on these topics. Then the focus becomes how to proceed experimentally. Indeed, Drake originally formulated the equation merely as an agenda for discussion at the Green Bank conference.&lt;ref&gt;

===Fermi paradox===
{{main|Fermi paradox}}
The pessimists' most telling argument in the SETI debate stems not from theory or conjecture but from an actual observation: the presumed lack of extraterrestrial contact.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; A civilization lasting for tens of millions of years might be able to travel anywhere in the galaxy, even at the slow speeds foreseeable with our own kind of technology.  Furthermore, no confirmed signs of intelligence elsewhere have been recognized as such, either in our galaxy or in the [[observable universe]] of 2&amp;nbsp;[[trillion (short scale)|trillion]] galaxies.&lt;ref name="Conselice"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Evolution of Galaxy Number Density at {{math|''z'' &lt; 8}} and its Implications|author=Christopher J.

A large number of explanations have been proposed to explain this lack of contact; a book published in 2015 elaborated on 75 different explanations.&lt;ref&gt;

 |publisher=Springer International Publishing
 |isbn=3319132350
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of the Drake Equation, the explanations can be divided into three classes:

*Few intelligent civilizations ever arise.  This is an argument that at least one of the first few terms, {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt; · ''f''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; · ''n''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; · ''f''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; · ''f''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}, has a low value.  The most common suspect is {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}, but explanations such as the rare Earth hypothesis argue that {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the small term.
*Intelligent civilizations exist, but we see no evidence, meaning {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}} is small.  Typical arguments include [[Fermi paradox#Intelligent civilizations are too far apart in space or time|that civilizations are too far apart]], [[Fermi paradox#It is too expensive to spread physically throughout the galaxy|it is too expensive to spread throughout the galaxy]], [[Fermi paradox#Civilizations broadcast detectable radio signals only for a brief period of time|civilizations broadcast signals for only a brief period of time]], [[Fermi paradox#It is dangerous to communicate|it is dangerous to communicate]], and many others.
*The lifetime of intelligent, communicative civilizations is short, meaning the value of {{mvar|L}} is small. Drake suggested that a large number of extraterrestrial civilizations would form, and he further speculated that the lack of evidence of such civilizations may be because technological civilizations tend to disappear rather quickly. Typical explanations include [[Fermi paradox#It is the nature of intelligent life to destroy itself|it is the nature of intelligent life to destroy itself]], [[Fermi paradox#It is the nature of intelligent life to destroy others|it is the nature of intelligent life to destroy others]], [[Fermi paradox#Periodic extinction by natural events|they tend to be destroyed by natural events]], and others.

These lines of reasoning lead to the [[Great Filter]] hypothesis,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
 |last=Hanson |first=R.
 |date=15 September 1998
 |title=The Great Filter — Are We Almost Past It?
 |url=http://hanson.gmu.edu/greatfilter.html
 |accessdate=2013-08-21
}}&lt;/ref&gt; which states that since there are no observed extraterrestrial civilizations, despite the vast number of stars, then some step in the process must be acting as a filter to reduce the final value. According to this view, either it is very difficult for intelligent life to arise, or the lifetime of such civilizations, or the period of time they reveal their existence, must be relatively short.

==In fiction and popular culture==
The equation was cited by [[Gene Roddenberry]] as supporting the multiplicity of inhabited planets shown on ''[[Star Trek]]'', the television series he created. However, Roddenberry did not have the equation with him, and he was forced to "invent" it for his original proposal.&lt;ref&gt;''The Making of Star Trek'' by Stephen E. Whitfield and Gene Roddenberry, Ballantine Books, N. Y., 1968&lt;/ref&gt; The invented equation created by Roddenberry is:
::&lt;math&gt;Ff^2 (MgE)-C^1 Ri^1 \cdot M=L/So &lt;/math&gt;
However, a number raised to the first power is merely the number itself.

For example, [[pronoun]]s are often exophoric, with words such as "this", "that", "here", "there", as in ''that chair over there is John's'' said while indicating the direction of the chair referred to.  Given "Did the gardener water those plants?", it is quite possible that "those" refers back to the preceding text, to some earlier mention of those particular plants in the discussion.  But it is also possible that it refers to the environment in which the dialogue is taking place&amp;mdash;to the "context of situation", as it is called&amp;mdash;where the plants in question are present and can be pointed to if necessary.  The interpretation would be "those plants there, in front of us".  This kind of reference is called exophora, since it takes us outside the text altogether.  Exophoric reference is not [[cohesion (linguistics)|cohesive]], since it does not bind the two elements together into a text.

==Homophora==
A type of exophora, homophora relates to a generic phrase that obtains a specific meaning through knowledge of its context; a specific example of homophora can variably be a "homophor" or a "homophoric reference".

For example, the meaning of the phrase ''"the Queen"'' may be determined by the country in which it is spoken. Because there are many Queens throughout the world, the location of the speaker provides the extra information that allows an individual Queen to be identified.

The precise origin of the term is not fully clear, but it is probably intended to suggest a [[referring expression]] that always has the same (Greek ''hómos'') referent (within a given cultural context, of course). "Homophoric" seems to have been first used in the influential book by M.A.K. Halliday and R. Hasan, ''Cohesion in English'' (Longman, 1976, pp. 71 and 73).

'''FOSS Movement in India''' refers to the campaign across the country during the 1990s and 2000s in particular, to promote Free and Open Source Software. It was marked by the existence of many [[Indian Linux User Groups]] (ILUGs) groups and [[Free Software User Groups]] (FSUGs) in different cities, town and other areas.

The prominent members of the campaign include the late [[Atul Chitnis]], Prof [[Nagarjuna G.]] and others.

==Timeline of the campaign==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11332">The term '''fixed action pattern''' ('''FAP'''), or '''modal action pattern''', is sometimes used in [[ethology]] to denote an [[instinct]]ive behavioral sequence that is relatively invariant within the species and almost inevitably runs to completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Campbell, N. A.]]|year=1996|title=Biology|edition=4|chapter=Chapter 50|publisher=Benjamin Cummings, New York|ISBN= 0-8053-1957-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fixed action patterns, or similar behaviour sequences, are produced by a [[biological neural network|neural network]] known as the innate releasing mechanism in response to an external [[sensory system|sensory]] stimulus known as a '''sign stimulus''' or '''releaser'''. A fixed action pattern is one of the few types of behaviors which is thought to be "hard-wired" and [[instinct]]ive.

[[Konrad Lorenz]] was one the key founders of the fixed action pattern definition. He identified six characteristics of fixed action patterns&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/19670401|title=Studying animal behavior : autobiographies of the founders|date=1989|origyear= 1985|publisher=University of Chicago Press|others=Dewsbury, Donald A., 1939-|isbn=0226144100|location=Chicago|oclc=19670401}}&lt;/ref&gt;. That stated fixed action patterns are, stereotyped, complex, species characteristic, released, triggered and, independent of experience&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. 

==Terminology==
The term "sign stimulus", or "releaser", is used to denote a simple feature of a complex stimulus that can elicit a FAP.  For example, the red belly of a male stickleback elicits a head-down, attack behaviour in other male sticklebacks. This same response can be elicited by artificial models or objects that contain the sign stimulus of red, for example, a red coloured card.

The terms "sign stimulus" and "releaser" are sometimes used interchangeably; however, they have different meanings.  The term "sign stimulus" is used to denote a feature of an animal's environment that elicits a particular response.  The term "releaser" is used for a stimulus that has evolved to facilitate communication between conspecifics (animals of the same species).&lt;ref name="Kenyon"&gt;{{cite web|author=Kenyon, P.|title=Ethological Experiments|publisher=University of Plymouth|accessdate=August 1, 2014|url=http://www.flyfishingdevon.co.uk/salmon/year1/psy128ethology_experiments/ethexpt.htm#FAP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Male stickleback behaviour===

One example of fixed action patterns is the courtship and aggression behaviour of the male three-spined [[stickleback]] during the mating season, described in a series of studies by [[Niko Tinbergen]].  During spring, male sticklebacks change colour, establish a territory and build a nest. They attack male sticklebacks that enter their territory, but court females and entice them to enter the nest to lay eggs.  Tinbergen used crude models of sticklebacks to investigate which features of male and female sticklebacks elicited attack and courtship behaviour from male sticklebacks. Tinbergen's main findings were that male sticklebacks responded in a relatively invariant way and attacked a model with a red belly, but in contrast, courted a model with a swollen belly.

===Egg-retrieval behaviour===
Another example of a behaviour that has been described as a FAP is the egg-retrieval behavior of the [[graylag goose]], reported in classic studies by Niko Tinbergen and [[Konrad Lorenz]]. Like many ground-nesting birds, if an [[Egg (biology)|egg]] becomes displaced from the nest, the greylag rolls it back to the nest with its beak. The sight of the displaced egg is the sign stimulus and elicits the egg-retrieval behaviour. If the egg is removed from the goose during the performance of egg-rolling, the bird often continues with the behavior, pulling its head back as if an imaginary egg is still being maneuvered by the underside of its beak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUNZv-ByPkU|title=Video of grelag goose performing FAP}}&lt;/ref&gt; The greylag will also attempt to retrieve other egg-shaped objects, such as a golf ball, door knob, or even a model egg too large to have possibly been laid by the goose itself (i.e. a [[supernormal stimulus]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tinbergen, N.|year=1951|title=The Study of Instinct|publisher=Oxford University Press, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===
[[File:Larus Dominicanus with young.jpg|right|thumb|[[Kelp gull]] chicks peck at red spot on mother's beak to stimulate regurgitating reflex.]]
Other examples include:
*Some [[mating dance]]s, commonly carried out by [[bird]]s, are examples of fixed action patterns. In these cases, the sign [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] is typically the presence of the opposite sex.
*[[Kelp gull]] chicks are stimulated by a red spot on the mother's beak to peck at the spot (pictured), which induces regurgitation.
*Some [[moth]]s instantly fold their wings and drop to the ground if they encounter ultrasonic signals such as those produced by [[bat]]s; see [[ultrasound avoidance]].
*[[Mayflies]] drop their eggs when they encounter a certain pattern of light polarization which indicates they are over water.
*Some [[lizards]] and [[snakes]] exhibit strike-induced chemosensory searching behavior as a means of relocating bitten and [[venom|envenomated]] prey by scent-trailing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=W.E.|title=Foraging mode and evolution of strike-induced chemosensory searching in lizards|journal=Journal of Chemical Ecology|year=2003|volume=29|issue=4|pages=1013–1026|pmid=12775158|doi=10.1023/a:1022948219985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=William E.|author2=Susan G.

== Significance ==
[[File:V31-d-Graugans.JPG|right|thumb|The egg-rolling retrieval behavior of a [[greylag goose]] is a widely cited as an example of a fixed action pattern.]]

FAPs, or inflexible behavior patterns, are usually noticeable in animal behavior because FAPs represent the simplest type of behavior in which a particular ''stimulus'' almost always results in an invariable behavioral response. 

FAPs have been said to be "hard-wired" in animals' brains. They are unusual in that they are relatively ''un-influenced'' by the environment, once the behaviour has been elicited. The existence of FAPs is rather unusual in that a fixed response can lead to maladaptive results, whereas flexible behaviors are generally more likely to be adaptive by increasing [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]. Because of this, most behaviors which are both FAPs and occur in more complex animals are usually essential to the animal's fitness, or in which speed (i.e. an absence of learning) is a factor.  For instance, the greylag goose's egg rolling behavior is so essential to the survival of its chicks that the fitness of the parent bird is increased by the behavior being relatively invariant. A stickleback will attack any male fish who enters his territory while the female is sexually receptive, reacting to their red colour, while the female stickleback triggers behavior in the male resulting in the fertilization of her eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=APARICIO|first=SANS|title=Psychology of Motivation|year=2000|publisher=UNED|location=Spain|isbn=9788492948673}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Relatively invariant behaviors are also predictable, which can lead to their exploitation by humans or other animals.

There are exceptions to fixed action pattern rules. For example, male blond ring doves isolated from their own species will resort to courting a pigeon, then a human's hand, and finally expressing courtship activity alone in their box if they are left alone for a long period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=CRAIG|first=WALLACE|title=APPETITES AND AVERSIONS AS CONSTITUENTS OF INSTINCTS|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.2307/1536346|journal=The Biological Bulletin|volume=34|issue=2|pages=91–107|doi=10.2307/1536346|pmc=1091358}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=aYS5BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=craig+1918+courtship&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yZoJ1mhEpV&amp;sig=EaRgQoA_Rqw2TSujc9i21BCNLqE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiH7qXRpvbYAhXyRt8KHeBgBs0Q6AEIQjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=craig%201918%20courtship&amp;f=false|title=The Foundations of Ethology|last=Lorenz|first=K.|date=2013-04-17|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9783709136713|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exploitation==
[[File:Reed warbler cuckoo.jpg|thumb|Brood parasites, such as the cuckoo, provide a supernormal stimulus to the parenting species.]]
Some species have evolved to exploit the FAPs of other species by [[mimicry]] of their sign stimuli. Replicating the releaser required to trigger a FAP is known as ''code-breaking''. A well-known example of this is [[brood parasitism]], where one species will lay its eggs in the nest of another species, which will then parent its young. A young [[North American cowbird]], for example, provides a supernormal stimulus to its foster parent, which will cause it to forage rapidly to satisfy the larger bird's demands.&lt;ref&gt;Wickler, W. (1968) ''Mimicry in Plants and Animals.'' World University Library, London.&lt;/ref&gt; A nestling will provide higher levels of stimulus with noisier, more energetic behavior, communicating its urgent need for food. Parents in this situation have to work harder to provide food, otherwise their own offspring are likely to die of [[starvation]].
&lt;!-- Second example: Thynnine wasps and orchids (orchid exploiting wasp) --&gt;
&lt;!-- Third example: Larva of blister beetles emits scents that mimics the scents coming from female Ivy bees so that the male Ivy bees come to mate the larval mass. The larva then climbs on the body of the male bee which later if lucky gets to mate a female bee. Then the larva rides with the female bee to the hive of the bee and exploit the food resources of the hive for its own survival.&lt;ref&gt;Alcock, J. (2013)''Animal Behavior.''Sinauer Associates, Inc. Publishers. Sunderland, Massachusetts &lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

{{Linguistics}}
'''Forensic linguistics''', '''legal linguistics''', or '''language and the law''', is the application of [[linguistics|linguistic]] knowledge, methods and insights to the [[forensic]] context of law, language, crime investigation, trial, and judicial procedure. It is a branch of [[applied linguistics]].

There are principally three areas of application for linguists working in forensic contexts:&lt;ref name=Aston&gt;{{Cite web |title=Centre for Forensic Linguistics |publisher=Aston University |url=http://www.forensiclinguistics.net/cfl_fl.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100927010829/http://www.forensiclinguistics.net/cfl_fl.html |archivedate=27 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* understanding language of the written law,
* understanding language use in forensic and judicial processes, and
* the provision of linguistic evidence.

The discipline of forensic linguistics is not homogenous; it involves a range of experts and researchers in different areas of the field.

==History==

The phrase ''forensic linguistics'' first appeared in 1968 when Jan Svartvik, a professor of [[linguistics]], used it in an analysis of statements by [[Timothy John Evans]].&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008"&gt;John Olsson (2008), ''Forensic Linguistics, Second Edition''. London: Continuum {{ISBN|978-0-8264-6109-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was in regard to re-analyzing the statements given to police at [[Notting Hill]] police station in 1949 in the case of an alleged murder by Evans. Evans was suspected of murdering his wife and baby and was tried and hanged for the crime. Yet, when Svartvik studied the statements allegedly given by Evans, he found that there were different stylistic markers involved, and Evans did not actually give the statements to the police officers as had been stated at the trial.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Olsson, John. “What Is Forensic Linguistics?” ''[http://www.thetext.co.uk/what_is.pdf www.thetext.co.uk/what_is.pdf]'' (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; Sparked by this case, early forensic linguistics in the UK were focused on questioning the validity of police interrogations. As seen in numerous famous cases (e.g. the convictions of Derek Bentley, the Guildford Four, the Bridgewater Three, etc.), many of the major concerns were of the statements police officers used. Numerous times, the topic of police register came up – this meaning the type of stylist language and vocabulary used by officers of the law when transcribing witness statements.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Moving to the US and the beginnings of the field of forensic linguistics, the field really began with the 1963 case of Ernesto Miranda. His case led to the creation of Miranda Rights and pushed focus of forensic linguistics on witness questioning rather than police statements. Various cases came about that challenged whether or not suspects truly understood what their rights meant – leading to a distinction of coercive versus voluntary interrogations.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

During the early days of forensic linguistics in the United Kingdom, the legal defense for many criminal cases questioned the authenticity of police statements. At the time, customary police procedure for taking suspects' statements dictated that it be in a specific format, rather than in the suspect's own words. Statements by witnesses are very seldom made in a coherent or orderly fashion, with speculation and backtracking done out loud. The delivery is often too fast-paced, causing important details to be left out.

Forensic linguistics can be traced back as early as a 1927 to a ransom note in Corning, New York. As the Associated Press reported&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press. [http://nyshistoricnewspapers.org/lccn/sn84031094/1927-09-09/ed-1/seq-2/# "Think Corning Girl Wrote Ransom Note"]&lt;/ref&gt; in "Think Corning Girl Wrote Ransom Note" "Duncan McLure, of Johnson City uncle of the (kidnapped) girl, is the only member of the family to spell his name 'McLure' instead of 'McClure.' The letter he received, supposedly from the kidnappers, was addressed to him by the proper name, indicating that the writer was familiar with the difference in spelling."  Other work of forensic linguistics in the United States concerned the rights of individuals with regard to understanding their [[Miranda rights]] during the interrogation process.&lt;ref&gt;Olsson, John. "What Is Forensic Linguistics?" ''[http://www.thetext.co.uk/what_is.pdf www.thetext.co.uk/what_is.pdf]'' (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; An early application of forensic linguistics in the United States was related to the status of trademarks as words or phrases in the language. One of the bigger cases involved fast food giant [[McDonald's]] claiming that it had originated the process of attaching unprotected words to the 'Mc' prefix (referred to as [[McWords]]) and was unhappy with Quality Inns International's intention of opening a chain of economy hotels to be called 'McSleep'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Ayres, Jr | first = B. Drummond | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/22/us/mcdonald-s-to-court-mc-is-ours.html | title = McDonald's, to Court: 'Mc' Is Ours | date=22 July 1988 | accessdate = 19 March 2012 | publisher = [[The New York Times]] | location = [[New York City|New York]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, Australian linguists discussed the application of linguistics and sociolinguistics to legal issues.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; They discovered that a phrase such as {{'}}''the same language''{{'}} is open to interpretation. Aboriginal people have their own understanding and use of 'English', something that is not always appreciated by speakers of the dominant version of English, i.e., 'white English'. The Aboriginal people also bring their own culturally-based interactional styles to the interview.

The 2000s saw a considerable shift in the field of forensic linguistics, which has been described as a coming-of-age of the discipline. Not only does the field have professional associations such as the International Association of Forensic Linguistics (IAFL) founded in 1993, and the Austrian Association for Legal Linguistics (AALL) founded in 2017,&lt;ref&gt;Austrian Association for Legal Linguistics. 2017. "Gründung der Österreichischen Gesellschaft für Rechtslinguistik. Abendgymnasium Wien. http://wien.abendgymnasium.at/gruendung-der-oesterreichischen-gesellschaft-fuer-rechtslinguistik/&lt;/ref&gt; it can now provide the scientific community with a range of textbooks such as Coulthard and Johnson (2007), Gibbons (2003) and Olsson (2008).&lt;ref&gt;Alison Johnson, Malcolm Coulthard. 2010. "Current debates in forensic linguistics". The Routledge Handbook of Forensic Linguistics. London: Routledge, 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of study==
The range of topics within forensic linguistics is diverse, but research occurs in the following areas:

===The language of legal texts===
The study of the language of legal texts encompasses a wide range of forensic texts. That includes the study of text types and forms of analysis. Any text or item of spoken language can potentially be a forensic text when it is used in a legal or criminal context.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008" /&gt; This includes analysing the linguistics of documents as diverse as Acts of Parliament (or other law-making body), private wills, court judgements and summonses and the statutes of other bodies, such as States and government departments. One important area{{Original research inline|date=November 2010}} is that of the transformative effect of [[Norman French]] and [[Latin|Ecclesiastic Latin]] on the development of the English common law, and the evolution of the legal specifics associated with it.  It can also refer to the ongoing attempts at making [[legal writing|legal language]] more comprehensible to laypeople.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

A forensic linguistics understanding of the relationship between language and law has been voiced by Leisser who states that 
* "It is indeed hard to deny that the rule of law is in fact the rule of language. It seems that there cannot be law without language. Kelsen (1945: 161) wrote that '[j]ust as everything King Midas touched turned into gold, everything to which the law refers becomes law, i.e. something legally e x i s t i n g'. The concept of law is conveyed and mediated entirely through the structures of human language and it is thus plausible to assume that everything the law touches is therefore also touched by language. This is particularly evident in the fact that all processes of legal meaning-making and meaning-seeking are inextricably tied to the language system. ... [L]aw is defined as a set of linguistic signs which is ascribed the societal power to control human conduct."&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Leisser]] (2017) ''„Adjectival Vagueness in Legal Language: The Case of the Austrian Civil Code“'' Vienna: University of Vienna, 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===The language of legal processes===
Among other things, this area examines language as it is used in cross-examination, evidence presentation, judge's direction, police cautions, police testimonies in court, summing up to a jury, interview techniques, the questioning process in court and in other areas such as police interviews.

Police officers use specific language to elicit certain responses from civilians. Because of a police officers' social stature, and the way they often phrase "requests" as "commands", people may be confused as to what their rights are when they are being questioned by police. Officers use linguistic tactics including putting the blame onto the victim and asking questions with ambiguous phrasing to elicit specific responses from people (Solan, L. &amp; Tiersma, P, 2005).

A defendant using ambiguity in the courtroom may present issues and be deemed unacceptable. Specifically, when a victim is invoking their right to a lawyer, there are directions stating that the request may not come off as ambiguous. In fact, if the request is not stated in a way that the officer deems to be clear, the victim may not receive their request for counsel at all. Refer to the following link to explore an example through the ''Louisiana vs. Demesme'' case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasc.org/news_releases/2017/2017-052.asp|title=2017-052.asp|website=www.lasc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the examination process, language plays a substantial role in the presentation of a story to the courtroom. Specifically, the language used by the lawyer to construct the story to the courtroom elicits specific responses from the witness, and specific emotions from the jury. For example, in an instance where a lawyer is examining a hostile witness, they will often use language to limit the response of the witness, in order to avoid having the witness present conflicting evidence. In this instance, yes/no questions will be targeted, and questions with room for elaboration, such as wh-formation questions, will likely be avoided. In a situation where a lawyer interviews a friendly witness whose testimony could potentially strengthen the story constructed by the lawyer, the opposite may occur where wh-questions are targeted to allow for elaboration (Olsson, Luchjenborers, 2013).

Lawyers employs specific tactics for both themselves and their witnesses to come off as more or less truthful to the jury and the people of the courtroom. For example, the lawyer may refer to the witness by their first name or a nickname to humanize the witness, or they may speak using slang in order to create less social distance between himself and the courtroom. The lawyer may also avoid using slang, and instead use complicated law terminology to set himself apart from the courtroom and define his status (Olsson, Luchjenborers, 2013).

The lawyer works in constructing the language of the legal process of the courtroom, and specific witnesses may respond to the lawyer's questions in different ways, eliciting new language tactics and opinions from the jury. For example, witnesses may use direct or indirect speech based on their previous societal experiences, gender differences, socioeconomic differences, or differences in education level. Using particular dialects, slang, or sentence formations could assist in making the witness more or less truthful to the jury (Olsson, Luchjenborers, 2013).

==Forensic text types==

===Emergency call===
In an emergency call, the recipient or emergency operator's ability to extract primarily linguistic information in threatening situations and to come up with the required response in a timely manner is crucial to the successful completion of the call. Intonational emphasis, voice pitch and the extent to which there is cooperation between the caller and the recipient at any one time are also very important in analysing an emergency call. Full cooperation includes frank and timely responses.

Urgency plays a role in emergency calls, so hesitations, signs of evasiveness, and incomplete or overly short answers indicate that the caller might be making a false or hoax call. A genuine call has distinctive interlocking and slight overlap of turns. The recipient trusts the caller to provide accurate information and the caller trusts the recipient to ask only pertinent questions. If the caller uses a rising pitch at the end of every turn, it might represent a lack of commitment; the recipient's use of a rising pitch indicates doubt or desire for clarification. The call ideally moves from nil knowledge on the part of the recipient to a maximum amount of knowledge in a minimum possible period of time. This makes the emergency call unlike any other kind of service encounter.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008" /&gt;

===Ransom demands or other threat communication===
Threat is a counterpart of a promise and is an important feature in a ransom demand. Ransom demands are also examined to identify between genuine and false threats. An example of a ransom note analysis can be seen in the case of the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]], where the first ransom note (sometimes referred to as the Nursery Note) stated: "We warn you for making anyding public or for notify the Polise the child is in gut care" (''sic'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/lindbergh/sfeature/crime.html|title=The Kidnapping|work=PBS Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the sentence, the kidnapper makes the claim that the child is in good hands but to make such a claim, the note would have to be written before the perpetrator enters the premises. Therefore, the claim is false (at the time of writing) since the kidnapper had not even encountered the child when he wrote the note.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ransom Notes: An Analysis of Their Content &amp; "Signature"|author=Falzini, Mark W.|work=Archival Ramblings|url=http://njspmuseum.blogspot.com/2008/02/one-of-most-fascinating-areas-of-study.html|date=9 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kidnappers may write statements that later end up being true, such as "your child is being held in a private location" being written ahead of time.

===Suicide letters===
A suicide note is typically brief, concise and highly propositional with a degree of evasiveness.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008" /&gt; A credible suicide letter must be making a definite unequivocal proposition in a situational context. The proposition of genuine suicide is thematic, directed to the addressee (or addressees) and relevant to the relationship between them. Suicide notes generally have sentences alluding to the act of killing oneself, or the method of suicide that was undertaken.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2004" /&gt; The contents of a suicide note could be intended to make the addressee suffer or feel guilt. Genuine suicide letters are short, typically less than 300 words in length.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008" /&gt; Extraneous or irrelevant material is often excluded from the text.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2004"&gt;John Olsson (2004). ''An Introduction to Language Crime and the Law''. London: Continuum International Publishing Group&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death row statements===
Death row statements either admit the crime, leaving the witness with an impression of honesty and forthrightness; or deny the crime, leaving the witness with an impression of innocence. They may also denounce witnesses as dishonest, critique law enforcement as corrupt in an attempt to portray innocence or seek an element of revenge in their last moments (Olsson 2004). Death row statements are within the heavily institutionalized setting of death row prisons.
The Forensic Linguistics Institute holds a corpus of these documents and is conducting research on them.

===Social media===
Social media statements are often context specific, and their interpretation can be highly subjective. Forensic application of a selection of stylistic and stylometric techniques in a simulated authorship attribution case involving texts has been done in relation to [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|author=C.S. Michell|year=2013|title=Investigating the use of forensic stylistic and stylometric techniques in the analysis of authorship on a publicly accessible social networking site (Facebook)|degree=MA in Linguistics|publisher=University of South Africa|url=http://uir.unisa.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10500/13324/dissertation_michell_cs.pdf?sequence=1|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of social media postings can reveal whether they are illegal (e.g. sex trade) or unethical (e.g. intended to harm) or whether they are not (e.g. simply provocative or free speech).&lt;ref&gt;C. Hardaker (2015). The ethics of online aggression: Where does “virtual” end, and “reality” begin? BAAL Conference on The Ethics of Online Research Methods. Cardiff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of linguistic evidence in legal proceedings==
These areas of application have varying degrees of acceptability or reliability within the field. Linguists have provided evidence in:
* [[Trademark]] and other intellectual property disputes
* Disputes of meaning and use
* Author identification (determining who wrote an anonymous text by making comparisons to known writing samples of a suspect; such as threat letters, mobile phone texts or emails)
* Forensic stylistics (identifying cases of [[plagiarism]])
* [[Voice identification]], also known as forensic phonetics, used to determine, through acoustic qualities, if the voice on a tape recorder is that of the defendant)
* [[Discourse analysis]] (the analysis of the structure of written or spoken utterance to determine who is introducing topics or whether a suspect is agreeing to engage in criminal conspiracy)
* Language analysis (forensic [[dialectology]]) tracing the linguistic history of [[asylum seeker]]s ([[Language Analysis for the Determination of Origin]])&lt;ref name="Tiersma, Peter" /&gt;
* Reconstruction of mobile phone text conversations
* Forensic phonetics

Specialist databases of samples of spoken and written natural language (called [[text corpus|corpora]]) are now frequently used by forensic linguists. These include corpora of suicide notes, mobile phone texts, police statements, police interview records and witness statements. They are used to analyse language, understand how it is used, and to reduce the effort needed to identify words that tend to occur near each other (collocations or collocates).

===Author identification===
The identification of whether a given individual said or wrote something relies on analysis of their [[idiolect]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard, M. (2004). Author identification, idiolect and linguistic uniqueness. ''Applied Linguistics'', 25(4), 431-447.&lt;/ref&gt; or particular patterns of language use (vocabulary, collocations, pronunciation, spelling, grammar, etc). The idiolect is a theoretical construct based on the idea that there is linguistic variation at the group level and hence there may also be linguistic variation at the individual level. [[William Labov]] has stated that nobody has found a "homogenous data" in idiolects,&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William (1972) ''Sociolinguistic patterns''. Philadelphia, PA: University of Pennsylvania Press, p192.&lt;/ref&gt; and there are many reasons why it is difficult to provide such evidence.

Firstly, language is not an inherited property, but one which is socially acquired.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, C. (1984). "Genre as social action." ''Quarterly Journal of Speech, pp 151-167&lt;/ref&gt; Because acquisition is continuous and life-long, an individual's use of language is always susceptible to variation from a variety of sources, including other speakers, the media and macro-social changes. Education can have a profoundly homogenizing effect on language use.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008" /&gt; Research into authorship identification is ongoing. The term authorship attribution is now felt to be too deterministic.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, T. D. (2008). Approaching questions in forensic authorship analysis. In J. Gibbons &amp; M. T. Turell (Eds.), ''Dimensions of Forensic Linguistics''. Amsterdam: John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt;

The paucity of documents (ransom notes, threatening letters, etc) in most criminal cases in a forensic setting means there is often too little text upon which to base a reliable identification. However, the information provided may be adequate to eliminate a suspect as an author or narrow down an author from a small group of suspects.

Authorship measures that analysts use include word length average, average number of syllables per word, [[Article (grammar)|article]] frequency, type-token ratio, punctuation (both in terms of overall density and syntactic boundaries) and the measurements of [[hapax legomena]] (unique words in a text). Statistical approaches include [[factor analysis]], [[Bayesian statistics]], [[Poisson distribution]], [[multivariate analysis]], and [[discriminant function analysis]] of function words.

The Cusum (Cumulative Sum) method for text analysis has also been developed.&lt;ref&gt;Morton, A.Q., and S. Michaelson (1990) ''The Qsum Plot''. Internal Report CSR-3-90, Department of Computer Science, University of Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt; Cusum analysis works even on short texts and relies on the assumption that each speaker has a unique set of habits, thus rendering no significant difference between their speech and writing. Speakers tend to utilize two to three letter words in a sentence and their utterances tend to include vowel-initial words.

In order to carry out the Cusum test on habits of utilizing two to three letter words and vowel-initial words in a sentential clause, the occurrences of each type of word in the text must be identified and the distribution plotted in each sentence. The Cusum distribution for these two habits will be compared with the average sentence length of the text. The two sets of values should track each other. Any altered section of the text would show a distinct discrepancy between the values of the two reference points. The tampered section will exhibit a different pattern from the rest of the text.

===Forensic stylistics===
This discipline subjects written or spoken materials (or both), to scientific analysis for determination and measurement of content, meaning, speaker identification, or determination of authorship, in identifying [[plagiarism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How does forensic linguistics/stylistics work in criminal issues? Answers|website=enotes.com|url=http://www.enotes.com/forensic-science/linguistics-forensic-stylistics|date=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} cases where forensic stylistics was used to detect [[plagiarism]] was the case of [[Helen Keller]]'s short story "[[The Frost King]]", in which the blind American author was accused of [[plagiarism]] in 1892. An investigation revealed that [[The Frost King]] had been plagiarised from Margaret Canby's ''Frost Fairies'' which had been read to Keller some time earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jamenjivarblog.wordpress.com/2014/06/05/when-helen-froze-over/|title=WHEN HELEN FROZE OVER|accessdate=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that Keller had made only minute changes to common words and phrases and used less common words to say the same thing, suggesting mere alterations to original ideas.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Keller used 'vast wealth' instead of 'treasure' (approximately 230 times less common in the language) 'bethought' instead of 'concluded' (approximately 450 times less common), 'bade them' instead of 'told them' (approximately 30 times less common). Keller used the phrase 'ever since that time' whilst Canby chose 'from that time' (the latter 50 times more common than the former). Keller also used ' I cannot imagine' whereas Canby used ' I do not know'. 'Know' is approximately ten times more common than 'imagine'. Keller relied on a lexis that is less common when compared to Canby's. The Flesch and [[Flesch-Kincaid]] readability test showed that Canby's text showing more originality compared to Keller's. Canby's text obtained a higher grade on the reading ease scale compared to Keller's. The distinctions between Keller and Canby's text are at the lexical and phrasal level.

Other examples of plagiarism include the cases between [[Richard Condon]], author of [[The Manchurian Candidate]] and English novelist [[Robert Graves]] and between [[Martin Luther King Jr]] and Archibald Carey. Judging by the text in ''[[The Manchurian Candidate]]'', Condon's work is seen to be rich in clichés such as ''"in his superstitious heart of hearts."'' While [[Helen Keller]] took pride in using rare phrases and avoids common source words, Condon was fond of expanding existing words into phrases and existing phrases into more extensive ones. Condon was also found to have borrowed from a wide range of Graves' work.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008"/&gt; However, in the plagiarism case between [[Martin Luther King Jr]] and Archibald Carey, almost half of King's doctoral dissertation was discovered to have been copied from another theology student. King simply changed the names of the mountains and used much more [[alliteration]] and [[assonance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Boston U. Panel Finds Plagiarism by Dr. King | date= 11 October 1991|accessdate=2008-06-14|work=The New York Times|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEFD61030F932A25753C1A967958260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carey's and Graves' texts (source texts) were noticeably shorter, pithier and simpler in structure while Condon's and King's texts relied on 'purple' devices, extending the existing text and flourish their language significantly.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Another famous example is the case of [[Theodore Kaczynski]], who was eventually convicted of being the "Unabomber", family members recognized his writing style from the published 35,000-word ''[[wikisource:Industrial Society and Its Future|Industrial Society and Its Future]]'' (commonly called the "Unabomber Manifesto"), and notified the authorities. FBI agents searching Kaczynski's hut found hundreds of documents written by Kaczynski but not published anywhere. An analysis produced by FBI Supervisory Special Agent James R. Fitzgerald identified numerous lexical items and phrases common to the two documents.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald, J. R. (2004). "Using a forensic linguistic approach to tracking the Unabomber." In J. Campbell, &amp; D. DeNevi (Eds.)''Profilers: Leading investigators take you inside the criminal mind'' (pp. 193-222). New York: Prometheus Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Some were more distinctive than others, but the prosecution argued that even the more common words and phrases being used by Kaczynski became distinctive when used in combination with each other.&lt;ref name="Coulthard &amp; Johnson:2007" /&gt;

===Discourse analysis===
[[Discourse analysis]] deals with analyzing written, oral, or sign language use, or any significant [[semiotic]] event. According to the method, the close analysis of a covert recording can produce useful deductions. The use of 'I' instead of 'We' in a recording highlights non-complicity in a conspiracy. The utterance of 'yeah' and 'uh-huh' as responses indicate that the suspect understands the suggestion, while feedback markers such as 'yeah' and 'uh-huh' do not denote the suspect's agreement to the suggestion. Discourse analysts are not always allowed to testify but during preparation for a case they are often useful to lawyers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Linguistic dialectology===
This refers to the study of dialects in a methodological manner based on anthropological information. It is becoming more important to conduct systematic studies of dialects, especially within the English language, because they are no longer as distinct as they once were due to the onslaught of mass media and population mobility. Political and social issues have also caused languages to straddle geographical borders resulting in certain language varieties spoken in multiple countries, leading to complications when determining an individual's origin by means of his/her language or dialect.

Dialectology was used during the investigations into the [[Wearside Jack|Yorkshire Ripper tape hoax]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Fido (1994), ''The Chronicle of Crime: The infamous felons of modern history and their hideous crimes''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forensic phonetics===
The forensic phonetician is concerned with the production of accurate transcriptions of what was being said. Transcriptions can reveal information about a speaker's social and regional background. Forensic phonetics can determine similarities between the speakers of two or more separate recordings.  Voice recording as a supplement to the transcription can be useful as it allows victims and witnesses to indicate whether the voice of a suspect is that of the accused, i.e., alleged criminal.

A man accused of manufacturing the drug [[ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]] was mis-heard by the police transcriber as 'hallucinogenic'&lt;ref name="Coulthard &amp; Johnson:2007"&gt;Coulthard, M., &amp; Johnson, A. (2007). ''An introduction to forensic linguistics: Language in evidence''. Oxford: Routledge:162-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The police transcriber heard ''"but if it's as you say it's hallucinogenic, it's in the Sigma catalogue."'' However, the actual utterance was ''"but if it's as you say it's German, it's in the Sigma catalogue."''

Another disputed utterance was between a police officer and a suspect. One of the topics of conversation was a third man known as 'Ernie'. The poor signal of the recording made 'Ernie' sound like 'Ronnie'. The surveillance tape presented acoustic problems: an intrusive electronic-sounding cackle, the sound of the car engine, the playing of the car radio, the movement of the target vehicle, and the intrusive noise coincided with the first syllable of the disputed name.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008"/&gt;

[[Forensic speechreading]] is the complement of forensic voice identification. Transcripts of surveilled video records can sometimes allow expert speechreaders to identify speech content or style where the identity of the talker is apparent from the video record.

===Examples===
Evidence from forensic linguistics has more power to eliminate someone as a suspect than to prove him or her guilty.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Linguistic expertise has been employed in criminal cases to defend an individual suspected of a crime, and during government investigations. Forensic linguists have given expert evidence in a wide variety of cases, including abuse of process, where police statements were found to be too similar to have been independently produced by police officers; the authorship of [[hate mail]]; the authorship of letters to an Internet child pornography service; the contemporaneity of an arsonist's diary; the comparison between a set of mobile phone texts and a suspect's police interview, and the reconstruction of a mobile phone text conversation. Some well-known examples include an appeal against the conviction of [[Derek Bentley]] the identification of [[Subcomandante Marcos]], the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]]' charismatic leader by [[Max Appedole]] and the identification of [[Theodore Kaczynski]] as the so-called "[[Unabomber]]" by [[James R. Fitzgerald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/manhunt-unabomber-fbi-ted-kaczynski-james-fitzgerald-643594|title='Manhunt: Unabomber' explores how a federal investigator caught Ted Kaczynski and changed FBI profiling forever|date=2017-07-29|work=Newsweek|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criminal laboratories ''Bundeskriminalamt'' (in Germany) and the ''Nederlands Forensisch Instituut'' (in the [[Netherlands]]) both employ forensic linguists.&lt;ref name="Tiersma, Peter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.languageandlaw.org/FORENSIC.HTM|title=forensic linguistics|first=peter|last=tiersma|website=www.languageandlaw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forensic linguistics contributed to the overturning of [[Derek Bentley]]'s conviction for murder in 1998 although there were other non-linguistic issues. Nineteen-year-old Bentley, who was [[Functional illiteracy|functionally illiterate]], had been hanged in 1953 for his part in the murder of PC Sidney Miles; he had been convicted partly on the basis of his statement to police, allegedly transcribed verbatim from a spoken [[monologue]]. When the case was reopened, a forensic linguist found that the frequency and usage of the word "then" in police transcripts suggested the transcripts were not verbatim statements but had been partially authored by police interviewers; this and other evidence led to Bentley's posthumous pardon.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard, R.M. (2000). " ''Whose text is it? On the linguistic investigation of authorship'' ", in S. Sarangi and R.M. Coulthard: ''Discourse and Social Life''. London, Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;
During the investigative stage to identify Subcomandante Marcos, the [[Mexican government]] speculated that he was a dangerous guerrilla fighter. This theory gained much traction at the end of 1994, after the dissident Zapatista Comandante, Salvador Morales Garibay, gave away the identity of his former fellow Zapatistas to the Mexican government, among them Marcos' identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.letraslibres.com/sites/default/files/pdfs_articulos/pdf_art_5673_5540.pdf «El otro subcomandante»] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017111100/http://www.letraslibres.com/sites/default/files/pdfs_articulos/pdf_art_5673_5540.pdf |date=2013-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They all were indicted for terrorism, arrest warrants were issued and arrests were made in a military action.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5tZRlQk_8s»]&lt;/ref&gt; The Mexican government alleges some Zapatistas to be terrorists, among them Marcos. There was a storm of political pressures claiming for a fast military solution to the 1995 Zapatista Crisis. On February 9, 1995, in a televised special Presidential broadcast, President [[Ernesto Zedillo]] announced Subcomandante Marcos to be one Rafael Sebastián Guillén Vicente, born June 19, 1957, in [[Tampico]], [[Tamaulipas]] to [[Spain|Spanish]] immigrants, an [[Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana]] School of Sciences and Arts for the Design former Professor. And after the government revealed Marcos' identity in January 1995, when Max Appedole, old friend, classmate with the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] at the [[Instituto Cultural Tampico]], made direct intervention in the conflict. Appedole played a major role with the Mexican government to avoid a Military solution to the 1995 Zapatista Crisis, by demonstrating that contrary to the accusations announced by President Ernesto Zedillo,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzUQqpDptm8»]&lt;/ref&gt; Rafael Guillén, was no terrorist. Max Appedole identified Marcos' linguistic fingerprint based on Marcos' specific, unique way of speaking, recognized his literary style in all Marcos' manifestos that were published in the media, linked them to their literary tournaments organized by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] in which they competed in Mexico. Everyone has an [[idiolect]], encompassing vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation, that differs from the way other people talk. He confirmed that he had no doubt that Marcos was his friend Rafael Guillén, a pacifist. Max Appedole closed the first successful linguistic profiling confirmation case in the history of law enforcement. Based on these achievements this new science was developed, giving way to what is now called forensic linguistics. This motivated a new Division of forensic linguistics called Criminal Profiling in Law Enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/?p=243839|title=Marcos, en la mira de Zedillo - Proceso|date=5 August 2002|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://enlineadirecta.info/?option=view&amp;article=12183«Marcos Sí es Sebastián Guillén»]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buzos.com.mx/images/pdf/buzos195.pdf«La Otra Campana Pintada de Azul»]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hemeroteca.proceso.com.mx/?page_id=278958&amp;a51dc26366d99bb5fa29cea4747565fec=169802&amp;rl=wh« Maestros y condiscípulos de Tampico recuerdan a Rafael Guillén»]&lt;/ref&gt;

Forensic linguistic evidence also played a role in the investigation of the 2005 disappearance of Julie Turner, a 40-year-old woman living in [[Yorkshire]]. After she was reported missing, her partner received several [[text message]]s from Julie's mobile phone, such as "Stopping at jills, back later need to sort my head out", and "Tell kids not to worry. sorting my life out. (sic) be in touch to get some things".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/12/science/12file-text.html Speech Patterns in Messages Betray a Killer], Elizabeth Svoboda, ''[[New York Times]]'' May 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators found that letters written by Turner's friend Howard Simmerson shared several unusual orthographic and punctuation features with the text messages, suggesting that Simmerson had been aware of the contents of the messages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1197187/Dear-Garry-Ive-decided-end-The-stop-trapped-killer.html Dear Garry.

19-year old [[Murder of Jenny Nicholl|Jenny Nicholl]] disappeared on 30 June 2005. [[Murder conviction without a body|Her body was never found]], giving police and forensic scientists little information to go on about what might have happened to Jenny. After looking through her phone for clues, forensic linguists came to the conclusion that the texts sent from her phone around the time that she disappeared seemed very different than her usual texting style, and soon started looking to her ex-boyfriend, David Hodgson, for clues of what happened to her, including looking through his phone and studying his texting style. The forensic linguists found a number of stylistic similarities between David's texting style and the messages sent from Jenny's phone around the time she went missing. Using the timeframe of when she went missing, combined with the differences in texting styles and other forensic details, Jenny's [[Murder|murderer]], David Hodgson, was convicted. The analysis of the text messages and their submission in court helped to pave the way for forensic linguistics to be acknowledged as a science in UK law, rather than opinion. To this day, her body has not been found, but justice was still served for her and her family because of forensic linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mitchell|first1=Elizabeth|title=The case for forensic linguistics|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7600769.stm|work=BBC News|date=8 September 2008|access-date=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forensic linguist John Olsson gave evidence in a murder trial on the meaning of 'jooking' in connection with a stabbing.&lt;ref&gt;Trial of Rehan Asghar, Central Criminal Court, London, January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the appeal against the conviction of the [[Bridgewater Four]], the forensic linguist examined the written confession of Patrick Molloy, one of the defendants&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; a confession which he had retracted immediately&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; and a written record of an interview which the police claimed took place immediately before the confession was dictated. Molloy denied that the interview had ever taken place, and the analysis indicated that the answers in the interview were not consistent with the questions being asked. The linguist came to the conclusion that the interview had been fabricated by police. The conviction against the Bridgewater Four was quashed before the linguist in the case, Malcolm Coulthard, could produce his evidence.

In an Australian case reported by Eagleson, a "farewell letter" had apparently been written by a woman prior to her disappearance. The letter was compared with a sample of her previous writing and that of her husband. Eagleson came to the conclusion that the letter had been written by the husband of the missing woman, who subsequently confessed to having written it and to having killed his wife. The features analysed included sentence breaks, [[markedness|marked]] [[Thematic relation|themes]], and deletion of [[preposition]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Eagleson, Robert. (1994).

In 2015, there was a horrible house fire where a father was able to save his children, but his wife died in the house. The police thought that the fire was actually not an accident, but instead was a cover-up of the father murdering the mother. The forensic linguists were able to obtain the phone of both the father and mother, and realized that there were texts still being sent from the mother's phone the whole day – long after the police thought she had died. Using information from the two phones, the linguists were able to study the texting styles of both parents to see if they could obtain any more information about what happened that day. It turned out that the texts sent from the wife's phone were actually the husband pretending to be the wife so that no one would know she was murdered, and everyone would believe that she perished in the house fire. The forensic linguists were able to figure this out by studying the husband's texting style, spelling errors, and more, and were able to come to the conclusion that the texts sent after the wife was thought to be deceased, was actually the husband texting off her phone pretending to be her. Without this knowledge, it would have been much more difficult to convict the husband of [[Murder|murder]] and get justice for the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yvxmbk/forensic-linguists-use-spelling-mistakes-to-help-convict-criminals|title=Forensic Linguists Use Spelling Mistakes to Help Convict Criminals|date=9 April 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional concepts==

===Linguistic fingerprinting===
A linguistic fingerprint is a concept put forward by some scholars that each human being uses language differently, and that this difference between people involves a collection of markers which stamps a speaker/writer as unique; similar to a fingerprint. Under this view, it is assumed that every individual uses languages differently and this difference can be observed as a fingerprint.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008" /&gt;  It is formed as a result of merged language style. A person's linguistic fingerprint can be reconstructed from the individual's daily interactions and relate to a variety of self-reported personality characteristics, situational variables and physiological markers (e.g. blood pressure, cortisol, testosterone).&lt;ref&gt;Pennebaker, J. W. (1990). 'Physiological factors influencing the reporting of physical symptoms'. ''The Science of Self-report: Implications for Research and Practice.'' Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum Publishers, pp. 299-316&lt;/ref&gt; In the process of an investigation, the emphasis should be on the relative rather than absolute difference between the authors and how investigators can classify their texts. John Olsson, however, argues that although the concept of linguistic fingerprinting is attractive to law enforcement agencies, there is so far little hard evidence to support the notion.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008" /&gt;

===Variation===
Intra-author variations are the ways in which one author's texts differ from each other. Inter-author variations are the ways in which different authors' writing varies. Two texts by one author do not necessarily vary less than texts by two different authors.
*'''Genre:''' When texts are being measured in different genres, considerable variation is observed even though they are by the same author.
*'''Text Type:''' Personal letters contain more inter-relationship bonding strategies than academic articles or term papers.
*'''Fiction vs. Non-Fiction:''' Some fiction writers are journalists. Due to the different demands of each medium, they can be completely different from one another and this results in intra-author variation.
*'''Private vs Public:''' A politician writing a political speech, which is a public text,  will differ greatly from a private text to a friend or family member.
*'''Time lapse:''' The greater the time lapse between two works, the greater the likely variation. Language changes more than we realize in a relatively short span of time, influencing our susceptibility to language changes around us.
*'''Disguise:''' A writer can publish pseudonymously or anonymously, disguising output to prevent recognition.

===Forensic transcription===
The two main types of transcriptions are written documents and video and audio records. Accurate, reliable text transcription is important because the text is the data which becomes the available evidence. If a transcription is wrong, the evidence is altered. If there is failure to transcribe the full text, evidence is once again altered unwittingly. There must be emphasis on the text being the evidence. A transcription of an audio file should never be assumed to be completely accurate. Each type of transcription contains its own problems. A handwritten document might contain unusual spellings which may result in ambiguous meanings, illegible handwriting and illustrations that are difficult to comprehend. A scanned document is tricky, as it may alter the original document. Audio and video documents can include repetitions, hesitation, nonsensical talk, jargon which can be hard to understand and speakers mumbling incoherently and inaudibly. Non-linguistic sounds such as crying and laughing may also be included in the audio and video text which cannot be transcribed easily.  Because of this, civil libertarians argued that interrogations in major criminal cases should be recorded and the recordings kept, as well as transcribed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/15/opinion/recording-police-questioning.html | work=The New York Times | title=Recording Police Questioning | date=15 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''full screen effect''' (sometimes written as '''fullscreen effect''') is any graphics technique that is applied to the entire screen, usually after the rest of the image has been rendered. This is in contrast to effects that are applied to each element of an image&amp;mdash;such as a three-dimensional triangle&amp;mdash;as it is drawn.  The speed of applying a full screen effect is independent of the complexity of the image.

In 3D rendering applications such as video games, common full screen effects include [[color filter]]s, [[depth of field]], and [[full screen bloom]]. A color filter, for example, may desaturate an image or convert it to grayscale. These effects are usually achieved via 
GPU [[shader]]s.

'''Fuzzy cold dark matter''' is a hypothetical form of [[cold dark matter]] proposed to solve the [[cuspy halo problem]]. It would consist of extremely light [[scalar particle]]s with masses on the order of &lt;math&gt;\approx 10^{-22}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;eV. Fuzzy cold dark matter halos in dwarf galaxies would manifest wave behavior on astrophysical scales, and the cusps would be avoided through the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cold and Fuzzy Dark Matter|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.85.1158|year=2000|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=85|issue=6|pages=1158–61|pmid=10991501|arxiv=astro-ph/0003365|last1=Hu|first1=Wayne|last2=Barkana|first2=Rennan|last3=Gruzinov|first3=Andrei|bibcode = 2000PhRvL..85.1158H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Science Dive Program ==
The Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory was founded in cooperation with U. S. government's [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) in 1980.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/HURL/about.html|title=About Us|publisher=Hawaiʻi Undersea Research Laboratory|accessdate=January 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; HURL became a regional center in NOAA’s [[National Undersea Research Program]] (NURP). The University of Hawaii had been donated the submersible ''Makali’i'' (formerly ''Star II''), which launched HURL’s science dive program on July 14, 1981, with its first dive into the Oak Crater in Eniwetok Atoll. This three-month long expedition included scientists from the Defense Nuclear Agency, Lawrence Livermore Labs, and the Air Force Weapons Agency to conduct research on the effects of nuclear testing.&lt;ref&gt;Hawaii Undersea Research Lab Website. Accomplishments. http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/HURL/science/accomplishments.html&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1981, they spent nearly 9,000 hours underwater around the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2011/20110405_hurl.html|title=Students nationwide virtually participate in Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory's 1,000th Pisces submersible dive|date=2011-04-05|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; HURL has facilitated the long-term study of the [[Lōʻihi Seamount|Lo’ihi]] submarine volcano since 1987 and has analyzed its unique ecosystem and documented the growth of this new Hawaiian Island including investigation the collapse event in 1996. In 2005, they conducted a five-month expedition from Honolulu, Hawaii to New Zealand along the Tonga-[[Kermadec Islands|Kermadec]] arc during which they conducted 78 submersible dives and explored 13 different active volcanoes, 12 of which had never been explored before. In 2011, HURL made the first two-sub dive into Lo’ihi’s pit crater for a [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] documentary and celebrated 1,000 dives with the Pisces submersibles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ouramazingplanet.com/hawaii-undersea-dive-110406-1342/|title=Submersible Completes 1,000th Dive Off Hawaii|date=2011-04-06|publisher=OurAmazingPlanet|accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of March in 2012, NOAA zeroed out all funding to HURL and closed down its National Undersea Research Center (NURC, formerly NURP). All program assets owned by NOAA were gifted to the University of Hawaii.  The lab continued to operate on residual funding and on what limited funding that the University of Hawaii could provide. Anticipating this decline in funding, HURL resurrected some of their old technology by placing their Launch, Recovery, and Transport (LRT) back into service. The LRT-12 and the LRT-30a were submersible pontoon barges, that were used from 1981-1996 to launch the ''Makali’i'' and the ''Pisces'' ''V'' respectfully before the arrival of University of Hawaii research ship, ''Kai’imi’kai o’ Kanaloa'' (KOK). By returning to operating of the LRT-30a, the lab was able to reduce their day rate by nearly 70%, thus making them more attractive to potential customers. HURL continued to operate through the 2013 and 2014 dive seasons logging another 46 dives. Maritime Heritage and documentary dives contributed more needed financing, but it was evident that the University of Hawaii would be unable to financially carry the program for any duration without more outside support. By January 1, 2015, nearly all of HURL’s staff had been let go leaving only a few personnel to maintain the two submersibles.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;University of Hawai’I Undersea Research Lab@SOEST. HURL in Transition. https://www.unols.org/sites/default/files/201612desap19.pdfhttp://www.kitv.com/story/3144&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, a proposed science expedition to China had emerged, allowing HURL to proceed with its required refit on the ''Pisces IV'' and the addition of more operations personnel. The project was scheduled for March to July 2016. However, after completing their series of test dives and within two days of their scheduled departure, the project was “put on hold” indefinitely due to “increased tensions in the South China Sea”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the fall of 2016, new interest in the submersibles led to the first dives on [[Geologists Seamounts|Cook and McCall Seamounts]] and a return visit to the [[Lōʻihi Seamount|Lo’ihi Volcano]] funded by [[Conservation International]]. This successful exploration was immediately followed by two expeditions funded by the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) to the [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands|Northwest Hawaiian Islands]] and [[Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain|Emperor Seamounts]] in 2016 and 2017 consisting of 24 and 53 coral survey dives.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Hawaii Undersea Research Lab Archives. HURL Dives 1981 to Present.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Maritime Heritage Discoveries and Ordnance Surveys'' ===
[[File:Japanese mini sub.jpg|alt=Underwater image of the Japanese mini sub involved in the attack on Pearl Harbor.

On December 6, 1984 the submersible ''Makali’i'' came upon a fully intact Douglas SDB-5 Dauntless dive bomber. This aircraft was found 213 m deep off [[Koko Head]], Oahu during a science dive studying deep invertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;Hawaii Undersea Research Lab Archives. Maritime Heritage Database.&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft was videoed, surveyed, and subsequently its history was researched. The discovery kick-started a side program within the lab to continue the documenting the wreck sites of the various aircraft, ships, submarines, automobiles, and other miscellaneous remnants of Hawaii’s past that the submersibles encountered. HURL has since surveyed and researched more than 140 such sites. Nearly all of these were found during each year’s 3 preseason test and training dives. A number of these artifacts have been found to be of significant historic value, such as the Ward’s midget submarine and the mysterious “3-Piece” midget submarine that took part in the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|December 7th attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The giant seaplane “[[Martin JRM Mars|Marshall Mars]]”, the gunboat [[USS Bennington (PG-4)|USS ''Bennington'']], the cable-laying ship [[USS Kailua (IX-71)|USS ''Kailua'']], the Japanese fleet submarines [[I-400-class submarine|I-400]], [[Japanese submarine I-401|I-401]], [[I-124 Japanese submarine|I-124]], and [[I-201-class submarine|I-201]], and several turn-of-the-century Inter-island steamships have also been located and surveyed. Other artifacts discovered include over 25 WWII era landing craft ranging in size from 30’ LVT's to 330’ LST's, various aircraft as early as four 1931 Keystone PK-1 Seaplanes to WWII and [[Korean War]] era military planes to light engine civilian aircraft that went down in the 1980's and 90's.&lt;ref&gt;Hawaii Undersea Research Lab Archives. Maritime Heritage Database. Aircraft&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hawaii Undersea Research Lab Archives. Maritime Heritage Database. Ships&lt;/ref&gt; More than 60 automobiles have been found that were built from 1917 to the mid-1940's Including military trucks, construction equipment, hand cranked touring cars, and sedans. These vehicles are spread out over a 7 mile span off South Oahu.&lt;ref&gt;Hawaii Undersea Research Lab Archives. Maritime Heritage Database. Vehicles&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 3, 2009 HURL began a series of dives off South Oahu under contract with the [[United States Army|US Army]] to conduct an assessment of the chemical weapons disposed at sea after WWII.  The [[Hawaii Undersea Military Munitions Assessment]] (HUMMA) project consisted of 16 dives in 2009 and 14 dives in 2012. Although HURL has observed thousands of pieces of ordnance of numerous types over the past decades, the primary weapon of interest for this project was the M41A2 100-pound mustard gas bombs of which it is estimated that 16,000 were disposed of off Oahu. More than 100 of this particular type of bomb have been observed and several were selected for survey. Samples were collected from the sediment, water, and marine life in the immediate vicinity of these bombs. Other conventional weapons, and areas void of ordnance, were also surveyed for comparison.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== ''Salvage &amp; Special Projects'' ===
In addition to its traditional science dive program, HURL has also conducted a number of dives to locate and recover lost vehicles or instruments. This started with the recovery of the ''SeaMarc II'' lost off South Oahu in January 1989.  As of 2015, HURL had recovered eleven items from the deep sea with a 100% success rate. The submersibles have also been chartered by several non-academic organizations for various projects that range from pipeline inspections, sewer outfall surveys, cable route surveys, and numerous television documentaries. In 2011 and again in 2013, the ''Pisces V'' made dives in conjunction with technical divers. The submersible would pinpoint particular sites of interest and deploy a buoy with down line for the divers. This allowed the divers, who had a very limited bottom time, to make the most efficient use of their time on location and conduct operations that required more precise dexterity than the submersible manipulator arms can perform.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12622">'''Heritage conservation in Canada''' deals with actions or processes that are aimed at safeguarding the character-defining elements of a cultural resource so as to retain its heritage value and extend its physical life. Historic objects in [[Canada]] may be granted special designation by any of the three levels of government: the [[Government of Canada|federal government]], the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provincial governments]], or a [[local government in Canada|municipal government]].
The [[Heritage Canada Foundation]] acts as Canada's lead advocacy organization for heritage buildings and landscapes.

==Federal level==
There are a number of heritage designations at the federal level for historic sites in Canada:
* [[National Historic Sites of Canada]] are places that have been designated by the federal [[Minister of the Environment (Canada)|Minister of the Environment]] on the advice of the [[Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada]] (HSMBC), as being of national historic significance;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/docs/r/system-reseau/sec1/sites-lieux9.aspx |title=National Historic Sites of Canada System Plan - Introduction |author= |year=2000 |work= |publisher=Parks Canada |accessdate=August 23, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006084833/http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/docs/r/system-reseau/sec1/sites-lieux9.aspx |archivedate=October 6, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Heritage Railway Stations Protection Act|Heritage Railway Stations]] are train stations owned by federally licensed railway companies recommended for protection by the HSMBC; 
* [[Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act|Heritage Lighthouses]] are lighthouses deemed to be historically significant; and
* [[Federal Heritage Buildings Review Office|Federal Heritage Buildings]] are buildings owned by the federal government which are determined to be of historical and/or architectural value.

The federal government also operates related programs for the recognition of historic persons ([[Persons of National Historic Significance|National Historic Persons]]) and events ([[Events of National Historic Significance (Canada)|National Historic Events]]).

==Provinces==
[[File:Provincial historic resource of Alberta plaque.JPG|thumb|This [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] indicates that the building is protected by the [[Government of Alberta]]]]
Each provincial government has distinct systems and approaches to heritage conservation.  They may delegate the authority to preserve historic buildings to municipalities, and / or have a provincial [[heritage register]].

For example, in the province of [[Alberta]], only sites owned by the provincial government and run as a functioning historic site or museum are known as [[Provincial historic sites of Alberta|Provincial Historic Sites or Provincial Historic Areas]].  Buildings and sites owned by [[privately owned|private citizens and companies]] or [[Canadian federalism|other levels or branches of government]] may gain one of two levels of historic designation, "Registered Historic Resource" or "Provincial Historic Resource".&lt;ref&gt;[http://culture.alberta.ca/heritage/resourcemanagement/historicplacesstewardship/designation/default.aspx Alberta Culture and Community Spirit - Historic Resources Management - Historic Places Stewardship Section - Alberta's Historic Places Designation Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Historic designation in Alberta is governed by the Historic Resources Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qp.gov.ab.ca/Documents/acts/H09.CFM Alberta Queen's Printer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The province also lists buildings deemed historically significant by municipal governments on the Alberta Register of Historic Places, which is also part of the larger [[Canadian Register of Historic Places]] although this does not imply provincial or federal government status or protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://culture.alberta.ca/heritage/resourcemanagement/historicplacesstewardship/designation/municipal.aspx Alberta Culture and Community Spirit - Historic Resources Management - Historic Places Stewardship Section - Alberta's Historic Places Designation Program - Municipal Historic Resource Designation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205022849/http://culture.alberta.ca/heritage/resourcemanagement/historicplacesstewardship/designation/municipal.aspx |date=2010-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To supplement this system, the province also run the Alberta Main Street Program  which helps to preserve historic buildings in the [[downtown]]s of [[List of communities in Alberta|smaller communities]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albertamainstreet.org/ The Alberta Main Street Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623100324/http://albertamainstreet.org/ |date=2011-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The basis for the preservation system in Alberta is the Heritage Survey Program, which is a survey of 80,000 historic buildings in Alberta which lack a protected status but are documented for possible future protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://culture.alberta.ca/heritage/resourcemanagement/historicplacesstewardship/heritagesurveyprogram.aspx Alberta Culture and Community Spirit - Historic Resources Management - Historic Places Stewardship Section - Heritage Survey Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706164327/http://culture.alberta.ca/heritage/resourcemanagement/historicplacesstewardship/heritagesurveyprogram.aspx |date=2011-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Quebec]], the [[Répertoire du patrimoine culturel du Québec]] is the main heritage register, it includes both protected and unprotected properties.  The [[Conseil du patrimoine religieux du Québec]] is a non-profit organization created in 1995 to promote the conservation of churches and other religious heritage buildings in the province.&lt;ref name="patrimoine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patrimoine-religieux.qc.ca/en/organisme/mission.php|title=Conseil du patrimoine religieux du Québec|accessdate=2009-03-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621103711/http://www.patrimoine-religieux.qc.ca/en/organisme/mission.php|archivedate=2008-06-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Municipalities==
Cities, towns, counties and other [[local government in Canada]] may use [[zoning]] and other [[bylaws]] to restrict the demolition of individual historic buildings or districts.  They may maintain a municipal heritage register, such as [[Edmonton]]'s "Register of Historic Resources in Edmonton".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmonton.ca/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_0_284_220_0_43/http%3B/CMSServer/COEWeb/infrastructure+planning+and+building/Historic+Resources/ City of Edmonton&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The city of [[Vancouver]] uses a traditional heritage register&lt;ref&gt;[http://vancouver.ca/commsvcs/planning/heritage/Fact8.htm Vancouver.ca]&lt;/ref&gt; and a new system called a [[density bank]], under which developers are rewarded for preserving and restoring heritage buildings by being awarded exceptions to restrictions (usually height restrictions) on other sites they own.&lt;ref&gt;http://cityhallwatch.wordpress.com/special-topics/density-bank-transfers-and-more/&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Montreal]], one of Canada's oldest and most historically rich cities, the [[Le Conseil du patrimoine de Montréal]] advises the municipal government on matters related to heritage building preservation.&lt;ref name="Conseil du patrimoine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=2981,3122714&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL|title=Le Conseil du patrimoine de Montréal|publisher=City of Montreal|accessdate=2009-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pair of non-governmental groups have worked to preserve Montreal historic buildings since the 1970s: [[Save Montreal]], co-founded by [[Michael Fish (architect)|Michael Fish]] in 1974, and [[Heritage Montreal]], founded by [[Phyllis Lambert]] two years later.&lt;ref&gt;Gravenor, Kristian (October 23, 2003).

== Government approach to policy ==
Two of the primary conservation tools in Canada are the [[Canadian Register of Historic Places]] and the ''[[Standards and Guidelines for the Conservation of Historic Places in Canada]]''. This document  was the result of a major collaborative effort among federal, provincial, territorial and municipal governments, heritage conservation professionals, heritage developers and many individual Canadians.  A pan–Canadian collaboration, it is intended to reinforce the development of a culture of conservation in Canada, which will continue to find a unique expression in each of the jurisdictions and regions of the country.  In the document, conservation approaches are broken down into three categories: Preservation, Rehabilitation, and Restoration.  As published in the ''[[Standards and Guidelines for the Conservation of Historic Places in Canada]]'', these conservation approaches are defined as follows:&lt;ref name=terms&gt;[http://www.historicplaces.ca/nor-sta/request.aspx?page=sec2/page2b_e Standards and Guidelines - Definitions of Some Key Terms], ''Canada's Historic Places''. Retrieved 30 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Preservation:''' the action or process of protecting, maintaining, and/or stabilizing the existing materials, form, and integrity of a historic place or of an individual component, while protecting its heritage value. Preservation can include both short-term and interim measures to protect or stabilize the place, as well as long-term actions to retard deterioration or prevent damage so that the place can be kept serviceable through routine maintenance and minimal repair, rather than extensive replacement and new construction.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Rehabilitation:''' the action or process of making possible a continuing or compatible contemporary use of a historic place or an individual component, through repair, alterations, and/ or additions, while protecting its heritage value.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Restoration:''' the action or process of accurately revealing, recovering or representing the state of a historic place or of an individual component, as it appeared at a particular period in its history, while protecting its heritage value.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Jaan! in Hakui.jpg|thumb|An example of Japanese sound symbolism, "''jaan!''"]]
'''Ideophones''' are words that evoke an idea in sound, often a vivid impression of certain sensations or sensory perceptions, e.g. sound ([[onomatopoeia]]), movement, color, shape, or action. Ideophones are found in many of the world's [[language]]s, though they are claimed to be relatively uncommon in Western languages.&lt;ref&gt;Nuckolls 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  In many languages, they are a major lexical class of the same order of magnitude as nouns and verbs:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; dictionaries of languages like Japanese, Korean, and Zulu list thousands of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.lib.kobe-u.ac.jp/handle_gakui/D1004724|title=A Grammar of Sound-Symbolic Words in Japanese: Theoretical Approaches to Iconic and Lexical Properties of Japanese Mimetics|last=Akita|first=Kimi|publisher=Kobe University|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word class of ideophones is sometimes called ''phonosemantic'' to indicate that it is not a grammatical word class in the traditional sense of the word (like '[[verb]]' or '[[noun]]'), but rather a lexical class based on the special relation between form and meaning exhibited by ideophones. In the discipline of [[linguistics]], ideophones have long been overlooked or treated as mysterious words,&lt;ref&gt;Voeltz and Kilian-Hatz 2001:2&lt;/ref&gt; though a recent surge of interest in [[sound symbolism]], [[iconicity]] and linguistic diversity has brought them renewed attention.&lt;ref&gt;Imai &amp; Kita 2014, Dingemanse et al. 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

An often-cited definition of the notion of ideophone is the following by [[Clement Martyn Doke]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Doke 1935 as cited in Voeltz &amp; Kilian-Hatz 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|A vivid representation of an idea in sound. A word, often onomatopoeic, which describes a predicate, qualificative or adverb in respect to manner, color, sound, smell, action, state or intensity.}}

Ideophones evoke sensory events. A well known instance of ideophones are [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] words – words that imitate the sound (of the event) they refer to. Some ideophones may be derived from onomatopoeic notions. A case in point is the English ideophonic verb ''to tinkle'', which imitates a brief metallic sound. In many languages, however, ideophones go far beyond onomatopoeia in imitating many things beyond sound.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For instance, in [[Gbaya languages|Gbaya]],  ''kpuk '''a rap on the door' may be onomatopoeic, but other ideophones depict motion and visual scenes: ''loɓoto-loɓoto'' 'large animals plodding through mud', ''kiláŋ-kiláŋ'' 'in a zigzagging motion', ''pɛɗɛŋ-pɛɗɛŋ'' 'razor sharp'.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Ideophones are often characterized as [[Iconicity|iconic]] or [[Sound symbolism|sound-symbolic]] words, meaning that there can be a resemblance between their form and their meaning. For instance, in West-African languages, voiced consonants and low tone in ideophones are often connected to large and heavy meanings, whereas voiceless consonants and high tones tend to relate to small and light things.&lt;ref&gt;Westermann 1927&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reduplication]] figures quite prominently in ideophones, often conveying a sense of repetition or plurality present in the evoked event.&lt;ref&gt;Watson in Voeltz &amp; Kilian-Hatz 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The iconicity of ideophones is shown by the fact that people can guess the meanings of ideophones from various languages at a level above chance.&lt;ref&gt;Iwasaki et al. 2007, Dingemanse et al. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; However, not everything about the form of ideophones directly relates to their meaning; as conventionalized words, they contain arbitrary, language-specific phonemes just like other parts of the vocabulary.

===Grammar===
The grammatical function of ideophones varies by language. In some languages (e.g. [[Welayta language|Welayta]], [[Yir-Yoront language|Yir-Yiront]], [[Semai language|Semai]], [[Korean language|Korean]]), they form a separate word class, while in others, they occur across a number of different word classes (e.g. [[Mundang]], [[Ewe language|Ewe]], [[Sotho language|Sotho]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]]).&lt;ref&gt;Voeltz &amp; Kilian-Hatz 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this diversity, ideophones show a number of robust regularities across languages. One is that they are often marked in the same way as quoted speech and demonstrations.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Samarin|first=William J.|year=1971|title=Survey of Bantu ideophones|url=|journal=African Language Studies|volume=12|pages=130–168|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes ideophones can form a complete utterance on their own, as in English "ta-da!" or Japanese {{Nihongo||ジャーン|jaan|ta-da}}.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Diffloth 1972&lt;/ref&gt; However, ideophones also often occur within utterances, depicting a scene described by other elements of the utterance, as in Japanese ''Taro wa &lt;u&gt;sutasuta to&lt;/u&gt; haya-aruki o si-ta'' 'Taro walked hurriedly' (literally 'Taro did haste-walk ''sutasuta''&lt;nowiki/&gt;').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kita|first=Sotaro|year=1997|title=Two-dimensional semantic analysis of Japanese mimetics|url=|journal=Linguistics|volume=35|pages=379–415|via=|doi=10.1515/ling.1997.35.2.379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether they occur as part of other utterances or on their own, ideophones tend show a high degree of grammatical independence. They often occur at the edge of the utterance; they may be syntactically optional; and they tend to carry little inflectional or derivational morphology.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Other signs of their relative independence are that they are often produced with higher intonation and expressive lengthening, and set off from the rest of the utterance by a brief pause.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Kunene in Voeltz &amp; Kilian-Hatz 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their relative independence, ideophones are sometimes compared to [[interjection]]s: direct expressions of emotions like "Wow!" or "Ouch!". However, they are distinct in a number of ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ameka|first=Felix K.|year=1992|title=Interjections: the universal yet neglected part of speech|url=|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|volume=18|pages=101–118|via=|doi=10.1016/0378-2166(92)90048-g}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas interjections usually occur on their own, ideophones more often modify other utterances, providing an illustration of a scene the utterance is about. Also, ideophones are more like illustrations ''of'' events than responses ''to'' events. An ideophone like Gbaya ''kiláŋ-kiláŋ'' 'in a zigzagging motion' displays a certain resemblance to the event (for instance, its irregular vowels and tones depicting the irregularity of the motion). An interjection like 'Wow!' indexes someone's response to an event but does not resemble that event itself.

===Registers===
Languages may differ in the context in which ideophones are used. In some languages, ideophones are primarily used in spoken language (e.g. [[narrative]] contexts) and are rarely encountered in written language.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Noss in Voeltz &amp; Kilian-Hatz 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In other languages (e.g. [[Ewe language|Ewe]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]]), ideophones can be freely used in all [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]]. In general, however, ideophones tend to occur more extensively in spoken language because of their expressive or dramaturgic function.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Examples==

===[[English language|English]]===

* ''boing''; the sound of a spring being released
* ''boom''; the sound of an explosion
* ''bang''; the sound of a gunshot
* ''[[bling-bling]]''; glitter, sparkle
* ''pitter-patter''; the sound of rain drops
* ''swish''; the sound of swift movement
* ''splish-splash''; the sound of water splashing
* ''ta-daa!''; the sound of a [[fanfare]]
* ''thud''; the sound of something heavy falling on the ground
* ''tick-tock''; the sound of time passing
* ''twinkle''; the glow of something sparkling or shiny

The Japanese language has thousands of ideophones, often called ''mimetics''. The constructions are quite metrical 2-2, or 3-3, where [[Mora (linguistics)|morae]] play a role in the symmetry. The first consonant of the second item of the reduplication [[rendaku|may become voiced]] if phonological conditions allow. Japanese ideophones are used extensively in daily conversations as well as in the written language.

* ''doki doki'' ({{lang|ja|ドキドキ}}) &amp;mdash; heartbeat: excitement
* ''kira kira'' ({{lang|ja|キラキラ}}) &amp;mdash; glitter
* ''shiin'' ({{lang|ja|シーン}}) &amp;mdash; silence
* ''niko niko'' ({{lang|ja|ニコニコ}}) &amp;mdash; smile

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6557">The '''International Institute of Agriculture''' (IIA) was founded in [[Rome]] in 1905 by the [[King of Italy]] [[Victor Emmanuel III]] with the intent of creating a clearinghouse for collection of agricultural statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hobson|first=Asher|title=The International Institute of Agriculture|place=Berkeley|publisher=University of California Press|year=1931}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created primarily due to the efforts of [[David Lubin]].  In 1930, the IIA published the first world agricultural census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Estabrook|first=Leon M.|title=Life of an American: Memoirs of Leon M. Estabrook|place=Washington: unpublished manuscript (held in Special Collections, [[National Agricultural Library]], call number 120 Es8 R)|year=1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After [[World War II]], both its assets and mandate were handed over to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) of the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name="fao"&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Conference of FAO, First Session, City of Quebec, Canada, October 16 to November 1, 1945|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/x5584e/x5584e00.htm|year=1945|work=Appendix I|publisher=FAO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1904 the idea of such an institute came to [[David Lubin]] of [[Sacramento, California]], and his project found favor with the king of Italy. The latter gave a building in Rome and an annual income of $60,000. The king called the first congress in 1906, and delegates attended from 40 countries. At the congress, a treaty was formed making the institute a permanent organization and defining its scope and activities.&lt;ref name=amer&gt;{{Americana|wstitle=International Institute of Agriculture|inline=1}} This work in turn cites Senate Document No. 196, 63d Congress, First Session (Washington 1913).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==
The government of the IIA was vested in the general assembly of delegates from affiliated countries, meeting every two years, and in a permanent executive committee, on which there was one representative from each country. This permanent committee had direct charge of the IIA. The general officers were the president (also chairman of the permanent committee), the vice president and the secretary general.&lt;ref name=amer/&gt;

The work of the institute was divided among four bureaus:&lt;ref name=amer/&gt;

#''Bureau of the secretary general'' had charge of the personnel, financial and other routine business, the building and its equipment, the printing and distribution of publications, the library and general bibliographical work, and, as a more recent service, the preparation and publication of an annual compilation of agricultural legislation in the different countries of the world.
#''Bureau of general [[statistics]]'' collected, collated and published statistics of production and commerce in agricultural products, both animal and vegetable, throughout the world.
#''Bureau of agricultural intelligence and plant diseases'' collected and published information regarding the progress of scientific and experimental investigations and practical experience in agriculture throughout the world and, as a branch of this work, gives special attention to the diseases of plants and to [[entomology]].
#''Bureau of economic and social institutions'' collected and published statistics and general information regarding agricultural co-operation, insurance and credit, together with other matters relating to the economic and social organization of rural communities.

The annual budget of the institute was $250,000 (c. 1915), contributed by the adhering governments on the basis of a number of units assigned to each country.&lt;ref name=amer/&gt;

==Publications==
Those publications of the IIA which had a bearing on the formation of the price of the staples (such as crop reports and data on exports, imports and stocks) were based exclusively on official information, supplied direct to the institute by the adhering governments. Other publications were produced from (a) information officially communicated by the governments, (b) original articles contributed by eminent authorities designated by the adhering governments, (c) excerpts and abstracts of articles translated from the 2,225 official and unofficial periodical publications of the world received by the IIA.&lt;ref name=amer/&gt;

The IIA printed and published two annuals and three monthly and one weekly bulletins, together with a considerable number of monographs on special subjects. The annuals dealt with agricultural statistics and legislation, respectively. The monthly bulletins were on (a) agricultural statistics (b) agricultural intelligence and diseases of plants, and (c) economic and social institutions, and the weekly bulletin is bibliographical. The monthly bulletins were published in [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]. French being the official language of the IIA, the editions in that language were paid for from the funds of the Institute.&lt;ref name=amer/&gt;

Provision for the edition in the other languages was made by the countries interested. The [[congress of the United States]] made an annual appropriation of $5,000 (c. 1915) for translating and printing the English edition, the rest of the expense being borne by [[Great Britain]] and her colonies.&lt;ref name=amer/&gt;

==Library==
The IIA collected a great library of agricultural literature. As the IIA became more firmly established and its value as an international [[wikt:clearing house|clearing house]] on economic information was more generally recognized, it was met with a constantly increasing demand for the extension of its service along many lines.&lt;ref name=amer/&gt;
After the IIA ceased operations in 1945, its library collection was transferred to [http://www.fao.org/library David Lubin Memorial Library] (DLML) of the FAO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5142e.pdf|title=70 years of FAO|last=|first=|date=2015|website=fao.org|format=PDF|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DLML is open to external visitors.

[[File:Stop Defacing Signs.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A [[stop sign]] ironically defaced with a plea ''not'' to deface stop signs.]]

'''Irony''' ({{ety|grc|''εἰρωνεία'' eirōneía|dissimulation, feigned ignorance}}&lt;ref&gt;Liddell &amp; Scott, ''[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]'', v. sub {{lang|grc|εἰρωνεία}}.&lt;/ref&gt;), in its broadest sense, is a [[rhetorical device]], [[literary technique]], or event in which what appears, on the surface, to be the case, differs radically from what is actually the case. 

Irony can be categorized into different types, including: ''verbal irony'', ''dramatic irony'', and ''situational irony''. Verbal, dramatic, and situational irony are often used for emphasis in the assertion of a truth. The ironic form of [[simile]], used in [[sarcasm]], and some forms of [[litotes]] can emphasize one's meaning by the deliberate use of language which states the opposite of the truth, denies the contrary of the truth, or drastically and obviously understates a factual connection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Compass_of_Irony.html?id=7PsNAAAAQAAJ Muecke, DC., ''The Compass of Irony'', Routledge, 1969. p. 80]&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms, as identified by historian [[Connop Thirlwall]], include dialectic and practical irony.&lt;ref name="NPE" /&gt;

==Definitions==
[[Henry Watson Fowler]], in ''[[The King's English]]'', says, "any definition of irony—though hundreds might be given, and very few of them would be accepted—must include this, that the surface meaning and the underlying meaning of what is said are not the same." Also, Eric Partridge, in ''[[Eric Partridge|Usage and Abusage]]'', writes that "Irony consists in stating the contrary of what is meant."

The use of irony may require the concept of a ''double audience''. Fowler's ''[[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]'' says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Irony is a form of utterance that postulates a double audience, consisting of one party that hearing shall hear &amp; shall not understand, &amp; another party that, when more is meant than meets the ear, is aware both of that more &amp; of the outsiders' incomprehension.&lt;ref name="Fowler, HW 1926"&gt;Fowler, H. W., ''A Dictionary of Modern English Usage'', 1926.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term is sometimes used as a synonym for ''incongruous'' and applied to "every trivial oddity" in situations where there is no double audience.&lt;ref name="Fowler, HW 1926"/&gt; An example of such usage is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Arthur Sullivan|Sullivan]], whose real interest was, ironically, serious music, which he composed with varying degrees of success, achieved fame for his comic opera scores rather than for his more earnest efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Gassner, J., Quinn, E., ''The Reader's Encyclopedia of World Drama'', Courier Dover Publications, 2002, p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]''{{'s}} secondary meaning for ''irony'': "incongruity between what might be expected and what actually occurs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/irony |title="irony" at dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218045412/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/irony |archivedate=2010-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This sense, however, is not synonymous with "incongruous" but merely a definition of dramatic or situational irony. {{Anchor|Incongruity_plus_human_folly}} It is often included in definitions of irony ''not only'' that incongruity is present ''but also'' that the incongruity must reveal some aspect of human vanity or folly. Thus the majority of ''American Heritage Dictionary'''s usage panel found it unacceptable to use the word ''ironic'' to describe mere unfortunate coincidences or surprising disappointments that "suggest no particular lessons about human vanity or folly."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''The Free Dictionary'' under ''ironic'': http://www.thefreedictionary.com/ironic&lt;/ref&gt;

On this aspect, ''[[The Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (''OED'') has also:&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Oxford English Dictionary]]'', "irony" entry, second definition.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|1=A condition of affairs or events of a character opposite to what was, or might naturally be, expected; a contradictory outcome of events as if in mockery of the promise and fitness of things. (In French, ''ironie du sort'').}}

==Origin of the term==
According to ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=irony |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/294609/irony |accessdate=18 September 2014 |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150212010710/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/294609/irony |archive-date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
{{Quote|1=The term irony has its roots in the Greek comic character [[Eiron]], a clever underdog who by his wit repeatedly triumphs over the boastful character [[Alazon]]. The Socratic irony of the [[Platonic dialogues]] derives from this comic origin.}}

According to Richard Whately:&lt;ref&gt;Whately, Richard; "Rhetoric", ''Encyclopedia Metropolitan'', I. 265/1; 1845 (cited in the ''OED'' entry)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=[[Aristotle]] mentions ''Eironeia'', which in his time was commonly employed to signify, not according to the modern use of 'Irony, saying the contrary to what is meant', but, what later writers usually express by [[Litotes]], i.e. 'saying less than is meant'.}}

The word came into English as a [[figure of speech]] in the 16th century as similar to the French ''ironie''. It derives from the Latin ''ironia'' and ultimately from the Greek ''εἰρωνεία'' eirōneía, meaning ''dissimulation, ignorance purposely affected''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''The Oxford English Dictionary'', "irony" entry.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
[[File:Situational irony - Baker Street tube station.jpg|thumb|A "No smoking" sign surrounded by images of a smoking [[Sherlock Holmes]] at [[Baker Street tube station]]]]

''The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics'' distinguishes between the following types of irony:&lt;ref name="NPE"&gt;Preminger, A. &amp; Brogan, T. V. F. Brogan, 
''The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics'', MJF Books, 1993, {{ISBN|9780691032719}},  pp. 633–635.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Classical''' irony: Referring to the origins of irony in Ancient Greek comedy, and the way classical and medieval rhetoricians delineated the term.
*'''Romantic''' irony: A self-aware and self-critical form of fiction.
*'''Cosmic''' irony: A contrast between the absolute and the relative, the general and the individual, which Hegel expressed by the phrase, "general [irony] of the world."&lt;ref name="NPE" /&gt;
*'''Verbal''' irony: A contradiction between a statement's stated and intended meaning
*'''Situational''' irony: The disparity of intention and result; when the result of an action is contrary to the desired or expected effect.
*'''Dramatic''' irony and '''tragic''' irony: A disparity of awareness between an actor and an observer: when words and actions possess significance that the listener or audience understands, but the speaker or character does not; for example when a character says to another "I'll see you tomorrow!" when the audience (but not the character) knows that the character will die before morning. It is most often used when the author causes a character to speak or act erroneously, out of ignorance of some portion of the truth of which the audience is aware. In tragic irony, the audience knows the character is making a mistake, even as the character is making it.

===Verbal irony===
According to ''A glossary of literary terms'' by Abrams and Hartman,&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Verbal irony''' is a statement in which the meaning that a speaker employs is sharply different from the meaning that is ostensibly expressed. An ironic statement usually involves the explicit expression of one attitude or evaluation, but with indications in the overall speech-situation that the speaker intends a very different, and often opposite, attitude or evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;Abrams, M. H., &amp; Harpham, G. G., ''A glossary of literary terms'', 9th Ed., Wadsworth Cengage Learning, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Verbal irony is distinguished from situational irony and dramatic irony in that it is produced ''intentionally'' by speakers. For instance, if a man exclaims, "I'm not upset!" but reveals an upset [[emotional]] state through his voice while truly trying to claim he's not upset, it would not be verbal irony by virtue of its verbal manifestation (it would, however, be situational irony). But if the same speaker said the same words and intended to communicate that he was upset by claiming he was not, the utterance would be verbal irony. This distinction illustrates an important aspect of verbal irony—speakers communicate implied propositions that are intentionally contradictory to the propositions contained in the words themselves. There are, however, examples of verbal irony that do not rely on saying the opposite of what one means, and there are cases where all the traditional criteria of irony exist and the utterance is not ironic.

In a clear example from literature, in Shakespeare's ''Julius Caesar'', Mark Antony's speech after the assassination of Caesar appears to praise the assassins, particularly Brutus ("But Brutus says he was ambitious; / And Brutus is an honourable man"), while actually condemning them. "We're left in no doubt as to who's ambitious and who's honourable. The literal truth of what's written clashes with the perceived truth of what's meant to revealing effect, which is irony in a nutshell".
&lt;ref&gt;
Horberry, R., ''Sounds Good on Paper: How to Bring Business Language to Life'', A&amp;amp;C Black, 2010. p. 135. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Sounds_Good_on_Paper.html?id=rlBIvHRkExsC] 
&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironic [[simile#irony|similes]] are a form of verbal irony where a speaker intends to communicate the opposite of what they mean. For instance, the following explicit similes begin with the deceptive formation of a statement that means ''A'' but that eventually conveys the meaning ''not A'':
* as soft as concrete
* as clear as mud
* as pleasant as a [[Endodontic therapy|root canal]]
* "as pleasant and relaxed as a coiled rattlesnake" (Kurt Vonnegut from ''[[Breakfast of Champions]]'')

The irony is recognizable in each case only by using knowledge of the source concepts (e.g., that mud is opaque, that root canal surgery is painful) to detect an incongruity.

====Verbal irony and sarcasm====
A fair amount of confusion has surrounded the issue of the relationship between verbal irony and [[sarcasm]].

Fowler's ''[[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]'' states: &lt;blockquote&gt;Sarcasm does not necessarily involve irony and irony has often no touch of sarcasm. &lt;/blockquote&gt;This suggests that the two concepts are linked but may be considered separately. ''The Oxford English Dictionary''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'s entry for [[sarcasm]] does not mention irony, but the irony entry includes:
{{Quote|1=A figure of speech in which the intended meaning is the opposite of that expressed by the words used; usually taking the form of sarcasm or ridicule in which laudatory expressions are used to imply condemnation or contempt.}}

The ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' has "Non-literary irony is often called sarcasm"; while the ''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'' entry is:
{{Quote|1=Sarcasm: 1&amp;thinsp;: a sharp and often satirical or ironic utterance designed to cut or give pain. 2 a&amp;thinsp;: a mode of satirical wit depending for its effect on bitter, caustic, and often ironic language that is usually directed against an individual.}}

Partridge in ''[[Usage and Abusage]]'' would separate the two forms of speech completely: &lt;blockquote&gt;
Irony must not be confused with sarcasm, which is direct: sarcasm means precisely what it says, but in a sharp, caustic, ... manner. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The psychologist Martin, in ''The Psychology of Humour'', is quite clear that irony is where "the literal meaning is opposite to the intended" and sarcasm is "aggressive humor that pokes fun".&lt;ref&gt;Martin, R. A., ''The Psychology of Humor: An Integrative Approach'', Elsevier Academic Press, 2007. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; He has the following examples: for irony he uses the statement "What a nice day" when it is raining. For sarcasm, he cites [[Winston Churchill]], who is supposed to have said, when told by [[Bessie Braddock]] that he was drunk, "But I shall be sober in the morning, and you will still be ugly", as being sarcastic, while not saying the opposite of what is intended.

Psychology researchers Lee and Katz (1998) have addressed the issue directly. They found that ridicule is an important aspect of sarcasm, but not of verbal irony in general. By this account, sarcasm is a particular kind of personal criticism levelled against a person or group of persons that incorporates verbal irony. For example, a woman reports to her friend that rather than going to a medical doctor to treat her cancer, she has decided to see a spiritual healer instead. In response her friend says sarcastically, "Oh, brilliant, what an ingenious idea, that's really going to cure you." The friend could have also replied with any number of ironic expressions that should not be labeled as sarcasm exactly, but still have many shared elements with sarcasm.

Most instances of verbal irony are labeled by research subjects as sarcastic, suggesting that the term ''sarcasm'' is more widely used than its technical definition suggests it should be (Bryant &amp; Fox Tree, 2002; Gibbs, 2000). Some [[psycholinguistic]] theorists (e.g., Gibbs, 2000) suggest that [[sarcasm]] ("Great idea!", "I hear they do fine work."), [[hyperbole]] ("That's the best idea I have heard in years!"), [[understatement]] ("Sure, what the hell, it's only cancer..."), [[rhetorical question]]s ("What, does your spirit have cancer?"), [[double entendre]] ("I'll bet if you do that, you'll be communing with spirits in no time...") and [[jocularity]] ("Get them to fix your bad back while you're at it.") should all be considered forms of verbal irony. The differences between these rhetorical devices ([[trope (literature)|tropes]]) can be quite subtle and relate to typical emotional reactions of listeners, and the rhetorical goals of the speakers. Regardless of the various ways theorists categorize figurative language types, people in conversation who are attempting to interpret speaker intentions and discourse goals do not generally identify, by name, the kinds of tropes used (Leggitt &amp; Gibbs, 2000).

====Verbal irony and echoic allusion====
Echoic allusion is the main component involved in conveying verbally ironic meaning. It is best described as a [[speech act]] by which the speaker simultaneously represents a thought, belief or idea, and implicitly attributes this idea to someone else who is wrong or deluded. In this way, the speaker intentionally dissociates themselves from the idea and conveys their tacit dissent, thereby providing a different meaning to their utterance. In some cases, the speaker can provide stronger dissociation from the represented thought by also implying derision toward the idea or outwardly making fun of the person or people they attribute it to.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Deirdre. "The Pragmatics Of Verbal Irony: Echo Or Pretence?." Lingua 116.10 (2006): 1722-1743.&lt;/ref&gt;

Echoic allusion, like other forms of verbal irony, relies on semantically disambiguating cues to be interpreted correctly. These cues often come in the form of [[paralanguage|paralinguistic markers]] such as prosody, tone, or pitch,&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, Gregory A., and Jean E. Fox Tree. "Recognizing Verbal Irony in Spontaneous Speech." Metaphor and Symbol 17.2 (2002): 99-119. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[nonverbal communication|nonverbal cues]] like hand gesture, facial expression and eye gaze.&lt;ref&gt;González-Fuente, Santiago, Victoria Escandell-Vidal, and Pilar Prieto. "Gestural Codas Pave The Way To The Understanding Of Verbal Irony." Journal of Pragmatics 90.(2015): 26-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of echoic allusion and its disambiguating paralinguistic markers is as follows:
* Person 1: I wasn't going to eat the cake, you know.
* Person 2: Interesting, that's what it looked like you were doing, but I just must have been mistaken.
From simple semantic analysis, Person 2 appears to believe Person 1. However, if this conversation is given the context of Person 2 walking in on Person 1 about to eat some cake, and Person 2 speaking their sentence in a significantly decreased rate of speech and lowered tone, the interpretation of "I just must have been mistaken" changes. Instead of being taken as Person 2 believing Person 1, the utterance calls to mind someone who would believe Person 1, while also conveying Person 2's implication that said individual would be considered gullible. From this, Person 2 negates the possible interpretation that they believe Person 1.

===Dramatic irony===
Dramatic irony exploits the device of giving the spectator an item of information that at least one of the characters in the narrative is unaware of (at least consciously), thus placing the spectator a step ahead of at least one of the characters. [[Connop Thirlwall]] in his 1833 article ''On the Irony of [[Sophocles]]'' originally highlighted the role of irony in drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/irony.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604184251/http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/irony.htm |archivedate=2016-06-04 |df= }}; cf. G.M. Kirkwood, ''A Study of Sophoclean Drama'', p. 258: "The now familiar concept of 'dramatic irony' was originally developed in an early nineteenth century article, "On the Irony of Sophocles," by the English scholar Connop Thirlwall, who explains that in a play the sequence of events can lead to two different interpretations of the action so far: the situation as it appears to the characters in the play, and to the situation as it really is."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thirlwall's original article appears in ''Philological Museum'' (edited by J.C. Hare), vol. 2, pp. 483-537, available at https://archive.org/details/philologicalmus01haregoog&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Oxford English Dictionary'' defines dramatic irony as:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;
{{Quote|1=the incongruity created when the (tragic) significance of a character's speech or actions is revealed to the audience but unknown to the character concerned; the literary device so used, orig. in Greek tragedy.}}

According to Stanton,&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, R., "Dramatic Irony in Hawthorne's Romances", ''Modern Language Notes'', Vol. 71, No. 6 (Jun., 1956), pp. 420–426, The Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; dramatic irony has three stages—installation, exploitation, and resolution (often also called preparation, suspension, and resolution)
—producing dramatic conflict in what one character relies or appears to rely upon, the ''contrary'' of which is known by observers (especially the audience; sometimes to other characters within the drama) to be true. In summary, it means that the reader/watcher/listener knows something that one or more of the characters in the piece is not aware of.

For example:
* In ''[[City Lights]]'', the audience knows that [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s character is not a millionaire, but the blind flower girl ([[Virginia Cherrill]]) believes him to be rich.&lt;ref&gt;
Clausius, C., ''The Gentleman Is a Tramp: Charlie Chaplin's Comedy'', P. Lang, 1989, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[North by Northwest]]'', the audience knows that Roger Thornhill ([[Cary Grant]]) is not Kaplan; Vandamm ([[James Mason]]) and his accomplices do not. The audience also knows that Kaplan is a fictitious agent invented by the CIA; Roger (initially) and Vandamm (throughout) do not.&lt;ref&gt;Gulino, P., ''Screenwriting: The Sequence Approach'', Continuum, 2004, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[Othello]]'', the audience knows that Desdemona has remained faithful to Othello, but Othello does not. The audience also knows that Iago is scheming to bring about Othello's downfall, a fact hidden from Othello, Desdemona, Cassio, and Roderigo.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, W. C., ''A Rhetoric of Irony'', University of Chicago Press, 1974, p. 63. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/A_Rhetoric_of_Irony.html?id=jbgufPEUD6QC]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In "[[The Cask of Amontillado]]", the reader knows that Montresor is planning on murdering Fortunato, while Fortunato believes they are friends.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe, Edgar Allan]], ''[[The Cask of Amontillado]]'', The Creative Company, 2008, pp. 22–23.
[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Cask_of_Amontillado.html?id=4b6PnHfQ1y8C]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[The Truman Show]]'', the viewer realizes that Truman is on a television show, but Truman himself only gradually learns this.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, A., ''Parallel Lives of Jesus: A Guide to the Four Gospels'', Presbyterian Publishing Corp, 2011, p. 30.

====Tragic irony====
Tragic irony is a special category of dramatic irony. In tragic irony, the words and actions of the characters contradict the real situation, which the spectators fully realize. ''The Oxford English Dictionary'' defines this as:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;
{{Quote|the incongruity created when the (tragic) significance of a character's speech or actions is revealed to the audience but unknown to the character concerned, the literary device so used, orig. in Greek tragedy.}}

[[Theatre of ancient Greece|Ancient Greek drama]] was especially characterized by tragic irony because the audiences were so familiar with the [[legend]]s that most of the plays dramatized. [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' provides a classic example of tragic irony at its fullest. Colebrook writes:&lt;ref&gt;Colebrook, Claire. ''Irony''. London and New York: Routledge, 2004, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|1=Tragic irony is exemplified in ancient drama.... The audience watched a drama unfold, already knowing its destined outcome.... In Sophocles' ''Oedipus the King'', for example, 'we' (the audience) can see what Oedipus is blind to. The man he murders is his father, but he does not know it.}}

Further, Oedipus vows to find the murderer and curses him for the plague that he has caused, not knowing that the murderer he has cursed and vowed to find is himself. The audience knows that Oedipus himself is the murderer that he is seeking; Oedipus, Creon, and Jocasta do not.&lt;ref&gt;Storey, I. C.; Allan, A.; ''A Guide to Ancient Greek Drama'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008, p. 125. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/A_Guide_to_Ancient_Greek_Drama.html?id=z2t1cIVk-A8C]&lt;/ref&gt;

Irony has some of its foundation in the onlooker's perception of [[paradox]] that arises from insoluble problems. For example, in the [[William Shakespeare]] play ''Romeo and Juliet'', when Romeo finds Juliet in a drugged, deathlike sleep, he assumes her to be dead. The audience knows that Juliet has faked her death, yet Romeo believes she is truly dead, and commits suicide. Upon awakening to find her dead lover beside her, Juliet stabs herself with a dagger thus killing herself, too.&lt;ref&gt;William, J., ''Cliffs Complete Romeo and Juliet'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2009, pp. 135, 169, 181. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/CliffsComplete_Romeo_and_Juliet.html?id=c7MyAImulJ0C]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Situational irony===
Situational irony is a relatively modern use of the term, and describes a sharp discrepancy between the expected result and actual results in a certain situation.
Lars Elleström writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;''Situational irony'' ... is most broadly defined as a situation where the outcome is incongruous with what was expected, but it is also more generally understood as a situation that includes contradictions or sharp contrasts.&lt;ref&gt;Elleström, L., ''Divine Madness: On Interpreting Literature, Music and the Visual Arts'', Bucknell University Press, 2002, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
For example:
*When [[Reagan assassination attempt|John Hinckley attempted to assassinate]] [[Ronald Reagan]], all of his shots initially missed the President; however, a bullet ricocheted off the bullet-proof Presidential limousine and struck Reagan in the chest. Thus, a vehicle made to protect the President from gunfire instead directed gunfire to the president.&lt;ref name="trial"&gt;[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/hinckley/hinckleyaccount.html The Trial of John W.

[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Sounds_Good_on_Paper.html?id=rlBIvHRkExsC]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' is a story whose plot revolves around situational irony. Dorothy travels to a wizard and fulfills his challenging demands in order to go home, before discovering she'd had the ability to go back home all along. The Scarecrow longs for [[intelligence]], only to discover he is already a [[genius]], and the [[Tin Woodman]] longs to have a heart, only to discover he is already capable of [[love]]. The Lion, who at first appears to be a whimpering [[coward]], turns out to be bold and fearless. The people in [[Emerald City]] believed the Wizard to be a powerful [[deity]], only to discover that he is a bumbling, eccentric old man with no special powers at all.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

*In [[O. Henry]]'s story "[[The Gift of the Magi]]", a young couple are too poor to buy each other Christmas gifts.  The wife cuts off her treasured hair to sell it to a wig-maker for money to buy her husband a chain for his heirloom pocket watch. She's shocked when she learns he had pawned his watch to buy her a set of combs for her long, beautiful, prized hair. "The double irony lies in the particular way their expectations were foiled." &lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, W. G.; Colston, H. L.; ''Irony in Language and Thought: A Cognitive Science Reader'', Routledge, 2007, p. 59.

&lt;/ref&gt;

===={{anchor|Cosmic irony}}Cosmic irony (irony of fate)====
The expression cosmic irony or "irony of fate" stems from the notion that the gods (or the [[Moirai|Fates]]) are amusing themselves by toying with the minds of mortals with deliberate ironic intent. Closely connected with situational irony, it arises from sharp contrasts between reality and human ideals, or between human intentions and actual results. The resulting situation is poignantly contrary to what was expected or intended.

According to Sudhir Dixit, "Cosmic irony is a term that is usually associated with [Thomas] [[Thomas Hardy|Hardy]]. ... There is a strong feeling of a hostile [[deus ex machina]] in Hardy's novels." In ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'' "there are several instances of this type of irony."&lt;ref&gt;Dixit, S., ''Hardy's Tess Of The D'urbervilles'', Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist, 2001, p. 182.
[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Hardys_Tess_Of_The_Durbervilles.html?id=n45KUGyNsYQC]&lt;/ref&gt; One example follows:&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Hardy|Hardy, Thomas]], ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'', Oxford World's Classics, p. 420.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Justice" was done, and the President of the Immortals (in Æschylean phrase) had ended his sport with Tess.

====Historical irony====
When history is seen through modern eyes, there often appear sharp contrasts between the way historical figures see their world's future and what actually transpires. For example, during the 1920s ''The New York Times'' repeatedly scorned [[crossword|crossword puzzles]]. In 1924, it lamented "the sinful waste in the utterly futile finding of words the letters of which will fit into a prearranged pattern." In 1925 it said "the question of whether the puzzles are beneficial or harmful is in no urgent need of an answer. The craze evidently is dying out fast." Today, no U.S. newspaper is more closely identified with the crossword than ''The New York Times.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://puzzles.about.com/library/weekly/blwordplaydoc.htm|title=Puzzles|author=|date=|website=about.com|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318011533/http://puzzles.about.com/library/weekly/blwordplaydoc.htm|archivedate=18 March 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a more tragic example of historical irony, what people now refer to as the "[[First World War]]" was  called by [[H. G. Wells]] "the war that will end war",&lt;ref&gt;[[H. G. Wells|Wells, H. G.]], ''The War That Will End War'', 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; which soon became "[[the war to end war]]" and "the war to end all wars", and this became a widespread truism, almost a [[cliché]]. Historical irony is therefore a subset of cosmic irony, but one in which the element of time is bound to play a role. Another example could be that of the [[Vietnam War]], where in the 1960s the US attempted to stop the [[Viet Cong]] (Viet Minh) taking over South Vietnam. However, it is an often ignored fact that, in 1941, the US originally supported the [[Viet Minh]] in its fight against Japanese occupation.&lt;ref name="Neale, Jonathan page 17"&gt;Neale, Jonathan ''The American War'', p. 17, {{ISBN|1-898876-67-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the introduction to ''The Irony of American History'', [[Andrew Bacevich]] writes:&lt;ref&gt;Bacevich, A., in Niebuhr, R., ''The Irony of American History'', University of Chicago Press, 2010, p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=After 9/11, the Bush administration announced its intention of bringing freedom and democracy to the people of the Middle East. Ideologues within the Bush administration persuaded themselves that American power, adroitly employed, could transform that region ... The results speak for themselves.}}

Gunpowder was, according to prevailing academic consensus, discovered in the 9th century by [[Chinese alchemy|Chinese alchemists]] searching for an [[Elixir of life|elixir of immortality]].&lt;ref name="Jack Kelly 2005"&gt;Jack Kelly ''Gunpowder: Alchemy, Bombards, and Pyrotechnics: The History of the Explosive that Changed the World'', Perseus Books Group, 2005, {{ISBN|0465037224}}, 9780465037223: pp. 2–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical irony also includes [[List of inventors killed by their own inventions|inventors killed by their own creations]], such as [[William Bullock (inventor)|William Bullock]] – unless, due to the nature of the invention, the risk of death was always known and accepted, as in the case of [[Otto Lilienthal]], who was killed by flying a glider of his own devising.

In certain kinds of situational or historical irony, a factual truth is highlighted by some person's complete ignorance of it or his belief in its opposite. However, this state of affairs does not occur by human design. In some religious contexts, such situations have been seen as the deliberate work of [[divine providence]] to emphasize truths and to taunt humans for not being aware of them when they could easily have been enlightened (this is similar to human use of irony). Such ironies are often more evident, or more striking, when viewed retrospectively in the light of later developments which make the truth of past situations obvious to all.

Other prominent examples of outcomes now seen as poignantly contrary to expectation include:

*In the ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' ruling in 1856, the [[United States Supreme Court]] held that the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] barred any law that would deprive a slaveholder of his property, such as his slaves, upon the incidence of migration into free territory. So, in a sense, the Supreme Court used the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] to deny rights to slaves. Also, Chief Justice Taney hoped that the decision would resolve the slavery issue, but instead it helped cause the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Fehrenbacher, D. E., ''Slavery, Law, and Politics: The Dred Scott Case in Historical Perspective'', Oxford University Press, 1981, p. 90.

*In the [[Kalgoorlie]] (Australia) gold rush of the 1890s, large amounts of the little-known mineral [[calaverite]] (gold telluride) were ironically identified as [[fool's gold]]. These mineral deposits were used as a cheap building material, and for the filling of potholes and ruts. When several years later the mineral was identified, there was a minor gold rush to excavate the streets.&lt;ref&gt;Kean, S., ''The Disappearing Spoon: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements'', Random House, 2011, pp. 226–228.

Immediately after, he was mortally wounded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diplom.org/manus/Presidents/faq/last.html Last words of presidents] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120731092431/http://www.diplom.org/manus/Presidents/faq/last.html |date=2012-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==

===Comic irony===
Irony is often used in literature to produce a comic effect.  This may also be combined with [[satire]].  For instance, an author may facetiously state something as a well-known fact and then demonstrate through the narrative that the fact is untrue.

Jane Austen's ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' begins with the proposition "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife." In fact, it soon becomes clear that Austen means the opposite: women (or their mothers) are always in search of, and desperately on the lookout for, a rich single man to make a husband. The irony deepens as the story promotes this romance and ends in a double marriage proposal. "Austen's comic irony emerges out of the disjunction between Elizabeth's overconfidence (or pride) in her perceptions of Darcy and the narrator's indications that her views are in fact partial and prejudicial."&lt;ref&gt;Ferriss, S.; Young, M.; ''Chick Lit: The New Woman's Fiction'', Routledge, 2006, p. 77. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Chick_Lit.html?id=lMjey3Bese0C]&lt;/ref&gt;

"''[[The Third Man]]'' is a film that features any number of eccentricities, each of which contributes to the film's perspective of comic irony as well as its overall cinematic self-consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;Jones, W. E.; Vice, S.; ''Ethics at the Cinema'', Oxford University Press, 2010, p. 295.[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Ethics_at_the_Cinema.html?id=QdP_xLImIugC]&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing about performances of Shakespeare's ''[[Othello]]'' in apartheid South Africa, Robert Gordon suggests: "Could it be that black people in the audience ... may have viewed as a comic irony his audacity and naïvety in thinking he could pass for white."&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, R., in ''The Shakespearean  International Yearbook: Special Section, South African Shakespeare in the Twentieth Century'', Volume 9, Ashgate Publishing, 2009. p. 147. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Shakespearean_International_Yearbook.html?id=ZQ3LrE-Iy-kC]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romantic irony and metafiction===
Romantic irony is "an attitude of detached scepticism adopted by an author towards his or her work, typically manifesting in literary self-consciousness and self-reflection". This conception of irony originated with the German Romantic writer and critic [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford English Dictionary'', "romantic irony" entry.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Dane writes "From a twentieth-century perspective, the most crucial area in the history of irony is that described by the term romantic irony." He discusses the difficulty of defining romantic irony: "But what is romantic irony? A universal type of irony? The irony used by romantics? or an irony envisioned by the romantics and romanticists?" He also describes the arguments for and against its use.&lt;ref&gt;Dane, J. A., ''The Critical Mythology of Irony'', University of Georgia Press, 2011, Ch. 5 [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Critical_Mythology_of_Irony.html?id=6EAw-H8zvDkC]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Referring to earlier self-conscious works such as [[Don Quixote]] and [[Tristram Shandy]], Douglas Muecke points particularly to [[Peter Weiss]]'s 1964 play, ''[[Marat/Sade]]''. This work is a play within a play set in a lunatic asylum, in which it is difficult to tell whether the players are speaking only to other players or also directly to the audience. When The Herald says, "The regrettable incident you've just seen was unavoidable indeed foreseen by our playwright", there is confusion as to who is being addressed, the "audience" on the stage or the audience in the theatre. Also, since the play within the play is performed by the inmates of a lunatic asylum, the theatre audience cannot tell whether the paranoia displayed before them is that of the players, or the people they are portraying. Muecke notes that, "in America, Romantic irony has had a bad press", while "in England ... [it] is almost unknown."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Compass_of_Irony.html?id=7PsNAAAAQAAJ Muecke, DC., ''The Compass of Irony'', Routledge, 1969. pp. 178–180]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in a book entitled ''English Romantic Irony'', Anne Mellor writes, referring to Byron, Keats, Carlyle, Coleridge, and Lewis Carroll:&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, Anne K., ''English Romantic Irony'', Harvard University Press, 1980, pp. 4, 187.
[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/English_romantic_irony.html?id=M_C1AAAAIAAJ]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|1=Romantic irony is both a philosophical conception of the universe and an artistic program. Ontologically, it sees the world as fundamentally chaotic. No order, no far goal of time, ordained by God or right reason, determines the progression of human or natural events.... Of course, romantic irony itself has more than one mode. The style of romantic irony varies from writer to writer.... But however distinctive the voice, a writer is a romantic ironist if and when his or her work commits itself enthusiastically both in content and form to a hovering or unresolved debate between a world of merely man-made being and a world of ontological becoming.}}

Similarly, [[metafiction]] is: "Fiction in which the author self-consciously alludes to the artificiality or literariness of a work by parodying or departing from novelistic conventions (esp. naturalism) and narrative techniques."&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford English Dictionary'', "metafiction" entry.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a type of fiction that self-consciously addresses the devices of fiction, thereby exposing the fictional illusion.

Gesa Giesing writes that "the most common form of metafiction is particularly frequent in Romantic literature. The phenomenon is then referred to as Romantic Irony." Giesing notes that "There has obviously been an increased interest in metafiction again after World War II."&lt;ref&gt;Giesing, G., ''Metafictional Aspects in Novels by Muriel Spark'', GRIN Verlag, 2004, p. 6.[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Metafictional_Aspects_in_Novels_by_Murie.html?id=4gRwgvoY_ysC]&lt;/ref&gt;

For examples, Patricia Waugh quotes from several works at the top of her chapter headed "What is metafiction?". These include:

"The thing is this./ That of all the several ways of beginning a book ... I am confident my own way of doing it is best" - ''[[Tristram Shandy]]''

"Since I've started this story, I've gotten boils ..." - ''The death of the novel and other stories'' by [[Ronald Sukenick]]&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, P., ''Metafiction: The Theory and Practice of Self-Conscious Fiction'', Routledge, 2002, p. 1.[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Metafiction.html?id=O2MkrWv6RIUC]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, ''The Cambridge Introduction to Postmodern Fiction'' refers to [[John Fowles]]'s ''[[The French Lieutenant's Woman]]'':&lt;ref&gt;Nicol, B., ''The Cambridge Introduction to Postmodern Fiction'', Cambridge University Press, 2009, pp. 108–109.
[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Cambridge_Introduction_to_Postmodern.html?id=PoKi_TnntzcC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
For the first twelve chapters ... the reader has been able to immerse him or herself in the story, enjoying the kind of 'suspension of disbelief ' required of realist novels ... what follows is a remarkable act of metafictional 'frame-breaking'. Chapter 13 notoriously begins:
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
I do not know. This story I am telling is all imagination. These characters I create never existed outside my own mind. ... if this is a novel, it cannot be a novel in the modern sense.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Socratic irony===&lt;!--'Socratic irony' redirects here--&gt;
{{Main article|Socratic method}}
'''Socratic irony'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is "the dissimulation of ignorance practised by [[Socrates]] as a means of confuting an adversary".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Socrates would pretend to be ignorant of the topic under discussion, to draw out the inherent nonsense in the arguments of his interlocutors. ''[[The Chambers Dictionary]]'' defines it as "a means by which a questioner pretends to know less than a respondent, when actually he knows more".

Zoe Williams of ''The Guardian'' wrote: "The technique [of Socratic irony], demonstrated in the Platonic dialogues, was to pretend ignorance and, more sneakily, to feign credence in your opponent's power of thought, in order to tie him in knots."&lt;ref name="Guardian Online: The Final Irony"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2003/jun/28/weekend7.weekend2 |title=Online: The Final Irony |publisher=Guardian |date=28 June 2003 |access-date=12 December 2010 |location=London |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131104230808/http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2003/jun/28/weekend7.weekend2 |archive-date=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more modern example of Socratic irony can be seen on the American crime fiction television series, ''[[Columbo]]''.  The character Lt. Columbo is seemingly naïve and incompetent.  His untidy appearance adds to this fumbling illusion.  As a result, he is underestimated by the suspects in murder cases he is investigating.  With their guard down and their false sense of confidence, Lt. Columbo is able to solve the cases, leaving the murderers feeling duped and outwitted.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, G. ''How to Be a Philosopher: Or How to Be Almost Certain That Almost Nothing Is Certain,'' Continuum International Publishing Group, 2010, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irony as infinite, absolute negativity===
Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]], and others, see irony, such as that used by Socrates, as a disruptive force with the power to undo texts and readers alike.&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, S, ''The concept of irony with continuous reference to Socrates'' (1841), Harper &amp; Row, 1966, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase itself is taken from [[Hegel]]'s ''[[Lectures on Aesthetics]]'', and is applied by Kierkegaard to the irony of Socrates. This tradition includes 19th-century German critic and novelist [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]] ("On Incomprehensibility"), [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Stendhal]], and the 20th century [[deconstruction]]ist [[Paul de Man]] ("The Concept of Irony"). In Kierkegaard's words, from [[On the Concept of Irony with Continual Reference to Socrates]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Socratic] irony [is] the infinite absolute negativity. It is negativity, because it only negates; it is infinite, because it does not negate this or that phenomenon; it is absolute, because that by virtue of which it negates is a higher something that still is not. The irony established nothing, because that which is to be established lies behind it...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sorenkierkegaard.org/concept-of-irony.html|title=Kierkegaard, D. Anthony Storm's Commentary on - The Concept of Irony|author=|date=|website=sorenkierkegaard.org|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009222139/http://sorenkierkegaard.org/concept-of-irony.html|archivedate=9 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Where much of philosophy attempts to reconcile opposites into a larger positive project, Kierkegaard and others insist that irony—whether expressed in complex games of authorship or simple [[litotes]]—must, in Kierkegaard's words, "swallow its own stomach". Irony entails endless reflection and violent reversals, and ensures incomprehensibility at the moment it compels speech. Similarly, among other literary critics, writer [[David Foster Wallace]] viewed the pervasiveness of ironic and other [[postmodern]] tropes as the cause of "great despair and stasis in U.S. culture, and that for aspiring fictionists [ironies] pose terrifically vexing problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wallace|first=David Foster|title=E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction|journal=Review of Contemporary Fiction|volume=13|issue=2|pages=151–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irony and awkwardness===

The '90s saw an expansion of the definition of irony from "saying what one doesn't mean" into a "general stance of&amp;nbsp;detachment&amp;nbsp;from life in general",&lt;ref&gt;Kotsko, Adam, ''Awkwardness.'', O-Books, 2010, pp. 21&lt;/ref&gt; this detachment serving as a shield against the awkwardness of everyday life. Humor from that era (most notably, ''[[Seinfeld]]'') relies on the audience watching the show with some detachment from the show's typical signature awkward situations.

The generation of people in the United States who grew up in the 90s, [[Millennials]], are seen as having this same sort of detachment from serious or awkward situations in life, as well. [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|Hipsters]] are thought to use irony as a shield against those same serious or genuine confrontations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/how-to-live-without-irony/|title=How to Live Without Irony|first=Christy|last=Wampole|date=17 November 2012|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325230612/https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/how-to-live-without-irony/|archivedate=25 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misuse==

Some speakers of English complain that the words ''irony'' and ''ironic'' are often misused,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2015/06/05/how-learned-love-alanis-morissette-irony/Em8dl58iYReUmXrYElJOPN/story.html|title=Learning to love Alanis Morissette’s ‘irony’ - The Boston Globe|author=|date=|website=bostonglobe.com|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161125191124/http://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2015/06/05/how-learned-love-alanis-morissette-irony/Em8dl58iYReUmXrYElJOPN/story.html|archivedate=25 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the more general casual usage of a contradiction between circumstance and expectation originates in the 1640s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=irony|title=irony - Origin and meaning of irony by Online Etymology Dictionary|author=|date=|website=www.etymonline.com|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614210204/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=irony|archivedate=14 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{examples needed|date=December 2017}}

[[Dan Shaughnessy]] wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;
We were always kidding about the use of irony. I maintained that it was best never to use the word because it was too often substituted for coincidence. (Alanis Morissette's song [[Ironic (song)|"Isn't it Ironic?"]] cites multiple examples of things that are patently not ironic.)&lt;ref&gt;Shaughnessy, D., ''Senior Year: A Father, A Son, and High School Baseball'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2008, pp. 91-92.

==Punctuation==
{{main article|Irony punctuation}}
No agreed-upon method for indicating irony in written text exists, though many ideas have been suggested. For instance, an [[Irony punctuation|irony punctuation mark]] was proposed in the 1580s, when Henry Denham introduced a rhetorical question mark or [[percontation point]], which resembles a reversed question mark. This mark was also advocated by the French poet Marcel Bernhardt at the end of the 19th century, to indicate irony or [[sarcasm]]. French writer [[Hervé Bazin]] suggested another ''pointe d'ironie'': the Greek letter ''[[Psi (letter)|psi]]'' {{lang|el|Ψ}} with a dot below it, while [[Tom Driberg]] recommended that ironic statements should be printed in italics that lean the other way from conventional italics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3fbWAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Houston, K., ''Shady Characters: The Secret Life of Punctuation, Symbols, and Other Typographical Marks'', W.

'''[[Funeral]]s''' in '''[[Islam]]''' (called Janazah in Arabic) follow fairly specific [[rite]]s, though they are subject to regional interpretation and variation in custom. In all cases, however, [[sharia]] (Islamic [[religious law]]) calls for [[burial]] of the body as soon as possible, preceded by a simple [[ritual]] involving bathing and shrouding the body,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15444275 |title=Who, What, Why: What are the burial customs in Islam?|website= BBC News|date=25 October 2011 |author=Rema Rahman |accessdate= 16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by [[salah]] (prayer). Burial is usually within 24 hours of death to protect the living from any sanitary issues, except in the case of a person killed in battle or when foul play is suspected; in those cases it is important to determine cause of death before burial. [[Cremation]] of the body is forbidden.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

* Burial of the dead body in a grave.
* Positioning the deceased so that the head is faced towards [[Mecca]] (Makkah Al-Mukarramah).

===Bathing the deceased===
The [[Cadaver|corpse]] is washed (''[[ghusl]]'', bathed), with the purpose to physically cleanse the deceased. The exact manner: the method, style and accessories used for bathing the corpse may vary by locale and [[Time|temporal]] position, except that it is to be done with heated water. Bathing the dead body is an essential ritual of the [[Sunnah]] of the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]],&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Muslim [http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html#002.023.344 Volume 2, Book 23, Number 344-358] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819123140/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html#002.023.344 |date=2010-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore a part of the Islamic Sharia. This should occur as soon as possible after death, preferably within hours.

Orthodox practice is to wash the body an odd number of times (at least once) with a cloth covering its [[awrah]] (parts of the body that should be hidden according to Sharia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nesa|first=Baduroon|title=The Washing and Shrouding of the Deceased|url=http://www.aljazeerah.info/Islam/Islamic%20subjects/2004%20subjects/May/The%20Washing%20and%20Shrouding%20of%20the%20Deceased.htm|work=Al-Jazeerah.nfo|publisher=Dr. Hassan Ali El-Najjar|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The "washers" are commonly adult members of the immediate family, who are of the same [[gender]] as the deceased. In cases of violent deaths or accidents, where the deceased has suffered [[Physical trauma|trauma]] or [[mutilation]], [[morgue]] facilities mend the body and wrap it in a shroud to minimise [[fluid]] leakage prior to surrendering it to mourners for washing.

===Enshrouding the deceased===
The corpse is typically wrapped in a simple plain cloth (the ''kafan'').
This is done to respect the dignity and privacy of the deceased with the family sometimes present. The specifics of this ritual, including the material, style, and colour of the cloth, may vary across regions. However, the [[shroud]] should be simple and [[Simplicity|modest]]. It is for this reason that [[Muslim]]s have generally preferred to use white cotton cloth to serve as the shroud. 
Men may use only three pieces of cloth and women five pieces of cloth.&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Muslim [http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html#002.023.353 Volume 2, Book 23, Number 353-358] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819123140/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html#002.023.353 |date=2010-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deceased may be kept in this state for several hours, allowing well-wishers to pass on their respects and condolences.

===Funeral prayer===
The Muslims of the community gather to offer their collective prayers for the forgiveness of the dead. This prayer has been generally termed as the [[Salat al-Janazah]] (Janazah prayer).

The Janazah prayer is as follows: 
*like [[Eid prayer]], the ''Janazah'' prayer  incorporates an additional (four&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Muslim [http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html#002.023.404 Volume 2, Book 23, Number 404] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819123140/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html#002.023.404 |date=2010-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) [[Takbir]]s, the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] name for the phrase ''Allah Akbar'', ''but'' there is no [[Ruku']] (''bowing'') and [[Sujud]] (''prostrating'').
* [[Supplication]] for the deceased and mankind is recited.
* In extraordinary circumstances, the prayer can be postponed and prayed at a later time as was done in the Battle of Uhud.&lt;ref name="pray"/&gt;
* It is required for every Muslim adult male to perform the funeral prayer upon the death of any Muslim, but conventionally and in practice the ''Janazah'' is performed by few people so it alleviates that obligation for all.&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Muslim [http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html#002.023.359 Volume 2, Book 23, Number 359] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819123140/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html#002.023.359 |date=2010-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burial===
[[File:Muslim grave.jpg|thumb|Grave of a Muslim]]
The deceased is then taken for burial (''al-Dafin''). The exact manner, customs and  style of the [[Grave (burial)|grave]], the burial and so forth may vary by regional [[Norm (sociology)|custom]]. 

The grave should be at right angles to the direction of the [[Qibla]] (i.e. Mecca) so that the body, placed in the grave without a [[coffin]] lying on its right side, faces the Qibla.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=al-Misri|first=Ahmad ibn Naqib|title=Reliance of the Traveler (edited and translated by [[Nuh Ha Mim Keller]]|publisher=Amana Publications|year=1994|pages=238–239|isbn=0-915957-72-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grave markers should be raised, not more than about {{convert|30|cm|in}} above the ground, so that the grave will neither be walked nor sat on. [[Headstone|Grave markers]] are simple, because outwardly lavish displays are discouraged in Islam. Graves are frequently marked only with a simple [[wreath]], if at all. However, it is becoming more common for family members to erect grave monuments.

In [[Middle Eastern]] [[cultures]] women are generally discouraged from participating in the funeral procession. The reason for this is that in pre-Islamic Arabia it was customary in Arabia for grieving women to wail loudly. Wealthy families often even hired 'wailers' to attend the funerals of their deceased relative. Wailing at funerals is not permitted according to the Sahih Bukhari. Women are allowed to attend or be present if they do not wail or cry or hit themselves in grief, especially in an exaggerated excessive manner as it used to be done in old Arabia times.&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Muslim [http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html#002.023.368 Volume 2, Book 23, Number 368] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819123140/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html#002.023.368 |date=2010-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Three fist-sized spheres of hand-packed soil prepared beforehand by the gravediggers are used as props, one under the head, one under the [[chin]] and one under the shoulder. The lowering of the corpse and positioning of the soil-balls is done by the next of kin. In the case of a deceased husband, a male brother or brother-in-law usually performs this task. In the case of a deceased wife, the husband undertakes this if physically able to. If the husband is elderly, then the eldest male son (or son-in-law) is responsible for lowering, alignment and propping the deceased.

[[Orthodoxy]] expects those present to [[symbol]]ically pour three handfuls of soil into the grave while reciting a quranic verse meaning, "We created you from it, and return you into it, and from it we will raise you a second time".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|20|55|style=nosup}}; compare "Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return" (Genesis 3:19)&lt;/ref&gt; More prayers are then said, asking for forgiveness of the deceased, and reminding the dead of their profession of faith.
[[File:C0566-Kstovo-Muslim-cemetery.jpg|thumb|In a [[Tatars|Tatar]] Muslim cemetery]]

The corpse is then fully buried by the gravediggers, who may stamp or pat down the grave to shape. Commonly the eldest male will supervise. After the burial the Muslims who have gathered to pay their respects to the dead collectively pray for the forgiveness of the dead. This collective prayer is the last formal collective prayer for the dead. In some cultures, e.g. South East Asian Muslims, the surviving members of the deceased scatter flowers and perfumed rose water upon the grave as the last action prior to leaving the grave.

===Mourning===
According to Sunni Islam, loved ones and relatives are to observe a 15-day [[mourning]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Muslim [http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html#002.023.369 Volume 2, Book 23, Number 369-371] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819123140/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html#002.023.369 |date=2010-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic mourning is observed by increased devotion, receiving visitors and condolences, and avoiding decorative clothing and jewelry in accordance with the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|2|234|style=nosup}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Widow]]s observe an extended mourning period ([[iddah]], ''period of waiting''), 4 months and 10 days long.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-09-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819123140/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html#002.023.370 |archive-date=2010-08-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During that time, the widow is not to remarry or to interact with non-mahram (a man she can marry). This rule is to confirm that the woman is not pregnant with the deceased's child prior to remarrying. However, in case of emergencies such as visiting a doctor because of a health emergency, the widow can interact with non-mahram.

Grief at the death of a beloved person and weeping for the dead is normal and acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Muslim [http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html#002.023.391 Volume 2, Book 23, Number 391] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819123140/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html#002.023.391 |date=2010-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunni Islam expects expression of  grief to remain dignified, prohibiting loud wailing (bewailing refers to mourning in a loud voice), shrieking, beating the chest and cheeks, tearing hair or clothes, breaking objects, scratching faces or speaking phrases that make a Muslim lose faith. Grieving is allowed and a part of the death and burial process to allow one to come in terms with the loss of a person passing away as long as it respects the above.&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Muslim [http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html#002.023.375 Volume 2, Book 23, Number 375-393] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819123140/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html#002.023.375 |date=2010-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Directives for widows===
The Qur'an prohibits [[widow]]s to engage themselves for four [[lunar month]]s and ten days, after the death of their husbands. According to the Qur'an:
{{quote|And those of you who die and leave widows behind, they should keep themselves in waiting for four months and ten days. Then when they have fulfilled their term, there is no blame on you about what they do with themselves in accordance with the norms [of society]. And Allah is well acquainted with what you do. And there is also no blame on you if you tacitly send a marriage proposal to these women or hold it in your hearts. Allah knows that you would definitely talk to them. [Do so] but do not make a secret contract. Of course you can say something in accordance with the norms [of the society]. And do not decide to marry until the law reaches its term. And know that Allah has knowledge of what is in your hearts; so be fearful of Him and know that Allah is Most forgiving and Most Forbearing.| {{Cite quran|2|234|end=235|style=nosup}} ||}}

Islamic scholars consider this directive a balance between the mourning of a husband's death and the protection of a widow from cultural or societal censure if she became interested in remarrying after her husband’s death, often an economic necessity.&lt;ref&gt;Islahi (1986), p. 546&lt;/ref&gt; This provision also operates to protect the property rights of the unborn, as the duration is enough to ascertain whether a widow is pregnant or not.&lt;ref&gt;Shehzad Saleem. ''[http://www.renaissance.com.pk/Marislaw2y4.html The Social Directives of Islam: Distinctive Aspects of Ghamidi’s Interpretation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403024603/http://www.renaissance.com.pk/Marislaw2y4.html |date=2007-04-03 }}'', [[Al-Mawrid|Renaissance]]. March, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Husbands are recommended to make a [[Will (law)|will]] in favor of their wives for the provision of one year’s residence and maintenance, except if the wives themselves leave the house or take any other similar step. As stated in Qur'an:
{{quote|And those of you who die and leave widows should bequeath for their widows a year’s provision and [bequeath] that [in this period] they shall not be turned out of their residences; but if they themselves leave the residence, there is no blame on you for what they do with themselves according to the norms of society. And Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise.|{{Cite quran|2|240|style=nosup}}||}}

'''Isomer''' (Greek ''isos'' = "equal", ''méros'' = "part") is an element of transverse body articulation of the bilateral fossil animals of the [[Phylum]] [[Proarticulata]] from the [[Ediacaran]] (Vendian) period. This term has been proposed by Andrey Yu. Ivantsov, a Russian paleontologist from the Laboratory of the Precambrian organisms, [[Paleontological Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name=Ivantsov2001&gt;{{cite journal

==Morphology==

Proarticulatan isomers are distinct from the [[Segmentation (biology)|segments]] of the [[Annelida]] and [[Panarthropoda]], as each of these elements occupies only half of width of a body and are organized in an alternating pattern relatively to the axis of the body.  In other words, although proarticulatans are bilaterally symmetrical, one side is not the direct mirror image of its opposite. Opposite isomers of left and right side are located with displacement of half of its width. This phenomenon is described as the symmetry of [[Glide reflection|gliding reflection]].&lt;ref name=Ivantsov2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fedonkin_1985&gt;M. A. Fedonkin (1985).

However, this type of symmetry is not unique to Proarticulata, a modern [[lancelet]]s have analogous asymmetric arrangement of [[myomere]]s and [[somites]] of [[larvae]].&lt;ref name=Blum2014&gt;{{cite journal

The first element in the row is a right isomer on the anterior end of the dorsal side. All successive isomers are similar to it, but gradually decrease in size and in angle of inclination from the anterior part (head) of the body to the posterior end.&lt;ref name=Ivantsov2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ivantsov2004&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
New isomers were added at the growth point at the posterior end of the proarticulate body. With age, the addition of new isomers slowed down and probably stopped, the growth point shifted from the posterior end, and the relative length of the posterior isomers increased, sometimes significantly.&lt;ref name=Ivantsov2007&gt;{{cite journal

The overall number of body isomers amounts from several pairs (''[[Vendia]]'', ''[[Onega (fossil)|Onega]]'') to several hundreds (''[[Dickinsonia]]'').

===Vendiamorpha===
The body is completely segmented, with all isomers curved towards the posterior, and the first isomer is normally much larger than the rest. The first two isomers at the anterior dorsal end are partly fused together to form a headshield-like structure. (e.g., ''[[Vendia]]'', ''[[Paravendia]]'', and ''[[Karakhtia]]'').&lt;ref name=Ivantsov2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ivantsov2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ivantsov2004et_al&gt;{{cite journal

Abstracts. Prato, Italy, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cephalozoa (preliminary name)===
These proarticulatans demonstrate incomplete segmentation, as the anterior zone is free of isomers, often making a "hairband" like appearance.  (example cephalozoans include ''[[Yorgia]]'', ''[[Praecambridium]]'', ''[[Andiva]]'', ''[[Archaeaspinus]]'', ''[[Ivovicia]]'', ''[[Spriggina]]'', ''[[Marywadea]]'' and ''[[Cyanorus]]''.&lt;ref name=Ivantsov2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ivantsov2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ivantsov2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ivantsov2004Prato/&gt; Some cephalozoans from the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Yorgiidae]] demonstrate pronounced asymmetry of left and right parts of the body. For instance, ''Yorgia''’s initial right isomer is the only one which spreads far towards the left side of the body. ''Archaeaspinus'' has an unpaired anterior lobe confined by the furrow to the left side only.&lt;ref name=Ivantsov2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ivantsov1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ivantsov2004Prato/&gt;

===Dipleurozoa===
The dipleurozoan body is subradial divided by isomers entirely (e.g., ''[[Dickinsonia]]'' and ''[[Phyllozoon]]''). Juveniles ''Dickinsonia'' show an undivided anterior area but this region was reduced in the course of ontogeny, and in adult ''Dickinsonia''-like proarticulates changed so strongly that became almost indistinguishable from isomers.&lt;ref name=Ivantsov2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ivantsov2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ivantsov2002&gt;{{cite journal

===Proarticulata ''Incertae sedis''===
In ''[[Onega stepanovi]]'' and ''[[Tamga hamulifera]]'' all isomers are encircled by a peripheral undivided zone.&lt;ref name=Ivantsov2007/&gt; In the former, the isomers remain in contact with each other, while in the latter, the isomers do not touch.

Another common question is concerned with the maximum distance into a desert which could be reached from a frontier settlement by an explorer capable of carrying provisions that would last him for ''a'' days." [[W. W. Rouse Ball]] and [[H.S.M. Coxeter]] (1987). ''Mathematical Recreations and Essays'', Thirteenth Edition, Dover, p32. {{ISBN|0-486-25357-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a mathematics problem in which a [[Willys MB|jeep]] must maximise the distance it can travel into a desert with a given quantity of fuel. The jeep can only carry a fixed and limited amount of fuel, but it can leave fuel and collect fuel at fuel dumps anywhere in the desert.

The problem was solved by [[Nathan Fine|N. J. Fine]] in 1947.&lt;ref name=wolfram/&gt;

==Problem==
There are ''n'' units of fuel stored at a fixed base. The jeep can carry at most 1 unit of fuel at any time, and can travel 1 unit of distance on 1 unit of fuel (the jeep's fuel consumption is assumed to be constant). At any point in a trip the jeep may leave any amount of fuel that it is carrying at a fuel dump, or may collect any amount of fuel that was left at a fuel dump on a previous trip, as long as its fuel load never exceeds 1 unit. There are two variants of the problem:

*'''Exploring the desert'''{{spaced ndash}} the jeep must return to the base at the end of every trip.
*'''Crossing the desert'''{{spaced ndash}} the jeep must return to the base at the end of every trip except for the final trip, when the jeep travels as far as it can before running out of fuel.

In either case the objective is to maximise the distance travelled by the jeep on its final trip. Alternatively, the objective may be to find the least amount of fuel required to produce a final trip of a given distance.

In the classic problem the fuel in the jeep and at fuel dumps is treated as a [[continuous function|continuous]] quantity. More complex variations on the problem have been proposed in which the fuel can only be left or collected in discrete amounts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/rote/Papers/pdf/Optimal+logistics+for+expeditions+-+the+jeep+problem+with+complete+refilling.pdf Optimal Logistics for Expeditions: the Jeep Problem with Complete Refilling], Gunter Rote and Guochuan Zhang, June 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solution==
[[File:Jeep problem 1.png|thumb|250px|Solution to "exploring the desert" variant for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, showing fuel contents of jeep and fuel dumps at start of each trip and at turnround point on each trip.]]
A strategy that maximises the distance travelled on the final trip for the "exploring the desert" variant is as follows:

*The jeep makes ''n'' trips. On each trip it starts from base with 1 unit of fuel.
*On the first trip the jeep travels a distance of 1/(2''n'') units and leaves (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/''n'' units of fuel at a fuel dump. The jeep still has 1/(2''n'') units of fuel &amp;ndash; just enough to return to base.
*On each of the subsequent ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 trips the jeep collects 1/(2''n'') units of fuel from this first fuel dump on the way out, so that it leaves the fuel dump carrying 1 unit of fuel. It also collects 1/(2''n'') units of fuel from this first fuel dump on the way back, which is just enough fuel to return to base.
*On the second trip the jeep travels to the first fuel dump and refuels. It then travels a distance of 1/(2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2) units and leaves (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2)/(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) units of fuel at a second fuel dump. The jeep still has 1/(2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2) units of fuel, which is just enough to return to the first fuel dump. Here it collects 1/(2''n'') units of fuel, which is just enough fuel to return to base.
*On each of the subsequent ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2 trips the jeep collects 1/(2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2) units of fuel from this second fuel dump on the way out, so that it leaves the fuel dump carrying 1 unit of fuel. It also collects 1/(2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2) units of fuel from the second fuel dump on the way back, which is just enough fuel to return to the first fuel dump.
*The jeep continues in this way, so that on trip ''k'' it establishes a new ''k''th fuel dump at a distance of 1/(2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2) units from the previous fuel dump and leaves (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k'')/(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) units of fuel there. On each of the subsequent ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k'' trips it collects 1/(2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2) units of fuel from the ''k''th dump on its way out and another 1/(2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2) units of fuel on its way back.

When the jeep starts its final trip, there are ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 fuel dumps. The farthest contains 1/2 of a unit of fuel, the next farthest contain 1/3 of a unit of fuel, and so on, and the nearest fuel dump has just 1/''n'' units of fuel left. Together with 1 unit of fuel with which it starts from base, this means that the jeep can travel a total round trip distance of

:&lt;math&gt;1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n} = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k}&lt;/math&gt;

units on its final trip (the maximum distance travelled into the desert is half of this).&lt;ref name=coxeter/&gt; It collects half of the remaining fuel at each dump on the way out, which fills its tank. After leaving the farthest fuel dump it travels 1/2 a unit further into the desert and then returns to the farthest fuel dump. It collects the remaining fuel from each fuel dump on the way back, which is just enough to reach the next fuel dump or, in the final step, to return to base.

[[File:Jeep problem 2.png|thumb|250px|Solution to "crossing the desert" variant for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, showing fuel contents of jeep and fuel dumps at start of each trip, at turnround point on first two trips, and at end of final trip.]]
The distance travelled on the last trip is the ''n''th [[harmonic number]], ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. As the harmonic numbers are unbounded, it is possible to exceed any given distance on the final trip, as along as sufficient fuel is available at the base. However, the amount of fuel required and the number of fuel dumps both increase exponentially with the distance to be travelled.

The "crossing the desert" variant can be solved with a similar strategy, except that there is now no requirement to collect fuel on the way back on the final trip. So on trip ''k'' the jeep establishes a new ''k''th fuel dump at a distance of 1/(2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) units from the previous fuel dump and leaves (2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/(2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) units of fuel there. On each of the next ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 trips it collects 1/(2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) units of fuel from the ''k''th dump on its way out and another 1/(2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) units of fuel on its way back.

Now when the jeep starts its final trip, there are ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 fuel dumps. The farthest contains 1/3 of a unit of fuel, the next farthest contain 1/5 of a unit of fuel, and so on, and the nearest fuel dump has just 1/(2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) units of fuel left. Together with 1 unit of fuel with which it starts from base, this means that the jeep can travel a total distance of

:&lt;math&gt;1 + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} + \cdots + \frac{1}{2n-1} = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{2k-1}=H_{2n-1}-\frac{1}{2}H_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

units on its final trip.&lt;ref name=wolfram/&gt;&lt;ref name=coxeter/&gt; It collects all of the remaining fuel at each dump on the way out, which fills its tank. After leaving the farthest fuel dump it travels a further distance of 1&amp;nbsp;unit.

Note that

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{2k-1} &gt; \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{2k} = \frac{1}{2}H_{n}&lt;/math&gt;

so it is possible in theory to cross a desert of any size given enough fuel at the base. As before, the amount of fuel required and the number of fuel dumps both increase exponentially with the distance to be travelled.

==Practical applications==
The problem can have a practical application in wartime situations, especially with respect to fuel efficiency. In the context of the bombing of Japan in [[World War II]] by [[B-29]]s, [[Robert McNamara]] says in the film ''[[The Fog of War]]'' that understanding the fuel efficiency issue caused by having to transport the fuel to forward bases was the main reason why the strategy of launching bombing raids from mainland China was abandoned in favor of the [[island hopping]] strategy:

{{quote|"We had to fly those planes from the bases in Kansas to India. Then we had to fly fuel over the hump into China. [...] We were supposed to take these [[B-29]]s—there were no [[tanker aircraft]] there. We were to fill them with fuel, fly from [[India]] to [[Chengdu|Chengtu]]; offload the fuel; fly back to India; make enough missions to build up fuel in Chengtu; fly to [[Yawata]], [[Japan]]; bomb the [[steel mills]]; and go back to India.

We had so little training on this problem of maximizing [fuel] efficiency, we actually found to get some of the B-29s back instead of offloading fuel, they had to take it on. To make a long story short, it wasn't worth a damn. And it was [[Curtis LeMay|LeMay]] who really came to that conclusion, and led the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff|Chiefs]] to move the whole thing to the [[Marianas]], which devastated Japan."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.errolmorris.com/film/fow_transcript.html Fog of War transcript], www.errolmorris.com&lt;/ref&gt;}}

(The [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing missions]] at the end of World War II were flown using B-29 [[Superfortresses]] from the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] island of [[Tinian]] in the [[Northern Marianas Islands]].)

See also [[Operation Black Buck]] for an application of these ideas. In these missions, conducted during the [[Falklands War]], the [[Royal Air Force]] used air to air refuelling by staging tankers to enable the [[Avro Vulcan|Vulcan]] bombers based on [[Ascension Island]] to bomb targets in the [[Falkland Islands]].

The '''Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics''' ({{lang-ru|Институт прикладной математики им. М.В.Келдыша}})  is a research institute specializing in [[computation]]al [[mathematics]]. It was established to solve computational tasks related to government programs of [[Nuclear power|nuclear]] and [[Fusion power|fusion]] energy, [[space research]] and [[missile]] technology. The Institute is a part of the Department of Mathematical Sciences of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. The main direction of activity of the institute is the use of [[computer technology]] to solve complex scientific and technical issues of practical importance. Since 2016, development of mathematical and computational methods for [[biological research]], as well as a direct solution to the problems of [[computational biology]] with the use of such methods, has also been included in the circle of scientific activities of the institute.

==Scientific activity==

===[[Nuclear physics]]===
Prominent theoretical physicist [[Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich]] headed one of the departments placed in charge of the theoretical aspects of the work on the creation of [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] and [[thermonuclear weapon]]s. Young [[:ru:Самарский, Александр Андреевич|A. A. Samarskii]] performed the first realistic calculations of macrokinetics of [[chain reaction]] of a [[nuclear explosion]], which led to the practical importance estimated power of nuclear weapons. In relation to nuclear energy, the institute was  also involved in modelling of processes of [[neutron transport]] and [[nuclear reaction]]s. In particular, E. Kuznetsov is known for his work on the theory of [[nuclear reactor]]s.

Currently, such work in '''KIAM''' is continuing in the field of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma physics]] and controlled [[thermonuclear fusion]], which began under the leadership of [[Sergei P. Kurdyumov|S. P. Kurdyumova]], {{nobr|A. A. Samarskii}}, {{nobr|Yu. P. Popov}}.

===[[Cosmonautics]]===
[[Dmitry Okhotsimsky|D. E. Okhotsimsky]] directed the works in the  department created for researches of dynamics of [[spaceflight|space flight]]. In 1966, the department was reorganized into the Ballistic Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ru icon}} [http://www.kiam1.rssi.ru/ Ballistic centre of KIAM]&lt;/ref&gt; The Ballistic Centre was involved in the calculations of optimal orbit trajectory and actual corrections for all space flights, from unmanned interplanetary and lunar vehicles to the manned "[[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]]" and orbital station "[[Salyut programme|Salyut]]" and "[[Mir]]". The department also investigated the docking task, controlled landing and stabilizing the spacecraft.

The institute took an active part in the creation of the Soviet space shuttle "[[Buran programme|Buran]]".

'''KIAM''' continues to engage in performance of current Russian space projects. The current researches are connected with:
* development of systems for management and navigation of space vehicles in real time with the use of [[Satellite navigation|global satellite navigation systems]] [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and [[GLONASS]];
* studies of the atmosphere of the planets of the solar system;
* exploration of prospects for further interplanetary missions using electric rocket engines; 
* participation in such projects as "[[Spektr-R|RadioAstron]]" and [[Fobos-Grunt]].

===[[Mathematics]] and [[Mathematical modelling|Mathematical Modelling]]===
One of the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth century [[Israel Gelfand|I. M. Gelfand]] was at the head of the Department of heat transmission before his departure for the United States in 1989. He was carrying out the fundamental works on [[functional analysis]], [[algebra]] and [[topology]]. [[Andrey Nikolayevich Tikhonov|A. N. Tikhonov]] worked initially also in these areas of mathematics. However, Tikhonov is better known with his works of more applied orientation, such as methods for solving [[Well-posed problem|ill-posed problems]] ([[Tikhonov regularization]]). Tikhonov also created the theory of [[differential equation]]s with a [[:ru:Уравнение с малым параметром|small parameter]] at the highest derivative. The general theory of stability of [[Finite difference method|difference schemes]] was developed by {{nobr|A. A. Samarskii}}. Samarskii considered mathematical modelling as an independent scientific discipline. [[Sergei P. Kurdyumov|S. P. Kurdyumov]] created a whole scientific school in [[nonlinear dynamics]] and [[Synergetics (Haken)|synergetics]] in Russia.

Currently, the existing arsenal of numerical methods is updated and improved in response to the growing complexity of the models and the possibilities of modern [[supercomputer]]s. Scientists of KIAM elaborate [[Grid computing|grid methods]] for solving computational problems, which has led, in particular, to the creation of a declarative language "Norma".&lt;ref name="proj_Norma"&gt;{{Ru icon}} [http://www.parallel.ru/russia/map/data/project18.html Programming languages and systems "Norma"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Computer]]s and [[Computer programming|Programming]]===
The institute is always supplied with the most modern computer technology, which  the domestic industry could put. The first studies were carried out still on [[mechanical calculator]]s "Mercedes" by a large staff of estimators. In 1955, the first domestically produced [[computer]] "Strela" appeared, and, in particular, the orbit of the first satellite was calculated with use of it.

Currently, work is underway to create a distributed computing systems based on combining several [[supercomputer]]s, which are used for grid - technology and developed a specialized [[operating system]] (DVM).

===[[Robotics]]===
Currently, work on the robotics  are carried out in:
* the Group of {{nobr|V. E. Pavlovsky}} of the Sector under guidance of {{nobr|A. K. Platonov}} (virtual football&lt;ref name="proj_football"&gt;{{Ru icon}} [http://www.keldysh.ru/pages/robosoccer/ The project "Virtual football" of KIAM RAS]&lt;/ref&gt;),
* the Group of {{nobr|S. M. Sokolov}} ([[Computer vision|vision systems]]),
* the Group of {{nobr|V. E. Pryanishnikova}}  (autonomous tracked vehicles).
Work is also continuing on the establishment of six-legged walking machine.

===[[Computational biology]]===
Since 2016, the sphere of interests of KIAM includes also computational biology problems, which are solved in [[Institute of Mathematical Problems of Biology|IMPB RAS — Branch of KIAM RAS]] in [[Pushchino]].

===Specialized research projects===
* The project "[[Spektr-R|RadioAstron]]"
* The project "Norma"&lt;ref name="proj_Norma" /&gt;
* The project "DVM"
* The project "GNS"
* The project "grid" (multiprocessor computations)
* The project "Virtual football"&lt;ref name="proj_football" /&gt; 
* [[International Scientific Optical Network]] (ISON)

===Teaching and social activities===
Most of the leading employees of '''KIAM''' worked part-time as professors of the [[Moscow State University]] and [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology]]. {{nobr|A. N. Tikhonov}} was the organizer and first Dean of the [[MSU Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics|Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics]].

{{nobr|I. M. Gelfand}} was engaged in mathematical education of secondary school pupils.

==History==

===Milestones===
The institute is located in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]]. In 1978, it is named after [[Mstislav Keldysh]]. The institute was created in 1966 when it split from [[Steklov Institute of Mathematics]]. Already as the Department of Applied Mathematics of Steklov Institute it had conducted some outstanding research in the field of space exploration: in 1953 it developed the method of ballistic [[spacecraft]] descent, that was used on April 12, 1961 for [[Yuri Gagarin]]'s return to the Earth, and in 1957 [[Sputnik 1]] orbit was calculated there using the [[computer]] processing of [[observation|optical observation]] data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ru icon}} [http://www.applmat.ru/pages/anniver/achievment/3_appl_mech.htm 50th anniversary of the Institute — Applied celestial mechanics]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the reorganization in [[Russian Academy of Sciences|RAS]] of 2015—2016 years&lt;ref&gt;{{Ru icon}} [http://www.keldysh.ru/fano.pdf The order on accession IMPB to the KIAM]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Institute of Mathematical Problems of Biology]] became a branch of '''KIAM'''.

'''KAPSARC''', the abbreviation for the King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center, is located in [[Riyadh]], [[Saudi Arabia]], where it began its activities in 2010. It is as an independent, non-profit institution that focuses on research in energy economics, policy, technology, and the environment. Its research areas include global energy markets and economics, energy efficiency and productivity, energy and environmental technologies, and carbon management. The organization has a multi-national research team.

It was established by King [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia]] as an element of the broader theme of reform in the region and emphasizes the openness, equality, and diversity of gender, nationality, and backgrounds—in a manner similar to the [[King Abdullah University of Science and Technology]]. The Center has employees from over 20 nationalities, and its workforce is 40% women.

==History==

In July 2007, King [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia]] called for the establishment of an independent center to conduct objective and scientific research in the field of energy. Interim management was given to [[Saudi Aramco]] in 2008 to plan the center’s mandate and facilities. The Center’s real existence started in 2012. The center started operating in 2013.

==Governance==

KAPSARC is an autonomous institution, financially and legally. It is funded by proceeds from its own endowment and only reports to an internationally composed Board of Trustees, consisting of six members, including the chairman, the president, and four independent members, who set policies and approve the strategic, operational, and financial plans of the Center. Members include His Excellency [[Muhammed Al-Jasser|Dr. Muhammad Al-Jasser]] and [[Keith O'Nions|Sir Keith O’Nions]]. US Secretary of Energy [[Ernest Moniz]] was a founding member of the Board of Trustees but had to step down to accept his  new role as Secretary of Energy

KAPSARC also has an International Advisory Council that advises on ongoing programs and research projects. It consists of several members of international stature, such as [[John Hamre]], [[Daniel Yergin]], [[George M. Whitesides]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kapsarc.org/kapsarc/governance/Governance KAPSARC Governance]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
The KAPSARC campus on the northern edge of Ridyah contains both a Residential Campus (called the REC, located on the west side of the property) and a Research and Office Complex (called the ROC, located on the east side)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Residential Campus section of KASPARC website|url=https://www.kapsarc.org/careers/|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Assumptive framework ==
Menachem Mazabow wrote that it "is necessary... to state the set of assumptions that are seen as fundamental to any neuro-epistemological inquiry."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Neuro-epistemology: A Post-modernist Analysis of the Neuro-sciences |author=Mazabow, Menachem, Alban Burke, &amp; Anita Stuart |publisher=Health SA Gesondheid |year=2004 |page=57 |url=http://www.ajol.info/index.php/hsa/article/viewFile/10251/2339}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include: 
# The significance of revealing the suppositions which influence one’s behavior (the self-reflexive connection between meaning and behavior).
# The larger socio-politico-historical contextual effects on one’s individual assumptions.
# The power relations deeply rooted in the dominant discourses in a field and their overpowering effect on different modes of thought.
# The unavoidably context-dependent and subjective nature of all concepts, compared to objective systems of validity. 
# The importance of examining embedded assumptions and of concentrating on the association between idea and context.
# The affirmation that appropriate theorizing is a certainty of our nature as language observers and directing theorists in the direction of improving awareness of their fundamental responsibility.
# The assertion that the concept of efficacy, instead of objective validity should be the fulcrum in the evaluation of theory.

== Application ==
Brown has noted the "tacit bias" in any observation, which is rooted in "assumptions on the nature of mind" that shape the research,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Preliminaries for a theory of mind |author= Brown, JB |publisher=Goldberg, E ed.1990: Contemporary Neuropsychology: The Legacy of Luria |year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for Hanlan and Brown, theory does not arise from data alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Micro-genesis: Historical review and current studies. |author1=Hanlan, ER  |author2=Brown, JW.  |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Ardila, A &amp; Ostrosky, S  eds  Brain organization of language and cognitive processes. |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crick has stated that it is impossible to pursue a difficult programme of research in neuroscience without some preconceived ideas, seen as inevitable by Churchland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=The astonishing hypothesis: The scientific search for the soul. |author= Crick, F. |publisher=New York: Simon &amp; Schuster. |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Neurophilosophy: Toward a unified science of the mind-brain. |author= Churchland, PS. |publisher=Cambridge: MIT Press. |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stein, Brailowsky and Will have opined that such preconceptions about the central nervous system have tended to hamper research in certain areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Brain repair.|author1=Stein, DG |author2=Brailowsky, S. |author3= |author4=Will, B. |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Oxford University Press. |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Object conservation''' involves the [[Conservation-restoration|preservation]] of three-dimensional works of art. This type of [[conservator-restorer|conservator]] is differentiated from other specialists because they treat a broad range of objects and material types. This classification of material includes [[archaeological]], [[ethnographic]], [[historical]], [[sculpture]], [[decorative arts]], and [[contemporary art]].

==Archaeological conservation==
This type of conservator specializes in the preservation of artifacts that are excavated from a burial environment. These environments can be in a terrestrial setting or underwater. Archaeological conservators work closely with archaeologists to identify what the conservation needs of an excavation site are and assist in setting up field laboratories.

{{For|the work by H. G. Wells|The Outline of History}}

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to history:

'''[[History]]''' – discovery, collection, organization, and presentation of information about past events. History can also mean the period of time after writing was invented (the beginning of  [[recorded history]]).


== Nature of history ==
History can be described as all of the following:
* [[Academic discipline]] – body of knowledge given to – or received by – a disciple (student); a branch or sphere of knowledge, or field of study, that an individual has chosen to specialise in.
** one of the [[humanities]] – academic discipline that study the human condition, using methods that are primarily analytical, critical, or speculative, as distinguished from the mainly empirical approaches of the natural sciences.
* [[Fields of science|Field of science]]  – widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature.  Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer reviewed research is published.  There are many sociology-related scientific journals.
** [[Social science]]  – field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of human society.

===Essence of history===
* [[Chronology]] &amp;ndash; science of arranging events in their order of occurrence in time, such as in [[historical timeline]]s.
* [[Past]] &amp;ndash; totality of events which occurred before a given point in time. The past is contrasted with and defined by the present and the future. The concept of the past is derived from the linear fashion in which human observers experience time, and is accessed through memory and recollection. The past is the domain of history.
* [[Time]] &amp;ndash; measure in which events can be ordered from the past through the present into the future, and also the measure of durations of events and the intervals between them. Time is often referred to as the fourth dimension, along with the three spatial dimensions. History describes what happened where, but also when (in time) those events took place.

== Historical disciplines ==
* [[Archaeology]] – study of past human cultures through the recovery, documentation and analysis of material remains and environmental data
* [[Archontology]] – study of historical offices and important positions in state, international, political, religious and other organizations and societies
* [[Art history]] – study of changes in and social context of art
* [[Chronology]] – locating events in time
* [[Cultural history]] – study of culture in the past
* [[Diplomatic history]] – study of the historical foreign policy and diplomacy of states 
* [[History of science]] – study of the emergence and development of scientific inquiry
* [[Economic history]] – the study of economics in the past
* [[Environmental history]] – study of natural history and the human relationship with the natural world
* [[Futurology]] – study of the future: researches the medium to long-term future of societies and of the physical world
* [[Historiography]] &amp;ndash; both the study of the methodology of historians and development of history as a discipline, and also to a body of historical work on a particular subject. The historiography of a specific topic covers how historians have studied that topic using particular sources, techniques, and theoretical approaches.
* [[Intellectual history]]
* [[History painter|History painting]] – painting of works of art having historical motifs or depicting great events
* [[Military history]] – study of warfare and wars in history
* [[Naval history]] – branch of military history devoted to warfare at sea or in bodies of water
* [[Paleography]] – study of ancient texts
* [[Philosophy of history]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Political history]] – study of past political events, ideas, movements, and leaders
* [[Public history]] – presentation of history to public audiences and other areas typically outside academia
* [[Psychohistory]] – study of the psychological motivations of historical events
* [[Social history]] – study of societies and social trends in the past
* [[Universal history]] – study of trends and dynamics in world history
* [[Urban history]] – historical nature of cities and towns, and the process of urbanization
* [[Women's history]] – study of the roles of women throughout history 
* [[World history]] – study of global or transnational historical patterns

About the PINSTECH, [[Edward Durell Stone|Edward Stone]] once inscribed in these words: "This....has been my greatest work. I am proud that it looks like it belongs in this country.."&lt;ref name="Stanford University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Khan|first1=Feroz Hassan|title=Eating grass the making of the Pakistani bomb|date=2012|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Palo Alto|isbn=0804784809|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yGgrNAsKZjEC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=PINSTECH+Edward+stone&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kl9oVKWYL4arjAKx-4GQAg&amp;ved=0CCAQuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific library of the institute consisted of a large section containing loaded historical references and literature on [[Manhattan Project]], brought by Abdus Salam in 1971 prior to start of the Nuclear weapons programme under Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.&lt;ref&gt;Shahidur Rehman, §The Theoretical Physics Group, A Cue from Manhattan Project?, pp51-100, ''Long Road to Chagai'', 1999, Printwise Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main article|Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|Science in Pakistan}}

The roots of the institution dated back to 1951 when [[Abdus Salam]]– a young and ambitious scientist– returned to Pakistan to join [[University of the Punjab]].&lt;ref name="Oxford University press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fraser|first1=Gordon|title=Cosmic Anger: Abdus Salam - The First Muslim Nobel Scientist|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University press|isbn=0191578665|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QFiaRfzuWXwC&amp;pg=PT217&amp;dq=PINsTECH+ABDUS+SALAM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Xm1pVIu9LYTpiQLvx4DoCg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=PINsTECH%20ABDUS%20SALAM&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After facing a fierce opposition from his fellow scientists at the physics department of the [[University of the Punjab]] in 1953, Salam soon faced the choice between [[Intellectual Decathlon|intellectual death]] or migration to the stimulating environment of a western institutions from Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Oxford University press"/&gt; This realization left a deep impression on him and behind his determination to create an institution to which physicists from the [[Developing country|developing countries]] would come as a right to interact with their peers from industrially [[Developed country|advanced countries]] without permanently leaving their own countries.&lt;ref name="Oxford University press"/&gt; Establishing the world class physics research institute, roughly equivalent to [[CERN]], in Pakistan was a dream of Dr. [[Abdus Salam]] who initiated the establishment of PINSTECH.&lt;ref name="Oxford University press"/&gt;

Together with dr. [[I. H. Usmani]], Salam initiated the deal with the [[United States]] to established the P in [[Nilore]] and gave its first directorship to [[nuclear physicist]] dr. [[Rafi Muhammad Chaudhry]] of the [[Government College University, Lahore]] (GCU). For sometime, the PINSTECH became affiliated with the [[Quaid-i-Azam University]] in 1967, bearing some special materials testing.&lt;ref name="World Scientific"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lai|first1=editors, Z. Hassan &amp; C.H.|title=Ideals and realities : selected essays of Abdus Salam|date=1983|publisher=World Scientific|location=Singapore|isbn=9971950871|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tf1UxncAcM0C&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=PINsTECH+ABDUS+SALAM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Q2tpVJvqNZGrjALw04HQAg&amp;ved=0CDMQuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=PINsTECH%20ABDUS%20SALAM&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, the scientists from [[Institute of Theoretical Physics, Qau|Institute of Theoretical Physics]] at the [[Quaid-i-Azam University]] joined the PINSTECH to engage research in physics.&lt;ref name="Oxford University press"/&gt; After the war with India in 1971, [[President of Pakistan]] [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] orchestrated to established an efforts towards a [[Pakistan and its Nuclear Deterrent Program|nuclear deterrence]] loosely based on [[Manhattan Project]] of the 1940s.&lt;ref name="Stanford University Press" /&gt; Salam took over the operations of PINSTECH institute to oversee the [[research and development]], and its eventual production of the weapons in 1972.&lt;ref name="Stanford University Press" /&gt;

In 1970s, the PINSTECH was an epicenter and a focal point for Pakistani scientists to conduct research in physics where the basic and applied science research in PINSTECH picked up its speed, when Pakistani scientists feared that [[India]] was rapidly [[India and weapons of mass destruction|developing an atomic bomb]].&lt;ref name="Stanford University Press" /&gt; The facility continues its expansion in [[Nilore]] by the [[Pakistan Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]].&lt;ref name="Stanford University Press" /&gt;  As [[Nilore]] became restricted and secret city, the site was one of the integral site for the nuclear weapons research.&lt;ref name="Stanford University Press" /&gt; In its initial years, the PINSTECH activities were directed towards reprocessing the [[Reactor-grade plutonium|civilian-grade]] [[plutonium]] to [[Weapon-grade|military-grade]] plutonium.&lt;ref name="Stanford University Press" /&gt; The worked carried out on 20 different laboratories and facilities ran under [[Munir Ahmad Khan]] in 1970s. Its first division, the ''New Labs'' was dedicated to the production of the weapon grade plutonium of  &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;[[Plutonium-239|Pu]]. In 1983, Nuclear Physics Division working under [[Ishfaq Ahmad]] successfully produced the  &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;[[Plutonium-239|Pu]], a weapon grade plutonium.&lt;ref name="Stanford University Press" /&gt; Throughout the formulative year, the scientists and engineers at PINSTECH carried out technologically advanced research at the PINSTECH. In May 30, 1998, the PAEC scientists and engineers had performed the second nuclear test—codename [[Chagai-II]]— of a fissionable device, and the device's weapon grade plutonium was produced at the New Labs. The research reactors at the institute were last upgraded by Munir Ahmad Khan — chairman of PAEC at that time — as he led both Electronics Division (ED) and Nuclear Engineering Division (NED) in 1989.&lt;ref name="Stanford University Press" /&gt;

As of today, PINSTECH has been shifted to peacetime research in  medicine, biology, materials and physics. Its [[Molybdenum|Molybdenum-42]] facility was used to medical [[radioisotopes]] for treating cancer. Scientists from Nuclear Institute for Agriculture and Biology (NIAB) and Nuclear Institute for Food and Agriculture (NIFA) had been using the PINSTECH facilities to conduc advanced research in both medical and food sciences.

== Research==

PINSTECH is the most advanced facility in the country having state of the art equipment and instruments for doing R &amp; D work; therefore it remain an obvious choice for the students and researchers from all over Pakistan where they could find many important techniques under one roof. Recently the famous concept of centralized analysis facility has been utilized where a researcher can go and work with any piece of nuclear equipment that the researcher has been assigned.  The Central Diagnostic Laboratory (CDL) and Central Analytical Facility (CAF) are the most potent facilities in Pakistan.

PINSTECH promotes [[ASTM C 1112|applications of radiation]] and [[Silex Process|isotope technology]] in various [[scientific]] and [[technological]] disciplines to support the nation. It is also working on important non-nuclear fields, which are crucial for the development of science and technology  in the country.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3263">'''The period eye''' is a concept that was devised by [[Michael Baxandall]] and described in his innovative ''Painting and Experience in Fifteenth-Century Italy: A Primer in the Social History of Pictorial Style'' where he used it to describe the cultural conditions under which art in the [[Renaissance]] was created, viewed, and understood.

==The concept==
Baxandall argued that everyone processes visual information in the brain in a different way, using a combination of innate skills and skills based on experience, which are often culturally determined. He suggested that cultural factors influence the visual characteristics that are attractive at any particular time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~dartfac/features/0102/art.html "In the Eyes of the Beholder" by Tamara Steinert] Dartmouth Faculty Scholarship Today - Features, 2003. Retrieved 23 November 2011.[https://www.webcitation.org/63Q7gHwSO Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt; The period eye examines how artists and their works functioned in their original social, commercial and religious context and has been called an "''...anthropological analysis of a society’s visual culture''." &lt;ref&gt;Langdale, A. (1999) "Aspects of the Critical Reception and Intellectual History of Baxandall's Concept of the Period Eye." in Rifkin, A. (ed.) ''About Michael Baxandall''. Wiley-Blackwell, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; that "''...emphasizes the cultural constructedness of vision...''".&lt;ref&gt;Randolph, A.W. (2004), "Gendering the Period Eye: Deschi da Parto and Renaissance Visual Culture" in ''Art History'', Volume 27, Issue 4, pp. 538-562.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept attempts to  reconstruct the mental and visual equipment brought to bear on works of art in a particular place and time and "''...the social acts and cultural practices that shape attention to visual form within a given culture''." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/inmemoriam/michaeldavidkighleybaxandall.html In Memoriam: Michael David Kighley Baxandall by [[Margaretta M. Lovell]] &amp; Elizabeth Honig.] University of California, 2009. Retrieved 23 November 2011. [https://www.webcitation.org/63QB5axud Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Baxandall developed the concept in greater detail in the case-studies in ''The Limewood Sculptors of Renaissance Germany'' (1980) and ''Patterns of Intention'' (1985).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/2575466/Michael-Baxandall.html "Michael Baxandall" in ''The Telegraph'' 17 August 2008.] Retrieved 22 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philip Weller''' (born 1956) is a Canadian environmental scientist.

==Biography==
Philip Weller studied environmental science at the [[University of Waterloo]] in Canada and received a Master of Urban and Regional Planning degree from the same university with a focus on rehabilitation and clean-up of environmental hot spots within the Great Lakes of North America.&lt;ref name=danubewatch&gt;{{cite web|title=Portrait of Philip Weller and biography in Danube Watch Magazine|url=http://www.icpdr.org/icpdr/static/dw2003_2/dw0203p04.htm|accessdate=9 February 2011|date=February 20, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later he served for four years as director of Great Lakes United dealing with environmental measures in the [[Great Lakes]] area and as a program director of [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] International (Danube Carpathian Programme) in Austria. As a consultant, he managed projects in both Canada and Austria and completed assignments for governments and international organisations. Between 2003 and 2013, he was executive secretary of the [[International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River]]. Since 2013, he is project manager for the International Association of Water Supply Companies in the Danube River Catchment Area (IAWD).

In February 2000, EU Commissioner for the Environment [[Margot Wallström]] appointed him as a member of the [[Baia Mare]] Task Force. In 2003, he became executive secretary of the ICPDR at its headquarters in Vienna. Philip Weller is author of three books on environmental topics, including ‘Freshwater Seas’, an environmental history of the Great Lakes of North America. He is married to an Austrian and is father of two sons.&lt;ref name=official-bio&gt;{{cite web|title=Official biography published by the ICPDR in 2003|url=http://www.icpdr.org/icpdr-files/9392|accessdate=9 February 2011|date=February 20, 2003|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726170953/http://www.icpdr.org/icpdr-files/9392|archivedate=26 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7603">'''Planetary management''' is intentional global-scale management of [[Earth]]'s [[biological]], [[chemical]] and [[physical property|physical]] processes and [[Biogeochemical cycle|cycles]] ([[Water cycle|water]], [[Carbon cycle re-balancing|carbon]], [[Nitrogen cycle|nitrogen]], [[Sulfur cycle|sulfur]], [[Phosphorus cycle|phosphorus]], and others). Planetary management also includes managing [[human]]ity’s influence on planetary-scale processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v400/n6743/full/400399a0.html|title=A manual for planetary management|accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Effective planetary management aims to prevent destabilisation of [[Earth's climate]], protect [[biodiversity]] and maintain or improve human well-being. More specifically, it aims to benefit society and the [[World economy|global economy]], and safeguard the [[ecosystem services]] upon which humanity depends – global [[climate]], [[freshwater]] supply, [[food]], [[energy]], clean air, fertile [[soil]], [[pollinators]], and so on.

Because of the sheer complexity and enormous scope of the task, it remains to be seen whether planetary management is a feasible paradigm for maintaining global [[sustainability]].  The concept currently has defenders and critics on both sides: [[environmentalist]] [[David W. Orr]] questions whether such a task can be accomplished with human help and technology or without first examining the underlying human causes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Orr |first=David W. |authorlink=David W.

The term has been around in science fiction novels since the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} In 2004, the [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]] published “Global Change and the Earth System, a planet under pressure.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|title=Global Change and the Earth System|accessdate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429214445/http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|archivedate=2010-04-29|df=}} [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]]&lt;/ref&gt; The publication’s executive summary concluded: “An overall, comprehensive, internally consistent strategy for stewardship of the Earth system is required”. It stated that a research goal is to define and maintain a stable equilibrium in the global environment. In 2009, the [[planetary boundaries]] concept was published in the science journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]. The paper identifies nine boundaries in the Earth system. Remaining within these nine boundaries, the authors suggest, may safeguard the current equilibrium.

In 2007, France called for [[UNEP]] to be replaced by a new and more powerful organization, the [[United Nations Environment Organization]]. The rationale was that UNEP’s status as a programme, rather than an organization in the tradition of the [[World Health Organization]] or the [[World Meteorological Organization]], weakened it to the extent that it was no longer fit for purpose given current knowledge of the state of Earth. The call was backed by 46 countries. Notably, the top five emitters of [[greenhouse gas]]es failed to support the call.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL03357553._CH_.2400 |title=46 nations call for tougher U.N. environment role|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=2007-02-03|first=Alister|last=Doyle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison with other environmental worldviews ==
Together with planetary management, [[stewardship]] and [[environmental wisdom]] are different ways to manage the Earth&lt;ref name=cosm&gt;[http://www.brighthub.com/environment/green-living/articles/11650.aspx Donna Cosmato, ''What's Your Environmental Worldview?'']&lt;/ref&gt; or "[[environmental worldview]]s".

In particular:
* Planetary management focus its attention on humans needs and wants, while stewardship aim at the benefit of humans, organisms and ecosystems of the Earth:&lt;ref name=cosm/&gt; in other words, planetary management considers humans as the most important species in the Earth, while stewardship and environmental wisdom consider all the species at the same level of importance.
* To accomplish its scope, planetary management relies on technology and innovation (as stewardship and [[spaceship-earth worldview]]), while environmental wisdom relies on the lesson learned from nature.&lt;ref name=cosm/&gt;

'''Radiosynthesis'''  is the theorized capture and [[metabolism]], by living organisms, of energy from [[ionizing radiation]], analogously to [[photosynthesis]]. Metabolism of ionizing radiation was theorized as early as 1956 by the Russian S. I. Kuznetsov.&lt;ref name=Kuznetsov&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuznetsov|first1=S. I.|title=On the Question of Possibility of "Radiosynthesis"|journal=Mikrobiologiya|date=March 1, 1956|language=Russian|osti=4367507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1990s, researchers at the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] uncovered some 200 species of apparently [[radiotrophic fungus|radiotrophic fungi]] containing the pigment [[melanin]] on the walls of the reactor room and in the surrounding soil.&lt;ref name="Zhdanova-1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhdanova|first1=N.

Following the Russian results, an American team at the [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]] of [[Yeshiva University]] in New York began experimenting with radiation exposure of melanin and melanized fungi. They found that ionizing radiation increased the ability of melanin to support an important metabolic reaction, and that ''[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]'' fungi grew three times faster than normal.&lt;ref name="Dadachova-paper"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dadachova|first1=Ekaterina|last2=Bryan|first2=Ruth A.|last3=Huang|first3=Xianchun|last4=Moadel|first4=Tiffany|last5=Schweitzer|first5=Andrew D.|last6=Aisen|first6=Philip|last7=Nosanchuk|first7=Joshua D.|last8=Casadevall|first8=Arturo|title=Ionizing Radiation Changes the Electronic Properties of Melanin and Enhances the Growth of Melanized Fungi|journal=PLOS One|date=May 23, 2007|volume=2|issue=5|page=e457|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000457|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000457|accessdate=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Balter"/&gt; Microbiologist Ekaterina Dadachova suggested such fungi could serve as a food supply and source of [[radiation protection]] for [[interplanetary spaceflight|interplanetary astronauts]], who would be exposed to [[cosmic ray]]s.&lt;ref name="Balter"/&gt;

In 2014, the American research group was awarded a patent for a method of enhancing the growth of [[microorganisms]] through increasing melanin content. The inventors of this process claimed their [[fungus|fungi]] were employing radiosynthesis, and hypothesized that radiosynthesis may have played a role in early life on Earth, by allowing melanized fungi to act as [[autotroph]]s.&lt;ref name=Dadachova&gt;{{cite patent | country = US | number = 8652827 B2 | status = patent | title = Radiosynthesis as an alternative energy utilization process in melanized organisms and uses thereof | pubdate = February 18, 2014 | fdate = April 2, 2007 | pridate = April 5, 2006 | inventor = Dadachova, Ekaterina; Bryan, Ruth; Casadevall, Arturo | assign1 = [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]] of [[Yeshiva University]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chemical background ==

In sea water, ROS can be generated through abiotic as well as biotic processes, among which are the radiolysis and photolysis of water molecules and cellular respiration.  According to a model proposed by Fan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.marchem.2008.01.005 |title=Photochemical and biochemical controls on reactive oxygen and iron speciation in the pelagic surface ocean |year=2008 |last1=Fan |first1=Song-Miao |journal=Marine Chemistry |volume=109 |pages=152–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the prediction of ROS in surface waters, the biochemistry mediated by phytoplankton may be just as important for the production of ROS as photochemistry.

First, ROS concentrations are generally low (nanomoles) in seawater.  Second, they may react with other hard to identify molecules that occur in low quantities, resulting in unknown products.

===Superoxide production===

According to Blough &amp; Zepp,&lt;ref name="Blough" /&gt; superoxide is one of the hardest reactive oxygen species to quantify because it is present in low concentrations: 2×10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; M in the open ocean and up to 2×10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;M in coastal areas.  The main sources of biological superoxide in the ocean come from the reduction of oxygen at the cell surface and metabolites released into the water.&lt;ref name="Marshall" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4319/lo.2005.50.4.1172 |title=Extracellular production of superoxide by marine diatoms: Contrasting effects on iron redox chemistry and bioavailability |year=2005 |last1=Kustka |first1=Adam B. |last2=Shaked |first2=Yeala |last3=Milligan |first3=Allen J. |last4=King |first4=D.

At its peak, this reaction occurs with a rate constant on the order of 2.2×10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; – 4.5×10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; L mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;sec&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in seawater.&lt;ref name="KeiberDavid" /&gt;  The dismutation of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide can also be catalyzed by the antioxidant enzyme [[superoxide dismutase]] with a rate constant on the order of 2×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; L mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;sec&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1104/pp.106.082040 |title=Production and Scavenging of Reactive Oxygen Species in Chloroplasts and Their Functions |year=2006 |last1=Asada |first1=K. |journal=Plant Physiology |volume=141 |issue=2 |pages=391–6 |pmid=16760493 |pmc=1475469}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these fast acting processes, the steady state concentration of superoxide is very small. Since superoxide is also moderately reactive towards trace metals and dissolved organic matter, any remaining superoxide is thought to be removed from the water column through reactions with these species.&lt;ref name="KeiberDavid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blough" /&gt; As a result, the presence of superoxide in surface waters has been known to result in an increase of reduced iron.&lt;ref name="Blough" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Moffett"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/es00162a012 |title=Reaction kinetics of hydrogen peroxide with copper and iron in seawater |year=1987 |last1=Moffett |first1=James W. |last2=Zika |first2=Rod G. |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=21 |issue=8 |pages=804–810|bibcode=1987EnST...21..804M }}&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, serves to enhance the availability of iron to phytoplankton whose growth is often limited by this key nutrient.  As a charged radical species, superoxide is unlikely to significantly affect an organism's cellular function since it is not able to easily diffuse through the cell membrane.  Instead, its potential toxicity lies in its ability to react with extracellular surface proteins or carbohydrates to inactivate their functions.&lt;ref name="Fridovich"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=3010872 |year=1986 |last1=Fridovich |first1=I |title=Biological effects of the superoxide radical |volume=247 |issue=1 |pages=1–11 |journal=Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics |doi=10.1016/0003-9861(86)90526-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Although its lifetime is fairly short (about 50 microseconds), superoxide has the potential to reach cell surfaces since it has a diffusion distance of about 320&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name="Cadenas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fridovich" /&gt;

===Hydrogen peroxide production===

The reduction product of superoxide is hydrogen peroxide, one of the most studied reactive oxygen species because it occurs in relatively high concentrations, is relatively stable, and is fairly easy to measure.&lt;ref name="KeiberDavid" /&gt;  It is thought that algal [[photosynthesis]] is one of the major modes of hydrogen peroxide production, while the production of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by stressed organisms is a secondary source.&lt;ref name="Palenik" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Palenik_a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wong" /&gt; In marine systems, hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) exists at concentrations of 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; M in the photic zone,&lt;ref name="Wong" /&gt; but has been found in double those concentrations in parts of the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0967-0645(01)00026-1 |title=The distribution of hydrogen peroxide in the southern and central Atlantic ocean |year=2001 |last1=Yuan |first1=Jinchun |last2=Shiller |first2=Alan M |journal=Deep-Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography |volume=48 |issue=13 |pages=2947–2970|bibcode=2001DSRII..48.2947Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its lifetime, ranging from hours to days in coastal waters, can be as long as 15 days in Antarctic seawater.&lt;ref name="KeiberDavid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blough" /&gt;  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is important in aquatic environments because it can oxidize dissolved organic matter and affect the redox chemistry of iron, copper, and manganese.&lt;ref name="Moffett" /&gt;  Since hydrogen peroxide, as an uncharged molecule, diffuses easily across biological membranes it can directly damage cellular constituents (DNA and enzymes) by reacting with them and deactivating their functions.&lt;ref name="Fridovich_a" /&gt;  In addition, hydrogen peroxide reduces to the hydroxyl radical, the most reactive radical and the one with the greatest possibility for damage.&lt;ref name="Cadenas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fridovich_a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KeiberDavid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blough" /&gt;

===Hydroxyl radical production===

Even though the superoxide and the hydrogen peroxide radicals are toxic in their own right, they become potentially more toxic when they interact to form the hydroxyl radical (OH•).  This proceeds through the iron and copper catalyzed [[Haber–Weiss reaction]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Klebanoff |first=S.J. |editor=Furth, Ralph van |title=Mononuclear phagocytes: functional aspects |year=1980 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff |location=Boston |pages=1105–1141 |isbn=9789024722112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controls of ROS production in algae==

Many algal species have been shown to not only produce reactive oxygen species under normal conditions but to increase production of these compounds under stressful situations.  In particular, ROS levels have been shown to be influenced by cell size, cell density, growth stage, light intensity, temperature, and nutrient availability.

===Cell size===

Oda ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Oda" /&gt; found that differences in the production of ROS were due to the size of the cell.  By comparing four species of flagellates, they showed that the larger species Ichatonella produced the most superoxide and hydrogen peroxide per cell than ''[[Heterosigma akashiwo]]'', ''Olisthodiscus luteus'', and ''Fibrocapsa japonica''.  In a comparison of 37 species of marine microalgae, including dinoflagellates, rhaphidophytes, and chlorophytes, Marshall ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Marshall_a" /&gt; also found a direct relationship between cell size and the amount of superoxide produced.  The largest cells, ''Chattonella marina'', produced up to 100 times more superoxide than most other marine algae (see figure in &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3354/meps09036 |title=Ichthyotoxicity of gymnodinioid dinoflagellates: PUFA and superoxide effects in sheepshead minnow larvae and rainbow trout gill cells |year=2011 |last1=Mooney |first1=BD |last2=Dorantes-Aranda |first2=JJ |last3=Place |first3=AR |last4=Hallegraeff |first4=GM |journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series |volume=426 |pages=213–224|bibcode=2011MEPS..426..213M }}&lt;/ref&gt;). The authors suggest that since ROS is produced as a byproduct of metabolism, and larger cells are more metabolically active than smaller cells, it follows that larger cells should produce more ROS.  Similarly, since photosynthesis also produces ROS, larger cells likely have a greater volume of chloroplasts and would be expected to produce more ROS than smaller cells.

===Algal density===

The production of ROS has also been shown to be dependent on algal cell density. Marshall ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Marshall_a" /&gt; found that for ''Chattonella marina'', higher concentrations of cells produced less superoxide per cell than those with a lower density.  This may explain why some raphydophyte blooms are toxic at low concentration and non-toxic in heavy blooms.&lt;ref name="Twiner"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/plankt/22.10.1961 |title=Possible physiological mechanisms for production of hydrogen peroxide by the ichthyotoxic flagellate ''Heterosigma akashiwo'' |year=2000 |last1=Twiner |first1=M. J. |journal=Journal of Plankton Research |volume=22 |issue=10 |pages=1961–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tang &amp; Gobler&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.hal.2008.10.001 |title=Characterization of the toxicity of ''Cochlodinium polykrikoides'' isolates from Northeast US estuaries to finfish and shellfish |year=2009 |last1=Tang |first1=Ying Zhong |last2=Gobler |first2=Christopher J. |journal=Harmful Algae |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=454–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; also found that cell density was inversely related to ROS production for the alga Cochlodinium polykrikoides.  They found, in addition, that increases of ROS production were also related to the growth phase of algae.  In particular, algae in exponential growth were more toxic than those in the stationary or late exponential phase.  Many other algal species (''[[Heterosigma akashiwo]]'', ''Chattonella marina'', and ''Chattonella antiqua'') have also been shown to produce the highest amounts of ROS during the exponential phase of growth.&lt;ref name="Twiner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PortuneKevin"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1529-8817.2010.00906.x |title=Antioxidant Enzyme Response and Reactive Oxygen Species Production in Marine Raphidophytes1 |year=2010 |last1=Portune |first1=Kevin J. |last2=Craig Cary |first2=Stephen |last3=Warner |first3=Mark E. |journal=Journal of Phycology |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=1161–1171}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Oda ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Oda" /&gt; suggest this is due to actively growing cells having higher photosynthesis and metabolic rates.  Resting stage cells of ''[[Chattonella antiqua]]'' have been shown to generate less superoxide than their motile counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/plankt/16.2.161 |title=Generation of superoxide anion radicals by the marine phytoplankton organism, ''Chattonella antiqua'' |year=1994 |last1=Tanaka |first1=Kazuko |last2=Muto |first2=Yoshinori |last3=Shimada |first3=Masahisa |journal=Journal of Plankton Research |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=161–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Light levels===

Since superoxide is produced through the auto-oxidation of an electron acceptor in photosystem I during photosynthesis, one would expect a positive relationship between light levels and algal ROS production.&lt;ref name="Marshall_a" /&gt;  This is indeed what has been shown: in the diatom ''[[Thallasia weissflogii]]'', an increase in light intensity caused an increase in the production of both superoxide and hydrogen peroxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4319/lom.2009.7.706 |title=Real-time detection of reactive oxygen species generation by marine phytoplankton using flow injection—chemiluminescence |year=2009 |last1=Milne |first1=Angela |last2=Davey |first2=Margaret S. |last3=Worsfold |first3=Paul J. |last4=Achterberg |first4=Eric P. |last5=Taylor |first5=Alison R. |journal=Limnology and Oceanography: Methods |volume=7 |pages=706–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, in the flagellates ''[[Chattonella marina]]'', ''Prorocentrum minimum'', and ''Cochlodinium polykrikoides'', decreases in light levels resulted in decreases in superoxide production,&lt;ref name="Marshall_a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s002270100614 |title=Possible involvement of the glycocalyx in the ichthyotoxicity of ''Chattonella marina'' (Raphidophyceae): Immunological approach using antiserum against cell surface structures of the flagellate |year=2001 |last1=d(-k.). |first1=Kim |last2=t. |first2=Okamoto |last3=t. |first3=Oda |last4=k. |first4=Tachibana |last5=k.s. |first5=Lee |last6=a. |first6=Ishimatsu |last7=y. |first7=Matsuyama |last8=t. |first8=Honjo |last9=t. |first9=Muramatsu |journal=Marine Biology |volume=139 |issue=4 |pages=625–632 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12601-009-0018-z |title=Physiological and biochemical responses of Prorocentrum minimum to high light stress |year=2010 |last1=Park |first1=So Yun |last2=Choi |first2=Eun Seok |last3=Hwang |first3=Jinik |last4=Kim |first4=Donggiun |last5=Ryu |first5=Tae Kwon |last6=Lee |first6=Taek-Kyun |journal=Ocean Science Journal |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=199–204|bibcode=2009OSJ....44..199P }}&lt;/ref&gt; with higher levels produced during the day.  However, because many studies have found ROS production to be relatively high even in the dark, metabolic pathways other than photosynthesis are likely more important for production.&lt;ref name="PortuneKevin" /&gt;  For instance, Liu ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Liu"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jembe.2007.03.007 |title=Effects of nutrients, salinity, pH and light:dark cycle on the production of reactive oxygen species in the alga ''Chattonella marina'' |year=2007 |last1=Liu |first1=Wenhua |last2=Au |first2=Doris W.T. |last3=Anderson |first3=Donald M. |last4=Lam |first4=Paul K.S. |last5=Wu |first5=Rudolf S.S. |journal=Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology |volume=346 |pages=76–86|url=http://darchive.mblwhoilibrary.org/bitstream/1912/1764/1/algal%20ROS%20production%20JEMBE%20revised%206_3_07.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  found that ROS production was regulated by iron concentration and pH.  From this evidence they suggest that ROS production is most likely due to a plasma membrane enzyme system dependent on iron availability.  Similarly, in Heterosigma akashiwo, the depletion of iron and an increase in temperature, not light intensity, resulted in enhanced production of ROS.&lt;ref name="Twiner" /&gt;  Liu ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Liu" /&gt;  found the same relationship with temperature.

==Functions of algal produced ROS==

The active release of reactive oxygen species from cells has a variety of purposes, including a means to deter predators, or a chemical defense for the incapacitation of competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1568-9883(02)00048-3 |title=The toxigenic marine dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense as the probable cause of mortality of caged salmon in Nova Scotia |year=2002 |last1=Cembella |first1=A.D |last2=Quilliam |first2=M.A |last3=Lewis |first3=N.I |last4=Bauder |first4=A.G |last5=Dell'Aversano |first5=C |last6=Thomas |first6=K |last7=Jellett |first7=J |last8=Cusack |first8=R.R |journal=Harmful Algae |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=313–325}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2216/i0031-8884-42-4-406.1 |title=Allelopathy in phytoplankton - biochemical, ecological and evolutionary aspects |year=2003 |last1=Legrand |first1=Catherine |last2=Rengefors |first2=Karin |last3=Fistarol |first3=Giovana O. |last4=Granéli |first4=Edna |journal=Phycologia |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=406–419}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graneli"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Granéli |first1=E. |last2=Hansen |first2=P.

===Chemical defense===

It is not surprising that ROS production may be a form of chemical defense against predators, since at low levels it can damage DNA and at high levels lead to cell necrosis.&lt;ref name="Lesser" /&gt;  One of the most common mechanisms of cellular injury is the reaction of ROS with lipids, which can disrupt enzyme activity and ATP production, and lead to apoptosis.&lt;ref name="Halliwell" /&gt;  Reactions of ROS with proteins can modify amino acids, fragment peptide chains, alter electrical charges, and ultimately inactivate an enzyme's function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0968-0004(86)90221-5 |title=Oxidation of proteins by mixed-function oxidation systems: Implication in protein turnover, ageing and neutrophil function |year=1986 |last1=Stadtman |first1=E.R. |journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences |volume=11 |pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=3036875 |year=1987 |last1=Davies |first1=KJ |title=Protein damage and degradation by oxygen radicals.

The most direct evidence for ROS as a defense mechanism is the fact that many icthyotoxic algae produce greater concentrations of ROS than nonichthyotoxic strains.&lt;ref name="Oda" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marshall_a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yang" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Twiner" /&gt;

===Enhancement of toxic exudates===

It is possible that ROS may not be the actual toxic substance, but may in fact work to make other exudates more toxic by oxidizing them.&lt;ref name="Marshall_a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Okaichi"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Okaichi |first1=Tomotoshi |last2=Mark Anderson |first2=Donald |last3=Nemoto |first3=Takahisa |title=Red tides: biology, environmental science, and toxicology |year=1989 |publisher=Elsevier |location=New York |isbn=9780444013439 |pages=145–176 |chapter=Proceedings of the first international symposium on Red tides}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, ROS from ''Chattonella marina'' have been shown to enhance the toxic effects of fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) on exposed fishes.&lt;ref name="Marshall_a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Okaichi" /&gt;  Similarly, free-fatty acids released from diatom biofilms as products of ROS oxidation of EPA are known to be toxic to zooplankters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1529-8817.2001.00130.x |title=Liberation of 5,8,11,14,17-Eicosapentaenoic Acid and Other Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids from Lipids As a Grazer Defense Reaction in Epilithic Diatom Biofilms |year=2001 |last1=Juttner |first1=Friedrich |journal=Journal of Phycology |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=744–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Fontana ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17886321 |year=2007 |last1=Fontana |first1=A |last2=d'Ippolito |first2=G |last3=Cutignano |first3=A |last4=Romano |first4=G |last5=Lamari |first5=N |last6=Massa Gallucci |first6=A |last7=Cimino |first7=G |last8=Miralto |first8=A |last9=Ianora |first9=A |title=LOX-induced lipid peroxidation mechanism responsible for the detrimental effect of marine diatoms on zooplankton grazers |volume=8 |issue=15 |pages=1810–8 |doi=10.1002/cbic.200700269 |journal=ChemBioChem}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that the interaction of ROS and diatom exudates (such as fatty acid hydroperoxides) are responsible for inhibiting embryonic development and causing larval abnormalities in copepods.  Finally, ROS oxidation of algal polyunsaturated fatty acids have also been shown to deter grazers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ikawa |first=M. |title=Algal polyunsaturated fatty acids and effects on plankton ecology and other organisms |url=http://www.cfb.unh.edu/PDF/2004/UNHCFBR-6-2-2004.pdf |journal=UNH Center for Freshwater Biology Research |volume=6 |issue=2 |year=2004 |pages=17–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competitive advantage===

In addition to impacting predator-prey interactions, the production of ROS may also help an alga get an advantage in the competition for resources against other algae, be a way to prevent fouling bacteria, and act as a signaling mechanism between cells.&lt;ref name="Graneli" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KimDaekyung" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oda_a"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00356297 |title=Oxygen-radical-mediated toxic effects of the red tide flagellate Chattonella marina on Vibrio alginolyticus |year=1992 |last1=Oda |first1=T. |last2=Ishimatsu |first2=A. |last3=Shimada |first3=M. |last4=Takeshita |first4=S. |last5=Muramatsu |first5=T. |journal=Marine Biology |volume=112 |issue=3 |pages=505–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ROS can inhibit photosynthesis in algae&lt;ref name="Lesser" /&gt;  Thus an alga that is more tolerant of ROS than another may produce and release it as a means of decreasing the other species competitive ability.  In addition, ''Chattonella marina'', the most well studied raphydophyte for ROS production, may produce a boundary of ROS that deters other marine microalgae from using nutrients in its vicinity.&lt;ref name="Marshall" /&gt;  Similarly, this boundary could also be a way to discourage bacteria fouling, since the production of ROS is known to inhibit growth and bioluminescent ability in the bacteria ''[[Vibrio alginolyticus]]'' and ''[[Vibrio fischeri]]'', respectively.&lt;ref name="KimDaekyung" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oda_a" /&gt; Lastly, Marshall ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Marshall" /&gt; showed that ''Chattonella marina'' cells were able to change their rate of superoxide production in as little as one hour when in different cell densities, increasing the rate from 1.4 to 7.8 times the original. They suggest that this quick response in altering rates of production may be a form of chemical signaling between cells that works to provide information about cell density.

===Reduction of metals===

ROS may be useful in the oxidation or reduction of necessary or toxic metals.  Since iron is necessary for phytoplankton growth, the auto-reduction of reactive oxygen species may be a way for algae to get usable iron from free or organically bound ferric iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0304-4203(95)00035-p |title=Iron uptake and growth limitation in oceanic and coastal phytoplankton |year=1995 |last1=Sunda |first1=William G. |last2=Huntsman |first2=Susan A. |journal=Marine Chemistry |volume=50 |pages=189–206}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Cakman ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Cakman"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16665677 |year=1987 |last1=Cakmak |first1=I |last2=Van De Wetering |first2=DA |last3=Marschner |first3=H |last4=Bienfait |first4=HF |title=Involvement of superoxide radical in extracellular ferric reduction by iron-deficient bean roots |volume=85 |issue=1 |pages=310–4 |pmc=1054247 |journal=Plant Physiology |doi=10.1104/pp.85.1.310}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that ROS may increase the amount of iron available through extracellular ferric reduction.  It is thought that the high reducing power of this reaction is maintained through the electron-rich superoxide ion.&lt;ref name="Cakman" /&gt;  In several studies on the ROS production of ''Heterosigma akashiwo'', hydrogen peroxide production was found to be inversely proportional to the concentration of iron available.&lt;ref name="Twiner" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4319/lo.2001.46.6.1400 |title=Toxic effects of Heterosigma akashiwo do not appear to be mediated by hydrogen peroxide |year=2001 |last1=Twiner |first1=Michael J. |last2=Dixon |first2=S.

They suggested that when intracellular iron is limiting, the phytoplankton respond by producing more ROS as a way to increase the reducing potential around the cell and thus be better able to reduce that iron to a usable form.  Similarly, lower ROS production would suggest that the intracellular iron is at sufficiently high levels for cellular function.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14282">'''Self-interference cancellation (SIC)''' is a [[signal processing]] technique that enables a radio transceiver to simultaneously transmit and receive on a single channel, a pair of partially-overlapping channels, or any pair of channels in the same frequency band. When used to allow simultaneous transmission and reception on the same frequency, sometimes referred to as “in-band full-duplex” or “simultaneous transmit and receive,” SIC effectively doubles [[spectral efficiency]]. SIC also enables devices and platforms containing two radios that use the same frequency band to operate both radios simultaneously.

Self-interference cancellation has applications in [[cellular network|mobile networks]], the unlicensed bands, [[cable television|cable TV]], [[mesh networking|mesh networks]], the military, and public safety.

In-band full-duplex has advantages over conventional duplexing schemes. A frequency division duplexing (FDD) system transmits and receives at the same time by using two (usually widely separated) channels in the same frequency band. In-band full-duplex performs the same function using half of the spectrum resources. A time division duplexing (TDD) system operates half-duplex on a single channel, creating the illusion of full-duplex communication by rapidly switching back-and-forth between transmit and receive. In-band full-duplex radios achieve twice the throughput using the same spectrum resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/71d8/68ffe337e74e719184b698240ea259b656be.pdf|title=Applications of self-interference cancellation in 5G and beyond|journal=IEEE Communications Magazine|volume=52|number=2|pages=114–121|access-date=2018-04-23|year=2014|last1=Hong|first1=Steven|last2=Brand|first2=Joel|last3=Choi|first3=Jung|last4=Jain|first4=Mayank|last5=Mehlman|first5=Jeff |last6=Katti|first6=Sachin |last7=Levis|first7=Philip}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
A radio transceiver cannot cancel out its own transmit signal based solely on knowledge of what information is being sent and how the transmit signal is constructed. The signal that the receiver sees is not entirely predictable. The signal that appears at the receiver is subject to varying delays. It consists of a combination of leakage (the signal traveling directly from the transmitter to the receiver) and local reflections. In addition, transmitter components (such as mixers and power amplifiers) introduce non-linearities that generate harmonics and noise. These distortions must be sampled at the output of the transmitter. Finally, the self-interference cancellation solution must detect and compensate for real-time changes caused by temperature variations, mechanical vibrations, and the motion of things in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://web.stanford.edu/~skatti/pubs/sigcomm13-fullduplex.pdf|title=Full duplex radios|journal=ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review |volume=43|number=4|pages=375–386|access-date=2018-04-23| year=2013|last1= Bharadia |first1=Dinesh|last2= McMilin |first2=Emily|last3=Katti|first3=Sachin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The transmit signal can be cancelled out at the receiver by creating an accurate model of the signal and using it to generate a new signal that when combined with the signal arriving at the receiver leaves only the desired receive signal. The precise amount of cancellation required will vary depending on the power of the transmit signal that is the source of the self-interference and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that the link is expected to handle in half-duplex mode. A typical figure for Wi-Fi and cellular applications is 110&amp;nbsp;dB of signal cancellation, though some applications require greater cancellation.

Cancelling a local transmit signal requires a combination of analog and digital electronics. The strength of the transmit signal can be modestly reduced before it reaches the receiver by using a circulator (if a shared antenna is used) or antenna isolation techniques (such as cross polarization) if separate antennas are used. The analog canceller is most effective at handling strong signals with a short delay spread. A digital canceller is most effective at handling weak signals with delays greater than 1,000 nanoseconds. The analog canceller should contribute at least 60&amp;nbsp;dB of cancellation. The digital canceller must process both linear and non-linear signal components, producing about 50&amp;nbsp;dB of cancellation. Both the analog and digital cancellers consist of a number of “taps” composed of attenuators, phase shifters, and delay elements. The cost, size, and complexity of the SIC solution is primarily determined by the analog stage. Also essential are the tuning algorithms that enable the canceller to adapt to rapid changes. Cancellation algorithms typically need to adapt at the rate of once every few hundred microseconds to keep up with changes in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first=Jung Il|last=Choi|first2=Mayank|last2=Jain|first3=Kannan|last3=Srinivasan|first4=Philip|last4= Levis|first5=Sachin|last5=Katti|title=Achieving single channel, full duplex wireless communication|conference=MobiCom, 2010.

SIC can also be employed to reduce or eliminate adjacent channel interference. This allows a device containing two radios (such as a Wi-Fi access Point with two 5&amp;nbsp;GHz radios) to use any pair of channels regardless of separation. Adjacent channel interference consists of two main components. The signal on the transmit frequency, known as the blocker, may be so strong that it desensitizes a receiver listening on an adjacent channel. A strong, local transmitter also produces noise that spills over onto the adjacent channel. SIC may be used to reduce both the blocker and the noise that might otherwise prevent use of an adjacent channel.

==Applications==
===In-band full duplex=== 
Transmitting and receiving on the exact same frequency at the exact same time has multiple purposes. In-band full duplex can potentially double spectral efficiency. It permits true full duplex operation where only a single frequency is available. And it enables “listen while talking” operation (see cognitive radio, below).

===Integrated access and backhaul=== 
Though most small cells are expected to be fed using fiber optic cable, running fiber isn’t always practical. Reuse of the frequencies used by a small cell to communicate with users (“access”) for communication between the small cell and the network (“backhaul”) will be part of the 3GPP’s 5G standards. When implemented using SIC, the local backhaul radio’s transmit signal is cancelled out at the small cell’s receiver, and the small cell’s transmit signal is cancelled out at the local backhaul radio’s receiver. No changes are required to the users’ devices or the remote backhaul radio. The use of SIC in this applications has been successfully field-tested by [[Telecom Italia|Telecom Italia Mobile]] and [[Deutsche Telekom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.fiercewireless.com/europe/italy-s-tim-kumu-test-full-duplex-relay-technology-to-double-lte-capacity|title=Italy's TIM, Kumu test full duplex relay technology to double LTE capacity|author= Anne Morris|date=25 January 2016|website=fiercewireless.com|publisher=Fierce Wireless |accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fiercewireless.com/tech/deutsche-telekom-completes-5g-full-duplex-field-trial-kumu-networks|title=Deutsche Telekom completes 5G full duplex field trial with Kumu Networks|author=Monica Alleven|date=28 September 2015|website=fiercewireless.com|publisher=Fierce Wireless |accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Satellite repeaters===
SIC enables satellite repeaters to extend coverage to indoor, urban canyon, and other locations by reusing the same frequencies. This type of repeater is essentially two radios connected back-to-back. One radio faces the satellite, while the other radio faces the area not in direct coverage. The two radios relay the signals (rather than store-and-forward data bits) and must be isolated from each other to prevent feedback. The satellite-facing radio listens to the satellite and must be isolated from the transmitter repeating the signal. Likewise, the indoor-facing radio listens for indoor users and must be isolated from the transmitter repeating their signals to the satellite. SIC may be used to cancel out each radio’s transmit signal at the other radio’s receiver.

===Full-duplex DOCSIS 3.1===
Cable networks have traditionally allocated most of their capacity to downstream transmissions. The recent growth in user-generated content calls for more upstream capacity. Cable Labs developed the Full Duplex DOCSIS 3.1 standard to enable symmetrical service at speeds up to 10 Gbps in each direction. In DOCSIS 3.1, different frequencies are allocated for upstream and downstream transmissions, separated by a guard band.  Full Duplex DOCSIS establishes a new band allowing a mix of upstream and downstream channels on adjacent channels. The headend must support simultaneous transmission and reception across the full duplex band, which requires SIC technology. The cable modems are not required to transmit and receive on the same channels simultaneously, but they are required to use different combinations of upstream and downstream channels as instructed by the headend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cablelabs.com/full-duplex-docsis-3-1-technology-raising-the-ante-with-symmetric-gigabit-service|title=Full Duplex DOCSIS® 3.1 Technology: Raising the Ante with Symmetric Gigabit Service|author=Belal Hamzeh, VP, Research &amp; Development|date=16 February 2016 |website=cablelabs.com|publisher= |accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wireless mesh networks===
Mesh networks are used to extend coverage (to cover entire homes) and for ad-hoc networking (emergency communication). Wireless mesh networks use a mesh topology to provide the desired coverage. The data travels from one node to another until it reaches its destination. In mesh networks using a single frequency, the data is typically store-and-forwarded, with each hop adding a delay. SIC can enable wireless mesh nodes to reuse frequencies so that the data is retransmitted (relayed) as it is received. In mesh networks using multiple frequencies, such as whole-home Wi-Fi networks using “tri-band” routers, SIC can enable greater flexibility in channel selection. Tri-band routers have one 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz and one 5&amp;nbsp;GHz radio to communicate with client devices, and a second 5&amp;nbsp;GHz radio that is used exclusively for internode communication. Most tri-band routers use the same pair of 80&amp;nbsp;MHz channels (at opposite ends of the 5&amp;nbsp;GHz band) to minimize interference. SIC can allow tri-band routers to use any of the six 80-MHz channels in the 5&amp;nbsp;GHz band for coordination both within networks and between neighboring networks.

===Military communication===
The military frequently requires multiple, high power radios on the same air, land, or sea platform for tactical communication. These radios must be reliable even in the face of interference and enemy jamming. SIC enables multiple radios to operate on the same platform at the same time. SIC also has potential applications in military and vehicular radar, allowing radar systems to transmit and receive continuously rather than constantly switching between transmit and receive, yielding higher resolution.

===Spectrum sharing===
National regulatory agencies, such as the [[Federal Communications Commission]] in the U.S., often address the need for more spectrum resources by permitting sharing of underutilized spectrum. For instance, billions of [[Wi-Fi]] and [[Bluetooth]] devices compete for access to the [[ISM bands]]. Smartphones, Wi-Fi routers, and smart home hubs frequently support Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other wireless technologies in the same device. SIC technology enables these devices to operate two radios in the same band at the same time. Spectrum sharing is a topic of great interest to the mobile phone industry as it begins to deploy 5G systems.

===Cognitive radio===
Radios that dynamically select idle channels to make more efficient use of finite spectrum resources are the subject of considerable research. Traditional spectrum sharing schemes rely on Listen-before-talk protocols. However, when two or more radios choose to transmit on the same channel at the same time there is a collision. Collisions take time to detect and resolve. SIC enables listen-while-talking, ensuring immediate detection and faster resolution of collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |title= Full duplex wireless communications for cognitive radio networks |eprint=1105.0034 |year=2013 |last1= Cheng |first1=W. |last2= Zhang |first2=X. |last3=Zhang |first3=H. |class=cs.IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Simons Center for Geometry and Physics''' is a center for theoretical physics and mathematics at [[Stony Brook University]] in  New York. The focus of the center is [[mathematical physics]] and the interface of geometry and physics. It was founded in 2007 by a gift from the [[Simons Foundation|James and Marilyn Simons Foundation]]. The Center's current director is physicist [[Luis Álvarez-Gaumé]].

The Center's permanent faculty currently consists of mathematicians [[Simon Donaldson]] and [[Kenji Fukaya]], and  of physicists [[Nikita Nekrasov]] and [[Zohar Komargodski]]. The Center's academic staff also includes roughly 10 research assistant professors and 20 visiting researchers at any given time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=People at the SCGP - Spring 2011|url=http://www.scgp.stonybrook.edu/?q=node/8|accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematician and former director [[John Morgan (mathematician)|John Morgan]] remains in residence, and is expected to maintain a close long-term association with the Center. Other former faculty members include physicists [[Michael R. Douglas]] and [[Anton Kapustin]].

The Simon Center's  building  was completed in September, 2010. The building is adjacent to the physics and mathematics departments to allow for close collaboration with the mathematics department and the [[C. N. Yang Institute for Theoretical Physics]].  The  building offers {{convert|40000|sqft|m2}} of floor space, spread over six stories, and includes a 236–seat auditorium, a 90–seat lecture hall, offices,  seminar rooms, and a cafe.&lt;ref name="newsletter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stonybrook.edu/facilities/data/facilities-newsletter-2010-09-30.pdf|title=Stony Brook Facilities &amp; Services newsletter|accessdate=4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building is [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Gold certified,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Simon's Center for Geometry and Physics - U.S. Green Building Council|url=http://www.usgbc.org/projects/simons-center-geometry-and-physics|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is connected to  the Math Tower via an elevated walkway. Unknown to many, the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics also contains a café on the second floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scgpcafe.com|title=scgpcafe|website=scgpcafe.com|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[James Harris Simons|James H. Simons]] was the  chair of the mathematics department at Stony Brook from 1968 to 1976. After deciding to leave academia, he then went on to make billions with his investment firm Renaissance Technologies. On February 27, 2008 he announced a donation totaling $60 million (including a $25 million gift two years prior) to the mathematics and physics departments. This was the largest single gift ever given to any of the [[State University of New York|SUNY]] schools.&lt;ref name="newyorktimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Arneson|first=Karen W.|title=$60 Million Gift Is a Record, for Stony Brook |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/28/nyregion/28prof.html?_r=1|accessdate=6 September 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=28 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gift came during Stony Brook's 50th anniversary and shortly after Gov. Spitzer announced his commitment to make Stony Brook a “flagship” of the SUNY system that would rival the nation’s most prestigious state research universities.&lt;ref name="pressrelease"&gt;{{cite news|title=Stony Brook University Announces $60 Million Gift From Renowned Financier And Former Math Chair James Simons And Wife Marilyn, A Ph.D. Alumna |url=http://commcgi.cc.stonybrook.edu/am2/publish/General_University_News_2/Stony_Brook_University_Announces_60_Million_Gift_From_Renowned_Financier_And_Former_Math_Chair_James_Simons_And_Wife_Marilyn_A_Ph_D_Alumna.shtml|accessdate=6 September 2010|newspaper=Stony Brook Press Release|date=28 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his announcement speech, Jim Simons said “From Archimedes to Newton to Einstein, much of the most profound work in physics has been deeply intertwined with the geometric side of mathematics. Since then, in particular with the advent of such areas as quantum field theory and string theory, developments in geometry and physics have become if anything more interrelated. The new Center will give many of the world's best mathematicians and physicists the opportunity to work and interact in an environment and an architecture carefully designed to enhance progress. We believe there is a chance that work accomplished at the Center will significantly change and deepen our understanding of the physical universe and of its basic mathematical structure.”&lt;ref name=pressrelease /&gt; The Center results from extensive thought and planning between faculty, department chairs, and others, including [[Cumrun Vafa]] of Harvard, who directs the Simons Foundation-supported summer institutes on string theory at Stony Brook, and [[Isadore Singer]] of MIT.&lt;ref name=pressrelease /&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Du Bois, W. E. B..jpg|thumb|[[W. E. B. Du Bois]], author of the essay ''[[The Souls of Black Folk]].'']]
The concept of privilege dates back to 1903 when American [[sociologist]] and [[historian]] [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] published the essay ''[[The Souls of Black Folk]]'', in which he wrote that although [[African American]]s were observant about [[white Americans]] and conscious of [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975|racial discrimination]], white Americans did not think much about African Americans, nor about the effects of racial discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Revealing Whiteness: The Unconscious Habits of Racial Privilege|last = Sullivan|first = Shannon|publisher = Indiana University Press|year = 2006|isbn = 978-0253218483|location = |pages = 121–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = W.E.B.

In 1988, American [[feminism|feminist]] and anti-racism activist [[Peggy McIntosh]] published the essay ''White Privilege and Male Privilege: A Personal Account of Coming to See Correspondences through Work in Women’s Studies'', in which she documented forty-six privileges which she, as a white person, experienced in the United States. For example: "I can be sure that if I need legal or medical help, my race will not work against me", and "I do not have to educate my children to be aware of [[systemic racism]] for their own daily physical protection". McIntosh described [[white privilege]] as an "invisible package of unearned assets" which white people do not want to acknowledge, and which leads to them being confident, comfortable, and oblivious about racial issues, while non-white people become unconfident, uncomfortable, and alienated.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; McIntosh's essay has been credited for stimulating academic interest in privilege, which has been extensively studied in the decades since.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Gender and Society|last = O'Brien|first = Jodi A.|publisher = SAGE Publications|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1412909167|location = |pages = 418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Princeton University]] first-year student Tal Fortgang wrote ''Checking My Privilege'', a widely debated article in which he condemned classmates who told him to "check his privilege" for attributing his success in life to "some invisible patron saint of white maleness", and "for casting the equal protection clause, indeed the very idea of a meritocracy, as a myth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theprincetontory.com/main/checking-my-privilege-character-as-the-basis-of-privilege/|title=Checking My Privilege: Character as the Basis of Privilege|last=Fortgang|first=Tal|date=2 April 2014|work=The Princeton Tory|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; McIntosh afterwards told the ''[[New Yorker Magazine|New Yorker]]'' that Fortgang was resisting seeing himself systemically. She argued that everybody has a combination of unearned advantage and unearned disadvantage, and should aim to try to see themselves in the context of societal patterns of discrimination and oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2014/05/the-woman-who-coined-the-term-white-privilege.html|title=The Origins of Privilege|last=Rothman|first=Joshua|date=13 May 2014|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Historically, academic study of social inequality focused mainly on the ways in which minority groups were discriminated against, and ignored the privileges accorded to dominant social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Rethinking the health consequences of social class and social mobility. Social Science &amp; Medicine. Vol. 200, pp. 258-261. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.037 .&lt;/ref&gt; That changed in the late 1980s, when researchers began studying the concept of privilege.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Privilege, as understood and described by researchers, is a function of multiple variables of varying importance, such as [[racism|race]], [[ageism|age]], [[genderism|gender]], [[heteronormativity|sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], [[citizenship]], [[religion]], [[physical ability]], health, level of education, and others. Race, gender and social class are generally felt by sociologists to be the most determinative of a person's overall level of privilege.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Archaeology of Plural and Changing Identities: Beyond Identification|last = Casella|first = Eleanor C.|publisher = Springer|year = 2005|isbn = 9780306486944|location = |pages = 217|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6tNhM_dsYIoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Privilege theory argues that each individual is embedded in a matrix of categories and contexts, and will be in some ways privileged and other ways disadvantaged, with privileged attributes lessening disadvantage and membership in a disadvantaged group lessening the benefits of privilege.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Psychological Perspectives on Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Experiences|last = Garnets|first = Linda|publisher = Columbia University Press|year = 2002|isbn = 978-0231124133|location = |pages = 391}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a white [[lesbian]] [[Professor|university professor]] benefits from racial and educational privilege, but is disadvantaged due to her gender and sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Some attributes of privilege are ordinarily fairly visible, such as race and gender, and others, such as citizenship status and birth order, are not. Some such as social class are relatively stable and others, such as age, wealth, religion and attractiveness, will or may change over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender in the Therapy Hour: Voices of Female Clinicians Working with Men (The Routledge Series on Counseling and Psychotherapy with Boys and Men)|last = Sweet|first = Holly Barlow|publisher = Routledge|year = 2012|isbn = 978-0415885515|location = |pages = 71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some attributes of privilege are at least partly determined by the individual, such as level of education, whereas others such as race or class background are entirely involuntary.

In the context of the theory, privileged people are considered to be "the norm", and, as such, gain invisibility and ease in society, with others being cast as inferior variants.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Privileged people see themselves reflected throughout society both in mass media and face-to-face in their encounters with teachers, workplace managers and other authorities, which researchers argue leads to a sense of entitlement and the assumption that the privileged person will succeed in life, as well as protecting the privileged person from worry that they may face discrimination from people in positions of authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Intercultural Communication: Globalization and Social Justice|last = Sorrells|first = Kathryn|publisher = SAGE Publications|year = 2012|isbn = 978-1412927444|location = |pages = 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awareness of privilege ==
Some academics{{such as|date=October 2018}} highlight a pattern where those who benefit from a type of privilege are unwilling to acknowledge it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Handbook of Racial-Cultural Psychology and Counseling, Training and Practice|last = Carter|first = Robert T.|publisher = Wiley|year = 2004|isbn = 978-0471386292|location = |pages = 432}}&lt;/ref&gt; American sociologist [[Michael Kimmel]] describes the state of having privilege as being "like running with the wind at your back", unaware of invisible sustenance, support and propulsion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The argument may follow that such a denial constitutes a further injustice against those who do not benefit from the same form of privilege.  One writer{{who|date=October 2018}} has referred to such denial as a form of "[[microaggression]]" or microinvalidation that negates the experiences of people who don't have privilege and minimizes the impediments they face.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Microaggressions in Everyday Life: Race, Gender, and Sexual Orientation|last = Sue|first = Derald Wing|publisher = Wiley|year = 2010|isbn = 978-0470491409|location = |pages = 37–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McIntosh wrote that most people are reluctant to acknowledge their privilege, and instead look for ways to justify or minimize the effects of privilege stating that their privilege was fully earned. They justify this by acknowledging the acts of individuals of unearned dominance, but deny that privilege is institutionalized as well as embedded throughout our society. She wrote that those who believe privilege is systemic may nonetheless deny having personally benefited from it, and may oppose efforts to dismantle it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to researchers{{who|date=October 2018}}, privileged individuals resist acknowledging their privileges because doing so would require them to acknowledge that whatever success they have achieved did not result solely through their own efforts. Instead it was partly due to a system that has developed to support them.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The concept of privilege calls into question the idea that society is a [[meritocracy]], which researchers{{who|date=October 2018}} have argued is particularly unsettling for Americans for whom belief that they live in a meritocracy is a deeply held cultural value, and one that researchers commonly characterize as a [[Meritocracy#Criticism|myth]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Deconstructing Privilege: Teaching and Learning as Allies in the Classroom|last = Case|first = Kim|publisher = Routledge|year = 2013|isbn = 978-0415641463|location = |pages =63–64 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Privilege: The Making of an Adolescent Elite at St. Paul's School (Princeton Studies in Cultural Sociology)|last = Khan|first = Shamus Rahman|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 2012|isbn = 978-0691156231|location = |pages = 107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Multicultural Psychology|last = Jackson|first = Yolanda Kaye|publisher = SAGE Publications|location = |pages = 471 |isbn=9781452265568 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=AP1yAwAAQBAJ |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Gendered Society'', Michael Kimmel wrote that when privileged people do not feel personally powerful, arguments that they have benefited from unearned advantages seem unpersuasive.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Seeing White: An Introduction to White Privilege and Race|last = Halley|first = Jean|publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year = 2011|isbn = 978-1442203075|location = |pages = 67, 191}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Explain|date=January 2018}}

=== Examples of Privilege ===

====Workplace sexism====
{{synthesis|reason="Is that statistically significant?"|date=October 2018}}
Hays, a recruitment firm, sent the same job application to thousands of employers, only changing the name. One was "Simon", the other "Susan". Experienced hiring managers offered "Simon" an interview 15% more often than "Susan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/careers/the-same-resume-with-different-names-nets-different-results/news-story/a2a182fb4570e948c27ce63139ee66b1 | title=The same resume with different names nets different results}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Educational Racism====
According to McKinley et al.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Students of color are pushed toward academic failure and continued social disenfranchisement. Racist policies and beliefs, in part, explain why children and young adults from racially marginalized groups fail to achieve academically at the same rate as their White peers.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan McKinley Jones Brayboy, Angelina E. Castagno and Emma Maughan
Review of Research in Education 
Vol. 31, Difference, Diversity, and Distinctiveness in Education and Learning (2007), pp. 159-194&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Criticism ==
The concept of privilege has been criticized for ignoring relative differences among groups. For example, Lawrence Blum argued that in American culture there are status differences among [[Chinese American|Chinese]], [[Japanese American|Japanese]], [[Indian American|Indians]], [[Korean American|Koreans]], and [[Cambodian American|Cambodians]], and among [[African American]]s, black immigrants from the [[Caribbean American|Caribbean]], and black immigrants from [[Africa]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.faculty.umb.edu/lawrence_blum/publications/publications/A57.pdf|title='White privilege': A mild critique|first=Lawrence|last=Blum|date=2008|journal=Theory and Research in Education|volume=6|doi=10.1177/1477878508095586|issue=6(3) |pages=309–321|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blum agreed that privilege exists and is systemic yet nonetheless criticized the label itself, saying that the word "privilege" implies luxuries rather than rights, and arguing that some benefits of privilege such as unimpeded access to [[education]] and [[housing]] would be better understood as rights.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; "[[White privilege]]", Michael Monahan argued, would be more accurately described as the advantages gained by whites through historical disenfranchisement of non-whites rather than something that gives whites privilege above and beyond normal human status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Monahan, Michael J.|year=2014|title=The concept of privilege: a critical appraisal|journal=South African Journal of Philosophy|volume=3|issue=1|pages=73–83|doi=10.1080/02580136.2014.892681|issn=0258-0136|eissn=2073-4867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4371">A '''steel catenary riser''' (SCR) is a common method of connecting a subsea pipeline to a deepwater floating or fixed oil production platform. SCRs are used to transfer fluids like oil, gas, injection water, etc. between the platforms and the pipelines.

==Description==
In the offshore industry the word [[catenary]] is used as an adjective or noun with a meaning wider than is its historical meaning in mathematics. Thus, an SCR that uses a rigid, steel pipe that has a considerable [[bending stiffness]] is described as a catenary. That is because in the scale of depth of the ocean, the bending stiffness of a rigid pipe has little effect on the shape of the suspended span of an SCR. The shape assumed by the SCR is controlled mainly by weight, buoyancy and hydrodynamic forces due to currents and waves. Thus, in spite of using conventional, rigid steel pipe, the shape of an SCR can be closely approximated&lt;ref&gt;Wajnikonis, Christopher J., Robinson, Roy, Interactive Deepwater Riser Design, Analyses and Installation Methodology, IBP42400, 2000 Rio Oil &amp; Gas Expo and Conference, 16–19 October 2000, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil&lt;/ref&gt; with the use of ideal [[catenary]] equations, used historically to describe the shape of a chain suspended between points in space. A chain line has by definition a zero bending stiffness and those described with the ideal catenary equations use infinitesimally short links.

The rigid pipe of the SCR forms a catenary between its hang-off point on the floating or rigid platform, and the seabed. A free-hanging SCR assumes a shape roughly similar to the letter 'J'. A catenary of a lazy wave SCR consists in fact of at least three catenary segments. The top and the seabed segments of the catenary have negative submerged weight, and their curvatures 'bulge' towards the seabed. The middle segment has buoyant material attached along its entire length, so that the ensemble of the steel pipe and the buoyancy is positively buoyant. Accordingly, the curvature of the buoyant segment 'bulges' upwards (inverted catenary), and its shape can also be well approximated with the same ideal [[catenary]] equations. The positively and negatively buoyant segments are tangent to each other at the points where they join. The overall catenary shape of the SCR has at those locations points of inflection. Lazy Wave SCRs were first installed on a turret moored [[FPSO]] offshore Brazil (BC-10, Shell) in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;Wajnikonis, Christopher J., Leverette, Steve, Improvements in Dynamic Loading of Ultra Deepwater Catenary Risers, OTC20180, Offshore Technology Conference, 4–7 May 2009, Houston, Texas, USA http://www.spe.org/jpt/print/archives/2009/09/11NewFieldDev.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; even though Lazy Wave configuration flexible risers had been in a wide use for several decades beforehand.

The SCR pipe and a short segment of pipe lying on the seabed use 'dynamic' pipe, i.e. steel pipe having slightly greater wall thickness than the pipeline wall thickness, in order to sustain dynamic bending and steel [[material fatigue]] associated in the touch-down zone of the SCR. Beyond that the SCR is typically extended with a rigid pipeline, but a use of a flexible pipeline is also feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.tenaris.com/en/Products/OffshoreLinePipe/Risers/SteelCatenaryRisers.aspx | work = Tenaris | title =Steel Catenary Risers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.2hoffshore.com/services/riser-engineering/steel-catenary-risers | work = 2H Offshore | title =Steel Catenary Risers}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The risers are typically 8-12 inches in diameter and operate at a pressure of 2000-5000 psi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Advances in Steel Catanery Riser Design | conference=DEEPTEC'95|first=Hugh|last=Howells|url=http://www.2hoffshore.com/documents/papers/pap020.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Designs beyond those ranges of pipe sizes and operating pressures are also feasible.

Free hanging SCRs were first used by Shell on the Auger tension leg platform in 1994 which was moored in 872 m of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | title = New Frontiers in the Design of Steel Catenary Risers for Floating Production Systems | journal = Journal of Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering  | first =Basim | last =Mekha| date = November 2001| volume=123 | number =4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10571">In [[behavioral psychology]], '''stimulus control''' is a phenomenon that occurs when an organism behaves in one way in the presence of a given [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] and another way in its absence. Any stimulus that modifies behavior in this manner is referred to as a ''[[wikt:discriminative stimulus|discriminative stimulus]]''.  ''Stimulus control of behavior'' occurs when the performance of a particular behavior is controlled by the presence or absence of a discriminative stimulus. For example, the presence of a [[stop sign]] (a discriminative stimulus) at a traffic  intersection increases the probability that "braking" behavior will occur.

Some theorists believe that all behavior is under some form of stimulus control.&lt;ref name = Baum&gt;{{cite book|last=Baum|first=William M.|title=Understanding behaviorism : Behavior, culture, and evolution.|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell Pub.|location=Malden, MA|isbn=140511262X|edition=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the analysis of [[B. F. Skinner]],&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, Burrhus Frederick (1957). Verbal Behavior. Acton, MA: Copley Publishing Group. {{ISBN|1-58390-021-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Verbal Behavior|verbal behavior]] is a complicated assortment of behaviors with a variety of controlling stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Skinner|first=B.F.|title=Verbal behavior|year=1992|publisher=Copley|location=Acton, Mass.|isbn=1583900217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The controlling effects of stimuli are seen in quite diverse situations and in many aspects of behavior.  For example, a stimulus presented at one time may control responses emitted immediately or at a later time; two stimuli may control the same behavior; a single stimulus may trigger behavior A at one time and behavior B at another; a stimulus may control behavior only in the presence of another stimulus, and so on. These sorts of control are brought about by a variety of methods and they play a large role in systematic accounts of behavioral processes.&lt;ref&gt;Catania, A. C. "Learning" 3rd ed, 1992, Prentice Hall, Englewoood Cliffs, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

In simple, practical situations, for example if one were training a dog using operant conditioning, optimal stimulus control might be described as follows: 
* The behavior occurs immediately when the discriminative stimulus is given.
* The behavior never occurs in the absence of the stimulus.
* The behavior never occurs in response to some other stimulus.
* No other behavior occurs in response to this stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pryor | first = Karen | title = Don't Shoot the Dog! | publisher = Ringpress Books Ltd | location = City | year = 2002 | isbn = 1-86054-238-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishing stimulus control through operant conditioning==
{{main|Operant conditioning}}

===Discrimination training===
Operant stimulus control is typically established by discrimination training.  For example, to make a light control a pigeon's pecks on a button, reinforcement only occurs following a peck to the button.  Over a series of trials the pecking response becomes more probable in the presence of the light and less probable in its absence, and the light is said to become a discriminative stimulus or S&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watanabe|first=S|author2=Sakamoto, K. |author3=Wakita, M. |title=Pigeons’ discrimination of paintings by Monet and Picasso|journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior|year=1994|volume=63|issue=2|pages=165–174|doi=10.1901/jeab.1995.63-165|pmid=16812755|pmc=1334394}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtually any stimulus that the animal can perceive may become a discriminative stimulus, and many different schedules of reinforcement may be used to establish stimulus control. For example, a green light might be associated with a VR 10 schedule and a red light associated with a FI 20-sec schedule, in which case the green light will control a higher rate of response than the red light.

===Generalization===
After a discriminative stimulus is established, similar stimuli are found to evoke the controlled response. This is called ''stimulus generalization''. As the stimulus becomes less and less similar to the original discriminative stimulus, response strength declines; measurements of the response thus describe a ''generalization gradient''.

An experiment by Hanson (1959)&lt;ref name = Hanson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hanson|first=H. M.|title=Effects of discrimination training on stimulus generalization|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=1959|volume=58|pages=321–334|doi=10.1037/h0042606}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides an early, influential example of the many experiments that have explored the generalization phenomenon. First a group of pigeons was reinforced for pecking a disc illuminated by a light of 550&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength, and never reinforced otherwise. Reinforcement was then stopped, and a series of different wavelength lights was presented one at a time. The data were displayed as a generalization gradient: the more the wavelength differed from the trained stimulus, the fewer responses were produced.&lt;ref name="Hanson"/&gt;

Many factors modulate the generalization process. One is illustrated by the remainder of Hanson's study, which examined the effects of discrimination training on the shape of the generalization gradient. Birds were reinforced for pecking at a 550&amp;nbsp;nm light, which looks yellowish-green to human observers. The birds were not reinforced when they saw a wavelength more toward the red end of the spectrum. Each of four groups saw a single unreinforced wavelength, either 555 , 560, 570, or 590&amp;nbsp;nm, in addition to the reinforced 550 wavelength. The birds were then tested as before, with a range of unreinforced wavelengths. This procedure yielded sharper generalization gradients than did the simple generalization procedure used in the first procedure. In addition, however, Hansen's experiment showed a new phenomenon, called the "peak shift".  That is, the peak of the test gradients shifted away from the S&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt;, such that the birds responded more often to a wavelength they had never seen before than to the reinforced S&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt;. An earlier theory involving inhibitory and excitatory gradients partially explained the results,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spence|first=K. W.|title=The differential response in animals to stimuli varying in a single dimension|journal=Psychological Review|year=1937|volume=44|pages=430–444|doi=10.1037/h0062885}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A more detailed quantitative model of the effect was proposed by Blough (1975).&lt;ref&gt;Blough, D. S. "Steady state data and a quantitative model of operant generalization and discrimination" Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Process, 1975, 104, 3-21.)&lt;/ref&gt; Other theories have been proposed, including the idea that the peak shift is an example of relational control; that is, the discrimination was perceived as a choice between the "greener" of two stimuli, and when a still greener stimulus was offered the pigeons responded even more rapidly to that than to the originally reinforced stimulus.&lt;ref name = Rachlin&gt;{{cite book|last=Rachlin|first=Howard|title=Introduction to modern behaviorism|year=1991|publisher=W.H. Freeman|location=New York|isbn=0716721767|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Matching to sample ==

In a typical matching-to-sample task, a stimulus is presented in one location (the "sample"), and the subject chooses a stimulus in another location that matches the sample in some way (e.g., shape or color).&lt;ref&gt;Blough, D. S. "Delayed matching in the pigeon" Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior, 1959, 2, 151-160&lt;/ref&gt; In the related "oddity" matching procedure,  the subject responds to a comparison stimulus that does not match the sample. These are called "conditional" discrimination tasks because which stimulus is responded to depends or is "conditional" on the sample stimulus.

The matching-to-sample procedure has been used to study a very wide range of problems.  Of particular note is the "delayed matching to sample" variation, which has often been used to study [[short-term memory]] in animals.  In this variation, the subject is exposed to the sample stimulus, and then the sample is removed and a time interval, the "delay", elapses before the choice stimuli appear.  To make a correct choice the subject has to retain information about the sample across the delay.  The length of the delay, the nature of the stimuli, events during the delay, and many other factors have been found to influence performance on this task.&lt;ref&gt;Bouton, M. E.  "Learning and Behavior: A Contemporary Synthesis" (second edition) Sunderland MA: Sinauer&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cannabinoids ==

In [[aviation]], '''tufts''' are strips of yarn or string, typically around {{convert|15|cm|0|abbr=on}}, attached to an aircraft surface in a grid pattern and imaged during flight. The motion of the tufts during flight can be observed and recorded, to locate flow features such as boundary layer separation and reattachment. Tufting is, therefore, a technique for [[flow visualization]]. They are used in [[aeronautics]] flight testing to study air flow direction, strength, and [[boundary layer]] properties.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

The world's largest bed of tufts (18.6&amp;nbsp;m by 18.6&amp;nbsp;m, 61&amp;nbsp;feet by 61&amp;nbsp;feet) was created at [[NASA Ames Research Center]] to study air flow fields involving a helicopter's rotor disk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=QvIaAgAAQBAJ|title=Helicopter Aerodynamics Volume II|first=Ray|last=Prouty|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Lulu.com|accessdate=19 October 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma''', or '''USAO''', is a public [[liberal arts college]] located in [[Chickasha, Oklahoma]]. It is the only [[State university system|public college]] in Oklahoma with a strictly [[liberal arts]]-focused curriculum and is a member of the [[COPLAC|Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coplac.org/members/ "Member Institutions,"] ''Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges,'' Retrieved January 21, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; USAO is an undergraduate-only institution and grants [[Bachelor's Degree]]s in a variety of subject areas. The school was founded in 1908 as a school for women and from 1912 to 1965 was known as '''Oklahoma College for Women'''. It became coeducational in 1965 and today educates approximately 1,000 students. In 2001, the entire Oklahoma College for Women campus was listed as a [[Historic districts in the United States|National Historic District]].&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;&lt;ref name="natl-register-form"&gt;{{NRHP url|id=01000950|title="NPS Form 10-900:National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Oklahoma College for Women Historic District,"}}, 2001, Accessed January 31, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
After Oklahoma was admitted to statehood in 1907, the new state legislature was tasked with establishing institutions of higher education in the former [[Indian Territory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.okhighered.org/state-system/overview/overview.pdf "The Oklahoma State System of Higher Education,"] ''Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education'', p.5, Updated November 2013. Accessed March 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics gathered by the State Superintendent of Education showed that many young women from Oklahoma chose to attend women's colleges in Kansas, Texas, and Missouri.&lt;ref name="Orr-198"&gt;Orr, 198&lt;/ref&gt; Colonel J.T. O'Neil, the state senator from [[Grady County, Oklahoma|Grady County]], and his daughter, Anne Wade O'Neil, who had graduated from a women's college in Mississippi, appealed to the legislature to authorize the creation of a women's college.&lt;ref name="Orr-198"/&gt; The University was founded on May 16, 1908, with the signing of Senate Bill 249 by Governor [[Charles Haskell]]. The bill, authored by Senator N.P. Stewart of [[Hugo, Oklahoma]], authorized the foundation of the '''Oklahoma Industrial Institute and College for Girls'''. The legislature subsequently appropriated $100,000 for the establishment of the initial buildings for the school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usao.edu/about-usao/early-years "Early Years,"] University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma, Retrieved January 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

A local rancher named J. B. Sparks donated land for the school in memory of his daughter, Nellie. Nellie was a [[Chickasaw]] descendent, and the land had been part of her allotment. The Nellie Sparks Dormitory, which was among the first buildings constructed at the new institution, was named in her honor.&lt;ref name = "EOHC-Chickasha"&gt;Jefferies, Angie. [http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=CH038 "Chickasha,"] ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture'', 2009. Accessed March 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, the school's authorities renamed the school '''Oklahoma College for Women'''. This came about because a probate judge, under the mistaken impression that the "Industrial Institute" was a reform school, sentenced an "incorrigible young woman" to serve time there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usao.edu/about-usao/growth-school "Growth of School,"] University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma, Retrieved January 21, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; This name change was made official by the State Legislature in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Cynthia. [http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=UN013 "University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma"], ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture.''&lt;/ref&gt; The school initially offered four years of high school work and four years of college; those who completed the college course were awarded bachelor's degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Thoburn, Joseph P.

''History of Oklahoma at the Golden Anniversary of Statehood, Volume II'', New York: Lewis Historical Publishing Company Inc., 1957, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 6, 1955, the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education adopted the policy that all state-supported institutions would be racially integrated.&lt;ref&gt;Moon, F.D. "Higher Education and Desegregation in Oklahoma," ''The Journal of Negro Education'', Vol. 27 No. 3: Summer 1958, p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt; That summer, Clydia Troullier became the first black student to enroll at OCW.&lt;ref&gt;Guzman, Jessie P.

Accessed March 20, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1960s, exclusively female universities were declining throughout the nation. The legislature made the school coeducational in 1965, and the school was renamed '''Oklahoma College of Liberal Arts'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://usao.edu/about-usao/ocla "OCLA,"] University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma, Retrieved January 19, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education assigned a new mission to the school: it was to be "experimental in nature" and was to "enroll a select group of students whose aspirations and abilities fit them for an intellectually rigorous and accelerated course of study."&lt;ref&gt;Coffelt, John J., Dan S. Hobbs, and A.J. Brambaugh.

Accessed January 31, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the direction of the ninth President, Robert L. Martin, the university switched to a system of three equal trimesters. In an attempt to attract students interested in vigorous academics, this offered an opportunity for advanced students to quickly move through their studies and graduate early.&lt;ref name="Becoming USAO"&gt;[http://usao.edu/about-usao/becoming-usao "Becoming USAO,"] University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma, Retrieved January 19, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; During this period the Alumni Association became active, donating funds for the building of an on-campus chapel. Other buildings housing classrooms, including Davis Hall, were also built around this time. Dr. Bruce G. Carter took over administrative duties as President in 1972. Under his direction, the school advanced a system of night classes for local adult learners. New scholarships for Freshmen were also made available. Soon after Dr. Carter took office, the legislature moved to rename all public institutions of higher education in the state under a new system: 2-year institutions would be known as "colleges" and 4-year institutions would be known as "universities." This led directly to OCLA's new and current name: the '''University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma'''.

Over the next several years, several construction projects were completed, including renovations to Gary, Austin, and Davis Halls and Nash Library.&lt;ref name="Becoming USAO"/&gt; Serious construction continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s, culminating in the opening of a newly remodeled $2.2 million Student Center in 1998. Sparks Hall, the traditional dormitory on campus, was also greatly renovated.

In 2000, Dr. John Feaver became the university's twelfth president. In 2001, the National Park Service approved the listing of the entire campus as a [[National Register of Historic Places|National Historic District]], the only educational institution in the state to hold such an honor.&lt;ref name="Becoming USAO"/&gt; Historic markers throughout the campus document describe the various historic buildings. New housing options were made available in the early 2000s in the form of the $13.1 million Lawson Court Apartment Complex. Owens Flag Plaza, a centerpiece for the campus 'oval', was opened in 2004. Since 2005, USAO, with the support of the State Regents for Higher Education, has embarked on a Mission Enhancement Plan intended to emphasize the University's unique role as the public liberal arts college in Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usao.edu/news/usao-presents-ambitious-mission-enhancement-plan "USAO Presents Ambitious Mission Enhancement Plan,"] ''University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma'', May 31, 2005.

An '''urban refugee''' is a [[refugee]] who decided or was obliged to settle in an [[urban area]] rather than in a [[refugee camp]] in the country or territory where the person fled to. More than 60% of the world's refugee population and 80% of [[internally displaced person]]s (IDP) under [[UNHCR]] mandate live in urban environments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unhcr.org/urban-refugees.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, their number was around 5.5 million people. "Urban refugee" is not a recognized legal term in the [[Convention relating to the Status of Refugees|1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees]]. However, the UNHCR has adopted a 'Policy on Refugee Protection and Solutions in Urban Areas' in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.refworld.org/docid/4ab8e7f72.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban refugees are among the most vulnerable groups in low income countries. According to UNHCR, the urban refugee population worldwide is very diverse, comprising a large number of women, children, and older people who have particular protection challenges. The urban refugee population face specific protecting needs attendant to urban environments: they may lack access to services, health, education and are often confronted to xenophobic attitudes in their country of asylum.

The overwhelming majority of refugees living in urban areas are to be found in the poorest and more conflict-affected regions of the world. Africa and Asia concentrate the highest number of urban refugee populations. Some war-affected countries host a huge number of both urban internally displaced people and refugees in capital cities (such as [[Kampala]] or [[Khartoum]]). Urban refugees also live in the main cities of their country of origin: after protracted exile, many returnees prefer settling back as IDPs in cities and towns of their own country upon return.

Since around 2017, the UNHCR prioritizes urban refugees for [[third country resettlement|resettlement]] over those refugees living in [[refugee camps]]. In Kenya, for example, only refugees living in Nairobi are submitted for resettlement places, and not those refugees living in [[Kakuma]] or [[Dadaab]].

==Reasons for living in urban areas==
Reasons for living in urban settings rather than in refugee camps could be specific medical care needs that can't be provided for in camps, or higher than average educational achievements and aspirations, as camps don't provide much higher education opportunities. There is insufficient physical and material security in some camps. Especially certain groups of refugees, such as [[LGBTI]] refugees and women at high risk of gender-based violence, cannot be sufficienty protected from other refugees in the camps.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/resettlement.pdf|{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} page 35&lt;/ref&gt; Or it could simply the fact that the state or territory where refugees fled to does not run refugee camps (e.g. Syria or Egypt). Some refugees leave camps in search of better economic opportunities in urban centres and to avoid being dependent on aid rations. Some even move back and forth between urban centres and refugee camps to get the best of both.

A disadvantage is that the UNHCR and other aid agencies cannot legally protect and support refugees dispersed in urban settings as much as in camps.

==Notable urban refugee settlements==
* [[Damascus]], Syria: the majority of a total of around 63,000 Iraqi refugees in Syria&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/iraqi-refugees-in-syria-feel-new-strains-of-war/2013/04/09/4f5cd784-9ee8-11e2-a941-a19bce7af755_story.html&lt;/ref&gt; (also see [[Iraqis in Syria]]). 
* [[Cairo]], Egypt: around 30,000 Sudanese refugees&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fmreview.org/FMRpdfs/FMR27/50.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (also see [[sudanese refugees in Egypt]]).&lt;!-- as of 2015, Kenyan government requires refugees to reside in camps --&gt;
* [[Cape Town]], South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/j/prm/funding/fy2015/240479.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kathmandu]], Nepal: 500 Rohingya and Sri Lankan refugees as well as [[Ahmadiyyas]] from Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/11/bleak-outlook-nepal-urban-refugees-151123110438884.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Beirut]], Lebanon: 26,000 
* [[Kandahar]] and [[Kabul]], Afghanistan: 55,000 each
* [[Belgrade]], Serbia: 57,542 
* [[Amman]], Jordan:  162,061 
* [[Bangui]], Central African Republic: 496,731
* [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia: 62,200

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17429">'''Vogel's Tonnetz''' is a graphical and mathematical representation of the scale range of [[just intonation]], introduced by German music theorist [[Martin Vogel]] 1976 in his book ''Die Lehre von den Tonbeziehungen'' (english: On the Relations of Tone, 1993). 
The graphical representation is based on [[Tonnetz|Euler's Tonnetz]], adding a third dimension for just [[Harmonic seventh|sevenths]] to the two dimensions for just [[Perfect fifth|fifths]] and just [[Major third|thirds]]. 
It serves to illustrate and analyze chords and their relations.
The four-dimensional mathematical representation including octaves allows the Evaluation of the [[#Consonance and the congruency of harmonics|congruency of harmonics]] of chords depending on the tonal material. 
It can thus also serve to determine the optimal tonal material for a certain chord.

The graphical representation of Vogel's Tonnetz is limited to the three dimensions for fifths, thirds, and seventh. In this representation tones separated by one or several octaves are depicted on the same nodes. The illustration shows the chord which is the most frequent 4-note chord in western music: the major seventh. In Euler's Tonnetz the B-flat is constructed from fifths and thirds. In Vogel's Tonnetz it is given as a just harmonic seventh.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The representation of this chord in Vogel's three-dimensional Tonnetz makes its statistical dominance much more plausible than its representation in Euler's two-dimensional Tonnetz: There is a distinct reference note (C), and all other notes are linked to this reference note via simple one-step intervals in this Tonnetz.

== The mathematical representation ==

The mathematical representation of Vogel's Tonnetz is four-dimensional, considering also [[octave]]s.
Each tone is represented by a [[4-tuple|quadruple]] of numbers specifying how many octaves, "fifths", "thirds", and "seventh" are needed to reach that tone in the Tonnetz (where the terms "fifths", "thirds", and "seventh" denote the prime numbers 3, 5, and 7, instead of the intervals 3/2, 5/4 und 7/4).
The C-major seventh chord with the notes c', e', g', and b-flat' could (with reference to C)be represented by the numbers 4, 5, 6, and 7.
This corresponds to the quadruple (2,0,0,0), (0,0,1,0), (1,1,0,0), and (0,0,0,1).
The quadruple notations represents the [[prime decomposition]] of the numbers that are needed to describe the chord, limited to the first four prime numbers.

Vogel adopts the harmonic dualism of [[Arthur von Oettingen]], with [[major chord|major]] and [[minor chord|minor]] chords being mirror images of each other. This view is complemented by a quantitative computation of [[consonance]] (or rather [[consonance and dissonance|dissonance]]) values.

[[File:Chords with reference notes.jpg|thumb|C major and C minor chord with upper and lower reference tone]]

For this purpose Vogel introduces virtual reference tones that are not necessarily part of the chord. These reference tones are chosen such that all chord tones have integer relations to these reference tones. For each chord there exists a lower and an upper reference tone, with all chord tones being integer multiples of the frequency of the lower reference tone and integer fractions of the frequency of the upper reference tone. In quadruple notation there are only positive (or zero) values if the chord is related to the lower reference tone, and only negative (or zero) values if the chord is related to the higher reference tone.

To get a single numerical value describing the complexity of a chord, Vogel builds a weighted sum of the quadruples describing the notes of the chord. He suggests the weights 1, 3, 5, and 7 for the prime numbers 2, 3, 5, and 7. Vogel rejects the more obvious variant where prime number 2 is weighted with 2 because it leads to results that in his opinion do not comply with the perception of musically skilled listeners. Finally, the weighted sum is divided by the number of tones of the chord. This computation is done for both the higher and the lower reference tone. Depending on which of those two values is smaller, the chord is then labeled as "Oberklang" or "Unterklang" ("upper chord", if reference to the lower reference note, or "lower chord", if referenced to the upper reference note).

The C major chord c’-e’-g’ could, for instance, be referenced to C.
All three notes of the triad can be represented as integer multiples of the frequency of this reference tone (4, 5, and 6). 
The prime decomposition yields 2&amp;#x00B7;2,5,2&amp;#x00B7;3. 
Applying the weights suggested by Vogel one obtains a so-called consonance value of (1+1+5+1+3)/3 = 11/3 = 3.67. 
The same chord may also be referenced to b’’’’: this upper reference tone has 15 times the frequency of c’, 12 times the frequency of e’ and ten times the frequency of g’. 
The prime decomposition yields3&amp;#x00B7;5,2&amp;#x00B7;2&amp;#x00B7;3,2&amp;#x00B7;5.
The consonance value computes to (3+5+1+1+3+1+5)/3 = 19/3 = 6,33. 
As the consonance value for the lower reference tone is better (smaller), the c major chord c’-e’-g’ is defined to be an upper chord referenced to C.
The consonance value of the c minor chord c’-es’-g’ is identical.
It is, however, reference to the upper reference tone of this chord, g’’’.
In consequence, Vogel rejects the naming of this chord as C minor as its reference note is not C but G. He calls it "G lower chord".

Vogel suggests a specific notation for upper and lower chords.
The notation starts by denoting the reference tone in lower case.
Upper chords are marked by an "O" (Oberklang) and are denoted from left to right, lower chords are marked by a "U" (Unterklang) and are denoted from right to left.
The C major chord is denoted as cO, the C minor chord is denoted as Ug.
Additional symbols for additional notes (7 for adding an upper or lower seventh) are added to the left or to the right, depending on whether it is an upper or a lower chord. 
The C&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; chord depicted above would be denoted as cO7.

In addition to the calculation of consonance values for single chords, 
Vogel suggests a computation of the consonance of chord transitions.
When transiting from an n-note chord to an m-note chord all N&amp;#x00B7;M note-to-note transitions are evaluated via prime decomposition and weighted sum, and a mean value for all these transitions is computed.
Vogel also suggest to compute a consonance value for an entire piece of music, taking into account a central reference point similar to a [[Gregorian mode|final]].

=== Consonance and the congruency of harmonics ===

The consonance value calculated with Vogel's formula should rather be termed dissonance value, because with increasing dissonance of a chord or interval its value increases.
Vogel did not claim to predict consonance judgments of today's listeners.
A close relation of Vogel's consonance values with consonance judgments is in deed not to be expected.
Firstly, consonance judgments correlate strongly with familiarity judgments.&lt;ref name="Karas"&gt;Agnieszka Karas, Christian Kaernbach: ''Putting Martin Vogel to test: An attempt to evaluate a musical theory.'' In U. Ansorge et al. (Hrsg.): ''Beiträge zur [https://www.teap.de/docs/teap2013_final_programme_updated.pdf 55. Tagung experimentell arbeitender Psychologen.]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (PDF; 11,3&amp;nbsp;MB)'' Pabst Science Publishers, Lengerich, 2013, S. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;
Secondly, major and minor are attributed emotional values by today's Western listeners (minor being perceived as expressing sadness).
Thirdly, his formula considers only the congruency of harmonics, but not the congruency of [[combination tone]]s.
It would be more cautious to say that Vogel's formula correlates with the congruency of harmonics, expressing in how far the harmonics of a chord fit together or not.

The range of the validity of the formula is in addition limited by the limits of hearing.
A just octave cannot be discriminated from an octave that is mistuned by a [[schisma]] (a mistuning of about 2 [[cent (music)|cent]]). The perceptual limit for the frequency difference of complex tones is about 0.25 % (4 cent).&lt;ref name="Kaernbach"&gt;Christian Kaernbach, Christian Bering: ''Exploring the temporal mechanism involved in the pitch of unresolved harmonics.'' In: ''Journal of the Acoustical Society of America.'' Vol. 110, 2001, S. 1039-1048 ([http://www.emotion.uni-kiel.de/fileadmin/emotion/team/kaernbach/publications/2001_kae_ber_jasa.pdf PDF]).&lt;/ref&gt;
Vogel's consonance formula yields a consonance value of (1&amp;#x00B7;1+0&amp;#x00B7;3+0&amp;#x00B7;5+0&amp;#x00B7;7)/2 = 0.5 for the just octave (1,0,0,0), and a values of (14&amp;#x00B7;1+8&amp;#x00B7;3+1&amp;#x00B7;5+0&amp;#x00B7;7)/2 = 43/2 = 21.5 for the octave mistuned by a schisma (-14,8,1,0).

=== Consequences for the selection of tones ===
[[File:C minor chord with high and low third.jpg|thumb|C minor chord with high and low third [[File:C minor chord with third high and low.ogg|noicon|40px]]]]

Vogel's consonance formula can help to decide, which tones of the Tonnetz should be taken for a certain chord. The consonance value of the seventh chord in Euler's Tonnetz (see figure above) is 8.5. In Vogel's Tonnetz one could select the same tones, resulting in the same consonance value. If one, however, decides to select the just seventh, the consonance value improves to 4.5. Hence, according to Vogel, the seventh chord using a just seventh is to be preferred over a seventh chord where the seventh is built from fifth and thirds.

=== Compositional consequences ===

Vogel claims that his formula entails also compositional consequences.
If one wants a chord to be consonant, major chords should be composed such that thirds and sevenths are set in a high register.
Minor chords, however, would have to be set the other way round, with thirds and sevenths being set in a low register.
This is by no means compatible with the compositional practice of the last centuries (with perhaps the exception of the Tristan chord, see below).
In consequence, minor chords set along Vogel's composition rules sound unfamiliar.
They exhibit, however, a better congruency of harmonics than their classical variants.
The left-hand of the two C minor chords in the adjoining figure is composed in the classical way, with the third being set in a high register. The consonance value for this chord is 4.33.
The right-hand minor chord features a low third. It sounds unfamiliar. Its consonance value is, however, much lower (3.0), and the congruency of its harmonics is much better.

== Limiting the theory to the prime numbers 2, 3, 5 and 7 ==

Vogel considers the theoretically infinite four-dimensional space of tones of his Tonnetz as complete; no further dimensions are needed for higher prime numbers.
According to his theory, consonance results from the congruency of [[harmonics]]. The prime number 11 and any other higher prime number can not lead to any perception of congruency, as the [[inner ear]] separates only the first eight to ten partials.&lt;ref name="Kaernbach"/&gt; The eleventh partial may be audible and discriminable from the tenth or twelfth partial if isolated via techniques such as [[Harmonic#Harmonics_on_stringed_instruments|flageolet]]. If presented as part of a complex tone comprising also the adjoining partials these partials would fuse together, and a congruency with the partial of another note could no longer be detected. It might be interesting to test whether it is possible to detect harmonic congruency for higher prime numbers for instruments with odd partials, as the distances between partials are higher in these instruments. With training it might be possible to detect consonance up to prime number 17 or even 19.

== The half-diminished seventh chord in Vogel's Tonnetz ==

[[File:Tristanvorspiel.jpg|thumb|400px|Beginning of the Prelude of Richard Wagner's opera Tristan and Isolde, with the Tristan chord (yellow) and its resolution (blue) [[File:Wagner Tristan opening (orchestral).ogg|noicon|40px]] ]]
[[File:Tristan chord in Vogel's Tonnetz.gif|framed|The Tristan chord(yellow) and its resolution (blue) in Vogel's Tonnetz, animated]]

The [[Tristan chord]] is a historically important chord in [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera ''Tristan and Isolde''. Its role in [[Diatonic function|functional harmony]] cannot clearly be determined. It is considered to be tonally unsettled and extremely chromatic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Kurth (Musikwissenschaftler)|Ernst Kurth:]] ''Romantische Harmonik und ihre Krise in Wagners „Tristan“'', Bern 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Vogel's Tonnetz this chord appears to be the dual counterpiece of a major seventh chord. This interpretation is strengthened by the observation that this G-sharp minor chord with an added lower seventh (E-sharp or F is a seventh below the reference of this G-sharp minor chord, the D-sharp) resolves in a E major chord with an added upper seventh (see also the adjoining animated figure). In addition, Wagner's way to set this chord is compatible with this view, with the third (B) and the seventh (F or E-sharp) set in a low register. In Vogel's notation one would note this chord as 7Ud{{music|#}}, as the reference note of the G-sharp minor chord is the D-sharp.

It is not very likely that Vogel's notation for minor chords will win recognition. It would require that a C minor chord is denoted as Ug, as lower chord under g. A compromise notation could be to denote the Tristan chord as G{{music|#}}m/F, i.e., as a G-sharp minor chord with an F in the bass.

The "explanation" of the Tristan chord in Vogel's Tonnetz as a well-composed counter-piece of a major seventh chord cannot be compared to an "explanation" in the scope of functional harmony. Both types of explanations cannot really explain why certain chords and chord sequences have established themselves in musical history. Functional harmony focuses on the relation of a chord to the prevailing tonality. In consequence, it cannot explain chord progressions found in late-romantic music where there is no longer a continuous tonality present. In contrast, Vogel's theory focuses more on the congruency of the notes of a single chord, or with the notes of the preceding or subsequent chord than on the role of this chord in the context of a prevailing tonality. Vogel's analysis reveals that the Tristan chord is by no means an attack on the tonal system as such but that it is part of it exactly as its counterpart, the major seventh chord.

A similar chord is also often used by jazz musicians.
There it is commonly notated as a half-diminished seventh chord.
The Tristan chord could hence be noted as Fm&lt;sup&gt;7 b5&lt;/sup&gt;).
This way to describe this chord misses its relation to a G-sharp minor chord.
It results from the practice to describe chords starting from their lowest note.
According to Vogel this is appropriate for upper chords, but not for lower chords.
Lower chords should be described top-down instead of bottom-up.
The principle of starting with the lowest note is not consequently observed in other situations, such as with [[Inverted chord|inverted chords]].
A C major chord in its [[first inversion]] is not typically described as an E minor chord with altered fifth (Em&lt;sup&gt;+5&lt;/sup&gt;).

&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Reception ==

Vogel's Tonnetz resorts on a theory (Euler's Tonnetz) that is more than 100 years older than the presently dominating functional harmony.
Vogel's Tonnetz and functional harmony are not in conflict with each other.
On the contrary, they can be seen as complementing each other:
While Vogel's theory focuses on local relations of tones and chords, 
functional harmony considers the global role of a chord in the context of the entire piece of music.
However, the prevalence of functional harmony and the peculiarities of Vogel's notation hamper the general reception.
Vogel's consonance formula has only recently been tested empirically.&lt;ref name="Karas" /&gt; 
Kaernbach suggests a simplified notation:
writing always from left to right, using capital letters for the reference tones (avoiding confusions with the convention to use lowercase letters for minor chords), and using a triangular symbol (&amp;#9650; und &amp;#9660;) to denote upper and lower chords. 
The beginning of the prelude of Tristan and Isolde could then be denoted as 
D&amp;#9660;{{music|#}}7 → E&amp;#9650;7.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Kaernbach: ''Honoring Martin Vogel – Champion of just intonation in music.'' In U. Ansorge et al.
