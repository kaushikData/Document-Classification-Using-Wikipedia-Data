==History==

Slicer started as a masters [[thesis]] project between the Surgical Planning Laboratory at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hirayasu | first1 = Y | last2 = Shenton | first2 = ME | last3 = Salisbury | first3 = DF | last4 = Dickey | first4 = CC | last5 = Fischer | first5 = IA | last6 = Mazzoni | first6 = P | last7 = Kisler | first7 = T | last8 = Arakaki | first8 = H | last9 = Kwon | first9 = JS | last10 = Anderson | first10 = JE | last11 = Yurgelun-Todd | first11 = D | last12 = Tohen | first12 = M | last13 = McCarley | first13 = RW | title = Lower left temporal lobe MRI volumes in patients with first-episode schizophrenia compared with psychotic patients with first-episode affective disorder and normal subjects | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 155 | issue = 10 | pages = 1384–91 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9766770 | doi = 10.1176/ajp.155.10.1384 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 3D Slicer version 2 has been downloaded several thousand times. In 2007 a completely revamped version 3 of Slicer was released. The next major refactoring of Slicer was initiated in 2009, which aims to transition the [[GUI]] of Slicer from using KWWidgets to [[Qt (framework)|Qt]]. Qt-enabled Slicer version 4 has been released in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fedorov|last2=Beichel|last3=Kalpathy-Cramer|last4=Finet|last5=Fillion-Robin|last6=Pujol|last7=Bauer|last8=Jennings|last9=Fennessy|last10=Sonka|last11=Buatti|last12=Aylward|last13=Miller|last14=Pieper|last15=Kikinis|title=3D Slicer as an image computing platform for the Quantitative Imaging Network|journal=Magnetic Resonance Imaging|volume=30|issue=9|pages=1323–41|year=2012|pmid=22770690|doi=10.1016/j.mri.2012.05.001|pmc=3466397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slicer software has enabled a variety of research [[Academic publishing|publications]], all aimed at improving image analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Pieper S., Lorensen B., Schroeder W., Kikinis R. The NA&amp;#45;MIC Kit: ITK, VTK, Pipelines, Grids and 3D Slicer as an Open Platform for the Medical Image Computing Community. Proceedings of the 3rd IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro 2006; 1:698&amp;ndash;701.&lt;/ref&gt;

This significant software project has been enabled by the participation of several large-scale [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] funded efforts, including the NA-MIC, NAC, [[Biomedical Informatics Research Network|BIRN]], CIMIT, Harvard Catalyst and NCIGT communities. The funding support comes from several federal funding sources, including [[National Center for Research Resources|NCRR]], [[National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering|NIBIB]], NIH Roadmap, [[National Cancer Institute|NCI]], [[National Science Foundation|NSF]] and the [[United States Department of Defense|DOD]].

==Users==

Slicer's platform provides functionalities for segmentation, registration and [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] visualization of [[multimodal distribution|multimodal]] image data, as well as advanced image analysis [[algorithms]] for [[diffusion tensor]] imaging, functional [[magnetic resonance imaging]] and [[image-guided radiation therapy]]. Standard [[image file formats]] are supported, and the application integrates interface capabilities to biomedical research software.

Slicer has been used in a variety of [[clinical research]]. In image-guided therapy research, Slicer is frequently used to construct and visualize collections of MRI data that are available pre- and intra-operatively to allow for the acquiring of spatial [[Coordinate system|coordinates]] for instrument tracking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hata | first1 = N | last2 = Piper | first2 = S | last3 = Jolesz | first3 = FA | last4 = Tempany | first4 = CM | last5 = Black | first5 = PM | last6 = Morikawa | first6 = S | last7 = Iseki | first7 = H | last8 = Hashizume | first8 = M | last9 = Kikinis | first9 = R  | title = Application of open source image guided therapy software in MR-guided therapies | journal = Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ... International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention | volume = 10 | issue = Pt 1 | pages = 491–8 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18051095 | doi=10.1007/978-3-540-75757-3_60}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Slicer has already played such a pivotal role in image-guided therapy, it can be considered as growing up alongside that field, with over 200 publications referencing Slicer since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;For a list of publications citing Slicer usage since 1998, visit: http://www.slicer.org/publications/pages/display/?collectionid=11&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to producing 3D models from conventional MRI images, Slicer has also been used to present information derived from fMRI (using MRI to assess blood flow in the brain related to [[Nervous system|neural]] or [[spinal cord]] activity),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Archip | first1 = N | last2 = Clatz | first2 = O | last3 = Whalen | first3 = S | last4 = Kacher | first4 = D | last5 = Fedorov | first5 = A | last6 = Kot | first6 = A | last7 = Chrisochoides | first7 = N | last8 = Jolesz | first8 = F | last9 = Golby | first9 = A | last10 = Black | first10 = PM | last11 = Warfield | first11 = SK | title = Non-rigid alignment of pre-operative MRI, fMRI, and DT-MRI with intra-operative MRI for enhanced visualization and navigation in image-guided neurosurgery | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 609–24 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17289403 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.11.060 | pmc=3358788}}&lt;/ref&gt; DTI (using MRI to measure the restricted diffusion of water in imaged tissue),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ziyan | first1 = U | last2 = Tuch | first2 = D | last3 = Westin | first3 = CF | title = Segmentation of thalamic nuclei from DTI using spectral clustering | journal = Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ... International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention | volume = 9 | issue = Pt 2 | pages = 807–14 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17354847 | doi=10.1007/11866763_99}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[electrocardiography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Verhey | first1 = JF | last2 = Nathan | first2 = NS | last3 = Rienhoff | first3 = O | last4 = Kikinis | first4 = R | last5 = Rakebrandt | first5 = F | last6 = D'ambra | first6 = MN | title = Finite-element-method (FEM) model generation of time-resolved 3D echocardiographic geometry data for mitral-valve volumetry | journal = BioMedical Engineering OnLine | volume = 5 | pages = 17 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16512925 | pmc = 1421418 | doi = 10.1186/1475-925X-5-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Slicer's DTI package allows the conversion and analysis of DTI images. The results of such analysis can be integrated with the results from analysis of [[Morphology (biology)|morphologic]] MRI, MR [[Angiography|angiograms]] and fMRI. Other uses of Slicer include [[paleontology]]&lt;ref&gt;http://openpaleo.blogspot.com/2009/03/3d-slicer-tutorial-part-vi.html&lt;/ref&gt; and neurosurgery planning.&lt;ref&gt;http://picasaweb.google.com/107065747472066371420&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developers==

The Slicer Developer Orientation offers resources for developers new to the platform. Slicer development is coordinated on the slicer-devel mailing list, and a summary of development statistics is available on Ohloh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stef2cnrs.wordpress.com/category/marching-cubes/|title=marching cubes {{!}} biomedical optics|website=stef2cnrs.wordpress.com|language=fr-FR|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3D Slicer is built on [[VTK]], a pipeline-based graphical library that is widely used in scientific visualization and [[Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit|ITK]], a framework widely used for the development of [[Segmentation (image processing)|image segmentation]] and [[image registration]]. In version 4, the core application is implemented in [[C++]], and the API is available through a [[Python (programming language)|Python]] wrapper to facilitate rapid, iterative development and visualization in the included Python console. The user interface is implemented in Qt, and may be extended using either C++ or Python.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Detection and Quantification of Small Changes in MRI Volumes|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slicer supports several types of modular development. Fully interactive, custom interfaces may be written in C++ or Python. Command-line programs in any language may be wrapped using a light-weight [[XML]] specification, from which a graphical interface is automatically generated.

For modules that are not distributed in the Slicer core application, a system is available to automatically build and distribute for selective download from within Slicer. This mechanism facilitates the incorporation of code with different license requirements from the permissive BSD-style license used for the Slicer core.

The Slicer build process utilizes [[CMake]] to automatically build prerequisite and optional libraries (excluding Qt). The core development cycle incorporates automatic testing, as well as incremental and nightly builds on all platforms, monitored using an online dashboard.

[[File:Aestivation.png|thumb|A diagram showing some kinds of petal or sepal aestivation in flower buds. A: quincuncial; B: twisted ,C: cochleate; D: contorted; E: valvate; F: open.]]
'''Aestivation''' or '''estivation''' refers to the positional arrangement of the parts of a flower within a flower bud before it has opened. Aestivation is also sometimes referred to as '''praefoliation''' or '''prefoliation''', but these terms may also mean [[vernation]]: the arrangement of leaves within a vegetative bud.

Aestivation can be an important taxonomic diagnostic; for example [[Malvaceae]] flower buds have valvate sepals, with the exception of the genera ''[[Fremontodendron]]'' and ''[[Chiranthodendron]]'', which have sometimes been misplaced as a result.

The terms used to describe aestivation are the same as those used to describe leaf vernation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author =Hickey, M.|author2 =King, C. |year=2001 |title= The Cambridge Illustrated Glossary of Botanical Terms|publisher=Cambridge University Press,|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Classes of aestivation include:
* ''imbricate'' – overlapping
** ''contorted'' or ''twisted'' – every petal or sepal is outside its neighbour on one margin, and inside its neighbour on the other margin
*** ''cochleate'' – spirally twisted
*** ''contortiplicate'' – contorted and also [[Glossary of botanical terms#P|plicate]]
** ''quincuncial'' – with five parts, where two petals or sepals are outside all others, two are inside all others, and the fifth is outside on one margin and inside on the other
* ''crumpled''
* ''[[Glossary of botanical terms#D|decussate]]''
* ''induplicate'' – folded inwards
* ''open'' – petals or sepals do not overlap or even touch each other 
* ''reduplicate'' – folded outwards
* ''valvate'' – margins of adjacent petals or sepals touch each other without overlapping.

'''Vexillary aestivation''' is a special type of aestivation occurring in plants like pea. In this type of aestivation a large petal called '''''standard'''''  encloses two smaller petals called &lt;gallery&gt;

[[SRI International]]'s '''Augmentation Research Center''' ('''ARC''') was founded in the 1960s by electrical engineer [[Douglas Engelbart]] to develop and experiment with new tools and techniques for collaboration and [[information processing]].

The main product to come out of ARC was the revolutionary oN-Line System, better known by its abbreviation, [[NLS (computer system)|NLS]]. ARC is also known for the invention of the "[[Mouse (computing)|computer mouse]]" pointing device, and its role in the early formation of the [[Internet]].

Engelbart recruited workers and ran the organization until the late 1970s when the project was commercialized and sold to [[Tymshare]], which was eventually purchased by [[McDonnell Douglas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enolagaia.com/UMUArchive/Engelbart.html|title=Historical Background to CSCW and Groupware: Engelbart's Vision of IT-Driven Organizational Integration|first=Randall|last=Whitaker|publisher=Enola Gaia|accessdate=2012-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginnings==
Some early ideas by [[Douglas Engelbart]] were developed in 1959 funded by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (now [[Rome Laboratory]]).&lt;ref name="work86"&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Augmented Knowledge Workshop |date= June 1986 |work= Proceedings of the ACM Conference on The history of personal workstations |publisher= ACM |pages= |location= Palo Alto, California |author= Douglas C. Englebart |isbn= 0-89791-176-8 |doi= 10.1145/12178.12184 |url= http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-101931.html |accessdate= April 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1962, a framework document was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework |author= Douglas C. Engelbart |date= October 1962 |work= SRI Summary Report AFOSR-3223; SRI Project No. 3578 |url= http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html |accessdate= April 20, 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110504035147/http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html |archivedate= 2011-05-04 |deadurl= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. C. R. Licklider]], the first director of the [[United States Department of Defense]]'s [[DARPA|Advanced Research Project Agency]] (DARPA) [[Information Processing Techniques Office]] (IPTO), funded the project in  early 1963. First experiments were done trying to connect a display at SRI to the massive one-of-a-kind [[AN/FSQ-32]] computer at the [[System Development Corporation]] in [[Santa Monica, California]].&lt;ref name="work86"/&gt;

==NASA funding==
[[NASA]] began to provide major funding at the behest of [[Robert Taylor (computer scientist)|Robert Taylor]] in 1964. A custom graphical workstation was built around a commercial computer, the [[CDC 160A]], and a [[CDC 3000|CDC 3100]], which handled a single user at a time. In 1965, Taylor became IPTO director, leading to increased funding. In 1968 an [[SDS 940]] computer running the [[Berkeley Timesharing System]] allowed multiple users.

The project was first called ARNAS after the sponsors. For a few years it was then called the Augmented Human Intellect Research Center, which got shortened to the Augmentation Research Center around 1969.&lt;ref name="sul"&gt;{{cite web |title= Douglas Engelbart |work= Stanford and the Silicon Valley Oral History Interviews |publisher= [[Stanford University]] |author= Interview conducted by Judy Adams and Henry Low |date= December 19, 1986 – April 1, 1987 |url= http://www-sul.stanford.edu/depts/hasrg/histsci/ssvoral/engelbart/start1.html |accessdate= April 19, 2011 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110420212855/http://www-sul.stanford.edu/depts/hasrg/histsci/ssvoral/engelbart/start1.html| archivedate= 20 April 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Mother of All Demos==
During a 90-minute session at the [[Fall Joint Computer Conference]] in December 1968, Engelbart, [[Bill English (computer engineer)|
Bill English]], [[Jeff Rulifson]] and other ARC staffers presented their work in a live demonstration, including real-time video conferencing and interactive editing in an era when [[batch processing]] was still the paradigm for using computers. This was later called "[[the Mother of All Demos]]".

==Reference library service==
Engelbart had volunteered ARC to provide the first reference library service on the [[ARPANET]] while it was being designed. The first message sent on ARPANET was between the ARC computer and [[UCLA]]. [[Lawrence Roberts (scientist)|Larry Roberts]] continued to fund the ARC through DARPA IPTO until he left in 1974. The library service evolved into the [[Internic|Internet Network Information Center]] managed by [[Elizabeth J. Feinler]]. [[Bertram Raphael]] was put in charge of the project in 1976.

==Sale to Tymshare==
The technology was sold to [[Tymshare]] in 1977, with 20 members of the former SRI group (including Engelbart) becoming Tymshare employees.&lt;ref name="sul"/&gt; Only about three or four people were left to continue the NIC, although this group grew quickly along with the [[Internet]]. [[Jon Postel]] left in 1977 to join the [[Information Sciences Institute]].&lt;ref name="oral"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oral History of Elizabeth (Jake) Feinler |author=Interviewed by Marc Weber |date=September 10, 2009 |work=Reference no: X5378.2009 |publisher=[[Computer History Museum]] |url=http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/Oral_History/102702199.05.01.acc.pdf |accessdate=April 20, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811175249/http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/Oral_History/102702199.05.01.acc.pdf |archivedate=August 11, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of early participants moved on to careers at [[Xerox]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Apple Computer]], [[Sun Microsystems]], and other leading computer companies.

Tymshare renamed the software ''Augment'' and offered it as a commercial service via its new Office Automation Division. At Tymshare, Engelbart soon found himself marginalized and relegated to obscurity. Operational concerns at Tymshare overrode Engelbart's desire to do further research. Various executives, first at Tymshare and later at [[McDonnell Douglas]], which acquired Tymshare in 1984, expressed interest in his ideas, but never committed the funds or the people to further develop them. His interest inside of McDonnell Douglas was focused on the enormous knowledge management and IT requirements involved in the life cycle of an aerospace program, which served to strengthen Engelbart's resolve to motivate the information technology arena toward global interoperability and an open hyperdocument system.&lt;ref&gt;http://dougengelbart.org/about/ohs.html&lt;/ref&gt; Engelbart retired from McDonnell Douglas in 1986, determined to pursue his work free from commercial pressure.

==Books about ARC==
The complex story of the rise and fall of ARC has been documented in a book by sociologist [[Thierry Bardini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Bootstrapping: Douglas Engelbart, Coevolution, and the Origins of Personal Computing |author= [[Thierry Bardini]] |year=2000 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=0-8047-3723-1 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CEc1OOGmA5IC }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counter-culture revolution]], [[John Markoff]], in his book ''[[What the Dormouse Said]]'', also follows Englebart's persistence in creating ARC as not only a collection of talented off-beat engineers working in direct contrast to the [[Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]] nearby, but also as a sociological experiment that constructed and tested methods for group creation and design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= What the Dormouse Said |author= [[John Markoff]] |publisher= Penguin |year= 2006 |isbn= 978-0-14-303676-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ARC was also indirectly covered in many other books about [[PARC (company)|Xerox PARC]], since that is where many ARC employees later fled to (and brought some of Engelbart's ideas with them). Taylor had founded the Computer Systems Laboratory at PARC in 1970.

'''Austreskorve Glacier''' ({{coord|71|50|S|5|40|E|type:glacier_region:AQ_source:GNIS|display=inline,title}}) is a broad [[glacier]] in the [[Mühlig-Hofmann Mountains]] which drains north from a position just east of the head of [[Vestreskorve Glacier]] and passes along the east side of [[Breplogen Mountain]]. It was mapped and named from surveys and from air photos by the [[Sixth Norwegian Antarctic Expedition]] (1956&amp;ndash;60).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2565">'''Autoinoculation''' is derived from the Latin root words "autos" and "inoculate" that mean "self implanting" or "self infection" or "implanting something from oneself".&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/auto#Etymology&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inoculate#Etymology&lt;/ref&gt; '''Autoinoculation''' can refer to both beneficial medical procedures (e.g. [[vaccination]]) as well as non-beneficial or harmful natural processes (e.g. [[infection]] or [[disease]]). One beneficial '''autoinoculation''' medical procedure is when [[cell (biology)|cell]]s are removed from a person's body, medically altered then reinserted ("implanted" or "infected") into the same organism or person again to achieve some diagnostic or treatment aim.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002218.htm US National Library of Medicine]. URL last accessed August 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[stem cell treatments]] involve the harvesting of stem cells from one's own bone marrow and reintroduction ('''autoinoculation''') of those cells at a later date, sometimes after altering those [[stem cells]]. Autoinoculation may also be used for the transplantation of a patient's own healthy bone marrow after recovering from a condition afflicting the tissue. '''Autoinoculation''' can also refer to the process by which viruses reproduce themselves within an organism by implanting themselves in an organism's [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, altering the metabolism, DNA repair, and replication processes of those cells, using those processes to reproduce and transmit itself throughout the organism. For example, [[warts]] and [[Molluscum contagiosum]] can be spread by this method if wart tissue cells (skin cells altered by a [[papillomavirus]]) are mechanically transported to another part of the body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aafp.org/afp/20030315/1233.html American Family Physician]&lt;/ref&gt; This transmission or '''autoinoculation''' of the wart can occur by mechanical touching of one part of the organism to another, friction that removes a portion of the infected cells to an external surface (or another organism) and then reintroduces those cells upon contact with the body elsewhere, or when wart cells or tissue are transported though the blood stream of an organism.

A '''buried rupture earthquake''', or '''blind earthquake''' (c.f., [[surface rupture earthquake]]) is an [[earthquake]] with non-visible offset of the ground surface when an [[earthquake rupture]] along a [[Fault (geology)|fault]] does not affect the Earth's surface. See also [[blind thrust earthquake]], a close concept.

The net quantity of electric charge, the amount of [[positive charge]] minus the amount of [[negative charge]] in the universe, is always ''[[Conserved quantity|conserved]]''.   This does not mean that individual positive and negative charges cannot be created or destroyed.  Electric charge is carried by [[subatomic particle]]s such as [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s. [[Charged particle|Charged particles]] can be created and destroyed in elementary particle reactions. In reactions that create charged particles, equal numbers of positive and negative particles are always created, keeping the net amount of charge unchanged. Similarly, when particles are destroyed, equal numbers of positive and negative charges are destroyed. This property—supported without exception by all empirical observations so far&lt;ref name="PurcellMorin" /&gt;—is described as charge conservation.

Charge conservation, considered as a [[conservation law (physics)|physical conservation law]], implies that the change in the amount of electric charge in any volume of space is exactly equal to the amount of charge flowing into the volume minus the amount of charge flowing out of the volume.  In essence, charge conservation is an accounting relationship between the amount of charge in a region and the flow of charge into and out of that region, given by a [[continuity equation]] between [[charge density]] &lt;math&gt;\rho(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; and [[current density]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;.

Although conservation of charge requires that the total quantity of charge in the universe is constant, it leaves open the question of what that quantity is.  Most evidence indicates that the net charge in the universe is zero&lt;ref&gt;

Charge conservation was first proposed by British scientist [[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]] in 1746 and American statesman and scientist [[Benjamin Franklin]] in 1747, although the first convincing proof was given by [[Michael Faraday]] in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Formal statement of the law==
{{see also|Continuity equation}}

Mathematically, we can state the law of charge conservation as a [[continuity equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial Q}{\partial t} = \dot Q_{\rm{IN}}(t)  - \dot Q_{\rm{OUT}}(t). &lt;/math&gt;
 
where &lt;math&gt;\partial Q/\partial t&lt;/math&gt; is the electric charge accumulation rate in a specific volume at time {{mvar|t}}, &lt;math&gt;\dot Q_{\rm{IN}}&lt;/math&gt; is the amount of charge flowing into the volume and &lt;math&gt;\dot Q_{\rm{OUT}}&lt;/math&gt; is the amount of charge flowing out of the volume; both amounts are regarded as generic functions of time. 

The integrated continuity equation between two time values reads:

:&lt;math&gt;Q(t_2) = Q(t_1) + \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\left(\dot Q_{\rm{IN}}(t) - \dot Q_{\rm{OUT}}(t)\right)\,\mathrm{d}t.&lt;/math&gt;

The general solution is obtained by fixing the initial condition time &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt;, leading to the [[integral equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;Q(t) = Q(t_0) + \int_{t_0}^{t}\left(\dot Q_{\rm{IN}}(\tau) - \dot Q_{\rm{OUT}}(\tau)\right)\,\mathrm{d}\tau.&lt;/math&gt;

The condition &lt;math&gt;Q(t)=Q(t_0)\;\forall t&gt;t_0,&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the absence of charge quantity change in the control volume: the system has reached a [[steady state]]. From the above condition, the following must hold true:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{t_0}^{t}\left(\dot Q_{\rm{IN}}(\tau) 
- \dot Q_{\rm{OUT}}(\tau)\right)\,\mathrm{d}\tau = 0\;\;\forall t&gt;t_0\;\implies\;\dot Q_{\rm{IN}}(t) 
= \dot Q_{\rm{OUT}}(t)\;\;\forall t&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt;

therefore, &lt;math&gt;\dot Q_{\rm{IN}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\dot Q_{\rm{OUT}}&lt;/math&gt; are equal (not necessarily constant) over time, then the overall charge inside the control volume does not change. This deduction could be derived directly from the continuity equation, since at steady state &lt;math&gt;\partial Q/\partial t=0&lt;/math&gt; holds, and implies &lt;math&gt;\dot Q_{\rm{IN}}(t) = \dot Q_{\rm{OUT}}(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[classical electromagnetism|electromagnetic field theory]], [[vector calculus]] can be used to express the law in terms of [[charge density]] {{mvar|ρ}} (in [[coulomb]]s per cubic meter) and electric [[current density]] {{math|'''J'''}} (in [[amperes]] per square meter). This is called the charge density continuity equation

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \rho} {\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The term on the left is the rate of change of the [[charge density]] {{mvar|ρ}} at a point. The term on the right is the [[divergence]] of the current density {{math|'''J'''}} at the same point. The equation equates these two factors, which says that the only way for the charge density at a point to change is for a current of charge to flow into or out of the point. This statement is equivalent to a conservation of [[four-current]].

===Mathematical derivation===
The net current '''into''' a volume is
:&lt;math&gt;I=- \iint\limits_S\mathbf{J}\cdot d\mathbf{S}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|1=''S'' = ∂''V''}} is the boundary of {{mvar|V}} oriented by outward-pointing [[Surface normal|normals]], and {{math|''d'''''S'''}} is shorthand for {{math|'''N'''''dS''}}, the outward pointing normal of the boundary {{math|∂''V''}}. Here {{math|'''J'''''}} is the current density (charge per unit area per unit time) at the surface of the volume. The vector points in the direction of the current.

From the [[Divergence theorem]] this can be written
:&lt;math&gt;I=- \iiint\limits_V\left(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{J}\right)dV&lt;/math&gt;

Charge conservation requires that the net current into a volume must necessarily equal the net change in charge within the volume.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dq} {dt} =- \iiint\limits_V\left(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{J}\right)dV \qquad \qquad (1)&lt;/math&gt;
The total charge ''q'' in volume ''V'' is the integral (sum) of the charge density in ''V''
:&lt;math&gt;q = \iiint\limits_V \rho dV&lt;/math&gt;
So, by the [[Leibniz integral rule]]
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dq}{dt} = \iiint\limits_V \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} dV   \qquad \qquad \qquad \quad (2)&lt;/math&gt;
Equating (1) and (2) gives
:&lt;math&gt; 0 = \iiint\limits_V \left( \frac{\partial \rho} {\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} \right)dV.&lt;/math&gt;
Since this is true for every volume, we have in general

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \rho} {\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

==Connection to gauge invariance==
Charge conservation can also be understood as a consequence of symmetry through [[Noether's theorem]], a central result in theoretical physics that asserts that each [[conservation law]] is associated with a [[Symmetry in physics|symmetry]] of the underlying physics.  The symmetry that is associated with charge conservation is the global [[gauge invariance]] of the [[electromagnetic field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = 978-0-521-88021-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is related to the fact that the electric and magnetic fields are not changed by different choices of the value representing the zero point of [[electrostatic potential]] &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.  However the full symmetry is more complicated, and also involves the [[vector potential]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;.   The full statement of gauge invariance is that the physics of an electromagnetic field are unchanged when the scalar and vector potential are shifted by the gradient of an arbitrary [[scalar field]] &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi' = \phi - \frac {\partial \chi}{\partial t} \qquad \qquad \mathbf{A}' = \mathbf{A} + \nabla \chi.&lt;/math&gt;

In quantum mechanics the scalar field is equivalent to a [[phase shift]] in the [[wavefunction]] of the charged particle:

:&lt;math&gt;\psi' = e^{i q \chi}\psi&lt;/math&gt;

so gauge invariance is equivalent to the well known fact that changes in the phase of a wavefunction are unobservable, and only changes in the magnitude of the wavefunction result in changes to the probability function &lt;math&gt;|\psi|^2&lt;/math&gt;.  This is the ultimate theoretical origin of charge conservation.

Gauge invariance is a very important, well established property of the electromagnetic field and has many testable consequences.  The theoretical justification for charge conservation is greatly strengthened by being linked to this symmetry.  For example, [[gauge invariance]] also requires that the [[photon]] be massless, so the good experimental evidence that the photon has zero mass is also strong evidence that charge is conserved.&lt;ref&gt;

Even if gauge symmetry is exact, however, there might be apparent electric charge non-conservation if charge could leak from our normal 3-dimensional space into hidden [[superstring theory|extra dimensions]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Experimental evidence==
Simple arguments rule out some types of charge nonconservation.  For example, the magnitude of the [[elementary charge]] on positive and negative particles must be extremely close to equal, differing by no more than a factor of 10&lt;sup&gt;−21&lt;/sup&gt; for the case of protons and electrons.&lt;ref name="Patrignani"&gt;{{cite journal

If the elementary charge on the electron and proton were even slightly different, all matter would have a large electric charge and would be mutually repulsive.

The best experimental tests of electric charge conservation are searches for [[particle decay]]s that would be allowed if electric charge is not always conserved.  No such decays have ever been seen.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''citrus gummy bark viroid''' (abbreviated CGBVd) is a sub-species of the [[hop stunt viroid]], and thus is a member of the genus [[Hostuviroid]].

As the name suggests, the citrus gummy bark viroid causes problems in the bark of the [[sweet orange]] tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sofy | first1 = A.R. | last2 = Soliman | first2 = A.M. | last3 = Mousa | first3 = A.A. | last4 = Ghazal | first4 = S.A. | last5 = El-Dougdoug | first5 = K.A. | title = First record of ''Citrus viroid II'' (CVd-II) associated with gummy bark disease in sweet orange (''Citrus sinensis'') in Egypt | journal = New Disease Reports | volume = 21 | pages = 24 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.5197/j.2044-0588.2010.021.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scrapping the bark exposes localized spots or a line of reddish-brown, gum-impregnated tissue around the scion circumference especially visible near the bud union. The discoloration and gumming may extend above the bud union to the main branches of the sweet orange while in severe infection dark streaks of gum-impregnated tissue may also be observed in longitudinal sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Onelge|first=N.|last2=Cinar|first2=A.|last3=Szychowski|first3=J.A.|last4=Vidalakis|first4=G.|last5=Semancik|first5=J.S.|date=2004|title=Citrus viroid II variants associated with 'Gummy Bark' disease|url=|journal=European Journal of Plant Pathology|volume=110|issue=10|pages=1047–1052|doi=10.1007/s10658-004-0815-2|issn=0929-1873|via=ISI Web of Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2701">The '''Kabul - City Of Light Development''' is an urban reconstruction plan, first proposed  by urban planner and architect [[Hisham N. Ashkouri]] to revitalize the capital city of [[Afghanistan]].  The plan targets an area just south of the [[Kabul River]] for redevelopment.  This area, approximately 3.5km long and 1.75 km wide, still hosts residences, commercial and retail activity, despite the fact that it has been largely reduced to rubble after years of occupation and civil war, and many of the collapsed structures have become temporary shelters constructed of whatever is available, without [[building codes]] or standards.  The plan will revitalize [[Meywand Avenue]], one of the main avenues of commerce in the city and part of the historic [[Silk Route]], between the [[Shah Do Shamshera Mosque]] and the [[Id Gah Mosque]].  Retail, business, and residential areas are planned, alongside preserved and restored structures of historic value.  Also incorporated into this project is the new [[Afghan National Museum]].

==Design==
 
[[Image:KABULCITYMAP.jpg|thumb|350px|City Of Light Development]]

The design of the City Of Light is based on an "Arid Region Design Technique" that has proven itself over the past decades in cities such as [[Istanbul]], [[Baghdad]], [[Isfahan]], and [[Kabul]].  The project will rely on extensive use of concrete, in high-rise and national structures including all-exterior solar screen work. 

10% of the development's profit will be set aside for [[seed money]] to encourage refurbishment of nearby homes and businesses. 

The bases of the aesthetic designs to be used are rooted in the rich history of Afghan jewelry and rug designs. The buildings assembled in this project are most adaptable to various design themes, especially with the exterior glass skin being set within an outside screen of colored concrete in the shape of women's jewelry and rug patterns, extrapolated from culturally significant Afghan images.  Green space in the plan is also incorporated in the shape of Necklace Park, a greenway running through the development.

[[Image:Meywand1.jpg|thumb|350px|The proposed City Of Light Development]]

==Progress==
A [[Memorandum of Understanding]] has been signed with Afghan Ambassador to the United States [[Said Tayeb Jawad]] for greater development of this plan, and it was presented to President [[Hamid Karzai]] in May 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5599">The '''Clean Energy Project''' (CEP) is a virtual high-throughput discovery and design effort for the next generation of plastic solar cell materials. It studies millions of candidate structures to identify suitable compounds for the harvesting of renewable energy from the sun and for other organic electronic applications. It runs on the [[BOINC]] platform.

==Project purpose==
The project searches for the most suitable [[organic compound]]s with which to make [[solar cell]]s, the best [[polymeric membrane]]s with which to make [[fuel cell]]s, and how best to assemble the [[molecule]]s for such devices.

==Current project status==
On June 24, 2013, the Clean Energy Project released its database to the public and the research community.  The release was featured on the White House Blog&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/06/24/two-years-later-bold-new-steps-materials-genome-initiative | title=Two Years Later, Bold New Steps for the Materials Genome Initiative| date=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by several news organizations including the MIT Technology Review.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/516281/researchers-id-thousands-of-organic-materials-for-use-in-solar-cells/ | title=The Virtual Discovery of New Organic Materials for Solar Cells}}&lt;/ref&gt; The database contains 150 million [[density functional theory]] calculations on 2.3 million molecules.

'''Critical distance''' is, in [[acoustics]], the distance at which the [[sound pressure level]] of the direct sound D and the [[reverberation|reverberant]] sound R are equal when dealing with a directional source. In other words, it is the point in space at which the combined [[amplitude]] of all the reflected echoes are the same as the amplitude of the sound coming directly from the source (D = R). This distance, called the critical distance &lt;math&gt;d_c&lt;/math&gt;, is dependent on the geometry and [[Absorption (acoustics)|absorption]] of the space in which the sound waves propagate, as well as the dimensions and shape of the sound source.

{{quote|In a reverberant space, the sound perceived by a listener is a combination of direct and reverberant sound. The ratio of direct sound is dependent on the distance between the source and the listener, and upon the reverberation time in [the room]. At a certain distance the two will be equal. This is called the "critical distance."|Glenn White and Gary Louie (2005)&lt;ref&gt;White, Glenn and Louie, Gary (2005). ''The Audio Dictionary'', 3rd edition, p.89. University of Washington Press. Cited in Hodgson, Jay (2010). ''Understanding Records'', p.36. {{ISBN|978-1-4411-5607-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A reverberant room generates a short critical distance and an acoustically dead ([[Anechoic room|anechoic]]) room generates a longer critical distance.

== Calculation ==

The calculation of the critical distance for a diffuse approximation of the reverberant field:
:&lt;math&gt;d_c = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt \frac{\gamma A}{\pi} \approx 0.057 \sqrt \frac{\gamma V}{RT_{60}} ,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the degree of directivity of the source (&lt;math&gt;\gamma = 1&lt;/math&gt; for an omnidirectional source), &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; the equivalent absorption surface, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; the room volume in m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and 
&lt;math&gt;RT_{60}&lt;/math&gt; the [[reverberation time]] of room in seconds. The latter approximation is using Sabine's reverberation formula &lt;math&gt;RT_{60}=V/6A&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''Derain''' [[quadrangle (geography)|quadrangle]] (H-10) is one of [[List of quadrangles on Mercury|fifteen quadrangles on Mercury]]. It runs from 288 to 360° longitude and from -25 to 25° latitude. Named after the [[Derain (crater)|Derain]] crater, it was mapped in detail for the first time after ''[[MESSENGER]]'' entered orbit around [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] in 2011. It had not been mapped prior to that point because it was one of the six quadrangles that was not illuminated when ''[[Mariner 10]]'' made its flybys in 1974 and 1975. These six quadrangles continued to be known by their [[list of albedo features on Mercury|albedo feature]] names, with this one known as the Pieria quadrangle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Page/mercuryQuadMap| title=1:5 Million-Scale Maps of Mercury| publisher=Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature (USGS/IAU/NASA)| accessdate=2013-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-423/p21.htm| title=SP-423 Atlas of Mercury| page=21| publisher=NASA| accessdate=2013-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The massive [[Skinakas Basin]] overlaps the border of this quadrangle and neighboring [[Eminescu quadrangle]].

'''Dermo-optical perception''' ('''DOP''') — also known as '''dermal vision''', '''dermo-optics''', '''eyeless sight''', '''eyeless vision''', '''skin vision''', '''skin reading''', '''finger vision''', '''paroptic vision''', '''para-optic perception''', '''cutaneous perception''', '''digital sight''', and '''bio-introscopy'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blom|first1=Jan Dirk|title=A Dictionary of Hallucinations|date=2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=1-4419-1222-3|pages=184–185|edition=1e dr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; — is a term that is used in [[parapsychology|parapsychological]] literature to denote the alleged capability to perceive colors, differences in brightness, and/or formed images through the skin (without using the eyes, as distinct from [[blindsight]]), especially upon touching with the fingertips.

Typically, people who claim to have dermo-optical perception claim to be able to see using the skin of their fingers or hands. People who claim to have DOP often demonstrate it by reading while blindfolded. The effect has not been demonstrated scientifically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zusne|first1=Leonard|title=Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking|date=1989|publisher=L.

==History==
The first Western scientific reports are from the 17th century.&lt;ref name=brugger&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brugger P, Weiss P | year = 2008 | title = Dermo-optical perception: the nonsynaesthetic "palpability of colors" | url = | journal = Journal of the History of the Neurosciences | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 253–255 | doi=10.1080/09647040601013325}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scattered cases kept being reported over the years, but scientific interest didn't pick up until the 20th century.&lt;ref name=brugger /&gt; [[Extrasensory Perception|ESP]] researchers enthusiastically studied DOP, hoping that it was an example of extra-sensory perception, but they could only conclude that some of the results couldn't be explained by cheating.&lt;ref name=brugger /&gt;

According to [[Joe Nickell]], a noted [[Scientific skepticism|skeptic]], many circus entertainers and [[Magic (illusion)|magicians]] have utilized tricks to perform eyeless-sight feats. In the 1880s [[Washington Irving Bishop]] performed the "blindfold drive" with a horse-drawn carriage.&lt;ref name="Nickell2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nickell|first1=Joe|title=Adventures in Paranormal Investigation|date=2007|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|location=Lexington, Ky.|isbn=978-0-8131-2467-4|pages=213–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century [[Joaquín Argamasilla|Joaquín María Argamasilla]] known as the "Spaniard with X-ray Eyes" claimed to be able to read handwriting or numbers on [[dice]] through closed metal boxes. Argamasilla managed to fool [[Gustav Geley]] and [[Charles Richet]] into believing he had genuine [[psychic]] powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Polidoro|first1=Massimo|title=Final Séance: The Strange Friendship Between Houdini and Conan Doyle|date=2001|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, NY|isbn=1-57392-896-8|pages=171–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924 he was exposed by [[Harry Houdini]] as a fraud. Argamasilla peeked through his simple blindfold and lifted up the edge of the box so he could look inside it without others noticing.&lt;ref name="Nickell2007"/&gt;

A teenager from America named Pat Marquis known as "the boy with X-ray eyes" was tested by [[J. B. Rhine]] and was caught peeking through the blindfold down his nose.&lt;ref name="Nickell2007"/&gt; Science writer [[Martin Gardner]] has written that the ignorance of blindfold deception methods has been widespread in investigations into objects at remote locations from persons who claim to possess eyeless vision. Gardner documented various conjuring techniques psychics such as Rosa Kuleshova, Linda Anderson and [[Nina Kulagina]] have used to peek from their blindfolds to deceive investigators into believing they used eyeless vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Martin|title=Are Universes Thicker Than Blackberries?: Discourses on Gödel, Magic Hexagrams, Little Red Riding Hood, and Other Mathematical and Pseudoscientific Topics|date=2003|publisher=W.W. Norton|location=New York|isbn=978-0-393-05742-3|pages=225–243|edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine reported on several cases on June 12, 1964, and on April 19, 1937, calling them "X-ray wonders", but all of them were found to be cheating when tested under controlled conditions.&lt;ref name="Nickell2007"/&gt;

In 2010, an Italian lady known as R. G. who claimed she could peer inside sealed boxes with X-ray vision to describe what is inside was tested at the [[University of Pavia]] by [[Massimo Polidoro]], chemist Luigi Garlaschelli and physicist Adalberto Piazzoli. Twelve objects were selected and placed in wooden boxes. She failed the test, getting only one object correct.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Joe Nickell]] who has studied DOP has written "To date, no one has demonstrated convincingly, under suitably controlled conditions, the existence of X-ray sight or any other form of clairvoyance or ESP."&lt;ref name="Nickell2007"/&gt;

==Scientific reception==
Experiments into DOP by scientists have shown no effect.&lt;ref name=shiah /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wallace Sampson and Barry L. Beyerstein |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/china_conference_2/ |title=Traditional Medicine and Pseudoscience in China: A Report of the Second CSICOP Delegation (Part 2) - CSI |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |volume=20.5 |date=September–October 1996 |accessdate=2014-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004014428/http://www.csicop.org/si/show/china_conference_2/ |archivedate=2009-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alleged positive results haven't been accepted by the mainstream scientific community due to procedures not being tight enough to prevent cheating by participants, problems with replicating the effect reliably, and concerns about the colors being recognized by the texture of the ink on the paper (people who are blind from an early age can recognize [[Braille]] patters that only have .2 millimeters of elevation above the paper, and the limit of relief distinction in fingers is still unknown).&lt;ref name=shiah /&gt; In summary, DOP has not been demonstrated scientifically.&lt;ref name=shiah /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benski, Claudio. (1998). ''Testing New Claims of Dermo-Optical Perception''. Skeptical Inquirer 22: 21-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of DOP positive results have been explained as cheating by participants, either via the use of magicians' tricks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randi.org/encyclopedia/dermo-optical%20perception.html |title=James Randi Educational Foundation — An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural |publisher=[[James Randi Educational Foundation]] |date= |accessdate=2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; or via "peeking down the nose" (cheating by participants)&lt;ref name=shiah /&gt;&lt;ref name=brugger /&gt;&lt;ref name=brugger /&gt;&lt;ref name="gov1"&gt;{{cite journal|title= A possible account of synaesthesia dating from the seventeenth century|date=2014-05-14 |pmid=16887762 | doi=10.1080/09647040500388661 |volume=15 |journal=J Hist Neurosci |pages=245–9 |author=Larner AJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, DOP has been the object of mainstream research that had no links with ESP.&lt;ref name=brugger /&gt;&lt;ref name="gov1"/&gt;

Apart from trickery, there are several hypotheses about how fingers could "see" radiation emitted by the colors in the paper, but none have been tested successfully.&lt;ref name=shiah /&gt; For example, people can hold their fingers near to painted and non-painted surfaces, and distinguish them by how much corporal heat is radiated back to their fingers.&lt;ref name=brugger /&gt; While it has not been verified if fingers can be sensitive enough to detect heat radiation from different inks in paper, it is theorized that blind people could plausibly do it.&lt;ref name=brugger /&gt;&lt;ref name="gov1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1519">A '''differential refractometer''' ('''DRI'''), or '''refractive index detector''' ('''RI''' or '''RID''') is a detector that measures the [[refractive index]] of an [[analyte]] relative to the [[solvent]].  They are often used as detectors for [[high-performance liquid chromatography]] and [[size exclusion chromatography]].  They are considered to be universal detectors because they can detect anything with a refractive index different from the solvent, but they have low sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;Undergraduate Instrumental Methods of Analysis.  James W. Robinson, Eileen M. Skelly Frame, George M. Frame II.  Marcel Dekker, 2005, p. 810.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles of operation==

When light leaves one material and enters another it bends, or refracts.  The [[refractive index]] of a material is a measure of how much light bends when it enters.  Differential refractometers contain a flow cell with two parts: one for the sample and one for the reference solvent.  The detector measures the refractive index of both components.  When only solvent is passing through the sample component the measured refractive index of both components is the same, but when an analyte passes through the flow cell the two measured refractive index are different. The difference appears as a peak in the chromatogram.

==Applications==

Differential refractometers are often used for the analysis of [[polymer]] samples in size exclusion chromatography.

U.S. Geological Survey ''Water-Supply Paper ''1541-B''''&lt;/ref&gt; is a commonly used [[data analysis]] approach for investigating the behaviour of records made of [[hydrology|hydrological]] or [[meteorology|meteorological]] data at a number of locations. It is used to determine whether there is a need for corrections to the data - to account for changes in data collection procedures or other local conditions. Such changes may result from a variety of things including changes in [[instrumentation]], changes in observation procedures, or changes in gauge location or surrounding conditions. Double mass analysis for checking consistency of a [[hydrological]] or [[meteorological]] record is considered to be an essential tool before taking it for analysis purpose. This method is based on the hypothesis that each item of the recorded data of a population is consistent.

An example of a double mass analysis is a "double mass plot", or "double mass curve".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, E.M. (1983) Engineering Hydrology, 3rd edition. Macmillan Press, London. p.27&lt;/ref&gt; For this, points and/or a joining line are plotted where the x- and y- coordinates are determined by the running totals of the values observed at two stations. If both stations are affected to the same extent by the same trends then a double mass curve should follow a straight line. A break in the slope of the curve would indicate that conditions have changed at one location but not at another.
This [[Scientific technique|technique]] is based on the principle that when each recorded data comes from the same [[parent population]], they are consistent.

'''Dwarfism in chickens''' is an inherited condition found in [[chicken]]s consisting of a significant delayed growth, resulting in adult individuals with a distinctive small size in comparison with normal specimens of the same breed or population.
 
The affected birds show no signs of dwarfism in the first weeks of age.&lt;ref name="hutt"&gt;Hutt, F.B. ''Genetics of the fowl''. McGraw-Hill Book Co. N.Y. 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in size due to dwarfism appear slow and progressively along the growing stage. Poultry breeders begin to distinguish gradually dwarfs from normal birds by their shortest shanks and smallest body size.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, C.F. and Jaap, R.G. 1974 Chick size and early growth rate of dwarf broiler-type chickens. ''Poultry Science'' Vol. 53:1982-1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leenstra, F.R. and Pit, R. 1984 The autosomal dwarf as broiler sire mated to normal and sex-linked dwarf broiler dams:Performance of progeny. XVII World's Poultry Congress and Exhibition (August 8–12) Finland.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the breed, most types of dwarfism in chickens begin to be recognized when the birds reach 8–10 weeks of age,&lt;ref name="hutt2"&gt;Hutt, F.B 1959 Sex-linked dwarfism in the fowl. ''Journal of Heredity'' 50:209-221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Cole, R.K. 1973 An autosomal dwarfism in the fowl. Poultry Science vol.52:2012-2013&lt;/ref&gt; but classification is more precise when the chickens are five months old or more. At this point differences between normal and dwarf sibs is evident in all males and in 98% of the females.&lt;ref name="hutt" /&gt; Dwarfs chickens reach sexual maturity and reproduce normally.

Dwarfism in chickens has been found to be controlled by several simple genetic factors. Some types are [[Autosome|autosomic]] while others are [[Sex linkage|sex-linked]], but when poultry breeders make reference to 'dwarf chickens' they  usually refer implicitly to sex-linked recessive dwarfism due to the recessive gene dw, located on the [[ZW sex-determination system|Z chromosome]].
 
As sex-linked dwarf [[broiler]] breeder hens can bring about normal sized broiler chickens, sex-linked recessive dwarfism found application in poultry industry since the last decades of the 20th century.

These hens require less food and less housing space. Their feed intake do not need to be restricted. They also have more tolerance to heat (see: [[#Advantages of broiler breeder hens|Advantages...]]). So the use of sex-linked dwarf broiler female parent stocks helps to save costs and to improve animal welfare and economic efficiency in European broiler industry (see: [[#Use of sex-linked dwarfism in poultry industry|Use of...]]). But in spite of the proven advantages of raising dwarf breeder hens, their use is not generalized in broiler industry.

==Autosomal types of dwarfism==

Two different types of autosomal dwarfisms have been found in chickens. These types of dwarfism are controlled by genes located on the autosomal chromosomes so inherits the same way in both sexes.

===Thyrogenous dwarfism, ''td''===

In 1929 a type of dwarfism was described in different breeds of [[Rhode Island Red]] chickens.&lt;ref&gt;Landauer, W. 1929 Thyrogenous dwarfism (myxoedema infantilis) in the domestic fowl. ''Am. J . Anat.'' 43, 1-43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayhew, R. L. and Upp, C. W. 1932 Inherited (?) dwarfism in the fowl. ''J. Hered.'' 23, 269-276.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Upp, C. W. 1932 Notes on a form of dwarfism encountered in Rhode Island Red fowls. ''Poult. Sci.'' 11, 370-371.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Upp, C. W. 1934 Further data on the inheritance of dwarfism in fowls. ''Poult. Sci.'' 13, 157-165.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of dwarfism produced individuals which showed a general growth delay, which was recognizable since two or three weeks of age. The outer toe was curved backwards. The skull was high and wide in relation to its length and the upper beak was curved downwards. Tongue was shortened and tumescent. Legs shortened, more in the matatarsal than in the femur. The condition was semi-lethal. None of the affected birds reached sexual maturity. It was considered as the result of a dysfunction of the thyroid gland, similar to the human pathological condition known as ''myxoedema infantilis''. Dwarfs of this type were homozygotes for an autosomal recessive gene ''td'' (thyrogenous dwarfism).

===Autosomal dwarfism, ''adw''===

Another body size mutation was found in the experimental Cornell K-strain of chickens. Body size was reduced by about 30% and the affected birds were recognizable by 6 to 8 weeks of age. Their sexual maturity was somewhat delayed and rate of lay was about 90% that of the K-strain. Viability of the carriers was good but hatchability was poor. The condition was due to an autosomal recessive gene designed ''adw''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The ultimate goal of the modern genetic studies is to find out the underlying genes involved in these traits. To achieve this, the so-called positional candidate gene approach is gaining in importance. This approach is based on the genetic localization of a trait using genetic linkage analysis. Subsequent comparative mapping of the trait locus with the gene-rich maps of the human and the mouse may reveal candidate genes for the trait in question. Comparative mapping revealed that autosomal dwarfism in the chicken (''adw'') is located in a chromosomal region that is conserved between chicken, human and mouse. In the mouse the phenotype "Pygmy", similar to chicken ''adw'' is also located in that region. The Pygmy mouse phenotype arises from the inactivation of the High Mobility Group I-C (''HMGCI-C''). In the human the ''HMGCI-C'' gene is also located in the same conserved chromosomal segment.  Fluorescent in situ hybridization of chicken metaphase chromosomes using the chicken ''HMGI-C'' gene as a probe, showed that the chicken ''HMGI-C'' gene is indeed located in the region of the ''adw'' locus.&lt;ref&gt;Ruyter-Spira, C.P. 1998 Analysis of the chicken genome : mapping of monogenic traits (PhD thesis)''Wageningen UR Library Catalogue''.  Record #956960&lt;/ref&gt; Insulin-like growth factor 1 (''IGF1'') is another candidate for ''adw'' in the chicken.&lt;ref&gt;Ruyter-Spira, C.P.

==Sex-linked dwarfism==

In birds, female is the [[heterogametic sex]], that is, it has one ''Z'' and one ''W'' sexual chromosome (genotype ZW), while male (the homogametic sex) carries two ''Z'' chromosomes ([[ZW sex-determination system|genotype ZZ]]). Thus, [[reciprocal cross]]es between normal and dwarf specimens may give rather different results.

===Sex-linked recessive dwarfism, ''dw''===

Hutt studied in the 1940s a remarkable type of dwarfism caused by only one sex-linked recessive gene to which he assigned the symbol ''dw''.&lt;ref name="hutt" /&gt;

This mutation reduces body weight in females by 26 to 32%, but the effect is still greater in homozygous males, by about 42-43%. Chicks are normal size.&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume, J. 1976 The Dwarfing Gene dw: Its Effects on Anatomy, Physiology, Nutrition, Management. Its Application in Poultry Industry ''World's Poultry Sci. J.'' 32,285-304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="somes"&gt;Somes, R. G. ''International Registry of Poultry Genetic Stocks. A Directory of Specialized Lines and Strains, Mutations, Breeds and Varieties of Chickens, Japanese Quail and Turkeys''. Storrs Agricultural Experiment Station, The University of Connecticut, Storrs, Bulletin #460, (1981).&lt;/ref&gt; This is the best studied type of dwarfism in chickens. Sex-linked dwarfism in meat type breeds are first recognized by the shortening of the shanks than by the lowering body weight in the rearing period&lt;ref&gt;Pampín, M. ''et al'' 1988 Comparison of dwarf and normal White Plymouth Rock birds in the growing stage (original in Spanish) ''Revista Cubana de Ciencia Avícola'' Vol.15:31-37&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no signs of sex-linked dwarfism in the first weeks of age. Some individuals can be identified as dwarfs at 8–10 weeks of age, but classification is more precise when the chickens are five months old or more. At this point differences between normal and dwarf sibs is evident in all males and in 98% of the females.&lt;ref name="hutt" /&gt; These dwarfs reach sexual maturity and reproduce normally.

Normal females are always of genotype ''Dw/-'', while dwarf females are always of genotype ''dw/-'', because female is the [[heterogametic sex]] having only one ''Z'' chromosome. That is, females carrying a sex-linked gene of dwarfism are always pure and exhibit the trait. On the other hand, normal males may be either homozygous ''Dw/Dw'' or heterozygous ''Dw/dw'', but dwarf males are always homozygous ''dw/dw''.

Double dose of dwarf gene causes the dwarfism to be much more evident in males than in females. The above picture illustrates the comparative size of two full-sib roosters born the same day: Left: Normal sibling of genotype ''Dw/dw''. Right: Dwarf sibling of genotype ''dw/dw''.

====Hormonal causes of dwarfism====

Among the main factors involved in growth regulation, [[thyroid hormone]]s tiroxine (T4) [[triiodothyronine]] (T3), growth hormone (GH), and its related growth factor, Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), were the most studied in dwarfs.&lt;ref&gt;Scanes, C.G. 2009 Perspectives on the endocrinology of poultry growth and metabolism. ''General and Comparative Endocrinology'' Vol. 163, Issues 1–2, 1 September 2009, pp. 24–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex-linked dwarf chickens are characterized by low circulating levels of T3 and IGF-I in spite of normal or even increased levels of T4 and GH. The T3 deficiency is explained by a lower peripheral activity of T4 monodeiodination which could be related to an abnormal T4 uptake by the cell, particularly the hepatocyte. The low production of IGF-I could be related to a deficient GH receptor, as suggested by the decreased GH binding observed in the liver of dwarf birds. Both T3 and IGF-I synthesis may share common pathways since thyroidectomy also decreases IGF-I level while a GH injection stimulates the T4 to T3 monodeiodination in the normal embryo but not in the dwarf. Further studies are needed on the GH receptor and the T4 uptake in the hepatic cell to identify the common point where the dwarf gene could act. Ovulation rate and lipomobilisation are decreased in adult dwarfs but these findings are not yet easily related to the endocrinological changes observed during growth&lt;ref&gt;Tixier-Boichard, M. ''et al''. 1989 Physiological studies on the sex-linked dwarfism of the fowl: a review on the search for the gene’s primary effect. (Review article) ''Genet. Sel. Evol.'' Vol.21:217-234.&lt;/ref&gt;

Administration of triiodothyronine (T3) in the diet, from day of hatch until 8 weeks of age, to sex-linked dwarf chickens stimulates growth but can not fully restore a normal growth rate.&lt;ref&gt;Leung, F.C. ''et al''. 1984 Effects of Dietary Thyroid Hormones on Growth and Serum T3, T4, and Growth Hormone in Sex-Linked Dwarf Chickens.  ''Exp Biol Med'' vol. 177(1):77-81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tixier-Boichard, M. ''et al''. 1990 Effects of dietary T3 on growth parameters and hormone levels in normal and sex-linked dwarf chickens. ''Domestic Animal Endocrinology'' Vol. 7, Issue 4, pp. 573–585&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex-linked dwarfism in chickens is a form of growth hormone resistance that resembles the [[Laron syndrome]] in humans, characterized by reductions in stature and plasma insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels.&lt;ref&gt;Huang, N. ''et al''. 1993 Overexpression of a truncated growth hormone receptor in the sex-linked dwarf chicken: evidence for a splice mutation. ''Molecular Endocrinology'' vol. 7(11):1391-1398&lt;/ref&gt;

Variants in chicken growth hormone receptor (GHR) gene lead to sex-linked dwarf chickens, but effects of different variants are distinct.&lt;ref&gt;Ouyang, Jian-hua ''et al''. 2012 The Effects of Different Sex-Linked Dwarf Variations on Chinese Native Chickens ''Journal of Integrative Agriculture'' Vol. 11(9):1500–1508&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bantam dwarfism, ''dw''&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;===

Bantam dwarfism is a variety of dwarfism existing in many breeds of [[Bantam (poultry)|bantam]] chickens . Bantam chickens are also called miniatures. These birds are popular as pets, but Bantam hens are also renowned for hatching and [[Broodiness|brooding]] because they are very protective mothers  and will attack anything that gets near their young.

The reciprocal crosses made between normal sized chickens with Bantams revealed that Bantams carry one or several sex-linked dominant genes that reduce body size.&lt;ref&gt;Jull, M.A. and Quinn, J.P. 1931 The inheritance of body weight in the domestic fowl&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maw, A.J.G. 1935 The inheritance of skeletal dimensions in the domestic fowl. ''Sci. Agr.'' 16, 85-112.&lt;/ref&gt; This mutation is present in [[Sebright (chicken)|Sebright Bantams]] and probably other bantams. This mutation is thought to be an allele at the ''Dw'' locus and to be different from the allele ''dw''.&lt;ref&gt;Custodio, R.W.S. and Jaap, R.G. 1973 Sex-linked reduction of body size in Golden Sebright Bantams. ''Poultry Science'' 52:204-210.&lt;/ref&gt;

In genetics, the common convention is that most dominant alleles are written as capital letters and recessive alleles as lower-case letters (see: [[Dominance (genetics)]]). In spite of this, literature refers to the gene of Bantam dwarfism with the lower-case symbol ''dw''&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;.

===MacDonald dwarfism, ''dw''&lt;sup&gt;M&lt;/sup&gt;===

A second type of sex-linked recessive dwarfism was found in a sex-linked dwarf chicken population. This mutation is thought to be an allele or the ''Dw'' locus and to be different from the ''dw'' allele. This conclusion is based on the fact that males heterozygous for ''dw''&lt;sup&gt;M&lt;/sup&gt;/''dw'' produce female offspring which fall into two populations with respect to shank length.&lt;ref&gt;Hsu, P.L., Buckland, R.B. and Hawes, R.O. 1975 A new dwarf isolate in the chicken: a possible new allele at the dw locus ''Poultry Science'' 54:1315-1319.&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence is inconclusive as to whether this allele is different or the same as the ''dw''&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; allele.

Up to the present level of knowledge the [[Dominance (genetics)|dominance]] order of the alleles of locus ''Dw'' is: ''dw''&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; ''Dw'' &gt; ''dw''.

In other words, allele ''dw''&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; for Bantam dwarfism is  [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] over the normal allele ''Dw'', and the last is dominant over the sex-linked recessive allele ''dw''. The existence of a second recessive allele has not yet been confirmed.

==Use of sex-linked dwarfism in poultry industry==

Sex-linked recessive dwarfism found application in poultry industry in the last decades of the 20th century. The application in broiler production is based on the known fact that dwarf female parents give 100% normal progeny when they are mated with normal male parents. The resulting progeny males are 100% heterozigotes ''Dw''/''dw'' and the females are hemizygotes ''Dw''/-.

In commercial broiler chicken production the use of dwarf female parents acquired a great importance.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, C.C. ''et al''. 1987 Reproductive performance of dwarf broileer breeders giving different food during the rearing and breeding periods and two lighting patterns. ''British Poultry Science'' Vol. 2:415-427&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, the majority of broiler breeders in Europe are the standard, fast growing genotype, but 18-20% of the broiler breeders are dwarf parental females that produce standard and alternative (medium or slow growing) broilers.&lt;ref&gt;de Jong, Ingrid C. and  Swalander, M. 2011 Housing and management of broiler breeders and turkey breeders. ''Proceedings of the 30th Poultry Science Symposium, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland, 2011.'' {{ISBN|978-1-84593-824-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of dwarfism also found application in commercial egg production. Dwarf Leghorn layers need less housing space, so the main advantage is to allow a more efficient use of housing space producing more eggs per unit of surface, but the smallest size of their eggs imposes a serious drawback to this purpose.

===Advantages of broiler breeder hens===

Under current practice, normal parent poultry breeding stock potentially face welfare problems. Intensive selection for production traits, especially growth rate, is associated with increased nutritious requirement and thus feed consumption, but also reproductive dysfunctions and decreased sexual activity in broiler breeders. A first resulting serious welfare problem is the subsequent severe feed restriction which is applied during rearing, in order to prevent health problems and to reach better egg production. This severe feed restriction has negative effects on bird welfare as it causes chronic stress resulting from hunger.&lt;ref name="deJong"&gt;de Jong, Ingrid. C. and Guémené, D. Welfare issues in broiler breeders. ''Poultry Welfare Symposium'' (Main lecture) Cervia, Italy, 18–22 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The use of normal fast growing broiler breeder hens require dedicated programmes of feed restriction, both to maximise egg and chick production and secondly to avoid metabolic disorders and mortality in broiler breeders. The negative correlation between muscle growth and reproduction effectiveness is known as the "broiler breeder paradox".&lt;ref name="decuypere"&gt;Decuypere, E. ''et al''. 2010 The Broiler Breeder Paradox: ethical, genetic and physiological perspectives, and suggestions for solutions. ''British Poultry Science'' Vol. 51(5):569-579&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meijerhof, Dr. Ron (11 Oct 2011). "Broiler breeders: Managing the paradox between reproduction and growth". WorldPoultry.net. Retrieved June 25, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Using dwarf broiler breeder hens is a good alternative, because dwarf hens combine relatively good reproductive fitness with ''ad libitum'' feeding.&lt;ref name="decuypere" /&gt;

With respect to bird welfare the use of slow growing birds is a viable alternative to reduce the negative effects of feed restriction. Dwarf broiler breeders do not need to be (severely) feed restricted.&lt;ref name="deJong" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, M.S. and R Layton, R. 2012 Breeding for better welfare: genetic goals for broiler chickens and their parents. ''Animal Welfare'' Vol. 21:147-155, {{ISSN|0962-7286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fritz Karl Preikschat''' (September 11, 1910 – September 2, 1994) was a German, later American, electrical and telecommunications engineer and inventor.&lt;ref&gt;http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19940907&amp;slug=1929242&lt;/ref&gt; He had more than three German patents and more than 23 U.S. patents, including a [[dot matrix teletypewriter]] (Germany, 1957), a blind-landing system for airports (1965), a phased array system for satellite communications (1971), a hybrid car system (1982), and a scanning laser diode microscope for particle analysis (1989).

== Early career in Germany ==
In 1934, he graduated from Hindenburg Polytechnic in [[Oldenburg, Germany]] with a degree in "Elektrotechnik" (electrical engineering). He then served in a minesweeper unit of [[Kriegsmarine]] (German Navy).

From 1940–1945 (during WW2), he worked as an engineer at {{Interlanguage link multi|GEMA (radar)|de|3=GEMA (Radar)|lt=GEMA}}, mostly in the radar group (see [[Radar in World War II]]). At the end of WW2, his family fled to [[Dresden]] and survived (except for one relative) the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II]]. His family then resettled as refugees in the Bavarian town of [[Amberg]].&lt;ref name="Preikschat_1989"&gt;{{citation |title=Remembering |author-first=Fritz Karl |author-last=Preikschat |author-link=Fritz Karl Preikschat |date=1989}} (Source of timeline)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributor to the Soviet Union's rocket and satellite programs (1946–1952) ==
In 1946, he was one of the more than two thousand German specialists forcibly (at gunpoint) brought to the Soviet Union under [[Operation Osoaviakhim]]. He was then one of the more than 170 German specialists – headed by [[Helmut Gröttrup]] -  brought to Branch 1 of NII-88 on [[Gorodomlya Island]] in [[Lake Seliger]]. From 1946–1952, he was an engineer and head of the high frequency lab, working on electronic instruments for the early Soviet rocket program.  He also worked on a design for a 6-dish (array) deep-space tracking station for the early [[Soviet space program]]. In 1960, the Soviet Union implemented the full 8-dish (with 52-foot diameter dishes) deep-space tracking station called [[Pluton (complex)|Pluton]] in the [[Crimea]].&lt;ref&gt;http://russianspaceweb.com/kik_nip16.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Debriefing by U.S. Air Force (1952–1954) ==
In June 1952, he was released from the Soviet Union and returned to [[East Germany]]. The [[Berlin Wall]] had not yet been constructed, so he was able to cross the border via the [[Berlin U-Bahn]] from East Berlin, East Germany, to West Berlin (Western Zone). He quickly met an American MP, who put him in a [[safe house]] where he spent two months getting debriefed by the [[U.S. Air Force]] on the Soviet Union's rocket program. He was also interviewed over several months by [[Reinhard Gehlen]]. Later, he published a 114-page report (in German; he finalized the report in April 1954) for the U.S. Air Force on the Soviet Union's "Microwave-based Control System for Long-Distance Rockets". In September 1952, he was flown by the U.S. Air Force from West Berlin (Western Zone) to Frankfurt, West Germany, where he was reunited with his family (his wife, daughter and son), finally ending a difficult, six-year separation.&lt;ref name="Preikschat_1989"/&gt;

== Dot matrix teletypewriter (Germany, 1957) ==
In 1952–1954, he filed five patent applications for a [[dot matrix teletypewriter]] (aka "teletype writer 7 stylus 35 dot matrix"), later granted in 1957 (see German patent #1,006,007&lt;ref name="DE1006007"&gt;{{cite patent |country=DE |number=1006007 |status=patent |title=Umschalteinrichtung für Fernschreiber, bei dem die Schriftzeichen in Rasterpunkte zerlegt sind |gdate=1957-09-12 |fdate=1952-07-29 |pridate=1952-07-29 |inventor=Preikschat, Fritz Karl &lt;!-- |inventor-link=Fritz Karl Preikschat --&gt; |assignee=[[Telefonbau und Normalzeit G.m.b.H.]] |class=H04L21/00 |url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/German_patent_1006007%2C_granted_1957.pdf |access-date=2016-10-31 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031114403/https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/German_patent_1006007%2C_granted_1957.pdf |archive-date=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DE1006007B"&gt;{{cite patent |country=DE |number=1006007B&lt;!-- DE1952P0015749 --&gt; |status=application |title=Umschalteinrichtung fuer Fernschreiber, bei dem die Schriftzeichen in Rasterpunkte zerlegt sind |pubdate=1957-04-11 |fdate=1952-07-29 |pridate=1952-07-29 |inventor=Preikschat, Fritz Karl &lt;!-- |inventor-link=Fritz Karl Preikschat --&gt; |assignee=Preikschat, Fritz Karl |class=H04L21/00 |url=https://encrypted.google.com/patents/DE1006007B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TuN_1957"/&gt;).

== Emigration to America (1957) ==
On June 28, 1957, he emigrated to the United States via [[Operation Paperclip]], sponsored by a [[U.S. Air Force]] contract with [[General Mills]]. The contract was cancelled shortly afterwards, so he hired on as principal scientist at the Johns Hopkins [[Applied Physics Laboratory]], where he worked on satellite transponder communications. He became a U.S. citizen in 1962.

From 1959–1970, he mostly worked as lead engineer in the Space Division of [[Boeing]] (near Seattle). He also had a stint in the Military Products Group at [[Honeywell]] (in Seattle).&lt;ref name="Preikschat_1989"/&gt;

== Boeing: Blind-landing system for airports (1965) ==
In 1965, while at [[Boeing]], he invented a [[blind-landing]] system for airports.&lt;ref&gt;https://patents.google.com/patent/US3164827A/en&lt;/ref&gt; It was an automated blind-landing system and featured a 3D-display showing the virtual landing strip overlaid on the actual visual display. The system was not implemented.

== Boeing: Phased array system for satellites (1971) ==
In 1971, while lead engineer in the telecommunications group of the space division of [[Boeing]] in [[Kent, Washington]], he, along with Orral Ritchey and John Nitardy, invented a phased array system for satellite communications.&lt;ref&gt;https://patents.google.com/patent/US3611381A/en&lt;/ref&gt; The patent was assigned to Boeing and a technical paper was written.&lt;ref&gt;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4103568/&lt;/ref&gt; The invention won Boeing's Technical Paper Award for 1970.

== F.P. Research Lab: new moisture meter (1972–1979) ==
In 1968–1974 (several patents granted), he invented a new [[moisture meter]] for [[pulp mill|pulp]] and [[paper mill]]s.&lt;ref&gt;https://patents.google.com/patent/US3391337A/en&lt;/ref&gt; He co-founded F.P. Research Lab to commercialize the moisture meter. In 1979, F.P. Research Lab was acquired by BTG AB (Sweden), a technology company serving the global pulp and paper industry.

== Hybrid car system (1982) ==
In 1982, he invented an [[electric propulsion]] and [[braking system]] for cars.&lt;ref name="patents.google.com"&gt;https://patents.google.com/patent/US4363999A/en&lt;/ref&gt; The system allows for significant improvement of [[fuel efficiency]] by recycling energy from the car's braking system ([[regenerative braking]]). While clearly not the only patent relating to the [[hybrid electric vehicle]], the patent was important based on more than 120 subsequent patents directly citing it.&lt;ref name="patents.google.com"/&gt;  The system was only patented in the U.S. and not prototyped or commercialized. In 1997, with the introduction of the [[Prius]] in Japan, [[Toyota]] was one of the first companies to commercialize a hybrid electric vehicle (i.e. using regenerative braking technology). In July 2000 - the same month the patent expired - Toyota introduced the Prius globally (see Toyota press releases). The Prius became America's best selling hybrid electric car.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.toyota.com/prius/awards/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lasentec: Particle-size analyzer (1987–1994) ==
In 1989, he, with son Ekhard Preikschat, invented a scanning [[laser diode]] microscope for particle-size analysis.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/patents/US4871251&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/patents/US5012118?dq=5,012,118&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjvw9ry-8bPAhVTz2MKHT7UDEsQ6AEIHjAA&lt;/ref&gt; He and Ekhard Preikschat co-founded Lasentec to commercialize it. In 2001, Lasentec was acquired by [[Mettler Toledo]] (NYSE: MTD).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mt.com/us/en/home/products/L1_AutochemProducts/FBRM-PVM-Particle-System-Characterization.html&lt;/ref&gt; About ten thousand systems have been installed globally - over $1 Billion in cumulative sales - mostly in the pharmaceutical industry to provide [[in-situ]] control of the [[crystallization process]] in large [[List of purification methods in chemistry|purification]] systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2105">'''Fuzzy electronics''' is an [[electronics|electronic]] technology that uses [[fuzzy logic]], instead of the two-state [[Boolean logic]] more commonly used in [[digital electronics]]. Fuzzy electronics is fuzzy logic implemented on dedicated hardware.  This is to be compared with fuzzy logic implemented in software running on a conventional processor. Fuzzy electronics has a wide range of applications, including [[control system]]s and [[artificial intelligence]].

==History==
The first fuzzy electronic circuit was built by Takeshi Yamakawa ''et al.'' in 1980 using discrete bipolar transistors.  The first industrial fuzzy application was in a cement kiln in Denmark in 1982.  The first [[VLSI]] fuzzy electronics was by Masaki Togai and Hiroyuki Watanabe in 1984.  In 1987, Yamakawa built the first analog fuzzy controller.  The first digital fuzzy processors came in 1988 by Togai (Russo, pp. 2-6).

'''Fuzzy subalgebras''' theory is a chapter of [[fuzzy set theory]]. It is obtained from an interpretation in a multi-valued logic of axioms usually expressing the notion of [[subalgebra]] of a given [[algebraic structure]].

== Definition ==

Consider a first order language for algebraic structures with a [[Unary operator|monadic predicate]] symbol S. Then a ''fuzzy subalgebra'' is a [[fuzzy model]] of a theory containing, for any ''n''-ary operation h, the axioms

&lt;math&gt;\forall x_1, ..., \forall x_n (S(x_1) \land ..... \land S(x_n) \rightarrow S(h(x_1, ..., x_n))&lt;/math&gt;

and, for any constant c, S(c).

The first axiom expresses the closure of S with respect to the operation h, and the second expresses the fact that c is an element in S. As an example, assume that the [[valuation structure]] is defined in [0,1] and denote by &lt;math&gt;\odot&lt;/math&gt; the operation in [0,1] used to interpret the conjunction. Then a fuzzy subalgebra of an algebraic structure whose domain is D is defined by a fuzzy subset {{nobreak|s : D → [0,1]}} of D such that, for every d&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,d&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; in D, if '''h''' is the [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of the n-ary operation symbol h, then

* &lt;math&gt;s(d_1) \odot... \odot s(d_n) \leq s(\mathbf{h}(d_1,...,d_n))&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, if '''c''' is the interpretation of a constant c such that s('''c''') = 1.

A largely studied class of fuzzy subalgebras is the one in which the operation &lt;math&gt;\odot&lt;/math&gt; coincides with the minimum. In such a case it is immediate to prove the following proposition.

'''Proposition.''' A fuzzy subset s of an algebraic structure defines a fuzzy subalgebra if and only if for every λ in [0,1], the [[closed cut]] {x ∈ D : s(x)≥ λ} of s is a subalgebra.

== Fuzzy subgroups and submonoids ==

The fuzzy subgroups and the fuzzy submonoids are particularly interesting classes of fuzzy subalgebras. In such a case a fuzzy subset ''s'' of a monoid (M,•,'''u''') is a '''fuzzy submonoid''' if and only if

# &lt;math&gt;s(\mathbf{u})=1&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;s(x) \odot s(y) \leq s(x \cdot y)&lt;/math&gt;

where '''u''' is the [[neutral element]] in A.

Given a group G, a '''fuzzy subgroup''' of G is a fuzzy submonoid s of G such that 
* s(x) ≤ s(x&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).

It is possible to prove that the notion of fuzzy subgroup is strictly related with the notions of [[fuzzy equivalence]]. In fact, assume that S is a set, G a group of transformations in S and (G,s) a fuzzy subgroup of G. Then, by setting 

* e(x,y) = Sup{s(h) : h is an element in G such that h(x) = y}

we obtain a fuzzy equivalence. Conversely, let e be a fuzzy equivalence in S and, for every transformation h of S, set 

* s(h)= Inf{e(x,h(x)): x∈S}.

Then s defines a fuzzy sub[[group of transformation]] in S. In a similar way we can relate the fuzzy submonoids with the fuzzy orders.

'''Giuseppe Campani''' (1635–July 28, 1715){{sfn|Hockey|2009}} was an [[Italy|Italian]] optician and [[astronomer]] who lived in [[Rome]] during the latter half of the 17th century.

==Instrument maker==

Giuseppe Campani was born in 1635.{{sfn|Hockey|2009}}
He was an [[Umbria]]n from Castel San Felice near [[Spoleto]].
His lenses and telescopes, made in Rome, were sent as far as [[Florence]] and [[Paris]].{{sfn|Early Italian Scientific Academies|p=154}}
Campani was known as the best maker of optical instruments of his age.{{sfn|Williams|1871|p=129}}
His brother, [[Matteo Campani-Alimenis]], and he were experts in grinding and polishing [[Lens (optics)|lenses]], especially for very long [[focal length]] [[aerial telescope]] [[Objective (optics)|objectives]].{{sfn|Trier|Gaulke|2007|p=185}}
His brother is also noted as a mechanician for his work on clocks. He was a priest in charge of a parish in Rome.

[[Louis XIV of France]] ordered several long-focus lenses (86, 100, 136 feet respectively) for the astronomer [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}
With these Cassini found several moons of the planet [[Saturn]], among other discoveries.{{sfn|Williams|1871|p=129}}
[[Constantijn Huygens, Jr.]], brother of [[Christiaan Huygens]], acquired one of Campani's telescopes.
While in London in 1689 he ordered a new tube for the instrument from the instrument maker John Marshall.{{sfn|Zuidervaart|2011|p=53}}

==Astronomer==

Campani made many observations himself. Cassini called his attention to the spots on [[Jupiter]], and he disputed with [[Eustachio Divini]], an Italian optician, the priority of their discovery. His astronomical observations and his descriptions of his telescopes are detailed in the following papers: ''Ragguaglio di due nuovi osservazioni, una celeste in ordine alla stella di Saturno, e terrestre l'altra in ordine agl' instrumenti'' (Rome, 1664, and again in 1665); ''Lettere di G. C. al sig. Giovanni Domenico Cassini intorno alle ombre delle stelle Medicee nel volto di Giove, ed altri nuovi fenomeni celesti scoperti co' suoi occhiali'' (Rome, 1666).

==Instruments==

Campani's entire workshop was donated to the ''Gabinetto di Fisica'' of the [[Academy of Sciences of Bologna Institute]] in 1747.{{sfn|Field|James|1997|p=232}}
His telescopes were {{convert|20|to|50|ft}} in length.
A {{convert|10|ft}} telescope by Campani was tested in 1871 and was found to provide good definition and a flat field, with a magnification of about 20 times.{{sfn|Williams|1871|p=130}} 
A  tripod compound monocular microscope made by Campani is held in the Billings microscope collection at [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].{{sfn|Davidson|2003}}

'''Kenneth A. Kermack''' (1919 &amp;ndash; 2000) was a British [[palaeontologist]] at [[University College London]] most notable for his work on early mammals with his wife, [[Doris Mary Kermack]].&lt;ref name="Kielan-Jaworowska2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska|title=In Pursuit of Early Mammals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wuwtxuJoX6IC&amp;pg=PA80|date=12 July 2013|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-00824-4|pages=80–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Kermack's other significant contributions was the observation that ''[[Diplodocus]]'' could not have had an aquatic lifestyle because sheer water pressure alone on its chest would have prevented it breathing whilst submerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kermack | first1 = K.

==History==
''Kepler'' was part of NASA's [[Discovery Program]] of relatively low-cost science missions. The telescope's construction and initial operation were managed by NASA's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], with [[Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies|Ball Aerospace]] responsible for developing the ''Kepler'' flight system. The [[Ames Research Center]] is responsible for the ground system development, mission operations since December 2009, and scientific data analysis. The initial planned lifetime was 3.5 years,&lt;ref Name="BBC7March"&gt;{{cite news |title=Nasa launches Earth hunter probe |work=[[BBC News]] |date=March 7, 2009 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7926277.stm |accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but greater-than-expected [[Noisy data|noise in the data]], from both the stars and the spacecraft, meant additional time was needed to fulfill all mission goals. Initially, in 2012, the mission was expected to be extended until 2016,&lt;ref name="Space.com2016"&gt;[http://www.space.com/15160-alien-planet-kepler-mission-2016.html "NASA Extends Planet-Hunting Kepler Mission Through 2016"]. Space.com. April 4, 2012. Retrieved May 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; but on July 14, 2012, one of the spacecraft's four [[reaction wheel]]s used for pointing the spacecraft stopped turning, and completing the mission would only be possible if all other reaction wheels remained reliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Stephen |last=Clark |title=Kepler's exoplanet survey jeopardized by two issues |publisher=Spaceflight Now |date=October 16, 2012 |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1210/16kepler/ |accessdate=October 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, on May 11, 2013, a second reaction wheel failed, disabling the collection of science data&lt;ref name=prs&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/news/keplerm-20130521.html NASA - Kepler Mission Manager Update (May 21, 2013)]&lt;/ref&gt; and threatening the continuation of the mission.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/16/science/space/equipment-failure-may-cut-kepler-mission-short.html |title=Equipment Failure May Cut Kepler Mission Short |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 15, 2013 |accessdate=May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 15, 2013, NASA announced that they had given up trying to fix the two failed reaction wheels. This meant the current mission needed to be modified, but it did not necessarily mean the end of planet hunting. NASA had asked the space science community to propose alternative mission plans "potentially including an exoplanet search, using the remaining two good reaction wheels and thrusters".&lt;ref name="NASA-20130815"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-ends-attempts-to-fully-recover-kepler-spacecraft-potential-new-missions-considered/ |title=NASA Ends Attempts to Fully Recover Kepler Spacecraft, Potential New Missions Considered |date=August 15, 2013 |accessdate=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20130815"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |title=NASA's Kepler Mended, but May Never Fully Recover |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/16/science/space/nasas-kepler-mended-but-may-never-fully-recover.html |date=August 15, 2013 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SP-20130815"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wall |first=Mike |title=Planet-Hunting Days of NASA's Kepler Spacecraft Likely Over |url=http://www.space.com/22387-nasa-planet-hunting-kepler-spacecraft-problems.html |date=August 15, 2013 |work=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23724344 |title=Kepler: NASA retires prolific telescope from planet-hunting duties |work=BBC News |date=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 18, 2013, the [[#Second Light (K2)|''K2'']] "Second Light" proposal was reported.

==Spacecraft design==

[[File:Kepler Space Telescope.stl|alt=Interactive 3D model of Kepler|thumb|Interactive 3D model of ''Kepler'']]
The spacecraft has a mass of {{convert|1039|kg|lb}} and contains a [[Schmidt camera]] with a {{convert|0.95|m|in|1|adj=on|sp=us}} front corrector plate (lens) feeding a {{convert|1.4|m|in|0|adj=on|sp=us}} [[primary mirror]]—at the time of its launch this was the largest mirror on any telescope outside Earth orbit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Atkins |first=William |title=Exoplanet Search Begins with French Launch of Corot Telescope Satellite |url=http://www.itwire.com/content/view/8299/1066/ |publisher=iTWire |date=December 28, 2008 |accessdate=May 6, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204114533/http://www.itwire.com/content/view/8299/1066/ |archivedate=December 4, 2008 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the [[Herschel Space Observatory]] took this title a few months later. Its telescope has a 115 deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (about 12-degree diameter) [[field of view]] (FOV), roughly equivalent to the size of one's fist held at arm's length. Of this, 105 deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is of science quality, with less than 11% [[vignetting]]. The photometer has a [[soft focus]] to provide excellent [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]], rather than sharp images. The mission goal was a combined differential photometric precision (CDPP) of 20 ppm for a ''m''(V)=12 Sun-like star for a 6.5-hour integration, though the observations fell short of this objective (see [[#Mission status|mission status]]).

===Camera===
[[File:Keplerspacecraft-FocalPlane-cutout.svg|thumb|left|''Kepler''{{'s}} image sensor array. The array is curved to account for [[Petzval field curvature]].]]
The focal plane of the spacecraft's camera is made out of forty-two {{convert|50|xx|25|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} [[Charge-coupled device|CCDs]] at 2200×1024 [[pixel]]s each, possessing a total resolution of 94.6 [[megapixels]],&lt;ref name="Caldwell2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/spacecraft/index.html |title=Kepler: Spacecraft and Instrument |publisher=NASA |editor-first=Michele |editor-last=Johnson |date=July 30, 2015 |accessdate=December 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which at the time made it the largest camera system launched into space.&lt;ref name="BBC7March" /&gt; The array was cooled by heat pipes connected to an external radiator.&lt;ref name=presskit&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/314125main_Kepler_presskit_2-19_smfile.pdf |title=Kepler: NASA's First Mission Capable of Finding Earth-Size Planets |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=February 2009 |accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CCDs were read out every 6.5 seconds (to limit saturation) and co-added on board for 58.89 seconds for short cadence targets, and 1765.5 seconds (29.4 minutes) for long cadence targets.&lt;ref name="Kepler/K2 Data Products"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/data-products.html |title=Kepler and K2 data products |publisher=NASA |editor-first=Geert |editor-last=Barentsen |date=August 16, 2017 |accessdate=August 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the larger bandwidth requirements for the former, these were limited in number to 512 compared to 170,000 for long cadence. However, even though at launch ''Kepler'' had the highest data rate of any NASA mission, {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} the 29-minute sums of all 95 million pixels constituted more data than could be stored and sent back to Earth. Therefore, the science team pre-selected the relevant pixels associated with each star of interest, amounting to about 6 percent of the pixels (5.4 megapixels). The data from these pixels was then requantized, compressed and stored, along with other auxiliary data, in the on-board 16 gigabyte solid-state recorder. Data that was stored and downlinked includes science stars, [[p-mode star]]s, smear, black level, background and full field-of-view images.&lt;ref name="presskit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PyKE Primer – 2.

===Primary mirror===
[[File:comparison optical telescope primary mirrors.svg|thumb|Comparison of primary mirror sizes for the ''Kepler'' spacecraft and other notable optical telescopes.]]

The ''Kepler'' primary mirror is {{convert|1.4|m|ft|sp=us}} in diameter. Manufactured by glass maker [[Corning Inc.|Corning]] using [[Ultra low expansion glass|ultra-low expansion (ULE) glass]], the mirror is specifically designed to have a mass only 14% that of a solid mirror of the same size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kepler Primary Mirror |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/multimedia/images/PMA_backside_inspection_1_at_SOC.html |publisher=NASA |accessdate=April 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Corning To Build Primary Mirror For Kepler Photometer |url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/extrasolar-03q.html |accessdate=April 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to produce a space telescope system with sufficient sensitivity to detect relatively small planets, as they pass in front of stars, a very high reflectance coating on the primary mirror was required. Using [[Electron beam physical vapor deposition|ion assisted evaporation]], Surface Optics Corp. applied a protective nine-layer silver coating to enhance reflection and a dielectric interference coating to minimize the formation of color centers and atmospheric moisture absorption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fulton L. |first1=Michael |last2=Dummer |first2=Richard S. |date=2011 |title=Advanced Large Area Deposition Technology for Astronomical and Space Applications |journal=Vacuum &amp; Coating Technology |volume= |issue=December 2011 |pages=43–47 |publisher= |doi= |url=http://e-ditionsbyfry.com/Olive/ODE/VTC/Default.aspx?href=VTC/2011/12/01 |accessdate=April 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Ball Aerospace Completes Primary Mirror and Detector Array Assembly Milestones for Kepler Mission |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=23610 |date=September 25, 2007 |publisher=Ball Aerospace and Technologies |work=SpaceRef.com |accessdate=April 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photometric performance===
In terms of photometric performance, ''Kepler'' has worked well, much better than any Earth-bound telescope, but short of design goals. The objective was a combined differential photometric precision (CDPP) of 20 parts per million (PPM) on a magnitude&amp;nbsp;12 star for a 6.5-hour integration. This estimate was developed allowing 10&amp;nbsp;ppm for stellar variability, roughly the value for the Sun. The obtained accuracy for this observation has a wide range, depending on the star and position on the focal plane, with a median of 29&amp;nbsp;ppm. Most of the additional noise appears to be due to a larger-than-expected variability in the stars themselves (19.5&amp;nbsp;ppm as opposed to the assumed 10.0&amp;nbsp;ppm), with the rest due to instrumental noise sources slightly larger than predicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gilliland |first1=Ronald L. |date=2011 |title=Kepler Mission Stellar and Instrument Noise Properties |arxiv=1107.5207 |display-authors=etal |doi=10.1088/0067-0049/197/1/6 |volume=197 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series |page=6 |bibcode=2011ApJS..197....6G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Caldwell2010"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Douglas A. |last1=Caldwell |first2=Jeffrey E. |last2=van Cleve |first3=Jon M. |last3=Jenkins |first4=Vic S. |last4=Argabright |first5=Jeffery J. |last5=Kolodziejczak |first6=Edward W. |last6=Dunham |first7=John C. |last7=Geary |first8=Peter |last8=Tenenbaum |first9=Hema |last9=Chandrasekaran |first10=Jie |last10=Li |first11=Hayley |last11=Wu |first12=Jason |last12=von Wilpert |display-authors=5 |url=http://kepler.nasa.gov/Science/ForScientists/papersAndDocumentation/SOCpapers/spie_2010_instrument_char_web_version.pdf |title=Kepler Instrument Performance: An In-Flight Update |journal=[[Proceedings of SPIE]] |series=Space Telescopes and Instrumentation 2010: Optical, Infrared, and Millimeter Wave |publisher=International Society for Optics and Photonics |editor1-last=Oschmann, Jr |editor1-first=Jacobus M. |editor2-last=Clampin |editor2-first=Mark C. |editor3-last=MacEwen |editor3-first=Howard A. |volume=7731 |at=773117 |date=July 2010 |doi=10.1117/12.856638 |bibcode=2010SPIE.7731E..17C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because decrease in brightness from an Earth-size planet transiting a Sun-like star is so small, only 80&amp;nbsp;ppm, the increased noise means each individual transit is only a 2.7&amp;nbsp;σ event, instead of the intended 4&amp;nbsp;σ. This, in turn, means more transits must be observed to be sure of a detection. Scientific estimates indicated that a mission lasting 7 to 8 years, as opposed to the originally planned 3.5 years, would be needed to find all transiting Earth-sized planets.&lt;ref name="SandT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/126242378.html |title=Kepler's Dilemma: Not Enough Time |publisher=Sky and Telescope |first=Kelly |last=Beatty |date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 4, 2012, the ''Kepler'' mission was approved for extension through the fiscal year 2016,&lt;ref name=Space.com2016/&gt;&lt;ref name="mission extension"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kepler.nasa.gov/news/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=199 |title=NASA Approves Kepler Mission Extension |publisher=NASA |date=April 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this also depended on all remaining reaction wheels staying healthy, which turned out not to be the case (see [[#Spacecraft history|Spacecraft history]] below).

===Orbit and orientation===

''Kepler'' [[heliocentric orbit|orbits the Sun]],&lt;ref name="keplerlaunch1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Koch |first1=David |last2=Gould |first2=Alan |title=Kepler Mission: Launch Vehicle and Orbit |url=http://kepler.nasa.gov/sci/design/orbit.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622161529/http://kepler.nasa.gov/sci/design/orbit.html |archivedate=June 22, 2007 |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=March 2009 |accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which avoids Earth [[occultation]]s, stray light, and [[gravity|gravitational]] perturbations and [[torque]]s inherent in an Earth orbit.

NASA has characterized ''Kepler''{{'s}} orbit as "Earth-trailing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/spacecraft/index-mission.html |title=Kepler: Spacecraft and Instrument |publisher=NASA |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With an orbital period of 372.5 days, ''Kepler'' is slowly falling farther behind Earth (about 16 million miles [[wikt:per annum|per annum]]). {{As of|2018|05|01|df=US}}, the distance to ''Kepler'' from Earth was about {{convert|0.917|AU|e6km|0|abbr=unit}}.&lt;ref name="horizons"/&gt;
This means that after about 26 years ''Kepler'' will reach the other side of the sun and will get back to the neighborhood of the earth after 51 years.

Until 2013 the [[photometer]] pointed to a field in the [[Celestial coordinate system|northern]] [[constellation]]s of [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]], [[Lyra]] and [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]], which is well out of the [[ecliptic]] plane, so that sunlight never enters the photometer as the spacecraft orbits.&lt;ref name="presskit"/&gt; This is also the direction of the Solar System's motion around the center of the galaxy. Thus, the stars which ''Kepler'' observed are roughly the same distance from the galactic center as the [[Solar System]], and also close to the [[galactic plane]]. This fact is important if position in the galaxy is related to habitability, as suggested by the [[Rare Earth hypothesis]].

Orientation is 3-axis stabilised by sensing rotations using [[fine-guidance sensor]]s located on the instrument focal plane (instead of rate sensing gyroscopes, eg. as used on [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/314125main_Kepler_presskit_2-19_smfile.pdf Kepler press kit]&lt;/ref&gt; and using [[reaction wheel]]s to control the orientation.

===Operations===
[[Image:Kepler orbit.png|thumb|''Kepler''{{'s}} orbit. The spacecraft's solar array is adjusted at [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es.]]

''Kepler'' is operated out of [[Boulder, Colorado]], by the [[Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics]] (LASP) under contract to [[Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies]]. The spacecraft's solar array is rotated to face the Sun at the [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es, so as to optimize the amount of sunlight falling on the solar array and to keep the heat radiator pointing towards deep space.&lt;ref name=presskit/&gt; Together, LASP and Ball Aerospace control the spacecraft from a mission operations center located on the research campus of the [[University of Colorado Boulder|University of Colorado]]. LASP performs essential mission planning and the initial collection and distribution of the science data. The mission's initial life-cycle cost was estimated at US$600 million, including funding for 3.5 years of operation.&lt;ref name=presskit/&gt; In 2012, NASA announced that the ''Kepler'' mission would be funded until 2016 at a cost of about $20 million per year.&lt;ref name=Space.com2016/&gt;

====Communications====
NASA contacts the spacecraft using the [[X band]] communication link twice a week for command and status updates. Scientific data are downloaded once a month using the [[Ka band|K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; band]] link at a maximum data transfer rate of approximately 550&amp;nbsp;[[kB/s]]. The high gain antenna is not steerable so data collection is interrupted for a day to reorient the whole spacecraft and the high gain antenna for communications to  Earth.&lt;ref name=KPK&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/314125main_Kepler_presskit_2-19_smfile.pdf ''Kepler press kit'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16}} 

The ''Kepler'' spacecraft conducts its own partial analysis on board and only transmits scientific data deemed necessary to the mission in order to conserve bandwidth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ng |first=Jansen |url=http://www.dailytech.com/Kepler+Mission+Sets+Out+to+Find+Planets+Using+CCD+Cameras/article14421.htm |title=Kepler Mission Sets Out to Find Planets Using CCD Cameras |work=DailyTech |date=March 8, 2009 |accessdate=March 14, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310010146/http://www.dailytech.com/Kepler+Mission+Sets+Out+to+Find+Planets+Using+CCD+Cameras/article14421.htm# |archive-date=March 10, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Data management====
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
Science data telemetry collected during mission operations at LASP is sent for processing to the ''Kepler'' Data Management Center (DMC) which is located at the [[Space Telescope Science Institute]] on the campus of [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. The science data telemetry is decoded and processed into uncalibrated [[FITS]]-format science data products by the DMC, which are then passed along to the Science Operations Center (SOC) at NASA Ames Research Center, for calibration and final processing. The SOC at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) develops and operates the tools needed to process scientific data for use by the ''Kepler'' Science Office (SO). Accordingly, the SOC develops the pipeline data processing software based on scientific algorithms developed jointly by the SO and SOC. During operations, the SOC:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/manuals/KSCI-19081-002-KDPH.pdf |title=Kepler Data Processing Handbook (KSCI-19081-002) |date=January 25, 2017 |first=Jon M. |last=Jenkins |publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Receives uncalibrated pixel data from the DMC
#Applies the analysis algorithms to produce calibrated pixels and light curves for each star
#Performs transit searches for detection of planets (threshold-crossing events, or TCEs)
#Performs data validation of candidate planets by evaluating various data products for consistency as a way to eliminate false positive detections
The SOC also evaluates the photometric performance on an ongoing basis and provides the performance metrics to the SO and Mission Management Office. Finally, the SOC develops and maintains the project's scientific databases, including catalogs and processed data. The SOC finally returns calibrated data products and scientific results back to the DMC for long-term archiving, and distribution to astronomers around the world through the Multimission Archive at STScI (MAST).

====Reaction wheel failures====
On July 14, 2012, one of the four [[reaction wheel]]s used for fine pointing of the spacecraft failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/news/keplerm-20122407.html |title=Kepler Mission Manager Update |date=July 24, 2012 |first=Roger |last=Hunter |publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; While ''Kepler'' requires only three reaction wheels to accurately aim the telescope, another failure would leave the spacecraft unable to aim at its original field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kepler glitch may lower odds of finding Earth's twin |date=July 24, 2012 |first=Maggie |last=McKee |publisher=New Scientist |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22096-kepler-glitch-may-lower-odds-of-finding-earths-twin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After showing some problems in January 2013, a second reaction wheel failed on May 11, 2013, ending ''Kepler''{{'s}} primary mission. The spacecraft was put into safe mode, then from June to August 2013 a series of engineering tests were done to try to recover either failed wheel. By August 15, 2013, it was decided that the wheels were unrecoverable,&lt;ref name="NASA-20130815" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20130815" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SP-20130815" /&gt; and an engineering report was ordered to assess the spacecraft's remaining capabilities.&lt;ref name="NASA-20130815" /&gt;

This effort ultimately led to the "K2" follow-on mission observing different fields near the ecliptic.

On April 20, 2009, it was announced that the ''Kepler'' science team had concluded that further refinement of the focus would dramatically increase the scientific return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/news/keplerm-20090420.html |title=04.20.09 – Kepler Mission Manager Update |date=April 20, 2009 |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=April 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 23, 2009, it was announced that the focus had been successfully optimized by moving the primary mirror 40&amp;nbsp;[[micrometer (unit)|micrometers]] (1.6&amp;nbsp;thousandths of an inch) towards the focal plane and tilting the primary mirror 0.0072 degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/news/keplerm-20090424.html |title=04.23.09 – Kepler Mission Manager Update |date=April 23, 2009 |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=April 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 19, 2009, the spacecraft successfully sent its first science data to Earth. It was discovered that ''Kepler'' had entered [[Safe mode (spacecraft)|safe mode]] on June 15. A second safe mode event occurred on July 2. In both cases the event was triggered by a ''processor reset''. The spacecraft resumed normal operation on July 3 and the science data that had been collected since June 19 was downlinked that day.&lt;ref name="Update20090707"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kepler.nasa.gov/Mission/mmupdates/missionManagerArchive/ |title=2009 July 7 Mission Manager Update |date=July 7, 2009 |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 14, 2009, the cause of these safing events was determined to be a [[low voltage]] power supply that provides power to the [[RAD750]] processor.&lt;ref name="Update20091014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/news/keplerm-20091014.html |title=Kepler Mission Manager Update |date=October 14, 2009 |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=October 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 12, 2010, one portion of the focal plane transmitted anomalous data, suggesting a problem with focal plane MOD-3 module, covering two out of ''Kepler''{{'s}} 42 [[Charge-coupled device|CCDs]]. {{As of|2010|10}}, the module was described as "failed", but the coverage still exceeded the science goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kepler outlook positive; Followup Observing Program in full swing |url=http://kepler.nasa.gov/news/mmu/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=55 |date=August 23, 2010 |accessdate=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Field of view==
[[File:Kepler FOV hiRes.jpg|thumb|Diagram of ''Kepler''{{'s}} investigated area with [[celestial coordinates]]]]
[[File:MilkywaykeplerfovbyCRoberts.jpg|thumb|left|The photometer's field of view in the constellations [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]], [[Lyra (constellation)|Lyra]] and [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]]]]
''Kepler'' has a fixed [[field of view]] (FOV) against the sky. The diagram to the right shows the [[celestial coordinates]] and where the detector fields are located, along with the locations of a few bright stars with [[celestial coordinates|celestial north]] at the top left corner. The mission website has a calculator&lt;ref&gt;[http://kepler.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/ra2pix.pl mission website calculator]&lt;/ref&gt; that will determine if a given object falls in the FOV, and if so, where it will appear in the photo detector output data stream. Data on exoplanet candidates is submitted to the [[Kepler Follow-up Program|''Kepler'' Follow-up Program]], or KFOP, to conduct follow-up observations.

''Kepler''{{'s}} field of view covers 115 [[square degree]]s, around 0.25 percent of the sky, or "about two scoops of the Big Dipper". Thus, it would require around 400 ''Kepler''-like telescopes to cover the whole sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ballaerospace.com/page.jsp?page=186 |title=Kepler mission &amp; program information |publisher=[[Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies]] |accessdate=September 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Kepler'' field contains portions of the constellations [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]], [[Lyra]], and [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]].

The nearest star system in ''Kepler'''s field of view is the trinary star system [[Gliese 1245]], 15 light years from the Sun. The brown dwarf WISE J2000+3629, 22.8 ± 1 light years from the Sun is also in the field of view, but is invisible to Kepler due to emitting light primarily in infrared wavelengths.

==Objectives and methods==

The scientific objective of ''Kepler'' is to explore the structure and diversity of [[planetary systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Koch |first1=David |last2=Gould |first2=Alan |title=Overview of the Kepler Mission |url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/kepler/papers/2004/SPIE.Glasgow.Koch.pdf |publisher=SPIE |date=2004 |accessdate=December 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This spacecraft observes a large sample of stars to achieve several key goals:

* To determine how many Earth-size and larger planets there are in or near the [[habitable zone]] (often called "Goldilocks planets")&lt;ref name="Muir"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Muir |first1=Hazel |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11710 |title='Goldilocks' planet may be just right for life |work=[[New Scientist]] |date=April 25, 2007 |accessdate=April 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a wide variety of spectral types of stars.
* To determine the range of size and shape of the orbits of these planets.
* To estimate how many planets there are in multiple-star systems.
* To determine the range of orbit size, brightness, size, mass and density of short-period giant planets.
* To identify additional members of each discovered planetary system using other techniques.
* Determine the properties of those stars that harbor planetary systems.

Most of the [[exoplanet]]s previously detected by other projects were [[giant planet]]s, mostly the size of [[Jupiter]] and bigger. ''Kepler'' is designed to look for planets 30 to 600 times less massive, closer to the order of Earth's mass (Jupiter is 318 times more massive than Earth). The method used, the [[transit method]], involves observing repeated [[Astronomical transit|transit]] of planets in front of their stars, which causes a slight reduction in the star's [[apparent magnitude]], on the order of 0.01% for an Earth-size planet. The degree of this reduction in brightness can be used to deduce the diameter of the planet, and the interval between transits can be used to deduce the planet's orbital period, from which estimates of its orbital [[semi-major axis]] (using [[Kepler's laws#Third law|Kepler's laws]]) and its temperature (using models of stellar radiation) can be calculated.

The probability of a [[random]] [[Orbits of planets|planetary orbit]] being along the line-of-sight to a star is the diameter of the star divided by the diameter of the orbit.&lt;ref name="geomprob"&gt;{{cite web |others=Curators: David Koch, Alan Gould |title=Kepler Mission: Characteristics of Transits (section "Geometric Probability") |url=http://kepler.nasa.gov/sci/basis/character.html |publisher=NASA |date=March 2009 |accessdate=September 21, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825002919/http://kepler.nasa.gov/sci/basis/character.html |archivedate=August 25, 2009 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; For an Earth-size planet at 1&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] transiting a Sun-like star the probability is 0.47%, or about 1 in 210.&lt;ref name="geomprob"/&gt; For a planet like Venus orbiting a Sun-like star the probability is slightly higher, at 0.65%;&lt;ref name="geomprob"/&gt;  If the host star has multiple planets, the probability of additional detections is higher than the probability of initial detection assuming planets in a given system tend to orbit in similar planes—an assumption consistent with current models of planetary system formation.&lt;ref name="geomprob"/&gt; For instance, if a ''Kepler''-like mission conducted by aliens observed Earth transiting the Sun, there is a 12% chance that it would also see [[Venus]] transiting.&lt;ref name="geomprob"/&gt;

''Kepler''{{'s}} 115 deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; field of view gives it a much higher probability of detecting Earth-sized planets than the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], which has a field of view of only [[Field of view#Astronomy|10 sq. arc-minutes]]. Moreover, ''Kepler'' is dedicated to detecting planetary transits, while the Hubble Space Telescope is used to address a wide range of scientific questions, and rarely looks continuously at just one starfield. Of the approximately half-million stars in ''Kepler''{{'s}} field of view, around 150,000 stars were selected for observation. More than 90,000 are G-type stars on, or near, the [[main sequence]]. Thus, ''Kepler'' was designed to be sensitive to wavelengths of 400–865&amp;nbsp;nm where brightness of those stars peaks. Most of the stars observed by ''Kepler'' have apparent visual magnitude between 14 and 16 but the brightest observed stars have apparent visual magnitude of 8 or lower. Most of the planet candidates were initially not expected to be confirmed due to being too faint for follow-up observations.&lt;ref name="arXiv-1001.0349v1"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Selection, Prioritization, and Characteristics of Kepler Target Stars |arxiv=1001.0349 |first1=N.

This provides a better chance for seeing a transit. The mission was designed to maximize the probability of detecting planets orbiting other stars.&lt;ref name=presskit /&gt;&lt;ref name="mission_faq"&gt;{{cite web |title=Kepler Mission: Frequently Asked Questions |url=http://kepler.nasa.gov/about/faq.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820000813/http://kepler.nasa.gov/about/faq.html |archivedate=August 20, 2007 |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=March 2009 |accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because ''Kepler'' must observe at least three transits to confirm that the dimming of a star was caused by a transiting planet, and because larger planets give a signal that is easier to check, scientists expected the first reported results to be larger Jupiter-size planets in tight orbits. The first of these were reported after only a few months of operation. Smaller planets, and planets farther from their sun would take longer, and discovering planets comparable to Earth were expected to take three years or longer.&lt;ref name="keplerlaunch1"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Kepler Mission Rockets to Space in Search of Other Earth |url=https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2009/06mar_keplerlaunch.htm?friend |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=March 6, 2009 |accessdate=March 14, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315053534/http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2009/06mar_keplerlaunch.htm?friend |archivedate=March 15, 2009 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planet finding process==

===Finding planet candidates===
[[File:NASA-KeplerSpaceTelescope-ArtistConcept-20141027.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of ''Kepler'']]

Once ''Kepler'' has collected and sent back the data, raw light curves are constructed. Brightness values are then adjusted to take the brightness variations due to the rotation of the spacecraft into account. The next step is processing (folding) light curves into a more easily observable form and letting software select signals that seem potentially transit-like. At this point, any signal that shows potential transit-like features is called a threshold crossing event. These signals are individually inspected in two inspection rounds, with the first round taking only a few seconds per target. This inspection eliminates erroneously selected non-signals, signals caused by instrumental noise and obvious eclipsing binaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/PurposeOfKOITable.html |title=Purpose of Kepler Objects of Interest (KOI) Activity Tables |website=NASA Exoplanet Archive |publisher=NASA Exoplanet Science Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Threshold crossing events that pass these tests are called [[Kepler object of interest|''Kepler'' Objects of Interest]] (KOI), receive a KOI designation and are archived. KOIs are inspected more thoroughly in a process called dispositioning. Those which pass the dispositioning are called ''Kepler'' planet candidates. The KOI archive is not static, meaning that a ''Kepler'' candidate could end up in the false-positive list upon further inspection. In turn, KOIs that were mistakenly classified as false positives could end up back in the candidates list.&lt;ref name="C4WDefault-7178839"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/news/kepler-new-data-q-and-a.html |title=New NASA Kepler Mission Data |date=May 31, 2013 |publisher=[[NASA]] |others=NASA Official: Brian Dunbar; Image credit: NASA Ames/W.

Not all the planet candidates go through this process. [[Circumbinary planet]]s do not show strictly periodic transits, and have to be inspected through other methods. In addition, third-party researchers use different data-processing methods, or even search planet candidates from the unprocessed light curve data. As a consequence, those planets may be missing KOI designation.

===Confirming planet candidates===
[[File:NewKeplerPlanetCandidates-20170619.jpg|thumb|right|Kepler mission - new exoplanet candidates - as of June 19, 2017.&lt;ref name="NASA-20150723-MJ2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/ames/kepler/new-kepler-planet-candidates |title=New Kepler Planet Candidates |publisher=NASA |editor-first=Rick |editor-last=Chen |date=June 19, 2017 |accessdate=August 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Once suitable candidates have been found from ''Kepler'' data, it is necessary to rule out false positives with follow-up tests.

Usually, ''Kepler'' candidates are imaged individually with more-advanced ground-based telescopes in order to resolve any background objects which could contaminate the brightness signature of the transit signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Batalha |first1=Natalie M. |date=2010 |title=Pre-Spectroscopic False Positive Elimination of Kepler Planet Candidates |arxiv=1001.0392 |display-authors=etal |doi=10.1088/2041-8205/713/2/L103 |volume=713 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |pages=L103–L108 |bibcode=2010ApJ...713L.103B}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another method to rule out planet candidates is [[astrometry]] for which ''Kepler'' can collect good data even though doing so was not a design goal. While ''Kepler'' cannot detect planetary-mass objects with this method, it can be used to determine if the transit was caused by a stellar-mass object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last1=Monet |first1=David G. |date=2010 |title=Preliminary Astrometric Results from Kepler |class=astro-ph.IM |eprint=1001.0305|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Through other detection methods====

There are a few different exoplanet detection methods which help to rule out false positives by giving further proof that a candidate is a real planet. One of the methods, called [[doppler spectroscopy]], requires follow-up observations from ground-based telescopes. This method works well if the planet is massive or is located around a relatively bright star. While current spectrographs are insufficient for confirming planetary candidates with small masses around relatively dim stars, this method can be used to discover additional massive non-transiting planet candidates around targeted stars.

[[File:329161main fullFFIHot300.png|thumb|A photo taken by ''Kepler'' with two points of interest outlined. [[Celestial coordinates|Celestial north]] is towards the lower left corner.]]

In multiplanetary systems, planets can often be confirmed through [[transit timing variation]] by looking at the time between successive transits, which may vary if planets are gravitationally perturbed by each other. This helps to confirm relatively low-mass planets even when the star is relatively distant. Transit timing variations indicate that two or more planets belong to the same planetary system. There are even cases where a non-transiting planet is also discovered in this way.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kepler.nasa.gov/news/nasakeplernews/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=226 The Transit Timing Variation (TTV) Planet-finding Technique Begins to Flower]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Circumbinary planet]]s show much larger transit timing variations between transits than planets gravitationally disturbed by other planets. Their transit duration times also vary significantly. Transit timing and duration variations for circumbinary planets are caused by the orbital motion of the host stars, rather than by other planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |title=TASTE: The Asiago Survey for Timing transit variations of Exoplanets |eprint=1009.5905 |class=astro-ph.EP |first1=V. |last1=Nascimbeni |first2=G. |last2=Piotto |first3=L. R. |last3=Bedin |first4=M. |last4=Damasso |date=September 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, if the planet is massive enough, it can cause slight variations of the host stars' orbital periods. Despite being harder to find circumbinary planets due to their non-periodic transits, it is much easier to confirm them, as timing patterns of transits cannot be mimicked by an eclipsing binary or a background star system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Kepler-16: A Transiting Circumbinary Planet |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |first1=Laurance R. |last1=Doyle |first2=Joshua A. |last2=Carter |first3=Daniel C. |last3=Fabrycky |first4=Robert W. |last4=Slawson |first5=Steve B. |last5=Howell |display-authors=etal |volume=333 |issue=6049 |pages=1602–1606 |date=September 2011 |doi=10.1126/science.1210923 |bibcode=2011Sci...333.1602D |arxiv=1109.3432 |pmid=21921192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to transits, planets orbiting around their stars undergo reflected-light variations—like the [[Moon]], they go through [[Planetary phase|phases]] from full to new and back again. Because ''Kepler'' cannot resolve the planet from the star, it sees only the combined light, and the brightness of the host star seems to change over each orbit in a periodic manner. Although the effect is small—the photometric precision required to see a close-in giant planet is about the same as to detect an Earth-sized planet in transit across a solar-type star—Jupiter-sized planets with an orbital period of a few days or less are detectable by sensitive space telescopes such as ''Kepler''. In the long run, this method may help find more planets than the transit method, because the reflected light variation with orbital phase is largely independent of the planet's orbital inclination, and does not require the planet to pass in front of the disk of the star. In addition, the phase function of a giant planet is also a function of its thermal properties and atmosphere, if any. Therefore, the phase curve may constrain other planetary properties, such as the particle size distribution of the atmospheric particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jenkins |first1=J.M. |first2=Laurance R. |last2=Doyle |date=September 20, 2003 |title=Detecting reflected light from close-in giant planets using space-based photometers |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=1 |issue=595 |pages=429–445 |doi=10.1086/377165 |url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/0004-637X/595/1/429/56774.web.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |bibcode=2003ApJ...595..429J |arxiv=astro-ph/0305473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kepler''{{'s}} photometric precision is often high enough to observe a star's brightness changes caused by [[Relativistic beaming|doppler beaming]] or a star's shape deformation by a companion. These can sometimes be used to rule out hot Jupiter candidates as false positives caused by a star or a brown dwarf when these effects are too noticeable.&lt;ref name="arXiv-1402.6534v1"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Validation of Kepler's Multiple Planet Candidates.

====Through validation====

If a planet cannot be detected through at least one of the other detection methods, it can be confirmed by determining if the possibility of a ''Kepler'' candidate being a real planet is significantly larger than any false-positive scenarios combined. One of the first methods was to see if other telescopes can see the transit as well. The first planet confirmed through this method was [[Kepler-22b]] which was also observed with a Spitzer space telescope in addition to analyzing any other false-positive possibilities.&lt;ref name="bbc20111205"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-16040655 |title=Kepler 22-b: Earth-like planet confirmed |date=December 5, 2011 |work=[[BBC Online]] |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such confirmation is costly, as small planets can generally be detected only with space telescopes.

In 2014, a new confirmation method called "validation by multiplicity" was announced. From the planets previously confirmed through various methods, it was found that planets in most planetary systems orbit in a relatively flat plane, similar to the planets found in the Solar System. This means that if a star has multiple planet candidates, it is very likely a real planetary system.&lt;ref name="NASA-20140226"/&gt; Transit signals still need to meet several criteria which rule out false-positive scenarios. For instance, it has to have considerable signal-to-noise ratio, it has at least three observed transits, orbital stability of those systems have to be stable and transit curve has to have a shape that partly eclipsing binaries could not mimic the transit signal. In addition, its orbital period needs to be 1.6 days or longer to rule out common false positives caused by eclipsing binaries.&lt;ref name="arXiv-1402.6352v1"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Validation of Kepler's Multiple Planet Candidates.

A new validation method using a tool called PASTIS has been developed. It makes it possible to confirm a planet even when only a single candidate transit event for the host star has been detected. A drawback of this tool is that it requires a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio from ''Kepler'' data, so it can mainly confirm only larger planets or planets around quiet and relatively bright stars. Currently, the analysis of ''Kepler'' candidates through this method is underway.&lt;ref name="arXiv-1403.6725v1"&gt;{{cite journal |title=PASTIS: Bayesian Extrasolar Planet Validation. I.

The ''Kepler'' observatory was in active operation from 2009 through 2013, with the first main results announced on January 4, 2010. As expected, the initial discoveries were all short-period planets. As the mission continued, additional longer-period candidates were found. {{As of|2017|10}}, ''Kepler'' has discovered 5,011 exoplanet candidates and 2,512 confirmed exoplanets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/kepler/discoveries |title=How many exoplanets has Kepler discovered? |publisher=NASA |date=October 27, 2017 |accessdate=October 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA held a press conference to discuss early science results of the ''Kepler'' mission on August 6, 2009.&lt;ref name="KeplerBriefing20090806"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/news/releases/2009/M09-94AR.html |title=NASA Announces Briefing About Kepler's Early Science Results |date=August 3, 2009 |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this press conference, it was revealed that ''Kepler'' had confirmed the existence of the previously known transiting exoplanet [[HAT-P-7b]], and was functioning well enough to discover Earth-size planets.&lt;ref name="KeplerPressConf20090806"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/news/kepler-discovery.html |title=NASA's Kepler Spies Changing Phases on a Distant World |date=August 6, 2009 |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=August 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kepler_phases"/&gt;

Because ''Kepler''{{'s}} detection of planets depends on seeing very small changes in brightness, stars that vary in brightness by themselves ([[variable star]]s) are not useful in this search.&lt;ref name="Update20091105"/&gt;  From the first few months of data, ''Kepler'' scientists determined that about 7,500 stars from the initial target list are such variable stars.  These were dropped from the target list, and replaced by new candidates.  On November 4, 2009, the ''Kepler'' project publicly released the light curves of the dropped stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.stsci.edu/mast_news.php?out=html&amp;desc=t&amp;id=342 |title=Kepler dropped stars now public |date=November 4, 2009 |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010===
On June 15, 2010, the ''Kepler'' mission released data on all but 400 of the ~156,000 planetary target stars to the public. 706 targets from this first data set have viable exoplanet candidates, with sizes ranging from as small as Earth to larger than Jupiter. The identity and characteristics of 306 of the 706 targets were given. The released targets included five{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} candidate multi-planet systems, including six extra exoplanet candidates.&lt;ref name=Borucki2010/&gt;  Only 33.5 days of data were available for most of the candidates.&lt;ref name=Borucki2010/&gt;  NASA also announced data for another 400 candidates were being withheld to allow members of the ''Kepler'' team to perform follow-up observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kepler News: First 43 Days of Kepler Data Released |url=http://kepler.arc.nasa.gov/news/nasakeplernews/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=42 |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=May 15, 2010 |accessdate=April 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The data for these candidates was published February 2, 2011.&lt;ref name=borucki/&gt; (See the ''Kepler'' results for [[#2011|2011]] below.)

The frequency of planet observations was highest for exoplanets two to three times Earth-size, and then declined in inverse proportionality to the area of the planet. The best estimate (as of March 2011), after accounting for observational biases, was: 5.4% of stars host Earth-size candidates, 6.8% host super-Earth-size candidates, 19.3% host Neptune-size candidates, and 2.55% host Jupiter-size or larger candidates.

By December 5, 2011, the ''Kepler'' team announced that they had discovered 2,326 planetary candidates, of which 207 are similar in size to Earth, 680 are super-Earth-size, 1,181 are Neptune-size, 203 are Jupiter-size and 55 are larger than Jupiter. Compared to the February 2011 figures, the number of Earth-size and super-Earth-size planets increased by 200% and 140% respectively. Moreover, 48 planet candidates were found in the habitable zones of surveyed stars, marking a decrease from the February figure; this was due to the more stringent criteria in use in the December data.&lt;ref name=KeplerDec2011Results/&gt;

On February 26, scientists announced that data from ''Kepler'' had confirmed the existence of 715 new exoplanets. A new statistical method of confirmation was used called "verification by multiplicity" which is based on how many planets around multiple stars were found to be real planets. This allowed much quicker confirmation of numerous candidates which are part of multiplanetary systems. 95% of the discovered exoplanets were smaller than [[Neptune]] and four, including Kepler-296f, were less than 2 1/2 the size of [[Earth]] and were in [[Circumstellar habitable zone|habitable zones]] where surface temperatures are suitable for liquid [[water]].&lt;ref name="NASA-20140226"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=Michele |last2=Harrington |first2=J.D. |title=NASA's Kepler Mission Announces a Planet Bonanza, 715 New Worlds |url=http://www.nasa.gov/ames/kepler/nasas-kepler-mission-announces-a-planet-bonanza/ |date=February 26, 2014 |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=February 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SP-20140226"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wall |first=Mike |title=Population of Known Alien Planets Nearly Doubles as NASA Discovers 715 New Worlds |url=http://www.space.com/24824-alien-planets-population-doubles-nasa-kepler.html |date=February 26, 2014 |work=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=February 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-20140227"&gt;{{cite news |last=Amos |first=Jonathan |title=Kepler telescope bags huge haul of planets |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-26362433 |date=February 26, 2014 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=February 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140227"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |title=From Kepler Data, Astronomers Find Galaxy Filled With More but Smaller Worlds |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/27/science/space/diving-into-kepler-data-astronomers-discover-hundreds-of-planets.html |date=February 27, 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission status==
''Kepler'' was launched in 2009. It was very successful at finding exoplanets, but failures in two of four reaction wheels crippled its extended mission in 2013. Without three functioning wheels, the telescope could not be pointed accurately.  On October 30, 2018, NASA announced that the spacecraft was out of fuel and its mission was officially ended. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/30/18044152/nasa-kepler-space-telescope-out-of-fuel-dead&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extension===
[[File:Neighborhood21.gif|thumb|Predicted structure of the Milky Way overlaid with the original ''Kepler'' search space.&lt;ref name="QuickGuide" /&gt;]]

In April 2012, an independent panel of senior NASA scientists recommended that the ''Kepler'' mission be continued through 2016. According to the senior review, ''Kepler'' observations needed to continue until at least 2015 to achieve all the stated scientific goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Clark |first1=stephen |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1204/04kepler/ |title=Kepler planet-hunting mission extended until 2016 |date=April 4, 2012 |publisher=Spaceflight Now |accessdate=April 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 14, 2012, NASA announced the completion of ''Kepler''{{'s}} primary mission, and the beginning of its extended mission, which may last as long as four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Release : 12–394 – NASA's Kepler Completes Prime Mission, Begins Extended Mission |url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2012/nov/HQ_12-394_Kepler_Completes_Prime_Mission.html |publisher=NASA |accessdate=November 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction wheel issues===
In July 2012, one of ''Kepler''{{'s}} four [[reaction wheel]]s (wheel 2) failed.&lt;ref name="NASA-20130815" /&gt; On May 11, 2013, a second wheel (wheel 4) failed, jeopardizing the continuation of the mission, as three wheels are necessary for its planet hunting.&lt;ref name=prs/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; ''Kepler'' had not collected science data since May because it was not able to point with sufficient accuracy.&lt;ref name=kep/&gt; On July 18 and 22 reaction wheels 4 and 2 were tested respectively; wheel 4 only rotated counter-clockwise but wheel 2 ran in both directions, albeit with significantly elevated friction levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kepler Mission Manager Update: Initial Recovery Tests |url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/kepler-mission-manager-update-initial-recovery-tests/ |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=September 9, 2013 |date=July 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A further test of wheel 4 on July 25 managed to achieve bi-directional rotation.&lt;ref name="keprecoverytestNASA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/kepler-mission-manager-update-pointing-test |title=Kepler Mission Manager Update: Pointing Test |date=August 2, 2013 |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=August 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both wheels, however, exhibited too much friction to be useful.&lt;ref name="SP-20130815" /&gt; On August 2, NASA put out a call for proposals to use the remaining capabilities of ''Kepler'' for other scientific missions.  Starting on August 8, a full systems evaluation was conducted.  It was determined that wheel 2 could not provide sufficient precision for scientific missions and the spacecraft was returned to a "rest" state to conserve fuel.&lt;ref name="NASA-20130815" /&gt;   Wheel 4 was previously ruled out because it exhibited higher friction levels than wheel 2 in previous tests.&lt;ref name=keprecoverytestNASA/&gt; Sending astronauts to fix ''Kepler'' is not an option because it orbits the Sun and is millions of kilometers from Earth.&lt;ref name="SP-20130815" /&gt;

On August 15, 2013, NASA announced that ''Kepler'' would not continue searching for planets using the transit method after attempts to resolve issues with two of the four reaction wheels failed.&lt;ref name="NASA-20130815" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20130815" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SP-20130815" /&gt; An engineering report was ordered to assess the spacecraft's capabilities, its two good reaction wheels and its thrusters.&lt;ref name="NASA-20130815" /&gt; Concurrently, a scientific study was conducted to determine whether enough knowledge can be obtained from ''Kepler''{{'s}} limited scope to justify its $18 million per year cost.

Possible ideas included searching for asteroids and comets, looking for evidence of supernovas, and finding huge exoplanets through [[gravitational microlensing]].&lt;ref name="SP-20130815" /&gt;  Another proposal was to modify the software on ''Kepler'' to compensate for the disabled reaction wheels. Instead of the stars being fixed and stable in ''Kepler''{{'s}} field of view, they will drift. However, proposed software was to track this drift and more or less completely recover the mission goals despite being unable to hold the stars in a fixed view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |title=KeSeF - Kepler Self Follow-up Mission |eprint=1308.2252 |class=astro-ph.EP |first=Aviv |last=Ofir |date=August 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Citizen scientist participation===
Since December 2010, ''Kepler'' mission data has been used for the [[Planet Hunters]] project, which allows volunteers to look for transit events in the light curves of ''Kepler'' images to identify planets that computer [[algorithm]]s might miss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Andrews |first1=Bill |title=Become a Planet Hunter! |url=http://cs.astronomy.com/asycs/blogs/astronomy/archive/2010/12/20/become-a-planet-hunter.aspx |publisher=[[Astronomy (magazine)|Astronomy]] |date=December 20, 2010 |accessdate=April 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By June 2011, users had found sixty-nine potential candidates that were previously unrecognized by the ''Kepler'' mission team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Planetometer |url=http://www.planethunters.org/planetometer |publisher=[[Zooniverse]] |accessdate=June 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721124511/http://www.planethunters.org/planetometer |archivedate=July 21, 2011 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team has plans to publicly credit amateurs who spot such planets.

In January 2012, the [[BBC]] program ''[[Stargazing Live]]'' aired a public appeal for volunteers to analyse Planethunters.org data for potential new exoplanets. This led two amateur astronomers&amp;mdash;one in [[Peterborough]], [[England]]&amp;mdash;to discover a new [[Neptune]]-sized exoplanet, to be named Threapleton Holmes B.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/space/9026837/Amateur-stargazers-discover-new-planet.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |title=Amateur stargazers discover new planet |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |date=January 20, 2012 |accessdate=January 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One hundred thousand other volunteers were also engaged in the search by late January, analyzing over one million ''Kepler'' images by early 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-16612181 |title=Stargazing viewer in planet coup |publisher=BBC News |date=January 18, 2012 |accessdate=January 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such exoplanet, [[PH1b]] (or Kepler-64b from its Kepler designation), was discovered in 2012. A second exoplanet, [[PH2b]] (Kepler-86b) was discovered in 2013.

In April 2017, [[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC]] ''Stargazing Live'', a variation of BBC ''Stargazing Live'', launched the Zooniverse project "Exoplanet Explorers". While Planethunters.org worked with archived data, Exoplanet Explorers used recently downlinked data from the K2 mission. On the first day of the project, 184 transit candidates were identified that passed simple tests. On the second day, the research team identified a star system, later named [[K2-138b|K2-138]], with a Sun-like star and four [[super-Earth]]s in a tight orbit. In the end, volunteers helped to identify 90 exoplanet candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/ianc2/exoplanet-explorers/about/results |title=We Got One!!! |series=Exoplanet Explorers |work=Zooniverse.org |accessdate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blog.zooniverse.org/2017/04/07/stargazing-live-2017-thank-you-all/ |title=Stargazing Live 2017: Thank you all! |work=Zooniverse.org |date=April 7, 2017 |accessdate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[citizen science|citizen scientists]] that helped discover the new star system will be added as co-authors in the research paper when published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-04-06/stargazing-live-four-planets-discovered-in-new-solar-system/8423142 |title=Stargazing Live viewers find four-planet solar system via crowd-sourcing project |publisher=ABC News |first=Daniel |last=Miller |date=April 6, 2017 |accessdate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Kepler'' Input Catalog==
{{Main|Kepler Input Catalog}}
The [[Kepler Input Catalog]] is a publicly searchable database of roughly 13.2 million targets used for the Kepler Spectral Classification Program and the ''Kepler'' mission.&lt;ref name="kic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/kic10/help/search_help.html |title=MAST KIC Search Help |publisher=[[Space Telescope Science Institute]] |accessdate=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/kic10/search.php |title=KIC10 Search |accessdate=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The catalog alone is not used for finding ''Kepler'' targets, because only a portion of the listed stars (about one-third of the catalog) can be observed by the spacecraft.&lt;ref name=kic/&gt;

==Solar System observations==
''Kepler'' has been assigned an [[List of observatory codes|observatory code]] {{Obscode|C55}} in order to report its [[astrometric]] observations of [[small Solar System bodies]] to the [[Minor Planet Center]]. In 2013 the alternative ''NEOKepler'' mission was proposed, a search for [[near-Earth object]]s, in particular [[potentially hazardous asteroid]]s (PHAs). Its unique orbit and larger field of view than existing survey telescopes allow it to look for objects inside Earth's orbit. It was predicted a 12-month survey could make a significant contribution to the hunt for PHAs as well as potentially locating targets for NASA's [[Asteroid Redirect Mission]].&lt;ref name="Stevenson2013"&gt;{{cite arXiv |title=NEOKepler: Discovering Near-Earth Objects Using the Kepler Spacecraft |eprint=1309.1096 |class=astro-ph.EP |first1=Kevin B. |last1=Stevenson |first2=Daniel |last2=Fabrycky |first3=Robert |last3=Jedicke |first4=William |last4=Bottke |first5=Larry |last5=Denneau |date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kepler''{{'s}} first discovery in the Solar System, however, was {{LoMP|506121|{{mp|506121|2016 BP|81}}}}, a 200-kilometer cold [[classical Kuiper belt object]] located [[Trans-Neptunian object|beyond the orbit of Neptune]].&lt;ref name="MPC-object"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/db_search/show_object?object_id=506121 |title=506121 (2016 BP81) |work=Minor Planet Center |accessdate=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|Falklands War}}

The area was explored by the [[Swedish Antarctic Expedition]] of 1901-04 under [[Otto Nordenskiöld]]. It was named around 1906 after King [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom]].

Since 1909, King Edward Point has been the residence of a British Magistrate administering the island.

In 1925, the government of the [[United Kingdom]] established a marine laboratory there as part of the [[Discovery Investigations]].

==Research station==
On 1 January 1950, the station ownership was assumed by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey. The station was manned from 1 January 1952 to 13 November 1969.

The [[British Antarctic Survey]] provided the British presence at the station until 1982.

At the beginning of the [[Falklands War]] on 3 April 1982, Argentine forces occupied South Georgia and closed the station. They were soon expelled during [[Operation Paraquet]] and British military forces occupied the point.

A series of civilian Marine Officers was appointed to carry out customs and fisheries duties for the South Georgia Government from 1991, and were billeted with the small garrison.

On 22 March 2001, the [[British Antarctic Survey]] reopened the station on behalf of the Government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (GSGSSI). Most of the old, dilapidated (and arguably historic) buildings were destroyed to make way for new ones, with the exception of Discovery House (1925) and the Gaol (1912).

[[File:King Edward Point on South Georgia 1.jpg|thumb|King Edward Point in 2011]]
Currently twelve BAS personnel overwinter at the station, rising to around 22 in summer. Two Government Officers plus partners are stationed on KEP, overlapping by about three months during the busy winter fishing season. Summer staff from the Museum at [[Grytviken]] are also accommodated at KEP.

The continued occupation of the station serves a political purpose as well: it helps to maintain British sovereignty against [[Argentina]]'s claim for ownership of the territory.
 
The chief activities of the station are applied fisheries research on behalf of the Government of [[South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands]], to assist its policies for sustainable management of the commercial fishery, and to provide logistic support for the Government Officer(s).

[[File:Billy-Lila May 10 1986 0911Z.png|thumb|right|Cyclone Billy–Lila near peak strength off the western coast of Australia on 10 May 1986]]
An off-season [[Australian region tropical cyclone|Australian tropical cyclone]] is a tropical cyclone that existed in the Australian Region, between 90°E and 160°E, outside of the official season. The [[World Meteorological Organization]] currently defines the season as occurring between 1 November and 30 April, of the following year, which is when the majority of all tropical cyclones exist. During the off-season, systems are more likely to either develop during or persist until May, with approximately 52% of such storms occurring during that month. Occasionally, however, storms develop in October, with approximately 34% of such storms occurring during that month. As of 2017, there have been 86 tropical cyclones known to have occurred off-season.

Off-season cyclones are most likely to occur in the Coral Sea, with most affecting land in some way. Cumulatively, at least 4 deaths occurred due to the storms, &lt;!-- primarily on the islands of Hispaniola and Cuba; a tropical storm in May 1948 struck the Dominican Republic to become the deadliest off-season storm. However, an unofficial hurricane in 1863 killed 110 people, in a shipwreck off Florida and on land. The same storm was estimated to have reached winds of 105 mph (165 km/h), making it the strongest hurricane between December to May; the strongest currently in the official database was a March hurricane in 1908 that reached winds of 100 mph (160 km/h). In addition, the strongest off-season cyclone to make landfall in the United States was Tropical Storm Beryl in 2012, which made landfall near Jacksonville Beach, Florida with 65 mph (100 km/h) winds. --&gt; The most recent off-season storm was Tropical Cyclone Greg in May 2017.

==Systems==
The wind speeds listed are [[Maximum sustained wind|maximum ten-minute average sustained winds]], while the pressure is the minimum [[barometric pressure]], both of which are estimates taken from the archives of either [[Meteo France]], the Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]], the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]], and New Zealand's [[MetService]]. If there are no known estimates of either the winds or pressure then the system is listed as "Not specified" under winds or pressure, if there is no known estimated winds or pressure. For deaths and damages "None" indicates that there were no reports of fatalities, although such storms may have impacted land. The damage totals are the [[United States dollar]] of the year of the storm.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MODELISAR goals were to:
* Support the [[AUTOSAR]] (AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture) standard (AUTOSAR is a [[standardized]] [[automotive software]] architecture)
* Develop the [[Functional Mock-up Interface]] standardized interface

The MODELISAR project started in 2008 , ended Dec 2011 to define the [[Functional Mock-up Interface]] specifications, deliver technology studies, prove the FMI concepts through Use Cases elaborated by the consortium partners and enable tool vendors to build advanced prototypes or in some cases even products.
MODELISAR has been awarded during ITEA 2 &amp; ARTEMIS co summit with a Silver award. See [https://web.archive.org/web/20120905081532/http://www.itea2.org/cosummit2012_achievementaward ITEA 2 achievement award]

Although in MODELISAR the focus was driven by automotive Use Cases, the FMI specifications could be independently defined. Therefore the FMI can now address others industrial domains such as Energy, Aerospace, Rail.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3349">'''Minimalism''' in [[structured writing]], [[topic-based authoring]], and technical writing in general is based on the ideas of [[John M. Carroll (information scientist)|John Millar Carroll]] and others. Minimalism strives to reduce interference of information delivery with the user's sense-making process. It does not try to eliminate any chance of the user making a mistake, but regards an error as a teachable moment that content can exploit.

Like [[Robert E. Horn]]'s work on [[information mapping]], John Carroll's principles of Minimalism were based in part on cognitive studies and learning research at Harvard and Columbia University, by [[Jerome Bruner]], [[Jerome Kagan]], [[B.F. Skinner]], [[George Armitage Miller|George A. Miller]], and others. Carroll argues that training materials should present short task-oriented chunks, not lengthy, monolithic documentation that tries to explain everything in a long narrative.

A historian of technical communication, [[R. John Brockmann]], points out that Fred Bethke and others at IBM enunciated task orientation as a principle a decade earlier in a report on IBM Publishing Guidelines.

Carroll observes that modern users are often already familiar with much of what a typical long manual describes. What they need is information to solve a task at hand. He feels that documentation should encourage them to do this with a minimum of systematic instruction.

[[Darwin Information Typing Architecture]] (DITA) is built on Carroll's theories of Minimalism and Horn's theories of Information Mapping.

Minimalism is a large part of [[JoAnn Hackos]]' recent workshops and books on information development using structured writing and the DITA [[XML]] standard.

Good writing means that the message is directly clear to the projected audience. Adopting a minimalist method may appear, in the short-term, to cost more, as writers must cut up and rephrase content into single free-standing chunks. However, the longer-term brings cost-saving benefits, particularly in translation and localization, where often sum is on a ‘per word’ basis. But the greatest advantage for companies is user fulfillment. The less time a customer spends working out how to do something, the more likely they are to purchase again.

{{GeoGroup|article=Operation Hardtack I}}
'''Operation Hardtack I''' was a series of 35 nuclear tests conducted by the United States from April 28 to August 18 in 1958 at the [[Pacific Proving Grounds]].&lt;ref name=LT_1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CW_1/&gt;{{rp|212}} At the time of testing, the Operation Hardtack I test series included more nuclear detonations than all prior nuclear explosions in the Pacific Ocean put together.&lt;ref name=CW_2/&gt;{{rp|1}} These tests followed the ''[[Project 58/58A]]'' series, which occurred from 1957 December 6 to 1, 958, March 14, and preceded the [[Operation Argus]] series, which took place in 1958 from August 27 to September 6.&lt;ref name=CW_1/&gt;{{rp|212–4}}

Operation Hardtack I was directed by Joint Task Force 7 (JTF 7). JTF-7 was a collaboration between the military and many civilians, but was structured like a military organization. Its 19,100 personnel were composed of members of the US military, Federal civilian employees, as well as workers affiliated with the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DOD) and the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC).&lt;ref name=CW_2/&gt;{{rp|1}}

There were three main research directions. The first was the development of new types of nuclear weapons. This was undertaken by detonating experimental devices created by the AEC's Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory and the University of California Radiation Laboratory. The DOD performed experiments and tests on these detonations that did not hamper the AEC's research. The second research direction was to examine how underwater explosions affected materiel, especially Navy ships, and was performed by the DOD. The tests were named Wahoo (open ocean) and Umbrella (lagoon); the former was conducted in the open ocean whereas the latter in a lagoon.&lt;ref name=CW_2/&gt;{{rp|1}} The final avenue of study was to analyze high-altitude nuclear tests in order to refine the detection of high-altitude nuclear tests and investigate defensive practices for combatting ballistic missiles. This research direction was composed of three individual tests and were the first high altitude tests. The individual tests in the series were Orange, [[Hardtack Teak|Teak]], and Yucca. Orange and Teak were known collectively as Operation Newsreel and were rocket boosted. Yucca, however, reached its altitude by being raised by balloons.&lt;ref name=LT_1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CW_1/&gt;{{rp|187}}&lt;ref name=CW_2/&gt;{{rp|3}}

==Historical background==
Many events and proceedings leading up to Operation Hardtack I, such as previous nuclear testing results and the global political atmosphere, influenced its creation and design. One such historical circumstance was that nuclear radiation concerns were mounting publicly and abroad by 1956. During the [[United States presidential election, 1956|1956 Presidential Election]], ending nuclear testing was a campaign issue and nuclear safety was one part of that discussion. At the same time, the ''[[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]]'' (USSR) was publicly proposing a moratorium on testing.&lt;ref name=CW_1/&gt;{{rp|149}}

In 1956 during June, the [[National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) recommended new radiation exposure limits for the general public in a report entitled The Biological Effects of Atomic Radiation.&lt;ref name=CW_1/&gt;{{rp|153}} The AEC, which was the body that developed nuclear weapons,&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|3}} accepted the NAS recommended radiation exposure limits. Some AEC members asserted that the limits were reached incorrectly and should be reviewed in the future. Additionally, Charles L. Dunham, the AEC Director of the Division of Biology and Medicine (DBM) said that the new limits of nuclear radiation exposure would prevent them from continuing testing in Nevada. Dunham, in association with other AEC offices and officials, made recommendations to move further tests to the Pacific in order to eliminate the need to determine radiological fallout safety.&lt;ref name=CW_1/&gt;{{rp|154}}

Also in 1956, the AEC was designing a test series that included nuclear detonations which would release significant amounts of nuclear fallout. The series came to be known as [[Operation Plumbbob]] and took place in 1957 from April 24 to October 7. Operation Plumbbob was followed by Project 58/58A and Operation Hardtack I, respectively. At the time of testing, Operation Plumbbob was the most extensive nuclear test series held at the Nevada Test Site.&lt;ref name=CW_1/&gt;{{rp|159}} President [[Eisenhower]] was very cautious in approving Plumbbob due to public concern.&lt;ref name=CW_1/&gt;{{rp|157}} Consequently, the AEC held brief but fruitless discussions of moving some of the tests in the Plumbbob series to the next planned Pacific Ocean series, Operation Hardtack I, to minimize radioactive fallout in and around the Nevada Test Site.&lt;ref name=CW_1/&gt;{{rp|155}}

When Operation Plumbbob began in 1957 during the Spring, the planning process of Operation Hardtack I was well underway and the number of nuclear detonations planned were more than those in the Plumbbob series.&lt;ref name=CW_1/&gt;{{rp|183}} At the same time, radiation and nuclear proliferation concerns around the world had led to formal discussions between the US, USSR, and other countries on the topic of instituting a global ban on nuclear testing as a path to disarmament. In 1957 on August 9 AEC chairman [[Lewis L. Strauss]] proposed to President Eisenhower a preliminary plan of Operation Hardtack I. President Eisenhower objected to the length of the four month testing period and that the plan called for 25 shots,&lt;ref name=CW_1/&gt;{{rp|183}} which was one more than in Plumbbob.&lt;ref name=CW_1/&gt;{{rp|161}} As a result of the discussion Eisenhower consented to yields no larger than 15 Megatons, and ordered that the testing period be as brief as possible.&lt;ref name=CW_1/&gt;{{rp|183}}

Project 58/58A followed Operation Plumbbob and began almost two months later starting in 1957 on December 6. Project 58/58A was composed of four safety tests; they were not supposed to result in nuclear radiation. All four took place at the Nevada Test Site. The safety tests were intended to ensure that the bombs would not malfunction. However, the test named Coulomb-C which took place in 1957 on December 9 did malfunction. It resulted in an unanticipated 500 ton blast. The blast released a nuclear radiation fallout cloud that traveled toward Los Angeles and resulted in low levels of nuclear radiation. The bomb failure added to public concern over nuclear testing's safety.&lt;ref name=CW_1/&gt;{{rp|186}}

Some tests were cut in an effort to meet Eisenhower's demands for a shorter testing period, but new tests quickly filled their place. AEC chairman Strauss remarked that the large number of shots was due to the "DOD's requirement for an increasing number of different nuclear weapons types."&lt;ref name=CW_1/&gt;{{rp|187}} Eisenhower eventually approved the plan for Operation Hardtack I in late January, even though it still contained twenty-five shots. In 1958 on March 31, the USSR announced a suspension of all tests and called on the US to do the same. On May 9 the leader of the Soviet Union, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], accepted Eisenhower's invitation for technical discussions on a nuclear testing moratorium and negotiations began on July 1 of the same year. Eisenhower announced to the US in 1958 on August 22 that the ban would begin October 31. US scientists responded by seeking to add more tests to the Hardtack Series in case it turned out to be the last chance. Consequently, Operation Hardtack I came to consist of 35 tests.&lt;ref name=CW_1/&gt;{{rp|189–90}}

There was public health concern with the number of shots in Operation Hardtack I.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|23}} Furthermore, studies released in 1958 during March indicated that people as far as 400 miles (644 kilometers) away could have severe retinal burns from for two of the three high altitude tests, Teak and Orange.&lt;ref name=CW_1/&gt;{{rp|187}}&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|257}} It was then decided that they would be moved to [[Johnston Island]] which was 538 miles (866 kilometers) from the nearest inhabited island. The high-altitude nuclear tests delivered the first openly reported man-made high-altitude [[Nuclear electromagnetic pulse|electromagnetic pulses]] (EMP). Teak, which was detonated at 252,000 feet and was 3.8 megatons, produced an [[Aurora]] like effect that could be seen from [[Hawaii]], which was 700 nautical miles (806 miles, 1297 kilometers) displaced from the detonation. Most radio communications immediately dropped across the Pacific Ocean; the blackout in Australia lasted for 9 hours and Hawaii's lasted for no less than 2 hours.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|266–9}}

== High-altitude tests ==
{{see also|List of United States' nuclear weapons tests}}

Operation Hardtack I contained three high altitude tests that were designed to study many effects that a [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] explosion would have on materials and electronic systems. They were also used to test the energy of the explosion and what forms of energy they would produce. Yucca was the name of the first high-altitude test and it was performed near the [[Enewetak Atoll]] in the Marshall Islands. The other two high-altitude tests, Orange and Teak, were performed near the [[Johnston Atoll]] in the South Pacific Ocean about 1,300 kilometers South West of the Hawaiian Islands.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|251}}

=== Impact on ozone layer ===
There was some uncertainty on whether detonating a nuclear weapon at such high altitudes would cause a hole in the [[ozone layer]]. After multiple [[Underwater nuclear testing|underwater tests]] there was evidence to show the energy created by the blast would create [[ozone]]. Project leads determined some destruction of ozone would occur which would then be replaced by the ozone created from the explosion, it was agreed that if this theory were wrong, the hole created in the ozone layer would be minuscule enough to cause no harm. Upon completion of Operation Newsreel, it was determined that there was very little evidence of any harm being caused to the natural ozone layer.&lt;ref name=LT_215 /&gt;

=== Yucca ===
Yucca was the first high altitude test performed during Operation Hardtack I and was detonated on April 28, 1958. It was lifted by a balloon to an altitude of 86,000 feet (26.2&amp;nbsp;km) and had a yield of 1.7 [[TNT equivalent|kilotons]].&lt;ref name=CW_2/&gt;{{rp|2}}&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|251}}To achieve the altitude needed for detonation the device was attached to a large helium filled balloon which carried it to the detonation altitude. Due to issues with high winds on [[Enewetak Atoll|Enewetak]] Island the balloon launches from ground were unsatisfactory thus creating the need for a new method to be developed. The balloons were then deployed from an aircraft carrier which helped not only with deployment but also with inflation. While the balloons were inflated they were unable to take too much force from wind or the plastic material the balloons were made of would tear. While the balloons were inflating on the aircraft carrier, the ship could match and oppose the wind speed allowing for the balloon to be inflated in still air. To make sure the launch would be successful 86 balloon launches were tested.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|252}}

Due to concerns of failures, many safety measures were put into place. While on ground the bomb used multiple pins to keep certain safety features of the bomb from being deployed before liftoff could take place. One such pin was used to stop the electrical systems such that the bomb would be unable to be armed. In case of a dud the bomb would detach from the balloon and be allowed to drop into the ocean where many more safety features would come into action. Some of these features included probes which could detect saltwater which would destroy the electrical system so the conductive seawater could not cause a short which would detonate the bomb. Another worry was having a nuclear device floating in the ocean if a misfire did occur. To combat this inserts were created which would dissolve over a course of a few hours which would sink the device.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|253–4}}

On the day of the launch many [[Meteorology|meteorological]] aspects were taken into account and calculations were done to make sure the bomb would reach its correct altitude. The bomb was loaded onto an aircraft carrier and preparations began for the test fire. As the balloon was inflated on the aircraft carrier multiple testing devices were connected to the balloon. The readings from these devices would be sent to multiple ships and aircraft so nothing would have to be recovered after the explosion. After all the preparations were done and the balloon was inflated the device was released and began to climb. After almost three and a half hours of climbing the bomb was detonated at an altitude of 26.2 kilometers. The aircraft carrier which carried Yucca was around 45 kilometers from the detonation site when the explosion occurred. The shock wave from Yucca reached the carrier 3 minutes and 16 seconds after detonation.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|255–7}}

The Yucca test had many [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] projects attached to it for research purposes. Alongside testing the use of a balloon carrier the Department of Defense wanted to research the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] waves emitted from a nuclear explosion. This test would be used to see the impact a nuclear explosion would have on [[Electronics|electronic]] devices. All of the data from these Department of Defense projects would be stored on recording devices on surrounding islands and in aircraft so data would not have to be recovered after the test.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|253–4}} However, Yucca was carrying five different transmitting devices in canisters to help with research. While the balloon proved to be a great success, no data from the canisters were able to be retrieved due to equipment issues onboard one of the aircraft carriers.&lt;ref name=CW_4/&gt;{{rp|201}}

=== Teak ===
The [[Hardtack Teak|Teak]] test was launched from [[Johnston Island]] on July 31, 1958 and carried a payload of 3.8 [[TNT equivalent|megatons]].&lt;ref name=CW_2/&gt;{{rp|3}}&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|251}} Teak was the second high-altitude test after the success of Yucca. Instead of a balloon, the warhead for the Teak test would be carried by a missile. The [[Redstone missile]] which would carry Teak had been used to launch [[Explorer I]] in January of the same year.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|256–7}} Other nuclear weapons had been tested using the Redstone missile but up until this point the highest payload to have been detonated was 3 kilotons during [[Operation Teapot]].&lt;ref name=CW_4/&gt;{{rp|218}} Teak would be the first high altitude test to have a payload in the megaton range. The test was scheduled to take place from the [[Bikini Atoll]]. However, due to the fact that the payloads of Teak and Orange were much larger than previous high altitude shots the test was moved to Johnston Island as to protect nearby native islanders from any retinal damage. As both Teak and Orange had been relocated these two tests were named Operation Newsreel. The name Newsreel came from the fact that these two test were being moved to Johnston Island.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|259}}

The safety precautions taken by the teams involved in these tests were precisely detailed. The day before the launch 187 team members would evacuate Johnston Island with 727 men the day of the test. This was to keep as few men on the island while still being able to operate the airfield and critical data instruments. Another problem the team members were concerned about was the issue of retinal damage. Since the payload of the bomb was so large aircraft were scheduled to keep any civilian ships out of a 760 kilometer radius of Johnston Island. Additionally, the [[Civil Aeronautics Authority]] was informed that it would be dangerous for any aircraft to fly within 965 kilometers of Johnston Island. On the day of the test only about 175 men remained on Johnston Island to prepare for Teak to be launched and other various duties needed after.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|262–3}}

At 11:47 PM on July 31 Teak was launched and after 3 minutes was detonated. Due to programming issues, the warhead detonated directly above Johnston Island.&lt;ref name=CW_4/&gt;{{rp|219}} At time of detonation the rocket had flown to an altitude of 76.2 kilometers. The explosion could be seen from Hawaii 1,297 kilometers away and was said to be visible for almost half an hour. After the explosion, high frequency long distance communication was interrupted across the Pacific. Due to this communication failure Johnston Island was unable to contact their superiors in the US to let them know the results of the test until about eight hours after the detonation. Thirty minutes after detonation, a crew was sent out to collect the pod which had detached from the missile carrying the warhead. The pod had been [[Irradiation|irradiated]] and to handle it the crew members used disposable gloves in an attempt to protect themselves from [[beta radiation]].&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|265–70}}

During the Teak test all crew on and around Johnston Island were given protective eyewear to prevent [[flash blindness]] once the explosion took place. After the explosion it was found that besides the hazard of blindness, thermal radiation was another concern—even at an altitude of 76 kilometers. A crew member who was on Johnston Island at the time was said to have received a slight sunburn from the amount of thermal radiation which had reached the island. While only slight to the crew member it created issues for the local fauna. Many birds were seen on Johnston Island in distress. Unsure if this was caused by blindness or thermal radiation, the project members decided to take precautions to protect local wildlife during the Orange test.&lt;ref name=LT_215 /&gt;

===  Orange ===
Orange was launched twelve days after Teak on August 11, 1958.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|251}} Orange, like Teak, was launched using a Redstone Missile and had a yield of 3.8 megatons.&lt;ref name=CW_2/&gt;{{rp|3}}&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|271}} The same safety precautions used by Teak were implemented again for the Orange launch. Seeing how smoothly the evacuation for the Teak launch went it was decided that the evacuation did not need to occur the day before the launch and eight hundred and eight men were evacuated on August 11 to an aircraft carrier about 70 kilometers northeast of the island. Along with protection for the project crew, it was decided after Teak that Sand Island, a local bird refuge, would need protection from the blast as well. To make sure that most of the wildlife was safe a smoke screen was created over Sand Island. Due to interest in Hawaii, it was announced on August 11 that there would be a nuclear test sometime between 10 PM and 6 AM.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|271}}

The rocket carrying the warhead was launched at 11:27 from Johnston Island and traveled south. Like Teak, the flight lasted 3 minutes and was detonated at 11:30 PM about 41 kilometers south of Johnston Island at an altitude of about 43 kilometers.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|271}}The trajectory of Orange was a major success after the incident with Teak being detonated directly over the island.&lt;ref name=CW_4/&gt;{{rp|219}} The recovery crew for the pod that was with Orange was unable to locate the research pod which had been launched with the rocket. Although Orange was visible from Hawaii it was not as great of a spectacle as Teak had been. The light from the blast was only visible for about 5 minutes. The explosion had also been slightly obscured to the crew at Johnston Island from cloud coverage that night. The blast from Orange did not come with large communication interruption that Teak had caused, but some commercial flights to Hawaii were said to have lost contact with air traffic controllers for a short period of time.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|271}}

== Surface tests ==
Of the 35 nuclear tests in Operation Hardtack I, four were surface burst shots: Cactus, Koa, Quince and Fig. These tests took place from May to August 1958, all at the [[Enewetak Atoll]]. Surface tests inherently present the potential for more radioactive exposure issues than the high-altitude or underwater detonations. This is because there is more material present to be converted to radioactive debris by excess neutrons due to the proximity to the Earth's surface, and due to the soil and other minerals excavated from the craters created by these blasts. The existence of this extra material allows for larger radioactive particles to be created and lifted into the blast cloud, falling back to the surface as fallout.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|28}}Though surface and near-surface tests have a higher probability of radioactive exposure problems, the radioactive elements have significantly shorter residence times when injected into the atmosphere. As radioactive clouds from surface-type tests reach heights of around 20 kilometers at maximum, and thus cannot extend higher than the lower stratosphere, the residence times can be up to 13 years less than the [[High-altitude nuclear explosion|high-altitude]] blasts.&lt;ref name=LT_215 /&gt;{{rp|38}} During original concept planning in 1954, Enewetak was supposed to be the location of the smaller tests conducted during Operation Hardtack I. Due to poor weather conditions and policy changes in 1958, five of the [[UCRL]] tests which were planned to be conducted at the [[Bikini Atoll]] were moved to Enewetak. This included the later two surface blast devices in the Quince and Fig tests.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|149–87}}

=== Cactus ===
[[File:Operation_Hardtack_I_Cactus_shot_crater,_Runit_Island,_Enewetak_Atoll.jpg|thumb|Operation Hardtack I Cactus shot Crater on [[Runit Island]]]]
The Cactus test took place May 6, 1958 at approximately 0615. An 18 Kiloton land-surface type shot was detonated on a platform at the northern tip of [[Enewetak Atoll|Runit]], Enewetak in the second of the 35 tests for Operation Hardtack I.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|2}}The initial cloud from the explosion reached as high as 19,000 feet (5.8&amp;nbsp;km) within the first ten minutes, and settled at around 15,000 feet (4.6&amp;nbsp;km) by 20 minutes after detonation. The nuclear fallout prediction map proved to be accurate in determining the span and the intensity of the resultant fallout.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|149–87}}Measured peak intensity of fallout reached 440 R at hour three directly above blast site on the North end of the Atoll. At mid-island the radiation was measured to be 1.7 R. The southern tip received a very small amount of radiation, 0.005 R due to the easterly winds.

Out of the eight Programs listed, DOD-affiliated Projects 1.4, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.12, 2.8, 3.2, 5.2, 5.3, 6.4, 6.5 and 6.6 involved the Cactus test.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|149–87}}

One of the goals of this test was to study the physical characteristics of the crater and the surrounding area pre- and post-detonation associated with Project 1.4. A camera was mounted to a RB-50 aircraft and the resultant crater was mapped using photogrammetry. Measurements were taken from 500 feet (152 meters) down to ground zero for both pre- and post detonation. Survey measurements of the Cactus test could not be made until the resultant radiation amounts had lowered to safer levels.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|114–38}} Along with photogrammetric radial measurements, Airblast measurements were also recorded near surface zero for Cactus in accordance with Project 1.7. Similar to Project 1.8, Project 1.9 sought to determine transmission of blast pressure through the ground soil. Forty-three drums were buried at varying depths 600 feet (183 meters) from ground zero of the Cactus detonation. Individuals from the [[Air Force Ballistic Missile Division]] – TRW Space Technologies Laboratory sought to the Shock Spectra Studies of Project 1.12. Measurement gauges were located between 625 and 965 feet (191 to 294 meters) from the blast site. Fallout measurements and samples were taken by aircraft in the aftermath of the detonation, as part of Project 2.8. These surveys were designed in part to determine the impact of specific radionuclides to overall nuclear fallout. Samples were taken early post-blast using a new rocket sampler, the [[UCRL]], which were then followed by B-57D and [[Boeing B-50 Superfortress|WB-50]] aircraft. Between four and twenty-four hours post-detonation, the WB-50 collected several samples at 1,000 feet (305 meters) in altitude. Project 3.2 involved structural tests of corrugated steel arches. One of these arches was placed 980 feet (299 meters) away from the Cactus blast site. Eight days after the test, a crew of 13 men were allowed near the surface zero in order to extract the arch. The extraction took around twelve hours, and the radioactivity levels reached a maximum at 0.420 R/h during this time. Project 5.2 sought to determine the effects of the blast on two A4D-1 aircraft, both in thermal radiation and pressure. Nine film badges were placed throughout each aircraft in order to measure radiation. The Gamma [[dosimeter]] worn by the pilot in aircraft 827 indicated a neutron exposure level of 0.105 rem. There is not information available for the dosimeter worn by the pilot in aircraft 831. Radiation recorded by six of the nine film badges ranged from 0.49-1.74R. Information from the remaining three film badges, located at the Pilot's right leg, left sleeve, and left vest is not available. The pilot's exposures were both greater than 3R.  Project 5.3 was very similar to 5.2, focusing on the effects of the blast on the structure of two test [[North American FJ-4 Fury|FJ-4]] aircraft. Radiation from film badges on aircraft 467 ranged from 0.52-3.71 R, and 1.23-5.06 R for aircraft number 310. In Project 6.4, the Army Signal Research and Development Laboratory (SRDL) investigated the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] pulses post-detonation, utilizing two instruments, one at [[Wotho Atoll|Wotho]] (roughly 240 nautical miles from Enewetak) and one at Kusaie (around 440 nautical miles from Enewetak). Though Cactus is mentioned in Project 6.5, whose goal was to study the radar echoes from the fireball, it is not clear what destroyers were involved if any. Destroyers for the Teak, Fir and Yucca tests are explicitly stated. Project 6.6, the lasts of the projects that involved the Cactus test, sought to measure the physical properties of the stabilized radioactive cloud following the blast.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|114–38}}

=== Koa ===
At 0630 on May 13, the Koa surface device was detonated at the western side of Dridrilbwij. The size of the blast was 1.37 MT, around 76 times larger than the yield of the previous surface test, Cactus. The test was conducted in a large water tank. Within 17 minutes of the blast, surface clouds reached approximately 60,000 feet (18.3 kilometers). [[Nuclear fallout]] predictions for Koa were larger and covered a broader range than Cactus, with significantly higher radiation levels, an order of magnitude larger, in the immediate region surrounding the blast.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|44}} There had been a larger nuclear barge detonation, the 1.85 MT Apache test, off the island of Dridrilbwij two years prior in 1956, during which the island survived.&lt;ref&gt;Military Effects on Operation REDWING : AFSWP and Joint Task Force 7 : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive. (n.d.). Retrieved April 17, 2016, from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://archive.org/details/MilitaryEffectsonOperationRedwing1956&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The detonation of the Koa device, however, caused complete destruction of the island.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|44}}

The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DOD) sponsored a series of experiments for Koa: Projects 1.4, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.12, 2.9, 3.2, 3.6, 5.1, 5.3. 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.9. and 6.11.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|149–87}} Project 1.4, which sought to study land craters post detonation for several shots, took ground survey measurements from surface zero out to 2,500 feet (762 meters). Detailed measurements could not be made until four days after the blast due to radiation levels. Using a boat, the majority of the crater was mapped, though some measurements could not be made until 1959 due to radioactivity levels around the Koa blast site. In Project 1.9, the blast-induced pressure through the soil was measured by burying 43 drums at depths ranging from 0 to 20 feet and around 3,000 feet from the Koa blast site. The early radioactive cloud samples, normally collected post-shot as a part of Project 2.8 using a UCRL rocket sampler, were not collected after the Koa test due to technical difficulties. Fallout at high and low altitudes utilizing B-57D and WB-50 aircraft were measured with no technical problems. Project 3.6, which was conducted only on Koa, tested the effects of the blast on reinforced-concrete slabs buried close to surface zero. One station was located at 1,830 feet (558 meters) from the blast site, and the other was located 3,100 feet (945 meters) away. Project 5.2 was designed to measure the radiation levels using film badges on different areas of the aircraft and on the pilot directly. Koa had the lowest average radiation measurements of the eight shots on this project, with aircraft 827 ranging from 0.01-0.02R and aircraft 831 reporting levels between 0.03-0.19R. Unlike in the Cactus test, all nine film badges from both aircraft were successfully recovered and reported.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|114–38}}

=== Quince and Fig ===
Quince and Fig were a series of surface shots that occurred in early August at the center of [[Enewetak Atoll|Runit]]. They were the last of the Hardtack tests conducted at the Enewetak Atoll. Quince was detonated at 2:15pm on August 6, 1958. Twelve days later, the Fig device was detonated on August 18, 1958 at 4:00pm. Quince and Fig were UCRL devices with co-sponsorship through the [[United States Department of Defense|DOD]] and the AEC, though the main focus of these tests was weapons development. One of the main differences between these two tests was that over 130 tons of soil from the [[Nevada Test Site]] had been shipped in and was placed at surface zero of the Fig test. The radioactive cloud from the Quince blast rose to 1,500 feet (457 meters).  As Runit was to also be the detonation site for Fig, the area had to be decontaminated after the Quince test. Around three to five inches of contaminated topsoil was removed from an area 75 feet by 25 feet upwind of ground zero. An area of 60 square feet at the blast site was scraped to remove the top three inches of soil as well. Even with these precautions, the measured alpha activity was around 20,000 [[counts per minute]] (CPM), and the area closest to surface zero was roped off to prevent personnel from entering. Upon detonation, the mushroom cloud produced by the Fig device rose to approximately 6,000 feet (1.8 kilometers), with a base of roughly 4,300 feet (1.3 kilometers). 30 minutes post detonation, radiation measurements at the blast site reached over 10,000 R/hr.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|219–22}}

The DOD experiments for Quince and Fig included Projects 1.4, 1.7. 2.4, 2.9, 2.10, 2.11, 2.14. and 8.7.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|219–22}}

== Barge tests ==
Barge mounted test detonations was a technique first used in 1954, and also compensated for the lack of land at the HP. When testing returned to [[Bikini Atoll|Bikini atoll]] the use of barges as the shot point had begun, with one notable advantage, no radioactive surface zero areas were developed. Two large underwater craters were formed in 1954 and these were used as subsequent surface zeros for detonations fired from barges. This allowed the available land area to be used for the placement of measurement instrumentation and reuse of the same burst point without the long delays required for radiological cooling by natural decay or expensive and long decontamination procedures. Reuse of zero points also allowed reuse of instrument locations and recording shelters for several tests saving construction costs and time and Increasing test-scheduling flexibility. In HARDTACK the 26 barge events used only five detonation areas.&lt;ref name=CW_2/&gt;&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;

== Underwater tests ==
Underwater tests were conducted to assess the damages to Navy boats and materials. The location for these tests was Enewetak due to the uniformity of the sea bottom in the area. This is critical for the tests so that proper moorings of the target ships can be secured on the sea floor. The underwater explosions create a bubble from the expended energy of the blast. This bubble is due to the vaporization of water that directly absorbs the heat of the blast. This bubble may break the surface depending on how much energy is dispersed and the depth of the nuclear device. The bubble displaces large amounts of water that then collapses in on the bubble after all the energy is expended. The water collapsing in on the cavity is called the "radioactive pool" and has the highest concentration of radioactive material.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|28–9}}

Many different projects were put in place to test the two underwater blasts. Wave generation, hydrodynamic variables, and energy released were all studied using multiple sensors. These sensors were placed in multiple areas such as target ships and floating balloons. Oceanographic, seismographic and hydrographic surveys were completed after each nuclear blast. A project that used a nuclear blast to clear minefields was studied using the Umbrella blast. 120 inert mines were placed at different distances ranging from 1,500 feet to 8,000. These mines were then picked out of the water to study the effects of the blast at each interval.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|111–49}}

=== Radiation preparations ===
Another reason for the underwater tests was to detect the radiation contamination of the ships after an underwater nuclear explosion. This meant that the contaminated ships required unique "radsafe" preparations so that the data could be quickly accounted for. After the data on the damage and radiation was recorded, the ships needed decontamination work completed before repairs could be completed. The Radiological and Decontamination Unit consisting of 200 enlisted and one officer was created for the task of decontamination.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|70–86}} After decontamination, the target ships were repaired for use in a second underwater nuclear weapons test. The amount of radiation exposure was debated for the safety of the crews. Roentgens (R) were used to gauge the gamma radiation that affected the units working on the nuclear tests. 

For the underwater test crew, a limit of 5 R per blast along with 10 R per operation was referenced as the limit for exposure. These initial limits were rejected and maximum permissible exposure standards (MPE) were solidified by commanders for the crews working on the decontamination unit. Due to the fast recovery of ships, high contamination values were expected by commanders and set the standard to four roentgens per hour (R/hr). An excess of 4 R/hr was designated off limits of recovery units. Personnel were given special breathing equipment to work in the interior of ships with an R/hr higher than one. High numbers of personnel working the tests were used to keep individuals within the MPE. Times were calculated to keep the total exposure below two roentgens for the personnel working on the ships. A floating decontamination facility was created on board a transport ship for the Wahoo and Umbrella nuclear tests. This allowed important data analysis and an increase in recovery efficiency.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|70–86}}

=== Wahoo preparation ===

The nuclear explosion was carried out in open ocean outside of Enewetak. This nuclear test codenamed Wahoo was the first underwater test in the Operation Hardtack series. This test could be considered a continuation of the Wigwam nuclear blast (a deep water nuclear test 500 nautical miles off the coast of San Diego).&lt;ref name=LT_6/&gt; Like its predecessor, the Wahoo shot was a scientific program that studied the effects of an underwater nuclear blast on Navy systems. The nuclear device was positioned {{convert|500|feet}} deep in the Pacific Ocean. This deep water test required precise targeting arrays to be set up around the blast location, which presented unique problems for the arrays as the winds, sea currents and tides needed to be within certain limits for the data to be accurate. Testing arrays were placed at depths of 400 to 800 fathoms (2400 to 4800 feet, 732 to 1463 metres) around the nuclear device. The deep water mooring systems needed for the test proved to be difficult to position, leading many analysts to believe the data skewed. The target ships to be used for this program consisted of three destroyers, an active submarine, a submarine mockup used in Wigwam tests, and a merchant marine ship.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|225}} It was predicted that no air blast or thermal effects would be presented from the underwater blast. The fallout from the blast was also predicted to stay within the target array due to the southwest surface winds.

=== Wahoo blast ===
The test conditions were met on May 16 allowing for the nuclear device to be detonated. Within a second of detonation, a spray dome was created that reached a height of 840 feet after seven seconds. The overall shape of the spray dome resembled a cone with 45 degree sloped sides. Plumes were seen breaking through the spray dome after six seconds in every direction. The vertical plume continued rising until 12 seconds after the blast while the lateral plumes traveled for 20 seconds before collapsing. The diameter of the spray dome was approximately 3,800 feet at the 20 second mark.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|237}} The base surge reached a radius of 8,000 feet in the downwind direction after 1.7 seconds. The downwind surge aided by a 15 knot wind reached speeds of 21 knots (24.2&amp;nbsp;mph). This base surge could be seen for three and a half minutes and for longer from the air as it continued to move across the ocean. When the spray dome and base surge had dissipated, a foam patch could be seen spreading from the surface zero water to reach over {{convert|6,000|feet}}.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|238}} The nuclear blast was calculated to be nine kilotons.  All fallout stayed within the predicted fallout area with a maximum of 0.030 R/hr. The target ship at {{convert|5,900| yard}} was directly hit by the shockwave, vibrating the entire ship and shaking it violently. The Moran merchant marine ship moored at 2,346 feet away was immobilized due to shock damage to its main and auxiliary equipment while also attaining minor hull damage. One hour and ten minutes after detonation, a five-gallon water sample was taken directly above the blast location showing 5 R/hr. The retrieval team entered a 3.8 R/hr field after an hour and thirty five minutes.

=== Umbrella preparation ===
The second underwater explosion of the Operation Hardtack series was code-named Umbrella. This test was conducted in the lagoon inside Enewetak. This test could be considered a continuation of underwater test Baker, which was conducted in Bikini Lagoon. Explosions in shallow water can create an underwater crater if close enough to the bottom. The target ships from the Wahoo test were towed into the lagoon to be used again for the Umbrella test. The damage from Wahoo was minor in all cases with the exception of the Moran which required extra refurbishing of the hull. These ships had to be washed down and have the measuring equipment replaced before being put into use. The mooring for Umbrella was considerably easier than for Wahoo due to the location and depth of the lagoon. Information gathered from the Wahoo shot directly affected the Umbrella plans with regard to target array placement and decontamination times. The device was placed with a buoy at a depth of 150 feet.&lt;ref name=LT_6/&gt;

=== Umbrella blast ===
June 9 saw the second underwater nuclear test of the Hardtack I series. The detonation occurred at 1115 with clear skies and a 15 to 17 knot wind from the east-northeast. Within one-tenth of a second, the spray dome had broken through the surface. The overall shape of the spray dome resembled a vertical column with the plumes helping create the shape. Within 20 seconds of detonation the maximum height of the column reached 5,000 feet. The base surge reached a distance around 10,000 feet downwind, reaching out approximately 6,000 feet in all directions. This base surge could be seen from the air for about 25 minutes and the foam patch over the blast location lasting even longer.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|248}} The blast yield of the nuclear device was measured to be eight kilotons. The Umbrella blast created a crater 3,000 feet (914 m) in diameter and 20 feet (6 m) in depth in the lagoon. The maximum radiation reading was found to be 0.350 R/hr by an aircraft flying over the blast location. Radiation was reported to be of small portions, and re-entry was granted 30 minutes after detonation. Out of the major target ships, the highest radiation reading was logged at 0.0015 R/hr of the stern of the Moran. After all scientific data had been gathered from the target ships, they were restored to be seaworthy and towed back to Pearl Harbor. The Moran was concluded to be unseaworthy due to the blast and was sunk by naval gunfire near Ikuren Island.&lt;ref name=CW_3/&gt;{{rp|251}}

The underwater nuclear tests (Wahoo and Umbrella) gathered scientific data that helped the Department of Defense understand the effects of nuclear weapons on Navy ships. Some of the key points found were that underwater nuclear blasts create less fallout due to the absorption of radioactive material in the water and vaporized droplets.(76) Direct gamma radiation was found to be extremely low, but the base surge was found to be highly radioactive as it passed measurement devices. Smaller radiation concentrations followed in waves mimicking the initial base surge. Almost all free-field radiation activity was found to disappear after fifteen minutes allowing for return to normal operations.&lt;ref name=CW_4/&gt;{{rp|86}} The impact of shock waves was less than previously expected. The damage from the shockwave was found to be negligible on the destroyers at the ranges tested, but equipment failure from the blast could immobilize the ships. The preliminary tests of explosive tapered charges were proven to simulate the shock waves of a nuclear device according to the data gathered.&lt;ref name=CW_4/&gt;{{rp|91}}

The '''Radioactive Substances Act 1993''' (RSA93) deals with the control of [[radioactive material]] and [[High-level radioactive waste management|disposal of radioactive waste]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

On 6 April 2010 the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations
2010&lt;ref&gt;{{UK SI|year=2010|number=675|title=Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; came into force. These new regulations repeal, amend and replace much of Radioactive Substances Act 1993 in England and Wales.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1021">'''Rotational modulation collimators''' (or RMCs) are a specialization of the [[modulation collimator]], an imaging device invented by [[Minoru Oda]]. Devices of this type create images of high energy [[X-ray]]s (or other radiations that cast shadows).  Since high energy X-rays are not easily focused, such optics have found applications in various instruments.  RMCs selectively block and unblock X-rays in a way which depends on their incoming direction, converting image information into time variations. Various mathematical transformations can then reconstitute the image of the source.

The [[Small Astronomy Satellite 3]], launched in 1975, was one orbiting experiment that used RMCs. A more recent satellite that used RMCs was
[[RHESSI]].

The '''Spitzer Space Telescope''' ('''SST'''), formerly the '''Space Infrared Telescope Facility''' ('''SIRTF'''), is an [[infrared]] [[space telescope]] launched in 2003 and still operating as of 2018. It is the fourth and final of the [[NASA]] [[Great Observatories program]].

The planned mission period was to be 2.5 years with a pre-launch expectation that the mission could extend to five or slightly more years until the onboard [[liquid helium]] supply was exhausted. This occurred on 15 May 2009.&lt;ref name="nasa20090515"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/news/436-ssc2009-12-NASA-s-Spitzer-Begins-Warm-Mission |title=NASA's Spitzer Begins Warm Mission |publisher=NASA/Caltech |first=Whitney |last=Clavin |date=15 May 2009 |accessdate=26 April 2015 |id=ssc2009-12, jpl2009-086}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without liquid helium to cool the telescope to the very low temperatures needed to operate, most of the instruments are no longer usable. However, the two shortest-wavelength modules of the [[#Instruments|IRAC]] camera are still operable with the same sensitivity as before the [[cryogen]] was exhausted, and have continued to be used to the present in the '''Spitzer Warm Mission'''.&lt;ref name="cycle6"&gt;{{cite web |author=Spitzer Science Center |title=Cycle-6 Warm Mission |publisher=NASA / JPL |url=http://sohelp2.ipac.caltech.edu/support/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&amp;_a=view&amp;parentcategoryid=8&amp;nav=0 |accessdate=16 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704070443/http://sohelp2.ipac.caltech.edu/support/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&amp;_a=view&amp;parentcategoryid=8&amp;nav=0 |archivedate=4 July 2010 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; All ''Spitzer'' data, from both the primary and warm phases, are archived at the [[Infrared Science Archive]] (IRSA).

In keeping with NASA tradition, the telescope was renamed after its successful demonstration of operation, on 18 December 2003. Unlike most [[telescope]]s that are named after famous deceased astronomers by a board of scientists, the new name for SIRTF was obtained from a contest open to the general public.

The contest led to the telescope being named in honor of astronomer [[Lyman Spitzer]], who had promoted the concept of space telescopes in the 1940s.&lt;ref name="spitzer_bio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/postsecondary/features/F_Lyman_Spitzer.html |title=Who was Lyman Spitzer? |accessdate=6 January 2009 |work=Nasa: For Educators |publisher=California Institute of Technology and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory |date=11 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spitzer wrote a 1946 report for [[RAND Corporation]] describing the advantages of an extraterrestrial observatory and how it could be realized with available or upcoming technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Carolyn Collins Petersen |author2=John C.

== History ==
By the early 1970s, astronomers began to consider the possibility of placing an [[infrared telescope]] above the obscuring effects of Earth's atmosphere.
In 1979, a report from the National Research Council of the [[National Academy of Sciences]], ''A Strategy for Space Astronomy and Astrophysics for the 1980s'', identified a Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) as "one of two major astrophysics facilities [to be developed] for [[Spacelab]]", a Shuttle-borne platform. Anticipating the major results from an upcoming Explorer satellite and from the Shuttle mission, the report also favored the "study and development of ... long-duration spaceflights of infrared telescopes cooled to cryogenic temperatures."

The launch in January 1983 of the [[IRAS|Infrared Astronomical Satellite]], jointly developed by the United States, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, to conduct the first infrared survey of the sky, whetted the appetites of scientists worldwide for follow-up space missions capitalizing on the rapid improvements in infrared detector technology.

Earlier infrared observations had been made by both space-based and ground-based [[observatory|observatories]]. Ground-based observatories have the drawback that at infrared [[wavelength]]s or [[frequency|frequencies]], both the Earth's [[earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] and the telescope itself will radiate (glow) strongly. Additionally, the atmosphere is opaque at most infrared wavelengths. This necessitates lengthy exposure times and greatly decreases the ability to detect faint objects. It could be compared to trying to observe the stars at noon. Previous space observatories (such as [[IRAS]], the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, and [[Infrared Space Observatory|ISO]], the Infrared Space Observatory) were launched during the 1980s and 1990s and great advances in astronomical technology have been made since then.

Most of the early concepts envisioned repeated flights aboard the NASA Space Shuttle. This approach was developed in an era when the Shuttle program was expected to support weekly flights of up to 30 days duration. A May 1983 NASA proposal described SIRTF as a Shuttle-attached mission, with an evolving scientific instrument payload. Several flights were anticipated with a probable transition into a more extended mode of operation, possibly in association with a future space platform or space station. SIRTF would be a 1-meter class, cryogenically cooled, multi-user facility consisting of a telescope and associated focal plane instruments. It would be launched on the Space Shuttle and remain attached to the Shuttle as a Spacelab payload during astronomical observations, after which it would be returned to Earth for refurbishment prior to re-flight. The first flight was expected to occur about 1990, with the succeeding flights anticipated beginning approximately one year later. However, the Spacelab-2 flight aboard [[STS-51-F]] showed that the Shuttle environment was poorly suited to an onboard infrared telescope due to contamination from the relatively "dirty" vacuum associated with the orbiters. By September 1983 NASA was considering the "possibility of a long duration [free-flyer] SIRTF mission".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/spitzer/infrared/index.html |title=Studying the Universe in Infrared |accessdate=8 December 2007 |last=Watanabe |first=Susan |date=22 November 2007 |publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kwok |first=Johnny |title=Finding a Way: The Spitzer Space Telescope Story |work=Academy Sharing Knowledge |publisher=NASA |url=http://appel.nasa.gov/ask/issues/25/25s_finding.php |date=Fall 2006 |accessdate=9 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070908000438/http://appel.nasa.gov/ask/issues/25/25s_finding.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=8 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Spitzer'' is the only one of the [[Great Observatories]] not launched by the [[Space Shuttle]], as was originally intended. However, after the 1986 [[STS-51-L|Challenger disaster]], the [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]] [[LH2]]–[[LOX]] upper stage, which would have been required to place it in its final orbit, was banned from Shuttle use. The mission underwent a series of redesigns during the 1990s, primarily due to budget considerations. This resulted in a much smaller but still fully capable mission that could use the smaller Delta II expendable launch vehicle.

One of the most important advances of this redesign was an Earth-trailing orbit. Cryogenic satellites that require liquid helium (LHe, T ≈ 4 K) temperatures in near-Earth orbit are typically exposed to a large heat load from the Earth, and consequently require large amounts of LHe coolant, which then tends to dominate the total payload mass and limits mission life. Placing the satellite in solar orbit far from Earth allowed innovative passive cooling such as the sun shield, against the single remaining major heat source to drastically reduce the total mass of helium needed, resulting in an overall smaller lighter payload, with major cost savings. This orbit also simplifies telescope pointing, but does require the [[NASA Deep Space Network]] for communications.

The primary instrument package (telescope and cryogenic chamber) was developed by [[Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies]], in [[Boulder, Colorado]]. The individual instruments were developed jointly by industrial, academic, and government institutions, the principals being Cornell, the University of Arizona, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Ball Aerospace, and Goddard Spaceflight Center. The shorter-wavelength infrared detectors were developed by Raytheon in Goleta, California. Raytheon used indium antimonide and a doped silicon detector in the creation of the infrared detectors. It is stated that these detectors are 100 times more sensitive than what was once available in the beginning of the project during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://investor.raytheon.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=84193&amp;p=irol-newsArticle_Print&amp;ID=483065&amp;highlight= Raytheon Company : Investor Relations : News Release]. Investor.raytheon.com (8 January 2004). Retrieved on 21 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The far-IR detectors (70 - 160 micrometers) were developed jointly by the University of Arizona and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory using Gallium-doped Germanium. The spacecraft was built by [[Lockheed Martin]]. The mission is operated and managed by the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] and the ''Spitzer Science Center'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/ Spitzer Science Center Home Page -- Public information].&lt;/ref&gt; located on the [[Caltech]] campus in Pasadena, California.

''Spitzer'' ran out of liquid helium coolant on 15 May 2009, which stopped far-IR observations. Only the IRAC instrument remains in use, and only at the two shorter wavelength bands (3.6&amp;nbsp;µm and 4.5&amp;nbsp;µm). The telescope equilibrium temperature is now around {{convert|30|K|C F|0|abbr=on}}, and IRAC continues to produce valuable images at those wavelengths as the "Spitzer Warm Mission".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/spitzer/news/spitzer-20090805.html |title=NASA's Spitzer Sees the Cosmos Through 'Warm' Infrared Eyes |publisher=NASA |first1=Whitney B. |last1=Clavin |first2=J.

The first images taken by SST were designed to show off the abilities of the telescope and showed a glowing stellar nursery; a big swirling, dusty [[galaxy]]; a disc of planet-forming debris; and organic material in the distant universe. Since then, many monthly press releases have highlighted ''Spitzer''{{'s}} capabilities, as the NASA and [[ESA]] images do for the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].

As one of its most noteworthy observations, in 2005, SST became the first telescope to directly capture light from [[exoplanet]]s, namely the "hot Jupiters" [[HD 209458 b]] and [[TrES-1b]], although it did not resolve that light into actual images.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/news/189-ssc2005-09-NASA-s-Spitzer-Marks-Beginning-of-New-Age-of-Planetary-Science Press Release: NASA's Spitzer Marks Beginning of New Age of Planetary Science].&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time extrasolar planets had actually been visually seen; earlier observations had been indirectly made by drawing conclusions from behaviors of the stars the planets were orbiting. The telescope also discovered in April 2005 that [[Cohen-kuhi Tau/4]] had a planetary disk that was vastly younger and contained less mass than previously theorized, leading to new understandings of how planets are formed.

[[File:Comets Kick up Dust in Helix Nebula (PIA09178).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Helix Nebula]]. Blue shows infrared light of 3.6 to 4.5 micrometers; green shows infrared light of 5.8 to 8 micrometers; and red shows infrared light of 24 micrometers.]]

While some time on the telescope is reserved for participating institutions and crucial projects, astronomers around the world also have the opportunity to submit proposals for observing time. Important targets include forming stars ([[young stellar object]]s, or YSOs), planets, and other galaxies. Images are freely available for educational and journalistic purposes.

In 2004, it was reported that ''Spitzer'' had spotted a faintly glowing body that may be the youngest star ever seen. The telescope was trained on a core of gas and dust known as [[L1014]] which had previously appeared completely dark to ground-based observatories and to ISO ([[Infrared Space Observatory]]), a predecessor to ''Spitzer''. The advanced technology of ''Spitzer'' revealed a bright red hot spot in the middle of L1014.

Scientists from the [[University of Texas at Austin]], who discovered the object, believe the hot spot to be an example of early star development, with the young star collecting gas and dust from the cloud around it. Early speculation about the hot spot was that it might have been the faint light of another core that lies 10 times further from Earth but along the same line of sight as L1014. Follow-up observation from ground-based near-infrared observatories detected a faint fan-shaped glow in the same location as the object found by ''Spitzer''. That glow is too feeble to have come from the more distant core, leading to the conclusion that the object is located within L1014. (Young ''et al.'', 2004)

In 2005, astronomers from the [[University of Wisconsin System|University of Wisconsin]] at [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|Madison]] and [[University of Wisconsin–Whitewater|Whitewater]] determined, on the basis of 400 hours of observation on the Spitzer Space Telescope, that the [[Milky Way]] galaxy has a more substantial [[barred spiral galaxy|bar structure]] across its core than previously recognized.

Also in 2005, astronomers [[Alexander Kashlinsky]] and [[John C. Mather|John Mather]] of NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] reported that one of ''Spitzer''{{'s}} earliest images may have captured the light of the first stars in the universe. An image of a [[quasar]] in the [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]] [[constellation]], intended only to help [[calibrate]] the telescope, was found to contain an infrared glow after the light of known objects was removed. Kashlinsky and Mather are convinced that the numerous blobs in this glow are the light of stars that formed as early as 100 million years after the [[Big Bang]], [[redshift]]ed by [[cosmic expansion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa007&amp;articleID=0009A468-3F5E-1369-BF5E83414B7F0000 Infrared Glow of First Stars Found: Scientific American] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010052138/http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa007&amp;articleID=0009A468-3F5E-1369-BF5E83414B7F0000 |date=10 October 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006, astronomers reported an {{convert|80|ly|pc|lk=on|adj=mid|long}} nebula near the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, the [[Double Helix Nebula]], which is, as the name implies, twisted into a double spiral shape. This is thought to be evidence of massive magnetic fields generated by the gas disc orbiting the [[supermassive black hole]] at the galaxy's center, {{convert|300|ly|pc}} from the nebula and {{convert|25000|ly|pc}} from Earth. This nebula was discovered by ''Spitzer'' and published in the magazine ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' on 16 March 2006.

In May 2007, astronomers successfully mapped the atmospheric temperature of [[HD 189733 b]], thus obtaining the first map of some kind of an extrasolar planet.

Since September 2006 the telescope participates in a series of surveys called the [[Gould Belt Survey]], observing the [[Gould Belt|Gould's Belt]] region in multiple wavelengths. The first set of observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope were completed from 21 September 2006 through 27 September. Resulting from these observations, the team of astronomers led by Dr. Robert Gutermuth, of the [[Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]] reported the discovery of [[Serpens south|Serpens South]], a cluster of 50 young stars in the [[Serpens]] constellation.

Scientists have long wondered how tiny silicate crystals, which need high temperatures to form, have found their way into frozen comets, born in the very cold environment of the Solar System's outer edges. The crystals would have begun as non-crystallized, amorphous silicate particles, part of the mix of gas and dust from which the Solar System developed. This mystery has deepened with the results of the ''[[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]]'' sample return mission, which captured particles from Comet [[Wild 2]]. Many of the Stardust particles were found to have formed at temperatures in excess of 1000 K.

In May 2009, ''Spitzer'' researchers from Germany, Hungary and the Netherlands found that amorphous silicate appears to have been transformed into crystalline form by an outburst from a star. They detected the infrared signature of [[forsterite]] silicate crystals on the disk of dust and gas surrounding the star EX Lupi during one of its frequent flare-ups, or outbursts, seen by ''Spitzer'' in April 2008. These crystals were not present in ''Spitzer''{{'s}} previous observations of the star's disk during one of its quiet periods. These crystals appear to have formed by radiative heating of the dust within 0.5 AU of EX Lupi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2009-083 JPL News | Spitzer Catches Star Cooking Up Comet Crystals]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ábrahám |first=P. |display-authors=etal |title=Episodic formation of cometary material in the outburst of a young Sun-like star |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v459/n7244/full/nature08004.html |date=14 May 2009 |doi=10.1038/nature08004 |bibcode=2009Natur.459..224A |volume=459 |issue=7244 |pages=224–226 |arxiv=0906.3161 |pmid=19444209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, the telescope found evidence of a high-speed collision between two burgeoning planets orbiting a young star.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8195467.stm BBC NEWS | Science &amp; Environment | Traces of planet collision found]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, astronomers Anne J. Verbiscer, Michael F. Skrutskie, and Douglas P. Hamilton published findings of the "[[Phoebe ring]]" of [[Saturn]], which was found with the telescope; the ring is a huge, tenuous disc of material extending from 128 to 207 times the radius of Saturn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Verbiscer |first=Anne |author2=Michael Skrutskie |author3=Douglas Hamilton |title=Saturn's largest ring |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/pdf/nature08515.pdf |date=7 October 2009 |doi=10.1038/nature08515 |pmid=19812546 |bibcode=2009Natur.461.1098V |volume=461 |issue=7267 |pages=1098–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== GLIMPSE and MIPSGAL surveys ===

GLIMPSE, the ''Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire'', is a survey spanning 300° of the inner Milky Way galaxy. It consists of approximately 444,000 images taken at four separate wavelengths using the Infrared Array Camera.&lt;ref name="glimpse"&gt;[http://www.astro.wisc.edu/sirtf/ Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire], University of Wisconsin–Madison Department of Astronomy&lt;/ref&gt;

MIPSGAL is a similar survey covering 278° of the galactic disk at longer wavelengths.

On 3 June 2008, scientists unveiled the largest, most detailed infra-red portrait of the [[Milky Way]], created by stitching together more than 800,000 snapshots, at the 212th meeting of the [[American Astronomical Society]] in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://legacy.spitzer.caltech.edu/Media/releases/ssc2008-11/release.shtml Press Release: Spitzer Captures Stellar Coming of Age in Our Galaxy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://legacy.spitzer.caltech.edu/Media/releases/ssc2008-11/visuals.shtml Released Images and Videos of Milky Way Mosaic]&lt;/ref&gt; This composite survey is now viewable with the GLIMPSE/MIPSGAL Viewer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alienearths.org/glimpse/glimpse.php GLIMPSE/MIPSGAL Viewer]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Protostar HOPS-68 in Orion (ssc2011-06c1).jpg|thumb|An arrow points to the embryonic star HOPS-68, where scientists believe [[forsterite]] crystals are raining down onto the central dust disk.]]

''Spitzer'' observations, announced in May 2011, indicate that tiny [[forsterite]] crystals might be falling down like rain on to the [[protostar]] HOPS-68. The discovery of the forsterite crystals in the outer collapsing cloud of the protostar is surprising, because the crystals form at lava-like high temperatures, yet they are found in the molecular cloud where the temperatures are about {{convert|-170|C|K F}}. This led the team of astronomers to speculate that the [[bipolar outflow]] from the young star may be transporting the forsterite crystals from near the star's surface to the chilly outer cloud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/spitzer/news/spitzer20110526_prt.htm NASA Mission News | Spitzer Sees Crystal Rain in Infant Star Outer Clouds]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Poteet |first=C.

In January 2012, it was reported that further analysis of the ''Spitzer'' observations of EX Lupi can be understood if the forsterite crystalline dust was moving away from the protostar at a remarkable average speed of {{convert|38|km/s|mi/s}}. It would appear that such high speeds can arise only if the dust grains had been ejected by a bipolar outflow close to the star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Juhász |first=A. |display-authors=etal |title=The 2008 Outburst of EX Lup—Silicate Crystals in Motion |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |date=January 2012 |doi=10.1088/0004-637X/744/2/118 |bibcode=2012ApJ...744..118J |volume=744 |issue=2 |page=118 |arxiv=1110.3754}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such observations are consistent with an astrophysical theory, developed in the early 1990s, where it was suggested that bipolar outflows garden or transform the disks of gas and dust that surround protostars by continually ejecting reprocessed, highly heated material from the inner disk, adjacent to the protostar, to regions of the accretion disk further away from the protostar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Liffman |first=K. |last2=Brown |first2=M. |title=The motion and size sorting of particles ejected from a protostellar accretion disk |journal=[[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]] |date=October 1995 |doi=10.1006/icar.1995.1126 |bibcode=1995Icar..116..275L |volume=116 |issue=2 |pages=275–290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, ''Spitzer'' and the [[Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment]] were reported as co-discovering one of the most distant planets ever identified: a gas giant about {{convert|13000|ly|pc}} away from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.space.com/29120-alien-planet-among-farthest-known.html |title=Newfound Alien Planet Is One of the Farthest Ever Detected |work=Space.com |first=Elizabeth |last=Howell |date=16 April 2015 |accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June and July 2015, the [[brown dwarf]] {{nowrap|OGLE-2015-BLG-1319}} was discovered using the [[gravitational microlensing]] detection method in a joint effort between ''[[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission|Swift]]'', ''Spitzer'', and the ground-based [[Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment]], the first time two space telescopes have observed the same microlensing event. This method was possible because of the large separation between the two spacecraft: ''Swift'' is in low-Earth orbit while ''Spitzer'' is more than one [[astronomical unit|AU]] distant in an Earth-trailing heliocentric orbit. This separation provided significantly different perspectives of the brown dwarf, allowing for constraints to be placed on some of the object's physical characteristics.&lt;ref name="nasa20161110"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6673 |title=NASA Space Telescopes Pinpoint Elusive Brown Dwarf |publisher=NASA{{\}}Jet Propulsion Laboratory |first=Elizabeth |last=Landau |date=10 November 2016 |accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spitzer Beyond ===
On 1 October 2016, ''Spitzer'' began its Observation Cycle 13, a {{frac|2|1|2}} year extended mission nicknamed ''Beyond''. One of the goals of this extended mission is to help prepare for the [[James Webb Space Telescope]], also an infrared telescope, by identifying candidates for more detailed observations.&lt;ref name="nasa20160825" /&gt;

Another aspect of the ''Beyond'' mission are the engineering challenges of operating ''Spitzer'' in its progressing orbital phase. As the spacecraft moves farther from Earth on the same orbital path from the Sun, its antenna must point at increasingly higher angles to communicate with ground stations; this change in angle imparts more and more solar heating on the vehicle while its solar panels receive less sunlight.&lt;ref name="nasa20160825" /&gt;

''Spitzer'' has been put to work studying exoplanets thanks to creatively tweaking its hardware. This included doubling its stability by modifying its heating cycle, finding a new use for the "peak-up" camera, and analyzing the sensor at a sub-pixel level.

'''''The Control of Nature''''' is a 1989 book by [[John McPhee]] that chronicles three attempts (with varying success) to control natural processes. It is divided into three long essays, "Atchafalaya", "Cooling the Lava", and "Los Angeles Against the Mountains".  The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] prevents the [[Mississippi River]] from changing course, but has had less success in controlling flooding along the river. The residents of [[Heimaey]], [[Iceland]] saved their harbor by spraying water on the volcanic [[lava flow]] threatening to close it off. The residents of the [[San Gabriel Mountains]] have had little success in preventing [[debris flow]]s from destroying their houses.

==Background==
In 1980, McPhee traveled with his daughter on a canoe trip on the [[Atchafalaya River]] due to her fascination with the novelist [[Walker Percy]]. He had conversations with natives about the efforts made by the Army Corps of Engineers in monitoring riverflow in the area. In [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]], a man recommended to McPhee that he research the efforts being undergone to control the debris sliding down from mountains into [[Los Angeles]]. When he visited California, a geologist informed him about lava in Iceland.&lt;ref name=Nyt/&gt;

The book's title is derived from a sign on the engineering building at the [[University of Wyoming]]. Though he believes nature will win, "my book is not an editorial," McPhee said. "It is a description of people defying nature. They may have no choice."&lt;ref name=Nyt&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pyne|first1=Stephen|title=A War Against the World|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/07/05/specials/mcphee-control.html|website=[[New York Times]]|date=6 August 1989|accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like all of McPhee's books, ''The Control of Nature'' started out as an outline that he proceeded to fill in.&lt;ref name=normansims&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sims|first1=Norman|title=John McPhee|url=http://normansims.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/John-McPhee-1.pdf|publisher=Dictionary of Literary Biography, American Literary Journalists, 1945–1995|accessdate=31 March 2015|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The book begins by describing how the Atchafalaya River drains 30 percent of the [[Mississippi River]] at its source 300 miles upriver from [[New Orleans]]. Thanks to its steeper gradient and more direct route, the Atchafalaya seeks to change the course of the Mississippi as has happened in its long geological history. Due to the Mississippi's vital importance to industry, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] constructed a control structure at the Atchafalaya's source to prevent this from occurring and to maintain the 30 percent drainage. McPhee explains how [[Morgan City, Louisiana]] would be destroyed if the river's banks increase. Three million cubic feet of water would inundate the town in the case of a [[hundred-year flood]], though the Corps of Engineers has been trying its hardest to build a more stable flood structure.&lt;ref name=normansims/&gt;

==Publication and reception==
All three essays that comprise "The Control of Nature" originally appeared in ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref name=Lat&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miles|first1=Jack|title=McPhee on Debris|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-07-30/books/bk-690_1_john-mcphee|accessdate=17 April 2015|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=30 July 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; After its publication as a book in 1989, ''The Control of Nature'' was McPhee's second-best selling book, after ''[[Coming into the Country]]''.&lt;ref name=normansims/&gt; It received generally positive reviews from book critics.

''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' critic Jack Miles praised McPhee's "knack of presenting even the most ordinary folks in their best, most ingenious moments." He liked "Los Angeles Against the Mountains" the most out of the three essays. He enjoyed how McPhee explained scientific and engineering concepts so a layperson could understand them.&lt;ref name=Lat /&gt;

Martin Ruess, writing in ''[[Technology and Culture]]'', thought that McPhee should have added more interpretation to his descriptions. "McPhee has the poet's knack for the telling point, the metaphor that incisively leads to greater understanding," Ruess wrote. He believed that McPhee underestimated humanity's ability to exert its control on natural settings, since the U.S. infrastructure effectively did this. Ruess concluded that "McPhee's reports from the battlefronts are not as valuable as their implicit message that the control of nature is not nearly as important as knowing one's place in it."&lt;ref name=ruess&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ruess|first1=Martin|title=Book Reviews - The Control on Nature by John McPhee|journal=[[Technology and Culture]]|date=April 1991|volume=32|issue=2|pages=405–407|jstor=3105724|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|location=Baltimore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[particle physics]], '''weak isospin''' is a [[quantum number]] relating to the [[weak interaction]], and parallels the idea of [[isospin]] under the [[strong interaction]]. Weak isospin is usually given the symbol {{math|T}} or {{math|I}} with the third component written as &lt;math&gt;T_\mathrm{z}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;T_3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{z}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;I_3&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Ambiguities: {{math|I}} is also used as sign for the ‘normal’ [[isospin]], same for the third component &lt;math&gt;T_3&lt;/math&gt; aka &lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{z}&lt;/math&gt;. {{math|T}} is also used as the sign for [[Topness]]. This article uses {{math|T}} and &lt;math&gt;T_3&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be understood as the eigenvalue of a [[charge (physics)|charge operator]].

The '''weak isospin conservation law''' relates the conservation of &lt;math&gt;T_3&lt;/math&gt;; all weak interactions must preserve &lt;math&gt;T_3&lt;/math&gt;. It is also conserved by the [[fundamental interaction|electromagnetic, and strong interactions]]. However, one of the interactions is with the [[Higgs field]]. Since the Higgs field [[vacuum expectation value]] is nonzero, particles interact with this field all the time even in vacuum. This changes their weak isospin (and weak hypercharge). Only a specific combination of them, &lt;math&gt;Q = T_3 + \tfrac{1}{2}Y_\mathrm{W}&lt;/math&gt; (electric charge), is conserved. &lt;math&gt;T_3&lt;/math&gt; is more important than {{math|T}} and often the term "weak isospin" refers to the "3rd component of weak isospin".

==Relation with chirality==
[[Fermion]]s with negative [[chirality (physics)|chirality]] (also called “left-handed” fermions) have &lt;math&gt;T = \tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and can be grouped into doublets with &lt;math&gt;T_3 = \plusmn \tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; that behave the same way under the [[weak interaction]]. For example, up-type [[quarks]] ([[up quark|u]], [[charm quark|c]], [[top quark|t]]) have &lt;math&gt;T_3 = +\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and always transform into down-type quarks ([[down quark|d]], [[strange quark|s]], [[bottom quark|b]]), which have &lt;math&gt;T_3 = -\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, and vice versa. On the other hand, a quark never decays weakly into a quark of the same &lt;math&gt;T_3&lt;/math&gt;. Something similar happens with left-handed [[lepton]]s, which exist as doublets containing a charged lepton ({{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Electron-}}, {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Muon-}}, {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Tau-}}) with &lt;math&gt;T_3 = -\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and a [[neutrino]] ({{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Electron neutrino}}, {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Muon neutrino}}, {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Tau neutrino}}) with &lt;math&gt;T_3 = +\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. In all cases, the corresponding [[antiparticle|''anti''-fermion]] has reversed chirality (“right-handed” antifermion) and sign reversed &lt;math&gt;T_3&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Fermion]]s with positive chirality (“right-handed” fermions) and ''anti''-fermions with negative chirality (“left-handed” anti-fermions) have &lt;math&gt;T = T_3 = 0&lt;/math&gt; and form singlets that ''do not undergo weak interactions''.

Electric charge, &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, is related to weak isospin, &lt;math&gt;T_3&lt;/math&gt;, and [[weak hypercharge]], &lt;math&gt;Y_\mathrm{W}&lt;/math&gt;, by
:&lt;math&gt;Q = T_3 +\tfrac{1}{2}Y_\mathrm{W}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Weak isospin and the W bosons==
The symmetry associated with weak isospin is [[SU(2)]] and requires gauge [[boson]]s with integral &lt;math&gt;T_3&lt;/math&gt; ({{SubatomicParticle|W boson+}}, {{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}} and {{SubatomicParticle|W boson0}}) to mediate transformations between fermions with half-integer weak isospin charges. This implies that {{SubatomicParticle|W boson}} bosons must have &lt;math&gt;T = 1&lt;/math&gt;, with three different values of &lt;math&gt;T_3&lt;/math&gt;:
*{{SubatomicParticle|W boson+}} boson &lt;math&gt;(T_3 = +1)&lt;/math&gt; is emitted in transitions &lt;math&gt;(T_3 = +\tfrac{1}{2})&lt;/math&gt; → &lt;math&gt;(T_3 = -\tfrac{1}{2})&lt;/math&gt;.
*{{SubatomicParticle|W boson0}} boson &lt;math&gt;(T_3 = 0)&lt;/math&gt; would be emitted in weak interactions where &lt;math&gt;T_3&lt;/math&gt; does not change, such as [[neutrino]] scattering.
*{{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}} boson &lt;math&gt;(T_3 = -1)&lt;/math&gt; is emitted in transitions &lt;math&gt;(T_3 = -\tfrac{1}{2})&lt;/math&gt; → &lt;math&gt;(T_3 = +\tfrac{1}{2})&lt;/math&gt;. 

Under [[electroweak]] unification, the {{SubatomicParticle|W boson0}} boson mixes with the [[weak hypercharge]] gauge boson {{SubatomicParticle|B boson}}, resulting in the observed {{SubatomicParticle|Z boson0}} boson and the [[photon]] of [[Quantum Electrodynamics]]. However, the resulting {{SubatomicParticle|Z boson0}} and the {{SubatomicParticle|photon}} both have weak isospin 0. As a consequence of their weak isospin values and charges, all the electroweak bosons have [[weak hypercharge]] &lt;math&gt;Y_\text{w}=0&lt;/math&gt;, so unlike [[gluon]]s and the color force, the [[electroweak]] bosons are unaffected by the force they mediate.

'''William Matthew Hart''' (1830-1908) was an English bird illustrator and lithographer who worked for [[John Gould]].

Hart started medical training, but was unable to complete his studies for financial reasons.  He began working for Gould in 1851, beginning an association that was to last thirty years.  Early during this period he made the patterns for the [[lithography|lithographic]] plates for Gould’s work on [[hummingbirds]], as well as working on ''The Birds of Great Britain'' with [[Henry Constantine Richter]].  By 1870 Hart had become Gould's chief artist and lithographer.  After Gould's death in 1881, Hart was employed by [[Richard Bowdler-Sharpe]] of the [[British Museum]] to complete Gould's work on the birds of New Guinea and to produce illustrations for Sharpe’s monograph on the [[birds-of-paradise]].
