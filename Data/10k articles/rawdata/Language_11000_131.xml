      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9390">[[Image:WikipediaBarlow20060529.png|right|thumb|Barlow at the 10th Anniversary of his "Declaration"]]'''"A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace"''' is a widely distributed early paper on the applicability (or lack thereof) of [[government]] on the rapidly growing [[Internet]]. Commissioned for the pioneering Internet project ''[[24 Hours in Cyberspace]]'', it was written by [[John Perry Barlow]], a founder of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], and published online on February 8, 1996, from [[Davos, Switzerland|Davos]], Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://alumni.berkeley.edu/california-magazine/march-april-2006-can-we-know-everything/cyberspace-still-anti-sovereign|title=John Perry Barlow: Is Cyberspace Still Anti-Sovereign?|date=12 February 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was written primarily in response to the passing into law of the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]] in the [[United States]]. In 2014, the [[Department of Records (record label)|Department of Records]] recorded and released audio and video content of Barlow reading the Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.departmentofrecords.co/dor1.html|title=Department of Records|website=www.departmentofrecords.co}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2014/12/08/limited-edition-vinyl-john-pe.html|title=Limited edition vinyl: John Perry Barlow reads "A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace" / Boing Boing|website=boingboing.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
{{Quotation|Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.|[[John Perry Barlow]]|"A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace"}}

The declaration sets out, in sixteen short paragraphs, a rebuttal to government of the Internet by any outside force, specifically the United States. It states that the United States did not have the [[consent of the governed]] to apply laws to the Internet, and that the Internet was outside any country's borders. Instead, the Internet was developing its own [[social contract]]s to determine how to handle its problems, based on the [[ethic of reciprocity|golden rule]]. It does this in language evocative of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] and obliquely cites it in its final paragraphs. Although the paper mentions the Telecommunications Act, it also accuses [[China]], [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Russia]], [[Singapore]], and [[Italy]] of stifling the Internet.&lt;ref name="declaration"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence |title=A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace |accessdate=2017-02-23 |last=Barlow |first=John Perry|authorlink=John Perry Barlow|author2= |date=1996-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
At the time the paper was written, Barlow had already written extensively on the Internet and its social and legal phenomena,&lt;ref name="dblp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Barlow:John_Perry.html |title=DBLP: John Perry Barlow |accessdate=2007-02-09 |last=Ley |first=Michael |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225005436/http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Barlow%3AJohn_Perry.html |archivedate=25 February 2007 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being a founding member of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]].&lt;ref name="effboard"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/about/board/ |title=EFF: Board of Directors |accessdate=2007-02-09| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070206043032/http://www.eff.org/about/board/| archivedate= 6 February 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work he was known best for previously, "[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.03/economy.ideas_pr.html The Economy of Ideas]", published March 1994 in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine, also made allusions to [[Thomas Jefferson]] and some of the ideas he would write about in his declaration.

==Critical response==
Because of its subject matter, Barlow's work quickly became famous and widely distributed on the Internet. Within three months, an estimated 5,000 websites had copies of the declaration.&lt;ref name="bw"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Yang | first = Catherine | date = 1996-05-06 | title = Law Creeps Onto the Lawless Net | journal = [[BusinessWeek]] | url = http://www.businessweek.com/1996/19/b347472.htm | accessdate = 2007-02-08 | pages = 58–64 | issue = 3474 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At nine months, that number was estimated to be 40,000.&lt;ref name="networkcomputing"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Frezza| first = Bill| date = 1996-11-01| title = Can Public Network Computing Save Democracy| journal = Network Computing|pages = 35}}&lt;/ref&gt; To approach Barlow's vision of a self-governing Internet, a [[virtual magistrate]] was set up by the [[Cyberspace Law Institute]], now hosted by the [[Chicago-Kent College of Law]]. [[Magistrate]]s would be appointed by the institute and other legal groups to solve online disputes.&lt;ref name="bw" /&gt; The declaration has been criticized for internal inconsistencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Evans | first = Woody | authorlink=Woody Evans | date = 2016 | title = Cyberspace is the Child of the Industrial Age - Defining it as Independent is Nonsense | journal = [[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]] | url = http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/evans0220 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The declaration's assertion that 'cyberspace' is a place removed from the physical world has also been challenges by people who point to the fact that the internet is always linked to its underlying geography&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graham|first=Mark|date=2013-03-01|title=Geography/internet: ethereal alternate dimensions of cyberspace or grounded augmented realities?|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/geoj.12009|journal=The Geographical Journal|language=en|volume=179|issue=2|pages=177–182|doi=10.1111/geoj.12009|issn=0016-7398}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Outside the Internet, the response was less positive. [[Larry Irving]], the [[United States Department of Commerce|Assistant Secretary of Commerce]], said that a lack of safeguards would "slow down the growth of what is likely to be a major boon for consumers and business".&lt;ref name="bw" /&gt;  In the online magazine ''[[HotWired]]'', one columnist referred to his document as simply "hogwash".&lt;ref name="featherman"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Cembalest | first = Robin| date = 1996-09-20| title = The Featherman File| journal = Forward |pages = 2 | volume = C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2002 the number of sites copying the declaration was estimated to have dropped to 20,000.&lt;ref name="mgm"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/IP/P2P/MGM_v_Grokster/?f=20020122_barlow_decl.html |title=John Perry Barlow Declaration for Defendants in MGM et al. v.

His response was that "we all get older and smarter".&lt;ref name="reason"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Doherty| first = Brian|date=August–September 2004 | title = John Perry Barlow 2.0: The Thomas Jefferson of cyberspace reinvents his body — and his politics | journal = Reason| url = http://www.reason.com/news/show/29236.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''abomination of desolation,''' '''abomination that makes desolate''', or '''desolating sacrilege''' (Hebrew: {{Lang-he-n|הַשִּׁקּוּץ מְשׁוֹמֵֽם}}, ''ha-shikkuts meshomem'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/interlinear/daniel/11-31.htm|title=Daniel 11:31 — Interlinear Bible|last=|first=|date=|website=Biblehub|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a term found in the [[Book of Daniel]] which means literally "an abomination that desolates" or "an abomination that appalls".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/bakers-evangelical-dictionary/the-abomination-that-causes-desolation.html|chapter=Abomination That Causes Desolation, the|title=Baker's Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology Online|website=Bible Study Tools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{See also|Abomination (Bible)}}
The word "abomination" is described as a "detestable act" or "detestable thing"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/hebrew/8441.htm|title=Strong's Hebrew: 8441. תּוֹעֵבָה (toebah) -- abomination|website=biblehub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in both [[Biblical Hebrew|biblical]] and [[Mishnaic Hebrew|rabbinic Hebrew]], is a familiar term for an [[cult image|idol]],&lt;ref&gt;I Kings, xi. 5; II Kings, xxiii. 13; Sifra, Ḳedoshim, beginning, and Mekilta, Mishpatim, xx. ed. Weiss, 107.&lt;/ref&gt; or pertains to idolatrous worship, and therefore may well have the same application in Daniel, which should accordingly be rendered, in agreement with {{bibleref2|Ezra|9:1-4}} "motionless abomination" or, also, "appalling abomination".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/353-abomination-of-desolation|title=Abomination of Desolation - Jewish Encyclopedia|work=jewishencyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars—Hoffmann, Nestle, Bevan, and others—suggest that as a designation for [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] it is simply an intentional perversion of his usual appellation "''[[Baalshamin|Baal Shamem]]''" ("lord of heaven") is quite plausible,&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Isidore and Cyrus Adler (Funk and Wagnalls, 1916) The Jewish Encyclopedia: A Descriptive Record of the History, Religion, Literature, and Customs of the Jewish People from the Earliest Times to the Present Day, Volume 1 (page 80)&lt;/ref&gt; as attested by the perversion of [[Beelzebub]] into "Βεελζεβούλ" (Greek version) in {{bibleref2|Mark|3:22}}, as well as the express injunction found in Tosef., 'Ab. Zarah, vi. (vii) and Babli 'Ab. Zarah, 46a that the names of idols may be pronounced only in a distorted or abbreviated form.

==Biblical occurrences==

===Daniel===
The phrase "abomination of desolation" ({{Lang-he|הַשִּׁקּ֥וּץ מְשׁוֹמֵם}} ''ha-šiqqūṣ məšōmêm'') is found in three places in the Book of Daniel, all within the literary context of [[apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] visions.

{{quote|And he shall make a strong covenant with many for one week; and for half of the week he shall cause sacrifice and offering to cease; and upon the wing of abominations shall come one who makes desolate, until the decreed end is poured out on the desolator.|{{bibleref2|Daniel|9:27|RSV}} ([[Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition|RSV-CE]])}}

{{quote|Forces from him shall appear and profane the temple and fortress, and shall take away the continual burnt offering. And they shall set up the abomination that makes desolate.|{{bibleref2|Daniel|11:31|RSV}} ([[Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition|RSV-CE]])}}

{{quote|And from the time that the continual burnt offering is taken away, and the abomination that makes desolate is set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.|{{bibleref2|Daniel|12:11|RSV}} ([[Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition|RSV-CE]])}}

===Synoptic Gospels===
{{See also|Olivet Discourse}}
In the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and the [[Gospel of Mark]], the term ([[Koine Greek|Greek]] τὸ βδέλυγμα τῆς ἐρημώσεως, ''to bdelygma tēs erēmōseōs'') is used by Jesus in the [[Olivet discourse]]. In the Matthean account, Jesus is presented as quoting Daniel explicitly. In the [[Gospel of Mark]], the phrase "spoken of by Daniel the prophet" is absent in the [[Codex Sinaiticus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinaiticus.com/|title=Codex Sinaiticus in English Anderson Translation|website=www.sinaiticus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|So when you see the desolating sacrilege spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.|{{bibleref2|Matthew|24:15-16|RSV}} ([[Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition|RSV-CE]])}}

{{quote|But when you see the desolating sacrilege set up where it ought not to be (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.|{{bibleref2|Mark|13:14|RSV}} ([[Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition|RSV-CE]])}}

In Luke's version of Jesus' warning, the abomination is not mentioned, and the sign that it is time to flee Jerusalem is explicitly said to be that Jerusalem would be surrounded by armies.
{{quote|But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation has come near. Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, and let those who are inside the city depart, and let not those who are out in the country enter it.|{{bibleref2|Luke|21:20-21|RSV}} ([[Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition|RSV-CE]])}}

{{See also|Historicism (Christianity)}}

According to Roman historian [[Cassius Dio]], after the Temple was destroyed in 70 AD the worship overseen by the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] ceased.&lt;ref name="biu.ac.il"&gt;http://www.biu.ac.il/JS/rennert/history_5.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Temple Mount]] was covered over with rubble and a pagan temple dedicated to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] was built when [[Hadrian]] became Caesar (117 - 138 AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.christusrex.org/www1/jhs/TSsptemp.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-03-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907043901/http://www.christusrex.org/www1/jhs/TSsptemp.html |archive-date=2009-09-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://followinghadrian.com/2014/11/05/exploring-aelia-capitolina-hadrians-jerusalem/|title=Exploring Aelia Capitolina, Hadrian’s Jerusalem|first=|last=followinghadrian|date=5 November 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hadrian installed on the mount two statues: one of [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]] and another of himself; this was seen by the Jews as idolatry. In addition, Hadrian expelled the Jews from Jerusalem altogether, only allowing them into the city on the fast of [[Tisha B'av]] (the ninth day of the lunar month of Av), a day of mourning for the destruction of the First and the Second Jewish Temples. This appears to have caused a [[Bar Kokhba revolt|second Jewish revolt]] with the intent of recapturing Jerusalem and restoring the Temple. In response, Rome sent six full [[Roman legion|legions]] with [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliaries]] and elements from up to six additional legions, which finally managed to crush the revolt.&lt;ref name="Israel-Tour-Day"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616233531/http://www.rsy-netzer.org.uk/newsletters/mailing-view/65.html|archivedate=16 June 2011|title=Israel Tour Daily Newsletter|url=http://www.rsy-netzer.org.uk/newsletters/mailing-view/65.html|date=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="biu.ac.il"/&gt; The temple appears to have been rebuilt during the early [[Umayyad dynasty|Umayyad period]] as the [[al-Aqsa Mosque]], which stands on the site today.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolle, David (1994). Yarmuk AD 636: The Muslim Conquest of Syria. Osprey Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;{{request quotation|date=June 2018}} 

====Rabbinical literature====
There is a rabbinical consensus that the expression refers to the 168 BC desecration of the [[Second Temple]] by the erection of a [[Zeus]] statue in its sacred precincts by [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] (the flashpoint of the [[Maccabean Revolt]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=353&amp;letter=A|title=Abomination of Desolation - Jewish Encyclopedia|work=jewishencyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Apostomus]].&lt;/ref&gt; Some rabbis, however, see in it an allusion to [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh]], who was reported to have set up "a carved image ... in the house of God".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|II Chron|33:7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yer. Ta'anit, iv. 68a, and Rashi on the passage in Babli, ibid. 28b.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Church Fathers====
[[Church Fathers|Church Father]] [[Augustine of Hippo]] (379) states, "For Luke very clearly bears witness that the prophecy of Daniel was fulfilled when Jerusalem was overthrown." (vol. 6, p.&amp;nbsp;170)

[[John Chrysostom]] understood this to refer to the armies that surrounded Jerusalem and the factions fighting within it which preceded the destruction of the city.&lt;ref name="documentacatholicaomnia.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/04z/z_0345-0407__Iohannes_Chrysostomus__Homilies_on_The_Gospel_Of_Matthew__EN.pdf.html|title=Iohannes Chrysostomus - Homilies on The Gospel Of Matthew [0345-0407] Full Text at Documenta Catholica Omnia|website=www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reformers====

[[John Calvin]] rejects the rabbinical view and wrote "In consequence of the obscurity of this passage it has been twisted in a variety of ways. At the end of the ninth chapter I have shewn the impossibility of its referring to the profanation of the Temple which occurred under the tyranny of Antiochus. On this occasion the angel bears witness to such a complete destruction of the Temple, as to leave no room for the hope of its repair and restoration. Then the circumstances of the time convinces us of this. For he then said, Christ shall confirm the covenant with many for one week, and shall cause the sacrifices and oblation to cease. Afterwards, the abomination that stupifieth shall be added, and desolation or stupor, and then death will distill, says he, upon the astonished or stupefied one. The angel, therefore, there treats of the perpetual devastation of the Temple. So in this passage, without doubt;, he treats of the period after the destruction of the Temple; there could be no hope of restoration, as the law with all its ceremonies would then arrive at its termination" (Commentary on Daniel, vol. 2)

[[John Wesley]] (1754) also rejects the rabbinical view and wrote, "When ye shall see the abomination of desolation - Daniel's term is, 'The abomination that maketh desolate' (xi. 31); that is, the standards of the desolating legions, on which they bear the abominable images of their idols. Standing in the holy place - Not only the temple, and the mountain on which it stood, but the whole city of Jerusalem, and several furlongs of land round about it, were accounted holy; particularly the mountain on which our Lord now sat, and on which the Romans afterward planted their ensigns." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/cmt/wesley/mat024.htm|title=Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible: Matthew: Matthew Chapter 24|website=www.sacred-texts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modern biblical scholarship====
{{See also|Book of Daniel#Dating and content|Gospel of Mark#Date}}

Some claim the 1 Maccabees usage of the term pointing to an event prior to the prophecy given by Christ, in the actions of Antiochus IV Epiphanes in the mid-2nd century BC. Specifically, he set up an altar, probably to Zeus or Baal Shamem, in the Second Temple in Jerusalem and sacrificed [[swine]] on it around the year 168 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Jewish Encyclopedia |title=Antiochus IV., Epiphanes |url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1589-antiochus-iv-epiphanes |last=Ginzberg |first=Louis |volume=1 |page=635}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern scholars believe that [[Prophecy of Seventy Weeks#Scholarly viewpoint|Daniel 9:27]], 11:31 and 12:11 are examples of ''[[vaticinium ex eventu]]'' ([[Postdiction|prophecies after the event]]) relating to Antiochus.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald S. Wallace, ''The Message of Daniel'', IVP 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NBD"&gt;"Desolating sacrilege" in ''New Bible Dictionary'' (third ed), IVP.&lt;/ref&gt;

Date | url =  http://www.katapi.org.uk/NTIntro/SynopGospel2.htm#IVIntEv| doi = | id = | isbn = | nopp = true }}&lt;/ref&gt; have concluded that Matthew 24:15 and Mark 13:14 are prophecies after the event about the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|siege of Jerusalem in AD 70]] by the Roman general [[Titus]],&lt;ref&gt;Matt 23:37-38; Matt 24:1-2,15-21;  Luke 13:34-35; Luke 21:20-21&lt;/ref&gt; after the [[First Jewish–Roman War|First Jewish Revolt]], and subsequent destruction of the Jewish Temple.

Some scholars, including Hermann Detering,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Synoptic Apocalypse (Mark 13 par): A document from the time of Bar Kokhba|journal=Journal of Higher Criticism|date=Fall 2000|first=Hermann|last=Detering|volume=7|issue=2|pages=161–210|id=|url=http://www.radikalkritik.de/Mk13%20JHC.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-01-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227161050/http://www.radikalkritik.de/Mk13%20JHC.pdf|archivedate=27 February 2008|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; see these verses as a ''[[vaticinium ex eventu]]'' about [[Emperor Hadrian]]'s attempt to install the statue of [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus|Jupiter Capitolinus]] on the site of the ruined Jewish Temple in Jerusalem leading to the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] of 132-135 AD.

====Preterism====
{{See also|Preterism}}
[[Preterism|Preterists]] believe that Jesus quoted this prophecy in Mark 13:14 as referring to an event in his 1st century disciples' immediate future, such as the siege of Jerusalem in 70 AD.&lt;ref&gt;[[Craig Blomberg]], Jesus and the Gospels, Apollos 1997, pp.322-326&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[N. T. Wright]], Jesus and the Victory of God, Fortress 1996, p. 348ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

One commentator relates the prophecy to the actions of [[Caligula]] c. 40 AD when he ordered that a golden statue depicting himself as Zeus [[incarnate]] be set up in the Temple in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Harvard University Press, 1976, {{ISBN|0-674-39731-2}}, ''The Crisis Under Gaius Caligula'', pages 254-256:&lt;/ref&gt; This prospect however, never came to fruition since he was assassinated in 41 AD along with his wife and daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usask.ca/antiquities/coins/caligula.html|title=Coins of the Emperor Caligula|date=17 February 2001|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010217055505/http://www.usask.ca/antiquities/coins/caligula.html|archivedate=17 February 2001|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christocentric interpretation====
Some, such as Peter Bolt, head of New Testament at [[Moore Theological College]], claim that the abomination of desolation in [[Mark 13]] refers to the crucifixion of the Son of God; in other words, Jesus is referring to his own impending death.&lt;ref&gt;Peter G. Bolt, The Cross from a Distance: Atonement in Mark’s Gospel, New Studies in Biblical Theology, 18. Downers Grove: InterVarsity, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, Discourses in Matthew, Lutheran theologian and professor of Systematic Theology and New Testament at [[Concordia Theological Seminary]], Dr. David. P. Scaer, states,

{{quote|Within the context of the Fifth Discourse, which focuses on Jesus' death and Jerusalem's destruction, the best explanation for "the desolating sacrilege ... standing in the holy place" is the crucifixion of Jesus at Golgotha (27:33). He is the "desolating sacrilege" and Golgotha is "the holy place".&lt;ref&gt;David P. Scaer, Discourses in Matthew: Jesus Teaches the Church (St. Louis, MO., Concordia Publishing House, 2004), 382&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Futurism===
{{see also|Futurism (Christianity)}}
Interpreters with a [[Futurism (Christianity)|futurist]] perspective think that Jesus' prophecy deals with a literal, [[end-time]]s [[False Prophet]].&lt;ref&gt;King James Bible 1620, Revelation 16:13,19:20,20:10&lt;/ref&gt; Futurists consider the abomination of desolation prophecy of Daniel mentioned by Jesus in Matthew 24:15 and Mark 13:14 to refer to an event in the future, when there appears "[[Man of Sin|the man of lawlessness]]".&lt;ref&gt;King James Bible 1620 Revelation 16:13, 19:20, 20:10&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

[[Premillennialism|Premillennialist]] futurists like [[Arthur Pink]] in his work ''The Antichrist'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblebelievers.com/Pink/antichrist08.htm|title=The Antichrist|publisher=biblebelievers.com|year=1923|author=Pink, Arthur W.|pages=Chapter 6, The Career of the Antichrist|accessdate=2007-06-25| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070707224515/http://www.biblebelievers.com/Pink/antichrist08.htm| archivedate= 7 July 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; attribute vast portions within the Old and New Testament to this future figure that will rise to global prominence politically, economically and militarily by setting up a governmental structure possessing sweeping powers over worship and the affairs of humanity.

===Mixed interpretation===

====Multiple fulfillments====
Methodist theologian [[Adam Clarke]] and Anglican bishop [[Thomas Newton]] interpret the abomination of desolation as a proverbial phrase that could include multiple events "substituted in the place of, or set up in opposition to, the ordinances of God, his worship, his truth, etc."&lt;ref name="sacred-texts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/cmt/clarke/dan012.htm|title=Commentary on the Bible by Adam Clarke: Daniel: Daniel Chapter 12|work=sacred-texts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows for some or all of the examples in the following (incomplete) list to be viewed as partial fulfillments of this prophecy simultaneously:{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

* the re-dedication of  the Temple to Zeus by Antiochus IV Epiphanes in 167 BC, 
* the worship of the Roman Standards on the [[Temple Mount]] under Titus in 70 AD and
* the building of the [[Dome of the Rock]] by the [[Umayyad Caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] in 691 AD.

====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====
The [[Joseph Smith–Matthew]] states (in verse 12) that the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel is the destruction of Jerusalem (first in AD 70). Later (in verse 32) it states that the abomination of desolation will be fulfilled again when at the end times, when Jerusalem is subject to much destruction before the [[Second Coming]] of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lds.org/scriptures/bd/abomination-of-desolation?lang=eng|title=Bible Dictionary: Abomination of Desolation|publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|accessdate=2011-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alfred Eriksen''' (nicknamed "Karlsøypresten", 30 August 1864 &amp;ndash; 4 May 1934) was a Norwegian priest, politician, newspaper editor and non-fiction writer.

==Personal life==
He was born as '''Alfred Eriksen''' in [[Oslo|Christiania]] as the son of watchmaker Henrik Erichsen (1825–1870) and Emilie Kathrine Christoffersen (1825–1902). He was married to vicar's daughter Sigrid Marie Wexelsen (1866–1960) from August 1890.&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Alfred Eriksen |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Håvard Dahl |last=Bratrein |editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]] |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Alfred_Eriksen/utdypning |language=Norwegian |accessdate=5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Eriksen [[examen artium|finished]] his secondary education at [[Oslo Cathedral School|Kristiania Cathedral School]] in 1883.&lt;ref name=nsd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsd.uib.no/polsys/index.cfm?urlname=polsys&amp;lan=&amp;MenuItem=N1_1&amp;ChildItem=&amp;State=collapse&amp;UttakNr=33&amp;person=10709|title=Alfred Eriksen|publisher=Norwegian Social Science Data Services (NSD)|language=Norwegian|accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then studied theology, graduating with the [[cand.theol.]] degree in theology in 1888. After working one year as a teacher in [[Ålesund]] he was appointer [[vicar]] in [[Karlsøy]] in 1891, and held this position until 1910, when he became vicar in [[Vålerenga Church|Vålerengen Church]]. While being a priest he wrote his doctoral thesis, titled ''Vilje. En psykologisk afhandling''.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; He was founder and first editor of the newspaper ''[[Nordlys]]'' from 1902,&lt;ref name=snl-nordlys&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Nordlys |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |url=http://www.snl.no/Nordlys |language=Norwegian | accessdate=5 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and edited ''Nordlys'' until 1911.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Alfred Eriksen |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |url=http://www.snl.no/Alfred_Eriksen |language=Norwegian | accessdate=10 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913 he founded the publication ''Dagens Liv'', and edited it, but it soon became defunct.&lt;ref name=nsd/&gt; He published a popular book on the history of religion, ''Religionsbilleder og kulturskildringer'', in 1901, and a book on jurisprudence for ordinary people, ''Lovbok for folket'', in 1903.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

He also became involved in politics, was elected mayor of [[Karlsøy]] for the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]] in 1898,&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; and re-elected in 1901 and 1904.&lt;ref name=nsd/&gt; He was a failed candidate for the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1900|1900 general election]]; although his party swept the vote in Karlsøy, this was not enough to win the constituency [[Troms|Tromsø Amt]]. In [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1903|1903]] he was elected to the [[Parliament of Norway]], representing the [[Norwegian Labour Party]]. This was the first time members of the organized labour movement were represented in Parliament.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; The Labour Party went from 0 to 4 seats after the 1903 election, all representatives of [[Northern Norway]]. In addition to Lind Johansen, they were [[Meyer Foshaug]], [[John Lind Johansen]] and [[Jørg Berge]]; also, [[Adam Egede-Nissen]] was elected on the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]] ballot.&lt;ref name=p211&gt;{{cite book|last=Bjørnson|first=Øyvind|authorlink=Øyvind Bjørnson|title=På klassekampens grunn 1900-1920|year=1990|series=Volume two of ''[[Arbeiderbevegelsens historie i Norge]]''|publisher=Tiden|location=Oslo|language=Norwegian|isbn=82-10-02752-2|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was re-elected to Parliament in 1906 and in 1909 for the constituency [[Tromsøysund|Tromsøsundet]].&lt;ref name=nsd/&gt; He became known as one of the greatest speakers at the Parliament during this period, and his nickname "Karlsøypresten" became a well-known concept among the general public.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

He was awarded the [[Medal for Outstanding Civic Service]] for his role as mediator in the 1911 lockout.&lt;ref name=arbleks&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=1933 |volume=2 |title=Eriksen, Alfred |encyclopedia=[[Arbeidernes Leksikon]]|editor1=[[Jakob Friis|Friis, Jakob]] |editor2=[[Trond Hegna|Hegna, Trond]] |publisher=Arbeidermagasinets Forlag |location=Oslo |language=Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eriksen did not want to subordinate himself to the party discipline, and was eventually expelled from the Labour Party in 1912. Contributing to his downfall was his actions in the position as chairman of the society [[Riksmålsforbundet]] from 1911 to 1912. From then he was not politically active, but wrote numerous newspaper articles on cultural topics.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6494">'''American Sign Language literature''' (or '''ASL literature''') refers to [[Narrative|stories]], [[poetry]], dramatic productions, [[Fairy tale|folk tales]], and [[songs]] in [[American Sign Language]].&lt;ref name="bahan2006"&gt;Bahan, Ben. (2006). "Face-to-Face Tradition in the American Deaf Community." In ''Signing the Body Poetic: Essays in American Sign Language Literature.'' Ed. H.-Dirksen L. Bauman, Jennifer L. Nelson, and Heidi Rose. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; ASL literature can denote works translated from other literatures into ASL, like Patrick Graybill's translation of the poem "Not Waving, but Drowning",&lt;ref&gt;Poetry in Motion (http://store.signmedia.com/1352.html)&lt;/ref&gt; or more often, works composed originally in ASL itself. Other notable performers of ASL literature include [[Ben Bahan]], [[Ella Mae Lentz]], [[Sam Supalla]], and [[Clayton Valli]].

== History ==
Every spoken [[language]] used today originated in a pre-written, or oral form. Because no widely accepted method has yet developed for recording American Sign Language in writing, it persists as a purely "visual" language.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Cynthia L. ''Deaf American Literature: From Carnival to the Canon''&lt;/ref&gt; Only with the advent of [[film]] technology in the early 20th century could ASL be recorded, preserved, and distributed. The earliest example of recorded signing is a [[National Association of the Deaf (United States)|National Association of the Deaf]] compilation from between 1910 and 1920, containing various types of ASL discourse, including lectures, poems, stories, and songs.&lt;ref&gt;Bahan, Ben. (2006). "Face-to-Face Tradition in the American Deaf Community." In "Signing the Body Poetic." p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the first films of ASL lectures in the early twentieth century, more ASL performances were gradually recorded, which has affected the tradition.&lt;ref name="krentz2006"&gt;Krentz, Christopher. (2006). "The Camera as Printing Press: How Film has Influenced ASL Literature." In ''Signing the Body Poetic''.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, a wide variety of ASL works is documented on video, and deaf performers continue to perform ASL stories, poems, and other works live to enthusiastic audiences at festivals, university events, clubs, and social gatherings. Each year, [[Gallaudet University]], Deaf West Theater, and other deaf groups mount theatrical productions in ASL. Furthermore, many talented storytellers and poets perform works that are never recorded; video captures only a small percentage of ASL literature. The prevalence of digital video technology has allowed more signers to record their own ASL productions more easily and share them with more people than ever before. [[YouTube]], [[Facebook]], and Apple's [[Photo Booth]] have all contributed to wider exposure of original ASL creations.

== Features and form ==
ASL literary works often feature creative uses of signs, handshapes, facial expressions, and classifiers. Different performers have developed recognizably different styles and themes.

One common type of ASL literature is the "ABC" poem, performed by young children and adult ASL poets alike. This type of poem is characterized by the use of a series of [[handshapes]] that follows the order of the [[manual alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;Peters, pp. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt; There are a huge variety of signs that use each handshape in the alphabet, but poems will frequently use ASL classifiers (see [[American Sign Language grammar]]) that provide the poet much more room to exercise his own creativity. A closely related form of poetry is the handshape poem, in which an ASL poet performs a poem or narrative using a limited variety of handshapes. This constricts the poet in form, much as rhyme or meter does in written poetry, and requires a precise use of motion and non-manual expression.&lt;ref&gt;Graybill, Patrick. In "Poetry in Motion."&lt;/ref&gt; In "Signing the Body Poetic", the line of an ASL poem is designated by the fluidity of the transition between the 5 parameters. The line is also determined by the balance of articulation between hands.&lt;ref&gt;Bauman, H.-Dirksen L., Jennifer L. Nelson and Heidi Rose. (2006). ''Signing the Body Poetic: Essays in American Sign Language Literature''. University of California Press. &lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2018}} 

The most prevalent type of ASL literature, however, is ASL storytelling. Storytelling transcends basic communication, incorporating techniques such as the "visual vernacular"{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}, as well as a feel for theatrical performance that [[Ben Bahan]] refers to as "smooth signing".&lt;ref name="Bahan, Face to Face Tradition"&gt;Bahan, "Face to Face Tradition"&lt;/ref&gt; Storytelling has served as a method of historical preservation, a mark of [[Deaf Culture|cultural identity]], and most importantly, a common form of entertainment. Just as novelists perfect the art of storytelling through the medium of the written word, Deaf storytellers develop their own distinctive styles and techniques. In a culture that has not always been able to access the same forms of entertainment as hearing culture, such as movies or music, the Deaf have become fiercely proud of their storytellers.&lt;ref name="Bahan, Face to Face Tradition"/&gt; 

The [[National Theatre of the Deaf]] originated in 1967 and performs both classic and original works in American Sign Language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Theatre of the Deaf – HISTORY|url=http://ntd.org/ntd_history.html|accessdate=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''anginal equivalent''' is a symptom such as shortness of breath ([[dyspnea]]), [[diaphoresis]] (sweating), extreme fatigue, or pain at a site other than the chest, occurring in a patient at high cardiac risk. Anginal equivalents are considered to be symptoms of [[myocardial ischemia]]. Anginal equivalents are considered to have the same importance as [[angina pectoris]] in patients presenting with elevation of [[cardiac enzymes]] or certain EKG changes which are diagnostic of myocardial ischemia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.185752 Journal on Circulation]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Le diverse et artificiose machine del Capitano Agostino Ramelli Figure CLXXXVIII.jpg|thumb|right|Bookwheel, from Agostino Ramelli's ''Le diverse et artifiose machine'', 1588]]
The '''bookwheel''' (also written '''book wheel''' and sometimes called a '''reading wheel''') is a type of rotating [[bookcase]] designed to allow one person to read a variety of heavy books in one location with ease. The books are rotated vertically similar to the motion of a [[water wheel]], as opposed to rotating on a flat table surface. The design for the bookwheel originally appeared in a 16th-century illustration by [[Agostino Ramelli]], at a time when large books posed practical problems for readers. Ramelli's design influenced other engineers and, though now obsolete, inspires modern artists and historians.

==History and design==
[[File:Agostino Ramelli from Diverse et artificiose machine cropped.jpg|thumb|left|[[Agostino Ramelli]], 1588]]The bookwheel, in its most commonly seen form, was invented by Italian [[military engineering|military engineer]] [[Agostino Ramelli]] in 1588, presented as one of the 195 designs in ''Le diverse et artificiose machine del Capitano Agostino Ramelli'' (''The various and ingenious machines of Captain Agostino Ramelli'').&lt;ref name="Brashear"&gt;Brashear, Ronald. [http://www.sil.si.edu/ondisplay/ramelli/intro.htm "Ramelli's Machines: Original drawings of the 16th century machines"]. Smithsonian Libraries.&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure that the books remained at a constant angle, Ramelli incorporated an [[epicyclic gearing]] arrangement, a complex device that had only previously been used in [[astronomical clock]]s. Ramelli's design is unnecessarily elaborate, as he likely understood that [[Gravitation|gravity]] could have worked just as effectively (as it does with a [[Ferris wheel]], invented centuries later), but the gearing system allowed him to display his mathematical prowess.&lt;ref name="Rybczynski"&gt;Rybczynski, Witold. ''One Good Turn: A Natural History of the Screwdriver and the Screw''. Scribner, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; While other people would go on to build bookwheels based on Ramelli's design, Ramelli did not in fact ever construct his own.&lt;ref name="garber"&gt;Garber, Megan. [https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/02/behold-the-kindle-of-the-16th-century/273577/ "Behold, the Kindle of the 16th Century"]. ''The Atlantic''. Published 27 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

To what extent bookwheels were appreciated for their convenience versus their [[aesthetic]] qualities remains a matter of speculation according to modern American engineer [[Henry Petroski]].&lt;ref name="Petroski"&gt;Petroski, Henry. ''The Book on the Book Shelf''. Knopf, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Ramelli himself described the bookwheel as a "beautiful and ingenious machine, very useful and convenient for anybody who takes pleasure in study, especially for those who are indisposed and tormented by [[gout]]."&lt;ref name="ramelli"&gt;Ramelli, Agostino. ''Le diverse et artificiose machine.'' 1588. Quoted in Rybczynski, Witold. ''One Good Turn: A Natural History of the Screwdriver and the Screw''. Scribner, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Ramelli's reference to gout, a condition that impairs mobility, demonstrates the appeal of a device that allows access to several books while seated. However, Petroski notes that Ramelli's illustration lacks space for writing and other scholarly work, and that the "fanciful wheel" may not have been appropriate for any activity beyond reading.&lt;ref name="Petroski"/&gt;

While the design of the bookwheel is commonly credited to Ramelli, some historians dispute that he was the first to invent such a device. [[Joseph Needham]], a historian of [[History of science and technology in China|Chinese technology]], stated that revolving bookcases, though not vertically oriented, had their origins in China "perhaps a thousand years before Ramelli's design was taken there."&lt;ref name="Petroski" /&gt;

==Influence and legacy==
[[File:BookwheelThysianaLeiden1.jpg|thumb|Bookwheel in [[Bibliotheca Thysiana|Leiden]] (c.1650)]]
The bookwheel was an early attempt to solve the problem of managing [[Global spread of the printing press|increasingly numerous printed works]], which were typically large and heavy in Ramelli's time.&lt;ref name="garber" /&gt; It has been called one of the earliest "information retrieval" devices,&lt;ref name="Norman"&gt;Norman, Jeremy. [http://www.historyofinformation.com/expanded.php?id=1560 "Renaissance Information Retrieval Device"]. HistoryofInformation.com.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been considered a precursor to modern technologies, such as [[hypertext]] and [[e-reader]]s, that allow readers to store and cross-reference large amounts of information.&lt;ref name="garber" /&gt; Other inventors, such as [[List of French inventions and discoveries|French inventor]] [[Nicolas Grollier de Servière]] (1596–1689), proposed their own variations on Ramelli's design.

Of the dozens of bookwheels built in the 17th and 18th centuries, 14 are extant: in [[Ghent University Library|Ghent]], [[Hamburg]], [[Klosterneuburg Monastery|Klosterneuburg]], [[Jagiellonian University|Krakau]], [[Lambach Abbey|Lambach]], [[Bibliotheca Thysiana|Leiden]], [[Naples]] (2), [[Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal|Paris]], [[Prague]] (2), [[Biblioteca Palafoxiana|Puebla City]], [[Wernigerode]] and in [[Herzog August Library|Wolfenbüttel]].&lt;ref&gt;John Considine: 'The Ramellian Bookwheel'. In: [http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/24055069-00104001 ''Erudition and the Republic of Letters'', 2016, 1: 4, 408-409]&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary times, the bookwheel is valued for its historical importance, decorative appeal, and symbolic significance. Ramelli's design has been recreated by artists such as [[Daniel Libeskind]],&lt;ref name="allen"&gt;Allen, Greg. [http://greg.org/archive/2010/09/20/on_the_making_of_the_lost_biennale_machines_of_daniel_libeskind.html "On The Making Of The Lost Biennale Machines Of Daniel Libeskind"]. Greg.org.&lt;/ref&gt; and inspired the name of the [[Smithsonian Library]]'s blog "Turning the Book Wheel".&lt;ref name="smithsonian"&gt;[http://smithsonianlibraries.tumblr.com/post/54913999165/did-we-ever-mention-that-we-actually-constructed-a Blog post].

'''Carlos Adão''' "'''Cadão'''" '''Volpato''' (born December 28, 1956) is a [[Brazil]]ian musician, artist, journalist and writer. He is best known for being the frontman of [[cult following|cult]] [[post-punk]] band [[Fellini (band)|Fellini]].

==Biography==
Cadão Volpato was born in [[São Paulo]] in 1956, and graduated in [[Journalism]] at the [[Escola de Comunicações e Artes da Universidade de São Paulo|ECA-USP]] and in [[social science]] at the [[:pt:Faculdade de Filosofia, Letras e Ciências Humanas da Universidade de São Paulo|FFLCH-USP]]. His first job was in 1984, at the magazine ''[[Veja (magazine)|Veja]]'' as a text reviser.&lt;ref name="fellini"&gt;[http://historiaoraldofellini.blogspot.com.br/2008/04/cado-volpato_01.html Interview with Cadão Volpato, 1996] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1984 he founded the band [[Fellini (band)|Fellini]], alongside Thomas Pappon, Jair Marcos, Ricardo Salvagni and Celso Pucci, also known as "Minho K." (who only played with the band once).&lt;ref name="fellini"/&gt;

After Fellini's first break-up in 1990 (due to Thomas Pappon leaving Brazil to go live in Europe, and because Volpato wanted to focus on his intellectual career),&lt;ref name="fellini"/&gt; he founded a "spiritual successor" to Fellini called Funziona Senza Vapore (in a reference to Fellini's most famous song), with the two original Fellini members plus Stela Campos replacing Pappon. They recorded in 1992 a homonymous album; however, it was only released ten years later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://musicaindiebr.blogspot.com.br/2006/08/funziona-senza-vapore-funziona-senza.html Funziona Senza Vapore (1992)] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 Cadão reformed Fellini and with them released two more albums before its second break-up in 2010. The band reunited once more in early 2016, for a limited series of shows across São Paulo.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/rapaziadadofellini/posts/822711564521837 Fellini on Facebook – January 14, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 he released his first solo album, ''[[Tudo que Eu Quero Dizer Tem que Ser no Ouvido]]''.

From 1991 to 1994 and again from 2010 to 2012 he hosted the program ''Metrópolis'' in [[TV Cultura]] (initial episodes with him also featured his then-girlfriend, [[Lorena Calábria]]).

He is also author of the [[short story]] books ''Ronda Noturna'' (1995), ''Dezembro de um Verão Maravilhoso'' (1999), ''Questionário'' (2005) and ''Relógio sem Sol'' (2007), and ''Meu Filho, Meu Besouro'' (2011), a [[children's poetry]] book that was also illustrated by him, and dedicated to his son.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/cultura/livros/cadao+volpato+lanca+livro+infantil/n1597120083417.html ''Cadão Volpato lança livro infantil''], iG, August 5, 2011 {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://editora.cosacnaify.com.br/ObraSinopse/11554/Meu-filho,-meu-besouro.aspx Cadão Volpato's ''Meu Filho, Meu Besouro''] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sixth work, the novel ''Pessoas que Passam pelos Sonhos'', was released in 2013; it was his first novel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishnews.com.br/telas/clipping/detalhes.aspx?id=63775 Mais perto do Brasil] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 he was nominated to the [[São Paulo Prize for Literature]], in the "Best Book of the Year – Debut Authors Over 40" category, for ''Pessoas que Passam pelos Sonhos'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://g1.globo.com/pop-arte/noticia/2014/08/premio-sao-paulo-de-literatura-anuncia-finalistas-de-2014-veja-lista.html |title=Prêmio São Paulo de Literatura anuncia finalistas de 2014; veja lista |work=G1 |date=19 August 2014 |accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, he eventually lost the prize to [[Veronica Stigger]]'s ''Opisanie swiata''. 2015 saw the release of another children's work, the picture book ''Cavalos da Chuva''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://editora.cosacnaify.com.br/ObraSinopse/2371/Cavalos-da-chuva.aspx Cosac Naify | Cavalos da Chuva] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; His eighth book, ''Os Discos do Crepúsculo'', a collection of [[Crônica|chronicles]] in which he comments about his favorite bands, singers and records, was released on March 27, 2017 through Numa Editora.

In 2015 Volpato reunited with former Fellini bandmate Thomas Pappon and formed the [[experimental rock]] duo Pappon &amp; Volpato. They have uploaded three songs as of yet for their official [[SoundCloud]] page.&lt;ref&gt;[https://soundcloud.com/user-588919713 Pappon &amp; Volpato]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 4, 2017, Volpato serves as the director of the [[Centro Cultural São Paulo]], appointed by mayor [[João Doria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cultura.estadao.com.br/noticias/musica,cadao-volpato-assume-a-direcao-do-centro-cultural-sao-paulo,10000098110|title=Cadão Volpato assume a direção do Centro Cultural São Paulo|work=[[O Estado de S. Paulo]]|date=January 4, 2017|access-date=March 28, 2018|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cadão has stated that he has used [[lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], and that the Fellini song "LSD", off the album ''[[Amor Louco]]'', was about his experiences with the drug.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.beatrix.pro.br/mofo/fellini.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

He also illustrated the front cover to Fellini's albums ''[[Fellini Só Vive 2 Vezes]]'' and ''[[Você Nem Imagina]]'', and to his own solo album.

'''Cavineña''' is an indigenous language spoken on the Amazonian plains of northern Bolivia by over 1,000 Cavineño people. Although Cavineña is still spoken (and still learnt by some children), it is an endangered language.  Guillaume (2004) states that about 1200 people speak the language, out of a population of around 1700.  Nearly all Cavineña are bilingual in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

The Cavineño people live in several communities near the Beni River, which flows north from the Andes.  The nearest towns are Reyes (to the south) and Riberalta (to the north).

==Phonology==
Cavineña has the following consonants (Guillaume 2004:27).  Where the practical orthography is different from IPA, it is shown between angled brackets:

==Morphology==

===Verbs===
Verbs do not show agreement with their arguments, but are inflected for tense, aspect, mood, negation, and aktionsart, among other categories.   There are six tense/aspect/mood affixes (Guillaume 2004):

*-ya 'imperfective' (for present, generic, habitual, and near future events)
*-wa 'perfective' (for events that occurred earlier the same day)
*-chine 'recent past' (for events that occurred between a day and a year ago)
*-kware 'remote past' (for events that occurred a year or more ago)
*-buke 'remote future' (for events far in the future)
*e-...-u 'potential' (for events that are contingent on other events)

The following examples show the remote past and perfective affixes:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|I-ke=bakwe ||[e-kwe|| e-wane=tsewe] ||kanajara-kware|| [e-kwe tujuri=ju].
|-
|1SG-FM =CONTRAST ||1SG-GEN|| 1-wife=ASSOC|| rest-REMOTE.PAST||1SG-GEN mosquito.net=LOC
|-
|colspan="9"|'Me, I was resting with my wife in my mosquito net.'
|}
{| class="wikitable"
|-
|Pakaka-wa =mi|| [manga=ju=ke].
|-
|fall-PERF =2SG(-FM) ||mango.tree=LOC=LIG
|-
|colspan='2'|'You fell from the mango tree.'
|}

Aktionsart suffixes include:

*-tere/tirya 'completive'
*-bisha 'incompletive'
*-nuka 'repeated/reiterative'

The following examples show the completive and reiterative suffixes:

{| class="wikitable"
|Shana-tirya-kware ||=tuna||[piya=kwana
|-
|leave-COMP-REM.PAST ||=3PL(-ERG)|| arrow=PL
|-
|colspan='5'|'(They ran away and) left all their arrows behind.' (Guillaume 2004:193)
|}

{| class="wikitable"
|Peadya|| tunka|| mara=kwana|| ju-atsu|| =tu || ekwita||kwa-nuka-kware ||babi=ra…
|-

|-
|colspan='9'|'After about ten years or so, the man went hunting again.' (Guillaume 2004:198)
|}

This is the only language in the Amazon that has an [[antipassive voice]].&lt;ref name=Amazonian&gt;[[R. M. W. Dixon|Dixon, R.M.W.]] &amp; [[Alexandra Aikhenvald|Alexandra Y. Aikhenvald]] (eds) (1990). ''The Amazonian Languages''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. xxvii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syntax==

===Nouns and noun phrases===

====Subtypes of nouns====
There are three subtypes of nouns in Cavineña (Guillaume 2004:71-73).
* e-nouns, which are a closed class of about 100 to 150 terms which must take a prefix e-.  (The prefix is realised as y- before the vowel a).
* kinship nouns, which are a small class of about 30 terms which are
obligatorily inflected for their possessor.
* independent nouns, which are an open class of a couple of thousand terms. Independent nouns do
not take any e- prefix nor any possessor inflections.

====Case marking====
Case marking on noun phrases is shown through a set of clitic postpositions, including the following:
*=ra 'ergative case'
*=tsewe 'associative case' (= English 'with')
*=ja 'dative case'
*=ja 'genitive case'
*=ju 'locative case'

The dative and genitive cases are homophonous.

Pronouns (independent or bound) also show these case distinctions.

The following example (Guillame 2004:526) shows several of the case markers in context:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
|I-ke=bakwe ||[e-kwe|| e-wane=tsewe] ||kanajara-kware|| [e-kwe tujuri=ju].
|-
|1SG-FM =CONTRAST ||1SG-GEN|| 1-wife=ASSOC|| rest-REMOTE.PAST||1SG-GEN mosquito.net=LOC
|-
|colspan="9"|'Me, I was resting with my wife in my mosquito net.'
|}
{| class="wikitable"
|-
|Pakaka-wa =mi|| [manga=ju=ke].
|-
|fall-PERF =2SG(-FM) ||mango.tree=LOC=LIG
|-
|colspan='2'|'You fell from the mango tree.'
|}
{| class="wikitable"
|-
|Ai =tu-ke =mi|| mare-wa?
|-
|INT =3SG-FM =2SG(-ERG)|| shoot-PERF
|-
|colspan='2'|'What did you shoot?'
|} (Guillaume 2004:599)

====Order in noun phrases====
Noun phrases show the order (Relative Clause)-(Quantifier)-(Possessor)-Noun-(Adjective)-(Plural marker)-(Relative clause) (Guillaume 2004:69).  The following examples show some of these orders.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|E-marikaka|| ebari=kwana
|-
|nounprefix-cooking:pot||big=plur
|-
|colspan="2"|'big cooking pots'
|}

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|dutya|| tunaja|| etawiki=kwana|| e-tiru=ke
|-
|all||3:plur:genitive||bedding=plur||res-burn-ligature
|-
|colspan="4"|'all their bedding that had burnt'
|}
(The clitic =ke 'ligature' appears at the end of a relative clause.)

===Pronouns===
Pronouns in Cavineña can appear in either independent or bound forms.   The two kinds of pronouns are pronounced almost exactly the same, but the bound pronouns appear in second position, after the first word of the sentence. Independent pronouns tend to be contrastive, and usually appear first in the sentence.

The following pronouns are found:

{| class='wikitable'
!colspan='4'|Absolutive pronouns
|-
!person|| SG|| DL|| PL
|-
|1|| i-Ø-ke|| ya-tse|| e-kwana
|-
|2 ||mi-Ø-ke|| me-tse|| mi-kwana
|-
|3|| tu-Ø-ke|| ta-tse|| tu-na
|-
|3PROX|| ri-Ø-ke|| re-tse|| re-na
|}
{|class='wikitable'
!colspan='4'|Ergative pronouns
|-
!person|| SG|| DL|| PL
|-
|1 ||e-Ø-ra|| ya-tse-ra|| e-kwana-ra
|-
|2 ||mi-Ø-ra|| me-tse-ra|| mi-kwana-ra
|-
|3 ||tu-Ø-ra|| ta-tse-ra|| tu-na-ra
|-
|3PROX ||riya-Ø-ra(?)|| re-tse-ra|| re-na-ra
|}
{|class='wikitable'
!colspan='4'|Dative pronouns
|-
!person|| SG|| DL|| PL
|-
|1 || e-Ø-kwe || ya-tse-ja || e-kwana-ja
|-
|2 || mi-Ø-kwe||  me-tse-ja||  mi-kwana-ja
|-
|3 || tu-Ø-ja||  ta-tse-ja||  tu-na-ja
|-
|3PROX || re-Ø-ja || re-tse-ja||  re-na-ja
|}

Guillaume (2004:597) notes that the formative suffix -ke (of singular absolutive bound pronouns) and the ergative suffix -ra (in ergative bound pronouns) do not show up when absolutive or ergative pronouns occur last among the second position clitics.

===Sentences===
Cavineña has ergative case marking on the subject of a transitive verb (Guillaume 2004:527). For sentences with a non-pronominal subject, this is shown with an ergative case clitic /=ra/:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|''Iba=ra=tu''|| ''iye-chine''|| ''takure.''
|-
|jaguar=ERG=3SG(-FM)|| kill-RECENT.PAST|| chicken
|-
|colspan='3'|'The jaguar killed the chicken.'
|}

For a sentence with a pronominal subject, there are distinct ergative and absolutive forms of the pronouns:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|I-ke=bakwe|| kwa-kware=dya=jutidya.
|-
|1SG(ABS)-FM=CONTR|| go-REM.PAST=FOC=RESTR
|-
|colspan='2'|'I just went.'
|}

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|''E-ra=tu'' ||''[e-kwe'' || ''tata-chi'']|| ''adeba-ya=ama.''
|-
|1SG-ERG =3SG(-FM) ||1SG-GEN|| father-AFFTN|| know-IMPFV=NEG
|-
|colspan='4'|'I do not know my father.' (Guillaume 2004:585)
|}

Verbs do not inflect for the person of the subject or other arguments in the clause.  Instead, a set of clitic pronouns occurs in the second position of the clause, as in the following examples (Guillaume 2004:595):

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|''Tume =tuna-ja =tu-ke =Ø'' ||''be-ti-wa'' ||''budari.''
|-
|then =3PL-DAT =3SG-FM =1SG(-ERG)||bring-GO.TEMP-PERF|| banana
|-
|colspan='3'|'I will go and bring bananas for them.'
|}

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|''Kwadisha-ya =tu-ke =e-ra =e-kwe'' ||''encomienda''||[''e-kwe'' ||''ata=ja=ishu''].
|-
|send-IMPERFECTIVE =3SG-FM =1SG-ERG =1SG-DAT ||package||1SG-GEN ||relatives=GEN=PURP.GNL
|-
|colspan='5'|'I am sending a packing to my relatives.'
|}
The clitics are ordered so that 3rd person pronouns precede 2nd person pronouns, which precede 1st person pronouns.  (Some of the clitic pronouns in these examples have a formative element /-ke/ after them and some do not.)

'''Chachapoyas''' or '''Amazonas Quechua''' is a variety of [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] spoken in the provinces of [[Chachapoyas Province|Chachapoyas]] and [[Luya Province|Luya]] in the [[Peru]]vian region of [[Amazonas Region|Amazonas]].

Chachapoyas Quechua is critically endangered, as hardly any children are now learning it. [[Conila District|Conila]] is said to be the last village where children are still able to speak it.

Chachapoyas Quechua belongs to [[Quechua II]], subgroup II-B ([[Lowland Peruvian Quechua]]).

A '''chief mate''' (C/M) or '''chief officer''', usually also synonymous with the '''first mate''' or '''first officer''' (except on [[passenger liner]]s, which often carry both), is a [[licensed mariner|licensed member]] and head of the [[deck department]] of a [[merchant ship]]. The chief mate is customarily a watchstander and is in charge of the ship's [[cargo]] and deck crew. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.edumaritime.net/stcw/general-requirements-for-chief-mate Chief Mate Requirements]&lt;/ref&gt; The actual title used will vary by ship's employment, by type of ship, by nationality, and by trade. Informally, the Chief Mate will often simply be called "The Mate". The term "Chief Mate" is not usually used in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], although Chief Officer and First Mate are.

The chief mate is responsible to the [[Sea captain|Captain]] for the safety and security of the ship. Responsibilities include the crew's welfare and training in areas such as safety, firefighting, search and rescue.

[[File:Mncb-1.JPG|thumb|Epaulettes often worn by the Chief Officer on merchant ships (similar to those worn by a commander in the Commonwealth navies)]]

==Senior on board Operations Manager==

The Chief Mate, who is the [[Second-in-command|second in command]] of the vessel, is often equated, in corporate terms, to a senior manager for the operations on board, as the Mate is in charge of a number of departmental functions. In modern cargo vessels, the Mate holds appointments like Head of Deck Department, Head of Cargo/ Stowage Operations, Head of Safety/ Fire Fighting, Head of On-Board Security (Ship Security Officer), Head of Environment and Quality, and so forth.

==Cargo Officer==

As cargo officer, a chief mate oversees the loading, stowage, securing and unloading of cargoes. Moreover, the chief mate is accountable for the care of cargo during the voyage. This includes a general responsibility for the [[Stability conditions (watercraft)|ship's stability]] and special care for cargoes that are dangerous, hazardous or harmful.

Even under the best of conditions, a ship is balanced precariously upon the water and is subject to a number of forces, such as wind, swells, and storms, which could capsize it. The cargo officer uses tools like [[Sailing ballast|ballast]]ing and [[weight distribution|load balancing]] to optimize the ship's performance for the expected type of environment.

==Watchstanding==
Traditionally, the chief mate stands a "4-8" [[watchstanding|watch]]: from 4 AM until 8 AM and 4 PM until 8 PM.,&lt;ref name="mmoh1-21"&gt;Turpin and McEwin, 1980:1-21.&lt;/ref&gt; in port and at sea, the chief mate is responsible to the captain for keeping the ship, crew, and cargo safe.   On watch, the mate must enforce all applicable regulations, such as the [[International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea]] and [[MARPOL 73/78|pollution regulations]]. In port, the watch focuses on duties such as cargo operations, fire and security watches, monitoring communications and the [[anchor]] or [[mooring (watercraft)|mooring]] lines.

IMO regulations require the officer be fluent in English. This is required for a number of reasons, such as ability to use [[nautical chart]]s and [[nautical publications]], to understand weather and safety messages, communicate with other ships and coast stations, and to be able to work with a [[multi-lingual]] crew.

==Sea watch==
At sea, the mate on watch has three fundamental duties: navigate the ship, safely avoid traffic, and respond to any emergencies that may arise. Mates generally stand watch with [[Able Seaman (occupation)|able seamen]] who act as [[helmsman]] and [[lookout]]. The helmsman executes turns and the lookout reports dangers such as approaching ships. These roles are often combined to a single helmsman/lookout and, under some circumstances, are eliminated completely. The ability to smartly handle a ship is key to safe watchstanding. A ship's [[Draft (hull)|draught]], trim, speed and under-keel clearance all affect its [[turning radius]] and stopping distance. Other factors include the effects of wind and current, squat, shallow water and similar effects. Shiphandling is key when the need arises to rescue a [[man overboard]], to anchor, or to moor the ship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

The officer must also be able to transmit and receive signals by [[Morse code|Morse]] light and to use the [[International Code of Signals]].

===Navigation===
{{Details|Navigation}}
[[File:CargoVslBadWeather.JPG|thumb|right|The conditions for navigating a ship can often be challenging.]]
[[celestial navigation|Celestial]], [[terrestrial navigation|terrestrial]], [[electronic navigation|electronic]], and [[coastal navigation]] techniques are used to fix a ship's position on a  [[nautical chart|navigational chart]]. The officer directs the [[helmsman]] to keep to track, accounting for effects of winds, [[tide]]s, [[Ocean current|currents]] and estimated speed. The officer uses supplemental information from [[nautical publications]], such as [[Sailing Directions]], [[tide table]]s, [[Notice to Mariners|Notices to Mariners]], and radio navigational warnings to keep the ship clear of danger in transit.

Safety demands the mate be able to quickly solve steering control problems and to calibrate the system for optimum performance. Since [[Compass|magnetic]] and [[gyrocompass]]es show the course to steer, the officer must be able to determine and correct for compass errors.

[[meteorology|Weather]]'s profound effect on ships requires the officer be able to interpret and apply meteorological information from all available sources. This requires expertise in weather systems, reporting procedures and recording systems.

===Traffic management===
The [[International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea]] are a cornerstone of safe watchkeeping. Safety requires that one live these rules and follows the principles of safe watchkeeping. Maximizing bridge teamwork, including the practice of [[Bridge Resource Management]], is an emerging focus in watchkeeping.

The main purpose for [[Radar]] and [[Automatic Radar Plotting Aid]]s (ARPA) on a ship's bridge is to move safely among other vessels. These instruments help to accurately judge information about prominent objects in the vicinity, such as:

* range, bearing, course and speed
* time and distance of closest point of approach
* course and speed changes

These factors help the officer apply the [[International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea|COLREGS]] to safely maneuver in the vicinity of obstructions and other ships.

Unfortunately, radar has a number of limitations, and ARPA inherits those limitations and adds a number of its own. Factors such as rain, high seas, and dense clouds can prevent radar from detecting other vessels. Further, dense traffic and course and speed changes can confuse ARPA units. Finally, human errors such as inaccurate speed inputs and confusion between true and relative vectors add to the limitations of the radar/ARPA suite.

Under the best conditions, the radar operator must be able to optimize system settings and detect divergences between an ARPA system and actual conditions. Information obtained from radar and ARPA must be treated with scrutiny: over reliance on these systems has sunk ships. The officer must understand system performance, limitations and accuracy, tracking capabilities and limitations, and processing delays, and the use of operational warnings and system tests.

===Emergencies===
Emergencies can happen at any time. The officer must be equipped to safeguard passengers and crew. The officer must be able to take initial action after a collision or a grounding. Responsibilities include performing damage assessment and control, understanding the procedures for rescuing persons from the sea, assisting ships in distress, and responding to any emergency which may arise in port.

The Chief Mate is in charge of the firefighting and damage control teams. He is scene leader and reports via radio to the Captain who is in command and coordinates the larger response from the bridge.

The officer must understand [[distress signal]]s and know the IMO Merchant Ship Search and Rescue Manual.

==Controlling ship operations==
Understanding ship's stability, trim, stress, and the basics of ship's construction is a key to keeping a ship seaworthy. The mate must know what to do in cases of flooding and loss of buoyancy. Fire is also a constant concern. Knowing the classes and chemistry of fire, fire-fighting appliances, and systems prepares the officer to act fast in case of fire.

An officer must be expert in the use of [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|survival craft]] and [[Rescue craft|rescue boat]]s. Expertise includes the vessels' launching appliances and arrangements, and their equipment including radio life-saving appliances, satellite [[Emergency position-indicating radiobeacon station|EPIRBs]], [[Search and Rescue Transponder|SART]]s, [[immersion suit]]s and thermal protective aids. It's important to be expert in the techniques for survival at sea techniques in case it's necessary to abandon ship.

Officers are trained to perform medical tasks, and follow instructions given by radio or obtained from guides. This training includes what to do in case of common shipboard accidents and illnesses.

==Licensing==

===United Kingdom===
On very large or international passenger ships it is usual for a chief/first officer to hold a master's certificate so that he can take over from the master if necessary. In the same way, a second officer may hold a chief officer's certificate.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

===United States===
[[File:Usmm-license.jpg|thumb|right|A chief mate must have a number of qualifications, including a license.]]
To become a chief mate (unlimited) in the United States, one must first accumulate at least 365 days of service while holding a [[second mate]]'s license.  Then, the candidate must attend approximately 13 weeks of classes or complete the assessments from NMC Policy Letter 04-02&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USCG NMC Policy Letter 04-02|url=http://www.uscg.mil/nmc/policy_letters/pdfs/04-02.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and pass a series of examinations given by the United States Coast Guard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USCG Deck &amp; Engine Exam Info|url=http://www.uscg.mil/nmc/training/pdfs/deck_and_engineering_guide.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, one must have worked as a third mate for 365 days to have become a second mate. There are many special cases in license upgrades at the individual level, as licensing regulations change from time to time. A sizable portion of mates still working received their licenses before current laws went into effect.

There are two methods to attain an unlimited third mate's license in the United States: to attend a specialized training institution, or to accumulate "sea time" and take a series of training classes and examinations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=3c91d4046f9587b25d46063179b29ec3;rgn=div5;view=text;node=46%3A1.0.1.2.10;idno=46;cc=ecfr#46:1.0.1.2.10.4.7.5 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Title 46, Part 10, Subpart 407]&lt;/ref&gt;

Training institutions that can lead to a third mate's license include the [[U.S. Merchant Marine Academy]] (deck curriculum), the [[U.S. Coast Guard Academy]] and [[U.S. Naval Academy]] with qualification as an underway [[Officer of the Deck|officer in charge of a navigational watch]],  any of the state maritime colleges, the [[Great Lakes Maritime Academy]], or a three-year apprentice mate training program approved by the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard.

A seaman may start the process of attaining a license after three years of service in the deck department on ocean steam or motor vessels, at least six months of which as [[able seaman]], [[boatswain]], or [[quartermaster]]. Then the seaman takes required training courses, and completes on-board assessments. Finally, the mariner can apply to the [[United States Coast Guard]] for a Third Mate's license.

A [[captain (nautical)|master]] of 1,600 ton vessels can, under certain circumstances, begin the application process for an unlimited third mate's license.

If approved the applicant must then successfully pass a comprehensive license examination before being issued the license. ''Hawsepiper'' is an informal maritime industry term used to refer to an officer who began his or her career as an unlicensed merchant seaman and did not attend a traditional maritime college/academy to earn the officer license.

A ship’s hawsepipe is the pipe passing through the bow section of a ship that the anchor chain passes through. Hawsepiper refers to climbing up the hawsepipe, a nautical metaphor for climbing up the ship's rank structure. Hawsepiper is considered a positive term when said respectfully. Many hawsepipers are proud of their background and use the term to describe themselves.

Several merchant seamen's unions offer their membership the required training to for career advancement. Similarly, some employers offer financial assistance to pay for the training for their employees. Otherwise, the mariner is responsible for the cost of the required training.

Since the requirements of STCW '95 have been enacted, there have been complaints that the hawsepiper progression path has been made too difficult because of the cost in time and money to meet formal classroom training requirements. These critics assert that the newer requirements will eventually lead to a shortage of qualified mariners, especially in places like the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2183">'''Clinical Linguistics''' is a sub-discipline of [[linguistics]] that involves the application of [[Theoretical linguistics|linguistic theory]] to the field of [[Speech-Language Pathology]]. Clinical linguistics, a branch of applied linguistics, is the use of linguistics to describe, analyze, and treat language disabilities. The study of linguistic aspect of communication disorders is of relevance to a broader understanding of language and [[linguistics|linguistic]] theory.

The [[International Clinical Phonetics and Linguistics Association]] is the unofficial organization of the field, and was formed in 1991. The journal of [[Clinical Linguistics and Phonetics]] is the major research journal of the field and was founded by [[Martin J. Ball]]. 

Practitioners of clinical linguistics typically work in Speech-Language Pathology departments or linguistics departments. They conduct research with the aims of (i) improving the assessment, treatment, and analysis of disordered speech/language, and (ii) offering insights to formal linguistic theories. While the majority of clinical linguistics journals still focus only on English linguistics, there is an emerging movement toward comparative clinical linguistics across multiple languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crystal|first=David|date=2013-04-01|title=Clinical linguistics: Conversational reflections|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.3109/02699206.2012.726312|journal=Clinical Linguistics &amp; Phonetics|volume=27|issue=4|pages=236–243|doi=10.3109/02699206.2012.726312|issn=0269-9206|pmid=23339337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5189">In [[formal language theory]], a '''cone''' is a set of [[formal language]]s that has some desirable [[closure (mathematics)|closure]] properties enjoyed by some well-known sets of languages, in particular by the families of [[regular language]]s, [[context-free language]]s and the [[recursively enumerable language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ginsburg|Greibach|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of a cone is a more abstract notion that subsumes all of these families. A similar notion is the '''faithful cone''', having somewhat relaxed conditions. For example, the [[context-sensitive language]]s do not form a cone, but still have the required properties to form a faithful cone.

The terminology ''cone'' has a French origin. In the American oriented literature one usually speaks of a ''full trio''. The ''trio'' corresponds to the faithful cone.

==Definition==
A cone is a family &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; of languages such that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; contains at least one non-empty language, and for any &lt;math&gt;L \in \mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; over some alphabet &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;,
* if &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is a [[homomorphism]] from &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^\ast&lt;/math&gt; to some &lt;math&gt;\Delta^\ast&lt;/math&gt;, the language &lt;math&gt;h(L)&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;;
* if &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is a homomorphism from some &lt;math&gt;\Delta^\ast&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^\ast&lt;/math&gt;, the language &lt;math&gt;h^{-1}(L)&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;;
* if &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is any regular language over &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;L\cap R&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;.

The family of all regular languages is contained in any cone.

If one restricts the definition to homomorphisms that do not introduce the empty word &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; then one speaks of a ''faithful cone''; the inverse homomorphisms are not restricted. Within the [[Chomsky hierarchy]], the regular languages, the context-free languages, and the [[recursively enumerable language]]s are all cones, whereas the context-sensitive languages and the recursive languages are only faithful cones.

==Relation to Transducers==

A [[finite state transducer]] is a finite state automaton that has both input and output. It defines a transduction &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, mapping a language &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; over the input alphabet into another language &lt;math&gt;T(L)&lt;/math&gt; over the output alphabet. Each of the cone operations (homomorphism, inverse homomorphism, intersection with a regular language) can be implemented using a finite state transducer. And, since finite state transducers are closed under composition, every sequence of cone operations can be performed by a finite state transducer.

Conversely, every finite state transduction &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; can be decomposed into cone operations. In fact, there exists a normal form for this decomposition,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nivat|1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is commonly known as ''Nivat's Theorem'':&lt;ref&gt;cf. {{harvtxt|Mateescu|Salomaa|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Namely, each such &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; can be effectively decomposed as
&lt;math&gt;T(L) = g(h^{-1}(L) \cap R)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;g, h&lt;/math&gt; are homomorphisms, and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a regular language depending only on &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.

Altogether, this means that a family of languages is a cone if it is closed under finite state transductions. This is a very powerful set of operations. For instance one easily writes a (nondeterministic) finite state transducer with alphabet &lt;math&gt;\{a,b\}&lt;/math&gt; that removes every second &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; in words of even length (and does not change words otherwise). Since the context-free languages form a cone, they are closed under this exotic operation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6722">A '''coordinative definition''' is a postulate which assigns a partial meaning to the theoretical terms of a  scientific theory by correlating the mathematical objects of the ''pure'' or formal/syntactical aspects of a theory with physical objects in the world. The idea was formulated by the [[logical positivists]] and arises out of a [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalist]] vision of mathematics as pure symbol manipulation. 

==Formalism==
In order to get a grasp on the motivations which inspired the development of the idea of coordinative definitions, it is important to understand the doctrine of formalism as it is conceived in the [[philosophy of mathematics]]. For the formalists, mathematics, and particularly geometry, is divided into two parts: the ''pure'' and the ''applied''. The first part consists in an uninterpreted axiomatic system, or syntactic calculus, in which terms such as ''point'', ''straight line'' and ''between'' (the so-called primitive terms) have their meanings assigned to them implicitly by the axioms in which they appear. On the basis of deductive rules eternally specified in advance, pure geometry provides a set of theorems derived in a purely logical manner from the axioms.  This part of mathematics is therefore ''a priori'' but devoid of any empirical meaning, not synthetic in the sense of Kant.

It is only by connecting these primitive terms and theorems with physical objects such as rulers or rays of light that, according to the formalist, pure mathematics becomes applied mathematics and assumes an empirical meaning. The method of correlating the abstract mathematical objects of the pure part of theories with physical objects consists in coordinative definitions. 

It was characteristic of logical positivism to consider a scientific theory to be nothing more than a set of sentences, subdivided into the class of theoretical sentences, the class of observational sentences, and the class of mixed sentences. The first class contains terms which refer to theoretical entities, that is to entities not directly observable such as electrons, atoms and molecules; the second class contains terms which denote quantities or observable entities, and the third class consists of precisely the coordinative definitions which contain both types of terms because they connect the theoretical terms with empirical procedures of measurement or with observable entities. For example, the [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of "the [[geodesic]] between two points" as correspondent to "the path of a light ray in a vacuum" provides a coordinative definition. This is very similar to, but distinct from an [[operational definition]]. The difference is that coordinative definitions do not ''necessarily'' define theoretical terms in terms of laboratory procedures or experimentation, as operationalism does, but may also define them in terms of  observable or empirical ''entities''.

In any case, such definitions (also called ''bridge laws'' or ''correspondence rules'') were held to serve three important purposes. In the first place, by connecting the uninterpreted formalism with the observation language, they permit the assignment of  synthetic content to theories. In the second, according to whether they express a factual or a purely conventional content, they allow for the subdivision of science into two parts: one factual and independent of human conventions, the other non-empirical and conventional. This distinction is reminiscent of Kant's division of knowledge into content and form. Lastly, they allow for the possibility to avoid certain vicious circles that arise with regard to such matters as the measurement of the speed of light in one direction. As has been pointed out by John Norton with regard to  [[Hans Reichenbach]]'s arguments about the nature of geometry: on the one hand, we cannot know if there are universal forces until we know the true geometry of spacetime, but on the other, we cannot know the true geometry of spacetime until we know whether there are universal forces. Such a circle can be broken by way of coordinative definition.(Norton 1992).

From the point of view of the logical empiricist, in fact, the question of the "true geometry" of spacetime does not arise, given that saving, e.g., [[Euclidean geometry]] by introducing universal forces which cause rulers to contract in certain directions, or postulating that such forces are equal to zero, does not mean saving the Euclidean geometry of ''actual'' space, but only changing the definitions of the corresponding terms. There are not really two incompatible theories to choose between, in the case of the true geometry of spacetime, for the empiricist (Euclidean geometry with universal forces not equal to zero, or non-Euclidean geometry with universal forces equal to zero), but only one theory formulated in two different ways, with different meanings to attribute to the fundamental terms on the basis of coordinative definitions. However, given that, according to formalism, interpreted or applied geometry ''does'' have empirical content, the problem is not resolved on the basis of purely conventionalist considerations and it is precisely the coordinative definitions, which bear the burden of finding the correspondences between mathematical and physical objects, which provide the basis for an empirical choice.

==Objection==
The problem is that coordinative definitions seem to  beg the question. Since they are defined in conventional, non-empirical terms, it is difficult to see how they can resolve empirical questions.  It would seem that the result of using coordinative definitions is simply to shift the problem of the geometric description of the world, for example, into a need to explain the mysterious "isomorphic coincidences" between the conventions given by the definitions and the structure of the physical world.
Even in the simple case of defining "the geodesic between two points" as the empirical phrase "a ray of light in a vacuum", the correspondence between mathematical and empirical is left unexplained.

'''DuArt Film &amp; Video''' is an [[United States|American]] film and recording studio founded in New York City by Al Young in 1922.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.duart.com/history1.htm DuArt History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430181304/http://www.duart.com/history1.htm |date=April 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DuArt has been involved with a number of films over its history, such as ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'', ''[[The Cider House Rules (film)|The Cider House Rules]]'' and ''[[Forrest Gump]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duart.com/about_credits_d.html DuArt Credits: Dailies] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227114951/http://www.duart.com/about_credits_d.html |date=December 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; pioneering in a number of filmmaking technologies. Founder Al Young built one of the earliest continuous 35-millimeter processing machines in 1927, DuArt processed the first film in [[Eastmancolor]] negative in 1950, and DuArt also worked with [[CBS Laboratories|CBS]] on [[Electronic Video Recording|EVR]] consumer video-player-based special-motion film in 1966.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Willens | first1 = Michele | title = Fading to credits | newspaper = Los Angeles Times | date = 2003-10-15 | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2003/oct/15/entertainment/et-willens15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, DuArt was presented with an [[Academy Award for Technical Achievement]] for their development of the Frame-Count cueing system. During the 1980s, the lab became an industry leader in Super-16mm blow-ups, enabling independent filmmakers the opportunity to compete in the theatrical marketplace with low-budgeted films. In 2000, owner and Chairman Irwin Young was awarded the [[Gordon E.

The '''Eleman languages''' are a [[language family|family]] of Papua New Guinea.

==Languages and classification==
The five languages of Eleman proper are clearly related. They were identified as a family by [[Sidney Herbert Ray]] in 1907, and would later be incorporated in the [[Trans–New Guinea languages|Trans–New Guinea]] classifications of [[Stephen Wurm]] (1975) and of Malcolm Ross (2005).

* ''[[Kaki Ae language|Kaki Ae]] (Tate)''
* '''Eleman''' family
**West: [[Keuru language|Keuru]], [[Opao language|Opao]], [[Orokolo language|Orokolo]]
**East: [[Toaripi language|Toaripi]], [[Tairuma language|Tairuma]] (Uaripi)

[[Purari language|Purari]] was included by Brown (1968), but the only evidence is the 1sg pronoun ''nai'', which might simply be a reflection of TNG *na.

The purported evidence for including Eleman in the Trans–New Guinea family lies in Kaki Ae.  Franklin (1995) shows regular sound correspondences between Kaki Ae and Eleman, including Kaki Ae ''n'' to Eleman *r, so Kaki Ae ''nao'' 1sg appears to be cognate with Eleman *ara, both perhaps descending from proto-TNG *na.  Likewise, Kaki Ae ''nu'u'' may reflect pTNG *nu, and the forms of the 2sg pronouns, ''ao'' and *a, are common in TNG languages. 
Ross states that the Kaki Ae isolate links Eleman proper within TNG.  However, ''[[Glottolog]]'' notes that the sound correspondences are just what would expect from loans, given the different phonologies of the languages:  Eleman has no n/l/r distinction, and Kaki Ae has no t/k distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{glottolog|kaki1249|Kaki Ae}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pronouns are as follows:

:{|
|+Eleman proper
! !!sg!!pl
|-
!1
|*ara||*ela
|-
!2
|*a||*e(u)
|-
!3

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3738">The '''fallacy of accent''' (also referred to as '''''accentus''''', from its Latin denomination, and '''misleading accent'''&lt;ref name="Damer2009" /&gt;) is a type of [[ambiguity]] that arises when the meaning of a sentence is changed by placing an unusual [[prosodic stress]],&lt;ref name="Damer2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fischer1970" /&gt; or when, in a written passage, it is left unclear which word the emphasis was supposed to fall on.&lt;ref name="Engel1994" /&gt;

==History==

Among the thirteen types of fallacies in his book ''[[Sophistical Refutations]]'', [[Aristotle]] lists a fallacy he calls {{lang|grc|[[wikt:προσῳδία|προσῳδία]]}} (''prosody''), later translated in Latin as ''[[wikt:accentus|accentus]]''.&lt;ref name="Ebbesen1981" /&gt; While the passage is considered obscure, it is commonly interpreted as referring to the ambiguity that emerges when a word can be mistaken for another by changing [[Segment (linguistics)#Suprasegmentals|suprasegmental phonemes]], which in Ancient Greek correspond to [[Ancient Greek grammar#Diacritics|diacritics]] (accents and breathings).&lt;ref name="Ebbesen1981" /&gt; Since words stripped from their diacritics do not exist in the Ancient Greek language, this notion of ''accent'' was troublesome for later commentators.&lt;ref name="Ebbesen1981" /&gt;

Whatever the interpretation, in the Aristotelian tradition the fallacy remains roughly confined to issues of [[lexical stress]]. It is only later that the fallacy came to identify shifts in prosodic stress.

==Example==
{{see also|Prosodic stress}}
''I'' didn't take the test yesterday. (Somebody else did.)&lt;br /&gt;
I ''didn't'' take the test yesterday. (I did not take it.)&lt;br /&gt;
I didn't ''take'' the test yesterday. (I did something else with it.)&lt;br /&gt;
I didn't take ''the'' test yesterday. (I took a different one.)&lt;br /&gt;
I didn't take the ''test'' yesterday. (I took something else.)&lt;br /&gt;
I didn't take the test ''yesterday''. (I took it some other day.)

'''Forkner Shorthand''' is an alphabetic [[shorthand]] created by [[Hamden L. Forkner]] and first published in 1955. Its popularity grew through the 1980s as those who needed shorthand every day (such as secretaries) began to favor the easier learning curve of alphabetic systems to the more difficult (but potentially faster) symbol-based ones. Forkner was taught in high-schools and colleges throughout North America along with comparable shorthands such as [[AlphaHand]], [[Speedwriting]], [[Stenoscript]] and [[Personal Shorthand]].

== Writing ==
Forkner is written with a handful of special symbols mixed with simplified versions of [[Cursive#English cursive|cursive longhand]] letters. A long horizontal stroke replaces ''m'' and a curved line stands for ''ing.'' The letters used are almost exclusively lower-case, written from left to right and joined in a standard cursive hand. Capital letters are used for special purposes; a detached ''T'' stands for the prefix ''trans-'' and the upper-case ''S'' represents ''s'' followed by ''t.''

===vowels===
The way Forkner represents vowels may be unique among alphabetic systems. Instead of using only ordinary cursive forms, the vowels a/o/u and short i are reduced to dots and apostrophe-like strokes and ticks, mostly written after the body of word has been made. These vowel marks can be omitted if the writer feels they are unnecessary since many words are legible without their vowels.&lt;ref name=fsfc&gt;{{cite book|title=Forkner shorthand for colleges|date=1982|publisher=Forkner/Gage|isbn=0912036443|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ordinary cursive vowels are reserved for long e, for [[diphthong]]s (e.g., ''o'' for ''ow/ou''), or as [[affix]]es (e.g. ''u'' for ''under-''). The "long i" diphthong is written as a dotless cursive i, for example, ''fine'' becomes ''fın.''&lt;ref name=fsfd&gt;{{cite book|title=Forkner shorthand for colleges|date=1982|publisher=Forkner/Gage|isbn=0912036443|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While consonants are written phonetically, vowels generally reflect their original spelling. Forkner's symbol for ''a'' might express any of the sounds represented by ''a'' in English words such as ''cat, father, ago, day.''&lt;ref name=fsfa&gt;{{cite book|title=Forkner shorthand for colleges|date=1982|publisher=Forkner/Gage|isbn=0912036443|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''oo'' sounds in ''too'' and ''book'' are represented by the ''u'' symbol. The short ''e'' sound is simply omitted: ''less'' becomes ''ls.''

===abbreviations and phrasing===
Forkner makes use of several standard shorthand features to gain additional speed: brief forms, common abbreviations, and phrasing. Brief forms are essentially shortened versions of frequent words or words potentially encountered in business letters. They are not always immediately transparent to the untrained reader, such as ''Db'' for ''distribute''. The more commonly known abbreviations, like those for the days of the week, are also used in Forkner.

The shorter brief forms (one or two letters) that follow each other in a sentence are joined together as though they were one word; this is known as phrasing. Those familiar with [[Gregg Shorthand|Gregg]] or [[Pitman Shorthand]] will recognize this feature: operating on the philosophy that the time taken to repeatedly lift the pen between short words is wasted, the words in a group such as "will you be able" are compacted into one word. Though it may sound confusing, it is always clear to the transcriber what is meant, both through context and the words most commonly found in phrases, such as "all" (''l''), "of" (''v''), "the" (–), "please" (''p''), "be" (''b''), etc.

===punctuation===
Punctuation is fairly similar to the ordinary [[longhand]] equivalents. A period is a dot and a question mark is simply ''?'' without the dot. New paragraphs are indicated with double diagonal strokes ''//''.&lt;ref name=fsfs&gt;{{cite book|title=Forkner shorthand for colleges|date=1982|publisher=Forkner/Gage|isbn=0912036443|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capitalized words, such as names, are indicated by a small check-mark placed under the word.

==Learning curve and writing speed==
Students can begin adding Forkner shortcuts to their longhand writing as soon as they begin studying the system. One experienced shorthand instructor observed, "Students get instant satisfaction because they can apply it from the beginning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alldredge|first1=Steve|title=It's Not Swahili, It's A New Shorthand|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/31397416/?terms=forkner+shorthand+vocational|accessdate=16 November 2014|work=Naples Daily News (paywalled archive)|date=29 Dec 1974|ref=newspg}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reportedly resulted in fewer students giving up on Forkner compared to other shorthand systems. One teacher told a reporter, "The highest dropout rate in the Vancouver school system is in traditional shorthand courses, yet I have never had a dropout in Forkner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shortcut to Shorthand|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&amp;dat=19690516&amp;id=sKIyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EO0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3430,5194958|accessdate=16 November 2014|work=Ottawa Citizen|date=16 May 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports from shorthand instructors indicated results such as the following: an average student can achieve 50 words per minute after a 30-hour course; most of the students who took a 9-month course in high school reached or surpassed a goal of 60 wpm;&lt;ref name="nespx"&gt;"Shorthand Studies" in ''Montreal Gazette,'' 4 August 1964&lt;/ref&gt; in an experimental class taught at Chester High School (Pennsylvania), some students were able to write 100 words per minute after three months of intensive training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Course Offering, evening classes for adults|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/20715432/?terms=forkner+shorthand+vocational|accessdate=16 November 2014|work=Delaware County Daily Times (paywalled archive)|date=14 Jan 1972|ref=newsph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forkner shorthand's relative ease of learning was investigated in several academic dissertations and theses.&lt;ref name="acada"&gt;Madsen, Julie: ''A comparison of the shorthand skills of first-year high school students using Century 21 or Forkner shorthand'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="acadb"&gt;Jensen, Kathleen A.: ''A comparison study of Gregg, Forkner, and machine shorthand to determine ease in learning, usage, and retention'' (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="acadc"&gt;Ribling, Pearl M.W.: ''A comparative study of the performance of students in Gregg shorthand, Diamond Jubilee series and Forkner shorthand in the Seattle public schools'' (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Dr. Forkner was a professor of business education at Columbia University when he began designing and testing his shorthand system. In 1955 he established the Forkner Publishing Company and issued its first book, ''Forkner alphabet shorthand: A scientific high-speed system of writing: the only system of shorthand that combines the best features of symbol systems with easily written longhand letters.'' He promoted his system at teachers' conferences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=business teachers' workshop scheduled|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/77593435/?terms=hamden+forkner+shorthand|accessdate=16 November 2014|work=The Southern Illionoisan (paywalled archive)|date=26 June 1960|ref=newspf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and helped organize some adult education classes.

In 1963 an experimental class at a Vancouver high school was successful and the school district implemented the course in 10 additional schools in September 1964. Larry Oszust, the instructor of the trial class, told a newspaper that his students had made as much progress in one year of Forkner classes as they would have made in two years of Gregg or Pitman training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Faster type of shorthand|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/67076316/?terms=forkner+shorthand|accessdate=15 November 2014|work=The Brandon Sun, Manitoba (paywalled archive)|date=5 August 1964|ref=newsp1}}&lt;/ref&gt; From that starting point, Forkner gradually spread through high schools and universities in Canada and the US, competing with other shorthand systems.

In the 1980s public interest in handwritten shorthand evaporated. Fewer and fewer schools in North America offered shorthand classes. The publication of Forkner-related books concluded in 1991 when Nelson Canada printed the final run of the ''Forkner Shorthand Dictionary.'' Manuals and dictionaries are still readily available on auction and second-hand book sites.

==Diacritic==

As a [[diacritic]], the Geresh is written immediately after (left of) the letter it modifies. It indicates three sounds native to speakers of [[modern Hebrew]] that are common in [[loan word]]s and [[slang]]: {{IPA|[dʒ]}} as in '''''j'''u'''dg'''e'', {{IPA|[ʒ]}} as in ''mea'''s'''ure'' and {{IPA|[tʃ]}} as in '''''ch'''ur'''ch'''''. In transliteration of [[Arabic]], it indicates Arabic [[phonemes]] which are usually [[allophones]] in modern Hebrew: {{IPA|[ɣ]}} is distinguished from {{IPA|[r]}} and {{IPA|[ħ]}} is distinguished from {{IPA|[χ]}}. Finally, it indicates other sounds foreign to the [[phonology]] modern Hebrew speakers and used exclusively for the transliteration of foreign words: {{IPA|[ð]}} as in '''''th'''en'', {{IPA|[θ]}} as in '''''th'''in'', {{IPA|[sˤ]}}; and, in some transliteration systems, also {{IPA|[tˤ]}}, {{IPA|[dˤ]}} and {{IPA|[ðˤ]}}.

Sometimes the Vav is indeed doubled, however not to denote {{IPA|[w]}} as opposed to {{IPA|[v]}} but rather, when [[Ktiv male|spelling without niqqud]], to denote the [[phoneme]] /v/ at a non-initial and non-final position in the word, whereas a single Vav at a non-initial and non-final position in the word in [[Ktiv male|spelling without niqqud]] denotes one of the [[phoneme]]s /u/ or /o/. To pronounce foreign words and [[loanword]]s containing the sound {{IPAblink|w}}, Hebrew readers must therefore rely on former knowledge and context, see also [[Waw (letter)#Pronunciation|pronunciation of Hebrew Vav]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yiddish origin===

Some words or suffixes with [[Yiddish]] origin or pronunciation are marked with a geresh, e.g. the [[diminutive]] [[suffix]] "לֶ׳ה" – "le", e.g. "יענקל׳ה" – "Yankale" (as in [[Yaakov Bodo|Yankale Bodo]]), or the words "חבר׳ה" – {{IPA|[ˈχevre]}}, "guys" (which is the Yiddish pronunciation of Hebrew "חברה" {{IPA|[χevˈra]}} "company"), or "תכל׳ס" – {{IPA|[ˈtaχles]}}, "down-to-earth".

==Punctuation mark==
The geresh is used as a punctuation mark in [[initialism]]s and to denote [[Numerical digit|numerals]].

===Indicating initialisms===
In [[initialism]]s, the Geresh is written after the last letter of the initialism. For example: the title גְּבֶרֶת (literally "lady") is abbreviated גב׳, equivalent to English "Mrs" and "Ms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=(Academy of the Hebrew Language)|url=http://hebrew-academy.huji.ac.il/decision5.html Hebrew Punctuation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denoting a numeral===
A Geresh can be appended after (left of) a single letter to indicate that the letter represents a [[Hebrew numeral]]. For example: ק׳&amp;lrm; represents 100. A multi-digit Hebrew numeral is indicated by the [[Gershayim]] {{angle bracket|״}}.

==Cantillation mark==
{{main|Geresh (trope)}}
As a note of [[cantillation]] in the reading of the [[Torah]], the Geresh is printed above the accented letter: &lt;span style="line-height:120%; font-size: 180%; font-family:'Times New Roman', Arial, Gisha, 'Microsoft Sans Serif', Code2000, 'Courier New', 'Ezra SIL', 'SBL Hebrew';"&gt;ב֜&lt;/span&gt;. The '''Geresh Muqdam''' (lit. "a Geresh made earlier"), a variant cantillation mark, is also printed above the accented letter, but slightly before (i.e. more to the right of) the position of the normal Geresh: &lt;span style="line-height:120%; font-size: 180%; font-family:'Times New Roman', Arial, Gisha, 'Microsoft Sans Serif', Code2000, 'Courier New', 'Ezra SIL', 'SBL Hebrew';"&gt;ב֝&lt;/span&gt;. As a cantillation mark it is also called ''Ṭères'' (טֶרֶס)&amp;lrm;.&lt;ref name="GHG15f" /&gt;

==Computer encoding==

Most keyboards do not have a key for the geresh. As a result, an [[apostrophe]] ( [[']], [[Unicode]] U+0027) is often substituted for it.

[[File:Ny-worldfair1939-noaudio.ogv|thumb|220px|Home movie made at the [[1939 Worlds Fair]] in New York.]]
A '''home movie''' is a short amateur [[film]] or [[video]] typically made just to preserve a visual record of family activities, a vacation, or a special event, and intended for viewing at home by family and friends. Originally, home movies were made on [[photographic film]] in formats that usually limited the movie-maker to about three minutes per roll of costly camera film. The vast majority of amateur film formats lacked audio, shooting [[silent film]]. 

The 1970s saw the advent of consumer [[camcorder]]s that could record an hour or two of video on one relatively inexpensive [[videotape|videocassette]] which also had audio. This was followed by digital video cameras that recorded to [[flash memory]], and most recently [[smartphones]] with video recording capability, made the creation of home movies easier and much more affordable to the average person.

The technological boundaries between home-movie-making and professional movie-making are becoming increasingly blurred as [[prosumer]] equipment often offers features previously only available on professional equipment.

In recent years, clips from home movies have been available to wider audiences through television series such as ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'', in Great Britain ''[[You've Been Framed!]]'' and Internet online video-sharing sites such as [[YouTube]]. The popularity of the Internet, and wider availability of high-speed connections has provided new ways of sharing home movies, such as video weblogs ([[vlog]]s), and [[video podcast]]s.

==History==
The development of home movie-making has depended critically on the availability of equipment and media formats ([[film stock]], [[video tape]], etc.) at prices affordable to consumers. The introduction of [[list of film formats|film formats]] suitable for amateur hobbyists began early in the history of cinematography.

===17.5 mm format===
The 17.5&amp;nbsp;mm "Birtac" format was patented by [[Birt Acres]] in 1898.&lt;ref name="marriottworld.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marriottworld.com/articles/film_history.htm|title=Marriott - Short History of Home Movies|author=|date=|website=www.marriottworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This format split the standard 35&amp;nbsp;mm film into two strips half as wide and could be loaded into the camera in daylight. Since the [[film frame]]s were also half the height of 35&amp;nbsp;mm frames, the Birtac format used only 25% of the amount of film stock used by 35&amp;nbsp;mm. The camera doubled as a printer and projector, so equipment costs were also reduced.

===9.5 mm format===
In 1922, the French firm [[Pathé Frères]] introduced a new [[9.5 mm film|film format 9.5&amp;nbsp;mm wide]] which put the [[sprocket hole]]s between the frames instead of along the sides of the film, allowing the images to occupy nearly the entire width. The resulting frames were nearly as large and clear as with the slightly later 16&amp;nbsp;mm format, which devoted much of its width to the stabilizing perforations. Used both for making home movies and for showing shortened "cinema-at-home" versions of professionally made feature films, it enjoyed popularity for several decades in Europe, including the UK, but was virtually unknown in the US.

===Safety film and the 16 mm format===
Of importance in making motion picture film practical for home use was the manufacturing option of [[safety film]] in the 1920s. The [[cellulose nitrate#Nitrate film|nitrate film]] used by professionals required caution in handling and projection because it is highly flammable. Old nitrate film in poor condition has even been known to [[spontaneous combustion|spontaneously catch fire]] if stored improperly.

The [[16 mm film|16&amp;nbsp;mm]] format, which used only safety film, was introduced by [[Eastman Kodak]] in 1923&lt;ref name="marriottworld.com"/&gt; and became a standard in the non-professional market.  Although 16&amp;nbsp;mm had the advantage that users were not tied to one equipment manufacturer, and there were obvious cost advantages compared to standard 35&amp;nbsp;mm, the advent of an even smaller and cheaper format ultimately relegated 16&amp;nbsp;mm to professional users, particularly in the educational market.

===8 mm film format and color===
[[File:Zapruder Camera.gif|thumb|220px|[[Bell &amp; Howell]] Zoomatic camera used by [[Abraham Zapruder]] that recorded the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]].]]In 1932, Kodak introduced another new format, [[8 mm film|8&amp;nbsp;mm]], now called "[[Standard 8 mm film|Standard&amp;nbsp;8]]" or "Regular&amp;nbsp;8", which put four frames into the area occupied by one standard 16&amp;nbsp;mm frame. The film usually came in 16&amp;nbsp;mm wide "Double&amp;nbsp;8" form, which ran through the camera in two passes (one in each direction) and was slit in half after processing. The "Straight&amp;nbsp;8" variant came already cut to 8&amp;nbsp;mm width. In either case, the amount of film stock used per frame was again reduced by 75%. This finally brought home movies within the reach of the average family. The smaller format also made possible smaller and more portable cameras and projectors.

The introduction of [[Kodachrome]] color [[reversal film]] for 16&amp;nbsp;mm in 1935, and for 8&amp;nbsp;mm in 1936, facilitated home color cinematography. The availability of reversal film, both black-and-white and Kodachrome, was very important to the economics of home movie-making because it avoided the expense of separate negatives and positive prints.

===Super 8 and Single-8 film formats===
The original 8&amp;nbsp;mm format was largely superseded within a few years of Kodak's 1965 introduction of [[Super 8 mm film|Super&amp;nbsp;8]] film. The Super&amp;nbsp;8 format used the same film width as standard 8&amp;nbsp;mm, but the perforations were smaller, making room for larger [[film frame|frames]] that yielded a clearer image. In addition, Super&amp;nbsp;8 film came in cartridges for easier loading into the camera. High-end Super 8 also could be purchased with a magnetic audio track, allowing for synchronized sound home movies.   &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.internetvideomag.com/Articles_2007/102607_imemories-homemovies.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-11-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428204335/http://www.internetvideomag.com/Articles_2007/102607_imemories-homemovies.htm |archive-date=2012-04-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Single-8]], a competing product from [[Fujifilm]], was also introduced in 1965. It used the same new format as Super&amp;nbsp;8 but on a thinner [[polyester]] base and in a different type of camera cartridge.

===Home video-making===
The introduction of the [[Betamax|Beta]] VCR in 1975 and [[VHS]] in 1976 heralded a revolution in the making of home movies.  Videocassettes were extremely inexpensive compared to film and they could even be erased. This had the effect of greatly increasing the hours of footage of most family video libraries. It took a few years before consumer [[video camera]]s and portable VCRs were introduced, and later combined to create [[camcorder]]s, but by that time, many consumers already had the playback equipment in their homes.

==Omnipresence and controversy==
Portability and small size of digital home movie equipment, such as camera phones and [[personal digital assistant|PDAs]] with video capabilities, has led to the banning of such devices from various places, due to privacy and security concerns.

[[Pornography|Pornographic]] movies of celebrities have been rumoured to exist for many years, but the ease of creating home movies on video has resulted in several celebrity sex tapes becoming available to the public, often without the permission of participants. The honeymoon video of [[Pamela Anderson]] and [[Tommy Lee]] from 1998 was the first highly publicized example.

Portability of digital equipment helps fuel other controversies as well, such as the incident on November 17, 2006 in which comedian [[Michael Richards]] got into a racist war of words with an audience member during his comedy club act. Large parts of the incident were captured on the camera phone of another audience member and broadcast widely.

Home movies have played important roles in controversial criminal investigations. The prime example is the [[Zapruder film]] of the 1963 assassination of U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]], accidentally captured on [[Kodachrome]] film with an 8&amp;nbsp;mm home movie camera. The film became crucial evidence for the [[Warren Commission]], which investigated the assassination. At first, only black-and-white enlargements of individual [[film frame]]s were published, and the most gruesome frame was withheld. The public did not actually see the images in motion for many years. The first showing on network television occurred in 1975.

Interactive writing has been described by Swartz (2001) as "a teaching method in which children and teacher negotiate what they are going to write and then share the pen to construct the message."  Interactive writing is a cooperative event in which text is jointly composed and written.  The teacher uses the interactive writing session to model reading and writing strategies as he or she engages children in creating text.

Interactive writing was also included by Fountas &amp; Pinnell as part of their balanced literacy framework. Similar to shared writing, interactive writing allows a teacher and students to literally "share the pen" to create a joint sentence or message. Typically used in the primary grades, interactive writing is a powerful instructional medium for teaching phonics, spelling principles, rimes, writing conventions, and other key early writing skills. This form of interactive writing is thoroughly explained and detailed in the book ''Interactive Writing: How Language &amp; Literacy Come Together, K-2'' by Andrea McCarrier, Gay Su Pinnell, and Irene Fountas. 

Others have described '''interactive writing''' differently as a method used in [[literacy teaching]], especially for young children, whereby the students have the opportunity to practice their reading, studying and writing skills in a safe and creative environment. 

In this method the teacher(s) and students write to each other, by means of letters, [[dialogue journal]]s or a message board. The students are free to choose the topic and the length of their writings. The teachers respond without correcting or criticising the spelling, grammar or writing style, but rather modelling more appropriate forms of writing.

The aim of this method is to allow children to see literacy as something meaningful and enjoyable, rather than a mind-numbing school activity. The focus is on fluency rather than accuracy. The principle behind it is 'write to learn, not learn to write'. As such it relates to the learner-centered [[whole language]] approach.

The interactive writing method has been described in books such as:

Peyton, Joy Kreeft (ed.) (1990) ''Students and Teachers Writing Together: Perspectives on Journal Writing.''

Robinson, A., L. Crawford &amp; N. Hall (1990) ''some day you will no all about me: Young Children's Explorations in the World of Letter Writing.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12290">'''Jacob Henderson''' was an Irish clergyman and [[philology|philologist]] who emigrated to the colonial Provinces of [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], then [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]], where he became a prominent land owner and church leader.

==Life before Maryland==
Very little is known about Henderson before 1710. On June 5, 1710, he was admitted to the [[Holy Orders]] by the [[Bishop of London]], [[Henry Compton (bishop)|Henry Compton]] and appointed to the [[Mission (station)|Mission]] at [[Dover, Delaware|Dover]] then part of the Province of Pennsylvania and known as ''Dover Hundred''.&lt;ref name=sprague&gt;{{cite book

In 1711, he traveled to [[Province of New York|New York]] and was apparently disturbed by what he observed in the churches there. In June 1712, he returned to England and described the state of the [[Church of England]] in New York and [[Province of New Jersey|New Jersey]] as unacceptable, and implicating [[Robert Hunter (general)|Governor Robert Hunter]]. While Hunter wrote a written rebuttal to this assessment, it served to raise Henderson's stature.&lt;ref name=sprague/&gt;

==Gathering wealth in Maryland==
In December 1712, Henderson returned to the new world after being appointed to a Mission at ''Patuxent Hundreds'' (without a [[parish]]).

Mary married Henderson in 1713, quickly establishing the man as a wealthy landowner.&lt;ref name=sprague/&gt;

===First Parish===
In 1713, St. Anne's Parish in [[Annapolis, Maryland]] had become vacant and Henderson was asked to serve there as well, despite living about {{convert|20|mi|km}} away. He served there for a year.&lt;ref name=sprague/&gt;

That same year, he and his wife built a small chapel near their residence at Belair, which was known as Henderson's Chapel or Forest Chapel.&lt;ref name=sprague/&gt;&lt;ref name=baltz/&gt;{{rp|4–9}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Queen Anne Parish and St Barnabas===
It is not clear if Rev. Johnathan White died in 1717 or was removed from the position as Rector of Queen Anne Parish.&lt;ref name=sprague/&gt; On December 17, 1717, Reverend Jacob Henderson was appointed as rector of Queen Anne Parish.&lt;ref name=warf/&gt;

==End of in Mission at Patuxent==
In 1723, the Bishop of London, Dr. [[John Robinson (1650-1723)|John Robinson]] died, and his successor, Dr. [[Edmund Gibson]] chose not to renew Henderson's appointment to the Mission. Henderson then focused exclusively on the Parish.&lt;ref name=sprague/&gt;

==Mission of the Colony==
In 1729, Henderson traveled to England for 18 months to discuss the difficulties he found in the Colonies. When he returned, he had been appointed to the overall Mission of the Colony. The clergy welcomed his return, but the [[Laity]] were bitterly opposed.&lt;ref name=sprague/&gt;

He then convened the Conventions of the Clergy on both the western and eastern shores of the Province. Over the next several years, he focused on the issue of discipline and profligacy among the clergy. This met with a great deal of resistance and by 1734, he resigned his appointment, being the last representative of the Bishop in the Colony.&lt;ref name=sprague/&gt;

==Death of his  first wife Mary, his remarriage to Mary (nee Stanton), and Holy Trinity Church==
On 19 January 1735/6, Henderson's wife Mary was buried, her death date being unknown. She was buried in Henderson's Chapel.&lt;ref name=sprague/&gt; In 1737, Henderson gave the chapel and {{convert|4|acre|m2}} of land for the use of Queen Anne's Parish called "the Glebe whereon there is a Chapple now standing." Almost 100 years later, in 1836 Henderson's Chapel became an independent congregation, [[Holy Trinity Episcopal Church (Bowie, Maryland)|Holy Trinity Episcopal Church]].&lt;ref name=sprague/&gt;&lt;ref name=baltz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

|accessdate=2007-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of his first wife Mary, Jacob Henderson secondly married Mary (Stanton) on 2 November 1740. who at the time was the widow of Robert Tyler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:F4VW-PT5|title=Maryland Marriages, 1666-1970|last=|first=|date=|website=Family Search|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was the widow successively of a Mr. Dodd and of Robert Tyler, whom she had married on 12 June 1718 as Mary [the widow] Dodd.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:F4JP-F4P|title=Maryland Marriages, 1666-1970|last=|first=|date=|website=Family Search|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later voyages to England==
By this time, Henderson had become good friends with Provincial Governor [[Samuel Ogle]].&lt;ref name=sprague/&gt; On March 30, 1737 for the sum of £500, Henderson sold three parcels of land to Ogle for him to build his Governor's estate.&lt;ref name=baltz/&gt;

On July 6, 1737, Ogle granted Henderson leave of absence from the Province for 18 months to return to England. During this leave, Henderson was elected to the [[Society for the Propagation of the Gospel]] and returned to Maryland in May 1739. Nine years later, in August 1748, Ogle granted Henderson another leave of 18 months for England. Henderson returned for the final time in April 1750.&lt;ref name=sprague/&gt;

==Death, Legacy, and Death of his second wife Mary (nee Stanton)==
Henderson died on August 27, 1751 after 34 years of service at St. Barnabas and Queen Anne. After specific bequests to family members and friends, he bequeathed the residue to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel.&lt;ref name=sprague/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The inventory of his estate was valued at 1423 pounds, 8 shillings, 8 pence. An additional inventory added another 41 pounds, 10 shillings, 9 pence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mdhistory.net/msaref10/msa_te_1_026/html/msa_te_1_026-0011.html|title=Inventory of the Rev.

==Life Sketch==

===Early life===

Jaidayal Dalmia was born on 11 December 1904 in Town of [[Chirawa]] in Rajasthan.

He started his education in [[Calcutta]] and learned [[Bengali language|Bangla]]. Later on, after moving to Chirawa he studied till matriculation.

===Business===

He learned his business from his elder brother and played a major role in establishing Dalmia Industries and later founded Dalmia Cements in 1935,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dalmiacement.com/?act=cms-page&amp;cat_id=1&amp;id=4 |title=History That Dates Back To 1935 |publisher=Dalmia Cement |date= |accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is now run by his sons and grandsons.&lt;ref name=x&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/barclayswealth/insights_gurumurthy.php?p=7&amp; |title=Barclays Wealth |publisher=Moneycontrol.com |date= |accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=y&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entrepreneurindia.in/people/coverstory/will-your-legacy-live-on/733/ |title=Will Your Legacy Live On? |publisher=Entrepreneurindia.in |date=16 January 2010 |accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 1932–33 Ramkrishna along with a businessman from [[Bihar]] Nirmalkumar Jain started a sugar mill, Jaidayal was appointed to look after the mill, with his keen interest and dedication he got the mill commissioned within short span of 1 year. Within a year one more sugar mill, Rohtas Industries Ltd was started near [[Dehri-on-sone]] at [[Dalmianagar]].  Jaidayal supported his elder brother in all his ventures and showed immense interest in the business. Later on, Dehri-on-sone was named .

In few years Ramkrishna and Jaidayal established six cement factories in, [[Dandot]], [[Dalmiapuram]], [[Rajgangpur]], [[Jind]] and one more factory at [[Karachi|Shantinagar, Karachi]]. Jaidayal played a major role in getting the machinery from Europe. He imported improved technology, which not only make his competitor's technology obsolete, he also forced Danish to reduce their price of exporting Wet Process Technology in India.

With wide interest in machinery, Jaidayal Dalmia played major role in technical functions of all the factories in Dalmianagar and other plants as well. Soon after establishing the Rajgangpur factory called Orissa Cements. Jaidayal later started fire bricks refractory in [[Rourkela]] in the year 1954.

He also entered in Aviation business and acquired interests in [[Bharat Insurance Company]] and controlling interests in [[Punjab National Bank]]. In the automotive sphere, one company of the Group, Allen Berry &amp; Co. Limited, purchased the entire lot of American surplus disposal vehicles, numbering about 50,000, after World War II. This company ran vast workshops in various parts of India till the 1950s when it was disbanded. Knowing that media played an extremely major part in the development of the nation, he acquired [[Times of India]] and started news paper in Hindi &amp; Bengali as well. He purchased Govan Bros. and ventured in Chemicals too. At the time, the Dalmia companies together ranked third among India's major industrial groups after the Tatas and the Birlas.

Shortly after the independence, the Dalmia empire was divided among Ramkrishna Dalmia, Jaidayal Dalmia and [[Sahu Shanti Prasad Jain]], son-in-law of Ramkrishna. Dalmianagar and publishing co. [[Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co. Ltd.]] was handed over to Sahu Shanti Prasad Jain and Jaidayal Dalmia got the cement factories of Rajgangpur, Dalmiapuram and two factories of Pakistan. In the year 1964 both factories in Pakistan were sold off.

Fig. 1. Block scheme of control system.  ''G''(''s'') – linear transfer function, ''f''(''e'') – single-valued, continuous, differentiable function]]

'''Kalman's conjecture''' or '''Kalman problem''' is a disproved [[conjecture]] on absolute stability of 
[[nonlinear control]] system  with one scalar nonlinearity, which belongs to the sector of linear stability.  Kalman's conjecture is a strengthening of [[Aizerman's conjecture]]
and is a special case of [[Markus–Yamabe conjecture]].  This conjecture was proven false but led to the (valid) [[Nonlinear control#Absolute stability problem|sufficient criteria on absolute stability]].

== Mathematical statement of Kalman's conjecture (Kalman problem)==
In 1957 [[R. E. Kalman]] in his paper
&lt;ref name=1957-Kalman&gt;{{cite journal
 | author = Kalman R.E. 
 | year = 1957
 | title = Physical and Mathematical mechanisms of instability in nonlinear automatic control systems 
 | journal = Transactions of ASME
 | volume = 79
 | number = 3
 | pages = 553&amp;ndash;566
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; stated the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If ''f''(''e'') in Fig. 1 is replaced by constants ''K'' corresponding to all possible values of ''f''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;(''e''), and it is found that the closed-loop system is stable for all such ''K'', then it intuitively clear that the system must be monostable; i.e., all transient solutions will converge to a unique, stable critical point.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kalman's statement can be reformulated in the following conjecture:&lt;ref name=2011-DAN-Kalman&gt;{{cite journal
 |author1=Leonov G.A. |author2=Kuznetsov N.V. | year = 2011
 | title = Algorithms for Searching for Hidden Oscillations in the Aizerman and Kalman Problems
 | journal = Doklady Mathematics
 | volume = 84
 | number = 1
 | pages = 475&amp;ndash;481
| url = http://www.math.spbu.ru/user/nk/PDF/2011-DAN-Absolute-stability-Aizerman-problem-Kalman-conjecture.pdf 
 | doi = 10.1134/S1064562411040120}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Consider a system with one scalar nonlinearity''
:&lt;math&gt;  
  \frac{dx}{dt}=Px+qf(e),\quad e=r^*x \quad x\in R^n,
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''P'' is a constant ''n''×''n'' matrix, ''q'', ''r'' are constant ''n''-dimensional vectors, ∗ is an operation of transposition, ''f''(''e'') is scalar function, and ''f''(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. Suppose, ''f''(''e'') is a differentiable function and the following condition''
:&lt;math&gt;
 k_1 &lt; f'(e)&lt; k_2. \,
&lt;/math&gt;
is valid. Then Kalman's conjecture is that the system is stable in the large (i.e. a unique stationary point is a global [[attractor]]) if all linear systems with ''f''(''e'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ke'', ''k''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;(''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are asymptotically stable.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[Aizerman's conjecture]] in place of the condition on the derivative of nonlinearity it is required that the nonlinearity itself belongs to the linear sector.

Kalman's conjecture is true for ''n''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;3 and for ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;3 there are effective methods for construction of counterexamples:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; the nonlinearity derivative belongs to the sector of linear stability, and a unique stable equilibrium coexists with a stable periodic solution ([[hidden oscillation]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22395">The philologist and author [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] created a number of [[constructed language]]s, including [[Fictional language|languages devised for fictional settings]]. Inventing languages  (called ''[[glossopoeia]]'' by Tolkien, from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] γλώσσα glôssa, "language, tongue" and ποιῶ poiô, "to make" paralleling his idea of ''[[mythopoeia]]'' or myth-making) was a lifelong occupation for Tolkien, starting in his teens.&lt;ref&gt;in his early teens, Tolkien was first acquainted with the idea of a constructed language in the form of ''Animalic'', an invention of his cousins, Mary and Marjorie Incledon. At that time, he was studying [[Latin]] and [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]].  Mary and others, including Tolkien himself, later invented a new and more complex language called ''Nevbosh''. The next constructed language he came to work with, ''Naffarin'', would be his own creation. [http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/vice.htm Tolkien's Not-So-Secret Vice]
[https://web.archive.org/web/20131224110153/http://lordfingulfin.webs.com/earlierlanguages.htm Tolkien's Languages | The Tongues of Middle-Earth]&lt;/ref&gt;
An early project of Tolkien was the reconstruction of an unrecorded early [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]] which might have been spoken by the people of ''[[Beowulf]]'' in the [[Germanic heroic age]].&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien's name for himself in ''Gautistk'' was ''Undarhruiménitupp''.
J. Garth, ''Tolkien and the Great War''. p. 17.
Andrew Higgins, [http://www.signumuniversity.org/eagle/2015-01/in-dembith-pengoldh/ In Dembith Pengoldh A column on Tolkien’s invented languages] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304140355/http://signumuniversity.org/eagle/2015-01/in-dembith-pengoldh/ |date=2016-03-04 }} (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

The most-developed project of Tolkien was his [[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)|Elvish languages]]. He first started 
constructing an ''Elvin tongue'' in  {{circa|1910–1911}} while he was at the [[King Edward's School, Birmingham]]. He later called it [[Quenya]] ({{circa|1915}}), and he continued actively developing the history and grammar of his Elvish languages until his death in 1973.

In 1931, he held a lecture about his passion for constructed languages, titled ''[[A Secret Vice]]''. Here he contrasts his project of [[artistic language]]s constructed for aesthetic pleasure with the pragmatism of [[international auxiliary language]]s. The lecture also discusses Tolkien's views on [[phonaesthetics]], citing Greek, [[Finnish language|Finnish]], and [[Welsh language|Welsh]] as examples of "languages which have a very characteristic and in their different ways beautiful word-form".

Tolkien's glossopoeia has two temporal dimensions: the internal (fictional) timeline of events described in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and other writings, and the external timeline of Tolkien's own life during which he often revised and refined his languages and their fictional history.

==Inspiration and background==
Tolkien was a professional [[philologist]] of ancient [[Germanic languages]], specialising in [[Old English language|Old English]]. He was also interested in many languages outside his field, and developed a particular love for the [[Finnish language]]. He described the finding of a Finnish grammar book as "like discovering a complete wine-cellar filled with bottles of an amazing wine of a kind and flavour never tasted before".&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien]]'', letter number 163 (to [[W. H. Auden]], 7th June 1953).&lt;/ref&gt;

Glossopoeia was Tolkien's hobby for most of his life. At a little over 13, he helped construct a sound substitution cypher known as Nevbosh,&lt;ref name="M&amp;C_200"&gt;{{Harvnb|Monsters &amp; Critics|loc=200|Ref=Monsters and the Critics}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'new nonsense', which grew to include some elements of actual invented language. Notably, Tolkien claimed that this was not his first effort in invented languages.&lt;ref name="M&amp;C_203"&gt;{{Harvnb|Monsters &amp; Critics|loc=203|Ref=Monsters and the Critics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, he developed a true invented language called Naffarin&lt;ref name="M&amp;C_209"&gt;{{Harvnb|Monsters &amp; Critics|loc=209|Ref=Monsters and the Critics}}&lt;/ref&gt; which contained elements that would survive into his later languages, which he continued to work on until his death more than 65 years later. Language invention had always been tightly connected to the mythology that Tolkien developed, as he found that a language could not be complete without the history of the people who spoke it, just as these people could never be fully realistic if imagined only through English and as speaking English. Tolkien therefore took the stance of a translator and adaptor rather than that of the original author of his works.

==Language and mythology==
Tolkien was of the opinion that the invention of an [[artistic language]] in order to be convincing and pleasing must include not only the language's [[historical linguistics|historical development]], but also the history of its speakers, and especially the [[mythology]] associated with both the language and the speakers. It was this idea that an "Elvish language" must be associated with a complex history and mythology of the [[Elves (Middle-earth)|Elves]] that was at the core of the development of [[Tolkien's legendarium]].

Tolkien wrote in one of his letters: "what I think is a primary 'fact' about my work, that it is all of a piece, and fundamentally linguistic in inspiration. ... It is not a 'hobby', in the sense of something quite different from one's work, taken up as a relief-outlet. The invention of languages is the foundation. The 'stories' were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse. To me a name comes first and the story follows. I should have preferred to write in ‘Elvish’. But, of course, such a work as ''The Lord of the Rings'' has been edited and only as much 'language' has been left in as I thought would be stomached by readers. (I now find that many would have liked more.) ... It is to me, anyway, largely an essay in 'linguistic aesthetic', as I sometimes say to people who ask me 'what is it all about'."&lt;ref&gt;''The Letters of J.R.R.Tolkien'', pp. 219–220&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Elvish languages remained at the center of Tolkien's attention, the requirements of the narratives associated with [[Middle-earth]] also necessitated the development at least superficially of the languages of other races, especially of [[Dwarves (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] and [[Men (Middle-earth)|Men]], but also the [[Black Speech]] designed by [[Sauron]], the main antagonist in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. This latter language was designed to be the ostensible antithesis of the ideal of an artistic language pursued with the development of [[Quenya]], the Black Speech representing a dystopian parody of an international auxiliary language just as Sauron's rule over the [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]] is a dystopian parody of a totalitarian state.

== Elvish languages ==
{{main|Elvish languages (Middle-earth)}}
The [[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)|Elvish language]] family is a group of languages related by descent from a common ancestor, called the proto-language. Tolkien constructed the family from around 1910, working on it up to his death in 1973. He constructed the grammar and vocabulary of at least fifteen languages and dialects in roughly periods:
* 1910 – {{circa|1930}}: most of [[Primitive Quendian]] the proto-language, [[Common Eldarin]], [[Quenya]] and [[Goldogrin]].
* {{circa|1935–1955}}: Goldogrin had significantly changed and was now [[Noldorin]], joined by [[Telerin]], [[Ilkorin]], Doriathrin and the [[Avari (Middle-earth)#Avarin.2C the language of the Avari|Avarin]].
* The late and mature stage dispensed with Ilkorin and Doriathrin.  Noldorin matured into [[Sindarin]].

Although the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elvish]] languages [[Sindarin]] and [[Quenya]] are the most famous and the most developed of the languages that Tolkien invented for his Secondary World, they are by no means the only ones. They belong to a family of Elvish languages, that originate in [[Common Eldarin]], the language common to all [[Eldar (Middle-earth)|Eldar]], which in turn originates in [[Primitive Quendian]], the common root of Eldarin and [[Avari (Middle-earth)|Avari]]n languages.

Finnish morphology (particularly its rich system of [[inflection]]) in part gave rise to Quenya. Another of Tolkien's favourites was [[Welsh language|Welsh]], and features of Welsh phonology found their way into Sindarin. Very few words were borrowed from existing languages, so that attempts to match a source to a particular Elvish word or name in works published during his lifetime are often very dubious.

==''Lhammas'' and Valarin==
Tolkien had worked out much of the etymological background of his Elvish languages during the 1930s (collected in the form of ''[[The Etymologies (Tolkien)|The Etymologies]]''). 
In 1937, he wrote the ''[[Lhammas]]'', a linguistic treatise addressing the relationship of not just the Elvish languages, but of all languages spoken in [[Middle-earth]] during the [[First Age]]. 
The text purports to be a translation of an Elvish work, written by one [[Pengolodh]], whose historical works are presented as being the main source of the narratives in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' concerning the First Age.

The ''Lhammas''  exists in two versions, the shorter one being called the ''Lammasathen''.&lt;ref&gt;Both are published, as edited by [[Christopher Tolkien]], in ''The Lost Road''.

*[[Oromëan]], named after [[Oromë]], who taught the first [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] to speak. All languages of Elves and most languages of [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]] are Oromëan.
*[[Aulëan]], named after [[Aulë]], maker of the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]], is the origin of the [[Khuzdul]] language. It has had some influences on the tongues of Men.
*Melkian, named after the rebellious [[Morgoth|Melkor]] or Morgoth, is the origin in the First Age of the many tongues used by the [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]] and other evil beings. (This tongue is unrelated to the [[Black Speech]] of Sauron.)

Tolkien later revised this internal history to the effect that the Elves
had been capable of inventing language on their own, before coming into contact with Valarin  (see [[Primitive Quendian]]).

==''The Lord of the Rings''==
When working on ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' during the 1940s, Tolkien invested great effort into detailing the linguistics of [[Middle-earth]].

===Mannish languages===
As ''The Lord of the Rings'' was intended to represent as a sequel to ''[[The Hobbit]]'', which had not originally been intended to form part of the legendarium and used [[Old Norse]] names for the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]], Tolkien came up with a literary device of real languages "translating" fictional languages. 
This meant that a considerable number of additional constructed languages were envisaged, but none of them became as well developed as the family of Elvish languages.
In the ''Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien adopted the literary device of claiming to have translated the original Sôval Phârë speech (or [[Westron]] as he called it) into English. This device of rendering an ''imaginary'' language with a ''real'' one was carried further:
* rendering [[Rohirric]], the language of Rohan (related to Sôval Phâre) by [[Old English]]
* rendering names in the tongue of [[Dale (Middle-earth)|Dale]] by [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] forms
* and rendering names of the [[Kingdom of Rhovanion]] by [[Gothic language|Gothic]] forms
thus mapping the genetic relation of his fictional languages on the existing historical relations of the [[Germanic languages]]. Furthermore, to parallel the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] [[substratum]] in England, he used [[Old Welsh]] names to render the [[Dunlending|Dunlendish]] names of [[Buckland (Middle-earth)|Buckland]] Hobbits (e.g., [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Meriadoc]] for Kalimac).

In addition to that, there is a separate language family that is spoken by [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]], the most prominent member of which was [[Westron]] (derived from the [[Númenórean]] speech [[Adûnaic]]), the "Common speech" of the peoples of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Most Mannish tongues showed influences by Elvish, as well as some Dwarvish influences. Several independent languages were drafted as well, an example being [[Khuzdul]], the language of the Dwarves. Other languages are [[Valarin]] (the tongue of the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]]), and the [[Black Speech]] created by [[Sauron]] in the Second Age.

Because of the device Modern English representing Westron, there was no necessity to actually work out the details of Westron grammar or vocabulary in any detail, but Tolkien does give some examples of Westron words in Appendix F to ''The Lord of the Rings'', where he also summarizes its origin and role as ''[[lingua franca]]'' in Middle-earth:
:"The language represented in this history by English was the Westron or 'Common Speech' of the West-lands of Middle-earth in the Third Age. In the course of that age it had become the native language of nearly all the speaking-peoples (save the Elves) who dwelt within the bounds of the old kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor ... At the time of the War of the Ring at the end of the age these were still its bounds as a native tongue." (Appendix F)

Other "Mannish" languages envisaged for the setting of ''The Lord of the Rings'', but barely developed in terms of grammar or vocabulary, include [[Haladin]], [[Dunlendish]], [[Drûg]], [[Haradrim]], and [[Easterlings|Easterling]].

===Dwarvish===
Some samples of the language of the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]], called  [[Khuzdul]], are also found in ''The Lord of the Rings''. The situation here is a little different from the "Mannish" languages: As ''Khuzdul'' was kept secret by the Dwarves and never used in the presence of outsiders (not even Dwarvish given names), it was not "translated" by any real-life historical language, and such limited examples as there are in the text are given in the "original". 
Khuzdul was designed to have a "Semitic" affinity, with a system of [[Triliteral|triconsonantal root]]s and other parallels especially to [[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]], just as some aspects of the Dwarves and the [[Jews]] are intentional.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien noted some similarities between Dwarves and Jews: both were "at once natives and aliens in their habitations, speaking the languages of the country, but with an accent due to their own private tongue". {{ME-ref|Letters|#176}}  Tolkien also commented of the Dwarves that "their words are Semitic obviously, constructed to be Semitic." {{cite news|url=http://www.reocities.com/Area51/Shire/5014/interview.html |title=An Interview with J.R.R. Tolkien |date=January 1971 |work=[[BBC Four]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adûnaic==
{{main|Adûnaic}}
Tolkien devised [[Adûnaic]] (or Númenórean), the language spoken in [[Númenor]], shortly after World War II, and thus at about the time he completed ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', but before he wrote the linguistic 
background information of the Appendices.
Adûnaic is intended as the language from which [[Westron]] (also called ''Adûni'') is derived.
This added a depth of historical development to the Mannish languages.
Adûnaic was intended to have a "faintly Semitic flavour".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sauron Defeated]]'', p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;
Its development began with   ''[[The Notion Club Papers]]'' (written in 1945). It is there that the most extensive sample of the language is found, revealed to one of the (modern-day) protagonists, Lowdham, of that story in a visionary dream of [[Atlantis]]. Its grammar is sketched in the unfinished "Lowdham's Report on the Adunaic Language".
 
Tolkien remained undecided whether the language of the [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]] of Númenor should be derived from the original Mannish language (as in Adûnaic), or if it should be derived from  "the Elvish Noldorin" (i.e. [[Quenya]]) instead.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings]]''  it is implied that 
the Númenóreans spoke Quenya, and that [[Sauron]], hating all things Elvish, taught the Númenóreans the old Mannish tongue they themselves had forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Road and Other Writings'' (1996), p. 68 and note p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artificial scripts ==

Being a skilled penman, Tolkien not only invented many languages but also scripts. Some of his scripts were designed for use with his constructed languages, others for more practical ends: to be used in his personal diary, and one especially for English, the ''New English Alphabet''.&lt;ref&gt;W. Hammond, C. Scull, ''[[J. R. R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator]]'', p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a list of scripts in chronological order:{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}
* Tengwar of Rúmil or [[Sarati]]
* [[Cirth#Gondolinic Runes|Gondolinic Runes]]
* Valmaric script
* Andyoqenya
* Qenyatic
* The New English Alphabet
* The "Goblin alphabet" (in ''[[The Father Christmas Letters]]'')
* [[Tengwar]] of [[Fëanor]]
* The [[Cirth]] of Daeron

==Reception and study==
{{See|Tolkien studies}}

The first published monograph dedicated to the Elvish languages was ''An Introduction to Elvish'' (1978) edited by Jim Allan (published by Bran's Head Books).  It is composed of articles written before the publication of ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.

With the publication of much linguistic material during the 1990s, especially in the ''[[History of Middle-earth]]'' series, 
and the ''[[Vinyar Tengwar]]'' and ''[[Parma Eldalamberon]]'' material published at an increasing rate during the early 2000s from the stock of linguistic material in the possession of the appointed [[Elvish Linguistic Fellowship|team of editors]] (some 3000 pages according to them),&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|Solopova|p. 90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=by0dzzQ6m8sC&amp;pg=PA403 |first=Jason |last=Fisher |chapter=Manuscripts by Tolkien |page=403 |title=J.R.R.

the subject of Tolkien's constructed languages has become much more accessible.

[[David Salo]] wrote ''A Gateway to Sindarin: A Grammar of an Elvish Language from J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings'' (University of Utah Press, 2007). [[Elizabeth Solopova]], ''Languages, Myth and History: An Introduction to the Linguistic and Literary Background of J. R. R. Tolkien's Fiction'' (New York City: North Landing Books, 2009) gives an overview of the linguistic traits of the various languages invented by Tolkien and the history of their creation.

A few fanzines were dedicated to the subject, like ''Tyalië Tyelelliéva'' published by Lisa Star, and ''Quettar'', the Bulletin of the Linguistic Fellowship of The Tolkien Society, published by Julian C. Bradfield. ''Tengwestië'' is an online publication of the [[Elvish Linguistic Fellowship]].

Internet mailing lists and forums dedicated to Tolkien's constructed languages include Tolklang, Elfling and Lambengolmor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tolklang.quettar.org/ |title=The Tolkien Language List |accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elfling.midgardsmal.com/ |title=Elfling |accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elvish.org/LambengolmorList/ |title=The Lambengolmor List |publisher=Elvish Linguistic Fellowship |accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2005, there has been an International Conference on J.R.R. Tolkien's Invented Languages, part of a series of biennial conferences at changing locations. They are open to everyone with a serious interest in Tolkien's invented languages. Attendees are encouraged to prepare, bring, and deliver a paper on any aspect of Tolkien's languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://omentielva.com/index.htm|title=Omentielva|website=omentielva.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a past conference, held in Valencia in 2011, Helge K.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14920">'''Linguistic determinism''' is the idea that language and its structures limit and [[Determinism|determine]] human knowledge or thought, as well as thought processes such as [[categorization]], [[memory]], and [[perception]]. The term implies that people who speak different languages as their [[mother tongues]] have different thought processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hickmann|first=Maya|title=Linguistic relativity and linguistic determinism: some new directions|journal=Linguistics|year=2000|volume=38|issue=2|page=410|doi=10.1515/ling.38.2.409}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Linguistic determinism is the ''strong'' form of [[linguistic relativity]] (popularly known as the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis), which argues that individuals experience the world based on the structure of the language they habitually use. 

Though it played a considerable role historically, linguistic determinism is now discredited among mainstream linguists.{{sfn|Ahearn|2011|page=69}}

==Overview==
The principle of linguistic relativity (or, in other words, the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis) in its strong deterministic form first found its clear expression in writings of [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]]. 

The term "Sapir–Whorf hypothesis” is considered a misnomer by linguists and academics, because [[Edward Sapir]] and Benjamin Lee Whorf never co-authored any works (although they did work together, Sapir being Whorf’s mentor), and never stated their ideas in terms of a hypothesis. The distinction between a weak and a strong version of this hypothesis is also a later invention; Sapir and Whorf never set up such a dichotomy, although often in their writings their views of this relativity principle are phrased in stronger or weaker terms. &lt;ref&gt;Hill, Jane H; Mannheim, Bruce (1992), "Language and World view", Annual Review of Anthropology, 21: 381–406, doi:10.1146/annurev.an.21.100192.002121&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennison, Shelia (2013). Introduction to language development. Los Angeles: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; The two linguists were nevertheless among the first to formulate the principle of linguistic relativity.

Sapir exercised the idea that language is essential to understanding one’s worldview and that difference in language implies a difference in social reality. Though he never directly explored how language affects thought, significant traces of the linguistic relativity principle underlie his perception of language.&lt;ref&gt; Sapir, Edward (1929), "The status of linguistics as a science", Language, 5 (4): 207, doi:10.2307/409588, JSTOR 409588&lt;/ref&gt;

Whorf took further and reformulated Sapir’s thought in his essay “Science and Linguistics”.  His take on linguistic relativity was more radical: in Whorf’s view, the relationship between language and culture was a deterministic one and language played a crucial role in our perception of reality. Language is what gives the thought its expression and thus shapes it; in other words, thinking is determined by language. In "Science and Linguistics" Whorf stated that:

{{quote|"It was found that the background linguistic system (in other words, the grammar) of each language […] is itself the shaper of ideas, the program and guide. […] We dissect nature along the lines laid down by our native languages. 

[…] This fact is very significant for modern science, for it means that no individual is free to describe nature with absolute impartiality […]. We are thus introduced to a new principle of relativity, which holds that all observers are not led by the same physical evidence to the same pictures of the universe, unless the linguistic backgrounds are similar, or can in some way be calibrated."&lt;ref&gt;Whorf, B.L. (1956). "Science and Linguistics". In Carroll, J.B. Language, Thought, and Reality: Selected Writings of Benjamin Lee Whorf. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press. pp. 212–214. ISBN 0-262-73006-5&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Whorf, formulation of ideas and thoughts is not a rational independent process but is determined by particular grammar and vocabulary of the language in which these ideas are expressed. The world around is organized and made sense of by us through language.

===Supporting Arguments===

Whorf’s conclusion was largely based upon a close examination and extensive study of the [[Hopi]] Indian language. During earlier years, Whorf published a number of essays in which he analyzed various linguistic aspects of Hopi. For example, a work called “An American Indian model of the universe” (1936) explores the implications of the Hopi verb system with regard to conception of space and time. 

In the course of his research, Whorf noticed that Hopi and some other languages ([[Hebrew]], [[Aztec]] and [[Mayan languages|Maya]]) were built on a different plan from that of English and many other languages which he called SAE ([[Standard Average European]]) languages. He discovered a number of significant features differentiating Hopi from SAE languages that led him to the idea of linguistic determinism.

For example, Hopi is a ‘timeless’ language, whose verbal system lacks tenses. Its assessment of time is different from SAE linear temporal view of past, present and future and varies with each observer:

{{quote|"The timeless Hopi verb does not distinguish between the present, past and future of the event itself but must always indicate what type of validity the speaker intends the statement to have."&lt;ref&gt;Whorf, B.L. (1956). "Science and Linguistics". In Carroll, J.B. Language, Thought, and Reality: Selected Writings of Benjamin Lee Whorf. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press. pp. 217. ISBN 0-262-73006-5&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hopi time is non-dimensional and cannot be counted or measured in a way SAE languages measure it, i.e. the Hopi will not say “I stayed six days,” but “I left on the sixth day.” What is crucial in their perception of time is whether an event can be warranted to have occurred, or to be occurring, or to be expected to occur. Hopi grammatical categories signify view of the world as an ongoing process, where time is not divided into fixed segments so that certain things recur, e.g. minutes, evenings, or days. The linguistic structure of SAE languages, on the other hand, gives its speakers more fixed, objectified and measurable understanding of time and space, where they distinguish between countable and uncountable objects and view time as a linear sequence of past, present, and future. 

Whorf argues that this and numerous other differences imply a different way of thinking. Since thought is expressed and transmitted through language, it follows that a differently structured language must shape thought along its lines, thus influencing perception. Consequently, a Hopi speaker who perceives the world through the medium of his language must see reality through the patterns laid down by its linguistic structure. 

Other studies supporting the principle of linguistic determinism have shown that people find it easier to recognize and remember shades of colors for which they have a specific name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=D'Andrade|first=Roy|title=The development of cognitive anthropology|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780521459761}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there are two words in Russian for different shades of blue, and Russian-speakers are faster at discriminating between the shades than are English-speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Winawer, Jonathan (2007). "Russian blues reveal effects of language on color discrimination." PNAS. 104 (19) 7780-7785; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0701644104&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistic determinism can also be evident in situations where the means of drawing attention to a certain aspect of an experience is language. For example, in French, Spanish or Russian there are two ways to address a person because those languages have two second person pronouns – singular and plural. The choice of the pronoun depends on the relationship between the two people (formal or informal) and the degree of familiarity between them. In this respect, the speaker of any of those languages is always thinking about the relationship when addressing another person and therefore unable to separate those two processes.&lt;ref&gt;Comrie, Bernard (2012). "Language and Thought." Linguistic Society of America Linguistic Society of America. https://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/language-and-thought&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the Daniel Everett study analyzing conception of numbers in the Brazilian [[Pirahã people]]. These individuals could not conceive numbers beyond 'one' and 'two', for which there are no actual terms in their language. After this all numbers are grouped under the term 'many.' Even after being taught in the Portuguese language for eight months, not one individual could count to ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bower |first1=Bruce |title=The pirahá challenge: An Amazonian tribe takes grammar to a strange place |journal=Science News |date=2005 |volume=168 |issue=24 |pages=376–377 |doi= 10.2307/4017032 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===

However, linguistic determinism has been widely criticized for its absolutism and refuted by linguists. For instance, Michael Frank et. al continued Daniel Everett’s research and ran further experiments on the Pirahã published in "Numbers as a cognitive technology," and found that Everett was wrong, the Pirahã did not have words for "one," or "two," but instead had words for "small," "somewhat larger," and "many." 

Another argument against the principle of linguistic determinism is that humans are able to perceive objects and events that have no corresponding words in our mental lexicon, even if existing linguistic representations would make the perception easier. Opponents of the theory maintain that thought exists prior to any conception of language. Steven Pinker's theory embodies this idea. He proposed that all individuals are first capable of a "universal mentalese", of which all thought is composed prior to its linguistic form. Language then enables us to articulate these already existing thoughts into words and linguistic concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pinker |first1=Steven |title=The Language Instinct |date=2007 |publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics |location=New York |accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, one may perceive different colors even while missing a particular word for each shade, like New Guinea aborigines can distinguish between the colors green and blue even though they have only one lexical entry to describe both colors.&lt;ref&gt;Masharov, Mikhail (2006). "Linguistic relativity: does language help or hinder perception?" Current biology: CB, ISSN: 0960-9822, Vol: 16, Issue: 8, Page: R289-91&lt;/ref&gt; In communities where language does not exist to describe color it does not mean the concept is void – rather the community may have a description or unique phrase to determine the concept. Everett describes his research into the Pirahã tribe who use language to describe color concepts in a different way to English speakers: “[…] each word for color in Pirahã was actually a phrase. For example, biísai did not mean simply ‘red’. It was a phrase that meant ‘it is like blood’.” &lt;ref&gt;Everett, D. (2013). Language, Culture and Thinking. London: Profile Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, in its strong version ‘Whorfian hypothesis’ of linguistic determination of cognition has been refuted. In its weaker form, however, the proposal that language influences our thinking has frequently been discussed and studied.&lt;ref&gt;Masharov, Mikhail (2006). "Linguistic relativity: does language help or hinder perception?" Current biology : CB, ISSN: 0960-9822, Vol: 16, Issue: 8, Page: R289-91&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in literary theory==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2013}}
Linguistic determinism is a partial assumption behind a number of recent{{when|date=October 2013}} developments in [[rhetoric]] and [[literary theory]]. For example, French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]]'s dissected the terms of "paradigmatic" hierarchies (in language structures, some words exist only with [[antonym]]s, such as light/dark, and others exist only with relation to other terms, such as father/son and mother/daughter; Derrida targeted the latter). He believed that if one breaks apart the hidden hierarchies in language terms, one can open up a "lacuna" in understanding, an "aporia," and free the mind of the reader/critic. Similarly, [[Michel Foucault]]'s [[New Historicism|New Historicism theory]] posits that there is a quasi-linguistic structure present in any age, a metaphor around which all things that can be understood are organized. This "[[episteme]]" determines the questions that people can ask and the answers they can receive. The episteme changes historically: as material conditions change, so the mental tropes change, and vice versa. When ages move into new epistemes, the science, religion, and art of the past age look absurd. Some [[Neo-Marxist]] historians{{who|date=April 2014}} have similarly looked at culture as permanently encoded in a language that changes with the material conditions. As the environment changes, so too do the language constructs.

==Experimental languages==
{{main|Experimental languages}}

The possibility of linguistic determinism has been explored by a variety of authors, mostly in [[science fiction]]. There exist some languages, like [[Loglan]], [[Ithkuil]] and [[Toki Pona]] for instance, which have been constructed for the purpose of testing the assumption. However, no formal tests appear to have been done.

'''Louisiana French''' ({{lang-fr|français de la Louisiane}}, [[Louisiana Creole]]: ''françé la lwizyàn'') refers to the complex of dialects and [[Varieties of French|varieties of the French language]] spoken traditionally in colonial [[Lower Louisiana]]. As of today Louisiana French is primarily used in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Louisiana]], specifically in the southern parishes, though substantial minorities exist in southeast [[Texas]] as well. Over the centuries, the language has incorporated some words of African, Spanish, Native American and English origin, sometimes giving it linguistic features found only in Louisiana,&lt;ref&gt;Carl A. Brasseaux, ''French, Cajun, Creole, Houma: A Primer on Francophone Louisiana''. Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 2005. Alcée Fortier.

''Working papers in linguistics'', 9(2), 2003. 77–90.&lt;/ref&gt; but it remains [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with other forms of the [[French language]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Louisiana French: As Spoken in Cajun, Creole, and American Indian Communities|last=Valdman|first=Albert|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|year=2009|isbn=978-1604734034}}&lt;/ref&gt; Figures from the [[United States Census]] record that roughly 3.5% of Louisianans over the age of 5 report speaking French or a [[French-based creole]] at home.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/language/data/acs/TablesAFig5.xls&lt;br&gt;For 1990 figures, see https://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/language/data/census/table4.txt&lt;/ref&gt; Distribution of these speakers is uneven, however, with the majority residing in the south-central region known as Acadiana. Some of the Acadiana parishes register francophone populations of 10% or more of the total, with a select few (such as Vermilion, Evangeline and St. Martin Parishes) exceeding 15%.

The language is spoken across ethnic and racial lines by people who identify as [[Cajuns|Cajun]] or [[Louisiana Creole people|Louisiana Creole]] as well as [[Chitimacha]], [[Houma people|Houma]], [[Biloxi people|Biloxi]], [[Tunica people|Tunica]], [[Choctaw people|Choctaw]], [[Acadian]], and [[French people|French]] among others.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://houmatoday.com/article/20071209/NEWS/712090329 ''Three Local Tribes Await Federal Decision''], December 8, 2007, ''Houma Today.''&lt;/ref&gt; For these reasons, as well as the relatively small influence [[Acadian French]] has had on the language, the label '''Louisiana French''' or '''Louisiana Regional French''' is generally regarded as more accurate and inclusive than "Cajun French" and is preferred term by [[Linguistics|linguists]] and [[Anthropology|anthropologists]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neumann-Holzschuh|first=Ingrid|date=2014-03-31|title="Carrefour Louisiane"|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/19552629-00701006|journal=Journal of Language Contact|volume=7|issue=1|pages=124–153|doi=10.1163/19552629-00701006|issn=1955-2629}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Acadians and Cajuns: The politics and culture of French minorities in North America|last=Klingler|first=Thomas A.|publisher=Innsbruck University Press|year=2009|isbn=3902571934|editor-last=Mathis-Mosen|editor-first=Ursula|location=Innsbruck|pages=91–103|chapter=How much Acadian is there in Cajun?|editor-last2=Beschof|editor-first2=Günter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/846496076|title=If I could turn my tongue like that : the Creole language of Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana|last=A.|first=Klingler, Thomas|date=2003|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|isbn=0807127795|location=Baton Rouge|oclc=846496076}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/38807|title=New Perspectives on Language Variety in the South: Historical and Contemporary Approaches|last=Klingler|first=Thomas A.|publisher=The University of Alabama Press|year=2015|isbn=9783110196351|editor-last=Picone|editor-first=Michael D.|location=Tuscaloosa|pages=627–640|chapter=Beyond Cajun: Toward an Expanded View of Regional French in Louisiana|editor-last2=Evans Davies|editor-first2=Catherine Evans Davies}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, "Cajun French" is commonly used in [[Laity|lay]] discourse by speakers of the language and other inhabitants of Louisiana.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klingler|first=Thomas A.|date=2003|title=Language labels and language use among Cajuns and Creoles in Louisiana|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/pwpl/vol9/iss2/8/|journal=University of Pennsylvania Working Papers in Linguistics|volume=9|issue=2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louisiana French should further not be confused with [[Louisiana Creole]], a distinct [[French-based creole languages|French-based creole language]] indigenous to Louisiana and spoken across racial lines. In Louisiana, language labels are often conflated with ethnic labels. For example, a speaker who identifies as Cajun may call their language "Cajun French", though linguists would identify it as [[Louisiana Creole]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Parishes in which the dialect is still found include but are not limited to [[Acadia Parish, Louisiana|Acadia]], [[Ascension Parish, Louisiana|Ascension]], [[Assumption Parish, Louisiana|Assumption]], [[Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana|Avoyelles]], [[Cameron Parish, Louisiana|Cameron]], [[Evangeline Parish, Louisiana|Evangeline]], [[Iberia Parish, Louisiana|Iberia]], [[Lafayette Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson Davis, Lafayette]], [[Lafourche Parish, Louisiana|Lafourche]], [[St. Martin Parish, Louisiana|St. Martin]], [[St. Mary Parish, Louisiana|St. Mary]], [[Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana|Terrebonne]], [[Pointe Coupée Parish, Louisiana|Pointe Coupée]], [[Vermillion Parish, Louisiana|Vermillion]], and other parishes of southern Louisiana.



==History==
Starting in the second half of the 17th century, several trading posts were established in [[Louisiana (New France)|Lower Louisiana]] ({{lang-fr|Basse-Louisiane}}) eventually giving way to greater French colonial aspirations with the turn of the century. French immigration was at its peak during the 17th and 18th centuries which firmly established the Creole culture and language there. One important distinction to make is that the term "créole" at the time was consistently used to signify native, or "locally-born" in contrast to "foreign-born". In general the core of the population was rather diverse, coming from all over the [[French colonial empire]] namely [[Canada]], [[France]], and the [[French West Indies]].&lt;ref name="Ammon"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=geh261xgI8sC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Status and Function of Languages and Language Varieties|last=Ammon|first=Ulrich|author2=International Sociological Association|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=1989|isbn=0-89925-356-3|location=|pages=306–308|authorlink=|accessdate=September 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Choctaw_Village_by_Francois_Bernard.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Choctaw_Village_by_Francois_Bernard.jpg|thumb|375x375px|''Choctaw Village near the Chefuncte,'' by Francois Bernard, 1869, Peabody Museum – Harvard University. The Choctaw people had a great impact on the development Louisiana French.]]Eventually, with the consistent relations built between the Native American tribes and francophones, new vocabulary was adopted into the colonial language. For example, something of a "French-Choctaw patois" is said to have developed primarily among Louisiana's Afro-French population and ''métis'' Creoles with a large portion of its vocabulary said to be of Native American origin.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB2"&gt;II, John  LaFleur (2014-07-02).

Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the late arrival of the [[Acadians|Acadian]] people in Louisiana, the French of Louisiana had already begun to undergo [[Language change|changes]] as noted by Captain Jean-Bernard Bossu who traveled with and witnessed [[Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville|Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne]] speaking this "common language."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.5962/bhl.title.42853|title=Travels through that part of North America formerly called Louisiana. / By Mr. Bossu, Captain in the French Marines.

Upon the arrival of their [[Houma people|Houma]] relatives, the family began conversing in "French and Choctaw."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dargo|first=George|last2=de Laussat|first2=Pierre Clement|last3=Pastwa|first3=Agnes-Josephine|last4=Bush|first4=Robert D.|date=1978-11|title=Memoirs of My Life to My Son During the Years 1803 and After, Which I Spent in Public Service in Louisiana as Commissioner of the French Government for the Retrocession to France of That Colony and for Its Transfer to the United States.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2207622|journal=The Journal of Southern History|volume=44|issue=4|pages=633|doi=10.2307/2207622|issn=0022-4642}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional witness to this variety of French comes from J.F.H. Claiborne, a cousin of Louisiana's first American Governor, who also noted the "unusual patois of provincial French and Choctaw."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mississippi: the Province, the Territory and the State, with Biographical Notices of Eminent Citizens|last=Claiborne|first=John Francis Hamtramck|publisher=|year=1880|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1755, large populations of the [[Acadian French|French-speaking]] Acadians began to arrive en masse along the Mississippi River as well as eventually arriving all the way to south to the modern-day state of Louisiana following the [[Great Upheaval|Great Upheveal]]. In 1762, France relinquished their territorial claims to Spain just as Acadians had begun to arrive; despite this, Spanish Governor [[Bernardo de Gálvez]], permitted the Acadians to continue to speak their language as well as observe their other cultural practices. The original Acadian community was composed mainly of farmers and fishermen who were able to provide their children with a reasonable amount of schooling. However, the hardships after being exiled from [[Nova Scotia]], along with the difficult process of resettlement in Louisiana and the ensuing poverty made it difficult to establish schools in the early stages of the community’s development. Eventually schools were established, as private academies whose faculty had recently arrived in Louisiana from France or who had been educated in France. Children were usually able to attend the schools only long enough to learn counting and reading.&lt;ref name="Conwell 1963 18–19"&gt;{{cite book|title=Louisiana French Grammar|last=Conwell|first=Marilyn|publisher=Mouton &amp; Co|year=1963|location=The Hague|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, a standard part of a child’s education in the Cajun community was also the [[Catholic]] [[catechism]], which was taught in French by an older member of the community.&lt;ref name="Conwell 1963 18–19" /&gt; The educational system did not allow for much contact with [[Standard French]].&lt;ref name="Conwell 1963 18–19" /&gt; It has often been said that [[Acadian French]] has had a large impact on the development of Louisiana French but this has generally been over-estimated.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

French immigration continued in the 19th century until the start of the [[American Civil War]], bringing large numbers of francophones speaking something more similar to today's Metropolitan French to Louisiana. Over time, through [[Language change|contact]] between different ethnic groups the various dialects [[Dialect levelling|converged]] to produce what we know as Louisiana French.&lt;ref&gt;Brasseaux, Carl A. 1992. ''Acadian to Cajun: transformation of a people, 1803-1877''. Jackson and London: University Press of Mississippi.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decline ===
The strong influence of English-language education on the francophone community began following the [[American Civil War]], when laws that had protected the rights of French speakers were abolished. Public schools that attempted to force francophones to learn English were established in Louisiana. Parents viewed the practice of teaching their children English as the intrusion of a foreign culture, and many refused to send their children to school. When the government required them to do so, they selected private French Catholic schools in which class was conducted in French. The French schools worked to emphasize Standard French, which they considered to be the [[prestige dialect]]. When the government required all schools, public and parochial, to teach in English, new teachers, who could not speak French, were hired. Children could not understand their teachers and generally ignored them by continuing to speak French. Eventually, children became punished for speaking French on school grounds.&lt;ref name="Conwell 1963 18–19" /&gt;

The punishment system seems to have been responsible for much of the decay that Louisiana French experienced in the 20th century since, in turn, people who could not speak English were perceived as uneducated. Therefore, parents became hesitant to teach French to their children, hoping that the children would have a better life in an English-speaking nation.&lt;ref name="Conwell 1963 18–19" /&gt; As of 2011, there are an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 people in Louisiana who speak French. By comparison, there were an estimated one million native French-speakers in Louisiana in about 1968. The dialect is now at risk of extinction as children are no longer taught it formally in schools.

Many question whether the Louisiana French language will survive another generation.&lt;ref name="TULANE"&gt;[http://caneriver.tulane.edu/LanguagesLabels.html Language Labels (French in Louisiana)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223085445/http://caneriver.tulane.edu/LanguagesLabels.html|date=2007-12-23}}, [[Tulane University]].&lt;/ref&gt; Some residents of [[Acadiana]] are [[Multilingualism|bilingual]] though, having learned French at home and English in school. Currently, Louisiana French is considered an [[endangered language]].

=== Preservation efforts ===
Marilyn J. Conwell of Pennsylvania State University conducted a study of Louisiana French in 1959 and published "probably the first complete study of a Louisiana French dialect,"&lt;ref name="Conwell 1963 19"&gt;{{cite book|title=Louisiana French Grammar|last=Conwell|first=Marilyn|publisher=Mouton &amp; Co|year=1963|location=The Hague|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Louisiana French Grammar'', in 1963. Conwell focused on the French spoken in [[Lafayette, Louisiana]], and evaluated what was then its current status. Conwell pointed out that the gradual decline of French made it "relatively common" to find "grand-parents who speak only French, parents who speak both French and English, children who speak English and understand French, and grand-children who speak and understand only English."&lt;ref name="Conwell 1963 19" /&gt; The decision to teach French to children was well-received since grandparents hoped for better opportunities for communicating with their grandchildren.&lt;ref name="Conwell 1963 19" /&gt;[[File:Louisiana French.svg|thumb|All varieties of French in Louisiana according to 2000 Census, including Louisiana French. Parishes marked in yellow are those where &lt;span style="background:#ff0;"&gt;4–10%&lt;/span&gt;,orange &lt;span style="background:#ff7f00;"&gt;10–15%&lt;/span&gt;, red &lt;span style="background:#f00; color:white;"&gt;15–20%&lt;/span&gt;, and maroon &lt;span style="background:#7f0000; color:white;"&gt;20–30%&lt;/span&gt; of the population speak French at home,]]

The [[Council for the Development of French in Louisiana]] (CODOFIL) was established in 1968 to promote the preservation of French language and culture in Louisiana. In addition to this, some Louisiana universities, such as [[Louisiana State University]], offer courses in "Cajun French" in the hopes of preserving the language.

The Louisiana state legislature has greatly shifted its stance on the status of French. Since the passage of Legislative Act No. 409 in 1968, the Louisiana governor is granted the authorization "to establish the Council for the Development of Louisiana-French" and that the agency is to consist of no more than fifty members, including a chairman. The name was soon changed to CODOFIL and was granted the power to "do anything possible and necessary to encourage the development, usage and preservation of French as it exists in Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codofil.org|title=CODOFIL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, Jules O. Daigle, a [[Roman Catholic priest]], published ''A Dictionary of the Cajun Language'' the first dictionary devoted to "Cajun French." Once considered an authority on the language, it is not exhaustive; it omits alternate spellings and synonyms that Father Daigle deemed "perversions" of the language but are nonetheless popular among so-called Louisiana French speakers and writers.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Dictionary of the Cajun Language|last=O'Daigle|first=James|publisher=Edwards Brothers, Inc.|year=1984|location=Ann Arbor, MI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though remaining useful today, Daigle's dictionary has been superseded by the ''Dictionary of Louisiana French'' (2010), edited by Albert Valdman and other authorities on the language.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

Beginning in the 1990s, various signage, packaging, and documentation in French became present throughout the state. State and local tourism bureau commissions were influential in convincing city, parish and state officials to produce bilingual signage and documentation. French and English bilingual signage is, therefore, usually confined to the old districts of cities, like the [[French Quarter|French Quarter in New Orleans]], downtown [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]] and [[New Iberia, Louisiana|New Iberia]] (trilingual with Spanish), [[St. Martinville, Louisiana|St. Martinville]], [[Breaux Bridge, Louisiana|Breaux Bridge]], as well as several other cities. Locals continue to refer to the place names in English and for postal services, English is generally preferred. To meet the demands of a growing francophone tourist market, tourism bureaus and commissions throughout the state, particularly in southern Louisiana, have information on tourist sites in both French and English as well as in other major languages spoken by tourists.

Many young adults are learning enough French to understand French music lyrics. Also, there is now a trend to use French language websites to learn the dialect. Culinary words and terms of endearment such as "cher" {{IPA|[ʃæ]}} (dear) and "nonc" (uncle) are still heard among otherwise English-speaking Louisianians.

An article written online by the [[Université Laval]] argues that the state of Louisiana's shift, from an anti-French stance to one of soft promotion has been of great importance to the survival of the language. The article states that it is advantageous to invigorate the revival of the language, to better cherish the state's rich heritage, and to protect a francophone minority that has suffered greatly from negligence by political and religious leaders. Furthermore, the university's article claims that it is CODOFIL rather than the state itself which sets [[language policy]]; the only political stance the state of Louisiana makes is that of noninterference. All of this culminates in the fact that outside the extremely southern portions of the state, French remains a secondary language that retains heavy cultural and identity values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/axl/amnord/louisiane-3pol-lng.htm|title=Louisiane: La politique linguistique actuelle en Louisiane|date=2008-05-16|publisher=Université Laval}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jacques Henry, former executive director of CODOFIL, much progress has been made for francophones and that the future of French in Louisiana is not merely a symbolic one. According to statistics gathered by CODOFIL, the past twenty years has seen widespread acceptance of French-immersion programs. He goes further to write that the official recognition, appreciation by parents, and inclusion of French in schools reflects growing regard of the language. Ultimately the survival of French in Louisiana can only be guaranteed by Louisianan parents and politicians, but that there is still hope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionamerique-apf.org/Bulletin/Vol1No1/Art9.pdf|title=Le Français en Louisiane: Le Doubt puis L'Espoir|last=Jacques|first=Henry|publisher=Regionamerique-apf.org|language=French|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the state legislature passed the Louisiana French Language Services Act in 2011 with particular mention to cultural tourism, local culture, and heritage. The bill sets forth that each branch of the state government shall take necessary action to identify employees who are proficient in French. Each branch of the state government is to take necessary steps in producing services in the French language for both locals and visitors. This bill is, however, an unfunded state mandate.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web|url=http://latinlouisiana2010.wordpress.com/2011/07/04/act-106-louisiana-french-language-services/|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331014149/http://latinlouisiana2010.wordpress.com/2011/07/04/act-106-louisiana-french-language-services/|archivedate=2012-03-31|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2011-08-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislative act was drafted and presented by francophone and [[francophile]] senators and representatives as it asserts that the French language is vital to the economy of the state.

== Population ==
Reliable counts of speakers of Louisiana French are difficult to obtain as distinct from other varieties of French. However, the vast majority of native residents of Louisiana and east and southeast Texas who speak French are likely speakers of Louisiana French.

In Louisiana, {{as of | 2010 |lc=y}}, the population of French speakers was approximately 115,183.&lt;ref name="French MLA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://apps.mla.org/map_data|title=French|publisher=MLA Language Map Data Center|access-date=30 Mar 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These populations are concentrated most heavily in the southern, coastal parishes.

In Texas, {{as of | 2010 |lc=y}}, the French-speaking population was 55,773, though many of these were likely immigrants from France and other locations, living in the urban areas.&lt;ref name="French MLA" /&gt; Nevertheless, in the rural eastern/southeastern Texas counties of [[Orange County, Texas|Orange]], [[Jefferson County, Texas|Jefferson]], [[Chambers County, Texas|Chambers]], [[Newton County, Texas|Newton]], [[Jasper County, Texas|Jasper]], [[Tyler County, Texas|Tyler]], [[Liberty County, Texas|Liberty]], and [[Hardin County, Texas|Hardin]] alone—areas where it can be reasonably presumed that almost all French speakers are Louisiana French speakers—the total French-speaking population was composed of 3,400 individuals. It is likely a substantial portion of the 14,493 speakers in Houston's [[Harris County, Texas|Harris county]] are also Louisiana French speakers. With this is mind, a marked decline in the number of French speakers in Texas has been noticed in the last half of the twentieth century. For example, at one point the French-speaking population of Jefferson County was 24,049 as compared to the mere 1,922 today. Likewise, in Harris County the French-speaking population has shifted from 26,796 to 14,493 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Louder, Dean; LeBlanc, Michael|date=September 1979|title=The Cajuns of East Texas|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.549.2871&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|publisher=Cahiers de Geographie du Quebec|volume=23|number=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louisiana French-speaking populations can also be found in southern Mississippi and Alabama, as well as pockets in other parts of the United States.

==Grammar==
Despite ample time for Louisiana French to diverge, the basic grammatical core of the language remains similar or the same as Standard French.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Even so, it can be expected that the language would begin to diverge due to the various influences of neighboring languages, changing francophone demographics, and unstable opportunities for education. Furthermore, Louisiana French lacks any official regulating body unlike that of [[Académie française|Standard French]] or [[Office québécois de la langue française|Quebec French]] to take part in standardizing the language.

&lt;small&gt;1. the formal second-person singular form is rarely used&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;2. ''nous'' is only present in formal Louisiana French&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;3. ''eusse/euse'' is confined to the southeastern parishes of Louisiana&lt;/small&gt;

Immediately some distinct characteristics of Louisiana French can be gleaned from its personal pronouns. For example, the traditional third-person singular feminine pronoun ''elle''  of Standard French is present but also there is the alternative of ''alle'' which is chosen by some authors since it more closely approximates speakers' pronunciation. Also, use of the pronoun ''ils'' has supplanted the third-person feminine pronoun ''elles'' as it is used to refer to both masculine and feminine subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lsu.edu/hss/french/undergraduate_program/cajun_french/pronoms_personnels.php|title=Les pronoms personnels en français cadien|last=LaFleur|first=Amanda|date=2002|website=Louisiana State University|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, all of the other third-person plural pronouns are neutral. The usage of ''-autres'' with plural pronouns is widespread in the language.

===Verbs===
In order to demonstrate the use of some of the indicative verb tenses in Louisiana French, take the example of ''manger'' meaning to eat:

|-
! scope="row" | 3rd plural
| ''ils mangent&lt;br&gt;ils mangeont'' || ''ils sont après manger&lt;br&gt;ils sont apé manger'' || ''ils ont mangé'' || ''ils mangeaient&lt;br&gt;ils mangiont''|| ''ils mangeraient&lt;br&gt;ils mangeriont'' || ''ils vont manger'' ||''ils mangeront''
|}
Some minor simplification of tenses is exhibited in the conjugation of the verb ''manger'', namely of the plural first and second person conjugations which are inflected identically to the third person singular. Not only this, but the inflection of the third person plural verb form has diverged between the form identical to Standard French and the use of ''-ont'' in for all verbs.

The [[Elision (French)|elision]] that is common in many aspects of French is accelerated in Louisiana French with the [[French phonology#Schwa|schwa]] in ''je'' often omitted regardless of the presence of a following vowel as well as the regular use of ''t'es (tu es) and t'as (tu as)'' as opposed to such avoidance in Standard French.

The present progressive tense of Louisiana French initially appears alien as compared to Standard French but ''après/apé'' possesses the same function signified by ''en train de''.

===Contractions===
Unlike Standard French, Louisiana French avoids article-preposition contractions involving the prepositions ''de,'' or ''des'':

*"I learned from the grandparents."
**Louisiana French: ''"J'ai appris '''de les''' grand-parents."''
**Standard French: ''"J'ai appris '''des''' grand-parents''."
*"the skylight"
**Louisiana French: ''"la lumière '''de le''' ciel"''
**Standard French: ''"la lumière '''du''' ciel"''

=== Proper Names ===
Place names in Louisiana French usually differ from those in Standard French. For instance, locales named for [[American Indian tribes]] usually use the plural article ''les'' instead of the masculine or feminine singular articles ''le'' or ''la''. Likewise, the contraction ''aux'' (''à'' and ''les'') is used with such locations. This trend seems to vary by region since in [[Pierre Part, Louisiana|Pierre Part]] and [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]] elderly francophones have often been heard to say ''la Californie, le Texas, la Floride''. In informal Louisiana French, most US states and countries are pronounced as in English and therefore require no article but in formal Louisiana French, prefixed articles are absent: ''Californie, Texas, Floride, Belgique, Liban'', etc

===Code-switching===
[[Code-switching]] occurs frequently in Louisiana French but this is typical for many language contact situations.&lt;ref name="Blyth 1997 40"&gt;{{cite book|title=French and Creole in Louisiana|last=Blyth|first=Carl|publisher=Plenum Press|year=1997|isbn=0-306-45464-5|location=New York, N.Y.|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Code-switching was once viewed as a sign of poor education, but it is now understood to be an indication of proficiency in the two different languages that a speaker uses. Fluent Louisiana French speakers frequently alternate from French to English, but less proficient speakers will usually not.&lt;ref name="Blyth 1997 41"&gt;{{cite book|title=French and Creole in Louisiana|last=Blyth|first=Carl|publisher=Plenum Press|year=1997|isbn=0-306-45464-5|location=New York, N.Y.|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vocabulary==
From a lexical perspective, Louisiana French differs little from other varieties of French spoken in the world. However, due to the unique history and development of the language, Louisiana French has many words that are unique to it or to select French varieties.

===Creole influences===
Francophones and creolophones have worked side-by-side, lived among one another, and have enjoyed local festivities together throughout the history of the state. As a result, in regions where both Louisiana French and Louisiana Creole are or used to be spoken, the inhabitants of the region often code-switch, beginning the sentence in one language and completing it in another.&lt;ref name="Thomas A.

== Varieties ==
Taxonomies for classing Louisiana French have changed over time. Until the 1960s and 1970s, Louisianans themselves, when speaking in French, referred to their language as ''français'' or ''créole''. In English, they referred to their language as "Creole French" and "French" simultaneously.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sylvie Dubois, William Gautreau, Howard Margot, Megan Melançon, Tracy Veler.

In 1968, Lafayette native [[James Domengeaux]], a US Representative, created the [[Council for the Development of French in Louisiana]] (CODOFIL), whose mission was to oversee the promotion, visibility, and expansion of French language usage in Louisiana. His mission was clear: (re)create a European French bastion in Louisiana by making all Louisianans bilingual in International French and English. To accomplish his goals, he teamed up with political leaders in Canada and France, including former French President [[Georges Pompidou]]. He found Louisiana French too limiting, so he imported francophone teachers from Europe, Canada and the Caribbean to teach normative French in Louisiana schools. His penchant for International French caused him to lose support in Louisiana: most Louisianans, if they were going to have French in Louisiana schools, wanted Louisiana French, not "Parisian French."&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Ginette Baillargeon.

Simultaneously, an ethnic movement took root in southern Louisiana led by Acadian-Creoles like James Donald Faulk, [[Dudley J. LeBlanc|Dudley Joseph Leblanc]] and Jules O. Daigle. Faulk, a French teacher in [[Crowley, Louisiana]], introduced using the term "Cajun French" for Acadian-Creoles and French Creoles who identified as Cajun, for which he created a curriculum guide for institutionalizing the language in schools in 1977. Roman Catholic Priest Jules O. Daigle, who in 1984 published his ''Dictionary of the Cajun Language'', followed him. "Cajun French" is intended to imply the French spoken in Louisiana by descendants of Acadians, an ethnic qualifier rather than a linguistic relationship.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Louisiane 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Louisiana 2003" /&gt;

In 2009, Iberia Parish native and activist Christophe Landry introduced three terms representing lexical differences based on Louisiana topography: Provincial Louisiana French (PLF), Fluvial Louisiana French (FLF), and Urban Louisiana French (ULF).&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web|url=http://latinlouisiana2010.wordpress.com/2010/10/24/louisiana-french/|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331014118/http://latinlouisiana2010.wordpress.com/2010/10/24/louisiana-french/|archivedate=2012-03-31|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2011-08-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the ''Dictionary of Louisiana of Louisiana French: As Spoken in Cajun, Creole, and American Indian Communities'', was published. It was edited by a coalition of linguists and other activists. The title clearly suggests that the ethno-racial identities are mapped onto the languages, but the language, at least linguistically, remains shared across those ethno-racial lines.&lt;ref name="Albert Valdman 2010" /&gt;

Due to present ethnic movements and internal subdivisions among the population, some of the state's inhabitants insist are ancestral varieties. As a result, it is not odd to hear the language referred to as Canadian French, Acadian French, Broken French, Old French, Creole French, Cajun French, and so on. Still other Louisiana francophones will simply refer to their language as French, without qualifiers. Internally, two broad distinctions will be made: '''informal Louisiana French''' and '''formal Louisiana French'''.&lt;ref name="Thomas A. Klingler 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Louisiane 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sylvie Dubois and Megan Melançon. "Creole is. Creole ain't.

"The Quality of French Spoken in Louisiana: Linguistic Attitudes toward the Varieties of French in Cajun Communities."SECOL Review 19, 1995: 126-150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Informal Louisiana French===
Probably the widely used variety of the language, informal Louisiana French has its roots in agrarian Louisiana, but it is now also found in urban centers because of urbanization beginning in the 20th century. Historically, along the prairies of southwest Louisiana, francophone Louisianans were cattle grazers as well as rice and cotton farmers. Along the bayous and the Louisiana littoral, sugar cane cultivation dominated and in many parishes today, sugar cultivation remains an important source of economy. Informal Louisiana French can at least be divided further into three core varieties: '''Fluvial''', '''Provincial''', and '''Bayou Lafourche Louisiana French'''.

The phonology of these varieties, apart from some minor distinctions, are rather similar and distinct in comparison to the international francophone community. A key feature of the dialect would likely be the pronunciation of the letter "r" as an [[alveolar consonant]] {{IPA|/ɾ/}} rather than a [[uvular consonant]] like in Standard French. Vowels are commonly omitted from the beginning and end of for words: "''américain'' → méricain" or "''espérer → spérer''." Likewise, the letter "é" preceding "o" frequently erodes in the spoken informal varieties: "''léonide'' → ''lonide''" or "''cléophas'' → ''clophas''." The nasality and pitch  of the language is akin to that associated with provincial speech in Québec. In terms of nasality, Louisiana French is similar to French spoken in [[Walloon language|Brussels]] and [[African French|Dakar, Senegal]]. The pitch of Provincial Louisiana French and Provincial Quebec French share a predominantly agricultural history, close contact with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian groups]] and relative isolation from urbanized populations.&lt;ref name="Michael D.

====Bayou Lafourche====
Particular mention should be made to the francophones of [[Bayou Lafourche]], who speak a linguistic feature that is absent everywhere else in Louisiana. Some francophones along Bayou Lafourche pronounce the letters "g" and "j" as an [[voiceless glottal fricative]], but others pronounce the two letters in the manner of most other francophones.&lt;ref&gt;John Guilbeau. " A Glossary of Variants From Standard French in La Fourche Parish," Master's thesis, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The French Spoken in La Fourche Parish, Louisiana," diss., University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oukada Larbi. "A Linguistic Study with Descriptive Analysis of Lafourche Parish Dialect," diss., Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two theories exist to explain the feature:

# Some activists and linguists attribute this feature to an inheritance of Acadian French spoken in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and other Canadian maritime provinces, a theory based entirely on observation of shared vocal features rather than the communities being linked by migration.&lt;ref&gt;Nathalie Dajko. Ethnic and Geographic Variation in the French of the Lafourche Bassin. Diss. Tulane University, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Papen. Louisiana "Cajun" French: A grammatical sketch of the French dialect spoken on Bayou Lafourche (Lafourche Parish). Unpublished manuscript, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;
# On the other hand, it has been suggested that there may be a linguistic link to the [[hispanophone]]s living at the Mississippi River and Bayou Lafourche junction, who were more numerous than the Acadians in the immediate vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web|url=http://latinlouisiana2010.wordpress.com/2010/10/24/bayou-lafourche-french/|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331014137/http://latinlouisiana2010.wordpress.com/2010/10/24/bayou-lafourche-french/|archivedate=2012-03-31|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2011-08-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Louisiana Creole]] spoken in Lafourche Parish in and around [[Kraemer, Louisiana|Kraemer]], [[Choctaw, Louisiana|Choctaw]], and [[Chackbay, Louisiana|Chackbay]] contains the letters "g" and "j", but they are voiced as they are in all other varieties of Louisiana and French spoken elsewhere.

===Formal Louisiana French===
This variety is known for its use in all administrative and ecclesiastic documents, speeches and in literary publications. Also known as '''Urban Louisiana French''', Colonial French, or '''Plantation Society French''', it is spoken primarily in the urban business centers of the state. Because those regions have historically been centers of trade and commerce with contact French speakers from Europe, it is regarded as a more conservative variety of the language. Areas where this formal variety can be heard include [[New Orleans]], [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], [[St. Martinville, Louisiana|St. Martinville]], and other once important francophone business centers in the state. Generally formal Louisiana French is maintained along strict class lines.

The phonology of formal Louisiana French shares much in common with Standard French to various degrees depending upon the speaker. As an example, speakers can be heard pronouncing "r" as a uvular constant as opposed to an alveolar. Furthermore, the pronunciation and intonation of this variety can vary from European to the North American varieties of French. Use of the pronouns ''nous'' and ''vous'' are far more prevalent in the register as ''nous'' has been supplanted by ''on'' in the informal varieties.

===Healing practices===
Medicine men and women, or healers ({{lang-fr|traiteur/traiteuse}}), are still found throughout the state. During their rituals for healing, they use secret French prayers to God or saints for a speedy recovery. These healers are mostly Catholic and do not expect compensation or even thanks, as it is said that then, the cure will not work.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Brandon. Folk Medicine in French Louisiana.

=== Music ===
Louisiana French has been the traditional language for singing music now referred to as Cajun, [[zydeco]], and Louisiana French rock. As of today, Old French music, Creole stomp, and Louisiana French rock remain the only three genres of music in Louisiana using French instead of English. Most "Cajun" artists have expressions and phrases in French in songs, predominantly sung in English.&lt;ref&gt;Marcia Gaudet and James C. McDonald, ed. Mardi Gras, Gumbo and Zydeco.

==Education==
===French-language Public School Curriculum===
[[File:Louisiana French Immersion Parishes.png|thumb|150px|Parishes offering French immersion programs in 2011]]
As of autumn 2011, Louisiana has French-language total immersion or bilingual French and English immersion in ten parishes: [[Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana|Calcasieu]], [[Acadia Parish, Louisiana|Acadia]], [[St. Landry Parish, Louisiana|St. Landry]], [[St. Martin Parish, Louisiana|St. Martin]], [[Iberia Parish, Louisiana|Iberia]], [[Lafayette Parish, Louisiana|Lafayette]], [[Assumption Parish, Louisiana|Assumption]], [[East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana|East Baton Rouge]], [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson]] and [[Orleans Parish|Orleans]]. The curriculum in both the total French-language [[language immersion|immersion]] as well as in the [[bilingual education|bilingual]] program follows the same standards as all other schools in the parish and state.

The [[Council for the Development of French in Louisiana]] (CODOFIL) recruits teachers locally and globally each year. Additionally, [http://lesamisdelimmersion.com Les Amis de l'Immersion, Inc.] is the parent-teacher organization for students in French immersion in the state which organizes [[summer camp]]s, fundraisers and outreach for teachers, parents and students in the program.

'''Manga Entertainment''' is a producer, licensee, and distributor of [[anime|Japanese animation]] in the United Kingdom. It also co-produces several anime series, including ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'', ''[[Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation]]'', ''[[Highlander: The Search for Vengeance]]'' and ''[[Eon Kid]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2005-09-08/manga-entertainment-announces-international-partnership-for-iron-kid | title=Manga Entertainment Announces International Partnership for Iron Kid | publisher=Anime News Network | date=September 8, 2005 | accessdate=November 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually through financial contributions toward production costs.

The American branch was established in 1991 following the acquisition of the UK rights to ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'', by Laurence Guinness, who was the Head of Acquisition and Development at Island World Communications. [[Andy Frain]], was the Managing Director of Island World Communications; a loss-making subsidiary at the time of [[Chris Blackwell]] and John Heyman's Island World Group.

Manga has also played a part in [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] anime, when it is not sub-licensing a production that has already been licensed by another company (e.g., ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'', licensed and redubbed by [[Geneon]] in 2001, ''[[Bounty Dog]]'', and ''[[Lupin III: Bye Bye Liberty Crisis]]''). It is also the designated home video distributor for the ''[[Pokémon (anime)|Pokémon]]'' franchise in the UK, including some of the movies apart from the ones distributed by [[Miramax]] (among them ''[[Pokémon: The First Movie]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manga Entertainment Brings Pokémon to the UK on Blu-ray|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=19538|website=Blu-ray.com|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its name, the company's principal business is the distribution of [[anime]] rather than [[manga]], although they have published some manga, such as ''[[Crying Freeman]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Shirow | first=Masamune | authorlink=Masamune Shirow|others=trans. Studio Proteus | title=Appleseed Volume One: The Promethean Challenge | edition=UK | publisher=Manga Publishing | location=London | isbn=1-900097-01-X | origyear=1985 | year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the United Kingdom under the Manga Books imprint.

Since 2005, Manga Entertainment UK has operated independently from its American branch, even though both companies were still owned by IDT Entertainment and later [[Starz Media]]. In 2011, the American branch ceased licensing new products after the release of [[Redline (2009 film)|Redline]] and went dormant. In 2015, the U.K branch would be bought from Starz Media alongside its parent Anchor Bay UK to managing director Colin Lomax. Anchor Bay UK was renamed to Platform Entertainment and went on to have exclusive rights to the Manga Entertainment branding and catalog in the UK and Ireland. Currently, Manga Entertainment UK have licensing and distribution deals with [[Funimation]], [[Sentai Filmworks]] and [[Viz Media]]. Unlike previous licensing agreements, however, they do not bring titles from Funimation, Sentai, and Viz to Australia under their brand as Manga's Australian distributor; [[Madman Entertainment]] has the licenses from these companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2015-09-16/.92992|title=Answerman - What Ever Happened to Manga Entertainment?

In December 2016, Platform Entertainment would be bought by Kaleidoscope Film Distribution, who split Manga UK off to become a separate entity.

In 2017, [[Lionsgate Home Entertainment]], the new owner of the dormant US branch, relaunched the Manga.com website and Facebook page, and planning a re-launch in the near future. Lionsgate currently licenses the Manga Entertainment brand-name from the now non-related UK branch.

== Divisions ==
=== Manga Entertainment in Australia ===
[[File:Manga Entertainment's Manga Video imprint, circa 1991.jpg|thumb|left|Manga Entertainment's original logo and initial imprint]]

Manga Entertainment expanded into Australia in late 1993 when Manga's main headquarters were still based in London. Although initially Manga's titles were to be released in Australia by [[PolyGram]] who owned Island and Manga, they decided to sub-license their properties to [[Siren Visual|Siren Entertainment]]. In late 1996, Manga Entertainment UK gave the sub-distribution license to the newly founded [[Madman Entertainment]] who in turn were distributed by Siren. This meant that both Siren and Madman has equal rights to Manga's properties.

In 1997, PolyGram Australia gained the rights to some of Manga's more recent additions to its catalogue. This included ''[[Lupin the Third]]'' properties, except ''[[The Castle of Cagliostro]]'', and ''[[Violence Jack]]''. ''Violence Jack: Evil Town'' was banned in Australia, even when PolyGram submitted the UK cut to the Australian Government for classification. The other two OVAs in the series submitted were the uncut dubbed versions that were released in the USA by [[Right Stuf Inc.|Critical Mass]], however due to ''Evil Town''{{-'}}s banning, PolyGram scrapped the release of ''Violence Jack'' in Australia. PolyGram already had the UK cut of ''Evil Town'' in circulation despite its banning.

In late 1996, [[Madman Entertainment]] was founded by former employees of Siren. They were given exclusive sub-license rights to Manga UK's catalogue, including Part 4 of ''[[Macross Plus]]'', which was released in 1997. Despite this, Madman did not take on some titles, e.g. ''[[RG Veda]]'' and ''[[Shadow Skill]]'', and let PolyGram Australia distribute them.

Siren decided to license ''[[Street Fighter II V]]'' from Manga USA in 1997 and released the series without input from Madman, as Madman also had an exclusive licensing deal with [[ADV Films]], who had licensed ''Street Fighter II V'' in the UK and re-dubbed it. This property was taken over by Madman in 1999. In this same time period Manga Entertainment had licensed ''[[Voltron]]'' exclusively for the Australian market and was released by Siren instead of Polygram Australia.

In 1998, after Manga was purchased by former Island CEO [[Chris Blackwell]], [[Madman Entertainment]] was given the rights to the entire Manga catalogue from Manga's UK and USA subsidiaries except ''Street Fighter II V'', which was still licensed by Siren. Manga Entertainment has since had a special relationship with [[Madman Entertainment]] and Manga was credited by many as the major force behind turning Anime into mainstream entertainment in Australia during the 1990s and early 2000s. Manga's latest DVD and Blu-ray masters are encoded and provided by Madman Entertainment because of Madman's extremely large and modern DVD and Blu-ray authoring division.

In 1999, Siren relinquished its licensing deal with Manga UK and its separate deal for ''SFII: V'' from Manga USA as Madman had become big enough for Siren to make the same amount of profit distributing for them as it was when it was the sole distributor of Manga products in Australia.

In 2001, Siren Entertainment restructured itself and split the company into 2 separate entities: Siren Visual and The AV Channel. Madman's founders who were former employees of the company and owned shares of Siren decided to take The AV Channel and turn it into Madman's distribution arm which was absorbed into Madman in 2008.

Madman Entertainment in the mid 2000s decided to align itself with Manga USA, but since the dawn of Blu-ray and Manga USA turning into an online and television distributor of anime, Madman has re-aligned itself with Manga UK. Both companies funded and co-produced the PAL region dub of ''[[Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence]]'' and co-produce DVDs and Blu-rays. Madman provides Manga UK with PAL DVD and some Blu-ray masters due to Madman's larger and more sophisticated authoring division. Manga and Madman co-license properties such as the ''[[Rebuild of Evangelion]]'' movies, ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood]]'' &amp; the ''[[Ghost In The Shell]]'' franchise among others.

=== Manga Entertainment UK ===
{{see also|Manga Force: The Ultimate Collection}}

In January 2007, the company's United Kingdom division began releasing a fortnightly magazine aimed at promoting both the company itself through the use of some of its more revered titles. Issue one, for example, used ''Ghost in the Shell''. The magazine had published 102 issues. The company also has an official website for the UK division, as well as an online shop. After the take over by Lionsgate for the American branch, the UK branch of Manga Entertainment still exists to this day, running independently distributing DVD's and Blu-ray titles for the UK market, acquiring licenses from various companies.

==US broadcast on Xbox TV==
It was announced in October 2011 that Microsoft formed partnerships with over 50 content providers worldwide, including Manga Entertainment. This feature was to be available at no extra cost to US subscribers after the new Xbox dashboard update due sometime in December 2011.

[[File:FEMA - 44312 - Tornado Damage in Oklahoma.jpg|thumb|A brick veneer wall destroyed by a tornado]]

'''Masonry veneer''' walls consist of a single non-structural external layer of [[masonry]], typically made of [[brick]], [[stone]] or manufactured stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ncma.org/manufactured-stone-veneer/|title=Manufactured Stone Veneer|website=ncma.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Masonry veneer can have an air space behind it and is technically called "anchored veneer".  A masonry veneer attached directly to the backing is called "adhered veneer".  The innermost element is usually structural wall, and may consist of concrete masonry (often called a [[Cavity wall]] where inner and outer layers are both structural), concrete, wood or metal frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.carsondunlop.com/resources/articles/brick-houses-solid-masonry-vs-brick-veneer/|title=» Brick Houses – Solid Masonry vs. Brick Veneer|website=www.carsondunlop.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Because brick itself isn't waterproof, the airspace also functions as a drainage plane, allowing any water that has penetrated the veneer to drain to the bottom of the air space, where it encounters [[flashing (weatherproofing)]] and is directed to the outside through [[weep]] holes, rather than entering the building.  

Other advantages of a masonry veneer include:
* The air space can include additional [[building insulation|insulation]], which is typically in the form of rigid foam, increasing the [[thermal performance]] of the wall.
* The [[framing (construction)|structural framing]] or masonry backup can be erected first to allow the rest of the building structure to be completed concurrently with the outer veneer, rather than waiting for the entire wall structure to be completed before proceeding with the roof and upper floors.
* A masonry veneer wall can be completed in a shorter time with less labor than a solid masonry wall thus saving in cost. 
* The weight of a veneer wall can be significantly less than solid masonry, resulting in economies in [[Foundation (engineering)|foundations]] and structural support.
* Because they are a lighter-weight, more economical option, brick and stone masonry veneers can be used in place of natural stone or full brick to provide added aesthetic appeal to a structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.echelonmasonry.com/artisan-masonry-veneers|title=Stone Masonry Veneers: Thin Stone Artisan Masonry Veneers|website=www.echelonmasonry.com|access-date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Support ==
Because the masonry veneer is non-structural, it must be tied back to the building structure to prevent movement under wind and [[earthquake]] loads.  Brick ties are used for this purpose, and may take the form of corrugated metal straps nailed or screwed to the structural framing, or as wire extensions to horizontal joint reinforcement in a fully masonry veneer or cavity wall.  Although the veneer is vertically self-supporting, [[shelf angle]]s are often used in multi-story buildings, typically at floor edges, to provide a horizontal expansion joint that allows expansion of the brick and potential shrinkage of the frame.  In  multi-story buildings, such a system may be called a [[curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]].  Adhered masonry veneer is bonded to the backing so it does not typically need a shelf angle.

== Materials ==
Masonry veneers can be made of [[brick]], [[concrete]], natural stone or manufactured stone product.  Typically, [[masonry]] refers to individual units that are placed in a mortar bed, making a distinction with panelized products.

== Rain screens ==
A variant on masonry veneer is the [[rain screen]] veneer. Rain screens are ventilated at the top and bottom of the cavity to prevent wind-driven rain from being driven into the building by unbalanced pressure. Such systems are typically encountered in areas where blowing rain is a significant concern.

== Thermal performance ==
Masonry has high [[thermal mass]], so masonry is slower to heat up, and can continue to release heat long into the night; without insulation half of that heat will be released into the building. Masonry with a dark external surface absorbs more heat than with a lighter external surface, especially if exposed to sunlight. Reverse masonry veneer walls have the brickwork inside and the lightweight frame and cladding outside; this has the advantage of providing the thermal mass on the inside of a building.

Masonry itself provides very little insulation, however: 
* a masonry veneer construction using one or more reflective foil surfaces next to a sufficiently thick cavity of still air can provide substantial insulation
* insulating material inserted between the framework studs can also provide substantial insulation. 
Different configurations of such foil(s), air-space(s), and/or insulating material(s) can perform significantly better at excluding heat during summer and/or retaining heat during winter; these configurations often perform in counter-intuitive ways. Because of the enormous long-term potential for reducing energy requirements and improving occupant comfort, building designers should consult engineers or adopt configurations with known performances.

The service work that is being sourced may be a [[business process]] or [[software development]].

[https://startnearshoring.com/knowledge/nearshore-vs-in-house-software-development Nearshoring] is a type of outsourcing where a given company seeks a development partner in a different country or region. However, what distinguishes nearshoring from other types of outsourcing is the fact that the development partner is still in close proximity. Since companies are usually in the same time zone, this facilitates communication and allows for frequent visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://startnearshoring.com/knowledge/nearshore-vs-in-house-software-development|title=When IT challenges overwhelm your company - Start Nearshoring|website=startnearshoring.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Nearshoring is a derivative of the business term [[offshoring]].

Offshoring involves shifting work to a foreign, distant organization in order to reduce production costs. Offshoring is subject to several different constraints, however, such as time lag between the parties, differences in local employment laws and practices, and oversight.&lt;ref name="sam"&gt;{{Cite web

In contrast, nearshoring means that the business has shifted work to a lower cost organization, but within its own region, broadly defined. 

In Europe, nearshoring relationships are between clients in larger European economies and various providers in smaller European nations. Major centers are in [[Spain]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}, [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Portugal]], [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Belarus]] and the [[Baltic states|Baltic]]. There are also nearshore centers in larger markets, such as [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]]. These destinations are attractive because they are low-cost, have skilled labor forces, and a less stringent regulatory environment, but crucially they allow for more day to day physical oversight. They also have strong cultural ties to the major economic centers in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A popular type of nearshoring is in software development, with the main benefit being many skilled developers available at low cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nearshore-it.eu/|title=Custom Software Development Company|accessdate=2018-01-22|publisher=nearshore-it.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Call centers, shared services centers, and BPO ([[Business process outsourcing|Business Process Outsourcing]]) are also common choices for nearshoring, as the value of offshore outsourcing hotbeds like Philippines lowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nearshoreamericas.com/philippines-value-proposition-sinks-nearshore-gains-atento/|title=As Philippines Value Prop Sinks, Nearshore Steps Up, Says Atento Exec - Nearshore Americas|date=2017-08-23|work=Nearshore Americas|access-date=2018-08-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The complexity of offshoring stems from different languages and cultures, long distances and different time zones, spending more time and effort on establishing trust and long-term relationships, overriding communication barriers and activities of that kind. Many nearshore providers attempted to circumvent communication and project management barriers by developing new ways to align organizations. As a result, concepts such as [[remote insourcing]] were created to  give clients more control in managing their own projects. Despite recent developments, nearshoring does not necessarily overcome all of the barriers, but the proximity allows more flexibility to align organizations.&lt;ref name="sam" /&gt; 

Nearshoring has become a differentiator for those nations and providers who wish to set themselves apart from sourcing centers in Asia, especially the dominant India, which itself is seeing a sharp decline in BPO job growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nearshoreamericas.com/india-sees-sharp-decline-in-bpo-job-growth/|title=India BPO Reports Sharp Decline in Job Growth - Nearshore Americas|date=2018-04-10|work=Nearshore Americas|access-date=2018-09-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English language is the cornerstone of any Nearshore BPO or IT services operation, and has become a sought-after skill as companies strive to capture a larger chunk of the US market. With the triple helix of university, industry, and government all collaborating to develop the language further, the hunt for skilled, English-speaking talent is slowly becoming easier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nearshoreamericas.com/nearshore-english-evolution/|title=The Nearshore English Evolution - Nearshore Americas|work=Nearshore Americas|access-date=2018-09-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1990, he organized a conference titled ''First International Conference on the Study of Consciousness within Science'' in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bvinst.edu/conferences/1990-at-san-francisco | title = The First International Conference for the Study of Consciousness within Science | accessdate = 2013-02-28 | publisher = Bhaktivedanta Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, in 1997 Gomatam conceived and launched the world's first{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} M.S./Ph.D. programs in "consciousness studies",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bvinst.edu/gradstudies | title = Graduate Studies | accessdate = 2013-02-28 | publisher = Bhaktivedanta Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; in collaboration with the Birla Institute of Technology &amp; Science (BITS), Pilani (one of India's foremost technological universities).  "Consciousness Studies" is a developing, inter-disciplinary scientific field, which Gomatam has particularly re-conceived as a new way of studying ''matter''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bvinst.edu/what-is-consciousness-studies | title = What is Consciousness Studies? | accessdate = 2013-02-28 | last = Gomatam | first = Ravi | date = 2010-06-12 | publisher = Bhaktivedanta Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the Institute of Semantic Information Sciences and Technology started offering M.A. (by research) and Ph.D. programs &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://insist.ac.in/ | title = Institute of Semantic Information Sciences and Technology | accessdate = 2015-12-24 | publisher = InSIST}}&lt;/ref&gt; in collaboration with the Mumbai University, India.

Gomatam’s own field of research is foundations of [[quantum mechanics]], wherein he is introducing a few new ideas, including those of "Objective, Semantic Information" and a notion of "Relational Properties" that is different from that of [[Carlo Rovelli|Rovelli]] and others. His new ideas have received notice for their potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bvinst.edu/appreciations | title = Appreciations | accessdate = 2018-08-31 | publisher = Bhaktivedanta Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--copy of personal communication available with the subject--&gt; He has related research interests in [[semantic computation]], [[systems sciences]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[philosophy of science]] and [[philosophy of language]].&lt;ref name="InSIST"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insist.ac.in/images/pdfs/RGomatam_CV.pdf |title=Resume |publisher=InSIST |accessdate=2015-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early work in the industry==
In the 70s Gomatam worked with India’s international airline on their software development projects. He then moved to the USA and worked as a freelance consultant for a number of [[Fortune 500|Fortune-500]] companies including [[General Motors]], [[Ford]], [[Chrysler]], [[Burroughs Corporation|Burroughs]] and [[International Business Machines|IBM]] in the areas of operating system design, [[data communications]] and very-large database design.&lt;ref name="InSIST"/&gt;

==Academic career==
Starting from the early 80s, Gomatam turned to fundamental scientific research, and started contributing to the development of the  [http://www.bvinst.edu Bhaktivedanta Institute](B.I.) in Mumbai and Berkeley. Along the way, based on the work he was doing at B.I., he obtained his Ph.D. in the foundations of quantum mechanics.&lt;ref name="InSIST"/&gt;

He has been a visiting scholar at [[University of Pretoria]], South Africa and [[Loyola University New Orleans|Loyola University]], New Orleans, USA.&lt;ref name="InSIST"/&gt;

==Research==
Gomatam’s primary area of research is in non-relativistic quantum mechanics (QM), which emerged in 1925 with [[Erwin Schrödinger|Erwin Schrödinger's]] derivation of the "[[wave equation]]".

Gomatam is developing his own approach to [[macroscopic quantum mechanics]] (MQM, applying the wave equation to the macroscopic regime), which is distinct from the ideas of ‘macroscopic dissipative systems’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Influence of Dissipation on Quantum Tunneling in Macroscopic Systems | journal = Physical Review Letters | year = 1981 | first = A. O. | last = Caldeira |author2=Anthony Leggett  | volume = 46 | issue = 4 | pages = 211–214| id = | doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.46.211 | bibcode=1981PhRvL..46..211C}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ‘macroscopic quantum coherence’,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Quantum mechanics versus macroscopic realism: Is the flux there when nobody looks? | journal = Physical Review Letters | year = 1985 | first = Anthony | last = Leggett |author2=Anupam Garg  | volume = 54 | issue = 9 | pages = 857–860| id = | doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.54.857 | bibcode=1985PhRvL..54..857L | pmid = 10031639}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed in the early 80s by [[Anthony James Leggett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Testing the limits of quantum mechanics: motivation, state of play, prospects | journal = Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter | year = 2002 | first = Anthony | last = Leggett | volume = 14 | issue = 15 | pages = R415–451| id = | url = http://iopscience.iop.org/0953-8984/14/15/201|bibcode = 2002JPCM...14..415N |doi = 10.1088/0953-8984/14/3/311 | last2 = Iguchi | first2 = E | last3 = Oohara | first3 = Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, Leggett's attempt is to ''indirectly'' observe [[Quantum superposition|superposition]] at the macroscopic level by ''extending'' current microscopic quantum physics to the macroscopic level. {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

In contrast, Gomatam is attempting to develop MQM ''independent of the application of the Schrödinger equation to the micro regime'', in such a manner that quantum superposition can be ''directly'' observed at the macroscopic level. This involves introducing a new notion of macroscopic objects as quantum ''kinds'', instead of classical ''objects''.&lt;ref name="bvinst"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Gomatam | first1 = Ravi | title = Materialism and Immaterialism in India and the West: Varying Vistas | chapter = Quantum Realism and Haecceity | editors = Partha Ghose | date = 17 Sep 2010  | location = New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, he is also developing two further new ideas within physics: the ontology of "Objective, Semantic Information" (OSI) and corresponding "Relational Properties" (RPs).

As part of developing his version of MQM, Gomatam has related interests in exotic [[manifolds]], semantic information processing, [[quantum computation]], and [[Ordinary language philosophy|philosophy of ordinary language]].&lt;ref name="InSIST"/&gt;

'''Reto Rossetti''' (11 April 1909 – 20 September 1994) was a poet and an [[Esperantist]] professor. He was Italian-Swiss and retained his nationality, although he lived all his life in Britain.  His professional career as a teacher in art colleges culminated as Head of the art education department at Bristol university. His elder brother was [[Cezaro Rossetti]], author of ''[[Kredu min, sinjorino!]]'' (''Believe me, Ma'am!''). He died at [[Gosport]].

== Creative life ==

His poetry appeared in the compendious work, ''[[Kvaropo]]'' (''Foursome'').  Poems by Rossetti used to appear in the [[Esperanto]] (newspaper) press.

With his brother, Cezaro Rossetti (Caesar) he wrote and illustrated 'The Moc Gonnogal' - a collection of poems written as a spoof on the work of the Scottish poet William McGonnogal.

His other works are: ''[[Mestizo de l' Mondo]]'' (''Mestizo of the World''), a collection of poems; ''[[El la Maniko]]'' (''Out of my Sleeve''); and ''[[Pinta krajono]]'' (''Sharp Pencil''), a collection of novellas.  His main translation is ''Otelo'' (''[[Othello]]'') by [[Shakespeare]].  Rossetti did many translations from English poetry.  He was the editor and main collaborator on the ''Angla Antologio''.

Three of his works are on [[William Auld]]'s ''[[:eo:Baza legolisto|Basic Esperanto Reading List]]'':
''[[El la maniko]]'', ''[[33 Rakontoj]]'', ''[[Pinta krajono]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6913">The '''Robot Interaction Language''' ('''ROILA''') is the first spoken language created specifically for talking to robots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2010-07/new-robot-language-lets-you-communicate-multilingual-helper-bots |title=ROILA, a New Spoken Language Designed for Robots|publisher=Popular Science Magazine|date= |accessdate=2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; ROILA is being developed by the Department of Industrial Design at [[Eindhoven University of Technology]]. The major goals of ROILA are that it should be easily learnable by the user, and optimized for efficient recognition by robots. ROILA has a syntax that allows it to be useful for many different kinds of robots, including the [[Roomba]], and [[Lego Mindstorms NXT]]. ROILA is free for anybody to use and to contribute to, as the team has released all documentation and tools under a [[Creative Commons]] license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://roila.org/about/ |title=About |publisher=ROILA |date= |accessdate=2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
ROILA was developed due to the need for a unified language for humans to speak to robots. The designers performed research into the ability of robots to recognize and interpret natural languages. They discovered that natural languages can be very confusing for robots to interpret sometimes, due to elements such as [[homophones]] and [[tenses]]. Based on this research, the team set out to create a [[genetic algorithm]] that would generate an artificial vocabulary in a way that would be easy for a human to pronounce. The algorithm used the most common [[phonemes]] from the most popular natural languages and created easy to pronounce words. The team took the results of this algorithm and formed the ROILA vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scivee.tv/node/19096 |title=Robot Interaction Language (ROILA) &amp;#124; SciVee |publisher=Scivee.tv |date= |accessdate=2012-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312065345/http://www.scivee.tv/node/19096 |archivedate=2012-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
ROILA has an isolating grammar, meaning that it doesn't have suffixes or prefixes added to words to change their meanings. Instead, these changes are constructed by adding word markers that specify what the changes are, such as the tense of the previous verb. For example, in English the suffix “ed” is added to a word to show that it is in the past tense, but in ROILA the marker word “jifi” is placed after the verb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zuras |first=Matthew |url=http://www.switched.com/2010/07/16/will-you-learn-roila-the-robot-language-to-befriend-your-robot/ |title=Will You Learn ROILA, the Robot Language, to Befriend Your Robot Overlords? |publisher=Switched.com |date=2010-07-16 |accessdate=2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vocabulary===
The vocabulary of ROILA was generated by an algorithm designed to create a vocabulary with the least confusion amongst words. Each word generated by this algorithm was assigned a basic meaning, as taken from [[Basic English]]. The words from Basic English that are used the most frequently are assigned to the shortest ROILA words generated by the algorithm. A short list of words in ROILA is included below, along with their English meaning.

===Grammar===
ROILA was designed to have a regular grammar, with no exceptions to anything. All rules apply to all words in a part of speech. Due to the simple isolating type grammar of ROILA whole word markers are added following parts of speech to show the grammatical category. For example, a word marker placed after a verb type would apply a tense, while a word marker applied after a noun type would apply plurality. ROILA has five parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives, and pronouns. The only pronouns are I, you, he, and she.&lt;ref name="Mubin2011"&gt;{{cite thesis |url=https://drhu.eu/reports/2011-OmarMubin-ROILA.pdf#page=54 |title=ROILA: RObot Interaction LAnguage |date=2011 |page=39 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304084619/http://drhu.eu/reports/2011-OmarMubin-ROILA.pdf#page=54 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |dead-url=no |chapter=Parts of Speech |first=Omar |last=Mubin |format=PDF |type=PhD |isbn=978-90-386-2505-8 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sentences follow a [[subject–verb–object]] word order.

'''Ruth Milles''' (19{{nbsp}}April 1873{{snd}}11{{nbsp}}February 1941) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] sculptor and writer. She is mainly known for her [[Bronze sculpture|figurines]] and [[relief]]s.

== Early life and education ==
Milles was born Ruth Anna Maria Anderson on Örby Manor in [[Vallentuna]] near [[Stockholm]], Sweden. She was the daughter of Chief Verifier of the [[brännvin]] manufacturing in Sweden, Emil Anderson (1843–1910), called "Mille". She had two siblings when her mother died in childbirth and gained three half siblings after her father remarried. Her brother was the sculptor [[Carl Milles]] (1875–1955) and her half brother Evert Milles (1885–1960) was an [[architect]].&lt;ref name=slakt&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=G-m |first=H|title =Milles, släkt | encyclopedia =[[Svenskt biografiskt lexikon]] | year =1985–1987

She studied at the ''Tekniska Skolan'' (the Technical School), predecessor to the [[Konstfack|Konstfack University College of Arts, Crafts and Design]] in Stockholm in 1892–93, after which she went on to the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Arts]] in 1894–98, where she was considered talented enough to skip a year. She would also visit the [[Theosophical Society]] which became influential for her future works.&lt;ref name=garden&gt;{{cite web|title=Ruth Milles|url=http://www.millesgarden.se/ruth-milles-596.aspx|website=www.millesgarden.se|publisher=[[Millesgården]]|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
In the autumn of 1898, Milles left for [[Paris]], approximately a year after her brother Carl had moved there. She studied at the [[Académie Colarossi]] and [[École des Beaux-Arts]], and used Paris as base for journeys through France and Germany.&lt;ref name=garden /&gt; Milles and her brother spent much time together in Paris where they collaborated, artistically and economically, in a joint company they started.&lt;ref name=idun&gt;{{cite web|last=E-ER|editor1-last=Nordling|editor1-first=Johan|title=Hos Ruth Milles|url=http://www.ub.gu.se/fasta/laban/erez/kvinnohistoriska/tidskrifter/idun/1908/pdf/1908_26.pdf|website=www.ub.gu.se|publisher=Idun|date=25 June 1908|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, the company sold small [[bronze]] [[Bronze sculpture|figurines]], depicting children and characters from [[fairy tale]]s made by her. She spent the summers in the fishing village Briac in [[Brittany|Bretagne]] where she would draw inspiration from the local fishers' life for her sculptures. Her sculptures were made in an early [[Impressionism|Impressionistic]] style.&lt;ref name=slakt /&gt; While in France, she and her brother changed their surname to Milles after their father's nickname.&lt;ref name=garden /&gt; In 1902, she received an honorary award at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] in Paris.&lt;ref name=slakt /&gt; The next year she fell ill with [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ruth Milles 1873–1941|url=http://www.signaturer.se/Sverige/RuthMilles.htm|website=www.signaturer.se|publisher=signaturer.se|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She travelled back to Sweden and settled down in Islinge on [[Lidingö]],&lt;ref name=slakt /&gt; where she set up a [[studio]] which she sometimes shared with the wife of her brother Carl, Olga Milles.

Milles got many commissions from cultural institutions in Stockholm, among them the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]] for [[Medallion (architecture)|medallions]] and [[Bust (sculpture)|busts]] of the singer [[Jenny Lind]] and the actor Georg Dahlqvist.&lt;ref name=garden /&gt; In 1904–16, she participated in a number of international exhibitions like in [[St. Louis]] (1905) and [[Buenos Aires]] (1910), where she received silver medals for her work,&lt;ref name=garden /&gt;&lt;ref name=idun /&gt; [[Rome]] (1911), the [[Panama–Pacific International Exposition|world's fair]] in [[San Francisco]] (1915) and the Swedish art exhibition in [[Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition]], Denmark (1916). However, her failing health forced her to abandon her sculpturing and she turned first to painting&lt;ref name=idun /&gt; and later to writing instead. She also made illustrations for books, her own and those of other writers.&lt;ref name=slakt /&gt;

In 1932, she moved to Rome. Her health deteriorated, among other things she contracted gangrene and had one of her legs amputated. Milles died in Rome in 1941 and was buried in the [[Protestant Cemetery, Rome]].&lt;ref name=garden /&gt;

Milles is represented in the [[Nationalmuseum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RUTH Anna Maria MILLES|url=http://www.lexikonettamanda.se/show.php?aid=19398|website=www.lexikonettamanda.se|publisher=Konstnärslexikonett Amanda|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Thielska Galleriet]]. There is also a bust and a painting by her in the home (''Strand'' by lake [[Vättern]]) of [[Ellen Key]].&lt;ref name=garden /&gt;

The '''source–filter model''' models speech as a combination of a sound source, such as the [[vocal cords]], and a linear acoustic filter, the [[vocal tract]] (and radiation characteristic).  An important assumption that is often made in the use of the source-filter model is the independence of source and filter.  In such cases, the model should more accurately be referred to as the "independent source-filter model".

While only an approximation, the model is widely used in a number of applications because of its relative simplicity. To varying degrees, different [[phoneme]]s can be distinguished by the properties of their source(s) and their spectral shape. Voiced sounds (e.g., vowels) have (at least) a source due to (mostly) periodic glottal excitation, which can be approximated by an impulse train in the time domain and by harmonics in the frequency domain, and a filter that depends on, e.g., tongue position and lip protrusion. On the other hand, fricatives have (at least) a source due to turbulent noise produced at a constriction in the oral cavity (e.g., the sounds represented orthographically by "s" and "f"). So called ''voiced fricatives'' (such as "z" and "v") have two sources - one at the glottis and one at the supra-glottal constriction.

The source-filter model is used in both [[speech synthesis]] and speech [[Voice analysis|analysis]], and is related to [[linear prediction]].  The development of the model is due, in large part, to the early work of [[Gunnar Fant]], although others, notably [[Ken Stevens]], have also contributed substantially to the models underlying acoustic analysis of speech and speech synthesis.

In implementation of the source-filter model of speech production, the sound source, or excitation signal, is often modelled as a periodic impulse train, for voiced speech, or white noise for unvoiced speech. The vocal tract filter is, in the simplest case, approximated by an all-pole filter, where the coefficients are obtained by performing linear prediction to minimize the mean-squared error in the speech signal to be reproduced. Convolution of the excitation signal with the filter response then produces the synthesised speech.

A '''speech-to-text reporter''' ('''STTR'''), also known as a '''captioner''', is a person who listens to what is being said and inputs it, word for word ([[wikt:verbatim|verbatim]]), using an electronic shorthand keyboard or speech recognition software and a CAT software system. Their keyboard or speech recognition software is linked to a computer, which converts this information to properly spelled words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.captions.org/2006/02/captioning-students-thoughts.html |title=Closed Captioning Web |publisher=Captions.org |date=2006-02-13 |accessdate=2009-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reproduced text could then be read by deaf or hard-of-hearing people.

The latest in speech-to-text reporters are called Voice writers.  Voicewriting is a method used for court reporting, and it is also used by some medical transcriptionists. Using the voicewriting method, a court reporter speaks directly into a stenomask or '''voice''' silencer—a hand-held mask containing one or two microphones and '''voice'''-dampening materials.  A voice writing system consists of a [[stenomask]], an external sound digitizer, a laptop, speech recognition software, and CAT software. A foot pedal can plug into a computer's USB port.

A real-time voice writer's words go through the mask's cable to an external USB digital signal processor, From there the words go into the computer's speech recognition engine, for conversion into streaming text. The reporter can send the streamed text to a) the Internet; b) a computer file; c) a television station for subtitling; d) to an end-user who is reading the captions via their laptop, tablet, smart phone, or e) software which formats the results in a way most familiar to judges, attorneys, or subtitling consumers.

Voice writers enjoy very high accuracy rates, based upon pure physiology. The route taken by a person's words goes from the mouth to the reporter's ear, brain, and "inner" voice. This form of repetition is naturally effortless; it is what we all do in our daily conversation, as we listen to a person speak, or when we read a book. So the most natural extension of this process is to psychologically switch the repetition mechanism from "inner voice" to the physiological "spoken voice." Therefore, we minimize the introduction of cognitive overhead in our task of routing the spoken word to its permanent destination as printed words. This streamlined process allows voice writers to achieve excellent performance for many continuous hours and greater than 98 percent accuracy at speeds as high as 350 words per minute.

Voice writers produce the same products as their stenotype colleagues, including transcripts in all electronic and printed formats. Realtime verbatim reporters connect their laptops to captioning equipment, real-time viewer programs, and provide attorneys or other clients with computer files at the end of the sessions. Only the physical way of capturing speakers' words differentiates voice writing from other methods of court reporting. Every other aspect of this profession is the same, with the exception of the time required to learn the skill, which is much shorter with voice writing.

Other ways of producing speech-to-text:  There are two types of keyboard used in the UK: the Palantype system and the [[Stenograph]] system. Hence STTRs are also sometimes referred to as '''palantypists''' and '''stenographers'''. Unlike a [[QWERTY]] keyboard, not every letter in a word is pressed, but several keys will be pressed at once which represent whole words, phrases or shortforms. Specially designed [[computer software]] will then convert these [[Phonetics|phonetic]] chords back into English which can then be displayed for someone to read.

The computer software can use a pre-programmed vocabulary specific to the context, information that matches syllable clusters to written forms, and may suggest alternative captions from which the STTR chooses.  Errors occur from the STTR mishearing the words and from the need for the STTR to make a decision before an ambiguous statement is made clear by what is said next.

The [[professional association]] for STTRs is the Association of Verbatim Speech-to-Text Reporters.  The Council for Advanced Communication with Deaf People and the Royal National Institute for the Deaf also give more information about STTRs.

== What will a service user see on the screen? ==
Every word that is spoken will appear on the screen in an accessible format, although one can request a change in the color and font size. As well as every word spoken, the words "NEW SPEAKER:" will typically appear to denote when the speaker changes. If one sends the STTR (voice writer/palantypist/stenographer) the names of people attending the conference or meeting before the event, they, too, can be programmed into the computer, making it easier for one to recognize who is speaking.  Other phrases, in curly brackets, may also appear, such as {laughter} or {applause}, to denote relevant events.

Occasional [[mondegreen]] errors may be seen in closed-captions when the computer software fails to distinguish where a word break occurs in the syllable stream.  For example, a news report of a "grand parade" might be captioned as a "grandpa raid". Mondegreens in this context arise from the need for captions to keep up with the fast pace of live television broadcasts.

== History ==
Many STTRs began their careers as [[court reporter]]s. In the courts, the system was used to record proceedings and provide transcripts when requested. The skills developed in this area have also made them invaluable in the field of communication with deaf people, as they are used to producing work with an extremely high degree of accuracy and acting with complete discretion at all times. An STTR expects to reach consistent levels of accuracy of 98.5% and above.

== Training==
In order to become an STTR one needs extensive training, typically two years, if a Palantype/Stenograph and the associated software, plus at least a further two years of practice, building up speed, accuracy, dictionary/vocabulary and gaining experience.

If becoming a [[Voice writer|voice writing STTR]], the training is somewhat shorter, though nevertheless, just as strenuous.  Two years to learn the art of voice writing includes the associated software and required practice, building up speed, accuracy, dictionary/vocabulary and gaining experience.

Only then is one ready to undertake the USA and/or UK Examinations for Certification.  In the USA, NVRA and NCRA offer certifications that demonstrate the necessary training.

There are many levels of certification.  NVRA certifies voice writers as court reporters, realtime reporters, CART providers, and broadcast captioners.  Beyond any licensing considerations, NVRA certification clearly demonstrates that the voice writer has attained a level of professionalism and skill well above that of others in the field.

The NVRA certification testing program is available to all members.  Tests are held at regular intervals throughout the year in various locations across the country.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nvra.org/nvra-certifications|title=NVRA certifications|website=nvra.org|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, Unitised CACDP Examinations and membership with the CACDP Register, confirms that one has reached the required minimum standard.  The majority of Registered STTRs are also Members of the Association of Verbatim Speech-to-Text Reporters.

'''''The Klingon Dictionary (TKD)''''' is a book by [[Marc Okrand]] describing the [[Klingon language]]. First published in 1985 and then again with an addendum in 1992, it includes pronunciation, [[Klingon grammar|grammar]] and vocabulary. It has sold more than three hundred thousand copies &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Arika|last=Okrent|title=In the Land of Invented Languages: Esperanto Rock Stars, Klingon Poets, Loglan Lovers, and the Mad Dreamers Who Tried to Build A Perfect Language|publisher=[[Spiegel &amp; Grau]]|year=2009|page=272|isbn=0-385-52788-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been translated into five languages.

The book is a description of the grammar with a few examples for every rule. It is not suitable for active learning and practice of the language, because it does not contain any exercises. It has never been intended as a learning book. Its source was intended as a guide for scriptwriters and actors. It was only later sold for merchandising for ''Star Trek'' fans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.angelfire.com/trek/yensw/PDF/thesis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==
The dictionary is written from an in-universe perspective. After a brief introduction about the Klingon culture and also how the book has been written, the pronunciation of the Klingon letters is described. Instead of using [[International Phonetic Alphabet|phonetic]] symbols, the letters of the [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] are used, some of them written in [[Letter case|upper case]] to distinguish special pronunciations. For instance '''q''' and '''Q''' are different sounds, and the combination '''ng''' is considered as one single letter. The largest part of the book is a description of the grammar, including briefly described rules sorted by type of words, accompanied by a few examples for each grammatical topic. The last part of the book contains a list of vocabulary with roughly 1,500 words, followed by a list of useful phrases. The [[addendum]] of 1992 contains some new grammatical details and a list of about 200 new words that appeared in or were created for later [[Star Trek (film series)|movies]] and in the television series ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''.

== Digital editions ==
Since 2008, the book is available for [[E-book]] readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.de/The-Star-Trek-Dictionary-ebook/dp/B003BFXAQM |title=The Star Trek: The Klingon Dictionary eBook: Marc Okrand: Amazon.de: Kindle-Shop |publisher=Amazon.de |date=2009-09-09 |accessdate=2013-10-21|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, publisher Simon &amp; Schuster introduced an [[iPhone]] application version of ''The Klingon Dictionary'' as part of three applications rolled into a Klingon Language Suite. The new digital format features a precise pronunciation guide, rules for proper use of affixes and suffixes, and a search menu.

== Translations ==
The dictionary was first translated into [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and published in [[Brazil]] in 1995. Its title was simply ''Dicionário da língua klingon''.

The following translation was [[German language|German]] in 1996 bearing the title ''Das offizielle Wörterbuch Klingonisch/Deutsch'' ("The Official Klingon-German Dictionary"). That book contains many [[Typographical error|typos]] and incorrect translations, which can be misleading when learning the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qephom.de/d/dowfehler.html |title=klingonisch.net - Liste der Fehler im Deutschen Wörterbuch |publisher=Qephom.de |date=2013-08-19 |accessdate=2013-10-21|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; A revised version, corrected by Klingon teacher [[Lieven Litaer]], was released in 2013.

The [[Italian language|Italian]] translation was published in 1998 by the Roman publisher [[Fanucci Editore]] and named ''Il dizionario Klingon-Italiano'' ("The Klingon-Italian Dictionary").

In 2008, the dictionary was translated into [[Czech language|Czech]] with the title ''Klingonský slovník'' (''Klingon Dictionary'').

There is an online 1998–2009 [[Swedish language|Swedish]] translation, ''Klingonsk ordbok'', (with Swedish examples and with additional material from later canonical works&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kli.org/wiki/canonical_sources "Canonical sources", ''Klingon Language Institute Wiki'']&lt;/ref&gt;) to be found at the Klingonska Akademien website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://klingonska.org/klo/ ''Klingonsk ordbok. Arbetskopia'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trivia ==
* In the season 2 episode "The Panty Piñata Polarization" of ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', the dictionary is being used during a game of Klingon [[Boggle]].
* In the season 10 episode 7 of ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', while Sheldon and Amy are having supper with Leonard and Penny, Sheldon speaks Klingon with Leonard to hide what they are speaking about in front of the girls.

== Follow up ==
New vocabulary and grammar rules, published after 1992, can be found in two audio-courses and two more books by Marc Okrand, and in the scholarly journal ''HolQeD'' published by the [[Klingon Language Institute]] (1992-2004):

'''Timber framing''' and '''"post-and-beam" construction''' are traditional methods of building with heavy timbers, creating structures using squared-off and carefully fitted and joined timbers with joints secured by large wooden pegs. It is commonplace in wooden buildings from the 19th century and earlier. If the structural frame of load-bearing timber is left exposed on the exterior of the building it may be referred to as '''half-timbered''', and in many cases the infill between timbers will be used for decorative effect. The country most known for this kind of architecture is [[Germany]]. Timber framed houses are spread all over the country.

The method comes from working directly from logs and tree rather than pre-cut [[Lumber#Dimensional lumber| dimensional lumber]]. [[Hewing]] this with [[broadaxe]]s, [[adze]]s, and [[draw knife|draw knives]] and using hand-powered [[brace (tool)|braces]] and [[auger (drill)|augers]] (brace and bit) and other [[woodworking]] tools, artisans or framers could gradually assemble a building. 

Since this building method has been used for thousands of years in many parts of the world, many styles of historic framing have developed. These styles are often categorized by the type of foundation, walls, how and where the beams intersect, the use of curved timbers, and the roof framing details.

==Box frame==
A simple timber frame made of straight vertical and horizontal pieces with a common rafter roof without [[purlin]]s.  The term ''box frame'' is not well defined and has been used for any kind of framing (with the usual exception of cruck framing). The distinction presented here is that the roof load is carried by the exterior walls. Purlins are also found even in plain timber frames.

==Cruck frame==
[[File:Cruck Building, Weobley, Herefordshire - geograph.org.uk - 12580.jpg|thumb|A "true" or "full" [[cruck]] half-timbered building in [[Weobley]], [[Herefordshire]], England: The cruck blades are the tall, curved timbers which extend from near the ground to the ridge.]]

A [[cruck]] is a pair of crooked or curved timbers&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; which form a [[bent (structural)|bent]] (U.S.) or crossframe (UK); the individual timbers are each called a blade. More than 4,000 cruck frame buildings have been recorded in the UK. Several types of cruck frames are used; more information follows in English style below and at the main article [[Cruck]].

* True cruck or full cruck: blades, straight or curved, extend from ground or foundation to the ridge acting as the principal rafters. A full cruck does not need a tie beam.
* Base cruck: tops of the blades are truncated by the first transverse member such as by a tie beam.
* Raised cruck: blades land on masonry wall, and extend to the ridge.
* Middle cruck: blades land on masonry wall, and are truncated by a collar.
* Upper cruck: blades land on a tie beam, very similar to [[knee rafter]]s.
* Jointed cruck: blades are made from pieces joined near eaves in a number of ways. See also: [[hammerbeam roof]]
* End cruck is not a style, but on the gable end of a building.

==Aisled frame==
[[File:Interior of Market Hall - geograph.org.uk - 966178.jpg|thumb|Interior of a two-aisled market hall, [[Chipping Campden]], [[Gloucestershire]], England]] 
Aisled frames have one or more rows of interior posts. These interior posts typically carry more [[structural load]] than the posts in the exterior walls. This is the same concept of the aisle in church buildings, sometimes called a [[hall church]], where the center aisle is technically called a [[nave]]. However, a nave is often called an aisle, and three-aisled [[barn]]s are common in the U.S., the Netherlands, and Germany. Aisled buildings are wider than the simpler box-framed or cruck-framed buildings, and typically have purlins supporting the rafters. In northern Germany, this construction is known as variations of a'' [[Ständerhaus]]''. {{Clear}}

==Half-timbering==
[[File:Fachwerk-Konstruktion-2004.jpg|thumb|Half-timbered wall with three kinds of infill, [[wattle and daub]], brick, and stone: The plaster coating which originally covered the infill and timbers is mostly gone. This building is in the central German city of [[Bad Langensalza]].]]

'''Half-timbering''' refers to a structure with a frame of [[load-bearing wall|load-bearing]] timber, creating spaces between the timbers called panels (in German ''Gefach'' or ''Fächer''), which are then filled-in with some kind of nonstructural material known as [[infill wall|infill]]. The frame is often left exposed on the exterior of the building.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolas Davies, Erkki Jokiniemi: 2008. ''Dictionary of architecture and building construction''. Architectural Press. {{ISBN|978-0-7506-8502-3}}. 726 pages: pp 181&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infill materials===
The earliest known type of infill, called ''[[opus craticum]]'' by the Romans, was a [[wattle and daub]] type construction.&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvious, De Architectura, Book II, Chapter 8, paragraph 20&lt;/ref&gt; ''Opus craticum'' is now confusingly applied to a Roman stone/mortar infill as well. Similar methods to wattle and daub were also used and known by various names, such as clam staff and daub, cat-and-clay, or ''torchis'' (French), to name only three.

Wattle and daub was the most common infill in ancient times. The sticks were not always technically wattlework (woven), but also individual sticks installed vertically, horizontally, or at an angle into holes or grooves in the framing. The coating of daub has many recipes, but generally was a mixture of clay and chalk with a binder such as grass or straw and water or urine.&lt;ref&gt;Sunshine, Paula. ''Wattle and daub''. Princes Risborough: Shire Publications, 2006. 7-8. Print. {{ISBN|0747806527}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the manufacturing of bricks increased, brick infill replaced the less durable infills and became more common. Stone laid in mortar as an infill was used in areas where stone rubble and mortar were available.

Other infills include ''[[bousillage]]'', fired [[brick]], unfired brick such as [[adobe]] or [[mudbrick]], stones sometimes called ''[[pierrotage]]'', planks as in the German ''[[standerbohlenbau]]'', timbers as in ''standerblockbau'', or rarely [[Cob (material)|cob]] without any wooden support.&lt;ref&gt;Glick, Thomas F., Steven John Livesey, and Faith Wallis. ''Medieval science, technology, and medicine: an encyclopedia''. New York: Routledge, 2005. 229. Print. {{ISBN|0415969301}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wall surfaces on the interior were often “ceiled” with [[wainscoting]] and plastered for [[thermal insulation|warmth]] and appearance.

Brick infill sometimes called [[brick nog|nogging]] became the standard infill after the manufacturing of bricks made them more available and less expensive. Half-timbered walls may be covered by siding materials including [[plaster#Cement plaster|plaster]], [[weatherboarding]], [[tile]]s, or slate shingles.&lt;ref name="Pollard 2006 710–711"&gt;{{cite book |last= Pollard| first= Richard |authorlink= |author2=[[Nikolaus Pevsner]] |title= The Buildings of England: Lancashire: Liverpool and the South-West |edition= |publisher= [[Yale University Press]] |year= 2006 |location= New Haven and London |pages= 710–711| url= |doi= |id= |isbn= 0-300-10910-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The infill may be covered by other materials, including [[weatherboarding]] or [[tile]]s.&lt;ref name="Pollard 2006 710–711"/&gt; or left exposed. When left exposed, both the framing and infill were sometimes done in a decorative manner. Germany is famous for its decorative half-timbering and the figures sometimes have names and meanings. The decorative manner of half-timbering is promoted in Germany by the [[German Timber-Frame Road]], several planned routes people can drive to see notable examples of ''Fachwerk'' buildings.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===History of the term===
The term half-timbering is not as old as the German name ''Fachwerk'' or the French name ''colombage'', but it is the standard English name for this style. One of the first people to publish the term "half-timbered" was [[Mary Martha Sherwood]] (1775–1851), who employed it in her book, ''The Lady of the Manor'', published in several volumes from 1823 to 1829. She uses the term picturesquely: "...passing through a gate in a quickset hedge, we arrived at the porch of an old half-timbered cottage, where an aged man and woman received us."&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, Mary Martha. ''The lady of the manor being a series of conversations on the subject of confirmation. Intended for the use of the middle and higher ranks of young females'', Volume 5. Wellington, Salop. London: Printed by and for F. Houlston and Son. 1827. 168. Print. https://books.google.com/books?id=teYKAAAAYAAJ&lt;/ref&gt; By 1842, half-timbered had found its way into ''The Encyclopedia of Architecture'' by [[Joseph Gwilt]] (1784–1863). This [[wikt:juxtaposition|juxtaposition]] of exposed timbered beams and infilled spaces created the distinctive "half-timbered", or occasionally termed, "[[Tudor period|Tudor]]" style, or "black-and-white".

===Oldest examples===
The most ancient known half-timbered building is called the House of ''opus craticum''. It was buried by the eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]] in 79 AD in Herculaneum, Italy. ''[[Opus craticum]]'' was mentioned by [[Vitruvius]] in his books on architecture as a timber frame with wattlework infill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/2*.html#8.20|title=LacusCurtius • Vitruvius de Architectura — Liber Secundus|author=|date=|website=penelope.uchicago.edu|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same term is used to describe timber frames with an infill of stone rubble laid in mortar the Romans called ''opus incertum''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Nigel Guy. ''Encyclopedia of ancient Greece''. London: Routledge, 2006. 82. Print. {{ISBN|0415973341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative meanings===
[[File:Kluge 2012 01.jpg|thumb|A variation of the second meaning of half-timbered: the ground floor is log and the upper floor is framed (half-timbered in the first sense). [[Kluge House]], Montana, U.S.]]

A less common meaning of the term "half-timbered" is found in the fourth edition of John Henry Parker's ''Classic Dictionary of Architecture'' (1873) which distinguishes full-timbered houses from half-timbered, with half-timber houses having a ground floor in stone&lt;ref&gt;Joyn Henry Parker, 1875. ''Classic Dictionary of Architecture'', 4th ed. Facsimile published in 1986 by New Orchard Editions, Poole, Dorset, pp. 178-179&lt;/ref&gt; or [[log building|logs]] such as the [[Kluge House]] which was a log cabin with a timber-framed second floor.

==Structure==
[[File:Chevilles en bois dans une charpente ancienne.jpg|thumb|left|Joints in an ancient French roof; the wooden pegs hold the [[mortise and tenon]] joinery together.]]
[[File:DoubleJettiedBuilding.jpg|thumb|right|Projecting ("[[jettying|jettied"]]) upper storeys of an English half-timbered village terraced house, the jetties plainly visible]]
[[File:Timber Frame before peging.JPG|thumb|This is a part of a timber frame, before pegs are inserted.|left]]

Traditional timber framing is the method of creating framed structures of heavy timber jointed together with various joints, commonly and originally with lap jointing, and then later pegged mortise and tenon joints. &lt;!--Lengthening scarf joints. (How does this bit fit in?)--&gt; [[Cross bracing|Diagonal bracing]] is used to prevent "racking", or movement of structural vertical beams or posts.&lt;ref name="Nortrud G. Schrammel-Schäl 1987" &gt;Nortrud G. Schrammel-Schäl, Karl Kessler, Paul-Georg Custodis, Kreisverwaltung des Westerwaldkreises in Montabaur. ''Fachwerk im Westerwald: Landschaftsmuseum Westerwald, Hachenburg, Ausstellung vom 11. September 1987 bis 30. April 1988''. Landschaftsmuseum Westerwald: 1987. {{ISBN|978-3-921548-37-0}}. 78 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, German (and other) master carpenters would [[treenail|peg]] the joints with allowance of about an inch (25&amp;nbsp;mm), enough room for the wood to move as it 'seasoned', then cut the pegs, and drive the beam home fully into its socket.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

To cope with variable sizes and shapes of hewn (by [[adze]] or axe) and sawn timbers, two main carpentry methods were employed: scribe carpentry and square rule carpentry.

Scribing or [[coping (joinery)|coping]] was used throughout Europe, especially from the 12th century to the 19th century, and subsequently imported to North America, where it was common into the early 19th century. In a scribe frame, timber sockets are fashioned or "tailor-made" to fit their corresponding timbers; thus, each timber piece must be numbered (or "scribed").

Square-rule carpentry was developed in [[New England]] in the 18th century. It used housed joints in main timbers to allow for interchangeable braces and girts. Today, standardized timber sizing means that timber framing can be incorporated into mass-production methods as per the joinery industry, especially where timber is cut by precision [[numerical control|computer numerical control]] &lt;!-- (CNC) --&gt; machinery.

===Jetties===
{{details|Jettying}}
A jetty is an upper floor which sometimes historically used a structural horizontal beam, supported on cantilevers, called a [[bressummer]] or 'jetty bressummer' to bear the weight of the new wall, projecting outward from the preceding floor or storey.

In the city of [[York]] in the [[United Kingdom]], the famous street known as [[The Shambles]] exemplifies this, where jettied houses seem to almost touch above the street.

===Timbers===
[[File:timber frame.jpg|thumb|The completed frame of a modern timber-frame house]]
[[File:StänderbauRähmbau.png|thumb|Ridge-post framing (left) and story framing (right, with jetties)]]
Historically, the timbers would have been hewn square using a felling axe and then surface-finished with a broadaxe. If required, smaller timbers were ripsawn from the hewn baulks using pitsaws or frame saws. Today, timbers are more commonly bandsawn, and the timbers may sometimes be machine-[[plane (tool)|planed]] on all four sides.

The vertical timbers include:
* [[column|posts]] (main supports at corners and other major uprights),
* [[wall stud]]s (subsidiary upright limbs in framed walls), for example, [[close studding]].

The horizontal timbers include:
* sill-beams (also called ground-sills or sole-pieces, at the bottom of a wall into which posts and studs are fitted using tenons),
* noggin-pieces (the horizontal timbers forming the tops and bottoms of the frames of infill panels),
* wall-plates (at the top of timber-framed walls that support the [[truss]]es and [[joist]]s of the roof).

When jettying, horizontal elements can include:
* The jetty bressummer (or breastsummer), where the main [[sill plate|sill]] (horizontal piece) on which the projecting wall above rests, stretches across the whole width of the jetty wall. The bressummer is itself cantilevered forward, beyond the wall below it.
* The dragon-beam which runs diagonally from one corner to another, and supports the corner posts above and supported by the corner posts below
* The jetty beams or [[joist]]s  conform t floor dimensions above, but are at right angles to the jetty-plates that conform to the shorter dimensions of "roof" of the floor below. Jetty beams are mortised at 45° into the sides of the dragon beams. They are the main constituents of the cantilever system, and determine how far the jetty projects.
* The jetty-plates are designed to carry the jetty beams. The jetty plates themselves are supported by the corner posts of the recessed floor below.

The sloping timbers include:
* [[Truss]]es (the slanting timbers forming the triangular framework at [[gable]]s and [[roof]])
* [[brace (architecture)|Braces]] (slanting beams giving extra support between horizontal or vertical members of the timber frame)
* [[herringbone strutting|Herringbone]] bracing (a decorative and supporting style of frame, usually at 45° to the upright and horizontal directions of the frame)

===Post construction and frame construction===
There were two different systems of the position of posts and studs:
* In the older manner, called post construction, the vertical elements continue from the groundwork to the roof. This post construction in German is called ''Geschossbauweise'' or ''Ständerbauweise''. It is somewhat similar to [[balloon framing]] method common in North America until the middle of the 20th century.
* In the advanced manner, called frame construction, each story is constructed like a case, and the whole building is constructed like a pile of such cases. This frame construction in German is called ''Rähmbauweise'' or ''Stockwerksbauweise''.

[[Ridge-post framing]] is a structurally simple and ancient [[post and lintel]] framing where the posts extend all the way to the ridge beams. Germans call this ''[[:de:Firstsäule|Firstsäule]]'' or ''Hochstud''.

===Modern features===

In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], timber-frame construction has been revived since the 1970s, and is now{{when|date=September 2018}} experiencing a thriving renaissance of the ancient skills.{{fact|date=September 2018}} This is largely due to such practitioners as [[Steve Chappell (author)|Steve Chappell]]{{who|date=September 2018}}, [[Jack Sobon]]{{who|date=September 2018}}, and [[Tedd Benson]]{{who|date=September 2018}}, who studied old plans and techniques and revived a long-neglected technique. Once a handcrafted skill passed down, timber-frame construction has now been modernized with the help of modern industrial tools such as [[CNC]] machines.These machines and [[mass-production]] techniques have assisted growth and made for more affordable frames and shorter lead-times for projects.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

Timber-framed structures differ from conventional wood-framed buildings in several ways. Timber framing uses fewer, larger wooden members, commonly timbers in the range of 15 to 30&amp;nbsp;cm (6 to 12 in), while common wood framing uses many more timbers with dimensions usually in the 5- to 25-cm (2- to 10-in) range. The methods of fastening the frame members also differ. In conventional framing, the members are joined using [[nail (fastener)|nails]] or other mechanical fasteners, whereas timber framing uses the traditional mortise and tenon or more complex joints that are usually fastened using only wooden pegs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vermonttimberworks.com/home/framing/joinery/index.html |title=joinery descriptives |publisher=Vermonttimberworks.com |accessdate=2012-04-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321191354/http://www.vermonttimberworks.com/home/framing/joinery/index.html |archivedate=2012-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern complex structures and timber trusses often incorporate steel joinery such as gusset plates, for both structural and architectural purposes.

Recently, it has become common practice to enclose the timber structure entirely in manufactured panels such as [[structural insulated panel]]s (SIPs). Although the timbers can only be seen from inside the building when so enclosed, construction is less complex and insulation is greater than in traditional timber building. SIPs are "an insulating foam core sandwiched between two structural facings, typically oriented strand board" according to the Structural Insulated Panel Association.&lt;ref name="Structural Insulated Panel Association"&gt;{{cite web|title=What Are SIPs?|url=http://www.sips.org/about/what-are-sips/|accessdate=1 February 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210162642/http://www.sips.org/about/what-are-sips/|archivedate=10 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; SIPs reduce dependency on bracing and auxiliary members, because the panels span considerable distances and add rigidity to the basic timber frame.

An alternate construction method is with concrete flooring with extensive use of glass. This allows a very solid construction combined with open architecture. Some firms have specialized in industrial prefabrication of such residential and light commercial structures such as [[Huf Haus]] as [[low-energy house]]s or&amp;nbsp;– dependent on location&amp;nbsp;– [[zero-energy building]]s.

[[Straw-bale construction]] is another alternative where straw bales are stacked for nonload-bearing infill with various finishes applied to the interior and exterior such as stucco and plaster. This appeals to the traditionalist and the environmentalist as this is using "found" materials to build.

Mudbricks also called adobe are sometimes used to fill in timber-frame structures. They can be made on site and offer exceptional fire resistance. Such buildings must be designed to accommodate the poor thermal insulating properties of mudbrick, however, and usually have deep eaves or a veranda on four sides for weather protection.

==History and traditions==
[[File:Anne Hvides Gaard Svendborg.jpg|thumb|right|[[Anne Hvides Gaard]], [[Svendborg]], [[Denmark]], from 1560]]
[[File:Anne Hathaways Cottage 1 (5662418953).jpg|thumb|right|[[Anne Hathaway's Cottage]] in [[Warwickshire]], England: Its timber framing is typical of vernacular [[Tudor architecture]]]]
The techniques used in timber framing date back to [[Neolithic]] times, and have been used in many parts of the world during various periods such as ancient [[Japan]], continental Europe, and Neolithic [[Denmark]], [[England]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Spain]], parts of the [[Roman Empire]], and [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Williams, 1971.''Roman Building-Materials in South-East England'' in ''Britannia, Vol. 2, (1971), pp. 166–195''. Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies. Accessed via jstor.org/stable/525807&lt;/ref&gt; The timber-framing technique has historically been popular in climate zones which favour deciduous [[hardwood]] trees, such as [[oak]]. Its most northernmost areas are [[Baltic countries]] and southern [[Sweden]]. Timber framing is rare in Russia, Finland, northern Sweden, and Norway, where tall and straight lumber, such as pine and spruce, is readily available and [[log house]]s were favored, instead.

Half-timbered construction in the Northern European vernacular building style is characteristic of medieval and early modern Denmark, England, Germany, and parts of France and Switzerland, where timber was in good supply yet stone and associated skills to dress the stonework were in short supply. In half-timbered construction, timbers that were [[wood splitting|riven]] (split) in half provided the complete skeletal framing of the building.

Europe is full of timber-framed structures dating back hundreds of years, including manors, castles, homes, and inns, whose architecture and techniques of construction have evolved over the centuries. In Asia, timber-framed structures are found, many of them temples that have stood for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timber Framing History|url=http://www.timberframe1.com/post-and-beam-homes-university/history|accessdate=27 November 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202230859/http://www.timberframe1.com/post-and-beam-homes-university/history|archivedate=2 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Roman carpentry preserved in [[anoxic event|anoxic]] layers of [[clay]] at [[Romano-British]] [[villa]] sites demonstrate that sophisticated Roman [[carpentry]] had all the necessary techniques for this construction. The earliest surviving (French) half-timbered buildings date from the 12th century.

Important resources for the study and appreciation of historic building methods are [[open-air museum]]s.

===Topping out ceremony===
The [[topping out]] ceremony is a [[builders' rites|builders' rite]], an ancient tradition thought to have originated in Scandinavia by 700 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Abrams in Why Do Clocks Run Clockwise? And Other Imponderables.&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., a bough or small tree is attached to the peak of the timber frame after the frame is complete as a celebration. Historically, it was common for the master carpenter to give a speech, make a toast, and then break the glass. In Northern Europe, a wreath made for the occasion is more commonly used rather than a bough. In Japan, the "ridge raising" is a religious ceremony called the ''jotoshiki''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnaqua.org/newsroom/Topping_out_History.asp|title=- Tennessee Aquarium|first=Tennessee|last=Aquarium|date=|website=www.tnaqua.org|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811050255/http://www.tnaqua.org/newsroom/Topping_out_History.asp|archivedate=11 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, it is called the ''[[:de:Richtfest|Richtfest]]''.

===Carpenters' marks===
&lt;!--Carpenters marks and assembly marks redirect here--&gt;
{{Commons category|Carpenters marks}}
Carpenters' marks is a general term for markings left on the timbers of wooden buildings during construction.
* Assembly or marriage marks  were used to identify the individual timbers. Assembly marks include numbering to identify the pieces of the frame. The numbering can be similar to Roman numerals except the number four is IIII and nine is VIIII. These marks are chiseled, cut with a [[race knife]] (a tool to cut lines and circles in wood), or saw cuts. The numbering can also be in Arabic numerals which are often written with a red grease pencil or crayon. German and French carpenters made some unique marks. ([[:de:Abbundzeichen|Abbundzeichen (German assembly marks)]]).
* Layout marks left over from [[marking out]] identify the place where to cut joints and bore peg holes; carpenters also marked the location on a timber where they had levelled it, as part of the building process, and called these "level lines";  sometimes they made a mark two feet from a critical location, which was then called the "two-foot mark". These marks are typically scratched on the timber with an awl-like tool until later in the 19th century, when they started using pencils.
* Occasionally, carpenters or owners marked a date and/or their initials in the wood, but not like masons left [[masons mark]]s.
* Boards on the building may have "[[tally marks]]" cut into them which were numbers used to keep track of quantities of lumber (timber).
* Other markings in old buildings are called "ritual marks", which were often signs the occupants felt would protect them from harm.

===Tools===
[[File:Zimmermann 1880.jpg|thumb|German carpenters in 1880: The tools, from left to right, are: a cart loaded with timbers, rough [[hewing]] with felling axes; in the green coat is the master carpenter carrying his tools including a [[frame saw]]; on the ground, a ring dog (precursor to the [[cant dog]] and [[peavey (tool)|peavey]]); in the background sawyers [[pit saw]]ing on trestles; on right carpenters striking a mortising chisel with a mallet and boring a hole with a T-auger; lower right on ground a two-man [[crosscut saw]], [[steel square]], [[broadaxe]], and (hard to see) a [[froe]].|300x300px]]

Many historic hand tools used by timber framers for thousands of years have similarities, but vary in shape. Electrically powered tools first became available in the 1920s in the U.S. and continue to evolve. See the [[list of timber framing tools]] for basic descriptions and images of unusual tools (The list is incomplete at this time).

===British tradition===

Some of the earliest known timber houses in Europe have been found in [[Great Britain]], dating to [[Neolithic]] times; [[Balbridie]] and [[Flag Fen|Fengate]] are some of the rare examples of these constructions.

Half-timbered construction traveled with [[British colonization of the Americas|British colonists to North America]] in the early 17th century but was soon abandoned in [[New England]] and the mid-Atlantic colonies for clapboard facings (an [[East Anglia]] tradition). The original English colonial settlements, such as [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]] and [[Jamestown, Virginia]] had timber-framed buildings, rather than the [[log cabin]]s often associated with the American frontier. [[Living history]] programs demonstrating the building technique are available at both these locations.

Historic timber frame construction in England (and the rest of the United Kingdom) showed regional variation &lt;ref&gt;Cruck Construction: an introduction and catalogue (CBA Research Report 42), pp. 61-92.&lt;/ref&gt; which has been divided into the "eastern school", the "western school", and the "northern school", although the characteristic types of framing in these schools can be found in the other regions (except the northern school).&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;Brown, R. J.. Timber-framed buildings of England. London: R. Hale Ltd. 1997.46-48. {{ISBN|0709060920}}&lt;/ref&gt; A characteristic of the eastern school is [[close studding]] which is a half-timbering style of many studs spaced about the width of the studs apart (for example six inch studs spaced six inches apart) until the middle of the 16th century and sometimes wider spacing after that time. Close studding was an elite style found mostly on expensive buildings. A principal style of the western school is the use of square panels of roughly equal size and decorative framing utilizing many shapes such as [[lozenge]]s, stars, crosses, [[quatrefoil]]s, [[Wikt:cusp|cusps]], and many other shapes.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; The northern school sometimes used posts which landed on the foundation rather than on a sill beam, the sill joining to the sides of the posts and called an interrupted sill. Another northern style was to use close studding but in a herring-bone or chevron pattern.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;

[[File:The Barley Barn Roof Structure.JPG|right|thumb|Roof structure of the Barley Barn, Cressing Temple, Essex]]As houses were modified to cope with changing demands there sometimes were a combination of styles within a single timber frame construction.&lt;ref name=Vince&gt;Vince, J.; ''The Timbered House''; Sorbus, 1994; {{ISBN|1-874329-75-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major types of historic framing in England are [[cruck|'cruck frame']],&lt;ref name=Vince /&gt; box frame,&lt;ref name=Vince /&gt; and aisled construction.

The cruck frame design is among the earliest, and was &lt;ref name=Vince /&gt; in use by the early 13th century, with its use continuing to the present day, although rarely after the 18th century.&lt;ref name=Vince/&gt; Since the 18th century however, many existing cruck structures have been modified, with the original cruck framework becoming hidden.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Aisled barns are of two or three aisled types, the oldest surviving aisled barn being the barley barn at [[Cressing Temple]]&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; dated to 1205–35.&lt;ref&gt;Bettley, James, and Nikolaus Pevsner.

[[Jettying]] was introduced in the 13th century and continued to be used through the 16th century.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;

Generally speaking, the size of timbers used in construction, and the quality of the workmanship reflect the wealth and status of their owners. Small cottages often used quite small cross-section timbers which would have been deemed unsuitable by others. Some of these small cottages also have a very 'home-made' - even temporary - appearance. Many such example can be found in the English shires. Equally, some relatively small buildings can be seen to incorporate substantial timbers and excellent craftsmanship, reflecting the relative wealth and status of their original owners.

===French tradition===
[[File:Coupesarte-14-manoir-1.JPG|thumb|right|Coupesarte Manor (Normandy, France)]]
Elaborately half-timbered houses of the 13th through 18th centuries still remain in [[Bourges]], [[Troyes]], [[Rouen]], [[Thiers, Puy-de-Dôme|Thiers]], [[Dinan]], [[Rennes]], and many other cities, except in [[Provence]] and [[Corsica]]. Timber framing in French is known colloquially as ''pan de bois'' and half-timbering as ''colombage''. Alsace is the region with the most timbered houses in France. But most of these were built when Alsace was part of Germany. The German architecture is spread all over Alsace and old signs in the German language can still be found in front of the houses.  

The ''Normandy tradition'' features two techniques: frameworks were built of four evenly spaced regularly hewn timbers set into the ground (''poteau en terre'') or into a continuous wooden sill (''poteau de sole'') and mortised at the top into the plate. The openings were filled with many materials including mud and straw, wattle and daub, or horsehair and gypsum.&lt;ref name="Charles Van Ravenswaay 2006" &gt;Charles Van Ravenswaay: 2006.

===German tradition (''Fachwerkhäuser'')===
{{Commons category|Timber framing in Germany}}
Germany has several styles of timber framing, but probably the greatest number of half-timbered buildings in the world are to be found in Germany and in Alsace (France). There are many small towns which escaped both war damage and modernisation and consist mainly, or even entirely, of half-timbered houses.

[[File:Idstein König-Adolf-Platz 2.jpg|thumb|[[Idstein]], Hesse, on the [[German Timber-Frame Road]].]]
[[File:Bernkastel BW 1.JPG|thumb|upright|The ''Spitzhäuschen'', a very narrow, timber-frame house in [[Bernkastel-Kues|Bernkastel]] at the river [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]], built in 1417.]]

The [[German Timber-Frame Road]] (''Deutsche Fachwerkstraße'') is a tourist route that connects towns with remarkable ''fachwerk''. It is more than {{convert|2000|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, crossing Germany through the states of [[Lower Saxony]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]], [[Hesse]], [[Thuringia]], [[Bavaria]], and [[Baden-Württemberg]].&lt;ref name="Nortrud G. Schrammel-Schäl 1987"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Edel: 1928. ''Die Fachwerkhäuser der Stadt Braunschweig: ein kunst und kulturhistorisches Bild''. Druckerei Appelhaus, 1928&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the more prominent towns (among many) include: [[Quedlinburg]], a [[UNESCO]]-listed town, which has over 1200 half-timbered houses spanning five centuries; [[Goslar]], another UNESCO-listed town; [[Hanau|Hanau-Steinheim]] (home of the [[Brothers Grimm]]); [[Bad Urach]]; [[Eppingen]] ("Romance city" with a half-timbered church dating from 1320); [[Mosbach]]; [[Vaihingen an der Enz]] and nearby UNESCO-listed [[Maulbronn Abbey]]; [[Schorndorf]] (birthplace of [[Gottlieb Daimler]]); [[Calw]]; [[Celle]]; and [[Biberach an der Riss|Biberach an der Riß]] with both the largest medieval complex, the ''Holy Spirit Hospital'' and one of Southern Germany's oldest buildings, now the [[Braith-Mali-Museum]], dated to 1318.

German ''fachwerk'' building styles are extremely varied with a huge number of carpentry techniques which are highly regionalized. German planning laws for the preservation of buildings and regional architecture preservation dictate that a half-timbered house must be authentic to regional or even city-specific designs before being accepted.&lt;ref name="Wilhelm Süvern 1971" &gt;Wilhelm Süvern: 1971. ''Torbögen und Inschriften lippischer Fachwerkhäuser'' in Volume 7 of Heimatland Lippe. Lippe Heimatbund: 1971. 48 pages&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heinrich Stiewe 2007" &gt;Heinrich Stiewe: 2007. ''Fachwerkhäuser in Deutschland: Konstruktion, Gestalt und Nutzung vom Mittelalter bis heute''. Primus Verlag: 2007. {{ISBN|978-3-89678-589-3}}. 160 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

A brief overview of styles follows, as a full inclusion of all styles is impossible.

In general the northern states have ''fachwerk'' very similar to that of the nearby [[Netherlands]] and [[England]] while the more southerly states (most notably [[Bavaria]] and [[Switzerland]]) have more decoration using timber because of greater forest reserves in those areas. During the 19th century, a form of decorative timber-framing called ''[[bundwerk]]'' became popular in [[Bavaria]], [[Austria]] and [[South Tyrol]].

The German ''fachwerkhaus'' usually has a foundation of stone, or sometimes brick, perhaps up to several feet (a couple of metres) high, which the timber framework is mortised into or, more rarely, supports an irregular wooden sill.

The three main forms may be divided geographically:
* West Central Germany and [[Franconia]]:
** In West Central German and Franconian timber-work houses (particularly in the Central Rhine and Moselle): the windows most commonly lie between the rails of the [[sill plate|sills]] and [[lintel]]s.
* Northern Germany, Central Germany and East German:
** In [[Saxony]] and around the [[Harz]] foothills, angle braces often form fully extended triangles.
** Lower Saxon houses have a [[joist]] for every post.
** Holstein fachwerk houses are famed for their massive 12-inch (30&amp;nbsp;cm) beams.
* Southern Germany including the Black and Bohemian Forests
** In [[Swabia]], [[Württemberg]], [[Alsace]], and [[Switzerland]], the use of the [[Lap joint|lap-joint]] is thought to be the earliest method of connecting the wall plates and tie beams and is particularly identified with Swabia. A later innovation (also pioneered in Swabia) was the use of [[mortise and tenon|tenons]]&amp;nbsp;— builders left timbers to season which were held in place by wooden pegs (''i.e.,'' tenons). The timbers were initially placed with the tenons left an inch or two out of intended position and later driven home after becoming fully seasoned.

The most characteristic feature is the spacing between the posts and the high placement of windows. Panels are enclosed by a [[sill plate|sill]], [[post (structural)|posts]], and a [[wall plate|plate]], and are crossed by two rails between which the windows are placed—like "two eyes peering out".&lt;ref name="Wilhelm Süvern 1971"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heinrich Stiewe 2007"/&gt;

In addition there is a myriad of regional scrollwork and fretwork designs of the non-loadbearing large timbers (braces) peculiar to particularly wealthy towns or cities.

A unique type of timber-frame house can be found in the region where the borders of Germany, the Czech Republic, and Poland meet - it is called the [[Upper Lusatian house]] (Umgebindehaus, translates as ''round-framed house''). This type has a timber frame surrounding a log structure on part of the ground floor.&lt;ref&gt;Agnieszka Gaczkowska, Traditional Upper Lusatian Umgebinde House: Modern Reinterpretation. {{cite web |url=http://gaczkowska.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/masters-work_english.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104204617/http://gaczkowska.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/masters-work_english.pdf |archivedate=2014-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===

Several half-timbered houses can be found in Northern Italy, especially in [[Piedmont]], [[Lombardy]], in the city of [[Bologna]], in [[Sardinia]] in the [[Barbagia]] region and in the Iglesiente mining region.

===Poland===
[[File:Wierzbiecice 20 (6).jpg|thumb|right|Timber-frame house in central [[Poznań]], [[Poland]]]]
The Slavic tradition of vernacular [[architecture]] is rather [[log building]]. Most half-timbered houses have been built in regions that once belonged to Germany, had a lot of German immigrants or significant German cultural influence. As these regions were at some point parts of [[Prussia]], half-timbered walls are called ''mur pruski''. The [[Slovincian]]s, an autochthone Slavic group in the Prussian province of [[Pomerania]] also built half-timbered houses. A distinctive type of house associated with mostly [[Mennonite]] immigrant groups from [[Frisia]] and the [[Netherlands]], known as the [[Olędrzy]], is called an arcade house (''dom podcieniowy'').

The [[Umgebindehaus]] rural housing tradition of south [[Saxony]] (Germany) is also found in the neighboring areas of Poland (the [[Silesia]]n region) and the north of [[Czech Republic]].

Another world-class type of wooden building Poland shares with some neighboring countries are its [[wooden churches of Southern Lesser Poland|wooden church buildings]].

===Spain===
The Spanish generally follow the Mediterranean forms of architecture with stone walls and shallow roof pitch. Timber framing is often of the [[post and lintel]] style. [[Castile and León]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] have the most representative examples of the use of timber framing in the Iberian Peninsula.

Most traditional Basque buildings with [[half-timbered|half-timbering]] elements are detached farm houses (in Basque: [[baserri]]ak). Their upper floors were built with [[Jettying|jettied]] box frames in [[close studding]]. In the oldest farmsteads and, if existing, in the third floor the walls were sometimes covered with vertical [[weatherboarding|weatherboards]]. Big holes were left in the gable of the main façade for ventilation. The wooden beams were painted over, mostly in dark red. The vacancies were filled in with [[wattle and daub]] or rubble laid in a clay mortar and then plastered over with white chalk or nogged with bricks. Although the entire supporting structure is made of wood, the timbering is only visible on the main façade, which is generally oriented to the southeast.

Although the typical Basque house is now mostly associated with half-timbering, the outer walls and the fire-walls were built in masonry (rubble stone, bricks or, ideally, [[ashlar]]s) whenever it could be afforded. Timber was a sign of poverty. Oak-wood was cheaper than masonry: that is why, when the money was running out, the upper floor walls were mostly built timbered. Extant baserriak with half-timbered upper-floor façades were built from the 15th to 19th centuries and are found in all Basque regions with [[oceanic climate]], except in [[Soule|Zuberoa]] (Soule), but are concentrated in [[Labourd|Lapurdi]] (Labourd).

Some medieval Basque [[tower house]]s (dorretxeak) feature an overhanged upper floor in half-timbering.&lt;ref&gt;[[:eu:Dorretxe]] dorretxe weblink to the Basque Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;

To a lesser extent timbered houses are also found in villages and towns as [[row house]]s, as the photo from the [[Ustaritz|Uztaritz]] village shows.

Currently, it has again become popular to build houses resembling old Basque farmsteads, with more or less respect for the principles of traditional half-timbered building.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Néobasque]] Néobasque weblink to the French Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;gallery&gt;

===Switzerland===
[[File:Hombrechtikon - Sogenanntes Eglihaus, Lutikon 1-3 2011-08-30 15-29-48 ShiftN.jpg|thumb|An exceptional fachwerk house called Eglihaus in [[Hombrechtikon]], Switzerland]]
Switzerland has many styles of timber framing which overlap with its neighboring countries.

===Belgium===
Nowadays, timber framing is primarily found in the [[provinces of Belgium|provinces]] of [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]], [[Liège (province)|Liège]], and [[Luxembourg (Belgium)|Luxemburg]]. In urban areas, the ground floor was formerly built in stone and the upper floors in timber framing. Also, as timber framing was seen as a cheaper way of building, often the visible structures of noble houses were in stone and bricks, and the invisible or lateral walls in timber framing. The open-air museums of [[Bokrijk]] and [[Saint-Hubert, Belgium|Saint-Hubert]] ([[Fourneau Saint-Michel]]) show many examples of Belgian timber framing. Many post-and-beam houses can be found in cities and villages, but, unlike France, the United Kingdom, and Germany, there are few fully timber framed cityscapes.

===Sweden===
The Swedish mostly built log houses but they do have traditions of several types of timber framing: Some of the following links are written in Swedish. Most of the half-timbered houses in Sweden were built during the Danish time and are located in what until 1658 used to be Danish territory in southern Sweden, primarily in the province [[Skåne]] and secondarily in [[Blekinge]] and [[Halland]]. In Swedish half-timber is known as "korsvirke".
* [[:sv:Stavverk|Stave construction]] is called "stavverk". Scandinavia is famous for its ancient [[stave church]]es. Stave construction is a traditional timber frame with walls of vertical planks, the posts and planks landing in a sill on a foundation. Similar construction with earthfast posts is called "stolpteknik". and [[Palisade]] construction where many vertical wall timbers or planks have their feet buried in the ground called [[post in ground]] or earthfast construction is called "palissadteknik". (see also [[Palisade church]])
* [[:sv:Skiftesverk|Swedish plank-frame]] construction is called skiftesverk. This is a traditional timber frame with walls of horizontal planks.

===Norway===
Norway has at least two significant types of timber framed structures: 1) The [[stave church]] and 2) [[grindverk]]. The term ''stave'' (= post or pole) indicates that a ''stave church'' essentially means a framed church, a distinction made in a region where [[log building]] is common. All but one surviving stave churches are in Norway, one in Sweden. Replicas of stave churches and other Norwegian building types have been reproduced elsewhere, e.g. at the [[Scandinavian Heritage Park]] in North Dakota, United States.

''Grindverk'' translates as ''trestle'' construction, consisting of a series of transversal frames of two posts and a connecting beam, supporting two parallel [[wall plate]]s bearing the [[rafter]]s. Unlike other types of timber framing in Europe, the trestle frame construction uses no mortise and tenon joints. Archaeological excavations have uncovered similar wooden joints from more than 3,000 years ago, suggesting that this type of framing is an ancient unbroken tradition. Grindverk buildings are only found on part of the western coast of Norway, and most of them are boathouses and barns. There is currently no article in English Wikipedia about grindverk framing, but see Norwegian Wikipedia:&lt;ref&gt;[[:no:Grindverk]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
[[File:Ikkelderhoessjtoolwkped07.jpg|thumb|A half timbered building without the infill in [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], Netherlands.]]
The [[Netherlands]] is often overlooked for its timbered houses, yet many exist, including windmills. It was in [[North Holland]] where the import of cheaper timber, combined with the Dutch innovation of [[windmill]]-powered [[sawmill]]s, allowed economically viable widespread use of protective wood covering over framework. In the late 17th century the Dutch introduced vertical [[cladding (construction)|cladding]] also known in Eastern England as clasp board and in western England as weatherboard, then as more wood was available more cheaply, horizontal cladding in the 17th century. Perhaps owing to economic considerations, vertical cladding returned to fashion.&lt;ref name="Timber Engineering 1999. pages. 317" &gt;Lars Boström editor ''1st International RILEM Symposium on Timber Engineering: Stockholm, Sweden, September 13–14, 1999'' Volume 8 of RILEM proceedings RILEM Publications, 1999. {{ISBN|978-2-912143-10-5}}. 838 pages. 317–327.&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch wall framing is virtually always built in bents and the three basic types of roof framing are the rafter roof, purlin roof, and ridge-post roof.&lt;ref&gt;Herman Janse, Houten kappen in Nederland 1000-1940. Delftse Universitaire Pers, Delft / Rijksdienst voor de Monumentenzorg, Zeist 1989. translations are mine&lt;/ref&gt;

===Americas===
{{main article|American historic carpentry}}
Most "haft-timbered" houses existing in Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Texas were built by German settlers.&lt;ref name="Charles Van Ravenswaay 2006"/&gt; [[Old Salem]] North Carolina has fine examples of German fachwerk buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Noble, Allen George, and M. Margaret Geib. Wood, brick, and stone: the North American settlement landscape. Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1984. 42, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Many are still present in [[Colonia Tovar]] ([[Venezuela]]), [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] and [[Rio Grande do Sul]] ([[Brazil]]), where Germans settled. Later, they chose more suitable building materials for local conditions (most likely because of the great problem of tropical termites.)

====New France====
In the historical region of North America known as [[New France]], '''colombage pierroté''', also called ''maçonnerie entre poteaux'',&lt;ref name="Creole" &gt;"colombage pierroté" def. 1. Edwards, Jay Dearborn, and Nicolas Verton. ''A Creole lexicon architecture, landscape, people''. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2004. 65. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; half-timbered construction with the infill between the posts and studs of stone rubble and lime plaster or [[bousillage]]&lt;ref name="Creole" /&gt; and simply called ''colombage'' in France. Colombage was used from the earliest settlement until the 18th century but was known as ''bousillage entre poteaus sur solle'' in [[Louisiana (New France)|Lower Louisiana]]. The style had its origins in Normandy, and was brought to Canada by very early Norman settlers. The Men's House at [[Lower Fort Garry]] is a good example. The exterior walls of such buildings were often covered over with clapboards to protect the infill from erosion. Naturally, this required frequent maintenance, and the style was abandoned as a building method in the 18th century in Québec. For the same reasons, half-timbering in New England, which was originally employed by the English settlers, fell out of favour soon after the colonies had become established.

Other variations of half-timbering are ''colombage à teurques'' (torchis), straw coated with mud and hung over horizontal staves (or otherwise held in place), colombage an eclisses, and colombage a lattes.&lt;ref name="Creole" /&gt;

'''[[Poteaux-en-terre]]''' (posts in ground) is a type of timber framing with the many vertical posts or studs buried in the ground called [[post in ground]] or "earthfast" construction. The tops of the posts are joined to a beam and the spaces between are filled in with natural materials called bousillage or [[pierrotage]].

'''[[Poteaux-sur-sol]]''' (posts on a sill) is a general term for any kind of framing on a sill. However, sometimes it specifically refers to "vertical log construction" like poteaux-en-terre placed on sills with the spaces between the timbers infilled.

'''Piece-sur-piece''' also known as [[Post-and-plank]] style or "corner post construction" (and many other names) in which wood is used both for the frame and horizontal infill; for this reason it may be incorrect to call it "half-timbering". It is sometimes a blend of framing and log building with two styles: the horizontal pieces fit into groves in the posts and can slide up and down or the horizontal pieces fit into individual mortises in the posts and are pegged and the gaps between the pieces chinked (filled in with stones or chips of wood covered with mud or moss briefly discussed in [[Log cabin]].)

This technique of a timber frame walls filled in with horizontal planks or logs proved better suited to the harsh climates of Québec and Acadia, which at the same time had abundant wood. It became very popular throughout New France, as far afield as southern Louisiana. The [[Hudson's Bay Company]] used this technique for many of its trading posts, and this style of framing becoming known as Hudson Bay style or Hudson Bay corners. Also used by the [[Red River Colony]] this style also became known as "Red River Framing". “The support of horizontal timbers by corner posts is an old form of construction in Europe. It was apparently carried across much of the continent from Silesia by the Lausitz urnfield culture in the late Bronze Age.”&lt;ref&gt;Upton, Dell, Vllach, John Michael, Common places: Readings in American Vernacular Architecture, referencing V. Gordon Childe, The Bronze Age, (NY, Macmillan, 1930, pp. 206-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar building techniques are apparently not found in France&lt;ref&gt;Noble, Allen George, and M. Margaret Geib. Wood, brick, and stone: the North American settlement landscape. Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1984. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; but exist in Germany and Switzerland known as Bohlenstanderbau when planks are used or blockstanderbau when beams are used as the infill. In Sweden known as sleppvegg or skiftesverk and in Denmark as bulhus.

A particularly interesting example in the U.S. is the [[Golden Plough Tavern]] (c. 1741), York, York County, PA, which has the ground level of corner-post construction with the second floor of fachwerk (half timbered) and was built for a German with other Germanic features.&lt;ref&gt;“Corner-Post Log Construction: Description, Analysis, and Sources”, A Report to Early American Industries Association by Nancy S. Shedd March 10, 1986. available online at {{cite web |url=http://www.huntingdonhistoryresearchnetwork.net/?page_id=236 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925103016/http://www.huntingdonhistoryresearchnetwork.net/?page_id=236 |archivedate=2013-09-25 |df= }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Settlers in New France also built horizontal log, brick, and stone buildings.

====New Netherland====
Characteristics of traditional timber framing in the parts of the U.S. formerly known as [[New Netherland]] are H-framing also known as dropped-tie framing in the U.S. and the similar anchor beam framing as found in the New World [[Dutch barn]].

====New England====
Some time periods/regions within [[New England]] contain certain framing elements such as common [[purlin]] roofs, five sided ridge beams, plank-frame construction and plank-wall construction. The [[English barn]] always contains an "English tying joint" and the later [[New England barn|New England style barn]] were built using [[bent (structural)|bents]].

===Japanese===
[[File:PSM V28 D663 Side framing of a japanese house under construction.jpg|thumb|Wall framing of a Japanese house under construction]]
[[Japanese carpentry|Japanese timber framing]] is believed to be descended from Chinese framing (see [[Ancient Chinese wooden architecture]]). Asian framing is significantly different from western framing, with its predominant use of [[post and lintel]] framing and an almost complete lack of diagonal bracing.

===Revival styles in later centuries===
[[File:Saitta House Dyker Heights.JPG|thumb|upright|The [[Saitta House]], [[Dyker Heights, Brooklyn|Dyker Heights]], [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]] built in [[1899 in architecture|1899]] has half-timber decoration.&lt;ref&gt;“[http://www.dykerheightscivicassociation.com/saittareport.pdf Saitta House&amp;nbsp;– Report Part 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216233832/http://www.dykerheightscivicassociation.com/saittareport.pdf |date=2008-12-16 }}”,''DykerHeightsCivicAssociation.com''&lt;/ref&gt;|left]]

When half-timbering regained popularity in Britain after 1860 in the various revival styles, such as the [[Queen Anne style architecture|Queen Anne style]] houses by [[Richard Norman Shaw]] and others, it was often used to evoke a "Tudor" atmosphere (''see [[Tudorbethan]]''), though in Tudor times half-timbering had begun to look rustic and was increasingly limited to village houses (''illustration, above left'').

In 1912, Allen W. Jackson published ''The Half-Timber House: Its Origin, Design, Modern Plan, and Construction,'' and rambling half-timbered beach houses appeared on dune-front properties in [[Rhode Island]] or under palm-lined drives of [[Beverly Hills]]. During the 1920s increasingly minimal gestures towards some half-timbering in commercial speculative house-building saw the fashion diminish.

In the revival styles, such as [[Tudorbethan]] (Mock Tudor), the half-timbered appearance is superimposed on the brickwork or other material as an outside decorative [[facade|façade]] rather than forming the main frame that supports the structure.

The style was used in many of the homes built in [[Lake Mohawk, New Jersey]] as well as all of the clubhouse, shops, and marina.

==Advantages==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:timberframe10.jpg|thumb|right|Beams are often used to accompany a style of decor]] --&gt;The use of timber framing in buildings offers various aesthetic and structural benefits, as the timber frame lends itself to open plan designs and allows for complete enclosure in effective insulation for energy efficiency. In modern construction, a timber-frame structure offers many benefits:
* It is rapidly erected. A moderately sized timber-frame home can be erected within 2 to 3 days.
* It is well suited to prefabrication, modular construction, and mass-production.  Timbers can be pre-fit within [[bent (structural)|bents]] or wall-sections and aligned with a [[jig (tool)|jig]] in a shop, without the need for a machine or hand-cut production line. This allows faster erection on site and more precise alignments. Valley and hip timbers are not typically pre-fitted.
* As an alternative to the traditional infill methods, the frame can be encased with [[structural insulated panel|SIPs]]. This stage of preparing the assembled frame for the installation of windows, mechanical systems, and roofing is known as ''drying in''.
* it can be customized with carvings or incorporate heirloom structures such as barns etc..
* it can use recycled or otherwise discarded timbers
* it offers some structural benefits as the timber frame, if properly engineered, lends itself to better ''seismic survivability'' &lt;ref name=Timber &gt;{{cite book
 |title= Timber Design &amp; Construction Sourcebook
 |author=Gotz, Karl-Heinz|year=1989
 |publisher=McGraw-Hall
 |isbn=0-07-023851-0
|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, there are many half-timbered houses which still stand despite the foundation having partially caved in over the centuries.
* The generally larger spaces between the frames enable greater flexibility in the placement, at construction or afterwards, of windows and doors with less resulting weakening of the structural integrity and the need for heavy lintels.

In North America, heavy timber construction is classified Building Code Type IV: a special class reserved for timber framing which recognizes the inherent fire resistance of large timber and its ability to retain structural capacity in fire situations. In many cases this classification can eliminate the need and expense of fire sprinklers in public buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tsib.org/pdf/technical/10-101_Building_Codes.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728131638/http://www.tsib.org/pdf/technical/10-101_Building_Codes.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages==

===Traditional or historic structures===
In terms of the traditional half-timber or ''fachwerkhaus'' there are maybe more disadvantages than advantages today. Such houses are notoriously expensive to maintain let alone renovate and restore, most commonly owing to local regulations that do not allow divergence from the original, modification or incorporation of modern materials.
Additionally, in such nations as Germany, where energy efficiency is highly regulated, the renovated building may be required to meet modern energy efficiencies, if it is to be used as a residential or commercial structure (museums and significant historic buildings have no semi-permanent habitade exempt). Many framework houses of significance are treated merely to preserve, rather than render inhabitable&amp;nbsp;— most especially as the required heavy insecticidal fumigation is highly poisonous.

In some cases, it is more economical to build anew using authentic techniques and correct period materials than restore. One major problem with older structures is the phenomenon known as ''mechano-sorptive creep'' or slanting: where wood beams absorb moisture whilst under [[physical compression|compression]] or [[tension (physics)|tension]] strains and deform, shift position or both. This is a major structural issue as the house may deviate several degrees from perpendicular to its foundations (in the x-axis, y-axis, and even z-axis) and thus be unsafe and unstable or so out of square it is extremely costly to remedy.&lt;ref name="Charlotte Bengtsson 1999. pages. 317" &gt;Charlotte Bengtsson: "Mechano-sorptive creep of wood in tension and compression": in Lars Boström editor ''1st International RILEM Symposium on Timber Engineering'': Stockholm, Sweden, September 13–14, 1999 Volume 8 of RILEM proceedings, RILEM Publications, 1999. {{ISBN|978-2-912143-10-5}}. 838 pages. 317–327.&lt;/ref&gt;

A summary of problems with ''Fachwerkhäuser'' or half-timbered houses includes the following, though many can be avoided by thoughtful design and application of suitable paints and surface treatments and routine maintenance. Often, though when dealing with a structure of a century or more old, it is too late.&lt;ref name="Timber Engineering 1999. pages. 317" /&gt;
* "slanting"- ''thermo-mechanical'' (weather-seasonally induced) and mechano-sorptive (moisture induced) creep of wood in tension and compression.&lt;ref name="Charlotte Bengtsson 1999. pages. 317" /&gt;
* poor prevention of capillary movement of water within any exposed timber, leading to afore-described creep, or rot
* eaves that are too narrow or non-existent (thus allowing total exposure to rain and snow)
* too much exterior detailing that does not allow adequate rainwater run-off
* timber ends, joints, and corners poorly protected through coatings, shape or position
* non-beveled vertical beams (posts and clapboards) allow water absorption and retention through capillary action.
* surface point or coatings allowed to deteriorate
* traditional gypsum, or wattle and daub containing organic materials (animal hair, straw, manure) which then decompose.
* in both [[Post in ground|''poteaux-en-terre'']] and ''[[poteaux-sur-sol]]'' insect, fungus or bacterial decomposition.
* [[Decomposition|rot]] including [[dry rot]].
* infestation of [[xylophagous]] pest organisms such as (very common in Europe) the ''[[Ptinidae]]'' family particularly the [[common furniture beetle]], [[termite]]s, [[cockroach]]es, [[powderpost beetle]]s, [[mouse|mice]], and [[rat]]s (quite famously so in many children's stories).
* Noise from footsteps in adjacent rooms above, below, and on the same floor in such buildings can be quite audible. This is often resolved with built-up floor systems involving clever sound-isolation and absorption techniques, and at the same time providing passage space for plumbing, wiring, and even heating and cooling equipment.
* Other [[fungus|fungi]] that are non-destructive to the wood, but are harmful to humans such as [[Aspergillus niger|black mold]]. These fungi may also thrive on many "modern" building materials.
* Wood [[combustion|burns]] more readily than some other materials, making timber-frame buildings somewhat more susceptible to fire damage, although this idea is not universally accepted: Since the cross-sectional dimensions of many structural members exceed 15&amp;nbsp;cm&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;15&amp;nbsp;cm (6" × 6"), timber-frame structures benefit from the unique properties of large timbers, which char on the outside forming an insulated layer that protects the rest of the beam from burning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8040">'''Universal Networking Language''' ('''UNL''') is a declarative [[formal language]] specifically designed to represent [[semantic]] data extracted from [[natural language]] texts. It can be used as a [[pivot language]] in [[interlingual machine translation]] systems or as a [[knowledge representation]] language in [[information retrieval]] applications. 

== Scope and goals ==
UNL is designed to establish a simple foundation for representing the most central aspects of information and meaning in a machine- and human-language-independent form. As a language-independent formalism, UNL aims to code, store, disseminate and retrieve information independently of the original language in which it was expressed. In this sense, UNL seeks to provide tools for overcoming the language barrier in a systematic way.

At first glance, UNL seems to be a kind of interlingua, into which source texts are converted before being translated into target languages. It can, in fact, be used for this purpose, and very efficiently, too. However, its real strength is knowledge representation and its primary objective is to provide an infrastructure for handling knowledge that already exists or can exist in any given language.

Nevertheless, it is important to note that at present it would be foolish to claim to represent the “full” meaning of any word, sentence, or text for any language. Subtleties of intention and interpretation make the “full meaning,” however we might conceive it, too variable and subjective for any systematic treatment.  Thus UNL avoids the pitfalls of trying to represent the “full meaning” of sentences or texts, targeting instead the “core” or “consensual” meaning most often attributed to them. In this sense, much of the subtlety of poetry, metaphor, figurative language, innuendo, and other complex, indirect communicative behaviors is beyond the current scope and goals of UNL. Instead, UNL targets direct communicative behavior and literal meaning as a tangible, concrete basis for most human communication in practical, day-to-day settings.

== Structure ==
In the UNL approach, information conveyed by natural language is represented sentence by sentence as a hypergraph composed of a set of directed binary labeled links (referred to as '''relations''') between nodes or hypernodes (the '''Universal Words''', or simply '''UWs'''), which stand for concepts. UWs can also be annotated with '''attributes''' representing context information. 

As an example, the English sentence ‘The sky was blue?!’ can be represented in UNL as follows:

[[File:UNLGraph.svg]]

In the example above, "sky(icl&gt;natural world)" and "blue(icl&gt;color)", which represent individual concepts, are UWs; "aoj" (= attribute of an object) is a directed binary semantic relation linking the two UWs; and "@def", "@interrogative", "@past", "@exclamation" and "@entry" are attributes modifying UWs.

UWs are intended to represent universal concepts, but are expressed in English words or in any other natural language in order to be humanly readable. They consist of a "headword" (the UW root) and a "constraint list" (the UW suffix between parentheses), where the constraints are used to disambiguate the general concept conveyed by the headword. The set of UWs is organized in the UNL Ontology, in which high-level concepts are related to lower-level ones through the relations "icl" (= is a kind of), "iof" (= is an instance of) and "equ" (= is equal to). 

Relations are intended to represent semantic links between words in every existing language. They can be ontological (such as "icl" and "iof," referred to above), logical (such as "and" and "or"), and thematic (such as "agt" = agent, "ins" = instrument, "tim" = time, "plc" = place, etc.). There are currently 46 relations in the UNL Specs. They jointly define the UNL syntax.

Attributes represent information that cannot be conveyed by UWs and relations. Normally, they represent information concerning time ("@past", "@future", etc.), reference ("@def", "@indef", etc.), modality ("@can", "@must",  etc.), focus ("@topic", "@focus", etc.), and so on.

Within the UNL Program, the process of representing natural language sentences in UNL graphs is called '''UNLization''', and the process of generating natural language sentences out of UNL graphs is called '''NLization'''. UNLization, which involves natural language analysis and understanding, is intended to be carried out semi-automatically (i.e., by humans with computer aids); and NLization is intended to be carried out fully automatically.

== History ==
The UNL Programme started in 1996, as an initiative of the Institute of Advanced Studies of the [[United Nations University]] in Tokyo, Japan. In January 2001, the United Nations University set up an autonomous organization, the '''UNDL Foundation''', to be responsible for the development and management of the UNL Programme.  The Foundation, a non-profit international organisation, has an independent identity from the United Nations University, although it has special links with the UN. It inherited from the UNU/IAS the mandate of implementing the UNL Programme so that it can fulfil its mission.

The Programme has already crossed important milestones. The overall architecture of the UNL System has been developed with a set of basic software and tools necessary for its functioning. These are being tested and improved. A vast amount of linguistic resources from the various native languages already under development, as well as from the UNL expression, has been accumulated in the last few years. Moreover, the technical infrastructure for expanding these resources is already in place, thus facilitating the participation of many more languages in the UNL system from now on. A growing number of scientific papers and academic dissertations on the UNL are being published every year.  

The most visible accomplishment so far is the recognition by the Patent Co-operation Treaty (PCT) of the innovative character and industrial applicability of the UNL, which was obtained in May 2002 through the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO). Acquiring the patents (US patents 6,704,700 and 7,107,206) for the UNL is a completely novel achievement within the United Nations.

:''See [[Tagsatzung]] for the meaning in historical Switzerland.''

''''Vorort'''' (plural: ''Vororte'') is a [[German language|German]] term that could be considered roughly equivalent to a [[suburb]]. Vororte usually have their own business centre. They are the remainders of formerly separate neighbour towns, or have been founded as [[satellite town]]s. The term is contrasted with ''[[Vorstadt]]'', which describes a more densely populated area grown at the outline of a city centre.

== Switzerland ==
In [[history of Switzerland|Swiss history]], ''Vorort'' referred to the temporary "presidency" of a [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] or the cantonal capital. During the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]], the canton or city that convened the [[Tagsatzung]] and chaired it was called the ''Vorort''. In the 15th century, the city of [[Zürich]] became the ''de facto'' Vorort of the Confederacy. Since the [[Reformation in Switzerland]], [[Lucerne]] became the Vorort of the Catholic cantons. With the 1798 establishment of the [[Helvetic Republic]] the Vororte were abolished and instead [[Aarau]] was made capital city, then Lucerne, then [[Bern]]. After the [[Act of Mediation]], the "Vorort of Switzerland" would rotate each year between the capital of Aarau and the cities of Zürich, Bern, Lucerne, [[Fribourg]], [[Solothurn]] and [[Basel]]. In 1815, the choice of Vororte was restricted to Zürich, Bern and Lucerne, who in turn served as biennial [[seat of government]] until 1847. In 1848, Bern became the permanent seat of the Swiss Federal Government and thus the ''de facto'' capital of Switzerland.

== Vienna ==
In [[Vienna]], the historical terms ''Vorstädte'' and ''Vororte'' have very specific meanings. The ''Vorstädte'' were located outside the city walls, but within the ''[[Linienwall]]'', a second ring of fortifications outside the city. The city walls were located in the place of the modern [[Ringstraße]], while the ''Linienwall'' has been removed to give way to the ''[[Gürtel, Vienna|Gürtel]]'' (both being rings of streets around the central city). All of the historical municipalities were merged into [[Vienna]] during the late 19th century. The former ''Vororte'', which have in large parts become as urban as the ''Vorstädte'', now make up Vienna's so-called outer districts ([[Favoriten|10th]] to [[Döbling|19th]] and [[Floridsdorf|21st]] to [[Liesing|23rd]] district).
