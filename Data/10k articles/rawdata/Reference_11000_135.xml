'''ATtiny''' (also known as TinyAVR) are a subfamily of the popular 8-bit [[AVR microcontrollers|AVR]] microcontrollers, which typically has fewer features, fewer I/O pins, and less memory than other AVR series chips.  The first members of this family were release in 1999 by [[Atmel]] (later acquired by [[Microchip Technology]] in 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Atmel Product Guide September 1999 |url=http://ebook.pldworld.com/_semiconductors/Atmel/Databook%20CDROM/Atmel/acrobat/doc0031.pdf |website=[[Atmel]] |accessdate=October 6, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181006055656/http://ebook.pldworld.com/_semiconductors/Atmel/Databook%20CDROM/Atmel/acrobat/doc0031.pdf |archivedate=October 6, 2018 |date=September 1999 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
ATtiny microcontrollers specifically excludes various common features, such as: USB peripheral, DMA controller, crypto engine, or an external memory bus.

The following table summarizes common features of the ATtiny microcontrollers, for easy comparison.  This table is not meant to be an unabridged feature list.

:* Package column - the number after the dash is the number of pins on the package. '''[[Dual in-line package|DIP]]''' packages in this table are {{convert|0.3|in|mm|2}} row-to-row. '''SO'''www means [[Small Outline Integrated Circuit|SOIC]] package with a case width of 'www' in [[thousandth of an inch]]. Though some package types are known by more than one name, a common name was chosen to make it easier to compare packages.
:* UART/IÂ²C/SPI columns - &lt;code&gt;green cell&lt;/code&gt; means a dedicated peripheral, &lt;code&gt;yellow cell&lt;/code&gt; means a multi-feature peripheral that is chosen by setting configuration bits.  Most USART peripherals support a minimum choice between UART or SPI, where as some might support additional choices, such as [[Lin bus|LIN]], [[IrDA]], [[RS-485]].
:* Timers column - recent families add a 12-bit timer, plus a 16-bit Real Time Counter (RTC) that is driven by a 32.768KHz clock (feature designated with 'R' in the table).
:* ADC chans column - the total number of analog channels that are multiplex into the ADC input. Most parts have one ADC, a few have two ADC.
:* Pgm/Dbg column - flash programming and debugging protocols: '''HVPP''' means High Voltage Parallel Programming 12V protocol, '''HVSP''' means High Voltage Serial Programming 12V protocol, '''ISP''' means [[In-system programming|In-System Programmable]] protocol, uses SPI to program the internal flash. '''TPI''' is Tiny Programming Interface. '''dW''' means [[debugWIRE]] protocol. '''UPDI''' means Unified Program and Debug Interface protocol (newest).&lt;ref&gt;[http://studio.download.atmel.com/7.0.1931/as-installer-7.0.1931-readme.pdf Atmel Studio Release Notes; Microchip.com]&lt;/ref&gt; 

;Abbreviations
* TWI: Many of Atmels microcontrollers contain built-in support for interfacing to a two-wire bus, called Two-Wire Interface. This is essentially the same thing as the [[IÂ²C]] interface by Philips, but that term is avoided in Atmel's documentation due to trademark issues.
* USI: Universal Serial Interface (not to be confused with [[USB]]). The USI is a multi-purpose hardware communication module. With appropriate software support, it can be used to implement an [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atmel.com/images/doc2582.pdf|title=AVR319: Using the USI module for SPI communication|publisher=[[Atmel]]|date=2004|format=PDF|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IÂ²C]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atmel.com/images/atmel-2561-using-the-usi-module-as-a-i2c-master_ap-note_avr310.pdf|title=Atmel AVR310: Using the USI Module as a I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;C Master|publisher=[[Atmel]]|date=2013|format=PDF|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atmel.com/Images/doc2560.pdf|title=AVR312: Using the USI module as a I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;C slave|publisher=[[Atmel]]|date=2005|format=PDF|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[UART]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atmel.com/Images/doc4300.pdf|title=AVR307: Half Duplex UART Using the USI Module|publisher=[[Atmel]]|date=2003|format=PDF|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; interface.  It should be noted that USART peripherals have more features than USI peripherals.

An '''after action report''' (or '''AAR''') is any form of [[retrospective]] analysis on a given sequence of goal-oriented actions previously undertaken, generally by the author themselves.

The two principal forms of AARs are the [[literary]] AAR, intended for recreational use, and the analytical AAR, exercised as part of a process of [[performance evaluation]] and improvement. In most cases, AARs are a combination of both. Most analytical AARs are conducted over a contemporary problem or situation that has occurred in the past, is happening right now, or what could happen in the future.

== History ==
The first AARs were developed by [[army generals]]. One of the first and best examples of an AAR is [[Julius Caesar]]âs â[[Commentaries on the Gallic War]]â.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maurer|first1=Rick|title=Feedback toolkit : 16 tools for better communication in the workplace|date=2011|publisher=Productivity Press|location=New York|isbn=1439840938|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/?id=x_vgdUxhj5oC&amp;lpg=PT57&amp;dq=%22after%20action%20report%22%20%22Commentaries%20on%20the%20Gallic%20War%22&amp;pg=PT57#v=onepage&amp;q=%22after%20action%20report%22%20%22Commentaries%20on%20the%20Gallic%20War%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary examples of AARs include project evaluations in [[business]], as well as summaries of large gaming sessions in [[videogame]] culture.

== Literary AARS ==
Literary AARs can be formal or informal documents that seek syntax and linguistic improvement. Many [[research papers]] published under an academic journal can be considered a literary AAR. There might not be much of a difference between literary AARs and analytical AARs in terms of research papers, but the key difference is analytical seeks to improve performance while literary seeks to improve style.

== Analytical AARs ==
Analytical AARs are formal [[documents]] intended to serve as aids to performance evaluation and improvement, by registering situationâresponse interactions, analyzing critical procedures, determining their effectiveness and efficiency, and proposing adjustments and recommendations. 

=== Objectives ===
Analytical AARs have three central objectives:

* Identifying problematic issues and needs for improvement
* Proposing measures to counteract problematic elements
* Obtaining âlessons learnedâ

=== Structure ===
#Overview
#Goals and objectives
#Analysis of outcomes
#Analysis of the performance shown on critical tasks
#Summary
#Recommendations

=== Examples ===
* The U.S. Army has adopted the After Action Review (AAR) as the primary method for delivering feedback after unit training exercises. Likewise, the U.S. Army Research Institute (ARI) has supported the development and implementation of AAR procedures for over 20 years. The After Action Review Process is critical to forming an After Action Report. Notes from the review often find themselves in the report. &lt;ref&gt;Morrison, J. E., &amp; Meliza, L. L. (1999). Foundations of the after action review process, 81.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another example of an After Action Report is the global status reported on [[road safety]]. Studies are conducted in order to determine how severe road safety concerns are in a particular area. After this, a report is created over the conditional event that is road safety, and a reflection is written with insight into how road safety can be improved.&lt;ref&gt;Disability, W. H. O. D. of V. and I. P. and, Prevention, W. H. O. V. and I., &amp; Organization, W. H. (2009). Global status report on road safety: Time for action. World Health Organization, 1-227.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Exercise reports are a form of analytical AARs and could be peer-reviewed by an expert who might make suggestions to one's workout routine. Exercise reports find themselves following the same structure as a general AAR. A draft report can be written before workouts, and a follow-up report could be written afterward detailing steps the user could act upon in order to improve their work ethic. The exerciser looking at their own report would know what they need to improve upon in the future, and could practice that skill in order to perfect it.&lt;ref&gt;Blue, C. L. (1995). The predictive capacity of the theory of reasoned action and the theory of planned behavior in exercise research: An integrated literature review. Research in Nursing &amp; Health, 18(2), 105â121. https://doi.org/10.1002/nur.4770180205&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3522">'''Almajiri''' is a system of Islamic education practiced in northern [[Nigeria]]. Almajiri is gotten from an Arabic word "Al-Muhajirun" which can be translated to mean a person who leaves his home in search of  Islamic knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmm.com/2010/WORLD/africa/01/07/nigeria.children.radicalization/index.html|title=ZEISS Industrial Metrology Homepage|website=www.cmm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Precolonial era===
This system of education started in Nigeria in a town named [[Kanem-Bornu Empire|Kanem-Borno]],  which had a majority of its rulers widely involved in Quranic literacy. More than 700 years  later, the [[Sokoto]] caliphate was founded by a revolution based on the teachings of the Qur'an. Sokoto caliphate and Borno caliphate started running the Almajiri system together. During this precolonial era, students used to stay with their parents for proper moral upbringing. All the schools available then were in a close proximity with the immediate environment of the students. Inspectors were introduced to go round the schools and after inspection they report to the [[Emir]] of the province all the matters regarding the affairs of the school. The schools were funded by the community, parents, zakkah, sadaqqah and sometimes through the farm output of the students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@OS_Okonkwo/the-almajiri-system-and-violent-extremism-in-northern-nigeria-finding-the-nexus-by-oge-samuel-aa25350af808|title=THE ALMAJIRI SYSTEM AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM IN NORTHERN NIGERIA: Finding the Nexus by Oge Samuelâ¦|first=Oge Samuel|last=Okonkwo|date=18 July 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial era===
The year 1904 brought a new twist to the almajiri system of education, as the British invaded the northern part of Nigeria. During the invasion most Emirs were killed and others were disposed. The remaining emirs lost controls of their territories, this resulted also in the lost of fundamental control of the almajiri. Boko was introduced, boko meaning western education. The British abolished the state funding of almajiri schools. With no support from the community, Emirs and government, the system collapsed. The teachers and students had no financial support, so, they turned into alms begging and menial jobs for survival.&lt;ref name="gamji.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamji.com/article5000/NEWS5956.htm|title=The Almajiri System of Education in  Nigeria Today By   Professor Idris A|website=www.gamji.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Present day===
A report by the National Council for the Welfare of the Destitute (NCWD) approximated the number of current almajiri to 7 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/identities//ccn-no2002-1033161 ]{{dead link|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system now lacks things like good teachers and basic amenities like proper clothing and shelter. Most of the almajiri do not graduate and are left with the option to do menial jobs.

'''Muhammad Hussain Inoki'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/766874|title=Japanese wrestler Antonio Inoki to return to Pakistan|last=Abbas|first=Mohsin|date=2012-11-26|work=DAWN.COM|access-date=2018-10-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born {{nihongo|'''Kanji Inoki'''|çªæ¨å¯è³|Inoki Kanji}} on February 20, 1943) is a Japanese [[professional wrestling]] and [[mixed martial arts]] promoter, politician, and retired professional wrestler and [[Martial arts|martial artist]], best known by his [[ring name]] {{nihongo|'''Antonio Inoki'''|ã¢ã³ãããªçªæ¨|Antonio Inoki}}. Inoki's ring name is a [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to fellow professional wrestler [[Antonino Rocca]]. 

Inoki began his professional wrestling career in the [[Japanese Wrestling Association]] (JWA) under the tutelage of [[RikidÅzan]]. Inoki quickly became one of the most popular stars in the history of Japanese professional wrestling.  Inoki parlayed his wrestling career into becoming one of Japan's most recognizable athletes, a reputation bolstered by his [[Muhammad Ali vs. Antonio Inoki|1976 fight]] against world champion boxer [[Muhammad Ali]].  The fight against Ali served as a predecessor to modern day mixed martial arts. With [[Ric Flair]], Inoki headlined [[Collision in Korea|two shows]] in [[North Korea]] in 1995 that drew 150,000 and 190,000 spectators, the highest attendances in professional wrestling history. Inoki was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] in [[WWE Hall of Fame (2010)|2010]]. 

Inoki began his promoting career in 1972, when he founded [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW). He remained the owner of NJPW until 2005 when he sold  his controlling share in the promotion to the [[Yuke's]] video game company. In 2007, he founded the [[Inoki Genome Federation]] (IGF). In 2017, Inoki founded ISM and the following year left IGF.

In 1989, while still an active wrestler, Inoki entered politics as he was elected to the Japanese [[House of Councillors]]. During his first term with the House of Councillors, Inoki successfully negotiated with [[Saddam Hussein]] for the release of Japanese hostages before the outbreak of the [[Gulf War]]. His first tenure in the House of Councillors ended in 1995, but he was reelected in 2013.

==Early life==
Inoki was born in an affluent family in [[Yokohama]] in 1943. He was the sixth son and the second youngest of the seven boys and four girls. His father, Sajiro Inoki, a businessman and politician, died when Kanji was five years old. Inoki entered the Higashidai Grade School. Inoki was taught [[karate]] by an older brother while in 6th grade. By the time he was in 7th grade at Terao Junior High School, he was 180 centimeters tall and joined the [[basketball]] team. He later quit and joined a [[track and field]] club as a [[shot put]]ter. He eventually won the championship at the Yokohama Junior High School track and field competition.

The family fell on hard times in the post-war years, and in 1957, the 14-year-old Inoki emigrated to [[Brazil]] with his grandfather, mother and brothers. His grandfather died during the journey to Brazil. Inoki won regional championships in Brazil in the shot put, [[Discus throw|discus]] throw, and [[javelin throw]], and finally the All Brazilian championships in the [[shot put]] and [[Discus throw|discus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twc-wrestle.com/inokienglish.html Antonio Inoki Home Page]. Twc-wrestle.com. Retrieved on May 10, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1960â1971)===
Inoki met [[RikidÅzan]] at the age of 17. He went back to Japan for the [[Japan Pro Wrestling Alliance|Japanese Wrestling Association]] (JWA) as RikidÅzan's [[wiktionary:Disciple|disciple]]. One of his dojo classmates was [[Shohei Baba|Giant Baba]]. After Rikidozan's death, Inoki worked in Baba's shadow until he joined the original [[Tokyo Pro Wrestling]] in 1966.

After a long excursion of wrestling in the [[United States]], Inoki found a new home in [[Tokyo Pro Wrestling]]. While there, Inoki became their biggest star. Unfortunately, the company folded in 1967, due to turmoil behind the scenes.

Returning to JWA in late 1967, Inoki was made Baba's partner and the two dominated the tag team ranks as the "B-I Cannon", winning the NWA International tag team belts four times. Wrestling legend [[Bruno Sammartino]] tells a story about Inoki trying to "[[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]]" him during a tag match in Osaka to build his reputation against the then-world champ. Bruno powered out of the hold, pounded Inoki mercilessly and threw him out of the ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grantland.com/the-triangle/wrestlings-greatest-shoots-volume-3-antonio-inoki-vs-the-great-antonio/ |title=Wrestling's Greatest Shoots, Volume 3: Antonio Inoki vs. the Great Antonio |author=Shoemaker, David |date=July 1, 2013 |website=[[Grantland]] |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inoki allegedly refused to re-enter the ring with Sammartino and tagged in Baba to finish the match.

===New Japan Pro-Wrestling (1972â2005)===
Fired from JWA in late 1971 for planning a [[takeover]] of the promotion, Inoki founded [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW) in 1972. His first match as a New Japan wrestler was against [[Karl Gotch]].

In June 1979, he fought with [[Pakistan]]i wrestler [[Zubair Jhara Pahalwan]] and lost the fight in the fifth round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Revival of Bholu Brothers' legacy|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1095495|publisher=Dawn News|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, twenty two years after Zubair Jhara's death, he announced to take Jhara's nephew ''Haroon Abid'' under his guardianship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1095495|title=Revival of Bholu Brothers&amp;#039; legacy|last=Umar|first=Suhail Yusuf {{!}} Muhammad|date=2014-03-25|work=DAWN.COM|access-date=2018-10-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 30, 1979, Inoki defeated [[WWE Championship|WWF Heavyweight Champion]] [[Bob Backlund]] in Tokushima, Japan to win the title. Backlund then won a rematch on December 6. However, WWF president [[Hisashi Shinma]] declared the re-match a no contest due to interference from [[Tiger Jeet Singh]], and Inoki remained Champion. Inoki refused the title on the same day, and it was declared vacant. Backlund later defeated [[Bobby Duncum, Sr.|Bobby Duncum]] in a Texas Death match to regain the title on December 12. As Inoki refused the title, his reign is not included nor is it recognized by WWE in its official history, and Backlund is recognized as having one reign from 1978 to 1983.

In 1995 the Japanese and the North Korean governments came together to hold a [[Collision in Korea|two-day wrestling festival for peace]] in [[Pyongyang|Pyongyang, North Korea]]. The event drew 150,000 and 190,000 fans respectively to [[Rungnado May Day Stadium]]. The main event saw the only match between Inoki and [[Ric Flair]], with Inoki coming out on top. Days before this event, Inoki and the Korean press went to the grave and birthplace of RikidÅzan and paid tribute to him.

Inoki's retirement from professional wrestling matches came with the staging of the "Final Countdown" series between 1994 and 1998. This was a special series in which Inoki re-lived some of his mixed martial arts matches under professional wrestling rules, as well as rematches of some of his most well known wrestling matches. As part of the Final Countdown tour, Inoki made a rare [[World Championship Wrestling]] appearance; defeating WCW World Television Champion [[William Regal|Steven Regal]] in a non-title match at ''[[Clash of the Champions#Clash of the Champions XXVIII|Clash of the Champions XXVIII]]''. Inoki faced [[Don Frye]] in the final match of his professional wrestling career.

In 2005, [[Yuke's]], a Japanese video company, purchased Inoki's controlling 51.5% stock in New Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.games.ign.com/objects/026/026882.html |title=Yuke's Media Creations |accessdate=2010-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027024845/http://uk.games.ign.com/objects/026/026882.html |archivedate=October 27, 2009 |df=mdy }}. uk.games.ign.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/7196/Yukes_Buys_Controlling_Share_of_New_Japan_Pro_Wrestling.php Yuke's Buys Controlling Share of New Japan Pro Wrestling].

===Post NJPW years (2005âpresent)===
Two years later in 2007, Inoki founded a new promotion called [[Inoki Genome Federation]].
On February 1, 2010, [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE) announced on its Japanese website that Inoki would be inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] as part of the Class of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/wrestling/2846141/Antonio-Inoki-to-be-inducted-into-WWE-Hall-Of-Fame.html#ixzz0f9hAMZgl|location=London|work=The Sun|first=Simon|last=Rothstein|title=Inoki gets Hall of Fame nod|date=February 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inoki was presented with a Hall of Fame certificate by WWE's Ed Wells and stated that he would be attending the [[WrestleMania XXVI]] weekend festivities, during which he was inducted by Stan Hansen.

In 2017, Inoki created a new company, ISM. ISM held its first event on June 24. On March 23, 2018, Inoki left IGF.

In 1990, Inoki traveled to [[Iraq]] in "an unofficial one-man diplomatic mission" and successfully negotiated with [[Saddam Hussein]] for the release of Japanese hostages before the outbreak of the [[Gulf War]].&lt;ref name=HuWash/&gt; It was then that he personally organized a wrestling event in Iraq ([[:ja:ã¹ãã¼ãã¨å¹³åã®ç¥­å¸|ã¹ãã¼ãã¨å¹³åã®ç¥­å¸]]) for the purpose of freeing the 41 captive Japanese nationals. He subsequently retained his seat in the [[Japanese House of Councillors election, 1992]].

[[File:Inoki closing speech (14948871659).jpg|thumb|Inoki delivering a speech in North Korea]] 
Inoki's regular visits to the country have strained his relations with the [[Japanese Diet]] where he is a representative.

Inoki joined the splinter of the Japanese Restoration Party, Party for Japanese Kokoro, in 2014. In January 2015, he helped to establish a new party named the [[Assembly to Energize Japan]], which he left in 2016, to sit in the 'Independents Club'.

In September 2017, Inoki re-established his position that Japan should make more of an effort to have co-operative dialogue with North Korea, in the wake of North Korea launching ballistic missiles over Hokkaido. This was succeeded by another of Inoki's controversial trips to the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/09/02/national/politics-diplomacy/lawmaker-antonio-inoki-visit-north-korea-next-week-source/#.WnfUzdSLTDc|title=Lawmaker Antonio Inoki to visit North Korea again this week|date=September 2, 2017|accessdate=February 3, 2018|work=[[The Japan Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Inoki was married to actress [[Mitsuko Baisho]] from 1971 to 1987, and together they had a daughter, Hiroko.&lt;ref&gt;.[http://www.zakzak.co.jp/gei/2004_10/g2004103009.html ã¢ã³ãããªçªæ¨ã¯âæ¦åâåè³ç¾æ´¥å­ï¼ï¼ï¼].

===Religion===
Inoki converted to [[Shia Islam]] in 1990 during a pilgrimage to [[Karbala]], the Shiite holy city in [[Iraq]]. He was in Iraq negotiating for the release of several Japanese hostages.&lt;ref name=HuPress&gt;{{cite web|last1=Makino|first1=Catherine|title=Legendary Japanese wrestler converts to Islam|url=http://www.presstv.com/detail/2013/01/30/286335/legendary-japanese-wrestler-converts-to-islam/|publisher=[[Press TV]]|accessdate=October 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was only revealed in 2012, along with the declaration that he had changed his name to Muhammad Hussain Inoki.&lt;ref name=HuWash&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leiby|first1=Richard|title=Wrestling, anyone?

===Mixed martial arts involvement===
{{see also|Muhammad Ali vs. Antonio Inoki}}
Inoki was amongst the group of professional wrestlers who were tutored in the art of [[Catch wrestling|hooking and shooting]] by the professional wrestler [[Karl Gotch]]. Inoki named his method of fighting "strong style." This method of wrestling (which was taught to Inoki by Gotch) borrowed heavily from professional wrestling's original [[catch wrestling]] roots, and is one of the most important influences of modern [[shoot wrestling]].

Inoki faced many opponents from all dominant disciplines of combat from various parts of the world, such as [[Boxing|boxers]], [[judo]]ka, [[karate]]ka, [[Chinese martial arts|kung fu]] practitioners, [[sumo]] wrestlers and professional  wrestlers. These bouts included a match with then-prominent karate competitor Everett Eddy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://karate-in-english-lewis-wallace.blogspot.com/2009/07/everett-monster-man-eddy.html USA karate story : Chuck Norris â Joe Lewis â Bill Wallace: Everett "Monster Man" Eddy]. Karate-in-english-lewis-wallace.blogspot.com. July 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Eddy had previously competed in a mixed skills bout against boxer Horst Geisler, losing by knockout.&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz, Sergio (November 1975) [https://books.google.com/books?id=l9cDAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;lr=&amp;rview=1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "The Rise and Fall of Contact Karateka"], Black Belt Magazine, Vol. 13, No. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The bout with Eddy ended with the karateka "knocked out" by a professional wrestling [[powerbomb]] followed by a [[Hulk Hogan]]-esque [[leg drop]]. Another such match pitted Inoki against 6'7" Kyokushin karate stylist Willie "The Bear Killer" Williams.  (So-called because he had allegedly fought a bear for a 1976 Japanese film entitled "The Strongest Karate 2").&lt;ref&gt;See the documentary film [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0201194/ "Kings of the Square Ring"] for excerpts&lt;/ref&gt; This bout ended in a doctor stoppage after both competitors repeatedly fell out of the ring.&lt;ref&gt;Full bout available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0B1mugcGO4&lt;/ref&gt; Although many of the matches were rigged and scripted, they are seen as a precursor to modern mixed martial arts. When asked about Inoki's fighting skills, business colleague [[Carlson Gracie]] stated Inoki was "one of the best fighters he'd seen."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.njpw.com/interviews/ismail.shtml]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060329044039/http://www.njpw.com/interviews/ismail.shtml |date=March 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His most famous bout was against heavyweight boxing champion [[Muhammad Ali]] on [[Muhammad Ali vs. Antonio Inoki|June 26, 1976, in Tokyo]].&lt;ref name="inokivsali"&gt;Cohen, Eric. [http://prowrestling.about.com/od/thebiggestrivalries/p/inokivsali.htm Antonio Inoki vs Muhammad Ali], ''[[About.com]]'', Retrieved on December 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Inoki initially promised Ali a rigged match to get him to fight in Japan, but when the deal materialized, Ali's camp feared that Inoki would turn the fight into a [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]], which many believe was Inoki's intention. Ali visited a professional wrestling match involving Inoki and witnessed Inoki's [[grappling]] ability. The rules of the match were announced several months in advance. Two days before the match, however, several new rules were added which severely limited the moves that each man could perform. A rule change that had a major effect on the outcome of this match was that Inoki could only throw a kick if one of his knees was on the ground.&lt;ref name="inokivsali" /&gt; In the match, Ali landed a total of six punches to Inoki, and Inoki kept to his back in a defensive position almost the full duration of the match of 15 rounds, hitting Ali with a low kick repeatedly.&lt;ref name=inokiAli&gt;{{cite web|title=Inoki vs. Ali Footage|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrXzH4WOUdc|accessdate=December 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bout ended in a draw, 3â3. Ali left without a press conference and suffered damage to his legs as a result of Inoki's repeated kicks.&lt;ref name=sweetScience&gt;{{cite web|last=Tallent|first=Aaron|title=The Joke That Almost Ended Ali's Career|url=http://www.thesweetscience.com/news/articles/1716-the-joke-that-almost-ended-ali-s-career/|accessdate=October 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his retirement, Inoki has promoted a number of MMA events such as ''NJPW: Ultimate Crush'' (which showcased pro wrestling matches and MMA matches on the same card), as well as annual ''Inoki Bom-Ba-Ye'' shows which took place on New Year's Eve in 2001, 2002 and 2003. Some of the major attractions of these events involve the best of NJPW against world-renowned fighters in mixed martial arts matches. Inoki vs. [[Renzo Gracie]] was a professional wrestling match that took place at ''Inoki Bom-Ba-Ye 2000'' against mixed martial artist Renzo Gracie. Inoki was also the ambassador for the [[International Fight League]]'s Tokyo entry before that promotion's demise.

==In media==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=July 2013}}
Inoki appears both in the [[manga]] and [[anime]] ''[[Tiger Mask]]'', in a secondary role: in the Japanese series he is the only one who was able to win over [[Tiger Mask|Naoto Date]], i.e. Tiger Mask, and the two became best friends subsequently.

Inoki appeared in the film ''[[The Bad News Bears Go to Japan]]'' as himself. A [[subplot]] in his scenes involved Inoki seeking a rematch with Ali. [[Gene LeBell]], who also appears in these scenes as a manager of Inoki's scheduled opponent, Mean Bones Beaudine, was the referee of Inoki's match with Ali. Inoki's appearance in the film culminates with a match against the main character, Marvin Lazar (played by [[Tony Curtis]]), when Beaudine suddenly becomes unavailable to participate. Professional wrestler [[HÃ©ctor Guerrero]] served as Curtis's stunt double for the wrestling portions of this scene.

Inoki had the starring role in the film ''Acacia'' directed by [[Hitonari Tsuji|Jinsei Tsuji]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |date=September 20, 2010 |title=Int'l film festival begins in N. Korea, playing Japan's 'Acacia' |url= |newspaper=[[Kyodo News]] |location= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Oh!Great's manga [[Air Gear]], Inoki is regularly referred to by the author, and also the characters as an influence on their fighting style. The manga also makes several less than complimentary references to Inoki's large chin. Along with Inoki, [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]] of the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] has been referred to in Air Gear's pages, often in naming things.
(This is based on the translation by Tanoshimi Manga, and later by Balantine Books/[[Del Rey Books]]. Other translations may omit these references).

The pro-wrestler character Kanji Igari in the manga (and anime) series [[Baki the Grappler]] is based heavily on Inoki. 

Several episodes of the Japanese comedy show ''[[Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!]]'' (most notably 2007's "Do Not Laugh at the Hospital" and 2009's "Do Not Laugh as a Hotel Man") have included parodies of Inoki. In the former, three "patients" are presented as being Inoki, with each imitating Inoki's in-ring persona; while in the latter, the guest known only as ''Shin Onii'' was asked to imitate Inoki as if he were a hotel bellhop.

An '''armoured flight deck''' is an [[aircraft carrier]] [[flight deck]] that incorporates substantial armour in its design.

Comparison is often made between the carrier designs of the [[Royal Navy]] (RN) and the [[United States Navy]] (USN). The two navies followed differing philosophies in the use of armour on carrier flight decks, starting with the design of the RN's {{sclass-|Illustrious|aircraft carrier|4}} and ending with the design of the {{sclass-|Midway|aircraft carrier|4}}, when the USN also adopted armoured flight decks. The two classes most easily compared are the RN's ''Illustrious'' class and {{sclass-|Implacable|aircraft carrier|4}} and their nearest USN contemporaries, the {{sclass-|Yorktown|aircraft carrier|5}} and {{sclass-|Essex|aircraft carrier|4}}es. The ''Illustrious'' class followed the ''Yorktown'' but preceded the ''Essex'', while the ''Implacable''-class design predated the ''Essex'' but these ships were completed after the lead ships of the ''Essex'' class. The development of armoured flight deck carriers proceeded during World War II, and before the end of World War II both the USN, with {{USS|Midway|CV-41|6}}, and the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN), with {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|TaihÅ||2}} and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Shinano||2}} would also commission armoured flight deck carriers, while all USN fleet aircraft carriers built since 1945 feature armoured flight decks.  The remainder of the IJN carrier force during World War II had unarmoured flight decks just like the ''Yorktown'' and ''Essex'' classes of the USN.

==Design==
In choosing the best design for their carriers, the British had to consider the advantages and disadvantages of hangar design. There was a choice between open or closed hangar and the position of the armour. The placing of the strongest deck affected the strength of the hull. The further apart the deck and the keel, the stronger the design. If the flight deck was placed above the main deck then it had to be built to allow for movement with expansion sections.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, DK ''Nelson to Vanguard'' 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A closed hangar design was the strongest structurally and made for a lighter hull and the RN carried this concept one step further and designed the armoured flight deck to also act as the strength deck without any underlying plating, thus achieving an armoured flight deck on the lowest possible displacement.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''British Carrier Aviation'', p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

The carriers that were built with armoured decks fall into two distinct types â those with armour at the flight deck level protecting the hangar and those that only had armour for the lower levels of the ship, typically the hangar deck. The different thickness of armour, and how they were distributed, are described in the table below.

The enclosed hangar design required a deck of approximately this thickness to ensure adequate hull integrity, so the limited armour protection was a by-product of the enclosed hangar design.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Armour at the flight deck level would protect the hangar deck and the aircraft stored there from most bombs. The armour of the ''Illustrious'' class was intended to protect against 1,000 pound bombs.&lt;ref name="Lenton"&gt;''British and Empire Warships of the Second World War'', H T Lenton, Greenhill Books, {{ISBN|1-85367-277-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Illustrious'' class, the armoured flight deck extended for about two-thirds of the length of the ship, bounded by the two aircraft lifts (which were without the armour). The deck was closed by {{convert|4.5|in|mm|adj=on|0}} armoured sides and bulkheads, forming an armoured box. The bulkheads had sliding armoured portals to allow access between the hangar and the aircraft lift. There were {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on|0}} lateral [[strake]]s of main deck armour that extended from the base of the hangar side-wall to the top of the main side belt. The latter protected the machinery, magazines and aircraft fuel and weaponry stores. The RN's closed and armoured hangars were capable of being environmentally sealed for protection against chemical weapon attack. The armoured design meant that it would have to be attacked with Armour Piercing (AP) bombs, which have much less blast effect than higher-capacity General Purpose (GP) bombs carrying about twice the explosive amount. GP bombs also caused severe hull damage if they exploded in the water close to the hull; AP bombs, much less so. 

The USN open hangar design allowed large numbers of aircraft to be warmed up while inside, theoretically reducing the time required to range and launch a strike, but stowage of fuelled and armed aircraft in an unarmoured hangar was extremely dangerous:

{{quote|...Captain [[John S. McCain, Sr.|John S. McCain]] of the {{USS|Ranger|CV-4|2}}...actually preferred a relatively small carrier, as long as it could be protected against bombing. Again and again he told the [[General Board]] that any U.S. carrier, if her flight and hangar decks were crowded with fuelled and bombed aircraft, was a potential inferno, and that friendly fighters could not guarantee the security of any flight deck...|&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''US Aircraft Carriers'', pp. 139â140&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the war, the British fitted immersion heaters to the oil tanks of their aircraft so minimal warm-up was required when they reach the flight deck.&lt;ref&gt;Brown D K, ''Nelson to Vanguard''&lt;/ref&gt;

The US carriers after the Lexington class and the earlier Japanese carriers had their armour placed at the hangar deck, essentially treating the hangar spaces and flight deck as superstructure â making these areas very vulnerable to the blast from GP bombs and other explosions, which in turn caused massive casualties in comparison to RN designs. A bomb that struck the flight deck would likely penetrate and explode in the hangar deck, but the armour there could still protect the ship's vitals â including the engine spaces and fuel storage. The flight deck could also possibly fuze light bombs prematurely, which would reduce the chance of them going through the hangar deck. Such a design allowed for larger, open-sided hangar bays (improving ventilation but making the ship very vulnerable to chemical weapon attack) and the installation of deck-edge elevators. USN carriers with hangar deck armour only, usually had wooden decking over thin mild steel flight decks which were easy to repair. The USN moved the structural strength deck to the flight deck,&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''US Carriers'', p.255.&lt;/ref&gt; starting with the {{sclass-|Forrestal|aircraft carrier|4}} which&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''British Carrier Development''. When the flight deck becomes the strength deck, the aircraft hangars are then enclosed within the hull structure. The terms, 'enclosed' and 'open' hangars do not, strictly speaking, refer to a hangar that is closed or open on the sides,  but rather to whether the hangar is, respectively, below or above the strength deck.&lt;/ref&gt; had "...an enclosed..." hangar.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''US Aircraft Carriers'', p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aviation fuel delivery and stowage systems were extremely vulnerable. The Royal Navy stowed aviation fuel in cylindrical tanks, that in turn were surrounded by seawater. RN aviation fuel lines were purged with [[carbon dioxide]] when not in use. The USN used a similar system, which was further improved after the two navies began exchanging information in 1940. Pre-war USN and IJN carrier designs used a fuel stowage system which was not as secure as that used by the RN, but allowed for much greater stowage capacity. Several USN and IJN carriers&lt;ref&gt;{{USS|Lexington|CV-2|2}}, {{USS|Wasp|CV-7|2}} and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|TaihÅ||2}} are commonly cited examples.&lt;/ref&gt; were lost due to aviation gas fume explosions.

==Doctrine and design==
The Royal Navy had to be ready to fight a war in the confines of the [[North Sea]] and [[Mediterranean Sea]], under the umbrella of land-based enemy air forces.&lt;ref name="Lenton" /&gt; The Royal Navy, with its extensive network of bases and colonies in the Pacific Ocean, had also to be ready to fight in the vast expanses of the Pacific, as did the USN and the IJN, but the USN and IJN did not have to worry about operating in the Mediterranean. The differences in construction were determined by doctrine that was largely driven by the different approaches to the same tactical problem: How to destroy the enemy's aircraft carriers while surviving the inevitable counter strike. Prior to WWII the RN and USN both recognised that the dive bomber could disable the flight decks of enemy aircraft carriers:

{{quote|...From about 1933 on, the Admiralty showed increasing interest in dive-bombing, as the best means of accurate delivery against small and highly manoeuvrable ships. Dive-bombing was also particularly attractive as a means of neutralizing enemy aircraft carriers, which some in the Fleet Air Arm considered their primary targets. British observers seem to have been impressed by US demonstrations...|&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''British Carrier Aviation'', p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The RN was thus faced with designing a carrier that would be survivable under the conditions to be expected in the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Pacific Oceans, and before the development of effective naval [[List of World War II British naval radar|radar]]; these conflicting demands resulted in the development of aircraft carriers whose decks were armoured against 500&amp;nbsp;lb Armour Piercing bombs and 1000&amp;nbsp;lb General Purpose bombs. The RN considered that an unarmoured carrier would be unlikely to be able fly off more than one deck load of strike aircraft prior to being attacked so the armoured flight deck carriers accepted a reduction in hangar capacity to the equivalent to one deck load of aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''British Carrier Aviation'', p.156-159&lt;/ref&gt; USN, IJN some RN Fleet carriers such as ''Ark Royal'' had sufficient aircraft capacity to allow for two ranges, each equal to a full deck load&lt;ref&gt;To "range" aircraft means to fuel, arm, and arrange the aircraft on the flight deck, for take off. This process could take upwards of an hour, for a full deck load of aircraft.&lt;/ref&gt; of strike aircraft. The RN and IJN limited their aircraft carrier's aircraft capacity to the capacity of their hangars, and struck down all aircraft between operations. The USN, typically, used a permanent deck park to augment the capacity of their aircraft carrier's hangars. The use of a permanent deck park appeared to give USN carriers a much larger aircraft capacity than contemporary RN armoured flight deck carriers. The flight deck armour also reduced the length of the flight deck, reducing the maximum aircraft capacity of the armoured flight deck carrier, however the largest part of the disparity between RN and USN carriers in aircraft capacity was due to the use of a permanent deck park on USN carriers.&lt;ref&gt;Hone, Friedman, Mandeles, ''British and American Carrier Development, 1919â1941'', p125.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;USS ''Bennington'', ''Action Report, OPERATIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE OCCUPATION OF OKINAWA INCLUDING STRIKE AGAINST KANOYA AIRFIELD, KYUSHU. 28 May to 10 June 1945'', p.18. On June 05 1945, USS ''Bennington'' reported that her maximum hangar capacity was 51 aircraft, 15 SB2Cs and 36 F4Us, and that 52 were carried as a deck park. At that time she carried 15 TBMs, 15 SB2Cs and the rest were a mix of F6Fs and F4Us. She was prompted to utilize, and report on, her maximum hangar storage due to a Typhoon.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal Navy also had the disadvantage that they entered into World War II with the Royal Navy being pitted against large, [[Luftwaffe|land based, air-forces]] whose aircraft also had superior performance to all existing naval aircraft, while the RAF's increased demand for high performance land based aircraft, after the [[Fall of France]], actually retarded the production and development of [[Fleet Air Arm]] aircraft. On the other hand, the RN rapidly introduced new technologies, such as radar which enhanced the defensive capability of aircraft carriers. The RN thus had to develop new operational doctrines during the war. The USN, in contrast, was able to benefit from technology transfers from the UK and the wartime experiences of the RN, which was freely shared with the USN, prior to its entry into the war, allowing it to anticipate the changes needed to prepare its carriers for the coming conflict with Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Hone, Friedman, Mandeles, ''British and American Carrier Development, 1919â1941'', pp. 142â143.&lt;/ref&gt; The USN designed the armoured flight decks of the ''Midway''-class carriers based upon an analysis of the effectiveness of RN armoured flight decks.&lt;ref name="CV13 Damage Report"&gt;Bureau of Ships, Navy Dept [http://www.researcheratlarge.com/Ships/CV13/1946DamageReport.html CV13 Damage Report]&lt;/ref&gt; The IJN also benefited from being able to observe the effectiveness of RN aircraft carriers in action, while both the USN and IJN were able to introduce new aircraft types, prior to their entry into World War II.

==Aircraft restrictions==
All RN fleet carriers had {{convert|16|ft|m|abbr=on}} hangar heights, except the two ''Implacable''-class ships, which had {{convert|14|ft|m|abbr=on}} heights, and ''Indomitable'' which had a {{convert|16|ft|m|abbr=on}} lower hangar and a {{convert|14|ft|m|abbr=on}} upper hangar.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''British Carrier Aviation'', p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Illustrious'' class had a single {{convert|16|ft|m|abbr=on}} high hangar that was {{convert|468|ft|m|abbr=on}} long.  Within the confines of ship design, and the [[Second London Naval Treaty]] to which they complied, the ''Indomitable'' and ''Implacable''-class carriers had to accept a reduction in hangar heights (to keep the [[metacentric height]] within acceptable limits) and size, and as a result, had some restriction on aircraft types supplied via [[Lend-Lease]]. IJN carriers typically had {{convert|16|ft}}   high hangars, including ''TaihÅ'' and ''Shinano''. The USN {{Sclass-|Lexington|aircraft carrier|4}} had {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} hangar heights while the ''Yorktown'', ''Wasp'', ''Essex'', and ''Midway'' classes had {{convert|17|ft|6|in|abbr=on}} hangar heights.

==Defences==
The British approach of armoured flight decks was meant as an effective form of passive defence from bombs and [[kamikaze]] attacks that actually struck their carriers, while the American carriers primarily relied on fighters to prevent the carriers from being hit in the first place. In addition, RN carriers such as ''Ark Royal'' or ''Illustrious'' had far heavier anti-aircraft (AA) outfits than their USN counterparts, up to the introduction of the USN ''Essex''-class carriers. ''Ark Royal'', in 1940, carried 16 x [[QF 4.5 inch Mk I â V naval gun|4.5-inch guns]], 32 [[QF 2 pounder naval gun|40mm "Pom-pom"]] and 32 [[Vickers machine gun|0.5 inch]] guns against 8 x 5-inch, 16 x 28 mm and 24 x .5-inch guns for ''Enterprise'', in 1940. ''"In wartime, however, the US Navy found the armoured carriers fascinating. After having examined HMS Formidable in 1940, the US naval attachÃ© commented that, were he crossing the Pacific, he would prefer her to a Yorktown, the closest US equivalent, on the basis that she might carry fewer aircraft, but she would be much more likely to get there".''&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''British Carrier Aviation'', p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Late in the war when the USN operated many carriers together and had improved radar, their fighter and AA defence was reasonably effective, yet both conventional and kamikaze attacks were still able to penetrate USN defences. ''Bunker Hill'' and ''Franklin'' nearly succumbed in 1945. The larger air groups (80â110 planes, vs. 52â81 for [[Implacable-class aircraft carrier|late war British ships]]) allowed for a more effective [[combat air patrol]] (CAP) without reducing strike capability, improving the protection of the whole battle group and lessening the workload of the carrier escorts. Carrier fighters were able to shoot down far more kamikaze aircraft than any amount of deck armour would have protected against showing the value of absolute numbers, but in the early war period IJN aircraft had little difficulty in penetrating USN CAPs; near the end of the war, veteran American fighter pilots in superior [[F6F Hellcat]] and [[F4U Corsair]] fighters were able to defeat the young, inexperienced and ill-trained kamikaze pilots with ease and run up huge kill scores but attackers were still able to get through. (In addition to larger aircraft complements, the US Navy had larger fleets and more resources, so they could establish destroyer pickets as part of their "[[Big blue blanket]]" defense system, and develop dedicated AAW ships such as the {{sclass-|Atlanta|cruiser|0}} antiaircraft cruisers which would have also drawn attention away from the carriers.) On the surface, the record seems balanced.

British naval historian D.K. Brown put the practical difference between American and British design philosophies in no uncertain terms: "More [[fighter aircraft|fighters]] would have been better protection than [[armour]]," but that British designs were good for the circumstances in which they were meant to be used.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;''Nelson to Vanguard: Warship Design 1923â1945'', D.K. Brown, Chatham, {{ISBN|1-86176-136-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, even {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}}, Britain's newest carrier prior to World War II, never operated close to her theoretical aircraft capacity. Prior to the development of effective radar and high speed monoplane fighters, a successful fighter defence was extremely unlikely for any navy thus calling into doubt D.K. Brown's conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Hone, Friedman, Mandeles, ''British and American Carrier Development, 1919â1941'', p. 137: "The carrier revolution was incomplete before World War II. Carriers were terribly vulnerable to one another and to well-trained land-based attack squadrons (as the Luftwaffe showed the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean in 1941). Only when carriers could protect themselves from air attack â which the U.S. carriers could not do until 1943 â could they take the role of sustained combat presence away from surface forces..."&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits of flight deck armour were intended to counter these issues.&lt;ref&gt;Hone, Friedman, Mandeles, ''British and American Carrier Development, 1919â1941'', p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fewer aircraft meant a lower priority to attack than the more heavily armed American carriers and the RN's operational doctrine dictated smaller airgroups, and the armoured hangar carriers had smaller Avgas and ammunition supplies to match. However, RN carriers carried far more aircraft later in the war, making use of the deck park when they adopted USN style operational doctrine. The 2nd generation RN armoured carriers, ''Indomitable'' and the ''Implacable'' class which had an additional half length lower hangar, were considerably less outmatched by their USN counterparts in the numbers of aircraft operated.  The RN operating in harsher weather protected their aircraft from the elements and did not use a permanent deck park in the earlier part of the war. 

===Damage analysis===
US carriers and their fighters shot down more than 1,900 suicide aircraft during ''Operation Kikusui'' (the last and largest Kamikaze attack in the [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa campaign]]), versus a mere 75 for the British, yet both forces suffered the same number of serious hits (four), on their carriers. However the kamikazes made 173&lt;ref&gt;THE UNITED STATES STRATEGIC BOMBING SURVEY (PACIFIC), ''Japanese Airpower'', p. 67"...During the Ryukyus Campaign, March through June, 25 Allied ships were sunk by suicide attacks. Japanese planes scored a total of 182 hits on Allied ships and 97 other planes scored damaging near misses..."&lt;/ref&gt; strikes against other USN targets and the 4 USN carriers suffered a massive death toll, in contrast to the relatively light casualties on the RN carriers.&lt;ref name="Hamer"&gt;''Bombers versus Battleships: The Struggle Between Ships and Aircraft for the Control of the Surface of the Sea'', David J. Hamer, Naval Institute Press, {{ISBN|1-55750-043-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:HMS Formidable (67) on fire 1945.jpg|thumb|HMS ''Formidable'' on fire following two kamikaze strikes, Okinawa, 9 May 1945.  Total casualties, 3 dead and 19 wounded.&lt;ref name="navweaps.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/index_tech/tech-042.htm|title=Kamikaze Damage to US and British Carriers|work=navweaps.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] [[Image:Attack on carrier USS Franklin 19 March 1945.jpg|thumb|USS ''Franklin'' listing, with crew on deck, due to a bomb piercing the unarmoured flight deck, 19 March 1945.  Total casualties, 807 dead and 487 wounded.&lt;ref name="navweaps.com"/&gt;]]
The kamikaze threat overall was serious, but Allied defences neutralised it, and many kamikaze strikes missed the deck armour entirely, or bounced off the decks of both British or American carriers. In some cases, kamikazes either struck glancing blows that did only superficial damage that was fixed within minutes or hours, or missed entirely, due to the poor training and poorer flight experience of their pilots. The majority of kamikazes that did inflict harm caused no more damage than they would have against smaller ships. After a successful kamikaze hit, the British were able to clear the flight deck and resume flight operations in just hours, while their American counterparts often could do the same, but not always; in some cases repairs took a few days or even months. The USN liaison officer on {{HMS|Indefatigable|R10|6}} commented: "When a kamikaze hits a U.S. carrier it means 6 months of repair at [[Pearl Harbor|Pearl [Harbor]]]. When a kamikaze hits a Limey carrier itâs just a case of "[[1MC#Usage examples|Sweepers, man your brooms]]."â&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/37/a4477737.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1346476/Commander-Dickie-Reynolds.html|title=Commander Dickie Reynolds|date=4 July 2000|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American carriers of the ''Essex'' class suffered very high casualties from serious kamikaze hits, though they did survive.  The ships were most vulnerable during the period just prior to and during the launching of strikes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;CV13 Damage Report&lt;/ref&gt; Early versions of the design also had a unified ventilation system that would transfer smoke and heat from the hangar deck to the lower decks in the event of a fire. While not a kamikaze attack {{USS|Franklin|CV-13|6}} was attacked by a dive bomber and struck by two {{convert|250|kg|lb|abbr=on}} bombs, one semi-armour piercing (SAP) and one general purpose (GP), when she had 47 aircraft preparing for a strike on Honshu. Both bombs penetrated into her hangar and set off ordnance and fuel from ruptured aircraft tanks for a planned ground attack relying on GP bombs and ''Tiny Tim'' missiles, killing 724 personnel.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; {{USS|Bunker Hill|CV-17|6}} was severely damaged by pair of kamikaze hits during preparations for an attack on Okinawa which killed 346 men. Each of these USN carriers suffered more casualties than all the British RN armoured carriers combined,&lt;ref&gt;Eadon, Stuart, editor, ''Kamikaze, The Story of the British Pacific Fleet'', Worcester 1991, {{ISBN|1-872017-23-1}}, pp. 338â339: In nine kamikaze strikes "''...The Fleet Air Arm suffered...44 personnel killed...By contrast Bunker Hill lost 387 dead in the Kamikaze attack on 11th&amp;nbsp;of May 1945.''"&lt;/ref&gt; illustrating the life saving features of RN carrier design. ''Illustrious'', which had the highest toll, suffered 126 fatal casualties and 84 wounded when hit by six 1100&amp;nbsp;lb bombs on 10 January 1941. The USN studied the superior defensive qualities of Royal Navy armoured carriers and this analysis is partly revealed in the damage report following the attack on {{USS|Franklin|CV-13|2}} on 13 March 1945:

{{quote|As a result of study of damage sustained by various British carriers prior to our entry into the war, two important departures from traditional U.S. Navy carrier design were incorporated in the CVB Class, then still under development. HMS ILLUSTRIOUS in an action off Malta on 1 January 1941 was hit by several bombs, three of which detonated in the hangar space. Large fires swept fore and aft among parked planes thereby demonstrating the desirability of attempting to confine the limits of such explosions and fires by structural sectionalization of the hangar space. On the CVB Class the hangar was therefore divided into five compartments separated by 40 and 50-pound STS division bulkheads extending from the hangar deck to the flight deck, each fitted with a large door suitable for handling aircraft. It is hoped that this sectionalization, in conjunction with sprinkler and fog foam systems, will effectively prevent fires from spreading throughout the hangar spaces, as occurred on FRANKLIN on 30 October and 19 March. The damage experiences of several British carriers, which unlike our own were fitted with armoured flight decks, demonstrated the effectiveness of such armour in shielding hangar spaces from GP bombs and vital spaces below the hangar deck from SAP bombs. Accordingly, the CVB Class was designed with an armoured flight deck consisting of 3-1/2-inch STS from frames 46 to 175 with a hangar deck consisting of two courses of 40-pound STS between frames 36 and 192. Although none of the CVB Class carriers were completed in time to take part in war operations, the effectiveness of armoured flight decks against Kamikaze attacks was demonstrated by various carriers attached to the British Pacific Fleet. Reference (k) reports two such interesting cases. The VICTORIOUS was struck by three Kamikaze aircraft, two of which ricocheted off the armoured flight deck and over the side, causing no important damage. The third carried a bomb which detonated at frame 30 starboard at the butt of the 3-inch flight deck armour with 1-1/2-inch "D" quality (equivalent to HTS) steel. It does not appear that the Kamikaze actually struck the ship. The bomb detonation, however, depressed the 3-inch deck slightly but did not tear it open. On the other hand, the 1-1/2-inch "D" quality deck plating was ripped open over a total area of about 25 square feet. Two days were required for temporary repairs, at the conclusion of which the ship was fully operational. HMS FORMIDABLE was hit by two bombs, the first of which struck and detonated on the flight deck 9 feet to port of the center-line at frame 79, directly over a deep bent and at a juncture of three armoured plates. The armoured deck was depressed over an area 24 feet long and 20 feet wide. Maximum depression was 15 inches. Adjacent bents spaced 12 feet forward and aft of the point of impact were slightly depressed. A hole 2 square feet in area was blown in the 3-inch deck. Three fragments penetrated downward through the ship into the center boiler room. The damage in this boiler room, which was not described, temporarily reduced speed to 18 knots. The second bomb struck and detonated on the centreline of the flight deck at frame 94. The 3-inch deck and deep bent directly below the point of impact were depressed about 4-1/2 inches and one rivet was knocked out. However, the ship was fully operational within about 5 hours, including flight operations.|&lt;ref name="CV13 Damage Report"/&gt;}}

Paul Silverstone in US warships of World War II notes regarding US carriers that,'vast damage was often caused by suicide planes (Kamikaze) crashing through the wooden flight decks into the hangar below'. Whereas in British carriers 'the steel flight decks showed their worth against Kamikaze attacks.'&lt;ref&gt;US warships of World War ll (1965) by Paul H Silverstone&lt;/ref&gt;

The only Allied carrier lost to a deck hit was the American {{sclass-|Independence|aircraft carrier|0}} light carrier, {{USS|Princeton|CVL-23|6}}. Indeed, many light and escort carriers were unarmoured, with no protection on the hangar or flight deck, and thus they fared poorly against deck hits.

===Postwar analysis===
What was not discovered until late in the war was that the kamikaze impacts proved to have a long-term effect on the structural integrity of some British carriers. Their postwar life was shortened, as the RN had a surplus of carriers with many in shipyards being constructed. The USN rebuilt carriers such as ''Franklin'' that had been completely gutted and the crew decimated by IJN attacks. {{HMS|Formidable|R67|6}} was an excellent example of this; while she weathered a severe kamikaze hit in 1945 which cratered her deck armour, the hit caused severe internal structural damage and permanently warped the hull&lt;ref name="Source needed"&gt;Source needed&lt;/ref&gt; (damage worsened in a postwar aircraft-handling accident wherein a [[Vought F4U Corsair|Vought Corsair]] rolled off a lift&lt;ref name="Source needed"/&gt; and raked the hangar deck with 20mm cannon fire, causing a severe fire&lt;ref name="Source needed"/&gt;); but plans to rebuild her as per [[HMS Victorious (R38)#Postwar|''Victorious'']] were abandoned due to budget cuts, not structural damage,&lt;ref name="Friedman, p305"&gt;Friedman, ''British Carrier Aviation'', p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; and she lingered in reserve until 1956 before being towed off to the breakers. However, no citation is ever given for this accident which appears to be a distorted fabrication of Formidable's May 18, 1945, hangar fire. She carried no air group post war, and never carried the 20 mm Corsair.  The Royal Navy planned to rebuild most of the armoured carriers in the early postwar period:

{{quote|There seems to have been general agreement that the first ship to be modernized should be an Illustrious. Formidable was laid up and required a long refit in any case, so she was provisionally selected for modernization. Illustrious was a deck landing training and trials carrier, and could not be spared, particularly as she was needed to test the new generation of naval aircraft. This left HMS Victorious as the only other candidate. In early 1951 the other two ships of the programme were HMS Implacable, followed by HMS Indefatigable, for modernisation, respectively, 1953â55 (to relieve HMS Eagle so that she could refit in 1956 with steam catapults) and 1954â57. HMS Indomitable was scheduled for a more limited modernisation (1957) as the future deck landing training ship. At this time Eagle was scheduled for completion in August 1951 and Ark Royal in 1954, so that the full programme would provide the Royal Navy with five fleet carriers plus a semi-modernised deck landing training ship.|&lt;ref name="Friedman, p305"/&gt;}}

''Illustrious'' suffered a similar battering, especially off of Malta in 1941 when hit by German dive bombers and late in the war was limited to 22&amp;nbsp;knots (41&amp;nbsp;km/h) because her centreline shaft was disabled due to accumulated wartime damage;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, David, ''Warship Profile 11, HMS Illustrious Aircraft Carrier 1939â1956, Operational History'', p. 235: After the war she was given the role of a training and trials ship, and she continued to be plagued by vibration problems which were partially cured by new propeller designs. In 1946 she had a new 5 bladed propeller fitted to the centre shaft. She was refitted and modernised from January to August 1948, and made 29 knots on trials with 110,600 SHP at 227.5 RPM. In 1950 on full power trials she made 29.2 knots with 111,480 SHP at 225.1 RPM.&lt;/ref&gt; she spent five years as a training and trials carrier (1948â53) and was disposed of in 1954. ''Indomitable'' was completely refit to like-new condition, only to suffer a severe gasoline explosion on board, which caused "''considerable structural and electrical damage to the ship''".&lt;ref name="UK Hansard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1953/feb/11/hms-indomitable-explosion|title=H.M.S. "Indomitable" (Explosion)|work=millbanksystems.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Indomitable'' was refitted between 1948 and 1950 and served as flagship of the Home Fleet then served a tour of duty in the Mediterranean, where she was damaged by the petrol explosion. She was partially repaired before proceeding under her own power&lt;ref name="UK Hansard"/&gt; to [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]'s 1953 Coronation Review, before being placed in reserve in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-04CV-Indomitable.htm Service History of HMS ''Indomitable'']&lt;/ref&gt; ''Indomitable'' was scrapped in 1956. The explosion which occurred on ''Indomitable''{{'}}s hangar deck, while severe, would also have caused severe casualties and extensive damage to an ''Essex''-class carrier, several of which returned to service after hangar explosions, primarily due to the USN's considerable financial and material resources. The postwar Royal Navy could only afford to rebuild ''Victorious'' and had to abandon plans to rebuild four other armoured carriers due to cost, and to provide crews to man the postwar built carriers, such as {{HMS|Ark Royal|R09|2}}, due to reductions in manpower.&lt;ref name="Friedman, p305"/&gt;

Another factor is the advantage in resources that the US Navy had over the Royal Navy. The numerous and capacious American yards on the East and West Coasts allowed the US Navy to build and repair carriers at a more leisurely pace and higher quality individually, while producing ships collectively at a furious rate. The British with their strained facilities were forced to rush repairs (indeed the overloaded British shipyards had forced some vessels to be sent to the US for repairs) and some ships such as ''Illustrious'', were forced into service even though not fully repaired. The RN was in a state of continual contraction after WWII, and simply did not have the resources or inclination to repair ships that it could no longer man.

==''Midway'' and ''Forrestal'' classes==
While flight deck level armour was eventually adopted by the Americans for the {{sclass-|Midway|aircraft carrier|5}} design, the strength deck remained on the hangar level. ''Midway'' had originally been planned to have a very heavy gun armament (8-inch weapons). The removal of these weapons freed up enough tonnage to add {{convert|3|in|mm|0}} of armour at the flight deck level. While this made a great deal of sense from an air group perspective, the ''Midway'' ships sat very low in the water for carriers (due to their much greater displacement), certainly much lower than the smaller ''Essex''-class carriers, and had a great deal of difficulty operating in heavy seas.  Flight deck armoured ships almost universally (except for the ''Midway'' class as completed) possessed a hurricane bow, where the bows were sealed up to the flight deck; wartime experience demonstrated that ships with the hurricane bow configuration (also including the American ''Lexington'' class) shipped less water than ships with an open bow. Late-life refits to ''Midway'' to bulge her hull and improve freeboard instead gave her a dangerously sharp roll, and made flight operations difficult even in moderate seas. This was therefore not repeated on ''Coral Sea'' (''Franklin D. Roosevelt'' had been decommissioned years earlier). After the war, most of the ''Essex''-class ships were modified with a hurricane bow and in the case of ''Oriskany'' the wooden flight deck surface was replaced with aluminium for improved resistance against the blast of jet engines, making them appear to have armoured flight decks, but in fact their armour remained at hangar level.

The supercarriers of the postwar era, starting with the {{sclass-|Forrestal|aircraft carrier|4}} â nearly {{convert|200|ft|m}} longer and {{convert|40|ft|m}} wider in the beam than their World War II counterparts â would eventually be forced to move the strength deck up to the flight deck level as a result of their great size; a shallow hull of those dimensions became too impractical to continue. The issue of protection had no influence on the change; the ''Forrestal'' class had an armoured flight deck&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/cv-59.htm CV-59 FORRESTAL class]:"As the first aircraft carrier designed specifically for jet aircraft, she featured an armored flight deck."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hazegray.org/navhist/carriers/us_super.htm#for-cl ''Forrestal class attack aircraft carriers'']:"Armor: hangar, flight deck and magazines protected"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalcoldwarexhibition.org/explore/ship.cfm?ship=Forrestal%20Class|title=Overview â Forrestal Class â Collections â Research â National Cold War Exhibition|work=nationalcoldwarexhibition.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forrestalmemorial.com/id6.html USS Forrestal Memorial (CVA/CV/AVT-59) 29 July 1967]: "The explosions tore large holes in the armored flight deck..."&lt;/ref&gt; of at least 1.5"&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, US Aircraft Carriers, p280:The USN DCNO (Air) in discussing follow on designs to the ''Forrestal'' class: "The only saving available was armo&lt;!-- verbatim --&gt;r: 'a couple of inches of armo&lt;!-- verbatim --&gt;r plating is hardly more than splinter protection against modern weapons, yet it imposes a tremendous penalty in topside weight plus the necessity for massive support structure. If not eliminated, this armor could at least be dropped to hangar deck levels...' "&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtualwall.org/units/forrestal.htm USS FORRESTAL (CVA-59)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304185813/http://www.virtualwall.org/units/forrestal.htm |date=4 March 2016 }}:"Over a dozen 1,000 and 500 pound bombs detonated within the first few minutes of the fire, punching holes through the 3" armor plating of the flight deck."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Aircraft Carriers'', pp. 259â261: ''Although the aviators dominated the design, BuOrd lobbied hard for a level of protection better than what had been accepted in the United States. It was particularly dissatisfied with the decision to split the flight-deck armor into separate 2-in and 1-in (gallery-dcck) thicknesses, arguing that the minimum acceptable should be the 3.5 inches of the Midway, 60 pounds over that of the earlier carrier (and representing a weight gain of about 5,000 tons very high in the ship). The bureau argued that 3.5 inches would keep out all GP bombs up to 2,000 pounds, and that it would also keep out semi-armor-piercing (SAP) bombs up to 1,000 pounds''. and p. 271: "Part of the BuShips analysis of the CVA 3/53 exercise was a demand for at least 60-lb flight-deck protection rather than the 55-lb actually provided. CVA 10/53 restored the 60-lb flight deck..."&lt;/ref&gt; thickness. Some of the follow on classes to the ''Forrestal''s also had armoured flight decks&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emcs.org/committees/tc06/2009/2009%2008%2017%20Randy%20Jost%20-TC6-Presentation.pdf Jost, R.J., ''An Approach to Addressing Spectrum Management Issues for Radar Systems''] p. 7: "USS Enterprise (CV-65)...Required 3 months for repairs, primarily to flight deck armor plating."&lt;/ref&gt; although deck armour is of little to no use against modern anti-ship missiles, it may help limit the damage from flight deck explosions. The experience of World War II caused the USN to change their design policy in favour of armoured flight decks:

{{quote|The main armor carried on Enterprise is the heavy armored flight deck. This was to prove a significant factor in the catastrophic fire and explosions that occurred on Enterprise's flight deck in 1969. The US Navy learned its lesson the hard way during World War II when all its carriers had only armored hangar decks. All attack carriers built since the Midway class have had armored flight decks.|&lt;ref&gt;Cracknell, W.H, Cmdr USN, ''Warship Profile 15, USS Enterprise (CVAN 65) Nuclear Attack Carrier'', p56.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The first volume appeared in March 1907 and the last three volumes appeared in 1912, followed by a master index volume in 1914 and later supplementary volumes. It was designed "to give its readers full and authoritative information on the entire cycle of [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] interests, action and doctrine".&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Encyclopedia preface|Preface]] to the ''Catholic Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Image:Original_preface_1_watermarked_.jpg |title=Scan of 'Preface' |publisher=Catholic Answers |location=El Cajon, California |access-date=September 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' was published by the Robert Appleton Company (RAC), a [[publishing]] company incorporated at [[New York (state)|New York]] in February 1905 for the express purpose of publishing the encyclopedia. The five members of the encyclopedia's Editorial Board also served as the directors of the company. In 1912 the company's name was changed to The Encyclopedia Press. Publication of the encyclopedia's volumes was the sole business conducted by the company during the project's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1917 |chapter=The Making of the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' |chapterurl=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/00001a.htm |title=''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' and its Makers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H6AZAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Catholic+encyclopedia+and+its+makers%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location=New York |publisher=The Encyclopedia Press |pages=iiiâviii |oclc=748253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The encyclopedia was designed to serve the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], concentrating on information related to the Church and explaining matters from the Catholic point of view. It records the accomplishments of Catholics and others in nearly all intellectual and professional pursuits, including artists, educators, poets and scientists. While more limited in focus than other general encyclopedias, it was far broader in scope than previous efforts at comprehensive Catholic encyclopedias, which had studied only internal Church affairs.

It offers in-depth portrayals of historical and philosophical ideas, persons and events, from a Catholic perspective, including issues that divide Catholicism from [[Protestantism]] and other faith communities. Since the encyclopedia was first published starting in 1907 and has never been updated (versus the ''[[New Catholic Encyclopedia]]''), many of its entries may be out of date either with respect to the wider culture or to the Catholic [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] world. In particular, it predates the creation of the [[Vatican City|Vatican City State]] (1929) and the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962â1965), which introduced many significant changes in Catholic practice: For example, the online version of the entries on [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]] at newadvent.org states in an editorial note: "To complement this article, which was taken from the 1910 Catholic Encyclopedia, New Advent recommends a prayerful reading of 'Nostra Aetate' from the Second Vatican Council."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10424a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Mohammed and Mohammedanism (Islam)|website=Newadvent.org|access-date=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The writing of the encyclopedia began on January 11, 1905, under the supervision of five editors:
* [[Charles George Herbermann|Charles G. Herbermann]], Professor of [[Latin]] and librarian of the [[City College of New York|College of the City of New York]]
* [[Edward A. Pace]], Professor of Philosophy at [[Catholic University of America|The Catholic University of America]] in Washington, D.C.
* [[CondÃ© Benoist Pallen|CondÃ© B. Pallen]], editor
* The Rev. [[Thomas Joseph Shahan|Thomas J. Shahan]], Professor of [[History of the Catholic Church|Church History]] at The Catholic University
* The Rev. John J. Wynne, [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]], editor of ''[[Messenger of the Sacred Heart]]''

The first edition was initially printed by Robert Appleton Company. The volumes came out sequentially the first two in 1907 and the last three in 1912:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Original_Catholic_Encyclopedia:About |title=About |publisher=Catholic Answers |location=El Cajon, California |access-date=September 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The editors had their first editorial meeting at the office of ''The Messenger'', on West 16th Street, [[New York City]]. The text received a ''[[nihil obstat]]'' from an official censor, Remy Lafort, on November 1, 1908 and an [[imprimatur]] from [[John Murphy Farley]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York|Archbishop of New York]]. This review process was presumably accelerated by the reuse of older authorized publications. In addition to frequent informal conferences and constant communication by letters, the editors subsequently held 134 formal meetings to consider the plan, scope and progress of the work, culminating in publication on April 19, 1913. A first supplement was published in 1922; a second supplement in nine loose-leaf sections was published by The Gilmary Society between 1950 and 1958.

In 1912, a special completely illustrated commemorative volume was awarded to those patrons who contributed to the start of the enterprise by buying multiple encyclopedia sets early on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://celledoor.blogspot.com/2010/06/selected-illustrations-from-catholic.html |title=Celledoor Miscellany: Selected Illustrations from the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' |publisher=Celledoor.blogspot.com |date=June 7, 2010 |access-date=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was controversy over the presence of the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' in public libraries in the United States with [[Nativism (politics)#Nativism in the United States|nativist]] protests that this violated the [[separation of church and state]], including a successful appeal in [[Belleville, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=s1pzTh9oh2gC ''Separation of Church and State''], [[Philip Hamburger|Hamburger, Philip]], Harvard University Press (2002), p. 412.&lt;/ref&gt;

The encyclopedia was later updated under the auspices of The Catholic University of America and a 17-volume ''[[New Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' was first published in 1967, and then in 2002.

===Authors and sources===
''The Catholic Encyclopedia and its makers'' states that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The work is entirely new, and not merely a translation or a compilation from other encyclopedic sources. The editors have insisted that the articles should contain the latest and most accurate information to be obtained from the standard works on each subject.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, "from standard works" allows that some of the articles from European contributors such as [[Pierre Batiffol]] (French), [[Johann Peter Kirsch]] (German) had previously been published in whole or in part in Europe and were translated and edited for the Encyclopedia.&lt;ref&gt;''The Catholic encyclopedia and its makers'' 1917&lt;/ref&gt; Those who wrote new articles in English include [[Anthony Maas]] and [[Herbert Thurston]].

==Online versions==
Under [[copyright law of the United States]], all works published in the United States before 1923 are in the [[public domain]].  In 1993, Kevin Knight, then a 26-year-old resident of [[Denver, Colorado]], decided, during the visit of [[Pope John Paul II]] to that city for [[World Youth Day]], to launch a project to publish the 1913 edition of the encyclopedia on the Internet. Knight founded the Web site [[New Advent]] to host the undertaking. Volunteers from the United States, Canada, France, and [[Brazil]] helped in the transcription of the original material. The site went online in 1995, and transcription work ended in 1997.&lt;ref group=Volumes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/index.html |title=''The Catholic Encyclopedia''|publisher=[[New Advent]]|access-date=September 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, [[Catholic Answers]] published a watermarked version derived from page scans. This version has since been replaced with a transcription of the ''Encyclopedia'' similar to that found at the New Advent site.&lt;ref group=Volumes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.com|title=''Catholic Encyclopedia'' |publisher=[[Catholic Answers]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Answers transcription, however, is an exact transcription of the original text, whereas the New Advent version at times modernizes certain words (e.g., using the names of Old Testament books found in modern Bibles, such as "1 &amp; 2 Chronicles" and "Obadiah", in place of the [[Vulgate]]/[[DouayâRheims Bible|DouayâRheims]] titles, such as "1 &amp; 2 Paralipomenon" and "Abdias") and Biblical citation formatting (i.e., the Catholic Answers version retains the original's usage of Roman numerals for chapter numbers [e.g., Genesis i, 1], while the New Advent version uses Arabic numerals throughout [e.g., Genesis 1:1]).

Other scanned copies of the 1913 Encyclopedia are available on [[Google Books]], at the [[Internet Archive]], and at [[Wikimedia Commons]]. [[Wikisource]] also hosts a transcription project backed by the scans hosted at Commons.&lt;ref name=list group=Volumes&gt;

'''''Christian Lawyers Association v Minister of Health''''' is a case in which the [[Transvaal Provincial Division]] of the [[High Court of South Africa]] ruled on the constitutionality of the [[Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act]], the law which governs [[abortion in South Africa]]. The Christian Lawyers Association claimed that abortion violates [[Section Eleven of the Constitution of South Africa|section 11]] of the [[Constitution of South Africa|Constitution]], which provides that "Everyone has the right to life." The government noted an exception (a [[demurrer]]) on the grounds that constitutional rights do not apply to fetuses and that there was therefore no case to answer. The court accepted the government's argument and the case was dismissed.

'''''The Coffee With...'' biography''' series is a selection of books published by [[Duncan Baird Publishing|Duncan Baird]] between 2007 and 2008 each containing fictional conversations with real famous people, conveying biographical fact. A review of ''Coffee With Oscar Wilde'' in ''The Independent'', for example, explains that in it the author, Wilde's grandson [[Merlin Holland]], "offers an imaginary and imaginative conversation between himself and his grandfather, set in a contemporary Parisian cafÃ©". The review described that volume as "an ideal introduction to Wilde's seductive and intellectually electrifying world".&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt;

The first set of volumes published in 2007 covered eight figures: [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Gautama Buddha]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Mozart]], [[Plato]], [[Oscar Wilde]], and [[Groucho Marx]].&lt;ref name="LJ" /&gt;

==Overview==
According to the [[Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS), it "Developed and executed the Critical Foreign Dependencies Initiative (CFDI) which extends our protection strategy overseas to include important foreign infrastructure that if attacked or destroyed would critically impact the U.S. The prioritized National Critical Foreign Dependencies List (NCFDL) currently contains over 300 assets and systems in over 50 countries."&lt;ref name="Department of Homeland Security"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Department of Homeland Security Intelligence Enterprise: Operational Overview and Oversight Challenges for Congress |last=Randol |first=Mark |year=2010 |publisher=DIANE Publishing |location= |isbn= |page=17 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RYFVXzq4QC4C&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=%22Critical+Foreign+Dependencies+Initiative%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=16gATeX-IMP-8Ab5xLmjBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Critical%20Foreign%20Dependencies%20Initiative%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2009 [[National Infrastructure Protection Plan]], the CFDI was launched by the federal government "working in close coordination and cooperation with the private sector" in 2007 "to identify assets and systems located outside the United States, which, if disrupted or destroyed, would critically affect public health and safety, the economy, or national security. The resulting strategic compendium guides engagement with foreign countries in the CIKR [critical infrastructure and key resources] protection mission area".&lt;ref name="MSNBC"&gt;{{cite news |title=WikiLeaks publishes list of worldwide infrastructure 'critical' to security of U.S. |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40526224/ |newspaper=[[msnbc.com|MSNBC]] |date=6 December 2010 |accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NIPP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA502695|title=National Infrastructure Protection Plan|publisher=Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology, Washington DC|date=2009-00-00}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Homeland security: assessing the first five years |last=Chertoff |first=Michael |year=2009 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=87â88 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f1_8JM9bcA8C&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=%22Critical+Foreign+Dependencies+Initiative%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=16gATeX-IMP-8Ab5xLmjBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Critical%20Foreign%20Dependencies%20Initiative%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using an initial inventory of infrastructure located outside the United States created by the federal government, DHS and the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] (DOS) developed the CFDI, "a process designed to ensure that the resulting classified list of critical foreign dependencies is representative and leveraged in a coordinated and inclusive manner."&lt;ref name=NIPP /&gt;

Development of the CFDI was planned in three phases, on an annual and ongoing basis. The first phase was identification, beginning with "the first-ever National Critical Foreign
Dependencies List in [[Fiscal year|FY]]2008". This was done by the DHS working with "other Federal partners", in a process that "includes input from public and private sector CIKR community partners." Next comes prioritization, in which "DHS, in collaboration with other CIKR community partners and, in particular, DOS, prioritized the National Critical Foreign Dependencies List based on factors such as the overall criticality of the CIKR to the United States and the willingness and capability of foreign partners to engage in collaborative risk management activities." The third "involves leveraging the prioritized list to guide current and future U.S. bilateral
and multilateral incident and risk management activities with foreign partners. DHS and DOS established mechanisms to ensure coordinated engagement and collaboration by public entities, in partnership with the private sector."&lt;ref name=NIPP /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=WikiLeaks Endangers US Critical Infrastructure |author=Anthony L. Kimery |url=http://www.hstoday.us/content/view/15654/149/ |newspaper=Homeland Security Today |date=7 December 2010 |accessdate=10 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210183402/http://www.hstoday.us/content/view/15654/149 |archivedate=10 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disclosure==
The "2008 Critical Foreign Dependencies Initiative (CFDI) list" was contained in a February 2009 diplomatic cable to the U.S. Secretary of State, [[Hillary Clinton]], which was leaked, redacted and released in the [[United States diplomatic cables leak]] by [[WikiLeaks]] in 2010. The BBC described it as "one of the most sensitive" leaks as of 6 December 2010.&lt;ref name="BBC06"/&gt; In its redaction process, WikiLeaks removed only a minority of the details of names and locations, and left the rest uncensored; details of the exact location of the assets were not included in the list.&lt;ref name="MSNBC" /&gt; The list did not include any military facilities, but rather facilities important for the global supply chain, global communications, and economically important goods and services.&lt;ref name="BBC06"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Kendall, Bridget |title=Wikileaks: site list reveals US sensitivities |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/11932041 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=6 December 2010 |accessdate=8 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uoxgrdN5?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/11932041 |archivedate=8 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the cable the State Department asked American diplomats to identify installations overseas "whose loss could critically impact the public health, economic security, and/or national and homeland security of the United States."&lt;ref name="CNN07"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Lister, Tim |title=WikiLeaks lists sites key to U.S. security |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/US/12/06/wikileaks/?hpt=Sbin |publisher=CNN |date=7 December 2010 |accessdate=8 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023024102/http://edition.cnn.com/2010/US/12/06/wikileaks/?hpt=Sbin |archivedate=23 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The order was under the direction of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department for Homeland Security]] in co-ordination with the Department of State.&lt;ref name="Australian06"&gt;{{Cite news|author1=Haynes, Deborah |author2=Mostrous, Alexi |author3=Whittell, Giles |title=WikiLeaks lists 'targets for terror' against US |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/in-depth/wikileaks/wikileaks-lists-targets-for-terror-against-us/story-fn775xjq-1225966496899 |work=[[Times Online]] |publisher=[[The Australian]] |date=7 December 2010 |accessdate=8 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5up0AdST7?url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/in-depth/wikileaks/wikileaks-lists-targets-for-terror-against-us/story-fn775xjq-1225966496899 |archivedate=8 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary the list consists of [[Submarine communications cable]]s, major port hubs, critical sea lanes, oil pipelines, mines, dams, and [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical facilities]]. A major emphasis on European pharmaceutical facilities was said by the BBC to suggest a fear of biological warfare or global pandemic.&lt;ref name="BBC06"/&gt;

===Responses to disclosure===
The cable had been classified [[Classified information in the United States#Secret|secret]] and not for review by non-U.S. personnel,.&lt;ref name="CNN07"/&gt; The publication of the cable was followed by strong criticism from the US government and the British government, but a tepid response from news outlets and other foreign nations.

WikiLeaks spokesman [[Kristinn Hrafnsson]] said with reference to the cable: "This further undermines claims made by the US Government that its embassy officials do not play an intelligence-gathering role. Part of the cable read: "Posts are not/not being asked to consult with host governments with respect to this request."&lt;ref name="Australian06"/&gt; Hrafnsson later explained to ''[[The Times]]'' that the list itself "had been made available to 2.5 million people including military personnel and private contractors by the U.S. government". He went on to say: "in terms of security issues, while this cable details the strategic importance of assets across the world, it does not give any information as to their exact locations, security measures, vulnerabilities or any similar factors, though it does reveal the U.S. asked its diplomats to report back on these matters."&lt;ref name="MSNBC" /&gt;

====United States====
US State Department spokesman [[P.J. Crowley]] denounced the disclosure saying it "gives a group like al-Qaeda a targeting list."&lt;ref name="CNN07"/&gt; Anthony Cordesman, a 'national security analyst for the Center for Strategic and International Studies', said: "this has given a global map â a menu, if not a recipe book â to every extremist group in the world. To me it would be amazing to see how WikiLeaks could rationalize this." However, Alistair Millar, 'director of the [[Center on Global Counterterrorism Cooperation]]', said: "it's a little different...than with diplomatic cable leaks...in this case, this is largely information available to everyone if they really wanted to look."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=WikiLeaks list of 'critical' sites: Is it a 'menu for terrorists'? |author=Mark Clayton |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Foreign-Policy/2010/1206/WikiLeaks-list-of-critical-sites-Is-it-a-menu-for-terrorists |newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date=6 December 2010 |accessdate=8 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Janet Napolitano]], the [[Secretary of Homeland Security]], said the list "could jeopardize our national security".&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. denounces WikiLeaks' release of list of crucial overseas facilities |author=Andrew Zajac |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-wiki-terror-targets-20101207,0,3105543.story |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=7 December 2010 |accessdate=8 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nations other than the United States====
A spokesman for British prime minister [[David Cameron]] said: "The leaks and their publication are damaging to national security in the United States, Britain and elsewhere. It is vital that governments are able to operate on the basis of confidentiality of information."&lt;ref name="MSNBC" /&gt;

[[Vic Toews]], the [[Minister of Public Safety (Canada)|Public Safety Minister]] of Canada, seemed "unconcerned or unaware" of the release of the list. He said: "I don't follow gossip very much so I don't really know the impact of WikiLeaks, but I can assure you that the security agencies in Canada are following it very closely and to the extent that I need to be involved and address those issues, they will brief me on the issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Safety minister not following 'gossip' on WikiLeaks releases |author=Juliet O'Neill |url=https://calgaryherald.com/news/WikiLeaks+releases+Canadian+global+sites+vital/3933777/story.html |newspaper=[[Calgary Herald]] |date=6 December 2010 |accessdate=9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lin Yu-fang]], a politician in Taiwan, stated, in regards to the revealing of the six undersea telecommunications cables in China, there are "actually no secrets concerning the cables", but he said there "could be certain thorny political or military issues involving Taiwan, the U.S. or Japan if more sensitive secrets were exposed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NSB closely monitoring WikiLeaks |url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2010/12/07/282713/NSB-closely.htm |newspaper=[[The China Post]] |date=7 December 2010 |accessdate=8 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====News outlets====
A [[CBS]] article elaborating on the release stated that "although much of the information contained [in the list] was already in the public domain, officials in Washington and London have been quick to condemn WikiLeaks for publishing it, calling the act evidence of the organization's willingness to potentially aid terror groups in its mission to reveal U.S. secrets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=WikiLeaks Reveals U.S. List of Strategic Sites |author=Tucker Reals |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503543_162-20024666-503543.html |newspaper=[[CBS News]] |date=6 December 2010 |accessdate=8 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New York Times]]'' stated that the list "appears largely limited to sites that any would-be terrorist with Internet access and a bit of ingenuity might quickly have identified."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Leaked Cable Lists Sensitive Sites |author=Brian Knowlton |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/07/world/07sites.html?_r=1 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=6 December 2010 |accessdate=8 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Lancashire Evening Post]]'' pointed out in an article that the list "contains information on defence sites in Lancashire which is more than five years out of date." The article specifically pointed out that the "Royal Ordnance (RO) site at Chorley...has been developed as Buckshaw Village for the past five years" and the "BAE facility in Plymouth, Devon...[was] sold as part of a deal three years ago."&lt;ref name="Lancashire"&gt;{{cite news |title=Secret cables on defence sites five years out of date |url=http://www.lep.co.uk/news/lep-business/secret_cables_on_defence_sites_five_years_out_of_date_1_2835957 |newspaper=[[Lancashire Evening Post]] |date=7 December 2010 |accessdate=13 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Companies====
[[Mayne Pharma]] told the ''[[Herald-Sun]]'' that "its entry on a classified diplomatic cable is out-of-date and full of errors", since the drug listed on the cable as its resource, a snake anti-venom, hasn't been made by the company for "more than ten years".&lt;ref name="HS"&gt;{{cite news |title=WikiLeaks terror target list 'out of date' |author=Jane Lee |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/wikileaks-terror-target-list-out-of-date/story-e6frf7l6-1225966960066 |newspaper=[[Herald-Sun]] |date=7 December 2010 |accessdate=8 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger Aston, the chief executive of Mayne Pharma, said: "I can only go on what I can see now in the media (about WikiLeaks) but judging from what I've seen about what they've said about Mayne Pharma and [[F. H. Faulding &amp; Co|Faulding]], a lot of it (the information) is old, out of date stuff that's not relevant."&lt;ref name="HS" /&gt;

Dean Veverka of [[Southern Cross Cable|Southern Cross]] concurred, saying, "(Roger Aston's comments) that the information in the WikiLeaks document was ten years out of date could be accurate. To only list Southern Cross as the only internet cable network here might have been relevant 10 years ago (when only coaxial cables were available), but Australia now has seven cables going out of country. Australia has a very resilient network nowadays."&lt;ref name="HS" /&gt;

Bill Gorman, sales director of [[David Brown Ltd.]], said: "We make gearboxes for our platinum and gold mines. We have supplied equipment via the US for other countries, but have only once exported directly to the States, for a copper mine seven years ago. I have no idea why we're on the list."&lt;ref name="Rand" /&gt;

A [[BAE Systems]] spokeswoman said: "The information in the list was incorrect. The site in Plymouth was sold in 2007, and in Chorley, there are no longer any weapons manufacturing, although there is still an office there. The information about Preston was correct. The safety and security of our people and facilities is of highest priority."&lt;ref name="Channel4" /&gt;

==List of critical foreign dependencies==

=== Sea ports ===
A number of sea ports were listed, including several Chinese ports ([[Shanghai Port]], [[Port of Guangzhou|Guangzhou Port]], [[Port of Hong Kong|Hong Kong Port]], [[Port of Ningbo|Ningbo Port]],&lt;ref name="MSNBC" /&gt; [[Tianjin Port]]&lt;ref name="CNA" /&gt;) as well as one Taiwanese port ([[Port of Kaohsiung|Kaohsiung Port]]&lt;ref name="CNA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Apple" /&gt;) and several European ports ([[Port of Antwerp]],&lt;ref name="Knack" /&gt; [[Port of Hamburg]],&lt;ref name="Local" /&gt; [[Port of Rotterdam|Rotterdam Port]]&lt;ref name="RNW" /&gt;).

'''Filofax''' is a [[company (law)|company]] based in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] that produces a range of well-known [[personal organiser]] wallets. The organisers are traditionally [[leather]] bound and have a six-ring [[loose-leaf]] binder system. The design originated at [[Lefax]], a United States company based in [[Philadelphia]] who exported products into the UK. The company also markets a range of personal leather goods and [[luggage]] under the "Filofax" brand.

[[Image:myfilofax.jpg|thumb|right|Example of a Filofax organiser]]
These organisers are available in over fifteen countries in the following sizes: A4, A5, Slimline, Personal, Pocket, Mini, Compact and Pocket Slimline.

The name originates from an abbreviation of the phrase "file of facts".  This name for the product was first coined when the UK company was founded in 1921. The popularity of the Filofax personal organiser grew enormously during the early 1980s due to its association with [[Yuppie|Yuppie Culture]], where it was regarded as a "must-have" accessory, in the days before [[electronic organiser]]s.

The company was known as Norman &amp; Hill until the mid-1980s when it renamed itself after its most popular product. For much of its life it was based in [[South Woodford]], East London. In the early 1980s it moved to Barkingside, Essex. It was bought by [[David Collischon]]. In the early 1990s it moved its offices back to London and subcontracted its warehouse operation to [[Crick, Northamptonshire|Crick]] in Northamptonshire.

Famous devotees of the Filofax products include [[Patrick Anson, 5th Earl of Lichfield|Lord Lichfield]], [[Diane Keaton]], [[Woody Allen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/08/business/organizing-pays-off-at-filofax.html|title=ORGANIZING PAYS OFF AT FILOFAX|last=Times|first=Steve Lohr, Special To The New York|date=1987-04-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-07-12|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Len Deighton]].

Filofax is part of the UK-based [[Thomas Letts|Letts]] Group.  In 2006, [[Phoenix Equity Partners]] led a secondary buy out of the business.  The deal provided an exit for [[private equity]] firm Dunedin Capital Partners. In 2012 the company was acquired by HSGP Investments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.filofax.co.uk/about-filofax&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1960 - 1979)===
Gary Hart started out as a wrestler in 1960 in Chicago at the Marigold Arena.&lt;ref name="WWE article"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/garyhartdead|title=Legendary manager Gary Hart passes away|date=2008-03-17|accessdate=2008-03-17|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; His uncle, Billy Gates, was a booking agent for Chicago promoter [[Fred Kohler]]. After Chicago, he worked in Detroit until 1964. He then worked on and off in Australia under [[Jim Barnett (wrestling)|Jim Barnett]] until 1974 when he relocated with Barnett to Atlanta becoming involved in [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]]. After Georgia, he worked in Florida in 1975 managing Pak Song Nam.

On February 20, 1975, Hart and wrestlers [[Austin Idol]] and [[Bobby Shane]] were passengers on a [[Cessna 182]] flown by wrestler Buddy Colt, which crashed into [[Tampa Bay]] in [[Florida]], killing Shane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://planecrashinfo.com/famous1970s.htm planecrashinfo.com Famous People Who Died in Aviation Accidents: 1970s]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s, he became a manager called "Playboy" Gary Hart. During the late 1960s, he managed [[Don Jardine|The Spoiler]], as well as the tag team duo The Spoilers, which consisted of Spoilers #1 (Don Jardine) and #2 (Smasher Sloan). They won several tag team titles in 1968 and 1969 under Hart's guidance.

===World Class Championship Wrestling (1979â1987)===
Hart became the booker for [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW; then known as Big Time Wrestling) in 1976, a position he held until January 1983, then again from 1986-1988. The years between 1982 and 1985 are considered to be the "Golden Years" of the promotion. Hart created the classic feud between the [[Von Erich Family|Von Erichs]] and [[the Fabulous Freebirds]], as well as forming The Stable of H. &amp; H. Ltd in 1982 with Arman Hussian that introduced characters ([[Bugsy McGraw]], [[Bill Irwin (wrestler)|Bill Irwin]], [[Les Thornton|Checkmate]], [[Killer Tim Brooks|Killer Brooks]] and Ten Gu) thought he also managed [[Keiji Mutoh|the Great Muta]], [[One Man Gang|the One Man Gang]] and the Samoan Swat Team. Hart additionally managed talent such as "Gorgeous" Gino Hernandez and [[Chris Adams (wrestler)|Gentleman Chris Adams]]. Along with booking, he also managed [[John Nord|Nord the Barbarian]], [[Abdullah The Butcher]], [[Al Perez]] and [[Robert Swenson|Jeep Swenson]] under the stable "New Age Management".

===Hart in the Georgia and Mid-Atlantic regions of the NWA (1983 - 1988)===
During World Class' golden era, Hart was also a manager in the Georgia and Mid-Atlantic regions of the NWA; joining these two areas exclusively in 1983 shortly after the start of the Freebirds-Von Erichs feud, when he left World Class due to a pay dispute. Hart returned to Texas in the summer of 1984 and following a short hiatus in 1986; stayed with the federation until 1988. Hart was also a promoter and manager in San Antonio for Texas All-Star Wrestling, the successor of [[Joe Blanchard]]'s [[Southwest Championship Wrestling]] (SCW) group.  He also worked for the ICW, first as the heel manager of [[Bruiser Brody]], [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] and [[Mark Lewin]]. During one storyline, Hart had a falling out with Sullivan, after which Lewin attacked Hart with a sleeper hold.

===Jim Crockett Promotions / NWA World Championship Wrestling (1988 - 1990)===
Shortly after the folding of WCCW, Hart continued to manage Al Perez in the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA)'s [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] in 1988, along with [[Larry Zbyszko]]. In 1989, he managed the stable [[J-Tex Corporation]], which included [[Terry Funk]], [[Dick Slater]], [[Buzz Sawyer]], [[The Dragonmaster]], and [[Keiji Mutoh|The Great Muta]]. They feuded primarily with [[Ric Flair]] and [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]], but [[Ole Anderson|Ole]] and [[Arn Anderson]] later teamed up with Flair and Sting to even the sides up (and thus bringing back The Four Horseman briefly). J-Tex disbanded in early 1990.

===Later career (1990 - 1999)===
After leaving WCW, Hart returned to Texas and began a new wrestling promotion in North Dallas, the Texas Wrestling Federation, which showcased many former stars of World Class and those who are competing in the USWA/World Class promotion.

During the 1990s, following the demise of the [[Global Wrestling Federation]], Hart and Chris Adams were involved in many Texas-based wrestling promotions, including an ill-fated attempt to revive World Class (billed as World Class II: The Next Generation) at the [[Dallas Sportatorium]]. Hart retired in 1999, but made a surprise return in [[Major League Wrestling]] (MLW), during the promotion's ''Reloaded Tour'' on January 9â10, 2004. Hart appeared following the main event (on January 9) pitting [[Low Ki]] against [[Homicide (wrestler)|Homicide]], where the three laid out several wrestlers from the locker room, as well MLW president Court Bauer.

==Death==
Hart died on March 16, 2008, following a heart attack at his home in [[Euless, Texas]], after returning from an autograph session in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=oww/&gt; On April 5, 2008, Peach State Pandemonium, an internet wrestling program, aired a two-hour tribute program in the memory of Hart. "Cowboy" [[Bill Watts]], [[Jack Brisco]], James Beard, [[Abdullah The Butcher]], [[Michael Hayes (wrestler)|Michael "P.S." Hayes]], [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]], [[George Steele]], [[Skandor Akbar]], and [[Jim Ross]] were among those who attended. Following his death, his autobiography, ''My Life In Wrestling...With A Little Help From My Friends'', was released on June 30, 2009 but is now out of print.&lt;ref name="PR.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pr.com/press-release/331664|title=Autobiography of Professional Wrestling Manager "Playboy" Gary Hart Released|date=2011-06-15|accessdate=2011-06-15|publisher=PR.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anna Swan with her parents.jpg|thumb|Giantess [[Anna Haining Bates|Anna Haining Bates (nÃ©e Swan)]] with her parents]]
A '''giantess''' is a female [[Giant (disambiguation)|giant]]:&lt;!--ambiguous link intentional--&gt; either a [[Giant (mythology)|mythical being]] resembling a woman of superhuman size and strength or a human woman of exceptional stature, often the result of some medical or genetic abnormality (see [[gigantism]]).

==Polytheism and mythology==
[[File:Tithonos Eos Louvre G438 detail.jpg|thumb|300px|The ''[[Titan (mythology)|Titanide]]'' [[Eos]] pursues the object of her affection, the reluctant [[Tithonos]], on an [[Attica|Attic]] ''[[oinochoe]]'' of the [[Achilles Painter]], ca. 470 BCâ460 BCE ([[MusÃ©e du Louvre|Louvre]])]]

===Greek mythology===
The Titanides, sisters and children of [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]], may not have originally been seen as giants, but later [[Hellenistic]] poets and Latin ones tended to blur Titans and Giants. In a surviving fragment of [[Gnaeus Naevius|Naevius]]' poem on the Punic war, he describes the Gigantes Runcus and Purpureus (Porphyrion):
:''Inerant signa expressa, quo modo [[Titan (mythology)|Titani]]''
:''bicorpores Gigantes, magnique Atlantes''
:''Runcus ac Purpureus filii [[Gaia (mythology)|Terras]]''.
Eduard Fraenkel remarks of these lines, with their highly unusual plural ''Atlantes'', "It does not surprise us to find the names ''Titani'' and ''Gigantes'' employed indiscriminately to denote the same mythological creatures, for we are used to the identification, or confusion, of these two types of monsters which, though not original, had probably become fairly common by the time of Naevius".&lt;ref&gt;Fraenkel, "The Giants in the Poem of Naevius" ''The Journal of Roman Studies'' '''44''' (1954, pp. 14-17) p. 15 and note.&lt;/ref&gt;
Other giantesses in Greek myth include Periboea, the princess of the giants that participated in the Gigantomachy, and the queen and princess of the Laestrygonians who participated in the attacking and devouring of Odysseus' crew.

===Norse mythology===
[[File:Fenja_och_Menja_vid_kvarnen_Grotte_(xylograph).JPG|thumb|right|Slave giantesses [[Fenja and Menja]] plot revenge against their selfish owner, King [[FrÃ³Ã°i]]]]

====Grid====
[[Grid (Jotun)|Grid]] was a giantess who saved [[Thor]]'s life. She was aware of [[Loki]]'s plans to get [[Thor]] killed at the hands of the [[JÃ¶tunn|giant]] [[Geirrod]] and sets out to help him by supplying him with a number of magical gifts. These gifts were: a [[girdle of might]], a pair of magical iron gloves, and a [[magical wand]].

====Gerd====
The giantess [[GerÃ°r|Gerd]] was very beautiful and her brilliant, naked arms illuminated air and sea. [[Freyr]] fell in love at first sight and the account of her wooing is given in the poem [[SkirnismÃ¡l]]. She never wanted to marry Freyr, and refused his proposals (delivered through [[Skirnir]], his messenger) even after he brought her eleven [[Golden apple#Norse mythology|golden apple]]s and [[Draupnir]]. Skirnir finally threatened to use Freyr's sword to cover the earth in ice and she agreed to marry Freyr. She became the mother of the mythic Swedish king [[FjÃ¶lnir]].

====SkaÃ°i====
[[SkaÃ°i]] journeyed to [[Ãsgard]] to avenge her father [[Ãjazi]], whom the gods had killed. She agreed that she would have that renounced if they allowed her to choose a husband among them and if they succeeded in making her laugh. The gods allowed her to choose a husband, but she had to choose him only from his feet; she choose [[Njord]] because his feet were so beautiful that she thought he was [[Baldr]]. Then [[Loki]] succeeded in making her laugh, so peace was made, and [[Odin]] made two stars from Ãjazi's eyes.

After a while, she and her husband separated, because she loved the mountains ([[Ãrymheimr]]), while he wanted to live near the sea ([[NÃ³atÃºn (mythology)|Noatun]]). The [[Ynglinga saga]] says that later she became wife of Odin, and had many sons by him.

====Hyrrokin====
At [[Baldr]]'s funeral, his burning ship was set to sea by [[Hyrrokin]], a giantess, who came riding on a wolf and gave the ship such a push that fire flashed from the rollers and all the earth shook.

====Thokk====
Upon [[Frigg]]'s entreaties, delivered through the messenger [[Hermod]], [[Hel (goddess)|Hel]] promised to release Baldr from the [[underworld]] if all objects alive and dead would weep for him. And all did, except a giantess, [[Thokk]], who refused to mourn the slain god. And thus Baldr had to remain in the underworld, not to emerge until after [[Ragnarok]], when he and his brother Hod would be reconciled and rule the new Earth together with Thor's sons.

===Hinduism===
Giantesses are fairly common in [[India]]n mythology. The demoness Putana (who attempted to kill the baby [[Krishna]] with poisoned milk from her breasts) is usually drawn as a giantess.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Celtic mythology===
Giantesses are common in the folklore of [[Ireland]] and the [[British Isles]], particularly [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]]. They were often depicted as loving and beautiful people and, in later versions of myths, seemed to resemble [[Vikings]], who had raided the coasts, in appearance.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} A notable giantess in [[Irish mythology]] is [[BÃ©binn]].

==Modern art and literature==

===Books===
In [[Lewis Carroll]]'s story ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', there are several scenes where the heroine Alice grows to giant size by means of eating something (like a cake or a mushroom). Similarly [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s story ''Cosmic Casanova'' describes an astronaut's revulsion at discovering that an extraterrestrial female he adored on a video screen is in fact thirty feet tall.

===Comics===
Size-changing heroines have appeared in such comics as ''[[Doom Patrol]]'', ''[[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]]'', ''[[Marvel Adventures]] [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'', ''[[Team Youngblood]]'', and ''[[Femforce]]''. In the latter series, the giantess-superheroines [[Tara Fremont|Tara]] and [[Garganta]] combine immense size and strength with beauty and femininity, and have a cult following among both men and women. Conversely, size-changing villainesses, such as [[Wonder Woman]] foe [[Giganta]], use their strength and beauty for less altruistic purposes as a weapon to crush their foes.  Giantesses are also common in the [[manga]] and [[anime]] mediums of [[Japan]]. [[She-Hulk]]'s nickname is "The Jade Giantess", due to the main character growing in size and more powerful when becoming She-Hulk.

The giantess also appears in modern-day art, illustration and fashion. UK based illustrator Emma Melton has used the giantess as a symbol in her illustrated fashion line 'Blessed by a Giantess', which aims to promote healthy body image in young girls and spread the message that 'We are all beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wix.com/blessedbyagiantess/shop|title=Blessed by a Giantess}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motion pictures===
[[File:Attackofthe50ftwoman.jpg|thumb|Poster of Attack of the 50 Foot Woman]]
The giantess theme has also appeared in motion pictures, often as a metaphor for female empowerment or played for [[absurd humor]]. The 1958 [[B-movie]] ''[[Attack of the 50 Foot Woman]]'' formed part of a series of size-changing films of the era which also included ''[[The Incredible Shrinking Man]]'', ''[[The 30 Foot Bride of Candy Rock]]'', and ''[[Village of the Giants]]''. The 1993 remake of ''[[Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman (1993 film)|Attack of the 50 Foot Woman]]'', starring [[Daryl Hannah]] in the title role, was advertised as a comedy; many scenes did parody earlier size-changing movies (most notably ''[[The Amazing Colossal Man]])'', although the central theme was [[feminist]]. The heroine Nancy, formerly a cipher to her domineering father and husband, is empowered by her new-found size and starts to take control of her destiny, and encourages other women to do the same. Both versions of the movie enjoy a cult following.

More recent movies with giantess themes are ''[[Honey, I Blew Up the Kid]]'' (1992), ''[[MalÃ¨na]]'' (2000), ''[[Dude, Where's My Car?]]'' (2000), ''[[Hable con ella]]'' a.k.a. ''[[Talk to Her]]'' (2002), ''[[Ella Enchanted (film)|Ella Enchanted]]'' (2004), ''[[The Ant Bully]] (2006), ''[[Monsters vs. Aliens]]'' (2009) and ''[[Attack of the 50 Foot Cheerleader|Roger Corman's Attack of the 50 Foot Cheerleader]]'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2098627|title=Attack of the 50ft Cheerleader (2012) - IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[MalÃ¨na]]'', there is a scene where the young [[protagonist]], Renato Amoroso, fantasizes about being a few inches tall and having [[Monica Bellucci]] (Malena), pick him up and take him to her bosom.  In ''[[Honey, I Blew Up the Kid]]'', after Adam grew 112 feet tall and had been wandering through [[Las Vegas]], Diane Szalinski, who was the wife of Wayne Szalinski and mother of Adam, asked her husband to enlarge her so she can hug Adam and prevent Hendrickson from harming her son. As she was exposed to electrical waves, Diane became a 120 foot tall giantess, but later returns to her normal size with her son Adam at her side.

In ''[[Dude, Where's My Car?]]'', five nubile female characters morph into an extraterrestrial 20 foot tall giantess played by [[Jodi Ann Paterson]] (Playboy Playmate of the Year 2000) who picks up one of the characters and eats him. ''[[Talk to Her]]'' features a sequence in the style of early silent cinema called 'The Shrinking Lover,' where an accidentally shrunken scientist is rescued from his mother's clutches by his lover, who carries him home in her handbag. The shrunken scientist then roams his lover's body while she lies in bed. ''[[Monsters vs. Aliens]]'' features a satirization of ''Attack of the 50 Foot Woman'' in which the main protagonist, Susan Murphy, is clobbered by a radioactive meteor that causes her to grow up to 49 feet, 11Â½&amp;nbsp;inches, becoming Ginormica. In [[The Ant Bully (film)|The Ant Bully]], Lucas and the ants escape down the kitchen sink drain, believing that Tiffany is a giantess as she walks into the kitchen with her sandals on her feet and crushing an ant. In ''[[Attack of the 50 Foot Cheerleader|Roger Corman's Attack of the 50 Foot Cheerleader]]'', Cassie Stradford, a college student of Iron Coast University, steals the drug and injects herself with it to make her very pretty. However, the drug had a really big side effect when she starts to grow taller and taller until she is a 50 foot tall giantess. When Brittany discovers this, she tried to seduce Kyle into giving it to her. Even when Kyle was trying to prevent her from knowing, she was accidentally injected with more of the drug than Cassie and growing into a 75 foot tall giantess. After a brief catfight, Cassie injected the antidote into Brittany, making her shrink into a [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]].

Outside of [[Hollywood]], giantesses have also appeared in special interest films. [[AC Comics]] giantess [[Garganta]] is featured in a live action DVD movie available from accomics.com entitled ''Gargantarama'', which also includes giantess scenes from many movies as well as the feature length 1958 B-movie ''[[Attack of the 50 Foot Woman]]''. Embracing the use of the giantess in popular culture, AC has made it a frequently recurring theme in their products.

Giantesses have also appeared in advertisement campaigns, with similar erotic/humorous intent.  In 2003, a commercial for the [[Italy|Italian]] company Puma featured the theme.  The giantess, played by model/actress Valentina Biancospino, stomps around town causing havoc and swallowing a man whole before finally picking up a man (played by Italian footballer [[Gianluigi Buffon]]) and kissing him.  The following year, Lee Dungarees commercials used the giantess theme alongside the slogan "Whatever Happens, Don't Flinch," hiring model Natalia Adarvez to play a 90 foot tall giantess. Also that same year, [[Victoria Silvstedt]] (1997 Playboy Playmate of the Year) posed as a giantess for an advertisement for Max Power London, a car show held in [[London]] in November 2004.  In the February 12th, 2005 edition of the UK newspaper, ''The Sun'', Miss Silvstedt again posed as a giantess of [[Godzilla]] height next to various London landmarks. In a CSL ad, actress [[Claire Forlani]] appeared as a 98 foot tall giantess walking around the city of London and meets a giant, who is the same height as her.

Giantesses have also appeared in some television series such as ''[[Genie in the House]]'', ''[[Snorks]]'', ''[[Schoolhouse Rock]]'', ''[[The Electric Company]]'', ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', ''[[Animaniacs]]'', ''[[Toonsylvania]]'' episode in ''Attack of the Fifty Footed Woman'', ''[[Totally Spies!]]'' episode in ''Attack Of The 50 Ft Mandy'', ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'', and ''[[The 7D]]''. The ''Snorks'' episode "The Littlest Mermaid" features a scene where a mermaid grows into a giantess caused by a machine. The ''Schoolhouse Rock'' episode "Unpack Your Adjectives" includes a scene where a tall girl grows into a 34 foot giantess, causing only her legs and sandals to be seen. She then stomps on a small boy who wouldn't stop laughing at how tall she grew. In the first episode of ''The Electric Company'', [[Judy Graubart]] grows into a giantess while holding up a sign for the kid audience to read that says "giant". In the ''Dexter's Laboratory'' episode "The Big Sister", Dee Dee becomes a 65 foot giantess after eating an experimental cookie. The ''Animaniacs'' character Katie Ka-Boom sometimes grew giant sized before she turned into a monster. In the ''Phineas and Ferb'' episode "Attack of the 50 Foot Sister", [[Candace Flynn]] grows into a giantess after she uses some of Phineas and Ferb's growth potion. In the episode "Pony Tale" of ''[[Genie in the House]]'', Max's niece Louise gets left with the girls, and when she learned of the genie's existence, she made a wish of wanting to get big, in which the genie was forced to accept her command and made her into 55 foot tall giantess for a brief time.

The giantess theme occasionally manifests in [[music video]]s as well, notably [[Pamela Anderson]]'s role as a giantess in the video [[Miserable (song)|Miserable]] for the [[Rock music|rock]] group [[Lit (band)|Lit]]. In the video, the band members perform on Anderson's body and are eventually [[Vorarephilia|devoured]] by her at the end, a metaphor for women as "maneaters".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19887">'''Glottochronology''' (from [[Attic Greek]] Î³Î»á¿¶ÏÏÎ± "tongue, language" and ÏÏÃ³Î½Î¿Ï "time") is the part of [[lexicostatistics]] dealing with the chronological relationship between languages.&lt;ref name=Embleton&gt;Sheila Embleton (1992). HISTORICAL LINGUISTICS: Mathematical concepts. In W. Bright (Ed.), International Encyclopedia of Linguistics&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|131}}

The idea was developed by [[Morris Swadesh]] under two assumptions: that there does, indeed, exist a relatively stable "basic vocabulary" (referred to as "[[Swadesh list]]s") in all languages of the world; and that any replacements happen in a way analogous to [[radioactive decay]], in constant percentages per time elapsed. Meanwhile, there exist many different methods, partly extensions of the Swadesh method, now more and more under the biological assumptions of replacements in genes. However, Swadesh's technique is so well known that, for many people, 'glottochronology' refers to it alone.&lt;ref name=Embleton/&gt;{{rp|133}}&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Hans J. (2007). The new Arboretum of Indo-European 'Trees'; Can new algorithms reveal the Phylogeny and even Prehistory of IE?. Journal of Quantitative Linguistics 14-2:167â214&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==

===Word list===
The original method presumed that the core vocabulary of a language is replaced at a constant (or constant average) rate across all languages and cultures, and can therefore be used to measure the passage of time. The process makes use of a list of lexical terms. Lists were compiled by Morris Swadesh and assumed to be resistant against borrowing (originally designed in 1952 as a list of 200 items; however, the refined 100 word list in Swadesh (1955)&lt;ref name=swadesh1955&gt;Swadesh, Morris. (1955). Towards greater accuracy in lexicostatistic dating. ''International Journal of American Linguistics'', ''21'', 121&amp;ndash;137&lt;/ref&gt; is much more common among modern day linguists). This core vocabulary was designed to encompass concepts common to every human language (such as personal pronouns, body parts, heavenly bodies, verbs of basic actions, numerals 'one' and 'two', etc.), eliminating concepts that are specific to a particular culture or time. It has been found that this ideal is not in fact possible and that the meaning set may need to be tailored to the languages being compared.  Many alternative word lists have been compiled by other linguists, often using fewer meaning slots.

The percentage of [[cognate]]s (words that have a common origin) in these word lists is then measured.  The larger the percentage of cognates, the more recently the two languages being compared are presumed to have separated.

===Glottochronologic constant===
[[Robert Lees (linguist)|Robert Lees]] obtained a value for the "glottochronological constant" ('''r''') of words by considering the known changes in 13 pairs of languages using the 200 word list.  He obtained a value of 0.805&amp;nbsp;Â±&amp;nbsp;0.0176 with 90% confidence.  For the 100 word list Swadesh obtained a value of 0.86, the higher value reflecting the elimination of semantically unstable words.  This constant may be related to the retention rate of words by:-

:&lt;math&gt;L = 2\ln(r) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''L'' is the rate of replacement, ln is the logarithm to base e, and ''r'' is the glottochronological constant

===Divergence time===
The basic formula of glottochronology in its shortest form is:-

: &lt;math&gt;t = \frac{\ln(c)}{-L}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''t'' = a given period of time from one stage of the language to another, ''c'' = proportion of wordlist items retained at the end of that period, and ''L'' = rate of replacement for that word list.

One can also therefore formulate that:

: &lt;math&gt; t = -\frac{\ln(c)}{2\ln(r)}&lt;/math&gt;

By testing historically verifiable cases where we have knowledge of ''t'' through non-linguistic data (e. g. the approximate distance from Classical Latin to modern Romance languages), Swadesh arrived at the empirical value of approximately 0.14 for ''L'' (meaning that the rate of replacement constitutes around 14 words from the 100-wordlist per millennium).

===Results===
Glottochronology was found to work in the case of Indo-European, accounting for 87% of the variance. It is also postulated to work for Hamito-Semitic (Fleming 1973), Chinese (Munro 1978) and Amerind (Stark 1973; Baumhoff and Olmsted 1963). For the latter, correlations have been obtained with radiocarbon dating and blood groups as well as archaeology.
Note that the approach of Gray and Atkinson,&lt;ref&gt;''Language-tree divergence times support the Anatolian theory of Indo-European origin, Russell D. Gray &amp; Quentin D. Atkinson, Nature 426, 435&amp;ndash;439'' 2003&lt;/ref&gt; as they say, has nothing to do with "glottochronology".

==Discussion==
The concept of language change is old, and its history is reviewed in Hymes (1973) and Wells (1973).  Glottochronology itself dates back to the mid-20th century.&lt;ref name=swadesh1955/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swadesh, Morris (1972). What is glottochronology? In M. Swadesh, ''The origin and diversification of languages'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;271â284). London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lees, Robert. (1953). The basis of glottochronology. ''Language'', ''29'' (2), 113&amp;ndash;127.&lt;/ref&gt;  An introduction to the subject is given in Embleton (1986)&lt;ref&gt;Embleton, Sheila M. (1986). ''Statistics in Historical Linguistics'' [Quantitative linguistics, vol. 30]. Bochum: Brockmeyer. {{ISBN|3-88339-537-4}}. &amp;ndash; State of the art up to then.
&lt;/ref&gt; and in McMahon and McMahon (2005).&lt;ref&gt;McMahon, April and McMahon, Robert (2005) ''Language Classification by Numbers.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press (in particular p. 95)&lt;/ref&gt;

Glottochronology has been controversial ever since, partly owing to issues of accuracy, as well as the question of whether its basis is sound (see e.g. Bergsland 1958; Bergsland and Vogt 1962; Fodor 1961; Chretien 1962; Guy 1980).  These concerns have been addressed by Dobson et al. (1972), Dyen (1973)&lt;ref name=dyen1973&gt;Dyen, Isidore, ed. (1973). ''Lexicostatistics in genetic linguistics: Proceedings of the Yale conference, April 3&amp;ndash;4, 1971''. La Haye: Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt; and Kruskal, Dyen and Black (1973).&lt;ref name=kruskal1973&gt;Some Results From the Vocabulary Method of Reconstructing Language Trees, Joseph B. Kruskal, Isidore Dyen and Paul Black, Lexicostatistics in Genetic Linguistics, Isidore Dyen (editor), Mouton, The Hague, 1973, pp. 30-55&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption of a single-word replacement rate can distort the divergence-time estimate when borrowed words are included (Thomason and Kaufman 1988). ChrÃ©tien purported to disprove the mathematics of the Swadesh-model. At a conference at Yale in 1971 his criticisms were shown to be invalid. See the published proceedings under Dyen (1973)&lt;ref name=dyen1973/&gt; The same conference saw the application of the theory to [[Creole language]] (Wittmann 1973).
An overview of recent arguments can be obtained from the papers of a conference held at the McDonald Institute in 2000.&lt;ref name=renfrew2002&gt;Renfrew, C., McMahon, A., &amp; L. Trask, Eds. (2000). Time Depth in Historical LInguistics. Cambridge, England: The McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research.
&lt;/ref&gt; These presentations vary from "Why linguists don't do dates" to the one by [[Sergei Starostin|Starostin]] discussed above.{{clarify|date=November 2011}}
Since its original inception, glottochronology has been rejected by many linguists, mostly Indo-Europeanists of the school of the traditional [[comparative method]]. Criticisms have been answered in particular around three points of discussion.

* Criticism levelled against the higher stability of lexemes in Swadesh lists alone (Haarmann 1990) misses the point, because a certain amount of losses only enables the computations (Sankoff 1970).
* Traditional glottochronology did presume that language changes at a stable rate.
:Thus, in Bergsland &amp; Vogt (1962), the authors make an impressive demonstration, on the basis of actual language data verifiable by extra-linguistic sources, that the "rate of change" for [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] constituted around 4% per millennium, whereas for closely connected [[Riksmal]] (Literary Norwegian) it would amount to as much as 20%. (Swadesh's proposed "constant rate" was supposed to be around 14% per millennium).
:This and several other similar examples effectively proved that Swadesh's formula would not work on all available material&amp;mdash;a serious accusation considering that evidence that can be used to "calibrate" the meaning of ''L'' (i. e. language history recorded during prolonged periods of time) is not overwhelmingly large in the first place.
:It is highly likely that the chance of replacement is in fact different for every word or feature ("each word has its own history", among hundreds of other sources:&lt;ref&gt;Kirk JM, St Anderson, &amp; JDA Widdowson, 1985 Studies in Linguistic Geography: The Dialects of English in Britain and Ireland. London: Croom Helm&lt;/ref&gt;).
:This global assumption has been modified and downgraded to single words even in single languages in many newer attempts (see below).
*A serious argument is that language change arises from socio-historical events which are of course unforeseeable and, therefore, uncomputable.
:New methods developed by Gray &amp; Atkinson are claimed to avoid these issues, but are still seen as controversial, primarily since they often produce results that are incompatible with known data and because of additional methodological issues.

==Modified==

Somewhere in between the original concept of Swadesh and the rejection of glottochronology in its entirety lies the idea that glottochronology as a formal method of linguistic analysis becomes valid with the help of several important modifications.  Thus, inhomogeneities in the replacement rate were dealt with by Van der Merwe (1966)&lt;ref&gt;van der Merwe, N. J. 1966 "New mathematics for glottochronology", Current Anthropology 7: 485&amp;ndash;500&lt;/ref&gt; by splitting the word list into classes each with their own rate, while Dyen, James and Cole (1967)&lt;ref&gt;Dyen, I., James, A. T., &amp; J. W. L. Cole 1967 "Language divergence and estimated word retention rate", &lt;Language 43: 150--171&lt;/ref&gt; allowed each meaning to have its own rate. Simultaneous estimation of divergence time and replacement rate was studied by Kruskal, Dyen and Black.&lt;ref name=kruskal1973/&gt;

Brainard (1970) allowed for chance cognation and drift effects was introduced by Gleason (1959). Sankoff (1973) suggested introducing a borrowing parameter and allowed synonyms.

A combination of these various improvements is given in Sankoff's "Fully Parameterised Lexicostatistics".  In 1972 Sankoff in a biological context developed a model of genetic divergence of populations. Embleton (1981) derives a simplified version of this in a linguistic context. She carries out a number of simulations using this which are shown to give good results.

Improvements in statistical methodology related to a completely different branch of science &amp;ndash; [[Phylogenetics|changes in DNA over time]] &amp;ndash; have sparked a recent renewed interest. These methods are more robust than the earlier ones because they calibrate points on the tree with known historical events and smooth the rates of change across these. As such, they no longer require the assumption of a constant rate of change ([http://language.psy.auckland.ac.nz/publications/index.php?pub=Gray_and_Atkinson2003Nature Gray &amp; Atkinson 2003]).

===Starostin's method===

Another attempt to introduce such modifications was performed by the Russian linguist [[Sergei Starostin]], who had proposed that

* systematic [[loanword]]s, borrowed from one language into another, are a disruptive factor and have to be eliminated from the calculations; the one thing that really matters is the "native" replacement of items by items from the same language. The failure to notice this factor was a major reason in Swadesh's original estimation of the replacement rate at under 14 words from the 100-wordlist per millennium, when the real rate is, in fact, much slower (around 5 or 6). Introducing this correction effectively cancels out the "Bergsland &amp; Vogt" argument, since a thorough analysis of the Riksmal data shows that its basic wordlist includes about 15&amp;ndash;16 borrowings from other Germanic languages (mostly [[Danish language|Danish]]) &amp;ndash; exclusion of these elements from the calculations brings the rate down to the expected rate of 5&amp;ndash;6 "native" replacements per millennium;
* the rate of change is not really constant, but actually depends on the time period during which the word has existed in the language (i. e. chances of lexeme X being replaced by lexeme Y increase in direct proportion to the time elapsed â the so-called "aging of words", empirically understood as gradual "erosion" of the word's primary meaning under the weight of acquired secondary ones);
* individual items on the 100 wordlist have different stability rates (for instance, the word "I" generally has a much lower chance of being replaced than the word "yellow", etc.).

The resulting formula, taking into account both the time dependence and the individual stability quotients, looks as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;t = \sqrt \frac{\ln(c)}{-Lc}&lt;/math&gt;

In this formula, &amp;minus;''Lc'' reflects the gradual slowing down of the replacement process due to different individual rates (the less stable elements are the first and the quickest to be replaced), whereas the square root represents the reverse trend &amp;ndash; acceleration of replacement as items in the original wordlist "age" and become more prone to shifting their meaning. The formula is obviously more complicated than Swadesh's original one, but, as shown in Starostin's work, yields more credible results than the former (and more or less agrees with all the cases of language separation that can be confirmed by historical knowledge). On the other hand, it shows that glottochronology can really only be used as a serious scientific tool on language families the historical phonology of which has been meticulously elaborated (at least to the point of being able to clearly distinguish between cognates and loanwords).

===Time-depth estimation===
The McDonald Institute hosted a conference on the issue of time-depth estimation in 2000.  The published papers&lt;ref name=renfrew2002/&gt; give an idea of the views on glottochronology at that time.  These vary from "Why linguists don't do dates" to the one by Starostin discussed above. Note that in the referenced Gray and Atkinson paper, they hold that their methods can not be called "glottochronology", by confining this term to its original method.

'''Head First''' is a series of introductory [[Education|instructional]] books to many topics, published by [[O'Reilly Media]]. It stresses an unorthodox, visually intensive, reader-involving combination of [[puzzle]]s, [[joke]]s, nonstandard design and layout, and an engaging, conversational style to immerse the reader in a given topic.

Originally, the series covered [[Computer programming|programming]] and [[software engineering]], but is now expanding to other topics in science, mathematics and business, due to success. The series was created by Bert Bates and [[Kathy Sierra]], and began with ''Head First Java'' in 2003.

== Concept ==
The main idea of the series is to effectively stimulate the brain by:
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.headfirstlabs.com/about.php
|title=How Head First Helps You Learn
|accessdate=2008-06-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Telling stories
* Visualizing
* Using attention-grabbing tactics: page layout, non-standard examples, puzzles, jokes, and other means.

By using [[metacognition]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.headfirstlabs.com/readme.php
|title=The Head First Formula
|accessdate=2008-06-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt; the series' authors and editors try to employ varied methods to present information and accelerate the learning process.

== Books ==
The offerings in the Head First series are quickly expanding. The books are also delving into subjects that are not directly related to IT, such as Math (''Head First Algebra'', ''Head First Statistics''), Science (''Head First Physics'') and project management (''Head First PMP'').  The books are also gaining some popularity for classroom use {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} because of their novel approach to their subject matters.

==Etymology==
The term ''HindÄ«'' originally was used to refer to inhabitants of the region east of the [[Indus river|Indus]]. It was borrowed from [[Classical Persian]] ''HindÄ«'' (Iranian Persian ''Hendi''), meaning "Indian", from the proper noun ''Hind'' "India".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steingass|first1=Francis Joseph|title=A comprehensive Persian-English dictionary|date=1892|publisher=Routledge &amp; K.

The name ''HindavÄ«'' was used by [[Amir Khusrow]] in his poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Khan|first1=Rajak|title=Indo-Persian Literature and Amir Khusro|url=http://vle.du.ac.in/mod/book/print.php?id=11660|publisher=[[University of Delhi]]|accessdate=17 February 2018}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{further|History of Hindustani}}
Like other Indo-Aryan languages, Hindi is a direct descendant of an early form of [[Vedic Sanskrit]], through [[Sauraseni Prakrit]] and [[Apabhraá¹Åa|Åauraseni Apabhraá¹Åa]] (from Sanskrit ''apabhraá¹Åa'' "corrupted"), which emerged in the 7th century A.D.&lt;ref name="de"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hindinideshalaya.nic.in/english/hindi_orgin/briefhistory.html|work=Central Hindi Directorate|title=Brief History of Hindi|accessdate=21 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306085510/http://hindinideshalaya.nic.in/english/hindi_orgin/briefhistory.html|archivedate=6 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Standard Hindi is based on the [[Khariboli dialect]],&lt;ref name="de"/&gt; the vernacular of [[Delhi]] and the surrounding region, which came to replace earlier prestige dialects such as [[Awadhi]], [[Maithili language|Maithili]] (sometimes regarded as separate from the Hindi dialect continuum) and [[Braj]]. ''[[Urdu]]'' â another form of Hindustani â acquired [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|linguistic prestige]] in the later [[Mughal Empire|Mughal period]] (1800s), and underwent significant [[Persian language|Persian]] influence. Modern Hindi and its literary tradition evolved towards the end of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lrs.ed.uiuc.edu/students/avatans/hindi.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830102522/http://lrs.ed.uiuc.edu/Students/avatans/hindi.html |archivedate=30 August 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern Hindi's earlier literary stages before standardization can be traced to the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00urduhindilinks/workshop2012/bangha_rekhta.pdf|title=Rekhta: Poetry in Mixed Language, The Emergence of Khari Boli Literature in North India|publisher=[[Columbia University]]|format=PDF|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328003510/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00urduhindilinks/workshop2012/bangha_rekhta.pdf|archivedate=28 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th century, a movement to further develop Hindi as a standardised form of Hindustani separate from Urdu took form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Language_Religion_and_Politics_in_North.html?id=SylBHS8IJAUC|title=Language, Religion and Politics in North India|author=Paul R.

After independence, the government of India instituted the following conventions:{{Original research inline|date=August 2011}}
* standardisation of grammar: In 1954, the Government of India set up a committee to prepare a grammar of Hindi; The committee's report was released in 1958 as ''A Basic Grammar of Modern Hindi''.
* standardisation of the orthography, using the [[Devanagari]] script, by the Central Hindi Directorate of the Ministry of Education and Culture to bring about uniformity in writing, to improve the shape of some Devanagari characters, and introducing diacritics to express sounds from other languages.

On 14 September 1949, the [[Constituent Assembly of India]] adopted Hindi written in the Devanagari script as the [[Official languages of Union govt of India|official language of the Republic of India]] replacing Urdu's previous usage in [[British Raj|British India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ieMgAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|title=Pluricentric Languages: Differing Norms in Different Nations|last=Clyne|first=Michael|date=2012-05-24|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9783110888140|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=QuEmDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|title=The Oxford Handbook of the Indian Constitution|last=Choudhry|first=Sujit|last2=Khosla|first2=Madhav|last3=Mehta|first3=Pratap Bhanu|date=2016-05-12|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=9780191058615|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=2_nryFANsoYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|title=The Sikhs of the Punjab|last=Grewal|first=J.

&lt;blockquote&gt;(1) The official language of the Union shall be Hindi in Devanagari script. The form of numerals to be used for the official purposes of the Union shall be the international form of Indian numerals.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Notwithstanding anything in clause (1), for a period of fifteen years from the commencement of this Constitution, the English language shall continue to be used for all the official purposes of the Union for which it was being used immediately before such commencement: Provided that the President may, during the said period, by order authorize the use of the Hindi language in addition to the English language and of the Devanagari form of numerals in addition to the international form of Indian numerals for any of the official purposes of the Union&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf |title=The Constitution of India |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909230437/http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf |archivedate=9 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[s:Constitution of India/Part XVII|Article 351]] of the [[Indian constitution]] states

&lt;blockquote&gt;It shall be the duty of the Union to promote the spread of the Hindi language, to develop it so that it may serve as a medium of expression for all the elements of the composite culture of India and to secure its enrichment by assimilating without interfering with its genius, the forms, style and expressions used in Hindustani and in the other languages of India specified in the Eighth Schedule, and by drawing, wherever necessary or desirable, for its vocabulary, primarily on Sanskrit and secondarily on other languages.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was envisioned that Hindi would become the sole working language of the Union Government by 1965 (per directives in Article 344 (2) and Article 351),&lt;ref name=eighthschedule&gt;{{cite web|url=http://india.gov.in/govt/documents/hindi/PARTXVII.pdf |title=Rajbhasha |publisher=india.gov.in |language=Hindi, English |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131084820/http://www.india.gov.in/govt/documents/hindi/PARTXVII.pdf |archivedate=31 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with state governments being free to function in the language of their own choice. However, widespread resistance to the imposition of Hindi on non-native speakers, especially in [[South India]] (such as the [[anti-Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu|those in Tamil Nadu]]) led to the passage of the Official Languages Act of 1963, which provided for the continued use of English indefinitely for all official purposes, although the constitutional directive for the Union Government to encourage the spread of Hindi was retained and has strongly influenced its policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rajbhasha.nic.in/en/official-languages-act-1963|title=THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGES ACT, 1963 (AS AMENDED, 1967) (Act No. 19 of 1963)|last=|first=|website=Department of Official Language|publisher=|access-date=9 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216142842/http://www.rajbhasha.nic.in/en/official-languages-act-1963|archivedate=16 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[s:Constitution of India/Part XVII|Article 344 (2b)]]  stipulates that official language commission shall be constituted every ten years to recommend steps for progressive use of Hindi language and imposing restrictions on the use of the English language by the union government. In practice, the official language commissions are constantly endeavouring to promote Hindi but not imposing restrictions on English in official use by the union government.

At the state level, Hindi is the official language of the following Indian states: [[Bihar]], [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Haryana]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Jharkhand]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Mizoram]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Uttarakhand]] and [[West Bengal]].&lt;ref name="langoff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nclm.nic.in/shared/linkimages/NCLM50thReport.pdf |title=Report of the Commissioner for linguistic minorities: 50th report (July 2012 to June 2013) |publisher=Commissioner for Linguistic Minorities, Ministry of Minority Affairs, Government of India |pages= |accessdate=26 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708012438/http://nclm.nic.in/shared/linkimages/NCLM50thReport.pdf |archivedate= 8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Indiatoday:1&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/pti-feed/story/kamtapuri-rajbanshi-make-it-to-list-of-official-languages-in-1179890-2018-02-28 |title=Kamtapuri, Rajbanshi make it to list of official languages in |last=Roy |first=Anirban |date=28 February 2018 |publisher=[[India Today]] |accessdate=31 March 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330143710/https://www.indiatoday.in/pti-feed/story/kamtapuri-rajbanshi-make-it-to-list-of-official-languages-in-1179890-2018-02-28 |archivedate=30 March 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each may also designate a "co-official language"; in Uttar Pradesh, for instance, depending on the political formation in power, this language is generally [[Urdu]]. Similarly, Hindi is accorded the status of official language in the following [[Union Territories]]: [[Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands]], [[Chandigarh]], [[Dadra &amp; Nagar Haveli]], [[Daman &amp; Diu]], [[National Capital Territory]].

National language status for Hindi is a long-debated theme. In 2010, the [[Gujarat High Court]] clarified that Hindi is not the national language of India because the constitution does not mention it as such.&lt;ref name="National TOI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="National PTI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hindi-not-a-national-language-court/article94695.ece|title=Gujarat High Court order|last=|first=|date=2010-01-25|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704084339/http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hindi-not-a-national-language-court/article94695.ece|archivedate=4 July 2014|df=dmy-all|newspaper=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindi is also spoken by a large population of [[Madheshi]]s (people having roots in north-India but have migrated to Nepal over hundreds of years) of [[Nepal]]. Hindi is quite easy to understand for some [[Pakistan]]is, who speak Urdu, which, like Hindi, is part of Hindustani. Apart from this, Hindi is spoken by the large [[Indian diaspora]] which hails from, or has its origin from the "Hindi Belt" of India. A substantially large North Indian diaspora lives in countries like the [[United States of America]], the United Kingdom, the [[United Arab Emirates]], Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, South Africa, Fiji and [[Mauritius]], where it is natively spoken at home and among their own Hindustani-speaking communities. Outside India, Hindi speakers are 8 million in [[Nepal]]; 863,077 in [[United States|United States of America]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hindi-most-spoken-indian-language-in-us-telugu-speakers-up-86-in-8-years/articleshow/65893224.cms|title=Hindi most spoken Indian language in US, Telugu speakers up 86% in 8 years}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/country/us|title=United States- Languages|work=Ethnologue|accessdate=17 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211075837/https://www.ethnologue.com/country/us|archivedate=11 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 450,170 in Mauritius; 380,000 in Fiji;&lt;ref name="ethnologue.com"/&gt; 250,292 in South Africa; 150,000 in Suriname;&lt;ref name="bookcitation"&gt;Frawley, p. 481&lt;/ref&gt; 100,000 in [[Uganda]]; 45,800 in United Kingdom;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/country/GB|title=United Kingdom- Languages|work=Ethnologue|accessdate=17 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201044623/https://www.ethnologue.com/country/GB|archivedate=1 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 20,000 in [[New Zealand]]; 20,000 in [[Germany]]; 16,000 in Trinidad and Tobago;&lt;ref name="bookcitation"/&gt; 3,000 in [[Singapore]].

== Comparison with Modern Standard Urdu ==
{{Main|HindiâUrdu controversy|Hindustani phonology|Hindustani grammar}}
[[Linguistics|Linguistically]], Hindi and Urdu are two registers of the same language and are mutually intelligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scroll.in/article/809102/the-death-of-urdu-in-india-is-greatly-exaggerated-the-language-is-actually-thriving|title=Hindi and Urdu are classified as literary registers of the same language|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602104222/http://scroll.in/article/809102/the-death-of-urdu-in-india-is-greatly-exaggerated-the-language-is-actually-thriving|archivedate=2 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindi is written in the Devanagari script and uses more [[Sanskrit]] words, whereas Urdu is written in the [[Perso-Arabic]] script and uses more Arabic and Persian words. Hindi is the most commonly used official language in India. Urdu is the [[Languages of Pakistan#National language: Urdu|national language]] and ''lingua franca'' of Pakistan and is one of 22 official languages of India.

The splitting of Hindi and Urdu into separate languages is largely motivated by politics, namely the [[Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts|Indo-Pakistani rivalry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sin|first1=Sarah J.|title=Bilingualism in Schools and Society: Language, Identity, and Policy, Second Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0pouDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT60#v=onepage&amp;q=hindi%20urdu%20mutually%20intelligible|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=17 February 2018|date=2017|isbn=9781315535555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Script==
{{Main|Devanagari script}}
Hindi is written in the Devanagari script, an [[abugida]]. Devanagari consists of 11 [[Devanagari script#Vowels|vowels]] and 33 [[Devanagari script#consonants|consonants]] and is written from left to right. Unlike for Sanskrit, Devanagari is not entirely phonetic for Hindi, especially failing to mark [[Schwa deletion in Indo-Aryan languages|schwa dropping]] in spoken Standard Hindi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bhatia|first1=Tej K.|title=A History of the Hindi Grammatical Tradition: Hindi-Hindustani Grammar, Grammarians, History and Problems|date=1987|publisher=Brill|isbn=9789004079243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romanization===
{{main|Devanagari transliteration}}
The [[Government of India]] uses [[Hunterian transliteration]] as its official system of writing Hindi in the Latin script. Various other systems also exist, such as [[IAST]], [[ITRANS]] and [[ISO 15919]].

==Vocabulary==
{{further|Hindustani etymology|List of Sanskrit and Persian roots in Hindi}}
Traditionally, Hindi words are divided into five principal categories according to their etymology:

* '''[[Tatsama|Tatsam]]''' (à¤¤à¤¤à¥à¤¸à¤® "same as that") words: These are words which are spelled the same in Hindi as in Sanskrit (except for the absence of final case inflections).&lt;ref name="sirysq"&gt;Masica, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; They include words inherited from Sanskrit via [[Prakrit]] which have survived without modification (e.g. Hindi à¤¨à¤¾à¤® ''nÄm'' / Sanskrit à¤¨à¤¾à¤® ''nÄma'', "name"; Hindi à¤à¤°à¥à¤® ''karm'' / Sanskrit à¤à¤°à¥à¤® ''karma'', "deed, action; [[karma]]"),&lt;ref&gt;Masica, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; as well as forms borrowed directly from Sanskrit in more modern times (e.g. à¤ªà¥à¤°à¤¾à¤°à¥à¤¥à¤¨à¤¾ ''prÄrthanÄ'', "prayer").&lt;ref&gt;Masica, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Pronunciation, however, conforms to Hindi norms and may differ from that of classical Sanskrit. Amongst nouns, the ''tatsam'' word could be the Sanskrit non-inflected word-stem, or it could be the nominative singular form in the Sanskrit nominal declension.
* '''Ardhatatsam''' (à¤à¤°à¥à¤§à¤¤à¤¤à¥à¤¸à¤® "semi-tatsama") words: Such words are typically earlier loanwords from Sanskrit which have undergone sound changes subsequent to being borrowed. (e.g. Hindi à¤¸à¥à¤°à¤ ''sÅ«raj'' from Sanskrit à¤¸à¥à¤°à¥à¤¯ ''surya'')
* '''[[Tadbhava|Tadbhav]]''' (à¤¤à¤¦à¥à¤­à¤µ "born of that") words: These are native Hindi words derived from Sanskrit after undergoing phonological rules (e.g. Sanskrit à¤à¤°à¥à¤® ''karma'', "deed" becomes [[Sauraseni Prakrit]] à¤à¤®à¥à¤® ''kamma'', and eventually Hindi à¤à¤¾à¤® ''kÄm'', "work") and are spelled differently from Sanskrit.&lt;ref name = "sirysq"/&gt;
* '''Deshaj''' (à¤¦à¥à¤¶à¤) words: These are words that were not borrowings but do not derive from attested Indo-Aryan words either. Belonging to this category are [[onomatopoetic]] words or ones borrowed from local non-[[Indo-Aryan languages]].
* '''VideshÄ«''' (à¤µà¤¿à¤¦à¥à¤¶à¥ "foreign") words: These include all [[loanwords]] from non-indigenous languages. The most frequent source languages in this category are [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic]], [[English language|English]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. Examples are à¤à¤®à¥à¤à¥ ''kameá¹­Ä«'' from English ''committee'' and à¤¸à¤¾à¤¬à¥à¤¨ ''sÄbun'' "soap" from Arabic.

Hindi also makes extensive use of [[loan translation]] ([[calqueing]]) and occasionally [[phono-semantic matching]] of [[English language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnold|first1=David|last2=Robb|first2=Peter|title=Institutions and Ideologies: A SOAS South Asia Reader|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136102349|page=79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tN0rBgAAQBAJ|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prakrit===
Hindi has naturally inherited a large portion of its vocabulary from [[Shauraseni language|ÅaurasenÄ« PrÄká¹t]], in the form of ''tadbhava'' words. This process usually involves [[compensatory lengthening]] of vowels preceding consonant clusters in Prakrit, e.g. Sanskrit ''tÄ«ká¹£á¹a'' &gt; Prakrit ''tikkha'' &gt; Hindi ''tÄ«khÄ''.

===Sanskrit===
Much of Modern Standard Hindi's vocabulary is borrowed from Sanskrit as ''tatsam'' borrowings, especially in technical and academic fields. The formal Hindi standard, from which much of the Persian, Arabic and English vocabulary has been replaced by [[neologism]]s compounding ''tatsam'' words, is called ''Åuddh Hindi'' (pure Hindi), and is viewed as a more prestigious dialect over other more colloquial forms of Hindi.

Excessive use of ''tatsam'' words sometimes creates problems for native speakers. They may have Sanskrit consonant clusters which do not exist in native Hindi, causing difficulties in pronunciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ohala|first1=Manjari|title=Aspects of Hindi Phonology|date=1983|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers|isbn=9780895816702|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a part of the process of [[Sanskritization]], new words are coined using Sanskrit components to be used as replacements for supposedly foreign vocabulary. Usually these neologisms are [[calque]]s of English words already adopted into spoken Hindi. Some terms such as ''dÅ«rbhÄá¹£'' "telephone", literally "far-speech" and ''dÅ«rdarÅan'' "television", literally "far-sight" have even gained some currency in formal Hindi in the place of the English borrowings ''(á¹­eli)fon'' and ''á¹­Ä«vÄ«''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnold|first1=David|last2=Robb|first2=Peter|title=Institutions and Ideologies: A SOAS South Asia Reader|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136102349|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==

===Literature===
{{Main|Hindi literature}}
Hindi literature is broadly divided into four prominent forms or styles, being ''[[Bhakti]]'' (devotional â [[Kabirdas|Kabir]], [[Raskhan]]); ''Åá¹á¹gÄr'' (beauty â [[Keshav]], [[Bihari (poet)|Bihari]]); ''VÄ«gÄthÄ'' (epic); and ''Ädhunik'' (modern).

Medieval Hindi literature is marked by the influence of [[Bhakti movement]] and the composition of long, epic poems. It was primarily written in other [[Hindi languages|varieties of Hindi]], particularly [[Avadhi]] and [[Braj Bhasha]], but to a degree also in Khariboli, the basis for Modern Standard Hindi. During the [[British Raj]], Hindustani became the prestige dialect.

[[Chandrakanta (novel)|''Chandrakanta'']], written by [[Devaki Nandan Khatri]] in 1888, is considered the first authentic work of prose in modern Hindi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scroll.in/article/756105/stop-outraging-over-marathi-hindi-and-english-chauvinism-is-much-worse-in-india|title=Stop outraging over Marathi â Hindi and English chauvinism is much worse in India|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919230723/http://scroll.in/article/756105/stop-outraging-over-marathi-hindi-and-english-chauvinism-is-much-worse-in-india|archivedate=19 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The person who brought realism in the Hindi prose literature was [[Munshi Premchand]], who is considered as the most revered figure in the world of Hindi fiction and progressive movement. Literary, or ''SÄhityik'', Hindi was popularised by the writings of [[Swami Dayananda Saraswati]], [[Bhartendu Harishchandra]] and others. The rising numbers of newspapers and magazines made Hindustani popular with the educated people.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The ''DvivedÄ« Yug'' ("Age of Dwivedi") in Hindi literature lasted from 1900 to 1918. It is named after [[Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi]], who played a major role in establishing Modern Standard Hindi in poetry and broadening the acceptable subjects of Hindi poetry from the traditional ones of religion and romantic love.

In the 20th century, Hindi literature saw a romantic upsurge. This is known as ''[[Chhayavaad|ChÄyÄvÄd]]'' (''shadow-ism'') and the literary figures belonging to this school are known as ''ChÄyÄvÄdÄ«''. [[Jaishankar Prasad]], [[Suryakant Tripathi 'Nirala']], [[Mahadevi Varma]] and [[Sumitranandan Pant]], are the four major ''ChÄyÄvÄdÄ«'' poets.

''Uttar Ädhunik'' is the post-modernist period of Hindi literature, marked by a questioning of early trends that copied the West as well as the excessive ornamentation of the ''ChÄyÄvÄdÄ«'' movement, and by a return to simple language and natural themes.

===Internet===
The [[Hindi Wikipedia]] was the first Indic-language wiki to reach 100,000 articles. Hindi literature, [[music]], and [[film]] have all been disseminated via the internet. In 2015, Google reported a 94% increase in Hindi-content consumption year-on-year, adding that 21% of users in India prefer content in Hindi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hindi content consumption on internet growing at 94%: Google|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/hindi-content-consumption-on-internet-growing-at-94-google/articleshow/48528347.cms|accessdate=14 February 2018|agency=The Economic Times|date=18 August 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215085102/https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/hindi-content-consumption-on-internet-growing-at-94-google/articleshow/48528347.cms|archivedate=15 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Homo Sapiens Berliner Art''''' is the first episode in a semi-autobiographic series of satirical novels by the German writer [[Albrecht Behmel]].

==Plot Overview==

Struggling artist Albrecht breaks up with his girl-friend and suddenly finds himself alone in a huge and empty apartment in downtown Berlin. A new room mate moves in, overweight Guru Chris, who specializes in self-help courses for stressed managers. He turns out to be broke so the two young men start to work on their finances - with catastrophic results. Inspired by a beautiful girl named Jana Albrecht starts a series of oil paintings but Chris is allergic to paint.
Albrecht, while dog sitting his sisterâs golden retriever Orest misses the birthday of his wealthy uncle George, an octogenarian. When Albrecht visits George to apologize, the uncle, having misplaced his hearing aids, misunderstands and keeps the dog as a gift. Albrecht tries to find another dog for either the uncle or his sister, but fails so he decides to flee the city. 
Meanwhile, more people move into the apartment, sexy Jenny Epstein who never had an uncle (so she adopts George) and young cousin Bernhard, an under-age kleptomaniac who thinks he is a womanizer. On the baltic island of RÃ¼gen Albrecht makes friends with posh Wibke Schmidt, who believes to be a telepath. They return to Berlin when Chris tells them that he has managed to organize a happening for Albrechtâs paintings (during which the paintings are burned). Later uncle George dies. Jenny is devastated. The family suspects her to be a legacy huntress which adds to her grief. Upset by too much clan-diplomacy, Albrecht misses the funeral just like he missed the birthday and has to improvise once again.

== Title and major themes ==
âHomo Sapiens Berliner Artâ is the name of a longdrink based on espresso. The Book is about arty folk in Germanyâs capital during the nineties, the internet bubble and years before the advent of the hipster even though similar phenomena did exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schenkbuchverlag.de/autor/49-Albrecht_Behmel-77-Homo_sapiens_Berliner_Art Publisherâs note on the series]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The novel is satirical in that it exaggerates the shortcomings of the art business, the importance of family ties and failed expectations concerning financial income. It is also mocks Berlinâs notorious night-life and party-scene. 
Most of the place names are fictional, except a bar named after photographer [[Helmut Newton]] and downtown streets like [[Friedrichstrasse]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abebooks.fr/Homo-sapiens-Berliner-Art-Albrecht-Behmel/6703434405/bd abebooks]&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of articles about [[terms of service]] and [[privacy policies]]. These are also called terms of use, and are rules one must agree to, in order to use a service. The articles fall in two main categories: descriptions of terms used for specific companies or products, and descriptions of different kinds of terms in general. Articles on companies vary widely in the amount of detail they give on terms of service. Annotations show what is available in the article on each company, and need to be updated as those articles are improved.

Terms of service are regularly the subject of news articles throughout the English-language press, such as in the US,&lt;ref name="ny14"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/23/upshot/one-third-of-top-websites-restrict-customers-right-to-sue.html |title=One-Third of Top Websites Restrict Customers' Right to Sue |last=Merrill |first=Jeremy B. |date=23 October 2014 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2017-09-11 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ny17"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/technology/uber-greyball-program-evade-authorities.html |title=How Uber Deceives the Authorities Worldwide |last=Isaac |first=Mike |date=3 March 2017 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2017-09-11 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ti12"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://business.time.com/2012/08/28/7-surprising-things-lurking-in-online-terms-of-service-agreements/ |title=7 Surprising Things Lurking in Online 'Terms of Service' Agreements |last=Luckerson |first=Victor |work=Time |access-date=2017-09-11 |language=en-US |issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/story/zoe-quinn-crash-override-book-excerpt/ |title=Book Excerpt: ZoÃ« Quinn on the Problem of Terms of Service |last=Quinn |first=Zoe |date=9 September 2017 |work=WIRED |access-date=2017-09-11 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; UK,&lt;ref name="gu17"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/03/terms-of-service-online-contracts-fine-print |title=Click to agree with what?

In [[Japanese mythology]], the {{nihongo|'''Japanese creation myth'''|å¤©å°éé¢|Tenchikaibyaku|extra=literally "creation of heaven and earth"}}, is the story that describes the legendary birth of the celestial and earthly world, the birth of the first gods and the birth of the [[Japanese archipelago]].

This story is described first-hand at the beginning of the [[Kojiki]], the first book written in Japan (712), and in the [[Nihon Shoki]] (720). Both form the literary basis of Japanese mythology and [[Shinto]]; however, the story differs in some aspects between these works, with the most accepted for the Japanese being the one of the Kojiki.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Story==
At the beginning the universe was immersed in a beaten and shapeless kind of matter (chaos), sunk in silence. Later there were sounds indicating the movement of particles. With this movement, the light and the lightest particles rose but the particles were not as fast as the light and could not go higher. Thus, the light was at the top of the Universe, and below it, the particles formed first the clouds and then Heaven, which was to be called {{nihongo |''[[Takamagahara]]''|é«å¤©å|extra="High Plain of Heaven"}}. The rest of the particles that had not risen formed a huge mass, dense and dark, to be called Earth.&lt;ref name="kojiki-p67-70"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chamberlain|2008|pp=67â70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Takamagahara was formed, the first three gods of Japanese mythology appeared:&lt;ref name="kojiki-p71"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chamberlain|2008|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* {{nihongo|[[Amenominakanushi]]|å¤©ä¹å¾¡ä¸­ä¸»ç¥}}
* {{nihongo|[[Taka-mi-musuhi-no-kami]]|é«å¾¡ç£å·£æ¥ç¥}} and
* {{nihongo|[[Kami-musuhi-no-kami]]|ç¥ç£å·£æ¥ç¥}}.

Subsequently two gods emerged in Takamagahara from an object similar to a reed-shoot:&lt;ref name="kojiki-p71"/&gt;

* {{nihongo|[[Umashi-ashi-kabi-hikoji-no-kami]]|å®æ©å¿é¿æ¯è¨¶åæ¯å¤éç¥}} and
* {{nihongo|[[Ame-no-toko-tachi-no-kami]]|å¤©ä¹å¸¸ç«ç¥}}

These five deities, known as [[Kotoamatsukami]], appeared spontaneously, did not have a definite sex, did not have a partner (''[[hitorigami]]'') and went into hiding after their emergence. These gods are not mentioned in the rest of the mythology.&lt;ref name="kojiki-p71"/&gt;

===Kamiyonanayo===
{{main|Kamiyonanayo}}
Then two other gods arose:&lt;ref name="kojiki-p72"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chamberlain|2008|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* {{nihongo|[[Kunitokotachi|Kuni-no-toko-tachi-no-kami]]|å½ä¹å¸¸ç«ç¥}} and
* {{nihongo|[[Toyo-kumo-no-no-kami]]|è±é²éç¥}}

These gods also emerged spontaneously, did not have a defined sex, did not have a partner, and hid at birth.&lt;ref name="kojiki-p72"/&gt;

Then, five pairs of gods were born (for a total of ten deities), each pair consisting of a male deity and a female deity:&lt;ref name="kojiki-p72"/&gt;

* {{nihongo|[[U-hiji-ni]]|å®æ¯å°éç¥}} and his younger sister (and wife) {{nihongo|[[Su-hiji-ni]]|é æ¯æºéç¥}},
* {{nihongo|[[Tsunu-guhi]]|è§æç¥}} and his younger sister (and wife) {{nihongo|[[Iku-guhi]]|æ´»æç¥}},
* {{nihongo|[[Å-to-no-ji]]|æå¯æè½å°ç¥}} and his younger sister (and wife) {{nihongo|[[Å-to-no-be]]|å¤§æä¹å¼ç¥}},
* {{nihongo|[[Omo-daru]]|æ¼æ¯éæµç¥}} and his younger sister (and wife) {{nihongo|[[Aya-kashiko-ne]]|é¿å¤è¨¶å¿å¤æ³¥ç¥}} and
* {{nihongo|[[Izanagi]]|ä¼éªé£å²ç¥}} and his younger sister (and wife) {{nihongo|[[Izanami]]|ä¼éªé£ç¾ç¥}}

All deities from Kuni-no-koto-tachi to Izanami are collectively called {{nihongo|[[Kamiyonanayo]]|ç¥ä¸ä¸ä»£|extra="Seven Divine Generations"}}.&lt;ref name="kojiki-p72"/&gt;

Following the creation of Heaven and Earth and the appearance of these primordial gods, Izanagi and Izanami went on to create the [[Japanese archipelago]] (''[[Kuniumi]]'') and gave birth to a large number of gods (''[[Kamiumi]]'').&lt;ref name="kojiki-p73-86"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chamberlain|2008|pp=73â86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kalkin House''' was an exhibition building at [[Shelburne Museum]], [[Shelburne, Vermont]]. Designed by [[New Jersey]]-based architect and artist Adam Kalkin, it opened in June 1, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prefab Timeline|url=http://design.walkerart.org/prefab/Main/PrefabTimeline|work=Some Assembly Required: Contemporary Prefabricated Houses|publisher=Walker Art Center|accessdate=19 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705225528/http://design.walkerart.org/prefab/Main/PrefabTimeline|archivedate=5 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bercaw&gt;{{cite news|last=Bercaw|first=Nancy Stearns|title=On Display: Folk Art in Vermont Gets a New Address|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/02/arts/on-display-folk-art-in-vermont-gets-a-new-address.html|accessdate=19 June 2011|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=2 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[prefabricated building]] was made of three trans-oceanic shipping containers housed within a commercially produced metal shell, supplied by Cameron Construction Company, [[Ferrisburgh, Vermont]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collector's House|url=http://www.cameronconstruction.biz/res6.html|work=Cameron Construction|accessdate=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two-story structure also included two glass garage doors and a pair of metal grid balconies. The balcony on the north side of the house projects from the wall, and is thus described by Kalkin as the "male" side of the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kalkin|first=Adam|title=Adam Kalkin's ABC of Container Architecture|url=http://www.aaschool.ac.uk/VIDEO/lecture.php?ID=39|accessdate=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Though the building has never served as a home, it was appointed like one, having two bedrooms each with an associated bathroom, and a central kitchen in the main living space with a sink and refrigerator in the island near the western door.&lt;ref name=Kelley /&gt;  One bedroom was to the south of the main living area on the first floor. The other bedroom was on the second floor on the north end of the house. The south end second floor consisted of a sitting room/office with a half-bath.&lt;ref name="Quik Build"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kalkin|first=Adam|title=Quik build: Adam Kalkin's ABC of Container Architecture|year=2008|publisher=Bibliotheque McLean|location=London|isbn=978-0-9558868-0-5|author2=Will McLean}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When it was first opened to the public in 2001, '''Kalkin House''' was named the '''Collector's House''', envisioned as a 21st-century [[historic house museum]]. In order to tie the contemporary architecture to the rest of Shelburne Museum, interior designer [[Albert Hadley]] was commissioned to outfit the building with folk art from the museum's collection and furniture.&lt;ref name=Bercaw /&gt; That interior remained intact until 2006 when the structure was renamed Kalkin House and converted into a space for temporary exhibitions highlighting contemporary design, without removing the kitchen or bathroom fixtures from the structure.&lt;ref name=Kelley&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelley|first=Kevin|title=Living Room With a View|url=http://www.7dvt.com/2006/living-room-view|accessdate=19 June 2011|newspaper=Seven Days|date=1 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 Kalkin House exhibition, ''Homey and Hip'' consisted of twenty pieces of household furniture on loan from [[Knoll (company)|Knoll]] with the stipulation that visitors could sit on the pieces. The interior was not portrayed as a domestic interior again until 2009 when Queens, New York-based textile artist Richard Saja re-imagined the space with his installation ''The Bright and Shining Light of Irreverence: Richard Saja and the Historically Inaccurate School''.&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;{{cite web|last=Turner|first=Jen|title=How to Catch a Cabin|url=http://www.readymade.com/magazine/article/how_to_catch_a_cabin|work=Ready Made Magazine|accessdate=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The structure was removed from the museum grounds in June 2012 by Engineers Construction (a Vermont-based civil contractor) that intends to reuse the building.

==Architect==
Adam Kalkin (American, born 1963) graduated from [[Vassar College]] in 1984 and later studied at the [[Architectural Association School of Architecture]] in London, England.&lt;ref name=Vassar&gt;{{cite web|last=Buis|first=Micah|title=Containing a Home: Adam Kalkin '84|url=http://vq.vassar.edu/articles/Containing-a-Home|work=Vassar: The Alumnae/i Quarterly|publisher=Vassar College|accessdate=19 June 2011|date=Summer 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded a Young Architects Design Award from Progressive Architecture magazine in 1990. In 2005, his Push Button House was shown at [[Art Basel Miami Beach]], and was re-configured as the Illy CafÃ© at the [[Venice Biennale]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lucchino|first=J|title=Illy Push Button House|url=http://openarchitecturenetwork.org/projects/6405|work=Open Architecture Network|accessdate=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24489">This is a '''list of medical wikis''', collaboratively-editable websites that focus on medical information. Many of the most popular medical [[wiki]]s take the form of [[encyclopedia]]s, with a separate article for each medical term. Some of these websites, such as WikiDoc and Radiopaedia, are editable by anyone, while others, such as Ganfyd, restrict editing access to professionals. The majority of them have content available only in [[English language|English]].

The largest and most popular general encyclopedia, [[Wikipedia]], also hosts a significant amount of [[health information on Wikipedia|health and medical information]].

'''AskDrWiki''' is a [[List of online encyclopedias#Medicine and surgery|medical wiki encyclopedia]] created by [[Cleveland Clinic]] Cardiology Fellows Kenny Civello and Brian Jefferson. The project was started as a response to the lack of free online medical information found in several community hospitals and was created to form a repository of cardiovascular information that could be readily accessed for reference. It was launched in August 2006. The site now holds medical review articles, clinical notes, pearls, and medical images. The wiki allows anyone with a medical background to contribute or edit medical articles, of which there are over 2,000 {{as of|2013|lc=y}}.

The purpose of the site is to provide reliable and easily accessed health information for the medical community including physicians, nurses, and medical students. The information published on the site is not meant to supersede medical training but to serve as a repository of medical review articles to give medical professionals an online source where they can review medical topics. The website is similar to [[Wikipedia]] because it runs on [[MediaWiki]] software allowing users to add and edit articles, but differs in that all users must be credentialed based on their medical training before they are allowed to publish. Its goal is not to compete with Wikipedia regarding consumer health-related topics, but to serve as an expert medical wiki and provide a source of up-to-date medical information for healthcare providers.

In December 2006, AskDrWiki was referenced in a ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' article, "How Web 2.0 is Changing Medicine",&lt;ref name="How Web 2.0 is Changing Medicine"&gt;[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/333/7582/1283?ct "How Web 2.0 is Changing Medicine"]&lt;/ref&gt; as one of the early adopters of using video hosting sites such as [[YouTube]] and [[Google Video]] to host medical videos. It was also discussed in a 2007 ''[[Nature Medicine]]'' article on medical wikis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keim|first=B|title=WikiMedia.|journal=Nature Medicine|date=Mar 2007|volume=13|issue=3|pages=231â3|pmid=17342106|doi=10.1038/nm0307-231}}&lt;/ref&gt; AskDrWiki has been featured in other media including ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cleveland.com/news/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/other/1175158085286060.xml&amp;coll=2 A Wikipedia-style site for Medical Information]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Medical Economics''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memag.com/memag/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=421602 Wiki for Physicians Gains Foothold]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The [[American Medical Association]] News''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2007/05/07/bil20507.htm Physician Wikis:Do-it-Yourself Textbooks]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of February 2015, although still online, the wiki had minimal ongoing contributions, with only 3 edits in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askdrwiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Special:Recentchanges&amp;days=360 Ask Dr Wiki's recent changes page], accessed 2/8/2015, showing only 3 edits in 2014 and none since July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvard Medical School did not have a role in, nor was it responsible for, the content that appeared in the âwikiâ section of Medpedia.

Anyone with medical knowledge was welcome to become part of Medpedia's community. However, to qualify to edit or contribute to the main content, approved editors needed an [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]], [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]], or [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in a [[Biomedical research|biomedical]] field. Others could contribute by writing in suggestions for changes to the site using the "Make a suggestion" link at the top of each page. An approved editor could review and potentially add submitted suggestions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/23/AR2008072300256.html|title=MedPedia Is Wikifying the Medical Search Space|date=2008-07-22|publisher=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=2008-07-28 | first=Calley | last=Nye}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medpedia was composed of three primary components:
# A collaborative encyclopedia (also referred to as the "knowledge base")
# A Network &amp; Directory for health professionals and organizations
# Communities of Interest where medical professionals and non-professionals come together to discuss topics of interest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8056">The '''Master of the Jewel Office''' was a position in the [[Royal Households of the United Kingdom|Royal Households]] of England, the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and the United Kingdom. The office holder was responsible for running the [[Jewel House]], which houses the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|Crown Jewels]]. This role has, at various points in history, been called Master or Treasurer of the Jewel House, Master or Keeper of the Crown Jewels, Master or Keeper of the Regalia, and Keeper of the Jewel House. In 1967, the role was combined with [[Resident Governor of the Tower of London]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes; Sitwell, p. v. ''"It would perhaps be appropriate at this stage to mention that the in 1967 the Jewel House in the Tower and the staff was increased and reorganised. The Officer-in-Charge is now also the Resident Governor - the two posts having been merged under the title of Resident Governor and Keeper of the Jewel House. He is an officer of the Royal Household and is responsible, only as far a custody of the Crown Jewels in the Tower is concerned, to the Lord Chamberlain of the Royal Household, who has had control of the Jewel House since 1782."''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Museum Island''' ({{lang-de|Museumsinsel}}) is the name of the northern half of an island in the [[Spree]] river in the central [[Mitte (locality)|Mitte]] district of [[Berlin]], [[Germany]], the site of the old city of [[CÃ¶lln]]. It is so-called for the complex of internationally significant [[museum]]s, all part of the [[Berlin State Museums]], that occupy the island's northern part:
*The [[Altes Museum]] (Old Museum) named as the ''KÃ¶nigliches Museum'' when it was built on August 3, 1830, until it was renamed in 1841. The museum was completed on the orders of [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]].
*The [[Neues Museum]] (New Museum) finished in 1859 according to plans by [[Friedrich August StÃ¼ler]], a student of Schinkel. Destroyed in [[World War II]], it was rebuilt under the direction of [[David Chipperfield]] for the [[Egyptian Museum of Berlin]] and re-opened in 2009.
*The [[Alte Nationalgalerie]] (Old National Gallery) completed in 1876, also according to designs by [[Friedrich August StÃ¼ler]], to host a collection of 19th-century art donated by banker Joachim H. W. Wagener
*The [[Bode Museum]] on the island's northern tip, opened in 1904 and then called ''Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum''. It exhibits the sculpture collections and late Antique and Byzantine art.
*The [[Pergamon Museum]], constructed in 1930. It contains multiple reconstructed immense and historically significant buildings such as the [[Pergamon Altar]] and the [[Ishtar Gate]] of Babylon.
*The [[Humboldt Forum]] will open in 2019 in the [[Berlin Palace]] opposite the Lustgarten park, and will incorporate the [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin]] and the [[Museum of Asian Art]]; both are successor institutions of the Ancient Prussian Art Chamber, which was also located in the Berlin Palace and which was established in the mid 16th century.

In 1999, the museum complex was added to the [[UNESCO]] list of [[World Heritage Sites]].

==History==
A first exhibition hall was erected in 1797 at the suggestion of the archaeologist [[Aloys Hirt]]. In 1822, Schinkel designed the plans for the Altes Museum to house the royal [[Antikensammlung Berlin|Antikensammlung]], the arrangement of the collection was overseen by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]. The island, originally a residential area, was dedicated to "art and science" by King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]] in 1841. Further extended under succeeding [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] kings, the museum's collections of art and archeology were turned into a public foundation after 1918. They are today maintained by the [[Berlin State Museums]] branch of the [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation]].
[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-12947-0003, Berlin, Bodemuseum, Pergamonmuseum.jpg|thumb|left|Museum Island with Pergamon and Bode Museum, 1951]]
Museum Island further comprises the [[Lustgarten]] park and the [[Berlin Cathedral]]. Between the Bode and Pergamon Museums it is crossed by the [[Berlin Stadtbahn|Stadtbahn]] railway viaduct. The adjacent territory to the south is the site of the former royal and imperial [[Berlin Palace]] and the [[Palace of the Republic (Berlin)|Palace of the Republic]].

The Prussian collections became separated during the Cold War during the division of the city, but were reunited after [[German reunification]], except for some art and artefacts removed after World War II by [[Allies of World War II|Allied troops]].   These include the [[Priam's Treasure]], also called ''the gold of [[Troy]]'', excavated by [[Heinrich Schliemann]] in 1873, then smuggled out of Turkey to Berlin and smuggled out of Germany to Moscow.  Today it is kept at the [[Pushkin Museum]] in [[Moscow]].

As for the city's major museums, it took much of the 1990s for a consensus to emerge that Museum Island's buildings should be restored and modernized, with General Director Wolf-Dieter Dube's cautious plan for their use finally approved in January 1999. Then, six months later, Peter-Klaus Schuster took over and set in motion a far more ambitious program intended to turn Museum Island into a ''Louvre on the Spree''.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Riding (March 12, 2002), [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/12/arts/berlin-banking-its-museums-seeking-new-identity-city-shakes-up-its-art-legacy.html Berlin, Banking on Its Museums; Seeking a New Identity, the City Shakes Up Its Art Legacy] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The federal government pledged $20 million a year through 2010 for projects to enhance Berlin's prestige and [[Unesco]] declaring the island a [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;Desmond Butler (December 2, 2001), [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/02/world/berlin-museum-s-revival-bolsters-german-identity.html Berlin Museum's Revival Bolsters German Identity] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The contents of the museums were decided on as follows: The Pergamon, with the Greek altar that gives it its name, retained much of its collection and was defined as a museum of ancient architecture. The Neues Museum presented archaeological objects as well as Egyptian and Etruscan sculptures, including the renowned bust of [[Queen Nefertiti]]. The Altes Museum, the oldest on the island, displayed Greek and Roman art objects on its first floor and hold exhibitions on its second floor. The Bode Museum's paintings went from Late Byzantine to 1800. And, as now, the Alte Nationalgalerie will cover the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Riding (March 12, 2002), [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/12/arts/berlin-banking-its-museums-seeking-new-identity-city-shakes-up-its-art-legacy.html Berlin, Banking on Its Museums; Seeking a New Identity, the City Shakes Up Its Art Legacy] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Once this process is completed, perhaps by 2020, the GemÃ¤ldegalerieâs painting collection will be transferred to the Bode, and a new annex, and Museum Island will present all art from the ancient civilizations to 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Riding (November 27, 2006), [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/27/arts/design/27bode.html German Museums Move Closer to Reunification] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[James Simon Gallery]], a $94 million visitorsâ center designed by the British architect [[David Chipperfield]], is being built beside the Neues Museum. It will in turn be linked to the Neues, Altes, Pergamon and Bode Museums by an underground passageway decorated with archaeological objects.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Riding (November 27, 2006), [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/27/arts/design/27bode.html German Museums Move Closer to Reunification] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the Museum Island Master Plan is completed, the so-called Archaeological Promenade will connect four of the five museums in the Museum Island. The Promenade will begin at the Old Museum in the south, lead through the New Museum and the Pergamon Museum and end at the Bode Museum, located at the northern tip of the Island. Before World War II, these museums were connected by bridge passages above ground; they were destroyed due to the effects of the war. There have never been plans to rebuild them; instead, the central courts of individual museums will be lowered, which has already been done in the Bode Museum and in the New Museum. They will be connected by subterranean galleries. In a way, this archaeological promenade can be regarded as the sixth museum in the Island, because it is devised not only as a connecting corridor but also as a strung-out exhibition room for interdisciplinary presentations. The Archaeological Promenade may be characterized as a cross-total of the collections that are shown separately (in accordance with cultural regions, epochs, and art genres) in the individual museums of the Island. The Archaeological Promenade will address multi-focus topics that have occupied the human mind irrespective of time and cultural region, be it a question of life after death or issues of beauty and other topics.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Parzinger (December 17, 2015), [http://scfh.ru/en/papers/museum-island-and-humboldt-forum/ Museum Island and Humboldt-Forum: A New Centre for Art and Culture in Berlin] ''[[SCIENCE First Hand]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Museum Island is referenced in the song "On the Museum Island" by folk artist [[Emmy the Great]].

The southern section of the island, south of GertraudenstraÃe, is commonly referred to as [[Fischerinsel]] (Fisher Island) and is the site of a high-rise apartment development built when Mitte was part of [[East Berlin]].

'''''Pee-wee's Big Adventure''''' is a 1985 American [[Adventure film|adventure]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[Tim Burton]] in his full-length film [[List of directorial debuts|directing debut]] and starring [[Paul Reubens]] as [[Pee-wee Herman]] with supporting roles provided by [[Elizabeth Daily]], [[Mark Holton]], [[Diane Salinger]], and Judd Omen. Reubens also co-wrote the script with [[Phil Hartman]] and [[Michael Varhol]]. Described as a "parody" or "farce version" of the 1948 Italian classic ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gj2qbAsmHK4C&amp;pg=PA7|title=Vittorio De Sica: Contemporary Perspectives|first1=Stephen|last1=Snyder|first2=Howard|last2=Curle|date=May 18, 2018|publisher=University of Toronto Press|accessdate=May 18, 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-05-21/entertainment/0005210315_1_pee-wee-herman-tim-burton-bruce-lee|title="Pee-Wee's Big Adventure" (Tim Burton, 1985) at 5:15 p.m... - tribunedigital-chicagotribune|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=May 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the tale of Pee-wee Herman's nationwide search for his stolen [[Cruiser bicycle|bicycle]].

After the success of ''[[The Pee-wee Herman Show]]'', Reubens began writing the script to ''Pee-wee's Big Adventure'' when he was hired by [[Warner Bros.]]. The producers and Reubens hired Burton to direct when they were impressed with his work on ''[[Vincent (1982 film)|Vincent]]'' and ''[[Frankenweenie (1984 film)|Frankenweenie]]''. Filming took place in both [[California]] and [[Texas]].

The film was released on August 9, 1985, grossing over $40 million in North America. It eventually developed into a [[cult film]] and has since accumulated positive feedback. The film was nominated for a [[Young Artist Award]] and spawned two [[sequel]]s, ''[[Big Top Pee-wee]]'' (1988) and ''[[Pee-wee's Big Holiday]]'' (2016). Its financial success, followed by the equally successful ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' in 1988, prompted Warner Bros. to hire Burton as the director for the 1989 film ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]''.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- NOTICE: PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES IN FILM ARTICLES SHOULD BE KEPT BETWEEN 400-700 WORDS. --&gt;
Pee-wee Herman has a heavily accessorized bicycle that he treasures and that his neighbor, Francis Buxton, covets. A bike shop employee, Dottie, has a crush on Pee-wee, but he does not reciprocate it. Pee-wee's bike is stolen while he is shopping at a mall. The police tell Pee-wee that they cannot help him find his bike. Pee-wee thinks Francis took it, and confronts him. Francis' father convinces Pee-wee that Francis did not steal the bike. Pee-wee then offers a $10,000 reward for his bike. Francis, who did indeed pay to have someone steal the bike, is frightened by Pee-wee's relentlessness and then pays to have it sent away. After holding an unsuccessful meeting to locate the bike, Pee-wee angrily rejects Dottie's offers of help. Desperate, he visits "Madam Ruby", a phony psychic. Ruby, inspired by the Al and Moe's Bargain Basement shop across the street, tells Pee-wee that his bike is in the basement of the [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio]]. Pee-wee hitchhikes to Texas, getting rides from a fugitive, Mickey; and from Large Marge, the ghost of a deceased truck driver.

At a truck stop, Pee-wee discovers his wallet is missing and [[debt bondage|pays for his meal by washing dishes]]. He befriends Simone, a waitress who dreams of visiting [[Paris]]. As they watch the sunrise at a dinosaur museum, Pee-wee encourages her to follow her dreams, but Simone tells him about her jealous and large boyfriend, Andy, who disapproves. Andy arrives and tries to attack Pee-wee, who escapes onto a moving train and meets Hobo Jack. Pee-wee eventually arrives at the Alamo, but learns at the end of a guided tour that the building does not have a basement. At a bus station, Pee-wee encounters Simone, who tells him that she and Andy broke up and she is on her way to Paris. She tells Pee-wee not to give up finding his bike. Pee-wee calls Dottie at the bike shop and apologizes for his behavior. Andy spots Pee-wee and resumes his attack. Pee-wee evades Andy at a rodeo by disguising himself as a rodeo bull rider. Forced to ride for real, Pee-wee does well but receives a concussion.

Pee-wee enters a biker bar for one large wine and to make a phone call, but the outlaw motorcycle club threatens to kill him after he accidentally knocks over their motorcycles. Pee-wee makes a last request, dancing to the song "[[Tequila (song)|Tequila]]". His dance wins over the bikers, who give him a motorcycle for his journey. Pee-wee crashes his motorcycle immediately afterwards. Pee-wee wakes up in a hospital and learns from a television news report that his bike is being used as a prop in a movie starring a bratty child named Kevin Morton. Pee-wee sneaks into [[Warner Bros.]] Studios and takes the bike. He is chased by security across the studio lot and through several sets before escaping.

Later, Pee-wee discovers a burning pet shop and rescues the animals. Although the firefighters declare Pee-wee a hero, the police arrest him for his disruption at the studios. Pee-wee meets the president of Warner Bros., Terry Hawthorne, and explains his journey to retrieve the bike. Hawthorne decides to drop the charges and make a special movie about Pee-wee and his bike, which is returned to him.

Later at a [[drive-in theater]], Pee-wee and Dottie attend the premiere of his [[biopic]], an action movie starring [[James Brolin]] as "P.W. Herman" and [[Morgan Fairchild]] as Dottie. The two must retrieve a sport bike called the X-1, which contains an important [[microfilm]] and has been stolen by the Soviets. Pee-wee has a cameo appearance as a hotel bellhop, though his voice has been dubbed. At the drive-in, Pee-wee gives refreshments to all the people he met along his journey. Pee-wee also encounters Francis, who tells reporters that he is Pee-wee's best friend who taught him how to ride. Francis claims to be knowledgeable about Pee-wee's bike, but accidentally catapults himself into the air using one of the bicycle's gadgets. As Pee-wee leaves the drive-in, Dottie asks why he is not staying for the rest of the movie. Pee-wee answers, "I don't have to see it, Dottie. I lived it." He and Dottie then ride off together at the movie screen in silhouette.

==Production==
[[File:Pee-wee Herman's Bicycle.jpg|thumb|One of the prop bicycle used in the movie ''Pee-wee's Big Adventure'' on display at [[Bicycle Heaven]].]]
The success of ''[[The Pee-wee Herman Show]]'' prompted Warner Bros. to hire Paul Reubens to write a script for a full-length Pee-wee Herman film. Reubens' original idea was to do a remake of ''[[Pollyanna#1960 film|Pollyanna]]'' with Pee-wee Herman in the [[Hayley Mills]] role. Reubens claims that ''Pollyanna'' is his favorite film. Halfway through writing the script, Reubens noticed everyone at Warner Brothers had a bike to get around the [[backlot]], and so he requested one of his own. This inspired Reubens to start on a new script.&lt;ref name=audio&gt;Paul Reubens, Tim Burton, [[audio commentary]], 2000, Warner Bros.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Having left [[The Walt Disney Company]] and with ''[[Frankenweenie (1984 film)|Frankenweenie]]'' receiving positive reviews within film studios, Tim Burton was looking for a full-length film to direct. When Reubens and the producers of ''Pee-wee's Big Adventure'' saw Burton's work on ''[[Vincent (1982 film)|Vincent]]'' and ''Frankenweenie'', they decided to hire Burton for their film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Mark Salisbury, Tim Burton |  title = Burton on Burton |pages = 42 |publisher = [[Faber and Faber]] | year =2006| isbn= 0-571-22926-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Burton felt he connected with Reubens' personality and the humor of the ''Pee-wee Herman Show''.&lt;ref&gt;Salisbury, Burton, p.43â4&lt;/ref&gt; After hiring Burton to direct, Reubens, [[Phil Hartman]] and [[Michael Varhol]] reworked the script again.&lt;ref&gt;Salisbury, Burton, p.47&lt;/ref&gt; The team purchased [[Syd Field]]'s ''[[Screenplay (book)|Screenplay]]'' and wrote the script as faithful as to what the book advised. "Itâs a 90-minute film, itâs a 90-page script," Reubens explained. "On page 30 I lose my bike, on page 60 I find it. It's literally exactly what they said to do in the book...There should be like a [[MacGuffin]] kind of a thing, something youâre looking for, and I was like, 'Okay, my bike.'"

To compose the [[film score]], Burton brought in [[Danny Elfman]], who had previously composed the music for ''[[Forbidden Zone]]''.&lt;ref name=Sweeney/&gt; He relished the opportunity to compose an orchestral score rather than a pop score and wanted it to be taken as the work of a composer rather than the dabbling of a pop musician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boingo.org/articles/FanfareArticle.html|title=Fanfare Article|author=|date=|website=www.boingo.org|accessdate=March 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elfman already had the main title theme written before he signed on.&lt;ref&gt;Danny Elfman, audio commentary, 2000, Warner Bros.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Elfman was the lead singer of [[Oingo Boingo]], but the working relationship between Burton and Elfman would overshadow his performing life and continue for most of Burton's films.&lt;ref name=Sweeney&gt;Salisbury, Burton, p.48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;excluding ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'' and ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 [[VarÃ¨se Sarabande]] released an album on record, cassette and compact disc featuring cues from the movie and 1986's ''[[Back to School]]'', also scored by Elfman. While both films had their scores recorded in Hollywood, the album recording was made in London and performed by the National Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by John Coleman. In 2010 many of the original tracks were subsequently released by [[Warner Bros. Records]] as part of ''The Danny Elfman &amp; Tim Burton 25th Anniversary Music Box''.

[[Christopher Null]] gave positive feedback, calling it "Burton's strangest film."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Christopher Null]] |url=http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/reviews/Pee-wees-Big-Adventure |title=Pee-wee's Big Adventure |publisher=FilmCritic.com |date=2005-06-13 |accessdate=2008-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080330032130/http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/reviews/Pee-wees-Big-Adventure |archivedate=March 30, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' compared Paul Reubens to [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Buster Keaton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117793920?refcatid=31 | title = Pee-wee's Big Adventure | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | publisher = [[Reed Business Information]] | date = 1985-01-01 | accessdate = 2008-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' called the film "a one-comic masterpiece" and "a dazzling debut" for Burton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=132257 | title = Pee-wee's Big Adventure | work = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | publisher = Bauer Consumer Media | accessdate = 2008-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephanie Zacharek]] of ''[[Salon.com]]'' explained "Everything about ''Pee-wee's Big Adventure'', from its toy-box colors to its superb, hyper-animated Danny Elfman score to the butch-waxed hairdo and wooden-puppet walk of its star and mastermind is pure pleasure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Zacharek | first = Stephanie | authorlink = Stephanie Zacharek |url = http://www.salon.com/2000/10/10/peewees_big_adventure/ | title = Pee-wee's Big Adventure | date = 10 October 2000 | website = [[Salon.com]] | accessdate = 2013-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burton was offered the opportunity to direct ''[[Big Top Pee-wee]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Salisbury|Burton|2006|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; but had no interest and was already working on his own pet project, ''[[Beetlejuice]]''. Positive reviews of ''Beetlejuice'' and the financial success of ''Pee-wee's Big Adventure'' prompted Warner Bros. to offer Burton the director's helm for ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Burton, ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' audio commentary, 2005, Warner Bros.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] never officially reviewed ''Pee-wee's Big Adventure'' but in 1987 it topped his list of ''Guilty Pleasures'' and he did mention it in his review of ''Big Top Pee-wee'', saying the sequel was not as magical as the first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/big-top-pee-wee-1988|title=Big Top Pee-wee Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (1988) - Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last=Ebert|date=|website=www.rogerebert.com|accessdate=March 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second paragraph of that review contrasted the two films explaining what he liked in ''Big Adventure'' that he didn't like in ''Big Top''. [[Gene Siskel]], however, gave ''Pee-wee's Big Adventure'' a negative review and even called it one of the worst movies of 1985.

[[Warner Home Video]] released ''Pee-wee's Big Adventure'' on DVD in May 2000. The release included [[audio commentary]] by Tim Burton, Paul Reubens and Danny Elfman as well as [[deleted scene]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Pee-wee's Big Adventure (Widescreen) (1985) | url = https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0790749408/imdb-button/ | publisher = [[Amazon.com]] | accessdate = 2008-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born [[dyslexic]], Parker early on developed a passion for dictionaries.&lt;ref name=ft/&gt; He gained undergraduate degrees in mathematics, biology, and economics. He received a Ph.D. in [[business economics]] from the [[Wharton School]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and has [[master's degree]]s in finance and banking from [[Aix-Marseille University]] and [[managerial economics]] from Wharton.
 
He was a senior consultant at EMCI, and an economist for Nathan Associates in [[Washington, D.C.]], before moving to the european graduate business school and research institution [[INSEAD]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insead.edu/facultyresearch/faculty/profiles/pparker/ Parker's INSEAD web page] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204073117/http://www.insead.edu/facultyresearch/faculty/profiles/pparker/ |date=2007-02-04 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

===Books on economics===
As well as co-authoring some technical economic articles, Parker has written six books on national economic development and economic divergence. These insist that consumer utility and consumption functions must be bounded by physical laws, against economic axioms which violate laws of physics such as [[conservation of energy]].{{Clarify|date=February 2012}}
* ''Climatic Effects on Individual, Social and Economic Behavior'', [[Greenwood Press]], 1995
* ''Cross-Cultural Statistical Encyclopedia of the World'', Greenwood Press, 1997. A four-volume encyclopedia, which recasts international national economic statistics of the world into linguistic, religious, and ethnic groups.
* ''Physioeconomics: The Basis for Long-Run Economic Growth''. [[MIT Press]], 2000. This forecasts global economic and demographic trends to the year 2100: he concludes that long-run economic convergence between different cultural groups is unlikely. He provides an explanation of why distance from the [[equator]] matters in economic development. His explanation of the equatorial paradox is based on the following:
*# humans are tropical mammals, most adapted to live in a climate with temperature around {{convert|25|Â°C|Â°F}};
*#as the distance from the equator increases, the angle of the sun is smaller and the average temperature goes down, and one's exposure to natural sunlight diminishes;
*# to survive in places distant from the equator, people had to learn and master how to produce clothes, food, etc., to survive, not for luxury;
*# from this point of view, [[GDP]] is heavily weighted as an indicator of natural misery of the environment one lives in;
*# by mastering methods to survive over centuries humans in the higher latitudes accumulated more knowledge and physical technologies to produce goods;
*# as populations increased, social technologies (institutions, law, etc.) developed as adaptive mechanisms;
*# these social technologies and cultural traits enabled reproduction of social and physical technologies over centuries of increasing cumulative social, cultural, and physical capital.

===Online dictionary===
Parker is also involvedâas entrepreneur publisher and editorâin new media reference work projects. He is the instigator of  '''''Webster's Online Dictionary: The Rosetta Edition''''', a multilingual [[online dictionary]] created in 1999 and using the "[[Websters#The name Webster used by others|Webster's]]" name, now in the [[public domain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Editor â Philip M.

===Automatically generated books===
Most of Parker's automatically generated books target niche markets (the "[[long tail]]" concept). Examples include:

*Books series on medical subjects published by '''Icon Health Publications''' and coauthored with '''James N. Parker'''. ''The Official Patient's Sourcebook'' series deals with classic diseases like [[spinal stenosis]] or [[autoimmune hepatitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Official Patient's Sourcebook on Spinal Stenosis |ISBN =978-0597831942|editor1= James N.

*A series on the future demand for certain products in certain regions in the world, largely consisting of tables and graphs, published by his company Icon Group International, Inc. One book, ''The 2009-2014 World Outlook for 60-milligram Containers of Fromage Frais'', won the 2008 [[Bookseller/Diagram Prize for Oddest Title of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/81144-fromage-frais-wins-odd-title-prize.html|title=Fromage Frais wins odd title prize|work=[[The Bookseller|Thebookseller.com]]|publisher=The Bookseller Media Group|location=London|date=2009-03-27|accessdate=2009-03-27|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5swvh8N8j?url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/81144-fromage-frais-wins-odd-title-prize.html|archivedate=2010-09-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A series on cross-language crossword puzzle books, e.g. ''Webster's English to Italian Crossword Puzzles: Level 1'', and thesauri, e.g. ''Webster's [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] â English Thesaurus Dictionary'' published by Icon Group International, Inc. Some of these titles raised concerns with linguists who claimed inaccuracies and ownership/citation rights in certain languages covered in these volumes. Parker removed the concerned titles from print stating that he had not known that anyone claimed [[intellectual property]] rights over languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gibson|first=Joel|title=Puzzled publisher at a loss for words|work=smh.com.au|publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=2010-08-06|date=2008-12-19|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/puzzled-publisher-at-a-loss-for-words/2008/12/18/1229189804499.html|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rnOOcU5C?url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/puzzled-publisher-at-a-loss-for-words/2008/12/18/1229189804499.html|archivedate=2010-08-07|dead-url=no|df=}} And: {{cite web|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/technology/publisher-at-a-loss-for-words/2008/12/18/1229189864019.html|title=Publisher at a loss for words|publisher=[[Brisbane Times]]|date=2008-12-19|accessdate=2008-12-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219185228/http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/technology/publisher-at-a-loss-for-words/2008/12/18/1229189864019.html|archive-date=2008-12-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A series of [[quotation]] collections subtitled ''Webster's Quotations, Facts and Phrases'', each volume assembling quotations which feature a specific English word. Excerpts are drawn from public domain literary sources and reference works, and from [[Wikipedia]] articles (identified as "WP" after a quotation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ducking: Websterâs Quotations, Facts and Phrases|last=Icon Group International, Inc|publisher=Icon Group International, Inc|isbn=0-546-69470-5 |page=ii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ISES7TX4TE8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PT2#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |accessdate=2009-11-27|date=2008-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The English professor Nicholas Royle noted that ''Veering: Webster's Quotations, Facts and Phrases'' contained quotations unrelated to the word "veering" or using "Veer" only as a [[proper name]]; he described the book as "quite bizarre" and "absurdly expensive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Royle |first=Nicholas |title=Veering: A Theory of Literature |place=Edinburgh |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-7486-3654-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rgvsAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;ots=RXnVQAlfUX&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;f=false |accessdate=2014-10-19 |page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All books are self-published paperbacks. Ninety-five percent of the ordered books are sent out electronically; the rest are [[print on demand]].&lt;ref name=ft/&gt; Parker plans to extend the programs to produce romance novels.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

===Economic-development initiatives===
Beginning in 1998, Parker launched literacy initiatives, based on his consultations with the [[World Bank]], designed to create educational materials for under-served languages. These have included programs which can produce scripts for animated game shows intended to teach English to non-native speakers, some of which are available on [[YouTube]]. Recently he has collaborated with various projects sponsored by the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]]. In one project, Parker worked with [[Plant Resources of Tropical Africa]] (PROTA) by assisting researchers to more quickly synthesize the dispersed information on useful tropical plants. This resulted in the creation of a public access portal covering the biodiversity of plants in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gomba|first=Joash|title=Authoring and editing of articles made simple|work=Prota.co.ke|publisher=[[Plant Resources of Tropical Africa|PROTA: Plant Resources of Tropical Africa]]|accessdate=2011-01-26|year=2010|url=http://www.prota.co.ke/enewsletter/authoring.html|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w16WpWHo?url=http://www.prota.co.ke/enewsletter/bioprospecting.html|archivedate=2011-01-26|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another he is engaged in creating automated rural radio weather programs in collaboration with Farmer Voice Radio.&lt;ref&gt;'[http://www.farmervoice.org/ Introducing Farmer Voice Radio] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705123710/http://www.farmervoice.org/ |date=2011-07-05 }} farmervoice.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar projects are underway with The [[Grameen Foundation]], [[Farm Radio International]], and the [[GSM Association]], generating radio scripts, agricultural call center content, and SMS content platforms in Kenya, Uganda, Malawi, and India, among other developing counties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insead.edu/facultyresearch/faculty/profiles/pparker/ Web Profile â Philip M.

Using a collection of automation programs called "Eve", Parker has applied his techniques within his dictionary project to [[digital poetry]]; he reports posting over 1.3 million poems, aspiring to reach one poem for each word found in the English language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://totopoetry.com/credits/graphtheoreticpoetry.htm An Introduction to "graph theoretic poetry"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601051803/http://totopoetry.com/credits/graphtheoreticpoetry.htm |date=2015-06-01 }}. websters-online-dictionary.org. Icon Group International, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; He refers to these as "graph theoretic poems" since they are generated using [[graph theory]], where "graph" refers to mathematical values that relate words to each other in a semantic web. He has posted in the thesaurus section of his online dictionary the values used in these algorithms. Genres produced include the following: [[acrostic]], butterfly, [[cinquain]], [[diamond poem|diamante]], [[ekphrasis|ekphrastic]], [[Fib (poetry)|fib]] or Fibonacci poetry, [[gnomic poetry]], [[haiku]], [[Kural]], [[limerick (poetry)|limerick]], mirror cinquain, [[Poetry|nonet]], [[octosyllable]], pi, [[quinzaine]], [[Rondelet]], [[sonnet]], [[tanka]], unitoum, [[Waka (poetry)|waka]], simple [[Verse (poetry)|verse]], and [[xenia epigram]]. Genres were created by Parker to allow one genre of poem for each letter of the English alphabet, including [[Yoda]], for Y (poetry using the grammar structure of the famous ''Star Wars'' character), and Zedd for Z (poems shaped like the letter [[Z]]). His poems are didactic in nature, and either define the entry word in question, or highlight its antonyms. He has stated plans to expand these to many languages and is experimenting with other poetic forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://totopoetry.com/poetry/poeticforms.htm "Graph theoretic" Poetic Forms] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601051857/http://totopoetry.com/poetry/poeticforms.htm |date=2015-06-01 }}. websters-online-dictionary.org.

The '''Phoenix memo''' is a letter sent to [[FBI]] headquarters on July 10, 2001 by FBI special agent Kenneth Williams recommending the assembling of a worldwide listing of civil aviation schools.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/941768/The-Phoenix-Memo Phoenix Memo] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328213514/http://www.scribd.com/doc/941768/The-Phoenix-Memo |date=March 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams, then stationed in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], was at the time investigating students at some of these schools for possible [[terrorism|terrorist]] links.

==Content==
According to Williams, the purpose of the memo was to

&lt;blockquote&gt;advise the Bureau and New York of the possibility of a coordinated effort by Osama Bin Laden to send students to the United States to attend civil aviation universities and colleges. Phoenix has observed an inordinate number of individuals of investigative interest who are attending or who have attended civil aviation universities and colleges in the State of Arizona.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The recommendations outlined by Williams were ignored or put aside because of other concerns. The memo was seen by at least a dozen FBI officials, including [[John P. O'Neill]], but it was never passed to acting director [[Thomas J. Pickard]], his successor [[Robert Mueller]], or the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://features.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2011/10/12/fbi-phoenix-memo/ |title=FBI's 'Phoenix' memo unmasked |last=Behar |first=Richard |date=May 22, 2002 |work=Fortune |publisher=CNN |accessdate=11 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125235247/http://features.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2011/10/12/fbi-phoenix-memo/ |archivedate=November 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the existence of the memo was not made known to President [[George W. Bush]] and his senior national security staff until May 2002. Mueller told Congress in a 2002 hearing that failure to act on the memo was due to deficits in the Bureau's analytical capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/21/us/traces-of-terror-the-fbi-memo-ashcroft-learned-of-agent-s-alert-just-after-9-11.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|title=Traces of Terror: The F.B.I.

== Coleen Rowley (2002) ==

The memo became the subject of another communiquÃ© in 2002 when FBI agent [[Coleen Rowley]] took advantage of the federal [[Whistleblower Protection Act]] provisions to inform FBI Director [[Robert Mueller]] that his public statements about lack of "advance knowledge" by the Bureau have no basis in facts. In her memo, Rowley wrote about the alleged suppression of the investigation concerning [[Zacarias Moussaoui]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rowley |first=Coleen |authorlink=Coleen Rowley |date=2002-05-21 |url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101020603/memo.html |title=Coleen Rowley's Memo to FBI Director Robert Mueller: An edited version of the agent's 13-page letter |publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020602115353/http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101020603/memo.html |archivedate=June 2, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analysis ==

[[Bill Gertz]] of ''The Washington Times'' suggests that the lack of attention to the memo is one of several intelligence failures leading to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

'''''PoÃ©tique du cerveau''''' (English: ''Poetics of the Brain'') is a 66-minute 2015 French-German-Israeli French-, Hebrew-, and Italian-language independent underground experimental documentary art film directed by Nurith Aviv.

==Synopsis==
Childhood photos from Nurith Avivâs family album evoke memories and reflections which lead her to encounters with researches in neuroscience. The film, released on DVD by Epicentre Films,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=http://www.epicentrefilms.com/dvd-Poetique-du-cerveau-Nurith|people=Aviv, Nurith|title=PoÃ©tique du cerveau|location=Paris|publisher=Epicentre Films|language=French|accessdate=26 April 2018|format=DVD|oclc=949902028|date=26 April 2016|trans-title=Poetics of the Brain}}&lt;/ref&gt; weaves associative links between Avivâs personal biographical stories and interviews she conducts with neuroscientists about their work. These scientists, including Prof. Dr. Laurent Cohen, Prof. Dr. Yadin Dudai, and Prof. Dr. Vittorio Gallese, discuss topics partly related to Avivâs previous films: memory, bilingualism, reading, mirror-neurons, smell, and traces of experience.

==Reception==
The film, which includes music by Werner Hasler and was financed ''inter alia'' by Les Films dâici, Angoa-Association of International Collective Management of Audiovisual Works, KTO, Conseil rÃ©gional des Pays de la Loire, ZDF, Arte, National Center of Cinematography and the Moving Image, Procirep, Ministry of Culture and Sportâs Israel Film Council, and Yehoshua Rabinovich Foundation for the Arts, Tel Aviv, was screened at Les 3 Luxembourg in 2015 and 2016, at [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in 2015, and at [[Docaviv|DocAviv]], [[Tel Aviv Cinematheque]], Arte, and {{ill| Cinema South International Film Festival|he|×¤×¡×××× ×§××× ××¢ ××¨××}} in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bar-On|first=Yaakov|date=19 December 2016|script-title=he:× ×©××¨×ª ××ª××× ×|trans-title=She Stays in the Picture|url=http://nurithaviv.free.fr/cerveau/article_presse/MAARIV_2016.pdf|language=Hebrew|work=[[Maariv (newspaper)|Maariv]]|location=Tel Aviv-Yafo|access-date=26 April 2018|publisher=Jerusalem Post Groupâs ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]''|pages=10â11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Esterkin|first=Jonathan|script-title=he:×©×¤×ª ××××|trans-title=Language of the Brain|date=15 May 2016|url=http://nurithaviv.free.fr/cerveau/article_presse/maariv1505.jpg|language=Hebrew|work=Maariv|location=Tel Aviv-Yafo|access-date=26 April 2018|publisher=Jerusalem Post Groupâs ''The Jerusalem Post''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hupertz|first=Dr. Heike|script-title=Haben wir uns darÃ¼ber schon mal Gedanken gemacht?|trans-title=Have We Ever Given It Some Thought?|date=13 June 2016|url=https://www.faz.net/dokumentarfilm-poetik-des-gehirns-bei-arte-14283050|language=German|work=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|location=Frankfurt am Main|access-date=26 April 2018|publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung Gesellschaft mit beschrÃ¤nkter Haftung}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Haverkamp|first=Susanne|script-title=Arte-Doku zeigt Neues aus der Gehirnforschung|trans-title=Arte Documentary Presents News Regarding Neuroscience|date=13 June 2016|url=https://www.noz.de/deutschland-welt/medien/artikel/727540/arte-doku-zeigt-neues-aus-der-gehirnforschung|language=German|work=[[Neue OsnabrÃ¼cker Zeitung]]|location=OsnabrÃ¼ck|access-date=26 April 2018|publisher=Neue OsnabrÃ¼cker Zeitung Gesellschaft mit beschrÃ¤nkter Haftung und Compagnie Kommanditgesellschaft}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Riepe|first=Manfred|script-title=Ein filmisches Gedicht|trans-title=A Cinematic Poem|date=24 June 2016|url=https://www.medienkorrespondenz.de/fernsehen/artikel/nurith-aviv-poetik-desnbspgehirns-arte|language=German|work={{ill|Medienkorrespondenz|de}}|location=Bonn|access-date=26 April 2018|publisher=Dreipunktdrei Mediengesellschaft mit beschrÃ¤nkter Haftung}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|script-title=''Poetik des Gehirns''|trans-title=''Poetics of the Brain''|url=https://www.filmdienst.de/film/details/548135/poetik-des-gehirns|language=German|work={{ill|Filmdienst|de}}|location=Bonn|access-date=26 April 2018|publisher=Dreipunktdrei Mediengesellschaft mit beschrÃ¤nkter Haftung}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brant|first=Zohar|script-title=he:×¢× '''×¤×××××§× ×©× ××××'''|trans-title=Of ''Poetics of the Brain''|url=http://sff.sapir.ac.il/2016/csf.sapir.ac.il/indexe031.html|date=5â9 June 2016|language=Hebrew|location=Sderot|access-date=26 April 2018|publisher=[[Sapir Academic College]], School of Audio and Visual Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3264">The '''Revised European Charter on the Participation of Young People in Local and Regional Life''' is an international policy document to promote [[youth participation]] at the local level. Since its adoption by the [[Congress of the Council of Europe]] in 2003 it has achieved wide recognition as a key reference policy document for the [[political participation]] of youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The original charter was drawn up in 1992, but was substantially revised to take into account the rapidly changing political environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Charter has been adopted by many European municipalities who have chosen to set up [[youth councils]].

lending it added political weight. A number of European NGOs, such as the [[European Youth Forum]] actively support the Charter through their activities.
It has been translated into eleven languages, plus a [[plain English]] version and manual entitled âHave your sayâ.

The Charter is divided into three sections. Part one gives local and regional authorities guidelines on how to conduct policies affecting young people; part two provides some tools for furthering the participation of young people; the third part advises on how to provide institutional conditions for the participation of young people.

It is referenced on many youth websites as a major policy instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Royal Succession Bills and Acts''' are pieces of (proposed) legislation to determine the legal line of succession to the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom]].

A [[Succession to the British throne|Succession to the Crown Bill]] is a proposed piece of legislation in the [[United Kingdom]], presented as a [[Private Members Bill]] or [[Bill (law)|Government Bill]], in either the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] or [[House of Lords]], which aims to alter the laws of succession to the UK Monarchy.

[[The Crown]] is a [[corporation sole]] that represents the legal embodiment of [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[Legislature|legislative]], or [[Judiciary|judicial]] governance. It evolved as a separation of the literal crown and property of the [[nation state]] from the person and personal property of the monarch. In this context it should not be confused with any physical crown.

A bill is a proposed law under consideration by a [[legislature]].&lt;ref&gt;;definition of "bill": "A proposed law presented to a legislative body for consideration."&lt;/ref&gt; A bill is not law until passed by the legislature and, in most cases, approved by the [[executive (government)|executive]], [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] and monarch by [[Royal Assent]]. Once a bill is enacted into law it is called an "[[Act of Parliament|act]]" or "[[statutory law|statute]]".

==Background to succession laws==
Numerous Bills and Acts of succession were used to determine heirs and potential heirs to the throne, during the reign of the incumbent monarch, and especially before, during and after the changeovers between the [[House of Tudor|Tudors]], [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]], [[House of Hanover|Hanoverians]], and [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] to the present [[House of Windsor|Windsors]], all of which necessitated changes and amendments to prior succession legislation to accommodate circumstances of the day. Historically and presently, legislation to amend laws of succession generally argue for amendments to several historic acts, adjudged relevant to succession issues of the day. The [[Bill of Rights 1688]] and the [[Coronation Oath Act 1688]], the [[Act of Settlement 1700]], the [[Union with Scotland Act 1706]], the [[Sophia Naturalization Act 1705]] and [[Princess Sophia's Precedence Act 1711]], the [[Royal Marriages Act 1772]], the [[Union with Ireland Act 1800]], the [[Accession Declaration Act 1910]] and the [[Regency Act 1937]]. The 1937 Regency Act came into legislative existence as a consequence of the abdication of King Edward VIII, as such passing succession to his brother Albert Duke of York (King George VI) in 1937, who was succeeded by his daughter [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1952.

==Modern bills and acts of succession==
[[File:Elizabeth II in Berlin 2015.JPG|175px|right|thumb|[[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]]]

===Elizabeth II===
The [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]] is a piece of legislation in the United Kingdom which alters the laws of succession to the British throne.&lt;ref&gt;http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/successiontothecrown.html&lt;/ref&gt; It was published on 13 December 2012 and received [[Royal Assent]] on 25 April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Succession to the Crown Bill, clause 5(4) (as introduced).&lt;/ref&gt; Known as the [[Perth Agreement]], on 28 October 2011, at a [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2011|Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]] held in [[Perth]], [[Western Australia]], heads of government of 16 [[Commonwealth realm]]s, which share [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] as head of state, announced that they would introduce legislation to end the primacy of male children over female in the succession to the Crown.&lt;ref name=bbcgirlsequal&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15492607| title=Girls equal in British throne succession| publisher=BBC| date=28 October 2011| accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Succession to the Crown Bill is to give effect in the United Kingdom to the agreement between heads of government. 

The argument for changing the law on succession can be stated simply: the law as it stands is considered to discriminate against women and [[Catholic]]s. The Government has said that it opposes [[discrimination]] in all forms, including against Catholics. However, numerous attempts to alter the succession to remove such clauses through '''Private Membersâ bills''' have not been successful, and the Government has now brought forward its own legislation on the matter. Consequently, to change the law, the government have sought consent of the fifteen Commonwealth countries that have the Queen as their [[head of state]], under the preamble to the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]]. Amending old legislation fundamental to the British constitution, have raised further questions about the nature of the [[Church of England|established church]] and the Union between [[England]] and [[Scotland]]. &lt;br /&gt;

==Historical bills and acts of succession==

===Henry VIII===
{{Main|Henry VIII of England}}
The First, Second and Third Succession Acts were created to determine successors of Henry VIII, in consequence of his [[Wives of Henry VIII|several wives]]. These circumstances evoked more legislation. In response to his [[English Reformation|excommunication]]; that Henry's ''imperial crown'' had been diminished by "the unreasonable and uncharitable usurpations and exactions" of the Pope, the [[Act of Supremacy]] in 1534 declared that the King was "the only Supreme Head in Earth of the Church of England" and the [[Treasons Act 1534]] made it high treason, [[Capital Punishment|punishable by death]], to refuse to acknowledge the King as such.

||&lt;center&gt;'''[[First Succession Act|The First Act of Succession (1534)]]''' &lt;ref&gt;25 HENRY VIII, CAP. 22.[Transcr. Statutes of the Realm, iii. 471.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 March 1534, Parliament passed this Act, to vest the succession of the English Crown in the children of King Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. This effectively set [[Elizabeth I|Princess Elizabeth]] (later Elizabeth I) first in line for the throne, declaring [[Mary I of England|Princess Mary]] (later Mary I) a bastard. It was also proclaimed that if commanded, subjects were to swear an oath to recognizing this Act as well as the King's supremacy. People who refused to take the oath, including [[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]], were charged with treason.&lt;ref&gt;Jokinen, Anniina. âThe Act of Succession, 1534.â Luminarium. 11 June 2002. [Date accessed: 18 January 2013].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;http://www.luminarium.org/encyclopedia/firstsuccession.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{-}}

'''[[Second Succession Act|The Second Act of Succession (1536)]]'''&lt;br /&gt;Succession to the Crown: Marriage Act 1536.&lt;ref&gt;[[28 Henry VIII]] c.7'')&lt;/ref&gt;

The Second Succession Act of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII's]] reign was passed in June 1536, removing both [[Mary I of England|Mary]] and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] from the line of the succession. This Act followed the execution of [[Anne Boleyn]], and superseded the [[First Succession Act]]. This new Act now declared Elizabeth to be a bastard also. As a result, Henry was left without any legitimate child to inherit the throne until his son [[Edward VI of England|Prince Edward]] was born in October 1537.

{{-}}

'''[[Third Succession Act|The Third Act of Succession (1544)]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;35 HENRY VIII, CAP. 1. 3 S. R. 955. Act Fixing the Succession&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1543, Parliament passed the third Act of Succession. This act overrode the first Act of 1534, and the second Act of 1536. This third act, which gained Royal Assent at the close of Parliament in February 1544, established the new line of succession from his marriage to [[Jane Seymour]] as; [[Edward VI of England|Prince Edward]] (later Edward VI), then any children he were to have; then a son Henry VIII might have with [[Katherine Parr]]; that potential son's possible children; then children from marriages after Queen Katherine, if any; then Mary; Mary's children, if any; then Elizabeth.&lt;ref&gt;Jokinen, Anniina. âThe Third Act of Succession, 1544.â Luminarium. 16 June 2011. [Date accessed: 18 January 2013]. &lt;http://www.luminarium.org/encyclopedia/thirdsuccession.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===William and Mary===
[[File:William_II,_Prince_of_Orange_and_Mary_Henrietta_Stuart,_by_Gerard_van_Honthorst.jpg|160px|right|thumb|[[Mary II of England|Mary II]] and [[William III of England|William III]]]]
{{Main|Bill of Rights 1688}}

Historical precedence of prior succession acts usually determines later succession issues. There are several events in the history of royal successions showing why succession acts were necessary at the time of their creation. The [[Bill of Rights 1688]] &lt;ref&gt;Bill of Rights, 1689. Parliamentary Archives HL/PO/PU/1/1688/1W&lt;/ref&gt; came about as a consequence of the circumstances after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration of the Monarchy]] in 1660, and the successions of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]], who became regents in return for accepting this Bill of Rights, and a new [[Coronation Oath Act 1688]], from the [[Convention Parliament (England)|Convention Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;1688 c. 6 (Regnal. 1_Will_and_Mar)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bill of Rights limited royal power and established the [[Crown and Parliament Recognition Act 1689|supremacy of Parliament]]. This rights bill also established the frequency of parliaments, freedom of speech in parliament, debates or proceedings not to be questioned out of parliament. This Bill also especially established that; "without parliamentary consent the king could not"; suspend or create laws, raise taxes by prerogative, or raise a standing army in peace time.

The Oath Act reiterated precedent that "By the Law and Ancient Usage of this Realm" monarchs of England took a solemn [[coronation]] oath to maintain the statute laws and customs of the country and of its inhabitants. This established a new coronation oath to be taken by future monarchs. This oath was different from the traditional coronation oath which recognized laws as being the grant of the King, whereas the Act's new oath sought the King to rule according to the law agreed in parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Tim ''Revolution: The Great Crisis of the British Monarchy 1685 - 1720'' Allen Lane (2006) p349&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edward VIII===
{{Main|Abdication Crisis of Edward VIII}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-13538, Edward Herzog von Windsor.jpg|thumb|upright|left|King Edward VIII]]
[[His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936]] (1 Edw. 8 &amp; 1 Geo. 6 c. 3), was the [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] that recognized and ratified the abdication of [[Edward VIII|King Edward VIII]] from the throne of the United Kingdom and the [[dominion]]s of the British Commonwealth, and passed succession to his brother Prince Albert, Duke of York (who became [[George VI|King George VI]]). The Act also excluded any possible future descendants of Edward from the line of succession. [[Edward VIII]] [[Abdication|abdicated]] in order to marry his lover, [[Wallis Simpson]], after facing opposition from the governments of the United Kingdom and the British dominions. Although Edward VIII had signed a declaration of abdication the previous day (10 December 1936), he was still King until he gave [[royal assent]] to this Act, which occurred on 11 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{UK-LEG|path=ukpga/Edw8and1Geo6/1/3/introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act was passed through the Houses of Parliament in one day, with no amendments.

The '''Senate of the Republic''', ({{lang-es|Senado de la RepÃºblica}}) constitutionally '''Chamber of Senators of the Honorable Congress of the Union''' ({{lang-es|CÃ¡mara de Senadores del H. Congreso de la UniÃ³n}}), is the upper house of [[Mexico]]'s [[bicameral]] [[Congress of Mexico|Congress]].

After a series of reforms during the 1990s, it is now made up of 128 senators:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=CÃ¡mara de senadores|url=http://siceef.ine.mx/camsenadores.html|publisher=IFE}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Two for each of the 32 [[States of Mexico|states]]{{efn|name=cmx}} ''elected'' under the principle of relative majority;
*One for each of the 32 states{{efn|name=cmx}} ''assigned'' under the principle of first minority (i.e. awarded to the party who had won the second highest number of votes within the state or Federal District);
*Thirty-two national senators-at-large, divided among the parties in proportion to their share of the national vote.

In a senatorial race, each party nominates two candidates who run and are elected ''together'' by direct vote. The party of the two candidates that won the second highest vote within the state or the Federal District then assigns a senator to occupy the third seat (first minority seat), according to the list of candidates that the party registered with the [[Federal Electoral Institute]] (IFE).

Senators serve six-year terms, running concurrently with the [[President of Mexico]]. Special elections are rare, as substitutes are chosen at every election.

Until 2018, the Senate was completely renewed every six years since senators are barred from immediate reelection. As of 2018, Senators can now serve a second term.

==Term==
In [[Spanish language|Spanish]], it is conventional to refer to each [[Legislature]] of the Senate by the [[Roman numeral]] of its term.

The current session (whose term lasts from 2018 to 2021) is known as the '''LXIV Legislatura''' (''64th Legislature'').

Senators are elected to serve during two legislatures of the [[Mexican Chamber of Deputies]]. Thus, current senators (who were elected in the [[Mexican general election, 2018|general election]] of July 1, 2018) will serve during the '''64th''' and '''65th Legislatures''' of the Chamber of Deputies.

==Election of senators==

===Eligibility requirements===
According to the Constitution, senators are the representatives of the nation. To be a senator, for any of the two principles of choice, you must meet the following requirements:&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.juridicas.unam.mx/legislacion/ordenamiento/constitucion-politica-de-los-estados-unidos-mexicanos |title=ConstituciÃ³n PolÃ­tica de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formula of candidates obtaining the highest number of votes is elected complete, becoming the first two senators of the entity; the third Senate seat is awarded to the candidate of First Formula of the political party that won second place of votes or first minority.

There are also 32 senators elected by proportional representation. For this election, each political party registers a list of 32 candidates, and these are allocated by proportional representation according to the number of votes obtained by each political party in the national election.

'''Steve Austin''' (born '''Steven James Anderson''' on December 18, 1964, later '''Steven James Williams'''),&lt;ref name="truth10"&gt;[[#AustinRoss2003|Steve Austin. ''The Stone Cold Truth'']] (pp. 10, 12â13),&lt;/ref&gt; better known by the [[ring name]] "'''Stone Cold'''" '''Steve Austin''', is an American retired [[professional wrestler]], actor, producer, and television host. Austin is currently signed under a Legends contract in the [[WWE]].

Austin enjoyed a successful [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#M|mid-card]] career as "Stunning" Steve Austin in [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) from 1991 to 1995. After a brief stint in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) in late 1995, he signed with the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF, now WWE) as The Ringmaster. Rebranded as "Stone Cold" Steve Austin the following year, he gained significant mainstream popularity as a brazen, vulgar, beer-drinking [[antihero]] who routinely [[Anti-establishment|defied the establishment]] and his boss, company chairman [[Vince McMahon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sammond2005|Sammond, Nicholas]], page 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pro Wrestling Hall of Shame: The Heels|last=Oliver|first=Greg|year=2007|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=1-55022-759-9|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This persona of Austin's became the "poster boy" of the [[Attitude Era]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/stone-cold-steve-austin-qa-vince-mcmahon-hulk-hogan-20141201|title='Stone Cold' Says So: Steve Austin on Vince McMahon, the WWE and Hulk Hogan|last=Stephen Kelly|first=Adam|date=December 1, 2014|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Boom and bust|boom period]] in WWF business in the latter 1990s and early 2000s.

Austin held 19 [[Professional wrestling championship|championships]] throughout his wrestling career, as he is a [[List of WWE Champions|six-time]] [[WWE Championship|WWF Champion]], a [[List of WWE Intercontinental Champions|two-time]] [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Champion]] and a [[List of World Tag Team Champions (WWE)|four-time]] [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Champion]]âthus making him the fifth [[Triple Crown (professional wrestling)#List of WWE Triple Crown Champions|Triple Crown Champion]] in WWE historyâwhile also being a [[List of WWE United States Champions|two-time]] [[WWE United States Championship|WCW United States Heavyweight Champion]], a [[List of WCW World Television Champions|two-time]] [[WCW World Television Championship|WCW World Television Champion]], a [[List of WCW World Tag Team Champions|one-time]] [[WCW World Tag Team Championship|WCW World Tag Team Champion]] and a [[List of NWA World Tag Team Champions|one-time]] [[NWA World Tag Team Championship|NWA World Tag Team Champion]] in WCW.

Furthermore, he was awarded the unsanctioned [[Million Dollar Championship]] by [[Ted DiBiase]].

Austin has main evented multiple [[List of WWE pay-per-view events#1990s|pay-per-view events]] for the WWE, including three [[WrestleMania]]s ([[WrestleMania XIV|XIV]], [[WrestleMania XV|XV]] and [[WrestleMania X-Seven|X-Seven]]). He was forced to retire from in-ring competition in 2003 due to a series of knee injuries and a serious neck injury. Throughout the rest of 2003 and 2004, he was featured as the [[Professional wrestling authority figures#Raw authorities|Co-General Manager]] and Sheriff of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''. Since 2005, he has continued to make occasional appearances, and was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] in 2009 by Vince McMahon. In 2011, Austin returned to WWE to host the reboot of the reality series ''[[WWE Tough Enough|Tough Enough!]]''.

== Early life ==
Austin was born in [[Austin, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#AustinRoss2003|Steve Austin. ''The Stone Cold Truth'']] (p.9)&lt;/ref&gt; His parents, James and Beverly Anderson (nÃ©e Harrison), divorced when he was around a year old. His mother moved to [[Victoria, Texas]], and in 1968, married Ken Williams.&lt;ref&gt;[[#AustinRoss2003|Steve Austin. ''The Stone Cold Truth'']] (p.10)&lt;/ref&gt; Austin adopted his stepfather's surname and later, legally changed his name to Steven James Williams. Austin has three brothers (Scott, Kevin, and Jeff) and one younger sister (Jennifer).&lt;ref name="brokenskullranch.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brokenskullranch.com/bio|title=Bio â Steve Austin Broken Skull Ranch|last1=Austin|first1=Steve|website=Steve Austin Broken Skull Ranch|accessdate=August 29, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160219182321/http://brokenskullranch.com/bio|archivedate=February 19, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin is less than a year younger, and Austin has hypothesized in his autobiography that their father may have left because he could not handle another child so soon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Austin|first=Steve|authorlink=Stone Cold Steve Austin|author2=Bryant, Dennis|title=The Stone Cold Truth|publisher=Pocket Books|year=2003|location=|url=|doi=|id=|isbn=0-7434-7720-0|page=3 pp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austin spent most of his childhood in [[Edna, Texas]].&lt;ref name="truth10" /&gt; After finishing his schooling from [[Edna High School]], Austin got a football scholarship at [[Wharton County Junior College]], followed by a full scholarship at the [[University of North Texas]].&lt;ref name="brokenskullranch.com" /&gt;

=== Early career (1989â1990) ===
Deciding to become a wrestler, Austin joined [[Chris Adams (wrestler)|Chris Adams]]' school in the [[Dallas Sportatorium]], where Adams also wrestled for [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW). Adams' training was purely technical, teaching Austin the moves, but nothing relating to [[kayfabe]] (still somewhat a guarded secret at the time) or business. His first lesson in that came from Tony Falk, the referee in his 1989 televised WCCW debut against Frogman LeBlanc, who [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Spot|called the spots]] to lead him to a [[Professional wrestling#Pinfall|pinfall]] and a $40 payday.

Initially working under his real name, he was named Steve Austin by Memphis [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booker]] [[Dutch Mantel]]l during the merger of World Class and the [[Continental Wrestling Association]] (CWA) into the [[United States Wrestling Association]] (USWA). The name change occurred to avoid confusion with [["Dr. Death" Steve Williams]], a well-known wrestler during that time. Austin later returned to Dallas, [[Manager (professional wrestling)|managed]] by [[Paul Bearer|Percy Pringle]] and accompanied by [[Lady Blossom|Jeannie Adams]] (Adams' ex-girlfriend and Austin's girlfriend at the time) and [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feuded]] with Adams and his wife [[Toni Adams|Toni]].

Austin then left the USWA in 1990 and signed with WCW the next year. It was during this time Austin adopted the "Stunning" nickname that followed him to WCW.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1991â1995)===
==== The Dangerous Alliance (1991â1992) ====
{{Main article|The Dangerous Alliance}}
Austin was originally paired with a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Valet|valet]] named Vivacious Veronica,&lt;ref name=truth86&gt;[[#AustinRoss2003|Steve Austin. ''The Stone Cold Truth'']] (p.85-86)&lt;/ref&gt; but was later joined by Jeannie Adams, known as "Lady Blossom".&lt;ref name=slam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/austin.html|title="Stone Cold" Steve Austin bio|work=Slam! Sports|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]|accessdate=June 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=truth86/&gt; Just weeks after his debut, Austin defeated [[Bobby Eaton]] for his first [[WCW World Television Championship]] on June 3, 1991 and later that year joined [[Paul Heyman|Paul E. Dangerously's]] [[Dangerous Alliance]].&lt;ref name=slam/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#AustinRoss2003|Steve Austin. ''The Stone Cold Truth'']] (p.89)&lt;/ref&gt; Austin lost the WCW World Television Championship to [[Barry Windham]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Series variations|two out of three falls match]] on April 27, 1992, but regained the title from Windham on May 23 and enjoyed a second lengthy reign as champion before losing the title to [[Ricky Steamboat]] on September 2, while The Dangerous Alliance disbanded shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="truth91"&gt;Austin Ross 2003, Steve Austin.''The Stone Cold Truth'' (p.91-93)&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Halloween Havoc (1992)|Halloween Havoc]] on October 25, Austin replaced [[Terry Gordy]], teaming with "Dr. Death" Steve Williams to wrestle [[Goldust|Dustin Rhodes]] and Windham for the unified WCW and [[NWA World Tag Team Championship]]s.&lt;ref name="truth91" /&gt; The teams wrestled to a thirty-minute time limit [[Professional wrestling#Draw|draw]].&lt;ref name="truth91"/&gt;

==== The Hollywood Blonds and The Stud Stable (1993â1995) ====
{{main article|The Hollywood Blonds#Steve Austin and Brian Pillman|l1=The Hollywood Blonds|The Stud Stable}}
In January 1993, Austin formed a [[tag team]] known as [[The Hollywood Blonds]] with [[Brian Pillman]].&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; They won the unified NWA and [[WCW World Tag Team Championship]] on March 3 by defeating Ricky Steamboat and [[Shane Douglas]] and held the title for five months.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; At ''[[Clash of the Champions#Clash of the Champions XXIII|Clash of the Champions XXIII]]'' on June 16, the Blondes faced [[Ric Flair]] and [[Arn Anderson]] in a two out of three falls tag team title match and were defeated, but retained the title as one fall had been determined by a [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash2.html#XXIII |title=Clash of the Champions XXIII results |accessdate=July 15, 2008 |publisher=Pro Wrestling History |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421024241/http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash2.html |archivedate=April 21, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At ''[[Clash of the Champions#Clash of the Champions XXIV|Clash of the Champions XXIV]]'' on August 18, Austin and Pillman were scheduled to defend their title against Anderson and [[Paul Roma]], but a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Legit|legitimate]] injured Pillman was replaced by [[William Regal|Steven Regal]], with whom Austin lost to Anderson and Roma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash2.html#XXIV |title=Clash of the Champions XXIV results |accessdate=July 15, 2008 |publisher=Pro Wrestling History |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421024241/http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash2.html |archivedate=April 21, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Pillman still injured, Austin joined [[Robert Fuller|Colonel Robert Parker]]'s [[Stud Stable]].&lt;ref name=Stud&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/s/stud-stable.html|title=Stud Stable|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=September 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Pillman returned, Austin betrayed and defeated him in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Singles match|singles match]] at ''[[Clash of the Champions#Clash of the Champions XXV|Clash of the Champions XXV]]'' on November 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash2.html#XXV |title=Clash of the Champions XXV results |accessdate=July 15, 2008 |publisher=Pro Wrestling History |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421024241/http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash2.html |archivedate=April 21, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Starrcade (1993)|Starrcade]] on December 27, Austin defeated Dustin Rhodes in a two out of three falls match with two straight falls to win the [[WWE United States Championship|WCW United States Heavyweight Championship]].&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; Austin lost the title to Ricky Steamboat on August 24, 1994 and was scheduled to face Steamboat in a rematch for the title at [[Fall Brawl (1994)|Fall Brawl]] on September 18, but Steamboat was unable to wrestle due to a legit back injury and Austin was awarded the title by forfeit. His second reign with the title ended just minutes later when he lost to Steamboat's replacement, [[Jim Duggan]], in a match that lasted thirty-five seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/fall.html#94|title=WCW Fall Brawl 1994 results|accessdate=July 15, 2008|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austin unsuccessfully challenged Duggan for the United States Heavyweight Championship at both [[Halloween Havoc (1994)|Halloween Havoc]] on October 23 and ''[[Clash of the Champions#Clash of the Champions XXIX|Clash of the Champions XXIX]]'' on November 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/havoc.html#94|title=WCW Halloween Havoc 1994 results|accessdate=July 15, 2008|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash2.html#XXIX |title=Clash of the Champions XXIX results |accessdate=July 15, 2008 |publisher=Pro Wrestling History |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421024241/http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash2.html |archivedate=April 21, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning from a knee injury in early 1995, Austin took part in a tournament for the vacant WCW United States Heavyweight title, where he defeated Duggan via [[Professional wrestling#Countout|countout]] in the first round, but lost to [[Randy Savage]] in the quarterfinals. In 1995, Austin was fired by WCW Vice President [[Eric Bischoff]] after suffering a triceps injury while wrestling on a Japanese tourâBischoff and WCW did not see Austin as a marketable wrestler.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stone Cold Steve Austin. ''The Stone Cold Truth'' (p.117â118)&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Bischoff thought Austin was hard to work with.&lt;ref name="MondayNightWars01-8"&gt;{{cite DVD|title=Monday Night War S01 E08: The Austin Era Has Begun|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extreme Championship Wrestling (1995) ===
Austin was contacted by [[Paul Heyman]] of [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW), who had managed him in WCW.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; Heyman hired Austin to do in-ring interviews as he still had not recovered from his injury enough to wrestle.&lt;ref name=cold120&gt;Stone Cold Steve Austin. ''The Stone Cold Truth'' (p.120)&lt;/ref&gt;

While in ECW, Austin used the platform to develop his future "Stone Cold" persona, as well as a series of vignettes running down WCW in general and Bischoff in particular, most memorably in several promos that mocked his then-status as ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]'' host by introducing ''Monday [[NyQuil]]'', where he was joined by "Bongo" (a set of drums, meant to represent [[Steve McMichael|Steve "Mongo" McMichael]]) in promoting the show "where the big boys play with each other".&lt;ref name=slam/&gt;&lt;ref name=cold120/&gt; Also several wrestlers credited ECW as the place where Austin developed his microphone skills.&lt;ref name="MondayNightWars01-8"/&gt; Austin has credited Heyman as the man who taught him how to cut a promo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Mike|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/article/94108/did-wwe-just-start-the-build-to-lesnar-vs-austin-at-mania-32-selling-punk-the-end-of-his-wwe-ecw-creative-run-and-more-complete-stone-cold-podcast-with-paul-heyman-coverage.html?p=1|title=Did WWE just start the build to Lesnar vs. Austin at Mania 32?

''The Stone Cold Truth'' (p.123â125)&lt;/ref&gt; and had a match with [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]] and feuded with [[Mikey Whipwreck]].&lt;ref name="cold123"/&gt;

Whipwreck, who was the [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship|ECW World Heavyweight Champion]] at the time, defeated Austin for the title at [[November to Remember (1995)|November to Remember]] on November 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1995d.html#111895|title=ECW November to Remember 1995 results|accessdate=July 15, 2008|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Austin learned Whipwreck's finishing move (the ''[[Stunner (professional wrestling)|Whipper-Snapper]]'') and would adopt it and popularize it in his later career as the ''Stone Cold Stunner''. The Sandman defeated Austin and Whipwreck in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] at [[December to Dismember (1995)|December to Dismember]] on December 9 for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1995d.html#120995|title=ECW December to Dismember 1995 results|accessdate=July 15, 2008|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heyman would later state that he had wanted Austin to win the title, but Austin had refused because he felt he was more effective "as the hunter, rather than the hunted".

==== The Million Dollar Corporation (1995â1996) ====
{{main article|The Million Dollar Corporation}}

While making his first [[List of WWE pay-per-view events|pay-per-view]] appearance at the [[Royal Rumble (1996)|Royal Rumble]] on January 21, where he was 'scripted' to be in the Final Four, which could have given him an early push, Austin botched the ringpost save against [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Fatu]] and slipped out of the ring early.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=WrestletalkTV|title=The Biggest WWE Royal Rumble BOTCHES!|date=January 21, 2018|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3MyL1T2TeQ|accessdate=January 24, 2018|website=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austin soon thought the Ringmaster idea was weak and so asked for a change.&lt;ref name="MondayNightWars01-8"/&gt; The WWF gave Austin a list with names inspired by [[Richard Kuklinski|"The Iceman" Richard Kuklinski]], including Otto Von Ruthless, Ice Dagger, Fang McFrost and Chilli McFreeze.&lt;ref name="MondayNightWars01-8"/&gt; Austin [[Head shaving|shaved his head bald]] and grew a [[goatee]], while on March 11 "The Ringmaster" moniker (now merely a prefix to his ring name) would be discarded in favor of his most famous nickname, "Stone Cold".

==== Austin 3:16 (1996â1997) ====
Austin's rise to stardom began at the [[King of the Ring (1996)|1996 King of the Ring]], where he won the [[King of the Ring]] tournament by defeating [[Jake Roberts|Jake "The Snake" Roberts]] in the finals.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt;&lt;ref name=almanac9598/&gt; At the time, Roberts was portraying a born-again Christian, so after the match, Austin cut a now famous [[List of professional wrestling terms#Promo|promo]] during his coronation, telling Roberts:&lt;ref&gt;Foley, Mick. ''Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks'' (p.229)&lt;/ref&gt; "You sit there and you thump your Bible, and you say your prayers, and it didn't get you anywhere! Talk about your Psalms, talk about [[John 3:16]]... Austin 3:16 says I just whipped your ass!". Austin's win and rise to stardom proved to be an un-telegraphed stroke of luck. Triple H was originally scheduled to win the 1996 King of the Ring, but was punished for the infamous Curtain Call incident that had transpired earlier that year. "Austin 3:16" ultimately became one of the most popular catchphrases in wrestling history&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; and subsequently the slogan became one of the best-selling T-shirts in WWE merchandise history. It is also credited as the iconic moment that began the WWF's "[[The Attitude Era|Attitude Era]]".{{CN|date=June 2018}}

[[File:Stone Cold Steve Austin in 1996.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Austin in 1996]]
Austin spoke about [[Bret Hart]], challenging him constantly and taunting him relentlessly. Hart finally accepted Austin's challenge and returned to the WWF in October 1996. At [[Survivor Series (1996)|Survivor Series]], in a match to determine the number-one contender to the [[WWE Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Championship]], Austin lost to Hart when Hart used the turnbuckle to push himself backwards while locked in the Million Dollar Dream and pinned Austin (this match would go on to create the foundations for the eventual year-long feud between the two).&lt;ref name=almanac9598/&gt; The match came hot on the heels of an incident broadcast live on ''[[WWE Raw|Raw Is War]]'', which saw Austin "[[Brian Pillman#"Pillman's Got a Gun"|break into]]" [[Brian Pillman]]'s house, with Pillman holding a gun. During the [[Royal Rumble (1997)|1997 Royal Rumble]] match, Austin was originally eliminated by Bret Hart, but the officials did not see it, and he snuck back into the ring and eliminated Hart by throwing him over the ropes, winning the match himself.&lt;ref name="PS32"&gt;{{cite news|author=Martin, Finn|title=Power Slam Magazine, issue 32|work="Back on Top" (Royal Rumble 1997)|publisher=SW Publishing|date=February 25, 1997|pages=12â15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the first-ever [[pay-per-view]] main event of Austin's WWF career at [[In Your House 13: Final Four]], after [[Shawn Michaels]] suffered a knee injury and left the WWF World Heavyweight Championship suddenly vacant. Austin was eliminated early from the four-way match at In Your House 13 for the title after injuring his own knee, but was involved in the finish which saw Hart win his fourth WWF World Heavyweight Championship,&lt;ref name=almanac9598/&gt; which he lost the next night on ''Raw Is War'' to [[Sid Eudy|Sycho Sid]] due to Austin's interference, continuing his feud with Hart. At [[WrestleMania 13]], Hart defeated Austin in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Variations of singles matches|Submission match]] with [[Ken Shamrock]] as a special referee. During the match, Austin had been cut and was bleeding profusely from his face, but he still refused to tap out when Hart locked in his Sharpshooter. Austin finally passed out from blood loss, still held in the Sharpshooter, and lost the match. After the bell, Hart continued to hold the Sharpshooter on Austin, who despite his wounds refused any assistance back to the locker room, thus turning Hart [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] and Austin [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]] in a rare [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#D|double-turn]].&lt;ref name=almanac9598/&gt; However, Austin portrayed an anti-hero instead of a traditional babyface. Austin eventually got his revenge on Hart in the main event of [[In Your House 14: Revenge of the 'Taker]], in a match to determine the number-one contender to The Undertaker's WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Austin won when Hart was disqualified due to assistance from [[Davey Boy Smith|The British Bulldog]], earning him a title match against [[The Undertaker]] at [[In Your House 15: A Cold Day in Hell|In Your House 15: A Cold Day In Hell]]. Austin faced Hart once again in a street fight on the April 21 episode of ''Raw Is War'', injuring his opponent's leg with a steel chair during the bout. The match was ruled a [[Professional wrestling#No contest|no contest]], but Austin proceeded to beat Hart while he was on a stretcher in the back of an ambulance. At A Cold Day In Hell, Austin had The Undertaker down with the Stone Cold Stunner, but distracted by timely interference on the part of Brian Pillman, Austin's old tag team partner from WCW, who rang the bell before Austin got the cover, Undertaker then nailed Austin with a [[Tombstone piledriver|Tombstone Piledriver]] and achieved the victory off the distraction.&lt;ref name=almanac9598/&gt;

During this time, Austin found a way to win the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] on two separate occasions. On May 26, 1997, Austin and Shawn Michaels defeated [[Owen Hart]] and The British Bulldog for the title. They held the title until July 14, before Michaels was forced to vacate due to an injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/304454132122112 |title=19970525 â Stone Cold &amp; Shawn Michaels |publisher=WWE |date= |accessdate=August 8, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051129091829/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/304454132122112 |archivedate=November 29, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; That same night a tournament was held to determine who would face Austin and a partner of his choosing for the vacant championship. Hart and Bulldog won the tournament, with Austin refusing to pick a partner and choosing to wrestle the former tag team champions by himself.&lt;ref name="thehistoryofwwe.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/97.htm|title=1997|website=TheHistoryofWWE.com|accessdate=May 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Late in the match, a debuting [[Mick Foley|Dude Love]] came out to offer assistance and Austin became a two-time tag team champion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/30445413212312 |title=19970714 â Stone Cold &amp; Dude Love |publisher=WWE |date= |accessdate=August 8, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051130072545/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/30445413212312 |archivedate=November 30, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Austin continued his feud with the Hart family, becoming embroiled in a heated rivalry with Owen Hart, who pinned a distracted Austin and secured victory for [[The Hart Foundation#The (New) Hart Foundation|The Hart Foundation]] in the ten-man Tag Team match main event of [[In Your House 16: Canadian Stampede]], where Austin was partnered with Ken Shamrock, [[Dustin Rhodes|Goldust]] and [[The Road Warriors|The Legion of Doom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoffco-inc.com/wwe/ppv/ppv/iyh16.html|title=WWF In Your House 16: "Canadian Stampede"|accessdate=February 9, 2011|work=CompleteWWE.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[SummerSlam (1997)|SummerSlam]], Austin and Owen Hart faced each other with Hart's [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] on the line and an added stipulation that Austin would have to kiss Hart's buttocks if he lost.&lt;ref name="thehistoryofwwe.com"/&gt; During the match, Hart botched a piledriver and dropped Austin on his head, resulting in a legitimate broken neck and temporary paralysis for Austin. As Hart stalled by baiting the audience, Austin managed to crawl over and pin Hart using a [[Pin (professional wrestling)#Roll-up|roll-up]] to win the Intercontinental Championship. A visibly injured and dazed Austin was helped to his feet by a number of referees and led to the back. Due to the severity of his neck injury, Austin was forced to relinquish both the Intercontinental Championship and the Tag Team Championships. On September 22, 1997 on the first-ever ''Raw Is War'' to be broadcast from [[Madison Square Garden]], Hart was giving a speech to the fans in attendance. During his speech, Austin entered the ring with five NYPD officers following, and assaulted Hart. As it looked like Austin was going to fight the officers, Vince McMahon ran into the ring to lecture Austin about why he could not be physically able to compete. After telling McMahon that he respects the fact that he and the WWF cared, Austin attacked McMahon with a Stone Cold Stunner, leaving McMahon in shock. Austin was then arrested as part of the storyline. Austin was sidelined until [[Survivor Series (1997)|Survivor Series]]. However, in the interim he made several appearances, one being at [[Badd Blood: In Your House|Badd Blood]] where he was involved in the finish of a match between Hart and [[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]], which was the final match in a tournament for the Intercontinental Championship. Austin hit Faarooq with the Intercontinental Championship belt while the referee's back was turned, causing Hart to win the match.&lt;ref name="thehistoryofwwe.com"/&gt; Austin's motive was to keep the Intercontinental Championship around Hart's waist, as demonstrated when he interfered in Hart's matches on the October 20 and 27 episodes of ''Raw Is War''.&lt;ref name="thehistoryofwwe.com"/&gt; Austin regained the Intercontinental Championship from Hart at [[Survivor Series (1997)|Survivor Series]].

With Hart out of the way, Austin set his sights on [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], who stole Austin's title belt on the November 17 episode of ''Raw Is War'' after Austin suffered a beating by his [[Nation of Domination]] stablemates.&lt;ref name="thehistoryofwwe.com"/&gt; In the weeks to come, The Rock began declaring himself to be "the best damn Intercontinental Champion ever".&lt;ref name="thehistoryofwwe.com"/&gt; The Rock kept possession of the title belt until [[D-Generation X: In Your House]], when Austin defeated him to retain the title and get his title belt back. As Austin had used his pickup truck to aid in his victory, McMahon ordered him to defend the title against The Rock the next night on ''Raw Is War''.&lt;ref name="thehistoryofwwe.com"/&gt; In an act of defiance after forfeiting the title to The Rock, Austin tossed the title belt into the [[Piscataqua River]].&lt;ref name="wwebio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/stonecoldsteveaustin/|title="Stone Cold" Steve Austin profile|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=May 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Feud with Vince McMahon (1997â1999) ====
After Bret Hart's controversial departure for WCW, Austin and Shawn Michaels were the top stars in the company. Austin won the [[Royal Rumble (1998)|1998 Royal Rumble]], lastly eliminating The Rock.&lt;ref name=pwi100&gt;{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac &amp; Book of Facts|work=Wrestling's Historical Cards|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next night on ''Raw Is War'', Austin interrupted Vince McMahon in his presentation of [[Mike Tyson]], who was making a special appearance, over the objection of McMahon referring to Tyson as "the baddest man on the planet". Austin flipped off Tyson, which led to Tyson shoving Austin much to McMahon's embarrassment, who began to publicly disapprove of the prospect of Austin as his champion. Tyson was later announced as "the special enforcer" for the main event at [[WrestleMania XIV]], although he appeared to be aligning himself with WWF World Heavyweight Champion Shawn Michaels' stable [[D-Generation X]].&lt;ref name=slam/&gt;&lt;ref name="wmtyson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Torch_Flashbacks_19/article_38025.shtml|title=Austin confronts Tyson, brawl breaks out|last=Keller|first=Wade|authorlink=Wade Keller|date=January 24, 1998|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|publisher=TDH Communications Inc.|accessdate=January 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to Austin's WWF World Heavyweight Championship match against Michaels at WrestleMania XIV, which he won with help from Tyson, who turned on DX by making the deciding three-count against Michaels and later hit him with his knock-out punch. This was Michaels' last match until 2002 as he had suffered two legitimate herniated discs and another completely crushed at the hands of The Undertaker in a casket match at the [[Royal Rumble (1998)|Royal Rumble]].&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; With Michaels' absence and winning the WWF World Heavyweight title, the Austin Era was ushered in.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt;

[[File:Austin with WWF title.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Austin as [[WWE World Championship|WWF Champion]]]]
On the ''Raw Is War'' after Austin won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, Vince McMahon presented him with a new title belt and warned Austin that he did not approve of his rebellious nature and that things could be done "the easy way or the hard way". Austin gave his answer in the form of another Stone Cold Stunner. This led to a segment a week later where Austin had pledged a few days prior in a meeting to "play ball" with McMahon, appearing in a suit and tie, with a beaming McMahon taking a picture of himself and his new corporate champion. The entire thing was a ruse by Austin who in the course of the segment proceeded to tear off the suit, tell McMahon it was the last time he would see Austin dressed like this, [[Groin attack|punch]] his boss in the "[[Testicles|corporate grapefruits]]" and take another picture of the two of them while McMahon was doubled over in pain. In April 1998, it appeared Austin and McMahon were going to battle out their differences in an actual match, but the match was declared a no contest when Dude Love made an appearance. This led to a match between Dude Love and Austin at [[Unforgiven: In Your House]], where Austin hit McMahon with a steel chair, then the following month they had a rematch at [[Over the Edge: In Your House]] for the WWF Championship. Austin managed to retain the title despite McMahon acting as the referee and his "Corporate Stooges" ([[Gerald Brisco]] and [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]]) as timekeeper and ring announcer, respectively. McMahon continued to do everything he could to ruin Austin and he finally scored a big victory for his side at [[King of the Ring (1998)|King of the Ring]].&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; Austin lost the WWF Championship to [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] in a First Blood match after The Undertaker accidentally hit him with a steel chair while the ref was incapacitated, despite Austin having knocked Kane unconscious and thwarted an earlier intervention by Mankind.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt;

Austin further angered McMahon by winning back the championship the next night on ''Raw Is War''.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; Austin also emerged victorious against The Undertaker at [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam]]. In response, McMahon set up a Triple Threat match at [[Breakdown: In Your House]], where The Undertaker and Kane pinned Austin at the same time. McMahon decided to vacate the WWF Championship&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; and award it based on a match between The Undertaker and Kane, in which Austin was the guest referee on [[Judgment Day: In Your House]]. Austin refused to count for either man and attacked both towards the end of the match. McMahon later fired him, although Austin got revenge by kidnapping McMahon and dragging him to the middle of the ring at "gunpoint", which ended up being a toy gun with a scroll that read "Bang! 3:16". During that segment, McMahon also learned that Stone Cold was later re-signed by his son, [[Shane McMahon]]. In the semifinals of the [[Survivor Series]] tournament to award the vacant WWF Championship, Austin lost to Mankind after Shane double-crossed Austin. The next night on ''Raw Is War'', [[Mills Lane|Judge Mills Lane]] ruled that The Rock had to defend his newly won WWF Championship against Austin that night, as stipulated in the new contract Austin had signed two weeks earlier with Shane. The Undertaker interfered and hit Austin with a shovel, earning Austin a disqualification victory. However, because the title would not change hands via disqualification, The Rock still kept the championship. At [[Rock Bottom: In Your House]], Austin defeated The Undertaker in a Buried Alive match after Kane performed a Tombstone Piledriver on The Undertaker into the grave. With this victory, Austin qualified for the [[Royal Rumble (1999)|1999 Royal Rumble]].

[[File:Steve Austin soaks in cheers.jpg|thumb|upright|Austin celebrates with [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]] [[Earl Hebner]]]]
Austin's next definitive chance to exact revenge on Mr. McMahon came during the 1999 Royal Rumble match. On ''Raw Is War'', McMahon drew Austin's entry number with the obvious intention of screwing him over. Austin drew entry number one, while McMahon drew number two thanks to WWF Commissioner Shawn Michaels. During the Royal Rumble match, McMahon slipped out of the ring and into the crowd as Austin chased him down. It turned out to be a trap as McMahon led Austin into the lobby restroom where he was ambushed by members of [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]]. Austin was injured and taken away in an ambulance. With Austin gone and not in the Rumble match, McMahon joined the announcers table in calling the match. Later on, however, Austin returned in an ambulance and re-entered the Royal Rumble, delivering a Stone Cold Stunner to [[Ray Traylor|Big Boss Man]] and eliminating him. With the assistance of The Corporation and a last minute interference from The Rock, Austin was eliminated by McMahon himself, who won the 1999 Royal Rumble.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt;

With McMahon turning down his number-one contender spot against The Rock, WWF Commissioner Michaels awarded Austin the title shot the next night on ''Raw Is War''. At [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre: In Your House|St. Valentine's Day Massacre]], Stone Cold got a one-on-one match against McMahon in a [[Steel Cage match|steel cage match]], with the WWF Championship opportunity at [[WrestleMania XV]] at stake.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; During the match, [[Big Show|Paul Wight]] made his debut, breaking through from under the ring and attacking Austin. Wight's attack propelled Austin into the side of the cage forcing the cage to give way and dropping Austin to the floor first, making him the victor.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; Austin defeated The Rock at WrestleMania XV to win his third WWF Championship.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; Austin faced The Rock in a rematch at [[Backlash: In Your House|Backlash]], in which Shane McMahon was the referee. During the match, Vince McMahon approached the ring, only to hand Austin back his Smoking Skull title belt and take Shane out of the proceedings. Austin won the match when another referee made the count. Austin would lose the title to The Undertaker at [[Over the Edge (1999)|Over the Edge]]. Due to events revolving around Vince McMahon, [[Stephanie McMahon|Stephanie]] and [[Linda McMahon]] made Austin the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the company as part of the storyline. Vince and Shane McMahon challenged Austin to a handicap [[ladder match]] at [[King of the Ring#1999|King of the Ring]] with the CEO title on the line, which the duo of father and son won. The next night on ''Raw Is War'', Austin made it clear that while he was the CEO of the company he could have a title shot at any time and place to be determined by himself. Austin made the WWF Championship match that night on ''Raw Is War'' and defeated The Undertaker to win his fourth WWF Championship. However, after he won it The Undertaker came and hit him with the title belt, leading to a First Blood match between the two at [[WWF Fully Loaded 1999|Fully Loaded]], where Mr. McMahon stipulated that if Austin lost he would never be able to wrestle for the WWF Championship again, and if Austin won he would never see McMahon again. Austin won after interference from X-Pac, hitting The Undertaker with a TV camera and gave McMahon a goodbye Stone Cold Stunner.

==== Rivalry with Triple H and The Alliance (1999â2001) ====
{{main|The Power Trip|The Invasion (professional wrestling)|The Alliance (professional wrestling)|l1=Two-Man Power Trip|l2=The Invasion|l3=The Alliance}}
[[File:Me&amp;austin.jpg|thumb|Austin with a fan]]
Austin held on to the WWF Championship until [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]] when he lost it to Mankind in a triple threat match also featuring [[Triple H]].&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; Triple H was originally scheduled to win his first championship at the event, but Austin refused to drop it to him, believing Triple H was not over enough with the crowd yet, so Mankind would be used as a transitional champion, dropping the title to Triple H the next night on ''Raw Is War''. Austin would get his rematch at [[No Mercy (1999)|No Mercy]] against Triple H, but he lost after The Rock accidentally struck him with a sledgehammer that was meant for Triple H. When [[Survivor Series (1999)|Survivor Series]] rolled around, Triple H was still champion. Austin was booked into a Triple Threat match for the WWF Championship against Triple H and The Rock. However, Austin was run down by a car in the parking lot.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; Austin then underwent neck surgery by Dr. [[Lloyd Youngblood]], due to Austin's injury from the piledriver at [[Summerslam (1997)|SummerSlam two years prior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shoop|first1=Stephen A|last2=Falcon|first2=Mike|title=Piledriver slams Austin into surgery|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/health/doctor/lhdoc051.htm|accessdate=August 19, 2014|work=[[USA Today]]|date=December 14, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was away for a nine-month rehabilitation, with the car angle as his reason for leaving.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt;

In April 2000, Austin appeared at [[Backlash (2000)|Backlash]], attacking Triple H and Vince McMahon to help The Rock reclaim the WWF Championship. After Austin's official return at [[Unforgiven (2000)|Unforgiven]], Commissioner Mick Foley led an investigation to find out who ran Austin down at Survivor Series the previous year.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Rikishi]] admitted to being the driver because "he did it for The Rock". Rikishi felt that Austin occupied the top spot in the company and with him gone, Rock, a fellow Samoan, would be able to ascend to the top of the company. At [[No Mercy (2000)|No Mercy]], Austin was back to face Rikishi in a No Holds Barred match. During the match, Austin mentioned he was going to drive his truck into Rikishi, who by that time was a bloody mess. Before he could, he was stopped by officials, the match being deemed no contest and Austin was (kayfabe) arrested and later bailed out by Commissioner Foley. During a handicap match against Rikishi and [[Kurt Angle]], Triple H came down with the apparent intention of teaming with Austin. After clearing the ring, Triple H smashed his sledgehammer over Austin's head, and revealed it was actually him behind the whole scheme, devised to shield the WWF Championship from Austin and end his career. At [[Survivor Series (2000)|Survivor Series]], Triple H had plotted to run Austin down again during their match but his plot failed when Austin lifted Triple H's automobile with a forklift, then let it drop 20 feet. Austin won his third [[Royal Rumble (2001)|Royal Rumble]] in January 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20010128/ai_n9605892|title=Stone Cold rumbles to Houston aiming to sell out Astrodome|author=Blackjack Brown|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=December 6, 2007|date=January 28, 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101113130/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20010128/ai_n9605892 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;|archivedate=November 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; last eliminating Kane. His rivalry against Triple H ended at [[No Way Out (2001)|No Way Out]] in a Three Stages of Hell match, with Triple H beating Austin two falls to one.

With The Rock defeating Kurt Angle for the WWF Championship at No Way Out, Austin was set to face The Rock at WrestleMania. In the weeks leading up to WrestleMania, animosity grew between Austin and The Rock, stemming from Austin's wife, [[Debra Marshall|Debra]], being assigned to be The Rock's manager by Mr. McMahon, but then relieved of that role after failing to prevent a brawl between Rock and Austin. At [[WrestleMania X-Seven]], Austin faced The Rock for the second time and before the match began it was announced that the match had been made no disqualification. Midway during the match, Mr. McMahon made his way to ringside, then prevented The Rock from pinning Austin on two separate occasions and provided Austin a steel chair to hit The Rock with. Austin then hit The Rock several times with the chair and pinned him to win the WWF Championship for the fifth time.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; After the match, Austin celebrated by shaking hands with Mr. McMahon, turning Austin heel.

The next night on ''Raw Is War'', after teasing a quick face turn, the heel turn continued and he also altered his character considerably over the next few months; in a deliberate turn from the rebellious and anti-establishment character beloved by the fans, Austin became a whiny, temperamental primadonna who complained incessantly when he felt he was not getting the respect from the fans and wrestlers that he deserved. He also developed an infatuation with McMahon, going to great lengths to impress him and even going so far as to hugging him and bringing him presents. McMahon, though visibly uncomfortable and wary by the attention, was still grateful to have Austin with him instead of against him. During a steel cage match with The Rock in a rematch for the title, Triple H came down to the ring with a sledgehammer and together with Austin viciously attacked The Rock and put him out of action. Austin further cemented his heel turn the following Thursday on ''SmackDown!'', when, during an interview with [[Jim Ross]] about his actions at WrestleMania, he thought Ross was denouncing their friendship and then proceeded to attack and brutally assault Ross. Austin and Triple H became a team and called themselves [[The Power Trip|The Two-Man Power Trip]].&lt;ref name=slam/&gt;

Austin and Triple H were the top heels in the company, and feuding with The Undertaker and Kane. After defeating Kane and The Undertaker for the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] at [[Backlash (2001)|Backlash]], they held the tag team titles, the WWF Championship (Austin) and the Intercontinental Championship (Triple H) all at once. At [[Judgment Day (2001)|Judgment Day]], Triple H lost his Intercontinental title to Kane. The following night on ''Raw Is War'', Austin and Triple H wrestled against [[Chris Jericho]] and [[Chris Benoit]] with the tag team titles on the line. Midway through the match, Triple H tore his quadriceps muscle.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; As planned, the team lost the tag team titles at the end of the match when Triple H accidentally hit Austin in the stomach with a sledgehammer but the injury to Triple H, which kept him out for the remainder of the year, forced the WWF to go in another direction. Austin officially broke up The Power Trip on that week's ''SmackDown!'', criticizing Triple H for his injury and for hitting him with the sledgehammer. He continued to align himself with McMahon and began feuding with Jericho and Benoit by himself, with Kurt Angle joining the group as Triple H's replacement. For most of the next month leading to [[King of the Ring (2001)|King of the Ring]], he constantly fell victim to a double submission involving Jericho's Walls of Jericho and Benoit's Crippler Crossface and did not wrestle as he was nursing an injury, but continued to feud with the reigning tag team champions, eventually costing them the titles on the ''SmackDown!'' preceding King of the Ring against the [[Dudley Boyz]]. Austin defeated Jericho and Benoit in a Triple Threat match, despite interference from the debuting [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]. Stone Cold suffered a back injury during the match after Booker T dropped Stone Cold through the announcer's table.

[[File:Austinentrance.jpg|thumb|upright|Austin's signature ring entrance at [[WrestleMania XIX]]]]
After King of the Ring, Austin was left without a feud as Benoit was lost for the next year after neck surgery and Jericho moved on to other things. He began a small spat with Angle over who was McMahon's biggest supporter. Meanwhile, [[History of World Championship Wrestling#Acquisition by the World Wrestling Federation and aftermath|the purchase of World Championship Wrestling (WCW)]] by McMahon began to bear fruit as [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|The Invasion]] began. McMahon was not able to fight off the invading WCW wrestlers, and when they formed an [[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|alliance]] with a group of Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) alumni that were signed to the WWF and both Shane and Stephanie McMahon were now aligned against their father, McMahon's empire began to crumble and he had zero help from his two biggest stars at the time. Austin made it known that he was against teaming with Angle, whom Austin saw as both a threat to his WWF Championship, as well as an annoying tag-along. Finally, a frustrated McMahon called Austin out and demanded that he bring "the old Stone Cold" back, even going as far as asking Austin to give him a Stone Cold Stunner, so he could effectively captain a team of WWF wrestlers in a ten-man tag team match at the upcoming [[WWF Invasion|InVasion]] pay-per-view in July. A dejected Austin initially refused, but on the following episode of ''Raw Is War'' he returned to his old ways and hit Stunners on every member of the Alliance, turning face again. At InVasion, Austin captained the WWF team consisting of himself, Angle, Jericho, and [[The Brothers of Destruction|The Undertaker and Kane]] against the team of WCW's Booker T and [[Diamond Dallas Page]] and ECW's [[Rhino (wrestler)|Rhyno]] and [[The Dudley Boyz]]. Late in the match, however, as Angle had Booker in the ankle lock, Austin turned on Angle by Stunning him and joined the Alliance, turning Austin heel once again.&lt;ref name="slam" /&gt; The reason why Austin did this was that he felt McMahon was grooming Angle to take over his spot, that he was trying to get in touch with The Rock to return, and that he himself was "unappreciated" when McMahon insisted he return to the old Austin. Austin was immediately made the Alliance's new leader and began to feud with Angle over his WWF Championship.

Austin lost his title to Angle at [[Unforgiven (2001)|Unforgiven]] by submitting to the ankle lock, but began badgering Angle for a rematch due to his hand being under the ropes. Austin received that rematch on the October 8 episode of ''Raw'' and won the title after WWF Commissioner William Regal betrayed Angle and joined the Alliance.&lt;ref name="slam" /&gt; Austin then began feuding with Alliance member [[Rob Van Dam]], who was the only member of the Alliance to be cheered by the fans despite the villainous tactics of the group. Austin faced Angle and Van Dam at [[No Mercy (2001)|No Mercy]] later that month and won by pinning the latter. On the October 29 episode of ''Raw'', Angle joined the Alliance and became the second most powerful wrestler in the group. [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]] was coming up&lt;ref name="slam" /&gt; and it was ultimately decided to have a winner-take-all Survivor Series tag match with the winning team becoming the surviving entity. Austin was chosen to captain team Alliance, which consisted of Angle, Shane McMahon, Van Dam and Booker T, against Team WWF which was captained by The Rock, who had returned the week following Austin's betrayal of the WWF at InVasion. The Rock's team included Jericho, Kane, The Undertaker and [[Big Show]].

At Survivor Series, Austin was one of the last two wrestlers in the match, with The Rock being the other, and was the last remaining hope for the Alliance to survive. Late in the match, Austin attempted to win the match with the Rock Bottom, the Rock's finishing maneuver, but failed to earn a three count. He then kicked out of his own Stone Cold Stunner, which the Rock nailed on him, and attacked two referees including Alliance referee Nick Patrick. With the officials down, Angle ran to the ring and picked up Austin's title belt. He then entered the ring and struck Austin with it, betraying the Alliance and enabling The Rock to hit the Rock Bottom on Austin for the pin and the victory. With that, the InVasion ended, the Alliance was forced to disband, and Austin's future in the company was in question. Eventually, McMahon decided he was going to strip Austin of the title and award it to Angle for his actions. Just before he could, [[Ric Flair]] returned to the WWF for the first time since his 1993 departure and announced he was now half owner of the company. Austin returned moments after this announcement and attacked Angle and McMahon for their actions. He was then handed his title belt by Flair and celebrated with him in the ring, turning him face once again.

Flair then decided that Austin would face off against The Rock, who was still in possession of the former [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]] (which was renamed the World Championship), at the upcoming [[Vengeance (2001)|Vengeance]] pay-per-view in December to unify the titles. However, since Austin was still feuding with Angle and Rock had an unresolved feud with Jericho over his own title, McMahon overruled Flair and said that both men would wrestle their respective rivals for their respective titles at Vengeance, with the winners to face each other and the winner of that match to be crowned [[Undisputed championship|Undisputed]] WWF Champion. Austin won his first match by defeating Angle and faced World Champion Jericho in the [[Championship unification|unification match]]. Austin lost the match and his title after McMahon and Booker T interfered. Immediately after, Austin and Booker T began feuding which led to various fights in strange venues, such as a [[Confession (religion)|church confessional]], a [[bingo hall]] and a [[supermarket]].

==== Booking crisis and in-ring retirement (2002â2003) ====
Beginning 2002, although Austin's character remained with the WWF's most popular wrestlers as top face, his upcoming storylines in the build-up to WrestleMania were somewhat questionable compared to those of his previous years. In the [[Royal Rumble (2002)|2002 Royal Rumble]], Triple H made his long-awaited return from injury, with him and Austin two of the last four participants in the ring along with Kurt Angle and [[Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect]]. Austin was eliminated by Kurt Angle, but he shortly went back in the ring and hit all three with a steel chair. A few days later on ''Raw,'' he defeated Kurt Angle to earn a shot at Chris Jericho's Undisputed WWF Championship at [[No Way Out (2002)|No Way Out]].

In the build-up to No Way Out, McMahon had re-signed the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order (nWo)]], who started a feud with him. Austin refused a beer gift from them, and the nWo costing him his match against Jericho later that night. Problems in the backstage creativity were however then seemingly beginning to surface. Austin was reported as being unhappy regarding [[Hulk Hogan]]'s return to the WWF, and was reported as refusing to lose to Hogan in a proposed match at [[WrestleMania X8]], while Hogan reportedly told McMahon the same regarding losing to Austin. In recent years, Austin has this to say about why the match never took place: "I guarantee you, if my head had been at a little different place, then by all rights, a [match] should have happened", Austin told JR. "Physically and mentally where I was at, I could go. I think Hogan probably would have been a step or two behind that. That wasn't acceptable to me, and I didn't want to slow myself down. I say that with all due respect to Hulk Hogan, because he had a hellacious run. That was my thought process back in the day. I didn't think we could deliver".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Linder|first=Zach|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/10-wrestlemania-matches-that-almost-happened/page-11|title=The untold stories behind 10 WrestleMania matches that almost happened|date=March 31, 2014|accessdate=May 16, 2018|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the match was re-billed as The Rock defeating Hogan, whilst Austin defeated [[Scott Hall]], climaxing his feud with the nWo.

In a surprise altercation, the next night on ''Raw'', Austin refused to show up and took a week-long break without the company's consent, claiming exhaustion. McMahon claimed his actions caused fury among fans who had paid to see him that night. Austin returned on the April 1, 2002 episode of ''Raw'', the first of the new "[[WWE brand extension|brand extension]]" era. The show was centered on which show he would sign with, and he ultimately chose Raw. Austin entered a feud with The Undertaker that resulted in a number-one contender's match for the Undisputed WWF Championship at [[Backlash (2002)|Backlash]], which Austin lost despite having his foot on the rope when he was pinned. He would later be betrayed by Big Show, who went on to rejoin the nWo, and Ric Flair. Austin then defeated Big Show and Flair in a handicap match at [[Judgment Day (2002)|Judgment Day]]. In an interview on WWE's premier Internet program, ''Byte This!'', in May 2002, Austin stunned the company and fans by launching a verbal attack on the direction the company was heading in and slated the creative team for not using him the way he felt they previously did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gardner|first1=William|title=WWE Byte This Report â Stone Cold Steve Austin|url=http://www.twnpnews.com/messages2/6000/6535.shtml|website=TWNP News|accessdate=August 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commentators struggled to keep Austin's opinions on a neutral wavelength, leading to the WWE apologising to fans for the outburst and stated it was not part of Austin's current or upcoming storylines. McMahon responded a week later on the same show playing down the outburst, claiming that Austin was merely the type of wrestler who was occasionally difficult to work with. 

The WWE rehired [[Eddie Guerrero]] for Austin to feud with, while also prepping Austin for a feud with [[Brock Lesnar]]. However, Austin vetoed any matches that would result in him losing to Lesnar and ultimately walked out of the company.&lt;ref name=trip/&gt; Austin later explained that he thought hot-shotting a rookie made Austin look weak and did not give Lesnar a proper stage for such a big win over a star of the magnitude that Austin held. Further fanning the flames amongst Austin's growing number of detractors was a well-publicized domestic dispute incident between Austin and his wife Debra ([[#Personal life#Domestic violence cases|see below]]).&lt;ref name=trip/&gt;

After Austin [[List of professional wrestling terms#No show|no-showed]] the June 10 episode of ''Raw'', his storylines were dropped.&lt;ref name=trip&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rattlesnake.amp-productions.com/groupfiles/Articles/2002_10_00.html|title=Austin's power trip|author=Alex Gordon|publisher=Wrestling Digest|accessdate=June 10, 2016|date=October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austin walked out again, publicly stating he felt bad storylines were presented to him by the creative team. This time his departure was for good.&lt;ref name=trip/&gt; McMahon, along with longtime Austin supporter and real-life friend Jim Ross, [[Bury (professional wrestling)|buried]] Austin on WWE programming, referring to him as "taking his ball and going home" because he was not getting his way, whilst also explaining to the fans that neither he nor Ross were able to persuade Austin to change his mind. McMahon insisted that Austin owed an apology to all the fans across the world, especially those who paid solely to see him that night. McMahon toasted to Austin's career with a beer thanking him for all his hard work nonetheless. The same night, Austin's entrance theme was played during an in-ring segment by Ric Flair, but it was transitioned to Eddie Guerrero's theme and he entered the arena. The Rock also made an appearance on ''Raw'' that night, despite being drafted to ''SmackDown!'', and announced his frustrations towards Austin and threw a can of beer at McMahon. Austin's merchandise continued to sell greatly in the weeks following his departure, however with no sign of a return likely to be seen, the company stopped marketing his character, his merchandise, and removed his profile from WWE.com.

For the remainder of 2002, Austin kept a low profile and did not make any public appearances. It was reported, however, by the end of the year, Austin and McMahon met and resolved their differences. He then agreed to return to the company in early 2003. In an interview with ''WWE Raw Magazine'', he announced deep regret over the situation that led to his departure and the way in which he had left, and deeper regret over inaccurate speculation regarding his alleged grudges held against other WWE wrestlers, claiming he had no problem with Scott Hall rejoining the company. However, he admitted he still held strong reservations about his singles match with Hall at WrestleMania only lasting seven minutes and felt the build-up to the match did not live up to the expectations of his fans or Hall's, and was angered by speculation suggesting he disagreed with [[Kevin Nash]] re-joining the company, insisting he and Nash have always been good friends. In an interview with Vince McMahon on his podcast in 2014, Austin revealed for the first time that McMahon had fined him $650,000 upon his return, but he was able to lower the amount to $250,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-news/51937-vince-mcmahon-addresses-cm-punk-on-stone-cold-podcast|title=Vince McMahon addresses CM Punk on Stone Cold Podcast|date=December 2, 2014|accessdate=December 2, 2014|publisher=WrestleView}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rockaustinxix.jpg|left|thumb|Austin (left) faces off against [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] at [[WrestleMania XIX]] in Austin's last match]]
Austin confessed he had a major rift with Triple H's role in the company upon his return in 2002, but insisted as of 2003 they resolved their issues. In addition, he claimed a brief dispute with The Rock was resolved quickly upon his return, and that none of his disputes with the talent roster continued or played the major part in his departure. In February, Austin returned at [[No Way Out (2003)|No Way Out]] by defeating Eric Bischoff. Austin would wrestle only one match between then and WrestleMania in another short match against Bischoff on ''Raw'', but was then defeated by The Rock at [[WrestleMania XIX]], who returned about the same time as a smug, "sell out" villain, which, ultimately, became Austin's last official match in WWE. 

The night after on ''Raw'', Austin was fired in the storyline by Bischoff on medical grounds. The next day, Austin gave an interview on WWE.com announcing his retirement from wrestling, although he stated that he and Vince McMahon had reached an agreement seeing him only appear in non-wrestling roles on a weekly basis. In reference to Bischoff firing him on ''Raw'' that week, he said that although firing was for storyline purposes, he admitted the medical problems read out on ''Raw'' were legitimate and mainly related back to his injury sustained at SummerSlam in a match with Owen Hart in August 1997, and had begun to seriously plague him since late 2001. He confessed wrestling against the advice of his doctors up until his departure in 2002, which forced him to quit wrestling, and cited this as the sole reason as to why he suddenly departed, with doctors advising an awkward or violent move performed on him could have resulted in Austin being permanently disabled or resulting in death.

==== Sheriff of ''Raw'' (2003â2004) ====
[[File:Stone Cold Steve Austin.jpg|thumb|upright|Austin in Iraq, 2003]]
The following month, Austin began his non-wrestling career with WWE and began a fresh storyline when he was brought back by Linda McMahon as the Raw Co-General Manager. He continued this storyline for the remainder of the year, still showing wrestling moves including the ''Stone Cold Stunner'' and several exchanges of punches and kicks, although limiting regularity of these being performed. On the November 17, 2003, episode of ''Raw'', Austin was "fired" from ''Raw'' as the result of a stipulation in a match at [[Survivor Series (2003)|Survivor Series]] where Austin's hand-picked team of wrestlers failed to beat Bischoff's team of wrestlers. After Survivor Series, [[Mick Foley]] would become the new Co-General Manager of ''Raw'', and began a ([[kayfabe]]) petition to have Austin re-instated. Austin quickly returned to WWE television before the end of 2003 when he was part of the ''[[WWE Tribute to the Troops#2003|Tribute to the Troops]]'' taped live in front of U.S. troops in [[Iraq]], posing and attacking Mr. McMahon. He returned to ''Raw'' on December 29 as its "Sheriff", giving a ''Stone Cold Stunner'' to Eric Bischoff and rehiring Shawn Michaels, who had just been "fired" by Bischoff.

Austin appeared on-and-off as 2004 began, culminating in him being the special guest referee for the Brock Lesnar vs. [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] match at [[WrestleMania XX]]. On April 17, WWE announced that they were unable to settle long-running contract disputes with Austin and had again parted ways.

==== Sporadic appearances (2005âpresent) ====
Austin made his first appearance on WWE programming in a year at [[WrestleMania 21]] where he was confronted by [[Roddy Piper]] in ''[[Piper's Pit]]'', until [[Carly ColÃ³n|Carlito]] interrupted to insult both. This resulted in Carlito receiving a stunner from Austin and Piper throwing him out of the ring. The segment ended with Austin and Piper celebrating with beer until Austin gave Piper a ''Stone Cold Stunner'' as well. Austin was involved in the concluding segment at [[ECW One Night Stand (2005)|ECW One Night Stand]] in which he had a beer bash with the ECW locker room and brawled with the anti-ECW invaders, led by Eric Bischoff. He returned at ''Raw Homecoming'', delivering ''Stone Cold Stunners'' to [[Vince McMahon|Mr. McMahon]], [[Shane McMahon]], [[Stephanie McMahon]] and [[Linda McMahon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/051003.html|title=Raw results â October 3, 2005|accessdate=May 25, 2007|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; An angle including [[Jim Ross]] being fired led to a match in which Austin agreed to face [[Jonathan Coachman]] at [[Taboo Tuesday (2005)|Taboo Tuesday]], with the stipulation of Ross regaining his announcing job had Austin won and Austin losing his own job had he lost. Austin hurt his back prior to the match and could not wrestle unless he was heavily medicated, so the match was cancelled. To explain away his failure to appear at Taboo Tuesday, Vince McMahon said on ''Raw'' that Austin had been involved in an accident, thus preventing him from competing. [[Dave Bautista|Batista]] substituted for Austin, defeating Coachman along with [[Big Van Vader|Vader]] and [[Goldust]]. The stipulation was dropped due to Austin not competing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/november/taboo2005.htm|title=Taboo Tuesday 2005 Results|accessdate=September 17, 2007|publisher=PWWEW.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to WWE briefly to face [[John Layfield|John "Bradshaw" Layfield]] (JBL) in a beer drinking contest at the March 5, 2006, episode of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]''. Austin inducted Bret Hart into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] on April 1, 2006.&lt;ref name="slam"/&gt;

[[File:Austin at Cyber Sunday 2008 crop.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Austin would often referee matches after retiring from wrestling]]
Austin returned to WWE programming (appearing on ''Raw'', ''[[ECW (WWE)|ECW]]'', and ''SmackDown!'') in March 2007, partially to promote his starring role in the release of WWE Films' production, ''[[The Condemned]]''. On March 31, 2007, Austin inducted Jim Ross into the WWE Hall of Fame. At [[WrestleMania 23]], Austin, as a [[referee (professional wrestling)#Special referee|special guest referee]], officiated the match between [[Bobby Lashley]] and [[Umaga (wrestler)|Umaga]]. The stipulation for the match was that if Lashley lost, [[Donald Trump]]'s head would be shaved, and if Umaga lost, Mr. McMahon's head would suffer that fate. During the match, Austin delivered ''Stone Cold Stunners'' to Umaga, Vince McMahon, Shane McMahon and [[Donald Trump]]. Lashley won the match and Trump, Austin and Lashley then shaved Mr. McMahon's head. Austin ended by hitting the ''Stone Cold Stunner'' on McMahon, as well as Donald Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/march/xxiii.htm|title=WrestleMania 23 Results|accessdate=September 17, 2007|publisher=PWWEW.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then appeared in a video on the June 11 episode of ''Raw'' as part of "Mr. McMahon's Appreciation Night", where he shared his thoughts on his past feuds with McMahon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/070611.html|title=Raw results â June 11, 2007|accessdate=October 22, 2007|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austin appeared on the August 18, 2007 episode of ''Saturday Night's Main Event'', as a possible illegitimate child of Mr. McMahon and stunned McMahon and Jonathan Coachman. He then appeared at [[SummerSlam (2007)|SummerSlam]] to aid [[Matt Hardy]] in battling [[Montel Vontavious Porter]] in a beer drinking contest. The match ended in a no contest after Austin handed a beer to MVP and gave him the ''Stone Cold Stunner''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/august/2007.htm|title=SummerSlam 2007 Results|accessdate=October 22, 2007|publisher=PWWEW.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austin made another appearance at [[Cyber Sunday (2007)|Cyber Sunday]], where he guest refereed a World Heavyweight Championship match between Batista and The Undertaker. On the November 5 episode of ''Raw'', Austin made an appearance to confront [[Santino Marella]] for criticizing ''The Condemned''.&lt;ref name="beer bath"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/11052007/articles/stonecoldsantino|title='Stone Cold' drops a box-office bomb on Santino|date=November 5, 2007|author=Corey Clayton|accessdate=December 31, 2007|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument ended as Marella received a ''Stone Cold Stunner'' from Austin, who then walked backstage only to return with a [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] beer truck to hose down Marella and his valet [[Maria Kanellis|Maria]] with beer.&lt;ref name="beer bath"/&gt; Austin appeared on the ''Raw 15th Anniversary'' special, attacking Vince McMahon.

[[File:Stone Cold smashing beers.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Austin is noted for his signature "beer smash", seen here at [[WrestleMania XXV]]]]
On the January 12, 2009, episode of ''Raw'', Austin was announced to be the first member of the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/articles/9109986|title=One and only "Hall-Raiser"|accessdate=February 15, 2009|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was inducted by his long-term on-screen rival Vince McMahon, who referred to Austin as "the greatest WWE [wrestler] of all time". During the induction, Austin said he was officially closing the door on his wrestling career and starting a new chapter in his life. 

Austin appeared as the [[List of WWE Raw guest stars|guest host]] of ''Raw'' on the March 15, 2010, episode, where he moderated a contract signing between [[Vince McMahon]] and [[Bret Hart]] for their match at [[WrestleMania XXVI]]. In early 2011, Austin was announced as the head trainer and host for the revival of ''[[WWE Tough Enough|Tough Enough]]''. On the March 7 episode of ''Raw'', Austin interrupted the contract signing of the special guest referee to the Michael Cole and Jerry Lawler match at [[WrestleMania XXVII]], originally scheduled to be [[John Layfield|John "Bradshaw" Layfield]]; Austin attacked Layfield and signed the contract instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Caldwell|first=James|url=https://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/wwerawreport/article_48305.shtml|title=Caldwell's WWE Raw Results 3/7: Complete "virtual time" coverage of live Raw - Taker-Hunter stipulation, Stone Cold's TV return, WrestleMania hype, Cena-Rock|date=March 7, 2011|accessdate=May 16, 2018|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|publisher=TDH Communications Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Lawler won by submission, the [[Anonymous Raw General Manager]] reversed the decision and disqualified Lawler, claiming that Austin had "overstepped his authority". He appeared on ''Raw'' the following night with the cast from ''Tough Enough'', while also getting into an altercation with [[The Miz]] and [[Alex Riley]]. On the June 6 episode of ''Raw'', Austin appeared to declare [[Andy Leavine]] as the winner of ''Tough Enough''. He also served as the [[Referee (professional wrestling)#Special guest referees|special guest referee]] in the evening's tag team main event, [[John Cena]] and [[Alex Riley]] against [[The Miz]] and [[Ron Killings|R-Truth]], hitting Miz with a ''Stone Cold Stunner'' and aiding Cena. However, the Anonymous Raw General Manager chimed in and the Anonymous Raw General Manager's ringside mouthpiece [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] announced that since Austin had abused his authority as referee, The Miz and R-Truth had won via disqualification. Austin did not take kindly to the Anonymous Raw General Manager overturning his decision and Cole also received a ''[[Stunner (professional wrestling)|Stone Cold Stunner]]'', which was followed with another ''[[Professional wrestling throws#Fireman's carry takeover|Attitude Adjustment]]'' courtesy of Cena. Austin and Cena closed the show, celebrating with a beer bash. Austin appeared as the special guest General Manager on the "[[WWE All-Stars]]" episode of ''Raw''. During the show, Austin destroyed the Anonymous Raw General Manager's laptop by running over it with his ATV.

== Personal life ==
Austin dated Kathryn Burrhus throughout high school and college, and the two married on November 24, 1990. Nonetheless, Austin pursued a relationship with [[Jeanie Clarke]] ("Lady Blossom"), with whom he was working. His marriage to Burrhus was quickly annulled on August 7, 1992,&lt;ref name=truth79&gt;[[#AustinRoss2003|Steve Austin.''The Stone Cold Truth'']] (p.79)&lt;/ref&gt; and Austin and Clarke married on December 18, 1992. Together, they have two daughters, Stephanie (born in 1992), and Cassidy (born in 1996). Cassidy lives with her mother in [[England]], while Stephanie resides in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=sct97&gt;[[#AustinRoss2003|Steve Austin. ''The Stone Cold Truth'']] (p. 95-97)&lt;/ref&gt; Austin also adopted Jade, Clarke's daughter with former husband [[Chris Adams (wrestler)|Chris Adams]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#AustinRoss2003|Steve Austin.

Jade lives in the U.S. with her husband and son.&lt;ref name=sct97/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Stated in ''The Stone Cold Truth'' video]&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 13, 2000, Austin married [[wrestling valet]] [[Debra Marshall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/stonecoldcert1.html |title=Steve Williams and Debra's Marriage Certificate |accessdate=April 8, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422190330/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/stonecoldcert1.html |archivedate=April 22, 2008 |website=[[The Smoking Gun]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Domestic violence cases ===
On June 15, 2002, Debra Marshall called police to the couple's home and told officers that Austin had beaten her on the head, back, and legs then stormed out of the house before police arrived. According to police reports, Debra suffered a swollen cheek and eye and bruises to her back and shoulder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1455205/for-the-record-quick-news-on-stone-cold-steve-austin-eminem-osama-bin-laden-pink-jay-z-more/|title=For The Record: Quick News On Stone Cold Steve Austin, Eminem, Osama Bin Laden, Pink, Jay-Z &amp; More|publisher=[[MTV]]|date=June 14, 2002|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austin called the house while officers were there and was told he was in trouble but declined a request to return to the house or report to the police station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vries|first=Lloyd|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/pro-wrestler-accused-of-wife-beating/|title=Pro Wrestler Accused Of Wife-Beating|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=June 17, 2002|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 14, 2002, Austin was arrested and charged with domestic abuse. He pleaded [[Nolo contendere|no contest]] on November 25, 2002, and was given a year's probation, a $1,000 fine, and ordered to carry out 80 hours of community service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/stonecoldplea1.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817110113/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/wrestler-steve-austin-taps-out-wife-assault|archivedate=August 17, 2010|deadurl=yes|website=[[The Smoking Gun]]|title=Wrestler Steve Austin Taps Out In Wife Assault|date=November 1, 2002|accessdate=April 8, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marshall would later claim that Austin was a [[steroid]] user, and this incident was the result of [[Anabolic steroid#Aggression and hypomania|roid rage]].&lt;ref name="Debra Fox"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,287361,00.html|title=Exclusive!

On March 26, 2004, Austin allegedly assaulted his girlfriend [[Tess Broussard]] during a dispute at his Texas home, according to a San Antonio Police Department report. Broussard claimed that Austin grabbed her, and she began struggling with him, who eventually threw her to the ground. Broussard landed on her hands and knees, and later told officers she had injured her right hand. Broussard provided a written statement to police, who photographed her injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/stone-cold-steve-austin-roughs-girlfriend |title=Stone Cold Steve Austin Roughs Up Girlfriend|website=[[The Smoking Gun]]|date=March 29, 2004|accessdate=November 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 29, 2007, Marshall told ''[[Fox News]]'' that Austin beat her three times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,286924,00.html|title=Pro Wrestling Wife Claims Drug Abuse, Domestic Violence 'Out of Hand in the WWE'|work=[[Fox News]]|date=June 27, 2007|accessdate=August 21, 2007|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6H4FzKhy1?url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,286924,00.html|archive-date=June 2, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also stated that WWE knew of the abuse, working to conceal the bruises on her face, and kept her from revealing that Austin hit her, as it would cost the company millions of dollars.&lt;ref name="Debra Fox"/&gt;

== Professional wrestling style and persona ==
During his early years as wrestler, Austin was a technical wrestler. However, after his neck injury against Owen Hart in 1997, he changed his style from technical to brawler.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wrestleview.com/faq/?style=light&amp;article=steveaustin&lt;/ref&gt; His most famous finishing move is the Stone Cold Stunner, or simply [[Stunner (professional wrestling)|Stunner]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/stone-cold-still-cant-believe-donald-trump-took-a-stunner-66125/&lt;/ref&gt; During his time as The Ringmaster he used the Million Dollar Dream as finisher, since it was Ted DiBiase's finisher. During his time in WCW, Austin used the Stun Gun as finisher.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/bret97review.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Austin's taunts during the Attitude Era was to show the middle finger.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.foxsports.com/wwe/story/steve-austin-interview-aj-styles-carried-roman-reigns-061416&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2001, Austin cut a promo, debuting his catchphrase "What?", which is used today by fans when they want to mock wrestlers during promos.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.foxsports.com/wwe/story/wwe-what-chants-need-to-stop-steve-austin-carmella-smackdown-120716&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://prowrestling.net/article.php?6-14-Reborn-Wrestling-Jake-Roberts-and-EZ-Money-meet-in-the-six-man-tag-main-event-of-a-Christian-based-pro-wrestling-show-37554&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tangendorf disc brooch'''&lt;ref&gt;Helms-Museum Inventory number: 63472 (according to Wegewitz 1941)&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Iron Age]] [[Fibula (brooch)|fibula]] from the 3rd century AD, which was dug up in 1930 from the sand of a [[Bronze Age]] [[tumulus]] near Tangendorf, [[Toppenstedt]], [[Harburg (district)|Harburg]], [[Lower Saxony]], Germany.&lt;ref name="Wegewitz1941"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wegewitz | first = Willi | authorlink = | title = Die Scheibenfibel von Tangendorf, Kr.

== Discovery ==
The Tangendorf disc brooch was found in 1930 in a [[tumulus]] (at {{coord|53.30202|10.076256|type:landmark_region:DE-NI|display=inline,title}}&lt;ref&gt;Archaeological Museum Hamburg: Regional File Tangendorf: [[GaussâKrÃ¼ger coordinate system|GaussâKrÃ¼ger coordinates]]: 3571825 5908330.&lt;/ref&gt;) on a parcel of land known as ''{{lang|de|Im schwarzen Dorn}}'' (in the black dorn), on the outer northwest corner of Tangendorf. While digging off sand from a Bronze Age grave mound in his field, farmer Heinrich Wille found the fibula together with a [[bronze]] hair clip ([[German Language|German]]: {{lang|de|Haarknotenfibel}})&lt;ref&gt;Image of a typical hair clip on [[Wikimedia Commons]]: [[:File:Haarknotenfibel Bahrendorf.jpg]]&lt;/ref&gt; and a bronze spear blade.&lt;ref name="Wegewitz1941" /&gt; The hair clip and the spear blade were passed to the Helms-Museum; however, the brooch was left with a teacher of the Tangendorf elementary school.&lt;ref name="Wegewitz1941" /&gt;

In the summer of 1938 the teacher asked Helms-Museum's director Willi Wegewitz to pick up a [[neolithic]] [[Stone tool|stone axe]]. While handing over the stone axe the brooch was rediscovered in a drawer, among the school's exercise equipment. The teacher was considering disposing of the brooch because he thought it was simply a worthless modern object without any archaeological significance. Wegewitz immediately arranged an [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] of the tumulus. The mound's original diameter of {{convert|16|m|ft}} was still clearly visible on the ploughed field and further remnants of a hair clip were discovered.&lt;ref name="Wegewitz1988"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wegewitz | first = Willi  | authorlink = | title = Die Scheibenfibel von Tangendorf  | journal = Hammaburg N.F. | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 148â150 | publisher = | location = | year = 1988 | language = German | issn = 0173-0886}}&lt;/ref&gt; The farmer revealed that he had found the brooch on the edge of the grave mound in the amount of the increased soil in sand; he had not noticed that ''ErdverfÃ¤rbungen'' (earth discolorations), might indicate a [[cremation]] burial.&lt;ref name="Wegewitz1941" /&gt;

== Findings ==
The fibula is a multilayered structure. Its face consists of a very thin [[Gilding|fire gilded]] and contoured [[silver]] disc, having a diameter of {{convert|58|mm|in}}. This is fixed by three silver rivet pins to an identically sized, {{convert|3|mm|in}} thick [[copper]] plate and together with this on a stronger silver plate. The rear plate, {{convert|78|mm|in}} in diameter, is significantly larger. On its rear, the pin was mounted. The reverse of the front plate was filled with a now whitish green mix of [[tin]], [[lead]] and traces of copper in order to support the sensitive friction work and to prevent the pressing of the driven ornaments. But the tin components of the filler have damaged some of the metal parts of the decoration due to [[Allotropy|allotropic]] processes forced by low temperatures during long term storage in the soil ([[tin pest]]). The decoration consists of a quadrupedal animal walking to the right, with the animals head facing backwards. It has two ears and a protruding tongue. Around its neck it wears a collar shaped ornament. The legs are positioned under the body to accommodate the round shape of the disc. The background is decorated with irregularly distributed impressions, imitating a [[Granulation (jewellery)|granulation]]. The scene is framed by two ribbed bands, which are enclosed by an ornamental wreath and another ribbed band. Around the body of the animal there are  three rosette shaped rivet heads. The body of the animal has a large defect caused by the degenerated tin filling. Some of the protruding edges of the rear mounting plate are broken away. Beneath the copper plate, residual amounts of organic material were found, which were interpreted as [[ivory]].&lt;ref name="Wegewitz1988" /&gt; Due to [[Typology (archaeology)|typological]] comparisons of the ornaments, the fibula was [[Dating methodologies in archaeology|dated]] to circa 300 AD.&lt;ref name="Wegewitz1988" /&gt;

== Interpretation ==
[[File:Tangendorf reco croped.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction by Hans Drescher (with broken ivory ring)]]

Due to the improper recovery without accurate documentation of the find, accurate statements can not be given about the [[archaeological context]] the disc brooch to the [[Iron Age]] burial and the Bronze Age secondary burial. It is also not known how many additional grave goods were lost. Compared to similar finds, all of these burials should have usually contained other jewellery and utensils. Based on the statements of farmer Wille, the Iron Age grave with the disc brooch was suspected to be a cremation burial, on top of a pre-existing burial mound, a suspicion which is supported from many other Iron Age grave findings. The brooch is a high-quality, most likely [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], [[goldsmith]]s' work, inspired by Roman models. The animal depicted is interpreted as a dog or an antler-less deer.&lt;ref name="Wegewitz1988" /&gt; The reason for the depiction of a rear-facing animal may be found in Germanic art conventions or it may based on mythological ideas,&lt;ref name="Wegewitz1941" /&gt; but it can also be attributed to the fact that it allows a larger depiction of the animal within the available space. The protruding edge of the rear silver disc and the remains of organic material beneath the copper disk suggests that the front plates of the fibula was surrounded by an ornate ring of ivory of about {{convert|10|mm|in}} width.&lt;ref name="Wegewitz1988" /&gt;

A similar, {{convert|55|mm|in}} diameter, disc brooch is known from a burial at [[Langen Jarchow|HÃ¤ven]] in [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], Germany, but depicts a forward-facing animal. The similarities in manufacture and decoration are so striking that Wegewitz believed they were produced in the same workshop.&lt;ref name="Wegewitz1988" /&gt; Parallels of the illustrated animal are known from archaeological finds on a silver goblet from [[Nordrup, Slagelse|Nordrup]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last =MÃ¼ller | first =Sophus| authorlink =Sophus MÃ¼ller | title =Ordning af Danmarks Oldsager: II, Jernaderen â 1888-1895 | publisher =C.

=== Reconstruction ===

After detailed analysis of the construction, Hans Drescher manufactured two reconstructions of the Tangendorf disc brooch, one copy for the Helms-Museum and the second for the [[Lower Saxony State Museum|NiedersÃ¤chsisches Landesmuseum Hannover]]. Drescher used ivory for the organic ring, giving a decorative contrast between its white color and the golden disc. Drescher published his detailed findings in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Drescher | first = Hans | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Die Nachbildung der Scheibenfibel aus Tangendorf  | journal =  Die Kunde N.F. | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 23â33 | publisher = NiedersÃ¤chsischer Landesverein fÃ¼r Urgeschichte | location = | year =  1955 | language = German | url = | jstor = | issn =  0342-0736 | doi = | id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Book of Tasty and Healthy Food''''' (''{{lang|ru|ÐÐ½Ð¸Ð³Ð° Ð¾ Ð²ÐºÑÑÐ½Ð¾Ð¹ Ð¸ Ð·Ð´Ð¾ÑÐ¾Ð²Ð¾Ð¹ Ð¿Ð¸ÑÐµ}}'', ''Kniga o vkusnoi i zdorovoi pishche'') is a [[Russian literature|Russian]] [[cookbook]] written by scientists from the [[Institute of Nutrition]] of the [[USSR Academy of Medical Sciences|Academy of Medical Sciences]] of the [[USSR]]. The cookbook was first published in 1939, and a further edition was published in 1952. An English translation (by Boris Ushumirskiy) appeared in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Book-Tasty-Healthy-Anastas-Mikoyan-ebook/dp/B00957AYR8]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Following the [[Russian Revolution]], the official ideology promoted communal food preparation and dining, to maximise use of labour and resources and to liberate women to work. However, combined with widespread food shortages, this resulted in poor food quality and limited choice.&lt;ref name=FT&gt;Russell, Polly; ''The history cook''; The Financial Times (FT Weekend Magazine), 17/18 August 2013, p36.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anastas Mikoyan]], who was People's Commissar of the Food Industry of the USSR in the 1930s, became convinced that the USSR needed to modernise the way it produced and consumed food. He travelled widely, bringing many innovations back to the USSR, including the manufacture of canned goods and the mass production of [[ice cream]]. In the late 1930s, he spearheaded a project to produce a home cookbook which would encourage a return to the domestic kitchen.&lt;ref name=FT/&gt;

Prior to its introduction, the staple cookbook of [[Russian cuisine]] had been [[Elena Molokhovets]]' ''[[A Gift to Young Housewives]]'', which had been published in numerous editions in late 19th- and early 20th-century Russia and remained in many households after the Revolution. However, as it had been aimed at middle- and upper-class households, it was frowned upon as being [[bourgeois]]. Moreover, many of its recipes relied on ingredients that were unavailable and techniques that were impractical in Soviet Russia. The new cookbook was thus aimed to become a [[reference work]] for the new [[Soviet cuisine]].

==Content==
As with most publications at this time in the USSR, the cookbook had both a practical and propagandistic purpose. On the practical side, it contained recipes using modern techniques and foods and provided advice on diet, hygiene and etiquette. As propaganda, it began with a chapter on the successes of the domestic food industry and its recipes combined ingredients from across the many republics of the USSR. Moreover, as many of these ingredients were usually unavailable, the cookbook also served as an image of what the USSR aspired to be, a land of abundance and variation.&lt;ref name=FT/&gt;

Recipes range from the sumptuous (sturgeon in jelly, cold piglet with horseradish) to the everyday (cabbage stuffed with meat, bean soup). They were accompanied with lavish full-page illustrations of prepared dishes and food production.&lt;ref name=FT/&gt;

==In popular culture==
British chef [[Mary Berry]] modified and improved one of the book's recipes, which combined herring with egg, on her [[BBC 2]] cookery program ''[[Easter Feasts]]'' (first aired April 13 2017).

'''The General Store''', constructed in 1840 in [[Shelburne, Vermont]], originally operated as the village [[post office]]. Its [[front-gable]] orientation, accentuated with a multi-paned, triangular [[pediment]]al window, reflects the popular [[Greek Revival]] style. &lt;ref&gt; Shelburne Museum. 1993. Shelburne Museum: A Guide to the Collections. Shelburne: Shelburne Museum, Inc. &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1952 the [[Shelburne Museum]] rolled the building to the grounds on a specially laid railroad track. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.vermonter.com/shelburne-museum-4.asp &lt;/ref&gt; The first level re-creates a late nineteenth-century [[general store]] with fully stocked shelves displaying the types of goods available for purchase. Smaller adjoining rooms offer a variety of community services including a post office, a barbershop, and a [[taproom]]. The adjacent wing houses a replication of a nineteenth-century [[Apothecary Shop]] that the museum added after moving the building to the grounds. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.shelburnemuseum.org/buildings_and_grounds/detail.php?id=10 &lt;/ref&gt;

The buildingâs second story exhibits medical equipment, tools, and furnishings spanning the first half of the 20th century. Replicated settings include a dentistâs laboratory and examining room, the offices of an [[ophthalmologist]], and those of an ear, nose, and throat physician. &lt;ref&gt; Hill, Ralph Nading and Lilian Baker Carlisle.

==History==
The organization began in Copenhagen in 2000 when the first Human Library event was held at [[Roskilde Festival]].&lt;ref name="rd"/&gt; The event was run by Ronni and Dany Abergel,&lt;ref name="rd"/&gt; Asma Mouna, Christoffer Erichsen, then working at the Danish Youth [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] Stop Volden (which translates to Stop the Violence), inspired by the American [[Stop the Violence Movement]]. The first event ran four days with eight hours of conversations each day and more than 1000 people took part.

The next Human Library was hosted in Oslo, Norway by Ronni Abergel for the Nordic Minister Councils youth assembly "Unge I Norden". The event was prepared in partnership with Terese Mungai-Foyn and went on to inspire the establishment of the Norwegian Human Library program in 2003. 

The first permanent Human Library was established in [[Lismore, Australia]] in 2006.&lt;ref name=Peveto2017/&gt;
