'''Albena Lake-Hodge Comprehensive School''' ('''ALHCS''') is the sole government secondary school of [[Anguilla]], in [[The Valley, Anguilla|The Valley]]. {{Asof|2017}} it had about 1,062 students. It has two campuses, A and B. Forms 1-2 go to campus B while forms 3-6 go to Campus A.&lt;ref name=schools&gt;"[http://www.gov.ai/schools.php Schools]." Government of Anguilla. Retrieved on December 7, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after [[Albena Lake-Hodge]].

It opened as '''The Valley Secondary School''' on 21 September 1953. Its first principal, J. T. Thom, was from [[Guyana]]. It received its current name in 1986. It previously served only Anguilla's elite, but became a universal secondary school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theanguillian.com/2014/06/celebrating-60-years-of-secondary-education-exhibition-now-open/|title=CELEBRATING 60 YEARS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION EXHIBITION NOW OPEN|publisher=''[[The Anguillan]]''|date=2014-06-27|accessdate=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 principal Ingrid Lake retired, so Joyce Webster became the principal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theanguillian.com/2015/09/alhcs-principal-i-will-be-fair-firm-loving/|title=ALHCS PRINCIPAL: "I WILL BE FAIR, FIRM, LOVING"|publisher=''[[The Anguillan]]''|date=2015-09-14|accessdate=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2016 the Anguillan government was developing a master plan for the school's redevelopment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theanguillian.com/2016/03/master-plan-to-redevelop-anguillas-comprehensive-school/|title=MASTER PLAN TO REDEVELOP ANGUILLA’S COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOL|publisher=''[[The Anguillan]]''|date=2016-03-29|accessdate=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Appreciative Inquiry''' is an approach that believes [[improvement]] is more engaging when the focus is made on the strengths rather than the weaknesses.   People tend to respond to positive statements but react to negative statements that concern them.  Children are more sensitive to their self-worth and thrive on what makes them feel good, what makes them feel accepted, included and recognized. [[AI]] is a powerful tool that can be used in the field of Education to enable children discover what is good about them and dream of what they can do with this realization.  Children of today{{when|date=May 2018}} are very sensitive and make decisions in haste which sometimes costs them their lives. In such a situation, [[AI]] plays a very vital role.

==Overview==
Appreciative Inquiry is the cooperative search for the best in people their organizations, and the world around them. It involves systematic discovery of what gives a system ‘life’ when it is most effective and capable in economic, ecological, and human terms. [[AI]] involves the art and practice of asking questions that strengthen a system's capacity to heighten positive potential. It mobilizes inquiry through crafting an “unconditional positive question’ often involving hundreds or sometimes thousands of people.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Appreciative Inquiry: A positive revolution in change|last = Cooperrider|first = David|publisher = In P. Holman &amp; T. Devane (eds.), The Change Handbook, Berrett-Koehler Publishers, Inc|year = 2005|pages = 245–263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
Applied in the [[education]] sector, [[AI]] is a cooperative search for the best in children, their school, their teachers, their classmates, their parents and this discovery influences and helps shape their image of the future. It all begins with a story which the appreciative inquirer tells about him/herself and this story is only about where the child has experienced the best of what he could e.g. in reading, writing, passing tests and exams. With this flow of energy from past experience, the child is poised for a similar experience in the future and so nurtures all that give energy and brings joy of performance, acceptance and readiness to move ahead.  [[AI]] starts with a statement of purpose or object of inquiry and which then takes the inquirer through the five steps (known as the 5Ds of AI) and graphically illustrated as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Essentials of Appreciative Inquiry; A Roadmap to Creating Positive Futures|last = Bernard J|first = Mohr|publisher = Pegasus Communications, Inc|year = 2002|location = |pages = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Refer the picture in&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.centerforappreciativeinquiry.net/more-on-ai/the-generic-processes-of-appreciative-inquiry/|title = The Essentials of Appreciative Inquiry; A Roadmap to Creating Positive Futures|website = Generic Processes of Appreciative Inquiry|last = Bernard J|first = Mohr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Appreciative Inquiry in the education sector can amplify the [[motivation]] of the students and help them become most alive and effective. [[AI]] brings about social change in the pupil as the emphasis is on what is good and the belief that people nurture what they appreciate, than what they are not happy about. The system of education can be based on the five principles of [[AI]] that will enable the child discover through her/his own story, what is good about him/her and dream of how he/she can capitalize on this story of goodness to do more of such things that he/she appreciates about himself, about his [[Biophysical environment|environment]], about his world.

==Principles==
A quick look at the principles will enable the understanding of why [[AI|AI i]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s suitable for our education system:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=5 Principles of Appreciative Inquiry |url=http://www.appreciativeinquiry.net.au/index.php/5-principles-of-appreciative-inquiry |website=www.appreciativeinquiry.net.au |accessdate=2015-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930155316/http://www.appreciativeinquiry.net.au/index.php/5-principles-of-appreciative-inquiry |archivedate=2015-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
i. Constructionist Principle – argues that the language and [[Metaphor|metaphors]] we use don't just describe reality (the world), they actually create ‘our ‘reality (the world).  It means that great care is taken in the choice of words that we use as it will influence the kind of future we create. The language of the teacher influences what the child considers as his/her reality and this influences his self-perception and hence his self-worth which is very important for what he/she becomes in future. 
ii. Principle of Simultaneity – change begins from the moment we ask a question about a thing. The heart of AI is an unconditional positive question. For example – what was the best thing that has happened to you in the last week? 
iii. The [[The Poetic Principle|Poetic Principle]] - as the topic of inquiry is on what is good about the individual or the environment, this helps open a new chapter in the life of the child. Stories reveal qualities which had not been previously realized and appreciated.
iv. The Anticipatory Principle – we grow into the images we create, hence, when the child is made to see himself as good, his imagination about his future will always be good enough and as magnet this imagined future will always pull the child towards this goal.
v. The Positive Principle – feelings of hope, [[Inspirational fiction|inspiration]], caring, sense of purpose, joy and creating something meaningful or being part of something good are among what we define as positive.  It is therefore, important that the questions asked to the child are affirmative and positive.

It allows a student to be potentially free from any kind of bondage or control. [[AI]] gives an opportunity for the students to showcase their innovative side rather than just rote memory. This in turn makes them [[Autonomy|autonomous]] learners. The students are able to understand their strengths every time their potentials are amplified. Use of this in the educational sector would bring about a sea of difference as there would be more room for amplifying the existing positive energy. Even the basic assumptions of [[AI]] which includes the assumption that ‘in every human situation, there is something that works” is a clear indication that no child is incapable of producing a result that would even surprise the child him/herself. All that the child needs are such questions that would enable him/her tap into the core of his/her being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Thin Book of Appreciative Inquiry|last = Hammond|first = Sue Annis|publisher = CSS publishing co|year = 1996|isbn = |location = Texas|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system of education which relies on an average test or examination grades label children who do not meet the marks as ‘failed’. [[AI]] in education enables the child to identify the subjects  where he/she is very satisfied with the performance, and through story, the child discovers what he/she did differently  and how to tap this aspect for more satisfaction. This is why AI is also referred as ‘locating the energy for change’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = An Introduction to Appreciative Inquiry Charles Elliott Dean of Trinity Hall University of Cambridge INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (IISD)|last = Elliott|first = Charles|publisher = Published by the International Institute for Sustainable Development|year = 1999|isbn = 1-895536-15-4|location = Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a search for what is good through stories and what needs to be done through dreams. [[AI]] brings a dream to reality because, motivation for the future depends on the images of success of the past.

==Educational reform movement==
One of the strands of educational reform movements in the last two decades has been the call for greater collaborative efforts, both among educators as well as with parents, students and the surrounding community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Contrived collegiality: The micropolitics of teacher collaboration.

These concerns point to the need for a change process that has a positive focus, is essentially [[Self-organization|self-organizing]], encourages deep reflection, and avoids the [[pitfalls]] of manipulation by [[school administrators]].

[[File:Logo Archivum Rhenanum.png|thumb|Archivum Rhenanum logo]]
The project '''Archivum Rhenanum - Archives numérisées du Rhin supérieur''' or "''Réseau transfrontalier de sources historiques numérisées : les archives comme mémoire de l’espace du Rhin supérieur et de sa formation''" in French ("''Digitale Archive am Oberrhein''" and "''Grenzüberschreitendes Netzwerk digitaler Geschichtsquellen: Archive als Gedächtnisse der historisch gewachsenen Landschaft Oberrhein''" in German) aimed to create a transnational Franco-German portal and an open network of archives. It was supported by institutions, associations and experts in history and civilization. Through this portal, the general public can now access digitized resources, along with further information about them, from archives on both sides of the border.

== The project ==

The German and French archives in [[Upper Rhine|the Upper Rhine]] region, ([[Baden]], [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]] and [[Alsace]]) hold unique manuscripts, some of which date from the [[Middle Ages]] and are a source of information about the history of the region and its economic, social and cultural evolution. However, only a small number of people have so far been able to access these resources: the obstacles posed by the language of the documents and the training required to understand them, the scripts used in manuscripts, and especially the dispersal of these resources among different archives have made it difficult for the general public to consult them.

The project's aim in developing the portal was to erase the border between France and Germany: through its content, it is by its very nature a bilingual, cross-border portal and an open network of different archives. The goal was to virtually reproduce the historical memory of the Upper Rhine region. This approach will allow the public to access the historical knowledge and collections of the Upper Rhine region, with the help of modern bilingual explanations of historical documents, and the use of new media (digitization online access, and communication platforms such as blogs).

The project covers the Middle Ages and the beginning of the [[Early Modern Period]] (16th century). In the past, people weren't particularly aware of the border, and natural borders such as the [[Rhine]] were 'permeable'",&lt;ref&gt;
    Kemper, Joachim, « Archive am Oberrhein werden digital. Stadtarchiv Speyer nimmt an grenzüberschreitendem Projekt teil », in ''Speyer. Das Vierteljahresheft des Verkehrsvereins in Zusammenarbeit mit der Stadtverwaltung'', 52/4, Winter 2012, P. 45s. (online access : http://de.slideshare.net/StadtASpeyer/archive-am-oberrhein-werden-digital)&lt;/ref&gt; which sources from the Middle Ages and the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] show clearly. It is expected that the portal will be expanded to cover more recent historical periods, up to and including the major conflicts between France and Germany in the 19th and 20th centuries: representing the border space over time and as a whole, from the height of its strength to its weaker periods would offer a meaningful and coherent perspective.&lt;ref&gt;
    Gilcher, Dagmar, « Rheinische Netzwerke. Digitale Archive am Oberrhein: Das grenzüberschreitende kulturelle Gedächtnis einer Region », in Die Rheinpfalz, 23.02.2013.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The partner institutions contributed to the project in various ways, including preparing and digitizing the historical source documents and making them available through the portal, developing a cross-border database ("Archivum Rhenanum"), which is also permanently accessible through the portal. Further initiatives include mediation with the general public about cultural heritage as "collective memory", through, for example, the development of a platform for discussion and communication with the public that is permanently maintained. Finally, steps were taken to ensure the preservation of the archival collections.

The project ran from 2013 to 2015 and is now finished.&lt;ref&gt;https://archives-fr.hypotheses.org/796, "Conférence de clôture du projet à la Bibliothèque Nationale Universitaire de Strasbourg", 01.07.2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Delfim Pinto dos Santos''' ([[Oporto]], Portugal, 1907 &amp;ndash; [[Cascais]], Portugal, 1966), was a Portuguese academic, philosopher, educationist, essayist and book and movie reviewer.

==Life==
Delfim Santos was born in [[Oporto, Portugal]] in 1907, to Arnaldo Pinto and Amelia dos Santos Oliveira. His father was a goldsmith and trained him for his craft, which Delfim successfully practiced as apprentice until Arnaldo's untimely death, occurred when the son was aged 15. Still under the impact of his recent orphan condition, the young Delfim kept the family business running for a while, only to become aware that his vocation and motivation lay elsewhere and thereby decided to pursue a lifelong engagement with study and intellectual quest. By that time he had converted from a non-religious upbringing to [[Protestantism]], and became an active member of the cultural and sportive activities of the Portuguese [[YMCA]].

By 1927, aged 20 (rather late according to average standards of 16/17) he completed high school and enrolled in the [[University of Porto]] Faculty of Arts graduating in History and Philosophy in 1931, being one of the last students of this famous school, closed by the authorities shortly after. He had [[:de:Leonardo Coimbra|Leonardo Coimbra]] and Teixeira Rego as his mentors during his student years and among his colleagues were [[Agostinho da Silva]] and [[:pt:Adolfo Casais Monteiro|Adolfo Casais Monteiro]].

Immediately after graduation he initiated a career as high school teacher, first in Oporto, then in Lisbon, where he made his ''aggregation exam'' required to become a teacher in state run Portuguese high-schools. Having applied to a fellowship to study under the guidance of [[Martin Heidegger]] at Freiburg, he was awarded against his will a similar position in [[Vienna, Austria]] where he settled by October 1935 as a fellow of the Portuguese Higher Culture Institute, to study under [[Moritz Schlick]], [[:de:Karl Bühler|Karl Bühler]] and [[Othmar Spann]], attending some of the famous Vienna Circle seminars, and writing his critical study on Logical Positivism entitled ''Positivism: a critical reappraisal'' (''Situação Valorativa do Positivismo'') which he presented as his two-years fellowship final report to the Portuguese funding entity. During the Winter Semester of 1936 he visited Berlin to meet [[Nicolai Hartmann]] and [[Eduard Spranger]]. Finally, he completed his critical survey of [[neopositivism]] by moving to the UK and studying with [[John Macmurray]] at the [[University College, London]], and with [[Charlie Dunbar Broad]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=EAD%2FGBR%2F0016%2FBROAD Papers of Charlie Dunbar Broad (1887-1971), philosopher]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George Edward Moore]] at the [[Trinity College (Cambridge)]], where the neopositivists had another stronghold (in 1939 the later was to be replaced by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://rabbit.trin.cam.ac.uk/~jon/Witt/Wittgenstein.html Papers of Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951), philosopher]&lt;/ref&gt; a former loose associate of the [[Vienna Circle]]).

By mid-1937 he returned to Portugal for a short leave and was summoned to take the position of Portuguese Language Lecturer at the Luso-Brazilian Institute of the [[University of Berlin]], a position he was actively seeking in order to become familiar with [[Existential phenomenology|phenomenology]]. In the German capital he attended regularly the philosophical seminar of [[Nicolai Hartmann]] while getting also acquainted with some prominent [[Martin Heidegger]]'s disciples like [[:de:Ernesto Grassi|Ernesto Grassi]]. Delfim Santos was among the first to introduce [[Martin Heidegger]] to a Portuguese audience in his 1938 essay ''Heidegger and Hölderlin or the Essence of Poetry'' (''Heidegger e Hölderlin ou a Essência da Poesia''). Meanwhile, Delfim received his PhD in 1940 from [[Coimbra University]] presenting a thesis on ''Knowledge and Reality'' (''Conhecimento e Realidade''), and returned to Berlin where he was to remain until 1942, the year in which he permanently resettled in Portugal.

In 1947 he attained the position of Assistant Professor of Pedagogy at [[Lisbon University]], submitting his essay on ''The Existential Foundations of Pedagogy'' (''Fundamentação Existencial da Pedagogia''), considered his most influential work among Portuguese and Brazilian educators and teachers, published in Portugal in 1946 and in Brazil in 1952. In 1950 he became the first Chair Professor of Pedagogy in Portugal. Among other subjects, he taught on [[Ancient Philosophy|History of Ancient Philosophy]], [[History of Education]], [[Ethics]] and School Administration. He also taught [[Psychology]] during several years in the [[Portuguese Military Academy]].

Delfim attended numerous international Philosophy congresses and symposia, namely the 9th International Congress of Philosophy - Descartes Congress, Paris, France 1937, the 10th International Congress of Philosophy - Amsterdam. Holland 1948, the 1949 'First National Philosophy Congress' in Mendoza, Argentina, organized by the [[University of Cuyo]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filosofia.org/ave/001/a137.htm Primer Congreso Nacional de Filosofía, Mendoza, Argentina, 30 marzo / 9 abril 1949]&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1st International Philosophy Congress of Brazil, São Paulo, Brazil, 1954, organized by [[Miguel Reale]]. He also took part in some of the celebrated [[Eranos]] seminars in Switzerland. Under his guidance a ''Center for Pedagogic Studies'' was created in 1962 by the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]], of which he became the Director until his early death, occurred in 1966, aged 58.

He was member of the [[Lisbon Academy of Sciences]] and exchanged personal correspondence with international scholars and writers such as [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Constantin Noica]], [[Hermann Hesse]], [[:de:Ernesto Grassi|Ernesto Grassi]] and [[:de:Michael de Ferdinandy|Michael de Ferdinandy]]. One high school and several streets were named after him in the Portuguese districts of Lisbon, Evora, and Matosinhos (Oporto). In 1965 he was awarded a decoration by the Education Secretary of the city of São Paulo, Brazil.

==Works==
Most of his writings were assembled in four volumes published by the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]], ranging from philosophical and educational themes to cultural and issues of his time. His main books are:

*''Positivism: a critical reappraisal'' (''Situação Valorativa do Positivismo''), 1938.
*''On Philosophy'' (''Da Filosofia''), 1940.
*''Knowledge and Reality'' (''Conhecimento e Realidade''), 1940.
*''The Existential Foundations of Pedagogy'' (''Fundamentação Existencial da Pedagogia''), 1946.
*''History of Philosophy in Portugal'' (''O Pensamento Filosófico em Portugal''), 1946.

Aware of the cinema educational and formative potential, he wrote a number of movie reviews, namely on ''The Prodigal Son'' ([[Luis Trenker]], Germany 1934), ''[[The Third Man]]'' ([[Carol Reed]], USA 1949) and ''[[Umberto D.]]'' ([[Vittorio de Sica]], Italy 1952).

==Main topics==
Delfim's philosophical writings cover the study of modern and contemporary European thinkers, specially the contemporary German [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenologists]], adopting the ''[[aporia|aporetic]]'' and anti-systematic approach to philosophical inquiry similar to onto-phenomenologist [[Nicolai Hartmann]]. Also from Hartmann's 'levels of reality' he adapted and further developed his own ''pluriversal'' or rather ''pluriregional'' views on 'reality', ascribing the scientific method of study exclusively to the material world and not to philosophical matters as the [[Neopositivism|neopositivists]] propounded. He wrote comprehensively about the history of philosophical thinking in Portugal and Brazil, particularly on [[:pt:Silvestre Pinheiro Ferreira|Silvestre Pinheiro Ferreira]] (1769–1846) arguably Brazil's first philosopher, and on [[Francisco Suárez]] (1548–1617), a Spanish scholar active at [[Coimbra University]] between 1597 and 1616.

In Education his work was highly influential to the renewal of Portuguese pedagogical ideas, aiming at an existential synthesis between Philosophy and Pedagogy. Delfim made extensive public proposals towards a complete reform of the Portuguese educational system from kindergarten to university, showing a strong concern for professional instruction and apprenticeship; he recommended [[characterology]] as an auxiliary to vocational guidance and published several essays on foreign pedagogues, namely on [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]] and [[Maria Montessori]], making also pioneering research on some of the most prominent Portuguese educationalists, notably [[:pt:Almeida Garrett|Almeida Garrett]] (1799–1854) and [[:pt:Adolfo Coelho|Adolfo Coelho]] (1847–1919).

In the literary and aesthetic field he was one of the directors of the [[:pt:A Águia|Journal ''A Águia'']] and one of the ideologues of the [[:pt:Presença (revista)|Presença]] literary movement, (the so-called "Portuguese Second [[Modernism]]) which favored 'psychologism' by paying special attention to the protagonists' inner thoughts and conflicts of conscience, and articulated the Portuguese editions of German author [[Hermann Hesse]], 1946 Literature [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel laureate]], whose work was deeply inspired by educational issues.

:''For other people of the same name, see [[Dennis Scott (disambiguation)]].''
'''Dennis Scott''' (16 December 1939 – 21 February 1991) was a [[Jamaica]]n [[poet]], [[playwright]], [[actor]] (best known for appearances on ''[[The Cosby Show]]'') and [[dancer]]. His well-known poem "Marrysong" is used in the [[IGCSE]] syllabus. He was also a theatre director and drama teacher.

==Biography==

Born in 

[[Kingston, Jamaica]], Scott attended [[Jamaica College]], where he became headboy. He was further educated at the [[University of the West Indies]] (UWI), [[Mona, Jamaica|Mona]], and taught in Jamaica, [[Trinidad and Tobago]] (at [[Presentation College, San Fernando|Presentation College]]), and at [[Yale University]] in the [[United States]]. While at UWI he was the assistant editor of ''Caribbean Quarterly''. Thereafter, he went to [[Athens, Georgia]], on a Shubert Playwriting Fellowship (1970–71), and was later awarded a Commonwealth Fellowship to take an education diploma course in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[England]]. He returned to teach at [[Jamaica College]], and then became director of the School of Drama at the Cultural Training Centre in Kingston.&lt;ref&gt;Ian D. Smith, Dennis Scott biography, in [[Daryl Cumber Dance]] (ed.), ''Fifty Caribbean Writers: A Bio-Bibliographical Critical Sourcebook'', Greenwood Press, 1986, p. 428.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott taught at the [[Yale School of Drama]], and was head of the Directing program from 1986 until his death, which occurred in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], at the age of 51.

==Poetry and plays==
Scott was one of the most significant poets writing in the early post-independence period in Jamaica, and his first published collection, ''Uncle Time'' (1973), for which he won the [[Commonwealth Poetry Prize]], is marked by an effective literary use of the vernacular, or "[[nation language]]". He has been regarded as one of the main influences for modern Jamaican poetry. His other poetry collections are ''Dreadwalk: Poems 1970–78'' (1982), ''Strategies'' (1989) and ''After-Image'' (2008).

His plays include ''Terminus'' (1966), ''Dog'', and ''An Echo in the Bone'' (1974); the latter was published, together with a play by [[Derek Walcott]] and one by [[Errol Hill]], in ''Plays for Today'' (1985), edited by Hill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jrank.org/literature/pages/5680/Dennis-Scott.html Dennis Scott: Biography - (1939–91).]&lt;/ref&gt; Scott's dramatic work is acknowledged as a major influence on the direction of Caribbean theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peepaltreepress.com/author_display.asp?au_id=144 Author profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091104001905/http://www.peepaltreepress.com/author_display.asp?au_id=144 |date=4 November 2009 }} at Peepal Tree Press website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acting==
Scott was an original member of the [[National Dance Theatre Company]] founded by [[Rex Nettleford]] in the 1960s. Scott is also known for his role as Lester Tibedeaux in the ''[[Cosby Show]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11736">The '''Designation Scheme''' is an [[England|English]] system that awards "Designated status" to museum, library and archive collections of national and international importance.

The Scheme was first launched in 1997 under the auspices of what eventually became the [[Museums, Libraries and Archives Council]] (MLA) and originally covered only museum collections. [[Harewood House]] became the first stately home to be awarded Designated status in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-first-stately-museum-of-england-1196544.html The first stately museum of England], ''[[The Independent]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme was expanded to cover libraries and archives in 2005. Responsibility was transferred to the Arts Council in October 2011 following the closure of the MLA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/news/arts-council-news/museums-and-libraries-formally-transfer-arts-counc/.| title = Arts Council - Museums and libraries formally transfer to Arts Council England| accessdate = 10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Greece|Greek]] [[education]]al system is mainly divided into three levels: primary, secondary and tertiary, with an additional post-secondary level providing vocational training. Primary education is divided into kindergarten lasting one or two years, and primary school spanning six years (ages 6 to 12). Secondary education comprises two stages: [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasio]] (variously translated as Middle or Junior High School), a three-year school, after which students can attend [[Lyceum|Lykeion]] or Vocational lykeion. Higher Tertiary education is provided by [[List of universities in Greece|Universities]], [[List of universities in Greece|Technological Universities (T.E.I.)]] and [[List of universities in Greece|Academies]] which primarily cater for the military and the clergy. Undergraduate courses typically last 4 years (5 in polytechnics and some technical/art schools, and 6 in medical schools), [[postgraduate]] ([[MSc]] level) courses last from 1 to 2 years and [[doctorates]] ([[PhD]] level) from 3 to 6 years.

All levels are overseen by the [[Ministry of Education, Research and Religious Affairs]]. The Ministry exercises centralized control over state schools, by prescribing the curriculum, appointing staff and controlling funding. Private schools also fall under the mandate of the Ministry, which exercises supervisory control over them. At a regional level, the supervisory role of the Ministry is exercised through Regional Directorates of Primary and Secondary Education, and Directorates of Primary and Secondary Education operate in every Prefecture. Tertiary institutions are nominally autonomous, but the Ministry is responsible for their funding, and the distribution of students to undergraduate courses. Currently the Greek government only recognises the degree programmes offered by the state-run universities although there are several private universities and colleges offering degree programmes that are validated and overseen by American, British and other European universities. The Greek government is pressured to recognise these overseas programmes.

All levels of education are catered for by both private and public schools. State-run schools and universities do not charge tuition fees and textbooks are provided free to all students, although, from 2011 onwards, there has been a noticeable shortage of new textbooks, forcing students to either buy stock books from bookshops, or participate in parent-teacher association-run book trades. 
There are also a number of private tutorial schools, colleges and universities operating alongside the state education and providing supplementary tuition. These parallel schools ([[Greek language|Greek:]] ''φροντιστήριο, frontistirio (singular)'') provide foreign language tuition, supplementary lessons for weak students as well as exam preparation courses for the competitive [[Apolytirion|Panhellenic national examinations]]. Most of the students typically attend such classes (and examinations) at the tutors schools in the afternoon and evening in addition to their normal schooling.

==Primary education==
[[File:Astros public school.jpg|thumb|The public school of [[Astros, Greece|Astros]], built in 1915.]]

Before the Elementary school, kids must attend the [[Kindergarten]] from age 5 to 6 before moving to the Elementary School.Elementary schools are called "''Dimotiko''" (demotic, meaning municipal), a carryover term from a time when such schools were run by local communities.  The name remains although it has been obsolete for decades.  In the first two years pupils are not officially graded, and parents obtain feedback about their performance via oral communications with teachers.  Grading begins in Year 3, and written exams are introduced in Year 5.  Graduating from one year to the next is automatic, and pupils with deficient performance are given remedial tutoring.  Years are called "classes", from first to sixth:

As mentioned above, the students must take the Panhellenic national Examinations in order to proceed to the Higher Tertiary education. These exams are held after the students have received their Apolytirion which is same with the General's Lyceum and their level 4 Certificate. The students pass into a specific Higher Educational Institute based on the Orientation and Group chosen.Starting from 2018, the students of the 3rd grade will give 2 subjects of general education and all the theory subjects of their specialty for the school exams because of the Panhellenic Exams. If some students don't want to continue into tertiary education, they can select the "apprenticeship" to upgrade their certificate to level 5.

==Private schools==
[[File:Arsakeion Sxoli 1867 004.JPG|thumb|[[Arsakeio]] School of Athens, 1867]]

There is a wide range of private schools in Greece. 6% of students who attend compulsory education (the highest percent in the European Union) study in Private Schools. Tuition fees start from €1,500 to €13,000 according to the school and the year.

==School elections==
From the fifth year of the primary school to the third year of Lyceum elections are held.

&lt;big&gt;'''Elections in primary schools'''&lt;/big&gt;

They are held every September. All the students are obliged to elect 2 presidiums for each class who "rule" until January when the other one succeeds the first. The role of these presidiums is to primp the classrooms for the national holidays and for Christmas. Furthermore, they transfer the complaints of each student to the school authorities.

There are 4 positions:

*The President
*The Vice-President
*The General Secretary
*The Treasurer

&lt;big&gt;'''Elections in Gymnasiums and Lyceums'''&lt;/big&gt;

They are held every September and are divided into 2 parts.

In the 1st part every student elects the Presidium of his/her class.

The Class Presidium has 5 members:

*The President
*The General Secretary
*The Treasurer
*The 1st Member
*The 2nd Member

In the second part students elect a School Council which has 15 members and represents the students. Its role is extremely important in every school because the School Council takes significant decisions for all the students.

The School Council has 15 members:

*The School President
*The Vice-President
*The Treasurer
*Another 12 Members

==Tertiary education in Greece==
[[File:Ionian Academy in daylight 2.JPG|thumb|180px|View of the [[Ionian Academy]], [[Corfu]]]]
[[File:TUC library.jpg|thumb|180px|The library of the [[Technical University of Crete]], [[Chania]]]]

* '''Ανώτατα Εκπαιδευτικά Ιδρύματα - Α.E.I.''' (Higher Educational Institutes)
Higher Educational Institutes are consisted of two parallel sectors: the Technological Universities (T.E.I.) and the Universities. In addition, colleges collaborating with foreign universities can offer undergraduate and postgraduate UK foreign programmes of study in Greece, under the proper registration with the Greek Ministry of Education. Usually, these programmes are provided following franchise or validation agreements with universities established in other European Union countries, primarily in the UK, leading to degrees which are awarded directly by those universities. In some cases these institutions are wholly owned and operated branch campuses of foreign institutions, as in the case of the [[University of Indianapolis]], [[University of Indianapolis - Athens Campus|Athens Campus]]. [[List of universities in Greece]]

According to the [[European University Association]], [[Greek government-debt crisis countermeasures|austerity measures]] imposed after the 2010 bailout halved public funding for higher education in [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|real terms]] between 2009 and 2014; Greece now spends an average of €545 per student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1= Jack Grove |title= Crowded Houses: Are EU Students Feeling the Squeeze?| url= https://www.insidehighered.com/sites/default/server_files/media/europe-analysis-220115-large.jpg?width=500&amp;height=500 | work =[[Times Higher Education]]| date =January 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spending cuts were such that eight Greek universities, including the [[University of Athens]], had to close down temporarily in fall 2013 because they lacked the staff to keep the university running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1= Helena Smith |title= Austerity measures push Greek universities to point of collapse|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/25/austerity-measures-push-greek-universities-collapse|work=The Guardian |date= September 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prospective students do not have to take entrance exams in Greece. Admission is based on one’s high school results.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Education in Greece|url = https://tranio.com/greece/education/|work=Tranio |date= March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Private education==
* There are public and private ''dimotika'' (primary education), ''gymnasia'' (middle school; secondary education), ''lykeia'' (high school; secondary education). Some of them are for foreigners, usually children of British or American families. For example, see [[American Community Schools]].
* Public and private [[IEK]]
* According to the article 16 of the [[Constitution of Greece|Greek constitution]], private tertiary education was not allowed in Greece. However, there were some Schools (or "Laboratories") of Liberal Studies (Ergastiria Eleftheron Spoudon), often franchises of foreign universities, sometimes non-profit organizations, which advertised themselves as private universities or as centers from public universities abroad. For example, see [http://www.dei.edu.gr/ DEI College/University of London International Programmes and UCLan], [[I.S.T. College/University of Hertfordshire]], [[New York College (European and American Education)]]&lt;!--- per www.nyc.gr ---&gt;, [[BCA Business College of Athens]], [[ALBA Graduate Business School]], [[University of Wales, Bangor]], [[Mediterranean College]], [[Deree College]], [http://www.ait.gr Athens Information Technology Center of Excellence for Research and Education] etc. &lt;!--There is a comprehensive list [http://www.thought.de "Private Universities in Greece"] with more information on the situation.--&gt;
* Following changes in the Greek legislation, in 2008 and 2010, private organisations, referred to as colleges, have been authorised to offer foreign undergraduate and postgraduate programmes under the monitoring of the Greek Ministry of Education, for example [[iCon College]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

All levels are overseen by the [[Ministry of Culture, Education and Religious Affairs]], which exercises centralised control over public schools, by prescribing the curriculum, appointing staff, and controlling funding. The ministry exercises a supervisory mandate over private schools. At a regional level, the supervisory role of the Ministry is exercised through Regional Directorates of Primary and Secondary Education, and Directorates of Primary and Secondary Education operate in every Prefecture. Tertiary institutions are nominally autonomous, but the Ministry is responsible for their funding, and the distribution of students to undergraduate courses. Currently the Greek government only recognises degree programmes offered by the state-run universities although there are several private universities and colleges offering degree programmes that are validated and overseen by American, British and other European universities. The Greek government is pressured to recognise these overseas programmes.

All levels of education are catered for by both private and public schools. State-run schools and universities do not charge tuition fees and textbooks are provided free to all students, although, from 2011 onwards, there has been noticed a shortage in new textbooks, forcing students to either buy stock books from bookshops, or participate in parent-teacher association-run book trades.

There are also a number of private tutors schools, colleges and universities operating alongside the state education and providing supplementary tuition. These parallel schools, called [[Frontistirio]] (Greek: φροντιστήριο) provide foreign-language tuition, supplementary lessons for weak students, as well as exam preparation for the competitive [[Apolytirion|Panhellenic national examinations]]. Most of the students typically attend such classes (and examinations) at the tutors schools in the afternoon and evening in addition to their normal schooling.

==Vocational education and training==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
* '''[[IEK|I.E.K. - Ινστιτούτο Επαγγελματικής Κατάρτισης]]''' (''Institouto Epagelmatikis Katartisis'' - Vocational Training Institute). O.E.E.K. is the government organization which oversees these institutes.
* Private EES schools often offer seminars and 1-year vocational programmes, usually for Computing or Business studies. Young Greeks can seek private vocational education using the [[computer software]] products ''Eurofasma'' and ''Kefaleo'' (Capital).

==Obsolete institutions==
* '''Τεχνικό Επαγγελματικό Εκπαιδευτήριο, ΤΕΕ''' (''Techniko Epagelmatiko Ekpedeftirio'' - Technical Professional/Vocational School, TEE)
* '''Τεχνικό Επαγγελματικό Λύκειο, ΤΕΛ''' (''Techniko Epagelmatiko Lykeio'' - Technical Professional/Vocational Lyceum, TEL)
* '''Τεχνική Επαγγελματική Σχολή, ΤΕΣ''' (''Techniki Epagelmatiki Scholi'' - Technical Professional/Vocational School, TES)
* '''Ενιαίο Πολυκλαδικό Λύκειο, ΕΠΛ''' (''Eniaio Polykladiko Lykeio'' - Unified Multidisciplinary Lyceum, EPL)

==Current issues==
The foremost topic of debate in recent years has been recognition of the private universities, which are forbidden by the 1975 constitution.  Numerous private institutions, which are often franchises of European and American universities, such as [[State University of New York]], but also non-profit accredited institutions or wholly owned and operated branch campuses of foreign universities, such as the [[University of Indianapolis]] - [[University of Indianapolis - Athens Campus|Athens Campus]], are operating legally as EES schools (translatable as "Laboratories of Free Study").

Moreover, with few exceptions, the Greek government refuses to recognize three-year university degrees. Students who completed a bachelor's degree in a foreign country find it difficult to secure employment in the public sector, unless they next obtain a master's degree, in which case their academic qualifications are considered equivalent to a four-year undergraduate degree conferred by a Greek higher educational institute.

Following pressure from the EU member states, within the framework of the [[Bologna Process]], Greece is revising its classification of degrees to bring it in line with the framework defined in the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System/ECTS. (It is usually the goal to accomplish a bachelor's degree within 3 years and a master's degree within 2 years.)

'''Elaborative interrogation''' is one of a simple strategy used for the enhancement of memory during the process of learning. This method involves the prompting learner to read the fact-to-be-remembered and generate an explanation for it. The learner uses questions like Why? and How? to understand the meaning of the information, for example, Why do leaves of a tree fall during winter? or How do falling of leaves occur during winter?. Elaboration technique that is used here aids in clarifying the relationship that exists between the subject(leaves) and the predicate (fall during winter)in the given information. And as a result, the clarifying relationship that was seen is basically drawn from the memory however, the exact prior knowledge that is required for this is not clear. Some researchers emphasize on the importance of knowledge on the subject while others give importance towards knowing the abstract details of the information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tim Seifert |url=https://www.mun.ca/educ/faculty/mwatch/vol2/seifert.html |title=Learning Strategies in the Classroom |publisher=Mun.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
* There is an integration of new facts with the prior knowledge of the learner.
* This method benefits learners across a relatively wide range of age.
* It can be used by students of varying ability levels.
* Learners were able to generate an adequate answer which is better than no answer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiana.edu/~pcl/rgoldsto/courses/dunloskyimprovinglearning.pdf |title=Improving Students’ Learning With Effective Learning Techniques: Promising Directions From Cognitive and Educational Psycholo |publisher=Webcache.googleusercontent.com |date=2012-12-19 |accessdate=2015-09-20 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201153451/http://www.indiana.edu/~pcl/rgoldsto/courses/dunloskyimprovinglearning.pdf |archivedate=2016-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational implications==
* Students are taught on, how to generate questions as well as find answers for the given fact/information.
* Students learn to share their thoughts, justify and defend for the individual's derivation of the answer. 
* Students can also form, analyze and clarify their content.&lt;ref&gt;{{title=How To: Use Elaborative Interrogations |journal=Learning Sciences International|date=2012|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Electronic Classroom of Tomorrow''' (ECOT) was a community/[[charter school]] based in [[Columbus, Ohio]], United States. It was sponsored by the [[Lucas County, Ohio|Lucas County]] Educational Service Center of Lake Erie West (ESCLEW) in [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], in accordance with chapter 3314 of the [[Ohio Revised Code]].

Students performed their work either via computers which they already owned, or which were supplied to them by the school. Work was performed online via secure [[intranet]] connections.

==History==
ECOT was founded in 2000 by William "Bill" Lager, under an agreement with [http://www.lucas.k12.oh.us/ Lucas County Educational Service Center], and was managed by his company, Altair Learning Management.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/19/us/online-charter-schools-electronic-classroom-of-tomorrow.html | title=Online School Enriches Affiliated Companies if Not Its Students | work=The New York Times | date=19 May 2016 | accessdate=18 May 2016 | author=Rich, Motoko}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Columbus"&gt;{{cite news | author = Bill Bush and Jennifer Smith Richards |url = http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2015/01/04/popular-ecot-poor-performer.html | title = Popular ECOT poor performer | work = Columbus Dispatch | date = 2015-01-04 | accessdate = 2018-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lager made extensive contributions to Ohio Republican politicians.&lt;ref name="DK1"&gt;{{cite news | last = Akadjian | first = David | date = 2018-07-08 | title = ECOT: $2.1 million in donations to Ohio politicians, $1 billion in charter school contracts | url = https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2018/7/8/1777984/-ECOT-2-1-million-in-donations-to-Ohio-politicians-1-billion-in-charter-school-contracts | work = Daily Kos | access-date = 2018-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Ohio Department of Education determined that ECOT had been overstating the number of students it served, and demanded repayment of $80 million in state funding.&lt;ref name="DK1" /&gt; ECOT disputed this, disagreeing with the way the state calculated student participation. In January 2018 ECOT then offered a lower settlement amount&lt;ref name="PD1"&gt;{{cite news | last = O'Donnell | first = Patrick | date = 2018-01-17 | title = ECOT makes "final offer" to reduce penalties to stay open | url = http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2018/01/ecot_makes_final_offer_to_redu.html | work = Cleveland Plain-Dealer | access-date = 2018-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, but the department refused that offer and insisted on full repayment. In turn, the board of ECOT's sponsor (Educational Service Center of Lake Erie West) voted to close the school immediately.&lt;ref name="PD2"&gt;{{cite news | last = O'Donnell | first = Patrick | date = 2018-01-18 | title= ECOT closing: Sponsor votes to shut online school after state rejects settlement offer | url = https://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2018/01/ecot_sponsor_votes_to_close_the_online_school_after_state_rejects_settlement_offer.html | work = Cleveland Plain-Dealer | access-date  = 2018-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, the state auditor issued a subpoena to preserve and obtain records from ECOT in the event that the dispute rose to a criminal case.&lt;ref name="NH1"&gt;{{cite news | last  = Franko | first = Kantele | date = 2018-05-04 | title = Ohio auditor subpoenaing data from closed online school ECOT | url = http://www.news-herald.com/general-news/20180504/ohio-auditor-subpoenaing-data-from-closed-online-school-ecot | work = The News-Herald | access-date  = 2018-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulatory status==

Under Ohio law, "community schools" are independent public schools that offer school choice to parents, students and teachers. They are accountable to the public by a contract with a sponsor, such as a school district, or the [[Ohio Department of Education]] (ODE). In ECOT's case, the school was accountable to ESCLEW and its publicly elected Board. Community schools cannot charge tuition and must follow all laws pertaining to health, public safety and civil rights.

Students were required to take state-mandated proficiency/achievement tests, and other examinations prescribed by law. Students were also required to pass the [[Ohio Graduation Test]] to receive a diploma.

ECOT was not a "[[homeschooling|home schooling]]" program. It was a public community school, subject to all the laws and regulations thereof.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Students were expected to put in 25 hours of educational work per week during the school year. This work could be divided between online live sessions and independent or extracurricular activities.  The time spent is comparable to the time that students in "brick-and-mortar" schools are also expected to attend. Attendance need not adhere to traditional time conventions however; Affording flexibility to students and families not typically available in traditional educational settings.  However, ECOT was unable to demonstrate that the majority of students met this requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2017/06/state_school_board_votes_to_recover_60_million_from_ecot_online_school.html|title=State school board votes to recover $60 million from ECOT online school |first=Patrick |last=O'Donnell |newspaper=The Plain Dealer|location=Cleveland|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Elementary School K-3rd grades.
Jr. High 4-6th grades. 
Middle School 7th &amp; 8th grades. 
High school 9-12th grades.

Each school was supervised by its own principal, except in the high school. Due to the number of students that were enrolled, there were 4 principals.

==Graduates==

The school's first graduation ceremonies were held in the [[Ohio State House]]. In later years, larger venues became necessary due to Public Occupancy Limits, and, up until the closure in 2018, were being held at [[Jerome Schottenstein Center]]. ECOT typically had the largest graduating classes of any single schools in the United States.  ECOT's Class of 2013 included more than 2,500 graduates.

==Criticism==

While ECOT graduated large high school classes (2,371 students in 2016), more students dropped out of ECOT or failed to finish high school within four years than at any other school in the country. In 2014, the graduation rate was under 39%. Lager claimed that that was because many students arrived at the school behind, affected by poverty, special needs, and mobility, but fewer ECOT students came from low-income families than in urban schools, and three-quarters were white. Without physical classrooms, and with high pupil-to-teacher ratios, they could not provide support in person. Guidance counselors carried caseloads of up to 500 students each, and the school-wide pupil-teacher ratio was 30 to one.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

An Ohio Republican state senator said, “When you take on a difficult student, you’re basically saying, ‘We feel that our model can help this child be successful. And if you can’t help them be successful, at some point you have to say your model isn’t working, and if your model is not working, perhaps public dollars shouldn’t be going to pay for it.”&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

Critics said that companies that associated with Lager profited from government funding, but did not have the delivered value. In fiscal year 2014, ECOT paid companies that associated with Lager nearly $23 million, or 1/5 of its $115 million government revenue.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

“The growth has been huge,” said Aaron Churchill, of the [[Thomas B. Fordham Institute]]. “There are clearly a lot of questions about the quality of the education they’re putting out. I’d be curious to know why parents are selecting it. Aaron Churchill also commented that the graduation rate of ECOT and online schools are not accurately depicted by using the standard ACGR. [He] provides the example that if [a] student comes to ECOT after 3 years of failing in public high school, [the student is] counted against ECOT.  ECOT, according to the State of Ohio, has 49.3% of its students deemed as public school drop outs. ”&lt;ref name="Columbus"/&gt;

ECOT spent almost $11 million on communications in 2014, which included advertising. About half of ECOT’s revenue went to employee salaries and benefits, compared with about 80% in traditional districts.&lt;ref name="Columbus"/&gt;

Critics say that ECOT owed its existence to its lavish campaign donations, mostly to Ohio Republicans. Lager has spent at least $1.13 million on Ohio campaigns from 2010 to 2015.&lt;ref name="Columbus"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2983">The '''Entry Level Certificate''' ('''ELC''') is a [[wikt:qualification|qualification]] offered in [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. It lies at [[Entry Level]] of the [[National Qualifications Framework]], pitching it just below [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE]] level.

==The qualification==

ELCs are available in a variety of subjects, such as [[English studies|English]], [[Mathematics|Maths]], [[Science]], [[French language|French]], [[Life Skills]] and [[Childcare]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wjec.co.uk/index.php?subject=30&amp;level=6&lt;/ref&gt;

The qualifications are targeted at those who struggle to access the mainstream curriculum, such as students with [[special educational needs]]. Most students take the qualifications in school at ages 14–16, as an alternative to GCSEs, but many adults also take them.

Students are assessed through a combination of [[coursework]], [[controlled assessment]] and [[examinations]], depending on the qualification.

ELCs are offered by a number of [[examination board]]s, including [[Assessment and Qualifications Alliance|AQA]], [[Council for the Curriculum, Examinations &amp; Assessment|CCEA]], [[Edexcel]], [[Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations|OCR]] and [[Welsh Joint Education Committee|WJEC]].

==Grading==

A student successfully completing an ELC is awarded one of the following grades, which are common to all Entry Level qualifications:

* Entry 3 (highest)
* Entry 2
* Entry 1 (lowest)

Those who do not reach the level for Entry 1 are recorded as uncertified (U) and do not have the subject appear on their results certificates.

Entry 1, Entry 2 and Entry 3 are broadly equivalent to [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]] Levels 1, 2 and 3 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.aqa.org.uk/over/qual/elc.php&lt;/ref&gt;

When converting qualifications to school attainment points, Entry  1 is worth 10 points, Entry 2 is worth 12 and Entry 3 is worth 14. This compares to 16 points for GCSE Grade G (the lowest GCSE pass) and 22 points for GCSE Grade F.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wjec.co.uk/uploads/publications/5368.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Entry Level Certificate was launched as the Certificate of Achievement&lt;ref&gt;http://web.aqa.org.uk/over/stat_results_archive.php#elc&lt;/ref&gt; (Certificate of Educational Achievement if offered by WJEC&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jcq.org.uk/attachments/published/917/GCSE%2C%20Entry%20Level%2C%20GNVQ%20Results%20Summer%202001.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;) in September 1996,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=303496&lt;/ref&gt; with the first awards being made in 1998. The grades were originally known as Distinction (now Entry 3), Merit (Entry 2) and Pass (Entry 1).&lt;ref&gt;http://store.aqa.org.uk/over/stat_pdf/AQA-COA-JUN00.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Entry Level Certificate was adopted from the 2001 award onwards.

The '''Errol Solomon Meyers Memorial Lecture''' (E.S. Meyers Memorial Lecture) is an annual free public Lecture hosted by the [[University of Queensland Medical Society]] (UQMS) in Brisbane.

Professor [[Errol Solomon Meyers]] was a founding father of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Queensland, which was established in 1936 after five decades of advocacy for a medical school in Queensland. A pioneer in professional health education in Queensland, Professor Meyers was a leader in postgraduate medical education and undergraduate and postgraduate dental education prior to the establishment of the Faculties of Medicine and Dentistry at the [[University of Queensland]]. In July 1957, one year after the death of this founding father, the University of Queensland Medical Society established the E.S. Meyers Memorial Lecture to honour his contributions to medicine in general, and to his role as one of the most significant founders of the Medical School in particular.

As a reflection of the ethos of Professor Meyers’ life, this Memorial Lecture comprises a forum for a person of distinction to present a perspective of endeavour and achievement. Past speakers include biologist Lord [[Robert Winston]], cricketer and politician Mr [[Imran Khan]], Nobel Laureate Professor [[Peter Doherty (scientist)|Peter Doherty]], author Lord [[Jeffrey Archer]] and mountaineer and diplomat Sir [[Edmund Hillary]].

==Professor Errol Solomon Meyers==
[[File:Portrait ES Meyers.png|thumb|right|150px|Errol Solomon Meyers]]
{{Main article|Errol Solomon Meyers}}Professor Errol Solomon Meyers was a key founder of the University of Queensland School of Medicine. From 1925, he was a leader in postgraduate medical education courses conducted at the [[British Medical Association]] (Queensland Branch), and was the doyen of surgical anatomy. A general surgeon and teacher of outstanding ability, Professor Meyers taught anatomy and surgical dissection to dental students in Brisbane from 1922, establishing an Anatomy School within the dental hospital in George Street in 1927. From that time Dr Meyers brought the strength of his considerable personality to bear on the need to establish a School of Medicine in Queensland, a triumph achieved finally on 13 March 1936.

Education was one of Professor Myers’ passions. Discussions around the need for a medical faculty in Queensland began as early as 1893, and from the mid-1920s Professor Meyers advocated this case strongly. When the Faculty was finally inaugurated in 1936, Professor Meyers was appointed lecturer in anatomy, before becoming Dean in 1941. His standing as a medical educator was such that he was one of only two Australians to be invited to speak at the inaugural World Conference on Medical Education in 1953. Despite all of these accolades, perhaps the best marker of Professor Meyers’ success was his standing within the student body. Professor Meyers exhibited all of the qualities of an exceptional clinical teacher including a passion for education and enthusiasm for learning. He was much loved, admired and respected by the medical student body for his contribution to medical education.

==The Memorial Lecture==

The Errol Solomon Meyers Memorial Lecture is the premier academic event on the [[University of Queensland Medical Society]]’s calendar. The lecture is a special tribute to the life of Professor Meyers, and a wonderful opportunity to bring together members of the medical, university and general community. The UQMS is grateful for the support and contribution of the Meyers family and our past orators, who have assisted the ES Meyers Memorial Lecture to become one of the largest public lectures of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere.

'''''Essentials of Fire Fighting''''' is a fire service training manual produced by [[Fire Protection Publications]] (FPP) and the [[International Fire Service Training Association]] (IFSTA). Fire Protection Publications is a department of the College of Engineering, Architecture, and Technology (CEAT)at [[Oklahoma State University]] (OSU), in Stillwater, Oklahoma. This manual is used by fire service training agencies and departments around the world to train personnel to become firefighters. The Essentials of Fire Fighting is the required training manual used in countless local fire departments and state/provincial training agencies in every region of the United States and Canada. Since the release of the first edition of this manual in 1978, more than 2.25 million copies of The '''''Essentials of Fire Fighting'''''  have been distributed to the fire service.

There are two versions of the '''''Essentials of Fire Fighting''''' manual. IFSTA/FPP publishes the basic version that contains 21 chapters focused strictly on fire fighting content as required by NFPA 1001, '''''Standard for Fire Fighter Professional Qualifications ''''' (2013 edition). IFSTA/FPP, in partnership with Brady, a publisher of EMS training materials, co-publishes the '''''Essentials of Fire Fighting and Fire Department Operations''''', 6th Edition. This version includes all 21 chapters of '''''Essentials of Fire Fighting''''' , 6th Edition and adds three chapters written and validated to meet the emergency medical and hazardous materials requirements of NFPA 1001. Chapter 22 specifically addresses the Firefighter I and Firefighter II knowledge and skills requirements for the emergency medical care competencies identified in NFPA 1001, Chapter 4. Chapters 23 and 24 meet the First Responder Awareness and Operations Levels for Responders according to NFPA 472: Standard for Competence of Responders to Hazardous Materials/Weapons of Mass Destruction Incidents, 2012 Edition and OSHA 1910.120. The chapters also provide validated content to meet Section 6.6, Mission-Specific Competencies: Product Control, of NFPA 472. The hazardous materials information is adapted from the IFSTA '''''Hazardous Materials for First Responders''''',4th Edition.

== History of the Essentials of Fire Fighting ==
In 1934, the Western Actuarial Bureau sponsored a meeting in Kansas City to begin the process of gaining consensus on common training methods and techniques. State fire training directors from Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, and Arkansas attended and the Fire Service Training Association (FSTA) was formed. By its next meeting in 1935, 16 states were represented and more joined every year thereafter. Oklahoma A&amp;M College (OAMC, now known as Oklahoma State University [OSU]) was chosen to publish the manuals to be developed by the Fire Service Training Association. In 1935, two planographed, hardbound books were produced: Elementary Science Applied to the Firefighting Service and Ladders.

Eventually a total of ten topics were covered and published in 1937. Because of their red covers, the fire service called them “The Redbooks.” The ten original “Redbooks” were:

* Forcible Entry, Ropes, Knots, and Extinguishers
* Ground Ladders
* Hose
* Salvage and Overhaul
* Fire Streams
* Fire Apparatus
* Ventilation
* Rescue
* First Aid
* Fire Prevention and Inspection

In 1955, FSTA becomes the [[International Fire Service Training Association]] or [[IFSTA]] when the first Canadian officials attend and participate. In 1957, Oklahoma A&amp;M College became Oklahoma State University. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s IFSTA became more active in the U.S. fire service. IFSTA was a participant in the Williamsburg meeting that led to the formation of the Joint Council of National Fire Service Organizations. Everett Hudiburg, director of IFSTA, was selected to chair the Joint Council and spearheaded the formation of the National Professional Qualifications Board (Pro Board). The Pro Board developed professional qualifications standards and a national certification system. The four original professional qualifications standards adopted in 1974 included:

* Fire Fighters
* Fire Officers
* Fire Inspectors and Investigators
* Fire Instructors

IFSTA realized that its products could be used to assist firefighters in achieving certification. IFSTA manuals were then revised to ensure they covered the standards. It was apparent that it would be impractical for firefighters to have to buy at least 10 manuals to meet the firefighter certification requirements. 

It was decided that a single manual should be developed to assist firefighters in achieving certification, and thus the '''''Essentials of Fire Fighting''''' was born. Carroll Herring, director of the Louisiana Fireman Training Program (now known as the Louisiana State University Fire and Emergency Training Institute, is credited with recommending the title of '''''Essentials of Fire Fighting'''''. The first edition of '''''Essentials of Fire Fighting''''' was published in 1978 and subsequent editions have been published in 1983, 1992, 1998, and 2008. The latest edition (6th) was first released in January 2013.

== The Essentials of Fire Fighting, 6th edition ==

The 6th edition of '''''Essentials of Fire Fighting''''' addresses the 2013 edition of NFPA Standard 1001, Standard for Fire Fighter Professional Qualifications. This standard is widely accepted as the standard of knowledge and skills measurement for all firefighters in North America and beyond. This IFSTA manual includes an appendix list of the job performance requirements from the NFPA standard and a cross reference of the NFPA requirements to the chapters of Essentials. They are:

'''Ettie Annie Rout''' (24 February 1877 – 17 September 1936) was a [[Tasmania]]n-born [[New Zealanders|New Zealander]] whose work among servicemen in Paris and the [[Somme (department)|Somme]] during [[World War I]] made her a war hero among the [[French people|French]], yet through the same events she became ''[[persona non grata]]'' in New Zealand. She married Fred Hornibrook on 3 May 1920, after which she was '''Ettie Hornibrook'''. They had no children and later separated. She died in 1936, and was buried in the [[Cook Islands]].

==Life==
She was born in [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]], Tasmania, Australia, but she was raised in [[Wellington]], New Zealand from 1884. After leaving school, she became a [[shorthand]] typist for commissions of inquiry and later the [[New Zealand#Judiciary|Supreme Court]] (now the High Court, not to be confused with the present [[Supreme Court of New Zealand|Supreme Court]]). Biographers believe this job gave her a wide range of experiences on social issues. She was later a [[journalism|reporter]], businessperson, and writer, but most importantly, she was a campaigner on [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]].

After founding a volunteer nursing group during [[World War I]], the New Zealand Volunteer Sisterhood,  Rout was made aware of the prevalence of [[sexually transmitted infections|STI]] among servicemen. By 1917, the [[New Zealand Army]] had made free distribution of her safe sex kit compulsory. It was for her work inspecting brothels in [[Paris]] and in the [[Somme (department)|Somme]], that she was decorated by the French. In 1917 she and several other New Zealand nurses were [[Mentioned in Despatches]] by [[Archibald Murray|General Sir Archibald Murray]]&lt;ref name=""&gt;{{cite web

Ironically, in New Zealand, her exploits were considered such that her name, on pain of a [[New Zealand dollar|£]]100 fine, could not be published. However, her activities could be published.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Similar ironies were found overseas--her 1922 book, ''Safe Marriage: A Return to Sanity'', was banned in New Zealand, but published in both [[Australia]] and [[Great Britain|Britain]]. In the latter, it was a best-seller, yet in the [[House of Lords]], a [[bishop]] called her 'the wickedest woman in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/65866 Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: Rout, Ettie Annie]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;No such quote can be found in http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/search/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Rout died as the result of a [[quinine]] [[Drug overdose|overdose]] in [[Rarotonga]] in the [[Cook Islands]] following her sole postwar return to New Zealand in 1936. She is interred at an [[Avarua]] church cemetery. In 1992, [[Jane Tolerton]] wrote her biography, and more recently, she has been more critically perceived as a "White Australasia" apologist in Phillippa Levine's account of [[contagious disease]] legislation within the late nineteenth century British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Phillippa Levine (2003), ''Prostitution, Race and Politics: Policing Venereal Disease in the British Empire:'', New York, Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-94447-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jane Tolerton (1992), ''Ettie: A Life of Ettie Rout'', Auckland, Penguin, {{ISBN|0-14-017216-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 an episode of the New Zealand television series ''Pioneer Women'' dramatised her story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pioneer Women - Ettie Rout|url=http://www.nzonscreen.com/title/pioneer-women-ettie-rout-1983|work=Pioneer Women|publisher=TVNZ via NZ On Screen|accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Experience and Education''''' is a short book written in 1938 by [[John Dewey]], a pre-eminent educational theorist of the 20th century.  It provides a concise and powerful analysis of [[education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dewey|first=John|title=Experience &amp; Education|year=1938|publisher=Kappa Delta Pi|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-684-83828-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this and his other writings on education, Dewey continually emphasizes experience, experiment, purposeful learning, freedom, and other concepts of [[progressive education]]. Dewey argues that the quality of an educational experience is critical and stresses the importance of the social and interactive processes of learning.

==Summary==
{{Original research|section|date=November 2014}}
Dewey was critical of both traditional and progressive education, that is he saw challenges within both educational approaches because they lacked a carefully developed philosophy of experience. Dewey's progressive learning theory is based on the idea that people, even young people, are not just blank slates waiting to be filled with knowledge from kinder through college. Instead, Dewey suggested that students organize fact-based comprehension through meta-cognition, or by building onto prior experiences, preconceptions, and knowledge, and therefore, the educator's role is in creating an educative experience.

===Traditional vs. Progressive Education===
Experience and Education opens by saying that humans organize thoughts, and ideas as "either-ors" and argues that this is mirrored in educational philosophy, namely in what Dewey labels as [[Traditional education|traditional]] vs. progressive education.&lt;ref&gt;^ Dewey, John (1938). Experience &amp; Education. New York, NY: Kappa Delta Pi. {{ISBN|0-684-83828-1}}. p.17&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey conceptualizes education as being focused on bodies of information and skills that are passed from one generation to another.
Dewey does not put traditional vs. progressive education against each other; instead, he is critical of teaching methods that are "static"&lt;ref&gt;^ Dewey, John (1938). Experience &amp; Education. New York, NY: Kappa Delta Pi. {{ISBN|0-684-83828-1}}. p.19&lt;/ref&gt; and not incorporating enough [[experiential learning]], which he notes young learners are more accustomed to. In addition, Dewey is critical of the old structure and its organization of educational philosophy.

===The Need of a Theory of Experience===
In Chapter 2, The Need of a Theory of Experience, Dewey argues that not all experiences are educative and that, in fact, some experiences can be mis-educative. The central challenge to experience-based learning is to create fruitful experiences and organize them in progression to guide students’ learning. A mis-educative experience stymies the growth of further experiences.  Enjoyable experiences may be mis-educative if they are disconnected and promote dispersive, disintegrated and centrifugal habits.  In traditional schools, people associated boredom with the learning process. The experiences had by teachers and students were of the “wrong kind.” It Is not the absence of experiences in traditional schooling that Dewey finds troubling, but the defective nature of these experiences. Therefore, the educator’s duty is to determine the quality of an experience.  Each experience has two aspects:  the immediate agreeableness or disagreeableness and its later impact on further experience.  Educators must think about the experiential continuum—continuity of experiences.

===Criteria of Experience===
In Chapter 3, Criteria of Experience, Dewey delves more deeply into defining what constitutes experience for educational purposes and introduces the concept of directionality on the "experiential continuum". He argues growth can happen in an undesirable direction, as with that of burglars who become proficient at their professions. In this chapter, Dewey also raises questions about the built learning environment and critiques how traditional schools are insular environments rather than interacting with the world, which would promote an understanding of the world and provide a context.  Dewey posits that everything must have a context to be able to draw from it and have it be educational.

===Social Control===
In Chapter 4, Dewey argues that the teacher in a traditional classroom, by nature of the social setting, was concerned mainly with "keeping order."  In a progressive education classroom, social conventions would be enforced by the students who felt a part of the community and not forced on students by the teacher.  Dewey uses the example of children playing games at recess, as he explains "The games involve rules, and these rules order their conduct...As long as the game goes on with a reasonable smoothness, the players do not feel that they are submitting to external imposition, but that they are playing the game."  When things do not go smoothly, the player "may even get angry, but he is not objecting to a rule, but to what he claims is a violation of it." The teacher, in this instance, could act as the umpire or referee to which students would look to arbitrate disputes. In those few instances which the teacher had to intervene directly, as long as the teacher acted on behalf of the interest of the group, children would accept the teacher doing so. Dewey notes that traditional schools, which did not rely upon the establishment of a social learning community, tended to lack this social control, and therefore the teacher only had the option of "direct intervention" to "keep order."

===The Nature of Freedom===
In Chapter 5, Dewey asserts that the freedom of intelligence—the act of freely thinking, observing and judging—is the only freedom of enduring importance.  Unlike traditional schools that enforce quiet and stillness, progressive learning allows teachers to assess their students on a deeper level because of the outward freedom they afford students.  Freedom of movement is also an integral component of physical and mental health.  Although freedom of movement is important, Dewey states outward movement does not always lead to progressive learning.  Instead, Dewey believes that freedom of outer-movement is a means, not an end.  Teachers therefore should address the need for external freedom on an individual basis with each student.  Allowing students’ freedom of intelligence gives them the power to frame purposes, judge wisely, and evaluate their desires.  Students need time to make observations of the world.  Cultivating this freedom of intelligence or power means allowing students ample opportunity to reflect on their natural impulses by “stopping and thinking.”

===The Meaning of Purpose===
In Chapter 6, Dewey maintains that students must feel a sense of purpose in their learning to avoid mental slavery.  Dewey describes a slave as someone who “executes the purpose of another or is enslaved to his own blind desires.”   A genuine purpose consists of impulses, desires that are measured against perceived consequences.  A purpose involves thinking about future consequences resulting from acting upon impulse.  Schooling should not just concern itself with appealing to a student’s desires or impulses.  Educators must help students foresee the consequences of enacted impulses and desires.  More importantly educators must help drive the direction of the purpose.  The formation of purposes involves: observation of objective conditions; an assessment of past experiences with similar conditions; and judgment of observation combined with memory to determine significance.

===Educator's role in creating educative experience&lt;!--not a chapter title--&gt;===
An experience-based model of education implies students learning new material must find a way to ground unfamiliar concepts and ideas within the scope of ordinary life-experience. Progressive education with an emphasis on experience-linked learning relies on the role of the educator to structure material being studied in a manner that facilitates this.

Conversely, students' diverse backgrounds create an infinitely diverse range of experiences for the educator to consider. It is his/her responsibility to organize learning experiences to allow assimilation of new material in a context appreciable by and beneficial to the student. Developing this structure first requires acknowledgement of experience as a vehicle of learning. Subsequently the educator's discretion is important in selecting the material for a course of study and a sensitivity to weaving connections between the students' previous experiences and new material, such that the lesson learned is of greater value.

One of Dewey's preeminent concerns was the educator's role in creating an environment of education that provides continuity within this contextualized experience-based assimilative model of student learning. The difficulty in this challenge lies in continually adapting subject matter to the growing sphere of individual experiences as students progress.

'''Gaston Bachelard''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|b|æ|ʃ|ə|ˈ|l|ɑr}} ; {{IPA-fr|baʃlaʁ|lang}}; 27 June 1884 – 16 October 1962) was a French [[philosopher]].&lt;ref name="BioDict20CPhil"&gt;{{cite book | title=Biographical Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Philosophers | year=1996 | publisher=Routledge | location=London | pages=41–42 | isbn=0-415-06043-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made contributions in the fields of [[poetics]] and the [[philosophy of science]]. To the latter he introduced the concepts of ''epistemological obstacle'' and ''[[Epistemological rupture|epistemological break]]'' (''obstacle épistémologique'' and ''rupture épistémologique''). He influenced many subsequent French philosophers, among them [[Michel Foucault]], [[Louis Althusser]], [[Dominique Lecourt]] and [[Jacques Derrida]], as well as the sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]].

==Life and work==
Bachelard was a [[postmaster]] in [[Bar-sur-Aube]], and then studied [[physics]] before finally becoming interested in philosophy. He was a professor at [[Dijon]] from 1930 to 1940 and then became the inaugural chair in history and philosophy of the sciences at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. In 1958 he became a member of the [[Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium]].&lt;ref&gt;Index biographique des membres et associés de l'Académie royale de Belgique (1769-2005) p 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bachelard's psychology of science ===
Bachelard's studies of the history and philosophy of science in such works as ''Le nouvel esprit scientifique'' ("The New Scientific Spirit", 1934) and ''La formation de l'esprit scientifique'' ("The Formation of the Scientific Mind", 1938) were based on his vision of historical [[epistemology]] as a kind of [[psychoanalysis]] of the scientific mind.

In the English-speaking world, the connection Bachelard made between [[psychology]] and the history of science has been little understood. Bachelard demonstrated how the progress of science could be blocked by certain types of mental patterns, creating the concept of ''obstacle épistémologique'' ("epistemological obstacle"). One task of epistemology is to make clear the mental patterns at use in science, in order to help scientists overcome the obstacles to knowledge.

=== Epistemological breaks: the discontinuity of scientific progress ===
Bachelard was critical of [[Auguste Comte]]'s [[positivism]], which considered science as a continual [[Progress (history)|progress]]. To Bachelard, scientific developments such as Einstein's [[theory of relativity]] demonstrated the discontinuous nature of the [[history of sciences]]. Thus models that framed scientific development as continuous, such as that of Comte and [[Émile Meyerson]], seemed simplistic and erroneous to Bachelard.

Through his concept of "epistemological break", Bachelard underlined the discontinuity at work in the history of sciences. However the term "epistemological break" itself is almost never used by Bachelard, but became famous through [[Louis Althusser]].

He showed that new theories integrated old theories in new [[Paradigm shift|paradigms]], changing the sense of concepts (for instance, the concept of [[mass (physics)|mass]], used by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] in two different senses). Thus, [[non-Euclidean geometry]] did not contradict [[Euclidean geometry]], but integrated it into a larger framework.

=== The role of epistemology in science ===
Bachelard was a [[rationalist]] in the [[Descartes|Cartesian]] sense, although he recommended his "non-Cartesian epistemology" as a replacement for the more standard Cartesian epistemology.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Scientific Mind'', conclusion.&lt;/ref&gt; He compared "scientific knowledge" to ordinary knowledge in the way we deal with it, and saw error as only illusion: "Scientifically, one thinks truth as the historical rectification of a persistent error, and experiments as correctives for an initial, common illusion (''illusion première'')."&lt;ref&gt;''The New Scientific Mind'', VI, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of [[epistemology]] is to show the history of the (scientific) production of concepts; those concepts are not just theoretical propositions: they are simultaneously abstract and [[concrete (philosophy)|concrete]], pervading [[technic]]al and [[pedagogic]]al activity. This explains why "The electric bulb is an object of scientific thought… an example of an abstract-concrete object."&lt;ref&gt;in ''Le Rationalisme appliqué'' (1949, 2nd ed. of 1962, p. 104ff).&lt;/ref&gt; To understand the way it works, one has to take the detour of scientific knowledge. Epistemology is thus not a general philosophy that aims at justifying scientific reasoning. Instead it produces regional [[history of science|histories of science]].

=== Shifts in scientific perspective ===
Bachelard saw how seemingly irrational theories often simply represented a drastic shift in scientific perspective. For instance, he claimed that the [[theory of probabilities]] was just another way of complexifying reality through a deepening of rationality (even though critics like [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] found this theory irrational).&lt;ref&gt;''The New Scientific Mind'', V (p. 120 French ed., 1934).&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his main theses in ''The New Scientific Mind'' was that modern sciences had replaced the classical [[ontology]] of the [[Substance theory|substance]] with an "ontology of relations", which could be assimilated to something like a [[process philosophy]]. For instance, the physical concepts of matter and rays correspond, according to him, to the metaphysical concepts of the thing and of movement; but whereas classical philosophy considered both as distinct, and the thing as [[Ontology|ontologically]] real, modern science can not distinguish matter from rays: it is thus impossible to examine an immobile thing, which was precisely the condition for  knowledge according to classical [[theory of knowledge]] (Becoming being impossible to be known, in accordance with [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]'s [[theory of knowledge|theories of knowledge]]).

In non-Cartesian epistemology, there is no "simple substance" as in [[Cartesianism]], but only complex objects built by theories and experiments, and continuously improved (VI, 4). [[Intuition (philosophy)|Intuition]] is therefore not primitive, but built (VI, 2). These themes led Bachelard to support a sort of [[constructivist epistemology]].

=== Other academic interests ===
In addition to epistemology, Bachelard's work deals with many other topics, including poetry, dreams, [[psychoanalysis]], and the imagination. ''The Psychoanalysis of Fire'' (1938) and ''[[The Poetics of Space]]'' (1958) are among the most popular of his works, and the latter had a wide reception in [[architectural theory]] circles. [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] cites the former and Bachelard's ''Water and Dreams'' in his ''[[Being and Nothingness]]''.

'''Girls Who Code''' is a [[nonprofit organization]] which aims to support and increase the number of women in [[computer science]]. The organization is working to close the gender employment difference in technology and change the image of what a programmer looks like. They have a 7-week Summer Immersion Program, a 2-week specialized Campus Program, after school Clubs, and a 13-book [[The New York Times|New York Times]] best-selling series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/2017/09/10/childrens-middle-grade-hardcover/|title=Children’s Middle Grade Hardcover Books - Best Sellers - September 10, 2017 - The New York Times|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-01|language=en|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim is to inspire, educate, and equip young women with the computing skills to pursue 21st century opportunities.

Girls Who Code was founded by [[Reshma Saujani]] in 2012 who came up with the idea of creating the organization during her run for the [[United States Congress]] when she noticed that schools along her campaign route lacked girls in computer science classrooms.&lt;ref name="USA TODAY 2014"/&gt; The organization runs programs during the academic year teaching high school girls computing skills like [[computer programming|programming]], [[robotics]], and [[web design]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/reshma-saujanis-ambitious-plan-for-technology-1415237831 |title= Reshma Saujani’s Ambitious Plan for Technology |date= November 5, 2014 |accessdate= February 14, 2015 |first= Christopher |last= Ross |work= Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "One Million"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cbsnews.com/news/girls-who-code-leading-charge-for-women-in-computer-science/ |title= Aiming for 1 million "Girls Who Code" |date= December 11, 2014 |accessdate= February 15, 2015 |work= CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; with sessions including projects and trips to companies like [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]].&lt;ref name="USA TODAY 2014"&gt;{{cite web | title=No boys allowed: Girls Who Code takes on gender gap | website=USA TODAY | date=August 15, 2014  | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/08/12/girls-who-code-facebook-sheryl-sandberg/13784445/ | accessdate=February 15, 2015|author= Guynn, Jessica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tc&gt;{{cite web |url= https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/14/girls-who-code-expands-to-get-more-young-women-in-computer-science-majors/ |title= Girls Who Code Expands To Get More Young Women In Computer Science Majors |work= Tech Crunch |date= December 14, 2014 |accessdate= February 15, 2015 |first= Sarah |last= Buhr}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are now over 1500 Girls Who Code clubs across America, with the organization aiming to teach one million girls to code by 2020.&lt;ref name = "One Million"/&gt; By December 2014, three thousand students had completed a Girls Who Code program, 95% of whom went on to major in computer science at university.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite web |url= http://time.com/3062885/girls-who-code-google-facebook/ |title= Cracking the Girl Code: How to End the Tech Gender Gap |work= Time |date= July 31, 2014 |first= Eliana |last= Dockterman |accessdate= February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company announced that in 2016 the non-profit organization will be expanding to all 50 states- making it the largest computing program for girls in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=the largest computer science program for girls in the U.S.!|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2017, the nonprofit launched a 13-book series with [[Penguin Random House]], including a nonfiction book, Girls Who Code: Learn to Code and Change the World, and several fiction books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/21/books/coding-children.html|title=Teaching Kids Coding, by the Book|last=Alter|first=Alexandra|date=2017-08-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-01|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the spring of 2018, Girls Who Code will have reached more than 50,000 girls with their computer science education programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://girlswhocode.com/clubs-launch-2017/|title=Girls Who Code free after school Clubs launch for 2017-2018|date=2017-10-04|work=girlswhocode|access-date=2017-12-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization's efforts to close the [[gender gaps in mathematics and reading|achievement gender gap]] has resulted in several honors. Saujani was recognized for 'her vision and efforts to close the gender gap in technology'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/id=1202771539858/Law-Firm-Awards-Girls-Who-Code-Founder-?slreturn=20161019022429|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5208">'''Global civics''' suggests to understand [[civics]] in a global sense as a [[social contract]] among all [[world citizen]]s in an age of interdependence and interaction. The disseminators of the concept define it as the notion that we have certain rights and responsibilities towards each other by the mere fact of being human on Earth.&lt;ref name=case&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Altinay |first=Hakan |title=The Case for Global Civics |journal=Global Economy and Development at Brookings |year=2010 |url=http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/03_global_civics_altinay.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603104201/http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/03_global_civics_altinay.aspx |archivedate=2010-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advocates of the notion attempt to demonstrate that it is possible to imagine global civics. According to this notion, in an increasingly interdependent world, the [[world citizen]]s need a compass that would frame mindsets on a global scale, and create a shared consciousness and sense of global responsibility related to specific world issues such as environmental problems and nuclear proliferation.&lt;ref name = feasible&gt;{{cite journal | last = Altinay| first = Hakan| title= A Global Civics: Necessary? Feasible?| journal = Global Policy| date = June 2010| url = http://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/articles/international-law-and-human-rights/global-civics-necessary-feasible}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the concept==

The term '''global civics''' was first coined by Hakan Altinay, a nonresident senior fellow with the Global Economy and Development program at the [[Brookings Institution]], in a working paper published in March 2010. The concept builds upon the basic tenets behind [[global ethics]], [[global justice]] and [[world citizenship]], inviting everyone to question their increasingly important role in a highly interdependent world. In early 2011, Altinay published ''Global Civics: Responsibilities and Rights in an Interdependent World,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title =Global Civics: Rights and Responsibilities in an Interdependent World| last=Altinay| first=Hakan| year = 2011 | publisher= Brookings Institution Press | location= Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a book of articles on global civics put forth by academics and intellectuals all around the world.

==Objections to the concept==
Opponents of the global civics concept argue that even a modest level of exercising responsibility towards all the people living in the world is so overwhelming and nearly impossible to achieve. These arguments also posit that [[civics]] assumes an effective state and enforcement. The claim goes that since there is no such thing as a [[world government]], global civics implementation is not feasible. Also, it has been suggested that superpowers of the world are selfish and dangerous nations, and that they do not feel constrained by international legitimacy and laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Dangerous Nations|last= Kagan|first= Robert|year= 2006 | publisher= Alfred A. Knopf | location= New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the critics claim that any experience of pan-global solidarity among human beings cannot form the basis of constellation of rights and responsibilities as it is nascent at best and the experience of being a global citizen is a privilege restricted to international elites and a few activists.&lt;ref name = feasible/&gt;

==The role of universities==

The proponents of global civics also suggest that university campuses play a vital role in spreading a thorough understanding of how today's global world functions and contributes toward preparation of future generations for life in an interdependent world. This view calls for visionary universities that could successfully "provide their students with the forums and the tools to discuss and figure out what their responsibilities are to their fellow human beings." &lt;ref name = case/&gt;

A '''Higher National Diploma''' ('''HND''') is a [[higher education]] qualification of the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/EducationAndLearning/QualificationsExplained/DG_10039026|title=Higher National Certificates and Higher National Diplomas|website=[[Directgov]]|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121015000000/http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/EducationAndLearning/QualificationsExplained/DG_10039026|archive-date=2012-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A qualification of the same title is also offered in [[Argentina]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acaedu.edu.ar/espanol/paginas/publicaciones/Estudios/03-%20Sobrevila%20-%20La%20educacion%20tecnica%20argentina/Cap%202.PDF|title=National Academic and Technical Education, Argentina, Chap. 2 by Prof. Marcelo A.

This qualification can be used to gain entry into universities at an advanced level, and is considered equivalent to the second year of a three-year university degree course, or the third year of a four-year university degree course, or in some cases equivalent to a university degree.

==Overview==
[[Pearson Education]] describes an HND as "A semi vocational / semi professional qualification, usually studied full-time, in two to three academic years' time [that] can be studied part-time. It is equivalent to the first two years of a three-year degree (with honours), and it is at the same level of the second year of an ordinary [[bachelor's degree]] or to the [[Diploma of Higher Education]]".{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In [[England]], [[Wales]], and [[Northern Ireland]], the HND is a qualification awarded by many awarding bodies, such as the [[Confederation of Tourism and Hospitality]] (CTH Advanced diploma), [[Scottish Qualifications Authority]] (SQA) and [[Business and Technician Education Council|BTEC]] (Vocational programs). In [[Scotland]], a ''Higher National'' is awarded by the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edexcel.org.uk/quals/hn/ |title=Qualifications : BTEC Higher Nationals |publisher=Edexcel |date= |accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/sqa_nu_display_section.jsp?pContentID=411&amp;p_applic=CCC&amp;p_service=Content.show&amp; |title=HN Homepage |publisher=SQA |date=2010-08-05 |accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attainment level is roughly equivalent to second year of a 4 year Scottish degree or 1st year of a 3 year English degree, Ref Edinburgh College [[university]], a [[Diploma of Higher Education]], Diploma;'s of Higher Education are a different qualification from HNC and HND.  They are a 1 year Post Grad University degree. An HND takes two years of full-time study, or one year full-time following successful completion of a [[Higher National Certificate]]; part-time study takes longer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aimhigher.ac.uk/courses/choosing_courses/levels_of_course.cfm choosing your qualification : Aimhigher] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060824143937/http://www.aimhigher.ac.uk/courses/choosing_courses/levels_of_course.cfm |date=August 24, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ghana, HND is offered in Polytechnics with Programmes of Secretaryship and Management Studies also equivalents to associate degree in Business Administration, Accounting, marketing, etc.

In Nigeria, HND is a continuation of a [[National Diploma (Nigeria)|National Diploma]] (ND) programme, both offered by [[Institute of technology|polytechnics]]. The ND and HND programmes have a duration of two years each with one-year break after the ND programme for an Industrial Training (IT) attachment in relevant industries. At the completion of an HND programme, the graduate would have spent 4 to 5 years; hence, Higher National Diplomas are sometimes referred to "equivalent" of a first degree. Although, there have existed a long-standing disagreement over the "equivalence" of HND to university first degree; employers of labour (including the government and its policies) have discriminated against HND holders—grading them below their university counterparts and preventing them from attaining managerial or directorate cadres. However, following series of efforts&lt;ref&gt;http://nigerianuniversityscholarships.com/polytechnic-students-staff-plead-with-buhari-to-end-hnd-b-sc-disparity/&lt;/ref&gt; by polytechnic students/lecturers and concerned entities, the federal government has made attempts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribuneonlineng.com/national-council-establishment-resolves-universitypolytechnic-dichotomy/|title=National Council on Establishment resolves university/polytechnic dichotomy|date=31 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnewsonline.com/adamu-confirms-abolition-of-bschnd-dichotomy/|title=Adamu confirms abolition of BSc/HND dichotomy - The Sun News|website=sunnewsonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; to remove the dichotomy between HND and degree holders in places of employment, and the efforts are paying off as some of the government organisations (especially [[paramilitary]]) have started upgrading and employing the HND-holders at par with their First Degree counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dailytrust.com.ng/news/general/interior-ministry-breaks-hnd-degree-dichotomy-upgrade-hnd-holders-in-immigration-civil-defence-others/205318.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://punchng.com/fg-approves-equal-salaries-for-hnd-degree-holders/|title=FG approves equal salaries for HND, degree holders|author=|date=|website=punchng.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have even claimed that the HND graduates are better than their universities counterparts in the same fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/08/erstwhile-dichotomy-hnd-b-sc-demoralising-says-asup/|title=HND holders perform better than some degree holders , says ASUP - Vanguard News|date=4 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scotland an HND is Level 8 on the [[Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework]] and in England, Wales and Northern Ireland it is Level 5 on the [[Regulated Qualifications Framework]]/Credit and Qualifications Framework for Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scqf.org.uk/table.htm The Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001203658/http://www.scqf.org.uk/table.htm |date=October 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qca.org.uk/493_15772.html|title=The structure of the NQF|accessdate=October 15, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926024602/http://www.qca.org.uk/493_15772.html|archivedate=September 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is quite common for those who have achieved an HND to add to their qualification by progressing to other levels such as professional qualifications, or a degree.

Many universities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smu.ac.uk/index.php/potential-students/faculty-of-applied-design-and-engineering/ac/58-hnd-software-engineering|title=HND Computing|date=|publisher=[[Swansea Metropolitan University]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403182811/http://www.smu.ac.uk/index.php/potential-students/faculty-of-applied-design-and-engineering/ac/58-hnd-software-engineering|archive-date=2012-04-03|accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; will take students who have completed their HND onto the third year of a degree course (particularly in areas such as business)—and the second year of a [[computer science]] or an [[engineering degree]]. This is often called a "top up". It's possible for students to progress directly into year 'three' (Level 6) of a full degree programme at these universities across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mercuryvirtual.com/course/progression_university_list.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Usually which of these years depends on the modules taken in the HND. It also means that after three years (or four if a business placement year is taken) a student could have both the HND and an honours degree if studying in a university in England, Wales, or Northern Ireland. Scottish and Irish [[honours degree]]s are normally four year courses, and so an extra year of study is required. In Ireland progression to the final year of a three-year ordinary degree in an [[institute of technology]] (IT) is possible (referred to as an "add-on" year.)

On graduation, students are permitted to use the postnominals '''HND''' or '''HNDip''' after their name, usually followed by the course name in brackets.

'''Joseph McVicker Hunt''' (March 19, 1906 – January 9, 1991) was a prominent [[United States|American]] [[educational psychologist]] and author. He promoted and researched concepts related to the malleable nature of child intelligence (also promulgated by [[Benjamin Bloom]]). That work eventually led to the theory of learning centered on the concept of the [[information processing system]].  

==Early life==
Joseph McVicker Hunt was born in Nebraska on March 19, 1906, to parents R. Sanford and Carrie Pearl Hunt, who were both [[University of Nebraska]] graduates. Hunt was an active student with interests in both academic and nonacademic areas such as sports.&lt;ref name="Portraits of Pioneers in Developmental Psychology"&gt;Pickren, W.E., Dewsbury, D.A., Wertheimer, M. (2012). “Portraits of Pioneers in Developmental Psychology”. Taylor &amp; Francis Group, New York, NY. p. 185-203 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Hunt enrolled in the University of Nebraska in the mid-1920s. He became president of the League of Industrial Democracy and Student Christian Association as well as participating in football and wrestling. He was also a writer for a newspaper and sold life insurance while in school to earn extra money.&lt;ref name="Portraits of Pioneers in Developmental Psychology"&gt;Pickren, W.E., Dewsbury, D.A., Wertheimer, M. (2012). “Portraits of Pioneers in Developmental Psychology”. Taylor &amp; Francis Group, New York, NY. p. 185-203 &lt;/ref&gt;

Hunt had difficulty deciding on an undergraduate major, so he started with biology, and then moved to philosophy, economics, and sociology.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Psychology"&gt;Haywood, C.H. (2000). “Encyclopedia of Psychology, Vol. 4”. American Psychological Association. New York, NY. p. 204-206 &lt;/ref&gt; His interest in psychology did not begin until his junior year, when [[Joy Paul Guilford]] returned to the University of Nebraska to direct the psychology laboratory. Hunt took advice from one of his sociology professors and enrolled in a course taught by [[J. P. Guilford|Guilford]] who eventually asked him to complete graduate work in psychology. Hunt accepted and became a graduate student in 1929 at the University of Nebraska.&lt;ref name="Portraits of Pioneers in Developmental Psychology"&gt;Pickren, W.E., Dewsbury, D.A., Wertheimer, M. (2012). “Portraits of Pioneers in Developmental Psychology”. Taylor &amp; Francis Group, New York, NY. p. 185-203 &lt;/ref&gt;

Hunt was interested in [[psychoanalysis]]. For his master’s thesis, Hunt wanted to discuss the personality traits of [[extraversion and introversion]], which were described by [[William McDougal]], but after reading the work of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]], Hunt became convinced of the importance of early life experiences in shaping one’s personality. Additionally, Hunt had the opportunity to test the intelligence of children at the Nebraska Home for Dependent Children, which proved to be important in his later work on the development of child intelligence.&lt;ref name="Portraits of Pioneers in Developmental Psychology"&gt;Pickren, W.E., Dewsbury, D.A., Wertheimer, M. (2012). “Portraits of Pioneers in Developmental Psychology”. Taylor &amp; Francis Group, New York, NY. p. 185-203 &lt;/ref&gt;

Hunt completed his MA in 1930 and then became an assistant instructor at his alma mater for one year.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Psychology"&gt;Haywood, C.H. (2000). “Encyclopedia of Psychology, Vol. 4”. American Psychological Association. New York, NY. p. 204-206 &lt;/ref&gt; Hunt then completed his doctoral degree at [[Cornell University]] under the supervision of [[Madison Bentley]], who was a student of [[Edward Bradford Titchener]]. Hunt received a Ph.D from Cornell University in 1933.  Hunt also completed postdoctoral fellowships at the [[New York State Psychiatric Institute]] and the [[Worcester State Hospital]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Psychology"&gt;Haywood, C.H. (2000). “Encyclopedia of Psychology, Vol. 4”. American Psychological Association. New York, NY. p. 204-206 &lt;/ref&gt; He also received a D.Sc from [[Brown University]].

==Teaching and research==

As an assistant instructor at the [[University of Nebraska]], Hunt directed the laboratory experiences for introductory psychology students and taught a course on psychological testing.&lt;ref name="Portraits of Pioneers in Developmental Psychology"&gt;Pickren, W.E., Dewsbury, D.A., Wertheimer, M. (2012). “Portraits of Pioneers in Developmental Psychology”. Taylor &amp; Francis Group, New York, NY. p. 185-203 &lt;/ref&gt; He was asked to be an instructor of psychology at [[Brown University]], which Hunt accepted in 1936. Hunt was a professor at Brown for 10 years and during this time researched experimental psychopathology and Freudian concepts in animals.  This is also where he became familiar with the work of [[Jean Piaget]]. 

A notable collaboration at Brown was with [[Harold Schlosberg]], in which they attempted to induce neuroses in hoarding rats. They found that the rats that were given unlimited food supply did not hoard their food as adults, whereas the rats that were fed irregularly did hoard their food as adults. These findings implied the importance of early life experience in shaping adult behavior.&lt;ref name="American Journal of Psychology"&gt; Uzgiris, I. C. (1992). Joseph mcvicker hunt: 1906-1991. American Journal of Psychology, 105(3), 471-476 &lt;/ref&gt; 

His latest job before his death was as professor of psychology at the [[University of Illinois]] in 1951. Before that he taught at a number of universities, including Brown University, [[Columbia University]], the [[University of Nebraska]], and [[New York University]]. At the University of Illinois, he started out being interested in the origin of human intelligence and its development. Although other research emphasized the genetic component of intelligence, Hunt thought that experience played just as large a role in the development of intelligence.&lt;ref name="apa.org"&gt; American Psychological Association. (n.d.). Joseph mcvicker hunt. Retrieved from http://www.apa.org/about/governance/president/bio-joseph-hunt.aspx &lt;/ref&gt; Hunt was also interested in the neurophysiological basis of behavior and was impressed with [[Donald Hebb]]'s assertions. Therefore, he developed the A/S ratio, which suggested that aspects of motivation were connected to the ratio of association areas to sensory areas in the brain. This idea led to the understanding of [[intrinsic motivation]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Psychology"&gt;Haywood, C.H. (2000). “Encyclopedia of Psychology, Vol. 4”. American Psychological Association. New York, NY. p. 204-206 &lt;/ref&gt; His interest in [[Jean Piaget]] stemmed from his teaching infant development at the [[University of Illinois]] and challenged the nativist perspective that was dominant at the time on the development of intelligence.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Psychology"&gt;Haywood, C.H. (2000). “Encyclopedia of Psychology, Vol. 4”. American Psychological Association. New York, NY. p. 204-206 &lt;/ref&gt; Grants from both the [[Russell Sage Foundation]] and the [[Commonwealth Fund]] allowed him to research the development of intelligence and motivation through child-rearing practices and experience.&lt;ref name="American Journal of Psychology"&gt; Uzgiris, I. C. (1992). Joseph mcvicker hunt: 1906-1991. American Journal of Psychology, 105(3), 471-476 &lt;/ref&gt; His work helped to develop different scales that were able to measure psychological development in young children.&lt;ref name="Joseph McVicker Hunt, Work Led to Head Start"&gt;Heise K. (January 11, 1991). "Joseph McVicker Hunt, Work Led to Head Start". The Chicago Tribune. Retrieved from http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-01-11/news/9101030720_1_head-start-standardized-tests-intelligence-and-experience &lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable works==

Hunt contributed to the two-volume landmark publication entitled ''Personality and the Behavior Disorders'', which was published in 1944 during his time at Brown. This work summarized work pertaining to mental disorders and personality and provided ideas for future research from both a [[psychodynamic]] and [[psychoanalytic]] perspective.&lt;ref name="Portraits of Pioneers in Developmental Psychology"&gt;Pickren, W.E., Dewsbury, D.A., Wertheimer, M. (2012). “Portraits of Pioneers in Developmental Psychology”. Taylor &amp; Francis Group, New York, NY. p. 185-203 &lt;/ref&gt;

Hunt's book entitled ''Intelligence and Experience'', written in 1961, was one of the most influential volumes on child development.&lt;ref name="apa.org"&gt; American Psychological Association. (n.d.). Joseph mcvicker hunt. Retrieved from http://www.apa.org/about/governance/president/bio-joseph-hunt.aspx &lt;/ref&gt; It emphasized the shift that was happening among American psychologists regarding intelligence and what determines intelligence. Hunt claimed that experience played a much larger role in determining intelligence in adulthood.&lt;ref name="American Journal of Psychology"&gt; Uzgiris, I. C. (1992). Joseph mcvicker hunt: 1906-1991. American Journal of Psychology, 105(3), 471-476 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Other notable contributions==

Joseph McVicker Hunt was elected and served as the [[American Psychological Association]] president from 1951-1952.&lt;ref name="apa.org"&gt; American Psychological Association. (n.d.). Joseph mcvicker hunt. Retrieved from http://www.apa.org/about/governance/president/bio-joseph-hunt.aspx &lt;/ref&gt; He was also the editor of the ''Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology'' from 1949-1955, was a member of the APA council of representatives and the president of the APA’s Division of Clinical Psychology from 1967-1970. He also helped establish the [[American Psychological Foundation]].&lt;ref name="apa.org"&gt; American Psychological Association. (n.d.). Joseph mcvicker hunt. Retrieved from http://www.apa.org/about/governance/president/bio-joseph-hunt.aspx &lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Hunt laid the groundwork for the [[Head Start Program]] in the early 1960s.&lt;ref name="Joseph McVicker Hunt, Work Led to Head Start"&gt;Heise K. (January 11, 1991). "Joseph McVicker Hunt, Work Led to Head Start". The Chicago Tribune. Retrieved from http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-01-11/news/9101030720_1_head-start-standardized-tests-intelligence-and-experience &lt;/ref&gt; He did this by emphasizing the importance of early education and developed psychometric methods that assessed cognitive developments in young children. Hunt also served as the leader of the White House Task Force on Early Childhood Development under President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], which is known for their report entitled “A Bill of Rights for Children.”&lt;ref name="apa.org"&gt; American Psychological Association. (n.d.). Joseph mcvicker hunt. Retrieved from http://www.apa.org/about/governance/president/bio-joseph-hunt.aspx &lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==

Hunt received a number of awards, including the Award for Excellence in Research from the American Personal and Guidance Association and the Research Career Award from the [[National Institute of Mental Health]]. Hunt held a National Institute of Mental Health Research Career Award from 1962-1974, was awarded the Gold Medal of the [[American Psychological Association]] in 1970, received the Distinguished Contribution Award of APA developmental psychology division and the G. Stanley Hall Award from the clinical psychology division.&lt;ref name="Portraits of Pioneers in Developmental Psychology"&gt;Pickren, W.E., Dewsbury, D.A., Wertheimer, M. (2012). “Portraits of Pioneers in Developmental Psychology”. Taylor &amp; Francis Group, New York, NY. p. 185-203 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Hunt married Esther Dalmus on December 5, 1929, and was married to her until her death in 1989. Hunt died on January 9, 1991, at home in Urbana, Illinois.&lt;ref name="Joseph McVicker Hunt, Work Led to Head Start"&gt;Heise K. (January 11, 1991). "Joseph McVicker Hunt, Work Led to Head Start".

==Legacy==

Hunt retired from the [[University of Illinois]] in 1974. However, he remained an active researcher. His most important contributions were those in developmental psychology. Through his research, Hunt was able to emphasize the malleable nature of a child and the role of experience in molding a person.&lt;ref name="Portraits of Pioneers in Developmental Psychology"&gt;Pickren, W.E., Dewsbury, D.A., Wertheimer, M. (2012). “Portraits of Pioneers in Developmental Psychology”. Taylor &amp; Francis Group, New York, NY. p. 185-203 &lt;/ref&gt; Hunt published over 100 research and theoretical papers, and was editor of the ''Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology'' from 1950 and 1955. He was also an editor and contributor for ''Personality and the Behavior Disorders''.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, J. McVicker (1961). ''Intelligence and Experience'', About the author.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27029">'''Japanese language education in the United States''' began in the late 19th century, aimed mainly at [[Japanese American]] children and conducted by parents and community institutions. Over the course of the next century, it would slowly expand to include non-Japanese as well as [[native speaker]]s (mainly [[kikokushijo|children of Japanese expatriates]] being educated in [[international school]]s). A 2012 survey of foreign-language learners by the [[Japan Foundation]] found 4,270 teachers teaching the [[Japanese language]] to 155,939 students at 1,449 different institutions, an increase of 10.4% in the number of students since the 2009 survey.&lt;ref name="2012Survey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jflalc.org/school-survey-2012.html|publisher=[[Japan Foundation]]|date=2012|accessdate=2016-09-06|title=Survey on Japanese-language Education Abroad 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quality and focus of dialogues in Japanese textbooks meant for English-speakers has changed since the 1970s.

==History==
===Origins===
The earliest [[Japanese language]] instruction in the [[United States]] was aimed at [[heritage language|heritage speaker]]s. [[Japanese in Hawaii|Japanese immigration to Hawaii]] began in 1868, and to the [[Contiguous United States|mainland]] in 1869.&lt;ref name="Morimoto1997"&gt;{{cite book|title=Japanese Americans and Cultural Continuity: Maintaining Language through Heritage (Garland Reference Library of Social Science)|date=1997|publisher=Routledge|location=United Kingdom|first=Toyotomi|last=Morimoto|pages=17–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Issei]]'' parents, worrying about the increasing [[Americanization (immigration)|Americanization]] of their ''[[nisei]]'' children, established [[Nihonjin gakko|Japanese schools]] outside of the regular school system to teach the language and culture of their ancestral country.  The first school was established in [[Kohala, Hawaii]] by Reverend Shigefusa Kanda, in 1893, and others soon followed, including several attached to Hawaiian [[Hongwanji]] missions.&lt;ref name=Nakamura&gt;{{cite web|last=Nakamura |first=Kelli Y. |url=http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Japanese%20language%20schools/ |title=Japanese language schools |publisher=Densho Encyclopedia |accessdate=2014-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The schools were financed by both the Japanese immigrant community and the sugar planters they worked for, as they provided much needed childcare for the plantation laborers during their long workday.&lt;ref name=Nakamura/&gt; By 1920, the schools enrolled 98% of all Japanese American children in Hawaii. Statistics for 1934 showed 183 schools teaching a total of 41,192 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Survey of the Japanese Language Schools in Hawaii|last=Harada|first=Koichi Glenn|location=Honolulu|publisher=University of Hawaii|date=1934|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Moral Education in Pre-War Japanese Language Schools in Hawaii|first=Mariko|last=Takagi|location=Honolulu|publisher=University of Hawaii|date=1987|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Asato2005"&gt;{{cite book|title=Teaching Mikadoism: The Attack on Japanese Language Schools in Hawaii, California, and Washington, 1919-1927|last=Asato|first=Noriko|date=September 2005|publisher=University of Hawaii|location=Honolulu}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the mainland, the first Japanese language school was California's ''Nihongo Gakuin'', established in 1903; by 1912, eighteen such schools had been set up in California alone.&lt;ref name="Morimoto1997"/&gt;

The schools' perceived connection to Japan and support for labor movements, including the 1909 and [[Oahu Sugar Strike of 1920|1920 strikes]] against the [[Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association]], exposed fault lines of religion and class within the Japanese American community, and fed growing [[Anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States|anti-Japanese sentiment]] from the larger public. Buddhist organizations were heavily involved in the establishment of schools, and, while many Japanese American Christians founded their own competing schools, others ascribing to a more assimilationist view opposed their existence.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Furthermore, non-Japanese also took a dim view of the schools, accusing them of indoctrinating Japanese American children and forming part of a wider strategy of the Japanese government to "colonize" the United States; public school teachers and the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]] went so far as to label them "anti-American".&lt;ref name="Asato2005"/&gt; Anti-Japanese prejudice had grown with their population, and [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] groups spent much of the late 19th and early 20th centuries lobbying to [[Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907|limit Japanese immigration]], create race-based restrictions on citizenship, [[Alien land laws|enact discriminatory property laws]], and otherwise combat the "[[Yellow Peril]]"; by the 1920s, the focus had shifted to Japanese language schools. A 1920 report by the Federal Commission of Education declared that the 20,000 students of Hawaii's 163 Japanese schools were being "retarded in accepting American customs, manners, ideals, principles, and standards," and recommended the schools be taken over by the public education system.&lt;ref name=Nakamura/&gt; The territorial legislature had already passed a series of laws regulating who could teach and how often students could attend classes, and in April 1923 the Clark Bill imposed a per-student tax, forcing many schools to close when they could not (or would not) pay the tax.&lt;ref name=Nakamura/&gt;&lt;ref name=Niiya&gt;Niiya, Brian. ''Japanese American History: An A-to-Z Reference from 1868 to the Present'' (1993), p 190.&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, California politicians enacted the Parker Bill in August 1921, establishing extensive prerequisites for teacher certification and giving complete control over hiring, operations and curricula in the schools to the Superintendent of Public Education.&lt;ref name=Nakamura/&gt; Late in December 1922, sixteen Hawaiian schools banded together to file a lawsuit challenging the restrictions. The legal case was controversial within the Japanese American community; its more conservative members saw the lawsuit as yet another unnecessary wedge between Japanese Americans and whites, and argued that it would only exacerbate anti-Japanese prejudice. 88 of Hawaii's 146 Japanese schools eventually joined the suit, and [[Farrington v. Tokushige]] worked through several appeals before landing in the Supreme Court, where in 1927 the Justices found the regulations unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=Niiya/&gt;

===World War II===
Interest from [[foreign language]] learners was limited prior to World War II, and instruction for non-heritage speakers was established more slowly. One 1934 survey found only eight universities in the United States offering Japanese language education, mostly supported by only one instructor per university; it further estimated that only thirteen American professors possessed sufficient fluency in the Japanese language to use it in conducting research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Takagi|first=Yasaka|title=Japanese Studies in the Universities and Colleges of the United States: Survey for 1934|location=Honolulu|publisher=Institute of Pacific Relations|date=1935}}&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1940, there were only 65 non-[[Japanese American]]s who were able to read, write and understand the language.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Beate Sirota Gordon]]'s commencement address at [[Mills College]] on May 14, 2011. {{cite web|url=http://www.c-span.org/Events/Sotomayor-Denzel-Washington-GE-CEO-Speak-to-Graduates/10737421758-10/|title=Sotomayor, Denzel Washington, GE CEO Speak to Graduates|work=C-SPAN (US)|date=May 30, 2011|accessdate=2011-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even among ''nisei'' graduates of the community Japanese schools, true fluency was rare: a 1941 [[Military Intelligence Service]] survey of 3,700 ''nisei'' found that 3 percent could potentially become competent after extensive training, 4 percent were "proficient" but still required additional instruction, and just 3 percent were qualified for linguistic work in Japanese.&lt;ref name=Nakamura/&gt; Due to this shortage, the military's need for personnel competent in Japanese even before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor|US entry into World War II]] drove the MIS to establish its own specialized school aimed at training specialists to serve as interpreters, interrogators, and translators, the [[Military Intelligence Service Language School]]; initially based at the [[Presidio of San Francisco]], it was later moved to [[Minnesota]], first [[Camp Savage]], and then later [[Fort Snelling]]. Most of the 6,000 graduates were Japanese American.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Japanese American Women in World War II|booktitle=Echos of Silence: The Untold Stories of the Nisei Soldiers Who Served in WWII|url=http://www.javadc.org/AJA%20women_in_wwII.htm|publisher=AJA WWII Memorial Alliance|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nakamura |first=Kelli Y. |url=http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Military_Intelligence_Service/ |title=Military Intelligence Service |publisher=Densho Encyclopedia |accessdate=2014-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Japanese language schools on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] aimed at heritage speakers were shut down due to the [[Japanese American internment]]. Japanese school instructors and principals were among those [[FBI Index#Custodial Detention Index|detained by the FBI]]  after Pearl Harbor, so many schools had already closed by the time "evacuation" orders were issued in the spring of 1942.&lt;ref name=Nakamura/&gt; Even in Hawaii, which was not affected by [[Executive Order 9066]] but was instead placed under martial law, authorities forced Japanese community schools to dissolve and liquidate their assets; however, after the war, the schools were revived with the support of ''issei'', ''nisei'', and non-Japanese community members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shimada|first=Noriko|title=Wartime Dissolution and Revival of the Japanese Language Schools in Hawai'i: Persistence of Ethnic Culture|journal=[[Journal of Asian American Studies]]|volume=1|issue=2|date=June 1998|pages=121–151|doi=10.1353/jaas.1998.0022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enrollment in such schools declined compared to the pre-war period; for example, the Moiliili Language School in [[Honolulu]], which with over 1,000 students in 1938 was the largest Japanese-language school in Hawaii, had only 85 students {{As of|2002|lc=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://starbulletin.com/2002/12/29/news/story9.html|last=Fujimori|first=Leila|date=2002-12-29|accessdate=2007-03-15|title=Japanese school marks centennial|publisher=Hawaii Star-Bulletin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese-language education aimed at [[native speaker]]s began later, as the rise of the [[economy of Japan]] resulted in increasing numbers of companies sending employees and their families to the United States for short-term assignments. {{As of|2010}}, the Japanese [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] officially recognized four Japanese ''[[nihonjin gakkō]]'' day schools in the United States,&lt;ref name=Tsukudap604&gt;Tsukuda, Yoko.

==Japanese education in the U.S. today==

Currently, Japanese is not a widely-available college major in the United States. 132 colleges in the United States (including U.S.  territories) offer Japanese as an undergraduate major, while this number drops to 123 when excluding 2-year institutions. Comparatively, Mandarin Chinese, another East Asian language not usually taught in pre-collegiate schooling, fares better, with 129 4-year universities with Mandarin Chinese as a major. This increases to 133 when taking 2-year colleges into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=College Search|url=https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/college-search?major=581_Japanese|website=Big Future|publisher=CollegeBoard|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for Japanese postgraduate programs, there are 23 in the U.S. (with 44 programs for Chinese, in comparison).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=23 institutions offering Masters Degrees Japanese Language courses in the USA|url=http://www.hotcoursesabroad.com/study/training-degrees/us-usa/masters/japanese-language-courses/loc/211/slevel/57-3-3/cgory/fn.836-4/sin/ct/programs.html|website=Hotourses Abroad|publisher=Hotcourses Group|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is out of the 4,726 degree-granting institutions in the United States that the National Center for Educational Statistics recorded in 2012-2013.&lt;ref name="Fast Facts"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fast Facts|url=https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=84|publisher=National Center for Education Statistics|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the Modern Language Association, there has been a 10.3% increase in enrollment in Japanese classes in colleges and universities from 2006 (at 66,605 enrolled) to 2009 (at 73,434 enrolled). According to the Japan Foundation, the increase was 19.7% in the same period.&lt;ref name="japantoday.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Landsberg|first1=Eddie|title=Demand for Japanese language instruction in U.S. skyrocketing|url=https://www.japantoday.com/category/opinions/view/demand-for-japanese-language-instruction-in-u-s-skyrocketing|accessdate=24 February 2017|agency=Japan Today|date=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese in pre-collegiate education has not seen the same growth rates. In 2011-2012, there were 129,189 public and private primary and secondary schools in the US. Of this number, 30,861 were private and 98,328 were public (including charter schools). In 2007-2008, these numbers were 132,446, 33,740, and 98,916, respectively.&lt;ref name="Fast Facts"/&gt; In 2008, the Center for Applied Linguistics found that the number of Japanese classes taught in primary and secondary schools dropped from their numbers in 1987. The organization did not specify the exact numbers of any year in their executive summary of their national survey of foreign language teaching in U.S. schools, however. The number of foreign language classes in total dropped in this time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rhodes|first1=Nancy C.|last2=Pufahl|first2=Ingrid|title=Foreign Language Teaching in U.S. Schools: Results of a National Survey|url=http://www.cal.org/what-we-do/projects/national-k-12-foreign-language-survey|website=Center for Applied Linguistics|publisher=Center for Applied Linguistics|accessdate=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Pre-collegiate institutions are increasing optional Japanese testing. The AP Test has a Japanese Language and Culture test, which had 666 secondary schools that offered AP Exams to one or more students, and 329 participating colleges in 2016. 2,481 students, from earlier than the 9th grade to the 12th graders, took the test in total, which was a 2% increase from 2015’s total of 2,431 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AP Program Participation and Performance Data 2016|url=https://research.collegeboard.org/programs/ap/data/participation/ap-2016|website=CollegeBoard|publisher=CollegeBoard|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of textbook pedagogy==

[[Eleanor Jorden|Dr. Eleanor Harz Jorden]], the author of Beginning Japanese, Parts 1 and 2, wrote the first pedagogical grammar of Japanese written by a linguist.&lt;ref name="japantoday.com"/&gt; She also coauthored the widely used Mastering Japanese textbook, along with the Foreign Service Language Institute, and Hamako Ito Chaplin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mastering Japanese|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/mastering-japanese-hear-it-speak-it-write-it-read-it/oclc/48607624|website=WorldCat|publisher=WorldCat|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colleagues in the field of Japanese pedagogy, such as Professor Mari Noda, say that Dr. Jorden was unusual in her time in that she insisted on the use of audio recordings to supplement the text-based grammar and vocabulary in her work.&lt;ref name="japantoday.com"/&gt; She considered social interaction and vocal language the focus of her research. Noda remade Mastering Japanese into Japanese: The Spoken Language, which is part of a larger series on Japanese that also focuses on other aspects such as the written language.
Japanese textbook dialogues have changed since the 1970s. Dialogues from the 1970s were thought to be less natural and practical than they should be by educators like Jorden.

After Dr. Jorden’s time, the trend of Japanese as a Foreign Language (JFL) has been to focus on reading, writing, and grammar chapters arranged by themes based on pragmatic, real-life situations. Some emphasis is also placed on communicative, “real” language. For instance, in each of the two Genki textbooks, published by the Japan Times, the content is split between a Dialogue and Grammar section and a Reading and Writing section. In the Dialogue and Grammar section, the chapters have themes such as “Asking for Directions” or “Finding a Part-Time Job”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Genki–Contents and Time Requirements|url=http://genki.japantimes.co.jp/about_en/about03_en|website=Genki Online|publisher=Japan Times|accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chapter has a long conversation, or two shorter ones, recorded on the accompanying CD-ROM, and a transcript and English translations of the conversation. Then, there is a vocabulary list with relevant definitions, grammatical lessons, and several problems (which may or may not have vocal narration in the CD). The Reading and Writing section has simple stories written in Japanese, comprehension questions about the stories, kanji with space provided for writing them, and some short cultural explanations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Banno|first1=Eri|last2=Ikeda|first2=Yoko|last3=Ohno|first3=Yutaka|last4=Shinagawa|first4=Chikako|last5=Tokashiki|first5=Kyoko|title=Genki: An Integrated Course in Elementary Japanese|date=October 2011|publisher=The Japan Times, Ltd.|location=Tokyo|isbn=978-4-7890-1443-4|page=208|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Junko Mori, Kimberly Jones, and Tsuyoshi Ono believe that use of cultural and discourse knowledge may be lacking in classrooms, making it so that students aren’t totally prepared for real-life interactions with native Japanese speakers. Mori used the example of ''doushite'', a Japanese word for “why” that is frequently used in Japanese textbooks and exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Kimberly|last2=Ono|first2=Tsuyoshi|title=Discourse-Centered Approaches to Japanese Language Pedagogy|journal=Japanese Language and Literature|date=October 2005|volume=39|issue=2|jstor=30038901}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a convenient counterpart for the English “why,” but has more forceful, negative connotations for Japanese speakers than “why” does for English speakers. The required sentence structure for answers to “why”-questions is more complicated, and requires that a creative explanation be formulated. Thus, according to her, ''doushite'' needs to be placed in social context more so than other grammatical terms, but often isn’t—the exchanges are used primarily as exchanges of information rather than social tools. In conversations between Japanese speakers that Mori compiled, ''doushite'' was rarely used at all to elicit information. A survey of dialogues in modern textbooks found that they are, on average, short and decontextualized, involve only two speakers, are contextless, arranged in neat question-answer pairs that are complete sentences, and are without many conversational linguistic devices.

'''Julia Fish''' (born 1950) is an American artist whose paintings have a deceptive simplicity.&lt;ref name="1994 Feb Chicago Reader"/&gt; She paints in oil on stretched rectangular canvases of varying size.&lt;ref name="2013 Warnock article"/&gt; By means of close observation of everyday subjects&amp;mdash;leaves of a tree seen through a window, a section of floor tiles, an old fashioned light fixture&amp;mdash; she makes, as one critic says, "quiet, abstract manifestations of observed realities."&lt;ref name="2010 AIC Lecture Video"/&gt; She is a studio artist who paints not what she sees in an instant but rather what she observes continuously, day after day. The result, she says, is not so much temporal as durational.  Her paintings compress many instances of observation so as to become, as she sees it, "a parallel system to a lived experience."&lt;ref name="2006 Driehaus Video"/&gt; The paintings lack spacial orientation and, as a critic says, can "be described as both highly realistic and abstract without compromising either term."&lt;ref name="2010 AIC Lecture Video"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Renaissance Society Julia Fish 1985-1995"/&gt; In 2008, Alan G. Artner, writing in the ''Chicago Tribune'', said "This is work of small refinements and adjustments. The world of everyday things generates it, but Fish's qualities of seeing and touch elevate the things to a plane on which they leave behind their humble character."&lt;ref name="2008 May Tribune"/&gt;

==Early life and training==

In 1950 Fish was born on the Oregon coast in the small community of [[Toledo, Oregon|Toledo]] .&lt;ref name="Julia Fish Artist Web Site"/&gt; She has said that her parents, who refused to have a television in their house, guided her to develop an early interest in reading, drawing, and music.&lt;ref name="1994 Feb Chicago Reader"/&gt; She attended the Museum Art School of the [[Pacific Northwest College of Art]] in Portland, Oregon, and there obtained a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1976. She later praised the high quality of that school's teachers, the intensity of its classes, and a prevailing atmosphere which encouraged close interaction among its students.&lt;ref name="PNCA Magazine 2010"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|In a 2010 interview, Fish named Robert Hanson, Anne Johnson, Harry Widman, George Johanson, Eunice Parsons, Lenny Pitkin as great teachers whose classes she took.&lt;ref name="PNCA Magazine 2010"/&gt; }} After graduating from PNCA she crossed the continent to attend the Mount Royal School of Art within the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]], Baltimore, Maryland, obtaining a Master of Fine Arts degree in 1982.&lt;ref name="Julia Fish Artist Web Site"/&gt; 
 
==Career==

===Iowa, 1982-1985===

Between 1982 and 1985 Fish was a visiting artist and assistant professor of painting and drawing at the [[University of Iowa]], Iowa City, Iowa.&lt;ref name="Julia Fish Artist Web Site"/&gt; During her student years she had made large, abstract paintings.&lt;ref name="1994 Feb Chicago Reader"/&gt; After the move to Iowa, her work became smaller and less abstract. She has said that, in part, she felt an emotional connection with to the landscape paintings of [[John Frederick Kensett]], [[Martin Johnson Heade]], and [[Albert Pinkham Ryder]].

In 1984 Fish was given a solo exhibition called "Drawings 1976 -1984" at  [[Lane Community College]] in Eugene, Oregon.&lt;ref name="Julia Fish Artist Web Site"/&gt;  That year she also participated in a faculty exhibition at the [[University of Iowa Museum of Art]] and in the late 1970s and early 1980s her work appeared in group shows at [[Mount Hood Community College]] (in 1978 with Esther Podemski); the [[Hallie Ford Museum of Art]]; [[Willamette University]] ("Oregon Women Artists" 1979); [[Linfield College]], McMinnville, Oregon ("Current Concerns" 1983); and the Meyerhoff Gallery in the Maryland Institute College of Art ("Ten Years, Mount Royal School of Painting" 1985).&lt;ref name="Julia Fish Artist Web Site"/&gt;

===Chicago===

====1985-1990====

In 1985 Fish moved to Chicago.&lt;ref name="Julia Fish Artist Web Site"/&gt; At that time or sometime during the previous few years she married the sculptor, Richard Rezac.  Like her, he was a graduate of PNCA (B.F.A. 1974)  and MICA (M.F.A. 1982).&lt;ref name="1996 Dec Tribune"/&gt;

That year she showed in commercial galleries for the first time: an invitational show at a gallery called Feature, Inc. concurrent with a group exhibition at the Rhona Hoffman Gallery, both in Chicago.&lt;ref name="Julia Fish Artist Web Site"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|Both galleries specialized in contemporary art. The Feature, Inc. was set up in 1984 by an artist who used only his surname, Hudson. He moved the gallery to New York in 1988 where he became known for introducing new artists who would later develop successful careers.&lt;ref name="2014 Feb NYT feature gallery"/&gt; The Rhona Hoffman gallery opened in 1976 by Rhona Hoffman and her husband Donald Young. Since 1983 Hoffman has run it independently and is now considered to be one of the most influential proponents of contemporary art in Chicago.&lt;ref name="Rhona Hoffman Chicago magazine 2015"/&gt; }} In 1986 she participated in a dual exhibition at Feature, Inc. along with her husband and in two other group shows, one at the [[Hyde Park Art Center]]  and the other at the Robbin Lockett Gallery.&lt;ref name="Julia Fish Artist Web Site"/&gt; The name of the last of these shows, "Abstracted Landscapes," indicates the nature of her paintings at this time. A critic called them "reticent pieces," free of bombast, that were "romantic, hazy, and soft-edged in form" and said they were not so much landscapes as the memoir of landscapes.&lt;ref name="1986 Aug Tribune"/&gt; Fish's work appeared again at the Robbin Lockett Gallery in one solo (1987) and two group shows (1988 and 1991).{{refn|group=note|In 1986 Fish had appeared with twelve other young artists in the Robbin Lockett Gallery's very first exhibition. Lockett, who was herself only 27 years old at the time, closed the gallery eight years later saying that Chicago did not provide enough support for cutting-edge contemporary art.&lt;ref name="1992 Jul Chicago Tribune"/&gt; Alan G. Artner of the ''Chicago Tribune'' said at this time, "Fish does not paint from nature but creates mirrors of herself that embody a good deal of rural or bucolic experience."&lt;ref name="1987 Apr Tribune"/&gt; }} At the time of her 1988 appearance at this gallery a critic said Fish was one of the fortunate few among Chicago artists who was able to sell all that she exhibited and had a waiting list of collectors willing to buy. The wait might be a long one since Fish worked slowly.{{refn|group=note|Fish said at the time that she did not want demand for her work to affect her. The intrinsic value of each painting is what is important, she said, not the reputation of the artist. She said "what's really remarkable is when someone I don't even know tells me they respond to my work, which is happening more and more. That's something I cherish, and it's more valuable to me than anything else. Four years ago, if you'd told me I'd be in this position, I wouldn't have believed it."&lt;ref name="1988 May Chicago Tribune"/&gt; }} In 1987 Fish participated in the inaugural exhibition of José Freire's Fiction/Nonfiction Gallery in Manhattan's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]], her first appearance in a New York gallery.&lt;ref name="Julia Fish Artist Web Site"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|Fiction/Nonfiction was a small gallery located at 10th Street and Avenue B. It was created by José Freire who, having lost his job in a local gallery, decided to open one of his own. He moved it first to [[SoHo, Manhattan|SoHo]] in 1989 and later to [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]]. He closed it before partnering with Lisa Ruyter in 1996 to found the [[Team Gallery]] in SoHo which, like Fiction/Nonfiction, specializes in young contemporary artists.&lt;ref name="2016 José Freire interview Artspace"/&gt;  }} Since that early appearance Fish has frequently exhibited in Manhattan galleries including the Loughelton Gallery (solo,1988 and 1989), the Amy Lipton Gallery (solo 1992), the Lipton-Owens Company (solo, 1995), Feigen Contemporary (group 1998, solo 1999), the [[Hollis Taggart Galleries]] (group 2015), and the David Nolan Gallery (solo 2015, group 2016).&lt;ref name="Julia Fish Artist Web Site"/&gt;

In 1988 Fish described the slow process by which most of her work evolved. She said, "It's very unusual that I'll see something, go to the studio, draw it and paint it. That rarely happens. I'll see it and it will stay in my head for a while, and maybe later I'll try to figure out through drawing what I saw. But sometimes it's a delay of two months, or four or six. That's part of the distilling, getting a sense of what's literal there, what's tangible and intangible, what's abstract and some other kind of order."&lt;ref name="1988 Aug Tribune"/&gt;

In 1989 Fish contributed a painting called "Rock" in her first museum exhibition in Chicago. Held by the [[Renaissance Society]], the show paired one piece from each of twenty-three artists with one of the Date paintings by the Japanese artist [[On Kawara]].&lt;ref name="1989 Renaissance On Kawara"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|On Kawara began making Date paintings on January 4, 1966. Each consists of a date, recorded in the language and grammatical conventions of the country in which he was resident at the time. Most are done in acrylic paint, white on black, on canvases of eight inches by ten inches or larger.&lt;ref name="2012 Feb NYT"/&gt; }} She participated in other Renaissance Society group shows in 1994 and 1996, and was given a solo exhibition in 2015 (discussed below).&lt;ref name="Julia Fish Artist Web Site"/&gt;

====1990-2000====
[[File:Julia Fish, 1998 Entry Fragment Two.jpg|thumb|Julia Fish, Entry (Fragment Two), 1998, oil on canvas, 17.5 x 16.5 inches]] 
[[File:Julia Fish, Detail from 2010 Threshold One.jpg|thumb|Detail (bottom right) from: Julia Fish, Threshold, NorthWest—One (spectrum: violet with grey), 2010-2011, 2014, oil on canvas, 23 x 38 inches]]

In the early 1990s Fish began making small paintings of objects in her immediate environment generally showing a section rather than the entire unit. These subjects included part of a brick wall, the winter sky seen through a window, hexagonal tiles on a bathroom floor, and tar paper siding on a neighboring building. A reviewer said, "There is something comforting, and charismatically fascinating in staring at these familiar patterns."&lt;ref name="Julia Fish Frieze"/&gt; Of this new work she said, "I encounter the subjects continually so they become extremely familiar, though I don't work from observation. I don't place the canvas next to the window and paint what's outside. I don't look at the subject and paint at the same time. So there's memory and recollection in the work, but time is telescoped."&lt;ref name="1996 Jan Tribune"/&gt;

The floor tile paintings appeared on canvas in the exact dimensions of the original.&lt;ref name="2010 AIC Lecture Video"/&gt; To make them she would first trace a section of tile for use as template for a painting that would follow.&lt;ref name="2010 AIC Lecture Video"/&gt; Quoting [[Walter Benjamin]]'s comment that "to dwell means to leave traces," she said she wished such traces of personal presence to manifest themselves in her paintings .&lt;ref name="2010 AIC Lecture Video"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|Fish referred to Benjamin's statement as rendered by [[Beatriz Colomina]] in ''Privacy and Publicity: Modern Architecture As Mass Media'' (Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press, 1994). The original is found in Walter  Benjamin and Rolf Tiedemann ''The arcades project'' (Cambridge, Mass: Belknap Press, 1999). In this translation, the statement is given as "to dwell means to leave traces. " The original is "habiter signifie laisser des traces" in Walter Benjamin, ''Œuvres II: Poésie et révolution (Les Lettres Nouvelle, Denoël, 1971, p. 139. }} By 1999 she thought the floor tile project, which she called Entry, was completed. On a trip to Vienna, however, she gave close examination to the exterior of the Portois-Fix Palace designed by the architect, [[Max Fabiani]] and discovered in its facade a constantly shifting visual experience. Drawing on this discovery she made a series she called Entry (borders and corners) in 2000.&lt;ref name="2010 AIC Lecture Video"/&gt;

In 1996 the Renaissance Society mounted a solo retrospective of her work in the decade from 1985 to 1995. The exhibition's thirty-five paintings and drawings documented her transition from atmospheric subjects&amp;mdash;such as rain or sky&amp;mdash;and natural objects&amp;mdash;such as leaves or rocks&amp;mdash;to closely observed elements within and near to the prosaic urban building where she lived.&lt;ref name="Renaissance Society Julia Fish 1985-1995"/&gt; She usually retained the color of the subject, rendering it in subdued hues and subtly enhancing it in multiple thin layers of paint.&lt;ref name="1996 Jan Tribune"/&gt; In both the earlier choice of subjects and the newer one Fish used "abstraction," as she said, "to purify or distill an image."&lt;ref name="Renaissance Society Julia Fish 1985-1995"/&gt; Her paintings usually have recognizable subjects but give no illusion of depth. They are abstract in the sense that the viewer tends to concentrate on the surface of the canvas, its weave and the pigment upon it.&lt;ref name="Renaissance Society Julia Fish 1985-1995"/&gt; She achieved an elusive balance between the exact transcription of the objects she so closely observed and the abstraction of those objects on the painting's surface.&lt;ref name="1996 Jan Tribune"/&gt; She said she aimed to recast her subjects so that they retained all their properties but also incorporated her understanding of abstraction.&lt;ref name="1996 Jan Tribune"/&gt;

In addition to the Renaissance Society retrospective Fish contributed works to group and solo exhibitions at a large number museums and private galleries during the 1990s. These included the [[Miller Gallery at Carnegie Mellon University]] (group, 1990), the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago]] (groups, 1990, 1991, 1996, 1998), the [[Christopher Grimes Gallery]], Santa Monica (group, 1992, and solo, 1993, 1995, 1998), three German galleries (group, [[Berlinische Galerie]] 1994; group, Galerie Klaus Fischer 1997; group,  KunstMitte Berlin/Galerie Klaus Fischer, Berlin 1998), as well as commercial galleries in Chicago and New York.

====2000-current====

While continuing to choose her subjects from her immediate urban environment, Fish changed her approach roughly at the turn of the century. Closely observed objects such as sections of floor tile and asphalt siding gave way to abstractly rendered thresholds, stairs and stair landings, a light fixture, and floor plans of rooms in her home. Like her earlier work, these paintings, she said, were impressed on the surface of the canvas in a way that approximated the experience of seeing the same things over and over, day after day.&lt;ref name="2006 Driehaus Video"/&gt; She came to see transitions as the subject of her work, the sense of walking across a threshold, moving from room to room; or the sense of light moving through a room during the day and into it from a wall fixture at night. She understood such transitions to be both actual and metaphorical.&lt;ref name="2015 Kossak Video"/&gt; The visual elements she put on her canvases were meant to convey physical objects but also her own motion through the spaces they represented and the light that came from fixtures in the rooms and through the windows.&lt;ref name="2013 Warnock article"/&gt; The result could be seen, as one reviewer said, "as a thoughtful meditation on the nature of occupancy within a domestic environment, exactingly rendered in multiple paint layers."&lt;ref name="2013 Warnock article"/&gt;

She said her Living Rooms project evolved from her examination of Fabiani's architecture both in Vienna and other cities. When she and her husband took possession of the building in Chicago that was their home they were given a set of floor plans for the structure.  The plans and inspiration from Fabiani led to a series of drawings and paintings she created during the decade from 2001 to 2011.  She made all the paintings at the same time, keeping them in view on the walls of her studio as her ideas evolved during the period of their creation.&lt;ref name="2010 AIC Lecture Video"/&gt;  Each is one seventh the size of the room it represents and all are abstracted dramatically by elimination of elements in the plans from which she worked and by inclusion of shapes that denote motion and light.&lt;ref name="2010 AIC Lecture Video"/&gt; Her intention was to use these marks to convey life as she experienced it in the rooms.&lt;ref name="2010 AIC Lecture Video"/&gt;  Describing them as "acrobatic," she aimed to activate the marks in the eye of the observer.&lt;ref name="2013 Warnock article"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2015 Kossak Video"/&gt;

While working on the Living Rooms series, she also made a series called Stairs and Landings (2006-2007, 2009) and Thresholds (2009-2015) as well as a set of drawings and paintings of a light fixture (2014-2015).&lt;ref name="2010 AIC Lecture Video"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hyperallergic 2015"/&gt; Of the two latter sets one reviewer said, "Only by prolonged looking do you become aware of how masterful Fish is in coaxing paint to evoke something as ephemeral as a light fixture seen in the dark or the striations of light seen on a floor connecting one part of the house to another."&lt;ref name="Hyperallergic 2015"/&gt;

Fish has participated in many  group and solo shows from 2000 onward including eight appearances in group shows at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago and four at the Art Institute of Chicago. Her work appeared in three group and two solo exhibitions at the Rhona Hoffman Gallery, Chicago, and one group and one solo at the David Nolan Gallery in New York.&lt;ref name="Julia Fish Artist Web Site"/&gt; In 2010 the [[Illinois State University College of Fine Arts]] gave Fish a retrospective exhibition of studies and drawings from 1996 onward.&lt;ref name="Illinois State University 2010"/&gt; She also showed three Threshold paintings in the 2010 [[Whitney Biennial]].&lt;ref name="PNCA Magazine 2010"/&gt;

In 2015, a reviewer said of her recent work, "It is this quality of scrutiny — of looking with such focused intensity that the commonplace things in the world become mysterious — that I find compelling. Fish is able to revisit the familiar in paint so that it moves closer to its original state of incomprehensibility."&lt;ref name="Hyperallergic 2015"/&gt;

==Career==
Later, he moved to [[Mumbai]], where the emerging film industry helped him to bring Kathak to a far wider audience. Lachhu Maharaj was acclaimed for the choreography of dance sequences in movies like ''[[Mahal (1949 film)|Mahal]]'' (1949), ''[[Mughal-e-Azam]]'' (1960), ''[[Chhoti Chhoti Baten]]'' (1965) and ''[[Pakeezah]]'' (1972)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0536775/filmoyear Filmography] [[IMDB]].&lt;/ref&gt; as well as his ballets like ''Goutam Buddha'', ''Chandravali '' and ''Bharatiya Kissan''. He was also the founder Director of the Kathak Kendra started by the [[Uttar Pradesh]] Government in [[Lucknow]].

==Awards==
Among many prestigious awards he won were the Presidents' Award and the 1957 [[Sangeet Natak Akademi Award]], the highest award for performing artists, conferred by the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]], India's National Academy for Music, Dance and Drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sangeetnatak.gov.in/sna/awardeeslist.htm |title=SNA: List of Akademi Awardees |publisher=[[Sangeet Natak Akademi]] Official website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331060603/http://www.sangeetnatak.gov.in/sna/awardeeslist.htm |archivedate=31 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Organizational culture''' encompasses [[Value (ethics) | values]] and behaviors that "contribute to the unique social and psychological environment of a business. The organisational culture influences the way people interact, the context within which knowledge is created, the resistance they will have towards certain changes, and ultimately the way they share (or the way they do not share)  knowledge.  Organizational culture represents the collective values, beliefs and principles of organizational members and is a product of factors such as history, product, market, technology, strategy, type of employees, [[management style]], and national culture; culture includes the organization's [[goal | vision]], values, norms, systems, symbols, language, assumptions, environment, location,  beliefs and habits. 

[[Business executive]] Bernard L. Rosauer (2013) defines organizational culture as an ''[[emergence]]'' – an extremely complex incalculable state that results from the combination of a few ingredients. In "Three Bell Curves: Business Culture Decoded"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ThreeBellCurves.com "Three Bell Curves: Business Culture Decoded"]&lt;/ref&gt; Rosauer outlines the three manageable ingredients which (he claims) guide business culture:

# employee (focus on engagement)
# the work (focus on eliminating waste increasing value) waste
# the customer (focus on likelihood of referral)

Rosauer writes that the Three Bell Curves methodology aims to bring [[leadership]], their employees, the work and the customer together for focus without distraction, leading to an improvement in culture and brand.{{cn|date=October 2018}} He states: "If a methodology isn't memorable, it won't get used. The Three Bell Curves Methodology is simple (to remember) but execution requires strong leadership and diligence. Culture can be guided by managing the ingredients."  Reliance of the research and findings of Sirota Survey Intelligence,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sirota.com/enthusiastic-employee Sirota Survey Intelligence]&lt;/ref&gt; which has been gathering employee data worldwide since 1972, the Lean Enterprise Institute,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lean.org Lean Enterprise Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; Cambridge, MA, and Fred Reichheld/Bain/Satmetrix research relating to NetPromoterScore.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.netpromoter.com/know/ NetPromoterScore]&lt;/ref&gt;{{huh?|date=October 2018}}    
 
Ravasi and Schultz (2006) characterise organizational culture as a set of shared assumptions that guide behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ravasi | first1 = D. | last2 = Schultz | first2 = M. | year = 2006 | title = Responding to organizational identity threats: Exploring the role of organizational culture | url = | journal = Academy of Management Journal | volume = 49 | issue = 3| pages = 433–458 | doi= 10.5465/amj.2006.21794663}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the pattern of such collective behaviors and assumptions that are taught to new organizational members as a way of perceiving and, even thinking and feeling. Thus organizational culture affects the way people and groups interact with each other, with clients, and with [[Stakeholder (corporate) | stakeholder]]s. In addition, organizational culture may affect how much employees [[organizational identification | identify with an organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schrodt | first1 = P | year = 2002 | title = The relationship between organizational identification and organizational culture: Employee perceptions of culture and identification in a retail sales organization | url = | journal = Communication Studies | volume = 53 | issue = | pages = 189–202 | doi= 10.1080/10510970209388584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edgar Schein|Schein]] (1992), Deal and Kennedy (2000), and [[John Kotter|Kotter]] (1992) advanced the idea that organizations often have very differing cultures as well as subcultures.&lt;ref name=schein2009&gt;{{cite book|last= Schein|first= Edgar|authorlink= Edgar Schein|title= Organizational Culture and Leadership: A Dynamic View|year= 1992|publisher= Jossey-Bass|location= San Francisco, CA|pages= 9}}

Flamholtz and Randle (2011) suggest that one can view organizational culture as "corporate personality"&lt;ref&gt;

== Origins ==
The term of culture in the organizational context was first introduced by [[Elliott Jaques|Dr. Elliott Jaques]] in his book ''The Changing Culture of a Factory'', in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/809554483|title=Organization theory : modern, symbolic, and postmodern perspectives|last=Jo.|first=Hatch, Mary|publisher=|others=Cunliffe, Ann L.|year=|isbn=0199640378|edition=  Third|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|pages=161|oclc=809554483}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the published report of "a case study of developments in the social life of one industrial community between April, 1948 and November 1950".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/300631|title=The changing culture of a factory.|last=Elliott.|first=Jaques,|date=1951|publisher=Tavistock Publications|others=Tavistock Institute of Human Relations.|year=|isbn=0415264421|location=[London]|pages=251|oclc=300631}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "case" is a publicly held British company engaged principally in the manufacture, sale, and servicing of metal bearings. The study is concerned with the description, analysis, and development of the [[Organizational behavior|corporate group behaviours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/868980134|title=Organisational culture : concept, context, and measurement|last=Elizabeth.|first=Kummerow,|publisher=|others=Kirby, Neil., Ying, Lee Xin.|year=|isbn=9789812837837|location=New Jersey|pages=13|oclc=868980134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dr. Elliott Jaques "the culture of the factory is its customary and traditional way of thinking and doing of things, which is shared to a greater or lesser degree by all its members, and which new members must learn, and at least partially accept, in order to be accepted into service in the firm..."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In simple terms, to the extent that people can share common wishes, desires and aspirations, they can commit themselves to work together. It is a matter of being able to care about the same things, and it applies to nations as well as to associations and organizations within nations.

Elaborating on the work in ''The Changing Culture of a Factory'' Dr. Elliott Jaques in his concept of [[requisite organization]] established the list of valued entitlements or organizational values that can gain from people their full commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/36162684|title=Requisite organization : a total system for effective managerial organization and managerial leadership for the 21st century|last=Elliott.|first=Jaques,|date=1998|publisher=Cason Hall|isbn=1886436037|edition=  Rev. 2nd |location=Arlington, VA|oclc=36162684}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together they make an organizational culture or credo: 
* Fair and just treatment for everyone, including fair pay based upon equitable pay differentials for level of work and merit recognition related to personal effectiveness appraisal.
* Leadership interaction between managers and subordinates, including shared context, personal effectiveness appraisal, feedback and recognition, and coaching.
* Clear articulation of accountability and authority to engender trust and confidence in all working relationships.
* Articulation of long-term organizational vision through direct communication from the top.
* Opportunity for everyone individually or through representatives to participate in policy development.
* Work for everyone at a level consistent with their level of potential capability, values and interests.
* Opportunity for everyone to progress as his or her potential capability matures, within the opportunities available            
The role of managerial leadership at every organizational level is to make these organizational values operationally real.

== Usage ==
''Organizational culture'' refers to [[culture]] in any type of [[organization]] including that of schools, universities, not-for-profit groups, government agencies, or business entities. In business, terms such as '''corporate culture''' and '''company culture''' are often used to refer to a similar concept. The term corporate culture became widely known in the business world in the late 1980s and early 1990s.&lt;ref name="Arizona"&gt;"Culture is everything," said Lou Gerstner, the CEO who pulled IBM from near ruin in the 1990s.", [http://knowledge.wpcarey.asu.edu/article.cfm?articleid=1989 Culture Clash: When Corporate Culture Fights Strategy, It Can Cost You] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110012303/http://knowledge.wpcarey.asu.edu/article.cfm?articleid=1989 |date=2011-11-10 }}, knowmgmt, [[Arizona State University]], March 30, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="term"&gt;Unlike many expressions that emerge in business jargon, the term spread to newspapers and magazines. Few usage experts object to the term. Over 80 percent of usage experts accept the sentence ''The new management style is a reversal of GE's traditional corporate culture, in which virtually everything the company does is measured in some form and filed away somewhere.''", The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition copyright ©2000 by Houghton Mifflin Company. Updated in 2009. Published by Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Corporate culture'' was already used by managers, sociologists, and organizational theorists by the beginning of the 80s.&lt;ref name="Linda"&gt;One of the first to point to the importance of culture for organizational analysis and the intersection of [[culture theory]] and [[organization theory]] is [[Linda Smircich]] in her article Concepts of Culture and Organizational Analysis in 1983. See Linda Smircich, ''Concepts of Culture and Organizational Analysis'', Administrative Science Quarterly, Volume: 28, Issue: 3, Publisher: JSTOR, {{doi|10.2307/2392246}}, 1983, pp. 339–358&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hispanicengineer"&gt;"The term "Corporate Culture" is fast losing the academic ring it once had among U.S. manager. Sociologists and anthropologists popularized the word "culture" in its technical sense, which describes overall behavior patterns in groups. But corporate managers, untrained in sociology jargon, found it difficult to use the term unselfconsciously." in Phillip Farish, Career Talk: Corporate Culture, Hispanic Engineer, issue 1, year 1, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; The related idea of [[organizational climate]] emerged in the 1960s and 70s, and the terms are now somewhat overlapping.&lt;ref&gt;Halpin, A. W., &amp; Croft, D. B. (1963). ''The organizational climate of schools''. Chicago: Midwest Administration Center of the University of Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fred C. Lunenburg, Allan C. Ornstein, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jLvG_ASyG5AC&amp;pg=PA67 Educational Administration: Concepts and Practices]'', Cengage Learning, 2011, pp. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

If organizational culture is seen as something that characterizes an organization, it can be manipulated and altered depending on leadership and members.&lt;ref name="Modaff, D.P. 2011"&gt;Modaff, D.P., DeWine, S., &amp; Butler, J. (2011). Organizational communication: Foundations, challenges, and misunderstandings (2nd Ed.). Boston: Pearson Education. (Chapters 1–6)&lt;/ref&gt; Culture as root metaphor sees the organization as its culture, created through communication and symbols, or competing metaphors. Culture is basic, with personal experience producing a variety of perspectives.&lt;ref name="Modaff, D.P. 2011"/&gt;

The organizational communication perspective on culture views culture in three different ways:
* Traditionalism: views culture through objective things such as stories, rituals, and symbols
* Interpretivism: views culture through a network of shared meanings (organization members sharing subjective meanings)
* Critical-interpretivism: views culture through a network of shared meanings as well as the power struggles created by a similar network of competing meanings

== Strong and weak ==
Flamholtz and Randle state that: "A strong culture is that people clearly understand and can articulate. A weak culture is one that employees have difficulty defining, understanding, or explaining."&lt;ref&gt;Flamholtz and Randle, 2011, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;
''Strong culture'' is said to exist where staff respond to stimulus because of their alignment to organizational values. In such environments, strong cultures help firms operate like well-oiled machines, engaging in outstanding execution with only minor adjustments to existing procedures as needed.

Conversely, there is ''weak culture'' where there is little alignment with organizational values, and control must be exercised through extensive procedures and bureaucracy.

Research shows{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} that organizations that foster strong cultures have clear values that give employees a reason to embrace the culture. A "strong" culture may be especially beneficial to firms operating in the service sector since members of these organizations are responsible for delivering the service and for evaluations important constituents make about firms.  Organizations may derive the following benefits from developing strong and productive cultures:

* Better aligning the company towards achieving its vision, mission, and goals
* High employee [[motivation]] and [[loyalty]]
* Increased team cohesiveness among the company's various departments and divisions
* Promoting consistency and encouraging coordination and control within the company
* Shaping employee behavior at work, enabling the organization to be more efficient

[[Irving Janis]] defined groupthink as "a mode of thinking that people engage in when they are deeply involved in a cohesive in-group, when the members' strivings for unanimity override their motivation to realistically appraise alternative courses of action."&lt;ref&gt;Janis, Irving L. ''Victims of Groupthink''. Boston. Houghton Mifflin Company, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; This is a state in which even if group members have different ideas, they do not challenge organizational thinking. As a result, innovative thinking is stifled. Groupthink can lead to lack of creativity and decisions made without critical evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Argote |first1=Linda |title=Organizational Learning: Creating, Retaining and Transferring Knowledge |date=2013 |publisher=Springer |page=115-146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groupthink can occur, for example, when group members rely heavily on a central charismatic figure in the organization or where there is an "evangelical" belief in the organization's values. Groupthink can also occur in groups characterized by a friendly climate conducive to conflict avoidance.

== Healthy ==
{{quotebox|width=25em| bgcolor=#E1FFBD|align=right|''Culture is the organization's immune system. – Michael Watkins''&lt;ref name="HBR"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2013/05/what-is-organizational-culture|title=What Is Organizational Culture? And Why Should We Care?|date=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;|quote=Culture is the organization's immune system. – Michael Watkins|source=What Is Organizational Culture? And Why Should We Care? – Harvard Business Review}}

Organizations should strive for what is considered a "healthy" organizational culture in order to increase productivity, growth, efficiency and reduce counterproductive behavior and turnover of employees. A variety of characteristics describe a healthy culture, including:

* Acceptance and appreciation for diversity
* Regard for fair treatment of each employee as well as respect for each employee's contribution to the company
* Employee pride and enthusiasm for the organization and the work performed
* Equal opportunity for each employee to realize their full potential within the company
* Strong communication with all employees regarding policies and company issues
* Strong company leaders with a strong sense of direction and purpose
* Ability to compete in industry innovation and customer service, as well as price
* Lower than average turnover rates (perpetuated by a healthy culture)
* Investment in learning, training, and employee knowledge

Additionally, performance oriented cultures have been shown to possess statistically better financial growth.  Such cultures possess high employee involvement, strong internal communications and an acceptance and encouragement of a healthy level of risk-taking in order to achieve innovation. Additionally, organizational cultures that explicitly emphasize factors related to the demands placed on them by industry technology and growth will be better performers in their industries.

According to Kotter and Heskett (1992),&lt;ref name=kotter1992/&gt; organizations with adaptive cultures perform much better than organizations with unadaptive cultures. An adaptive culture translates into organizational success; it is characterized by managers paying close attention to all of their constituencies, especially customers, initiating change when needed, and taking risks. An unadaptive culture can significantly reduce a firm's effectiveness, disabling the firm from pursuing all its competitive/operational options.

Healthy companies are able to deal with employees' concerns about the well-being of the organization internally, before the employees would even feel they needed to raise the issues externally. It is for this reason that [[whistleblowing]], particularly when it results in serious damage to a company's reputation, is considered to be often a sign of a chronically dysfunctional corporate culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Skapinker|url=https://www.ft.com/content/c5059fd2-6881-11e6-ae5b-a7cc5dd5a28c|title= Lessons from the Deutsche Bank whistleblower Eric Ben-Artzi: A corporate culture must allow employees to dissent, before they take it outside the company|publisher=Financial Times|date=2016-08-24|accessdate=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another relevant concept is the notion of "cultural functionality".  Specifically, some organizations have "functional" cultures while others have   "dysfunctional" cultures.&lt;ref&gt;lamholtz and Randle, 2011, pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt; A "functional" culture is a positive culture that contributes to  an organization's performance and success. A "dysfunctional" culture is one that hampers or negatively affects  an organization's performance and success.

== Management of culture ==

There are many different types of communication that contribute in creating an organizational culture:&lt;ref&gt;Islam, Gazi and Zyphur, Michael. (2009). Rituals in organizations: A review and expansion of current theory. Group Organization Management. (34),  1140139.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Metaphors such as comparing an organization to a machine or a family reveal employees' shared meanings of experiences at the organization.
* Stories can provide examples for employees of how to or not to act in certain situations.
* Rites and ceremonies combine stories, metaphors, and symbols into one. Several different kinds of rites affect organizational culture:
** Rites of passage: employees move into new roles
** Rites of degradation: employees have power taken away from them
** Rites of enhancement: public recognition for an employee's accomplishments
** Rites of renewal: improve existing social structures
** Rites of conflict reduction: resolve arguments between certain members or groups
** Rites of integration: reawaken feelings of membership in the organization
* Reflexive comments are explanations, justifications, and criticisms of our own actions. This includes:
** Plans: comments about anticipated actions
** Commentaries: comments about action in the present
** Accounts: comments about an action or event that has already occurred
: Such comments reveal interpretive meanings held by the speaker as well as the social rules they follow.
* Fantasy Themes are common creative interpretations of events that reflect beliefs, values, and goals of the organization. They lead to rhetorical visions, or views of the organization and its environment held by organization members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://kreatywna.pl/| title=culture }} wednesday, 16 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bullying culture ==
{{Main|Bullying culture|Workplace bullying}}
Bullying is seen to be prevalent in organizations where employees and managers feel that
they have the support, or at least implicitly the blessing, of senior managers to carry on their abusive
and bullying behaviour. Furthermore, new managers will quickly come to view this form of behaviour as
acceptable and normal if they see others get away with it and are even rewarded for it.&lt;ref name="Salin D 2010"&gt;Salin D, Helge H "Organizational Causes of Workplace Bullying" in Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace: Developments in Theory, Research, and Practice (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

When bullying happens at the highest levels, the effects may be far reaching. That people may be bullied irrespective of their organisational status or rank, including senior managers, indicates the possibility of a negative ripple effect, where bullying may be cascaded downwards as the targeted supervisors might offload their own [[aggression]] on their subordinates. In such situations, a bullying scenario in the [[boardroom]] may actually threaten the [[productivity]] of the entire organisation.&lt;ref name=Organisational&gt;Helge H, Sheehan MJ, Cooper CL, Einarsen S "Organisational Effects of Workplace Bullying" in Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace: Developments in Theory, Research, and Practice (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture of fear==
{{Main|Culture of fear}}
Ashforth discussed potentially destructive sides of [[leadership]] and identified what he referred to as [[petty tyrants]], i.e. leaders who exercise a tyrannical style of management, resulting in a climate of fear in the workplace.&lt;ref name=ashforth&gt;''Petty tyranny in organizations '', Ashforth, Blake, Human Relations, Vol. 47, No. 7, 755–778 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Partial or intermittent negative [[reinforcement]] can create an effective climate of fear and [[doubt]].&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-144672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; When employees get the sense that bullies "get away with it", a climate of fear may be the result.&lt;ref name="Organisational"/&gt; Several studies have confirmed a relationship between bullying, on the one hand, and an autocratic leadership and an authoritarian way of settling [[Workplace conflict|conflicts]] or dealing with disagreements, on the other. An authoritarian style of leadership may create a climate of fear, where there is little or no room for dialogue and where complaining may be considered futile.&lt;ref name="Salin D 2010"/&gt;

In a study of public-sector union members, approximately one in five workers reported having considered [[Turnover (employment)|leaving]] the workplace as a result of witnessing bullying taking place. Rayner explained these figures by pointing to the presence of a climate of fear in which employees considered reporting to be unsafe, where bullies had "got away with it" previously despite management knowing of the presence of bullying.&lt;ref name=Organisational/&gt;

== Tribal culture ==
David Logan and coauthors have proposed in their book [[Tribal Leadership]] that organizational cultures change in stages, based on an analysis of human groups and tribal cultures. They identify five basic stages:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tribal Leadership: Leveraging Natural Groups to Build a Thriving Organization |first1=Dave |last1=Logan |first2=John |last2=King |first3=Halee |last3=Fischer-Wright |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2009 |isbn=0061251305 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Life sucks'' (a subsystem severed from other functional systems like tribes, gangs and prison—2 percent of population);
#''My life sucks'' (I am stuck in the Dumb Motor Vehicle line and can't believe I have to spend my time in this lost triangle of ineffectiveness—25 percent of population);
#''I'm great'' (and you're not, I am detached from you and will dominate you regardless of your intent—48 percent of population);
#''We are great, but other groups suck'' (citing Zappo's and an attitude of unification around more than individual competence—22 percent of population) and
#''Life is great'' (citing Desmond Tutu's hearing on truth and values as the basis of reconciliation—3 percent of population).
This model of organizational culture provides a map and context for leading an organization through the five stages.

==Personal culture==
: ''Main: [[Personality psychology]], [[Identity (social science)]]''
Organizational culture is taught to the person as culture is taught by his/her parents thus changing and modeling his/her personal culture.&lt;ref name="cindy"&gt;Cindy Gordon, [http://www.camagazine.com/archives/print-edition/2008/january-february/regulars/camagazine5413.aspx Cashing in on corporate culture], CA magazine, January–February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, employees and people applying for a job are advised to match their "personality to a company's culture" and fit to it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.careerrocketeer.com/2009/07/personality-and-corporate-culture.html Personality and Corporate Culture: Where's a Person to Fit?], Career Rocketeer, July 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers even suggested and have made case studies research on personality changing.&lt;ref&gt;Christophe Lejeune, Alain Vas, [http://www.alba.edu.gr/sites/pros/Papers/PROS-073.pdf Comparing the processes of identity change: A multiple-case study approach],&lt;/ref&gt;

==National culture==
Corporate culture is used to control, coordinate, and integrate company subsidiaries.&lt;ref name="nationalculture"&gt;Susan C. Schneider, ''[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hrm.3930270207/abstract National vs. corporate culture: Implications for human resource management]'', Human Resource Management, Volume 27, Issue 2, Summer 1988, pp. 231–246, {{doi|10.1002/hrm.3930270207}}&lt;/ref&gt; However differences in national cultures exist contributing to differences in the views on management.&lt;ref&gt;Li Dong, Keith Glaister, [https://ideas.repec.org/a/kap/asiapa/v24y2007i2p191-205.html National and corporate culture differences in international strategic alliances: Perceptions of Chinese partners (RePEc)], Asia Pacific Journal of Management, 24 (June 2007), pp. 191–205&lt;/ref&gt; Differences between national cultures are deep rooted values of the respective cultures, and these cultural values can shape how people expect companies to be run, and how relationships between leaders and followers should be, resulting in differences between the employer and the employee regarding expectations. (Geert Hofstede, 1991) Perhaps equally foundational; observing the vast differences in national copyright (and taxation, etc.) laws suggests deep rooted differences in cultural attitudes and assumptions about property rights and sometimes about the desired root function, place, or purpose of corporations relative to the population.

===Multiplicity===
: ''See also: [[Biculturalism]]''

Xibao Zhang (2009) carried out an empirical study of culture emergence in the Sino-Western international cross-cultural management (SW-ICCM) context in China. Field data were collected by interviewing Western expatriates and Chinese professionals working in this context, supplemented by non-participant observation and documentary data. The data were then analyzed objectively to formulate theme-based substantive theories and a formal theory.

The major finding of this study is that the human cognition contains three components, or three broad types of "cultural rules of behavior", namely, Values, Expectations, and Ad Hoc Rules, each of which has a mutually conditioning relationship with behavior. The three cognitive components are different in terms of the scope and duration of their mutual shaping of behavior. Values are universal and enduring rules of behavior; Expectations, on the other hand, are context-specific behavioral rules; while Ad Hoc Rules are improvised rules of behavior that the human mind devises contingent upon a particular occasion. Furthermore, they need not be consistent, and frequently are not, among themselves. Metaphorically, they can be compared to a multi-carriage train, which allows for the relative lateral movements by individual carriages so as to accommodate bumps and turns in the tracks. In fact, they provide a "shock-absorber mechanism", so to speak, which enables individuals in SW-ICCM contexts to cope with conflicts in cultural practices and values, and to accommodate and adapt themselves to cultural contexts where people from different national cultural backgrounds work together over extended time. It also provides a powerful framework which explains how interactions by individuals in SW-ICCM contexts give rise to emerging hybrid cultural practices characterized by both stability and change.

One major theoretical contribution of this "multi-carriage train" perspective is its allowance for the existence of inconsistencies among the three cognitive components in their mutual conditioning of behavior. This internal inconsistency view is in stark contrast to the traditional internal consistency assumption explicitly or tacitly held by many culture scholars. The other major theoretical contribution, which follows logically from the first one, is to view culture as an overarching entity which is made of a multiplicity of Values, Expectations, and Ad Hoc Rules. This notion of one (multiplicity) culture to an organization leads to the classification of culture along its path of emergence into nascent, adolescent, and mature types, each of which is distinct in terms of the pattern of the three cognitive components and behavior.

==Effects==
Research suggests that numerous outcomes have been associated either directly or indirectly with organizational culture.   A healthy and robust organizational culture may provide various benefits, including the following:

* Competitive edge derived from innovation and customer service
* Consistent, efficient employee performance
* Team cohesiveness
* High employee morale
* Strong company alignment towards goal achievement

Although little empirical research exists to support the link between organizational culture and organizational performance, there is little doubt among experts that this relationship exists.  Organizational culture can be a factor in the survival or failure of an organization – although this is difficult to prove given that the necessary longitudinal analyses are hardly feasible.  The sustained superior performance of firms like [[IBM]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], and [[McDonald's]] may be, at least partly, a reflection of their organizational cultures.

A 2003 [[Harvard Business School]] study reported that culture has a significant effect on an organization's long-term economic performance. The study examined the management practices at 160 organizations over ten years and found that culture can enhance performance or prove detrimental to performance.  Organizations with strong performance-oriented cultures witnessed far better financial growth.  Additionally, a 2002 Corporate Leadership Council study found that cultural traits such as risk taking, internal communications, and flexibility are some of the most important drivers of performance, and may affect individual performance.  Furthermore, innovativeness, productivity through people, and the other cultural factors cited by [[Tom Peters|Peters]] and [[Robert H. Waterman, Jr.|Waterman]] (1982) also have positive economic consequences.

Denison, Haaland, and Goelzer (2004) found that culture contributes to the success of the organization, but not all dimensions contribute the same.  It was found that the effects of these dimensions differ by global regions, which suggests that organizational culture is affected by national culture.  Additionally, Clarke (2006) found that a safety climate is related to an organization's safety record.

Organizational culture is reflected in the way people perform tasks, set objectives, and administer the necessary resources to achieve objectives.  Culture affects the way individuals make decisions, feel, and act in response to the opportunities and threats affecting the organization.

Adkins and Caldwell (2004) found that job satisfaction was positively associated with the degree to which employees fit into both the overall culture and subculture in which they worked.   A perceived mismatch of the organization's culture and what employees felt the culture should be is related to a number of negative consequences including lower job satisfaction, higher job strain, general stress, and turnover intent.

It has been proposed that organizational culture may affect the level of employee creativity, the strength of employee motivation, and the reporting of unethical behavior, but more research is needed to support these conclusions.

Organizational culture also affects recruitment and retention.  Individuals tend to be attracted to and remain engaged in organizations that they perceive to be compatible.  Additionally, high turnover may be a mediating factor in the relationship between culture and organizational performance.  Deteriorating company performance and an unhealthy work environment are signs of an overdue cultural assessment.

==Change==
When an organization does not possess a healthy culture or requires some kind of organizational culture change, the change process can be daunting. Organizational culture can hinder new change efforts, especially where employees know their expectations and the roles that they are supposed to play in the organization. This is corroborated by Mar (2016:1) who argues that 70% of all change efforts fail because of the culture of an organization's employees. One major reason why such change is difficult is that organizational cultures, and the organizational structures in which they are embedded, often reflect the "imprint" of earlier periods in a persistent way and exhibit remarkable levels of inertia.&lt;ref name=Marquis&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Culture change may be necessary to reduce employee turnover, influence employee behavior, make improvements to the company, refocus the company objectives and/or rescale the organization, provide better customer service, and/or achieve specific company goals and results. Culture change is affected by a number of elements, including the external environment and industry competitors, change in industry standards, technology changes, the size and nature of the workforce, and the organization's history and management.

There are a number of methodologies specifically dedicated to organizational culture change such as [[Peter Senge]]'s ''Fifth Discipline''. There are also a variety of psychological approaches that have been developed into a system for specific outcomes such as the ''Fifth Discipline's'' "learning organization" or ''Directive Communication's'' "corporate culture evolution." Ideas and strategies, on the other hand, seem to vary according to particular influences that affect culture.

Burman and Evans (2008) argue that it is '[[leadership]]' that affects culture rather than '[[management]]', and describe the difference. When one wants to change an aspect of the culture of an organization one has to keep in consideration that this is a long term project. Corporate culture is something that is very hard to change and employees need time to get used to the new way of organizing. For companies with a very strong and specific culture it will be even harder to change.

Prior to a cultural change initiative, a needs assessment is needed to identify and understand the current organizational culture.  This can be done through employee surveys, interviews, focus groups, observation, customer surveys where appropriate, and other internal research, to further identify areas that require change.  The company must then assess and clearly identify the new, desired culture, and then design a change process.

Cummings &amp; Worley (2004, p.&amp;nbsp;491 – 492) give the following six guidelines for cultural change, these changes are in line with the [[Kotter's 8-Stage Change Model|eight distinct stages]] mentioned by Kotter (1995, p.&amp;nbsp;2):
# Formulate a clear strategic vision (stage 1, 2, and 3). In order to make a cultural change effective a clear vision of the firm's new strategy, shared values and behaviors is needed. This vision provides the intention and direction for the culture change (Cummings &amp; Worley, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;490).
# Display top-management commitment (stage 4). It is very important to keep in mind that culture change must be managed from the top of the organization, as willingness to change of the senior management is an important indicator (Cummings &amp; Worley, 2004, page 490). The top of the organization should be very much in favor of the change in order to actually implement the change in the rest of the organization. De Caluwé &amp; Vermaak (2004, p 9) provide a framework with five different ways of thinking about change.
# Model culture change at the highest level (stage 5). In order to show that the management team is in favor of the change, the change has to be notable at first at this level. The behavior of the management needs to symbolize the kinds of values and behaviors that should be realized in the rest of the company. It is important that the management shows the strengths of the current culture as well; it must be made clear that the current organizational culture does not need radical changes, but just a few adjustments. (See for more: Deal &amp; Kennedy, 1982;&lt;ref name=dealkennedy/&gt; Sathe, 1983; Schall; 1983; Weick, 1985; DiTomaso, 1987). This process may also include creating committees, employee task forces, value managers, or similar. Change agents are key in the process and key communicators of the new values.  They should possess courage, flexibility, excellent interpersonal skills, knowledge of the company, and patience. As McCune (May 1999) puts it, these individuals should be catalysts, not dictators.
# The fourth step is to modify the organization to support organizational change.  This includes identifying what current systems, policies, procedures and rules need to be changed in order to align with the new values and desired culture.  This may include a change to accountability systems, compensation, benefits and reward structures, and recruitment and retention programs to better align with the new values and to send a clear message to employees that the old system and culture are in the past.
# Select and socialize newcomers and terminate deviants (stage 7 &amp; 8  of Kotter, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;2). A way to implement a culture is to connect it to organizational membership, people can be selected and terminated in terms of their fit with the new culture (Cummings &amp; Worley, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;491). Encouraging employee motivation and loyalty to the company is key and will also result in a healthy culture. The company and change managers should be able to articulate the connections between the desired behavior and how it will affect and improve the company's success, to further encourage buy-in in the change process. Training should be provided to all employees to understand the new processes, expectations and systems.
# Develop ethical and legal sensitivity. Changes in culture can lead to tensions between organizational and individual interests, which can result in ethical and legal problems for practitioners. This is particularly relevant for changes in employee integrity, control, equitable treatment and job security (Cummings &amp; Worley, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;491). It is also beneficial, as part of the change process, to include an evaluation process, conducted periodically to monitor the change progress and identify areas that need further development. This step will also identify obstacles of change and resistant employees, and acknowledge and reward employee improvement, which will encourage continued change and evolvement. It may also be helpful and necessary to incorporate new change managers to refresh the process. Outside consultants may also be useful in facilitating the change process and providing employee training. Change of culture in organizations is very important and inevitable. Cultural innovation&lt;ref&gt;Molly Rose Teuke, [http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/profit/features/p17andrew-143871.html Creating culture of innovation], Oracle Magazine, February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; is bound to be more difficult than cultural maintenance because it entails introducing something new and substantially different from what prevails in existing cultures. People often resist changes, hence it is the duty of management to convince people that likely gain will outweigh the losses. Besides institutionalization, deification is another process that tends to occur in strongly developed organizational cultures. The organization itself may come to be regarded as precious in itself, as a source of pride, and in some sense unique. The organization's members begin to feel a strong bond with it that transcends material returns, and they begin to identify with it. The organization turns into a sort of clan.

===Mergers and cultural leadership===
One of the biggest obstacles in the way of the merging of two organizations is organizational culture. Each organization has its own unique culture and most often, when brought together, these cultures clash. When mergers fail employees point to issues such as identity, communication problems, human resources problems, ego clashes, and inter-group conflicts, which all fall under the category of "cultural differences".

One way to combat such difficulties is through cultural leadership. Organizational leaders must also be cultural leaders and help facilitate the change from the two old cultures into the one new culture. This is done through cultural innovation followed by cultural maintenance.
* Cultural innovation includes:
** Creating a new culture: recognizing past cultural differences and setting realistic expectations for change
** Changing the culture: weakening and replacing the old cultures
* Cultural maintenance includes:
** Integrating the new culture: reconciling the differences between the old cultures and the new one
** Embodying the new culture: Establishing, affirming, and keeping the new culture

==Corporate subcultures==
Corporate culture is the total sum of the values, customs, traditions, and meanings that make a company unique. Corporate culture is often called "the character of an organization", since it embodies the vision of the company's founders.  The values of a corporate culture influence the ethical standards within a corporation, as well as managerial behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Montana, P., and Charnov, B. (2008) Management (4th ed.), Barrons Educational Series, Hauppauge:NY&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Senior management]] may try to determine a ''corporate culture''. They may wish to impose corporate values and standards of behavior that specifically reflect the objectives of the organization. In addition, there will also be an extant internal culture within the workforce. Work-groups within the organization have their own behavioral quirks and interactions which, to an extent, affect the whole system. Roger Harrison's four-culture typology, and adapted by Charles Handy, suggests that unlike organizational culture, corporate culture can be 'imported'. For example, computer technicians will have expertise, language and behaviors gained independently of the organization, but their presence can influence the culture of the organization as a whole.

==Legal aspects==
Corporate culture can legally be found to be a cause of injuries and a reason for fining companies in the US, e.g., when the [[US Department of Labor]] [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]] levied a fine of more than 10.8 million US dollars on Performance Coal Co. following the [[Upper Big Branch Mine disaster]] in April 2010. This was the largest fine in the history of this U.S. government agency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/msha/MSHA20111734.htm  US Labor Department's MSHA cites corporate culture as root cause of Upper Big Branch Mine disaster], MSHA News Release, [[US Department of Labor]], May 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical views==
Criticism of the usage of the term by managers began already in its emergence in the early 80s.&lt;ref name="hispanicengineer"/&gt; Most of the criticism comes from the writers in [[critical management studies]] who for example express skepticism about the [[Structural functionalism|functionalist]] and [[unitarist]] views about culture that are put forward by [[mainstream]] management writers. They stress the ways in which these cultural assumptions can stifle dissent management and reproduce propaganda and ideology. They suggest that organizations do not have a single culture and [[cultural engineering]] may not reflect the interests of all stakeholders within an organization.

Parker (2000) has suggested that many of the assumptions of those putting forward theories of organizational culture are not new. They reflect a long-standing tension between cultural and structural (or informal and formal) versions of what organizations are. Further, it is reasonable to suggest that complex organizations might have many cultures, and that such sub-cultures might overlap and contradict each other. The neat typologies of cultural forms found in textbooks rarely acknowledge such complexities, or the various economic contradictions that exist in capitalist organizations.

Among the strongest and most widely recognized writers on corporate culture, with a long list of articles on [[leadership]], [[culture]], [[gender]] and their intersection, is [[Linda Smircich]]. As a part of the [[critical management studies]], she criticizes theories that attempt to categorize or 'pigeonhole' organizational culture.&lt;ref name="Linda" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Brewis, "Othering Organization Theory: Marta Calás and Linda Smircich" ([http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-954X.2005.00542.x/abstract abstract]), The Sociological Review, ''Special Issue: Sociological Review Monograph Series: Contemporary Organization Theory'', editors Campbell Jones and Rolland Munro, Volume 53, Issue Supplement s1, pp. 80–94, October 2005&lt;/ref&gt; She uses the metaphor of a plant root to represent culture, saying that it drives organizations rather than vice versa. Organizations are the product of organizational culture; we are unaware of how it shapes behavior and interaction (also implicit in Schein's (2002) underlying assumptions{{Clarify|date=March 2012}}), and so how can we categorize it and define what it is?

== Research and models==

Several methods have been used to classify organizational culture.  While there is no single "type" of organizational culture and organizational cultures vary widely from one organization to the next, commonalities do exist and some researchers have developed models to describe different indicators of organizational cultures.  Some are described below:

=== Hofstede ===

{{main|Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory}}

[[Hofstede]] (1980) looked for differences between over 160 000 [[IBM]] employees in 50 different countries and three regions of the world, in an attempt to find aspects of culture that might influence business behavior. He suggested things about cultural differences existing in regions and nations, and the importance of international awareness and multiculturalism for their own cultural introspection. Cultural differences reflect differences in thinking and social action, and even in "mental programs", a term Hofstede uses for predictable behavior. Hofstede relates culture to ethnic and regional groups, but also organizations, professional, family, social and subcultural groups, national political systems and legislation, etc.

Hofstede suggests the need for changing "mental programs" with changing behavior first, which will lead to value change. Though certain groups like Jews and Gypsies have maintained their identity through centuries, their values show adaptation to the dominant cultural environment.

&lt;!-- This text is generally correct but may be wrong in this context. One could add Hofstede's definition of organizational culture. --&gt;Hofstede demonstrated that there are national and regional cultural groupings that affect the behavior of organizations and identified four [[Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory|dimensions of culture]] (later five&lt;ref name="Hofstede, Geert H 2001"&gt;Hofstede, Geert H. 2001. Culture's Consequences: Comparing Values, Behaviors, Institutions, and Organizations Across Nations. Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;) in his study of national cultures:

* ''Power distance'' (Mauk Mulder, 1977) – Different societies find different solutions regarding social inequality. Although invisible, inside organizations power inequality of the "boss-subordinate relationships" is functional and according to Hofstede reflects the way inequality is addressed in the society. "According to Mulder's Power Distance Reduction theory subordinates will try to reduce the power distance between themselves and their bosses and bosses will try to maintain or enlarge it", but there is also a degree to which a society expects there to be differences in the levels of power. A high score suggests that there is an expectation that some individuals wield larger amounts of power than others. A low score reflects the view that all people should have equal rights.
* ''Uncertainty avoidance'' is the way of coping with uncertainty about the [[future]]. Society copes with it with [[technology]], [[law]] and [[religion]] (though different societies have different ways of addressing it), and according to Hofstede organizations deal with it with technology, law and [[ritual]]s, or in two ways – rational and non-rational, with rituals being the non-rational. Hofstede listed some of the rituals as the memos and reports, some parts of the accounting system, a large part of the planning and control systems, and the nomination of experts.
* ''Individualism vs. collectivism'' – disharmony of interests on personal and collective goals (Parsons and Shils, 1951). Hofstede raises the idea that society's expectations of [[Individualism]]/[[Collectivism]] will be reflected by the employee inside the organization. Collectivist societies will have more emotional dependence on members in their organizations; when in equilibrium an organization is expected to show responsibility to members. Extreme individualism is seen in the [[US]]. In fact, collectivism in the US is seen as "bad". Other cultures and societies than the US will therefore seek to resolve social and organizational problems in ways different from American ways. Hofstede says that a capitalist market economy fosters individualism and [[competition]], and depends on it, but individualism is also related to the development of the [[middle class]]. &lt;small&gt;Some people and cultures might have both high individualism and high collectivism. For example, someone who highly values duty to his or her group does not necessarily give a low priority to personal freedom and self-sufficiency.&lt;/small&gt;
* ''[[Masculinity]] vs. [[femininity]]'' –  reflects whether a certain society is predominantly male or female in terms of cultural values, [[gender role]]s and power relations.
* Long- Versus Short-Term Orientation&lt;ref name="Hofstede, Geert H 2001"/&gt; which he describes as "The long-term orientation dimension can be interpreted as dealing with society's search for virtue. Societies with a short-term orientation generally have a strong concern with establishing the absolute Truth. They are normative in their thinking. They exhibit great respect for traditions, a relatively small propensity to save for the future, and a focus on achieving quick results. In societies with a long-term orientation, people believe that truth depends very much on situation, context and time. They show an ability to adapt traditions to changed conditions, a strong propensity to save and invest, thriftiness, and perseverance in achieving results."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geert-hofstede.com/dimensions.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831002012/http://geert-hofstede.com/dimensions.html |archivedate=2013-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These dimensions refer to the effect of national cultures on management, and can be used to adapt policies to local needs.
In a follow up study, another model&lt;ref name="Hofstede, Geert H 2001"/&gt; is suggested for organizational culture.

=== O'Reilly, Chatman, and Caldwell ===

Two common models and their associated measurement tools have been developed by O'Reilly ''et al.'' and [[Daniel R. Denison|Denison]].

O'Reilly, [[Jennifer Chatman|Chatman]] &amp; Caldwell (1991) developed a model based on the belief that cultures can be distinguished by values that are reinforced within organizations.  Their Organizational Cultural Profile (OCP) is a self reporting tool which makes distinctions according eight categories – Innovation, Supportiveness, Stability, Respect for People, Outcome Orientation, Attention to Detail, Team Orientation, and Aggressiveness.  The model is also suited to measure how organizational culture affects organizational performance, as it measures most efficient persons suited to an organization{{Clarify|date=February 2014}} and as such organizations can be termed as having good organizational culture.
Employee values are measured against organizational values to predict employee intentions to stay, and [[Turnover (employment)|turnover]].&lt;ref name="becky"&gt;Becky H. Takeda, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=RojvMmfcZfAC&amp;pg=PA2 Investigation of employee tenure as related to relationships of personality and personal values of entrepreneurs and their perceptions of their employees]'', ProQuest, 2007, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; This is done through an instrument like Organizational Culture Profile (OCP) to measure employee commitment.&lt;ref name="becky"/&gt;

=== Daniel Denison ===

Daniel Denison's model (1990) asserts that organizational culture can be described by four general dimensions – Mission, Adaptability, Involvement and Consistency.  Each of these general dimensions is further described by the following three sub-dimensions:

* Mission – Strategic Direction and Intent, Goals and Objectives and Vision
* Adaptability – Creating Change, Customer Focus and Organizational Learning
* Involvement – Empowerment, Team Orientation and Capability Development
* Consistency – Core Values, Agreement, Coordination/Integration

Denison's model also allows cultures to be described broadly as externally or internally focused as well as flexible versus stable.  The model has been typically used to diagnose cultural problems in organizations.

=== Deal and Kennedy ===

Deal and Kennedy (1982)&lt;ref name=dealkennedy/&gt; defined organizational culture as ''the way things get done around here''.

Deal and Kennedy created a model of culture that is based on 4 different types of organizations. They each focus on how quickly the organization receives feedback, the way members are rewarded, and the level of risks taken:&lt;ref name="changingminds.org"&gt;[http://changingminds.org/explanations/culture/deal_kennedy_culture.htm Deal and Kennedy's cultural model], ChangingMinds.org&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Work-hard, play-hard culture''': This has rapid feedback/reward and low risk resulting in: Stress coming from quantity of work rather than uncertainty. High-speed action leading to high-speed recreation. Examples: Restaurants, software companies.&lt;ref name="changingminds.org"/&gt;
# '''Tough-guy macho culture''': This has rapid feedback/reward and high risk, resulting in the following: Stress coming from high risk and potential loss/gain of reward. Focus on the present rather than the longer-term future. Examples: police, surgeons, sports.&lt;ref name="changingminds.org"/&gt;
# '''Process culture''': This has slow feedback/reward and low risk, resulting in the following: Low stress, plodding work, comfort and security. Stress that comes from internal politics and stupidity of the system. Development of bureaucracies and other ways of maintaining the status quo. Focus on security of the past and of the future. Examples: banks, insurance companies.&lt;ref name=dealkennedy/&gt;&lt;ref name="changingminds.org"/&gt;
# '''Bet-the-company culture''': This has slow feedback/reward and high risk, resulting in the following: Stress coming from high risk and delay before knowing if actions have paid off. The long view is taken, but then much work is put into making sure things happen as planned. Examples: aircraft manufacturers, oil companies.

=== Edgar Schein ===

According to [[Edgar Schein|Schein]] (1992),&lt;ref name=schein2009/&gt; culture is the most difficult organizational attribute to change, outlasting organizational products, services, founders and leadership and all other physical attributes of the organization.  His organizational model illuminates culture from the standpoint of the [[observation|observer]], described at three levels: ''artifacts'', ''espoused values'' and ''basic underlying assumptions''.

At the first and most cursory level of Schein's model is organizational attributes that can be seen, felt and heard by the uninitiated observer – collectively known as ''artifacts''. Included are the facilities, offices, furnishings, visible awards and recognition, the way that its members dress, how each person visibly interacts with each other and with organizational outsiders, and even company [[slogan]]s, [[mission statement]]s and other operational [[creed]]s.

Artifacts comprise the physical components of the organization that relay cultural meaning. [[Daniel R. Denison|Daniel Denison]] (1990) describes artifacts as the tangible aspects of culture shared by members of an organization. Verbal, behavioral and physical artifacts are the surface manifestations of organizational culture.

Rituals, the collective interpersonal behavior and values as demonstrated by that behavior, constitute the fabric of an organization's culture.  The contents of myths, stories, and sagas reveal the history of an organization and influence how people understand what their organization values and believes.  Language, stories, and myths are examples of verbal artifacts and are represented in rituals and ceremonies. Technology and art exhibited by members of an organization are examples of physical artifacts.

The next level deals with the professed culture of an organization's members – the ''values''. Shared values are individuals' preferences regarding certain aspects of the organization's culture (e.g.  loyalty, customer service). At this level, local and personal values are widely expressed within the organization. Basic beliefs and assumptions include individuals' impressions about the trustworthiness and supportiveness of an organization, and are often deeply ingrained within the organization's culture. Organizational behavior at this level usually can be studied by interviewing the organization's membership and using questionnaires to gather attitudes about organizational membership.

At the third and deepest level, the organization's [[tacit assumption]]s are found.  These are the elements of culture that are unseen and not cognitively identified in everyday interactions between organizational members. Additionally, these are the elements of culture which are often taboo to discuss inside the organization.  Many of these '[[unspoken rules]]' exist without the conscious knowledge of the membership.  Those with sufficient experience to understand this deepest level of organizational culture usually become acclimatized to its attributes over time, thus reinforcing the invisibility of their existence. Surveys and casual interviews with organizational members cannot draw out these attributes—rather much more in-depth means is required to first identify then understand organizational culture at this level.  Notably, culture at this level is the underlying and driving element often missed by organizational behaviorists.

Using Schein's model, understanding paradoxical organizational behaviors becomes more apparent.  For instance, an organization can profess highly aesthetic and moral standards at the second level of Schein's model while simultaneously displaying curiously opposing behavior at the third and deepest level of culture.  Superficially, organizational rewards can imply one organizational norm but at the deepest level imply something completely different.  This insight offers an understanding of the difficulty that organizational newcomers have in assimilating organizational culture and why it takes time to become acclimatized. It also explains why organizational change agents usually fail to achieve their goals: underlying tacit cultural norms are generally not understood before would-be change agents begin their actions. Merely understanding culture at the deepest level may be insufficient to institute cultural change because the dynamics of interpersonal relationships (often under threatening conditions) are added to the dynamics of organizational culture while attempts are made to institute desired change.

According to Schein (1992),&lt;ref name="schein2009" /&gt; the two main reasons why cultures develop in organizations is due to external adaptation and internal integration.  External adaptation reflects an evolutionary approach to organizational culture and suggests that cultures develop and persist because they help an organization to survive and flourish.  If the culture is valuable, then it holds the potential for generating sustained competitive advantages.  Additionally, internal integration is an important function since social structures are required for organizations to exist.  Organizational practices are learned through socialization at the workplace.  Work environments reinforce culture on a daily basis by encouraging employees to exercise cultural values.
Organizational culture is shaped by multiple factors, including the following:
* External environment
* Industry
* Size and nature of the organization's workforce
* Technologies the organization uses
* The organization's history and ownership

=== Gerry Johnson ===

Gerry Johnson (1988) described a cultural web, identifying a number of elements that can be used to describe or influence organizational culture:

* '''The paradigm''': What the organization is about, what it does, its mission, its values.
* '''Control systems''': The processes in place to monitor what is going on. Role cultures would have vast rule-books. There would be more reliance on individualism in a power culture.
* '''Organizational structures''': Reporting lines, hierarchies, and the way that work flows through the business.
* '''Power structures''': Who makes the decisions, how widely spread is power, and on what is power based?
* '''Symbols''': These include organizational logos and designs, but also extend to symbols of power such as parking spaces and executive washrooms.
* '''Rituals and routines''': Management meetings, board reports and so on may become more habitual than necessary.
* '''Stories and myths''': build up about people and events, and convey a message about what is valued within the organization.

These elements may overlap.  Power structures may depend on control systems, which may exploit the very rituals that generate stories which may not be true.

=== Stanley G. Harris ===

''Schemata'' (plural of schema) are knowledge structures a person forms from past experiences, allowing the person to respond to similar events more efficiently in the future by guiding the processing of information.  A person's schemata are created through interaction with others, and thus inherently involve communication.

Stanley G. Harris (1994) argues that five categories of in-organization schemata are necessary for organizational culture:

# '''Self-in-organization schemata''': a person's concept of oneself within the context of the organization, including her/his personality, roles, and behavior.
# '''Person-in-organization schemata''': a person's memories, impressions, and expectations of other individuals within the organization.
# '''Organization schemata''': a subset of person schemata, a person's generalized perspective on others as a whole in the organization.
# '''Object/concept-in-organization schemata''': knowledge an individual has of organization aspects other than of other persons.
# '''Event-in-organization schemata''': a person's knowledge of social events within an organization.

All of these categories together represent a person's knowledge of an organization.
Organizational culture is created when the schematas (schematic structures) of differing individuals across and within an organization come to resemble each other (when any one person's schemata come to resemble another person's schemata because of mutual organizational involvement), primarily done through organizational communication, as individuals directly or indirectly share knowledge and meanings.

=== Charles Handy ===

[[Charles Handy]] (1976),  popularized Roger Harrison (1972) with linking [[organizational structure]] to organizational culture. The described four types of culture are:&lt;ref&gt;Enrique Ruiz, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=VZ_uPnC6kTIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Discriminate Or Diversify]'', PositivePsyche.Biz Corp, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Power culture''': concentrates [[power (social and political)|power]] among a small group or a central figure and its control is radiating from its center like a web. Power cultures need only a few rules and little [[bureaucracy]] but swift in decisions can ensue.
# '''Role culture''': authorities are delegated as such within a highly defined structure. These organizations form hierarchical bureaucracies, where power derives from the personal position and rarely from an expert power. Control is made by procedures (which are highly valued), strict roles descriptions and authority definitions. These organizations have consistent systems and are very predictable. This culture is often represented by a "Roman Building" having pillars. These pillars represent the functional departments.
# '''Task culture''': teams are formed to solve particular problems. Power is derived from the team with the expertise to execute against a task. This culture uses a small team approach, where people are highly skilled and specialized in their own area of expertise. Additionally, these cultures often feature the multiple reporting lines seen in a [[matrix management|matrix structure]].
# '''Person culture''': formed where all individuals believe themselves superior to the organization. It can become difficult for such organizations to continue to operate, since the concept of an organization suggests that a group of like-minded individuals pursue organizational goals. However some professional partnerships operate well as person cultures, because each partner brings a particular expertise and clientele to the firm.

=== Kim Cameron and Robert Quinn ===

{{see also|Archetype}}

[[Kim S. Cameron|Kim Cameron]] and Robert Quinn (1999) conducted research on organizational effectiveness and success. Based on the Competing Values Framework, they developed the Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument that distinguishes four culture types.

Competing values produce polarities like flexibility vs. stability and internal vs. external focus – these two polarities were found to be most important in defining organizational success. The polarities construct a quadrant with four types of culture:

* [[Clan]] culture (internal focus and flexible) – A friendly workplace where leaders act like father figures.
* [[Adhocracy]] culture (external focus and flexible) – A dynamic workplace with leaders that stimulate innovation.
* Market culture (external focus and controlled) – A competitive workplace with leaders like hard drivers
* [[Hierarchical organization|Hierarchy]] culture (internal focus and controlled) – A structured and formalized workplace where leaders act like coordinators.

Cameron and Quinn designated six characteristics of organizational culture that can be assessed with the Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument (OCAI).

Clan cultures are most strongly associated with positive employee [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s and product and [[service quality]].&lt;ref&gt;Beyer, D.L., &amp; Haug, R. (nd).VOrganizational Culture: Diagnosing a Customer Contact Company. Retrieved Dec. 14, 2014.[http://inspirexcellence.com/Articles/OrganizationalCulture_Beyer&amp;Associates.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Market cultures are most strongly related with [[innovation]] and financial effectiveness criteria. The primary belief in market cultures that clear goals and contingent rewards motivate employees to aggressively perform and meet stakeholders' expectations; a core belief in clan cultures is that the organization's trust in and commitment to employees facilitates open communication and employee involvement. These differing results suggest that it is important for executive leaders to consider the match between strategic initiatives and organizational culture when determining how to embed a culture that produces competitive advantage. By assessing the current organizational culture as well as the preferred situation, the gap and direction to change can be made visible as a first step to changing organizational culture.

=== Robert A. Cooke ===

Robert A. Cooke defines culture as the behaviors that members believe are required to fit in and meet expectations within their organization. The Organizational Culture Inventory measures twelve behavioral norms that are grouped into three general types of cultures:

* Constructive cultures, in which members are encouraged to interact with people and approach tasks in ways that help them meet their higher-order satisfaction needs.
* Passive/defensive cultures, in which members believe they must interact with people in ways that will not threaten their own security.
* Aggressive/defensive cultures, in which members are expected to approach tasks in forceful ways to protect their status and security.

==== Constructive cultures ====

In constructive cultures, people are encouraged to be in communication with their co-workers, and work as teams, rather than only as individuals. In positions where people do a complex job, rather than something simple like a mechanical task, this culture is efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooke|first=R. A.|title=The Organizational Culture Inventory|year=1987|publisher=Human Synergistics, Inc.|location=Plymouth, MI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Achievement''': completing a task successfully, typically by effort, courage, or skill (pursue a standard of excellence) (explore alternatives before acting) – Based on the need to attain high-quality results on challenging projects, the belief that outcomes are linked to one's effort rather than chance and the tendency to personally set challenging yet realistic goals. People high in this style think ahead and plan, explore alternatives before acting and learn from their mistakes.
# '''Self-actualizing''': realization or fulfillment of one's talents and potentialities – considered as a drive or need present in everyone (think in unique and independent ways) (do even simple tasks well) – Based on needs for personal growth, self-fulfillment and the realization of one's potential. People with this style demonstrate a strong desire to learn and experience things, creative yet realistic thinking and a balanced concern for people and tasks.
# '''Humanistic-encouraging''': help others to grow and develop (resolve conflicts constructively) – Reflects an interest in the growth and development of people, a high positive regard for them and sensitivity to their needs. People high in this style devote energy to coaching and counselling others, are thoughtful and considerate and provide people with support and encouragement.
# '''Affiliative''': treat people as more valuable than things (cooperate with others) – Reflects an interest in developing and sustaining pleasant relationships. People high in this style share their thoughts and feelings, are friendly and cooperative and make others feel a part of things.

Organizations with constructive cultures encourage members to work to their full potential, resulting in high levels of motivation, satisfaction, teamwork, service quality, and sales growth. Constructive norms are evident in environments where quality is valued over quantity, creativity is valued over conformity, cooperation is believed to lead to better results than competition, and effectiveness is judged at the system level rather than the component level. These types of cultural norms are consistent with (and supportive of) the objectives behind empowerment, [[total quality management]], transformational leadership, continuous improvement, re-engineering, and learning organizations.&lt;ref name=kotter1992/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using the Organizational Culture Inventory (OCI) to Measure Kotter and Heskett's Adaptive and Unadaptive Cultures|url=http://www.trainersdirect.com/resources/articles/changemanagement/orgcultureinventory.htm|publisher=Human Synergistics|accessdate=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constructive Styles|url=http://www.human-synergistics.com.au/content/products/circumplex/constructive.asp|publisher=Human-Synergistics|accessdate=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Passive/defensive cultures ====

Norms that reflect expectations for members to interact with people in ways that will not threaten their own security are in the Passive/Defensive Cluster.

The four Passive/Defensive cultural norms are:

* Approval
* Conventional
* Dependent
* Avoidance

In organizations with Passive/Defensive cultures, members feel pressured to think and behave in ways that are inconsistent with the way they believe they should in order to be effective. People are expected to please others (particularly superiors) and avoid interpersonal conflict. Rules, procedures, and orders are more important than personal beliefs, ideas, and judgment. Passive/Defensive cultures experience a lot of unresolved conflict and turnover, and organizational members report lower levels of motivation and satisfaction.

==== Aggressive/defensive cultures ====

This style is characterized with more emphasis on task than people. Because of the very nature of this style, people tend to focus on their own individual needs at the expense of the success of the group. The aggressive/defensive style is very stressful, and people using this style tend to make decisions based on status as opposed to expertise.&lt;ref name="Aggressive/Defensive Styles"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aggressive/Defensive Styles|url=http://www.human-synergistics.com.au/content/products/circumplex/aggressive.asp|accessdate=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Oppositional''' – This cultural norm is based on the idea that a need for security that takes the form of being very critical and cynical at times.  People who use this style are more likely to question others work; however, asking those tough question often leads to a better product. Nonetheless, those who use this style may be overly-critical toward others, using irrelevant or trivial flaws to put others down.
# '''[[Power (social and political)|Power]]''' – This cultural norm is based on the idea that there is a need for prestige and influence. Those who use this style often equate their own [[self-worth]] with controlling others. Those who use this style have a tendency to dictate others opposing to guiding others' actions.
# '''Competitive''' – This cultural norm is based on the idea of a need to protect one's status. Those who use this style protect their own status by comparing themselves to other individuals and outperforming them.  Those who use this style are seekers of appraisal and recognition from others.
# '''[[Perfectionism (psychology)|Perfectionistic]]''' – This cultural norm is based on the need to attain flawless results. Those who often use this style equate their self-worth with the attainment of extremely high standards. Those who often use this style are always focused on details and place excessive demands on themselves and others.

Organizations with aggressive/defensive cultures encourage or require members to appear competent, controlled, and superior. Members who seek assistance, admit shortcomings, or concede their position are viewed as incompetent or weak. These organizations emphasize finding errors, weeding out "mistakes" and encouraging members to compete against each other rather than competitors. The short-term gains associated with these strategies are often at the expense of long-term growth.&lt;ref name="Aggressive/Defensive Styles"/&gt;

=== Adam Grant ===

[[Adam Grant]], author of the book ''Give and Take'', distinguishes organizational cultures into ''giver'', ''taker'' and ''matcher'' cultures according to their [[norm of reciprocity|norms of reciprocity]]. In a giver culture, employees operate by "helping others, sharing knowledge, offering mentoring, and making connections without expecting anything in return", whereas in a taker culture "the norm is to get as much as possible from others while contributing less in return" and winners are those who take the most and are able to build their power at the expense of others. The majority of organizations are mid-way, with a ''matcher culture'', in which the norm is to match giving with taking, and favours are mostly traded in closed loops.&lt;ref name="grant-2013"&gt;{{cite web|author=Adam Grant|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/organization/givers_take_all_the_hidden_dimension_of_corporate_culture|title=Givers take all: The hidden dimension of corporate culture|publisher=McKinsey|date=April 2013|accessdate=2016-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study by Harvard researchers on units of the US intelligence system, a giver culture turned out to be the strongest predictor of group effectiveness.&lt;ref name="grant-2013"/&gt;

As Grant points out, [[Robert H. Frank]] argues that "many organizations are essentially [[winner-take-all market]]s, dominated by zero-sum competitions for rewards and promotions". In particular, when leaders implement [[forced ranking]] systems to reward individual performance, the organisational culture tends to change, with a giver culture giving way to a taker or matcher culture. Also awarding the highest-performing individual within each team encourages a taker culture.&lt;ref name="grant-2013"/&gt;

=== Stephen McGuire ===

Stephen McGuire (2003) defined and validated a model of organizational culture that predicts revenue from new sources.  An Entrepreneurial Organizational Culture (EOC) is a system of shared values, beliefs and norms of members of an organization, including valuing creativity and tolerance of creative people, believing that innovating and seizing market opportunities are appropriate behaviors to deal with problems of survival and prosperity, environmental uncertainty, and competitors' threats, and expecting organizational members to behave accordingly.

==== Elements ====

* People and empowerment focused
* Value creation through innovation and change
* Attention to the basics
* Hands-on management
* Doing the right thing
* Freedom to grow and to fail
* Commitment and personal responsibility
* Emphasis on the future&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csus.edu/indiv/h/hattonl/|title=LIndle Hatton Faculty Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eric Flamholtz===
Eric Flamholtz (2001; 2011) has identified and validated a model of organizational culture components that drive financial results (Flamholtz and Randle, 2011). The model consist of five identified dimensions of  corporate culture: 1) treatment of customers, 2) treatment of people, 3) performance standards and accountability, 4) innovation and change, and 5) process orientation. These five dimensions have been confirmed by factor analysis (Flamholtz and Narasimhan-Kannan, 2005) in addition, Flamholtz has published empirical research that show the impact of organizational culture on financial performance (Flamholtz, 2001). Flamholtz has also proposed  that organizational (corporate) culture is not just an asset in the economic sense; but is also an "asset" in the conventional accounting sense (Flamholtz 2005). Flamholtz and Randle have also examined the evolution of organizational culture at different stages of organizational growth (Flamholtz and 
Randle, 2014).

== Ethical frameworks and evaluations of corporate culture ==
Four organizational cultures can be classified as apathetic, caring, exacting, and integrative.

* An apathetic culture shows minimal concern for either people or performance. &amp;nbsp;
* A caring culture exhibits high concern for people but minimal concern for performance issues.
* An exacting culture shows little concern for people but a high concern for performance.
* An integrative culture combines a high concern for people and performance.

A cultural audit is an assessment of an organization's values. &lt;!--TO BE EDITED 2/11/17--&gt;

'''The Public Schools Accountability Act''' ('''PSAA''') was passed in California in 1999 as the first step in developing a comprehensive system to hold students, schools, and districts accountable for improving student performance. The system establishes a code of conduct for all teachers stating that their overall objective for the student is to achieve and progress academically.  The PSAA was passed to make sure that student excel in school, and are able to perform with the best of their abilities.  It is to make sure that teachers and school staff encourage students and instruct them in different ways.  In the PSAA, it covers three main components that ensure students growth; the Academic Performance Index (API), the Immediate Intervention/ Underperforming Schools Program (II/USP), and the Governor’s Performance Award (GPA) program.  Each of these components is used to develop and emerge a students education, and even make the PSAA work smoothly and correctly.

The Academic Performance Index (API), is used to measure the progress within the school. The program now includes a [[Standardized Testing and Reporting]] (STAR) system, testing at the elementary levels, known as the California Achievement Test (CAT), and a high school exit exam ([[California High School Exit Exam|CAHSEE]]), both aligned with academic content standards.  The API

These comprehensive accountability standards put [[California]] in a good position to meet the provisions of the 2001 federal law known as [[No Child Left Behind]] (NCLB) and are the components the state uses for measuring [[Adequate Yearly Progress]] (AYP).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2354">The '''Quincy Method''', also known as the '''Quincy Plan''', or the Quincy system of learning, was a child-centred, [[Progressive education|progressive]] approach to education developed by [[Francis W. Parker]], then [[Superintendent (education)|superintendent]] of schools in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]] in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;Quincy Plan. (2008). In ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved November 20, 2008, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online: [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/487388/Quincy-Plan]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Parker, a pioneer of the [[Educational progressivism|progressive school movement]], rejected the traditional rigid school routine, exemplified by [[rote learning]] and the spelling-book method, and even stated that the spelling book should be burned,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1880/11/13/archives/quincy-ways-of-teaching-col-parker-explains-them-at-flushing.html ''The New York Times'' November 13, 1880. Retrieved November 20, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; although he did favour oral spelling. Emphasis was instead placed on social skills and self-expression through cultural activities and physical training, as well as teacher-prepared materials, experience-based learning and children’s own writing. 

A survey by the [[Massachusetts State Board of Education]] published four years later showed that Quincy students excelled at reading, writing, and spelling, and ranked fourth in their county in math.&lt;ref&gt;Koegel, R. "Partnership Education and

==Pageant career==
===Early pageants===
Latuff's first pageant experience was an unsuccessful bid to become Miss Bayfront in [[Duluth, Minnesota]].&lt;ref name="msdn150710"/&gt; On July 21, 2012, Latuff won the Miss Midwest 2012 title.&lt;ref name="hasg120802"/&gt; She competed in the 2013 [[Miss Minnesota]] pageant with the platform "Teach For America: Creating a Better Tomorrow for Youth Education" and a ribbon dance performance in the talent portion of the competition.&lt;ref name="msam2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hasg130627"/&gt; She was not a finalist for the state title.&lt;ref name="hasg130627"/&gt;

As a runner-up for Miss Minnesota, Latuff was chosen to represent Minnesota at the 2014 [[National Sweetheart]] pageant in [[Hoopeston, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="nswe14co"/&gt; She tied for the John Bitner Judge's Award but was not a finalist for this national crown.&lt;ref name="nswe14wi"/&gt;

===Miss Minnesota 2015===
On January 17, 2015, Latuff was crowned Miss Olmsted County 2015 and qualified for a third try at the state title.&lt;ref name="kaal150117"/&gt;&lt;ref name="msmnoc15"/&gt; She entered the [[Miss Minnesota]] pageant at [[Eden Prairie High School]] in June 2015 as one of 27 local pageant qualifiers.&lt;ref name="hasg150617"/&gt;&lt;ref name="msmn15wi"/&gt; Latuff's competition talent was a contemporary ribbon dance.&lt;ref name="hasg150617"/&gt; &lt;!-- to the song "[[Out of the Woods (song)|Out of the Woods]]".--&gt; Her platform is "Teaching the Heart: Building the Social and Emotional Wellness of Youth and their Teachers".&lt;ref name="hasg150617"/&gt;

===Vying for Miss America 2016===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16479">The '''Robert C. Vance Distinguished Lecture Series''' was a series of 23 lectures&lt;ref&gt;"Rudolph Giuliani Delivers Vance Lecutre" (2013, May). [http://www.ccsu.edu/uploaded/Courier/Courier_05-13.pdf   ''Central Courier, 38''](4), p. 2. Retrieved on 2013-5-29.&lt;/ref&gt;between 1983 and 2013 at [[Central Connecticut State University]]. Most of the speakers were either well-known journalists such as [[Anderson Cooper]], [[Dan Rather]], and [[Bob Woodward]]), or government figures, including [[Robert Gates]], [[Rudolph Giuliani]], and [[Shimon Peres]]. Three former [[U.S. Presidents]] have also been among the lecturers in the series.

The lecture series was named in honor of [[Robert C. Vance]], publisher of the ''[[New Britain Herald]]'' from 1951 to 1959.

The original aim of the series was to bring to CCSU speakers from the field of journalism.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;Traynor, Melissa. (2010, March 29).[http://centralrecorder.com/2010/03/29/steve-forbes-to-be-2010-vance-distinguished-lecturer/ Steve Forbes Will Be 2010 Vance Distinguished Lecturer]. ''The Recorder''. Retrieved on 2013-5-29.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Newscaster]] [[David Brinkley]] was scheduled to give the first Vance lecture in 1983, but was replaced only days before the lecture by Benjamin Bradlee.&lt;ref&gt;"Brinkley will be filling in this week for ABC anchormen Frank Reynolds and Ted Koppel, who are ill, a CCSU spokeswoman said..." (Bradlee Replaces Brinkley. (1983, May 3). ''Hartford Courant'', p. B4B.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="30-years"&gt;{{cite web |title=Vance series adds to its tradition of distinguished guest speakers |last=James |first=Alayna |url=http://www.centralctcommunications.com/newbritainherald/news/article_8fbf7313-ba26-5eed-ae8b-f0b16f51dbf8.html |newspaper=New Britain Herald |date=17 February 2013 |access-date=10 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322101910/http://www.centralctcommunications.com/newbritainherald/news/article_8fbf7313-ba26-5eed-ae8b-f0b16f51dbf8.html |archivedate=22 March 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The twelve lecturers following Bradlee were well-known political figures, but since 2001, journalists have also been featured.

All costs for the series were covered by the Robert C. Vance Charitable Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;Board of Trustees for the Connecticut State University System (2000, November 2). [http://www.ct.edu/files/csus-resolutions/00-089.pdf Resolution naming the new classroom and office building at Central Connecticut State University in honor of Robert C. Vance]. Board Resolution BR#2000-89. Retrieved 2013-5-29.&lt;/ref&gt; a private foundation founded in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://nccsdataweb.urban.org/orgs/profile/066050188 Overview] at the [http://nccsdataweb.urban.org National Center for Charitable Statistics]&lt;/ref&gt; Lectures were free to the public, although in later years a paid reception and dinner with the lecturer was usually held before the lecture.

==Discontinuation==
After the Rudolph Giuliani lecture in March 2013, the university's Faculty Senate, having  “expressed its dissatisfaction with the lack of progressive speakers over the past few years,” created an ''ad hoc'' committee to recommend future speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Otlowski , Acadia. (2013, September 25).[http://centralrecorder.com/2013/09/25/faculty-senate-elects-new-president/ Faculty Senate Elects New President]. ''The Recorder''. Retrieved on 2016-2-3.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the university and the Vance Foundation could not reach consensus on a speaker for 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Otlowski , Acadia. (2014, February 12).[http://centralrecorder.com/2014/02/12/faculty-senate-15/ Faculty Senate]. ''The Recorder''. Retrieved on 2016-2-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ad hoc'' committee submitted a list of potential speakers the following term,&lt;ref&gt;Bruno, Ruth. (2015, January 4). [http://centralrecorder.com/2015/01/04/faculty-senate-bullet-points-2/ Faculty Senate Bullet Points]. ''The Recorder''. Retrieved on 2016-2-3.&lt;/ref&gt; but again, no consensus was reached.

The university issued a news release&lt;ref&gt;“Vance Lecture Series Concludes: Funding redirected to student educational, social programs.” News Release, [[Central Connecticut State University]] [This press release was distributed via e-mail but does not appear on CCSU's web site.]&lt;/ref&gt; dated December 9, 2015, stating that “The Robert C. Vance Lecture Series will be discontinued.” Although no reason was given for ending the series, it was noted that funding for the series had not been discontinued, and that these monies “will be redirected to the [Vance] Endowed Chair [in Journalism and Mass Communication] in support of critical initiatives that will have a more direct impact on CCSU students, faculty members, as well as the larger [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]] community.”

==List of Vance Lecturers==
The following twenty-four speakers gave lectures in this series. There were twenty-three events, as [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]] and [[George McGovern]] appeared together in 1990. Former [[President of Ireland]] [[Mary Robinson]] is among the speakers the Vance Foundation has been unsuccessful in booking.&lt;ref name="de-Klerk"&gt;Carlson, Meredith.

===Notes===

:&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt; speaker received an [[List of recipients of honorary degrees from Central Connecticut State University|Honorary degree from CCSU]] on the date of his or her lecture.

==Controversies==
The Vance Lecture Series has been accused of conservative bias by members of the CCSU community.&lt;ref&gt;Otlowski, Acadia (2013, March 13). [http://centralrecorder.com/2013/03/13/faculty-senate-stands-in-solidarity-with-student-protests/ Faculty Senate Stands in Solidarity With Student Protests]. ''The Recorder''. Retrieved on 2013-6-29.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Eighteen of the 24 speakers have been government officials or political figures. Of the U.S. officials, three have been Democrats (Carter, McGovern, and Mitchell)  and nine have been Republicans (Kissinger, Buckley,&lt;ref&gt;William F. Buckley, Jr.: Author, Editor, Lecturer, Host of "Firing Line." (n.d.). [http://cache.boston.com/helpwanted/resume/buckley.htm Boston.com].&lt;/ref&gt; Ford, Kirkpatrick, Bush, Dole, Forbes, Gates, and Giuliani). The six foreign heads of government were evenly split on ideology (Wilson, Schmidt, and Peres represented [[Centre-left|left-center]] parties, while Mulroney, Wałęsa, and de Klerk were members of [[Centre-right|right-center]] parties).
*Five of the speakers represented the news media, which is routinely accused of [[Media bias in the United States|liberal bias]]. Hugh [[Hugh Downs#Public service and political views|Downs is generally viewed as a libertarian]], while Woodward's ideology has been debated.&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, Charles P. (2013, February 25).

Retrieved 29 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Botwinick, Nathaniel &amp; Andrew Johnson (2013, February 28).

Retrieved 29 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on reputation, Bradlee, Cooper, and Rather are liberals.
*In his ''Vero Beach Newsweekly'' articles, the remaining speaker, former Baseball commissioner Fay Vincent, occasionally offers moderately conservative views&lt;ref&gt;Vincent, Fay (2012, September 4). [http://www.verobeachnewsweekly.com/news/2012/sep/14/fay-vincent-getting-old-you-have-no-agenda-and-a/ Getting old, you have 'no agenda and are not trying to impress anyone]. Vero Beach Newsweekly. Retrieved 29 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Vincent, Fay (2010, November 16). [http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2010/nov/16/fay-vincent-pelosi-just-hanging-on-like-willie/ Pelosi just hanging on, like Willie with the Mets]. Vero Beach Newsweekly. Retrieved 29 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; but is generally nonpolitical.
In particular, the lectures of Kissinger, de Klerk,&lt;ref name="de-Klerk" /&gt; and Gates&lt;ref name="Giuliani" /&gt; were met with protests.

'''Teachinghistory.org''', also known as the '''National History Education Clearinghouse''' (NHEC), is a website that provides educational resources for the study of U.S. history.

== Organizational background ==
In the past decade and a half, three major developments have reshaped the landscape for [[K-12]] history education and have created the conditions for significant advances in history teaching and learning. First, the emergence of the Internet and the [[World Wide Web]] has brought unprecedented resources and possibilities to the computers of the nation's history teachers. Second, a body of serious scholarly research in history education – and the [[learning sciences]] more generally – has begun to illuminate how students actually learn history. Finally, the Department of Education's Teaching American History (TAH) program has invested more than $900 million in history education – the largest federal infusion of resources ever devoted to improving the teaching and learning of history.&lt;ref&gt;Melendez, Margarita L. [http://www2.ed.gov/programs/teachinghistory/shfg-article.pdf ''Teaching American History Article'']. The Society for History in the Federal Government newsletter, ''The Federalist,'' Fall 2008, Number 19, accessed May 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to these advancements, the [[United States Department of Education]] announced a call for proposals in 2007 to address the building, populating, and maintaining of a central website for K-12 American history educators, funded under the Teaching American History Grant program (TAH). [[George Mason University's Center for History and New Media]] was awarded the grant for the website creation the same year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historynewsnetwork.com/node/43381 "George Mason University Receives $7.5 Million to Create a National History Education Clearinghouse"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419013639/http://www.historynewsnetwork.com/node/43381 |date=2012-04-19 }}, ''[[History News Network]]'', October 3, 2007, accessed May 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Walt. [http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/walt_gardners_reality_check/2011/06/ignorance_of_history_pervades_all_levels.html "Ignorance of History Permeates All Levels"], ''[[Education Week]]'', June 22, 2011, accessed August 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The TAH program is funded under Title II-C, Subpart 4 of the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965]], as amended by the [[No Child Left Behind Act of 2001]]. According to the TAH program website, the goal of the program is to "raise student achievement by improving teachers’ knowledge, understanding, and appreciation of American history.&lt;ref&gt;United States Department of Education, [http://www2.ed.gov/programs/teachinghistory/ ''Teaching American History''], accessed May 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;"

== Organizational goals ==
One goal is to bring together K-12 American history resources to help educators find and use them. Another goal is to create materials that detail strategies for teaching and learning history to help educators improve classroom teaching. A third goal is to disseminate lessons learned by more than 900 Teaching American History (TAH) grants designed to raise student achievement by improving teachers' knowledge and understanding of traditional U.S. history.

Teachinghistory.org is updated regularly and is organized around six sections: History Content, Best Practices, Teaching Materials, Issues and Research, Teaching American History (TAH) Projects, and Digital Classroom. In addition, the website offers a weekly history quiz, a blog, and features that allow users to submit history content, history teaching, and digital history questions to experts in the field.

== Partners ==
With funding from the [[U.S. Department of Education]] under the Office of Innovation and Improvement, Teachinghistory.org, also known as the National History Education Clearinghouse, was developed through a collaboration between the Roy Rosenzweig [[Center for History and New Media]] (CHNM) at [[George Mason University]] and the Stanford History Education Group at [[Stanford University]].

CHNM and the Stanford History Education Group have worked on other projects together, including Historical Thinking Matters, a website focused on key topics in U.S. history that is designed to teach students how to critically read primary sources and how to critique and construct historical narratives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historicalthinkingmatters.org/about/ ''Historical Thinking Matters''], accessed May 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded by [[Roy Rosenzweig]], CHNM is an internationally recognized digital humanities center located in Fairfax, Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hastac.org/centers-and-institutions/center-history-and-new-media ''Center for History and New Media''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721185337/http://www.hastac.org/centers-and-institutions/center-history-and-new-media |date=2011-07-21 }}. HASTAC, accessed May 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Created by Sam Wineburg, the Stanford History Education Group in Stanford, California, engages in projects at the forefront of how students learn history, from elementary school to college.

Additional Teachinghistory.org partners include the [[American Historical Association]], a professional organization for historians founded in 1884, and the National History Center, which promotes research, teaching, and learning in all fields of history.

== Resources ==
* The '''Blog''' features posts on teaching strategies, classroom experience, holidays and heritage months, and other topical issues. Authors include both Teachinghistory.org staff and guests.
* '''History Content''' presents access to online resources including reviewed history websites, national resources for history teachers, analyses of textbook content by guest historians, and searchable databases of online history lectures and historic sites. Users can submit questions via the “Ask A Historian” feature.
* '''Best Practices''' presents multimedia examples of classroom teaching, historical thinking, using primary sources, and best practices in teaching with textbooks. The goal of this section is to integrate existing research on history education with practical classroom experience to create, select, and annotate resources that emphasize best practices for teaching American history in elementary, middle, and high school classrooms.
* '''Teaching Materials''' presents classroom and teaching resources, including a searchable database of state standards. "Lesson Plan Reviews" highlights history instruction strategies, including scaffolding. Other features include "Teaching Guides," such as "Understanding and Interpreting Political Cartoons in the History Classroom," and a section on best practices when working with English language learners. Users can submit questions via the “Ask A Master Teacher” feature.
* '''Issues and Research''' presents briefs on current research in the teaching and learning of history, including articles from leading educational journals and individual studies in the teaching and learning of history nationally and internationally. Roundtable discussions present multiple views on pedagogy in the classroom. Guest participants in these discussions include professors, educational consultants, K-12 teachers, and other history and education professionals.
* '''Teaching American History (TAH) Projects''' provides informational essays on lessons learned from TAH grants, a database of TAH projects, and TAH project spotlights.
* '''Digital Classroom''' contains features on digital tools available for use in the classroom and best practices in implementing these tools.&lt;ref&gt;Schrum, Kelly, and Schrum, Lynn.

== Scholarship ==
Teachinghistory.org provides a clearinghouse for resources, as well as approaches informed by research on the teaching and learning of history. Special attention is devoted to strategies for incorporating historical thinking skills into classroom teaching.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.stanford.edu/news/2008/may14/hist-051408.html ''National History Education Clearinghouse is Launched Online''], ''Stanford Report'', May 14, 2008, accessed May 31, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Historical thinking skills are a set of reasoning skills, including close reading, corroboration, and contextualization, that help students think critically about the past.&lt;ref&gt;American Historical Association. [http://www.historians.org/teaching/policy/benchmarks.htm ''Benchmarks for Professional Development in Teaching of History as a Discipline'']. July 7, 2008, accessed May 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; These skills require a style of teaching that goes beyond lectures and rote memorization.&lt;ref&gt;Ash, Kate. [http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2011/06/15/35mm-history.h30.html "Schools Now Have Direct Access to Thousands of Primary Sources]," ''Education Week'', accessed August 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Teachinghistory.org is based on and adds to new research in history education.

The '''Test of Economic Literacy''' or '''TEL''' is a [[standardized test]] of [[economics]] nationally [[norm-referenced test|norm-referenced]] in the United States for use in upper-grade levels of high schools.  It is one of four grade-level specific standardized economics tests (i.e., [[Basic Economics Test]] (BET), [[Test of Economic Knowledge]] (TEK) and [[Test of Understanding in College Economics]] (TUCE) ) sponsored and published by the [[National Council on Economic Education]] (NCEE) .

The TEL is in its third edition and is available, along with an examiner’s manual, for teachers, school administrators and researchers through the NCEE.  The revision process took place at the [[National Center for Research in Economic Education]] (NCREE) and included norm-references that consisted of teacher and student participation from over 100 high schools across the United States.  The TEL has two parallel forms, each composed of forty 4-option [[multiple-choice]] items with [[content validity]] based on the [[Voluntary National Content Standards in Economics]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36908">'''Transformative learning''' theory says that the process of "perspective transformation" has three dimensions: psychological (changes in understanding of the self), convictional (revision of belief systems), and behavioral (changes in lifestyle).&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Transformative learning is the expansion of consciousness through the transformation of basic worldview and specific capacities of the self; transformative learning is facilitated through consciously directed processes such as appreciatively accessing and receiving the symbolic contents of the unconscious and critically analyzing underlying premises.&lt;ref&gt;Elias, 1997, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Perspective transformation, leading to transformative learning, occurs infrequently. [[Jack Mezirow]] believes that it usually results from a "disorienting dilemma" which is triggered by a [[identity crisis (psychology)|life crisis]] or major life transition—although it may also result from an accumulation of transformations in meaning schemes over a period of time.&lt;ref&gt;Mezirow, 1995, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Less dramatic predicaments, such as those created by a teacher, also promote transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Torosyan, 2007, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

An important part of transformative learning is for individuals to change their frames of reference by critically reflecting on their assumptions and beliefs and consciously making and implementing plans that bring about new ways of defining their worlds. This process is fundamentally rational and analytical.&lt;ref name="Mezirow, 1997"&gt;Mezirow, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grabove 1997, pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jack Mezirow==
[[Jack Mezirow]] developed transformative learning theory starting in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tc.columbia.edu/articles/2014/october/jack-mezirow-who-transformed-the-field-of-adult-learning-d/|title=Jack Mezirow, Who Transformed the Field of Adult Learning, Dies at 91|website=Teachers College - Columbia University|language=en|access-date=2017-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the theory has evolved "into a comprehensive and complex description of how learners construe, validate, and reformulate the meaning of their experience."&lt;ref&gt;Cranton, 1994, p.22&lt;/ref&gt; For learners to change their meaning schemes (specific beliefs, attitudes, and emotional reactions), "they must engage in critical reflection on their experiences, which in turn leads to a perspective transformation."&lt;ref&gt;Mezirow 1991, p.167&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning schemes that make up meaning structures may change as an individual adds to or integrates ideas within an existing scheme and, in fact, this transformation of meaning schemes occurs routinely through learning.

{{quote|A defining condition of being human is that we have to understand the meaning of our experience. For some, any uncritically assimilated explanation by an authority figure will suffice. But in contemporary societies we must learn to make our own interpretations rather than act on the purposes, beliefs, judgements, and feelings of others. Facilitating such understandings is the cardinal goal of adult education. Transformative learning develops autonomous thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Mezirow 1997, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A perspective transformation leading to transformative learning, however, occurs much less frequently. Mezirow believes that this less frequent transformation usually results from a "disorienting dilemma", which is triggered by a life crisis or major life transition, although it may also result from an accumulation of transformations in meaning schemes over a period of time.&lt;ref&gt;Mezirow 1995, p.50&lt;/ref&gt;

The perspective is explained by Mezirow as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Imel |first=Susan |title=Transformative Learning in Adulthood. ERIC Digest No. 200. |url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED423426 |date=1998 |website=[[Education Resources Information Center|ERIC]] |access-date=October 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kitchenham|first=Andrew|date=2008-04-01|title=The Evolution of John Mezirow's Transformative Learning Theory|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1541344608322678|journal=Journal of Transformative Education|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|pages=104–123|doi=10.1177/1541344608322678|issn=1541-3446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of critical responses to Mezirow's theory of transformative learning have emerged over the years.&lt;ref&gt;See Cranton (1994) and Taylor (1998) for a full discussion of these critiques.&lt;/ref&gt; One criticism of Mezirow's theory is its emphasis upon rationality. Some studies support Mezirow. Others conclude that Mezirow grants rational critical reflection too much importance.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 1998, pp. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward W. Taylor&lt;ref name="Transformative Learning Theory"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Taylor |author2=Edward W. |title= Transformative Learning Theory: A Neurobiological Perspective of the Role of Emotions and Unconscious Ways of Knowing|journal= International Journal of Lifelong Education |date=May–June 2001 |volume=20|issue=3|pages=218–236|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ627580 |doi=10.1080/02601370110036064}}&lt;/ref&gt; has since suggested neurobiological research as a promising area that may offer some explanation about the role emotions play, closing the gap between rationality and emotion in the transformative learning process. Taylor implies that, with available modern technology such as [[Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain|magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET), these once obscure factors can now be examined through determining which neurological brain systems are at work during disorienting dilemmas and the journey of recovery that follows.  This neurobiological research also stresses the importance of the role of [[implicit memory]], from which emerge habits, attitudes and preferences that are related to unconscious thoughts and actions.

While the learning process is certainly rational on some levels, it is also a profound experience that can be described as a spiritual or emotional transformation as well. The experience of undoing racist, sexist, and other oppressive attitudes can be painful and emotional, as these attitudes have often been developed as ways to cope with and make sense of the world. This type of learning requires taking risks, and a willingness to be vulnerable and have one's attitudes and assumptions challenged.

Other theorists have proposed a view of transformative learning as an intuitive and emotional process. John M. Dirkx, Robert D. Boyd, J. Gordon Myers, and Rosemary R. Ruether link Mezirow's rational, cognitive and analytical approach to a more intuitive, creative and holistic view of transformative learning.&lt;ref&gt;Grabove, 1997, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; This view of transformative learning is based primarily on the work of Robert Boyd,&lt;ref&gt;Boyd &amp; Myers, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; who has developed a theory of transformative education based on [[analytical psychology|analytical (or depth) psychology]].

For Boyd, transformation is a "fundamental change in one's personality involving [together] the resolution of a personal dilemma and the expansion of consciousness resulting in greater personality integration".&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, 1989, p. 459, cited in Taylor 1998, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; This calls upon extra-rational sources such as [[symbol]]s, [[image]]s, and [[archetype]]s to assist in creating a personal vision or meaning of what it means to be human.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd &amp; Myers, 1988; Cranton, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

First, an individual must be receptive or open to receiving "alternative expressions of meaning", and then recognize that the message is authentic.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd &amp; Myers, 1988, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; Grieving, considered by Boyd to be the most critical phase of the discernment process, takes place when an individual realizes that old patterns or ways of perceiving are no longer relevant, moves to adopt or establish new ways, and finally integrates old and new patterns.  More recent research has specifically explored the process of transformative learning as it occurs in bereaved elders,&lt;ref name= "Adult Education Quarterly" &gt;{{cite journal |last= Moon |first= Paul J.|title= Bereaved elders: Transformative Learning Late in Life.  Adult Education Quarterly |journal= Adult Education Quarterly |date=February 2011 |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=22–39|url=http://aeq.sagepub.com/content/61/1/22.abstract |doi=10.1177/0741713610363020}}&lt;/ref&gt; maintaining that the "disorienting dilemma" deemed necessary by Mezirow is present in the loss of a loved one, with an additional devastating factor being the isolation that the elderly in particular are likely to face. Another study considers transformative learning in the context of suicide bereavement.&lt;ref name= "Adult Education Quarterly b" &gt;{{cite journal | last= Sands |first= Diana. |author2=Tennant, Mark |title= Transformative Learning in the Context of Suicide Bereavement |journal= Adult Education Quarterly |date=February 2010 |volume=60  |issue=2|pages=99 |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/47875269/transformative-learning-context-suicide-bereavement |doi=10.1177/0741713609349932}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases the dilemma is compounded by the questioning of conceptions or misconceptions that were held about the relationship with the deceased, and the resolving of the meaning of that relationship during the grieving process.

Unlike Mezirow, who sees the ego as playing a central role in the process of perspective transformation, Boyd and Myers use a framework that moves beyond the ego and the emphasis on reason and logic to a definition of transformative learning that is more [[Social psychology#Psychosocial theory|psychosocial]] in nature.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 1998"&gt;Taylor, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition of transformative learning was put forward by Edmund O'Sullivan:&lt;ref name="OS"&gt;O'Sullivan, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Transformative learning involves experiencing a deep, structural shift in the basic premises of thought, feelings, and actions. It is a shift of consciousness that dramatically and irreversibly alters our way of being in the world. Such a shift involves our understanding of ourselves and our self-locations; our relationships with other humans and with the natural world; our understanding of relations of power in interlocking structures of class, race and gender; our body awareness, our visions of alternative approaches to living; and our sense of possibilities for social justice and peace and personal joy.}}

Positing that understanding transformative learning may have been hindered by perspectives of rational thought and Western traditions, Kathleen P. King&lt;ref name="OS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;King, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; provides an alternate model grounded in a meta-analysis of research, the "Transformative Learning Opportunities Model".

Recent considerations of these varying perspectives seem to indicate that one perspective does not need to exclude the other. For example, Mezirow and Dirkx discussed their views on transformative learning at a 2005 International Transformative Learning Conference. This dialogue, facilitated by Patricia Cranton, continued via email after the conference and the overview was published in the ''[[Journal of Transformative Education]]''.  Dirkx focuses on subjectivity, in the power of the inner world in one's shift in view of the outer world.  Mezirow emphasizes critical assessment of assumptions.  Although their approaches are different, they agree that their perspectives are similar in several aspects. This includes transforming frames of reference that have lost meaning or have become dysfunctional, and fostering enhanced awareness and consciousness of one's being in the world. Both perspectives are required to deepen understanding and to incorporate these ways of learning into transformative education.&lt;ref&gt;Dirkx, Mezirow &amp;Cranton, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the difficulties in defining transformative learning is that it bleeds into the boundaries of concepts such as "[[meaning making]]" or "[[critical thinking]]".

The term "meaning making" (i.e., constructing meaning) is found most frequently in [[constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]] approaches to education, based on the work of educators such as [[John Dewey]], [[Maria Montessori]], [[Jean Piaget]], [[Jerome Bruner]], and [[Lev Vygotsky]]. In the constructivist view, meaning is constructed from knowledge.

John Dirkx views transformational learning as a [[meaning-making]] process within adult education, aimed at promoting a democratic vision of society and self-actualization of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Dirkx, J. M. (1998). Transformative learning theory in the practice of adult education: An overview. ''PAACE Journal of Lifelong Learning, 7,'' 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Learning ''is'' life—not a preparation for it. Therefore, transformational learning requires authenticity, a commitment to focus on the here and now, and awareness of feelings and emotions within the learning setting. The relationship between the individual and the broader world is discussed in terms of the critical role it plays in learning. Dirkx describes our emotions and feelings as a kind of language for helping us learn about ourselves, our relationships with others and how we makes sense of all aspects of our experiences, both objective and subjective.&lt;ref&gt;Dirkx, J. M. (1997). Nurturing soul in adult education. Retrieved from https://www.msu.edu/~dirkx/DIRKX.CHP.htm#N_1_ on October 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Our sense of who we are and what our relationship is to the world must naturally be drawn into the learning process, leading to deeper engagements with ourselves and the world.

Mezirow&lt;ref&gt;Mezirow, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; posits that all learning is change but not all change is transformation. There is a difference between transmissional, transactional and transformational education.&lt;ref&gt;Miller &amp; Seller, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; In the first, knowledge is transmitted from teacher to student. In transactional education, it is recognized that the student has valuable experiences, and learns best through experience, inquiry, critical thinking and interaction with other learners. It could be argued that some of the research regarding transformative learning has been in the realm of transactional education, and that what is seen as transformative by some authors&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Cragg et al., 2001&lt;/ref&gt; is in fact still within the realm of transactional learning.

According to Stephen D. Brookfield, learning can only be considered transformative if it involves a fundamental questioning or reordering of how one thinks or acts; a challenge to hegemonic  implications.&lt;ref&gt;Brookfield, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, reflection alone does not result in transformative learning unless the process involves a critical reflection, a recognition and analysis of taken-for-granted assumptions.

==In practice==
On the surface, the two views of transformative learning presented here are contradictory. One advocates a rational approach that depends primarily on critical reflection whereas the other relies more on [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] and [[emotion]]. However, the differences in the two views may best be seen as a matter of emphasis. Both utilize rational processes and incorporate imagination as a part of a creative process. The two different views of transformative learning described here as well as examples of how it occurs in practice&lt;ref&gt;see Cranton, 1997 &amp; Taylor, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that no single model of transformative learning exists.

When transformative learning is the goal of [[adult education]], fostering a learning environment in which it can occur should consider the following:

===The role of the educator===
Transformative learning cannot be guaranteed.  Teachers can only provide an opportunity to transformatively learn.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;Fullerton, James Roderick. ''Transformative learning in college students: A mixed methods study''. The University of Nebraska-Lincoln, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to foster transformative learning, the educator's role is to assist learners in becoming aware and critical of assumptions. This includes their own assumptions that lead to their interpretations, beliefs, habits of mind, or points of view, as well as the assumptions of others. Educators must provide learners practice in recognizing frames of reference. By doing so, educators encourage practice in redefining problems from different perspectives.&lt;ref name="Mezirow, 1997" /&gt; The goal is to create a community of learners who are "united in a shared experience of trying to make meaning of their life experience".&lt;ref&gt;Loughlin, 1993, pp. 320–321&lt;/ref&gt;

Educators need to provide learners with opportunities to effectively participate in discourse.&lt;ref name="Mezirow, 1997" /&gt; Discourse involves assessing beliefs, feelings, and values.&lt;ref name="Cranton, 2006"&gt;Cranton, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This dialogue has the goal of assessing reasons behind competing interpretations through critical examination of evidence, arguments, and alternate points of view. Learners are able to validate how and what they understand, as well as develop well-informed judgments regarding a belief. Educators can encourage critical reflection and experience with discourse through the implementation of methods including metaphor analysis, concept mapping, consciousness raising, life histories, repertory grids, and participation in social action.&lt;ref name="Mezirow, 1997" /&gt;

The educator must encourage equal participation among students in discourse. One strategy is to encourage procedures that require group members to take on the roles of monitoring the direction of dialogue and ensuring equal participation. Educators can also encourage dialogue from different perspectives through controversial statements or readings from opposing points of view. It is necessary that the educator avoids shaping the discussion.&lt;ref name="Cranton, 2006" /&gt;

The role of educators is also to set objectives that include autonomous thinking.  By fostering learners' critical reflection and experience in discourse, autonomous thinking is possible. The foundations to thinking autonomously begin in childhood and continue in adulthood. The educator assists adult learners in becoming more critical in assessing assumptions, better at recognizing frames of references and alternate perspectives, as well as effective at collaborating with others to assess and arrive at judgments in regards to beliefs.&lt;ref name="Mezirow, 1997" /&gt;

It is the role of the educator to promote discovery learning through the implementation of classroom methods such as learning contracts, group projects, role play, case studies, and simulations. These methods facilitate transformative learning by helping learners examine concepts in the context of their lives and analyze the justification of new knowledge.&lt;ref name="Mezirow, 1997" /&gt;

The educator's role in establishing an environment that builds trust and care and facilitates the development of sensitive relationships among learners is a fundamental principle of fostering transformative learning.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 1998"/&gt; The educator also serves as a role model by demonstrating a willingness to learn and change.&lt;ref&gt;Cranton, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers should provide the environment to allow students to reflect on their transformative learning experiences, but to also allow them to reflect on their own.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;King, Kathleen P. "Both sides now: Examining transformative learning and professional development of educators." ''Innovative higher education'' 29.2 (2004): 155-174.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, professional development is important to assist educators in becoming authentic and critically reflective.&lt;ref name="Cranton &amp; King, 2003"&gt;Cranton &amp; King, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Mezirow outlines three ways in which experience is interpreted through reflection:&lt;ref&gt;Cranton, P., &amp; King, K.P. (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

* Content reflection is the investigation of the content. A question that we might ask ourselves is “what did I do that led to the outcome?
* Process reflection includes checking on the problem-solving strategies that are used in the  classroom. For example, “do I understand the needs of my students?”
* Premise reflection is the question of the problem itself. A question might be "“why do I feel responsible for this situation”.

===The role of professional development for the educator===
Transformative learning about teaching occurs when educators critically examine their practice and develop alternative perspectives of understanding their practice.&lt;ref name="Cranton, 1996"&gt;Cranton, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; It is essential that fostering this critical examination become the role of professional development. The role of professional development is to assist educators in gaining awareness of their habits of mind regarding teaching.&lt;ref name="Cranton &amp; King, 2003" /&gt; As this professional development occurs, educators critically examine the assumptions that underlie their practice, the consequences to their assumptions, and develop alternative perspectives on their practice.&lt;ref name="Cranton, 1996" /&gt;

Teachers need education and professional development that will help them to question, challenge and experience critical discussions on school improvement. Transforming teachers so they see themselves as agents of social change can be a challenge within education.&lt;ref&gt;Lysaker &amp; Furuness, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Strategies for transformative professional development ====
Strategies for transformative professional development include action plans, reflective activities, case studies, curriculum development, and critical-theory discussions. Action plans and reflective activities provide the practice and modelling of critical reflection on the profession of education, and provide guidance for the teaching and learning experience.&lt;ref name="Cranton &amp; King, 2003" /&gt; Through the use of real-life examples, case studies provide the opportunity to analyze assumptions, as well as the consequences of choices and actions. The use of case studies focuses on practice, and on the philosophical and practical aspects of educators' practice.&lt;ref name="Cranton &amp; King, 2003" /&gt; Curriculum development creates the opportunity to connect theory and practice. In addition to introducing new teaching techniques, educators can test and compare new concepts and practices with previous techniques. This testing and comparison moves away from uncritically accepting new teaching methods. Critical-theory discussions can be implemented to guide educators in questioning the meaning and purpose of information, encouraging educators to question the selection of the information they provide to their students.&lt;ref name="Cranton &amp; King, 2003" /&gt;

====Examples in educator professional development====
Mentoring is another strategy for transformative professional, personal and organizational development. By creating a supportive culture, mentoring can provide the environment for transformative learning to occur. Through this experience mentoring becomes a transformative relationship in which individuals reconstruct possible selves. As a two-way process, mentoring is a learning tool for both the mentor as well as the person being mentored.&lt;ref name="Fletcher, 2007"&gt;Fletcher, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent study, Karen Weller Swanson, applying theories of critical reflection, incorporating a critical incident model, and positing a learning partnership, designed a program for practicing teachers, for the purpose of transformative teacher development. Experiences were created to get teachers to reflect on their assumptions, asking them to consider alternative perspectives and to develop a language for making connections between theory and practice. Over the studies' two-year period, teachers were able to develop ownership of theory and transfer this knowledge into their practice. To be effective, transformative teacher development must value what teachers bring from their personal and professional experience, and acknowledge that learning is both an individual and a social experience.  The process involved: achieving transparency through negotiation of curriculum, finding a common language through discussion of individual assumptions, getting continuous feedback through critical-incident questions, and testing by teacher application of the program within their classrooms. Autobiography and journaling were additional techniques used within this learning partnership. Both teachers and faculty participating in the program were transformed as beliefs were challenged and knowledge was co-constructed throughout the experience.&lt;ref&gt;Swanson, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

New teachers often find expectations ambiguous, and they lack the self-awareness and understanding to navigate the educational environment. A transformative learning framework was used in a Foundations course, for participants to build on individual and collective analysis of teaching experiences, and to help them re-frame their practice. Giedre Kligyte investigated "transformation narratives" that emerged from written reflection of participants' teaching practice, based on individual reflection and group discussion. By using Mezirow's work, along with Robert Kegan's [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructive developmental theory]], Kligyte found the following themes: a move from non-reflective habitual action to a more conscious practice; a change in perspective to a more sophisticated view of teaching; an increased sense of agency, including the concept that academic practice is an object which can be controlled and shaped, rather than something externally imposed; increased confidence to take risks and experiment; and a more multifaceted idea of what it means to be an academic. The conducive environment allowed for transformative experiences to occur. Through creation of a safe social context where "disorienting dilemmas" can be examined, questioned, and explored, participants were able to develop a new "frame of reference" and reintegrate learning into practice. Kligyte cautions that there are limitations to the framework, such as the possibility that participants will conform to expectations in their reflections. She notes that the "transformation narratives" examined are not a single, final narrative of the self, but a snapshot for further exploration.&lt;ref&gt;Kligyte, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Kligyte's findings are similar to S. Fletcher's: that transformative learning helps to make sense of a complex and often ambiguous work environment, which requires multiple selves.&lt;ref name="Fletcher, 2007"/&gt;

===The role of the learner===
The educator becomes a facilitator when the goal of learning is for learners to construct knowledge about themselves, others, and social norms. As a result, learners play an important role in the learning environment and process.&lt;ref name="Cranton, 2006" /&gt;  Learners must create norms within the classroom that include civility, respect, and responsibility for helping one another learn. Learners must welcome diversity within the learning environment and aim for peer collaboration.&lt;ref name="Mezirow, 1997" /&gt;

Learners must become critical of their own assumptions in order to transform their unquestioned frame of reference. Through communicative learning, learners must work towards critically reflecting on assumptions that underlie intentions, values, beliefs, and feelings.&lt;ref name="Mezirow, 1997" /&gt; Learners are involved in objective re-framing of their frames of reference when they critically reflect on the assumptions of others. In contrast, subjective re-framing occurs when learners critically assess their own assumptions.&lt;ref name="Mezirow, 1997" /&gt;

The role of the learner involves actively participating in discourse. Through discourse, learners are able to validate what is being communicated to them. This dialogue provides the opportunity to critically examine evidence, arguments, and alternate points of view, which fosters collaborative learning.&lt;ref name="Mezirow, 1997" /&gt;

===The role of the rational and the affective===
Transformative learning has two components that at times seem to be in conflict: the cognitive, rational, and objective and the intuitive, imaginative, and subjective.&lt;ref&gt;Grabove, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Both the rational and the affective play a role in transformative learning. Although the emphasis has been on transformative learning as a rational process, teachers need to consider how they can help students use feelings and emotions both in critical reflection and as a means of reflection.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kegan, Robert (2000) What "form" transforms? A constructive-developmental approach to transformative learning. In Mezirow &amp; Associates Learning as Transformation: Critical Perspectives on a Theory in Progress. San Francisco: Jossey Bass&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of educational and research institutions that are based on the principles of transformative learning. Some examples include the [[Transformative Studies Institute]] and The Transformative Learning Centre at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE) of the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Sullivan, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence is emerging on the applicability of transformative theory in new educational programmes, in business and industry education, health professional education, community education such as courses offered by YMCA, and informal settings such as self-help groups. Phil Bamber and Les Hankin describe how students in a service-learning section experienced perspective transformation and shifts of their world-view when their training was influenced by transformative learning theory.&lt;ref name= "Transformative learning through service-learning"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Bamber |first= Phil. |author2=Les Hankin |title= Transformative learning through service-learning: no passport required |journal= Transformative learning through service-learning|year=2011 | volume=53|issue=2/3|pages=190–206|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=1917978 |doi=10.1108/00400911111115726}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Susan Imel states that transformative learning may not always be a goal of education, but its importance should not be overlooked. Educators should strive to understand it, even if they choose not to foster it.&lt;ref&gt;Imel, 1997.pg 4&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The '''University Pastoral Center''' ('''Univerzitné pastoračné centrum''') in [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]] is the [[Slovakia|Slovak]] equivalent of a  [[Newman's center]], University [[chaplaincy]], [[Campus ministry]] or a similar  [[Roman Catholic Church]] institution for students and youth. It is situated in the city near the universities.

The '''Whites Only Scholarship''' was founded in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/EDUCATION/02/18/whites.only.scholars/ | work=CNN | title=Whites-only scholarship generates controversy | date=February 18, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Jason Mattera]], a Hispanic [[Roger Williams University]] student and member of the school [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The [[scholarship]] was a proposal to parody and highlight what Mattera perceives as inequity and unfairness of racial preferences at his school and other educational institutions in America. While a parody, it was still executed. The winner, architecture major Tony Capriccio, was awarded a cash award.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|y9qbhSuzHzs|Jason Mattera on CNN, November 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mattera himself is of Puerto Rican descent and received a $5,000 scholarship open only to a minority group.&lt;ref name="Scholarship Created"&gt;{{cite news

==Reasons==
Mattera argues that he supports private organizations such as the [[Hispanic College Fund]], [[The United Negro College Fund]], and other groups that are privately funded and ethnically-based that award scholarships to members of their own communities, a position he claims is fully in line with freedom of association. However, he is opposed to federally subsidized institutions creating two classes of persons by imposing different standards on them. Either such universities should compile race-based scholarships for all students, or they should award scholarships on the basis of merit alone, he writes.&lt;ref name="lewrockwell" /&gt;

Roger Williams University chapter of the College Republicans (RWUCR) was condemned by [[Rhode Island's Republican Party]] and were no longer allowed to use a capital "R" in their name.&lt;ref name="lewrockwell"&gt;{{cite news

==Similar scholarships==

===KOPSES===
A similar scholarship was offered two months later at the [[University of Missouri]] by Colin Kerr,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 | title=Duo creates ’White Scholarship’ as protest
 | date=April 15, 2004
 | work=[[Columbia Missourian]]
 | url=http://www.columbiamissourian.com/stories/2004/04/15/duo-creates-white-scholarship-as-protest/

While Kerr consulted with Mattera before the release of the scholarship, he maintains it was independent project planned months before the release of scholarship at Roger Williams.  Under the auspices of a group called the Kerr-Otis Partnership for Socio-Economic Scholarships (KOPSES), Kerr echoed similar arguments to that of Mattera, though his scholarship eligibility requirement of 1/8 European-American descent mirrored that of the [[University of Missouri-Columbia]]'s criteria for minority status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, before the announcement of the scholarship Kerr brokered a deal between both the leaders of the liberal and conservative campus publications to remain neutral in their coverage.  The essay contest asked students to describe "how their European-American heritage affected their view of race-based scholarships."  An Asian-American student, whose essay detailed a history of discrimination by his Asian relatives for being partially Caucasian, was awarded the scholarship.

Kerr's KOPSES organization eventually received wide multi-party support and later morphed into the American-Coalition for Socio-Economic Scholarships (ACSES), a short-lived national awareness group that lasted for over a year until its original funding ran short of its operating costs.

===CARS===
The trend in more sophisticated race-based scholarship protests continued when a white scholarship was offered at [[Boston University]], known as the Caucasian Achievement and Recognition Scholarship.  Similar to the KOPSES scholarship, the CARS scholarship required applicants to have at least 1/4 Caucasian heritage and although it required a photograph, did not specify that the photograph would be used as proof of race (since partially Caucasian applicants can apply).

=== Columbia ===
In 2013, a court affidavit filed by [[JPMorgan Chase]] revealed a graduate-student scholarship fund at [[Columbia University]] given only to persons of the Caucasian race.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/05/columbia-white-scholarship/315166/|title=How Columbia's 'Illegal' White-Only Scholarship Disappeared|last=Trotter|first=J.K.|date=2013-05-16|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-07-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This scholarship, which was established in 1920, has been reportedly awarding aid for 77 years and was valued at $840,000.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The university has temporarily stopped it, hence the JPMorgan Chase affidavit, requesting it to be struck down. According to school administrators, they willfully overlooked racial restrictions when awarding the scholarship but did not specify if the scholarship was ever given to a person of color.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Recipients were also unaware of the race requirements.

==First scholarship==
'''1994 The first Court Ordered White Only Scholarships was created at Historically Black Colleges in Alabama'''

The Knight litigation commenced on January 15, 1981, when John F. Knight, Jr., and a class of other alumni, students, and faculty members of [[Alabama State University]] (ASU) filed suit in the Middle District of Alabama to attack alleged vestiges of segregation in public higher education.  Knight v. Alabama, 900 F. Supp. 272, .280 (N.D. Ala. 1995) ("Knight II")[4]. The "other-race" scholarships created at ASU pursuant to the Court's 1995 Decree in Knight II violate their rights under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] and {{UnitedStatesCode|42|1981}}, {{UnitedStatesCodeSec|42|1983}}, and {{UnitedStatesCodeSec|42|2000d}}.

In [[Tompkins v. Alabama State University]], 97-M-1482-S (N.D. Ala. 1998). lead plaintiff Jessie Tompkins filed this original action Pro Se, he was influence by ''[[Hopwood v. Texas]]'', 78 F.3d 932 (5th Cir. 1996), Hopwood was the first successful legal challenge to a university's affirmative action policy in student admissions since ''[[Regents of the University of California v. Bakke]]'', 438 U.S. 265 (1978).The case was filed in the [[U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama]] before [[Myron Herbert Thompson]]. Tompkins alleged that he was denied equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the rights guaranteed them by 42 U. S. C. Sections 2000d, 1981 and 1983 of the Civil Rights Act to participate in ASU’s All-White Scholarship Program and to eliminate the race requirements. Forty percent of Alabama State University academic grants went to whites.&lt;ref name="WSJ-Kronholz"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cir-usa.org/1997/12/double-reverse/ | title=Double Reverse Scholarship program for whites becomes a test of preferences | publisher=[[The Center for Individual Rights]] | work=[[Wall Street Journal]] | date=December 23, 1997 | accessdate=October 10, 2017 | author=Kronholz, June| authorlink = June Kronholz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are initiatives that led to scholarships that resemble the requirement mandated by the court-ordered "white-only" scholarships for HBCs in Alabama. These include an agreement between [[Southern University]], a historically black university, and [[Louisiana State University]], which has a historically white student population. These institutions committed to increasing their minority enrollment by 10 percent in order to settle a 20-year desegration suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding the Backlash Against Affirmative Action|last=Fobanjong|first=John|publisher=Nova Publishers|year=2001|isbn=9781590330654|location=New York|pages=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;
