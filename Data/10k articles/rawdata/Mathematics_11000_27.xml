      <comment>1) Unlike Abel Prize, Fields medal does not need promotion. 2) I don't see any strong consensus on Talk Page regarding the mention of Fields Medal. 3) IREG was added by someone else (not me) to claim Abel Prize as the "most prestigious". I added ARWU to balance the claim. 4) I will keep an eye on this article.</comment>

Per [[WP:LEAD]], the lead section is a summary of the content in the body of the article, and Fields medal isn't discussed in the body of the article, and therefore doesn't belong in the lead. Furthermore, it was previously decided not to mention it in the lead. This is the article about the Abel Prize, not the Fields medal. --&gt;

The Abel Prize's history dates back to 1899, when its establishment was proposed by the Norwegian mathematician [[Sophus Lie]] when he learned that [[Alfred Nobel]]'s plans for annual prizes would not include a prize in mathematics. In 1902 [[Oscar II of Sweden|King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway]] indicated his willingness to finance a mathematics prize to complement the Nobel Prizes, but the establishment of the prize was prevented by the [[dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden]] in 1905. It took almost a century before the prize was finally established by the Government of Norway in 2001, and it was specifically intended "to give the mathematicians their own equivalent of a Nobel Prize."&lt;ref name="maa" /&gt; The laureates are selected by the Abel Committee, the members of which are appointed by the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]].

The award ceremony takes place in the Aula of the [[University of Oslo]], where the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] was awarded between 1947 and 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oslooperahouse.com/oslo-university-of-oslo/|title=University of Oslo|publisher=Oslo Opera House|accessdate=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Abel Prize board has also established an Abel symposium, administered by the [[Norwegian Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref name="Main"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abelprize.no/|title=Main Page |publisher=The Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters|accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The prize was first proposed in 1899, to be part of the celebration of the 100th anniversary of [[Niels Henrik Abel]]'s birth in 1902.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abelprize.no/c53679/artikkel/vis.html?tid=53709|title=The History of the Abel Prize|publisher=The Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters|accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before his death in 1899, the Norwegian mathematician [[Sophus Lie]] proposed establishing an Abel Prize when he learned that [[Alfred Nobel]]'s plans for annual prizes would not include a prize in mathematics. [[Oscar II of Sweden|King Oscar II]] was willing to finance a mathematics prize in 1902, and the mathematicians [[Ludwig Sylow]] and [[Carl Størmer]] drew up statutes and rules for the proposed prize. However, Lie's influence waned after his death, and the [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden|dissolution of the union between Sweden and Norway]] in 1905 ended the first attempt to create an Abel Prize.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

[[File:Oslo Universitet 2.jpg|thumb|The prize is awarded in the aula of the ''Domus Media'' building of the [[University of Oslo Faculty of Law]], where the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] was formerly awarded]]

After interest in the concept of the prize had risen in 2001, a working group was formed to develop a proposal, which was presented to the Prime Minister of Norway in May. In August 2001, the Norwegian government announced that the prize would be awarded beginning in 2002, the two-hundredth [[anniversary]] of Abel's birth. [[Atle Selberg]] received an honorary Abel Prize in 2002, but the first actual Abel Prize was awarded in 2003.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Selberg|title=Atle Selberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A book series presenting Abel Prize laureates and their research was commenced in 2010. The first two volumes cover the years 2003–2007 and 2008–2012 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.springer.com/math/history+of+mathematics/book/978-3-642-01372-0|title=The Abel Prize 2003–2007 |publisher=Springer |year=2010 |isbn=978-3-642-01372-0 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-01373-7 |editor=H.

== Selection criteria and funding ==
Anyone may submit a nomination for the Abel Prize, however, self-nominations are not permitted. The nominee must be alive; however, if the awardee dies after being declared as the winner, the prize will be awarded posthumously. 

The [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]] declares the winner of the Abel Prize each March after recommendation by the Abel Committee, which consists of five leading mathematicians. Both Norwegians and non-Norwegians may serve on the Committee. They are elected by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters and nominated by the [[International Mathematical Union]] and the [[European Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nomination"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abelprize.no/c53676/artikkel/vis.html?tid=53705&amp;strukt_tid=53676|title=Nomination Guidelines|publisher=The Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters|accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee is of 2018 chaired by Norwegian mathematician [[Hans Munthe-Kaas]] ([[University of Bergen]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abelprize.no/c53678/artikkel/vis.html?tid=53708|title=The Abel Committee 2018/2019|website=www.abelprize.no|language=en|access-date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and was before that, headed by Professor [[John Rognes (mathematician)|John Rognes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abelprize.no/c53678/artikkel/vis.html?tid=53708 |title=The Abel Committee 2015/2016|accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Funding ===
The Norwegian Government gave the prize an initial funding of NOK 200 million (about €21.7 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/finance/converter?a=200000000&amp;from=NOK&amp;to=EUR&amp;meta=ei%3DPknZWIj5OMTCsQHZ8JYg|title=Google Currency Converter|accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in 2001. Previously, the funding came from the Abel foundation, but today the prize is financed directly through the national budget. 

The funding is controlled by the Board, which consists of members elected by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.&lt;ref name="Nomination" /&gt;. The current leader of the Board is [[John Grue]].

In [[theoretical computer science]], '''Actor model theory''' concerns theoretical issues for the [[Actor model]].

Actors are the primitives that form the basis of the [[Actor model]] of concurrent digital computation.  In response to a message that it receives, an Actor can make local decisions, create more Actors, send more messages, and designate how to respond to the next message received.  Actor model theory incorporates theories of the events and structures of Actor computations, their proof theory, and [[denotational semantics of the Actor model|denotational models]].

==Events and their orderings==
From the definition of an Actor, it can be seen that numerous events take place:  local decisions, creating Actors, sending messages, receiving messages, and designating how to respond to the next message received.

However, this article focuses on just those events that are the arrival of a message sent to an Actor.

This article reports on the results published in Hewitt [2006].

:''Law of Countability'': There are at most countably many events.

===Activation ordering===
The activation ordering (&lt;code&gt;-≈→&lt;/code&gt;) is a fundamental ordering that models one event activating another (there must be energy flow in the message passing from an event to an event which it activates).

*Because of the transmission of energy, the activation ordering is ''[[General relativity|relativistically]] [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]]''; that is, for all events &lt;code&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;code&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, if &lt;code&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; -≈→ e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, then the time of &lt;code&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt; precedes the time of  &lt;code&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in the relativistic [[Frame of reference|frames of reference]] of all observers.
*''Law of Strict Causality for the Activation Ordering'':  For no event does &lt;code&gt;e -≈→ e&lt;/code&gt;.
*''Law of Finite Predecession in the Activation Ordering'':  For all events &lt;code&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt; the set &lt;code&gt;{e|e -≈→ e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;/code&gt; is finite.

===Arrival orderings===
The arrival ordering of an Actor &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; ( &lt;code&gt;-x→ &lt;/code&gt;) models the (total) ordering of events in which a message arrives at &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;.  Arrival ordering is determined by ''arbitration'' in processing messages (often making use of a digital circuit called an [[Arbiter (electronics)|arbiter]]). The arrival events of an Actor are on its [[world line]].  The arrival ordering means that the Actor model inherently has indeterminacy (see [[Indeterminacy in concurrent computation]]).

*Because all of the events of the arrival ordering of an actor &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; happen on the world line of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, the arrival ordering of an actor is ''relativistically invariant''. ''I.e.'', for all actors &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and events &lt;code&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;code&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, if &lt;code&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; -x→ e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, then the time of &lt;code&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt; precedes the time of &lt;code&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in the relativistic frames of reference of all observers.
*''Law of Finite Predecession in Arrival Orderings'':  For all events &lt;code&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and Actors &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;  the set &lt;code&gt;{e|e -x→ e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;/code&gt; is finite.

===Combined ordering===
The combined ordering (denoted by &lt;code&gt;→&lt;/code&gt;) is defined to be the transitive closure of the activation ordering and the arrival orderings of all Actors.

*The combined ordering is relativistically invariant because it is the transitive closure of relativistically invariant orderings. ''I.e.'', for all events &lt;code&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;code&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, if &lt;code&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;→e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. then the time of &lt;code&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt; precedes the time of &lt;code&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in the relativistic frames of reference of all observers.
*''Law of Strict Causality for the Combined Ordering'':  For no event does &lt;code&gt;e→e&lt;/code&gt;.

The combined ordering is obviously transitive by definition.

In [Baker and Hewitt 197?], it was conjectured that the above laws might entail the following law:

:''Law of Finite Chains Between Events in the Combined Ordering'':  There are no infinite chains (''i.e.'', linearly ordered sets) of events between two events in the combined ordering →.

===Independence of the Law of Finite Chains Between Events in the Combined Ordering===
However, [Clinger 1981] surprisingly proved that the Law of Finite Chains Between Events in the Combined Ordering is independent of the previous laws, ''i.e.'',

Theorem.  ''The Law of Finite Chains Between Events in the Combined Ordering does not follow from the previously stated laws.''

Proof.  It is sufficient to show that there is an Actor computation that satisfies the previously stated laws but violates the Law of Finite Chains Between Events in the Combined Ordering.

:Consider a computation which begins when an actor ''Initial'' is sent a &lt;code&gt;Start&lt;/code&gt; message causing it to take the following actions
:#Create a new actor ''Greeter&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' which is sent the message &lt;code&gt;SayHelloTo&lt;/code&gt; with the address of ''Greeter&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''
:#Send ''Initial'' the message &lt;code&gt;Again&lt;/code&gt; with the address of ''Greeter&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''

:Thereafter the behavior of ''Initial'' is as follows on receipt of an &lt;code&gt;Again&lt;/code&gt; message with address ''Greeter&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' (which we will call the event &lt;code&gt;'''Again&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/code&gt;):
:#Create a new actor ''Greeter&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt;'' which is sent the message &lt;code&gt;SayHelloTo&lt;/code&gt; with address ''Greeter&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''
:#Send ''Initial'' the message &lt;code&gt;Again&lt;/code&gt; with the address of ''Greeter&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt;''
:Obviously the computation of ''Initial'' sending itself &lt;code&gt;Again&lt;/code&gt; messages never terminates.

:The behavior of each Actor ''Greeter&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is as follows:
:*When it receives a message &lt;code&gt;SayHelloTo&lt;/code&gt; with address ''Greeter&lt;sub&gt;i-1&lt;/sub&gt;'' (which we will call the event &lt;code&gt;'''SayHelloTo&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/code&gt;), it sends a &lt;code&gt;Hello&lt;/code&gt; message to ''Greeter&lt;sub&gt;i-1&lt;/sub&gt;''
:*When it receives a &lt;code&gt;Hello&lt;/code&gt; message (which we will call the event &lt;code&gt;'''Hello&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/code&gt;), it does nothing.
:Now it is possible that &lt;code&gt;'''Hello&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' -''Greeter&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''→ '''SayHelloTo&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/code&gt; every time and therefore &lt;code&gt;'''Hello&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''→'''SayHelloTo&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/code&gt;.
:Also &lt;code&gt;'''Again&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' -≈→ '''Again&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/code&gt; every time and therefore &lt;code&gt;'''Again&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' → '''Again&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/code&gt;.

:Furthermore all of the laws stated before the Law of Strict Causality for the Combined Ordering are satisfied.
:However, there may be an infinite number of events in the combined ordering between &lt;code&gt;'''Again&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;'''SayHelloTo&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/code&gt; as follows:
:&lt;code&gt;'''Again&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''→...→'''Again&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''→...&lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;...→'''Hello&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''→'''SayHelloTo&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''→...→'''Hello&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''→'''SayHelloTo&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/code&gt;

However, we know from physics that infinite energy cannot be expended along a finite trajectory.  Therefore, since the Actor model is based on physics, the Law of Finite Chains Between Events in the Combined Ordering was taken as an axiom of the Actor model.

===Law of Discreteness===
The Law of Finite Chains Between Events in the Combined Ordering is closely related to the following law:
:''Law of Discreteness'':  For all events &lt;code&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, the set &lt;code&gt;{e|e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;→e→e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;/code&gt; is finite.

In fact the previous two laws have been shown to be equivalent:

:Theorem [Clinger 1981].  ''The Law of Discreteness is equivalent to the Law of Finite Chains Between Events in the Combined Ordering'' (without using the axiom of choice.)

The law of discreteness rules out [[Zeno machine]]s and is related to results on [[Petri net]]s [Best ''et al.'' 1984, 1987].

The Law of Discreteness implies the property of [[unbounded nondeterminism]].  The combined ordering is used by [Clinger 1981] in the construction of a denotational model of Actors (see [[denotational semantics]]).

==Denotational semantics==
Clinger [1981] used the Actor event model described above to construct a [[Denotational semantics of the Actor model#Clinger.27s Model|denotational model for Actors using power domains]].   Subsequently Hewitt [2006] augmented the diagrams with arrival times to construct a [[Denotational semantics of the Actor model#The Timed Diagrams Model|technically simpler denotational model]] that is easier to understand.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2035">'''Age at Risk''' ('''[[AaR]]''') is a time-based [[risk measure]] designed to measure [[longevity risk]] in actuarial models.

AaR represents certain [[quantile]] for a given probability distribution, so is similar to '''[[Value at Risk]]'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jorion|first=Philippe|title=Value at risk : the new benchmark for managing financial risk|year=2007|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-07-146495-6|edition=3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ('''[[Value at risk|VaR]]''').
But, AaR measures risk amount as time(time until an adverse event) rather than value(loss amount).

Age at Risk is a special case of '''[[Time at Risk]]''' ('''[[TaR]]'''). 
When TaR is applied to a household's financial planning rather than corporate finance,
TaR in this case is referred to as AaR.

In fact, TaR is an expanded idea from AaR which is originated by [[actuary|actuaries]].
In actuaries's view, [[loss model]] and [[survival model]] are identical, so they could naturally transform VaR into time-based measure.
Survival model is actively used in life insurance modeling, but the application is not limited to this area. Anything that has lifespan can be a subject of survival model; for example, durability of products, default of bonds, bankruptcy of companies etc.
AaR had been used in models that include a person's lifetime as a random variable, and it was naturally expanded to TaR as actuaries generalized subjects of models.

== Definition ==
Mathematical definition of AaR is same as [[Value at risk#Mathematical definition|that of VaR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Embrechts|first=Alexander J. McNeil, Rüdiger Frey, Paul|title=Quantitative risk management : concepts, techniques and tools|year=2005|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J.|isbn=978-0-691-12255-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, value-based random variable is replaced with time-based one (age), and given time-horizon is replaced with given finance structure of a household.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4255">In [[mathematics]], in the area of [[order theory]], an '''antichain''' is a subset of a [[partially ordered set]] such that any two distinct elements in the subset are incomparable. (Some authors use the term "antichain" to mean [[strong antichain]], a subset such that there is no element of the [[Partially ordered set|poset]] smaller than two distinct elements of the antichain.)

Let ''S'' be a partially ordered set.  We say two elements ''a'' and ''b'' of a partially ordered set are '''[[Comparability|comparable]]''' if ''a'' ≤ ''b'' or ''b'' ≤ ''a''.  If two elements are not comparable, we say they are '''incomparable'''; that is, ''x'' and ''y'' are incomparable if neither ''x'' ≤ ''y'' nor ''y'' ≤ ''x''.

A '''chain''' in ''S'' is a [[subset]] ''C'' of ''S'' in which each pair of elements is comparable; that is, ''C'' is [[Total order|totally ordered]]. An '''antichain''' in ''S'' is a [[subset]] ''A'' of ''S'' in which each pair of different elements is incomparable; that is, there is no order relation between any two different elements in ''A''.

== Height and width ==

A '''maximal antichain''' is an antichain that is not a [[proper subset]] of any other antichain. A '''maximum antichain''' is an antichain that has cardinality at least as large as every other antichain. The ''width'' of a partially ordered set is the cardinality of a maximum antichain. Any antichain can intersect any chain in at most one element, so, if we can partition the elements of an order into ''k'' chains then the width of the order must be at most ''k'' (if the antichain has more than "k" elements, by the Pigeonhole Principle, there would be 2 of its elements belonging to the same chain, contradiction). [[Dilworth's theorem]] states that this bound can always be reached: there always exists an antichain, and a partition of the elements into chains, such that the number of chains equals the number of elements in the antichain, which must therefore also equal the width. Similarly, we can define the ''height'' of a partial order to be the maximum cardinality of a chain. [[Mirsky's theorem]] states similarly that in any partial order of finite height, the height equals the smallest number of antichains into which the order may be partitioned.

== Sperner families ==

An antichain in the inclusion ordering of subsets of an ''n''-element set is known as a [[Sperner family]]. The number of different Sperner families is counted by the [[Dedekind number]]s, the first few of which numbers are
:2, 3, 6, 20, 168, 7581, 7828354, 2414682040998, 56130437228687557907788 {{OEIS|id=A000372}}.
Even the empty set has two antichains in its power set: one containing a single set (the empty set itself) and one containing no sets.

== Join and meet operations ==

Any antichain ''A'' corresponds to a [[lower set]]
:&lt;math&gt;L_A = \{x \mid \exists y\in A\mbox{ s.t. }x\le y\}.&lt;/math&gt;
In a finite partial order (or more generally a partial order satisfying the [[ascending chain condition]]) all lower sets have this form. The union of any two lower sets is another lower set, and the union operation corresponds in this way to a '''join''' operation
on antichains:
:&lt;math&gt;A \vee B = \{ x \in A\cup B \mid \not\exists y\in A\cup B\mbox{ s.t. }x &lt; y\}.&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, we can define a '''meet''' operation on antichains, corresponding to the intersection of lower sets:
:&lt;math&gt;A \wedge B = \{ x\in L_A\cap L_B\mid \not\exists y\in L_A\cap L_B\mbox{ s.t. }x &lt; y\}.&lt;/math&gt;
The join and meet operations on all finite antichains of finite subsets of a set ''X'' define a [[distributive lattice]], the free distributive lattice generated by ''X''. [[Birkhoff's representation theorem]] for distributive lattices states that every finite distributive lattice can be represented via join and meet operations on antichains of a finite partial order, or equivalently as union and intersection operations on the [[lower set]]s of the partial order.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3238">In the mathematical field of [[order theory]], an element ''a'' of a [[partially ordered set]] with [[least element]] '''0''' is an '''atom''' if '''0''' &lt; ''a'' and there is no ''x'' such that '''0''' &lt; ''x'' &lt; ''a''. 

Equivalently, one may define an atom to be an element that is [[minimal element|minimal]] among the non-zero elements, or alternatively an element that [[covering relation|covers]] the least element '''0'''.

==Atomic orderings==

Let &lt;: denote the cover relation in a partially ordered set.

A partially ordered set with a least element '''0''' is '''atomic''' if every element ''b''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''0''' has an atom ''a'' below it, that is, there is some ''a'' such that ''b''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;nbsp;:&gt;&amp;nbsp;''0''.  Every finite partially ordered set with '''0''' is atomic, but the set of nonnegative [[real number]]s (ordered in the usual way) is not atomic (and in fact has no atoms).

A partially ordered set is '''relatively atomic''' (or ''strongly atomic'') if for all ''a''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''b'' there is an element ''c'' such that ''a''&amp;nbsp;&lt;:&amp;nbsp;''c''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''b'' or, equivalently, if every interval [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] is atomic. Every relatively atomic partially ordered set with a least element is atomic. Every finite poset is relatively atomic,

A partially ordered set with least element '''0''' is called '''atomistic''' if every element is the [[least upper bound]] of a set of atoms. The linear order with three elements is not atomistic (see Fig.2).

Atoms in partially ordered sets are abstract generalizations of [[Singleton (mathematics)|singleton]]s in [[set theory]] (see Fig.1). Atomicity (the property of being atomic) provides an abstract generalization in the context of [[order theory]] of the ability to select an element from a non-empty set.

==Coatoms==
The terms ''coatom'', ''coatomic'', and ''coatomistic'' are defined dually.  Thus, in a partially ordered set with [[greatest element]] '''1''', one says that
* a '''coatom''' is an element covered by '''1''',
* the set is '''coatomic''' if every ''b''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;'''1''' has a coatom ''c'' above it, and
* the set is '''coatomistic''' if every element is the [[greatest lower bound]] of a set of coatoms.

In [[computer vision]] a '''camera matrix''' or '''(camera) projection matrix''' is a &lt;math&gt;3 \times 4&lt;/math&gt; [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] which describes the mapping of a [[pinhole camera]] from 3D points in the world to 2D points in an image.

Let &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x} &lt;/math&gt; be a representation of a 3D point in [[homogeneous coordinates]] (a 4-dimensional vector), and let &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y} &lt;/math&gt; be a representation of the image of this point in the pinhole camera (a 3-dimensional vector). Then the following relation holds

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y} \sim \mathbf{C} \, \mathbf{x} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{C} &lt;/math&gt; is the camera matrix and the &lt;math&gt;\, \sim &lt;/math&gt; sign implies that the left and right hand sides are equal up to a non-zero scalar multiplication.

Since the camera matrix  &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{C} &lt;/math&gt;  is involved in the mapping between elements of two [[projective space]]s, it too can be regarded as a projective element. This means that it has only 11 degrees of freedom since any multiplication by a non-zero scalar results in an equivalent camera matrix.

== Derivation ==
The mapping from the coordinates of a 3D point '''P''' to the 2D image coordinates of the point's projection onto the image plane, according to the [[pinhole camera model]] is given by

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\ y_2 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{f}{x_3} \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; (x_1, x_2, x_3) &lt;/math&gt; are the 3D coordinates of '''P''' relative to a camera centered coordinate system, &lt;math&gt; (y_1, y_2) &lt;/math&gt; are the resulting image coordinates, and ''f'' is the camera's focal length for which we assume ''f'' &gt; 0.  Furthermore, we also assume that ''x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0''.

To derive the camera matrix this expression is rewritten in terms of homogeneous coordinates. Instead of the 2D vector &lt;math&gt; (y_1,y_2) &lt;/math&gt; we consider the projective element (a 3D vector) &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y} = (y_1,y_2,1) &lt;/math&gt; and instead of equality we consider equality up to scaling by a non-zero number, denoted &lt;math&gt;\, \sim &lt;/math&gt;. First, we write the homogeneous image coordinates as expressions in the usual 3D coordinates.

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\ y_2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{f}{x_3} \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \frac{x_3}{f} \end{pmatrix} \sim \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \frac{x_3}{f} \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

Finally, also the 3D coordinates are expressed in a homogeneous representation &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x} &lt;/math&gt; and this is how the camera matrix appears:

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\ y_2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \sim \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{1}{f} &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \, \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; or &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y} \sim \mathbf{C} \, \mathbf{x} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{C} &lt;/math&gt; is the camera matrix, which here is given by

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{C} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{1}{f} &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;,

and the corresponding camera matrix now becomes

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{C} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{1}{f} &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \sim \begin{pmatrix} f &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; f &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

The last step is a consequence of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{C} &lt;/math&gt; itself being a projective element.

The camera matrix derived here may appear trivial in the sense that it contains very few non-zero elements. This depends to a large extent on the particular coordinate systems which have been chosen for the 3D and 2D points. In practice, however, other forms of camera matrices are common, as will be shown below.

== Camera position ==
The camera matrix &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{C} &lt;/math&gt; derived in the previous section has a [[null space]] which is spanned by the vector

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{n} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

This is also the homogeneous representation of the 3D point which has coordinates (0,0,0), that is, the "camera center" (aka the [[entrance pupil]]; the position of the pinhole of a [[pinhole camera]]) is at '''O'''.  This means that the camera center (and only this point) cannot be mapped to a point in the image plane by the camera (or equivalently, it maps to all points on the image as every ray on the image goes through this point).

For any other 3D point with &lt;math&gt;x_3 = 0&lt;/math&gt;, the result &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y} \sim\mathbf{C}\,\mathbf{x} &lt;/math&gt; is well-defined and has the form &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y} = (y_1\,y_2\,0)^\top &lt;/math&gt;.  This corresponds to a point at infinity in the [[projective plane|projective]] image plane (even though, if the image plane is taken to be a [[plane (geometry)|Euclidean plane]], no corresponding intersection point exists).

== Normalized camera matrix and normalized image coordinates ==
The camera matrix derived above can be simplified even further if we assume that ''f = 1'':

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{C}_{0} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} = \left ( \begin{array}{c|c} \mathbf{I} &amp; \mathbf{0} \end{array} \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{I} &lt;/math&gt; here denotes a &lt;math&gt; 3 \times 3 &lt;/math&gt; identity matrix. Note that &lt;math&gt; 3 \times 4 &lt;/math&gt; matrix &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{C} &lt;/math&gt; here is divided into a concatenation of a &lt;math&gt; 3 \times 3 &lt;/math&gt; matrix and a 3-dimensional vector. The camera matrix &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{C}_{0} &lt;/math&gt; is sometimes referred to as a ''canonical form''.

So far all points in the 3D world have been represented in a ''camera centered'' coordinate system, that is, a coordinate system which has its origin at the camera center (the location of the pinhole of a [[pinhole camera]]). In practice however, the 3D points may be represented in terms of coordinates relative to an arbitrary coordinate system (X1',X2',X3'). Assuming that the camera coordinate axes (X1,X2,X3) and the axes (X1',X2',X3') are of Euclidean type (orthogonal and isotropic), there is a unique Euclidean 3D transformation (rotation and translation) between the two coordinate systems. In other words, the camera is not necessarily at the origin looking along the ''z'' axis.

The two operations of rotation and translation of 3D coordinates can be represented as the two &lt;math&gt; 4 \times 4 &lt;/math&gt; matrices

: &lt;math&gt; \left ( \begin{array}{c|c} \mathbf{R} &amp; \mathbf{0} \\ \hline \mathbf{0} &amp; 1 \end{array} \right ) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \left ( \begin{array}{c|c} \mathbf{I} &amp; \mathbf{t} \\ \hline \mathbf{0} &amp; 1 \end{array} \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{R} &lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt; 3 \times 3 &lt;/math&gt; [[rotation matrix]] and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{t} &lt;/math&gt; is a 3-dimensional translation vector. When the first matrix is multiplied onto the homogeneous representation of a 3D point, the result is the homogeneous representation of the rotated point, and the second matrix performs instead a translation. Performing the two operations in sequence, i.e. first the rotation and then the translation (with translation vector given in the already rotated coordinate system), gives a combined rotation and translation matrix

: &lt;math&gt; \left ( \begin{array}{c|c} \mathbf{R} &amp; \mathbf{t} \\ \hline \mathbf{0} &amp; 1 \end{array} \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

Assuming that &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{R} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{t} &lt;/math&gt; are precisely the rotation and translations which relate the two coordinate system (X1,X2,X3) and (X1',X2',X3') above, this implies that

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x} = \left ( \begin{array}{c|c} \mathbf{R} &amp; \mathbf{t} \\ \hline \mathbf{0} &amp; 1 \end{array} \right ) \mathbf{x}' &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}' &lt;/math&gt; is the homogeneous representation of the point '''P''' in the coordinate system (X1',X2',X3').

Assuming also that the camera matrix is given by &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{C}_{0} &lt;/math&gt;, the mapping from the coordinates in the (X1',X2',X3') system to homogeneous image coordinates becomes

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y} \sim \mathbf{C}_{0} \, \mathbf{x} = \left ( \begin{array}{c|c} \mathbf{I} &amp; \mathbf{0} \end{array} \right ) \, \left ( \begin{array}{c|c} \mathbf{R} &amp; \mathbf{t} \\ \hline \mathbf{0} &amp; 1 \end{array} \right ) \mathbf{x}' = \left ( \begin{array}{c|c} \mathbf{R} &amp; \mathbf{t} \end{array} \right ) \, \mathbf{x}' &lt;/math&gt;

Consequently, the camera matrix which relates points in the coordinate system (X1',X2',X3') to image coordinates is

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{C}_{N} = \left ( \begin{array}{c|c} \mathbf{R} &amp; \mathbf{t} \end{array} \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

a concatenation of a 3D rotation matrix and a 3-dimensional translation vector.

This type of camera matrix is referred to as a ''normalized camera matrix'', it assumes focal length = 1 and that image coordinates are measured in a coordinate system where the origin is located at the intersection between axis X3 and the image plane and has the same units as the 3D coordinate system. The resulting image coordinates are referred to as ''normalized image coordinates''.

=== The camera position ===
Again, the null space of the normalized camera matrix, &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{C}_{N} &lt;/math&gt; described above, is spanned by the 4-dimensional vector

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{n} = \begin{pmatrix} -\mathbf{R}^{-1} \, \mathbf{t} \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}  = \begin{pmatrix} \tilde{\mathbf{n}} \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This is also, again, the coordinates of the camera center, now relative to the (X1',X2',X3') system. This can be seen by applying first the rotation and then the translation to the 3-dimensional vector &lt;math&gt; \tilde{\mathbf{n}} &lt;/math&gt; and the result is the homogeneous representation of 3D coordinates (0,0,0).

This implies that the camera center (in its homogeneous representation) lies in the null space of the camera matrix, provided that it is represented in terms of 3D coordinates relative to the same coordinate system as the camera matrix refers to.

The normalized camera matrix &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{C}_{N} &lt;/math&gt; can now be written as

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{C}_{N} = \mathbf{R} \, \left ( \begin{array}{c|c} \mathbf{I} &amp; \mathbf{R}^{-1} \, \mathbf{t} \end{array} \right ) = \mathbf{R} \, \left ( \begin{array}{c|c} \mathbf{I} &amp; -\tilde{\mathbf{n}} \end{array} \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \tilde{\mathbf{n}} &lt;/math&gt; is the 3D coordinates of the camera relative to the (X1',X2',X3') system.

== General camera matrix ==
Given the mapping produced by a normalized camera matrix, the resulting normalized image coordinates can be transformed by means of an arbitrary 2D [[homography (computer vision)|homography]]. This includes 2D translations and rotations as well as scaling (isotropic and anisotropic) but also general 2D perspective transformations. Such a transformation can be represented as a &lt;math&gt; 3 \times 3 &lt;/math&gt; matrix &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{H} &lt;/math&gt; which maps the homogeneous normalized image coordinates &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y} &lt;/math&gt; to the homogeneous transformed image coordinates &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y}' &lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y}' = \mathbf{H} \, \mathbf{y} &lt;/math&gt;

Inserting the above expression for the normalized image coordinates in terms of the 3D coordinates gives

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y}' = \mathbf{H} \, \mathbf{C}_{N} \, \mathbf{x}' &lt;/math&gt;

This produces the most general form of camera matrix

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{C} = \mathbf{H} \, \mathbf{C}_{N} = \mathbf{H} \, \left ( \begin{array}{c|c} \mathbf{R} &amp; \mathbf{t} \end{array} \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2116">A '''cross-sequential''' [[Research design|design]] is a [[research]] method that combines both a [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal]] design and a [[Cross-sectional study|cross-sectional]] design. It aims to correct for some of the problems inherent in the cross-sectional and longitudinal designs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webster.edu/~woolflm/methods/devresearchmethods.html Woolf, Linda M., "Developmental Research Methods" (undated), Webster.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121129041214/http://www2.webster.edu/~woolflm/methods/devresearchmethods.html |date=2012-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a cross-sequential design (also called an "accelerated longitudinal" or "convergence" design), a researcher wants to study development over some large period of time within the lifespan. Rather than studying particular individuals across that whole period of time (e.g. 20–60 years) as in a longitudinal design, or multiple individuals of different ages at one time (e.g. 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, and 60 years) as in a cross-sectional design, the researcher chooses a smaller time window (e.g. 20 years) to study multiple individuals of different starting ages. An example of a cross-sequential design is shown in the table below.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! cohort !!colspan="3" |  age 
|-
| A || 20 || 25 || 30
|-
| B || 25 || 30 || 35

|-

|-
| G || 50 || 55 || 60
|-
| year of measurement: || 2000 || 2005 || 2010
|}

In this table, over a span of 10 years, from 1990 to 2000, 7 overlapping cohorts with different starting ages could be studied to provide information on the whole span of development from ages 20 to 60.

This design has been used in studies to investigate career trajectories in academia&lt;ref&gt;[Beck, Karen, and Carlene Wilson. "Development of affective organizational commitment: A cross-sequential examination of change with tenure." Journal of Vocational Behavior 56.1 (2000): 114-136.]&lt;/ref&gt; and other phenomena.

The '''degree''' of a [[polynomial]] is the highest degree of its [[monomial]]s (individual terms) with non-zero coefficients. The [[degree of a monomial|degree of a term]] is the sum of the exponents of the [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] that appear in it, and thus is a non-negative integer. The term '''order''' has been used as a synonym of ''degree'' but, nowadays, may refer to several other concepts (see [[Order of a polynomial (disambiguation)|order of a polynomial]]).
For example, the polynomial &lt;math&gt;7x^2y^3 + 4x - 9,&lt;/math&gt; which can also be expressed as &lt;math&gt;7x^2y^3 + 4x^1y^0 - 9x^0y^0,&lt;/math&gt; has three terms. The first term has a degree of 5 (the sum of the [[exponentiation|powers]] 2 and 3), the second term has a degree of 1, and the last term has a degree of 0. Therefore, the polynomial has a degree of 5, which is the highest degree of any term.

To determine the degree of a polynomial that is not in standard form (for example:&lt;math&gt;(x+1)^2-(x-1)^2&lt;/math&gt;), one has to put it first in standard form by expanding the products (by [[distributivity]]) and combining the like terms; for example &lt;math&gt; (x+1)^2-(x-1)^2= 4x&lt;/math&gt; is of degree 1, even though each summand has degree 2. However, this is not needed when the polynomial is expressed as a product of polynomials in standard form, because the degree of a product is the sum of the degrees of the factors.

==Names of polynomials by degree==
{{wiktionary|Appendix:English polynomial degrees}}
The following names are assigned to polynomials according to their degree:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/56413.html | title=Names of Polynomials | date=November 25, 1997| accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mac Lane and Birkhoff (1999) define "linear", "quadratic", "cubic", "quartic", and "quintic". (p. 107)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;King (2009) defines "quadratic", "cubic", "quartic", "quintic", "sextic", "septic", and "octic".&lt;/ref&gt;
* Special case – [[Zero polynomial|zero]] (see [[#Degree of the zero polynomial|§ Degree of the zero polynomial]] below)
* Degree 0 – non-zero [[constant function|constant]]&lt;ref&gt;Shafarevich (2003) says of a polynomial of degree zero, &lt;math&gt;f(x)=a_0&lt;/math&gt;: "Such a polynomial is called a ''constant'' because if we substitute different values of ''x'' in it, we always obtain the same value &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt;." (p. 23)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Degree 1 – [[linear function|linear]]
* Degree 2 – [[quadratic polynomial|quadratic]]
* Degree 3 – [[cubic function|cubic]]
* Degree 4 – [[quartic function|quartic]] (or, if all terms have even degree, [[biquadratic function|biquadratic]])
* Degree 5 – [[quintic equation|quintic]]
* Degree 6 – [[sextic equation|sextic]] (or, less commonly, [[hexic equation|hexic]])
* Degree 7 – [[septic equation|septic]] (or, less commonly, [[heptic equation|heptic]])
For higher degrees, names have sometimes been proposed,&lt;ref&gt;[[James Cockle]] proposed the names "sexic", "septic", "octic", "nonic", and "decic" in 1851. ([https://books.google.com/books?id=cxIFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=sexic%20septic%20octic%20nonic%20decic&amp;f=false ''Mechanics Magazine'', Vol. LV, p. 171])&lt;/ref&gt; but they are rarely used:
* Degree 8 – [[octic equation|octic]]
* Degree 9 – nonic
* Degree 10 – decic

Names for degree above three are based on Latin [[ordinal number]]s, and end in ''-ic''. This should be distinguished from the names used for the number of variables, the [[arity]], which are based on Latin [[distributive number]]s, and end in ''-ary''. For example, a degree two polynomial in two variables, such as &lt;math&gt;x^2 + xy + y^2&lt;/math&gt;, is called a "binary quadratic": ''binary'' due to two variables, ''quadratic'' due to degree two.{{efn|For simplicity, this is a [[homogeneous polynomial]], with equal degree in both variables separately.}} There are also names for the number of terms, which are also based on Latin distributive numbers, ending in ''-nomial''; the common ones are ''[[monomial]]'', ''[[binomial (polynomial)|binomial]]'', and (less commonly) ''[[trinomial]]''; thus &lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2&lt;/math&gt; is a "binary quadratic binomial".

==Other examples==
*The polynomial &lt;math&gt;3 - 5 x + 2 x^5 - 7 x^9&lt;/math&gt; is a nonic polynomial
*The polynomial &lt;math&gt;(y - 3)(2y + 6)(-4y - 21)&lt;/math&gt; is a cubic polynomial
*The polynomial &lt;math&gt;(3 z^8 + z^5 - 4 z^2 + 6) + (-3 z^8 + 8 z^4 + 2 z^3 + 14 z)&lt;/math&gt; is a quintic polynomial (as the &lt;math&gt;z^8&lt;/math&gt; are cancelled out)

The canonical forms of the three examples above are:

*for &lt;math&gt;3 - 5 x + 2 x^5 - 7 x^9&lt;/math&gt;, after reordering, &lt;math&gt;- 7 x^9 + 2 x^5 - 5 x + 3&lt;/math&gt;;
*for &lt;math&gt;(y - 3)(2y + 6)(-4y - 21)&lt;/math&gt;, after multiplying out and collecting terms of the same degree, &lt;math&gt;- 8 y^3 - 42 y^2 + 72 y + 378&lt;/math&gt;;
*for &lt;math&gt;(3 z^8 + z^5 - 4 z^2 + 6) + (-3 z^8 + 8 z^4 + 2 z^3 + 14 z)&lt;/math&gt;, in which the two terms of degree 8 cancel, &lt;math&gt;z^5 + 8 z^4 + 2 z^3 - 4 z^2 + 14 z + 6&lt;/math&gt;.

==Behavior under polynomial operations==
The degree of the sum, the product or the composition of two polynomials is strongly related to the degree of the input polynomials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lang|first1=Sergei|title=Algebra|date=2005|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-95385-4|pages=100|edition=3rd|ref=lang}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Addition===
The degree of the sum (or difference) of two polynomials is less than or equal to the greater of their degrees; the equality always holds when the degrees of the polynomials are different i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;\deg(P + Q) \leq \max(\deg(P),\deg(Q))&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;\deg(P - Q) \leq \max(\deg(P),\deg(Q))&lt;/math&gt;.

E.g.

*The degree of &lt;math&gt;(x^3+x)+(x^2+1)=x^3+x^2+x+1&lt;/math&gt; is 3.   Note that 3&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;max(3,&amp;nbsp;2)
*The degree of &lt;math&gt;(x^3+x)-(x^3+x^2)=-x^2+x&lt;/math&gt; is 2.   Note that 2&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;max(3,&amp;nbsp;3)

===Scalar multiplication===

The degree of the product of a polynomial by a non-zero [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] is equal to the degree of the polynomial, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;\deg(cP)=\deg(P)&lt;/math&gt;.

E.g.

*The degree of &lt;math&gt;2(x^2+3x-2)=2x^2+6x-4&lt;/math&gt; is 2, just as the degree of &lt;math&gt;x^2+3x-2&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that for polynomials over a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] containing [[divisors of zero]], this is not necessarily true. For example, in [[Integers_modulo_n#Ring_of_congruence_classes|&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}/4\mathbf{Z}&lt;/math&gt;]], &lt;math&gt;\deg(1+2x) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;\deg(2(1+2x)) = \deg(2+4x) =\deg(2) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[Polynomial vector spaces|set of polynomials with coefficients from a given field F and degree smaller than or equal to a given number n]] thus forms a [[vector space]]. (Note, however, that this set is not a ring, as it is not closed under multiplication, as is seen below.)

===Multiplication===

The degree of the product of two polynomials over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] or an [[integral domain]] is the sum of their degrees
:&lt;math&gt;\deg(PQ) = \deg(P) + \deg(Q)&lt;/math&gt;.

E.g.
*The degree of &lt;math&gt;(x^3+x)(x^2+1)=x^5+2x^3+x&lt;/math&gt; is 3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5.

Note that for polynomials over an arbitrary ring, this is not necessarily true. For example, in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}/4\mathbf{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\deg(2x) + \deg(1+2x) = 1 + 1 = 2&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;\deg(2x(1+2x)) = \deg(2x) = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

===Composition===
The degree of the composition of two non-constant polynomials &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; over a field or [[integral domain]] is the product of their degrees:
:&lt;math&gt;\deg(P \circ Q) = \deg(P)\deg(Q)&lt;/math&gt;.

E.g.
*If &lt;math&gt;P = (x^3+x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Q = (x^2+1)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;P \circ Q = P \circ (x^2+1) = (x^2+1)^3+(x^2+1) = x^6+3x^4+4x^2+2&lt;/math&gt;, which has degree 6.

Note that for polynomials over an arbitrary ring, this is not necessarily true. For example, in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}/4\mathbf{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\deg(2x) \deg(1+2x) = 1\cdot 1 = 1&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;\deg(2x\circ(1+2x)) = \deg(2+4x)=\deg(2) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

==Degree of the zero polynomial==

The degree of the [[zero polynomial]] is either left undefined, or is defined to be negative (usually −1 or &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;
Shafarevich (2003) says of the zero polynomial: "In this case, we consider that the degree of the polynomial is undefined." (p. 27)&lt;br /&gt;
Childs (1995) uses −1. (p. 233)&lt;br /&gt;
Childs (2009) uses −∞ (p. 287), however he excludes zero polynomials in his Proposition 1 (p. 288) and then explains that the proposition holds for zero polynomials "with the reasonable assumption that &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; + ''m'' = &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; for ''m'' any integer or ''m'' = &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;".&lt;br /&gt;
Axler (1997) uses −∞. (p. 64)&lt;br /&gt;
Grillet (2007) says: "The degree of the zero polynomial 0 is sometimes left undefined or is variously defined as −1 ∈ ℤ or as &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;, as long as deg 0 &lt; deg A for all A ≠ 0." (A is a polynomial.) However, he excludes zero polynomials in his Proposition 5.3. (p. 121)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Like any constant value, the value 0 can be considered as a (constant) polynomial, called the zero polynomial. It has no nonzero terms, and so, strictly speaking, it has no degree either. As such, its degree is undefined. The propositions for the degree of sums and products of polynomials in the above section do not apply if any of the polynomials involved is the zero polynomial.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|author=Barile, Margherita|id=ZeroPolynomial|title=Zero Polynomial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is convenient, however, to define the degree of the zero polynomial to be ''negative infinity'', &lt;math&gt;-\infty,&lt;/math&gt; and introduce the arithmetic rules&lt;ref&gt;Axler (1997) gives these rules and says: "The 0 polynomial is declared to have degree &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; so that exceptions are not needed for various reasonable results." (p. 64)&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \max(a,-\infty) = a ,&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; a + (-\infty) = -\infty .&lt;/math&gt;

These examples illustrate how this extension satisfies the [[#Behavior under polynomial operations|behavior rules]] above:
*The degree of the sum &lt;math&gt;(x^3+x)+(0)=x^3+x&lt;/math&gt; is 3.  This satisfies the expected behavior, which is that &lt;math&gt;3 \le \max(3, -\infty)&lt;/math&gt;.
*The degree of the difference &lt;math&gt;(x)-(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;.  This satisfies the expected behavior, which is that &lt;math&gt;-\infty \le \max(1,1)&lt;/math&gt;.
*The degree of the product &lt;math&gt;(0)(x^2+1)=0&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;.  This satisfies the expected behavior, which is that &lt;math&gt;-\infty = -\infty + 2&lt;/math&gt;.

==Computed from the function values==
A number of formulae exist which will evaluate the degree of a polynomial function ''f''. One based on [[asymptotic analysis]] is
:&lt;math&gt;\deg f = \lim_{x\rarr\infty}\frac{\log |f(x)|}{\log x}&lt;/math&gt;;
this is the exact counterpart of the method of estimating the slope in a [[log–log plot]].

This formula generalizes the concept of degree to some functions that are not polynomials.
For example:
*The degree of the [[multiplicative inverse]], &lt;math&gt;\ 1/x&lt;/math&gt;, is &amp;minus;1.
*The degree of the [[square root]], &lt;math&gt;\sqrt x &lt;/math&gt;, is 1/2.
*The degree of the [[logarithm]], &lt;math&gt;\ \log x&lt;/math&gt;, is 0.
*The degree of the [[exponential function]], &lt;math&gt;\exp x&lt;/math&gt;, is &lt;math&gt;\infty.&lt;/math&gt;
Note that the formula also gives sensible results for many combinations of such functions, e.g., the degree of &lt;math&gt;\frac{1 + \sqrt{x}}{x}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;-1/2&lt;/math&gt;.

Another formula to compute the degree of ''f'' from its values is
:&lt;math&gt;\deg f = \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{x f'(x)}{f(x)}&lt;/math&gt;;
this second formula follows from applying [[L'Hôpital's rule]] to the first formula. Intuitively though, it is more about exhibiting the degree ''d'' as the extra constant factor in the derivative &lt;math&gt; d x^{d-1} &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; x^d &lt;/math&gt;.

A more fine grained (than a simple numeric degree) description of the asymptotics of a function can be had by using [[big O notation]]. In the [[analysis of algorithms]], it is for example often relevant to distinguish between the growth rates of &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; x \log x &lt;/math&gt;, which would both come out as having the ''same'' degree according to the above formulae.

==Extension to polynomials with two or more variables==
For polynomials in two or more variables, the degree of a term is the ''sum'' of the exponents of the variables in the term; the degree (sometimes called the '''total degree''') of the polynomial is again the maximum of the degrees of all terms in the polynomial. For example, the polynomial ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 3''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 4''y'' has degree 4, the same degree as the term ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

However, a polynomial in variables ''x'' and ''y'', is a polynomial in ''x'' with coefficients which are polynomials in ''y'', and also a polynomial in ''y'' with coefficients which are polynomials in ''x''. The polynomial
:&lt;math&gt;x^2y^2 + 3x^3 + 4y = (3)x^3 + (y^2)x^2 + (4y) =  (x^2)y^2 + (4)y  + (3x^3)&lt;/math&gt;
has degree 3 in ''x'' and degree 2 in ''y''.

==Degree function in abstract algebra==
Given a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] R, the [[polynomial ring]] R[''x''] is the set of all polynomials in ''x'' that have coefficients chosen from R. In the special case that R is also a [[field (mathematics)|field]], then the polynomial ring R[''x''] is a [[principal ideal domain]] and, more importantly to our discussion here, a [[Euclidean domain]].

It can be shown that the degree of a polynomial over a field satisfies all of the requirements of the ''norm'' function in the euclidean domain. That is, given two polynomials ''f''(''x'') and ''g''(''x''), the degree of the product ''f''(''x'')''g''(''x'') must be larger than both the degrees of ''f'' and ''g'' individually. In fact, something stronger holds:
: deg(''f''(''x'')''g''(''x'')) = deg(''f''(''x'')) + deg(''g''(''x''))

For an example of why the degree function may fail over a ring that is not a field, take the following example. Let R = &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, the ring of integers [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] 4. This ring is not a field (and is not even an [[integral domain]]) because 2 × 2 = 4 ≡ 0 (mod 4). Therefore, let ''f''(''x'') = ''g''(''x'') = 2''x'' + 1. Then, ''f''(''x'')''g''(''x'') = 4''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 4''x'' + 1 = 1. Thus deg(''f''⋅''g'') = 0 which is not greater than the degrees of ''f'' and ''g'' (which each had degree 1).

Since the ''norm'' function is not defined for the zero element of the ring, we consider the degree of the polynomial ''f''(''x'') = 0 to also be undefined so that it follows the rules of a norm in a euclidean domain.

In [[mathematics]], the idea of '''descent''' extends the intuitive idea of 'gluing' in [[topology]]. Since the [[quotient space (topology)|topologists' glue]] is the use of [[equivalence relation]]s on [[topological space]]s, the theory starts with some ideas on identification.
&lt;!--A sophisticated theory resulted. It was a tribute to the efforts to use [[category theory]] to get around the alleged 'brutality'{{clarify|date=April 2013}} of imposing equivalence relations within geometric categories. One outcome was the eventual definition adopted in [[topos theory]] of [[geometric morphism]], to get the correct notion of [[surjection|surjectivity]].--&gt;

==Descent of vector bundles==

The case of the construction of [[vector bundle]]s from data on a [[disjoint union]] of [[topological space]]s is a straightforward place to start.

Suppose ''X'' is a topological space covered by open sets ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. Let ''Y'' be the [[disjoint union]] of the ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', so that there is a natural mapping

:&lt;math&gt;p: Y \rightarrow X.&lt;/math&gt;

We think of ''Y'' as 'above' ''X'', with the ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' projection 'down' onto ''X''. With this language, ''descent'' implies a vector bundle on ''Y ''(so, a bundle given on each ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''), and our concern is to 'glue' those bundles ''V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', to make a single bundle ''V'' on X. What we mean is that ''V'' should, when restricted to ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', give back ''V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', [[up to]] a bundle isomorphism.

The data needed is then this: on each overlap

:&lt;math&gt;X_{ij},&lt;/math&gt;

intersection of ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, we'll require mappings

:&lt;math&gt;f_{ij}: V_i \rightarrow V_j&lt;/math&gt;

to use to identify ''V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''V&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' there, fiber by fiber. Further the ''f&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' must satisfy conditions based on the reflexive, symmetric and transitive properties of an equivalence relation (gluing conditions). For example, the composition

:&lt;math&gt;f_{jk} \circ f_{ij} = f_{ik}&lt;/math&gt;

for transitivity (and choosing apt notation). The ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ii''&lt;/sub&gt; should be identity maps and hence symmetry becomes &lt;math&gt;f_{ij}=f^{-1}_{ji}&lt;/math&gt; (so that it is fiberwise an isomorphism).

These are indeed standard conditions in [[fiber bundle]] theory (see [[transition map]]). One important application to note is ''change of fiber'': if the ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; are all you need to make a bundle, then there are many ways to make an [[associated bundle]]. That is, we can take essentially same ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;, acting on various fibers.

Another major point is the relation with the [[chain rule]]: the discussion of the way there of constructing [[tensor field]]s can be summed up as 'once you learn to descend the [[tangent bundle]], for which transitivity is the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] chain rule, the rest is just 'naturality of tensor constructions'.

To move closer towards the abstract theory we need to interpret the disjoint union of the

:&lt;math&gt;X_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

now as

:&lt;math&gt;Y \times_X Y,&lt;/math&gt;

the [[fiber product]] (here an [[Equaliser (mathematics)|equalizer]]) of two copies of the projection p. The bundles on the ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; that we must control are ''V''&amp;prime; and ''V''", the pullbacks to the fiber of ''V'' via the two different projection maps to ''X''.

Therefore, by going to a more abstract level one can eliminate the combinatorial side (that is, leave out the indices) and get something that makes sense for ''p'' not of the special form of covering with which we began. This then allows a [[category theory]] approach: what remains to do is to re-express the gluing conditions.

==History==

The ideas were developed in the period 1955–1965 (which was roughly the time at which the requirements of [[algebraic topology]] were met but those of [[algebraic geometry]] were not). From the point of view of abstract [[category theory]] the work of [[comonad]]s of Beck was a summation of those ideas; see [[Beck's monadicity theorem]].

The difficulties of algebraic geometry with passage to the quotient are acute. The urgency (to put it that way) of the problem for the geometers accounts for the title of the 1959 [[Alexander Grothendieck|Grothendieck]] seminar ''TDTE'' on ''theorems of descent and techniques of existence'' (see [[Fondements de la Géometrie Algébrique|FGA]]) connecting the descent question with the [[representable functor]] question in algebraic geometry in general, and the [[moduli problem]] in particular.

== Fully faithful descent ==
Let &lt;math&gt;p:X' \to X&lt;/math&gt;. Each sheaf ''F'' on ''X'' gives rise to a descent data:
:&lt;math&gt;(F' = p^* F, \alpha: p_0^* F' \simeq p_1^* F'), \, p_i: X'' = X' \times_X X' \to X'&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the cocycle condition:
:&lt;math&gt;p_{02}^* \alpha = p_{12}^* \alpha \circ p_{01}^* \alpha, \, p_{ij}: X'' \times_{X'} X'' \times_{X'} X'' \to X'' \times_{X'} X''&lt;/math&gt;.

The fully faithful descent says: &lt;math&gt;F \mapsto (F', \alpha)&lt;/math&gt; is fully faithful. The descent theory tells conditions for which there is a fully faithful descent.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3848">In [[mathematics]], the '''Fibonomial coefficients''' or '''Fibonacci-binomial coefficients''' are defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{k}_F = \frac{F_nF_{n-1}\cdots F_{n-k+1}}{F_kF_{k-1}\cdots F_1} = \frac{n!_F}{k!_F (n-k)!_F}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' and ''k'' are non-negative integers, 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n'', ''F&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the ''j''-th [[Fibonacci number]] and ''n''!&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''n''th [[Fibonorial]], where 0!&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;, being the [[empty product]], evaluates to&amp;nbsp;1.

==Special values==
The Fibonomial coefficients are all integers. Some special values are:

:&lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{0}_F = \binom{n}{n}_F = 1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{1}_F = \binom{n}{n-1}_F = F_n&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{2}_F = \binom{n}{n-2}_F = \frac{F_n F_{n-1}}{F_2 F_1} = F_n F_{n-1},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{3}_F = \binom{n}{n-3}_F = \frac{F_n F_{n-1} F_{n-2}}{F_3 F_2 F_1} = F_n F_{n-1} F_{n-2} /2,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{k}_F = \binom{n}{n-k}_F.&lt;/math&gt;

==Fibonomial triangle==
The Fibonomial coefficients {{OEIS|id=A010048}} are similar to [[binomial coefficient]]s and can be displayed in a triangle similar to [[Pascal's triangle]]. The first eight rows are shown below.

The recurrence relation

:&lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{k}_F = F_{n-k+1} \binom{n-1}{k-1}_F  + F_{k-1} \binom{n-1}{k}_F &lt;/math&gt;

implies that the Fibonomial coefficients are always integers.

The fibonomial coefficients can be expressed in terms of the [[Gaussian binomial coefficient|Gaussian binomial coefficients]] and the [[golden ratio]] &lt;math&gt;\phi=\frac{1+\sqrt5}2&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;{\binom n k}_F = \phi^{k\,(n-k)}{\binom n k}_{-1/\phi^2}&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==
Examples of function series include [[power series]], [[Laurent series]], [[Fourier series]], etc.

==Convergence==
As for sequences of functions, and unlike for series of numbers, there exist many types of [[convergence (mathematics)|convergence]] for a function series, such as [[uniform convergence]], [[pointwise convergence]], [[almost everywhere]] convergence, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3079">In algebra, a '''generating set''' ''G'' of a [[module (mathematics)|module]] ''M'' over a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] ''R'' is a subset of ''M'' such that the smallest submodule of ''M'' containing ''G'' is ''M'' itself (the smallest submodule containing a subset is the intersection of all submodules containing the set). The set ''G'' is then said to generate ''M''. For example, the ring ''R'' is generated by the identity element 1 as a left ''R''-module over itself. If there is a finite generating set, then a module is said to be [[finitely generated module|finitely generated]].

Explicitly, if ''G'' is a generating set of a module ''M'', then every element of ''M'' is a (finite) ''R''-linear combination of some elements of ''G''; i.e., for each ''x'' in ''M'', there are ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''R'' and ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''G'' such that

: &lt;math&gt; x = r_1 g_1 + \cdots + r_m g_m. &lt;/math&gt;

Put in another way, there is a surjection

: &lt;math&gt; \bigoplus_{g \in G} R \to M, \, r_g \mapsto r_g g.&lt;/math&gt;

where we wrote ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt; for an element in the ''g''-th component of the direct sum. (Coincidentally, since a generating set always exists; for example, ''M'' itself, this shows that a module is a quotient of a free module, a useful fact.)

A generating set of a module is said to be '''minimal''' if no proper subset of the set generates the module. If ''R'' is a [[field (mathematics)|field]], then it is the same thing as a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]]. Unless the module is [[finitely-generated module|finitely-generated]], there may exist no minimal generating set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathoverflow.net/questions/33540/existence-of-a-minimal-generating-set-of-a-module|title=ac.commutative algebra – Existence of a minimal generating set of a module – MathOverflow|work=mathoverflow.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cardinality of a minimal generating set need not be an invariant of the module; '''Z''' is generated as a principal ideal by 1, but it is also generated by, say, a minimal generating set {{nowrap|{ 2, 3 }}}. What is uniquely determined by a module is the [[infimum]] of the numbers of the generators of the module.

Let ''R'' be a local ring with maximal ideal ''m'' and residue field ''k'' and ''M'' finitely generated module. Then [[Nakayama's lemma]] says that ''M'' has a minimal generating set whose cardinality is &lt;math&gt;\dim_k M / mM = \dim_k M \otimes_R k&lt;/math&gt;. If ''M'' is flat, then this minimal generating set is [[linearly independent]] (so ''M'' is free). See also: [[minimal resolution (algebra)|minimal resolution]].

A more refined information is obtained if one considers the relations between the generators; cf. [[free presentation of a module]].

'''GraphCrunch''' is a comprehensive, parallelizable, and easily extendible [[Open-source software|open source]] software tool for analyzing and modeling large [[Network biology|biological networks]] (or [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]]); it compares real-world networks against a series of [[Random graph|random graph models]] with respect to a multitude of local and global network properties.&lt;ref&gt;Tijana Milenković, Jason Lai, and Nataša Pržulj, GraphCrunch: a tool for large network analyses, BMC Bioinformatics 2008, 9:70. Highly accessed.&lt;/ref&gt; It is available at [http://bio-nets.doc.ic.ac.uk/graphcrunch2/ http://bio-nets.doc.ic.ac.uk/graphcrunch2/].

==Motivation==
Recent technological advances in experimental biology have yielded large amounts of biological network data. Many other real-world phenomena have also been described in terms of large networks (also called graphs), such as various types of social and technological networks. Thus, understanding these complex phenomena has become an important scientific problem that has led to intensive research in network modeling and analyses.

An important step towards understanding biological networks is finding an adequate network model. Evaluating the fit of a model network to the data is a formidable challenge, since network comparisons are computationally infeasible and thus have to rely on heuristics, or "network properties." GraphCrunch automates the process of generating random networks drawn from a series of random graph models and evaluating the fit of the network models to a real-world network with respect to a variety of global and local network properties.

==Features==
GraphCrunch performs the following tasks: &lt;br /&gt;
1) computes user specified global and local properties of an input real-world network, &lt;br /&gt;
2) creates a user specified number of random networks belonging to user specified random graph models, &lt;br /&gt;
3) compares how closely each model network reproduces a range of global and local properties (specified in point 1 above) of the real-world network, and &lt;br /&gt;
4) produces the statistics of network property similarities between the data and the model networks.

==Network models supported by GraphCrunch==
GraphCrunch currently supports five different types of random graph models:
# [[Erdős–Rényi model|Erdös-Rényi random graphs]];
# random graphs with the same degree distribution as the data;
# [[Barabási–Albert model|Barabási-Albert preferential-attachment scale-free networks]];
# ''n''-dimensional [[Random geometric graph|geometric random graphs]] (for all positive integers ''n''); and
# stickiness model networks.

==Network properties supported by GraphCrunch==
GraphCrunch currently supports seven global and local network properties:
# [[degree distribution]];
# [[clustering coefficient]];
# clustering spectrum;
# [[Average path length|average diameter]];
# spectrum of shortest path lengths;
# [[Graphlets#Relative graphlet frequency distance|relative graphlet frequency distance]]; and 
# [[Graphlets#Graphlet degree distribution agreement|graphlet degree distribution agreement]].

==Installation and usage==
Instructions on how to install and run GraphCrunch are available at [http://www.ics.uci.edu/~bio-nets/graphcrunch/ http://www.ics.uci.edu/~bio-nets/graphcrunch/].

==Applications==
GraphCrunch has been used to find an optimal network model for protein-protein interaction networks,&lt;ref&gt;Oleksii Kuchaiev, Tijana Milenković, Vesna Memisević, Wayne Hayes, and Nataša Pržulj, Topological network alignment uncovers biological function and phylogeny, Journal of the Royal Society Interface, 2010, to appear.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Memisevic2010"&gt;Vesna Memisević, Tijana Milenković, and Nataša Pržulj, An integrative approach to modeling biological networks, Proceedings of the 6th International Symposium on Integrative Bioinformatics, 22–24 March 2010, Cambridge, United Kingdom. Journal of Integrative Bioinformatics, 2010, to appear.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for protein structure networks.&lt;ref name="Memisevic2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tijana Milenković, Ioannis Filippis, Michael Lappe, and Nataša Pržulj, Optimized Null Model for Protein Structure Networks, 2009, PLoS ONE 4(6): e5967.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the '''half-period ratio''' &amp;tau; of an [[elliptic function]] ''j'' is the ratio

:&lt;math&gt;\tau = \frac{\omega_2}{\omega_1}&lt;/math&gt;

of the two [[fundamental pair of periods|half-periods]] &lt;math&gt;\frac{\omega_1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\omega_2}{2}&lt;/math&gt; of ''j'', where ''j'' is defined in such a way that

:&lt;math&gt;\Im(\tau) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
is in the [[upper half-plane]].

Quite often in the literature, &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are defined to be the '''periods''' of an elliptic function rather than its half-periods. Regardless of the choice of notation, the ratio ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of periods is identical to the ratio (ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/2)/(ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/2) of half-periods. Hence the '''period ratio''' is the same as the "half-period ratio".

Note that the half-period ratio can be thought of as a simple number, namely, one of the parameters to elliptic functions, or it can be thought of as a function itself, because the half periods can be given in terms of the [[elliptic modulus]] or in terms of the [[nome (mathematics)|nome]].

See the pages on [[quarter period]] and [[elliptic integrals]] for additional definitions and relations on the arguments and parameters to elliptic functions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2395">[[File:Hjelmslev's theorem.svg|thumb|300px|The triples of red points on the two black lines have the same distances within each triple, so by Hjelmslev's theorem the three midpoints of corresponding pairs of points are on a single (green) line.]]
In [[geometry]], '''Hjelmslev's theorem''', named after [[Johannes Hjelmslev]], is the statement that if points P, Q, R... on a line are [[Isometry|isometrically]] mapped to points P´, Q´, R´... of another line in the same plane, then the midpoints of the segments PP`, QQ´, RR´... also lie on a line.

The proof is easy if one assumes the classification of [[Euclidean plane isometry|plane isometries]]. If the given isometry is odd, in which case it is necessarily either a reflection in a line or a glide-reflection (the product of three reflections in a line and two perpendiculars to it), then the statement is true of any points in the plane whatsoever: the midpoint of PP´ lies upon the axis of the (glide-)reflection for any P. If the isometry is even, compose it with reflection in line PQR to obtain an odd isometry with the same effect on P, Q, R... and apply the previous remark.

The importance of the theorem lies in the fact that it has a different proof that does ''not'' presuppose the [[parallel postulate]] and is therefore valid in [[non-Euclidean geometry]] as well. By its help, the mapping that maps every point P of the plane to the midpoint of the segment P´P´´, where P´and P´´ are the images of P under a [[rotation]] (in either sense) by a given acute angle about a given center, is seen to be a collineation mapping the whole [[Hyperbolic space|hyperbolic plane]] in a 1-1 way onto the inside of a disk, thus providing a good intuitive notion of the linear structure of the hyperbolic plane. In fact, this is called the [[Hjelmslev transformation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2089">'''Index arbitrage''' is a subset of [[statistical arbitrage]] focusing on index components.

The idea is that an index (such as [[S&amp;P 500]] or [[Russell 2000]]) is made up of several components (in the example, 500 large US stocks picked by S&amp;P to represent the US market) that influence the index price in a different manner.

For instance, there are leaders (components that react first to [[market impact]]) and laggers (the opposite). As the index is the weighted sum of all components, identifying leaders and laggers can provide a [[proprietary trader]] with the opportunity to take positions in these and make money if he/she believes the laggers will eventually rally on the leaders. The challenge being of course to correctly identify these, and to have the technology to act in the marketplace before the price correction takes place.

Traders buying into stocks in advance of their joining an index and increasing weight will profit from the rise in demand for the stock when the change takes place.  This effect is largely due to the popularity of [[index tracker]] funds which buy automatically on these events.   The arbitrage opportunity is thus a zero-sum transfer of wealth from passive index investors to arbitrageurs. As index arbitrage becomes more common, and when reweightings occur more frequently, the loss to tracker investors increases. The presence of index arbitrageurs is an argument for [[active investment]] which is less vulnerable to this exploitation (but however incurs higher management fees) or for simple [[buy and hold]] strategies.

Other types of index arbitrage include [[basis trading]], the arbitrage between a current index value ([[synthetic replication|synthetically replicated]]) and that of its future.

The '''Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications''' ('''ICA''') is an international scientific organization formed in 1990 to increase the visibility and influence of the [[Combinatorics|combinatorial community]]. In pursuit of this goal, the ICA sponsors  conferences, publishes a bulletin and awards a number of medals, including the Euler, Hall, Kirkman, and Stanton Medels. It is based in [[Boca Raton, Florida]] and its operation office is housed at [[Florida Atlantic University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fau.edu/budget/files/2018-19-operating-budget.pdf 2018-19 Operating Budget] Florida Atlantic University&lt;/ref&gt;
The institute was minimally active between 2010 and 2016 and resumed its full activities in March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://combinatoricsinstitute.blogspot.cz/2016/03/minutes-of-march-9-2016-meeting.html|title=The ICA blog: Minutes of the March 9, 2016 meeting |accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
The ICA has over 800 members in over forty countries.&lt;ref name=factsheet&gt;{{citation|title=A Few Facts About the ICA|journal=Bulletin of the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications|volume=72|year=2014|issn=1183-1278|place=Winnipeg|pages=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership is at three levels. ''Members'' are those who have not yet completed a [[Ph.D]]. ''Associate Fellows'' are younger members who have received the Ph.D. or have published extensively; normally an Associate Fellow should hold the rank of [[Assistant Professor]]. ''Fellows'' are expected to be established scholars and typically have the rank of [[Associate Professor]] or higher.
Some members are involved in highly theoretical research; there are members whose primary interest lies in education and instruction; and there are members who are heavily involved in the applications of [[combinatorics]] in statistical design, [[communication]]s theory, [[cryptography]], [[computer security]], and other practical areas.

Although being a fellow of the ICA is not itself a highly selective honor, the ICA also maintains another class of members, "honorary fellows", people who have made "pre-eminent contributions to combinatorics or its applications". The number of living honorary fellows is limited to ten at any time. The deceased honorary fellows include 
[[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|H. S. M. Coxeter]], [[Paul Erdős]], [[Haim Hanani]], [[Bernhard Neumann]], [[Derrick Henry Lehmer|D. H. Lehmer]],
[[Leonard Carlitz]], [[Robert Frucht]], [[E. M. Wright]], and [[Horst Sachs]].
Living honorary fellows include
[[Sharadchandra Shankar Shrikhande|S. S. Shrikhande]], [[C. R. Rao]], [[Gustavus Simmons|G. J. Simmons]], [[Vera T. Sós|Vera Sós]], [[Henry W. Gould|Henry Gould]], and Neil Robertson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://luca-giuzzi.unibs.it/ICA/honorary.php|title=Honorary Fellows of the ICA|publisher=Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications|accessdate=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==

The ICA publishes the ''Bulletin of the ICA'' ({{ISSN|1183-1278}}), a journal that combines publication of survey and research papers with news of members and accounts of future and past conferences. It appears three times a year, in January, May and September and usually consists of 128 pages.&lt;ref name=factsheet /&gt;

Beginning in 2017, the research articles in the ''Bulletin'' have been made available on an [[open access]] basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://luca-giuzzi.unibs.it/ICA/Issues/|title=Refereed reprints from the ''Bulletin of the ICA''|publisher=Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications|accessdate=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medals==

The ICA awards the Euler Medals annually for distinguished career contributions to combinatorics by a member of the institute who is still active in research. It is named after the 18th century mathematician [[Leonhard Euler]].

The ICA awards the Hall Medals, named after [[Marshall Hall (mathematician)|Marshall Hall, Jr.]], to recognize outstanding achievements by members who are not over age 40.

The ICA awards the Kirkman Medals, named after [[Thomas Kirkman]], to recognize outstanding achievements by members who are within four years past their Ph.D.

The winners of the medals for the years between 2010 and 2015 were decided by the ICA Medals Committee between November 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://combinatoricsinstitute.blogspot.com/2016/11/2009-2010-medal-winners.html|title=The ICA blog: 2009–2010 Medal Winners |accessdate=April 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and February 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://combinatoricsinstitute.blogspot.com/2017/02/medals-updates.html|title=The ICA blog: Medals update |accessdate=April 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the ICA resumed its activities in 2016.

In 2016, the ICA voted to institute an ICA medal to be known as the Stanton Medal, named after [[Ralph Stanton]], in recognition of substantial and sustained contributions, other than research, to promoting the discipline of combinatorics. The Stanton Medal honours significant lifetime contributions to promoting the discipline of combinatorics through advocacy, outreach, service, teaching and/or mentoring. At most one medal per year is to be awarded, typically to a Fellow of the ICA.

In [[mathematics]], the '''intersection''' of two or more objects is another, usually "smaller" object. All objects are presumed to lie in a certain common [[space (mathematics)|space]] except in [[set theory]], where the intersection of arbitrary sets is defined. The intersection is one of basic concepts of [[geometry]]. Intuitively, the intersection of two or more [[mathematical object|objects]] is a new object that lies in each of original objects. An intersection can have various [[geometric shape]]s, but a [[point (geometry)|point]] is the most common in a &lt;!-- indefinite article: there are different “plane geometries” --&gt;[[plane geometry]].

Definitions vary in different contexts: set theory formalizes the idea that a smaller object lies in a larger object with [[inclusion (set theory)|inclusion]], and the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection of sets]] is formed of [[element (set theory)|elements]] that belong to all intersecting sets. It is always [[well-definition|defined]], but may be [[empty set|empty]]. [[Incidence geometry]] defines an &lt;!-- yes, must be indefinite article --&gt;intersection (usually, of [[flat (geometry)|flats]]) as an object of lower [[dimension (mathematics)|dimension]] that is [[incidence (geometry)|incident]] to each of original objects. In this approach an intersection can be sometimes undefined, such as for [[parallel lines]]. In both cases the concept of intersection relies on [[logical conjunction]].

[[Algebraic geometry]] defines intersections in its own way with [[intersection theory]].
&lt;!-- In set theory, there are also intersections of [[class (mathematics)|classes]] blah-blah-blah not sure it’s very topical --Incnis Mrsi --&gt;

==Uniqueness==
There can be more than one primitive object, such as points (pictured above), that form an intersection. The intersection can be viewed collectively as all of the shared objects (i.e., the intersection [[operation (mathematics)|operation]] results in a [[set (mathematics)|set]], possibly empty), or as [[multivalued function|several intersection objects]] ([[partial function|possibly zero]]).

== Intersection of two sets ==
{{Main|Intersection (set theory)}}

The intersection of two sets ''A'' and ''B'' is the set of elements which are in both ''A'' and ''B''.  In symbols,

:&lt;math&gt;A  \cap B = \{ x: x \in A \text{  and  } x \in B\}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LBvpfEMhurwC|title=Basic Set Theory|last=Vereshchagin|first=Nikolai Konstantinovich|last2=Shen|first2=Alexander|date=2002-01-01|publisher=American Mathematical Soc.|isbn=9780821827314|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if ''A'' = {1, 3, 5, 7} and ''B'' = {1, 2, 4, 6} then ''A'' ∩ ''B'' = {1}.  A more elaborate example (involving infinite sets) is:
: ''A'' = {''x'' is an even [[integer]]}
: ''B'' = {''x'' is an integer divisible by 3}
: &lt;math&gt;A \cap B = \{6, 12, 18, \dots\}&lt;/math&gt;

As another example, the number 9 is ''not'' contained in the intersection of the set of [[prime number]]s {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, …} and the set of [[even number]]s {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, …}, because 9 is neither prime nor even.

In [[actuarial science]] and [[demography]], a '''life table''' (also called a '''mortality table''' or '''actuarial table''') is a table which shows, for each age, what the probability is that a person of that age will die before his or her next birthday ("[[probability of death]]"). In other words, it represents the [[survival function|survivorship]] of people from a certain population.&lt;ref name=Cohort&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harper|first1=Begon|title=Cohort Life Tables|url=http://www.tiem.utk.edu/~gross/bioed/bealsmodules/lifetables.html|website=Tiem|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can also be explained as a long-term mathematical way to measure a population's longevity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sociologydiscussion.com/demography/population-growth/life-table-meaning-types-and-importance/3030|title=Life Table: Meaning, Types and Importance|date=2016-07-21|work=Sociology Discussion - Discuss Anything About Sociology|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tables have been created by demographers including Graunt, Reed and Merrell, Keyfitz, and Greville.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are two types of life tables used in actuarial science. The period life table represents mortality rates during a specific time period of a certain population. A cohort life table, often referred to as a generation life table, is used to represent the overall mortality rates of a certain population's entire lifetime. They must have had to be born during the same specific time interval. A [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]] life table is more frequently used because it is able to make a prediction of any expected changes in mortality rates of a population in the future. This type of table also analyzes patterns in mortality rates that can be observed over time.&lt;ref name=SS /&gt; Both of these types of life tables are created based on an actual population from the present, as well as an educated prediction of the experience of a population in the near future.&lt;ref name=SS&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bell|first1=Felicitie|title=LIFE TABLES FOR THE UNITED STATES SOCIAL SECURITY AREA 1900–2100|url=http://www.ssa.gov/oact/NOTES/as120/LifeTables_Body.html|website=Social Security|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to find the true life expectancy average, 100 years would need to pass and by then finding that data would be of no use as healthcare is continually advancing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Silcocks|first=P. B. S.|last2=Jenner|first2=D. A.|last3=Reza|first3=R.|date=2001-01-01|title=Life expectancy as a summary of mortality in a population: statistical considerations and suitability for use by health authorities|url=http://jech.bmj.com/content/55/1/38|journal=Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health|language=en|volume=55|issue=1|pages=38–43|doi=10.1136/jech.55.1.38|issn=0143-005X|pmid=11112949|pmc=1731769}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other life tables in historical demography may be based on historical records, although these often undercount infants and understate infant mortality, on comparison with other regions with better records, and on mathematical adjustments for varying mortality levels and life expectancies at birth.&lt;ref&gt;Saskia Hin, ''The Demography of Roman Italy'', Cambridge University Press, 2013, pp. 104–118.&lt;/ref&gt; 

From this starting point, a number of inferences can be derived.

*The [[probability]] of surviving any particular year of age
*The remaining [[life expectancy]] for people at different ages

Life tables are also used extensively in [[biology]] and [[epidemiology]]. An area that uses this tool is Social Security. It examines the mortality rates of all the people who have Social Security to decide which actions to take.&lt;ref name=SS&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bell|first1=Felicitie|title=LIFE TABLES FOR THE UNITED STATES SOCIAL SECURITY AREA 1900–2100|url=http://www.ssa.gov/oact/NOTES/as120/LifeTables_Body.html|website=Social Security|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept is also of importance in [[product life cycle management]].

==Background==
There are two types of life tables:
* '''''Period'' or ''static'' life tables''' show the current probability of death (for people of different ages, in the current year)
* '''''Cohort'' life tables''' show the probability of death of people from a given cohort (especially birth year) over the course of their lifetime.

Static life tables [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] individuals assuming a stationary population with overlapping generations.  "Static life tables" and "cohort life tables" will be identical if population is in [[:wikt:equilibrium|equilibrium]] and environment does not change. If a population were to have a constant number of people each year, it would mean that the probabilities of death from the life table were completely accurate. Also, an exact number of 100,000 people were born each year with no [[immigration]] or [[emigration]] involved. &lt;ref name=SS&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bell|first1=Felicitie|title=LIFE TABLES FOR THE UNITED STATES SOCIAL SECURITY AREA 1900–2100|url=http://www.ssa.gov/oact/NOTES/as120/LifeTables_Body.html|website=Social Security|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"Life table" primarily refers to ''period'' life tables, as cohort life tables can only be constructed using data up to the current point, and distant projections for future mortality.

Life tables can be constructed using projections of future mortality rates, but more often they are a snapshot of age-specific mortality rates in the recent past, and do not necessarily purport to be projections. For these reasons, the older ages represented in a life table may have a greater chance of not being representative of what lives at these ages may experience in future, as it is predicated on current advances in medicine, [[public health]], and safety standards that did not exist in the early years of this cohort. A life table is created by mortality rates and census figures from a certain population, ideally under a closed demographic system. This means that immigration and emigration do not exist when analyzing a cohort. A closed demographic system assumes that migration flows are random and not significant, and that immigrants from other populations have the same risk of death as an individual from the new population.
Another benefit from mortality tables is that they can be used to make predictions on demographics or different populations.&lt;ref name=Upcommons&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pavía|first1=Jose|title=Introducing Migratory Flows in Life Table Construction|url=http://upcommons.upc.edu/revistes/bitstream/2099/13278/1/36.1.5.pavia-etal.pdf|website=Upcommons|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are also weaknesses of the information displayed on life tables. One being that they do not state the overall health of the population. There is more than one disease present in the world, and a person can have more than one disease at different stages simultaneously, introducing the term [[comorbidity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barendregt|first=Jan J|date=September 2009|title=Coping with multiple morbidity in a life table|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/08898489809525445|journal=An International Journal of Mathematical Demography|volume=7|pages=29-49|via=Auraria Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, life tables also do not show the direct correlation of mortality and morbidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.healthknowledge.org.uk/public-health-textbook/health-information/3a-populations/life-tables-demographic-applications|title=Life-tables and their demographic applications|last=admin|date=2010-06-28|work=Health Knowledge|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The life table observes the mortality experience of a single generation, consisting of 100,000 births, at every age number they can live through.&lt;ref name=SS&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bell|first1=Felicitie|title=LIFE TABLES FOR THE UNITED STATES SOCIAL SECURITY AREA 1900–2100|url=http://www.ssa.gov/oact/NOTES/as120/LifeTables_Body.html|website=Social Security|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life tables are usually constructed separately for men and for women because of their substantially different [[mortality rate]]s. Other characteristics can also be used to distinguish different risks, such as [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] status, occupation, and socioeconomic class.

Life tables can be extended to include other information in addition to mortality, for instance health information to calculate health expectancy. Health expectancies such as [[disability-adjusted life year]] and [[Healthy Life Years]] are the remaining number of years a person can expect to live in a specific health state, such as free of [[disability]]. Two types of life tables are used to divide the life expectancy into life spent in various states:

* '''Multi-state life tables''' (also known as increment-decrements life tables) are based on transition rates in and out of the different states and to death
* '''Prevalence-based life tables''' (also known as the Sullivan method) are based on external information on the proportion in each state. Life tables can also be extended to show life expectancies in different [[labor force]] states or [[marital status]] states.

Life tables that relate to maternal deaths and infant moralities are important, as they help form family planning programs that work with particular populations. They also help compare a country's average life expectancy with other countries.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sociologydiscussion.com/demography/population-growth/life-table-meaning-types-and-importance/3030|title=Life Table: Meaning, Types and Importance|date=2016-07-21|work=Sociology Discussion - Discuss Anything About Sociology|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing life expectancy globally helps countries understand why one country's life expectancy is rising substantially by looking at each other's healthcare, and adopting ideas to their own systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy|title=Life Expectancy|website=Our World in Data|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insurance applications==

In order to price [[insurance]] products, and ensure the solvency of insurance companies through adequate reserves, actuaries must develop projections of future insured events (such as death, sickness, and disability). To do this, actuaries develop mathematical models of the rates and timing of the events. They do this by studying the incidence of these events in the recent past, and sometimes developing expectations of how these past events will change over time (for example, whether the progressive reductions in mortality rates in the past will continue) and deriving expected rates of such events in the future, usually based on the age or other relevant characteristics of the population. An actuary's job is to form a comparison between people at risk of death and people who actually died to come up with a probability of death for a person at each age number, defined as qx in an equation.&lt;ref name=Upcommons /&gt; When analyzing a population, one of the main sources used to gather the required information is insurance by obtaining individual records that belong to a specific population.&lt;ref name=Upcommons&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pavía|first1=Jose|title=Introducing Migratory Flows in Life Table Construction|url=http://upcommons.upc.edu/revistes/bitstream/2099/13278/1/36.1.5.pavia-etal.pdf|website=Upcommons|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These are called mortality tables if they show death rates, and morbidity tables if they show various types of sickness or disability rates.

The availability of computers and the proliferation of data gathering about individuals has made possible calculations that are more voluminous and intensive than those used in the past (i.e. they crunch more numbers) and it is more common to attempt to provide different tables for different uses, and to factor in a range of non-traditional behaviors (e.g. gambling, debt load) into specialized calculations utilized by some institutions for evaluating risk. This is particularly the case in non-life insurance (e.g. the pricing of motor insurance can allow for a large number of risk factors, which requires a correspondingly complex table of expected claim rates). However the expression "life table" normally refers to human survival rates and is not relevant to non-life insurance.

==The mathematics==
[[File:Data from National Vital Statistics Report tPx.png|thumb|right|&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; chart from Table 1. Life table for the total population: United States, 2003, Page 8]]
The basic algebra used in life tables is as follows.

* &lt;math&gt;\,q_x&lt;/math&gt;''':'''  the probability that someone aged exactly &lt;math&gt;\,x&lt;/math&gt; will die before reaching age &lt;math&gt;\,(x+1)&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\,p_x&lt;/math&gt;''':'''  the probability that someone aged exactly &lt;math&gt;\,x&lt;/math&gt; will survive to age &lt;math&gt;\,(x+1)&lt;/math&gt;.

:: &lt;math&gt;\,p_x = 1-q_x&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\,\ell_x&lt;/math&gt;''':'''  the number of people who survive to age &lt;math&gt;\,x&lt;/math&gt;

:: note that this is based on a [[radix]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Period Abridged Life Tables |publisher=avon.nhs.uk |url=http://www.avon.nhs.uk/phnet/Methods/life_tables.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120115331/http://www.avon.nhs.uk/phnet/Methods/life_tables.htm |archivedate=2012-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or starting point, of &lt;math&gt;\,\ell_0&lt;/math&gt; lives, typically taken as 100,000

:: &lt;math&gt;\,\ell_{x + 1} = \ell_x \cdot (1-q_x) = \ell_x \cdot p_x&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\,{\ell_{x + 1} \over \ell_x} = p_x&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\,d_x&lt;/math&gt;''':'''  the number of people who die aged &lt;math&gt;\,x&lt;/math&gt; last birthday

:: &lt;math&gt;\,d_x = \ell_x-\ell_{x+1} = \ell_x \cdot (1-p_x) = \ell_x \cdot q_x&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\,{}_tp_x&lt;/math&gt;''':'''  the probability that someone aged exactly &lt;math&gt;\,x&lt;/math&gt; will survive for &lt;math&gt;\,t&lt;/math&gt; more years, i.e. live up to at least age &lt;math&gt;\,x+t&lt;/math&gt; years

::&lt;math&gt;\,{}_tp_x = {\ell_{x+t} \over \ell_x}&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\,{}_{t\mid k}q_x&lt;/math&gt;''':''' the probability that someone aged exactly &lt;math&gt;\,x&lt;/math&gt; will survive for &lt;math&gt;\,t&lt;/math&gt; more years, then die within the following &lt;math&gt;\,k&lt;/math&gt; years

::&lt;math&gt;\,{}_{t\mid k}q_x = {}_t p_x \cdot {}_k q_{x+t} = {\ell_{x+t} - \ell_{x+t+k} \over \ell_x}&lt;/math&gt;

* ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; : the ''[[force of mortality]]'', i.e. the instantaneous mortality rate at age ''x'', i.e. the number of people dying in a short interval starting at age ''x'', divided by ''ℓ''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; and also divided by the length of the interval.

Another common variable is
* &lt;math&gt;\,m_x&lt;/math&gt;
This symbol refers to central rate of mortality. It is approximately equal to the average force of mortality, averaged over the year of age.

Further descriptions:
The variable dx stands for the number of deaths that would occur within two consecutive age numbers. An example of this is the number of deaths in a cohort that were recorded between the age of seven and the age of eight. 
The variable ''ℓx'', which stands for the opposite of ''dx'', represents the number of people who lived between two consecutive age numbers. ''ℓ'' of zero is equal to 100,000. The variable ''Tx'' stands for the years lived beyond each age number x by all members in the generation. ''Ėx'' represents the life expectancy for members already at a specific age number.&lt;ref name=SS /&gt;

==Ending a mortality table==

In practice, it is useful to have an ultimate age associated with a mortality table.  Once the ultimate age is reached, the mortality rate is assumed to be 1.000.  This age may be the point at which life insurance benefits are paid to a survivor or annuity payments cease.

Four methods can be used to end mortality tables:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ending the Mortality Table|publisher=soa.org|url=http://www.soa.org/library/monographs/retirement-systems/living-to-100-and-beyond/2005/january/m-li05-1-ix.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Forced Method: Select an ultimate age and set the mortality rate at that age equal to 1.000 without any changes to other mortality rates. This creates a discontinuity at the ultimate age compared to the penultimate and prior ages.
*The Blended Method: Select an ultimate age and blend the rates from some earlier age to dovetail smoothly into 1.000 at the ultimate age.
*The Pattern Method: Let the pattern of mortality continue until the rate approaches or hits 1.000 and set that as the ultimate age.
*The Less-Than-One Method: This is a variation on the Forced Method.  The ultimate mortality rate is set equal to the expected mortality at a selected ultimate age, rather 1.000 as in the Forced Method.  This rate will be less than 1.000.

==Epidemiology==
In [[epidemiology]] and public health, both standard life tables (used to calculate life expectancy), as well as the Sullivan and multi-state life tables (used to calculate health expectancy)''',''' are the most commonly mathematical used devices. The latter includes information on health in addition to mortality. By watching over the life expectancy of any year(s) being studied, epidemiologists can see if diseases are contributing to the overall increase in mortality rates.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/us-life-expectancy-declines-for-the-first-time-since-1993/2016/12/07/7dcdc7b4-bc93-11e6-91ee-1adddfe36cbe_story.html|title=U.S. life expectancy declines for the first time since 1993|last=Bernstein|first=Lenny|date=2016-12-08|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epidemiologists are able to help demographers understand the sudden decline of life expectancy by linking it to the health problems that are arising in certain populations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2526">In [[statistics]], the '''Newcastle–Ottawa scale''' is a tool used for assessing the quality of non-randomized studies included in a [[systematic review]] and/or [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]]. Using the tool, each study is judged on eight items, categorized into three groups: the selection of the study groups; the comparability of the groups; and the ascertainment of either the exposure or outcome of interest for case-control or cohort studies respectively. Stars awarded for each quality item serve as a quick visual assessment. Stars are awarded such that the highest quality studies are awarded up to nine stars. The method was developed as a collaboration between the [[University of Newcastle (Australia)|University of Newcastle, Australia]], and the [[University of Ottawa]], Canada, using a [[Delphi method|Delphi process]] to define variables for data extraction. The scale was then tested on systematic reviews and further refined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Deeks JJ, Dinnes J, D'Amico R, Sowden AJ, Sakarovitch C, Song F, etal | year = 2003 | title = Evaluating non-randomised intervention studies | url = | journal = Health Technol Assess | volume = 7 | issue = | page = 27 | doi=10.3310/hta7270}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separate tools were developed for cohort and case–control studies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14049">In [[computer programming]], a '''parser combinator''' is a [[higher-order function]] that accepts several parsers as input and returns a new parser as its output. In this context, a [[parser]] is a function accepting strings as input and returning some structure as output, typically a [[parse tree]] or a set of indices representing locations in the string where parsing stopped successfully. Parser combinators enable a [[recursive descent parsing]] strategy that facilitates modular piecewise construction and testing. This parsing technique is called '''combinatory parsing'''.

Parsers built using combinators are straightforward to construct, readable, modular, well-structured, and easily maintainable. They have been used extensively in the prototyping of compilers and processors for [[domain-specific language]]s such as [[natural language user interface|natural-language interfaces]] to databases, where complex and varied semantic actions are closely integrated with syntactic processing. In 1989, Richard Frost and John Launchbury demonstrated{{sfn|Frost|Launchbury|1989}} use of parser combinators to construct [[natural language processing|natural-language]] interpreters. Graham Hutton also used higher-order functions for basic parsing in 1992.{{sfn|Hutton|1992}} S.D. Swierstra also exhibited the practical aspects of parser combinators in 2001.{{sfn|Swierstra|2001}} In 2008, Frost, Hafiz and Callaghan{{sfn|Frost|Hafiz|Callaghan|2008}} described a set of parser combinators in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] that solve the long-standing problem of accommodating [[left recursion]], and work as a complete [[top-down parsing]] tool in polynomial time and space.

==Basic idea==
In any programming language that has [[First-class_function|first-class functions]], parser combinators can be used to combine basic parsers to construct parsers for more complex rules. For example, a [[Formal_grammar#The_syntax_of_grammars|production rule]] of a [[context-free grammar]] (CFG) may have one or more alternatives and each alternative may consist of a sequence of non-terminal(s) and/or terminal(s), or the alternative may consist of a single non-terminal or terminal or the empty string. If a simple parser is available for each of these alternatives, a parser combinator can be used to combine each of these parsers, returning a new parser which can recognise any or all of the alternatives.

In languages that support [[operator overloading]], a parser combinator can take the form of an [[infix]] operator, used to glue different parsers to form a complete rule. Parser combinators thereby enable parsers to be defined in an embedded style, in code which is similar in structure to the rules of the formal grammar. As such, implementations can be thought of as executable specifications with all the associated advantages. (Notably: readability)

==The combinators==
To keep the discussion relatively straightforward, we discuss parser combinators in terms of ''recognizers'' only. If the input string is of length &lt;code&gt;#input&lt;/code&gt; and its members are accessed through an index &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt;, a recognizer is a parser which returns, as output, a set of indices representing positions at which the parser successfully finished recognizing a sequence of tokens that began at position &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt;. An empty result set indicates that the recognizer failed to recognize any sequence beginning at index &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt;. A non-empty result set indicates the recognizer ends at different positions successfully.

* The &lt;code&gt;empty&lt;/code&gt; recognizer recognizes the empty string. This parser always succeeds, returning a singleton set containing the current position:
:&lt;math&gt;empty(j) = \{j\}&lt;/math&gt;

* A recognizer &lt;code&gt;term '''''x'''''&lt;/code&gt; recognizes the terminal &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;. If the token at position &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; in the input string is &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, this parser returns a singleton set containing &lt;code&gt;j + 1&lt;/code&gt;; otherwise, it returns the empty set.
:&lt;math&gt;
term(x,j) = 
\begin{cases} 
  \left \{ \right \},      &amp; j \geq \#input\\
  \left \{ j+1 \right \},  &amp; j^{th} \mbox{ element of } input=x\\
  \left \{ \right \},      &amp; \mbox{otherwise}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that there may be multiple distinct ways to parse a string while finishing at the same index: this indicates an [[ambiguous grammar]]. Simple recognizers do not acknowledge these ambiguities; each possible finishing index is listed only once in the result set. For a more complete set of results, a more complicated object such as a [[parse tree]] must be returned.

Following the definitions of two basic recognizers &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt;, we can define two major parser combinators for alternative and sequencing:

* The ‘alternative’ parser combinator, ⊕, applies both of the recognizers on the same input position &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; and sums up the results returned by both of the recognizers, which is eventually returned as the final result. It is used as an infix operator between &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
(p \oplus q)(j) = p(j) \cup q(j)
&lt;/math&gt;

* The sequencing of recognizers is done with the ⊛ parser combinator. Like ⊕, it is used as an infix operator between &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt;. But it applies the first recognizer &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; to the input position &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt;, and if there is any successful result of this application, then the second recognizer &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; is applied to every element of the result set returned by the first recognizer. ⊛ ultimately returns the union of these applications of q.
:&lt;math&gt;
(p \circledast q)(j) =  \bigcup \{ q(k) : k \in p(j) \}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==
Consider a highly ambiguous [[context-free grammar]], &lt;code&gt;s ::= ‘x’ s s | ε&lt;/code&gt;. Using the combinators defined earlier, we can modularly define executable notations of this grammar in a modern functional language (e.g. [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]) as &lt;code&gt;s = term ‘x’ &lt;*&gt; s &lt;*&gt; s &lt;+&gt; empty&lt;/code&gt;. When the recognizer &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; is applied on an input sequence &lt;code&gt;xxxxx&lt;/code&gt; at position &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;,  according to the above definitions it would return a result set &lt;code&gt;{5,4,3,2}&lt;/code&gt;.

==Shortcomings and solutions==
Parser combinators, like all [[recursive descent parsers]], are not limited to the [[context-free grammar]]s and thus do no global search for ambiguities in the [[LL parser|LL(''k'') parsing]] First&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; and Follow&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; sets. Thus, ambiguities are not known until run-time if and until the input triggers them. In such cases, the recursive descent parser may default (perhaps unknown to the grammar designer) to one of the possible ambiguous paths, resulting in semantic confusion (aliasing) in the use of the language. This leads to bugs by users of ambiguous programming languages, which are not reported at compile-time, and which are introduced not by human error, but by ambiguous grammar. The only solution that eliminates these bugs is to remove the ambiguities and use a context-free grammar.

The simple implementations of parser combinators have some shortcomings, which are common in top-down parsing. Naïve combinatory parsing requires [[Exponential time|exponential]] time and space when parsing an ambiguous context-free grammar. In 1996, Frost and Szydlowski demonstrated how [[memoization]] can be used with parser combinators to reduce the time complexity to polynomial.{{sfn|Frost|Szydlowski|1996}} Later Frost used [[Monad (functional programming)|monads]] to construct the combinators for systematic and correct threading of memo-table throughout the computation.{{sfn|Frost|2003}}

Like any top-down [[Recursive descent parser|recursive descent parsing]], the conventional parser combinators (like the combinators described above) will not terminate while processing a [[left recursion|left-recursive grammar]] (e.g. &lt;code&gt;s ::= s &lt;*&gt; term ‘x’|empty&lt;/code&gt;). A recognition algorithm that accommodates ambiguous grammars with direct left-recursive rules is described by Frost and Hafiz in 2006.{{sfn|Frost|Hafiz|2006}} The algorithm curtails the otherwise ever-growing left-recursive parse by imposing depth restrictions. That algorithm was extended to a complete parsing algorithm to accommodate indirect as well as direct left-recursion in [[polynomial time]], and to generate compact polynomial-size representations of the potentially exponential number of parse trees for highly ambiguous grammars by Frost, Hafiz and Callaghan in 2007.{{sfn|Frost|Hafiz|Callaghan|2007}} This extended algorithm accommodates indirect left recursion by comparing its ‘computed context’ with ‘current context’. The same authors also described their implementation of a set of parser combinators written in the Haskell programming language based on the same algorithm.{{sfn|Frost|Hafiz|Callaghan|2008}}&lt;ref&gt;cf.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5055">In [[probability theory]], a '''piecewise-deterministic Markov process (PDMP)''' is a process whose behaviour is governed by random jumps at points in time, but whose evolution is deterministically governed by an [[ordinary differential equation]] between those times.  The class of models is "wide enough to include as special cases virtually all the non-diffusion models of [[applied probability]]."&lt;ref name="davis" /&gt; The process is defined by three quantities: the ﬂow, the jump rate, and the transition measure.&lt;ref name="siam2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Costa | first1 = O.

The model was first introduced in a paper by [[Mark H. A. Davis]] in 1984.&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = M. H. A. | authorlink = Mark H. A.

==Examples==

In [[projective geometry]], a '''plane at infinity''' is the [[hyperplane at infinity]] of a three dimensional [[projective space]] or to any [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] contained in the hyperplane at infinity of any projective space of higher dimension. This article will be concerned solely with the three-dimensional case.

==Definition==
There are two approaches to defining the ''plane at infinity'' which depend on whether one starts with a projective 3-space or an [[affine space|affine 3-space]].

If a projective 3-space is given, the ''plane at infinity'' is any distinguished [[projective plane]] of the space.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Samuel|1988|loc=p. 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This point of view emphasizes the fact that this plane is not geometrically different than any other plane. On the other hand, given an affine 3-space, the ''plane at infinity'' is a projective plane which is added to the affine 3-space in order to give it closure of [[Incidence (geometry)|incidence]] properties. Meaning that the points of the ''plane at infinity'' are the points where parallel lines of the affine 3-space will meet, and the [[line (geometry)|lines]] are the lines where parallel planes of the affine 3-space will meet. The result of the addition is the projective 3-space, &lt;math&gt;P^3&lt;/math&gt;. This point of view emphasizes the internal structure of the plane at infinity, but does make it look "special" in comparison to the other planes of the space.

If the affine 3-space is real, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;, then the addition of a [[real projective plane]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}P^2&lt;/math&gt; at infinity produces the real projective 3-space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}P^3&lt;/math&gt;.

==Analytic representation==
Since any two projective planes in a projective 3-space are equivalent, we can choose a [[homogeneous coordinates|homogeneous coordinate system]] so that any point on the plane at infinity is represented as (''X'':''Y'':''Z'':0).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meserve|1983|loc=p. 150}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Any point in the affine 3-space will then be represented as (''X'':''Y'':''Z'':1). The points on the plane at infinity seem to have three degrees of freedom, but homogeneous coordinates are equivalent [[up to]] any rescaling:

: &lt;math&gt; (X : Y : Z : 0) \equiv (a X : a Y : a Z : 0) &lt;/math&gt;,

so that the coordinates (''X'':''Y'':''Z'':0) can be [[Normalized vector|normalized]], thus reducing the degrees of freedom to two (thus, a surface, namely a projective plane).

''Proposition'': Any line which passes through the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] (0:0:0:1) and through a point (''X'':''Y'':''Z'':1) will intersect the plane at infinity at the point (''X'':''Y'':''Z'':0).

''Proof'': A line which passes through points (0:0:0:1) and (''X'':''Y'':''Z'':1) will consist of points which are [[homogeneous coordinates#Linear Combinations of Points Described with Homogeneous Co-ordinates|linear combinations]] of the two given points:
:&lt;math&gt; a (0:0:0:1) + b (X:Y:Z:1) = (bX :bY: bZ: a + b). &lt;/math&gt;
For such a point to lie on the plane at infinity we must have, &lt;math&gt; a + b = 0&lt;/math&gt;. So, by choosing &lt;math&gt; a = - b&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain the point  
&lt;math&gt;(bX:bY:bZ:0) = (X : Y : Z : 0) &lt;/math&gt;, as required.  [[Q.E.D.]]

Any pair of parallel lines in 3-space will intersect each other at a point on the plane at infinity.  Also, every line in 3-space intersects the plane at infinity at a unique point.  This point is determined by the direction—and only by the direction—of the line.  To determine this point, consider a line parallel to the given line, but passing through the origin, if the line does not already pass through the origin. Then choose any point, other than the origin, on this second line.  If the homogeneous coordinates of this point are (''X'':''Y'':''Z'':1), then the homogeneous coordinates of the point at infinity through which the first and second line both pass is (''X'':''Y'':''Z'':0).

''Example'': Consider a line passing through the points (0:0:1:1) and (3:0:1:1).  A parallel line passes through points (0:0:0:1) and (3:0:0:1).  This second line intersects the plane at infinity at the point (3:0:0:0).  But the first line also passes through this point:
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda (3:0:1:1) + \mu (0:0:1:1) &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; = (3 \lambda : 0 : \lambda + \mu : \lambda + \mu)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; = ( 3 : 0 : 0 : 0) &lt;/math&gt;
when &lt;math&gt;\lambda + \mu = 0&lt;/math&gt;. ■

Any pair of parallel planes in affine 3-space will intersect each other in a projective line (a [[line at infinity]]) in the plane at infinity.  Also, every plane in the affine 3-space intersects the plane at infinity in a unique line.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Woods|1961|loc=p. 187}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This line is determined by the direction—and only by the direction—of the plane.

==Properties==
Since the plane at infinity is a projective plane, it is [[homeomorphic]] to the surface of a "sphere modulo antipodes", i.e. a sphere in which [[antipodal point]]s are equivalent: S&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/{1,-1} where the quotient is understood as a quotient by a group action (see [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]]).

'''''Plug &amp; Pray''''' is a 2010 documentary film about the promise, problems and ethics of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[robotics]]. The main protagonists are the former [[MIT]] professor [[Joseph Weizenbaum]] and the futurist [[Raymond Kurzweil]]. The title is a pun on the computer hardware phrase "[[Plug and play#Plug and Play|Plug and Play]]".

== Synopsis ==
Computer experts around the world strive towards the development of intelligent robots. Pioneers like Raymond Kurzweil and [[Hiroshi Ishiguro]] dream of fashioning intelligent machines that will equal their human creators. In this potential reality, man and machine merge as a single unity. Rejecting evolution's biological shackles tantalisingly dangles the promise of eternal life for those bold enough to seize it. But others, like [[Joseph Weizenbaum]], counterattack against society's limitless faith in the redemptive powers of technology, questioning the prevailing discourses on new technologies and their ethical relationships to human life. The film delves into a world where computer technology, robotics, biology, neuroscience, and developmental psychology merge, and features roboticists in their laboratories in Japan, the USA, Italy and Germany.

== Background ==
Since antiquity, mankind has dreamed of creating brilliant machines. The invention of the computer and the breathtaking pace of technological progress appear to be bringing the realisation of this dream within the grasp of humans. Robots were to do the housework, look after the children, care for the elderly, and go to war. Former MIT professor [[Joseph Weizenbaum]], creator of [[ELIZA]], has become a harsh critic of their visions of technological omnipotence.

Production of the film started in 2006 and ended in 2009. The death of the main protagonist Joseph Weizenbaum on March 5, 2008, fell in this period. The international festival premiere was at [[FIPA]] 2010 in Biarritz, France.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120909091740/http://www.fipa.tm.fr/en/programmes/2010/doc_21146.htm Program of FIPA 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the film has been invited to 27 film festivals, among them the [[Seattle International Film Festival]], [[Vancouver International Film Festival|Vancouver Film Festival]], [[Visions du Réel]]. The theatrical release in Germany was on Nov. 11, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kino.de/kinofilm/plug-pray/100518.html#start kino.de]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
The film won the [[Bavarian Film Award]] 2010 for "best documentary", the Grand Prix of the Jury for the best film at the Paris International Science Film Festival,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pariscience.fr Film Festival Pariscience]&lt;/ref&gt;  the Primer Premio for best film at the Mostra de Ciencia e Cinema in La Coruña (Spain),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cienciaecinema.org Mostra de Ciencia e Cinema]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Science Communication Award at the International Science Film Festival Athens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caid.gr/isffa/awards.html International Science Film Festival Athens] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028102045/http://www.caid.gr/isffa/awards.html |date=2010-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also chosen as the best international film at the 46th AFO, Science Documentary Festival in Olomouc, Czech Republic, in 2011.

==Largest progression-free subsets==
Find the cardinality (denoted by ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''m'')) of the largest subset of {1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''m''} which contains no progression of ''k'' distinct terms. The elements of the forbidden progressions are not required to be consecutive.

For example, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(10)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;8, because {1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;5,&amp;nbsp;6,&amp;nbsp;8,&amp;nbsp;9,&amp;nbsp;10} has no arithmetic progressions of length&amp;nbsp;4, while all 9-element subsets of {1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;10} have one. [[Paul Erdős]] set a $1000 prize for a question related to this number, collected by [[Endre Szemerédi]] for what has become known as [[Szemerédi's theorem]].

==Arithmetic progressions from prime numbers==
{{main|Primes in arithmetic progression}}
[[Szemerédi's theorem]] states that a set of [[natural number]]s of non-zero [[upper asymptotic density]] contains finite arithmetic progressions, of any arbitrary length ''k''.

Erdős made [[Erdős conjecture on arithmetic progressions|a more general conjecture]] from which it would follow that
:''The sequence of primes numbers contains arithmetic progressions of any length.''

This result was proven by [[Ben Green (mathematician)|Ben Green]] and [[Terence Tao]] in 2004 and is now known as the [[Green–Tao theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Prime Arithmetic Progression|urlname=PrimeArithmeticProgression}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4770">In [[mathematics]], '''Ratner's theorems''' are a group of major theorems in [[ergodic theory]] concerning unipotent flows on [[homogeneous space]]s proved by [[Marina Ratner]] around 1990. The theorems grew out of Ratner's earlier work on [[horocycle flow]]s. The study of the dynamics of unipotent flows played a decisive role in the proof of the [[Oppenheim conjecture]] by [[Grigory Margulis]]. Ratner's theorems have guided key advances in the understanding of the dynamics of unipotent flows. Their later generalizations provide ways to both sharpen the results and extend the theory to the setting of arbitrary [[semisimple algebraic group]]s over a [[local field]].

== Short description ==
The '''Ratner orbit closure theorem''' asserts that the closures of orbits of unipotent flows on the quotient of a Lie group by a lattice are nice, geometric subsets. The '''Ratner equidistribution theorem''' further asserts that each such orbit is equidistributed in its closure. The '''Ratner measure classification theorem''' is the weaker statement that every ergodic invariant probability measure is homogeneous, or ''algebraic'': this turns out to be an important step towards proving the more general equidistribution property. There is no universal agreement on the names of these theorems: they are variously known as the "measure rigidity theorem", the "theorem on invariant measures" and its "topological version", and so on.

Let &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt; be a [[Lie group]], &lt;math&gt; \mathit{\Gamma} &lt;/math&gt; a [[lattice (discrete subgroup)|lattice]] in &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; u^t &lt;/math&gt; a [[one-parameter subgroup]] of &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt; consisting of [[unipotent]] elements, with the associated [[flow (mathematics)|flow]] &lt;math&gt; \phi_t &lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt; \mathit{\Gamma} \setminus G &lt;/math&gt;. Then the closure of every orbit &lt;math&gt; \left\{ xu^t \right\} &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; \phi_t &lt;/math&gt; is homogeneous. More precisely, there exists a [[Connectedness|connected]], closed subgroup &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt; such that the image of the orbit &lt;math&gt;\,  xS \, &lt;/math&gt; for the action of &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; by right translations on &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt; under the canonical projection to  &lt;math&gt; \mathit{\Gamma} \setminus G &lt;/math&gt; is closed, has a finite &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt;-invariant measure, and contains the closure of the &lt;math&gt; \phi_t &lt;/math&gt;-orbit of &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; as a [[dense subset]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26632">In the area of mathematics known as [[functional analysis]], a '''reflexive space''' is a [[Banach space]] (or more generally a [[locally convex topological vector space]]) that coincides with the [[Dual space#Continuous dual space|continuous dual]] of its continuous dual space, both as linear space and as topological space. Reflexive Banach spaces are often characterized by their geometric properties.

== Reflexive Banach spaces ==
Suppose &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[normed vector space]] over the number field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F} = \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F} = \mathbb {C}&lt;/math&gt; (the [[real number|real]] or [[complex number]]s), with a norm &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|&lt;/math&gt;. Consider its [[dual norm|dual normed space]] &lt;math&gt;X'&lt;/math&gt;, that consists of all [[continuous function|continuous]] [[linear functional]]s &lt;math&gt;f:X\to {\mathbb F}&lt;/math&gt; and is equipped with the [[dual norm]] &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|'&lt;/math&gt; defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\|f\|' = \sup \{ |f(x)| \,:\, x \in X, \ \|x\| = 1 \}.&lt;/math&gt;

The dual &lt;math&gt;X'&lt;/math&gt; is a normed space (a [[Banach space]] to be precise), and its dual normed space &lt;math&gt;X''=(X')'&lt;/math&gt; is called '''bidual space''' for &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. The bidual consists of all continuous linear functionals &lt;math&gt;h:X'\to {\mathbb F}&lt;/math&gt; and is equipped with the norm &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|''&lt;/math&gt; dual to &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|'&lt;/math&gt;. Each vector &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; generates a scalar function &lt;math&gt;J(x):X'\to{\mathbb F}&lt;/math&gt; by the formula:
:&lt;math&gt;
J(x)(f)=f(x),\qquad f\in X',
&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;J(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous linear functional on &lt;math&gt;X'&lt;/math&gt;, ''i.e.'', &lt;math&gt;J(x)\in X''&lt;/math&gt;.  One obtains in this way a map

:&lt;math&gt; J: X \to X'' &lt;/math&gt;

called '''evaluation map''', that is linear. It follows from the [[Hahn–Banach theorem]] that &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is injective and preserves norms:
:&lt;math&gt;
\forall x\in X\qquad \|J(x)\|''=\|x\|,
&lt;/math&gt;
''i.e.'', &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; maps &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; isometrically onto its image &lt;math&gt;J(X)&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X''&lt;/math&gt;.  Furthermore, the image &lt;math&gt;J(X)&lt;/math&gt; is closed in &lt;math&gt;X''&lt;/math&gt;, but it need not be equal to &lt;math&gt;X''&lt;/math&gt;.

A normed space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is called '''reflexive''' if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:
:(i) the evaluation map &lt;math&gt;J:X\to X''&lt;/math&gt; is [[Bijection, injection and surjection|surjective]],
:(ii) the evaluation map &lt;math&gt;J:X\to X''&lt;/math&gt; is an [[Banach space|isometric isomorphism]] of normed spaces,
:(iii) the evaluation map &lt;math&gt;J:X\to X''&lt;/math&gt; is an [[Banach space|isomorphism]] of normed spaces.
A reflexive space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a Banach space, since &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is then isometric to the Banach space &lt;math&gt;X''&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Remark ===
A Banach space ''X'' is reflexive if it is linearly isometric to its bidual under this canonical embedding ''J''. [[James' space]] is an example of a non-reflexive space which is linearly isometric to its [[Dual space#Double dual|bidual]]. Furthermore, the image of James' space under the canonical embedding ''J'' has [[codimension]] one in its bidual.

A Banach space&amp;nbsp;''X'' is called '''quasi-reflexive''' (of order ''d'') if the quotient {{nowrap|''X''&amp;thinsp;&amp;prime;&amp;prime;&amp;thinsp;/&amp;thinsp;''J''(''X'')}} has finite dimension ''d''.

=== Examples ===

1) Every finite-dimensional normed space is reflexive, simply because in this case, the space, its dual and bidual all have the same linear dimension, hence the linear injection ''J'' from the definition is bijective, by the [[rank–nullity theorem]].

2) The Banach space [[Sequence space#c and c0|''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]] of scalar sequences tending to 0 at infinity, equipped with the supremum norm, is not reflexive.  It follows from the general properties below that [[Sequence space#.E2.84.93p spaces|ℓ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and ℓ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;infin;&lt;/sup&gt;]] are not reflexive, because ℓ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is isomorphic to the dual of ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and ℓ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;infin;&lt;/sup&gt; is isomorphic to the dual of&amp;nbsp;ℓ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

3) All [[Hilbert space]]s are reflexive, as are the [[Lp space|''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces]] for {{nowrap|1 &lt; ''p'' &lt; &amp;infin;}}. More generally: all [[uniformly convex space|uniformly convex]] Banach spaces are reflexive according to the [[Milman–Pettis theorem]].  The ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''&amp;mu;'') and ''L''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;infin;&lt;/sup&gt;(''&amp;mu;'') spaces are not reflexive (unless they are finite dimensional, which happens for example when ''&amp;mu;'' is a measure on a finite set).  Likewise, the Banach space ''C''([0,&amp;nbsp;1]) of continuous functions on&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;1] is not reflexive.

4) The spaces ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''H'') of operators in the [[Schatten class operator|Schatten class]]  on a Hilbert space ''H'' are uniformly convex, hence reflexive, when {{nowrap|1 &lt; ''p'' &lt; &amp;infin;}}.  When the dimension of ''H'' is infinite, then ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''H'') (the [[trace class]]) is not reflexive, because it contains a subspace isomorphic to ℓ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;infin;&lt;/sub&gt;(''H'')&amp;nbsp;= ''L''(''H'') (the bounded linear operators on&amp;nbsp;''H'') is not reflexive, because it contains a subspace isomorphic to ℓ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;infin;&lt;/sup&gt;.  In both cases, the subspace can be chosen to be the operators diagonal with respect to a given orthonormal basis of&amp;nbsp;''H''.

=== Properties ===
If a Banach space ''Y'' is isomorphic to a reflexive Banach space ''X'', then ''Y'' is reflexive.&lt;ref&gt;Proposition 1.11.8, p.&amp;nbsp;99 in {{harvtxt|Megginson|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Every [[Closed set|closed]] [[linear subspace]] of a reflexive space is reflexive.  The continuous dual of a reflexive space is reflexive.  Every [[Quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient]] of a reflexive space by a closed subspace is reflexive.&lt;ref&gt;pp.&amp;nbsp;104&amp;ndash;105 in {{harvtxt|Megginson|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Let ''X'' be a Banach space. The following are equivalent.
# The space ''X'' is reflexive.
# The continuous dual of ''X'' is reflexive.&lt;ref&gt;Corollary 1.11.17, p.&amp;nbsp;104 in {{harvtxt|Megginson|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The closed unit ball of ''X'' is [[compact space|compact]] in the [[weak topology]]. (This is known as Kakutani's Theorem.)&lt;ref&gt;Conway, Theorem V.4.2, p.&amp;nbsp;135.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Every bounded sequence in ''X'' has a weakly convergent subsequence.&lt;ref&gt;Since weak compactness and weak sequential compactness coincide by the [[Eberlein–Šmulian theorem]].&lt;/ref&gt;
# Every continuous linear functional on ''X'' attains its maximum on the closed unit ball in&amp;nbsp;''X''.&lt;ref&gt;Theorem 1.13.11, p.&amp;nbsp;125 in {{harvtxt|Megginson|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[James' theorem]])

Since norm-closed [[Convex set|convex subsets]] in a Banach space are weakly closed,&lt;ref&gt;Theorem 2.5.16, p.&amp;nbsp;216 in {{harvtxt|Megginson|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
it follows from the third property that closed bounded convex subsets of a reflexive space&amp;nbsp;''X'' are weakly compact.  Thus, for every decreasing sequence of non-empty closed bounded convex subsets of&amp;nbsp;''X'', the intersection is non-empty.  As a consequence, every continuous [[convex function]] ''f'' on a closed convex subset ''C'' of&amp;nbsp;''X'', such that the set
:&lt;math&gt; C_t = \{ x \in C \,:\, f(x) \le t\} &lt;/math&gt;
is non-empty and bounded for some real number&amp;nbsp;''t'', attains its minimum value on&amp;nbsp;''C''.

The promised geometric property of reflexive Banach spaces is the following: if ''C'' is a closed non-empty [[Convex set|convex]] subset of the reflexive space ''X'', then for every ''x'' in ''X'' there exists a&amp;nbsp;''c'' in&amp;nbsp;''C'' such that {{nowrap|ǁ''x'' &amp;minus; ''c''ǁ}} minimizes the distance between ''x'' and points of&amp;nbsp;''C''.  This follows from the preceding result for convex functions, applied to {{nowrap|''f''(''y'') {{=}} ǁ''y'' &amp;minus; ''x''ǁ}}.  Note that while the minimal distance between ''x'' and ''C'' is uniquely defined by ''x'', the point ''c'' is not.  The closest point ''c'' is unique when ''X'' is uniformly convex.

A reflexive Banach space is [[separable space|separable]] if and only if its continuous dual is separable.  This follows from the fact that for every normed space&amp;nbsp;''Y'', separability of the continuous dual {{nowrap|''Y''&amp;thinsp;&amp;prime;}} implies separability {{nowrap|of ''Y''}}.&lt;ref&gt;Theorem&amp;nbsp;1.12.11, p.&amp;nbsp;112 and Corollary&amp;nbsp;1.12.12, p.&amp;nbsp;113 in {{harvtxt|Megginson|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Super-reflexive space ===
Informally, a super-reflexive Banach space ''X'' has the following property: given an arbitrary Banach space&amp;nbsp;''Y'', if all finite-dimensional subspaces of&amp;nbsp;''Y'' have a very similar copy sitting somewhere in&amp;nbsp;''X'', then ''Y'' must be reflexive.  By this definition, the space ''X'' itself must be reflexive.  As an elementary example, every Banach space&amp;nbsp;''Y'' whose two dimensional subspaces are [[Isometry|isometric]] to subspaces of {{nowrap|''X'' {{=}} ℓ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} satisfies the [[parallelogram law]], hence&lt;ref&gt;see this [[Banach space#Characterizations of Hilbert space among Banach spaces|characterization of Hilbert space among Banach spaces]]&lt;/ref&gt; 
''Y'' is a Hilbert space, therefore ''Y'' is reflexive.  So  ℓ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is super-reflexive.

The formal definition does not use isometries, but almost isometries.  A Banach space ''Y'' is '''finitely representable'''&lt;ref name="SRBS"&gt;James, Robert C. (1972), "Super-reflexive Banach spaces", Can. J. Math. '''24''':896&amp;ndash;904.&lt;/ref&gt; 
in a Banach space ''X'' if for every finite-dimensional subspace ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of ''Y'' and every {{nowrap| &amp;epsilon; &amp;gt; 0}}, there is a subspace ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of ''X'' such that the multiplicative [[Banach–Mazur compactum|Banach&amp;ndash;Mazur distance]] between ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;d(X_0, Y_0) &lt; 1 + \varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

A Banach space finitely representable in ℓ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a Hilbert space.  Every Banach space is finitely representable in ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  The space [[Lp space|''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;([0,&amp;nbsp;1])]] is finitely representable in&amp;nbsp;ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;.

A Banach space ''X'' is '''super-reflexive''' if all Banach spaces ''Y'' finitely representable in&amp;nbsp;''X'' are reflexive, or, in other words, if no non-reflexive space ''Y'' is finitely representable in&amp;nbsp;''X''.  The notion of [[ultraproduct]] of a family of Banach spaces&lt;ref&gt;Dacunha-Castelle, Didier; Krivine, Jean-Louis (1972), "Applications des ultraproduits à l'étude des espaces et des algèbres de Banach" (in French), Studia Math. '''41''':315&amp;ndash;334.&lt;/ref&gt; 
allows for a concise definition: the Banach space ''X'' is super-reflexive when its ultrapowers are reflexive.

James proved that a space is super-reflexive if and only if its dual is super-reflexive.&lt;ref name="SRBS" /&gt;

=== Finite trees in Banach spaces===
One of James' characterizations of super-reflexivity uses the growth of separated trees.&lt;ref name="Tree"&gt;see {{harvtxt|James|1972}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The description of a vectorial binary tree begins with a [[Tree (graph theory)#Definitions|rooted binary tree]] labeled by vectors: a tree of [[Binary tree#Definitions for rooted trees|height]]&amp;nbsp;''n'' in a Banach space ''X'' is a family of {{nowrap| 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;thinsp;+&amp;thinsp;1&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; 1}} vectors of&amp;nbsp;''X'', that can be organized in successive levels, starting with level&amp;nbsp;0 that consists of a single vector&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;empty;&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[Tree (graph theory)#Definitions|root]] of the tree, followed, for {{nowrap|''k'' {{=}} 1, &amp;hellip;, ''n''}}, by a family of 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; vectors forming level&amp;nbsp;''k'':

:&lt;math&gt;\{x_{\varepsilon_1, \ldots, \varepsilon_k}\},
\quad  \varepsilon_j = \pm 1, \quad j = 1, \ldots, k,&lt;/math&gt;

that are the [[Tree (graph theory)#Definitions|children]] of vertices of level&amp;nbsp;{{nowrap|''k'' &amp;minus; 1}}.  In addition to the [[Tree (graph theory)|tree structure]], it is required here that each vector that is an [[Tree (graph theory)#Definitions|internal vertex]] of the tree be the midpoint between its two children:

:&lt;math&gt;x_\emptyset = \frac{x_1 + x_{-1}}{2}, \quad x_{\varepsilon_1, \ldots, \varepsilon_k} = \frac{x_{\varepsilon_1, \ldots, \varepsilon_k, 1} + x_{\varepsilon_1, \ldots, \varepsilon_k, -1}} {2}, \quad 1 \le k &lt; n.&lt;/math&gt;

Given a positive real number&amp;nbsp;''t'', the tree is said to be ''' ''t''-separated''' if for every internal vertex, the two children are ''t''-separated in the given space norm:

:&lt;math&gt; \|x_1 - x_{-1}\| \ge t, \quad \|x_{\varepsilon_1, \ldots, \varepsilon_k, 1} - x_{\varepsilon_1, \ldots, \varepsilon_k, -1}\| \ge t, \quad 1 \le k &lt; n.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Theorem.'''&lt;ref name="Tree" /&gt;
The Banach space ''X'' is super-reflexive if and only if for every {{nowrap|''t'' &amp;isin; (0, 2]}}, there is a number ''n''(''t'') such that every ''t''-separated tree contained in the unit ball of&amp;nbsp;''X'' has height less than&amp;nbsp;''n''(''t'').&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Uniformly convex space]]s are super-reflexive.&lt;ref name="Tree" /&gt;  
Let ''X'' be uniformly convex, with [[Modulus and characteristic of convexity|modulus of convexity]] &amp;delta;&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; and let&amp;nbsp;''t'' be a real number in&amp;nbsp;{{nowrap|(0, 2]}}.  By the [[Modulus and characteristic of convexity#Definitions|properties]] of the modulus of convexity, a ''t''-separated tree of height&amp;nbsp;''n'', contained in the unit ball, must have all points of level&amp;nbsp;{{nowrap|''n'' &amp;minus; 1}} contained in the ball of radius {{nowrap|1 &amp;minus; &amp;delta;&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') &amp;lt; 1}}. By induction, it follows that all points of level&amp;nbsp;{{nowrap|''n'' &amp;minus; ''j''}} are contained in the ball of radius

:&lt;math&gt; (1 - \delta_X(t))^{j}, \ j = 1, \ldots, n.&lt;/math&gt;

If the height ''n'' was so large that

:&lt;math&gt; (1 - \delta_X(t))^{n-1} &lt; t / 2, &lt;/math&gt;

then the two points ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt; of the first level could not be ''t''-separated, contrary to the assumption.  This gives the required bound&amp;nbsp;''n''(''t''), function of &amp;delta;&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')&amp;nbsp;only.

Using the tree-characterization, [[Per Enflo|Enflo]] proved&lt;ref&gt;Enflo, Per (1973), "Banach spaces which can be given an equivalent uniformly convex norm", Israel J. Math. '''13''':281&amp;ndash;288.&lt;/ref&gt; 
that super-reflexive Banach spaces admit an equivalent uniformly convex norm.  Trees in a Banach space are a special instance of vector-valued [[Martingale (probability theory)|martingales]].  Adding techniques from scalar martingale theory, [[Gilles Pisier|Pisier]] improved Enflo's result by showing&lt;ref&gt;Pisier, Gilles (1975), "Martingales with values in uniformly convex spaces", Israel J. Math. '''20''':326&amp;ndash;350.&lt;/ref&gt; 
that a super-reflexive space&amp;nbsp;''X'' admits an equivalent uniformly convex norm for which the modulus of convexity satisfies, for some constant&amp;nbsp;{{nowrap|''c'' &amp;gt; 0}} and some real number&amp;nbsp;{{nowrap|''q'' &amp;ge; 2}},

:&lt;math&gt; \delta_X(t) \ge c \, t^q, \quad t \in [0, 2].&lt;/math&gt;

== Reflexive locally convex spaces ==

The notion of reflexive Banach space can be generalized to [[topological vector space]]s in the following way.

Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a topological vector space over a number field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb F&lt;/math&gt; (of [[real number]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; or [[complex number]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathbb C&lt;/math&gt;). Consider its [[Strong topology (polar topology)|strong dual space]] &lt;math&gt;X'_\beta&lt;/math&gt;, which consists of all [[continuous function|continuous]] [[linear functional]]s &lt;math&gt;f:X\to {\mathbb F}&lt;/math&gt; and is equipped with the [[Strong topology (polar topology)|strong topology]] &lt;math&gt;\beta(X',X)&lt;/math&gt;, ''i.e.'', the topology of uniform convergence on bounded subsets in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. The space &lt;math&gt;X'_\beta&lt;/math&gt; is a topological vector space (to be more precise, a locally convex space), so one can consider its strong dual space &lt;math&gt;(X'_\beta)'_\beta&lt;/math&gt;, which is called the '''strong bidual space''' for &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. It consists of all 
continuous linear functionals &lt;math&gt;h:X'_\beta\to {\mathbb F}&lt;/math&gt; and is equipped with the strong topology &lt;math&gt;\beta((X'_\beta)',X'_\beta)&lt;/math&gt;. Each vector &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; generates a map &lt;math&gt;J(x):X'_\beta\to{\mathbb F}&lt;/math&gt; by the following formula:
:&lt;math&gt;
J(x)(f)=f(x),\qquad f\in X'.
&lt;/math&gt;
This is a continuous linear functional on &lt;math&gt;X'_\beta&lt;/math&gt;, ''i.e.'', &lt;math&gt;J(x)\in (X'_\beta)'_\beta&lt;/math&gt;. One obtains a map called '''evaluation map''':
:&lt;math&gt;
J:X\to (X'_\beta)'_\beta.
&lt;/math&gt;
This map is linear. If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is locally convex, from the [[Hahn–Banach theorem]] it follows that &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is injective and open (''i.e.'', for each neighbourhood of zero &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; there is a neighbourhood of zero &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;(X'_\beta)'_\beta&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;J(U)\supseteq V\cap J(X)&lt;/math&gt;). But it can be non-surjective and/or discontinuous.

A locally convex space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is called 
: - '''semi-reflexive''' if the evaluation map  &lt;math&gt;J:X\to (X'_\beta)'_\beta&lt;/math&gt; is surjective,
: - '''reflexive''' if the evaluation map  &lt;math&gt;J:X\to (X'_\beta)'_\beta&lt;/math&gt; is surjective and continuous (in this case  &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism of topological vector spaces).

'''Theorem.'''{{sfn|Edwards|1965|loc=8.4.2}}  ''A locally convex Hausdorff space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is semi-reflexive if and only if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with the &lt;math&gt;\sigma(X, X^*)&lt;/math&gt;-topology has the Heine-Borel property (i.e. weakly closed and bounded subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; are weakly compact).''

'''Theorem.'''{{sfn|Schaefer|1966|loc=5.6, 5.5}}{{sfn|Edwards|1965|loc=8.4.5}} ''A locally convex space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is reflexive if and only if it is semi-reflexive and [[Barrelled space|barreled]].''

'''Theorem.'''{{sfn|Edwards|1965|loc=8.4.3}} ''The strong dual of a semireflexive space is barrelled.''

=== Examples ===
1) Every finite-dimensional Hausdorff [[topological vector space]] is reflexive, because ''J''  is bijective by linear algebra, and because there is a unique Hausdorff vector space topology on a finite dimensional vector space.

2) A normed space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is reflexive as a normed space if and only if it is reflexive as a locally convex space. This follows from the fact that for a normed space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; its dual normed space &lt;math&gt;X'&lt;/math&gt; coincides as a topological vector space with the strong dual space &lt;math&gt;X'_\beta&lt;/math&gt;. As a corollary, the evaluation map &lt;math&gt;J:X\to X''&lt;/math&gt; coincides with the evaluation map &lt;math&gt;J:X\to (X'_\beta)'_\beta&lt;/math&gt;, and the following conditions become equivalent:
:(i) &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a reflexive normed space (i.e. &lt;math&gt;J:X\to X''&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism of normed spaces),
:(ii) &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a reflexive locally convex space (i.e. &lt;math&gt;J:X\to (X'_\beta)'_\beta&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism of topological vector spaces),
:(iii) &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a semi-reflexive locally convex space (i.e. &lt;math&gt;J:X\to (X'_\beta)'_\beta&lt;/math&gt; is surjective).

3) A (somewhat artificial) example of a semi-reflexive space that is not reflexive is obtained as follows:  let ''Y'' be an infinite dimensional reflexive Banach space, and let ''X'' be the topological vector space {{nowrap|(''Y'', ''&amp;sigma;''(''Y'', ''Y''&amp;thinsp;&amp;prime;))}}, that is, the vector space ''Y'' equipped with the weak topology.  Then the continuous dual of ''X'' and {{nowrap|''Y''&amp;thinsp;&amp;prime;}} are the same set of functionals, and bounded subsets of ''X'' (''i.e.'', weakly bounded subsets of&amp;nbsp;''Y'') are norm-bounded, hence the Banach space {{nowrap|''Y''&amp;thinsp;&amp;prime;}} is the strong dual of&amp;nbsp;''X''. Since ''Y'' is reflexive, the continuous dual of {{nowrap|''X''&amp;thinsp;&amp;prime; {{=}} ''Y''&amp;thinsp;&amp;prime;}} is equal to the image ''J''(''X'') of ''X'' under the canonical embedding ''J'',  but the topology on ''X'' (the weak topology of&amp;nbsp;''Y'') is not the strong topology  {{nowrap|''&amp;beta;''(''X'', ''X''&amp;thinsp;&amp;prime;)}}, that is equal to the norm topology of ''Y''.

4) [[Montel space]]s are reflexive locally convex topological vector spaces. In particular, the following functional spaces frequently used in functional analysis are reflexive locally convex spaces:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Edwards|1965|loc=8.4.7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

* the space &lt;math&gt;C^\infty(M)&lt;/math&gt; of smooth functions on arbitrary (real) smooth manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, and its strong dual space &lt;math&gt;(C^\infty)'(M)&lt;/math&gt; of distributions with compact support on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;,
* the space &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal D}(M)&lt;/math&gt; of smooth functions with compact support on arbitrary (real) smooth manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, and its strong dual space &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal D}'(M)&lt;/math&gt; of distributions on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;,
* the space &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal O}(M)&lt;/math&gt; of holomorphic functions on arbitrary complex manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, and its strong dual space &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal O}'(M)&lt;/math&gt; of analytic functionals on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;,
* the [[Schwartz space]] &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal S}({\mathbb R}^n)&lt;/math&gt; on  &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, and its strong dual space &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal S}'({\mathbb R}^n)&lt;/math&gt; of tempered distributions on &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^n&lt;/math&gt;.

==Stereotype spaces and other versions of reflexivity==
Among all locally convex spaces (even among all Banach spaces) used in [[functional analysis]] the class of reflexive spaces is too narrow to represent a self-sufficient category in any sense.  On the other hand, the idea of duality reflected in this notion is so natural that it gives rise to intuitive expectations that appropriate changes in the definition of reflexivity can lead to another notion, more convenient for some goals of mathematics. One of such goals is the idea of approaching analysis to the other parts of mathematics, like [[algebra]] and [[geometry]], by reformulating its results in the purely algebraic language of [[category theory]].

This program is being worked out in the theory of [[stereotype space]]s, which are defined as [[topological vector space]]s satisfying a similar condition of reflexivity, but with the topology of uniform convergence on [[totally bounded set|totally bounded]] subsets (instead of [[bounded set|bounded]] subsets) in the definition of dual space X’. More precisely, a topological vector space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is called '''stereotype''' if the evaluation map into the '''stereotype second dual  space'''

:&lt;math&gt; J:X\to X^{\star\star},\quad J(x)(f)=f(x),\quad x\in X,\quad f\in X^\star &lt;/math&gt;

is an isomorphism of topological vector spaces. Here the ''stereotype dual space'' &lt;math&gt;X^\star&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the space of continuous linear functionals &lt;math&gt;X'&lt;/math&gt; endowed with the topology of uniform convergence on totally bounded sets in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; (and the ''stereotype second dual space'' &lt;math&gt; X^{\star\star}&lt;/math&gt; is the space dual to &lt;math&gt; X^{\star}&lt;/math&gt; in the same sense).

In contrast to the classical reflexive spaces the class '''Ste''' of stereotype spaces is very wide (it contains, in particular, all [[Fréchet space]]s and thus, all [[Banach space]]s), it forms a [[closed monoidal category]], and it admits standard operations (defined inside of '''Ste''') of constructing new spaces, like taking closed subspaces, quotient spaces, projective and injective limits, the space of operators, tensor products, etc. The category '''Ste''' have applications in duality theory for non-commutative groups.

Similarly, one can replace the class of bounded (and totally bounded) subsets in X in the definition of dual space X’, by other classes of subsets, for example, by the class of compact subsets in X -- the spaces defined by the corresponding reflexivity condition are called ''reflective'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garibay Bonales|first=F. |author2=Trigos-Arrieta, F. J. |author3=Vera Mendoza, R.|title=A characterization of Pontryagin-van Kampen duality for locally convex spaces|journal=Topology and its Applications|year=2002|volume=121|pages=75–89|doi=10.1016/s0166-8641(01)00111-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Akbarov|first=S.

Sbornik|year=2003|volume=194|issue=10|pages=3–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they form an even wider class than '''Ste''', but it is not clear (2012), whether this class forms a category with properties similar to those of '''Ste'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2234">The '''Seneca effect''', or '''Seneca cliff''' or '''Seneca collapse''', is a [[mathematical model]], proposed by [[Ugo Bardi]]. This model is aimed to describe a class of problems in nature in which the decline is faster than growth, under the condition of some constraints. This model is closely related to the work ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' issued by the [[Club of Rome]] in the Seventies&lt;ref&gt;[https://sustainable.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/2763500/MSSI-ResearchPaper-4_Turner_2014.pdf Turner, Graham. Is Global Collapse Imminent?. University of Melbourne, Melbourne Sustainable Society Institute, 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; and its main application is to describe various kind of economics under the condition of shortage of [[fossil fuel]]s, e.g. in relation to the [[Hubbert curve]].

The reference to the Latin philosopher and writer [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] of the model's name lies in the verse: ''the raise is gradual, the ruin is precipitous'' (Lucius Anneus Seneca, ''[[Letters to Lucilius]]'', 91–63).

'''SigSpec''' is an acronym of "SIGnificance SPECtrum" and addresses a statistical technique to provide the reliability of periodicities in a measured (noisy and not necessarily equidistant) [[time series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = P. Reegen | title = SigSpec - I. Frequency- and phase-resolved significance in Fourier space | journal = [[Astronomy and Astrophysics]] | volume = 467 | pages = 1353–1371 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361:20066597 | bibcode=2007A&amp;A...467.1353R|arxiv = physics/0703160 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It relies on the amplitude [[Spectral density|spectrum]] obtained by the [[Discrete Fourier transform]] (DFT) and assigns a quantity called the spectral significance (frequently abbreviated by “'''sig'''”) to each [[amplitude]]. This quantity is a [[logarithm]]ic measure of the [[probability]] that the given amplitude level is due to [[white noise]], in the sense of a [[type I error]]. It represents the answer to the question, “What would be the chance to obtain an amplitude like the measured one or higher, if the analysed time series were [[random]]?”

SigSpec may be considered a formal extension to the [[Least-squares spectral analysis|Lomb-Scargle periodogram]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = N. R. Lomb | title = Least-squares frequency analysis of unequally spaced data | journal = Astrophysics and Space Science | volume = 39 | pages = 447–462 | year = 1976|bibcode = 1976Ap&amp;SS..39..447L |doi = 10.1007/BF00648343 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = J. D. Scargle | title = Studies in astronomical time series analysis. II. Statistical aspects of spectral analysis of unevenly spaced data | doi=10.1086/160554 | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 263 | pages = 835–853 | year = 1982 | bibcode=1982ApJ...263..835S}}&lt;/ref&gt; appropriately incorporating a time series to be averaged to zero before applying the DFT, which is done in many practical applications. When a zero-mean corrected dataset has to be statistically compared to a [[random sample]], the [[Sample mean and sample covariance|sample mean]] (rather than the [[Mean|population mean]] only) has to be zero.

== Probability density function (pdf) of white noise in Fourier space ==

Considering a time series to be represented by a set of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; pairs &lt;math&gt;(t_k,x_k)&lt;/math&gt;, the amplitude [[Probability density function|pdf]] of white noise in [[Fourier space]], depending on [[frequency]] and [[Phase (waves)|phase]] angle may be described in terms of three parameters, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\theta_0&lt;/math&gt;, defining the “sampling profile”, according to

:&lt;math&gt;\tan 2\theta_0 = \frac{K\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}\sin 2\omega t_k - 2\left(\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}\cos\omega t_k\right)\left(\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}\sin\omega t_k\right)}{K\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}\cos 2\omega t_k - \big(\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}\cos\omega t_k\big)^2 + \big(\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}\sin\omega t_k\big)^2},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_0 = \sqrt{\frac{2}{K^2}\left( K\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}\cos ^2\left(\omega t_k-\theta_0\right) -\left[\sum_{l=0}^{K-1}\cos\left(\omega t_k-\theta_0\right)\right]^2\right)},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta_0 = \sqrt{\frac{2}{K^2}\left( K\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}\sin ^2\left(\omega t_k-\theta_0\right) -\left[\sum_{l=0}^{K-1}\sin\left(\omega t_k-\theta_0\right)\right]^2\right)}.&lt;/math&gt;

In terms of the phase angle in Fourier space, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, with

:&lt;math&gt;\tan\theta = \frac{\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}\sin\omega t_k}{\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}\cos\omega t_k},&lt;/math&gt;

the probability density of amplitudes is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\phi (A) = \frac{KA\cdot\operatorname{sock}}{2&lt;x^2&gt;}\exp\left(-\frac{KA^2}{4&lt;x^2&gt;}\cdot\operatorname{sock}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where the sock function is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{sock}(\omega ,\theta) = \left[\frac{\cos^2\left(\theta - \theta_0\right)}{\alpha_0^2}+\frac{\sin^2\left(\theta - \theta_0\right)}{\beta_0^2}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;&lt;x^2&gt;&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[variance]] of the [[Dependent and independent variables|dependent variable]] &lt;math&gt;x_k&lt;/math&gt;.

== False-alarm probability and spectral significance ==

Integration of the pdf yields the false-alarm probability that white noise in the [[time domain]] produces an amplitude of at least &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_\operatorname{FA}(A) = \exp\left(-\frac{KA^2}{4&lt;x^2&gt;}\cdot\operatorname{sock}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The sig is defined as the negative logarithm of the false-alarm probability and evaluates to

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{sig}(A) = \frac{KA^2\log e}{4&lt;x^2&gt;}\cdot\operatorname{sock}.&lt;/math&gt;

It returns the number of random time series one would have to examine to obtain one amplitude exceeding &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; at the given frequency and phase.

== Applications ==

SigSpec is primarily used in [[asteroseismology]] to identify [[variable star]]s and to classify stellar pulsation (see references below). The fact that this method incorporates the properties of the time-domain sampling appropriately makes it a valuable tool for typical astronomical measurements containing data gaps.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1622">'''Spectral layout''' is a class of [[algorithm]] for [[Graph drawing|drawing graphs]]. The layout uses the [[eigenvectors]] of a matrix, such as the [[Laplace matrix]] of the graph, as [[Cartesian coordinate]]s of the graph's vertices.

The idea of the layout is to compute the two largest (or smallest) eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of the laplacian matrix of the graph and then use those for actually placing the nodes.
Usually nodes are placed in the 2 dimensional plane, an embedding into more dimensions can be found by using more eigenvectors.
For actually placing a node from a graph which corresponds to a row/column i in the (symmetric) laplacian matrix, the x-coordinate is the value of the i-th coordinate of the first eigenvector.
Correspondingly the i-th component of the second eigenvector describes the y-coordinate of the point i.

In [[linguistics]], '''statistical semantics''' applies the methods of [[statistics]] to the problem of determining the meaning of words or phrases, ideally through [[unsupervised learning]], to a degree of precision at least sufficient for the purpose of [[information retrieval]]. 

==History==

The term ''statistical semantics'' was first used by [[Warren Weaver]] in his well-known paper on [[machine translation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weaver|1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that [[word sense disambiguation]] for machine translation should be based on the [[co-occurrence]] frequency of the context words near a given target word. The underlying assumption that "a word is characterized by the company it keeps" was advocated by [[J. R. Firth|J.R. Firth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Firth|1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; This assumption is known in [[linguistics]] as the [[distributional hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sahlgren|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emile Delavenay defined ''statistical semantics'' as the "statistical study of meanings of words and their frequency and order of recurrence".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Delavenay|1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[George Furnas|Furnas]] et al. 1983" is frequently cited as a foundational contribution to statistical semantics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Furnas|Landauer|Gomez|Dumais|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An early success in the field was [[latent semantic analysis]].

==Applications==

Research in statistical semantics has resulted in a wide variety of algorithms that use the distributional hypothesis to discover many aspects of [[semantics]], by applying statistical techniques to [[Text corpus|large corpora]]:
* Measuring the [[Semantic similarity|similarity in word meanings]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lund|Burgess|Atchley|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landauer|Dumais|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonald|Ramscar|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Terra|Clarke|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Measuring the similarity in word relations &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turney|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Modeling [[similarity-based generalization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yarlett|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Discovering words with a given relation&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hearst|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Classifying relations between words&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turney|Littman|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Extracting keywords from documents&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frank|Paynter|Witten|Gutwin|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turney|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Measuring the cohesiveness of text&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turney|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Discovering the different senses of words&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pantel|Lin|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Distinguishing the different senses of words&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turney|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Subcognitive aspects of words&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turney|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Distinguishing praise from criticism&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turney|Littman|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related fields==

Statistical semantics focuses on the meanings of common words and the relations between common words, unlike [[text mining]], which tends to focus on whole documents, document collections, or named entities (names of people, places, and organizations). Statistical semantics is a subfield of [[computational semantics]], which is in turn a subfield of [[computational linguistics]] and [[natural language processing]].

Many of the applications of statistical semantics (listed above) can also be addressed by [[lexicon]]-based algorithms, instead of the [[text corpus|corpus]]-based algorithms of statistical semantics. One advantage of corpus-based algorithms is that they are typically not as labour-intensive as lexicon-based algorithms. Another advantage is that they are usually easier to adapt to new languages than lexicon-based algorithms. However, the best performance on an application is often achieved by combining the two approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turney|Littman|Bigham|Shnayder|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12455">In [[functional analysis]] and related areas of [[mathematics]], '''stereotype algebras''' are [[topological algebra]]s defined as [[stereotype space]]s with a (unital and associative) multiplication satisfying the condition of separate uniform continuity on compact sets.

== Definition ==
There are two equivalent ways to define stereotype algebra. 

* '''An abstract definition''': a (projective&lt;ref name=projectivealgebra&gt;There is another notion, an '''injective stereotype algebra''', which is defined as a [[monoid (category theory)|monoid]] in the [[Stereotype space#Category of stereotype spaces|monoidal category ('''Ste''',&lt;math&gt;\odot&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;{\mathbb C}&lt;/math&gt;)]] of stereotype spaces with the dual tensor product, &lt;math&gt;\odot&lt;/math&gt;. The class of these algebras is much narrower.&lt;/ref&gt;) '''stereotype algebra'''{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=271}}{{sfn|Akbarov|2005}} is a [[monoid (category theory)|monoid]] in the [[Stereotype space#Category of stereotype spaces|monoidal category ('''Ste''',&lt;math&gt;\circledast&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;{\mathbb C}&lt;/math&gt;)]] of stereotype spaces with the tensor product &lt;math&gt;\circledast&lt;/math&gt;.

* '''An analytic definition''': let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a [[stereotype space]] (over the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb C&lt;/math&gt; of complex numbers&lt;ref&gt;...or the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; of real numbers&lt;/ref&gt;) and suppose it is endowed with a bilinear operation &lt;math&gt;(x,y)\in A\times A\mapsto x\cdot y\in A&lt;/math&gt; that turns &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; into a [[unital algebra|unital]] and [[associative algebra]] (over the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb C&lt;/math&gt;). Then &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is called a (projective) '''stereotype algebra'''{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=271}}{{sfn|Akbarov|2009|p=483}}{{sfn|Akbarov|2016|p=147}}{{sfn|Akbarov|2017|p=594}} if the multiplication &lt;math&gt;(x,y)\in A\times A\to A&lt;/math&gt; is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_space#Universality_of_'%22%60UNIQ--postMath-0000014E-QINU%60%22' continuous bilinear map in the stereotype sense], i.e. if for each [[compact set]] &lt;math&gt;S\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; and for each neighbourhood of zero &lt;math&gt;U\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; there is a neighbourhood of zero &lt;math&gt;V\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;S\cdot V\subseteq U\quad \&amp;\quad V\cdot S\subseteq U.
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The requirement on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in the analytic definition of stereotype algebra can be equivalently expressed as follows: for each [[compact set]] &lt;math&gt;S\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; and for each [[Net (mathematics)|net]] &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; tending to zero in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;
y_i\overset{A}{\underset{i\to\infty}{\longrightarrow}}0
&lt;/math&gt; 
the nets &lt;math&gt;x\cdot y_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_i\cdot x&lt;/math&gt; tend to zero in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; uniformly on &lt;math&gt;x\in S&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;math&gt;
x\cdot y_i\overset{A}{\underset{x\in S}{\underset{i\to\infty}{\rightrightarrows}}}0
\quad \&amp;\quad y_i\cdot x\overset{A}{\underset{x\in S}{\underset{i\to\infty}{\rightrightarrows}}}0.
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''morphism of stereotype algebras'' &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous unital&lt;ref&gt;A homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\varphi:A\to B&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''unital'' if it preserves unit: &lt;math&gt;\varphi(1_A)=1_B&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\varphi:A\to B&lt;/math&gt;.

Stereotype algebras form a subclass in the class of ''separately continuous'' [[topological algebra]]s.

== Examples ==

:1. All [[Fréchet algebra]]s are stereotype. In particular, all [[Banach algebra]]s are stereotype.{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=272}}  
:2. For each [[stereotype space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; the stereotype space of operators &lt;math&gt;X\oslash X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\varphi:X\to X&lt;/math&gt;, is a stereotype algebra with respect to the operation of composition.{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=272}}
:3. The main examples of ''functional algebras''{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=272}} in Analysis and Geometry are stereotype algebras: 
::* the algebra &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal C}(M)&lt;/math&gt; of [[continuous function]]s on a [[paracompact space|paracompact]] [[locally compact topological space]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, 
::* the algebra &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal E}(M)&lt;/math&gt; of [[smooth function]]s on a [[smooth manifold]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, 
::* the algebra &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal O}(M)&lt;/math&gt; of [[holomorphic function]]s on a [[Stein manifold]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, 
::* the algebra &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal P}(M)&lt;/math&gt; of [[polynomials]] (regular functions) on an [[affine algebraic variety]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. 
:4. [[Group algebra#Stereotype group algebras|Stereotype group algebras]]. In the case when the space &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; in the previous examples has a structure of a [[topological group]], the [[Stereotype space#Definition|dual stereotype spaces]] to the functional algebras on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; are stereotype algebras with respect to the operation of [[convolution#Convolution of measures|convolution]]:{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=272}} 
::* the algebra &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal C}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt; of [[Radon measure]]s with compact support on a [[locally compact group]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is an infinite locally compact group then the algebra &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal C}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt; of measures on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is not a [[Fréchet algebra]]. In the case when &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is compact, &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal C}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Smith space]]. If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-compact, then &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal C}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Brauner space]].&lt;/ref&gt; 
::* the algebra &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal E}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt; of [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]]s with compact support on a [[real Lie group]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, 
::* the algebra &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal O}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt; of holomorphic functionals on a Stein group&lt;ref name=Stein-group&gt;A ''Stein group'' is a [[complex Lie group]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; which is a [[Stein manifold]].&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, 
::* the algebra &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal P}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt; of currents on an [[affine algebraic group]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.
:In contrast to the other models of group algebras in functional analysis, the stereotype group algebras possess the [[Group algebra#Stereotype group algebras|universal property]]&lt;ref&gt;I.e. the homomorphisms of stereotype algebras &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal C}^\star(G)\to A&lt;/math&gt; are in one-to-one correspondence with the continuous representations &lt;math&gt;G\to A&lt;/math&gt; of the group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, and the same is true for the algebras &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal E}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal O}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal P}^\star(G)&lt;/math&gt; with the smooth, holomorphic and polynomial representations of the corresponding groups.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=275}} and the structure of [[Hopf algebra]]{{sfn|Akbarov|2009|p=507}}.

== Stereotype modules ==

A stereotype space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''left stereotype module'' over a stereotype algebra &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, if a bilinear operation &lt;math&gt;(a,x)\in A\times X\mapsto a\cdot x\in X&lt;/math&gt; is defined that turns &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; into a left [[module (mathematics)|module]] over &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, and this operation is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_space#Universality_of_'%22%60UNIQ--postMath-0000014E-QINU%60%22' continuous bilinear map in the stereotype sense]: for each [[compact set]] &lt;math&gt;S\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; and for each neighbourhood of zero &lt;math&gt;U\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; there is a neighbourhood of zero &lt;math&gt;V\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; such that 

&lt;math&gt;
S\cdot V\subseteq U,
&lt;/math&gt;

and at the same time for each [[compact set]] &lt;math&gt;T\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; and for each neighbourhood of zero &lt;math&gt;U\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; there is a neighbourhood of zero &lt;math&gt;W\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; such that 

&lt;math&gt;
W\cdot T\subseteq U.
&lt;/math&gt;

The notion of a ''right stereotype module'' over a stereotype algebra &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is defined by analogy.

The theory of stereotype algebras allows to simplify the formulations in the theory of [[topological algebra]]s and to bring this field closer to [[abstract algebra]]. The following two results (which do not hold for general jointly or separately continuous algebras) are typical illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;Other illustrations are the already mentioned [[Group algebra#Stereotype group algebras|universality property for the stereotype group algebras]]{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=275}} and the structure of [[Hopf algebra]] on them{{sfn|Akbarov|2009|p=507}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theorem'''.{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=283}} ''A stereotype space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with a structure of left (right) module over a stereotype algebra &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a stereotype module over &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if the operation of multiplication &lt;math&gt;(a,x)\in A\times X\mapsto a\cdot x\in X&lt;/math&gt; (respectively, &lt;math&gt;(x,a)\in X\times A\mapsto x\cdot a\in X&lt;/math&gt;) defines a continuous map (a representation) &lt;math&gt;A\to X\oslash X&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;ref&gt;Here &lt;math&gt;X\oslash X&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Stereotype space#Ste as a *-autonomous category|stereotype space of operators &lt;math&gt;\varphi:X\to X&lt;/math&gt;]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theorem'''.{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=289}} ''For each stereotype algebra &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; the categories &lt;sub&gt;&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'''Ste''' and '''Ste'''&lt;sub&gt;&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; of left and right stereotype modules over &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; are [[Enriched category|enriched categories]] over the [[Stereotype space#Ste as a *-autonomous category|monoidal category ('''Ste''',&lt;math&gt;\circledast&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;{\mathbb C}&lt;/math&gt;)]] of stereotype spaces.''

== Applications ==

The notion of stereotype algebra is used in the generalizations{{sfn|Akbarov|2017}} of the [[Pontryagin  duality]] theory to the classes of non-commutative groups based on the notion of [[Envelope (category theory)|envelope]]: the holomorphic, the smooth and the continuous envelopes of stereotype algebras lead respectively to the constructions of the holomorphic, the smooth and the continuous dualities in ''big geometric disciplines'' – [[complex geometry]], [[differential geometry]], and [[topology]] – for certain classes of (not necessarily commutative) topological groups considered in these disciplines ([[affine algebraic group]]s, and some classes of [[Lie group]]s and Moore groups).{{sfn|Akbarov|2009}}{{sfn|Akbarov|2016}}{{sfn|Akbarov|2017}}{{sfn|Kuznetsova|2013}}

'''Steven Paul Kerckhoff''' (born 1952) is a [[professor]] of [[mathematics]] at [[Stanford University]], who works on [[hyperbolic 3-manifold]]s and [[Teichmüller space]]s.  

He received his [[Ph.D.]] in mathematics from [[Princeton University]] in 1978, under the direction of [[William Thurston]].  Among his most famous results is his resolution of the [[Nielsen realization problem]], a 1932 conjecture by [[Jakob Nielsen (mathematician)|Jakob Nielsen]].  Along with [[William Floyd (mathematician)|William J. Floyd]], he wrote large parts of Thurston's influential Princeton lecture notes, and he is well known for his work (some of which is joint with [[Craig Hodgson]]) in exploring and clarifying Thurston's [[hyperbolic Dehn surgery]].  

Kerckhoff is one of four academics from [[Stanford University]], along with [[Gunnar Carlsson]], [[Ralph Cohen]], and [[James Milgram]], who were instrumental in developing the controversial California Mathematics Academic Content Standards for the State Board of Education.

{{technical|date=March 2018}}

In [[computer science]], '''terminal and nonterminal symbols''' are the lexical elements used in specifying the [[production (computer science)|production rule]]s constituting a [[formal grammar]].  ''Terminal symbols'' are the elementary symbols of the [[formal language | language]] defined by a formal grammar.  ''Nonterminal symbols'' (or ''syntactic variables'') are replaced by groups of terminal symbols according to the production rules.

The terminals and nonterminals of a particular grammar are two [[disjoint sets]].

== Terminal symbols ==
Terminal symbols are literal symbols which may appear in the outputs of the production rules of a formal grammar and which cannot be changed using the rules of the grammar. Applying the rules recursively to a source string of symbols will usually terminate in a final output string consisting only of terminal symbols.

Consider a grammar defined by two rules. Using pictoric marks interacting with each other:

# The symbol &lt;code&gt;ר&lt;/code&gt; can become &lt;code&gt;ди&lt;/code&gt; 
# The symbol &lt;code&gt;ר&lt;/code&gt; can become &lt;code&gt;д&lt;/code&gt;
Here &lt;code&gt;д&lt;/code&gt; is a terminal symbol because no rule exists which would change it into something else. On the other hand, &lt;code&gt;ר&lt;/code&gt; has two rules that can change it, thus it is nonterminal. A [[formal language]] defined or ''generated'' by a particular grammar is the set of strings that can be produced by the grammar ''and that consist only of terminal symbols''.

== Nonterminal symbols ==
Nonterminal symbols are those symbols which can be replaced. They may also be called simply ''syntactic variables''. A formal grammar includes a ''start symbol'', a designated member of the set of nonterminals from which all the strings in the language may be derived by successive applications of the production rules. In fact, the language defined by a grammar is precisely the set of ''terminal'' strings that can be so derived.

[[Context-free grammar]]s are those grammars in which the left-hand side of each production rule consists of only a single nonterminal symbol. This restriction is non-trivial; not all languages can be generated by context-free grammars. Those that can are called context-free languages. 
These are exactly the languages that can be recognized by a non-deterministic [[push down automaton]]. Context-free languages are the theoretical basis for the syntax of most [[programming languages]].

== Production rules ==
A grammar is defined by production rules (or just 'productions') that specify which symbols may replace which other symbols; these rules may be used to [[string generation|generate strings]], or to parse them. Each such rule has a ''head'', or left-hand side, which consists of the string that may be replaced, and a ''body'', or right-hand side, which consists of a string that may replace it. Rules are often written in the form ''head'' → ''body''; e.g., the rule ''a'' → ''b'' specifies that ''a'' can be replaced by ''b''.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; a grammar ''G'' consists of the following components:
* A finite set &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of ''nonterminal symbols''.
* A finite set &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; of ''terminal symbols'' that is [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]] from &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;.
* A finite set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; of ''production rules'', each rule of the form
:: &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma \cup N)^{*} N (\Sigma \cup N)^{*} \rightarrow (\Sigma \cup N)^{*} &lt;/math&gt; 
:where &lt;math&gt;{}^{*}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kleene star]] operator and &lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[union (set theory)|set union]], so &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma \cup N)^{*}&lt;/math&gt; represents zero or more symbols, and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; means one ''nonterminal'' symbol. That is, each production rule maps from one string of symbols to another, where the first string contains at least one nonterminal symbol. In the case that the body consists solely of the [[empty string]]&amp;mdash;i.e., that it contains no symbols at all&amp;mdash;it may be denoted with a special notation (often &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;) in order to avoid confusion.
* A distinguished symbol &lt;math&gt;S \in N&lt;/math&gt; that is the ''start symbol''. 
A grammar is formally defined as the ordered quadruple &lt;math&gt;&lt;N, \Sigma, P, S&gt;&lt;/math&gt;. Such a formal grammar is often called a [[rewriting system]] or a [[phrase structure grammar]] in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Seymour|last=Ginsburg|authorlink=Seymour Ginsburg|title=Algebraic and automata theoretic properties of formal languages|publisher=North-Holland|pages=8–9|year=1975|isbn=0-7204-2506-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=Michael A.|authorlink=Michael A. Harrison|title=Introduction to Formal Language Theory|year=1978|pages=13|isbn=0-201-02955-3|location=Reading, Mass.|publisher=Addison-Wesley Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==
For instance, the following represents an integer (which may be signed) expressed in a variant of [[Backus–Naur form]]:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="bnf"&gt;
&lt;digit&gt; ::= '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9'
&lt;integer&gt; ::= ['-'] &lt;digit&gt; {&lt;digit&gt;}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

In this example, the symbols (-,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) are terminal symbols and &lt;digit&gt; and &lt;integer&gt; are nonterminal symbols. 

''Note: This example supports strings with leading zeroes like "0056" or "0000", as well as negative zero strings like "-0" and "-00000".''

Another example is:

S -&gt; cAd

A -&gt; a | ab

In this example, the symbols a,b,c,d are terminal symbols and S,A are nonterminal symbols.

'''Theoretical ecology''' is the scientific discipline devoted to the study of [[ecosystem|ecological systems]] using theoretical methods such as simple [[conceptual model]]s, [[mathematical model]]s, [[computer simulation|computational simulation]]s, and advanced [[data analysis]]. Effective models improve understanding of the natural world by revealing how the dynamics of species populations are often based on fundamental biological conditions and processes. Further, the field aims to unify a diverse range of empirical observations by assuming that common, mechanistic processes generate observable phenomena across species and ecological environments. Based on biologically realistic assumptions, theoretical ecologists are able to uncover novel, non-intuitive insights about natural processes. Theoretical results are often verified by empirical and observational studies, revealing the power of theoretical methods in both predicting and understanding the noisy, diverse biological world.

The field is broad and includes foundations in applied mathematics, computer science, biology, statistical physics, genetics, chemistry, evolution, and conservation biology. Theoretical ecology aims to explain a diverse range of phenomena in the life sciences, such as population growth and [[population dynamics|dynamics]], fisheries, [[biological competition|competition]], evolutionary theory, epidemiology, animal behavior and group dynamics, [[food webs]], ecosystems, spatial ecology, and the effects of climate change.

Theoretical ecology has further benefited from the advent of fast computing power, allowing the analysis and visualization of large-scale computational simulations of ecological phenomena.  Importantly, these modern tools provide quantitative predictions about the effects of human induced environmental change on a diverse variety of ecological phenomena, such as: species invasions, climate change, the effect of fishing and hunting on food network stability, and the global carbon cycle.

==Modelling approaches==

As in most other sciences, mathematical models form the foundation of modern ecological theory.
* Phenomenological models: distill the functional and distributional shapes from observed patterns in the data, or researchers decide on functions and distribution that are flexible enough to match the patterns they or others (field or experimental ecologists) have found in the field or through experimentation.&lt;ref name=Bolker&gt;Bolker BM (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=yULf2kZSfeMC&amp;pg=PA6 ''Ecological models and data in R''] Princeton University Press, pages 6–9. {{ISBN|978-0-691-12522-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mechanistic models: model the underlying processes directly, with functions and distributions that are based on theoretical reasoning about ecological processes of interest.&lt;ref name=Bolker /&gt;

Ecological models can be [[Deterministic model|deterministic]] or [[stochastic]].&lt;ref name=Bolker /&gt;

* Deterministic models always evolve in the same way from a given starting point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sugihara G, May R | year = 1990 | title = Nonlinear forecasting as a way of distinguishing chaos from measurement error in time series | url = http://deepeco.ucsd.edu/~george/publications/90_nonlinear_forecasting.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Nature | volume = 344 | issue = 6268| pages = 734–41 | doi = 10.1038/344734a0 | pmid = 2330029 | bibcode = 1990Natur.344..734S }}&lt;/ref&gt; They represent the average, expected behavior of a system, but lack [[random variation]]. Many [[system dynamics]] models are deterministic.
* Stochastic models allow for the direct modeling of the random perturbations that underlie real world ecological systems. [[Markov process|Markov chain models]] are stochastic.

Species can be modelled in continuous or [[Discrete time|discrete]] time.&lt;ref name=Soetaert&gt;Soetaert K and Herman PMJ (2009) [https://books.google.com/books?id=aVjDtSmJqhAC&amp;pg=PA273&amp;dq=%22continuous+time%22+%22discrete+time%22+ecological&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q=%22continuous%20time%22%20%22discrete%20time%22%20ecological&amp;f=false ''A practical guide to ecological modelling''] Springer. {{ISBN|978-1-4020-8623-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Continuous time is modelled using [[differential equation]]s.
* Discrete time is modelled using  [[difference equation]]s. These model ecological processes that can be described as occurring over discrete time steps. [[Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix algebra]] is often used to investigate the evolution of age-structured or stage-structured populations. The [[Leslie matrix]], for example, mathematically represents the discrete time change of an age structured population.&lt;ref&gt;Grant WE (1986) ''Systems analysis and simulation in wildlife and fisheries sciences.''

Models are often used to describe real ecological reproduction processes of single or multiple species.
These can be modelled using stochastic [[branching process]]es. Examples are the dynamics of interacting populations ([[Theoretical ecology#Predator–prey|predation]] [[Theoretical ecology#Competition .26 mutualism|competition and mutualism]]), which, depending on the species of interest, may best be modeled over either continuous or discrete time. Other examples of such models may be found in the field of [[Epidemic model|mathematical epidemiology]] where the dynamic relationships that are to be modeled are [[Theoretical ecology#Host–pathogen|host–pathogen]] interactions.&lt;ref name=Soetaert /&gt;

[[File:LogisticMap BifurcationDiagram.png|thumb|left|Bifurcation diagram of the logistic map]]

[[Bifurcation theory]] is used to illustrate how small changes in parameter values can give rise to dramatically different long run outcomes, a mathematical fact that may be used to explain drastic ecological differences that come about in qualitatively very similar systems.&lt;ref&gt;Ma T and Wang S (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=dM6fVY65hHsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Bifurcation+theory%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MJLHTZjVHIy2vQPF7ZyQAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Bifurcation theory and applications''] World Scientific. {{ISBN|978-981-256-287-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Logistic map]]s are [[polynomial map]]pings, and are often cited as providing archetypal examples of how [[chaos theory|chaotic behaviour]] can arise from very simple [[non-linear]] dynamical equations. The maps were popularized in a seminal 1976 paper by the theoretical ecologist [[Robert May, Baron May of Oxford|Robert May]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|last=May|authorlink=Robert May, Baron May of Oxford|year=1976|title=Theoretical Ecology: Principles and Applications|publisher=Blackwell Scientific Publishers|isbn=0-632-00768-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference equation is intended to capture the two effects of reproduction and starvation.

In 1930, [[R.A. Fisher]] published his classic ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]'', which introduced the idea that frequency-dependent fitness brings a strategic aspect to [[evolution]], where the payoffs to a particular organism, arising from the interplay of all of the relevant organisms, are the number of this organism' s viable offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |title=The genetical theory of natural selection  |last=Fisher  |first= R. A.  |year=1930 |location= Oxford   |publisher= The Clarendon press  |url=https://archive.org/details/geneticaltheoryo031631mbp }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, [[Richard Lewontin]] applied game theory to evolutionary biology in his ''Evolution and the Theory of Games'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = R C Lewontin |year = 1961 |title = Evolution and the theory of games |journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume = 1 |issue = 3 |pages = 382–403 |doi = 10.1016/0022-5193(61)90038-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
followed closely by [[John Maynard Smith]], who in his seminal 1972 paper, “Game Theory and the Evolution of Fighting",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = John Maynard Smith |year = 1974 |title = Theory of games and evolution of animal conflicts |journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume =47 |issue =1 |pages = 209–21 |doi = 10.1016/0022-5193(74)90110-6 |pmid = 4459582}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined the concept of the [[evolutionarily stable strategy]].

Because ecological systems are typically [[nonlinear]], they often cannot be solved analytically and in order to obtain sensible results, nonlinear, stochastic and computational techniques must be used. One class of computational models that is becoming increasingly popular are the [[agent-based model]]s. These models can simulate the actions and interactions of multiple, heterogeneous, organisms where more traditional, analytical techniques are inadequate. Applied theoretical ecology yields results which are used in the real world. For example, optimal harvesting theory draws on optimization techniques developed in economics, computer science and operations research, and is widely used in [[fisheries]].&lt;ref&gt;Supriatna AK (1998) [https://books.google.com/books?id=njEoLwAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22optimal+harvesting+theory%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Y5THTYraIoa8vgOLhu2tAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA ''Optimal harvesting theory for predator–prey metapopulations''] University of Adelaide, Department of Applied Mathematics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population ecology==
{{main|Population ecology}}
'''Population ecology''' is a sub-field of [[ecology]] that deals with the dynamics of [[species]] [[population]]s and how these populations interact with the [[natural environment|environment]].&lt;ref name="Odum1959"&gt;{{cite book | last =Odum | first =Eugene P. | authorlink =Eugene Odum | title =Fundamentals of Ecology | edition=Second| publisher =W. B. Saunders Co. | year =1959 | location =Philadelphia and London  | isbn = 9780721669410|oclc = 554879 | page =546 p}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the study of how the [[population size]]s of species living together in groups change over time and space, and was one of the first aspects of ecology to be studied and modelled mathematically.

===Exponential growth===
{{Main|Exponential growth}}

The most basic way of modeling population dynamics is to assume that the rate of growth of a population depends only upon the population size at that time and the per capita growth rate of the organism. In other words, if the number of individuals in a population at a time t, is N(t), then the rate of population growth is given by:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dN(t)}{dt}=rN(t) &lt;/math&gt;
where r is the per capita growth rate, or the intrinsic growth rate of the organism.  It can also be described as r = b-d, where b and d are the per capita time-invariant birth and death rates, respectively. This [[Linear differential equation#First order equation|first order]] [[linear differential equation]] can be solved to yield the solution
:&lt;math&gt; N(t) = N(0) \ e^{rt} &lt;/math&gt;,
a trajectory known as [[Malthusian growth]], after [[Thomas Malthus]], who first described its dynamics in 1798. A population experiencing Malthusian growth follows an exponential curve, where N(0) is the initial population size. The population grows when r &gt; 0, and declines when r &lt; 0. The model is most applicable in cases where a few organisms have begun a colony and are rapidly growing without any limitations or restrictions impeding their growth (e.g. bacteria inoculated in rich media).

===Logistic growth===
{{Main|Logistic growth}}

The exponential growth model makes a number of assumptions, many of which often do not hold. For example, many factors affect the intrinsic growth rate and is often not time-invariant. A simple modification of the exponential growth is to assume that the intrinsic growth rate varies with population size. This is reasonable: the larger the population size, the fewer resources available, which can result in a lower birth rate and higher death rate. Hence, we can replace the time-invariant r with r’(t) = (b –a*N(t)) – (d + c*N(t)), where a and c are constants that modulate birth and death rates in a population dependent manner (e.g. [[intraspecific competition]]). Both a and c will depend on other environmental factors which, we can for now, assume to be constant in this approximated model. The differential equation is now:&lt;ref name=Moss&gt;Moss R, Watson A and Ollason J (1982) [https://books.google.com/books?id=l9YOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=%22Logistic+growth%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=y5nHTbS7OoXcvwPC_vSyAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Logistic%20growth%22&amp;f=false ''Animal population dynamics''] Springer, page 52–54. {{ISBN|978-0-412-22240-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dN(t)}{dt}=((b-aN(t))-(d-cN(t)))N(t) &lt;/math&gt;
This can be rewritten as:&lt;ref name=Moss /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dN(t)}{dt}=rN(t) \left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right) &lt;/math&gt;
where r = b-d and K = (b-d)/(a+c).

The biological significance of K becomes apparent when stabilities of the equilibria of the system are considered. The constant K is the [[carrying capacity]] of the population.  The equilibria of the system are N = 0 and N = K. If the system is linearized, it can be seen that N = 0 is an unstable equilibrium while K is a stable equilibrium.&lt;ref name=Moss /&gt;

===Structured population growth===
{{See also|Matrix population models}}

Another assumption of the exponential growth model is that all individuals within a population are identical and have the same probabilities of surviving and of reproducing.  This is not a valid assumption for species with complex life histories.  The exponential growth model can be modified to account for this, by tracking the number of individuals in different age classes (e.g. one-, two-, and three-year-olds) or different stage classes (juveniles, sub-adults, and adults) separately, and allowing individuals in each group to have their own survival and reproduction rates.
The general form of this model is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N}_{t+1} = \mathbf{L}\mathbf{N}_t&lt;/math&gt;
where '''N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''' is a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] of the number of individuals in each class at time ''t'' and '''L''' is a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] that contains the survival probability and fecundity for each class.  The matrix '''L''' is referred to as the [[Leslie matrix]] for [[Age class structure|age-structured]] models, and as the Lefkovitch matrix for [[Ontogeny|stage-structured]] models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hal Caswell |title= Matrix Population Models: Construction, Analysis, and Interpretation |year= 2001 |publisher=Sinauer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If parameter values in '''L''' are estimated from demographic data on a specific population, a structured model can then be used to predict whether this population is expected to grow or decline in the long-term, and what the expected [[population pyramid|age distribution]] within the population will be.  This has been done for a number of species including [[loggerhead sea turtle]]s and [[right whale]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=D.T.Crouse, L.B.

==Community ecology==
{{main|Community ecology}}

An ecological community is a group of trophically similar, [[sympatric]] species that actually or potentially compete in a local area for the same or similar resources.&lt;ref name=Hubbell2001/&gt; Interactions between these species form the first steps in analyzing more complex dynamics of ecosystems.  These interactions shape the distribution and dynamics of species. Of these interactions, predation is one of the most widespread population activities.&lt;ref name="BonsallHassell"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Bonsall |first1= Michael B. |last2= Hassell |first2= Michael P. |editor1-first= Robert |editor1-last= May |editor2-first= Angela |editor2-last= McLean |title= Theoretical Ecology: Principles and Applications |edition=3rd |year= 2007 |publisher= Oxford University Press |pages=46–61 |chapter=Predator–prey interactions}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Taken in its most general sense, predation comprises predator–prey, host–pathogen, and host–parasitoid interactions.

[[File:Cheetah Baboon LV.jpg|thumb|right|Lotka–Volterra model of cheetah–baboon interactions. Starting with 80 baboons (green) and 40 cheetahs, this graph shows how the model predicts the two species numbers will progress over time.]]

===Predator–prey interaction===
[[Predation|Predator–prey]] interactions exhibit natural oscillations in the populations of both predator and the prey.&lt;ref name="BonsallHassell" /&gt; In 1925, the American mathematician [[Alfred J. Lotka]] developed simple equations for predator–prey interactions in his book on biomathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Lotka,  A.J., ''Elements of Physical Biology'', [[Williams and Wilkins]], (1925)&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the Italian mathematician [[Vito Volterra]], made a statistical analysis of fish catches in the Adriatic&lt;ref name="Goelmany"&gt;Goel, N.S. et al., "On the Volterra and Other Non-Linear Models of Interacting Populations", ''Academic Press Inc.'',  (1971)&lt;/ref&gt; and independently developed the same equations.&lt;ref&gt;Volterra, V., "Variazioni e fluttuazioni del numero d’individui in specie animali conviventi", ''[[Accademia dei Lincei|Mem. Acad. Lincei Roma]]'', '''2''', 31-113, (1926)&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the earliest and most recognised ecological models, known as the [[Lotka–Volterra equation|Lotka-Volterra model]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dN(t)}{dt} = N(t)(r-\alpha P(t)) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dP(t)}{dt} = P(t)(c \alpha N(t) -d) &lt;/math&gt;
where N is the prey and P is the predator population sizes, r is the rate for prey growth, taken to be exponential in the absence of any predators, α is the prey mortality rate for per-capita predation (also called ‘attack rate’), c is the efficiency of conversion from prey to predator, and d is the exponential death rate for predators in the absence of any prey.

Volterra originally used the model to explain fluctuations in fish and shark populations after [[fishery|fishing]] was curtailed during the [[First World War]].  However, the equations have subsequently been applied more generally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Begon | first=M. | last2=Harper | first2=J. L. | last3=Townsend | first3=C. R. | year=1988 | title=[[Ecology: Individuals, Populations and Communities]] | publisher=Blackwell Scientific Publications Inc., Oxford, UK }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of these models include the Lotka-Volterra model of the [[snowshoe hare]] and [[Canadian lynx]] in North America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = C.S. Elton |year = 1924 |title = Periodic fluctuations in the numbers of animals - Their causes and effects  |journal = Journal of Experimental Biology  |volume = 2 |issue = 1 |pages = 119–163 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/2/1/119.short}}&lt;/ref&gt; any infectious disease modeling such as the recent outbreak of [[SARS]]

A credible, simple alternative to the Lotka-Volterra predator–prey model and their common prey dependent generalizations is the ratio dependent or [[Arditi-Ginzburg equations|Arditi-Ginzburg model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arditi | first1 = R. | last2 = Ginzburg | first2 = L.R. | year = 1989 | title = Coupling in predator–prey dynamics: ratio dependence | url = http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/ee/ginzburglab/Coupling%20in%20Predator-Prey%20Dynamics%20-%20Arditi%20and%20Ginzburg,%201989.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 139 | issue = 3| pages = 311–326 | doi=10.1016/s0022-5193(89)80211-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two are the extremes of the spectrum of predator interference models.  According to the authors of the alternative view, the data show that true interactions in nature are so far from the Lotka–Volterra extreme on the interference spectrum that the model can simply be discounted as wrong.  They are much closer to the ratio-dependent extreme, so if a simple model is needed one can use the Arditi–Ginzburg model as the first approximation.&lt;ref&gt;Arditi, R. and Ginzburg, L.R. (2012) [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=c2m6XspGs-cC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP2&amp;dq=%22How+Species+Interact:+Altering+the+Standard+View+on+Trophic+Ecology%22&amp;ots=CLPI8KgYU5&amp;sig=5WWhmaSEbWpX9jESMJFI9r2VWsI ''How Species Interact: Altering the Standard View on Trophic Ecology''] Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|9780199913831}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Host–pathogen interaction===
{{See also|Compartmental models in epidemiology}}

The second interaction, that of host and [[pathogen]], differs from predator–prey interactions in that pathogens are much smaller, have much faster generation times, and require a host to reproduce.  Therefore, only the host population is tracked in host–pathogen models.  Compartmental models that categorize host population into groups such as susceptible, infected, and recovered (SIR) are commonly used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Grenfell |first1= Bryan |last2= Keeling |first2= Matthew |editor1-first= Robert |editor1-last= May |editor2-first= Angela |editor2-last= McLean |title= Theoretical Ecology: Principles and Applications |edition=3rd |year= 2007 |publisher= Oxford University Press |pages=132–147 |chapter=Dynamics of infectious disease}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Host–parasitoid interaction===
The third interaction, that of host and [[parasitoid]], can be analyzed by the [[Nicholson-Bailey model]], which differs from Lotka-Volterra and SIR models in that it is discrete in time.  This model, like that of Lotka-Volterra, tracks both populations explicitly.  Typically, in its general form, it states:
:&lt;math&gt; N_{t+1} = \lambda \ N_t \ [ 1 - f(N_t, P_t) ]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; P_{t+1} = c \ N_t \ f(N_t, p_t) &lt;/math&gt;
where f(N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;, P&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) describes the probability of infection (typically, [[Poisson distribution]]), λ is the per-capita growth rate of hosts in the absence of parasitoids, and c is the conversion efficiency, as in the Lotka-Volterra model.&lt;ref name="BonsallHassell" /&gt;

=== Competition and mutualism ===
In studies of the populations of two species, the Lotka-Volterra system of equations has been extensively used to describe dynamics of behavior between two species, N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Examples include relations between ''[[Dictyostelium discoideum|D. discoiderum]]'' and ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=H. M. Tsuchiya |author2=J. F. Drake |author3=J. L. Jost |author4=A. G. Fredrickson  |last-author-amp=yes |year = 1972 |title = Predator–Prey Interactions of ''Dictyostelium discoideum'' and ''Escherichia coli'' in Continuous Culture1 |journal = Journal of Bacteriology |volume = 110 |issue = 3 |pages = 1147–53 |url= http://jb.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/110/3/1147 |pmid = 4555407 |pmc = 247538}}&lt;/ref&gt;
as well as theoretical analysis of the behavior of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Cooperative systems theory and global stability of diffusion models | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/q776827t285410tt/ | journal = Acta Applicandae Mathematicae | volume = 14 | issue = 1–2| pages = 49–57 | doi = 10.1007/BF00046673 | year = 1989 | last1 = Takeuchi | first1 = Y. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dN_1}{dt} = \frac{r_1N_1}{K_1}\left( K_1 - N_1 + \alpha_{12}N_2 \right) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dN_2}{dt} = \frac{r_2N_2}{K_2}\left( K_2 - N_2 + \alpha_{21}N_1 \right) &lt;/math&gt;
The r coefficients give a “base” growth rate to each species, while K coefficients correspond to the carrying capacity.  What can really change the dynamics of a system, however are the α terms.  These describe the nature of the relationship between the two species.  When α&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is negative, it means that N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a negative effect on N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, by competing with it, preying on it, or any number of other possibilities.  When α&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is positive, however, it means that N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a positive effect on N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, through some kind of mutualistic interaction between the two.
When both α&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and α&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; are negative, the relationship is described as [[Biological competition|competitive]].  In this case, each species detracts from the other, potentially over competition for scarce resources.
When both α&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and α&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; are positive, the relationship becomes one of [[mutualism (biology)|mutualism]].  In this case, each species provides a benefit to the other, such that the presence of one aids the population growth of the other.

===Neutral theory===
{{Main|Unified neutral theory of biodiversity}}

[[Unified neutral theory of biodiversity|Unified neutral theory]] is a hypothesis proposed by [[Stephen Hubbell]] in 2001.&lt;ref name=Hubbell2001&gt;{{Cite web
 |author       = Hubbell, SP

 |dead-url     = yes
 |df           = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis aims to explain the diversity and relative abundance of species in ecological communities, although like other [[Unified neutral theory of biodiversity|neutral theories]] in ecology, Hubbell's hypothesis assumes that the differences between members of an ecological community of trophically similar species are "neutral," or irrelevant to their success. Neutrality means that at a given [[trophic level]] in a [[food web]], species are equivalent in birth rates, death rates, dispersal rates and speciation rates, when measured on a per-capita basis.&lt;ref name=Hubbell2005&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1666/0094-8373(2005)031[0122:TNTOBA]2.0.CO;2 | last1 = Hubbell | first1 = S.

J. | title = A test of the unified neutral theory of biodiversity | journal = Nature | volume = 422 | issue = 6934 | pages = 881–885 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12692564 | doi = 10.1038/nature01583| bibcode = 2003Natur.422..881M }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This can be considered a [[null hypothesis]] to [[ecological niche|niche theory]]. The hypothesis has sparked controversy, and some authors consider it a more complex version of other null models that fit the data better.

Under unified neutral theory, complex ecological interactions are permitted among individuals of an [[ecological community]] (such as competition and cooperation), providing all individuals obey the same rules. Asymmetric phenomena such as [[parasite|parasitism]] and [[predator|predation]] are ruled out by the terms of reference; but cooperative strategies such as [[swarming]], and negative interaction such as competing for limited food or light are allowed, so long as all individuals behave the same way. The theory makes predictions that have implications for the management of [[biodiversity]], especially the management of rare species. It predicts the existence of a fundamental biodiversity constant, conventionally written ''θ'', that appears to govern species richness on a wide variety of spatial and temporal scales.

Hubbell built on earlier neutral concepts, including [[Robert MacArthur|MacArthur]] &amp; [[E.O. Wilson|Wilson]]'s theory of [[island biogeography]]&lt;ref name="Hubbell2001"/&gt; and [[Steven Jay Gould|Gould]]'s concepts of symmetry and null models.&lt;ref name=Hubbell2005/&gt;

==Spatial ecology==
{{Main|Spatial ecology}}

===Biogeography===
[[Biogeography]] is the study of the distribution of species in space and time. It aims to reveal where organisms live, at what abundance, and why they are (or are not) found in a certain geographical area.

Biogeography is most keenly observed on islands, which has led to the development of the subdiscipline of [[island biogeography]]. These habitats are often a more manageable areas of study because they are more condensed than larger ecosystems on the mainland. In 1967, [[Robert MacArthur]] and [[Edward Osborne Wilson|E.O. Wilson]] published ''[[The Theory of Island Biogeography]]''. This showed that the species richness in an area could be predicted in terms of factors such as habitat area, immigration rate and extinction rate.&lt;ref&gt;MacArthur RH and Wilson EO (1967) [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=a10cdkywhVgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=biogeography&amp;ots=Rf3VtCTaJC&amp;sig=zrScVPc_Bn9QSyG-PZTPVWUcmKA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The theory of island biogeography'']&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is considered one of the fundamentals of ecological theory.&lt;ref name="Wiens04"&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Wiens |first = J.

==== r/K-selection theory ====
{{Main|r/K selection}}

A population ecology concept is r/K selection theory, one of the first predictive models in ecology used to explain [[Life history theory|life-history evolution]]. The premise behind the r/K selection model is that natural selection pressures change according to [[population densities|population density]]. For example, when an island is first colonized, density of individuals is low. The initial increase in population size is not limited by competition, leaving an abundance of available [[Resource (biology)|resources]] for rapid population growth. These early phases of [[population growth]] experience ''density-independent'' forces of natural selection, which is called ''r''-selection. As the population becomes more crowded, it approaches the island's carrying capacity, thus forcing individuals to compete more heavily for fewer available resources. Under crowded conditions, the population experiences density-dependent forces of natural selection, called ''K''-selection.&lt;ref&gt;First introduced in MacArthur &amp; Wilson's (1967) book of notable mention in the history and theoretical science of ecology, ''[[The Theory of Island Biogeography]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reznick2002"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Reznick |first1=D. |last2=Bryant |first2=M.

===Niche theory===
{{Main|Niche models}}

===Metapopulations===
{{See also|Metapopulation|Patch dynamics}}

Spatial analysis of ecological systems often reveals that assumptions that are valid for spatially homogenous populations – and indeed, intuitive – may no longer be valid when migratory subpopulations moving from one patch to another are considered.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ilkka Hanski|Hanski I]] (1999) [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=jsk4Nt_8X8sC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Metapopulation+ecology&amp;ots=gAWh-tHQ4H&amp;sig=1h2jdIvLZTZ881Dfm7oeFF8cfGU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Metapopulation ecology''] Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-854065-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a simple one-species formulation, a subpopulation may occupy a patch, move from one patch to another empty patch, or die out leaving an empty patch behind. In such a case, the proportion of occupied patches may be represented as
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dp}{dt} = m p (1-p) - e p &lt;/math&gt;
where m is the rate of [[Colonisation (biology)|colonization]], and e is the rate of [[extinction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hanski I, Gilpin M | year = 1991 | title = Metapopulation dynamics: brief history and conceptual domain | url = http://www.helsinki.fi/~ihanski/Articles/Biol_J_Linn_Soc_42.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Biological Journal of the Linnean Society | volume = 42 | issue = | pages = 3–16 | doi = 10.1111/j.1095-8312.1991.tb00548.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, if e &lt; m, the steady state value of p is 1 – (e/m) while in the other case, all the patches will eventually be left empty. This model may be made more complex by addition of another species in several different ways, including but not limited to game theoretic approaches, predator–prey interactions, etc. We will consider here an extension of the previous one-species system for simplicity. Let us denote the proportion of patches occupied by the first population as p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and that by the second as p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Then,
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dp_1}{dt} = m_1 p_1 (1 - p_1) - e p_1 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dp_2}{dt} = m_2 p_2 (1 - p_1 - p_2) - e p_2 - m p_1 p_2 &lt;/math&gt;
In this case, if e is too high, p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will be zero at steady state. However, when the rate of extinction is moderate, p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can stably coexist. The steady state value of p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt; p^*_2 = \frac{e}{m_1} - \frac{m_1}{m_2} &lt;/math&gt;
(p*&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; may be inferred by symmetry).
If e is zero, the dynamics of the system favor the species that is better at colonizing (i.e. has the higher m value). This leads to a very important result in theoretical ecology known as the [[Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis]], where the [[biodiversity]] (the number of species that coexist in the population) is maximized when the disturbance (of which e is a proxy here) is not too high or too low, but at intermediate levels.&lt;ref&gt;Cox CB and Moore PD (2010) [https://books.google.com/books?id=GP5HeCwkV2IC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=%22Intermediate+Disturbance+Hypothesis%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9WrITeqQJZGivgOswZD3BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Intermediate%20Disturbance%20Hypothesis%22&amp;f=false ''Biogeography: An Ecological and Evolutionary Approach''] John Wiley and Sons, page 146. {{ISBN|978-0-470-63794-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The form of the differential equations used in this simplistic modelling approach can be modified. For example:
# Colonization may be dependent on p linearly (m*(1-p)) as opposed to the non-linear m*p*(1-p) regime described above. This mode of replication of a species is called the “rain of propagules”, where there is an abundance of new individuals entering the population at every generation. In such a scenario, the steady state where the population is zero is usually unstable.&lt;ref name=Vandermeer&gt;Vandermeer JH and Goldberg DE (2003) [https://books.google.com/books?id=DXCBTyB2GKIC&amp;pg=PA175&amp;lpg=PA175&amp;dq=%22rain+of+propagules%22+%22rescue+effect%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oHXsO_7VBb&amp;sig=5um9IJmcpj6b_miLe1Dg5KQ9-oE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QGfITYr7DIiKvgOv7_HQBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22rain%20of%20propagules%22%20%22rescue%20effect%22&amp;f=false ''Population ecology: first principles''] Princeton University Press, page 175–176. {{ISBN|978-0-691-11441-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The model can also be extended to combinations of the four possible linear or non-linear dependencies of colonization and extinction on p are described in more detail in.&lt;ref&gt;

==Ecosystem ecology==
{{See also|Ecosystem models}}

Introducing new elements, whether [[Biotic component|biotic]] or [[abiotic]], into [[ecosystem]]s can be disruptive. In some cases, it leads to [[ecological collapse]], [[trophic cascade]]s and the death of many species within the ecosystem. The abstract notion of [[ecological health]] attempts to measure the robustness and recovery capacity for an ecosystem; i.e. how far the ecosystem is away from its steady state. Often, however, ecosystems rebound from a disruptive agent. The difference between collapse or rebound depends on the [[toxicity]] of the introduced element and the [[resilience (ecology)|resiliency]] of the original ecosystem.

If ecosystems are governed primarily by [[stochastic]] processes, through which its subsequent state would be determined by both predictable and random actions, they may be more resilient to sudden change than each species individually. In the absence of a [[balance of nature]], the species composition of ecosystems would undergo shifts that would depend on the nature of the change, but entire ecological collapse would probably be infrequent events. In 1997, [[Robert Ulanowicz]] used [[information theory]] tools to describe the structure of ecosystems, emphasizing [[mutual information]] (correlations) in studied systems. Drawing on this methodology and prior observations of complex ecosystems, Ulanowicz depicts approaches to determining the stress levels on ecosystems and predicting system reactions to defined types of alteration in their settings (such as increased or reduced energy flow, and [[eutrophication]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Ulanowicz (). ''Ecology, the Ascendant Perspective''. Columbia Univ. Press. {{ISBN|0-231-10828-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ecopath]] is a free ecosystem modelling software suite, initially developed by [[NOAA]], and widely used in fisheries management as a tool for modelling and visualising the complex relationships that exist in real world marine ecosystems.

===Food webs===
[[Food web]]s provide a framework within which a complex network of predator–prey interactions can be organised. A food web model is a network of [[food chain]]s. Each food chain starts with a [[primary producer]] or [[autotroph]], an organism, such as a plant, which is able to manufacture its own food. Next in the chain is an organism that feeds on the primary producer, and the chain continues in this way as a string of successive predators. The organisms in each chain are grouped into [[trophic level]]s, based on how many links they are removed from the primary producers. The length of the chain, or trophic level, is a measure of the number of species encountered as energy or nutrients move from plants to top predators.&lt;ref name="Post93"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Post|first=D. M.|title= The long and short of food-chain length|year=1993|journal = Trends in Ecology and Evolution|volume=17|issue=6| pages=269–277|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(02)02455-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Food energy]] flows from one organism to the next and to the next and so on, with some energy being lost at each level.  At a given trophic level there may be one species or a group of species with the same predators and prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Jerry Bobrow, Ph.D.|author2=Stephen Fisher | title= CliffsNotes CSET: Multiple Subjects| year= 2009| edition= 2nd| publisher= John Wiley and Sons| page= 283| url= https://books.google.com/?id=BAaYNjlrJDcC&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=%22are+presumed+to+share+both+predators+and+prey%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22presumed%20to%20share%20both%20predators%20and%20prey%22| isbn= 978-0-470-45546-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, [[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton]] published an influential synthesis on the use of food webs, which resulted in them becoming a central concept in ecology.&lt;ref&gt;Elton CS (1927) Animal Ecology. Republished 2001. University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, interest in food webs increased after [[Robert T. Paine (zoologist)|Robert Paine's]] experimental and descriptive study of intertidal shores, suggesting that food web complexity was key to maintaining species diversity and ecological stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Paine RT | year = 1966 | title = Food web complexity and species diversity | url = | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 100 | issue = 910| pages = 65–75 | doi = 10.1086/282400 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many theoretical ecologists, including [[Robert May, Baron May of Oxford|Sir Robert May]] and [[Stuart Pimm]], were prompted by this discovery and others to examine the mathematical properties of food webs. According to their analyses, complex food webs should be less stable than simple food webs.&lt;ref name=May /&gt;{{rp|75–77}}&lt;ref name=Pimm /&gt;{{rp|64}} The apparent paradox between the complexity of food webs observed in nature and the mathematical fragility of food web models is currently an area of intensive study and debate.

===Systems ecology===
[[Systems ecology]] can be seen as an application of [[general systems theory]] to ecology. It takes a [[holistic]] and interdisciplinary approach to the study of ecological systems, and particularly ecosystems. Systems ecology is especially concerned with the way the functioning of ecosystems can be influenced by human interventions. Like other fields in theoretical ecology, it uses and extends concepts from [[thermodynamics]] and develops other macroscopic descriptions of complex systems. It also takes account of the [[Ecological energetics|energy flows]] through the different [[trophic level]]s in the ecological networks. In systems ecology the principles of ecosystem energy flows are considered formally analogous to the [[principles of energetics]]. Systems ecology also considers the external influence of [[ecological economics]], which usually is not otherwise considered in ecosystem ecology.&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Kitching, ''Systems ecology'', University of Queensland Press, 1983, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; For the most part, systems ecology is a subfield of ecosystem ecology.

==Ecophysiology==
{{main|Ecophysiology}}

This is the study of how "the environment, both physical and biological, interacts with the physiology of an organism. It includes the effects of climate and nutrients on physiological processes in both plants and animals, and has a particular focus on how physiological processes scale with organism size".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nature.com/subjects/ecophysiology Ecophysiology], ''Nature''.

===Swarm behaviour===

{{See also|Swarm models}}

[[Swarm behaviour]] is a [[Collective animal behaviour|collective behaviour]] exhibited by animals of similar size which aggregate together, perhaps milling about the same spot or perhaps [[Animal migration|migrating]] in some direction. Swarm behaviour is commonly exhibited by insects, but it also occurs in the [[flocking (behavior)|flocking]] of birds, the [[shoaling and schooling|schooling]] of fish and the [[herd behaviour]] of quadrupeds. It is a complex [[emergent organization|emergent]] behaviour that occurs when [[Agent-based model in biology|individual agents]] follow simple behavioral rules.

Recently, a number of mathematical models have been discovered which explain many aspects of the emergent behaviour. Swarm algorithms follow a [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] approach or an [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Eulerian]] approach.&lt;ref name="Li et al"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Li YX | year = 2007 | title = Minimal mechanisms for school formation in self-propelled particles | url = http://www.iam.ubc.ca/~lukeman/fish_school_f.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena | volume = 237 | issue = 5 | pages = 699–720 | doi = 10.1016/j.physd.2007.10.009 | name-list-format = vanc | author2 = Lukeman R | author3 = Edelstein-Keshet L | bibcode = 2008PhyD..237..699L }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eulerian approach views the swarm as a [[Field (physics)|field]], working with the density of the swarm and deriving mean field properties.

==Evolutionary ecology==
{{Main|Evolutionary ecology}}

The British biologist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] is best known for independently proposing a theory of [[evolution]] due to [[natural selection]] that prompted [[Charles Darwin]] to publish his own theory. In his famous 1858 paper, Wallace proposed natural selection as a kind of feedback mechanism which keeps species and varieties adapted to their environment.&lt;ref name="Unfinished Business"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The action of this principle is exactly like that of the [[centrifugal governor]] of the steam engine, which checks and corrects any irregularities almost before they become evident; and in like manner no unbalanced deficiency in the animal kingdom can ever reach any conspicuous magnitude, because it would make itself felt at the very first step, by rendering existence difficult and extinction almost sure soon to follow.''&lt;ref name="tendency"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred|title=On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely From the Original Type|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S043.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=2007-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[cybernetics|cybernetician]] and anthropologist [[Gregory Bateson]] observed in the 1970s that, though writing it only as an example, Wallace had "probably said the most powerful thing that’d been said in the 19th Century".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brand|first=Stewart|title=For God’s Sake, Margaret|url=http://www.oikos.org/forgod.htm|publisher=CoEvolutionary Quarterly, June 1976|accessdate=2007-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the connection between natural selection and [[systems theory]] has become an area of active research.&lt;ref name="Unfinished Business"&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Charles H.|title=Wallace's Unfinished Business|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/essays/UNFIN.htm|publisher=Complexity (publisher Wiley Periodicals, Inc.)

==Other theories==
In contrast to previous ecological theories which considered [[floods]] to be catastrophic events, the river [[flood pulse concept]] argues that the annual flood pulse is the most important aspect and the most biologically productive feature of a [[lotic ecosystem|river's ecosystem]].&lt;ref name=thorp&gt;Thorp, J. H., &amp; Delong, M. D. (1994). The Riverine Productivity Model: An Heuristic View of Carbon Sources and Organic Processing in Large River Ecosystems. Oikos , 305-308&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benke, A.

==History==
{{See also|History of ecology}}

Theoretical ecology draws on pioneering work done by [[G. Evelyn Hutchinson]] and his students.  Brothers [[Howard T. Odum|H.T. Odum]] and [[Eugene Odum|E.P. Odum]] are generally recognised as the founders of modern theoretical ecology. [[Robert MacArthur]] brought theory to [[community ecology]].  [[Daniel Simberloff]] was the student of [[E.O. Wilson]], with whom MacArthur collaborated on ''[[The Theory of Island Biogeography]]'', a seminal work in the development of theoretical ecology.&lt;ref name=Cuddington&gt;Cuddington K and Beisner BE (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=5J0MhQaiP-sC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:Ecological+intitle:paradigms+intitle:lost&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=333ITe7UOobEvQPr7eHdBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Ecological paradigms lost: routes of theory change''] Academic Press. {{ISBN|978-0-12-088459-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Simberloff added statistical rigour to experimental ecology and was a key figure in the [[SLOSS debate]], about whether it is preferable to protect a single large or several small reserves.&lt;ref name=Soule&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Soulé ME, Simberloff D | year = 1986 | title = What do genetics and ecology tell us about the design of nature reserves? | url = http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/26318/1/0000405.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Biological Conservation | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages = 19–40 | doi = 10.1016/0006-3207(86)90025-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the supporters of [[Jared Diamond]]'s community assembly rules defending their ideas through Neutral Model Analysis.&lt;ref name=Soule /&gt;  Simberloff also played a key role in the (still ongoing) debate on the utility of corridors for connecting isolated reserves.

[[Stephen Hubbell]] and [[Michael Rosenzweig]] combined theoretical and practical elements into works that extended MacArthur and Wilson's Island Biogeography Theory - Hubbell with his [[Unified neutral theory of biodiversity|Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity and Biogeography]] and Rosenzweig with his Species Diversity in Space and Time.

A [[cubic graph]] with 14 vertices embedded on a [[torus]]]] 

In [[mathematics]], a '''toroidal graph''' is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] that can be [[Graph embedding|embedded]] on a [[torus]]. In other words, the graph's [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] can be placed on a torus such that no edges cross.

==Examples==
Any graph which can be embedded in a plane can also be embedded in a torus. A toroidal graph of [[Genus (mathematics)|genus]] 1 can be embedded in a torus but not in a plane. The [[Heawood graph]], the [[complete graph]] K&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (and hence K&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and K&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), the [[Petersen graph]] (and hence the [[complete bipartite graph]] K&lt;sub&gt;3,3&lt;/sub&gt;, since the Petersen graph contains a subdivision of it), one of the [[Blanuša snarks]],{{sfnp|Orbanić|Pisanski|Randić|Servatius|2004}} and all [[Möbius ladder]]s are toroidal. More generally, any graph with [[crossing number (graph theory)|crossing number]] 1 is toroidal. Some graphs with greater crossing numbers are also toroidal: the [[Möbius–Kantor graph]], for example, has crossing number 4 and is toroidal.{{sfnp|Marušič|Pisanski|2000}}

==Properties==
Any toroidal graph has [[chromatic number]] at most 7.{{sfnp|Heawood|1890}} The [[complete graph]] K&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; provides an example of toroidal graph with chromatic number 7.{{sfnp|Chartrand|Zhang|2008}}

Any [[Triangle-free graph|triangle-free]] toroidal graph has chromatic number at most 4.{{sfnp|Kronk|White|1972}}

By a result analogous to [[Fáry's theorem]], any toroidal graph may be [[graph drawing|drawn]] with straight edges in a rectangle with [[periodic boundary conditions]].{{sfnp|Kocay|Neilson|Szypowski|2001}}  Furthermore, the analogue of [[Tutte's spring theorem]] applies in this case.{{sfnp|Gortler|Gotsman|Thurston|2006}}
Toroidal graphs also have [[book embedding]]s with at most 7 pages.{{sfnp|Endo|1997}}

==Obstructions==
By the [[Robertson–Seymour theorem]], there exists a finite set ''H'' of minimal non-toroidal graphs, such that a graph is toroidal if and only if it has no [[graph minor]] in ''H''.
That is, ''H'' forms the set of [[forbidden graph characterization|forbidden minors]] for the toroidal graphs.
The complete set ''H'' is not known, but it has at least 17,523 graphs. Alternatively, there are at least 250,815 non-toroidal graphs that are minimal in the [[topological minor]] ordering.
A graph is toroidal if and only if it has none of these graphs as a topological minor.{{sfnp|Myrvold|Woodcock|2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2658">In [[probability theory]], the '''total variation distance''' is a distance measure for probability distributions. It is an example of a [[statistical distance]] metric, and is sometimes called the '''statistical distance''' or '''variational distance'''.

==Definition==
The total variation distance between two [[probability measure]]s ''P'' and ''Q'' on a [[sigma-algebra]] ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;'' of [[subset]]s of the sample space &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is defined via&lt;ref name=Chatterjee2007&gt;{{cite web|last=Chatterjee |first=Sourav |title=Distances between probability measures |url=http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~sourav/Lecture2.pdf |publisher=UC Berkeley |accessdate=21 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708205758/http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/%7Esourav/Lecture2.pdf |archivedate=July 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\delta(P,Q)=\sup_{ A\in \mathcal{F}}\left|P(A)-Q(A)\right|. &lt;/math&gt;
Informally, this is the largest possible difference between the probabilities that the two [[probability distribution]]s can assign to the same event.

==Properties==

=== Relation to other distances ===
The total variation distance is related to the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]] by [[Pinsker's inequality]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta(P,Q) \le \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} D_{\mathrm{KL}}(P\parallel Q)}.&lt;/math&gt;

When the set is countable, the total variation distance is related to the L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; norm by the identity:&lt;ref&gt;David A. Levin Yuval Peres, Elizabeth L. Wilmer, 'Markov Chains and Mixing Times', 2nd. rev. ed. (AMS, 2017), Proposition 4.2, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\delta(P, Q)=\frac12\|P-Q\|_1=\frac12\sum_{\omega\in\Omega}|P(\omega)-Q(\omega)|.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Connection to [[Transportation theory (mathematics)|transportation theory]] ===
The total variation distance (or half the norm) arises as the optimal transportation cost, when the cost function is &lt;math&gt;c(x,y) = {\mathbf{1}}_{x \neq y}&lt;/math&gt;, that is,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} \| P - Q \|_1 = \delta(P,Q) = \inf_\pi \operatorname{E}[{\mathbf{1}}_{P\neq Q}],&lt;/math&gt;

where the infimum is taken over all &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; probability distributions with marginals &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, respectively&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-540-71050-9|title=Optimal Transport, Old and New|last=Villani|first=Cédric|publisher=Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg|year=2009|isbn=978-3-540-71049-3|location=|pages=22|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-71050-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''WORHP''' ({{IPAc-en|w|ɔːr|p}} "warp"), also referred to as '''eNLP''' (European [[Nonlinear programming|NLP]] solver) by [[ESA]], is a mathematical software [[Library (computing)|library]] for solving continuous large scale [[nonlinear optimization]] problems numerically. The acronym WORHP is sometimes spelled out as "'''W'''e '''O'''ptimize '''R'''eally '''H'''uge '''P'''roblems", its primary intended application. WORHP is a hybrid [[Fortran#Fortran 2003|Fortran]] and [[C (programming language)|C]] implementation and can be used from C/[[C++]] and Fortran programs using different interfaces of varying complexity and flexibility. In addition interfaces for the modelling environments [[MATLAB]], [[CasADi]] and [[AMPL]] exist.&lt;ref name="Interfaces"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worhp.de/content/interfaces |title=WORHP interfaces}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Problem formulation ==
WORHP is designed to solve problems of the form
::: &lt;math&gt;\min_{x \in \R^n} f(x)&lt;/math&gt;
:subject to
::: &lt;math&gt;L \leq \begin{pmatrix} x \\ g(x) \end{pmatrix} \leq U &lt;/math&gt;
with sufficiently smooth functions &lt;math&gt;f:\R^n \to \R&lt;/math&gt; (objective) and &lt;math&gt;g:\R^n \to \R^m&lt;/math&gt; (constraints) that may be nonlinear, and need not necessarily be convex. Even problems with large dimensions &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; can be solved efficiently, if the problem is sufficiently sparse.
Cases where objective and constraints cannot be evaluated separately, or where constraints can be evaluated element-wise can be exploited by WORHP to increase the computational efficiency.

=== Derivatives ===
WORHP requires the first [[derivative]] ([[Gradient]]) of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; ([[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]]) and second derivatives ([[Hessian matrix]]) of the [[Lagrange function]]; in a modelling environment like AMPL, these are provided by [[automatic differentiation]] methods, but need to be provided by the caller in other environments. First and second derivatives can be approximated by WORHP using [[finite differences]]. To reduce the otherwise prohibitively high number of necessary function evaluations in large scale [[sparse matrix|sparse]] problems, [[graph colouring]] theory is used to group first and second partial derivatives. Second derivatives may also be approximated using variations of the classic [[BFGS method]], including block-diagonal or sparse BFGS matrices.

== Structure ==
The NLP level of WORHP is based on [[Sequential quadratic programming|SQP]], while the quadratic subproblems are solved using an [[interior point method]]. This approach was chosen to benefit from the robustness of SQP methods and the reliable runtime complexity of IP methods, since traditional [[active set]] methods may be unsuitable for large-scale problems.

== Development ==
Development of WORHP started in 2006 with funding from [[German Aerospace Center|DLR]] and was continued under the ''eNLP'' label after 2008 with support by ESA / [[European Space Research and Technology Centre|ESTEC]] together with the Interior-Point solver ipfilter&lt;ref name="ipfilter"&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.mat.uc.pt/ipfilter |title=ipfilter — An NLP Solver based on a primal-dual interior-point filter algorithm |author1=Luis Vicente |author2=Renata Silva |author3=Michael Ulbrich |author4=Stefan Ulbrich }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
(whose inclusion in eNLP was discontinued after 2010) to develop a European NLP solver for use in trajectory optimisation, mission analysis and aerospace applications in general.&lt;ref name="eNLP talk"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of WORHP is led by the [http://www.stw.de/su/1118 Steinbeis-Forschungszentrum Optimierung, Steuerung und Regelung] and scientists of the [http://www.math.uni-bremen.de/zetem/o2c/en Optimization and Optimal Control Group] at the [[University of Bremen]], and at the [[Bundeswehr University of Munich]].&lt;ref name="Development Team"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worhp.de/content/team-worhp |title=Development Team |accessdate=2013-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The developers stress that WORHP, despite its academic roots, is intended as industrial-grade tool rather than an academic research platform.&lt;ref name="The ESA NLP Solver WORHP"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
WORHP has been integrated into trajectory analysis tools such as LOTNAV&lt;ref name="LOTNAV"&gt;
{{cite web |bibcode=2004ESASP.548..609C |title=Navigation and Guidance for Low-Thrust Trajectories, LOTNAV  |author1=J. L. Cano |author2=M. Bello |author3=J. Rodriguez-Canabal |year=2004}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
and [[ASTOS]], and is being used at [[European Space Operations Centre|ESOC]] and [[European Space Research and Technology Centre|ESTEC]]. It can be used as optimiser in CasADi (since version 1.5.0beta)&lt;ref name="CasADi"&gt;
{{cite web |url=https://github.com/casadi/casadi/wiki |title=CasADi wiki |accessdate=2013-05-27}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1287">The '''Wilson quotient''' ''W''(''p'') is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;W(p) = \frac{(p-1)! + 1}{p}&lt;/math&gt;

If ''p'' is a [[prime number]], the quotient is an [[integer]] by [[Wilson's theorem]]; moreover, if ''p'' is composite, the quotient is not an integer. If ''p'' divides ''W''(''p''), it is called a [[Wilson prime]]. The integer values of ''W''(''p'') are {{OEIS|id=A007619}}:

: ''W(2)=1''
: ''W(3)=1''
: ''W(5)=5''
: ''W(7)=103''
: ''W(11)=329891''
: ''W(13)=36846277''
: ''W(17)=1230752346353''
: ''W(19)=336967037143579''

:&lt;math&gt;W(p)\equiv B_{2(p-1)}-B_{p-1}\pmod{p},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p-1+ptW(p)\equiv pB_{t(p-1)}\pmod{p^2},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;B_k&lt;/math&gt; is the ''k''-th Bernoulli number. Note that the first relation comes from the second one by subtraction, after substituting &lt;math&gt;t=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t=2&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[mathematics]], a '''zero''', also sometimes called a '''root''', of a real-, complex- or generally [[vector-valued function]] &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a member &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of the [[Domain of a function|domain]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; ''vanishes'' at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;; that is, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a [[solution (equation)|solution]] of the [[equation]] &lt;math&gt;f(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;.
In other words, a "zero" of a function is an input value that produces an output of &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Foerster"&gt;{{cite book | last = Foerster | first = Paul A. | title = Algebra and Trigonometry: Functions and Applications, Teacher's Edition | edition = Classics | year = 2006 | page = 535 | publisher = [[Prentice Hall]] | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ | url = https://www.amazon.com/Algebra-Trigonometry-Functions-Applications-Prentice/dp/0131657100 | isbn = 0-13-165711-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''root''' of a [[polynomial]] is a zero of the corresponding [[polynomial function]].
The [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] shows that any non-zero [[polynomial]] has a number of roots at most equal to its [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]] and that the number of roots and the degree are equal when one considers the [[complex number|complex]] roots (or more generally the roots in an [[algebraically closed extension]]) counted with their [[multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicities]]. For example, the polynomial &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; of degree two, defined by 
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^2-5x+6&lt;/math&gt;
has the two roots &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt;, since
:&lt;math&gt;f(2) = 2^2 - 5 \cdot 2 + 6 = 0\quad\textrm{and}\quad f(3) = 3^2 - 5 \cdot 3 + 6 = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

If the function maps [[real number]]s to real numbers, its zeros are the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-coordinates of the points where its [[Graph of a function|graph]] meets the [[x-axis|''x''-axis]].  An alternative name for such a point &lt;math&gt;(x,0)&lt;/math&gt; in this context is an &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-intercept.

==Solution of an equation==
Every [[equation]] in the [[unknown (mathematics)|unknown]] {{math|''x''}} may be rewritten as
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;
by regrouping all terms in the left-hand side. It follows that the solutions of such an equation are exactly the zeros of the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, "zero of a function" is a phrase denoting a "solution of the equation obtained by equating the function to 0," and the study of zeros of functions is exactly the same as the study of solutions of equations.

== Polynomial roots ==
{{main|Properties of polynomial roots}}
Every real polynomial of odd [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]] has an odd number of real roots (counting [[Multiplicity (mathematics)#Multiplicity of a root of a polynomial|multiplicities]]); likewise, a real polynomial of even degree must have an even number of real roots. Consequently, real odd polynomials must have at least one real root (because one is the smallest odd whole number), whereas even polynomials may have none. This principle can be proven by reference to the [[intermediate value theorem]]: since polynomial functions are [[Continuous function|continuous]], the function value must cross zero in the process of changing from negative to positive or vice versa.

===Fundamental theorem of algebra===
{{main|Fundamental theorem of algebra}}
The fundamental theorem of algebra states that every polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; complex roots, counted with their multiplicities. The non-real roots of polynomials with real coefficients come in [[complex conjugate|conjugate]] pairs.&lt;ref name="Foerster" /&gt; [[Vieta's formulas]] relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots.

== Computing roots ==
{{main|Root-finding algorithm|Equation solving}}
Computing roots of functions, for example [[polynomial function]]s, frequently requires the use of specialised or [[approximation]] techniques (for example, [[Newton's method]]). However, some polynomial functions, including all those of [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] no greater than 4, can have all their roots expressed [[algebraic function|algebraically]] in terms of their coefficients. (See [[algebraic solution]].)

==Zero set==

In various areas of mathematics, the '''zero set''' of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] is the set of all its zeros. More precisely, if &lt;math&gt;f:X\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[real-valued function]] (or, more generally, a function taking values in some [[Abelian group|additive group]]), its zero set is &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(0)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the [[inverse image]] of &lt;math&gt;\{0\}&lt;/math&gt;).

The term ''zero set'' is generally used when there are infinitely many zeros, and they have some non-trivial [[topology|topological properties]]. For example, a [[level set]] of a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the zero set of &lt;math&gt;f-c&lt;/math&gt;. The '''cozero set''' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of the zero set of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., the subset of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; on which &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is nonzero).

=== Applications ===
In [[algebraic geometry]], the first definition of an [[algebraic variety]] is through zero sets. Specifically, an [[affine algebraic set]] is the [[set intersection|intersection]] of the zero sets of several polynomials in a [[polynomial ring]] &lt;math&gt;k\left[x_1,\ldots,x_n\right]&lt;/math&gt; over a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. In this context, a zero set is sometimes called a ''zero locus''.

In analysis and geometry, any [[closed set|closed subset]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is the zero set of a [[smooth function]] defined on all of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. This extends to any [[smooth manifold]] as a corollary of [[paracompactness]]. &lt;!-- There is obvious overlap between this and the next paragraph, but it takes someone more experienced to merge the two. --&gt;

In [[differential geometry]], zero sets are frequently used to define [[manifold]]s. An important special case is the case that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a [[smooth function]] from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^p&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. If zero is a [[regular value]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, then the zero set of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a smooth manifold of dimension &lt;math&gt;m=p-n&lt;/math&gt; by the [[regular value theorem]].

For example, the unit &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;-[[sphere]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{m+1}&lt;/math&gt; is the zero set of the real-valued function &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\vert x \vert^2-1&lt;/math&gt;.
