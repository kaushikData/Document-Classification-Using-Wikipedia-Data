[[Image:KualaLumpurAbdulSamadBldg.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Sultan Abdul Samad Building]] housed the [[Courts of Malaysia|Supreme Court]] at the time of the 1988 Malaysian constitutional crisis.]]

The '''1988 Malaysian constitutional crisis''' (also known as the '''1988 judicial crisis''') was a series of events that began with [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO) party elections in 1987 and ended with the suspension and the eventual removal of the [[Lord President of the Federal Court|Lord President of the Supreme Court]], [[Malay titles|Tun]] [[Salleh Abas]], from his seat. The [[Courts of Malaysia|Supreme Court]] in the years leading up to 1988 had been increasingly independent of the other branches of the government. Matters then came to a head when [[Mahathir Mohamad]], who believed in the supremacy of the executive and legislative branches, became [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]].&lt;ref name="Means, p. 237"&gt;Means, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; Many saw his eventual sacking of Salleh Abas and two other Supreme Court judges as the end of judicial independence in Malaysia.

Since 1988, there have been regular calls for an official review of the government's actions throughout the crisis. In 2008, newly appointed ''de facto'' Law Minister [[Zaid Ibrahim]] said the government had to make an open apology to the sacked judges, calling the government's actions during the crisis "inappropriate". Not long after, Prime Minister [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]] called the crisis one which the nation had never recovered from, and announced ''[[ex gratia]]'' compensation for the sacked and suspended judges.

==Judicial intervention in a political dispute==
{{History of Malaysia}}
{{see also|United Malays National Organisation leadership election, 1987}}
In 1987, the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO) — a leading party in the governing [[Barisan Nasional]] coalition — held elections for its numerous offices. For the first time in twelve years, the incumbent President, Mahathir, was challenged. Tengku [[Razaleigh Hamzah]] was the candidate of "Team B" for the Presidency, taking on Mahathir, whose camp was labelled "Team A".&lt;ref&gt;Means, Gordon P. (1991). ''Malaysian Politics: The Second Generation'', p. 201. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-588988-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There was an intense campaign to win the support of the roughly 1,500 delegates from party branches all over the country, who would elect the party officers. Razaleigh's supporters expected him to win, and at the UMNO General Assembly shortly after the votecounting was completed, rumours spread that Razaleigh had won. However, the official results declared Mahathir the winner, with 761 votes to Razaleigh's 718. The Team A candidate for Deputy President, [[Ghafar Baba]], defeated [[Musa Hitam]] of Team B as well, and 16 of the 25 seats on the UMNO Supreme Council also went to Team A.&lt;ref&gt;Means, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

Razaleigh's supporters were upset by the election, which they insisted had to have been rigged. Their anger was exacerbated by Mahathir, who went on to purge all Team B members from the Cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;Means, pp. 204–205.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, 12 UMNO members filed a [[lawsuit]] in the High Court, seeking a court order to void the election results and pave the way for a new election. The plaintiffs alleged that 78 of the delegates had been selected by branches not registered with the Registrar of Societies, and as a result were not eligible to vote. They also claimed that certain documents related to the election had been "tampered with". Although Razaleigh was not among the twelve plaintiffs, he was widely believed to be funding and co-ordinating the suit.&lt;ref&gt;Means, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, one of the twelve withdrew from the case, but the remaining eleven continued to press on. The High Court eventually gave the parties a two-week deadline to reach an out of court settlement. An UMNO "Unity Panel" was formed to handle the negotiations and reach a compromise. However, it soon became clear that the differences were intractable — Team B would settle for no less than a new election, while Team A insisted that the suit be withdrawn and a "face-saving" solution be reached which would allow some Team B members to remain in the party. Eventually the eleven plaintiffs declared they would seek a final judgement from the court.&lt;ref&gt;Means, pp. 215–216.&lt;/ref&gt;

This did not please Mahathir, who had clashed on several previous occasions with the judiciary. In one instance, a government order revoking the work permits of two foreign [[journalist]]s critical of the government had been over-ruled by the Supreme Court. Mahathir began making heated attacks on the judiciary, telling ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', "''The judiciary says, 'Although you passed a law with a certain thing in mind, we think that your mind is wrong, and we want to give our interpretation.' If we disagree, the Courts will say, 'We will interpret your disagreement.' If we [the government and [[Parliament of Malaysia|Parliament]]] go along, we are going to lose our power of legislation.''" &lt;ref&gt;Means, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; Mahathir also lashed out at "black sheep [judges] ... who want to be ... fiercely independent," accusing them of playing to public opinion. Immediately after this latter statement, the government reassigned several High Court judges to different divisions, including Justice [[Harun Hashim]] who was then hearing the UMNO case. However, as the latter case was already in progress, Harun's transfer would not take effect until the case closed.&lt;ref&gt;Means, pp. 217–218.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harun was thus forced to make the final call on the case of the "UMNO 11". Although most of the evidence they had presented was not contested, the UMNO defence argued that not all possible remedies within UMNO had been exhausted. The plaintiffs, however, insisted that the fact that at least 30 unregistered branches had sent delegates to the UMNO elections should have been enough to nullify their results. In the end, Harun dismissed the suit, citing Article 41 of the Societies Act 1966, which stated any society would automatically become "unlawful" if any of its branches were not registered with the Registrar of Societies. As a result, Harun declared he had no choice but to declare UMNO "an unlawful society", thereby rendering "[w]hat happened in 1987" a nullity. In his decision, Harun blamed Parliament for forcing his hand: "If the old law was in existence... [one could] apply the [[common law]] principle, but here it seems the Parliament, to ensure strict compliance with the law, has made this provision look harsh."&lt;ref&gt;Means, pp. 218–219.&lt;/ref&gt;

As soon as the decision was made public, Mahathir assured UMNO members that as the decision was based on minor "technicalities", the party could easily be restored as a lawful society. He also reminded the public that this did not threaten his status as Prime Minister, as only a [[no-confidence vote]] could lawfully remove him from power.&lt;ref&gt;Means, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Within a fortnight of Harun's decision, Mahathir announced the registration of UMNO Baru (New UMNO). UMNO Baru's leadership was almost entirely composed of Team A members, who proceeded to spend the next few months transferring the assets of the "old" UMNO to UMNO Baru.&lt;ref&gt;Means, pp. 224, 225, 226.&lt;/ref&gt; The UMNO 11 pursued their case to the highest court in the land, the Supreme Court, still seeking to hold new elections for the "old" UMNO and having its lawful status restored. However, their appeal was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Means, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; Razaleigh then decided to form a new party focused on the "spirit of 1946" — the year UMNO had been founded.&lt;ref&gt;Means, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; UMNO Baru in turn decided that the "Baru" was superfluous, and officially dropped it from its name, in effect claiming to be the true successor to UMNO instead of Razaleigh's party, which would eventually call itself [[Semangat 46]] (Spirit of 46).&lt;ref&gt;Means, p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional amendments==
The "UMNO 11" case was just one of a number which had irritated Mahathir and the government. The case of the two journalists mentioned earlier had begun when [[John Berthelsen]] and [[Raphael Pura]] authored a series of articles on financial transactions of dubious ethical and legal nature carried out by government officials. The ''[[Asian Wall Street Journal]]'' which published them was promptly banned from the country, and Mahathir in his capacity as Home Affairs Minister had Berthelsen's and Pura's work permits revoked. However, the Supreme Court overturned the cancellation of Berthelsen's work permit because he had not been given a chance to answer the charges of the government. As a result, the ban on the ''Asian Wall Street Journal'' was also lifted.&lt;ref&gt;Means, p. 140, 236.&lt;/ref&gt; In a different case, the Supreme Court used its power of [[judicial review]], and nullified amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code which gave the Attorney-General the power to initiate criminal proceedings in the High Court without first going to a Magistrate's Court. After [[Operation Lalang]] in 1987, where the government detained several political dissidents without trial under the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]] (ISA), the High Court granted [[Karpal Singh]]'s application to be released from detention due to  technicalities in the way he had been detained.&lt;ref&gt;Means, pp. 236–237.&lt;/ref&gt;

This last case did it for Mahathir. The following week, he submitted several constitutional amendments to Parliament, divesting the courts of the "judicial power of the Federation" and giving them only such judicial powers as Parliament might grant them. In justifying the amendments, Mahathir stated: "...the courts have decided that in enforcing the law they are bound by their interpretations and not by the reasons for which Parliament formulated these laws ... lately the judiciary had seen fit to touch on matters which were previously regarded as solely within the executive's jurisdiction."&lt;ref name="Means, p. 237"/&gt;

The Lord President of the Supreme Court, Tun [[Salleh Abas]], was pressured by his fellow judges to respond to the government's actions. Salleh decided to convene a meeting of all 20 judges from the Supreme and High Courts in the capital of [[Kuala Lumpur]]. At the meeting, they agreed not to publicly reply to Mahathir's criticisms. Instead, they wrote a confidential letter to the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] (King) and the Malay rulers, expressing their grievances. The proposed letter, which was unanimously approved, was written by Salleh Abas. The letter stated the judges' disappointment "with the various comments and accusations made by the Honourable Prime Minister against the Judiciary," but did not demand specific action be taken — instead, it ended with an expression of "hope that all those unfounded accusations will be stopped".&lt;ref&gt;Means, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suspension and removal of Tun Salleh Abas and other judges==
In 1988, Tun Salleh Abas was brought before a tribunal convened by the then Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohammad on the grounds of misconduct. The tribunal was chaired by Tun Hamid Omar. In response to the tribunal, Tun Salleh Abas filed a suit in the High Court in Kuala Lumpur to challenge the constitutionality of the tribunal. While proceeding with the suit, Tun Salleh Abas applied for an interim stay against the tribunal until 4 July 1988. The request was denied.

Later however, five judges of the Supreme Court convened and granted Tun Salleh Abas an interlocutory order against the tribunal. Upon receiving the order, Tun Salleh Abas' solicitors proceed to the Parliament to present the chairman of the tribunal the interlocutory order. The gate leading to the Parliament however was locked and Tun Salleh Abas' representative had to call in the police to be guaranteed a passage into the [[Parliament of Malaysia|Parliament]]. Eventually, the order was presented to the tribunal chairman.

Soon after, the five judges were suspended. The judges were Tan Sri Azmi Kamaruddin, Tan Sri [[Eusoffe Abdoolcader]], Tan Sri Wan Hamzah Mohamed Salleh, Tan Sri Wan Suleiman Pawanteh and Datuk George Seah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaysia-today.net/Blog-n/2006/09/sallehs-case-is-closed.htm "Salleh’s case is closed"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007182220/http://www.malaysia-today.net/Blog-n/2006/09/sallehs-case-is-closed.htm |date=7 October 2007 }}, ''The Star''. Accessed 15 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This effectively suspended the Supreme Court. With the Supreme Court suspended, the challenge toward the legality of the tribunal could not be heard. The tribunal later removed Tun Salleh Abas from his office. Tan Sri Wan Sulaiman and Datuk George Seah were also removed from office. The other three judges were later reinstated.

The irregular dismissal of Tun Salleh Abas led the Bar Council of Malaysia refusing to recognise the new Lord President. Around the same time, the Federal Constitution was amended to divest the courts of the "judicial power of the Federation", granting them instead such judicial powers as Parliament might grant them.

==Legacy==
A major critic to Mahathir's actions include Malaysia's first Prime Minister, [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]]. In a New York Times article, he was said to be "disgusted" at the actions. His views however were criticised by the then Education Minister, [[Anwar Ibrahim]], who claimed that the Tunku was ″a grand old man who has done his bit.″&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kamm|first1=Henry|title=Malaysian Founder 'Disgusted' at Successor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/08/world/malaysian-founder-disgusted-at-successor.html|accessdate=31 March 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=July 8, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahathir's supporters insisted that it had liberated the Malaysian judiciary from a colonial mindset. The sacking of several justices was justified by claims that these judges had been abusing public funds for their personal expenses — such as the purchase of luxury furniture from [[Italy]]. It was also claimed that the sackings had eliminated deadwood and improved efficiency in the courts, as evinced by a reduction in their backlog.&lt;ref&gt;Maidin, Zainuddin (1994). ''The Other Side of Mahathir'', pp. 99, 101. Utusan Publications &amp; Distributors. {{ISBN|967-61-0486-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Call to revisit the case==

Mahathir Mohammed stepped down from the premiership in 2003, having chosen [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]] to succeed him. In 2006, the relationship between the two became less than warm as Mahathir started to criticise the latter's policies. During this period, many begin calling for the judiciary or government to review the decision against the sacked judges. Among the loudest advocates of the review was Tun Salleh Abas himself. The administration dismissed such calls. Minister in the Prime Minister's Department [[Nazri Aziz]], who was then ''de facto'' Law Minister, said that he was not convinced of the need to review the case.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Goh. [https://web.archive.org/web/20090213212944/http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2006%2F9%2F12%2Fnation%2F15405219&amp;sec=nation Nazri: I’m not convinced of need to review 1988 crisis] [[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]. 12 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Malaysian general election, 2008|2008 general election]] which saw heavy losses for BN, Abdullah reshuffled his Cabinet. Within days of his appointment, new ''de facto'' Law Minister [[Zaid Ibrahim]] stated that the government had to openly apologise for its handling of the crisis, calling it one of his three main goals: "In the eyes of the world, the judicial crisis has weakened our judiciary system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ian |last=McIntyre |coauthors= |title=Zaid: Govt has to apologise to victims of 1988 judicial crisis |date=23 March 2008 |publisher= |url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/3/23/nation/20730100&amp;sec=nation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409212804/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F3%2F23%2Fnation%2F20730100&amp;sec=nation |dead-url=yes |archive-date=9 April 2008 |work=The Star |pages= |accessdate=23 March 2008 |language= |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he rejected the idea of reviewing the decision: "I am not suggesting that we re-open the case. I am saying that it’s clear to everyone, to the world, that serious transgressions had been committed by the previous administration. And I believe that the prime minister is big enough and man enough to say that we had done wrong to these people and we are sorry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=| last=| coauthors=| title=Healing the judiciary - first serious move in 20 years welcomed by Bar Council| date=23 March 2008| publisher=| url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/5568-healing-the-judiciary-first-serious-move-in-20-years-welcomed-by-bar-council| work=The Malaysian Insider| pages=| accessdate=23 March 2008| language=| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020233743/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/5568-healing-the-judiciary-first-serious-move-in-20-years-welcomed-by-bar-council| archive-date=20 October 2008| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bar Council welcomed the proposal. Newly appointed Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister [[Shahrir Abdul Samad]] also voiced support: "The Government has apologised for so many other things to the people, such as the untimely destruction of temples and other issues. So, why not an apology to a former Lord President?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Bar Council backs Salleh apology move |date=24 March 2008 |publisher= |url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/3/24/nation/20733676&amp;sec=nation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919000512/http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F3%2F24%2Fnation%2F20733676&amp;sec=nation |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 September 2008 |work=The Star |pages= |accessdate=24 March 2008 |language= |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zaid's proposal was criticised by former Bar president [[Param Cumaraswamy]], who insisted that Mahathir's administration, not Abdullah's, should assume responsibility: "Those who perpetrated the transgressions are still alive and they must be called to account for their conduct and seek forgiveness from the six valiant judges, their families and Malaysians generally for the sacrilege committed to the temple of independent justice." He also proposed that the government compensate the three sacked judges since "reinstatement of the three dismissed is no longer possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Li Tsin | last=Soon | coauthors= | title=Param: Seek accountability, not apology | date=24 March 2008 | publisher= | url =http://malaysiakini.com/news/80306 | work =Malaysiakini | pages = | accessdate = 24 March 2008 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karpal Singh]], lawyer and opposition member of Parliament, agreed: "Calling for the present administration to apologise is not a step in (the) right direction. It is not the present administration that convened those tribunals." Instead, Karpal suggested that a Royal Commission be set up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=M. | last=Mageswari | coauthors= | title=Karpal: Review '88 judicial crisis | date=24 March 2008 | publisher= | url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/3/24/nation/20080324175005&amp;sec=nation | work=The Star | pages= | accessdate=24 March 2008 | language= | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422140143/http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F3%2F24%2Fnation%2F20080324175005&amp;sec=nation | archive-date=22 April 2009 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, ''[[The Malaysian Insider]]'', a news website, reported that the Cabinet was critical of the proposal, citing the potential for legal liability if the government admitted wrongdoing. Zaid said that the proposal was still being considered, and that "we have to wait."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=| last=| coauthors=| title=Zaid takes a beating in Cabinet over apology| date=26 March 2008| publisher=| url=http://themalaysianinsider.com/mni/zaid-takes-a-beating-in-cabinet-over-apology.html| work=The Malaysian Insider| pages=| accessdate=26 March 2008| language=| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329211344/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/mni/zaid-takes-a-beating-in-cabinet-over-apology.html| archive-date=29 March 2008| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008, at a dinner with 600 members of the Bar and leaders from the opposition [[Pakatan Rakyat]] coalition, Abdullah acknowledged the impact of the crisis:

{{quote|To a large extent, the events of 1988 have fueled much of the disagreement on how to move on. ... I can say with a clear conscience that I abided and will continue to abide by the principle of separation of powers, leaving the matter of justice to the judiciary. And yet the legacy of 1988 haunts us until today. ... For many, the events of 1988 were an upheaval of the nation's judicial system. Rightly or wrongly, many disputed both the legality and morality of the related proceedings. For me, personally, I feel it was a time of crisis from which the nation never fully recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Abdullah Ahmad |last=Badawi |coauthors= |title=Full text of PM's speech |date=18 April 2008 |publisher= |url=http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Friday/Frontpage/20080418110132/Article/index_html |work=New Straits Times |pages= |accessdate=18 April 2008 |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421183014/http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Friday/Frontpage/20080418110132/Article/index_html |archivedate=21 April 2008 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He then announced that the government would make ''[[ex gratia]]'' goodwill payments to the sacked and suspended judges: "I do not presume to equate your contribution, pain and loss with mere currency but I hope you could accept this as a heartfelt and sincere gesture to mend what had been." However, he refused to explicitly apologise for the events of 1988 or otherwise review them, saying it would "prolong the sense of crisis". Abdullah also announced his intention to set up a judicial appointments commission as part of his plans to reform the judicial system. Two of the six judges involved in the 1988 crisis — Tun Salleh Abas and Azmi Kamaruddin — and the families of the other four were present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Lih Yi | last=Beh | coauthors= | title=PM unveils judicial reforms but no apology | date= | publisher= | url=http://www1.malaysiakini.com/news/81550 | work=Malaysiakini | pages= | accessdate=17 April 2008 | language= | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420235042/http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/81550 | archive-date=20 April 2008 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zaid welcomed Abdullah's announcement in spite of the lack of a formal apology, saying: "(One) can say sorry in other ways." George Seah's son told the press that although all his father wanted was an apology, the family would not reject any goodwill payments. Tan Sri Wan Suleiman Pawanteh's wife said: "Although I thank the prime minister, I feel less than satisfied at his decision (not to make a straightforward apology). This is not the end of the story for me. (Without an apology) I don't know, people don't know, that my husband was not guilty. I want my husband's name to be cleared. I feel my husband was innocent. He was an honest judge...Even so, I am thankful that our prime minister cares about us enough (to do this much)."

==2018: Mahathir's new claims==
In January 2018, Tun Dr Mahathir (by then opposition leader after leaving UMNO) denied responsibility for removing Tun Salleh Abas, insisting this was done under instructions from the then Yang di-Pertuan Agong, [[Iskandar of Johor]]. The former Prime Minister said he was prepared to swear on the Quran that his name had been used by the Attorney-General then, Tan Sri Abu Talib Othman, in order to distance the Agong from the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Tun M: I did not sack Tun Salleh Abas | date=3 January 2018 | publisher= | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5EfRiCP6Fs | work = | pages = | accessdate = 23 May 2018 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed there had been a letter with remarks from the Agong regarding Salleh, but said this has since been lost. He also maintained that Salleh’s removal was prompted by the Agong’s displeasure over a letter Salleh had allegedly written to the monarch regarding construction noises from the Ruler’s nearby private home, which was also copied to the other Malay Rulers. Mahathir claimed that the Agong called him as prime minister and said he wanted Salleh sacked and passed him a copy of the Abas's alleged letter in question. Dr Mahathir claimed that the matter was discussed by his Cabinet then, which decided on a tribunal to remove Salleh as Lord President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Dr M insists Salleh Abbas sacked on Agong’s orders, but says evidence lost | date=3 January 2018 | publisher= | url =https://sg.news.yahoo.com/dr-m-insists-salleh-abbas-sacked-agong-orders-033200070.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = 23 May 2018 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Former Attorney General Abu Talib Othman agreed that Dr Mahathir was not responsible for dismissing the Lord President. Othman clarified that he saw the note written, signed by the then Agong, asking then PM Mahathir to remove the Lord President and advised the PM on procedure, but denied Mahathir's claims that his name was being used to distance the Agong. Othman suggested that Mahathir was merely acting on the insistence of the then Yang di-Pertuan Agung himself in setting up of the dismissal tribunal via the provisions and channels of the Constitution as the PM and Attorney General had no powers to dismiss a Lord President. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Ex-AG denies ‘using’ Dr M’s name in sacking of Salleh Abas | date=4 January 2018 | publisher= | url =http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2018/01/04/ex-ag-denies-using-dr-ms-name-in-sacking-of-salleh-abas/ | work = | pages = | accessdate = 23 May 2018 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abu Talib alleged that the Agong was displeased with Salleh's letter complaining about the criticisms levelled at the judiciary by the executive. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=It was the Agong who moved to sack Salleh Abas, says former A-G | date=4 January 2018 | publisher= | url =https://www.themalaysianinsight.com/s/30791/ | work = | pages = | accessdate = 23 May 2018 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When asked about the revelations, Tun Salleh Abas merely suggested that it was time to move on from the sacking which took place 30 years earlier, and that the crisis was merely being politicised in the lead up to the 14th General Election (where Mahathir was running as the opposition candidate for Prime Minister, which he successfully won later in May).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Move on already, says Salleh Abas of 1988 judicial crisis | date=6 January 2018 | publisher= | url =https://www.themalaysianinsight.com/s/31052 | work = | pages = | accessdate = 23 May 2018 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Alabama Policy Institute was founded in 1989 as the Alabama Family Alliance. [[Alabama Supreme Court]] justice [[Tom Parker (judge)|
Tom Parker]] was the founding executive director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Associate Justice Tom Parker |url=http://judicial.alabama.gov/bios/parker.cfm |publisher=Supreme Court of Alabama |accessdate=3 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150307041827/http://judicial.alabama.gov/Bios/parker.cfm |archivedate=7 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gary Palmer (politician)|Gary Palmer]], a co-founder of the Alabama Family Alliance, eventually became its president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moseley |first1=Brandon |title=Crosby to Replace Palmer at API |url=http://www.alreporter.com/in-case-you-missed-it-2/6735-crosby-to-replace-palmer-at-api.html |accessdate=3 March 2015 |publisher=Alabama Political Reporter |date=September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402122810/http://www.alreporter.com/in-case-you-missed-it-2/6735-crosby-to-replace-palmer-at-api.html |archivedate=2 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the Alabama Family Alliance was renamed the Alabama Policy Institute. After 25 years at the helm, Palmer stepped down from his role as the institute's president in order to make a 2014 run for [[Alabama's 6th congressional district]]. He was replaced by Caleb Crosby, who had served as API's vice president and CFO prior to becoming the group's president in September 2014.&lt;ref name=gore/&gt;

==Policy positions==
API researches policy issues and offers analysis and proposals through reports and publications to public servants, citizens, and the media. As a conservative think tank, API addresses a range of policy issues in the areas of economics, education, the environment, government, family and society.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

API has argued for what they consider to be fairer [[income taxes|taxes]] in Alabama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Same tired song|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dQciAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GaYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5980,4148684&amp;dq=alabama-policy-institute&amp;hl=en|accessdate=4 March 2015|publisher=The Tuscaloosa News|date=March 21, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, API was a staunch opponent of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Governor [[Bob Riley]]'s $1.2 billion tax increase proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fund|first1=John|title='Too Damn Stupid'|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122462311783055755|accessdate=4 March 2015|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=August 28, 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402234326/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122462311783055755#|archive-date=2015-04-02|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Editing Out the Facts in Alabama|url=http://www.factcheck.org/2014/06/editing-out-the-facts-in-alabama/|accessdate=4 March 2015|work=FactCheck.org|publisher=Annenberg Public Policy Center|date=June 25, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501104750/http://www.factcheck.org/2014/06/editing-out-the-facts-in-alabama/#|archive-date=2015-05-01|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It commissioned a study by the [[Beacon Hill Institute]] about Riley's tax increase legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beyerle|first1=Dana|title=University of Alabama economist Ferguson disputes tax study critical of Riley's package|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=f3AvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ztwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5490,1533320&amp;dq=alabama-policy-institute&amp;hl=en|accessdate=4 March 2015|publisher=Gadsden Times|date=July 18, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; API has been a critic of proposals for an Alabama state lottery, labeling such proposals a regressive tax on the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Jeffrey Douglas|title=The Unaffordable Nation: Searching for a Decent Life in America|date=2007|publisher=Prometheus Books,|isbn=9781616141240|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCulley|first1=Kaitlin|title=Should Alabama start an education lottery?|url=http://wiat.com/2014/07/07/should-alabama-start-an-education-lottery/|accessdate=4 March 2015|publisher=WIAT|date=July 7, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402093936/http://wiat.com/2014/07/07/should-alabama-start-an-education-lottery/#|archive-date=2015-04-02|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6799">The '''Armenian orthography reform''' occurred between 1922 and 1924 in [[Soviet Armenia]]. It was rejected by the [[Armenian diaspora]], most of which speak [[Western Armenian]], including the Armenian communities in [[Iran]], which also speak [[Eastern Armenian]] and still use the [[classical Armenian orthography|classical orthography]] of the [[Armenian alphabet]].

Although it is hardly used by Armenians outside [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Russia]], it is the official orthography for the [[Armenian language]] in Armenia.

==History==
One of the most significant and successfully achieved policies of the former [[Soviet Union]] was the rise in the overall population's literacy, which began in the early 1920s. That was most probably the urgent need that was one of the reasons for reforming the orthography. With a variety of other educational reforms, the reformed orthography resulted in a literacy rate of 90% in the country by the early 1950s.

Although the [[orthography]] was changed by the reform, it is hardly a simplification. In fact, some other nations of the Soviet Union changed their scripts from [[Arabic script|Arabic]] ([[Central Asia]]n nations) and [[Latin script|Latin]] ([[Moldova]]) to [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]. However, it was a rather progressive step in the spirit of the historical developments in that it did not hinder the ability of all of the former Soviet nations to develop literature, education, research and science.

The original orthography is now known as the classical orthography ({{lang-hy|դասական ուղղագրութիւն}} ''dasakan uġġagrut'yun'') and is sometimes referred to as ''Mashtotsian orthography'' ({{lang|hy|մաշտոցյան ուղղագրություն}}), after [[Mesrop Mashtots]], who devised the Armenian alphabet in 405 AD.

==Opposition==
Since the establishment of the third Republic of Armenia in 1991, there has been a fringe movement in some Armenian academic circles to reinstate the classical orthography as official in Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Rules ==
If pronunciation has changed, one should use the modern pronunciation. That concerns the letter pairs {{lang|hy|յ/հ}}, {{lang|hy|ու/վ}} and [[diphthong]]s {{lang|hy|ոյ/ույ, եա/յա, եօ/յո, իւ/յու}}.

The following changes are also made:

*The digraph {{lang|hy|ու}} /u/ becomes the 34th independent letter of the alphabet.
*The letters "{{lang|hy|է}}" and "{{lang|hy|օ}}" were deleted from the alphabet but reinstated in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;(Russian) http://baas.asj-oa.am/39/1/1940-4-5%28111%29.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, they are written only at the beginning of a word and in compound words. {{lang|hy|ե}} or {{lang|hy|ո}} are used respectively in their places. The only exceptions are {{lang|hy|ով}} /ov/ "who" and {{lang|hy|ովքեր}} /ovk&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;ɛɾ/ "those (people)" and the present tense of "to be": {{lang|hy|եմ}} /em/ "I am", {{lang|hy|ես}} /es/ "you are (sing.)", {{lang|hy|ենք}} /enk&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;/ "we are", {{lang|hy|եք}} /ek&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;/ "you are (pl.)", {{lang|hy|են}} /en/ "they are".
*The letter "{{lang|hy|ւ}}" is no longer an independent letter and appears only as a component of "{{lang|hy|ու}}". In its place, "{{lang|hy|վ}}" is written.
*The ligature "{{lang|hy|և}}" was initially abolished, but in 1940, it became the 37th independent letter of the alphabet. Some words originally written with "{{lang|hy|եվ}}" are now written with it.
*In the conjugation of verbs, in both the indicative and the conditional modes, "{{lang|hy|կ}}" is added directly, without an apostrophe before vowels or "{{lang|hy|ը}}" before consonants.

The '''Australian Labor Party National Conference''' (sometimes referred to as the '''Federal Conference''') is an internal body of the [[Australian Labor Party]], one of the major political parties in Australia. It is the highest representative body of the party's state and territory branches. The National Conference takes place triennially, the most recent being the 47th conference held at the Melbourne Convention Centre from 24 to 26 July 2015,&lt;ref&gt;ALP: [https://lab15.org.au Welcome to the 47th Australian Labor Party National Conference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109180044/http://lab15.org.au/ |date=9 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and which was attended by 397 party delegates.&lt;ref name=smh18June15&gt;''Sydney Morning Herald'', 18 June 2015: [http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/labor-powerbrokers-lose-control-with-reform-back-on-the-agenda-20150617-ghqeiy.html Labor powerbrokers lose control with reform back on the agenda]&lt;/ref&gt; The previous Conference was the [[2011 Australian Labor Party National Conference|2011 National Conference]] held on 3 December 2011, and the [[2018 Australian Labor Party National Conference|next National Conference]] will take place in Adelaide on 16-18 December 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lab18.org.au/ Labor 48th National Conference]&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Conference determines party policy, called the National Platform,&lt;ref&gt;[http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/australianlaborparty/pages/121/attachments/original/1365135867/Labor_National_Platform.pdf?1365135867 Labor National Platform from 46th Conference] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923182841/http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/australianlaborparty/pages/121/attachments/original/1365135867/Labor_National_Platform.pdf?1365135867 |date=23 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is executed by the [[Australian Labor Party National Executive|National Executive]]. Twenty members of the National Executive are elected by the National Conference.

The National Conference does not elect the party's [[Leaders of the Australian Labor Party|parliamentary leaders]], which since 2013 has been by a ballot of both the Parliamentary [[Caucus]] and by the Labor Party's rank-and-file members. The national president and vice-presidents are elected by a vote of party members. On many matters votes at the Conference take place on a [[Political faction|faction]]al basis. In the past, the [[Labor Right]] faction held a majority at the National Conference, though it lost the majority at the 2015 National Conference.&lt;ref name=smh18June15 /&gt; 

==Notable actions and positions==

===Socialist objective===
The 1922 National Conference adopted a "socialist objective," which remained official policy for many years. The resolution was qualified, however, by the "[[Maurice Blackburn|Blackburn]] amendment," which said that "socialisation" was desirable only when was necessary to "eliminate exploitation and other anti-social features."&lt;ref&gt;McKinlay (1981) p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; In practice the socialist objective was a dead letter. Only once has a federal Labor government attempted to nationalise any industry ([[Ben Chifley]]'s bank nationalisation of 1947), and that was held by the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] to be unconstitutional. The commitment to nationalisation was dropped after urging by [[Gough Whitlam]] in the 1970s, and in the 1980s [[Bob Hawke]]'s government carried out many free market reforms including the floating of the dollar and [[privatisation]] of state enterprises such as [[Qantas]] airways and the [[Commonwealth Bank of Australia|Commonwealth Bank]].

===Expulsion of the New South Wales branch===
{{further|Australian Labor Party split of 1931}}
In March 1931, a Special Federal Conference was called in response to the actions of the New South Wales state executive, which was controlled by the [[Lang Labor]] faction. The New South Wales state leader, [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]], had been openly defying the federal Labor government for several months. The most immediate trigger was the state party's actions at the [[East Sydney by-election, 1931|East Sydney by-election]], where it announced that its candidate, [[Eddie Ward]], would be bound only by the decisions of the state executive, not the federal caucus. At the conference, which the New South Wales Branch boycotted, [[John Curtin]] successfully moved for the branch's expulsion; the motion was carried by 25 votes to four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1978|author=[[Finlay Crisp|L. F. Crisp]]|title=The Australian Federal Labour Party, 1901–1951|edition=2nd|publisher=Hale &amp; Iremonger|pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference also gave the Federal Executive the power to suspend or dissolve any other state branch "acting or having acted in a manner deemed [...] contrary to the Federal Constitution, Platform, and Policy of the Party".&lt;ref&gt;Crisp (1978), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; The conference subsequently moved for the establishment of a new ALP branch in New South Wales loyal to the Federal Executive, which became known as the "[[Federal Labor Party (NSW)|Federal Labor Party]]". As the Federal Executive had no power to dissolve the original branch (controlled by Lang), the two parties competed against each other at elections for several years. The rebellious branch was eventually re-admitted to the party at another Special Federal Conference in Melbourne in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Crisp (1978), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uranium mining===
The 1977 National Conference voted in favour of an indefinite moratorium on uranium mining. However, the 1982 National Conference changed the anti-uranium position in favour of a "one mine policy". After the ALP won power in 1983, the 1984 National Conference adopted a "[[Three mine policy]]".&lt;ref&gt;Burgmann, Verity (2003). [https://books.google.com/books?id=atpiAdA9IEMC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;lpg=PA172&amp;dq=%22Campaign+Against+Nuclear+Energy%22+australia&amp;source=web&amp;ots=C1VPjptDVC&amp;sig=EtLkUVNTkS__H7zeNbY_0liKq9o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result#PPA174,M1 Power, Profit and Protest] pp. 174–175. Retrieved 15 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This referred to the then three existing uranium mines in Australia, [[Nabarlek Uranium Mine|Nabarlek]], [[Ranger Uranium Mine|Ranger]] and [[Olympic Dam, South Australia|Roxby Downs/Olympic Dam]], and articulated ALP support for pre-existing mines and contracts, but opposition to any new mining.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Chris (23 March 2007). Labor &amp; uranium: an evolution, ''Labor E-herald''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Same-sex Marriage===
The [[2011 Australian Labor Party National Conference|2011 National Conference]] voted in favour of [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Australia|recognition of same-sex marriage in Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/03/gay-marriage-australia-labor-party-endorse|title = Australia's Labor party votes to endorse gay marriage, but no law change|date = 2 December 2011|author = Associate Press|publisher = The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also formally endorsed a motion to allow Labor members of parliament the ability to [[conscience vote|vote in accordance with their consciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/12/03/australian-labor-party-conference-defies-prime-minister-julia-gillard-to-support-gay-marriage/|title = Australian Labor party conference defies prime minister Julia Gillard to support gay marriage|author = James Park|date = 3 December 2011&lt;!--, 11:07am--&gt;|publisher = [[Pink News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On midnight 9 January, 2018 [[same-sex marriage]] became effectively legal across [[Australia]] by the [[Malcolm Turnbull]] [[Coalition Government]], only after a controversial "national postal survey" where 60% of Australian's voted yes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.9news.com.au/national/2018/01/08/14/56/same-sex-marriage-guidelines-issued-for-celebrants]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Tanganyika and Zanzibar, the two constituents of modern Tanzania, had come under [[German East Africa|German rule]] in by the 1880s. The territory was inhabited by a large number of ethnic groups speaking different languages. The German colonial government decided to use Kiswahili as the language of administration after becoming fearful that use of German would introduce the local population to subversive Marxist texts. The British, who took over after the defeat of Germany in World War 1 continued this policy.&lt;ref name=Askew&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swahili has 17 dialects. The Interterritorial Language Committee in 1930 under British colonial rule in East Africa tasked with creating a standardized form of the language. The Kiujuga dialect spoken in Zanzibar was chosen as the base. The committee was also involved in standardizing the spelling as well as coining new words. The committee was reorganized into a purely academic institution as ''[[Taasisi ya Taaluma za Kiswahili |Taasisi ya Uchunguzi wa Kiswahili]]'' (TATAKI) in 1964 and integrated into the [[University of Dar es Salaam]] in 1970.&lt;ref name="Yambi"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the [[Tanganyika African National Union]], fighting for freedom from colonial rule, had adopted Kiswahili as a language of mass organization and political revolution. After coming to power, Kiswahili was made the national language and was seen as a tool for national integration and social development. Since Taasisi ya Uchunguzi was Kiswahili had transitioned into a purely academic institution, there was a void with respect to its standardization functions. ''Baraza la Kiswahili la Taifa'' was founded to fill this void.&lt;ref name=Askew /&gt;&lt;ref name=Massa&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation and activities==
BAKITA was founded by a parliamentary act in 1967 as organization dedicated to the development and advocacy of Kiswahili as a means of national integration in Tanzania. Its mission was laid down in this act and further expanded in an amendment passed in 1983. Key activities mandated for the organization include creating a healthy atmosphere for the development of Kiswahili, encouraging use of the language in government and business functions, coordinating activities of other organizations involved with Kiswahili, standardizing the language&lt;ref name=Massa /&gt;

BAKITA cooperates with organizations like TATAKI in creation, standardization and dissemination of specialized terminologies Other institutions can propose new vocabulary to respond to emerging needs but only BAKITA can approve usage.&lt;ref name="Yambi" /&gt; By the end of the 1970s, terminologies had been published in ''Tafsisru Sanifu'', a BAKITA journal, for economics and business, administration and government, mathematics, science, social science and engineering among other fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The '''Canada-Israel Committee''' (CIC) was the official representative of the organized Canadian Jewish community on matters pertaining to Canada-Israel relations.

The Canada-Israel Committee maintained offices in Ottawa, Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and Israel, and was affiliated with the [[Quebec-Israel Committee]]. Its staff consisted of experts in government policy, communications, Arab-Israeli relations and Middle East affairs, and Canadian Middle East policy.

Due to a restructuring of Jewish community bodies, effective July 1, 2011, the CIC ceased operations and its responsibilities were assumed by its parent organization, the [[Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs]] (CIJA).

==Funding==
CIC was funded by the [[Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs]], the advocacy arm of [http://www.jewishcanada.org Jewish Federations of Canada - UIA].

==Programming==
The CIC was devoted to the promotion of increased understanding between the peoples of Canada and Israel. It is a non-partisan, voluntary, non-profit organization that enjoys the support of Canadians from all walks of life. In seeking to enhance Canada-Israel friendship, the CIC liaised with government, media, business and the academic sector, often submitting briefs and providing background analyses on matters of public policy. In addition, it sponsored seminars, conferences and other types of educational programming in Canada, and organized study missions to Israel.

{{Events leading to US Civil War}}

The '''Caning of Charles Sumner''', or the '''Brooks–Sumner Affair''', occurred on May 22, 1856, in the [[United States Senate]] when  Representative [[Preston Brooks]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[South Carolina|SC]]) used a walking cane to attack Senator [[Charles Sumner]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Massachusetts|MA]]), an [[abolitionist]], in retaliation for a speech given by Sumner two days earlier in which he fiercely criticized slaveholders, including a relative of Brooks. The beating nearly killed Sumner and it drew a sharply polarized response from the American public on the subject of the expansion of [[slavery in the United States]]. It has been considered symbolic of the "breakdown of reasoned discourse"&lt;ref name=Senate&gt;{{cite web |title= The Caning of Senator Charles Sumner |url= https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/The_Caning_of_Senator_Charles_Sumner.htm |publisher= [[United States Senate]] |accessdate= February 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that eventually led to the [[American Civil War]].

==Background==
{{wikisource|The Crime against Kansas}}
In 1856, during the "[[Bleeding Kansas]]" crisis, Sumner denounced the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]] in his "Crime against Kansas" speech, delivered on May 19 and May 20. The long speech argued for the immediate admission of Kansas as a free state and went on to denounce the "[[Slave Power]]"—the political arm of the slave owners:

{{quote|Not in any common lust for power did this uncommon tragedy have its origin. It is the rape of a virgin Territory, compelling it to the hateful embrace of slavery; and it may be clearly traced to a depraved desire for a new Slave State, hideous offspring of such a crime, in the hope of adding to the power of slavery in the National Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= Michael William |last= Pfau |title= Time, Tropes, and Textuality: Reading Republicanism in Charles Sumner's 'Crime Against Kansas |journal= Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs |volume=  6 |issue= 3 |year= 2003 |pages= 385–413, quote on p. 393 |url= http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/rhetoric_and_public_affairs/v006/6.3pfau.html |via= Project MUSE |doi=10.1353/rap.2003.0070}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sumner then attacked the authors of the Act, Senators [[Stephen A. Douglas]] of Illinois and [[Andrew Butler]] of South Carolina, saying,
{{quote|The senator from South Carolina has read many books of chivalry, and believes himself a chivalrous knight with sentiments of honor and courage. Of course he has chosen a mistress to whom he has made his vows, and who, though ugly to others, is always lovely to him; though polluted in the sight of the world, is chaste in his sight—I mean the harlot, slavery. For her his tongue is always profuse in words. Let her be impeached in character, or any proposition made to shut her out from the extension of her wantonness, and no extravagance of manner or hardihood of assertion is then too great for this senator.}}

In which Sumner was [[Allusion|alluding]] that Butler was the [[Don Quixote]] of [[Dulcinea del Toboso|slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Davis |first1=Kenneth |title=Don't know much about the Civil War : everything you need to know about America's greatest conflict but never learned |date=1996-2011 |publisher=Harper |location=New York |oclc=33948054}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Sumner mocked Butler's speaking ability, which had been impeded by a recent stroke:
{{quote|[He] touches nothing which he does not disfigure with error, sometimes of principle, sometimes of fact. He cannot open his mouth, but out there flies a blunder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hendrix |first=Pat |date=2006 |title=Murder and Mayhem in the Holy City |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yw7-_oj-vN0C&amp;pg=PA50 |location=Charleston, SC |publisher=History Press |page=50 |isbn=978-1-59629-162-1 |via= [[Google Books]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Manisha Sinha (2003), Sumner had been ridiculed and insulted by both Douglas and Butler for his opposition to the Fugitive Slave Law in the past and the Kansas-Nebraska Act earlier, with Butler crudely race-baiting Sumner by making sexual allusions to black women, like many slaveholders who accused abolitionists of promoting interracial marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= Manisha |last=  Sinha |url= http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/11329814/caning-charles-sumner-slavery-race-ideology-age-civil-war |title= The Caning of Charles Sumner: Slavery, Race and Ideology in the Age of the Civil War |journal= Journal of the Early Republic |volume= 23 |date= Summer 2003 |pages= 233–262 |via= [[EBSCO Host]] |doi=10.2307/3125037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hoffer (2010), "It is also important to note the sexual imagery that recurred throughout the oration, which was neither accidental nor without precedent. Abolitionists routinely accused slaveholders of maintaining slavery so that they could engage in forcible sexual relations with their slaves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hoffer |first=Williamjames Hull |year=2010 |title=The Caning of Charles Sumner: Honor, Idealism, and the Origins of the Civil War |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NPbXpW9fTEC&amp;pg=PA62 |location=Baltimore |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |page=62 |isbn=978-0-8018-9468-8 |via= Google Books |ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas said during the speech that "this damn fool is going to get himself killed by some other damn fool."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Walther |first=Eric H. |date=2004 |title=The Shattering of the Union: America in the 1850s |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L9qNIZfUdzsC&amp;pg=PA97 |location=Lanham, MD |publisher=SR Books |page=97 |isbn=978-0-8420-2799-1 |via= Google Books |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representative [[Preston Brooks]], Butler's cousin, was infuriated. He later said that he intended to challenge Sumner to a [[duel]], and consulted with fellow South Carolina Representative [[Laurence M. Keitt]] on dueling etiquette. Keitt told him that dueling was for gentlemen of equal social standing, and that Sumner was no better than a drunkard, due to the supposedly coarse language he had used during his speech. Brooks said that he concluded that since Sumner was no gentleman, he did not merit honorable treatment; to Keitt and Brooks, it was more appropriate to humiliate Sumner by beating him with a cane in a public setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Daigh |first=Michael |date=2015 |title=John Brown in Memory and Myth |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QkLoCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113 |location=Jefferson, NC |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company |page=113 |isbn=978-0-7864-9617-4 |via= Google Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Day of the attack==
[[File:Laurence M. Keitt cph.3a02077.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Congressman Laurence Keitt advised Brooks and was with him when he assaulted Sumner.]]
Two days later, on the afternoon of May 22, Brooks entered the Senate chamber with Keitt and another ally, Congressman [[Henry A. Edmundson]].  They waited for the galleries to clear, especially concerned that there be no ladies present to witness what Brooks intended to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Walther|2004|p=98|ps=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He confronted Sumner as he sat writing at his desk in the almost empty Senate chamber. "Mr. Sumner, I have read your speech twice over carefully. It is a libel on South Carolina, and Mr. Butler, who is a relative of mine," Brooks calmly announced in a low voice.  As Sumner began to stand up, Brooks beat Sumner severely on the head before he could reach his feet, using a thick [[gutta-percha]] cane with a gold head. The force of the blows so shocked Sumner that he lost his sight immediately. "I no longer saw my assailant, nor any other person or object in the room. What I did afterwards was done almost unconsciously, acting under the instincts of self-defense," he recalled later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Green |first=Michael S. |date=2010 |title=Politics and America in Crisis: The Coming of the Civil War |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x80_kiWmx58C&amp;pg=PA94 |location=Santa Barbara, CA |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=94 |isbn=978-0-313-08174-3 |via= Google Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sumner was knocked down and trapped under the heavy desk, which was bolted to the floor.  His chair, which was pulled up to his desk, moved back and forth on a track; Sumner either could not or did not think to slide his chair back to escape, so it pinned him under his desk.  Brooks continued to strike Sumner until Sumner rose to his feet and ripped the desk from the floor in an effort to get away from Brooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Thoreau |first1= Henry David |editor-last= Hyde |editor-first= Lewis |date=2002 |title=The Essays of Henry D.

He staggered up the aisle and, arms outstretched, vainly attempted to defend himself. But then he was an even larger and easier target for Brooks, who continued to beat him across the head, face, and shoulders "to the full extent of [my] power." Brooks didn't stop when his cane snapped; he continued thrashing Sumner with the piece which held the gold head. Sumner stumbled and reeled convulsively, "Oh Lord," he gasped "Oh! Oh!" Near the end of the attack, Sumner collapsed unconscious, although shortly before he succumbed he "bellowed like a calf" according to Brooks. Brooks grabbed the falling Sumner, held him up by the lapel with one hand, and continued to lash out at him with the cane in the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Puleo |first=Stephen |date=2013 |title=The Caning: The Assault That Drove America to Civil War |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=phKIngEACAAJ |location=Yardley, PA |publisher=Westholme Publishing |page=112 |isbn=978-1-59416-187-2 |ref= harv |via= Google Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date= 1972 |title=Civil War Times Illustrated |volume= vol 11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=nXvPVKWQJILhggSHxIDgAw&amp;id=KPQMAQAAMAAJ |location=Harrisburg, PA |publisher=Historical Times Incorporated |page= 37 |via= Google Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several other Senators and Representatives attempted to help Sumner, but were blocked by Edmundson, who yelled at the spectators to leave Brooks and Sumner alone,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Walther|2004|p=99|ps=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Keitt, who brandished his own cane and a pistol, and shouted, "Let them be!" and "Let them alone, God damn you, let them alone!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Green |first=Michael S. |date=2010 |title=Politics and America in Crisis: The Coming of the Civil War |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x80_kiWmx58C&amp;pg=PA94 |location=Santa Barbara, CA |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=99 |isbn=978-0-275-99095-4 |via= Google Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kagan |first=Neil |date=2006 |title=Eyewitness to the Civil War:  The Complete History from Secession to Reconstruction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=faDF1LEbAyAC&amp;pg=PA21 |location=Washington, DC |publisher=National Geographic |page=21 |isbn=978-0792262060 |via= Google Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shelden |first=Rachel A. |date=2013 |title=Washington Brotherhood: Politics, Social Life, and the Coming of the Civil War |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=pZj9AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA122 |location=Chapel Hill, NC |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |page=122 |isbn=978-1-4696-1085-6 |via= Google Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator [[John J. Crittenden]] attempted to intervene, and pleaded with Brooks not to kill Sumner.  Senator [[Robert Toombs]] then interceded for Crittenden, telling Keitt not to attack someone who was not a party to the dispute, though Toombs also indicated later that he had no issue with Brooks beating Sumner, and in fact approved of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Scroggins |first=Mark |date=2011 |title=Robert Toombs: The Civil Wars of a United States Senator and Confederate General |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RDJxLEYVH0UC&amp;pg=PA91 |location= Jefferson, NC |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company |page=91 |isbn=978-0-7864-6363-3 |via= Google Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representatives [[Ambrose S. Murray]] and [[Edwin B. Morgan]] were finally able to intervene and restrain Brooks, at which point he quietly left the chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Devens |first=R. M. |date=1882 |title=Assault on the Hon.

Brooks also required medical attention before leaving the Capitol; he had hit himself above his right eye with one of his backswings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hoffer|2010|pp=8–11|ps=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks was arrested for the assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/533437771/ |title=Outrage in the United States Senate: Senator Sumner, of Massachusetts, Knocked Down and Beaten till Insensible by Mr. Brooks, of South Carolina |work= The Baltimore Sun |date= May 23, 1856 |page= 1 |via= [[ProQuest]] Archiver}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cane Brooks used was broken into several pieces, which he left on the blood soaked floor of the Senate chamber.  Some, including the cane's gold head, were recovered by Edmundson, who gave the portion with the head to [[Adam John Glossbrenner]], the [[Sergeant at Arms of the United States House of Representatives|House Sergeant at Arms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Dickey |first=J.D. |date=2014 |title=Empire of Mud: The Secret History of Washington, DC |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ABNxBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA141 |location=Guilford, CT |publisher=Globe Pequot Press |page=141 |isbn=978-0-7627-8701-2 |via= Google Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rives |first=John C. |date=June 2, 1856 |title=The Congressional Globe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=se9fAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA1362 |location=Washington, DC |publisher=John C.

==Aftermath==
[[File:Walking cane used to assault Senator Charles Summner, May 1856 - Old State House Museum, Boston, MA - IMG 6685.JPG|thumb|left|The walking cane used to attack Charles Sumner on exhibit at the [[Old State House (Boston)|Old State House]] in Boston.]]
The episode revealed the polarization in America, as Sumner became a martyr in the North and Brooks a hero in the South. Northerners were outraged. The ''Cincinnati Gazette'' said, "The South cannot tolerate free speech anywhere, and would stifle it in Washington with the bludgeon and the bowie-knife, as they are now trying to stifle it in Kansas by massacre, rapine, and murder."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link= James M. McPherson |first= James M. |last= McPherson |title= Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=09FkZqu_YcMC&amp;pg=PA150 |year= 2003 |publisher= Oxford University Press |page=150 |via= Google Books }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Cullen Bryant]] of the ''New York Evening Post,'' asked, "Has it come to this, that we must speak with bated breath in the presence of our Southern masters?... Are we to be chastised as they chastise their slaves? Are we too, slaves, slaves for life, a target for their brutal blows, when we do not comport ourselves to please them?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= William E. |last= Gienapp |title= The Origins of the Republican Party, 1852–1856 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AWtZnsxMCDEC&amp;pg=PA359 |year= 1988 |publisher= Oxford University Press |page= 359 |via= Google Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thousands attended rallies in support of Sumner in Boston, Albany, Cleveland, Detroit, New Haven, New York, and Providence. More than a million copies of Sumner's speech were distributed. Two weeks after the caning, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] described the divide the incident represented: "I do not see how a barbarous community and a civilized community can constitute one state. I think we must get rid of slavery, or we must get rid of freedom."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Puleo|2013|pp= 36-7|ps=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, Brooks was praised by Southern newspapers. The ''Richmond Enquirer'' editorialized that Sumner should be caned "every morning", praising the attack as "good in conception, better in execution, and best of all in consequences" and denounced "these vulgar abolitionists in the Senate" who "have been suffered to run too long without collars. They must be lashed into submission." Southerners sent Brooks hundreds of new canes in endorsement of his assault. One was inscribed "Hit him again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Palmer |first=John J. |date=June 3, 1856 |title=The Caning Affair |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/58077515 |work=The Western Democrat |location=Charlotte, NC |page=3 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representative [[Anson Burlingame]] publicly humiliated Brooks by goading him into challenging Burlingame to a duel, only to set conditions designed to intimidate Brooks into backing down.  (As the challenged party, Burlingame, who was a crack shot, had the choice of weapons and dueling ground.  He selected rifles on the [[Canada]] side of [[Niagara Falls]], where U.S. anti-dueling laws would not apply.  Brooks withdrew his challenge, claiming that he did not want to expose himself to the risk of violence by traveling through northern states to get to Niagara Falls.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hollister |first= Ovando James |year= 1886 |title= Life of Schuyler Colfax |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IoYcAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA98 |location= New York |publisher= Funk &amp; Wagnalls |page= 98 |via= Google Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooks also threatened Senator Henry Wilson, Sumner's colleague from Massachusetts.  Wilson called the beating by Brooks "brutal, murderous, and cowardly," and in response Brooks challenged Wilson to a duel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=1895 |title=The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography |volume= vol.

White &amp; Company |page=14 |via= Google Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wilson declined, saying that he could not legally or by personal conviction participate, and calling dueling "the lingering relic of a barbarous civilization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boller |first=Paul F. |date=2004 |title=Presidential Campaigns: From George Washington to George W.

In the 1856 elections, the new Republican Party made gains by use of the twin messages of "Bleeding Kansas" and "Bleeding Sumner",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Donald |first=David Herbert |date=2009 |title=Charles Sumner and the Coming of the Civil War |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=2nCRjrBPmiwC&amp;pg=PA252 |location=Naperville, IL |publisher=SourceBooks, Inc. |page=252 |ref={{sfnRef|''Charles Sumner and the Coming of the Civil War''}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; because both events served to paint pro-slavery Democrats as extremists.{{sfn|''Charles Sumner and the Coming of the Civil War''|page=252}}  Though the Democrats won the [[United States presidential election, 1856|presidential election]] and [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1856|increased their majority]] in the House of Representatives because the Constitution's requirement to count slaves for purposes of apportioning Congressional districts and the Electoral College gave Democrats an advantage, Republicans made dramatic gains in elections for the state legislatures, which enabled them [[United States Senate elections, 1856 and 1857|to make gains]] in the U.S. Senate elections, because senators were chosen by the state legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |date=1987 |title=The Panic of 1857 and the Coming of the Civil War |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=9ZdjiM3_zF0C&amp;pg=PA258 |location=Baton Rouge, LA |publisher=Louisiana State University Press |page=258 |ref={{sfnRef|''The Panic of 1857 and the Coming of the Civil War''}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The violence in Kansas and the beating of Sumner helped the Republicans coalesce and cohere as a party, which set the stage for their victory in the [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860 presidential election]].{{sfn|''The Panic of 1857 and the Coming of the Civil War''|page=258}}

During the 1856 lame duck session of Congress, Brooks made a speech calling for the admission of Kansas "even with a constitution rejecting slavery".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1048">The '''Central America-4 passport''' (also called the '''Central American passport''') is a common-design [[passport]] issued by the [[Central America-4 Border Control Agreement]] member states ([[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], and [[Nicaragua]]). Although the design had been in use by Nicaragua and El Salvador since the mid-1990s, it became the norm for the CA-4 in January 2006. The main features are the navy blue cover with the words "America Central" or "Centroamerica" and a map of [[Central America]], with the territory of the issuing country highlighted in gold. This substitutes one map for four national symbols.

[[File:Chain_of_trust.svg|lang=en|thumb|400px|The roles of root certificate, intermediate certificate and end-entity certificate as in the chain of trust.]]
In computer security, a '''chain of trust''' is established by validating each component of [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[software]] from the end entity up to the root certificate.  It is intended to ensure that only trusted software and hardware can be used while still retaining flexibility.

==Introduction==
A chain of trust is designed to allow multiple users to create and use software on the system, which would be more difficult if all the keys were stored directly in hardware. It starts with hardware that will only boot from software that is [[Digital signature|digitally signed]].  The signing authority will only sign boot programs that enforce security, such as only running programs that are themselves signed, or only allowing signed code to have access to certain features of the machine. This process may continue for several layers.

This process results in a chain of trust. The final software can be trusted to have certain properties, because if it had been illegally modified its signature would be invalid, and the previous software would not have executed it. The previous software can be trusted, because it, in turn, would not have been loaded if its signature had been invalid. The trustworthiness of each layer is guaranteed by the one before, back to the [[trust anchor]].

It would be possible to have the hardware check the suitability (signature) for every single piece of software. However, this would not produce the flexibility that a "chain" provides. In a chain, any given link can be replaced with a different version to provide different properties, without having to go all the way back to the trust anchor. This use of multiple layers is an application of a general technique to improve scalability, and is analogous to the use of multiple certificates in a [[Root certificate|certificate chain]].

==Computer security==
In computer security, digital certificates are verified using a chain of trust. The trust anchor for the digital certificate is the root [[certificate authority]] (CA).

The certificate hierarchy is a structure of certificates that allows individuals to verify the validity of a certificate's issuer. Certificates are issued and signed by certificates that reside higher in the certificate hierarchy, so the validity and trustworthiness of a given certificate is determined by the corresponding validity of the certificate that signed it.

The chain of trust of a certificate chain is an ordered list of certificates, containing an end-user subscriber certificate and [[intermediate certificate authority|intermediate certificates]] (that represents the intermediate CA), that enables the receiver to verify that the sender and all intermediate certificates are trustworthy. This process is best described in the page ''[[Intermediate certificate authority]]''. See also [[X.509#Certificate chains and cross-certification|X.509 certificate chains]] for a description of these concepts in a widely used standard for digital certificates.

'''''Chernoe Znamia''''' (or '''Chornoe Znamia''') ({{lang-ru|Чёрное знамя}}, {{lang-en|The Black Banner}}), known as the  '''''Chernoznamentsy''''', was a [[Russia]]n [[anarchist communist]] organisation. It emerged in 1903 as a federation of cadres.&lt;ref name=Geifman&gt;{{Harvnb|Geifman|1993|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took its name, "The Black Banner", from the [[Anarchist symbols#Black flag|black flag]],&lt;ref name=av44/&gt; the use of which as a symbol of [[anarchism in Russia]], according to ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]'', coincided with its founding.&lt;ref name="print"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Iain McKay |author=The Anarchist FAQ Editorial Collective |title=[[An Anarchist FAQ]] |publisher=[[AK Press]] |location=Stirling |year=2008 |chapter=Appendix &amp;mdash; The Symbols of Anarchy |chapterurl=http://www.infoshop.org/faq/append2.html |isbn=1-902593-90-1 |oclc=182529204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==
The largest collection of anarchist terrorists in [[Imperial Russia]], ''Chernoe Znamia'' attracted its strongest following in the western and southern provinces at the frontier of the Empire, including nearly all anarchists in [[Białystok]].&lt;ref name=av44&gt;{{Harvnb|Avrich|2006|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their ranks included mostly students, factory workers and artisans, though there were also peasants, unemployed labourers, drifters, and self-professed [[Übermensch|Nietzschean supermen]].&lt;ref name=av44/&gt; Ethnically, [[Jews]] predominated, and many members were of Ukrainian, Polish and [[Great Russia]]n nationality.&lt;ref name=av44/&gt; The typical age of the ''Chernoznamentsy'' was nineteen or twenty, and some of the most active adherents were as young as fifteen years old.&lt;ref name=av44/&gt;

'''Comités Abertos de Faculdade''' ('''CAF''', ''Open Faculty Committees'' in English) was a student organization of [[Galiza]]. Formed from the union of different [[Faculty (division)|faculty]] assemblies. The main goals of the CAF were defending quality and the [[Galician language]] public education. It was an assembly-based organization. The CAF were considered the heirs of the [[Galician Revolutionary Students|ERGA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comitesabertos.org/about/historia/|title=Historia|work=Sitio web dos Comités|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
The CAF traditionally incorporated almost all of the [[Galician nationalism|nationalist]] [[Left-wing politics|left]] organizations operating at the university ([[Galician Nationalist Bloc]], [[Galician Socialist Party-Galician Left]], [[Communist Movement of Galicia|MCG]], [[Communist Party of the Galician People]]...), but with the integration of most of these groups in the [[Galician Nationalist Bloc]] the organization ended being formed mainly by militants of [[Galiza Nova]] and people without party affiliation.

==History==
During the effervescence of the student struggles at the [[University of Santiago de Compostela]], in the early eighties of the twentieth century, a number of Assemblies of Center emerged and united around the year of 1986 in the ''Comités Abertos'' (''Open Committees'', although some, such as the CAMAE, will remain semi-autonomous ). Although theoretically the CA covered the whole university, in practice it was an organization with a very strong presence in [[Santiago de Compostela]] and marginal in the other campus. It was only from the segregation of the universities of [[University of A Coruña|A Coruña]] and [[University of Vigo|Vigo]] when the organization began to have presence in all the (seven) campus. The origins worked at the Faculty Assembly and a coordinating body (Campus Council) made up of two people from each school.

Since its establishment, with the dissolution of [[Galician Revolutionary Students|ERGA]], in 1988, the CAF grew and became the most important [[students' union|student union]] in [[Galiza]], present in almost all of the academic institutions with student representation.

In the 90's the CAF suffered the split of the [[Movemento Estudantil Universitario]] (MEU), in reaction to what they denounced as the [[Galician People's Union]] control of the organization. The CAF managed to recover its presence slightly, specially after the disappearance of the [[Movemento Estudantil Universitario|MEU]].

In 2008 the internal crises of [[Comités Abertos de Estudantes|CAE]] and the CAF lead to their unification in a new project, the [[Comités]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vieiros.com/nova/66356/caf-e-cae-preparan-a-sua-fusion-para-crear-unha-nova-organizacion-estudantil|title=Vieiros|publisher=Vieiros.com|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Commission on the Unification of Pronunciation''' ({{zh|t=讀音統一會|p=Dúyīn Tǒngyī Huì}}) was the organization established by [[Beiyang Government]] in 1912 select ancillary [[Phonetic transcription|phonetic symbol]]s for [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], ([[Zhuyin]] was the product) and set the standard [[Standard Chinese|Guoyu]] pronunciation of basic [[Chinese character]]s.

== History ==
It was decided in a draft on 7 August 1912, a month after a conference led by the [[Cai Yuanpei]] on July 10, that a set of phonetic symbols were to be used for education purposes. The Commission was set up in December, led by [[Wu Zhihui]] (Woo Tsin-hang). The Commission ended on 22 May 1913. A later similar organization that still exists that had been headed by Wu Zhihui for a while is the [[Mandarin Promotion Council]].

== Members ==
The first meeting took place on 15 February 1913 in [[Beijing]], with 44 delegates. The chairman was Wu; vice-chairman [[Wang Zhao (linguist)|Wang Zhao]] (王照). There were two representatives per each of the 26 [[Chinese province|province]]s. The [[Tibet]]ans, the [[Mongolia]]ns and the [[overseas Chinese]] each had one representative. Prominent members included:
* [[Cai Zhang]] (蔡璋)
* [[Chen Suiyi]] (陳遂意)
* [[Gao Kunnan]] (高鯤南)
* [[Hu Yuren]] (胡雨人)
* [[Li Liangcai]] (李良材)
* [[Liu Zishan]] (劉繼善)
* [[Lu Zhuangzhang]] (盧戇章)
* [[Ma Tiqian]] (馬體乾)
* [[Wang Rongbao]] (汪榮寶)
* [[Wang Sui]] (王崔)
* [[Wang Yi'an]] (汪怡安)
* [[Xing Dao]] (邢島)
* [[Yang Qu]] (楊麴)
* [[Yang Zenghao]] (楊曾浩)

== Phonetic symbols ==
There were three main ideas of how the phonetic symbols should be:
* Using certain complete [[Chinese character]]s to symbolize other characters of the same sound
** Supporters included Wang Zhao, Wang Rongbao, Wang Yi'an, and Cai.
* Using [[Latin alphabet]] letters
** Supporters included Yang Zenghao and Liu
* Using non-existent symbols
** Supporters included Wu, Lu, Ma, Li, Xing, Wang Sui, Hu, Yang Qu, Gao, Chen, and Zheng.

The three groups discussed for two months and adopted 15 symbols from [[Zhang Binglin]]'s all-[[Zhuanshu]] Jiyin Zimu (記音字母), which was the proposal by the [[Zhejiang]] Committee. Jiyin Zimu was renamed to [[Zhuyin|Zhuyin Fuhao]].

After its proclamation, several aspects of Zhuyin were further modified, including:
*  Rearranging the order of the symbols
*  Adding ㄜ (Pinyin ''e'')
*  ㄦ, originally just ''r'', was now also ''er'' (a retroflex vowel)
*  The three dialectal symbols — ㄪ (v), ㄫ (ng) and ㄬ (ny) — were deleted, but are still to be found in Unicode Bopomofo (U+3105–U+312C).
*  The [[tone (tonal language)|tone]] system was modified

== Programs ==
The Commission established the Seven Mandarin Sound Promotion Programs (《國音推行方法七條》 Guoyu Tuixing Fangfa Qi Tiao):
# Proclaimed Zhuyin Zimu. [On 23 November 1918]
# All provinces were to establish places to promote and study the 6500 standardized Mandarin sounds (國音傳習所), where the county representatives would gather and return to their counties to spread the words. [Established in 1920, along with Summer Mandarin Seminars (暑期國語講習所)]
# Using the [[phonograph|gramophone]] to record the exact pronunciation. [Recorded in 1920]
# Having Mandarin be a compulsory subject in all [[elementary school]]. [Implemented in 19??]
# All teachers were to speak solely in Mandarin in elementary and [[middle school]]s. [Implemented in 19??]
# All textbooks and some official documents were to be annotated by Zhuyin. [Implemented in 19??]
&lt;!-- And one more program, I have no idea what, my sources don't say! :-(  --&gt;

'''Contingent Owned Equipment''' ('''COE''') is the equipment owned and brought by [[United Nations]] member states to peacekeeping missions.  The UN financially reimburses member states for their contributions of COE, and also for the self sustainment services they provide to contingents. This method of reimbursement is commonly referred to as the “COE System". UN staff in peacekeeping missions serve as COE inspectors, verifying that the member states' equipment and the services they provide meet the standards required for reimbursement.

The COE System was approved by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1996 to simplify the means by which countries are reimbursed for providing equipment, self sustainment services, and personnel to peacekeeping missions.

==The Memorandum of Understanding==

The [[Memorandum of Understanding]] (MOU) is the contract signed by representatives of the [[Department of Peacekeeping Operations]] (DPKO) and the contributing country’s [[permanent mission]] to the UN which specifies the exact amount and type of equipment, personnel, and self-sustainment services which the contributing country will be expected to provide to the peacekeeping mission and for which it will be financially reimbursed.  Equipment under MOU ranges from crew served machine guns, [[metal detector]]s, and other handheld equipment, to [[Armoured personnel carrier|APCs]], heavy engineering equipment, cargo/utility vehicles, and generators and containers.  Self-sustainment services include catering, communications, medical, [[Special:Search/Bomb Disposal|EOD]], accommodation, field defense, observation, and so on—- all of the services required to enable a formed military or police unit to sustain itself and function in the field.  

Rates of reimbursement are generic, based on “fair market value” as determined by working groups of the General Assembly.  A separate MOU is written for each formed military or police unit to be deployed to a peacekeeping mission.  Currently there are over 300 MOU covering units deployed to 11 peacekeeping missions, representing over 2 billion US dollars in troop, equipment, and self-sustainment costs annually.

{{refimprove|date=April 2012}}
'''Defense in depth''' (also known as '''Castle Approach'''{{Citation needed|reason=While this strategy might have been used in castles, I've not seen a source suggesting it is specifically called Castle Approach|date=February 2018}}) is an [[information assurance]] (IA) concept in which multiple layers of security controls (defense) are placed throughout an [[information technology]] (IT) system. Its intent is to provide redundancy in the event a security control fails or a vulnerability is exploited that can cover aspects of ''personnel'', ''procedural'', ''technical'' and ''physical'' security for the duration of the [[system life cycle|system's life cycle]].

==Background ==
The idea behind the defense in depth approach is to defend a system against any particular attack using several independent methods.&lt;ref name=schneier2006&gt;[https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/02/security_in_the.html Schneier on Security: Security in the Cloud]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a layering tactic, conceived by the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) as a comprehensive approach to information and electronic security.&lt;ref name=nsa1&gt;[https://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/support/defenseindepth.pdf Defense in Depth: A practical strategy for achieving Information Assurance in today’s highly networked environments.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=owasp1&gt;[https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Defense_in_depth OWASP Wiki: Defense in depth] {{unreliable source?|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defense in depth is originally a military [[strategy]] that seeks to delay rather than prevent the advance of an attacker by yielding space to buy time. 

== Controls ==
Defense in depth can be divided into three areas: Physical, Technical, and Administrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Stewart | first1=James Michael | last2=Chapple | first2=Mike  | last3=Gibson | first3=Darril | date=2015|title=CISSP (ISC)2 Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Study Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical controls ===
[[Physical_security|Physical controls]] are anything that physically limits or prevents access to IT systems. Fences, guards, dogs, and CCTV systems and the like.

=== Technical controls ===
Technical controls are hardware or software whose purpose is to protect systems and resources. Examples of technical controls would be disk encryption, fingerprint readers, and Windows Active Directory. Hardware technical controls differ from physical controls in that they prevent access to the contents of a system, but not the physical systems themselves.

=== Administrative controls ===
Administrative controls are an organization's policies and procedures. Their purpose is to ensure that there is proper guidance available in regards to security and that regulations are met. They include things such as hiring practices, data handling procedures, and security requirements.

'''The usage of Non-Standard Ports is not a valid means of security.'''

==Examples==
Using more than one of the following layers constitutes defense in depth{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}.

* [[Authentication]] and [[password]] security
* [[Biometrics]]
* [[DMZ (computing)|Demilitarized zones]] (DMZ)

{{Property law}}

An '''easement''' is a [[Nonpossessory interest in land|nonpossessory]] right to use and/or enter onto the [[real property]] of another without possessing it. It is "best typified in the right of way which one landowner, A, may enjoy over the land of another, B".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gray |first=Kevin J. |author2=Susan Francis Gray  |title=Elements of Land Law |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2009 |edition=5th |page=13 |isbn=9780199219728 |oclc=231883446 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to [[covenant (law)|real covenants]] and [[equitable servitude]]s;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2855&amp;context=wlulr "Integration of the Law of Easements, Real Covenants and Equitable Servitudes"]. ''Washington Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; in the United States, the [[Restatements of the Law|Restatement (Third) of Property]] takes steps to merge these concepts as servitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez, MV (2005). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1951138 "Restating Implied, Prescriptive, and Statutory Easements"]. ''Real Property, Probate and Trust Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Easements are helpful for providing pathways across two or more pieces of property, allowing individuals to access other properties or a resource, for example to [[fishing|fish]] in a privately owned pond or to have access to a public beach. An easement is considered as a property right in itself at [[common law]] and is still treated as a type of property in most jurisdictions.

The rights of an easement holder vary substantially among jurisdictions. Historically, the common law courts would enforce only four types of easement:

* [[Right-of-way (transportation)|Right-of-way]] (easements of way)
* Easements of support (pertaining to excavations)
* Easements of "light and air"
* Rights pertaining to artificial waterways

Modern courts recognize more varieties of easements, but these original categories still form the foundation of easement law.

== Types ==
=== Affirmative and negative easements ===
An affirmative easement is the right to use another property for a specific purpose, and a negative easement is the right to prevent another from performing an otherwise lawful activity on their own property.

For example, an affirmative easement might allow land owner A to drive their cattle over the land of B. A has an affirmative easement from B.

Conversely, a negative easement might restrict A from putting up a wall of trees that would block B's mountain view, A has a negative easement from B. 

=== Dominant and servient estate ===
{{main|Dominant estate}}
As defined by Evershed MR in ''[[Re Ellenborough Park]]'' [1956] Ch 131, an easement requires the existence of at least two parties. The party gaining the benefit of the easement is the dominant estate (or dominant tenement), while the party granting the benefit or suffering the burden is the servient estate (or servient tenement).

For example, the owner of parcel A holds an easement to use a driveway on parcel B to gain access to A's house. Here, parcel A is the dominant estate, receiving the benefit, and parcel B is the servient estate, granting the benefit or suffering the burden.

=== Public and private easements ===
A private easement is held by private individuals or entities. A public easement grants an easement for a public use, for example, to allow the public an access over a parcel owned by an individual.

=== ''Appurtenant'' and ''in gross'' easements ===
In the US, an easement ''appurtenant'' is one that benefits the dominant estate and "runs with the land" and so generally transfers automatically when the dominant estate is transferred.  An appurtenant easement allows property owners to access land that is only accessible through a neighbor's land.

Conversely, an easement ''in gross'' benefits an individual or a legal entity, rather than a dominant estate. The easement can be for a personal use (for example, an easement to use a boat ramp) or a commercial use (for example, an easement to a railroad company to build and maintain a rail line across property). Historically, an easement in gross was neither assignable nor inheritable, but commercial easements are now freely transferable to a third party. They are divisible but must be exclusive (the original owner no longer uses it and exclusive to easement holder) and all holders of the easement must agree to divide. If subdivided, each subdivided parcel enjoys the easement.

=== Floating easement ===
A floating easement exists when there is no fixed location, route, method, or limit to the [[right-of-way (transportation)|right of way]].&lt;ref&gt;Ballentine's Law Dictionary, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.law.com/default2.asp?selected=758&amp;bold=%7C%7C%7C%7C law.com dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legal-explanations.com/definitions/floating-easement.htm Legal-explanations.com]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a right of way may cross a field, without any visible path, or allow egress through another building for [[fire safety]] purposes. A floating easement may be public or private, appurtenant or in gross.&lt;ref&gt;An example of a public floating easement is owned by the state of [[Florida]] and managed by the city of [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]]: [http://www.ci.st-augustine.fl.us/commission/agendas2006/minutes/ccmin_06_12_06.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

One case defined it as "(an) easement defined in general terms, without a definite location or description, is called a floating or roving easement...."&lt;ref&gt;Sunnyside Valley Irrigation District v. Dickie, Docket No. 726353MAJ (Wash. 2003), citing, Berg v. Ting, 125 Wn.2d 544, 552, 886 P.2d 564 (1995), retrieved from findlaw.com [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=wa&amp;vol=2003_sc/726353maj&amp;invol=3]&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, "a floating easement becomes fixed after construction and cannot thereafter be changed."&lt;ref&gt;Sunnyside Valley Irrigation District v. Dickie, Docket No. 726353MAJ (Wash. 2003), citing Rhoades v. Barnes, 54 Wash. 145, 149, 102 P. 884 (1909) retrieved from findlaw.com [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=wa&amp;vol=2003_sc/726353maj&amp;invol=3]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Structural encroachment ===
Some legal scholars classify [[structural encroachment]]s as a type of easement.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

=== Wayleave ===
In British [[energy law]] and [[real property law]], a wayleave is a type of easement used by a [[utility]] that allows a [[Lineman (technician)|linesman]] to enter the [[premises]], "to install and retain their cabling or piping across private land in return for annual payments to the landowner." Like a [[license]] or ''[[Profit (real property)|profit-à-prendre]]'', "[a] Wayleave is normally a temporary arrangement and does not automatically transfer to a new owner or occupier."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utilityserve.co.uk/wayleaves_and_easement.php|title=Wayleaves &amp; Easements |work=Utility Serve|date=n.d., 2010|accessdate=June 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, a wayleave agreement can be used for any service provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plc.practicallaw.com/3-204-3954|title=Wayleave agreement |work=Practical Law website|date=n.d., 2013|accessdate=June 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], an ''easement in gross'' is used for such needs, especially for permanent rights.

=== Access easement ===
An access easement provides access from a public right of way to a parcel of land. For example, if Zach and James own neighboring parcels of land, Zach's parcel may have easement rights to cross James's parcel from a public right of way. In such a case, Zach's "dominant" parcel would contain an access easement to cross James's "servient" parcel.

== Creation ==
Easements are most often created by express language in binding documents. Parties generally grant an easement to another, or reserve an easement for themselves. Under most circumstances having a conversation with another party is not sufficient. Courts have also recognized creation of easements in other ways.

=== Express easement ===
An easement may be implied or express. An express easement may be "granted" or "reserved" in a [[deed]] or other legal instrument. Alternatively, it may be incorporated by reference to a subdivision plan by "dedication", or in a restrictive covenant in the agreement of an owners association.  Generally, the doctrines of contract law are central to disputes regarding express easements while disputes regarding implied easements usually apply the principles of property law.

===Implied easement===
Implied easements are more complex and are determined by the courts based on the use of a property and the intention of the original parties, who can be private or public/government entities. Implied easements are not recorded or explicitly stated until a court decides a dispute, but reflect the practices and customs of use for a property. Courts typically refer to the intent of the parties, as well as prior use, to determine the existence of an implied easement.

A government authority or private service provider may acquire an implied easement over private land by virtue of the public service it performs.  For example, a local authority may have the responsibility of installing and maintaining the sewerage system in an urban area.  Merely by the fact that it has that responsibility, usually enshrined in some statute or local laws, may give the authority the right, by virtue of an implied easement, to enter private property to carry out installation and maintenance.  The location of the easement will not usually be described precisely, but its general position will be defined by the service route (i.e., the sewer pipes in this example).  Power and water lines may also have implied easements linked to them, but drainage and stormwater systems are commonly precisely defined in location and recorded in the title documents for private land.

=== Easement by necessity ===
Despite the name, necessity alone is an insufficient claim to create any easement. Parcels without access to a public way may have an easement of access over adjacent land if crossing that land is ''absolutely necessary'' to reach the [[landlocked parcel]] and there has been some original intent to provide the lot with access, and the grant was never completed or recorded but is thought to exist. A court order is necessary to determine the existence of an easement by necessity. To obtain this generally the party who claims the easement files a lawsuit, and the judge weighs the relative damage caused by enforcing an easement against the servient estate against the damage to the dominant estate if the easement is found not to exist and is thus landlocked.

Because this method of creating an easement requires imposing a burden (the easement) upon another party for the benefit of the landlocked owner, the court looks to the original circumstances in weighing the relative apportionment of benefit and burden to both lots in making its equitable determination whether such easement shall be created by the court. This method of creating an easement, being an active creation by a court of an otherwise non-existent right, may be automatically extinguished upon termination of the necessity (for example, if a new public road is built adjacent to the landlocked tenement or another easement is acquired without regard to comparison of ease or practicality between the imposed easement and any valid substitute).

There is also an unwritten form of easement referred to as an implied easement or easement by implication, arising from the original subdivision of the land for continuous and obvious use of the adjacent parcel (e.g., for access to a road, or to a source of water) such as the right of lot owners in a subdivision to use the roadway on the approved subdivision plan without requiring a specific grant of easement to each new lot when first conveyed. An easement by necessity is distinguished from an ''easement by implication'' in that the easement by necessity arises only when "strictly necessary", whereas the easement by implication can arise when "reasonably necessary". Easement by necessity is a higher standard by which to imply an easement.

In India, easement of necessity could be claimed only in such cases where transfer, bequeathment or partition necessitates such claim.

As an example, some U.S. state statutes grant a permanent easement of access to any descendant of a person buried in a cemetery on private property.

In some states, such as New York, this type of easement is called an easement ''of'' necessity.&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Real Property Law § 335-a.  Found at [http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/nycode/RPP/9/335-a].  Retrieved October 20, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Easement by prior use ===
An easement may also be created by prior use. Easements by prior use are based on the idea that land owners can intend to create an easement, but forget to include it in the [[deed]].

There are five elements to establish an easement by prior use:

# Common ownership of both properties at one time
# Followed by a severance
# Use occurs before the severance and afterward
# Notice
## Not simply visibility, but apparent or discoverable by reasonable inspection (e.g. the hidden existence of a sewer line that a plumber could identify may be notice enough)
# Necessary and beneficial
## Reasonably necessary
## Not the "strict necessity" required by an easement by necessity

====Example====
[[File:EasementByPriorUseExample-1- .svg|thumb|right|alt=A sells the front lot, but forgets to get an easement for driveway access.|A sells the front lot, but forgets to get an easement for driveway access.]]
A owns two lots. One lot has access to a public street and the second is tucked behind it and fully landlocked. A's driveway leads from the public street, across the first lot and onto the second lot to A's house. A then sells off the first lot but forgets to reserve a driveway easement in the deed.

A originally had common ownership of both properties. A also used the driveway during this period. A then severed the land. Although A did not reserve an easement, the driveway is obviously on the property and a reasonable buyer would know what it is for. Finally, the driveway is reasonably necessary for a residential plot; how else could A get to the street?

Here, there is an implied easement.

=== Easement by prescription ===
{{see also|Adverse possession}}

'''Easements by prescription''', also called '''prescriptive easements''', are implied easements granted after the dominant estate has used the property in a hostile, continuous and open manner for a statutorily prescribed number of years. Prescriptive easements differ from adverse possession by not requiring exclusivity.

Once they become legally binding, easements by prescription hold the same legal weight as written or implied easements. But, before they become binding, they hold no legal weight and are broken if the true property owner takes appropriate acts to defend their ownership rights. Easement by prescription is typically found in legal systems based on [[common law]], although other legal systems may also allow easement by prescription.

Laws and regulations vary among local and national governments, but some traits are common to most prescription laws:
* ''open'' and ''notorious'' (i.e., obvious to anyone)
*''actual'', ''continuous'' (i.e., uninterrupted for the entire required time period); this does not necessarily require use daily, weekly, etc.
*''adverse'' to the rights of the true property owner
*''hostile'' (i.e., in opposition to the claim of another; this can be accidental, not "hostile" in the common sense)
*''continuous'' for a period of time defined by statute or appellate case law

Unlike fee simple adverse possession, prescriptive easements typically do not require ''exclusivity''.  In states that do, such as Virginia, the exclusivity requirement has been interpreted to mean that the prescriptive user must use the easement in a way that is different than the general public, i.e., a use that is "exclusive" to that user,  Callahan v. White, 238 Va. 10, 381 S.E.2d 1 (1989).

The period of continuous use for a prescriptive easement to become binding is generally between 5 and 30 years depending upon local laws (sometimes based on the [[statute of limitations]] on trespass). Generally, if the true property owner acts appropriately to defend their property rights at any time during the required time period the hostile use will end, claims on adverse possession rights are voided, and the continuous use time period will be reset to zero.

In some jurisdictions, if the use is not hostile but given actual or implied consent by the legal property owner, the prescriptive easement may become a regular or implied easement rather than a prescriptive easement and immediately becomes binding. An example of this is the lengthy [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Lissadell House#Access Dispute 2008 to Present|Lissadell House rights of way case]] heard since 2010, that extended long-standing consents given to individuals into a public right of way.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/1220/lisadell.html RTE website, 20 December 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/0110/1224287157216.html Lissadell case; Irish Times, 10 January 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

In other jurisdictions, such permission immediately converts the easement into a terminable license, or restarts the time for obtaining a prescriptive easement.

Government or railroad owned property is generally immune from prescriptive easement in most cases, but some other types of government owned property may be subject to prescription in certain instances.  In New York, such government property is subject to a longer [[statute of limitations]] of action, 20 years instead of 10 years for [[private property]].{{citation needed|date=February 2008}}

In most U.S. jurisdictions, a prescriptive easement can only be determined for an ''affirmative'' easement not a ''negative'' easement.  In all U.S. jurisdictions, an ''easement for view'' (which is a negative easement) cannot be created by prescription.

Prescription may also be used to end an existing legal easement. For example, if a servient tenement (estate) holder were to erect a fence blocking a legally deeded right-of-way easement, the dominant tenement holder would have to act to defend their easement rights during the statutory period or the easement might cease to have legal force, even though it would remain a deeded document.  Failure to use an easement leading to loss of the easement is sometimes referred to as "non-user."

====Quebec====
Under the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] of [[Quebec]] possessors with the animus (will) to be owners can acquire a right of ownership (or to a dismemberment of ownership if animus is to inclined) as long as the nature of possession is peaceful, continuous, public and unequivocal throughout. (According to article 2922 of the [[Civil Code of Quebec]] or CCQ) the prescribed period is 10 years (2917–2920 CCQ), except as otherwise provided by law. (2918 sets a different time for unregistered property. Reduced from 30 years.)

Exceptions to prescription: Possession cannot establish a servitude under 1181 CCQ, but non-use of a servitude will extinguish it.

====Louisiana====
In the state of [[Louisiana]], a mixed legal jurisdiction with strong civil law roots, prescription can be either acquisitive or liberative, both of which involve the creation or extinguishing of rights over time. ''Acquisitive prescription'' in Louisiana is analogous to the common law idea of adverse possession. As defined in La. C.C. Art. 3446, "acquisitive prescription is a mode of acquiring ownership or other [[real right]]s by possession for a period of time."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legis.state.la.us/lss/lss.asp?doc=110470 La. C.C. Art 3446 available at]&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the common law adverse position, Louisiana's acquisitive prescription is not a procedural bar to recovering property but the creation of a new ownership right in the property. Time periods for acquisitive prescription depend on whether the property is movable or immovable and whether the property is possessed in good faith (possessor believes they have title to the property) or in bad faith.

''Liberative prescription'' is analogous to the common law statute of limitations. As defined in La. C.C. Art. 3447, "liberative prescription is a mode of barring of actions as a result of inaction for a period of time."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legis.state.la.us/lss/lss.asp?doc=110469 La. C.C. Art. 3447 available at]&lt;/ref&gt; It can be renewed by the party who has gained its protection. For example, a debtor's admission that a debt is still owed renews the creditor's claim against the debtor and starts the tolling of another prescriptive period. This differs from [[peremption]], which is a fixed time for the existence of a legal right and which cannot be renewed like liberative prescription.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legis.state.la.us/lss/lss.asp?doc=110481 Peremption is defined in La. C.C. Art. 3458, available at]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Easement by estoppel ===

When a property owner misrepresents the existence of an easement while selling a property and does not include in the deed to the buyer an express easement over an adjoining property that the seller owns, a court may step in and create an easement. Easements by [[estoppel]] generally look to any promises not made in writing, any money spent by the benefiting party in reliance on the representations of the burdened party, and other factors. If the court finds that the buyer acted reasonably and in good faith and relied on the seller's promises, the court may create an easement by estoppel.

For example: Ray sells land to Joe on the promise that Joe can use Ray's driveway and bridge to the main road at any time, but Ray does not include the easement in the deed to the land. Joe, deciding that the land is now worth the price, builds a house and connects a garage to Ray's driveway. If Ray (or his successor) later decides to gate off the driveway and prevent Joe (or Joe's successor) from accessing the driveway, a court would likely find an easement by estoppel.

Because Joe purchased the land believing that there would be access to the bridge and the driveway and Joe then paid for a house and a connection, Joe can be said to rely on Ray's promise of an easement. Ray materially misrepresented the facts to Joe. In order to preserve equity, the court will likely find an easement by estoppel.

On the other hand, if Ray had offered access to the bridge and driveway ''after'' selling Joe the land, there may not be an easement by estoppel. In this instance, it is merely inconvenient if Ray revokes access to the driveway. Joe did not purchase the land and build the house in reliance on access to the driveway and bridge. Joe will need to find a separate theory to justify an easement.

=== Easement by the government ===

In the [[United States]], easements may be acquired (bought) by the government using its power of [[eminent domain]] in a ''condemnation'' proceeding in the courts. Note that in the United States, in accordance with the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] to the U.S. Constitution, property cannot simply be taken by the government unless the property owner is compensated for the fair market value of what is taken.  This is true whether the government acquires full ownership of the property ("fee title") or a lesser property interest, such as an easement.  For example, utility providers are typically granted jurisdiction-wide easement to access and maintain their existing infrastructure.

In the law of England and Wales following the incorporation of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] into English law, any deprivation of the rights of the owner of property must be "in accordance with law" as well as "necessary in a democratic society" and "proportionate".

===Easements distinguished from licenses===

Licenses to use property in a nonpossessory manner are similar to but more limited than easements and are, under certain circumstances, transformed into easements by the courts.  Some general differences do exist:

*A license is often revocable and is typically limited in duration
*A license is often uninsurable
*A license is often not recorded
*A license is often vested in one person

Easements are regarded as a broader and more powerful than licenses, and licenses that have any of the properties of an easement may be bound by the higher standards for termination granted by an easement.

== Termination ==

A party claiming termination should show one or more of the following factors:

* Release: agreement to terminate by the grantor and the grantee of the easement
* Expiration: the easement reaches a formal expiration date
* Abandonment: the holder demonstrates ''intent'' to discontinue the easement&lt;ref&gt;Ward v. Ward (1852) 7 Exch. 838&lt;/ref&gt;
* Merger: When one owner gains title to both dominant and servient tenement
** Mortgaged properties with merged easements that then go into foreclosure can cause the easement to revive when the bank takes possession of part of the dominant estate
* Necessity: If the easement was created by necessity and the necessity no longer exists
* [[Estoppel]]: The easement is unused and the servient estate takes some action in reliance on the easement's termination
* Prescription: The servient estate reclaims the easement with actual, open, hostile and continuous use of the easement
* Condemnation: The government exercises eminent domain or the land is officially condemned
*  this has no termination. {{clarify|date=August 2018}}

== Rights ==

The following rights are recognized of an easement:
* '''[[Right to light]]''', also called '''solar easement'''. The right to receive a minimum quantity of light in favour of a window or other aperture in a building which is primarily designed to admit light.
* '''[[Aviation easement]]'''. The right to use the airspace above a specified altitude for aviation purposes.  Also known as ''aviation easement'', where needed for low-altitude spraying of adjacent agricultural property.
* '''[[Right-of-way (railroad)|Railroad easement]]'''.
* '''[[Utility easement]]''' including:
** '''[[Storm drain]] or storm water easement'''. An easement to carry rainwater to a river, wetland, detention pond, or other body of water.
** '''[[Sanitary sewer]] easement'''. An easement to carry used water to a sewage treatment plant.
** '''[[Electrical power]] line easement.'''
** '''[[Telephone line]] easement.'''
** '''[[Natural gas|Fuel gas]] pipe easement.'''
* '''Sidewalk easement.''' Usually sidewalks are in the public right-of-way.
* '''View easement.''' Prevents someone from blocking the view of the easement owner, or permits  the owner to cut the blocking vegetation on the land of another.
* '''Driveway easement,''' also known as ''easement of access''.  Some lots do not border a road, so an easement through another lot must be provided for access.  Sometimes adjacent lots have "mutual" driveways that both lot owners share to access garages in the backyard.  The houses are so close together that there can only be a single driveway to both backyards.  The same can also be the case for walkways to the backyard: the houses are so close together that there is only a single walkway between the houses and the walkway is shared.  Even when the walkway is wide enough, easement may exist to allow for access to the roof and other parts of the house close to a lot boundary. To avoid disputes, such easement should be recorded in each property [[deed]].
* '''[[Beach]] access.'''  Some jurisdictions permit residents to access a public lake or beach by crossing adjacent private property.  Similarly, there may be a private easement to cross a private lake to reach a remote private property, or an easement to cross private property during high tide to reach remote beach property on foot.
* '''Dead end easement.''' Sets aside a path for pedestrians on a dead-end street to access the next public way.  These could be contained in covenants of a homeowner association, notes in a subdivision plan, or directly in the deeds of the affected properties.
* '''Recreational easement.'''  Some U.S. states offer tax incentives to larger landowners if they grant permission to the public to use their undeveloped land for recreational use (not including motorized vehicles).  If the landowner posts the land (i.e., "No Trespassing") or prevents the public from using the easement, the tax abatement is revoked and a penalty may be assessed.  Recreational easement also includes such easements as equestrian, fishing, hunting, hiking, trapping, biking (e.g., Indiana's [[Calumet Trail]]) and other such uses.
* '''[[Conservation easement]].'''  Grants rights to a [[land trust]] to limit development in order to protect the environment.
* '''Historic preservation easement.'''  Similar to the conservation easement, typically grants rights to a [[historic preservation]] organization to enforce restrictions on alteration of a historic building's exterior or interior.
* '''Easement of [[lateral and subjacent support]].''' Prohibits an adjoining land owner from digging too deep on his lot or in any manner depriving his neighbor of vertical or horizontal support on the latter's structures, e.g., buildings, fences, etc.
* '''Communications easement'''. This easement can be used for wireless communications towers, cable lines, and other communications services. This is a private easement and the rights granted by the property owner are for the specific use of communications.
* '''Ingress/egress easement'''. This easement can be used for entering and exiting a property through or over the easement area.  This might be used for a person's driveway, going over another person's property.

== Trespass upon easement ==
Blocking access to someone who has an easement is a [[trespass]] upon the easement and creates a cause of action for civil suit.  For example, putting up a fence across a long-used public path through private property may be a trespass and a court may order the obstacle removed.  Turning off the water supply to a downstream neighbor may similarly trespass on the neighbor's water easement.

Open and continuous trespassing upon an easement can lead to the [[extinguishment]] of an easement by prescription (see above) if no action is taken to cure the limitation over an extended period.

== Torrens title registration ==
Under the [[Torrens title|Torrens title system]] of land ownership registration, easements and [[mortgages]] are recorded on the titles kept in the central [[land registration|land registry]] or [[cadastre]]. Any unrecorded easement is not recognised and no easement by prescription or implication may be claimed. However, in Australia, easements may be created by prescription or implication and enforced if an exception to indefeasibility is established, but they cannot be recorded on the title.

The '''economic calculation problem''' is a criticism of using [[economic planning]] as a substitute for [[Market (economics)|market-based]] allocation of the [[factors of production]]. It was first proposed by [[Ludwig von Mises]] in his 1920 article "[[Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth]]" and later expanded upon by [[Friedrich Hayek]].&lt;ref name="Mises"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. A. Hayek, (1935), "The Nature and History of the Problem" and "The Present State of the Debate," in F. A. Hayek, ed. ''Collectivist Economic Planning'', pp. 1–40, 201–43.&lt;/ref&gt; In his first article, Mises describes the nature of the price system under capitalism and describes how individual [[subjective value theory|subjective values]] are translated into the objective information necessary for [[Rational choice theory|rational]] allocation of resources in society.&lt;ref name="Mises"/&gt;

In market exchanges, prices reflect the [[supply and demand]] of resources, labor, and products. In his first article, Mises focused his criticism on the inevitable deficiencies of the [[Socialization (economics)|socialisation]] of capital goods, but Mises later went on to elaborate on various different forms of socialism in his book, ''[[Socialism (book)|Socialism]]''. Mises and Hayek argued that economic calculation is only possible by information provided through market prices, and that bureaucratic or technocratic methods of allocation lack methods to rationally allocate resources. The debate raged in the 1920s and 1930s, and that specific period of the debate has come to be known by [[Economic history|economic historians]] as ''The [[Socialist Calculation Debate]]''. Mises' initial criticism received multiple reactions and led to the conception of trial-and-error [[market socialism]], most notably the [[Lange–Lerner theorem]].

In the 1920 paper, Mises argued that the pricing systems in socialist economies were necessarily deficient because if a public entity owned all the [[means of production]], no rational prices could be obtained for [[capital goods]] as they were merely internal transfers of goods and not "objects of exchange", unlike final goods. Therefore, they were unpriced and hence the system would be necessarily irrational, as the central planners would not know how to allocate the available resources efficiently.&lt;ref name="Mises" /&gt; He wrote that "rational economic activity is impossible in a socialist [[commonwealth]]".&lt;ref name="Mises" /&gt; Mises developed his critique of socialism more completely in his 1922 book ''Socialism: An Economic and Sociological Analysis'', arguing that the market price system is an expression of [[praxeology]] and can not be replicated by any form of bureaucracy.

However, it is important to note that central planning has been criticized by socialists who advocated decentralized mechanisms of economic coordination, including [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]] [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Anarcho-communism|anarcho-communists]] [[Peter Kropotkin]] and [[Errico Malatesta]] before the [[Austrian school]] critique. Central planning was later criticized by socialist economists such as [[Janos Kornai]] and [[Alec Nove]]. [[Robin Cox]] has argued that the economic calculation argument can only be successfully rebutted on the assumption that a moneyless socialist economy was to a large extent spontaneously ordered via a self-regulating system of stock control which would enable decision-makers to allocate production goods on the basis of their relative scarcity using calculation in kind.  This was only feasible in an economy where most decisions were decentralised.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/215256501/The-Economic-Calculation-Controversy-Unravelling-of-a-Myth|title=The Economic Calculation Controversy, Unravelling of a Myth {{!}} Socialism {{!}} Capitalism|website=Scribd|language=en|access-date=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Theory==

=== Comparing heterogeneous goods ===
Since  capital goods and [[Labour economics|labor]] are highly heterogeneous (i.e., they have different characteristics that pertain to physical productivity), economic calculation requires a common basis for comparison for all forms of capital and labour.

[[Money]], as a [[means of exchange]], enables buyers to compare the costs of goods without having knowledge of their underlying factors; the consumer can simply focus on his personal cost-benefit decision. The price system is therefore said to promote economically efficient use of resources by agents who may not have explicit knowledge of all of the conditions of production or supply. This is called the [[Signalling (economics)|signalling]] function of [[price]]s, as well as the [[rationing]] function which prevents over-use of any resource.&lt;ref&gt;Murray N. Rothbard, "Man, Economy and the State" Chapter VIII Paragraph 6. p. 498
&lt;/ref&gt;

Without the market process to fulfill such comparisons, critics of non-market socialism say that it lacks any way to compare different goods and services and would have to rely on [[calculation in kind]]. The resulting decisions, it is claimed, would therefore be made without sufficient knowledge to be considered rational.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Relating utility to capital and consumption goods===
The common basis for comparison for capital goods must also be connected to [[consumer welfare]]. It must also be able to compare the desired trade-off between present consumption and delayed consumption (for greater returns later on), via investment in capital goods. The use of money as a medium of exchange and unit of account is necessary to solve the first two problems of economic calculation. Mises (1912) applied the [[marginal utility theory]] developed by [[Carl Menger]] to money.

Marginal consumer expenditures represent the marginal utility or additional consumer satisfaction expected by consumers as they spend money. This is similar to the ''equi-marginal principle'' developed by [[Alfred Marshall]]. Consumers equalize the marginal utility (amount of satisfaction) of the last dollar spent on each good. So the exchange of consumer goods establishes prices that represent the marginal utility of consumers, and money therefore is representative of consumer satisfaction.

If money is also spent on capital goods and labor, then it is possible to make comparisons between capital goods and consumer goods. The exchange of consumer and capital/labor goods does not imply that capital goods are valued accurately, only that it is possible for the valuations of capital goods to be made.

These first elements of the Calculation Critique of Socialism are the most basic element: economic calculation requires the use of money across all goods. This is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for successful economic calculation.

Without a price mechanism, Mises argues, socialism lacks the means to relate consumer satisfaction to economic activity. The incentive function of prices allows diffuse interests, like the interests of every household in cheap, high quality shoes, to compete with the concentrated interests of the cobblers in expensive, poor quality shoes. Without it, a panel of experts set up to ‘rationalise production’, likely closely linked to the cobblers for expertise, would tend to support the cobblers interests in a ‘conspiracy against the public’. If this happens to all industries however, everyone would be worse off than if they had been subject to the rigours of [[market competition]].

The von Mises theory of money and calculation conflicts directly with Marxist [[labour theory of value]]. Marxist theory allows for the possibility that Labour content can serve as a common means of valuing capital goods, a position now out of favour with economists following the success of the theory of [[marginal utility]].

===Entrepreneurship===
The third condition for economic calculation is the existence of genuine [[entrepreneurship]] and [[Competition (economics)|market rivalry]].

According to Kirzner (1973) and Lavoie (1985) entrepreneurs reap profits by supplying unfulfilled needs in all markets. Entrepreneurship therefore brings prices closer to marginal costs. The adjustment of prices in markets towards ‘equilibrium’ (where supply and demand equal) gives them greater utilitarian significance. The activities of entrepreneurs make prices more accurate in terms of how they represent the marginal utility of consumers. Prices act as guides to the planning of production. Those who plan production use prices to decide which lines of production should be expanded or curtailed.

Entrepreneurs lack the [[profit motive]] to take risks under socialism, and so are far less likely to attempt to supply consumer demands. Without the price system to match consumer utility to incentives for production, or even indicate those utilities "without providing incentives", state planners are much less likely to invest in new ideas to satisfy consumers' desires.

===Coherent planning===
The fourth condition for successful economic calculation is plan coordination among those who plan production. The problem of planning production is the knowledge problem explained by Hayek (1937, 1945), but first mentioned and illustrated by his mentor Ludwig von Mises in ''Socialism'' (1922), not to be mistaken with ''Socialism: An Economic and Sociological Analysis'' (1951). The planning could either be done in a decentralised fashion, requiring some mechanism to make the individual plans coherent, or centrally, requiring a lot of information.

Within capitalism, the overall plan for production is composed of individual plans from capitalists in large and small enterprises. Since capitalists purchase labour and capital out of the same common pool of available but scarce labor and capital, it is essential that their plans fit together in at least a semi-coherent fashion. Hayek (1937) defined an efficient planning process as one where all decision makers form plans that contain relevant data from the plans from others. Entrepreneurs acquire data on the plans from others through the price system. The price system is an indispensable communications network for plan coordination among entrepreneurs. Increases and decreases in prices inform entrepreneurs about the general economic situation, to which they must adjust their own plans.

As for socialism, Mises (1944) and Hayek (1937) insisted that bureaucrats in individual ministries could not coordinate their plans without a price system. If decentralized socialism cannot work, central authorities must plan production. But central planners face [[local knowledge problem|the local knowledge problem]] in forming a comprehensive plan for production. Mises and Hayek saw centralization as inevitable in socialism.

Opponents argued that in principle an economy can be seen as a set of equations. Thus, there should be no need for prices. Using information about available resources and the preferences of people, it should be possible to calculate an optimal solution for resource allocation. [[Friedrich von Hayek]] responded that the system of equations required too much information that would not be easily available and the ensuing calculations would be too difficult.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} This is partly because individuals possess useful knowledge but do not realise its importance, may have no incentive to transmit the information, or may have incentive to transmit false information about their preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

It may be impossible to make long-term predictions for a highly complex system such as an economy.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Bergstra, [http://www.phil.uu.nl/~janb/phloofin/eclog.html "Economic Logic: a survey and variations on the theme,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105024440/http://www.phil.uu.nl/~janb/phloofin/eclog.html |date=2007-01-05 }} Utrecht University, Department of Philosophy, section Theoretical Philosophy, group of Applied Logic. Retrieved 04.jan.2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayek (1935, 1937, 1940, 1945) stressed the knowledge problem of central planning, partly because decentralized socialism seemed indefensible. Part of the reason that Hayek stressed the knowledge problem was also because he was mainly concerned with debating the proposal for [[market socialism]] and the [[Lange Model]] by [[Oskar R. Lange]] (1938) and Hayek's student [[Abba Lerner]] (1934, 1937, 1938), which was developed in response to the calculation argument. Lange and Lerner conceded that prices were necessary in socialism. Lange and Lerner thought that socialist officials could simulate some markets (mainly spot markets) and the simulation of spot markets was enough to make socialism reasonably efficient. [[Oskar Lange]] argued that prices can be seen merely as an accounting practice. In principle, claim market socialists, socialist managers of state enterprises could use a price system, as an accounting system, in order to minimize costs and convey information to other managers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} However, while this can deal with existing stocks of goods, providing a basis for values can be ascertained, it does not deal with the investment in new capital stocks.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Hayek responded by arguing that the simulation of markets in socialism would fail due to a lack of genuine competition and entrepreneurship. Central planners would still have to plan production without the aid of economically meaningful prices. Lange and Lerner also admitted that socialism would lack any simulation of financial markets, and that this would cause problems in planning capital investment.

Hayek's argumentation is not only regarding computational complexity for the central planners, however. He further argues that much of the information individuals have cannot be collected or used by others. First, individuals may have no or little [[incentive]] to share their information with central or even local planners. Second, the individual may not be aware that he has valuable information, and when he becomes aware, it is only useful for a limited time, too short for it to be communicated to the central or local planners. Third, the information is useless to other individuals if it is not in a form that allows for meaningful comparisons of value (i.e., money prices as a common basis for comparison). Therefore, Hayek argues, individuals must acquire data through prices in real markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Financial markets===
The fifth condition for successful economic calculation is the existence of well functioning [[financial market]]s. Economic efficiency depends heavily upon avoiding errors in capital investment. The costs of reversing errors in capital investment are potentially large. This is not just a matter of rearranging or converting capital goods that are found to be of little use. The time spent reconfiguring the structure of production is time lost in the production of consumer goods. Those who plan capital investment must anticipate future trends in consumer demand if they are to avoid investing too much in some lines of production and too little in other lines of production.

Capitalists plan production for profit. Capitalists use prices to form expectations that determine the composition of capital accumulation, the pattern of investment across industry. Those who invest in accordance with consumers' desires are rewarded with profits, those who do not are forced to become more efficient or go out of business.

Prices in [[futures markets]] play a special role in economic calculation. Futures markets develop prices for commodities in future time periods. It is in futures markets that entrepreneurs sort out plans for production based on their expectations. Futures markets are a link between entrepreneurial investment decisions and household consumer decisions. Since most goods are not explicitly traded in futures markets, substitute markets are needed. The stock market serves as a ‘continuous futures market’ that evaluates entrepreneurial plans for production (Lachmann 1978). Generally speaking the problem of economic calculation is solved in financial markets.

{{quote|The problem of economic calculation arises in an economy which is perpetually subject to change ... In order to solve such problems it is above all necessary that capital be withdrawn from particular undertakings and applied in other lines of production ... [This] is essentially a matter of the capitalists who buy and sell stocks and shares, who make loans and recover them, who speculate in all kinds of commodities.&lt;ref&gt;Mises 1922 [1936] p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The existence of financial markets is a necessary condition for economic calculation. The existence of financial markets itself does not automatically imply that entrepreneurial speculation will tend towards efficiency. Mises argued that speculation in financial markets tends towards efficiency because of a “trial and error” process. Entrepreneurs who commit relatively large errors in investment waste their funds over expanding some lines of production at the cost of other more profitable ventures where consumer demand is higher. The entrepreneurs who commit the worst errors by forming the least accurate expectations of future consumer demands incur financial losses. Financial losses remove these inept entrepreneurs from positions of authority in industry.

Entrepreneurs who commit smaller errors by anticipating consumer demand more correctly attain greater financial success. The entrepreneurs who form the most accurate opinions regarding the future state of markets (i.e., new trends in consumer demands) earn the highest profits and gain greater control of industry. Those entrepreneurs who anticipate future market trends therefore waste the least amount of real capital and find the most favorable terms for finance on markets for financial capital. Minimal waste of real capital goods implies the minimization of the opportunity costs of capital- economic calculation. The value of capital goods is brought into line with the value of future consumer goods through competition in financial markets, because competition for profits among capitalist financiers rewards entrepreneurs who value capital more correctly (i.e., anticipating future prices more correctly) and eliminates capitalists who value capital least correctly.

To sum things up, the use of money in trading all goods (capital/labor and consumer) in all markets (spot and financial) combined with profit driven entrepreneurship and Darwinian natural selection in financial markets all combine to make rational economic calculation and allocation the outcome of the capitalist process.

Mises insisted that socialist calculation is impossible because socialism precludes the exchange of capital goods in terms of a generally accepted medium of exchange, or money. Investment in financial markets determines the capital structure of modern industry with some degree of efficiency. The egalitarian nature of socialism prohibits speculation in financial markets. Mises therefore concluded that socialism lacks any clear tendency towards improvement in the capital structure of industry.

===Example===
Ludwig von Mises gave the example of choosing between producing wine or oil:
{{quote|
It will be evident, even in the socialist society, that 1,000 hectolitres of wine are better than 800, and it is not difficult to decide whether it desires 1,000 hectolitres of wine rather than 500 of oil. There is no need for any system of calculation to establish this fact: the deciding element is the will of the economic subjects involved. But once this decision has been taken, the real task of rational economic direction only commences, i.e., economically, to place the means at the service of the end. That can only be done with some kind of economic calculation. The human mind cannot orient itself properly among the bewildering mass of intermediate products and potentialities of production without such aid. It would simply stand perplexed before the problems of management and location.&lt;ref name="Mises" /&gt;}}

Such intermediate products would include land, warehouse storage, bottles, barrels, oil, transport, etc. Not only would these things have to be assembled, but they would have to compete with the attainment of other economic goals. Without pricing for capital goods, essentially, Mises is arguing, it is impossible to know what their rational/most efficient use is. Investment is particularly impossible, as the potential future outputs cannot be measured by any current standard, let alone a monetary one required for economic calculation. The value consumers have for current consumption over future consumption cannot be expressed, quantified or implemented, as investment is independent from savings.

&lt;!-- THIS IS A PROBLEM OF CENTRAL PLANNING, NOT SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE PROBLEM OF ECONOMIC CALCULATION.  IT SHOULD PROBABLY BE MOVED TO THE CENTRAL PLANNING PAGE.

==Implementation of central planning decisions==
Hayek, in ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', also argues that the central administrative resource allocation, which often must take away resources and power from subordinate leader and groups, necessarily requires and therefore selects ruthless leaders and the continued strong threat of coercion and punishment in order for the plans to be somewhat effectively implemented. This, in combination of the failures of the central planning, slowly leads socialism down the road to an oppressive dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Criticisms==

=== Efficiency of markets ===
One criticism is that the claim that a free market is efficient at resource allocation is incorrect. Alec Nove argues that in "Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth" von Mises "tends to spoil his case by the implicit assumption that capitalism and optimum resource allocation go together".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Economist [[Joan Robinson]] argued many prices in modern capitalism are effectively "administered prices" created by "quasi monopolies", thus challenging the connection between capital markets and rational resource allocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The economist [[Robin Hahnel]] has argued that free markets are in fact systematically inefficient, because externalities are pervasive, and because real-world markets are rarely truly competitive or in equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Hahnel|Hahnel, Robin]] (2007). The Case Against Markets. ''Journal of Economic Issues''. Vol. XLI, No. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Milton Friedman]] agreed that markets with monopolistic competition are not efficient, but argued that in countries with [[free trade]], the pressure from foreign competition would make monopolies behave in a competitive manner.&lt;ref&gt;''Free to Choose'', Milton Friedman, 1979, Secker and Warburg&lt;/ref&gt; In countries with protectionist policies, foreign competition cannot fulfill this role but the threat of potential competition — that, were companies to abuse their position, new rivals could emerge and gain customers dissatisfied with the old companies — can still reduce the inefficiencies.

Other libertarian capitalist analysts believe that monopolies and big business are not generally the result of a free market. Rather they say that such concentration is enabled by governmental grants of franchises or privileges.&lt;ref&gt;Murray N. Rothbard, [https://mises.org/daily/3735 "Capitalism versus Statism,"] in ''Outside Looking In: Critiques of American Policies and Institutions, Left and Right'' (New York: Harper and Row, 1972), pp. 60–74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Toward a Theory of State Capitalism: Ultimate Decision-making and Class Structure", ''Journal of Libertarian Studies'', Vol.1. No. I, pp. 59–79. Pergamon Press 1977 https://mises.org/journals/jls/1_1/1_1_7.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; They adamantly oppose any distortion of market structure by the introduction of government influence, asserting that such interference would be a form of central planning or [[state capitalism]], insofar as it would redirect decision making from the private to the public sector.

[[Joseph Schumpeter]] argued that large firms generally drive economic advancement through innovation and investment, and so their proliferation is not necessarily bad.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equilibrium===
It has also been argued that the contention that finding a true economic equilibrium is not just hard but impossible for a central planner applies equally well to a market system. As any [[Universal Turing machine]] can do what any other Turing machine can, a central calculator in principle has no advantage over a system of dispersed calculators (i.e., a market), or vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In some economic models, finding an equilibrium is hard: for instance, finding an [[Arrow-Debreu model|Arrow-Debreu equilibrium]] is  [[PPAD (complexity)|PPAD-complete]]. If the market can find an equilibrium in polynomial time, then the equivalence above can be used to prove that P=PPAD.

| publisher = Mercatus Center of George Mason University}}&lt;/ref&gt; makes the same point in reverse. The market socialists pointed out the formal similarity between the neoclassical model of Walrasian general equilibrium and that of market socialism. Simply replace the Walrasian auctioneer with a planning board. However, this emphasizes the shortcomings of the model. According to Lavoie, the market socialists, by relying on this formal similarity must adopt the simplifying assumptions of the model. The model assumes that various sorts of information are "given" to the auctioneer or planning board. But without a capital market this information does not exist, and if it does exist, it exists in a fundamentally distributed form, unavailable to the planners. If the planners somehow captured this information, it would immediately become stale and relatively useless, unless reality somehow imitated the changeless monotony of the equilibrium model. The existence and usability of this information depends on its creation and situation within a distributed discovery procedure.

===Scale of problem===
One criticism is that proponents of the theory overstate the strength of their case by describing socialism as impossible rather than inefficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Economist [[Bryan Caplan]] wrote a piece explaining why he 'is not an [[Austrian School|Austrian economist]]'. In it, he discusses the economic calculation debate, and, while admitting that it is a problem for socialism, denies that Mises has shown it to be fatal, or that it is this particular problem that led to the collapse of the socialist states.

{{quote|Austrians have overused the economic calculation argument. In the absence of detailed empirical evidence showing that this particular problem is the most important one, it is just another argument out of hundreds on the list of arguments against socialism.

===Steady state economy===
Joan Robinson argued that in a [[steady state economy]] there would be an effective abundance of means of production, and so markets would not be needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|title= An essay on Marxism

|isbn= 0-333-02081-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Von Mises acknowledged such a theoretical possibility in his original tract: {{quote|The static state can dispense with economic calculation. For here the same events in economic life are ever recurring; and if we assume that the first disposition of the static socialist economy follows on the basis of the final state of the competitive economy, we might at all events conceive of a socialist production system which is rationally controlled from an economic point of view.&lt;ref name="Mises" /&gt;}}He contended, however, that stationary conditions never prevail in the real world. Changes in economic conditions are inevitable; and even if they were not, the transition to socialism would be so chaotic as to preclude the existence of such a steady state from the start.&lt;ref name="Mises" /&gt;

Some writers have argued that with detailed use of real unit accounting and demand surveys a planned economy could operate without a capital market, in a situation of [[Abundance (economics)|abundance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In a state of abundance, there is no such cost; which is to say that in situations where one need not economize, economics does not apply, e.g., areas with abundant fresh air and water.

===Use of technology===

}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Information and Economics: A Critique of Hayek" and Against Mises have argued that the use of computational technology now simplifies economic calculation and allows central planning to be implemented and sustained. Len Brewster has replied to this by arguing that ''Towards a New Socialism'' establishes what is essentially another form of a market economy:
{{Quote|text = an examination of C&amp;C’s New Socialism confirms Mises’s conclusion that rational socialist planning is impossible. It appears that in order for economic planners to have any useful data by which they might be guided, a market must be hauled in, and with it analogues of private property, inequality and exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/sites/default/files/qjae7_1_6.pdf Len Brewster on "Towards a new Socialism? by W. Paul Cockshott and Allin F. Cottrell. (Nottingham, U.K.: Spokesman Books, 1993)", Review Essay,] ''The Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics'', Vol.7, No.1 (Spring 2004): 65-77.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In response, Cockshott argued that the economic system is sufficiently far removed from a capitalist free-market economy to not count as one:
{{Quote|text = Those that Hayek was arguing against like Lange and Dickinson allowed for markets in consumer goods, this did not lead Hayek to say : Oh you are not really arguing for socialism since you have conceded a market in consumer goods, he did not, because there remained huge policy differences between him and Lange even if Lange accepted consumer goods markets. It is thus a very weak argument by Brewster to say that what we advocate is not really socialist calculation because it is contaminated in some way by market influences.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/download/6894611/replytobrewster.pdf Cockshott, Paul. "Notes for a critique of Brewster." (2009).]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cosma Shalizi articulated the problems that come with central planning using supercomputers in a 2012 essay. He cited the sheer complexity of the problem, as well as 
the difficulty of negotiating between preferences as being the central problems with such a system.&lt;ref&gt;http://crookedtimber.org/2012/05/30/in-soviet-union-optimization-problem-solves-you/ Shalizi, Cosma. "In Soviet Union, Optimization Problem Solves You." (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Leigh Phillips and Michal Rozworski are releasing a book in 2019 that argues that multinational corporations like Walmart and Amazon already operate centrally planned economies larger than the Soviet Union, proving that the economic calculation problem is surmountable.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.versobooks.com/books/2822-people-s-republic-of-walmart Verso Books, ''The Peoples Republic of Walmart: How the Biggest Corporations are Laying the Foundations for Socialism''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Enterprise information security architecture (EISA)''' is a part of [[enterprise architecture]] focusing on information security throughout the enterprise.  The name implies a difference that may not exist between small/medium-sized businesses and larger organizations.

== Overview ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
Enterprise information security architecture (EISA) is the practice of applying a comprehensive and rigorous method for describing a current and/or future structure and behavior for an organization's security processes, information security systems, personnel and organizational sub-units, so that they align with the organization's core goals and strategic direction. Although often associated strictly with [[information security]] technology, it relates more broadly to the security practice of business [[management science|optimization]] in that it addresses business security architecture, performance management and security process architecture as well.

Enterprise information security architecture is becoming a common practice within the [[financial institutions]] around the [[globe]]. The primary purpose of creating an enterprise information security architecture is to ensure that business strategy and IT security are aligned. As such, enterprise information security architecture allows [[traceability]] from the business strategy down to the underlying technology.

== Enterprise information security architecture topics ==

=== Positioning ===
[[Image:BITS.jpg|right|360px]]
Enterprise information security architecture was first formally positioned by [[Gartner]] in their [[whitepaper]] called “''Incorporating Security into the Enterprise Architecture Process''”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Incorporating Security Into the Enterprise Architecture Process|url=http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?ref=g_search&amp;id=488575|publisher=www.gartner.com|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was published on 24 January 2006. Since this publication, security architecture has moved from being a silo based architecture to an enterprise focused solution that incorporates business, [[information]] and [[technology]]. The picture below represents a one-dimensional view of enterprise architecture as a [[service-oriented architecture]]. It also reflects the new addition to the enterprise architecture family called “Security”. Business architecture, information architecture and technology architecture used to be called BIT for short. Now with security as part of the architecture family it has become BITS.

Security architectural change imperatives now include things like
* Business roadmaps
* [[Legislative]] and [[legal]] [[requirements]]
* [[Technology roadmaps]]
* Industry trends
* Risk trends
* Visionaries

=== Goals ===
* Provide structure, coherence and cohesiveness.
* Must enable business-to-security alignment.
* Defined top-down beginning with business strategy.
* Ensure that all models and implementations can be traced back to the business strategy, specific business requirements and key principles.
* Provide abstraction so that complicating factors, such as geography and technology religion, can be removed and reinstated at different levels of detail only when required.
*  Establish a common "language" for information security within the organization

=== Methodology ===
The practice of enterprise information security architecture involves developing an architecture security framework to describe a series of "current", "intermediate" and "target" [[reference architecture]]s and applying them to align programs of change. These frameworks detail the organizations, roles, entities and relationships that exist or should exist to perform a set of business processes. This framework will provide a rigorous taxonomy and ontology that clearly identifies what processes a business performs and detailed information about how those processes are executed and secured. The end product is a set of artifacts that describe in varying degrees of detail exactly what and how a business operates and what security controls are required. These artifacts are often graphical.

Given these descriptions, whose levels of detail will vary according to affordability and other practical considerations, decision makers are provided the means to make informed decisions about where to invest resources, where to realign organizational goals and processes, and what policies and procedures will support core missions or business functions.

A strong enterprise information security architecture process helps to answer basic questions like:
* What is the information security risk posture of the organization?
* Is the current architecture supporting and adding value to the security of the organization?
* How might a security architecture be modified so that it adds more value to the organization?
* Based on what we know about what the organization wants to accomplish in the future, will the current security architecture support or hinder that?

Implementing enterprise information security architecture generally starts with documenting the organization's strategy and other necessary details such as where and how it operates. The process then cascades down to documenting discrete core competencies, business processes, and how the organization interacts with itself and with external parties such as customers, suppliers, and government entities.

Having documented the organization's strategy and structure, the architecture process then flows down into the discrete information technology components such as:

* Organization charts, activities, and process flows of how the IT Organization operates
* Organization cycles, periods and timing
* Suppliers of technology hardware, software, and services
* Applications and software inventories and diagrams
* Interfaces between applications - that is: events, messages and data flows
* Intranet, Extranet, Internet, eCommerce, EDI links with parties within and outside of the organization
* Data classifications, Databases and supporting data models
* Hardware, platforms, hosting: servers, network components and security devices and where they are kept
* Local and wide area networks, Internet connectivity diagrams

Wherever possible, all of the above should be related explicitly to the organization's strategy, [[Objective (goal)|goals]], and [[Business operations|operations]]. The enterprise information security architecture will document the current state of the technical security components listed above, as well as an ideal-world desired future state (Reference Architecture) and finally a "Target" future state which is the result of engineering tradeoffs and compromises vs. the ideal. Essentially the result is a nested and interrelated set of models, usually managed and maintained with specialised [[software]] available on the market.

Such exhaustive mapping of IT [[dependency (project management)|dependencies]] has notable overlaps with both [[metadata]] in the general IT sense, and with the [[ITIL]] concept of the [[configuration management database]]. Maintaining the [[accuracy]] of such data can be a significant challenge.

Along with the models and [[diagrams]] goes a set of best practices aimed at securing adaptability, [[scalability]], manageability etc. These systems engineering [[best practices]] are not unique to enterprise information security architecture but are essential to its success nonetheless. They involve such things as componentization, [[asynchronous communication]] between major components, [[standardization]] of key identifiers and so on.

Successful application of enterprise information security architecture requires appropriate positioning in the organization. The analogy of city-planning is often invoked in this connection, and is instructive.

An intermediate outcome of an architecture process is a comprehensive inventory of business security strategy, business security processes, [[organizational chart]]s, technical security inventories, system and interface diagrams, and network topologies, and the explicit relationships between them. The inventories and diagrams are merely tools that support decision making. But this is not sufficient. It must be a living process.

The organization must design and implement a process that ensures continual movement from the current state to the future state. The future state will generally be a combination of one or more

* Closing gaps that are present between the current organization strategy and the ability of the IT security dimensions to support it
* Closing gaps that are present between the desired future organization strategy and the ability of the security dimensions to support it
* Necessary upgrades and replacements that must be made to the IT security architecture based on supplier viability, age and performance of hardware and software, capacity issues, known or anticipated regulatory requirements, and other issues not driven explicitly by the organization's functional management.
* On a regular basis, the current state and future state are redefined to account for evolution of the architecture, changes in organizational strategy, and purely external factors such as changes in technology and customer/vendor/government requirements, and changes to both internal and external threat landscapes over time.

== High-level security architecture framework ==
[[File:Huxham Security Framework.jpg|thumbnail|right|Huxham Security Framework]]

Enterprise information security architecture frameworks is only a subset of enterprise architecture frameworks. If we had to simplify the [[concept]]ual [[abstraction]] of enterprise information security architecture within a generic framework, the picture on the right would be acceptable as a high-level conceptual security architecture framework.

== Relationship to other IT disciplines ==
Enterprise information security architecture is a key component of the [[information security]] technology governance process at any organization of significant size. More and more [[companies]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} are implementing a formal enterprise security architecture process to support the [[governance]] and [[management]] of IT.

However, as noted in the opening paragraph of this article it ideally relates more broadly to the practice of business optimization in that it addresses business security architecture, performance management and process security architecture as well. Enterprise Information Security Architecture is also related to IT security portfolio management and [[metadata]] in the enterprise IT sense.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2680">'''The Fascist Union of Youth''' ({{lang-ru|Союз Фашистской Молодёжи}}, ''Soyuz Fashistskoy Molodyozhi'') was the [[youth organization]] of the [[Russian Fascist Party]]. It was founded in 1936 in [[Harbin]], [[Manchukuo]], which consisted of all automatic members of the organizations VFP from ages 16 to 25.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Ideology and tactics of the Union is entirely determined by ideology and tactics of the Russian Fascist Party. 
Admission to the Union was carried out automatically: all members of the organization VFP appropriate age, regardless of gender. Members of the Union remained part of the VFP.&lt;ref&gt;Окороков А.

The Union was divided into two groups, Junior and Senior, each of which had two levels, Second Level (Young Fascist) and First Level (Avangardisty). Members had to pass certain exams to advance to a higher level. Those who successfully passed to the second stage of the Union were enrolled in the [[Pyotr Stolypin|Stolypin]] Fascist Academy.
 
The Union had cultural, educational, dramatic and philosophical circles, as well as sewing and language schools. The military and political sections were the most important ones in the Union. Structural units of the Union were branches of the Department of the [[Russian Fascist Party|VFP]]. The head of the Union was appointed by the Head of the VFP and the remaining leaders were appointed by the head of the Union.

The '''contingency model''' by business and management psychologist [[Fred Fiedler]] is a [[contingency theory]] concerned with the effectiveness of a leader in an organization.

== Premises ==
The most common situational theory was developed by Fred Fiedler. Fiedler believed that an individual’s leadership style is the result of their experiences throughout the lifespan, therefore it is extremely difficult to change (Aamodt, 2015). Fiedler would argue that rather than teaching people a particular leadership style, instead one should concentrate on helping people understand their particular leadership style and learn how to match that style to the particular situation (Aamodt, 2015). In order to help one understand their specific leadership style, Fiedler developed the Least-Preferred Coworker Scale (Aamodt, 2015). According to Fiedler, because leadership behavior is fixed effectiveness could only be improved by restructuring tasks or changing the amount of power the leader had over organizational factors such as salary, disciplinary action, and promotions (Armandi, 2003). 
Fiedler’s model does have some weaknesses. For example, some leaders may be more effective in certain situations than others (Kest, 2006). The LPC scale can be questioned because the assessment is performed by one individual on another (Kest, 2006).

The theory holds that the effectiveness of a task group or of an organization depends on two main factors: the personality of the leader and the degree to which the situation gives the leader power, control, and influence over the situation or, conversely, the degree to which the situation confronts the leader with uncertainty (Nebeker, 1974).

To Fiedler, stress is a key determinant of leader effectiveness (Fiedler and Garcia 1987; Fiedler et al. 1994), and a distinction is made between stress related to the leader’s superior, and stress related to subordinates or the situation itself. In stressful situations, leaders dwell on the stressful relations with others and cannot focus their intellectual abilities on the job. Thus, intelligence is more effective and used more often in stress-free situations. Fiedler concludes that experience impairs performance in low-stress conditions but contributes to performance under high-stress conditions. As with other situational factors, for stressful situations Fiedler recommends altering or engineering the leadership situation to capitalize on the leader’s strengths.

Fiedler’s situational contingency theory holds that group effectiveness depends on an appropriate match between a leader’s style (essentially a trait measure) and the demands of the situation. Fiedler considers situational control the extent to which a leader can determine what their group is going to do to be the primary contingency factor in determining the effectiveness of leader behavior.

Fiedler’s contingency model is a dynamic model where the personal  characteristics and motivation of the leader are said to interact with the current situation that the group faces. Thus, the contingency model marks a shift away from the tendency to attribute leadership effectiveness to personality alone (Forsyth, 2006).

==Least preferred co-worker (LPC)==

The leadership style of the leader, thus, fixed and measured by what he calls the least preferred co-worker (LPC) scale, an instrument for measuring an individual’s leadership orientation. The  LPC scale asks a leader to think of all the people with whom they have ever worked and then describe the person with whom they have worked least well, using a series of bipolar scales of 1 to 8, such as the following:
{|border=0 align=center
|-
| align=right|Unfriendly
| align=center|1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
| align=left|Friendly
|-
| align=right|Uncooperative
| align=center|1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
| align=left|Cooperative
|-
| align=right|Hostile
| align=center|1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
| align=left|Supportive
|-
| align=right|....
| align=center|1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
| align=left|....
|-
| align=right|Guarded
| align=center|1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
| align=left|Open
|}
A high LPC score suggests that the leader has a "human relations orientation", while a low LPC score indicates a "task orientation". Fiedler assumes that everybody's least preferred coworker in fact is on average about equally unpleasant. But people who are indeed relationship motivated, tend to describe their least preferred coworkers in a more positive manner, e.g., more pleasant and more efficient. Therefore, they receive higher LPC scores. People who are task motivated, on the other hand, tend to rate their least preferred coworkers in a more negative manner. Therefore, they receive lower LPC scores. So, the Least Preferred Coworker (LPC) scale is actually not about the least preferred worker at all, instead, it is about the person who takes the test; it is about that person's motivation type. This is so, because, individuals who rate their least preferred coworker in relatively favorable light on these scales derive satisfaction out of interpersonal relationship, and those who rate the coworker in a relatively unfavorable light get satisfaction out of successful task performance. This method reveals an individual's emotional reaction to people they cannot work with. Critics point out that this is not always an accurate measurement of leadership effectiveness.  Fiedler expanded his studies outside of the lab and showed the interrelations between adjustment, group performance and leadership style in a volunteer medical team under different conditions of stress while working in isolated villages of Central America.  The task-oriented leader performed better in situations that were favorable and relatively unfavorable while the relationship-oriented leader only fared better in situations of intermediate favorableness. &lt;ref&gt;The effect of leadership style upon the performance and adjustment of volunteer teams operating in stressful foreign environment.  Fred Fiedler, Gordon O’Brien, Daniel Ilgen.  Human Relations. 1969. Vol 22. Number 6. P 503-514. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Situational favourableness==

According to Fiedler, the ability to control the group situation (the second component of the contingency model) is crucial for a leader. This is because only leaders with situational control can be confident that their orders and suggestions will be carried out by their followers. Leaders who are unable to assume control over the group situation cannot be sure that the members they are leading will execute their commands. Because situational control is critical to leadership efficacy, Fiedler broke this factor down into three major components: leader-member relations, task structure, and position power (Forsyth, 2006). Moreover, there is no ideal leader. Both low-LPC (task-oriented) and high-LPC (relationship-oriented) leaders can be effective if their leadership orientation fits the situation. The contingency theory allows for predicting the characteristics of the appropriate situations for effectiveness. Three situational components determine the favourableness of situational control:
# Leader-Member Relations, referring to the degree of mutual trust, respect and confidence between the leader and the subordinates. When leader-member relations in the group are poor, the leader has to shift focus away from the group task in order to regulate behavior and conflict within the group (Forsyth, 2006).
# Task Structure, referring to the extent to which group tasks are clear and structured. When task structure is low (unstructured), group tasks are ambiguous, with no clear solution or correct approach to complete the goal. In contrast, when task structure is high (structured), the group goal is clear, unambiguous and straightforward: members have a clear idea about the how to approach and reach the goal (Forsyth, 2006).
# Leader Position Power, referring to the power inherent in the leader's position itself.
When there is a good leader-member relation, a highly structured task, and high leader position power, the situation is considered a "favorable situation." Fiedler found that low-LPC leaders are more effective in extremely favourable or unfavourable situations, whereas high-LPC leaders perform best in situations with intermediate favourability. Leaders in high positions of power have the ability to distribute resources among their members, meaning they can reward and punish their followers. Leaders in low position power cannot control resources to the same extent as leaders  in high power, and so lack the same degree of situational control. For example, the CEO of a business has high position power, because she is able to increase and reduce the salary that her employees receive. On the other hand, an office worker in this same business has low position power, because although they may be the leader on a new business deal, they cannot control the situation by rewarding or disciplining their colleagues with salary changes (Forsyth, 2006).

==Leader-situation match and mismatch==
Since personality is relatively stable though it can be changed, the contingency model suggests that improving effectiveness requires changing the situation to fit the leader. This is called "job engineering" or "job restructuring". The organization or the leader may increase or decrease task structure and position power, also training and group development may improve leader-member relations. In his 1976 book ''Improving Leadership Effectiveness: The Leader Match Concept'', Fiedler (with Martin Chemers and Linda Mahar) offers a self paced leadership training programme designed to help leaders alter the favourableness of the situation, or situational control.

One implication of "job engineering" or "job restructuring" through additional training is that if all leaders are given the same training regardless of their position in the contingency model, it could create a mismatch between the leader and situation. "The right person for a particular job today may be the wrong person in six months or in one or two years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fiedler |first1=Fred E. |title=The Contingency Model--New Directions for Leadership Utilization |journal=Journal of Contemporary Business |date=Autumn 1974 |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=65-80}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a company has a workshop for all managers that effectively changed the task structure from low to high, it might seem good for the company at first glance, but it is important to note that leaders who were effective in a low task structure situation could become very ineffective in a situation with a high task structure.       
===Examples===
* Task-oriented leadership would be advisable in natural disaster, like a flood or fire. In an uncertain situation the leader-member relations are usually poor, the task is unstructured, and the position power is weak. The one who emerges as a leader to direct the group's activity usually does not know subordinates personally. The task-oriented leader who gets things accomplished proves to be the most successful. If the leader is considerate (relationship-oriented), they may waste so much time in the disaster, that things get out of control and lives are lost.
* Blue-collar workers generally want to know exactly what they are supposed to do. Therefore, their work environment is usually highly structured. The leader's position power is strong if management backs their decision. Finally, even though the leader may not be relationship-oriented, leader-member relations may be extremely strong if they can gain promotions and salary increases for subordinates. Under these situations the task-oriented style of leadership is preferred over the (considerate) relationship-oriented style.
* The [[considerateness|considerate]] (relationship-oriented) style of leadership can be appropriate in an environment where the situation is moderately favorable or certain. For example, when (1) leader-member relations are good, (2) the task is structured, and (3) position power is either strong or weak. Situations like this exist with [[research]] [[scientist]]s, who do not like superiors to structure the task for them. They prefer to follow their own creative leads in order to solve problems. In a situation like this a considerate style of leadership is preferred over the task-oriented.

== Practical Applications ==
[[File:Fiedlers model adapted.svg|alt=Fiedler Model Job Aid|thumb|345x345px|Figure adapted from Northouse, Contingency Theory, Chapter 5.1, p.76]]

Fiedler’s LPC can be difficult to interpret. In 2018, University of Wisconsin Executive MBA students of Alex Stajkovic’s Organizational Behavior class developed the following figure, to better analyze situations for best fit. This diagram allows quick diagnosis of leader-member relationship first, followed by task structure, and finally application the layer of leader’s position of power. Each layer is assessed in context of the one around it, to guide the viewer to the appropriate fit for the given situation. Furthermore, it allows the viewer to see how this need changes as one of the other dynamics is adjusted, which can indicate a need for a new leader who is a better fit, or a shift in situational circumstances to return to a better environment for the assigned leader to continue to flourish.

==Opposing views==
Researchers often find that Fiedler's contingency theory falls short on flexibility. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} They also noticed that LPC scores can fail to reflect the personality traits they are supposed to reflect{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}.

Fiedler’s contingency theory has drawn criticism because it implies that the only alternative for an unalterable mismatch of leader orientation and an unfavorable situation is changing the leader. The model’s validity has also been disputed, despite many supportive tests (Bass 1990). The contingency model does not take into account the percentage of "intermediate favourability" situations vs. "extremely favourable or unfavourable situations", hence, does not give a complete picture of the comparison between low-LPC leaders and high-LPC leaders.

Other criticisms concern the methodology of measuring leadership style through the LPC inventory and the nature of the supporting evidence (Ashour 1973; Schriesheim and Kerr 1977a, 1977b; Vecchio 1977, 1983). Fiedler and his associates have provided decades of research to support and refine the contingency theory. {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

[[Cognitive Resource Theory]] (CRT) modifies Fiedler’s basic contingency model by adding traits of the leader (Fiedler and Garcia 1987). CRT tries to identify the conditions under which leaders and group members will use their intellectual resources, skills and knowledge effectively. While it has been generally assumed that more intelligent and more experienced leaders will perform better than those with less intelligence and experience, this assumption is not supported by Fiedler’s research.

A '''fisheries subsidy''' is a government action that confers an advantage on consumers or extractors of fish in order to supplement their income or lower their cost.

==Extent of fisheries subsidies==
The estimates on the global amounts of [[fisheries]] subsidies vary and range from USD $15–35 billion annually.&lt;ref&gt;UNEP – United Nations Environmental Programme (2008) Fisheries Subsidies: A Critical Issue for Trade and Sustainable Development at the WTO: An Introductory Guide. UNEP, Geneva.&lt;/ref&gt; The range of estimates is partially due to fact that fisheries subsidies come in many shapes and forms. Fisheries subsidies include direct transfers of funds, income or price support measures, tax credits, exemptions and rebates, low-interest loans and guarantees, preferential treatment and use of regulatory support mechanisms. Not all estimates include government funding for fisheries management, such data collection and control and enforcement, or the possible absence of access fees.

==Impact of subsidies==
It is acknowledged that some forms of fisheries subsidies can threaten the sustainability of fisheries resources by encouraging overcapacity and excess fishing effort, thus reducing the long-term viability of the fishing industry. States committed at the 2002 [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (WSSD) to eliminate subsidies that contribute to illegal, unregulated, and unreported (IUU) fishing and overcapacity.&lt;ref&gt;Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, paragraph 31(f).&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, parties to the [[World Trade Organization]] agreed to strengthen disciplines on fisheries subsidies, including through a prohibition of certain forms of fisheries subsidies that contribute to overcapacity and overfishing.&lt;ref&gt;WTO (2005) Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration, Annex D paragraph 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Freeway removal''' is a [[public policy]] of [[urban planning]] policy to demolish [[freeways]] and create [[mixed-use]] urban areas, parks, residential, commercial, or other land uses. Such highway removal is often part of a policy to promote [[smart growth]], [[transit-oriented development]], [[Walkability|walkable]] and [[bicycle-friendly]] cities. In some cases freeways are re-imagined as [[boulevard]]s, rebuilt as tunneled freeways (see [[tunnel]]s) or relocated through less densely-developed areas.

== Urban design ==
Urban freeways were built to expedite traffic into and out of cities in the mid 20th century. Many of these freeways were built through dense neighborhoods, and destroyed blocks and sometimes entire neighborhoods in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://iqc.ou.edu/2014/12/12/60yrsmidwest/|title=60 Years of Urban Change: Midwest|date=2014-12-12|work=The Institute for Quality Communities|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cities, strategies were implemented or planned for freeway removal policies to tear down highways that cut through neighborhoods. These freeways created blight that minimized use of land space and reduced the quality of life for city residents. The alternative that some cities have chosen for [[urban design]] is to replace elevated highways with [[boulevard]]s to restore neighborhoods affected by highway construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://carfreeamerica.net/2017/09/11/reconnecting-cities-through-urban-highway-removals/|title=Reconnecting Cities through Urban Highway Removals - Car Free America|date=2017-09-11|work=Car Free America|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some regions, freeway removal has been proposed but these plans have not yet been completed or funded. In many cases, there are political battles between citizens' groups who are proponents of freeway removal proposals and drivers that want to keep the freeways.&lt;ref name="preservation"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.preservenet.com/freeways/FreewaysPlansProposals.html |title= Freeway Removal Plans and Proposals |author= Staff |publisher= Preservation Institute |year= 2007 |accessdate= November 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To increase land usage, the demolition of freeways is often a part of the discussion for both city and state’s governmental strategies. Cities planning redevelopment of certain neighborhoods, such as [[Washington, D.C.]]’s [[Whitehurst Freeway]] in the neighborhood of [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]], were set for demolition but were frozen so the city may do an environmental impact study.  Other cities – such as [[Nashville, Tennessee]], whose government is planning to demolish the downtown loop where three major interstates ([[I-65]], [[I-40]], and [[I-24]]) converge – are planning to replace these areas with parks, boulevards, and mixed-use communities that will reconnect their cores with adjacent neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="preservation"/&gt;

== Urban intensification ==
[[File:Korea-Seoul-Cheonggyecheon-01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cheonggyecheon]] in [[Seoul]], South Korea was formerly the route for a major elevated highway; It was completed in 1976 and removed in 2005.]]
To counteract urban sprawl, some cities have made redevelopment plans around urban intensification. Urban intensification – also known as [[Compact City|Compact Cities]] in Europe – is an urban planning technique which promotes high residential density with mixed land uses based around an efficient public transport system. Typically, cities redevelop neighborhoods to concentrate growth in the center of the city with the goal of better land usage to support a high concentration of jobs and residents.  [[Smart growth]] principles and incentives generate residential, retail, and recreational development.  The purpose is to transform deteriorating, low-density commercial corridors into mixed-use corridors that focus around [[transit-oriented development]]. Cities have implemented plans to use intensification corridors functioning as [[boulevard]]s aimed at being transit supportive and pedestrian friendly, and provide\ a focus for higher density mixed-use development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Melissa |last= Shih |title= Municipal Conformity to the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe: An Evaluation of Future Density Potential Along the Fairview Street Intensification Corridor in Burlington, Ontario |location= Kingston, ON |publisher= Queens University |year= 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of transit oriented development along these corridors with subsequent increase in transit ridership has been well documented in neighborhoods such as [[Ballston, Arlington, Virginia|Ballston]] and [[Rosslyn, Arlington, Virginia|Rosslyn]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Urban Form Case Studies |publisher= Ontario Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure |year= 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other cities, such as Portland Oregon, have implemented freeway removal policies to create intensification corridors.  Much of this began in the [[freeway and expressway revolts]] of the 1960s and 1970s.

== Boulevards and urban design ==
[[Portland, Oregon]] and [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] executed freeway removal projects that reduced traffic , spurred economic development, and allowed for the creation of new neighborhoods and commercial districts. The [[Harbor Drive]] Freeway in Portland was replaced by [[Tom McCall Waterfront Park]], while the [[Park East Freeway]] in Milwaukee recovered prime land for development in the urban core.  In [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], the easternmost portion of the [[Gardiner Expressway]], which was located between Don Road and Leslie Street, was demolished in 2000 and replaced with an at-grade urban boulevard with traffic lights, railroad crossings and a [[bike trail]].

After acute damage to San Francisco's double-decked [[Embarcadero Freeway]] occurred during the [[Loma Prieta earthquake]] in 1989, it was demolished, but only after several years' wait &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Timeline-A-look-back-at-the-Embarcadero-2642356.php, accessed July 19, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced by a boulevard flanked by the restored Beaux-Arts style Ferry Building.&lt;ref&gt;http://streetswiki.wikispaces.com/Embarcadero+Freeway+Removal, accessed July 19, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Underground relocation==
In some situations where removing an urban freeway would exacerbate traffic problems within a city, urban planners may resort to constructing [[tunnel]]s to relocate the freeway underground and reclaim the surface space previously occupied by the facility.

In [[Boston]], Massachusetts, the [[Central Artery]] ([[Interstate 93]]) ran through the center of the city on an elevated green viaduct from its opening in the 1950s until 2005.  The freeway divided historic neighborhoods and business districts in downtown Boston, and it was referred to as Boston's "other [[Green Monster]]."  During the 1990s and early 2000s, a $15 billion project known as the [[Big Dig]] relocated the Central Artery into tunnels underneath downtown Boston; the old viaduct was demolished, and its path was reclaimed for a surface boulevard and park space.

A similar project is underway to replace the crumbling [[Alaskan Way Viaduct]] in [[Seattle]], Washington, with [[Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement tunnel|a tunnel]] that will carry the [[Washington State Route 99|SR-99]] freeway underneath the city.

==Projects==

'''Gamal Abdel Nasser Hussein''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ɑː|s|ər|,_|ˈ|n|æ|s|ər}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/nasser "Nasser"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-ar|جمال عبد الناصر حسين}},&lt;!--''{{unicode|Gamāl or Jamāl ‘Abd an-Nāṣir}}''/''{{unicode|Gamāl ‘Abd an-Nāṣir}}'' {{transl|DIN|Ǧamāl ʿAbd al-Nāṣir}} all fail to represent pronunciation--&gt; {{IPA-arz|ɡæˈmæːl ʕæbdenˈnɑːsˤeɾ ħeˈseːn}}; 15 January 1918&amp;nbsp;– 28 September 1970) was the [[List of Presidents of Egypt|second President of Egypt]], serving from 1956 until his death in 1970. Nasser led the [[1952 Egyptian coup d'état|1952 overthrow of the monarchy]] and introduced [[Egyptian land reform|far-reaching land reform]]s the following year. Following a 1954 attempt on his life by a [[Muslim Brotherhood]] member, he cracked down on the organization, put President [[Mohamed Naguib]] under [[house arrest]] and assumed executive office, officially becoming president [[Egyptian referendum, 1956|in June 1956]].

Nasser's popularity in Egypt and the [[Arab world]] skyrocketed after his [[nationalization]] of the [[Suez Canal]] and his political victory in the subsequent [[Suez Crisis]]. Calls for [[Arab Union|pan-Arab unity]] under his leadership increased, culminating with the formation of the [[United Arab Republic]] with [[Syria]] from 1958 to 1961. In 1962, Nasser began a series of major [[Arab socialism|socialist]] measures and modernization reforms in Egypt. Despite setbacks to his [[pan-Arabist]] cause, by 1963 Nasser's supporters gained power in several Arab countries, but he became embroiled in the [[North Yemen Civil War]] and eventually the much larger [[Arab Cold War]]. He began his second presidential term [[United Arab Republic presidential confirmation referendum, 1965|in March 1965]] after his political opponents were banned from running. Following Egypt's defeat by [[Israel]] in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], Nasser resigned, but he returned to office after popular demonstrations called for his reinstatement. By 1968, Nasser had appointed himself Prime Minister, launched the [[War of Attrition]] to regain lost territory, began a process of depoliticizing the military and issued a set of political liberalization reforms. After the conclusion of the [[1970 Arab League summit]], Nasser suffered a heart attack and died. His funeral in [[Cairo]] drew five million mourners and an outpouring of grief across the Arab world.

Nasser remains an iconic figure in the Arab world, particularly for his strides towards [[social justice]] and Arab unity, modernization policies and [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] efforts. [[Nasser era|His presidency]] also encouraged and coincided with an Egyptian cultural boom and launched large industrial projects, including the [[Aswan Dam]] and [[Helwan]] city. Nasser's detractors criticize his [[authoritarianism]], his [[human rights violation]]s and his dominance of military over civil institutions, establishing a pattern of military and [[dictator]]ial rule in Egypt.

==Early life==
[[File:Gamal Abdel Nasser.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Nasser, 1931|alt=A boy wearing a jacket, a white shirt with a black tie and a fez on his head]]

Nasser was born on 15 January 1918 in [[Bakos]], [[Alexandria]], Egypt. Nasser's father was Abdel Nasser Hussein and his mother was Fahima Nasser. &lt;ref name="V23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Vatikiotis|1978|pp=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser's father was a postal worker&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Joesten|1974|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; born in [[Beni Mur]] in [[Upper Egypt]] and raised in Alexandria,&lt;ref name="V23"/&gt; and his mother's family came from [[Mallawi]], [[Minya Governorate|el-Minya]].&lt;ref name="Stephens 23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stephens|1972|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents married in 1917.&lt;ref name="Stephens 23"/&gt; Nasser has two brothers, Izz al-Arab and al-Leithi.&lt;ref name="V23"/&gt; Nasser's biographers Robert Stephens and [[Said Aburish]] wrote that Nasser's family believed strongly in the "Arab notion of glory", since the name of Nasser's brother, Izz al-Arab, translates to "Glory of the Arabs"—a rare name in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Aburish12-13"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasser's family traveled frequently due to his father's work. In 1921, they moved to [[Asyut]] and, in 1923, to [[Khatatba]], where Nasser's father ran a post office. Nasser attended a primary school for the children of railway employees until 1924, when he was sent to live with his paternal uncle in [[Cairo]], and to attend the Nahhasin elementary school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stephens|1972|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasser exchanged letters with his mother and visited her on holidays. He stopped receiving messages at the end of April 1926. Upon returning to Khatatba, he learned that his mother had died after giving birth to his third brother, Shawki, and that his family had kept the news from him.&lt;ref name="Stephens 28-32"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stephens|1972|pp=28–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander14"&gt;{{Harvnb|Alexander|2005|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser later stated that "losing her this way was a shock so deep that time failed to remedy".&lt;ref name="BibliothecaHoda"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nasser.bibalex.org/Common/pictures01-%20sira_en.htm#1 |title=A Historical Sketch of Gamal Abdel Nasser |publisher=[[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]] |first=Hoda |last=Abdel Nasser |accessdate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He adored his mother and the injury of her death deepened when his father remarried before the year's end.&lt;ref name="Stephens 28-32"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aburish8-9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="V24"&gt;{{Harvnb|Vatikiotis|1978|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, Nasser went to Alexandria to live with his maternal grandfather and attend the city's Attarin elementary school.&lt;ref name="Alexander14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BibliothecaHoda"/&gt; He left in 1929 for a private boarding school in [[Helwan]], and later returned to Alexandria to enter the Ras el-Tin secondary school and to join his father, who was working for the city's postal service.&lt;ref name="Alexander14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BibliothecaHoda"/&gt; It was in Alexandria that Nasser became involved in political activism.&lt;ref name="Alexander14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stephens|1972|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; After witnessing clashes between protesters and police in Manshia Square,&lt;ref name="BibliothecaHoda"/&gt; he joined the demonstration without being aware of its purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Joesten|1974|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protest, organized by the [[ultranationalist]] [[Young Egypt Party (1933)|Young Egypt Society]], called for the end of colonialism in Egypt in the wake of the [[Egyptian Constitution of 1923|1923 Egyptian constitution]]'s annulment by Prime Minister [[Isma'il Sidqi]].&lt;ref name="BibliothecaHoda"/&gt; Nasser was arrested and detained for a night&lt;ref name="Litvin39"&gt;{{Harvnb|Litvin|2011|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; before his father bailed him out.&lt;ref name="Alexander14"/&gt;

[[File:Al-Gihad's mention of Nasser, 1935.jpg|thumb|upright|Nasser's name circled in ''Al-Gihad'']]

When his father was transferred to Cairo in 1933, Nasser joined him and attended al-Nahda al-Masria school.&lt;ref name="BibliothecaHoda"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander15"&gt;{{Harvnb|Alexander|2005|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took up acting in school plays for a brief period and wrote articles for the school's paper, including a piece on French philosopher [[Voltaire]] titled "Voltaire, the Man of Freedom".&lt;ref name="BibliothecaHoda"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander15"/&gt; On 13 November 1935, Nasser led a student demonstration against British rule, protesting against a statement made four days prior by UK foreign minister [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Samuel Hoare]] that rejected prospects for the 1923 Constitution's restoration.&lt;ref name="BibliothecaHoda"/&gt; Two protesters were killed and Nasser received a graze to the head from a policeman's bullet.&lt;ref name="Litvin39"/&gt; The incident garnered his first mention in the press: the nationalist newspaper ''Al Gihad'' reported that Nasser led the protest and was among the wounded.&lt;ref name="BibliothecaHoda"/&gt;&lt;ref name="J66"&gt;{{Harvnb|Joesten|1974|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 December, the new king, [[Farouk of Egypt|Farouk]], issued a decree restoring the constitution.&lt;ref name="BibliothecaHoda"/&gt;

Nasser's involvement in political activity increased throughout his school years, such that he only attended 45 days of classes during his last year of secondary school.&lt;ref name="Alexander19-20"&gt;{{Harvnb|Alexander|2005|pp=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stephens|1972|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite it having the almost unanimous backing of Egypt's political forces, Nasser strongly objected to the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936|1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty]] because it stipulated the continued presence of British military bases in the country.&lt;ref name="BibliothecaHoda"/&gt; Nonetheless, political unrest in Egypt declined significantly and Nasser resumed his studies at al-Nahda,&lt;ref name="Alexander19-20"/&gt; where he received his [[leaving certificate]] later that year.&lt;ref name="BibliothecaHoda"/&gt;

===Early influences===
Aburish asserts that Nasser was not distressed by his frequent relocations, which broadened his horizons and showed him Egyptian society's [[class division]]s.&lt;ref name="Aburish11-2"/&gt; His own social status was well below the wealthy Egyptian elite, and his discontent with those born into wealth and power grew throughout his lifetime.&lt;ref name="Alexander27"/&gt; Nasser spent most of his spare time reading, particularly in 1933 when he lived near the [[Egyptian National Library and Archives|National Library of Egypt]]. He read the [[Qur'an]], the [[Hadith|sayings]] of [[Muhammad]], the lives of the [[Sahaba]] (Muhammad's companions),&lt;ref name="Aburish11-2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the biographies of nationalist leaders [[Napoleon]], [[Atatürk]], [[Otto von Bismarck]], and [[Garibaldi]] and the [[My Early Life|autobiography]] of [[Winston Churchill]].&lt;ref name="BibliothecaHoda"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Litvin39"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander16"&gt;{{Harvnb|Alexander|2005|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Books Gamal Abdel Nasser Used to Read, 1. During his Secondary School Years |url=http://nasser.bibalex.org/Common/pictures01-%20sira4_en.htm#1 |publisher=[[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]] |accessdate=20 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasser was greatly influenced by [[Egyptian nationalism]], as espoused by politician [[Mustafa Kamil Pasha|Mustafa Kamel]], poet [[Ahmed Shawqi]],&lt;ref name="Aburish11-2"/&gt; and his anti-colonialist instructor at the [[Egyptian Military Academy|Royal Military Academy]], [[Aziz al-Masri]], to whom Nasser expressed his gratitude in a 1961 newspaper interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Talhami|2007|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was especially influenced by Egyptian writer [[Tawfiq al-Hakim]]'s novel ''Return of the Spirit'', in which al-Hakim wrote that the Egyptian people were only in need of a "man in whom all their feelings and desires will be represented, and who will be for them a symbol of their objective".&lt;ref name="Litvin39"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander16"/&gt; Nasser later credited the novel as his inspiration to launch the [[1952 Egyptian coup d'état|1952 coup d'état]].&lt;ref name="Alexander16"/&gt;

==Military career==
[[File:NasserLawSchool.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Nasser at law school in 1937|alt=A man wearing a tweed, pinstriped jacket and a tie. His hair is raised and black and he has a thin mustache.]]
In 1937, Nasser applied to the Royal Military Academy for army officer training,&lt;ref name="Aburish15"/&gt; but his police record of anti-government protest initially blocked his entry.&lt;ref name="Alexander20"&gt;{{Harvnb|Alexander|2005|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disappointed, he enrolled in the law school at [[King Fuad University]],&lt;ref name="Alexander20"/&gt; but quit after one semester to reapply to the Military Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reid|1981|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; From his readings, Nasser, who frequently spoke of "dignity, glory, and freedom" in his youth,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; became enchanted with the stories of national liberators and heroic conquerors; a military career became his chief priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Convinced that he needed a ''[[wasta]]'', or an influential intermediary to promote his application above the others, Nasser managed to secure a meeting with Under-Secretary of War Ibrahim Khairy Pasha,&lt;ref name="Aburish15"/&gt; the person responsible for the academy's selection board, and requested his help.&lt;ref name="Alexander20"/&gt; Khairy Pasha agreed and sponsored Nasser's second application,&lt;ref name="Aburish15"/&gt; which was accepted in late 1937.&lt;ref name="Alexander20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cook41"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cook|2011|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser focused on his military career from then on, and had little contact with his family. At the academy, he met [[Abdel Hakim Amer]] and [[Anwar Sadat]], both of whom became important aides during his presidency.&lt;ref name="Aburish15"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from the academy in July 1938,&lt;ref name="BibliothecaHoda"/&gt; he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the infantry, and posted to [[Mankabad]].&lt;ref name="Alexander27"&gt;{{Harvnb|Alexander|2005|pp=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was here that Nasser and his closest comrades, including Sadat and Amer, first discussed their dissatisfaction at widespread corruption in the country and their desire to topple the monarchy. Sadat would later write that because of his "energy, clear-thinking, and balanced judgement", Nasser emerged as the group's natural leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nasser with comrades, 1940.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Two seated men in military uniform and wearing fez hats|Nasser (center) with [[Ahmed Mazhar|Ahmed Mazhar]] (left) in army, 1940]]
In 1941, Nasser was posted to [[Khartoum]], Sudan, which was part of Egypt at the time. Nasser returned to Egypt in September 1942 after a brief stay in Sudan, then secured a position as an instructor in the Cairo Royal Military Academy in May 1943.&lt;ref name="Alexander27"/&gt; In 1942, the British Ambassador [[Miles Lampson]] marched into King Farouk's palace and ordered him to dismiss Prime Minister [[Hussein Sirri Pasha]] for having pro-[[Axis Powers|Axis]] sympathies. Nasser saw the [[Abdeen Palace Incident of 1942|incident]] as a blatant violation of Egyptian sovereignty and wrote, "I am ashamed that our army has not reacted against this attack",&lt;ref name="Aburish18"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wished for "calamity" to overtake the British.&lt;ref name="Aburish18"/&gt; Nasser was accepted into the General Staff College later that year.&lt;ref name="Aburish18"/&gt; He began to form a group of young military officers with strong nationalist sentiments who supported some form of revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nutting|1972|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser stayed in touch with the group's members primarily through Amer, who continued to seek out interested officers within the [[Egyptian Armed Forces|Egyptian Armed Force's]] various branches and presented Nasser with a complete file on each of them.&lt;ref name="Aburish"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1948 Arab–Israeli War===

Nasser's first battlefield experience was in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stephens|1972|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; He initially volunteered to serve with the [[Arab Higher Committee]] (AHC) led by [[Mohammad Amin al-Husayni]]. Nasser met with and impressed al-Husayni,&lt;ref name="Aburish23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was ultimately refused entry to the AHC's forces by the Egyptian government for reasons that were unclear.&lt;ref name="Aburish23"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1948, following the [[Mandatory Palestine|British]] withdrawal, King Farouk sent the Egyptian army into Israel,&lt;ref name="Aburish25-26"/&gt; with Nasser serving in the 6th Infantry Battalion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Heikal|1973|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, he wrote of the Egyptian army's unpreparedness, saying "our soldiers were dashed against fortifications".&lt;ref name="Aburish25-26"/&gt; Nasser was deputy commander of the Egyptian forces that secured the [[Al-Faluja|Faluja pocket]] (commanded by Said Taha Bey&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=ud3T_TSMy9sC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66|title=Warrior: An Autobiography|last=Sharon|first=Ariel|last2=Chanoff|first2=David|date=2002-03-16|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9780743234641|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; nicknamed the "Sudanese tiger" by the Israelis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.israeldefense.co.il/he/content/%D7%9E%D7%91%D7%A6%D7%A2-%D7%97%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%91-1949-%E2%80%93-%D7%AA%D7%97%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%AA%D7%94-%D7%A9%D7%9C-%D7%94%D7%A4%D7%A1%D7%A7%D7%AA-%D7%90%D7%A9-%D7%A2%D7%9D-%D7%9E%D7%A6%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D|title=מבצע חורב 1949 – תחילתה של הפסקת אש עם מצרים|access-date=2017-12-06|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;). On 12 July, he was lightly wounded in the fighting. By August, his brigade was surrounded by the [[Israeli Army]]. Appeals for help from [[Jordan]]'s [[Arab Legion]] went unheeded, but the brigade refused to surrender. Negotiations between [[Israel]] and Egypt finally resulted in the ceding of Faluja to Israel.&lt;ref name="Aburish25-26"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to veteran journalist [[Eric Margolis (journalist)|Eric Margolis]], the defenders of Faluja, "including young army officer Gamal Abdel Nasser, became national heroes" for enduring Israeli bombardment while isolated from their command.&lt;ref name="Brightman"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brightman|2004|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still stationed after the war in the Falluja enclave, Nasser agreed to an Israeli request to identify 67 killed soldiers of the [[God's Company (Israel)|"religious platoon"]]. The expedition was led by Rabbi [[Shlomo Goren]] and Nasser personally accompanied him, ordering the Egyptian soldiers to stand at attention. They spoke briefly, and according to Goren, after learning what the square phylacteries found with the soldiers were, Nasser told him that he "now understands their courageous stand". During an interview on Israeli TV in 1971, Rabbi Goren claimed the two agreed to meet again when the time of peace comes.&lt;ref&gt;Israeli TV, "Such a Life" 1971,  interviewing Rabbi Shlomo Goren along with witnesses to the event (in Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART2/749/890.html 67 dead, Who remembers "God's platoon"] [[Maariv]] (NRG website, in Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Egyptian singer [[Umm Kulthum]] hosted a public celebration for the officers' return despite reservations from the royal government, which had been pressured by the British to prevent the reception. The apparent difference in attitude between the government and the general public increased Nasser's determination to topple the monarchy.&lt;ref name="Dokos"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dokos|2007|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser had also felt bitter that his brigade had not been relieved despite the resilience it displayed.&lt;ref name="Pollack"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pollack|2002|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started writing his book ''Philosophy of the Revolution'' during the siege.&lt;ref name="Brightman"/&gt;

After the war, Nasser returned to his role as an instructor at the Royal Military Academy.&lt;ref name="Heikal17"/&gt; He sent emissaries to forge an alliance with the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] in October 1948, but soon concluded that the religious agenda of the Brotherhood was not compatible with his nationalism. From then on, Nasser prevented the Brotherhood's influence over his cadres' activities without severing ties with the organization.&lt;ref name="Aburish25-26"/&gt; Nasser was sent as a member of the Egyptian delegation to [[Rhodes]] in February 1949 to negotiate a formal [[1949 Armistice Agreements|armistice]] with Israel, and reportedly considered the terms to be humiliating, particularly because the Israelis were able to easily [[Operation Uvda|occupy]] the [[Eilat]] region while negotiating with the Arabs in March.&lt;ref name="Aburish27"/&gt;

Nasser's return to Egypt coincided with [[Husni al-Za'im]]'s Syrian [[coup d'état]].&lt;ref name="Aburish27"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its success and evident popular support among the Syrian people encouraged Nasser's revolutionary pursuits.&lt;ref name="Aburish27"/&gt; Soon after his return, he was summoned and interrogated by Prime Minister [[Ibrahim Abdel Hadi]] regarding suspicions that he was forming a secret group of dissenting officers.&lt;ref name="Aburish27"/&gt; According to secondhand reports, Nasser convincingly denied the allegations.&lt;ref name="Aburish27"/&gt; Abdel Hadi was also hesitant to take drastic measures against the army, especially in front of its chief of staff, who was present during the interrogation, and subsequently released Nasser.&lt;ref name="Aburish27"/&gt; The interrogation pushed Nasser to speed up his group's activities.&lt;ref name="Aburish27"/&gt;

After 1949, the group adopted the name "[[Free Officers Movement (Egypt)|Association of Free Officers]]" and advocated "little else but freedom and the restoration of their country’s dignity".&lt;ref name="Heikal17"&gt;{{Harvnb|Heikal|1973|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser organized the Free Officers' founding committee, which eventually comprised fourteen men from different social and political backgrounds, including representation from Young Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood, the Egyptian Communist Party, and the aristocracy.&lt;ref name="Aburish27"/&gt; Nasser was unanimously elected chairman of the organization.&lt;ref name="Aburish27"/&gt;

In the 1950 parliamentary elections, the [[Wafd Party]] of el-Nahhas gained a victory—mostly due to the absence of the Muslim Brotherhood, which boycotted the elections—and was perceived as a threat by the Free Officers as the Wafd had campaigned on demands similar to their own.&lt;ref name="Aburish30"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accusations of corruption against Wafd politicians began to surface, however, breeding an atmosphere of rumor and suspicion that consequently brought the Free Officers to the forefront of Egyptian politics.&lt;ref name="Aburish32"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; By then, the organization had expanded to around ninety members; according to [[Khaled Mohieddin]], "nobody knew all of them and where they belonged in the hierarchy except Nasser".&lt;ref name="Aburish32"/&gt; Nasser felt that the Free Officers were not ready to move against the government and, for nearly two years, he did little beyond officer recruitment and underground news bulletins.&lt;ref name="Aburish33"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 October 1951, the Wafd government abrogated the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, which had given the British control over the Suez Canal until 1956.&lt;ref name="Aburish33"/&gt; The popularity of this move, as well as that of government-sponsored guerrilla attacks against the British, put pressure on Nasser to act.&lt;ref name="Aburish33"/&gt; According to Sadat, Nasser decided to wage "a large scale assassination campaign".&lt;ref name="Aburish34"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1952, he and [[Hassan Ibrahim]] attempted to kill the royalist general [[Hussein Sirri Amer]] by firing their submachine guns at his car as he drove through the streets of Cairo.&lt;ref name="Aburish34"/&gt; Instead of killing the general, the attackers wounded an innocent female passerby.&lt;ref name="Aburish34"/&gt; Nasser recalled that her wails "haunted" him and firmly dissuaded him from undertaking similar actions in the future.&lt;ref name="Aburish34"/&gt;

Sirri Amer was close to King Farouk, and was nominated for the presidency of the Officer's Club—normally a ceremonial office—with the king's backing.&lt;ref name="Aburish34"/&gt; Nasser was determined to establish the independence of the army from the monarchy, and with Amer as the intercessor, resolved to field a nominee for the Free Officers.&lt;ref name="Aburish34"/&gt; They selected [[Mohamed Naguib]], a popular general who had offered his resignation to Farouk in 1942 over British high-handedness and was wounded three times in the Palestine War.&lt;ref name="Aburish34-5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naguib won overwhelmingly and the Free Officers, through their connection with a leading Egyptian daily, ''al-Misri'', publicized his victory while praising the nationalistic spirit of the army.&lt;ref name="Aburish34-5"/&gt;

===Revolution of 1952===

Seated, left to right: [[Sulayman Hafez]], [[Mohamed Naguib]] and Nasser]]
On 25 January 1952, a confrontation between British forces and police at [[Ismailia]] resulted in the deaths of 40 Egyptian policemen, provoking riots in Cairo the next day which left 76 people dead. Afterwards, Nasser published a simple six-point program in ''[[Rose al-Yūsuf]]'' to dismantle [[feudalism]] and British influence in Egypt. In May, Nasser received word that Farouk knew the names of the Free Officers and intended to arrest them; he immediately entrusted Free Officer Zakaria Mohieddin with the task of planning the government takeover by army units loyal to the association.&lt;ref name="Aburish39"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=35–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Free Officers' intention was not to install themselves in government, but to re-establish a parliamentary democracy. Nasser did not believe that a low-ranking officer like himself (a [[lieutenant colonel]]) would be accepted by the Egyptian people, and so selected General Naguib to be his "boss" and lead the coup in name. The revolution they had long sought was launched on 22 July and was declared a success the next day. The Free Officers seized control of all government buildings, radio stations, and police stations, as well as army headquarters in Cairo. While many of the rebel officers were leading their units, Nasser donned civilian clothing to avoid detection by royalists and moved around Cairo monitoring the situation.&lt;ref name="Aburish39"/&gt; In a move to stave off foreign intervention two days before the revolution, Nasser had notified the American and British governments of his intentions, and both had agreed not to aid Farouk.&lt;ref name="Aburish39"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nutting|1972|pp=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under pressure from the Americans, Nasser had agreed to exile the deposed king with an honorary ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stephens|1972|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 June 1953, the monarchy was abolished and the Republic of Egypt declared, with Naguib as its [[President of Egypt|first president]].&lt;ref name="Aburish39"/&gt; According to Aburish, after assuming power, Nasser and the Free Officers expected to become the "guardians of the people's interests" against the monarchy and the [[pasha]] class while leaving the day-to-day tasks of government to civilians.&lt;ref name="Aburish41"/&gt; They asked former prime minister Ali Maher to accept reappointment to his previous position, and to form an all-civilian cabinet.&lt;ref name="Aburish41"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Free Officers then governed as the [[Egyptian Revolutionary Command Council|Revolutionary Command Council]] (RCC) with Naguib as chairman and Nasser as vice-chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nutting|1972|pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relations between the RCC and Maher grew tense, however, as the latter viewed many of Nasser's schemes—agrarian reform, abolition of the monarchy, reorganization of political parties&lt;ref name="Dekmejian24"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dekmejian|1971|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;—as too radical, culminating in Maher's resignation on 7 September. Naguib assumed the additional role of prime minister, and Nasser that of deputy prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stephens|1972|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, the [[Egyptian land reform|Agrarian Reform Law]] was put into effect.&lt;ref name="Dekmejian24"/&gt; In Nasser's eyes, this law gave the RCC its own identity and transformed the coup into a revolution.&lt;ref name="Aburish45"/&gt;

Preceding the reform law, in August 1952, communist-led riots broke out at textile factories in [[Kafr el-Dawwar]], leading to a clash with the army that left nine people dead. While most of the RCC insisted on executing the riot's two ringleaders, Nasser opposed this. Nonetheless, the sentences were carried out. The Muslim Brotherhood supported the RCC, and after Naguib's assumption of power, demanded four ministerial portfolios in the new cabinet. Nasser turned down their demands and instead hoped to co-opt the Brotherhood by giving two of its members, who were willing to serve officially as independents, minor ministerial posts.&lt;ref name="Aburish45"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disputes with Naguib===

In January 1953, Nasser overcame opposition from Naguib and banned all political parties,&lt;ref name="Aburish46-7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating a one-party system under the Liberation Rally, a loosely structured movement whose chief task was to organize pro-RCC rallies and lectures,&lt;ref name="Kandil22"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kandil|2012|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Nasser its [[secretary-general]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kandil|2012|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the dissolution order, Nasser was the only RCC member who still favored holding parliamentary elections, according to his fellow officer [[Abdel Latif Boghdadi (politician)|Abdel Latif Boghdadi]].&lt;ref name="Aburish46-7"/&gt; Although outvoted, he still advocated holding elections by 1956.&lt;ref name="Aburish46-7"/&gt; In March 1953, Nasser led the Egyptian delegation negotiating a British withdrawal from the Suez Canal.&lt;ref name="Aburish51"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Naguib began showing signs of independence from Nasser by distancing himself from the RCC's land reform decrees and drawing closer to Egypt's established political forces, namely the Wafd and the Brotherhood,&lt;ref name="Kandil27"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kandil|2012|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser resolved to depose him.&lt;ref name="Aburish51"/&gt; In June, Nasser took control of the interior ministry post from Naguib loyalist [[Sulayman Hafez]],&lt;ref name="Kandil27"/&gt; and pressured Naguib to conclude the abolition of the monarchy.&lt;ref name="Aburish51"/&gt;

On 25 February 1954, Naguib announced his resignation after the RCC held an official meeting without his presence two days prior.&lt;ref name="Kandil32"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kandil|2012|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 February, Nasser accepted the resignation, put Naguib under house arrest,&lt;ref name="Kandil32"/&gt; and the RCC proclaimed Nasser as both RCC chairman and prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nutting|1972|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Naguib intended, a mutiny immediately followed, demanding Naguib's reinstatement and the RCC's dissolution.&lt;ref name="Kandil32"/&gt; While visiting the striking officers at Military Headquarters (GHQ) to call for the mutiny's end, Nasser was initially intimidated into accepting their demands.&lt;ref name="Kandil33"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kandil|2012|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 27 February, Nasser's supporters in the army launched a raid on the GHQ, ending the mutiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kandil|2012|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day, hundreds of thousands of protesters, mainly belonging to the Brotherhood, called for Naguib's return and Nasser's imprisonment.&lt;ref name="Kandil35"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kandil|2012|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, a sizable group within the RCC, led by Khaled Mohieddin, demanded Naguib's release and return to the presidency.&lt;ref name="Aburish51"/&gt; Nasser acquiesced, but delayed Naguib's reinstatement until 4 March, allowing him to promote Amer to Commander of the Armed Forces—a position formerly occupied by Naguib.&lt;ref name="Aburish52"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 March, Nasser's security coterie arrested thousands of participants in the uprising.&lt;ref name="Kandil35"/&gt; As a ruse to rally opposition against a return to the pre-1952 order, the RCC decreed an end to restrictions on monarchy-era parties and the Free Officers' withdrawal from politics.&lt;ref name="Kandil35"/&gt; The RCC succeeded in provoking the beneficiaries of the revolution, namely the workers, peasants, and petty bourgeois, to oppose the decrees,&lt;ref name="Kandil36"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kandil|2012|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; with one million transport workers launching a strike and thousands of peasants entering Cairo in protest in late March.&lt;ref name="Kandil38"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kandil|2012|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naguib sought to crack down on the protesters, but his requests were rebuffed by the heads of the security forces.&lt;ref name="Kandil39"/&gt; On 29 March, Nasser announced the decrees' revocation in response to the "impulse of the street".&lt;ref name="Kandil39"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kandil|2012|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between April and June, hundreds of Naguib's supporters in the military were either arrested or dismissed, and Mohieddin was informally exiled to [[Switzerland]] to represent the RCC abroad.&lt;ref name="Kandil39"/&gt; [[King Saud]] of [[Saudi Arabia]] attempted to mend relations between Nasser and Naguib, but to no avail.&lt;ref name="Aburish53"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assuming chairmanship of RCC===

[[File:Nasser mansheya incident.oga|thumb|Sound recording of 1954 assassination attempt on Nasser while he was addressing a crowd in Manshia, [[Alexandria]]. ]]
On 26 October 1954, Muslim Brotherhood member Mahmoud Abdel-Latif attempted to assassinate Nasser while he was delivering a speech in Alexandria to celebrate the British military withdrawal. The speech was broadcast to the Arab world via radio. The gunman was {{convert|25|ft|m}} away from him and fired eight shots, but all missed Nasser. Panic broke out in the mass audience, but Nasser maintained his posture and raised his voice to appeal for calm.&lt;ref name="Aburish55"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogan228"/&gt; With great emotion he exclaimed the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;My countrymen, my blood spills for you and for Egypt. I will live for your sake and die for the sake of your freedom and honor. Let them kill me; it does not concern me so long as I have instilled pride, honor, and freedom in you. If Gamal Abdel Nasser should die, each of you shall be Gamal Abdel Nasser ... Gamal Abdel Nasser is of you and from you and he is willing to sacrifice his life for the nation.&lt;ref name="Rogan228"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rogan|2011|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Nasser and RCC members welcomed by Alexandria, 1954.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A man standing in an open-top vehicle and waving to a crowd of people surrounding the vehicle.

The crowd roared in approval and Arab audiences were electrified. The assassination attempt backfired, quickly playing into Nasser's hands.&lt;ref name="Aburish54"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon returning to Cairo, he ordered one of the largest political crackdowns in the modern history of Egypt,&lt;ref name="Aburish54"/&gt; with the arrests of thousands of dissenters, mostly members of the Brotherhood, but also communists, and the dismissal of 140 officers loyal to Naguib.&lt;ref name="Aburish54"/&gt; Eight Brotherhood leaders were sentenced to death,&lt;ref name="Aburish54"/&gt; although the sentence of its chief ideologue, [[Sayyid Qutb]], was commuted to a 15-year imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|2000|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naguib was removed from the presidency and put under house arrest, but was never tried or sentenced, and no one in the army rose to defend him. With his rivals neutralized, Nasser became the undisputed leader of Egypt.&lt;ref name="Rogan228"/&gt;

Nasser's street following was still too small to sustain his plans for reform and to secure him in office.&lt;ref name="Aburish56"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; To promote himself and the Liberation Rally, he gave speeches in a cross-country tour,&lt;ref name="Aburish56"/&gt; and imposed controls over the country's [[Egyptian newspapers|press]] by decreeing that all publications had to be approved by the party to prevent "sedition".&lt;ref name="AtiyehOweiss331–2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Atiyeh|Oweis|1988|pp=331–332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Umm Kulthum and [[Abdel Halim Hafez]], the leading Arab singers of the era, performed songs praising Nasser's nationalism. Others produced plays denigrating his political opponents.&lt;ref name="Aburish56"/&gt; According to his associates, Nasser orchestrated the campaign himself.&lt;ref name="Aburish56"/&gt; [[Arab nationalist]] terms such "Arab homeland" and "Arab nation" frequently began appearing in his speeches in 1954–55, whereas prior he would refer to the Arab "peoples" or the "Arab region".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jankowski|2001|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1955, the RCC appointed him as their president, pending national elections.&lt;ref name="Aburish56"/&gt;

Nasser made secret contacts with Israel in 1954–55, but determined that peace with Israel would be impossible, considering it an "expansionist state that viewed the Arabs with disdain".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 February 1955, Israeli troops [[Operation Black Arrow|attacked]] the Egyptian-held Gaza Strip with the stated aim of suppressing [[Palestinian fedayeen]] raids. Nasser did not feel that the Egyptian Army was ready for a confrontation and did not retaliate militarily. His failure to respond to Israeli military action demonstrated the ineffectiveness of his armed forces and constituted a blow to his growing popularity.&lt;ref name="Rasler38"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rasler|Thompson|Ganguly|2013|pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dekmeijan44"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dekmejian|1971|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser subsequently ordered the tightening of the blockade on Israeli shipping through the [[Straits of Tiran]] and restricted the use of airspace over the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] by Israeli aircraft in early September.&lt;ref name="Rasler38"/&gt; The Israelis re-militarized the [[Auja al-Hafir|al-Auja Demilitarized Zone]] on the Egyptian border on 21 September.&lt;ref name="Dekmeijan44"/&gt;

Simultaneous with Israel's February raid, the [[Baghdad Pact]] was formed between some regional allies of the UK. Nasser considered the Baghdad Pact a threat to his efforts to eliminate British military influence in the Middle East, and a mechanism to undermine the [[Arab League]] and "perpetuate [Arab] subservience to Zionism and [Western] imperialism".&lt;ref name="Rasler38"/&gt; Nasser felt that if he was to maintain Egypt's regional leadership position he needed to acquire modern weaponry to arm his military. When it became apparent to him that [[Western world|Western countries]] would not supply Egypt under acceptable financial and military terms,&lt;ref name="Rasler38"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dekmeijan44"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kandil45-6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kandil|2012|pp=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser turned to the [[Eastern Bloc]] and concluded a {{currency|320 million|USD}} armaments agreement with [[Czechoslovakia]] on 27 September.&lt;ref name="Rasler38"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dekmeijan44"/&gt; Through the [[Egyptian-Czech arms deal|Czechoslovakian arms deal]], the balance of power between Egypt and Israel was more or less equalized and Nasser's role as the Arab leader defying the West was enhanced.&lt;ref name="Dekmeijan44"/&gt;

===Adoption of neutralism===

At the [[Asian–African Conference|Bandung Conference]] in [[Indonesia]] in late April 1955, Nasser was treated as the leading representative of the Arab countries and was one of the most popular figures at the summit.&lt;ref name="TanAcharya12"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tan|Acharya|2008|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dekmeijan43"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dekmejian|1971|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had paid earlier visits to [[Pakistan]] (April 9),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ginat|2010|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; India (April 14),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ginat|2010|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Burma]], and [[Afghanistan]] on the way to Bandung,&lt;ref name="Jankowski65-6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Jankowski|2001|pp=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; and previously cemented a treaty of friendship with India in Cairo on 6 April, strengthening [[Egypt–India relations|Egyptian–Indian relations]] on the international policy and economic development fronts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ginat|2010|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasser mediated discussions between the pro-Western, pro-Soviet, and neutralist conference factions over the composition of the "Final Communique"&lt;ref name="TanAcharya12"/&gt; addressing colonialism in Africa and Asia and the fostering of global peace amid the [[Cold War]] between the West and the [[Soviet Union]]. At Bandung, Nasser sought a proclamation for the avoidance of international defense alliances, support for the independence of [[Tunisia]], [[Algeria]], and [[Morocco]] from [[French colonialism|French rule]], support for the [[Palestinian right of return]], and the implementation of UN resolutions regarding the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]]. He succeeded in lobbying the attendees to pass resolutions on each of these issues, notably securing the strong support of [[China]] and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ginat|2010|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Bandung, Nasser officially adopted the "positive neutralism" of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]n president [[Josip Broz Tito]] and Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] as a principal theme of Egyptian foreign policy regarding the Cold War.&lt;ref name="Dekmeijan43"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cook|2011|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser was welcomed by large crowds of people lining the streets of Cairo on his return to Egypt on 2 May and was widely heralded in the press for his achievements and leadership in the conference. Consequently, Nasser's prestige was greatly boosted as was his self-confidence and image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ginat|2010|pp=111–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1956 constitution and presidency===
[[File:Nasser voting constitutional referendum.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=A man wearing a suit inserting a piece of paper into a box. He is being photographed by cameramen|Nasser submitting his vote for the referendum of the proposed constitution, 23 June 1956]]
With his domestic position considerably strengthened, Nasser was able to secure primacy over his RCC colleagues and gained relatively unchallenged decision-making authority,&lt;ref name="Jankowski65-6"/&gt; particularly over foreign policy.&lt;ref name="Jankowski67"&gt;{{Harvnb|Jankowski|2001|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1956, the new [[Egyptian Constitution of 1956|Constitution of Egypt]] was drafted, entailing the establishment of a single-party system under the National Union (NU),&lt;ref name="Jankowski67"/&gt; a movement Nasser described as the "cadre through which we will realize our revolution".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alexander|2005|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NU was a reconfiguration of the Liberation Rally,&lt;ref name="Ansari84"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ansari|1986|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Nasser determined had failed in generating mass public participation.&lt;ref name="Peretz242"&gt;{{Harvnb|Peretz|1994|p=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the new movement, Nasser attempted to incorporate more citizens, approved by local-level party committees, in order to solidify popular backing for his government.&lt;ref name="Peretz242"/&gt; The NU would select a nominee for the presidential election whose name would be provided for public approval.&lt;ref name="Jankowski67"/&gt;

Nasser's nomination for the post and the new constitution were put to [[Egyptian referendum, 1956|public referendum]] on 23 June and each was approved by an overwhelming majority.&lt;ref name="Jankowski67"/&gt; A 350-member [[People's Assembly (Egypt)|National Assembly]] was established,&lt;ref name="Ansari84"/&gt; elections for which were held in July 1957. Nasser had ultimate approval over all the candidates.&lt;ref name="Peretz241"&gt;{{Harvnb|Peretz|1994|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution granted [[women's suffrage]], prohibited gender-based discrimination, and entailed special protection for women in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sullivan|1986|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coinciding with the new constitution and Nasser's presidency, the RCC dissolved itself and its members resigned their military commissions as part of the transition to civilian rule.&lt;ref name="Dekmejian45"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dekmejian|1971|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the deliberations surrounding the establishment of a new government, Nasser began a process of sidelining his rivals among the original Free Officers, while elevating his closest allies to high-ranking positions in the cabinet.&lt;ref name="Jankowski67"/&gt;

==Nationalization of the Suez Canal==

After the three-year transition period ended with Nasser's official assumption of power, his domestic and independent foreign policies increasingly collided with the regional interests of the UK and France. The latter condemned his strong support for [[Algerian War of Independence|Algerian independence]], and the UK's [[Anthony Eden|Eden government]] was agitated by Nasser's campaign against the Baghdad Pact.&lt;ref name="Dekmejian45"/&gt; In addition, Nasser's adherence to neutralism regarding the Cold War, recognition of communist China, and [[Egyptian-Czech arms deal|arms deal with the Eastern bloc]] alienated the United States. On 19 July 1956, the US and UK abruptly withdrew their offer to finance construction of the Aswan Dam,&lt;ref name="Dekmejian45"/&gt; citing concerns that Egypt's economy would be overwhelmed by the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|James|2008|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasser was informed of the British–American withdrawal via a news statement while aboard a plane returning to Cairo from [[Belgrade]], and took great offense.&lt;ref name="James150"&gt;{{Harvnb|James|2008|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although ideas for nationalizing the Suez Canal were in the offing after the UK agreed to withdraw its military from Egypt in 1954 (the last British troops left on 13 June 1956), journalist [[Mohamed Hassanein Heikal]] asserts that Nasser made the final decision to nationalize the waterway between 19 and 20 July.&lt;ref name="James150"/&gt; Nasser himself would later state that he decided on 23 July, after studying the issue and deliberating with some of his advisers from the dissolved RCC, namely Boghdadi and technical specialist [[Mahmoud Younis]], beginning on 21 July.&lt;ref name="James150"/&gt; The rest of the RCC's former members were informed of the decision on 24 July, while the bulk of the cabinet was unaware of the nationalization scheme until hours before Nasser publicly announced it.&lt;ref name="James150"/&gt; According to Ramadan, Nasser's decision to nationalize the canal was a solitary decision, taken without consultation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Podeh|2004|pp=105–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 July 1956, Nasser gave a speech in Alexandria announcing the nationalization of the [[Suez Canal Company]] as a means to fund the Aswan Dam project in light of the British–American withdrawal.&lt;ref name="Goldschmidt162"&gt;{{Harvnb|Goldschmidt|2008|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the speech, he denounced [[British Empire|British imperialism]] in Egypt and British control over the canal company's profits, and upheld that the Egyptian people had a right to sovereignty over the waterway, especially since "120,000 Egyptians had died ''(sic)''" building it.&lt;ref name="Goldschmidt162"/&gt; The motion was technically in breach of the international agreement he had signed with the UK on 19 October 1954,&lt;ref name="Jankowski68"&gt;{{Harvnb|Jankowski|2001|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he ensured that all existing stockholders would be paid off.&lt;ref name="BBC: 1956: Egypt Seizes Suez Canal"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/26/newsid_2701000/2701603.stm |title=1956: Egypt Seizes Suez Canal |work=[[BBC News]] |date=26 July 1956 |accessdate=4 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nationalization announcement was greeted very emotionally by the audience and, throughout the Arab world, thousands entered the streets shouting slogans of support.&lt;ref name="Aburish108"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; US ambassador [[Henry A. Byroade]] stated, "I cannot overemphasize [the] popularity of the Canal Company nationalization within Egypt, even among Nasser's enemies."&lt;ref name="Jankowski68"/&gt; Egyptian political scientist Mahmoud Hamad wrote that, prior to 1956, Nasser had consolidated control over Egypt's military and civilian bureaucracies, but it was only after the canal's nationalization that he gained near-total popular legitimacy and firmly established himself as the "charismatic leader" and "spokesman for the masses not only in Egypt, but all over the Third World".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hamad|2008|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aburish, this was Nasser's largest pan-Arab triumph at the time and "soon his pictures were to be found in the tents of Yemen, the souks of [[Marrakesh]], and the posh villas of Syria".&lt;ref name="Aburish108"/&gt; The official reason given for the nationalization was that funds from the canal would be used for the construction of the dam in Aswan.&lt;ref name="Jankowski68"/&gt; That same day, Egypt closed the canal to Israeli shipping.&lt;ref name="BBC: 1956: Egypt Seizes Suez Canal"/&gt;

===Suez Crisis===
{{Main|Suez Crisis}}
[[File:Suez nationalization.ogv|thumb|right|thumbtime=2:16|[[Movietone newsreel]]s reporting Nasser's nationalization of the Suez Canal and both domestic and Western reactions]]
France and the UK, the largest shareholders in the Suez Canal Company, saw its nationalization as yet another hostile measure aimed at them by the Egyptian government. Nasser was aware that the canal's nationalization would instigate an international crisis and believed the prospect of military intervention by the two countries was 80 percent likely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rogan|2011|p=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser dismissed their claims,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpfuYTSFlVo Nasser 1956 speech mocking the media and the British denunciation of him] (in Egyptian Arabic, Youtube)&lt;/ref&gt; and believed that the UK would not be able to intervene militarily for at least two months after the announcement, and dismissed Israeli action as "impossible".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Heikal|1973|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early October, the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] met on the matter of the canal's nationalization and adopted a resolution recognizing Egypt's right to control the canal as long as it continued to allow passage through it for foreign ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Heikal|1973|pp=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Heikal, after this agreement, "Nasser estimated that the danger of invasion had dropped to 10 percent".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Heikal|1973|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, however, the UK, France, and Israel made a [[Protocol of Sèvres|secret agreement]] to take over the Suez Canal, occupy the Suez Canal zone,&lt;ref name="Jankowski68"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Avi |last=Shlaim |authorlink=Avi Shlaim |url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~ssfc0005/The%20Protocol%20of%20Sevres%201956%20Anatomy%20of%20a%20War%20Plot.html |title=The Protocol of Sèvres,1956: Anatomy of a War Plot |work=[[International Affairs (journal)|International Affairs]] |volume=73:3 |year=1997 |pages=509–530 |accessdate=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and topple Nasser.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawisha|2009|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jankowski|2001|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kandil|2012|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 October 1956, Israeli forces crossed the [[Sinai Peninsula]], overwhelmed Egyptian army posts, and quickly advanced to their objectives. Two days later, British and French planes bombarded Egyptian airfields in the canal zone.&lt;ref name="Aburish119"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser ordered the military's high command to withdraw the Egyptian Army from Sinai to bolster the canal's defenses.&lt;ref name="Shemesh116"/&gt; Moreover, he feared that if the armored corps was dispatched to confront the Israeli invading force and the British and French subsequently landed in the canal city of [[Port Said]], Egyptian armor in the Sinai would be cut off from the canal and destroyed by the combined tripartite forces.&lt;ref name="Shemesh116"/&gt; Amer strongly disagreed, insisting that Egyptian tanks meet the Israelis in battle.&lt;ref name="Shemesh116"/&gt; The two had a heated exchange on 3 November, and Amer conceded.&lt;ref name="Shemesh116"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shemesh|Troen|1990|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser also ordered blockage of the canal by sinking or otherwise disabling forty-nine ships at its entrance.&lt;ref name="Aburish119"/&gt;

Despite the commanded withdrawal of Egyptian troops, about 2,000 Egyptian soldiers were killed during engagement with Israeli forces,&lt;ref name="Bidwell398"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bidwell|1998|p=398}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some 5,000 Egyptian soldiers were captured by the Israeli Army.&lt;ref name="Shemesh116"/&gt; Amer and [[Salah Salem]] proposed requesting a ceasefire, with Salem further recommending that Nasser surrender himself to British forces.&lt;ref name="Jankowski68"/&gt; Nasser berated Amer and Salem, and vowed, "Nobody is going to surrender."&lt;ref name="Aburish119"/&gt; Nasser assumed military command. Despite the relative ease in which Sinai was occupied, Nasser's prestige at home and among Arabs was undamaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dekmejian|1971|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; To counterbalance the Egyptian Army's dismal performance, Nasser authorized the distribution of about 400,000 rifles to civilian volunteers and hundreds of militias were formed throughout Egypt, many led by Nasser's political opponents.&lt;ref name="Alexander94"&gt;{{Harvnb|Alexander|2005|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was at Port Said that Nasser saw a confrontation with the invading forces as being the strategic and psychological focal point of Egypt's defense.&lt;ref name="Kyle445-446"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kyle|2011|pp=445–446}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third infantry battalion and hundreds of national guardsmen were sent to the city as reinforcements, while two regular companies were dispatched to organize popular resistance.&lt;ref name="Kyle445-446"/&gt; Nasser and Boghdadi traveled to the canal zone to boost the morale of the armed volunteers. According to Boghdadi's memoirs, Nasser described the Egyptian Army as "shattered" as he saw the wreckage of Egyptian military equipment en route.&lt;ref name="Kyle445-446"/&gt; When British and French forces landed in Port Said on 5–6 November, its local militia put up a stiff resistance, resulting in street-to-street fighting.&lt;ref name="Alexander94"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kyle13-4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kyle|2001|pp=113–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian Army commander in the city was preparing to request terms for a ceasefire, but Nasser ordered him to desist. The British-French forces managed to largely secure the city by 7 November.&lt;ref name="Kyle13-4"/&gt; Between 750 and 1,000 Egyptians were killed in the battle for Port Said.&lt;ref name="Bidwell398"/&gt;

The US [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower administration]] condemned the tripartite invasion, and supported UN resolutions demanding withdrawal and a [[United Nations Emergency Force]] (UNEF) to be stationed in Sinai.&lt;ref name="Yaqub51"&gt;{{Harvnb|Yaqub|2004|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser commended Eisenhower, stating he played the "greatest and most decisive role" in stopping the "tripartite conspiracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawisha|2009|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of December, British and French forces had totally withdrawn from Egyptian territory,&lt;ref name="Yaqub51"/&gt; while Israel completed its withdrawal in March 1957 and released all Egyptian [[prisoners of war]].&lt;ref name="Bidwell398"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Establishment of UNEF (United Nations Emergency Force)|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/past/unef1backgr2.html |publisher=United Nations|accessdate=29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the Suez Crisis, Nasser brought in a set of regulations imposing rigorous requirements for residency and citizenship as well as [[1956–57 exodus and expulsions from Egypt|forced expulsions]], mostly affecting British and French nationals and Jews with foreign nationality, as well as many [[Egyptian Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beinin|2005|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 25,000 Jews, almost half of the Jewish community, left in 1956, mainly for Israel, Europe, the United States and South America.&lt;ref name=JVL&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/jewref.html Jewish Refugees from Arab Countries].

After the fighting ended, Amer accused Nasser of provoking an unnecessary war and then blaming the military for the result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kandil|2012|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 April, the canal was reopened,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Nasser's political position was enormously enhanced by the widely perceived failure of the invasion and attempt to topple him. British diplomat [[Sir Anthony Nutting, 3rd Baronet|Anthony Nutting]] claimed the crisis "established Nasser finally and completely" as the ''rayyes'' (president) of Egypt.&lt;ref name="Jankowski68"/&gt;

By 1957, [[pan-Arabism]] had become the dominant ideology in the Arab world, and the average Arab citizen considered Nasser his undisputed leader.&lt;ref name="Dawisha184"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawisha|2009|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Adeed Dawisha credited Nasser's status to his "charisma, bolstered by his perceived victory in the Suez Crisis".&lt;ref name="Dawisha184"/&gt; The Cairo-based [[Voice of the Arabs]] radio station spread Nasser's ideas of united Arab action throughout the Arabic-speaking world, so much so that historian Eugene Rogan wrote, "Nasser conquered the Arab world by radio."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rogan|2011|p=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lebanese sympathizers of Nasser and the Egyptian embassy in [[Beirut]]—the press center of the Arab world—bought out Lebanese media outlets to further disseminate Nasser's ideals.&lt;ref name="Aburish 135-136" /&gt; Egypt also expanded its policy of secondment, dispatching thousands of high-skilled Egyptian professionals (usually politically-active teachers) across the region.&lt;ref name="Tsourapas2016a"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tsourapas|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser also enjoyed the support of Arab nationalist civilian and paramilitary organizations throughout the region. His followers were numerous and well-funded, but lacked any permanent structure and organization. They called themselves "[[Nasserite]]s", despite Nasser's objection to the label (he preferred the term "Arab nationalists").&lt;ref name="Aburish 135-136" /&gt;

In January 1957, the US adopted the [[Eisenhower Doctrine]] and pledged to prevent the spread of communism and its perceived agents in the Middle East.&lt;ref name="Aburish127"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Nasser was an opponent of communism in the region, his promotion of pan-Arabism was viewed as a threat by pro-Western states in the region.&lt;ref name="Aburish127"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yaqub102"&gt;{{Harvnb|Yaqub|2004|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenhower tried to isolate Nasser and reduce his regional influence by attempting to transform King Saud into a counterweight.&lt;ref name="Aburish127"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yaqub102"/&gt; Also in January, the elected Jordanian prime minister and Nasser supporter&lt;ref name="Dawisha155"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawisha|2009|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sulayman al-Nabulsi]] brought Jordan into a military pact with Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name="Dawisha181"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawisha|2009|pp=181–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations between Nasser and King Hussein deteriorated in April when Hussein implicated Nasser in two coup attempts against him&lt;ref name="Dawisha181"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawisha191"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawisha|2009|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;—although Nasser's involvement was never established&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dann|1989|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and dissolved al-Nabulsi's cabinet.&lt;ref name="Dawisha181"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawisha191"/&gt; Nasser subsequently slammed Hussein on Cairo radio as being "a tool of the imperialists".&lt;ref name="Aburish 130-131"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relations with King Saud also became antagonistic as the latter began to fear that Nasser's increasing popularity in Saudi Arabia was a genuine threat to the [[House of Saud|royal family]]'s survival.&lt;ref name="Dawisha181"/&gt; Despite opposition from the governments of Jordan, Saudi Arabia, [[Iraq]], and [[Lebanon]], Nasser maintained his prestige among their citizens and those of other Arab countries.&lt;ref name="Aburish 135-136"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=135–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1957, Nasser nationalized all remaining British and French assets in Egypt, including the tobacco, cement, pharmaceutical, and [[phosphate]] industries.&lt;ref name="Aburish138-9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=138–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; When efforts to offer tax incentives and attract outside investments yielded no tangible results, he nationalized more companies and made them a part of his economic development organization.&lt;ref name="Aburish138-9"/&gt; He stopped short of total government control: two-thirds of the economy was still in private hands.&lt;ref name="Aburish138-9"/&gt; This effort achieved a measure of success, with increased agricultural production and investment in industrialization.&lt;ref name="Aburish138-9"/&gt; Nasser initiated the Helwan steelworks, which subsequently became Egypt's largest enterprise, providing the country with product and tens of thousands of jobs.&lt;ref name="Aburish138-9"/&gt; Nasser also decided to cooperate with the Soviet Union in the construction of the Aswan Dam to replace the withdrawal of US funds.&lt;ref name="Aburish138-9"/&gt;

Despite his popularity with the people of the Arab world, by mid-1957 his only regional ally was Syria.&lt;ref name="Dawisha191-2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawisha|2009|pp=191–192}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, [[Turkish army|Turkish troops]] massed along the Syrian border, giving credence to rumors that the Baghdad Pact countries [[Syrian Crisis of 1957|were attempting to topple Syria's leftist government]].&lt;ref name="Dawisha191-2"/&gt; Nasser sent a contingent force to Syria as a symbolic display of solidarity, further elevating his prestige in the Arab world, and particularly among Syrians.&lt;ref name="Dawisha191-2"/&gt;

As political instability grew in Syria, delegations from the country were sent to Nasser demanding immediate unification with Egypt.&lt;ref name="Dawisha193"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawisha|2009|pp=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser initially turned down the request, citing the two countries' incompatible political and economic systems, lack of [[Geographic contiguity|contiguity]], the Syrian military's record of intervention in politics, and the deep factionalism among Syria's political forces.&lt;ref name="Dawisha193"/&gt; However, in January 1958, a second Syrian delegation managed to convince Nasser of an impending communist takeover and a consequent slide to civil strife.&lt;ref name="Dawisha198"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawisha|2009|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser subsequently opted for union, albeit on the condition that it would be a total political merger with him as its president, to which the delegates and Syrian president [[Shukri al-Quwatli]] agreed.&lt;ref name="Dawisha199"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawisha|2009|pp=199–200}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 February, the [[United Arab Republic]] (UAR) was proclaimed and, according to Dawisha, the Arab world reacted in "stunned amazement, which quickly turned into uncontrolled euphoria."&lt;ref name="Dawisha200"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawisha|2009|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser ordered a crackdown against Syrian communists, dismissing many of them from their governmental posts.&lt;ref name="Aburish151"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=150–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Podeh|1999|pp=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a surprise visit to Damascus to celebrate the union on 24 February, Nasser was welcomed by crowds in the hundreds of thousands.&lt;ref name="Dawisha202-3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawisha|2009|pp=202–203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crown Prince [[Imam Badr]] of North Yemen was dispatched to Damascus with proposals to include his country in the new republic. Nasser agreed to establish a loose federal union with Yemen—the [[United Arab States]]—in place of total integration.&lt;ref name="Aburish158"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Nasser was in Syria, King Saud planned to have him assassinated on his return flight to Cairo.&lt;ref name="Dawisha190"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawisha|2009|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 March, Nasser addressed the masses in Damascus and waved before them the Saudi check given to Syrian security chief and, unbeknownst to the Saudis, ardent Nasser supporter [[Abdel Hamid Sarraj]] to shoot down Nasser's plane.&lt;ref name="Aburish160-1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of Saud's plot, he was forced by senior members of the Saudi royal family to informally cede most of his powers to his brother, [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|King Faisal]], a major Nasser opponent who advocated [[pan-Islamism|pan-Islamic unity]] over pan-Arabism.&lt;ref name="Aburish161-2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=161–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A day after announcing the attempt on his life, Nasser established a new provisional constitution proclaiming a 600-member National Assembly (400 from Egypt and 200 from Syria) and the dissolution of all political parties.&lt;ref name="Aburish161-2"/&gt; Nasser gave each of the provinces two vice-presidents: Boghdadi and Amer in Egypt, and [[Sabri al-Asali]] and [[Akram al-Hawrani]] in Syria.&lt;ref name="Aburish161-2"/&gt; Nasser then left for Moscow to meet with [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. At the meeting, Khrushchev pressed Nasser to lift the ban on the Communist Party, but Nasser refused, stating it was an internal matter which was not a subject of discussion with outside powers. Khrushchev was reportedly taken aback and denied he had meant to interfere in the UAR's affairs. The matter was settled as both leaders sought to prevent a rift between their two countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasser felt that the [[14 July Revolution|revolution in Iraq]] left the road for pan-Arab unity unblocked.&lt;ref name="Aburish169-170"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=169–170}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 July, for the first time, he declared that he was opting for full Arab union, although he had no plan to merge Iraq with the UAR.&lt;ref name="Aburish 174-175"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=174–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most members of the [[Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council]] (RCC) favored Iraqi-UAR unity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qasim sought to keep Iraq independent and resented Nasser's large popular base in the country.&lt;ref name="Dawisha209"/&gt;

In the fall of 1958, Nasser formed a tripartite committee consisting of Zakaria Mohieddin, al-Hawrani, and [[Salah al-Din Bitar|Salah Bitar]] to oversee developments in Syria.&lt;ref name="Aburish176-78"/&gt; By moving the latter two, who were Ba'athists, to Cairo, he neutralized important political figures who had their own ideas about how Syria should be run.&lt;ref name="Aburish176-78"/&gt; He put Syria under Sarraj, who effectively reduced the province to a [[police state]] by imprisoning and exiling landholders who objected to the introduction of Egyptian agricultural reform in Syria, as well as communists.&lt;ref name="Aburish176-78"/&gt; Following the Lebanese election of [[Fuad Chehab]] in September 1958, relations between Lebanon and the UAR improved considerably.&lt;ref name="Salam102"&gt;{{Harvnb|Salam|2004|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 March 1959, Chehab and Nasser met at the Lebanese–Syrian border and compromised on an end to the Lebanese crisis.&lt;ref name="Salam102"/&gt;

[[File:Nasser addressing Damascus, 1960.jpg|thumb|right|alt=The back of a man waving to the throng below|Nasser waving to crowds in [[Damascus]], Syria, October 1960]]

Relations between Nasser and Qasim grew increasingly bitter on 9 March,&lt;ref name="Aburish181-83"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=181–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; after Qasim's forces suppressed a [[1959 Mosul uprising|rebellion]] in [[Mosul]], launched a day earlier by a [[Abd al-Wahab al-Shawaf|pro-Nasser Iraqi RCC officer]] backed by UAR authorities.&lt;ref name="Dawisha216"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawisha|2009|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser had considered dispatching troops to aid his Iraqi sympathizers, but decided against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=179–180}}&lt;/ref&gt; He clamped down on Egyptian communist activity due to the key backing Iraqi communists provided Qasim. Several influential communists were arrested, including Nasser's old comrade Khaled Mohieddin, who had been allowed to re-enter Egypt in 1956.&lt;ref name="Aburish181-83"/&gt;

By December, the political situation in Syria was faltering and Nasser responded by appointing Amer as governor-general alongside Sarraj. Syria's leaders opposed the appointment and many resigned from their government posts. Nasser later met with the opposition leaders and in a heated moment, exclaimed that he was the "elected" president of the UAR and those who did not accept his authority could "walk away".&lt;ref name="Aburish176-78"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=176–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collapse of the union and aftermath===
Opposition to the union mounted among some of Syria's key elements,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawisha|2009|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; namely the [[socioeconomic]], political, and military elites.&lt;ref name="Dawisha231"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawisha|2009|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Syria's worsening economy, which Nasser attributed to its control by the [[bourgeoisie]], in July 1961, Nasser decreed socialist measures that nationalized wide-ranging sectors of the Syrian economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawisha|2009|p=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also dismissed Sarraj in September to curb the growing political crisis. Aburish states that Nasser was not fully capable of addressing Syrian problems because they were "foreign to him".&lt;ref name="Aburish189-191"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=189–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Egypt, the economic situation was more positive, with a GNP growth of 4.5 percent and a rapid growth of industry.&lt;ref name="Aburish189-191"/&gt; In 1960, Nasser nationalized the Egyptian press, which had already been cooperating with his government, in order to steer coverage towards the country's socioeconomic issues and galvanize public support for his socialist measures.&lt;ref name="AtiyehOweiss331–2"/&gt;

On 28 September 1961, secessionist army units launched a coup in Damascus, declaring Syria's secession from the UAR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawisha|2009|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, pro-union army units in northern Syria revolted and pro-Nasser protests occurred in major Syrian cities.&lt;ref name="Dawisha231"/&gt; Nasser sent Egyptian special forces to [[Latakia]] to bolster his allies, but withdrew them two days later, citing a refusal to allow inter-Arab fighting.&lt;ref name="Aburish204-5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=204–205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Addressing the UAR's breakup on 5 October,&lt;ref name="Podeh157"&gt;{{Harvnb|Podeh|2004|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser accepted personal responsibility&lt;ref name="Aburish204-5"/&gt; and declared that Egypt would recognize an elected Syrian government.&lt;ref name="Podeh157"/&gt; He privately blamed interference by hostile Arab governments.&lt;ref name="Aburish204-5"/&gt; According to Heikal, Nasser suffered something resembling a nervous breakdown after the dissolution of the union; he began to smoke more heavily and his health began to deteriorate.&lt;ref name="Aburish204-5"/&gt;

===Revival on regional stage===

Ben Bella and Aref were close allies of Nasser.]]

Nasser's regional position changed unexpectedly when Yemeni officers led by Nasser supporter [[Abdullah al-Sallal]] overthrew Imam Badr of North Yemen on 27 September 1962.&lt;ref name="Aburish207"/&gt; Al-Badr and his tribal partisans began receiving increasing support from Saudi Arabia to help reinstate the kingdom, while Nasser subsequently accepted a request by Sallal to militarily aid the new government on 30 September.&lt;ref name="Dawisha235"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawisha|2009|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Egypt became increasingly embroiled in the drawn-out [[North Yemen Civil War|civil war]] until it withdrew its forces in 1967.&lt;ref name="Dawisha235"/&gt; Most of Nasser's old colleagues had questioned the wisdom of continuing the war, but Amer reassured Nasser of their coming victory.&lt;ref name="Aburish209"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=209–211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser later remarked in 1968 that intervention in Yemen was a "miscalculation".&lt;ref name="Dawisha235"/&gt;

In July 1962, Algeria became [[Algerian independence war|independent]] of France.&lt;ref name="Aburish209"/&gt; As a staunch political and financial supporter of the Algerian independence movement, Nasser considered the country's independence to be a personal victory.&lt;ref name="Aburish209"/&gt; Amid these developments, a [[Free Princes|pro-Nasser clique]] in the Saudi royal family led by Prince [[Talal ibn Abd al-Aziz|Talal]] defected to Egypt, along with the Jordanian chief of staff, in early 1963.&lt;ref name="Dawisha237"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawisha|2009|p=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nasser and Sallal in Sanaa.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Several men in different clothing standing before a crowd of people.|Nasser before Yemeni crowds on his arrival to [[Sana'a]], April 1964. In front of Nasser and giving a salute is Yemeni President [[Abdullah al-Sallal]] ]]

On 8 February 1963, a [[Ramadan Revolution|military coup]] in Iraq led by a Ba'athist–Nasserist alliance toppled Qasim, who was subsequently shot dead. [[Abdul Salam Arif|Abdel Salam Aref]], a Nasserist, was chosen to be the new president.&lt;ref name="Aburish209"/&gt; A similar alliance [[1963 Syrian coup d'état|toppled]] the Syrian government on 8 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seale|1990|pp=76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 March, the new Iraqi and Syrian governments sent Nasser delegations to push for a new Arab union.&lt;ref name="Aburish 215-217"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=215–217}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the meeting, Nasser lambasted the Ba'athists for "facilitating" Syria's split from the UAR,&lt;ref name="Dawisha239"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawisha|2009|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; and asserted that he was the "leader of the Arabs".&lt;ref name="Aburish 215-217"/&gt; A transitional unity agreement stipulating a federal system&lt;ref name="Aburish 215-217"/&gt; was signed by the parties on 17 April and the new union was set to be established in May 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seale|1990|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the agreement fell apart weeks later when Syria's Ba'athists [[1963 Syrian coup d'état#Purges and failed coup of 18 July|purged]] Nasser's supporters from the officers corps. A failed counter-coup by a [[Jassem Alwan|Nasserist colonel]] followed, after which Nasser condemned the Ba'athists as "fascists".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seale|1990|pp=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1964, Nasser called for an [[1964 Arab League summit (Cairo)|Arab League summit]] in Cairo to establish a unified Arab response against Israel's plans to divert the [[Jordan River]]'s waters for economic purposes, which Syria and Jordan deemed an act of war.&lt;ref name="Dawisha243"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawisha|2009|pp=243–244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser blamed Arab divisions for what he deemed "the disastrous situation".&lt;ref name="Aburish 222-223"/&gt; He discouraged Syria and Palestinian guerrillas from provoking the Israelis, conceding that he had no plans for war with Israel.&lt;ref name="Aburish 222-223"/&gt; During the summit, Nasser developed cordial relations with King Hussein, and ties were mended with the rulers of Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Morocco.&lt;ref name="Dawisha243"/&gt; In May, Nasser moved to formally share his leadership position over the Palestine issue&lt;ref name="Aburish 222-223"/&gt; by initiating the creation of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO).&lt;ref name="Aburish 222-223"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cubert52"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cubert|1997|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, Nasser used the PLO to wield control over the Palestinian fedayeen.&lt;ref name="Cubert52"/&gt; Its head was to be [[Ahmad Shukeiri]], Nasser's personal nominee.&lt;ref name="Aburish 222-223"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=222–223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After years of foreign policy coordination and developing ties, Nasser, President [[Sukarno]] of [[Indonesia]], President [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]] of [[Yugoslavia]], and Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] of [[India]] founded the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] (NAM) in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mehrotra|1990|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its declared purpose was to solidify international non-alignment and promote world peace amid the Cold War, end colonization, and increase economic cooperation among developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mehrotra|1990|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, Nasser was made president of the NAM and held the second conference of the organization in Cairo.&lt;ref name="Aburish234"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasser played a significant part in the strengthening of African solidarity in the late 1950s and early 1960s, although his continental leadership role had increasingly passed to Algeria since 1962.&lt;ref name="AdiSherwood140-1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Adi|Sherwood|2003|pp=140–141}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Nasser made Egypt a refuge for anti-colonial leaders from several African countries and allowed the broadcast of anti-colonial propaganda from Cairo.&lt;ref name="AdiSherwood140-1"/&gt; Beginning in 1958, Nasser had a key role in the discussions among African leaders that led to the establishment of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU) in 1963.&lt;ref name="AdiSherwood140-1"/&gt;

==Modernization efforts and internal dissent==

===Al-Azhar===
In 1961, Nasser sought to firmly establish Egypt as the leader of the Arab world and to promote a second revolution in Egypt with the purpose of merging Islamic and socialist thinking.&lt;ref name="Aburish201"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=200–201}}&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve this, he initiated several reforms to modernize [[al-Azhar University|al-Azhar]], which serves as the ''de facto'' leading authority in [[Sunni Islam]], and to ensure its prominence over the Muslim Brotherhood and the more conservative [[Wahhabism]] promoted by Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name="Aburish201"/&gt; Nasser had used al-Azhar's most willing ''[[ulema]]'' (scholars) as a counterweight to the Brotherhood's Islamic influence, starting in 1953.&lt;ref name="Aburish46-7"/&gt;

Nasser instructed al-Azhar to create changes in its syllabus that trickled to the lower levels of Egyptian education, consequently allowing the establishment of coeducational schools and the introduction of [[evolution]] into school [[curriculum]]. The reforms also included the merger of [[sharia|religious]] and civil courts.&lt;ref name="Aburish201"/&gt; Moreover, Nasser forced al-Azhar to issue a [[fatwā]] admitting [[Shia Muslim]]s, [[Alawite]]s, and [[Druze]] into mainstream Islam; for centuries prior, al-Azhar deemed them to be "heretics".&lt;ref name="Aburish201"/&gt;

===Rivalry with Amer===
Following Syria's secession, Nasser grew concerned with Amer's inability to train and modernize the army, and with the [[state within a state]] Amer had created in the military command and [[Egyptian General Intelligence Directorate|intelligence apparatus]].&lt;ref name="Aburish237"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kandil|2012|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1961, Nasser established the Presidential Council and decreed it the authority to approve all senior military appointments, instead of leaving this responsibility solely to Amer.&lt;ref name="Farid71"&gt;{{Harvnb|Farid|1996|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brooks88"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|2008|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he instructed that the primary criterion for promotion should be merit and not personal loyalties.&lt;ref name="Farid71"/&gt; Nasser retracted the initiative after Amer's allies in the officers corps threatened to mobilize against him.&lt;ref name="Brooks88"/&gt;

In early 1962 Nasser again attempted to wrest control of the military command from Amer.&lt;ref name="Brooks88"/&gt; Amer responded by directly confronting Nasser for the first time and secretly rallying his loyalist officers.&lt;ref name="Farid71"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brooks89"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|2008|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser ultimately backed down, wary of a possible violent confrontation between the military and his civilian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farid|1996|pp=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Boghdadi, the stress caused by the UAR's collapse and Amer's increasing autonomy forced Nasser, who already had [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], to practically live on painkillers from then on.&lt;ref name="Aburish244"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Charter and second term===

In October 1961, Nasser embarked on a major nationalization program for Egypt, believing the total adoption of socialism was the answer to his country's problems and would have prevented Syria's secession.&lt;ref name="Aburish205"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=205–206}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to organize and solidify his popular base with Egypt's citizens and counter the army's influence, Nasser introduced the National Charter in 1962 and a [[Egyptian Constitution of 1963|new constitution]].&lt;ref name="Aburish237"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=235–237}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charter called for [[universal health care]], [[affordable housing]], [[vocational schools]], greater women's rights and a family planning program, as well as widening the Suez Canal.&lt;ref name="Aburish237"/&gt;

Nasser also attempted to maintain oversight of the country's civil service to prevent it from inflating and consequently becoming a burden to the state.&lt;ref name="Aburish237"/&gt; New laws provided workers with a minimum wage, profit shares, free education, free health care, reduced working hours, and encouragement to participate in management. Land reforms guaranteed the security of tenant farmers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stork|2001|pp=235–236}}&lt;/ref&gt; promoted agricultural growth, and reduced rural poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akram-Lodhi|Borras|Kay|2007|pp=258–259}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the 1962 measures, government ownership of Egyptian business reached 51&amp;nbsp;percent,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Abdelmalek|1968|pp=363–365}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the National Union was renamed the [[Arab Socialist Union (Egypt)|Arab Socialist Union]] (ASU).&lt;ref name="Aburish205"/&gt; With these measures came more domestic repression, as thousands of [[Islamist]]s were imprisoned, including dozens of military officers.&lt;ref name="Aburish205"/&gt; Nasser's tilt toward a Soviet-style system led his aides Boghdadi and [[Hussein el-Shafei]] to submit their resignations in protest.&lt;ref name="Aburish207"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=207–208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the presidential referendum in Egypt, Nasser was [[United Arab Republic presidential confirmation referendum, 1965|re-elected]] to a second term as UAR president and took his oath on 25 March 1965. He was the only candidate for the position, with virtually all of his political opponents forbidden by law from running for office, and his fellow party members reduced to mere followers. That same year, Nasser had the Muslim Brotherhood chief ideologue Sayyed Qutb imprisoned.&lt;ref name="Aburish239"/&gt; Qutb was charged and found guilty by the court of plotting to assassinate Nasser, and was executed in 1966.&lt;ref name="Aburish239"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=238–239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1966, as Egypt's economy slowed and government debt became increasingly burdensome, Nasser began to ease state control over the private sector, encouraging state-owned bank loans to private business and introducing incentives to increase exports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cook|2011|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 60's, the Egyptian economy went from sluggishness to the verge of collapse, the society became less free, and Nasser's appeal waned considerably.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ferris|2013|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Six-Day War==

In mid May 1967, the Soviet Union issued warnings to Nasser of an impending Israeli attack on Syria, although Chief of Staff [[Mohamed Fawzi (general)|Mohamed Fawzi]] considered the warnings to be "baseless".&lt;ref name="Aburish252"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kandil76"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kandil|2012|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kandil, without Nasser's authorization, Amer used the Soviet warnings as a pretext to dispatch troops to Sinai on 14 May, and Nasser subsequently demanded UNEF's withdrawal.&lt;ref name="Kandil76"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brooks90"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|2008|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier that day, Nasser received a warning from King Hussein of Israeli-American collusion to drag Egypt into war.&lt;ref name="Kandil77"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kandil|2012|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The message had been originally received by Amer on 2 May, but was withheld from Nasser until the Sinai deployment on 14 May.&lt;ref name="Kandil77"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parker|1996|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although in the preceding months, Hussein and Nasser had been accusing each other of avoiding a fight with Israel,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parker|1996|pp=158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hussein was nonetheless wary that an Egyptian-Israeli war would risk the West Bank's occupation by Israel.&lt;ref name="Kandil77"/&gt; Nasser still felt that the US would restrain Israel from attacking due to assurances that he received from the US and Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Aburish254-5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=254–255}}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, he also reassured both powers that Egypt would only act defensively.&lt;ref name="Aburish254-5"/&gt;

On 21 May, Amer asked Nasser to order the Straits of Tiran blockaded, a move Nasser believed Israel would use as a ''[[casus belli]]''.&lt;ref name="Kandil77"/&gt; Amer reassured him that the army was prepared for confrontation,&lt;ref name="Brooks95"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|2008|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kandil77-8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kandil|2012|pp=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Nasser doubted Amer's assessment of the military's readiness.&lt;ref name="Brooks95"/&gt; According to Nasser's vice president Zakaria Mohieddin, although "Amer had absolute authority over the armed forces, Nasser had his ways of knowing what was really going on".&lt;ref name="Parker1993p79"/&gt; Moreover, Amer anticipated an impending Israeli attack and advocated a preemptive strike.&lt;ref name="Aburish255"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kandil86"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kandil|2012|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser refused the call&lt;ref name="Kandil86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aburish257"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=257}}&lt;/ref&gt; upon determination that the air force lacked pilots and Amer's handpicked officers were incompetent.&lt;ref name="Aburish257"/&gt; Still, Nasser concluded that if Israel attacked, Egypt's quantitative advantage in manpower and arms could stave off Israeli forces for at least two weeks, allowing for diplomacy towards a ceasefire.&lt;ref name="Brooks97"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|2008|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of May, Nasser increasingly exchanged his positions of deterrence for deference to the inevitability of war,&lt;ref name="Brooks97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aburish258"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; under increased pressure to act by both the general Arab populace and various Arab governments.&lt;ref name="Aburish252"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aburish254"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=252–254}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 May Nasser declared, "our basic objective will be to destroy Israel".&lt;ref name="Mutawi2002p95"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mutawi|2002|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 May, King Hussein committed Jordan in an [[United Arab Command|alliance]] with Egypt and Syria.&lt;ref name="Aburish256"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of 5 June, the [[Israeli Air Force]] struck Egyptian air fields, destroying much of the Egyptian Air Force. Before the day ended, Israeli armored units had cut through Egyptian defense lines and captured the town of [[el-Arish]].&lt;ref name="Aburish261"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=260–261}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Amer ordered the immediate withdrawal of Egyptian troops from Sinai—causing the majority of Egyptian casualties during the war.&lt;ref name="Kandil82"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kandil|2012|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel quickly captured Sinai and the [[Gaza Strip]] from Egypt, the [[West Bank]] from Jordan, and the [[Golan Heights]] from Syria.

According to Sadat, it was only when the Israelis cut off the Egyptian garrison at [[Sharm el-Sheikh]] that Nasser became aware of the situation's gravity.&lt;ref name="Aburish261"/&gt; After hearing of the attack, he rushed to army headquarters to inquire about the military situation.&lt;ref name="Aburish263"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; The simmering conflict between Nasser and Amer subsequently came to the fore, and officers present reported the pair burst into "a nonstop shouting match".&lt;ref name="Aburish263"/&gt; The Supreme Executive Committee, set up by Nasser to oversee the conduct of the war, attributed the repeated Egyptian defeats to the Nasser–Amer rivalry and Amer's overall incompetence.&lt;ref name="Aburish261"/&gt; According to Egyptian diplomat [[Ismail Fahmi]], who became foreign minister during Sadat's presidency, the Israeli invasion and Egypt's consequent defeat was a result of Nasser's dismissal of all rational analysis of the situation and his undertaking of a series of irrational decisions.&lt;ref name="Fahmy19"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fahmy|2013|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first four days of the war, the general population of the Arab world believed Arab radio station fabrications of imminent Arab victory.&lt;ref name="Aburish262"/&gt; On 9 June, Nasser appeared on television to inform Egypt's citizens of their country's defeat.&lt;ref name="Aburish262"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bidwell276"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bidwell|1998|p=276}}&lt;/ref&gt; He announced his resignation on television later that day, and ceded all presidential powers to his then-Vice President Zakaria Mohieddin, who had no prior information of this decision and refused to accept the post.&lt;ref name="Bidwell276"/&gt; Hundreds of thousands of sympathizers poured into the streets in mass demonstrations throughout Egypt and across the Arab world rejecting his resignation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kandil|2012|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; chanting, "We are your soldiers, Gamal!"&lt;ref name="Aburish268"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=268–269}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser retracted his decision the next day.&lt;ref name="Aburish268"/&gt;

On 11 July, Nasser replaced Amer with Mohamed Fawzi as general commander,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kandil|2012|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nutting|1972|p=430}}&lt;/ref&gt; over the protestations of Amer's loyalists in the military, 600 of whom marched on army headquarters and demanded Amer's reinstatement.&lt;ref name="Kandil87"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kandil|2012|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Nasser sacked thirty of the loyalists in response,&lt;ref name="Kandil87"/&gt; Amer and his allies devised a plan to topple him on 27 August.&lt;ref name="Kandil88"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kandil|2012|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser was tipped off about their activities and, after several invitations, he convinced Amer to meet him at his home on 24 August.&lt;ref name="Kandil88"/&gt; Nasser confronted Amer about the coup plot, which he denied before being arrested by Mohieddin. Amer committed suicide on 14 September.&lt;ref name="Kandil89"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kandil|2012|pp=89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his souring relationship with Amer, Nasser spoke of losing "the person closest to [him]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, Nasser began a process of depoliticizing the armed forces, arresting dozens of leading military and intelligence figures loyal to Amer.&lt;ref name="Kandil89"/&gt;

At the 29 August [[1967 Arab League summit|Arab League summit]] in Khartoum, Nasser's usual commanding position had receded as the attending heads of state expected Saudi King Faisal to lead. A ceasefire in the Yemen War was declared and the summit concluded with the [[Khartoum Resolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=270–271}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union soon resupplied the Egyptian military with about half of its former arsenals and broke diplomatic relations with Israel. Nasser cut relations with the US following the war, and, according to Aburish, his policy of "playing the superpowers against each other" ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, Nasser accepted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242|UN Resolution 242]], which called for Israel's withdrawal from territories acquired in the war. His supporters claimed Nasser's move was meant to buy time to prepare for another confrontation with Israel, while his detractors believed his acceptance of the resolution signaled a waning interest in Palestinian independence.&lt;ref name="Aburish281"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic reforms and governmental changes===
Nasser appointed himself the additional roles of prime minister and supreme commander of the armed forces on 19 June 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=276}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angry at the military court's perceived leniency with air force officers charged with negligence during the 1967 war, workers and students launched protests calling for major political reforms in late February 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brownlee|2007|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Farid97"&gt;{{Harvnb|Farid|1996|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser responded to the demonstrations, the most significant public challenge to his rule since workers' protests in March 1954, by removing most military figures from his cabinet and appointing eight civilians in place of several high-ranking members of the Arab Socialist Union (ASU).&lt;ref name="Brownlee89"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brownlee|2007|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kandil92"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kandil|2012|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 3 March, Nasser directed Egypt's intelligence apparatus to focus on external rather than domestic espionage, and declared the "fall of the [[Egyptian General Intelligence Directorate|mukhabarat]] state".&lt;ref name="Kandil92"/&gt;

On 30 March, Nasser proclaimed a manifesto stipulating the restoration of civil liberties, greater parliamentary independence from the executive,&lt;ref name="Farid97"/&gt; major structural changes to the ASU, and a campaign to rid the government of corrupt elements.&lt;ref name="Brownlee89"/&gt; A public referendum approved the proposed measures in May, and held subsequent elections for the Supreme Executive Committee, the ASU's highest decision-making body.&lt;ref name="Farid97"/&gt; Observers noted that the declaration signaled an important shift from [[political repression]] to liberalization, although its promises would largely go unfulfilled.&lt;ref name="Brownlee89"/&gt;

Nasser appointed Sadat and Hussein el-Shafei as his vice presidents in December 1969. By then, relations with his other original military comrades, namely Khaled and Zakaria Mohieddin and former vice president Sabri, had become strained.&lt;ref name="Aburish299"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=299–301}}&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-1970, Nasser pondered replacing Sadat with Boghdadi after reconciling with the latter.&lt;ref name="Aburish304"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in January 1968, Nasser commenced the [[War of Attrition]] to reclaim territory captured by Israel, ordering attacks against Israeli positions east of the then-blockaded Suez Canal.&lt;ref name="Aburish280"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March, Nasser offered [[Yasser Arafat]]'s [[Fatah]] movement arms and funds after their performance against Israeli forces in the [[Battle of Karameh]] that month.&lt;ref name="Aburish288"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=288–290}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also advised Arafat to think of peace with Israel and the establishment of a [[Palestinian state]] comprising the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.&lt;ref name="Aburish288"/&gt; Nasser effectively ceded his leadership of the "Palestine issue" to Arafat.&lt;ref name="Aburish281"/&gt;

Israel retaliated against Egyptian shelling with commando raids, artillery shelling and air strikes. This resulted in an exodus of civilians from Egyptian cities along the Suez Canal's western bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Byman|Waxman|2002|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rasler|Thompson|Ganguly|2013|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aburish297-8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=297–298}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser ceased all military activities and began a program to build a network of internal defenses, while receiving the financial backing of various Arab states.&lt;ref name="Aburish297-8"/&gt; The war resumed in March 1969.&lt;ref name="Aburish297-8"/&gt; In November, Nasser brokered an [[Cairo Agreement (1969)|agreement]] between the PLO and the [[Lebanese Armed Forces|Lebanese military]] that granted Palestinian guerrillas the right to use Lebanese territory to attack Israel.&lt;ref name="Aburish301"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1970, Nasser accepted the US-sponsored [[Rogers Plan]], which called for an end to hostilities and an Israeli withdrawal from Egyptian territory, but it was rejected by Israel, the PLO, and most Arab states except Jordan.&lt;ref name="Aburish304"/&gt; Nasser had initially rejected the plan, but conceded under pressure from the Soviet Union, which feared that escalating regional conflict could drag it into a war with the US.&lt;ref name="Aburish305"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Viorst133"&gt;{{Harvnb|Viorst|1987|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also determined that a ceasefire could serve as a tactical step toward the strategic goal of recapturing the Suez Canal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farid|1996|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser forestalled any movement toward direct negotiations with Israel. In dozens of speeches and statements, Nasser posited the equation that any direct peace talks with [[Israel]] were tantamount to surrender.&lt;ref name="RabinovichShakedp192"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Itamar Rabinovich|author2=Haim Shaked|title=From June to October: The Middle East Between 1967 And 1973|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vNQ3K5HfiHAC&amp;pg=PA192|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-2418-7|page=192|quote=In dozens of speeches and statements, Nasser posited the equation that any direct peace talks with Israel were tantamount to surrender.

Following Nasser's acceptance, Israel agreed to a ceasefire and Nasser used the lull in fighting to move [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM missiles]] towards the canal zone.&lt;ref name="Aburish305"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Viorst133"/&gt;

Meanwhile, tensions in Jordan between an increasingly autonomous PLO and King Hussein's government had been simmering;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawisha|2009|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the [[Dawson's Field hijackings]], a [[Black September in Jordan|military campaign]] was launched to rout out PLO forces. The offensive elevated risks of a regional war and prompted Nasser to hold an emergency [[1970 Arab League summit|Arab League summit]] on 27 September in Cairo,&lt;ref name="Aburish309-10"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=309–310}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he forged a ceasefire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawisha|2009|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and funeral==

As the summit closed on 28 September 1970, hours after escorting the [[Sabah III Al-Salim Al-Sabah|last Arab leader to leave]], Nasser suffered a heart attack. He was immediately transported to his house, where his physicians tended to him. Nasser died several hours later, around 6&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name="Nutting476"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nutting|1972|p=476}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heikal, Sadat, and Nasser's wife Tahia were at his deathbed.&lt;ref name="Aburish310"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his doctor, al-Sawi Habibi, Nasser's likely cause of death was [[arteriosclerosis]], [[varicose veins]], and complications from long-standing [[diabetes]]. Nasser was a [[Chain smoking|heavy smoker]] with a family history of heart disease—two of his brothers died in their fifties from the same condition.&lt;ref name="Daigle115"/&gt; The state of Nasser's health was not known to the public prior to his death.&lt;ref name="Daigle115"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Al-Arabiya"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2010/09/26/120379.html |title=Claims that Sadat killed Nasser are unfounded |date=26 September 2010 |work=[[Al Arabiya]] |accessdate=27 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had previously suffered heart attacks in 1966 and September 1969.

Following the announcement of Nasser's death, Egypt and the Arab world were in a state of shock.&lt;ref name="Aburish310"/&gt; Nasser's funeral procession through Cairo on 1 October was attended by at least five million mourners.&lt;ref name="Aburish315"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=315–316}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TIME"/&gt; The {{convert|10|km|mi|adj=on|sp=us}} procession to his burial site began at the old RCC headquarters with a flyover by [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21]] jets. His flag-draped coffin was attached to a [[Limbers and caissons|gun carriage]] pulled by six horses and led by a column of cavalrymen.&lt;ref name="TIME"/&gt; All Arab heads of state attended, with the exception of Saudi King Faisal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Weston|2008|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; King Hussein and Arafat cried openly, and [[Muammar Gaddafi]] of [[Libyan Arab Republic|Libya]] fainted from emotional distress twice.&lt;ref name="Aburish315"/&gt; A few major non-Arab [[dignitary|dignitaries]] were present, including Soviet Premier [[Alexei Kosygin]] and French Prime Minister [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]].&lt;ref name="Aburish315"/&gt;

[[File:Gamal Abdel Nasser Mosque1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gamal Abdel Nasser Mosque]] in Cairo, the site of his burial|alt=The front side of a mosque with only one minaret containing a clock.]]

Almost immediately after the procession began, mourners engulfed Nasser's coffin chanting, "There is no God but [[Allah]], and Nasser is God's beloved… Each of us is Nasser."&lt;ref name="TIME"/&gt; Police unsuccessfully attempted to quell the crowds and, as a result, most of the foreign dignitaries were evacuated.&lt;ref name="TIME"/&gt; The final destination was the Nasr Mosque, which was afterwards renamed Abdel Nasser Mosque, where Nasser was buried.&lt;ref name="TIME"/&gt;

Because of his ability to motivate nationalistic passions, "men, women, and children wept and wailed in the streets" after hearing of his death, according to Nutting.&lt;ref name="Nutting476"/&gt; The general Arab reaction was one of mourning, with thousands of people pouring onto the streets of major cities throughout the Arab world.&lt;ref name="TIME"/&gt; Over a dozen people were killed in Beirut as a result of the chaos, and in [[Jerusalem]], roughly 75,000&amp;nbsp;Arabs marched through the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] chanting, "Nasser will never die."&lt;ref name="TIME"/&gt; As a testament to his unchallenged leadership of the Arab people, following his death, the headline of the Lebanese ''[[L'Orient-Le Jour|Le Jour]]'' read, "One hundred million human beings—the Arabs—are orphans."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Nasser's Legacy: Hope and Instability |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=12 October 1970 |page=20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sherif Hetata]], a former political prisoner&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Botman|1988|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later member Nasser's ASU,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nelson|2000|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; said that "Nasser's greatest achievement was his funeral.

Nasser made Egypt fully independent of [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|British influence]],&lt;ref name="Cook111"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cook|2011|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reich379"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reich|1990|p=379}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the country became a major power in the [[developing world]] under his leadership.&lt;ref name="Cook111"/&gt; One of Nasser's main domestic efforts was to establish [[social justice]], which he deemed a prerequisite to [[liberal democracy]].&lt;ref name="Darling192"&gt;{{Harvnb|Darling|2013|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his presidency, ordinary citizens enjoyed unprecedented access to housing, education, jobs, health services and nourishment, as well as other forms of [[social welfare]], while [[feudalistic]] influence waned.&lt;ref name="Cook111"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ahram"/&gt; By the end of his presidency, employment and working conditions improved considerably, although poverty was still high in the country and substantial resources allocated for social welfare had been diverted to the war effort.&lt;ref name="Darling192"/&gt;

The national economy grew significantly through [[agrarian reform]], major modernization projects such as the Helwan steel works and the Aswan Dam, and nationalization schemes such as that of the Suez Canal.&lt;ref name="Cook111"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ahram"/&gt; However, the marked economic growth of the early 1960s took a downturn for the remainder of the decade, only recovering in 1970.&lt;ref name="Cook112"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cook|2011|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt experienced a "golden age" of culture during Nasser's presidency, according to historian Joel Gordon, particularly in film, television, theater, radio, literature, [[fine art]]s, comedy, poetry, and music.&lt;ref name="Gordon171"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gordon|2000|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt under Nasser dominated the Arab world in these fields,&lt;ref name="Ahram"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gordon171"/&gt; producing cultural icons.&lt;ref name="Ahram"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The interplay in the Nasser 'phenomenon' between genuine expression of popular feeling and state-sponsored propaganda may sometimes be hard to disentangle. But behind it lies a vital historical fact: that Gamal Abdel Nasser signifies the only truly Egyptian developmental project in the country's history since the fall of the Pharaonic state. There had been other projects ... But this was different—in origin, meaning and impact. For Nasser was a man of the Egyptian soil who had overthrown the Middle East's most established and sophisticated monarchy in a swift and bloodless move—to the acclaim of millions of poor, oppressed Egyptians—and ushered in a programme of 'social justice', 'progress and development', and 'dignity'.&lt;ref name="Osman 42"&gt;{{Harvnb|Osman|2011|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While Nasser was increasingly criticized by Egyptian intellectuals following the Six-Day War and his death in 1970, the general public was persistently sympathetic both during and after Nasser's life.&lt;ref name="Podeh67-8"/&gt; According to political scientist Mahmoud Hamad, writing in 2008, "nostalgia for Nasser is easily sensed in Egypt and all Arab countries today".&lt;ref name="Hamad100"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hamad|2008|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; General malaise in Egyptian society, particularly during the [[History of Egypt under Hosni Mubarak|Mubarak era]], augmented nostalgia for Nasser's presidency, which increasingly became associated with the ideals of national purpose, hope, social cohesion, and vibrant culture.&lt;ref name="Gordon171"/&gt;

Historian [[Steven A.

===Criticism===
[[File:Nasser and Sadat in National Assembly.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Two men in suits seated next to each other with their arms resting on a table|[[Anwar Sadat]] (left) and Nasser in the National Assembly, 1964. Sadat succeeded Nasser as president in 1970 and significantly departed from Nasser's policies throughout his rule.]]

Sadat declared his intention to "continue the path of Nasser" in his 7 October 1970 presidential inauguration speech,&lt;ref name="Cooper67"/&gt; but began to depart from Nasserist policies as his domestic position improved following the 1973 [[1973 Arab–Israeli War|October War]].&lt;ref name="Podeh100"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooper67"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cooper|1982|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Sadat's [[Infitah]] policy sought to open Egypt's economy for private investment.&lt;ref name="Osman 44"&gt;{{Harvnb|Osman|2011|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Heikal, ensuing anti-Nasser developments until the present day led to an Egypt "[half] at war with Abdel-Nasser, half [at war] with Anwar El-Sadat".&lt;ref name="Ahram"/&gt;

Nasser's Egyptian detractors considered him a dictator who thwarted democratic progress, imprisoned thousands of dissidents, and led a repressive administration responsible for numerous human rights violations.&lt;ref name="Ahram"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2000/501/nasser2.htm |title=Liberating Nasser's Legacy |first1=Hani |last1=Shukrallah |authorlink1=Hani Shukrallah |first2=Hosny |last2=Guindy |work=[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] |publisher=[[Al-Ahram]] |date=4 November 2000 |accessdate=23 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806232017/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2000/501/nasser2.htm |archivedate=6 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamists in Egypt, particularly members of the politically persecuted Brotherhood, viewed Nasser as oppressive, tyrannical, and demonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Podeh|2004|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal writer Tawfiq al-Hakim described Nasser as a "confused Sultan" who employed stirring rhetoric, but had no actual plan to achieve his stated goals.&lt;ref name="Osman 44" /&gt;

Some of Nasser's [[Liberalism in Egypt|liberal]] and Islamist critics in Egypt, including the founding members of the [[New Wafd Party]] and writer [[Jamal Badawi]], dismissed Nasser's popular appeal with the Egyptian masses during his presidency as being the product of successful manipulation and demagoguery.&lt;ref name="Podehix-x"/&gt; Egyptian political scientist Alaa al-Din Desouki blamed the 1952 revolution's shortcomings on Nasser's concentration of power, and Egypt's lack of democracy on Nasser's political style and his government's limitations on [[freedom of expression]] and [[Participation (decision making)|political participation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Podeh|2004|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American political scientist Mark Cooper asserted that Nasser's charisma and his direct relationship with the Egyptian people "rendered intermediaries (organizations and individuals) unnecessary".&lt;ref name="Cooper64"/&gt; He opined that Nasser's legacy was a "guarantee of instability" due to Nasser's reliance on personal power and the absence of strong political institutions under his rule.&lt;ref name="Cooper64"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cooper|1982|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Abd al-Azim Ramadan wrote that Nasser was an irrational and irresponsible leader, blaming his inclination to solitary decision-making for Egypt's losses during the Suez War, among other events.&lt;ref name="Podeh105"&gt;{{Harvnb|Podeh|2004|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miles Copeland, Jr.]], a [[Central Intelligence Agency]] officer known for his close personal relationship with Nasser,{{sfn|Wilford|2013|pp=xi, 67–68, 137, 153, 225, 283}} said that the barriers between Nasser and the outside world have grown so thick that all but the information that attest to his infallibility, indispensability, and immortality has been filtered out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Podeh|2004|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zakaria Mohieddin]], who was Nasser's vice president, said that Nasser gradually changed during his reign. He ceased consulting his colleagues and made more and more of the decisions himself. Although Nasser repeatedly said  that a war with Israel will start at a time of his, or Arab, choosing, in 1967 he started a bluffing game "but a successful bluff means your opponent must not know which cards you are holding. In this case Nasser's opponent could see his hand in the mirror and knew he was only holding a pair of deuces" and Nasser knew that his army is not prepared yet. "All of this was out of character...His tendencies in this regard may have been accentuated by diabetes... That was the only rational explanation for his actions in 1967".&lt;ref name="Parker1993p79"/&gt;
 	
Nasser told an East German newspaper in 1964 that "no person, not even the most simple one, takes seriously the lie of the six million Jews that were murdered [in the Holocaust]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Satloff |first=Robert |title=Among the Righteous: Lost Stories from the Holocaust's Long Reach Into Arab lands |publisher=PublicAffairs |year=2007 |page=163 |isbn=9781586485108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Laqueur |first=Walter |title=The Changing Face of Antisemitism: From Ancient Times to the Present Day |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |page=141 |isbn=9780195304299}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wistrich1985p188"/&gt; However he is not known to have ever again publicly called the figure of six million into question, perhaps because his advisors and East German contacts had advised him on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Achar | first = Gilbert | title = The Arabs and the Holocaust | publisher = Saqi Books | year = 2011 | page = 210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional leadership===

There are a few other men in uniform walking behind them|[[Gaafar Nimeiry]] of Sudan (left), Nasser, and [[Muammar Gaddafi]] of [[Libya]] (right) at the [[Tripoli International Airport|Tripoli Airport]], 1969. Nimeiry and Gaddafi were influenced by Nasser's pan-Arabist ideas and the latter sought to succeed him as "leader of the Arabs".]]

Through his actions and speeches, and because he was able to symbolize the popular Arab will, Nasser inspired several nationalist revolutions in the Arab world.&lt;ref name="Osman 42" /&gt; He defined the politics of his generation and communicated directly with the public masses of the Arab world, bypassing the various heads of states of those countries—an accomplishment not repeated by other Arab leaders.&lt;ref name="Podehix-x"&gt;{{Harvnb|Podeh|2004|pp=ix–x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent of Nasser's centrality in the region made it a priority for incoming Arab nationalist heads of state to seek good relations with Egypt, in order to gain popular legitimacy from their own citizens.&lt;ref name="Dawisha151"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawisha|2009|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To varying degrees,&lt;ref name="Cook41"/&gt; Nasser's [[statism|statist]] system of government was continued in Egypt and emulated by virtually all Arab republics,&lt;ref name="Podeh47"&gt;{{Harvnb|Podeh|2004|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; namely Algeria, Syria, Iraq, Tunisia, [[Yemen]], Sudan, and Libya.&lt;ref name="Cook41"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Podeh47"/&gt; [[Ahmed Ben Bella]], Algeria's first president, was a staunch Nasserist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Abdel-Malek |first=Anouar |authorlink=Anouar Abdel-Malek |url=http://socialistregister.com/index.php/srv/article/view/5927 |title=Nasserism and Socialism |work=The Socialist Register |volume=1 |year=1964 |page=52 |accessdate=26 November 2009 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abdullah al-Sallal drove out the king of North Yemen in the name of Nasser's pan-Arabism.&lt;ref name="Aburish207"/&gt; Other coups influenced by Nasser included those that occurred in Iraq in July 1958 and Syria in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Asterjian|2007|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muammar Gaddafi, who overthrew the [[Idris of Libya|Libyan monarchy]] in 1969, considered Nasser his hero and sought to succeed him as "leader of the Arabs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fetini |first=Alyssa |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1876539,00.html |title=Muammar Gaddafi |work=[[Time magazine|Time]] |date=3 February 2009 |accessdate=24 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1969, Colonel [[Gaafar Nimeiry]], a supporter of Nasser, took power in Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rubin|2010|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arab Nationalist Movement]] (ANM) helped spread Nasser's pan-Arabist ideas throughout the Arab world, particularly among the Palestinians, Syrians, and Lebanese,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kimmerling|Migdal|2003|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawisha156"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawisha|2009|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[South Yemen]], the [[Persian Gulf]], and Iraq.&lt;ref name="Dawisha156"/&gt; While many regional heads of state tried to emulate Nasser, Podeh opined that the "[[parochialism]]" of successive Arab leaders "transformed imitation [of Nasser] into parody".&lt;ref name="Podeh47"/&gt;

===Portrayal in film===
In 1963, Egyptian director [[Youssef Chahine]] produced the film ''[[Al Nasser Salah Ad-Din (film)|El Nasser Salah El Dine]]'' ("Saladin The Victorious"), which intentionally drew parallels between [[Saladin]], considered a hero in the Arab world, and Nasser and his pan-Arabist policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haydock|Risden|2009|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser is played by [[Ahmed Zaki (actor)|Ahmed Zaki]] in [[Mohamed Fadel]]'s 1996 ''[[Nasser 56]]''. The film set the Egyptian box office record at the time, and focused on Nasser during the Suez Crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gordon|2000|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Gayle |last=Young |title=Nasser film strikes chord with the people of Egypt |url=http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9610/24/egypt.nasser/ |work=[[CNN]] |publisher=Cable News Network, Inc. |date=24 October 1996 |accessdate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also considered a milestone in [[Egyptian cinema|Egyptian]] and [[Arab cinema]] as the first film to dramatize the role of a modern-day Arab leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hourani|Khoury|2004|p=599}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the 1999 Syrian [[Biographical film|biopic]] ''Gamal Abdel Nasser'', the films marked the first biographical movies about contemporary public figures produced in the Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Karawya |first=Fayrouz |url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/biopics-arab-world-history-entangled-subjectivity |title=Biopics in the Arab world: History entangled with subjectivity|work=Egypt Independent|publisher=Al-Masry Al-Youm|date=29 August 2011|accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is portrayed by Amir Boutrous in the [[Netflix]] television series ''[[The Crown (TV series)|The Crown]]''.

==Personal life==
[[File:Nasser's family.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A group of related people posing outdoors. From left to right, there are three women dressed in shirts and long skirts, three boys dressed in suits and ties and a man in a suit and tie|Nasser and his family in Manshiyat al-Bakri, 1963. From left to right, his daughter Mona, his wife [[Tahia Kazem]], daughter Hoda, son Abdel Hakim, son [[Khalid Abdel Nasser|Khaled]], son Abdel Hamid, and Nasser.]]

In 1944, Nasser married [[Tahia Kazem]], the 22-year-old daughter of a wealthy [[Iranian people|Iranian]] father and an Egyptian mother, both of whom died when she was young. She was introduced to Nasser through her brother, Abdel Hamid Kazim, a merchant friend of Nasser's, in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sullivan|1986|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; After their wedding, the couple moved into a house in Manshiyat al-Bakri, a suburb of Cairo, where they would live for the rest of their lives. Nasser's entry into the officer corps in 1937 secured him relatively well-paid employment in a society where most people lived in poverty.&lt;ref name="Alexander27"/&gt;

Nasser and Tahia would sometimes discuss politics at home, but for the most part, Nasser kept his career separate from his family life. He preferred to spend most of his free time with his children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sullivan|1986|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser and Tahia had two daughters and three sons: Hoda, Mona, [[Khalid Abdel Nasser|Khaled]], Abdel Hamid, and Abdel Hakim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|pp=313–320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he was a proponent of secular politics, Nasser was an observant Muslim who made the [[Hajj]] pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] in 1954 and 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alexander|2005|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was known to be personally incorruptible,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Makdissi|2011|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bird177"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bird|2010|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldschmidt167"&gt;{{Harvnb|Goldschmidt|2008|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alexander|2005|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; a characteristic which further enhanced his reputation among the citizens of Egypt and the Arab world.&lt;ref name="Goldschmidt167"/&gt; Nasser's personal hobbies included playing chess, American films, reading Arabic, English, and French magazines, and listening to classical music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bird|2010|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasser engaged in [[chain smoking]].&lt;ref name="Daigle115"&gt;{{Harvnb|Daigle|2012|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bird177"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained 18-hour workdays and rarely took time off for vacations. The combination of smoking and working long hours contributed to his poor health. He was diagnosed with diabetes in the early 1960s and by the time of his death in 1970, he also had arteriosclerosis, heart disease, and high blood pressure. He suffered two major heart attacks (in 1966 and 1969), and was on [[bed rest]] for six weeks after the second episode. State media reported that Nasser's absence from the public view at that time was a result of influenza.&lt;ref name="Daigle115"/&gt;

==Writings==

The '''Gesellschaft zur Rechtlichen und Humanitären Unterstützung''' (GRH) is a German [[historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionist]] organisation consisting of former employees of the [[East Germany|East German]] secret police, the [[Stasi]]. It is led by the last Stasi chief, [[Wolfgang Schwanitz]]. In Germany the organisation is best known for its attempt to portray the Stasi in a positive light and for trivializing or denying the political repression in East Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hubertus Knabe]]: ''Die Täter sind unter uns.

It has also been accused of harassing victims of the East German regime and journalists and politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Wensierski: "[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-46421514.html STASI: Die Rache der Rentner]." In: ''[[Der Spiegel]]. 27 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; GRH has been described by historian [[Hubertus Knabe]], the Director of the [[Berlin-Hohenschönhausen Memorial]], as an "aid association for state criminals."&lt;ref&gt;Knabe 2008 p. 277ff&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010''' ({{USPL|111|296}}) is a federal statute signed into law by President [[Barack Obama]] on December 13, 2010.  The bill is part of the reauthorization of funding for [[child nutrition]] (see the original [[Child Nutrition Act]]). The bill funds [[child nutrition programs]] and free lunch programs in schools for the next 5 years.&lt;ref name="whitehouse-paper"&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/Child_Nutrition_Fact_Sheet_12_10_10.pdf Child Nutrition Fact Sheet], whitehouse.gov&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the bill sets new nutrition standards for schools, and allocates $4.5 billion for their implementation.&lt;ref name="whitehouse-paper"/&gt;  The new nutrition standards have been a point initiative of First Lady [[Michelle Obama]] in her fight against [[childhood obesity]] as part of her [[Let's Move!]] initiative.&lt;ref name=fox&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelly|first=Megyn|title=Students Choose to Go Hungry Rather than Eat Healthy School Lunches|url=http://foxnewsinsider.com/2012/09/26/students-hungry-eat-healthy-school-lunches/|work=Fox News Insider|publisher=[[FOX News Network]]|accessdate=13 February 2013|date=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In FY 2011, federal spending totaled $10.1 billion for the National School Lunch Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://frac.org/federal-foodnutrition-programs/national-school-lunch-program/ |title=National School Lunch Program |author=Food Research and Action Center |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act allows [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]], for the first time in 30 years, opportunity to make real reforms to the school lunch and breakfast programs by improving the critical nutrition and hunger safety net for millions of children.&lt;ref name="Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fns.usda.gov/school-meals/healthy-hunger-free-kids-act|title=Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act  |website=[[Food and Nutrition Service]]|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|date=May 10, 2017|access-date=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act and Michelle Obama were a step in transforming the [[Food pyramid (nutrition)|food pyramid]] recommendation, which has been around since the early 1990s, into what is now known as "[[MyPlate]]".

According to the [[US Department of Agriculture]], for the 2012-13 school year, 21.5 million USA children received a free lunch or reduced-price lunch at school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://frac.org/federal-foodnutrition-programs/national-school-lunch-program/ |title=2012-2013 Participation School Meals |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across the U.S, the school lunch program varies by state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schoolnutrition.org/uploadedFiles/2012-2013State-by-State%20School%20Meal%20Mandates%20and%20Reimbursements(1).pdf?n=9023 |title=State-by-State Listing for School Meal Mandates and Reimbursements - As of April 2013 |author=School Nutrition Association |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislative history ==

== Provisions ==
The Healthy, Hunger Free Kids Act allows the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to make significant changes to the school lunch program for the first time in over 30 years.&lt;ref name="Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act"/&gt;   
In addition to funding standard child nutrition and school lunch programs, there are several new nutritional standards in the bill.  The main aspects are listed below.&lt;ref name="whitehouse-paper"/&gt;

==New Food Standards==
* Gives USDA the authority to set new standards for food sold in lunches during the regular day, including vending machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-01-26/pdf/2012-1010.pdf |title=Nutrition Standards in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs; Final Rule |author=US Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service |date=January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Authorizes additional funds for the new standards for federally-subsidized school lunches.
* Provides resources for schools and communities to utilize local farms and gardens to provide fresh produce.
* Provides resources to increase nutritional quality of food provided by USDA
* Sets minimum standards for school wellness policies
* Limits milk served to nonfat flavored milk or 1 percent white milk&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhregister.com/general-news/20120331/feds-to-require-students-to-buy-fruit-vegetables-with-school-cafeteria-lunches |title=Feds to require students to buy fruit, vegetables with school cafeteria Lunch |author=Brian McCready |publisher=[[New Haven Register]] |date=March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Reduced portion sizes in meals
*Mandate a minimum on fruit, vegetables, and whole grain servings
*Mandate a maximum sodium, sugar, and fat content

=== Increases access ===
* Increased the number of eligible children for school meal programs by 115,000
* Uses census data to determine student need in high-poverty areas, rather than relying on paper applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://frac.org/newsite/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/provision2.pdf |title=Provision 2 of the National School Lunch Act |author=Madeleine Levin Food Research and Action Center |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Authorizes USDA to provide meals in more after-school programs in "high-risk" areas
* Increases access to drinking water in schools

=== Program monitoring ===
* Requires school districts to be audited every 3 years to see if they have met nutrition standards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/2013-02-22_AE10.pdf |title=National School Lunch Program: Direct Certification Continuous Improvement Plans Required by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 |author=US Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service |date=February 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Requires easier access for students and parents about nutritional facts of meals
* Improves recall procedures for school food
* Provides training for school lunch providers&lt;ref name="Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act"/&gt;   

==Criticism==
A YouTube video, produced by Wallace High School students drew national attention and over 1.5 million views. The video complained of its students being "hungry" and not fed well enough to participate in their extracurricular activities or sports due to reduced portion sizes relative to those prior to the new law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IB7NDUSBOo |title=We Are Hungry video |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to viewing the video, nutrition specialists explained that before the new standards were implemented, some schools may have been serving a lot of protein to keep their customers happy, "but none of us need as much protein as a lot of us eat". The experts also explained that eating 850 calories at lunch is enough for most high schoolers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012/09/28/kids-push-back-on-new-school-lunch/57842204/1 |title=Students push back on new school lunches |author=Nanci Hellmich |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=2012-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the viral video, other students are reaching out on other forms of social media by using the hashtag 'ThanksMichelleObama'. [[Sam Kass]], the executive director of [[Let's Move!]] and senior policy adviser for Nutrition shared "We've seen the photos being tweeted, but we don't dictate the food that schools serve-school districts do."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/1627822106&lt;/ref&gt; A study done by [[Harvard School of Public Health]] discovered that about 60 percent of vegetables and roughly 40 percent of fresh fruit are thrown away due to no interest.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Overall, the amount of food students did not eat but threw away instead increased by 56 percent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; One of the biggest points of criticism for Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act is meal participation, and the participations has not increased, but decreased.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The program has declined by nearly 4 percent and some schools have lost revenue due to the decline in participation, therefore, many are choosing to opt out of the program as a whole.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/the-administration/253931-should-congress-trash-michelle-obamas-lunch-program|title=Should Congress trash Michelle Obama’s lunch program?|last=Picard|first=Joe|date=2015-09-17|newspaper=[[TheHill]]|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the criticism, the USDA issued modified standards which were intended to be more flexible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?contentidonly=true&amp;contentid=2014/01/0001.xml |author=USDA Office of Communications  |title=USDA Makes Permanent Meat and Grain Serving Flexibilities in National School Lunch Program |date=January 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Success ==
The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act provides meals to children that normally could not afford those nutritious food items. Research suggests that rural children are more likely to be overweight or obese when compared to urban children, the diets of rural children are less nutritious and their families have less access to healthy food, leading into the next reason of benefiting children facing obesity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1111/josh.12356|pmid=26762822|title="Reforms Looked Really Good on Paper": Rural Food Service Responses to the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010|journal=[[Journal of School Health]]|volume=86|issue=2|pages=113|year=2016|last1=Cornish|first1=Disa|last2=Askelson|first2=Natoshia|last3=Golembiewski|first3=Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also allows schools to have more resources that they may not have had before.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A study in Virginia and Massachusetts concluded that children in schools were eating significantly healthier meals when their parents or guardians were not choosing their food, but the school was.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While looking at the nutrition value of 1.7 million meals selected by 7,200 students in three middle and three high schools in an urban school district in Washington state, where the data was collected and compared in the 16 months before the standards were carried out with data collected in the 15 months after implementation; the information found that there was an increase in six nutrients: fiber, iron, calcium, [[vitamin A]], [[vitamin C]], and protein.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/1753290297&lt;/ref&gt; While providing new meals with improvements in fruits, vegetables, amount of variety, and portion sizes, the calorie intake has also transformed. The energy density ration was 1.65 before Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act compared to the new number of 1.44 after.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The '''Bellevue Palace''' is a [[Star (classification)|five-star]] [[luxury hotel]] located in the [[Old City of Bern|Old City]] of [[Bern]], [[Switzerland]]. Owned by the [[Swiss Confederation]], it is the state's guesthouse for visiting [[heads of state]] and [[Head of government|government]], and is host to dozens of members of [[Swiss Federal Assembly|parliament]] during the weeks the assembly is in session.&lt;ref name=swissinfo/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Hotel Bellevue Bern Staatsarchiv Bern FN Jost N 772.jpg|thumb|left|Reception in 1933]]
The original Bellevue Palace was built by the financier Friedrich Osswald in 1865 immediately adjacent to the seat of the federal government, the [[Federal Palace of Switzerland|Bundeshaus]]. His heirs had the hotel torn down and rebuilt it in 1910&lt;ref name=Geschichte&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Geschichte des Hotel BELLEVUE PALACE in Bern|author=Victoria-Jungfrau Collection AG|language=German|accessdate=May 2008|url=http://www.victoria-jungfrau-collection.ch/PortalData/4/Resources/presse-media/Allg-Informationen/04_BP/De/BP_Geschichte_de.pdf}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style. The new Bellevue Palace was reopened in 1913, and General [[Ulrich Wille]] made it Switzerland's military headquarters during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=swissinfo&gt;{{cite news|title=Bellevue Palace back in business|date=December 31, 2002 |publisher=[[Swissinfo]]|author=Dale Bechtel|url=http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/news/travel/Bellevue_Palace_back_in_business.html?siteSect=415&amp;sid=1543571}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], the hotel remained open for business. It became a focal point of the warring powers' diplomatic and intelligence activities in Switzerland, and its bar was a haunt of [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] station chief [[Allen Dulles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Allen Dulles: Master of Spies|author=[[James Srodes]]|isbn=0-89526-223-1|year=1999|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Geschichte/&gt; One half of the restaurant came to be frequented by [[Allies of World War II |Allied]] guests and the other by patrons from [[Axis powers|Axis]] states.

After the war, the hotel's fortunes declined sharply.&lt;ref name=Geschichte/&gt; To prevent the state hotel from being acquired by foreign buyers, the [[Swiss National Bank]] acquired it in 1976, and in 1994 made a gift of it to the Confederation, which retains 99.7% of the hotel's shares.&lt;ref name=swissinfo/&gt; After it became apparent that the Bellevue Palace was in need of an overhaul, as it lacked amenities such as [[air conditioning]],&lt;ref name=swissinfo/&gt; it was closed in 2002 for a one-year renovation that cost [[Swiss franc|CHF]] 40 million and cut the number of rooms from 230 to 130.&lt;ref name=swissinfo/&gt; Following a spate of bad publicity over low staff wages,&lt;ref name=swissinfo/&gt; the Confederation turned over the management to a chain of Swiss luxury hotels in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hotel Bellevue Palace mit Rekordjahr|publisher=[[Schweizerische Depeschenagentur|SDA]]|date=10 May 2006|language=German|url=http://www.nachrichten.ch/detail/241273.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bellevue Palace has been host to a great number of heads of state and government, including [[Winston Churchill]], [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], [[Jawaharlal Nehru]],&lt;ref name=swissinfo/&gt; [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Akihito|Emperor Akihito]].&lt;ref name=Basistext/&gt; When it was used as a negotiating venue in the [[Helsinki Accords|Helsinki process]] during the [[Cold War]], some participants called it "the best-protected building in Europe" due to its array of security features and extensive police protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Taking Glasnost seriously: toward an open Soviet Union|author=[[Michael Novak]]|page=15|isbn=0-8447-3642-2|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of [[John le Carré]]'s spy novel ''[[Smiley's People]]'' and its TV adaption are set in the Bellevue Palace.&lt;ref name=Basistext&gt;{{cite web|title=Offizielles Gästehaus der Schweizer Regierung|author=Victoria-Jungfrau Collection AG|language=German|accessdate=May 2008|url=http://www.victoria-jungfrau-collection.ch/PortalData/4/Resources/presse-media/Allg-Informationen/04_BP/De/BP_Basistext_de.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204182806/http://www.victoria-jungfrau-collection.ch/PortalData/4/Resources/presse-media/Allg-Informationen/04_BP/De/BP_Basistext_de.pdf/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Swiss politics]], the hotel's bar and lounge are known to be the site of much late-night political [[horse trading (political) | horse trading]] during parliamentary sessions, such as arranging elections of [[Swiss Federal Council|Federal Councillors]].&lt;ref name=swissinfo/&gt;

== Characteristics ==

Apart from ballrooms, restaurants, salons, bars and conference facilities, the Bellevue Palace features an array of suites, including an extensive "Presidential Suite" with a view of the [[Bernese Alps]] over the [[Aare]].&lt;ref name=swissinfo/&gt; The hotel's cuisine is rated at 16 [[Gault Millau]] points.&lt;ref name=Basistext/&gt; ''[[Frommer's]] Switzerland'' describes the Bellevue Palace as "the grand old dame of Bern" and "the most lavish and opulent choice in town", opining that "dining on the renowned Bellevue Terrace is one of the reasons to come to Bern."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Frommer's]] Switzerland|author=Darwin Porter, Danforth Prince|page=184|year=2006|isbn=0-471-79391-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hotel is a member of the [[Leading Hotels of the World]] association.

The '''Information Research Department''' (IRD), founded in 1948 by [[Christopher Mayhew| Christopher Mayhew MP]], was a department of the British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] set up to counter Soviet propaganda and infiltration, particularly amongst the western [[labour movement]].

Although the existence of the department was kept confidential, the [[Soviet Union]] was fully aware of it as [[Guy Burgess]] had been posted to IRD for a period of two months in 1948 before being sacked by Mayhew for being "dirty, drunk and idle."&lt;ref name="Death of the department that never was"&gt;[http://www.cambridgeclarion.org/e/fo_deceit_unit_graun_27jan1978.html Death of the department that never was] from ''[[The Guardian]]'', 27 January 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
In a confidential paper to the foreign secretary, [[Ernest Bevin]], in 1947, Mayhew, at the time a junior minister, had proposed a "propaganda counter-offensive" and [[Clement Attlee|Attlee]] summoned him to [[Chequers]] to discuss it further.&lt;ref name="Death of the department that never was"/&gt; Mayhew ran the department with Sir [[Ivone Kirkpatrick]]&lt;ref name="Death of the department that never was"/&gt; until 1950.

The original offices were in [[Carlton House Terrace]], before moving to [[Riverwalk House]], [[Millbank]], London.

==Staff==
The first head of IRD was [[Ralph Murray]], later a diplomat. [[John Rennie (spymaster)|John Rennie]], who subsequently served as head of [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]], was head of the department between 1953 and 1958. The last head of the IRD was [[Ray Whitney (politician)|Ray Whitney]], later a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] member of parliament and junior minister.
IRD was staffed with many emigres, from [[Iron Curtain]] countries. IRD officials were ordered not to tell even other FO staff where they worked. IRD flourished in the 1950s. The staff of the Soviet section alone rose from 20 to more than 60. Embassies had resident IRD men under cover who planted material on local journalists – and opinion formers. Other staffers included [[Robert Conquest]] and his assistant Celia Kirwan, who was given [[Orwell's list]].&lt;ref name=guardian-20021106&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/nov/06/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries |title=Obituary: Celia Goodman |author=D J Taylor |newspaper=The Guardian |date=6 November 2002 |accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IRD was one of the largest sections of the Foreign Office.&lt;ref name=guardian-20180724/&gt;

==Propaganda==
IRD's main targets were in the [[Third World]].&lt;ref name="Death of the department that never was"/&gt; However, it was also set out to "be of use to" British media and opinion formers. As well as supplying material to the [[BBC World Service]], secret lists were compiled of approved journalists and trade unionists to whom material was offered, if not always accepted.

British introductions to IRD were made discreetly. Journalists were told as little as possible about the Department. Material was sent to their homes under plain cover as correspondence marked "personal" carried no departmental identification or reference. They were told documents were "prepared" in the [[Foreign Office|FCO]] primarily for members of the diplomatic service, but that it was allowed to give them on a personal basis to a few people outside the service who might find them of interest. As such, they were not statements of official policy and should not be attributed to [[Her Majesty's Government|HMG]], nor should the titles themselves be quoted in discussion or in print. The papers should not be shown to anyone else and they were to be destroyed when no longer needed.&lt;ref name="Death of the department that never was"/&gt;

As part of its remit "to collect and summarize reliable information about Soviet and communist misdoings, to disseminate it to friendly journalists, politicians, and trade unionists, and to support, financially and otherwise, anticommunist publications",&lt;ref name= "The New York Review of Books"&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/16550 "Orwell's List" by Timothy Garton Ash.] ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' Volume 50, Number 14. 25 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; it subsidised the publication of books by Background Books, including three by [[Bertrand Russell]]: ''Why Communism Must Fail'', ''What Is Freedom?'', and ''What Is Democracy?''&lt;ref name= "The New York Review of Books"/&gt; Russell was fully aware of the funding for his books, while others, such as the philosopher [[Bryan Magee]], who contributed ''The Democratic Revolution'', were outraged when they found out.

Other publications were written by IRD staffers such as the scholar and author [[Robert Conquest]].
 
Likewise, the IRD funded the Burmese, Chinese, and Arabic editions of [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]''.

In a joint operation with the [[CIA]], ''[[Encounter (magazine)|Encounter]]'' magazine was established. Published in the [[United Kingdom]], it was a largely Anglo-American intellectual and cultural journal, originally associated with the [[anti-Stalinist left]], intended to counter the idea of [[cold war]] neutralism. The magazine was rarely critical of American foreign policy, but beyond this editors had considerable publishing freedom. It was edited by [[Stephen Spender]] from 1953 to 1966. Spender resigned after it emerged that the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]], which published the magazine, was being covertly funded by the [[CIA]].&lt;ref name="ns-19990712"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/node/135185 |title=How the CIA plotted against us |author-link=Frances Stonor Saunders |author=Frances Stonor Saunders |newspaper=[[New Statesman]]. |date=12 July 1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010045414/http://www.newstatesman.com/node/135185 |archivedate=10 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

===Indonesia===
Following the [[30 September Movement|abortive Indonesian Communist coup attempt]] of 1965 and the subsequent [[Indonesian killings of 1965-66|reprisal killings]], the IRD's South East Asia Monitoring Unit in Singapore assisted the [[Indonesian Army]]'s destruction of the [[Indonesian Communist Party]] (PKI) by circulating anti-PKI propaganda through several radio channels including the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]], [[Radio Televisyen Malaysia#History|Radio Malaysia]], [[Radio Australia]], and the [[Voice of America]], and through newspapers like ''[[The Straits Times]]''. The same anti-PKI message was repeated by an anti-Sukarno radio station called Radio Free Indonesia and the IRD's own newsletter. Recurrent themes emphasised by the IRD included the brutality of PKI members in murdering the Indonesian generals and their families, [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] intervention in the Communist attempt to overthrow the government and the PKI subverting Indonesian on behalf of foreign powers. The IRD's propaganda efforts were aided by the United States, Australian and [[Malaysia]]n governments which had an interest in supporting the Army's anti-Communist mass murder and opposing [[President of Indonesia|President]] [[Sukarno]]. The IRD's information  efforts helped corroborate the Indonesia Army's propaganda efforts against the PKI. In addition, the [[Harold Wilson#First term as Prime Minister#External affairs|Harold Wilson Labour Government]] and its Australian counterpart gave the Indonesian Army leadership an assurance that British and Commonwealth forces would not step up the [[Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Easter |first=David |last2= |first2= |date=2005 |title=Keep the Indonesian Pot Boiling: Western Covert Intervention in Indonesia, October 1965&amp;mdash;March 1966 |url= http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1468274042000283144?journalCode=fcwh20#.VH-QwTGUeSo|journal=Cold War History |publisher= |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=64–65 |doi= 10.1080/1468274042000283144|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British trade unions===
In 1969 [[Home Secretary]] [[James Callaghan]] requested action that would hinder the careers of two "politically motivated" [[Trade unions in the United Kingdom|trade unionists]], [[Jack Jones (trade unionist)|Jack Jones]] of the [[Transport and General Workers Union]] and [[Hugh Scanlon]] of the [[Amalgamated Engineering Union]]. This issue was raised in [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|cabinet]], and further discussed with [[Secretary of State for Employment]] [[Barbara Castle]]. A plan for detrimental leaks to the media was placed in the IRD files, and the head of the IRD prepared a briefing paper. However information about how this was effected has not been released under the [[thirty-year rule]] under a section of the [[Public Records Act 1967|Public Records Act]] permitting national security exemptions.&lt;ref name=guardian-20180724&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/24/wilson-government-used-secret-unit-to-smear-union-leaders |title=Wilson government used secret unit to smear union leaders |last=Cobain |first=Ian |newspaper=The Guardian |date=24 July 2018 |accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The ethical objection raised by IRD's critics was that the public did not know the source of the information and could therefore not make allowances for the possible bias. It differed thus from straightforward propaganda from the British point of view.&lt;ref name="Death of the department that never was"/&gt; This was countered by saying that the information was given to those who were already sympathetic to democracy and the West, and who had arrived at these positions independently.

==Orwell's list==
{{Main|Orwell's list}}
Among the many lists of journalists and trade unionists, etc., kept by the department, one that came to light to much polemic more than fifty years after it was compiled was a list drawn up by novelist [[George Orwell]], an early anti-Stalinist.

On 2 May 1949, Celia Kirwan, a close friend of Orwell's who worked for the IRD, received [[Orwell's list|a list compiled by Orwell]] containing thirty-eight names of journalists and writers&lt;ref&gt;''Guardian Review'', 21 June 2003&lt;/ref&gt; who, in his opinion, "are crypto-communists, fellow-travellers or inclined that way and should not be trusted as propagandists."
The list, divided into three columns headed "Name" "Job" and "Remarks" included [[Charlie Chaplin]]; [[J. B. Priestley]]; the actor [[Michael Redgrave]]; the historian [[E. H. Carr]]; the editor of the ''[[New Statesman]]'', [[Kingsley Martin]]; the ''[[New York Times]]'''s Moscow correspondent [[Walter Duranty]]; the former Trotskyist writer [[Isaac Deutscher]]; Labour MP [[Tom Driberg]] and the novelist [[Naomi Mitchison]], as well as other lesser-known writers and journalists.

On the list was the name of [[Peter Smollett]], who Orwell claimed "...gives strong impression of being some kind of Russian agent. Very slimy person." Smollett had been the head of the Soviet section in the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|British Ministry of Information]], while in fact being a Soviet agent who had been recruited by [[Kim Philby]].

==Closure==
The department was said to be closed down by then [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], [[David Owen]], in 1977. Its existence did not become public until 1978.&lt;ref name="Death of the department that never was"/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-20180724/&gt;

The '''Irish Church Act 1869''' (32 &amp; 33 Vict. c. 42) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] passed during [[Premierships of William Ewart Gladstone|William Ewart Gladstone's administration]] and which came into force on 1 January 1871.

The Act [[disestablishment|disestablished]] the ([[wiktionary:Anglican|Anglican]]) [[Church of Ireland]],  a body that commanded the adherence of a small minority of the population of Ireland, disassociating it from the state and repealing the law that required [[tithe]]s to be paid to it. It also ceased to send representatives to the [[House of Lords]]. Existing clergy of the church received a [[life annuity]] in lieu of the revenues to which they were no longer entitled: [[tithe]], [[rentcharge]], [[ministers' money]], [[stipend]]s and augmentations, and certain marriage and burial fees.&lt;ref name="Bernard1871"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bernard|first=William Leigh|title=Decisions Under the Irish Church Act, 1869, 32 &amp; 33 Victoria, Cap. 42, and Details of the Annuities Ordered and Declared by the Commissioners of Church Temporalities in Ireland, with an Index|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MKsyAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA58|accessdate=20 November 2014|year=1871|publisher=A. Thom|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The passage of the Bill through Parliament caused acrimony between the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and the [[House of Lords]], with [[Queen Victoria]] intervening personally to mediate. The Lords did extort from the Commons more compensation to alleviate the disestablished churchmen, but in the end the will of the Commons prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;McKechnie, ''The reform of the House of Lords'' p.49&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish Church Act was a key move in dismantling the [[Protestant Ascendancy]] which had dominated Ireland for several centuries previously.

The '''Kiriyama Prize''' was an international [[literary award]] awarded to books about the Pacific Rim and South Asia. Its goal is to encourage greater understanding among the peoples and nations of the region. Established in 1996, the prize was last awarded in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kiriyamaprize.org/winners/finalists/previousfinal.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110618174735/http://www.kiriyamaprize.org/winners/finalists/previousfinal.shtml |archivedate=2011-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winners include [[Greg Mortenson]], [[David Oliver Relin]], Luis Alberto Urrea, [[Piers Vitebsky]], [[Nadeem Aslam]], [[Suketu Mehta]], Shan Sa, [[Inga Clendinnen]], [[Pascal Khoo Thwe]], [[Rohinton Mistry]], Patricia Grace, [[Peter Hessler]], Michael David Kwan, [[Michael Ondaatje]], [[Cheng Ch'ing-wen]], [[Andrew X. Pham]], [[Ruth Ozeki]], Patrick Smith, and [[Alan Brown (filmmaker)|Alan Brown]].

==Prize==
The prize was worth $30,000, split evenly between a non-fiction and a fiction winner. It was awarded by Pacific Rim Voices, a nonprofit organization based in [[San Francisco, California]]. For its first three years, the prize was given only to one book, either fiction or non-fiction.

To be eligible, a book had to significantly concern some aspect of life or culture in one of the four Pacific Rim subregions: the North Pacific; Southeast Asia and the South Pacific; the Americas; and the Indian subcontinent. Books could be written in or translated into English from another language. Books were submitted by publishers by late October each year and were judged by separate panels of five judges, one for fiction and one for non-fiction. The decisions were made between November and February. Finalists were announced at the end of February, and the prize itself was given at the end of March.

Judges included [[Alan Cheuse]], [[James D. Houston]], Sally Ito, [[Gish Jen]], [[Chalmers Johnson]], [[Nicholas Jose]], [[Maxine Hong Kingston]], [[Ruthanne Lum McCunn]], [[Lisa See]], [[Linda Spalding]], [[Robert Sullivan (poet)|Robert Sullivan]], [[Gail Tsukiyama]], Kathleen Tyau, and [[Jade Snow Wong]].

The '''Kurdistan Workers' Party''' or '''PKK''' ({{lang-ku|Partiya Karkerên Kurdistanê}}) is a [[militant]] and political organization based in [[Turkey]] and [[Iraq]]. Since 1984 the PKK has been involved in [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict (1978–present)|an armed conflict with the Turkish state]] (With a 2 year cease-fire during 2013-2015), with the initial aim of achieving an independent Kurdish state, later changing it to a demand for equal rights and Kurdish autonomy in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Paul|title=The PKK: Coming Down from the Mountains|date=2015|publisher=Zed Books Ltd.|isbn=9781783600403|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5hBkDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT79&amp;lpg=PT79&amp;dq=PKK+autonomy+and&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Km4TX9UM5L&amp;sig=hYIkWRxoO6zVZlg6tPdUFLA2ens&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjG45yk06LVAhVMBsAKHRuOAA4Q6AEIWTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=PKK%20autonomy%20and&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stanton|first1=Jessica A.|title=Violence and Restraint in Civil War: Civilian Targeting in the Shadow of International Law|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107069107|page=217|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1NX4DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA217&amp;lpg=PA217&amp;dq=PKK+demands+autonomy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=x01l-4ebwY&amp;sig=wi3oY1EAG4lqCtVIWIXX-SHhkIQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiKx5WW0qLVAhUKBsAKHRagAw0Q6AEITjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=PKK%20demands%20autonomy&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=France-Presse|first1=Agence|title=Turkish lecturer to be put on trial for posing exam question on PKK leader|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/03/turkish-lecturer-to-be-put-on-trial-for-posing-exam-question-on-pkk-leader|accessdate=24 July 2017|work=The Guardian|date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ever closer to independence|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21644167-iraqs-kurds-are-independent-all-name-they-must-play-their-cards-cleverly-if-they|accessdate=24 July 2017|work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group was founded in 1978 in the village of Fis (near [[Lice, Turkey|Lice]]) by a group of Kurdish students led by [[Abdullah Öcalan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lice'nin Fis köyünde PKK'nın kuruluşunu kutladılar|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/lice-nin-fis-ilcesinde-pkk-nin-gundem-1975981/|accessdate=2 July 2015|work=Hürriyet Daily News|date=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PKK's ideology was originally a fusion of [[revolutionary socialism]] and [[Kurdish nationalism]], seeking the foundation of an independent, [[socialist state]] in the region, which was to be known as [[Kurdistan]]. The initial reason given by the PKK for this was the [[Human rights of Kurdish people in Turkey|oppression of Kurds in Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Bilgin|editor1-first=Fevzi|editor2-last=Sarihan|editor2-first=Ali|title=Understanding Turkey's Kurdish Question|date=2013|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=9780739184035|page=90|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QwU5NplYWSEC&amp;pg=PA90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balci|first1=Ali|title=The PKK-Kurdistan Workers’ Party’s Regional Politics: During and After the Cold War|date=2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=3319422197|page=96|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hTGgDQAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; By then, the use of Kurdish language, dress, [[folklore]], and names were banned in Kurdish-inhabited areas.&lt;ref name="hannum"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hannum|first1=Hurst|title=Autonomy, sovereignty, and self-determination: the accommodation of conflicting rights|date=1996|publisher=Univ. of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=0-8122-1572-9|pages=187–9|edition=Rev.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=28PEGfCDiZEC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The words "Kurds", "[[Kurdistan]]", or "Kurdish" were officially banned by the Turkish government.&lt;ref name=bahar&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baser|first1=Bahar|title=Diasporas and Homeland Conflicts: A Comparative Perspective|date=2015|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=1-4724-2562-6|page=63|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8MTVBgAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[1980 Turkish coup d'état|military coup of 1980]], the Kurdish language was officially prohibited in public and private life.&lt;ref name=NYTK&gt;Toumani, Meline.

Since the PKK's foundation, it has been involved in armed clashes with Turkish security forces. The full-scale [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict (1978–present)|insurgency]], however, did not begin until 15 August 1984, when the PKK announced a Kurdish uprising. Since the conflict began, more than 40,000 have died, most of whom were Turkish Kurdish civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eder|first1=Mine|editor1-last=Lust|editor1-first=Ellen|title=The Middle East|date=2016|publisher=CQ Press|isbn=1506329306|edition=14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q_nlCgAAQBAJ|chapter=Turkey|quote=The Turkish military responded with a ferocious counterinsurgency campaign that led to the deaths of nearly 40,000 people, most of them Turkish Kurdish civilians, and the displacement of more than three million Kurds from southeastern Turkey.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since PKK leader Öcalan's capture and imprisonment in 1999, he has moved on from [[Marxism–Leninism]],&lt;ref name="Abdullah Öcalan 2007, p. 243-277"&gt;Abdullah Öcalan, "Prison Writings: The Roots of Civilisation", 2007, Pluto Press. (p. 243-277)&lt;/ref&gt; leading the party to adopt his new political platform of [[Abdullah Öcalan#Democratic confederalism|democratic confederalism]] while ceasing its official calls for the establishment of a fully independent country. In May 2007, former members of the PKK helped form the [[Kurdistan Communities Union]] (KCK), an umbrella organisation of Kurds from Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria. In 2013, the PKK declared a [[ceasefire]] agreement and began slowly withdrawing its fighters to the [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurdistan Region]] of northern Iraq as part of the [[solution process]] between the Turkish state and the Kurdish minority. In July 2015, the PKK announced that a [[ceasefire]] was over and said that Ankara had welched on its promises regarding the Kurdish issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PKK group says Turkish ceasefire over|url=http://rudaw.net/english/middleeast/turkey/120720151|accessdate=1 January 2016|work=Rudaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2015, the PKK announced that they would accept another ceasefire with Turkey only under [[United Nations]] or US guarantees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PKK urges US to mediate in its war with Turkey and admits to secret talks with Washington|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/turkey/11806481/PKK-urges-US-to-mediate-in-its-war-with-Turkey-and-admits-to-secret-talks-with-Washington.html|accessdate=1 January 2016|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PKK is listed as a [[terrorist organization]] by several [[#Designation as a terrorist group|states and organizations]], including the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Japan]],&lt;ref name="Japan_ban"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/announce/announce/2002/7/0705.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406134416/http://www.mofa.go.jp/announce/announce/2002/7/0705.html |archive-date=2013-04-06 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[European Union]]. However, the [[United Nations]] and countries such as [[Switzerland]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Russia]] and [[Egypt]], have not designated the PKK as a terrorist organization.

In the early 1970s, the organization's core group was made up largely of students led by [[Abdullah Öcalan]] ("'''Apo'''") in [[Ankara]]. By then, the use of Kurdish language, dress, [[folklore]], and names were banned in Kurdish-inhabited areas.&lt;ref name="hannum"/&gt; In an attempt to deny their existence, the Turkish government categorized [[Kurds]] as "Mountain Turks" until 1991.&lt;ref name="hannum"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/turkey/26.htm Turkey - Linguistic and Ethnic Groups - U.S. Library of Congress]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bartkus, Viva Ona, ''The Dynamic of Secession'', (Cambridge University Press, 1999), 90-91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Çelik|first=Yasemin|title=Contemporary Turkish foreign policy|year=1999|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=9780275965907|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y9PXcwFOLNcC&amp;lpg=PA3|edition=1. publ.|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The words "Kurds", "[[Kurdistan]]", or "Kurdish" were officially banned by the Turkish government.&lt;ref name="bahar"/&gt; Following the [[1980 Turkish coup d'état|military coup of 1980]], the Kurdish language was officially prohibited in public and private life.&lt;ref name="NYTK"/&gt; Many who spoke, published, or sang in Kurdish were arrested and imprisoned.&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press"/&gt; The PKK was then formed, as part of a growing discontent over the suppression of Turkey's ethnic Kurds, in an effort to establish linguistic, cultural, and political rights for Turkey's ethnic Kurdish minority.&lt;ref name="Palgrave Macmillan"/&gt; The group focused to the large oppressed Kurdish population in [[Southeastern Anatolia Region|south-east Turkey]]. A meeting on 25 November 1978, in a tea house near [[Diyarbakır]] is considered the founding meeting.&lt;ref name="Letsch"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/10/sakine-cansiz-pkk-kurdish-activist|title=Sakine Cansiz: 'a legend among PKK members'|last=Letsch|first=Constanze|date=10 January 2013|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 November 1978, the group adopted the name ''Kurdistan Workers' Party''. Espousing a [[Marxism|Marxist]] ideology, the group took part in violent conflicts with right-wing entities as a part of the political chaos in Turkey at the time. Some sources claimed that the group tried to assassinate the Kurdish tribal leader {{illm|Mehmet Celal Bucak|diq||ku||tr}} in 1979. They claimed that he exploited the peasants, and collaborated with Turkey in oppressing the Kurds. It is believed that this marked a period of intense [[History of the Kurdistan Workers' Party#Urban War (1978–1980)|urban warfare]] among other political elements.

Turkish sources claimed that the [[1980 Turkish coup d'état]] pushed the organization [[History of the Kurdistan Workers' Party#Syria (1980–1984)|to another stage]], with members being executed, doing jail time, being subject to capital punishment, or fleeing to Syria. On 10 November 1980, it was claimed that the PKK bombed the Turkish Consulate in [[Strasbourg]], France in a joint operation with the [[Armenians|Armenian]] radical group [[Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia|ASALA]], which they claimed as the beginning of a "fruitful collaboration."&lt;ref name="miptpkkasala"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tkb.org/Incident.jsp?incID=2735|author=[[MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base]]|title=Incident Profile: Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA) and Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) attacked Diplomatic target (November 10, 1980, France)|accessdate=17 April 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033518/http://www.tkb.org/Incident.jsp?incID=2735|archivedate=30 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PKK didn't take responsibility despite a numerous of accusations.

Starting in 1984, [[History of the Kurdistan Workers' Party#Paramilitary I (1984–1992)|the PKK transformed]] into a paramilitary group, using training camps in Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and France. It launched attacks and bombings against Turkish governmental installations, the military, and various institutions of the state.

From the mid-1990s, it was claimed that the organization began to lose [[History of the Kurdistan Workers' Party#Paramilitary II (1993–1995)|the upper hand in its operations]] as a consequence of a change of tactics by Turkey and Syria's steady abandonment of support for the group. At the same time, the government started to use more violent methods to counter Kurdish militants. From 1996 to 1999, the PKK conducted hundreds of bomb attacks against military and police bases.&lt;ref name=pape-2005&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pape|first1=Robert|title=Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism|date=2005|publisher=Random House|isbn= 1588364607}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=alakoc-2007&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alakoc|first1=Burcu|title=The Motivations of Female Suicide Bombers from a Communication Perspective|date=2007|publisher=ProQuest|isbn= 0549422536 |page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_IcZUMS_Y2kC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;ots=tSF9eqeiM8&amp;sig=TsGIdgZDiXerelzKQp7XHgUdiLE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwB2oVChMI7ozy4b6LxwIVjJyICh2G_wHm#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, [[History of the Kurdistan Workers' Party#Paramilitary III (1996–1999)|Turkey increased the pressure]] and the [[History of the Kurdistan Workers' Party#The undeclared war|undeclared war between Turkey and Syria]] ended open Syrian support.&lt;ref name="antiwar"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.antiwar.com/ips/suri.php?articleid=5142 |title=Torture and Oppression of Kurds in Syria|publisher=antiwar.com|date=11 May 2005|last=Suri|first=Sanjay |authorlink=Sanjay Suri}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict (1978–present)|Kurdish–Turkish conflict]] was in its peak in the 90's. 1999, [[History of the Kurdistan Workers' Party#Capture of Öcalan (1999)|Öcalan was captured]], prosecuted and sentenced to death, but this was later commuted to life imprisonment as part of the government's seeking [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|European Union membership]].&lt;ref&gt;[[UNESCO]]. 2002.

As a result of Kurdish activism, the Turkish parliament began a controlled process of dismantling some anti-Kurdish legislation, using the term "normalization" or "rapprochement," depending on the sides of the issue.

On 2 April 2004, the [[Council of the European Union]] added the PKK to its list of terrorist organizations. Later that year, the [[United States Department of the Treasury|US Treasury]] moved to freeze assets of branches of the organization.

On 20 March 2016, the PKK announced that they will support the Peoples' United Revolutionary Movement which aim to attain "democracy and [a] free future" for "peoples against imperialism, capitalism, chauvinism, fascism and racism", by working towards the overthrow of the ruling [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]], who they deem [[Fascism|fascist]].

After the capture of Öcalan, authorities induced him to publicly plead for a ceasefire.&lt;ref&gt;Bongar, Bruce Michael.

The PKK had also completely moved to [[Qandil Mountains]] from [[Beqaa Valley]], under intensive pressure, after Syria expelled Öcalan and shut down all camps established in the region.&lt;ref name="Simon"/&gt; At the time, Northern Iraq was experiencing vacuum of control after [[Operation Provide Comfort]]. Instead of a single training camp which could be easily destroyed, the organization created many small camps. During this period the organization set up a fully functioning enclave with training camps, storage facilities, and reconnaissance and communications centers.

In 2007, the organization was believed to have camps strung out through the mountains that straddle the border between Turkey and Iraq, including in Sinaht, Haftanin, Kanimasi and Zap.&lt;ref name="gareth"/&gt; The organization developed two types of camps. The mountain camps, located in Turkey, Iraq and Iran, are used as forward bases from which militants carry out attacks against Turkish military bases. The units deployed there are highly mobile and the camps have only minimal infrastructure.&lt;ref name="gareth"/&gt; The other permanent camps, in the Qandil Mountains, have more developed infrastructure—including a field hospital, electricity generators and a large proportion of the PKK's lethal and non-lethal supplies.&lt;ref name="gareth"&gt;Jenkins, Gareth.{{cite web|url=http://www.jamestown.org/terrorism/news/article.php?articleid=2370250 |title=Turkey Weighs Military Options Against PKK Camps in Iraq|accessdate=2008-12-18|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107082810/http://www.jamestown.org/terrorism/news/article.php?articleid=2370250|archivedate=7 November 2007|df=dmy}}, ''Global Terrorism Analysis'', Volume 4, Issue 33 16 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is using Qandil mountain camps for its political activities.

===Political representation===
{{unreliable sources|date=November 2016}}
The organization had sympathizer parties in the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]] beginning in the early 1990s. The establishment of direct links to the organization has been a question. In sequence [[People's Labor Party|HEP]]/[[Democracy Party (Turkey)|DEP]]/[[People's Democracy Party|HADEP]]/[[Democratic People's Party (Turkey)|DEHAP]]/[[Democratic Society Party|DTP]] and the latest [[Peace and Democracy Party (Turkey)|Peace and Democracy Party]] (BDP), which later changed its name to [[Democratic Regions Party]] (DBP) on 11 July 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evrensel.net/haber/88097/bdpnin-adi-demokratik-bolgeler-partisi-oldu|title=BDP'nin adı Demokratik Bölgeler Partisi oldu|date=11 July 2014|publisher=[[Evrensel]]|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been accused of sympathizing with the PKK, since they have refused to brand it as a terrorist group.

Political organizations established in Turkey are banned from propagating or supporting separatism. Several political parties supporting Kurdish rights have been allegedly banned on this pretext. The constitutional court claimed to find direct links between the [[People's Labor Party|HEP]]/[[Democracy Party (Turkey)|DEP]]/[[People's Democracy Party|HADEP]] and the PKK. In 2008 the DTP-party was prosecuted by the constitutional court. It is reported that Turkey has used the PKK as an excuse to close Kurdish political parties.

[[Şamil Tayyar]], author and member of the ruling [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AK Party]], claimed that Öcalan was released in 1972 after just three months' detention on the initiative of the [[National Intelligence Organization (Turkey)|National Intelligence Organization]], and that his 1979 escape to Syria was aided by elements in MIT{{Expand acronym|date=June 2017}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Today's Zaman]], 18 October 2011, [http://todayszaman.com/news-260285-tayyars-new-book-reveals-pkks-ties-with-turkish-intelligence.html Tayyar’s new book reveals PKK’s ties with Turkish intelligence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019153652/http://www.todayszaman.com/news-260285-tayyars-new-book-reveals-pkks-ties-with-turkish-intelligence.html |date=19 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Öcalan has admitted making use of money given by the MIT to the PKK, which he says was provided as part of MIT efforts to control him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Today's Zaman]], 8 November 2008, [http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&amp;link=158166 Tenth hearing of Ergenekon trial held yesterday] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610203020/http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&amp;link=158166|date=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former police special forces member [[Ayhan Çarkın]] alleged that the state, using the clandestine [[Ergenekon (allegation)|Ergenekon network]], colluded with militant groups such as the PKK, [[Revolutionary People's Liberation Party/Front|Dev-Sol]] and [[Turkish Hezbollah]], with the goal of profiting from the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://arsiv.sabah.com.tr/2008/10/22/haber,3F335AA5F18446E4AB40F3A91AB3BB88.html|accessdate=8 January 2009|title=Çarkın'ın itiraflarına soruşturma|date=22 October 2008|first=Ecevit|last=Kilic|work=Sabah|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A witness to the trials testified that General [[Levent Ersöz]], former head of [[Gendarmerie Intelligence Organization|JITEM]], had frequent contact with PKK commander [[Cemîl Bayik]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Today's Zaman]], 22 August 2009, [http://www.todayszaman.com/news-184721-ersoz-and-pkks-bayik-kept-in-touch.html Ersöz and PKK's Bayık kept in touch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201214002/http://www.todayszaman.com/news-184721-ersoz-and-pkks-bayik-kept-in-touch.html|date=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to official figures, it was claimed that nearly 2000 PKK members became ''[[İtirafçı|itirafçı]]'' ("confessors") after their arrest. Some were persuaded or coerced to play an active role in the conflict, particularly under the direction of the [[Gendarmerie General Command|Turkish Gendarmerie]]'s unofficial [[Gendarmerie Intelligence Organization|JİTEM]] unit.

==Activities==
During its establishment in the mid-1970s, amid [[Political violence in Turkey (1976–80)|violent clashes country-wide]], the organization used classic violent methods, such as the alleged failed assassination of Mehmet Celal Bucak as a [[Propaganda of the deed|propaganda-of-the-deed]].&lt;ref name=joost/&gt; After the [[1980 Turkish coup d'état|1980 military coup]], the organization developed into a paramilitary organization using resources it acquired in Syria, Russia, Europe and [[Beqaa Valley]] in part of ex-Syrian-controlled Lebanon. After 1984, PKK began also to use [[Maoism|Maoist]] theory of [[people's war]].&lt;ref name=Radu2001&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.oranim.ac.il/courses/meast/extra/RISE%20AND%20FALL%20THE%20PKK.htm|doi=10.1016/S0030-4387(00)00057-0|author=Radu, Michael|journal=Orbis|volume=45|issue=1|pages=47–63|date=Winter 2001|title=The Rise and Fall of the PKK|accessdate=29 June 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708054622/http://www.oranim.ac.il/courses/meast/extra/RISE%20AND%20FALL%20THE%20PKK.htm|archivedate=8 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The militant base during the initial years was coming from different sources, so the first two phases were diffused to each other.

===Political activity 1978–1984===
In the first phase (1978–1984), the PKK tried to gain the support of the Kurdish population. It attacked the machinery of government and distributed propaganda in the region. PKK tactics were based on [[ambush]], [[sabotage]], riots, protests, and [[Demonstration (protest)|demonstrations]] against the Turkish government. During these years, the PKK also fought a turf war against other radical Islamist Kurdish and Turkish organisations in Turkey. Turkish newspapers claimed that the PKK effectively used the prison force to gain appeal among the population which PKK has denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[Zaman (newspaper)|Zaman]]|language=Turkish|url=http://www.zaman.com.tr/haber.do?haberno=620819|accessdate=9 July 2008|title=Eski Dışişleri Bakanı Hikmet Çetin: PKK'nın temeli 12 Eylül'de atıldı|date=3 December 2007|agency=[[Cihan News Agency]]|quote=PKK aslında nereden şiddetle çıktı.

During this time, the organization argued that its violent actions against the government forces were explained by the need to defend Kurds in the context of what it considered as the massive cultural suppression of Kurdish identity (including the 1983 Turkish Language Act Ban) and cultural rights carried out by other governments of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=McDowall|title=A Modern History of the Kurds|page=443|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkey also used violent and oppressive methods against its Kurdish citizens to stop them supporting the PKK.

===Armed rebellion 1984–1999===
In the second phase (1984–1999), which followed the return of civilian rule in 1983, escalating attacks were made on the government's military and vital institutions all over the country. The objective was to destabilise Turkish authority through a long, low-intensity confrontation. In addition to skirmishing with Turkish military and police forces and local [[Village guard system|village guards]], the PKK has conducted bomb attacks on government and police installations.&lt;ref&gt;Matovic, Violeta, ''Suicide Bombers Who's Next'', Belgrade, The National Counter Terrorism Committee, {{ISBN|978-86-908309-2-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kidnapping]] and assassination against government and military officials and Kurdish tribal leaders who were named as puppets of the state were performed as well. Widespread [[sabotage]]s were continued from the first stage. Turkish sources had also claimed that the PKK also carried out kidnappings of tourists, primarily in [[Istanbul]] but also at different resorts. However, the PKK had in its history arrested 4 tourists and released them all after warning them to not enter the war zone. The vast majority of PKK's actions have taken place mainly in Turkey against the Turkish military, although it has on occasions co-operated with other Kurdish nationalist paramilitary groups in neighboring states, such as Iraq and Iran.&lt;ref name=Cordesman1999&gt;{{Cite book|author=Cordesman, Anthony H.|year=1999|title=Iraq and the War of Sanctions: Conventional Threats and Weapons of Mass Destruction|isbn=0-275-96528-7|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|postscript=&lt;!--Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary.--&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PKK has also attacked Turkish diplomatic and commercial facilities across Western Europe in the late 80's. In effect, the Turkish state has led a series of [[counter-insurgency]] operations against the PKK, accompanied by political measures, starting with an explicit denunciation of separatism in the [[Constitution of Turkey|1982 Constitution]], and including proclamation of the [[state of emergency]] in various PKK-controlled territories starting in 1983 (when the military relinquished political control to the civilians). This series of administrative reforms against terrorism included in 1985 the creation of [[village guard system]] by the then prime minister [[Turgut Özal]]. Turkey involved in serious human rights violations during the 90's. The ECHR has condemned Turkey for executions of Kurdish civilians, torturing, forced displacements and massive arrests.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, in an effort to win increased support from the Kurdish peasantry, the PKK altered its leftist secular ideology to better accommodate and accept Islamic beliefs. The group also abandoned its previous strategy of attacking Kurdish and Turkish civilians who were against them, focusing instead on government and military targets.&lt;ref name="miptpkkmain"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=63|work=[[MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base]]|title=Group Profile: Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK)|accessdate=17 April 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109074852/http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=63|archivedate=9 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its campaign, the organization has been accused of carrying out atrocities against both Turkish and Kurdish civilians and its actions have been criticised by human rights groups such as [[Amnesty International]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No Security Without Human Rights|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6a9ea0.html|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Human Rights Watch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turkey and War in Iraq: Avoiding Past Patterns of Violation|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/backgrounder/eca/turkey/turkey_violations.htm|website=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}. Similar actions of the Turkish state have also been criticized by these same groups.

===Cease fire 1999–2004===
The third phase (1999–2012), after the capture of Öcalan, PKK reorganized itself and new leaders were chosen by its members. The PKK wasn't active between 2000 and 2003. The organization made radical changes to survive, such as changing ideology and setting new goals. At the same time, the PKK continued to recruit new members and sustain its fighting force.

According to Turkish sources, in April 2002 at its 8th Party Congress, the PKK changed its name to the ''Kurdistan Freedom and Democracy Congress (KADEK)'' and proclaimed a commitment to nonviolent activities in support of Kurdish rights. A PKK/KADEK spokesman stated that its armed wing, The People's Defense Force, would not disband or surrender its weapons for reasons of self-defense, however. This statement by the PKK/KADEK avowing it would not lay down its arms underscores that the organization maintained its capability to carry out armed operations. PKK/KADEK established a new ruling council in April, its membership virtually identical to the PKK's Presidential Council. The PKK/KADEK did not conduct an armed attack in 2002; however, the group periodically issued veiled threats that it will resume violence if the conditions of its imprisoned leader are not improved and its forces are attacked by Turkish military, and it continued its military training like before.

In November 2003, another congress was held which lead to renaming itself as the ''People's Congress of Kurdistan'' or ''Kongra-Gel (KGK)''. The stated purpose of the organizational change was to leave behind nationalistic and state-building goals, in favor of creating a political structure to work within the existing nation-states.&lt;ref name="PKK in the 2000s p149"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Akkaya|first1=Ahmet Hamdi|last2=Jongerden|first2=Joost|editor1-last=Casier|editor1-first=Marlies|editor2-last=Jongerden|editor2-first=Joost|title=Nationalisms and Politics in Turkey: Political Islam, Kemalism and the Kurdish Issue|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136938672|page=149|chapter=The PKK in the 2000s: Continuity through Breaks?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through further internal conflict during this period, it is claimed that 1500 militants left the organization,&lt;ref name="PKK in the 2000s p149"/&gt; along with many of the leading reformists, including [[Nizamettin Taş]] and [[Abdullah Öcalan]]'s younger brother [[Osman Öcalan]]&lt;ref name="Cemil Bayik"&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=4938 Leading PKK Commander Cemil Bayik Crosses into Iran], 20 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second insurgency 2004–2012===
Kongra-Gel called off the cease-fire at the start of June 2004, saying Turkish security forces had refused to respect the truce. Turkish security forces were increasingly involved in clashes with Kurdish separatist fighters. Ankara claimed that about 2,000 Kurdish fighters had crossed into Turkey from hideouts in mountainous northern Iraq in early June 2004.

While the fight against the Turkish security forces between 2004 and 2010 continued, the PKK and its ancillary organizations continued to enjoy substantial support among the Kurds of Turkey. In 2005, the original name of the organization ''PKK'' was restored. Turkey's struggle against the Kongra-Gel/PKK was marked by increased clashes across Turkey in 2005. In the Southeast, Turkish security forces were active in the struggle against the Kongra-Gel/PKK. There were bombings and attempted bombings in resort areas in western Turkey and Istanbul, some of which resulted in civilian casualties. A radical Kurdish separatist group calling itself the [[Kurdistan Freedom Hawks|Kurdish Freedom Hawks (TAK)]] claimed responsibility for many of these attacks. The TAK is a rival to PKK that since 2006 repeatedly damaged the PKK's efforts to negotiate cease-fires and unlike the PKK, is seeking to establish independent Kurdistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brandon|first1= James|title=The Kurdistan Freedom Falcons Emerges as a Rival to the PKK|url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=936#.Vuqn8-LhDn4|website=The Jamestown foundation|publisher=The Jamestown foundation|accessdate= 17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 alone, the PKK claimed over 500 victims. In October 2006, the PKK allegedly declared a unilateral cease-fire that slowed the intensity and pace of its attacks, but attacks continued in response to Turkish security forces significant counterinsurgency operations, especially in the southeast. On 21 October 2011 Iranian foreign minister [[Ali Akbar Salehi]] announced Iran would co-operate with Turkey in some military operations against the PKK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/europe/Turkey-Iran-to-Cooperate-Against-Kurdish-Rebels-132316303.html|title=Turkey, Iran to Cooperate Against Kurdish Rebels|publisher=Voice of America|accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2012 was the most violent year in the armed conflict between the Turkish State and PKK since 1999. At least 541 individuals lost their lives as a result of the clashes including 316 militants and 282 soldiers. In contrast, 152 individuals lost their lives in 2009 until the Turkish government initiated negotiations with the PKK leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Güneş Murat Tezcür,"[http://www.luc.edu/faculty/gtezcur/files/TezcurInsightTurkey.pdf Prospects for Resolution of the Kurdish Question: A Realist Perspective,] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016083217/http://www.luc.edu/faculty/gtezcur/files/TezcurInsightTurkey.pdf |date= 16 October 2013 }}" Insight Turkey 15 (Spring 2013): 69–84.&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of this negotiations contributed to violence that were particularly intensified in 2012. The PKK encouraged by the rising power of the Syrian Kurds increased its attacks in the same year.

During the [[Syrian Civil War]], the Kurds in Syria have established control over their own region with the help of the Turkish Kurdistan Workers' Party as well as with support from the Kurdistan Regional Government in [[Erbil]], under President [[Masoud Barzani]].&lt;ref name=Kurd-Shiite-Sunni-Split&gt;{{cite web|last=Salem|first=Paul|title=INSIGHT: Iraq’s Tensions Heightened by Syria Conflict|url=http://middleeastvoices.voanews.com/2012/11/insight-iraqs-tensions-heightened-by-syria-conflict-96791/|publisher=Middle East Voices|accessdate=3 November 2012|date=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The withdrawal began as planned with groups of fighters crossing the border from southeastern Turkey to northern Iraq.&lt;ref name=Peace/&gt; Iraqi leadership in Baghdad, however, declared that it would not accept armed groups into its territory. "The Iraqi government welcomes any political and peaceful settlement", read an official statement.

A number of Turkish Kurds rallied in large-scale street protests, demanding that the government in Ankara take more forceful action to combat IS and to enable Kurdish militants already engaged against IS to more freely move and resupply.

The Firat news agency, which Al Jazeera describes as "close to the PKK", claimed that Turkish forces had been shelling the PKK positions for days beforehand and that the PKK action had itself been retaliation for those artillery strikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/10/turkish-jets-bomb-pkk-targets-southeast-2014101492853176434.html|title=Turkey bombs Kurdish PKK targets in south|date=14 October 2014|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PKK had already reported several Turkish attacks against their troops months before Turkish bombing started.

In the months before the parliamentary election of 2015, as the "Kurdish-focused" HDP's likelihood of crossing the 10% threshold for entry into the government seemed more likely, Erdogan gave speeches and made comments that repudiated the settlement process and the existence of a Kurdish problem and refusing to recognize the HDP as having any role to play despite their long participation as intermediaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/05/turkey-kurds-pkk-no-farewell-to-arms.html|title=Will Erdogan's backtracking torpedo PKK disarmament? - Al-Monitor: the Pulse of the Middle East|work=Al-Monitor|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303085346/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/05/turkey-kurds-pkk-no-farewell-to-arms.html|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These announcements increased distrust of the government's good faith among Kurdish leaders.

==Tactics==
The areas in which the group operates are generally mountainous rural areas and dense urban areas. The mountainous terrain offers an advantage to members of the PKK by allowing them to hide in a network of caves.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

===Recruiting===
[[File:PKK female figher̠02.jpg|thumb|230px|PKK female fighters]]
The PKK's ideology supports equality of gender. At its establishment, it included a small number of female fighters. Over time, however, this number has increased significantly and by the early 1990s, 30 percent of its 17,000 armed fighting forces were women.&lt;ref name="gender"&gt;Ali Özcan, Nihat{{cite web|url=http://jamestown.org/terrorism/news/article.php?articleid=2373638|title=PKK Recruitment of Female Operatives|accessdate=2010-08-23|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915044101/http://jamestown.org/terrorism/news/article.php?articleid=2373638|archivedate=15 September 2007|df=dmy}}, ''Global Terrorism Analysis'', [[Jamestown Foundation]], Volume 4, Issue 28, 11 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In much of rural Turkey, male-dominated tribal structures, and conservative [[Muslim]] norms are commonplace. The organization increased its number of members through the recruitment of women from different social structures and environments, such as women from families that migrated to several European countries after [[Foreign worker|1960 as guest workers]].&lt;ref name="gender"/&gt; It was reported by a Turkish university that 88% of the subjects initially believed that equality was a key objective, and that they were lured into the organization based on this claim.&lt;ref name="Hurriyet DeceivedChild"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/6673759.asp?gid=180|title=Hepsi kandırılmış çocuklar|language=Turkish|work=[[Hürriyet Daily News]]|publisher=[[Ankara University|University of Ankara]]|accessdate=9 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, approximately 1,100 of 4,500–5,000 total members were women.&lt;ref name="gender"/&gt;

PKK's involvement in drug trafficking has been documented since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Glenn E.

The British [[National Criminal Intelligence Service]] determined that the PKK obtained $75 million from drug smuggling in Europe in 1993 alone.&lt;ref name="pkkdrug"&gt;{{cite web|title=Drug trafficking &gt; Drug trafficking and PKK|url=https://fas.org/irp/world/para/docs/studies5.htm|accessdate=10 July 2008|publisher=INTERPOL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the PKK have been designated narcotics traffickers by the U.S. Department of the Treasury.&lt;ref name="Narcotics2"/&gt; However, The [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]], Germany's domestic security agency, echoed this finding in its 2011 [[Annual Report on the Protection of the Constitution]], stating that despite the U.S Department of Treasury designation, there was "no evidence that the organisational structures of the PKK are directly involved in drug trafficking".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verfassungsschutz.de/de/oeffentlichkeitsarbeit/publikationen/verfassungsschutzberichte/vsbericht-2011|title=Verfassungsschutzbericht 2011|last=Friedrich|first=Hans-Peter|author2=Heinz Fromm|date=18 July 2012|publisher=Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz|page=342|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 October 2009, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]] (OFAC) targeted the senior leadership of the PKK, designating Murat Karayılan, the head of the PKK, and high-ranking members Ali Riza Altun and [[Zübeyir Aydar]] as foreign narcotics traffickers at the request of Turkey.&lt;ref name="Narcotics2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/tg318.aspx|author=Press Center|work=[[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Department of the Treasury]]|title=Treasury Designates Three Leaders of the Kongra-Gel as Significant Foreign Narcotics Traffickers|date=14 October 2009|accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 April 2011, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced the designation of PKK founders [[Cemîl Bayik]] and [[Duran Kalkan]] and other high-ranking members as Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers (SDNT) pursuant to the [[Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act]] (Kingpin Act).

According to research conducted by journalist Aliza Marcus, the PKK accepted the support of smugglers in the region. Aliza Marcus claimed that some of those Kurdish smuggler who involved in the drugs trade, either because they truly believed in the PKK—or because they thought it a good business practice(avoid conflicts)—frequently donated money to the PKK rebels. She also claimed that there were reports of PKK supporters in Europe who used their positions and contacts to trade in drugs—and then handed some of the profits to the PKK. And when PKK activists needed more money, they had no qualms about approaching Kurds who trafficked in narcotics. However, according to Aliza Marcus, it does not seem that the PKK, as an organization, directly produced or traded in narcotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marcus|first=Aliza|title=Blood and belief: the PKK and the Kurdish fight for independence|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|date=August 2007|pages=183–184|isbn=0814757111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Land Reform in Developing Countries: Property Rights and Property Wrongs''''' is a 2009 book by the [[Wassily Leontief Prize#Leontief Prize|Leontief Prize]]–winning economist [[Michael Lipton]]. It is a comprehensive review of [[land reform]] issues in [[developing countries]] and focuses on the evidence of which land reforms have worked and which have not.

==Summary of the book==

The introduction defines land reform as comprising "laws with the main goal of reducing poverty by substantially increasing the proportion of farmland controlled by the poor, and thereby their income, power or status"&lt;ref name="first"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lipton|first=Michael|title=Land Reform in Developing Countries: property rights and property wrongs|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-09667-6|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;(the appendix gives a more precise definition). It then expands on what is meant by poverty and how land reform still "matters", especially as according to Lipton "land is poor people's main productive asset"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lipton|first=Michael|title=Land Reform in Developing Countries: property rights and property wrongs|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-09667-6|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "at least 1.5 billion people today have some farmland as a result of land reform, and are less poor, or not poor, as a result."&lt;ref name ="page8"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lipton|first=Michael|title=Land Reform in Developing Countries: property rights and property wrongs|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-09667-6|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for Lipton, "huge, inefficient land inequalities remain, or have re-emerged, in many low-income countries. Land reform remains both 'unfinished business' (...) and alive and well."&lt;ref name="page8" /&gt;

Chapter 1 analyses the goals of stakeholders involved in land reform: public authorities, landowners, farmers and other directly affected persons as well as the goals for land reform advocated by outsiders, from aid donors to economists and philosophers. Land reform normally advances one widely shared goal, equality of opportunity, but it can retard another, liberty to enjoy 'legitimate' [[property rights]]. This chapter looks at the trade-offs and how various types of claimed land reform affect these goals and others, notably [[poverty reduction]], [[sustainability]], [[economic efficiency]] and [[economic growth]].

Chapter 2 explores the impact of land reform and land policy on farm and non-farm growth and efficiency. It looks at the long debate on whether "there is an inverse relationship (IR) in labour-abundant countries", such that "small farms produce more, per hectare per year, than large farms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lipton|first=Michael|title=Land Reform in Developing Countries: property rights and property wrongs|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-09667-6|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lipton concludes that careful and recent work in Africa and elsewhere confirms that, "mainly due to the IR plus land scarcity, redistributive land reform in developing countries normally increases farm output."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lipton|first=Michael|title=Land Reform in Developing Countries: property rights and property wrongs|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-09667-6|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapters 3-6 reviews the experience with different types of policies, variously labelled as land reform. They ask: are these genuine land reforms in the sense of seeking, and moving towards, "farmland-based reduction of gross, unearned [[economic inequality|inequality]] and hence of [[poverty]]"? These main types of land reform are:

* the paradigm: 'classic' land reform, leading to land transfers from big to small farms (chapter 3)
* laws to stop, restrict, register, enable or encourage [[tenancy]], overall or for particular types (chapter 4)
* other tenurial rules, for example titling of land ownership or control (chapter 4)
* [[collectivisation]] into [[State (polity)|State]] farming, [[collective farming]] or [[co-operative farming]], which according to Lipton have normally proved a 'terrible detour' or 'land deform' (chapter 5)
* decollectivisation (which may be land reform if resulting land ownership is fairly equal) (chapter 5)
* other alleged paths to the aims of land reform: [[land consolidation]], settlement, [[tax reform]], etc. (chapter 6)
* new wave (decentralised, market-friendly and/or non-confiscatory) land reform (chapter 6)

Chapter 7 reviews the persistent allegation that land reform is dead, or was so effectively avoided that it never lived. Lipton asks the questions: Where has it happened on the ground, how much and when? He also asks: Is land reform still happening and where it is not dead, ought it to be? Lipton concludes: "In many developing countries, land reform is a live, often burning, issue ... The debate about land reform is alive and well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lipton|first=Michael|title=Land Reform in Developing Countries: property rights and property wrongs|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-09667-6|page=322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

The book overall received positive reviews and endorsements (see below). However, Andrew Dorward did have some "minor gripes"&lt;ref name="Dorward"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dorward|first=Andrew|title=Land Reform in Developing Countries: Property Rights and Property Wrongs - a review|journal=Journal of Agricultural Economics|year=2012|volume=2|pages=484–486|url=http://michaellipton.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/pages-from-dorward-lipton-book-review-jage_342-2.pdf|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; within his very positive review. He wished that it did not finish so abruptly and that it had a final chapter "summing up the main lessons from the book for the next generation of researchers, analysts and practitioners in the field."&lt;ref name="Dorward" /&gt; He would also have liked to have seen "more explicit attention to interactions of land reform with gender and the environment."&lt;ref name="Dorward" /&gt;

Abhijit Sen, while giving it an overall positive review, found that:

{{quote|"To put it very bluntly, even after reading and re-reading, the final big picture may remain somewhat hazy to a reader seeking full clarity on matters involved. But this is perhaps what Lipton the economist really wants: to show that deep issues are involved, that many are currently being debated, and that the debate will continue."&lt;ref name="Sen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sen|first=Abhijit|title=Unfinished Tasks of Land Reform|journal=Review of Agrarian Studies|year=2013|volume=3|issue=1|url=http://www.ras.org.in/unfinished_tasks_of_land_reform|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He also finished his review with some further critiques, especially in relation to land reform in India:

{{quote|"Indian readers will find much information in the book about other countries that is not usually available, and a flavour of issues still current elsewhere. On the Indian situation, however, there is no clarion call in this book. If anything, there are references to the Planning Commission, and a sense that there is not much land left in really large holdings and that the way forward may only involve a guarantee to the poor of homestead land with at least garden plots. The book does not deal specifically with tribal land issues in India or the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, which is the most recent land reform measure. And, although mentioned, rural resistance to the acquisition of agricultural land for non-agricultural purposes is not a part of its discourse. The definition of land reform that Lipton uses limits him to considering only the distribution of farmland and does not extend to the conversion of land use from sown area to another category. Lipton does not reveal his mind about the new accumulation of land that is occurring across the world. This is a pity, because much of what is presently happening in China, India, and even other parts of the world including Africa, cannot really be understood without extending the canvas of land issues beyond the farm itself."&lt;ref name="Sen" /&gt;}}

==Endorsements==
The book received positive endorsements from a wide range of authors, including [[Jeffrey Sachs]], [[Nicholas Stern]], [[Amartya Sen]], [[Gordon Conway]], [[Nancy Birdsall]], [[Paul Collier]], Akin Adesina and Pramod K. Mishra.&lt;ref name="endorsement"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lipton|first=Michael|title=Land Reform in Developing Countries: contents, reviews, how to get it|url=http://michaellipton.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/land-reform-book-ml.doc|work=From Michael Lipton's personal website|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
{{quotation|This is, to put it conservatively, an important book. It is the first comprehensive and up to date review of land reform issues in the developing countries in many years. In my opinion, it is one of the most important books ever written about agriculture in the developing countries. This conclusion is based in part on the book’s impressive breadth of coverage and depth of analysis, in part on its timeliness, in part on the centrality of land reform issues to poverty and inequality reduction (and more generally to societal health in many countries), and in part on the urgent current need for very strong ammunition in the battle with the opponents of such reform.|Albert Berry| Development and Change&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berry|first=Albert|title=Review Essay: The Case for Redistributional Land Reform in Developing Countries|journal=Development and Change|year=2011|volume=42|issue=2|pages=637–648|url=http://michaellipton.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/thecaseforredistributionalreview2011.pdf|accessdate=11 June 2013|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7660.2011.01699.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quotation|The study of land reform has been an enduring theme in Michael Lipton's long distinguished career. ''Land Reform in Developing Countries: Property Rights and Property Wrongs'' is a comprehensive, scholarly and passionate collation of his years of research and policy analysis on this issue. A packed, tightly argued and a very comprehensive review of empirical literature in a wide and heavily research field, it is an essential read for anyone concerned with the history and implementation of land reform - a topic of continuing importance and interest.|Andrew Dorward| Journal of Agricultural Economics&lt;ref name="Dorward" /&gt;}}

{{quotation|Michael Lipton has produced a unique work drawing upon the author’s extraordinary expertise in rural development.  Lipton takes on a great, complex, and contentious topic, land reform, and does justice to this huge topic.  He delves deeply and widely, producing a text that is remarkable in its scope, insights, and historical knowledge.  He never fears to point out the true complexities of topics that are all too often over-simplified.  Lipton’s work is also extremely timely, as the world turns its attention once again to smallholder agriculture after decades or relative neglect.  Scholars, students, and policy makers in all parts of the world will turn to this new study with enormous benefit and with gratitude to Lipton for his remarkable efforts. |[[Jeffrey Sachs]]|Endorsement in the book&lt;ref name="endorsement" /&gt;}}

In May 2012,  31-year-old Marissa Alexander was prosecuted for [[Assault|aggravated assault]] with a lethal weapon and received a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in prison. Alexander said that she fired a warning shot after her husband attacked her and threatened to kill her on August 1, 2010, in [[Jacksonville, Florida]].

Alexander was released on January 27, 2015, under a plea deal that capped her sentence to the three years she had already served. 

==Incident==
Alexander was in the home of her estranged husband Rico Gray, when Alexander stated that Gray threatened to kill her&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=MCJ Staff|title=Marissa Alexander Faces Triple Sentence In Retrial Of ‘Warning Shot’ Case|url=http://communityjournal.net/marissa-alexander-faces-triple-sentence-in-retrial-of-warning-shot-case/}}&lt;/ref&gt; via texts on Alexander's phone. Gray had previously abused Alexander, giving her reason to believe that her life was in danger.&lt;ref name=Stacy&gt;{{cite web|last=Stacy|first=Mitchy|title=Marissa Alexander Gets 20 Years for Firing Warning Shot|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fla-woman-marissa-alexander-gets-20-years-for-warning-shot-did-she-stand-her-ground/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Alexander&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alexander|first1=Marissa|title=In The State Of Florida - Marissa Faces 20 Years In Prison|url=http://www.justiceformarissa.blogspot.com/2012/04/lincoln-b.html|website=Stand Your Ground Marissa Alexander|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Powers&gt;{{cite web|last1=Powers|first1=Kirsten|title=Prosecuted for Standing Her Ground|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/07/19/angela-corey-s-overzealous-prosecution-of-marissa-alexander.html|website=The Daily Beast|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Salzillo&gt;{{cite web|last1=Salzillo|first1=Leslie|title=5 More Women Accuse Marissa Alexander's Abusive Husband Of Brutal Abuse|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/10/17/1337149/-5-More-Women-Accuse-Marissa-Alexander-s-Abusive-Husband-Of-Extreme-Brutality|website=The Daily Kos|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Alexander, she tried to escape through the garage, but the garage door would not open.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt; This account was confirmed by Gray in a sworn deposition,&lt;ref name=Powers/&gt; although investigators found no problem with the door.  According to all accounts, Alexander then retrieved her gun from her vehicle and went to the kitchen. Alexander fired a "warning shot" towards Gray with his children nearby, which hit the wall near Gray at the height of his head, then deflected into the ceiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thegrio.com/2012/05/15/angela-corey-lashes-out-at-critics-of-marissa-alexander-prosecution/#s:angela-corey-4x3-jpg|title=Angela Corey lashes out at critics of Marissa Alexander prosecution|work=theGrio|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kateel&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kateel|first1=Subhash|title=4 Lies, Distortions and Inaccuracies made in the Marissa Alexander case|url=http://www.letstalkaboutit.info/2012/05/4-lies-distortions-and-inaccuracies_19.html|website=Let's Talk About It|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single shot did not injure anyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegrio.com/specials/trayvon-martin/angela-corey-lashes-out-at-critics-of-marissa-alexander-prosecution.php|title=Angela Corey lashes out at critics of Marissa Alexander prosecution|publisher=Thegrio.com|accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one source, Alexander had fired the warning shot because of Florida's [[stand-your-ground law]], a law that allows self-defense, such as lethal force, in life-threatening situations, but a warning shot was not legal at that time.

==Trials==
Alexander, who had no previous criminal record or arrests, sought self-defense immunity prior to trial but was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=Powers /&gt; State Attorney [[Angela Corey]] met with the defendant and offered her a three-year plea deal.  Asserting that she acted in self-defense within the bounds of the law, Alexander rejected the offer and took her case to trial.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt; A jury convicted her in twelve minutes,&lt;ref name="hlnstaff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hlntv.com/article/2013/07/19/marissa-alexander-florida-10-20-life-laws|title=Marissa Alexander: The REAL reason she's behind bars|author=HLN Staff|work=HLNtv.com|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because of the [[10-20-Life|Florida 10-20-Life mandatory minimum statute]], she was sentenced to 20 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/19/marissa-alexander-gets-20_n_1530035.html |date=2012-05-11 |title=Marissa Alexander Gets 20 Years For Firing Warning Shot |deadurl=no |accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander was also requested to stay away from Gray as part of a court order.&lt;ref name="hlnstaff"/&gt;

On September 26, 2013, an appellate court ordered a new trial, finding that the jury instructions in Alexander's trial impermissibly shifted the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] from the prosecution to the defense.&lt;ref&gt;http://media.graytvinc.com/documents/marissa+alexander+DCA+ruling.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Irin Carmon |url=http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/09/26/marissa-alexander-will-get-a-new-trial/ |title=Marissa Alexander will get a new trial &amp;#124; MSNBC |publisher=Tv.msnbc.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander was released on bail on November 27, 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Morgan Whitaker |url=http://www.msnbc.com/politicsnation/marissa-alexander-released-jail |title=Marissa Alexander released from jail for Thanksgiving |publisher=MSNBC |date=2013-07-23 |accessdate=2014-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and required to stay under [[house arrest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/10/22255312-florida-woman-given-20-years-for-firing-warning-shot-wont-return-to-jail-ahead-of-new-trial |title=Florida woman given 20 years for firing warning shot won't return to jail ahead of new trial |publisher=Usnews.nbcnews.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corey announced that she intended to re-prosecute Alexander, this time aiming for three consecutive 20 year sentences, amounting to a mandatory 60-year sentence if Alexander is found guilty in a second trial.&lt;ref name=Hannan60&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hannan|first1=Larry|title=Marissa Alexander's sentence could triple in 'warning-shot' case|url=http://members.jacksonville.com/news/crime/2014-03-01/story/marissa-alexander-sentence-could-triple-warning-shot-case|website=The Florida Times Union|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 27, 2015, Alexander was released from a Jacksonville jail under a plea deal that capped her sentence to the three years she had already served. She pleaded guilty to three counts of aggravated assault for firing a shot in the direction of her husband. She also agreed to serve two years of house arrest, wearing an ankle monitor. She will be allowed to work, attend classes and take her children to school and medical appointments. Her case helped to inspire a new state law permitting warning shots in some circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/27/us-usa-florida-selfdefense-idUSKBN0L02NQ20150127|title=Florida woman in 'warning shot' case released from jail|author=Susan Cooper Eastman|date=27 January 2015|work=Reuters|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of prosecutor Angela Corey==
Corey was criticized for her handling of the case by Democratic Florida Congresswoman [[Corrine Brown]], who argued that Corey overcharged Alexander and the result of Alexander's case was a consequence of institutional racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=20-year sentence for firing shot sparks outrage|url=http://www.news4jax.com/news/20-year-sentence-for-firing-shot-sparks-outrage/-/475880/13071700/-/131vu9cz/-/index.html|publisher=News4Jax}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rev.

Corey has defended herself by saying that she believes Alexander fired the weapon out of anger and not fear, and that she endangered the lives of Gray's two children in the process. Corey said, "She discharged a gun to kill them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dahl|first=Julia|title=Fla. woman Marissa Alexander gets 20 years for "warning shot": Did she stand her ground?|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fla-woman-marissa-alexander-gets-20-years-for-warning-shot-did-she-stand-her-ground/|accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Perth leadership outcome model''' is a [[leadership model]] that aims to characterize leaders by the financial outcome of their leadership, as distinct from the two traditional leadership models of focusing on either the leader's personality or behavioral skills and business competencies. It was developed by [[E. Ted Prince]] over the period 2002-6.

== Traditional approaches ==

The traditional leadership models are based on either a personality or a behavioral/competency approach (Bass, 1990). The personality approach is rooted in the "[[Great Man]]" theories popular in the early 20th century. Research in this tradition sought to identify the personal qualities that distinguished leaders from followers or effective leaders from ineffective leaders. This tradition is operationalized in the modern era by the plethora of personality tools used in leadership research and practice. Popular examples include the [[Myers Briggs Type Indicator]] (MBTI), the Fundamental Interpersonal Relations Orientations-Behavior(FIRO-B), and assessment tools based on the Five-Factor Model of personality like the [[NEO PI-R]] or Hogan Personality Inventory (HPI). These personality measures are based on a standard psychological paradigm and were designed to show the level of interpersonal and social functioning of an individual. These instruments were designed by psychologists and were not primarily designed to be business leadership assessments—the business application only gained traction in later years. (An exception is the Hogan Leadership Forecast tools, which were designed to predict psychological functioning in the workplace).

The behavioral/competency approaches, by contrast, were designed specifically for use in business. They are focused on individual managerial competencies such as vision, execution, and perseverance. They usually measure from 60 to over 100 individual competencies. Their intellectual heritage is the intersection of vocational guidance—which aims to show how individuals will perform in a particular job function—and a political backlash to intelligence/ability testing—following former Harvard president and entrepreneur, [[David McClelland]]'s classic article, "Testing for competence rather than intelligence." Neither of these arenas—guidance counseling, downplaying IQ—were intended for application with senior leaders, although the use of competency models has been extended to this area. Examples include the [[competency model]]s offered by [[Lominger]][http://www.lominger.com/], Hay-McBehr, Personnel Decisions International [http://www.personneldecisions.com/], and so on, etc.

== Concepts ==
=== Financial outcome ===

The Perth Leadership Outcome Model differs from these in that it focuses on what types of business outcome are associated with particular types of individuals and leaders. The model defines “outcome” in strictly financial terms.   It links an individual’s inclinations with the type of financial objectives they are likely to pursue and in particular, the type of financial value and valuation outcome most will to occur as a result of their leadership.

This model therefore differs significantly from the traditional models in that it focuses specifically on the financial outcomes of individuals and organizations. The traditional personality and competency models do not have a specific goal of explaining a leader or organization's financial performance, as does the Perth leadership outcome model.

=== Financial Signature ===

The Perth leadership outcome model (PLOM) identifies the concept of the financial traits of an individual, which it calls their “financial signature”. The financial signature describes an innate calculus, possessed by all individuals, that drives their behavior when they make judgments about situations involving risk and reward, cost and benefit. Each individual has a characteristic way of handling such situations. This particular way imposes a systematic but unconscious bias on all decisions which have financial impacts and ramifications. Knowing this the model predicts the types of financial decisions they make and therefore the financial impacts of their decision-making. From this it can predict their impact on financial performance, [[Profit (economics)|profitability]] and ultimately the financial value and market [[Valuation (finance)|valuation]] of organizations they run. This analysis can be extended to the team and the organizational levels.

=== Financial mission ===

The PLOM states that individuals cannot change their financial signature because it is innate, or at the very least fixed for long periods of time. However they can change their financial mission, that is how they express their financial traits in their actual behavior. The extent to which an individual can change their financial mission compared with their financial signature varies significantly between individuals. Most will be able to change somewhat, while only a few will be able to make dramatic change. However if a critical mass of leaders in an organization change their financial mission even by a small amount, the organization may also change its financial performance and its market value.

=== Outcome assessments ===

The financial signature of an individual can be identified and measured using assessment instruments designed by the Perth Leadership Institute including the [[financial outcome assessment]]. Other instruments show how a person can improve their financial mission and their leadership outcome (the [[executive outcome assessment]]) and the financial signature and mission of an organization (the [[corporate financial outcome assessment]]).

=== Behavioral finance ===

PLOM represents a new approach in the areas of [[behavioral finance]] and [[behavioral economics]]. These two fields and their foundational assumption of economic irrationality are focused mainly on consumers, although the more recent approaches have extended this assumption to a limited class of executives involved in making investment decisions for their corporations. However the PLOM approach is focused mainly on the extension of this assumption of irrationality to all corporate executives and managers, even those who do not have corporate responsibility for financial decision-making.

== Historical development ==

The PLOM model is unique in many ways. However, it is related to two intellectual precursors. The work by the great German sociologist, [[Max Weber]], linked social and economic variables. This is reflected particularly in his seminal work “[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]”. However Weber did not go further to link behavior with economic outcomes at the corporate, as distinct from the social, level.

The other precursor is, again, the Harvard psychologist David McClelland. His work in the 1950s linked entrepreneurial behavior with the emergence of capitalist society. His work, “The Achieving Society,” identifies these links in societies from the Greek era to the present. However, although prescient, his work still did not model the structure of entrepreneurial and financial behavior at the level of the individual and does not show its relevance to corporate financial outcomes, again analyzing at the social, not the corporate, level. Although influential in its day, McClelland’s approach has not been extended and it has only been with the emergence of behavioral finance and economics that interest in this area has been revived. The PLOM research reflects this interest.

The use of flags from the [[German Third Reich]] (1933–1945) is currently subject to legal restrictions in a number of countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Banned flags of Nazi inspiration |url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/qt-z_ban.html#de |date=2001-01-12 |work=[[Flags of the World]] |publisher=FOTW.net |accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=§ 86a  Verwenden von Kennzeichen verfassungswidriger Organisationen |url=http://www.lawww.de/Library/stgb/86a.htm |date=1999-01-01 |work=Allgemeiner Teil |publisher=Lawww.de |accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst legal in the overwhelming majority of countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Display of Nazi flag in the Four Seasons Arena |url=http://www.greatfallsmt.net/people_offices/city_attorney/opinions/nazi.php |date=1996-05-28 |work=City Attorney’s Office |publisher=City of Great Falls, Montana |accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mrflag.com/index.php?doc=94&amp;rev=94 |title=Ordering Nazi Flags |publisher=MrFlag.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; in several European countries the display of flags associated with the [[Nazi]] government (see: [[Nazi flag]]s) is subject to restriction or an outright ban.

Many Nazi flags make use of ''Hakenkreuz'', or [[swastika]] symbols;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Third Reich 1933-1945 (Germany) |url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/de193345.html |date=2006-08-19  |work=[[Flags of the World]] |publisher=FOTW.net |accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the swastika is not always used in connection with the [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]] movement or of the German Third Reich or [[Wehrmacht|the combined German military]] of 1933–1945. Outside of Nazism, use of swastikas pre-dates the German Third Reich by some 3,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The History of the Swastika |url=http://history1900s.about.com/cs/swastika/a/swastikahistory.htm |work=20th Century History |publisher=About.com |accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Symbol 15:1 |url=http://www.symbols.com/encyclopedia/15/151.html |work=Online Encyclopedia of Western Signs and Ideograms |publisher=Symbols.com |accessdate=2009-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621033916/http://www.symbols.com/encyclopedia/15/151.html |archivedate=2009-06-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to display certain non-Nazi swastikas even in areas where Nazi ''hakenkreuz'' swastikas are prohibited.

== Austria ==
[[Austria]] strictly prohibits the public display and/or proliferation of all insignia/symbols, emblems, uniforms (full or partial), flags, etc., clearly associated with the National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP, commonly known as the Nazi Party). There are legal exceptions for works of art (including books, films, theatre performances, computer games, and educational/memorial public exhibitions, etc.), these however do not apply if the respective work promotes National Socialism (as this is generally prohibited in Austria). The law has been amended to include commonly recognized replacements or slightly modified depictions of Nazi symbols.
Violations of the Badges Act 1960 (Abzeichengesetz 1960), which prohibits the public display of Nazi symbols, are punishable by up to € 4000.- fine and up to 1 month imprisonment. However, if the violation is deemed an attempt to promote National Socialism, the Prohibition Act 1947 (Verbotsgesetz 1947) is applied, which allows for up to 10 years imprisonment.

Trading medals, uniforms or other memorabilia however isn't illegal in Austria.

== Canada ==
[[Canada]] has no legislation specifically restricting the ownership, display, purchase, import or export of Nazi flags. However, sections 318–320 of the Criminal Code,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hate Provisions Summary |url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/resources/legislation/canadian_law/federal/criminal_code/criminal_code_hate.cfm |work=Criminal Code of Canada |publisher=Media Awareness Network |accessdate=2009-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813212959/http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/resources/legislation/canadian_law/federal/criminal_code/criminal_code_hate.cfm |archivedate=2009-08-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; adopted by [[Parliament of Canada|Canada's parliament]] in 1970 and based in large part on the 1965 Cohen Committee recommendations,&lt;ref name=HatePropaganda&gt;{{cite web |title=Hate Propaganda |url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/PRBpubs/856-e.htm#a.%20Present%20Law-t |date=2000-01-24 |publisher=Library of Parliament |accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide law enforcement agencies with broad scope to intervene if such flags are used to communicate hatred in a public place (particularly sections 319(1), 319(2), and 319(7).&lt;ref name=HatePropaganda/&gt;

== Cyprus ==

[[Cyprus]] has no legislation designed to restrict the ownership, display, purchase, import or export of Nazi flags, nor does the Criminal Code of Cyprus expressly allow for racist or other bias motives to be taken into account when sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hate Crime Report Card - Cyprus |url=http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/discrimination/pages.aspx?id=104 |work=Fighting Discrimination |publisher=Human Rights First |accessdate=2009-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, use of Nazi flags in a manner likely to cause discrimination, hatred, or violence may be dealt with under Cyprus' ratification of the UN [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]]. This allows for the prosecution of anyone who expresses an idea (in public, using almost any medium including flags) which insults another person's race, religion or ethnicity.&lt;ref name=cyprusletter&gt;{{cite web |author=Ministry of Justice and Public Order |title=Email to Charles Ashburner of the Flag Institute |url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NAZIFLAGS-cyprus.jpg |date=2009-09-13 |work=Modern Use of Nazi Flags |accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Czech Republic==
{{Update|section|date=October 2014}}

The [[Czech Republic]] has no legislation restricting ownership, display, purchase, import or export of Nazi flags; indeed Czech legislation makes even the banning of protests involving such flags very difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Czech court overturns ban on neo-Nazi march past city synagogue  |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/950384.html |date=2008-02-01 |work=News |publisher=Haaretz |accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, in [[Czechoslovakia]] the criminal code was amended with w § 260 which banned propaganda of movements which restricted human rights and freedoms, citing Nazism and Communism. Later the specific mentions of these were removed citing their lack of clear legal definition. However, the law itself was recognized as constitutional.&lt;ref name=khpg&gt;[http://www.legislationline.org/documents/id/17873 "JOINT AMICUS CURIAE BRIEF FOR THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF MOLDOVA ON THE COMPATIBILITY WITH EUROPEAN STANDARDS"], p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The police may cancel such events only once it becomes clear that protesters are inciting hate, which is deemed illegal in the Czech Republic. Legal regulation of hate crimes in the [[Czech Republic]] is contained in Act 140/1961 The Criminal Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Múka |first1=Ondřej |authorlink1=|last2=Krutina |first2=Miroslav |authorlink2=|last3=Rameš |first3=Filip |authorlink3=|last4=Špaček |first4=Jan |authorlink4=|title=Combating hate crime in Latvia and the Czech republic |url=http://www.helcom.cz/download/sborniky/CHV_HateCrime.pdf |format=Paper |year=2003 |publisher=Český helsinský výbor |language=English, Czech |isbn=978-80-86436-22-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (amended by Act 175/1990).

Finland also has a history of swastikas for government and military flags. Namely being the Finnish Air Force, Defense Forces and certain regiments of the army.

The '''Presidency of Evo Morales''' began on January 22, 2006 when [[Evo Morales]] was inaugurated as the 80th [[President of Bolivia]], following his victory in the [[Bolivian general election, 2005|2005 general election]], where he won 53.7% of the vote, defeating [[Jorge Quiroga]] (second with 28.6%), [[Samuel Jorge Doria Medina Auza|Samuel Doria Medina]] (third with 7.8%), and several other candidates. Morales increased taxation on the hydrocarbon industry to bolster social spending, emphasising projects to combat illiteracy, poverty, racism, and sexism. Vocally criticizing [[neoliberalism]] and reducing Bolivia's dependence on the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]], his administration oversaw strong economic growth while following a policy termed "Evonomics" which sought to move from a [[liberal economics|liberal economic]] approach to a [[mixed economy]]. Scaling back U.S. influence in the country, he built relationships with leftist governments in the Latin American [[pink tide]] and signed Bolivia into the [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas]]. Attempting to moderate the left-indigenous activist community, his administration also opposed the right-wing autonomist demands of [[media luna|Bolivia's eastern provinces]]. Winning [[Bolivian vote of confidence referendum, 2008|a recall referendum in 2008]], he instituted a [[Constitution of Bolivia|new constitution]] that established Bolivia as a [[plurinationalism|plurinational state]] and was [[Bolivian general election, 2009|re-elected in 2009]]. His second term witnessed the continuation of leftist policies and Bolivia's joining of the [[Bank of the South]] and [[Community of Latin American and Caribbean States]]; he was again reelected in the [[Bolivian general election, 2014|2014 general election]].

==2006==
{{main|Bolivian Constituent Assembly of 2006-2007}}

A [[constituent assembly]] was convened in 2006, which produced a final text of a new [[Constitution of Bolivia]] in December 2007. It was approved in the [[Bolivian constitutional referendum, 2009]].

==2007==

===Conflict with Reyes Villa===
{{main|Cochabamba social unrest of 2007}}
Among Morales's most outspoken political opponents is Cochabamba Governor [[Manfred Reyes Villa]]. In early 2007 his opposition to Morales' policies inspired many of the President's supporters to take to the streets and demand his resignation. As the group interacted with police and Reyes Villa's supporters events escalated into violence, leaving two dead and 100 injured before calm could be restored.

===Ponchos Rojos===
On January 23, 2007, Morales and Bolivian military chiefs attended an indigenous peoples rally of the "Red Ponchos" (Ponchos Rojos) who support him in the Andean region of Omasuyos. At the rally Morales thanked the group, saying "I urge our Armed Forces along with the ‘Ponchos Rojos’ to defend our unity and our territorial integrity." Because the group is seen as armed and militant by Morales's opposition they accused him and the Armed Forces of supporting "illegal militias."&lt;ref name="merco"&gt;{{cite news | date=January 25, 2007 |url=http://www.mercopress.com/vernoticia.do?id=9722&amp;formato=html |title=Bolivia's Morales reshuffles cabinet and ratifies reforms | work=[[MercoPress]] |accessdate=January 31, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rally was held in [[Achacachi]] which during the 1970s was the center of the leftist guerrilla movement EGTK ([[Tupac Katari Guerrilla Army]]) which had Morales' vice president Álvaro García Linera in their membership.&lt;ref name="middle-class"/&gt; To the cheers of the crowd Morales chastised those calling for regional autonomy saying, "No caballero [a term for white colonizers] will be able to split apart Bolivia."&lt;ref name="middle-class"/&gt;

===Advisor faces terrorism charges in Peru===
[[Walter Chávez]] resigned on February 1, 2007, after being indicted for acts of terrorism in his native country of Peru, which seeks his extradition. Chavez fled Peru following the 1992 coup by [[Alberto Fujimori]], to Bolivia. There, he sought and gained [[refugee]] status after presenting his case to the Bolivian government and the [[United Nations]]. For 15 years, Chavez made a name for himself in public life as a journalist for numerous newspapers, including ''[[La Razón (La Paz)|La Razon]]''—perhaps Bolivia's most important daily newspaper.

Chávez was hired by the Morales’ Presidential campaign and continued on as media advisor for the Presidency once Morales took office. Peruvian authorities accuse him of "having been a member of the [[Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]] guerrilla group that carried out bombings and kidnappings in the 1980s and 1990s."&lt;ref name="Chavez"&gt;{{cite news | date=February 2, 2007 | title=Morales aide resigns over terror uproar | author=Tyler Bridges | url=http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/16600939.htm | work=[[Miami Herald]] | accessdate=February 2, 2007 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;   The specific charges against Chávez is that he was "a [[Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement|MRTA]] member who extorted two Peruvian businessmen on behalf of the group in 1990. …[that same year] Chávez was arrested after receiving $10,000 from one of the men, was released on bail a month later and in 1992 fled to Bolivia."&lt;ref name="Chavez"/&gt; He is also accused "of receiving $5,000 in another case."&lt;ref name=";AP Chavez"&gt;{{cite news | title=Peru Wants Adviser of Bolivian President | author=Álvaro Zuazo | work=[[Washington Post]] | publisher=[[Associated Press]] | date=January 30, 2007 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/30/AR2007013002017.html |accessdate=February 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chávez has repeatedly denied the charges, saying "They accused me of being part of an MRTA cell but they never proved anything against me."&lt;ref name=";AP Chavez" /&gt;

The resignation came as the [[Senate of Bolivia|Bolivian Senate]] (which is led by an alliance of opposition parties) announced its intention to rapidly investigate the extent of "Chávez's duties and how he obtained residency in the country."&lt;ref name=";AP Chavez" /&gt; Peruvian television, Bolivian newspapers and the ''[[Miami Herald]]'' were also pursuing the story with ever more vigor, in the days leading to Chávez leaving the Morales government. He explained his resignation to the ''Miami Herald'', saying that "A lot of things have been said that weren't true. This is beginning to hurt the government."&lt;ref name="Chavez"/&gt; In 2006, Peru had quietly asked for the extradition of Chávez but was turned down as he had been granted political asylum by the Bolivian government. Peru announced that it would be re-filing its extradition request. Chávez said he has no plans to defend himself in court by going to Peru.&lt;ref name="Chavez"/&gt;

===Miners protest===
{{main|Bolivian miners' protest of 2007}}
In early February 2007, parts of the Bolivian region of La Paz were brought to a standstill as 20,000 miners took to the roads and streets to protest a tax hike to the Complementary Mining Tax (ICM) by the Morales government.&lt;ref name="BBC miners"&gt;{{cite news | title= Clashes as Bolivia miners protest | date=February 7, 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News Online]] | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6337921.stm |accessdate=February 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mineweb"&gt;{{cite news | title=20,000 miners march against Bolivia's ICM tax hike, concession policies | author=Dorothy Kosich | date=7 February 2007 | url=http://www.mineweb.net/american_notes/620049.htm | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223102942/http://www.mineweb.net/american_notes/620049.htm | archivedate=23 February 2007 | df= }} Retrieved on February 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The protesting miners threw [[dynamite]] and clashed with those passing by. The Morales government had attempted to head-off the demonstration by announcing on February 5, 2007, that the tax increase was not directed at the 50,000 miners who are co-op members but at larger private mining companies.&lt;ref name="BBC miners"/&gt; This did not dissuade the thousands of protestors who had already gathered nearby the capital in the less affluent city of [[El Alto]].&lt;ref name="Keane miners"&gt;{{cite news | title=Bolivian Miners Protest Tax Increase | author=Dan Keane | publisher=[[Associated Press]] | work=[[Washington Post]] | date=February 6, 2007 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/06/AR2007020601092.html }} Retrieved on February 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==2008==

===Movements for regional autonomy===
Morales's economic policies have generated opposition from some [[Departments of Bolivia|departments]], including [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz]], which have oil and agricultural resources. Political parties that oppose Morales, along with pro-market groups disrupted the workings of Bolivia's [[Bolivian Constituent Assembly|Constitutional Assembly]] by disputing voting mechanisms within the assembly and then by introducing a divisive debate about which city should be Bolivia's capital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boliviainfoforum.org.uk/news-detail.asp?id=26 Bolivia Information Forum news, "New constitution outlined"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219144140/http://www.boliviainfoforum.org.uk/news-detail.asp?id=26 |date=2007-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Four of the country's nine governors are also demanding more autonomy from the central government and a larger share of government revenues.

The four are the governors of [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz]], [[Chuquisaca Department|Chuquisaca]], [[Beni Department|Beni]], and [[Tarija Department|Tarija]]. The remaining five governors are part of Morales's ''[[Movement for Socialism (Bolivia)|Movimiento al Socialismo]]'' party.&lt;ref name="middle-class"&gt;{{cite news | title=Morales faces middle-class protests in Bolivia | author=Patrick J.

Before December 2005, all governors were political appointees of the President.&lt;ref name="Mercando 01-12-07"/&gt;

The call for autonomy comes mainly from the wealthy lowland regions of Bolivia, which are centers of opposition against Morales. It has been alleged{{Who|date=May 2010}} that the autonomy question "has relatively little to do with language, culture, [and] religion… it is mostly about money and resources — specifically, who controls Bolivia's valuable natural gas reserves, second largest in South America after [[Venezuela]]'s."&lt;ref name="middle-class"/&gt; There are also racial overtones to the autonomy movement, quasi-[[fascist]] groups such as the [[Nación Camba]] and the [[Unión Juvenil Cruceñista]] use violence and intimidation tactics against indigenous groups, using autonomy as a tool to subvert the elected government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boliviainfoforum.org.uk/documents/432279594_BIF%20Bulletin%208.pdf BIF Bulletin No 8] Santa Cruz and the banner of autonomy&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UN Special Rapporteur]] on the Human Rights of Indigenous Peoples, [[Rodolfo Stavenhagen]], also published a report on the situation in Santa Cruz following a visit in December 2007 and observed that the political climate had give rise to ‘manifestations of racism more suited to a colonial society than a modern democratic state’.&lt;ref name=BForum38/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?Open&amp;DS=A/HRC/6/15/Add.2&amp;Lang=E UN Special Rapporteur preliminary report on Bolivia, April 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Morales sees some of the calls for autonomy as an attempt to disintegrate Bolivia and has vowed to fight them.  He has "repeatedly charged that rich landowners and businesspeople from the eastern city of Santa Cruz, an anti-Morales stronghold, were fomenting and funding the autonomy movement in a bid to grab national resources."&lt;ref name="middle-class"/&gt;

===Autonomy referendums===
{{main|Bolivian autonomy referendums, 2008}}
Four departments, Santa Cruz, Tarija, Beni and Pando, announced in December 2007, shortly after the proposal of a new Bolivian constitution, that they would seek more autonomy and self-government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Bolivia on alert over states' autonomy push | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/12/14/america/bolivia.php | publisher = International Herald Tribune | date = 2007-12-15 | accessdate = 2007-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Bolivia set on collision course over autonomy | url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/df18a852-ac41-11dc-82f0-0000779fd2ac.html | publisher = Financial Times | date = 2007-12-17 | accessdate = 2007-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz]] and [[Beni Department|Beni]] called referendums on autonomy which were held on May 4, 2008 and June 1, 2008 respectively.  However, the autonomy statutes which they have proposed have been declared illegal and unconstitutional by the [[National Electoral Court of Bolivia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boliviainfoforum.org.uk/news-detail.asp?id=36#Autonomy Bolivia Information Forum News Briefing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boliviainfoforum.org.uk/documents/832802512_BIF%20Emergency%20Bulletin%20Dec%2007.pdf Bolivia Information Forum Briefing] Bolivia constitution text sparks right-wing secession threat&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 4, 2008, authorities in Santa Cruz held a local [[referendum]] on the autonomy statutes that had been presented in December 2007.  The scheduled referendum vote was struck down by Bolivia's [[National Electoral Court of Bolivia|National Electoral Court]] and no international observers were present, as both the [[Organization of American States]] and the [[European Union]] declined to send observers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boliviainfoforum.org.uk/news-detail.asp?id=37#Referendum Bolivia Information Forum - News]&lt;/ref&gt; There was a high rate of abstention from the referendum and some polling booths were blocked and ballot boxes destroyed.&lt;ref name="BForum38"&gt;Bolivia Information Forum, [http://www.boliviainfoforum.org.uk/news-detail.asp?id=38 Bolivia Information Forum News Briefing May 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911003132/http://www.boliviainfoforum.org.uk/news-detail.asp?id=38 |date=2011-09-11 }}, 9 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Protests were somewhat pronounced in areas of major immigration from the western highlands, like [[Yapacani]] and [[San Julián, Bolivia|San Julián]], as well as in areas under indigenous control. In [[Guarani people|Guaraní]] territory, ballot boxes were burned in a rejection of the legitimacy of the vote. There were also allegations of fraud and ballot box interference. Reports allege that ballot boxes were delivered already containing pre-marked ballot papers on which crosses had been placed next to the YES option.&lt;ref name=BForum38/&gt;  Many of the protesters accused Santa Cruz leaders of trying to secede from Bolivia and expressed support for a draft constitution written by Bolivia's [[Bolivian Constituent Assembly|Constituent Assembly]] that grants several different levels of autonomy including departmental and indigenous autonomy. Despite this, results showed 85% approval for the autonomy statute, though abstention was recorded at 39%. The Santa Cruz [[autonomy]] movement conflicts with the constitutional reform proposed by Evo Morales, who seeks to create, as Morales and his supporters perceive it, a fairer state which includes full rights and recognition of the previously marginalized indigenous majority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boliviainfoforum.org.uk/documents/258601654_BIF%20Bulletin%20Special%20edition%20May%202008.pdf Bolivia Information Forum Bulletin Special Edition May 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

The results thrilled leaders in the eastern Bolivian province of Santa Cruz, who had defied the order of the [[National Electoral Court of Bolivia|National Electoral Court]], the [[Bolivian Congress|Congress]] and [[Bolivian President|President]] Evo Morales by putting the statute up for a vote. The statute would give the department additional powers such as the right to form its own police, set tax and land-use policies and elect a governor.

On May 8, the [[Bolivian Congress|National Congress]] passed a law establishing a [[Bolivian recall election, 2008|recall election]] for the mandates of the [[President of Bolivia|President]], [[Vice President of Bolivia|Vice President]] and eight of the nine departmental [[Prefects]] (six of whom were sympathetic to the opposition). President Evo Morales supported this initiative.&lt;ref name=BForum38/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/americas/05/08/bolivia.referendum/ | work=CNN | accessdate=April 1, 2010 | title=Bolivian president agrees to vote of confidence - CNN.com | date=May 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The elements of the autonomy movement came to the fore in the city of [[May 24, 2008 violence in Sucre|Sucre on May 24, 2008]].  Peasants from settlements outside Sucre came to the centre of the city to participate in a ceremony with President Morales.  Instead they were accosted by an aggressive group of young people and marched to Sucre's central square.  There they were made to strip to the waist and burn their [[poncho]]s, the flag of the [[Movement for Socialism (Bolivia)|MAS party]] and the [[wiphala]] (the flag of the Aymara).  While they were doing this they were forced to shout anti-government slogans and were physically assaulted.  Present in the square at the time were [[Jorge Quiroga|Jorge "Tuto" Quiroga]], former president and leader of the opposition party [[Social and Democratic Power|Podemos]], opposition [[Senate of Bolivia|Senator]] [[Óscar Ortiz (Bolivian politician)|Óscar Ortiz]] and [[Prefect]] of [[Cochabamba]], [[Manfred Reyes Villa]].{{Dubious|date=March 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boliviainfoforum.org.uk/news-detail.asp?id=39#Violence Bolivia Information Forum News Briefing May 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; After these events the government declared it to be a "day of national shame".

===Recall Referendum===
{{main|Bolivian vote of confidence referendum, 2008}}
On August 10, 2008, a [[Recall election|recall referendum]] was held in Bolivia on the mandates of President Evo Morales, his Vice-president [[Alvaro Garcia Linera]] and eight of the nine regional prefects. Evo Morales won the referendum with a resounding 67% 'yes' vote, and he and Garcia Linera were ratified in post.&lt;ref name="Bolivia Information Forum News"&gt;Bolivia Information Forum, [http://www.boliviainfoforum.org.uk/news-detail.asp?id=44 Bolivia’s recall referendum: Resounding support for Evo Morales] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911003210/http://www.boliviainfoforum.org.uk/news-detail.asp?id=44 |date=2011-09-11 }}, 14 Aug 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the prefects, both aligned with the political opposition in the country, failed to gain enough support and had their mandates recalled with new prefects to be elected in their place.&lt;ref name="Bolivia Information Forum News"/&gt; The elections were monitored by over 400 observers, including election observers from the [[Organization of American States]], [[European Parliament]] and [[Mercosur]].&lt;ref name="Bolivia Information Forum News"/&gt;

===Civic Coup d'état attempt===
{{main|2008 unrest in Bolivia}}

After Morales' victory in the Recall Referendum, right wing forces led by [[Ruben Costas]], [[Mario Cossio]], [[Leopoldo Fernandez]] and [[Ernesto Suarez]] decided to ignore the result of the vote and on September 2008, launched a civil [[coup d'état]]. According to the Bolivian government, there was evidence that the coup attempt had the backing of the US Ambassador to [[Bolivia]] [[Philip Goldberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Burbach, [[transnational Institute]], [http://www.tni.org/article/united-states-orchestrating-civic-coup-bolivia The United States: Orchestrating a Civic Coup in Bolivia], November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Backers of the coup seized public buildings and airports in the Departments of Santa Cruz, Beni, Pando and Tarija, attacked government officials and Morales supporters, and called for [[civil disobedience]]. People living in the [[Media Luna]], for the most part, favored the coup.  Initially the coup had some success but the [[Porvenir Massacre]] on September 11 and the violence and looting carried out by the coup supporters, turned public opinion against the coup little by little. The coup was definitely defeated when the Morales government decided to declare Mr. Goldberg [[persona non grata]] and to expel him from Bolivia. With no external support and public opinion against it, the attempted coup was completely defeated.

===Autonomy policy===
Evo Morales and the MAS government subsequently adopted autonomy as a government policy and departmental autonomies were recognised in the new Bolivian constitution, approved in a [[Bolivian constitutional referendum, 2009|referendum in January 2009]].  As well as departmental autonomy, the new constitution recognises municipal, provincial and indigenous autonomies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boliviainfoforum.org.uk/documents/374824743_BIF%20Briefing%20February%202009.pdf BIF Briefing February 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/bolivia-after-the-vote "Bolivia: after the vote", John Crabtree, Open Democracy, 2 February 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==2009==

===2009 election===
{{main|Bolivian general election, 2009}}
Following the approval of the new [[Constitution of Bolivia]] in the [[Bolivian constitutional referendum, 2009|January 2009 referendum]], new elections were called. Morales won the [[Bolivian general election, 2009|2009 general election]] with a landslide majority, polling 64%. His party, [[Movement for Socialism (Bolivia)|Movement for Socialism]], also won a two-thirds majority in both the [[National Congress of Bolivia|Chamber of Deputies]] and the [[National Congress of Bolivia|Senate]].

===Assassination attempt===
On April 16, 2009, Bolivian police killed three men and arrested two others in what was called an "assassination plot" against Morales.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel McLaughlin, ''[[The Independent]]'', 25 April 2009, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-irishman-and-the-plot-to-kill-the-bolivian-president-1674009.html The Irishman and the 'plot' to kill the Bolivian President]&lt;/ref&gt; The three men were all foreigners: [[Eduardo Rózsa-Flores]], from Hungary; [[Michael Martin Dwyer|Michael Dwyer]], from Ireland; and [[Árpád Magyarosi]], from [[Romania]]. Police said the men discussed bombing a boat on [[Lake Titicaca]] where Morales and his cabinet had been meeting on April 3, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Irish Times]]'', 4 April 2009, [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2009/0427/1224245446227.html Prosecutor claims he has video of Dwyer discussing assassination]&lt;/ref&gt;

==2010==

===Cabinet===
{{See|Cabinet of Bolivia}}
{{Cabinet of Evo Morales 2010-}}
The cabinet of Morales' second administration was appointed on 23 January 2010. In a gesture of gender equity, it consists of ten men and ten women, seven of whom continued their previous service.

===Constitutional transition===
Morales' second inauguration, on 22 January 2010, marked the beginning of the new Plurinational State of Bolivia, as defined by the 2009 Constitution. The Constitution also required a set of five structural laws, with a deadline of 180 days following 22 January for these laws to be passed. These laws, which made up the bulk of the early 2010 legislative activity, are:
# The Electoral Organs Law
# The Judicial Organs Law
# The Framework Law on Autonomies
# The Electoral Regime Law
# The Constitutional Tribunal Law

===Climate change===
Bolivia's negotiating team, led by [[Pablo Solón Romero|Pablo Solón]], was a leading critic of the United States-sponsored [[Copenhagen Accord]] in the 2009 [[UNFCCC]] negotiations in Copenhagen, Denmark. Shortly thereafter, the Bolivian government issued a call for a [[World People's Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth]], to be held in April 2010. The five-day summit, held in [[Tiquipaya]] on the outskirts of Cochabamba, issued its own People's Agreement as an agenda for international response to climate change. The Bolivian delegation to global climate talks worked to have this document and its demands included in international negotiations, but was isolated in its formal opposition to the conclusions of December [[Cancún climate summit]].

===Potosí Civic Strike===
In July and August, citizens in [[Potosí department]]—led by the [[Potosí Civic Committee]] or Comcipo—engaged in an escalating series of strike actions in support of a six-point agenda of demands of the national government. Actions included a 24-hour closure of business on July 19, a two-day general strike began on July 29 and extended into nineteen days of closures of roads and businesses, hunger strikes by hundreds of people including the department's governor and several of its legislators, and closure of the department's airport. ''Los Tiempos'' called the protests "the most prolonged and overwhelming" that the Morales government has faced so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Retorna la normalidad a Potosí tras casi tres semanas de paro | work = Los Tiempos | accessdate = 2011-01-30 | date = 2010-08-17 | url = http://www.lostiempos.com/diario/actualidad/nacional/20100817/retorna-la-normalidad-a-potosi-tras-casi-tres-semanas-de_85470_163190.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100821175110/http://www.lostiempos.com/diario/actualidad/nacional/20100817/retorna-la-normalidad-a-potosi-tras-casi-tres-semanas-de_85470_163190.html# | archive-date = 2010-08-21 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the demands were resolution of a conflict with [[Oruro Department]] over the limestone rich Pahua hill, activation of the Karachipampa smelting plant, upgrading of Potosí's airport to international airport status, implementation of road construction projects, and preservation of Potosí's [[Cerro Rico]].&lt;ref name=Falso&gt;{{Cite news | title = Ministro califica de falso el conflicto de Potosí y dice que gobierno "perdió una monedita" | work = Los Tiempos | accessdate = 2011-01-30 | date = 2010-08-17 | url = http://www.lostiempos.com/diario/actualidad/nacional/20100817/coca-califica-de-falso-conflicto-lo-de-potosi-y-dice-que-gobierno-perdio_85537_163310.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100819121753/http://www.lostiempos.com/diario/actualidad/nacional/20100817/coca-califica-de-falso-conflicto-lo-de-potosi-y-dice-que-gobierno-perdio_85537_163310.html# | archive-date = 2010-08-19 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations with the national government were held in [[Sucre]], leading to an agreement on August 15. On August 16, Potosino negotiators returned to the city amid widespread celebrations and a Day of Potosí Unity was declared.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Potosí recupera su unidad en una dura pelea por sus derechos | work = El Potosí | date = 2010-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Morales administration officials charged the Potosí movement with carrying forward a "false conflict" around issues it was always willing to support.&lt;ref name=Falso /&gt;

===Gasolinazo===
Bolivia faced national protests after the announcement of a Supreme Decree 748 to cut government subsidies for gasoline and diesel fuels, increasing the prices of those commodities on December 28, 2010. The measures triggered widespread protests throughout the country, among groups including Morales's own political base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.la-razon.com/version_temp.php?ArticleId=1105&amp;EditionId=2393&amp;idp=10&amp;ids=164 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305014341/http://www.la-razon.com/version_temp.php?ArticleId=1105&amp;EditionId=2393&amp;idp=10&amp;ids=164 |archivedate=2011-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the protests, on 31 December 2010, Morales announced that the supreme decree would be annulled, saying that he was complying with his promise to "listen to the people". The protest measures were subsequently called off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la-razon.com/version_temp.php?ArticleId=1114&amp;EditionId=2394&amp;idp=10&amp;ids=166 La Razon, 1 Jan 2011: "MORALES ABROGA EL DS 748 y neutraliza las protestas"]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas Morales enjoyed consistently high approval ratings in his first term, the "Gasolinazo" was a contributory factor to a sharp decline in approval.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lostiempos.com/diario/actualidad/politica/20110224/encuesta-ipsos-apoyo-popularidad-de-evo-morales-cae-al_114465_226704.html "Encuesta Ipsos Apoyo: Popularidad de Evo Morales cae al 32%"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226053931/http://www.lostiempos.com/diario/actualidad/politica/20110224/encuesta-ipsos-apoyo-popularidad-de-evo-morales-cae-al_114465_226704.html |date=2011-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2011==

===Price crisis===
In the wake of the December gasolinazo, rising world food prices, and local supply disruptions (particularly around sugar), prices rose sharply in early 2011. Organizations of public transit drivers and milk producers demanded higher prices for their goods, while workers went on strike for higher wages.&lt;ref name=CalleRestive&gt;{{cite news|title=Bolivia's Evo Morales: The calle gets restive|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18285808|accessdate=18 March 2011|newspaper=The Economist|date=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early March, the government issued a Supreme Decree raising wages by 10% and the minimum wage by 20% to 815.40 Bolivianos per month, but the move failed to stop protests and strikes by the ''Central Obrera Boliviana'' labor confederation.

===Sanabria drug trafficking scandal===
A senior policymaker on narcotics policing, retired General René Sanabria, was arrested on February 24 in Panama and extradited to the United States to face narcotrafficking charges.&lt;ref name=CalleRestive /&gt; Sanabria had been the head of the Center of Intelligence and Information Generation ({{lang-es|Centro de Inteligencia y Generación de Información}},Cegein)  and was the director of the Special Force in Fighting Drug Traffic ({{lang-es|Fuerza Especial de Lucha Contra el Narcotráfico}}, Felcn) in 2007 and 2008. {{As of|2011|3|2}}, four more of the fifteen counternarcotics officials in Cegein were arrested by Bolivian authorities, while the remaining 10 were under investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rojas M.|first=July|title=Caso Sanabria aniquila Inteligencia antidrogas|url=http://www.lostiempos.com/diario/actualidad/politica/20110302/caso-sanabria-aniquila-inteligencia-antidrogas_115312_228608.html|accessdate=18 March 2011|newspaper=Los Tiempo|date=2 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305081227/http://www.lostiempos.com/diario/actualidad/politica/20110302/caso-sanabria-aniquila-inteligencia-antidrogas_115312_228608.html#|archive-date=2011-03-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the affair, Evo Morales named Colonel [[Ciro Farfán]] as new general commander of the [[Bolivian National Police|National Police]], giving him ninety days to eliminate corruption in the force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Cambian a Comandante de la Policía y dan plazo de 90 días para erradicar corrupción | work = Los Tiempos | accessdate = 2011-03-18 | date = 2011-03-11 | url = http://www.lostiempos.com/diario/actualidad/nacional/20110311/cambian-a-comandante-de-la-policia-y-dan-plazo-de-90-dias-para-erradicar_116537_231316.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121005042732/http://www.lostiempos.com/diario/actualidad/nacional/20110311/cambian-a-comandante-de-la-policia-y-dan-plazo-de-90-dias-para-erradicar_116537_231316.html | archivedate = 2012-10-05 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Farfán himself was relieved of duty on May 19 due to his involvement in a fraudulent license plate ring at the Directorate for the Prevention of Vehicle Theft (Diprove).&lt;ref name=EDF&gt;{{Cite news | title = Evo destituyó a Farfán y posesionó al Gral.

===Labor mobilization===
The [[Bolivian Workers' Center]] (COB) coordinated a 12-day general strike in April 2011. The strike covered four sectors—teachers, health workers, some miners, and La Paz municipal employees—but striker's blockades paralyzed much of the country's economic life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Achtenberg | first = Emily | title = Bolivia: The COB vs. the GOB | publisher = North American Congress on Latin America | work = Rebel Currents (NACLA) | accessdate = 2011-12-27 | url = https://nacla.org/blog/2011/5/20/bolivia-cob-vs-gob }}&lt;/ref&gt; The strike was resolved on April 18 with a minimal addition to the government's proposed 10% nominal wage increase and a 12-point package of agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = COB levanta huelga general y acepta acuerdo con Gobierno | work = Cambio | accessdate = 2011-12-27 | date = 2011-04-19 | url = http://www.cambio.bo/noticia.php?fecha=2011-04-19&amp;idn=43424 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120514142756/http://www.cambio.bo/noticia.php?fecha=2011-04-19&amp;idn=43424# | archive-date = 2012-05-14 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous protests===
{{main|2011 Bolivian indigenous protests}}
In July 2011, following the beginning of construction on the [[Villa Tunari – San Ignacio de Moxos Highway|Villa Tunari]] across the [[Isiboro Sécure National Park and Indigenous Territory|Isiboro]] (TIPNIS), the Subcentral TIPNIS (the representative institution of indigenous residents in the territory), the [[Confederation of Indigenous Peoples of Bolivia]], and the highland indigenous confederation [[CONAMAQ]] announced they would participate in a national march opposing the project. This march—the "Eighth Grand National Indigenous March"—travelled from Trinidad, Beni to La Paz in opposition to the project, beginning on August 15, 2011. On September 25, a police raid on the march resulted in the detention of hundreds of marchers, who were later released. The march regrouped and arrived in La Paz on October 19 to a massive public welcome. During the march, other movements such as the Cochabamba campesino confederation and the ''colonos'' union in Yucumo mobilized in favor of the project. In early October, the [[Plurinational Legislative Assembly]] passed legislation authored by the MAS authorizing the road following a consultation process, but indigenous deputies and the indigenous movement opposed the bill. At the opening of negotiations with the protesters on October 21, Morales announced that he would veto the legislation and support the text proposed by the indigenous deputies. This text was passed by the Assembly and signed into law on October 24, effectively ending the conflict. Law 180 of 2011 declares TIPNIS an intangible zone and prohibits the construction of highways that cross it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = El Presidente promulga la ley corta del Tipnis | work = Los Tiempos | accessdate = 2011-10-29 | date = 2011-10-25 | url = http://www.lostiempos.com/diario/actualidad/economia/20111025/el-presidente-promulga-la-ley-corta-del-tipnis_146889_303848.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111030002511/http://www.lostiempos.com/diario/actualidad/economia/20111025/el-presidente-promulga-la-ley-corta-del-tipnis_146889_303848.html | archivedate = 2011-10-30 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plurinational Encuentro===
Beginning in early 2011, the Morales government insisted that any new moves on the fuel subsidy issue raised in the ''gasolinazo'' would be agreed on by multiple sectors of society in a summit. Following the TIPNIS controversy and various calls from supporters to "re-drive the process of change," the government organized a broader Plurinational Encuentro to Deepen the Process of Change ({{lang-es|Encuentro Plurinacional para Profundizar el Proceso de Cambio}}), charged with setting the government's agenda for 2012. The Encuentro consists of three parts: opening and closing general meetings bracket a period of consultation with the broader membership of participating organizations. The opening encounter united numerous sectoral organizations, the President, Vice President, Cabinet Ministers,  legislators, MAS-IPSP governors, and other officials at the Casa Campestre on the west side of the city of Cochabamba on 12–14 December 2011. Some 650 delegates organized themselves into 10 thematic tables which produced an agenda including no fewer than 51 new laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Mealla | first = Luis | title = Cumbre Social cierra primera etapa con demanda de 51 proyectos de ley | work = Página Siete | accessdate = 2011-12-30 | date = 2011-12-15 | url = http://www.paginasiete.bo/2011-12-15/Nacional/Destacados/200000115.aspx | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120605204353/http://www.paginasiete.bo/2011-12-15/Nacional/Destacados/200000115.aspx# | archive-date = 2012-06-05 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous confederations CIDOB and CONAMAQ declined to attend organized an alternate assembly in Santa Cruz. The COB labor Federation also avoided the meeting and met separately to propose a national agenda.

The closing meetings were held 9–12 January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Convocan a reunión departamental en La Paz para definir posición rumbo a Encuentro Plurinacional | work = Página Siete | accessdate = 2011-12-30 | date = 2011-12-29 | url = http://www.paginasiete.bo/2011-12-21/Nacional/Destacados/politi.aspx | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120605204435/http://www.paginasiete.bo/2011-12-21/Nacional/Destacados/politi.aspx# | archive-date = 2012-06-05 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationalization of electrical grid===
{{main|Red Eléctrica de España#Nationalisation of Bolivian assets}}
On 1 May 2012, the [[Bolivia]]n government announced its plans to [[nationalisation|nationalise]] Red Eléctrica's subsidiary in the country, Transportadora de Electricidad (TDE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/bolivia-nationalizes-unit-spains-red-electrica-211942399.html|title=Bolivia nationalizes unit of Spain's Red Electrica, source: Reuters|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electric grid covers 74% of Bolivia's total grid, or 2,772 kilometres of transmission lines; the rest is controlled by smaller companies in the eastern lowlands which are not attached to the national grid. President [[Evo Morales]] said though Red Eléctrica would be compensated, it had invested US$81 million since the grid's privatisation in 1997 and the government had "invested $220m in generation and others profited. For that reason, brothers and sisters, we have decided to nationalise electricity transmission. Just to make it clear to national and international public opinion, we are nationalising a company that previously was ours." The Spanish Ambassador Ramon Santos said that the move was "sending a negative message that generates distrust." Following the measure, soldiers took over the corporate headquarters in [[Cochabamba]] peacefully and raised Bolivian flags. It also follows the partial nationalisation of the electric grid in 2010, including [[hydroelectric]] plants.

A '''recession-proof job''' is a [[job (role)|job]] that one is likely to be able to find even during [[recession|hard economic times]]. Though these jobs are not truly "recession-proof," they have a continual demand for workers, thereby increasing the chances that one who has the skills will be likely to find employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://a.abclocal.go.com/kfsn/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6539810 |title=Recession-Proof Jobs in the Valley - 12/05/08 - Fresno News - abc30.com |publisher=A.abclocal.go.com |date=2008-12-05 |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standree.com/jobs-recession-tips/ |title=Ride Out Recession With Penny Pinching, Job Tips }}&lt;/ref&gt;

What makes a job so-called recession-proof is society's perpetual need and heavy demand for the service related jobs. Certain fields, such as [[health care]], [[education]], [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]], and various computer-related occupations are thereby always in demand. But as to which specific jobs are the most recession-proof, this varies in different eras, as the times change, and each recession differs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marcia Heroux Pounds |url=http://www.the33tv.com/sns-health-jobs-recession-proof,0,7437899.story |title=Want Job Security? - KDAF |publisher=The33tv.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the geographic locality may make a difference.

When a recession occurs, many people, especially those who have lost their jobs, those whose jobs have been threatened, or those who fear losing their jobs are motivated to seek education to be able to obtain recession-proof employment in their future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2009/may/15/recession-proof/ |title=Economic conditions motivate some to make career changes |publisher=The Commercial Appeal |date= |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Slavica''' is a simple [[writing system]] for the [[Croatian language | Croatian]] and [[Serbian language | Serbian]] languages proposed by [[Rajko Igić]] in his 1987 book, ''Nova Slovarica'', published by Universal from [[Tuzla]]. The [[alphabet]] is a combination of [[Gaj's Latin alphabet|Croat Latin]] and [[Serbian Cyrillic]] alphabets and was intended for people from [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] that spoke the same language but wrote it using two different writing systems.

== Organisation ==
Slavica uses 17 Latin letters, with 8 Cyrillic letters used in the cases where the native Slavic Latin script uses [[diacritic]]s and [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]. Five letters common to both alphabets — ''a'', ''e'', ''o'', ''j'', and ''k'' — are also used in this new script. Therefore, Slavica follows the principle of one [[grapheme]] for one [[phoneme]].

==Implementation==
The new alphabet was tested in 1988 and 1989 by students from the primary school Mate Balota in [[Buje]], [[Croatia]]. According to media articles published in 1987 and 1988, it was especially attractive with people from [[Bosnians|Bosnia]], [[Vojvodina]] and [[Istria]]. However, strong opposition was noted in these years by the Croatian media. Slavica was discussed both before and after the civil war in daily newspapers including ([[Večernje novosti]], Front slobode, [[Dnevnik HRT|Dnevnik]], etc.) as well as magazines, such ([[American Psychologist]] in 1999; Pregled, Sarajevo, 2005; Prosvjetna poslanica, Tuzla, in 2006), and various online outlets.

The '''Sunhak Peace Prize''' (선학평화상, 鮮鶴平和賞) was established to continue the legacy of the late Rev. Dr. [[Sun Myung Moon]], and is given bi-annually in recognition of individuals and organizations that have made enduring contributions to help resolve worldwide suffering, conflict, poverty and threats to the environment, by promoting a comprehensive, future-oriented vision of peace.
== Purpose ==
The Sunhak Peace Prize was founded at the behest of Dr. [[Hak Ja Han Moon]], the wife of the late Rev. Dr. [[Sun Myung Moon]], to honor and preserve his ideals and achievements. Rev. and Mrs. Moon have devoted their lives to realizing "One Family Under God," a global community founded on the principles of interdependence, mutual prosperity and universally shared values, based on a love for humanity that transcends divisions of race, nationality, ideology, and religion.  

The Sunhak Peace Prize is committed to the ideal of peace, "Making the World Better for Future Generations." Humankind is one universal family ocnsisting of successive generations.  As parents care for their children with unconditional love, those living today should create an environment of peace for future generations. The concept of peace underlying the Sunhak Peace Prize is based on the vision of ensuring a peaceful world for current and future generations.

Toward this end, the Sunhak Peace Prize advocates Sustainable Human Development, Conflict Resolution, and Ecological Conservation. "Sustainable Human Development" focuses on solving the problems of poverty, disease, and ignorance, and respecting the human rights and dignity of every human being.

{{Italic title}}
'''''The Night Letter''''' is a 1978 book by [[Paul Spike]], with a double-layered structure: an anti-Nazi spy [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] on the background of the early part of the [[Second World War]], and an exposure of cynical and [[machiavelli]]an maneuverings in the American corridors of power.

The book belongs to the subgenre of [[secret history]] &amp;ndash; i.e. with a plot in which real historical figures play a substantial part, doing things which are the author's invention but which supposedly (for reasons given in the plot) remained secret and did not come to the knowledge of the public.

In the book, a British doctor meets in 1936 with President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who is unaware that the doctor is a [[Nazi]] sympathizer. The visitor manages to secretly photograph the President in a compromising position with his secretary, [[Marguerite LeHand|Missy LeHand]] (whom historians  widely assume to have been indeed Roosevelt's mistress).

By 1940, senior Nazi leader [[Reinhard Heydrich]] possesses the picture and intends to use the photo for blackmail and prevent Roosevelt from running for a third term &amp;ndash; in the hope that whoever gets elected instead would be more likely to keep the US out of the [[Second World War]].

The President must recover the photo before the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] Convention which is about to nominate him. What makes the situation more difficult is that Roosevelt also needs to bypass the [[FBI]] &amp;ndash; for apprehension that should the photo fall into the hands of [[J. Edgar Hoover]], the FBI Director might use it for his own brand of blackmail. Instead, Roosevelt employs former FBI Agent Jackson, who had left the Bureau under a cloud and incurred Hoover's personal enmity, and who is completely loyal to the President.

The bulk of the book follows Jackson's chase after the photo, starting from [[Paris]] at the very eve of its fall to the [[Wehrmacht]] and concluding with a cataclysmic confrontation at a secret [[Michigan]] base of the "[[Silver Shirts]]" &amp;ndash; a murderous, power-mad American [[Fascist]] militia (which truly existed, though not necessarily doing all that the book describes it as doing). The chase ends with a mixed result &amp;ndash; the Nazi agents have been killed or captured, but the negative did fall into the hands of the FBI who caught the scent of what was going on.

The book ends on a cynical note: Hoover meets the President at the White House, claims to have destroyed the negatives (which is manifestly untrue) and proceeds to imperiously demand the sacking of Jackson &amp;ndash; obviously he is under the impression that he now holds Roosevelt's fate in his hand. Upon being shown this, the President presents a photo of his own, showing Hoover in a compromising position with a handsome young FBI agent. Roosevelt and Hoover would henceforth be tied to each other, "like convicts in chain gang", each able to destroy the other but only at the cost of his own destruction.

{{Politics of the Netherlands}}

The '''Theo Heemskerk cabinet''' was the [[cabinet of the Netherlands]] from 12 February 1908 until 29 August 1913. The cabinet was formed by the [[List of political parties in the Netherlands|political party]] [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]] (ARP) and the [[General League of Roman Catholic Caucuses]] (ABRK) following the fall of the [[De Meester cabinet]] 21 December 1907. The [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] cabinet was a [[minority government]] in the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] but was [[Confidence and supply|supported]] by [[Independent politician|Independent Catholics]] (Ind. C.) and [[Independent politician|Independent Protestants]] (Ind. P.) for a majority. After the [[Dutch general election, 1909|election of 1909]] the [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]] and the [[General League of Roman Catholic Caucuses]] received a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the votes and the cabinet could continued to govern as a [[majority government]] from 27 July 1909. [[Theo Heemskerk]] of the [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]] was [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Prime Minister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} {{cite web|url=http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/bwn1880-2000/lemmata/bwn3/heemskerk|title=Heemskerk, Theodorus (1852-1932)|publisher=Resources Huygens|date=12 November 2013|accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{confuse|The Twelve Tables}}
The '''Twelve Articles''' were part of the peasants' demands of the [[Swabian League]] during the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525. They are considered the first draft of [[human rights]] and [[civil liberties]] in continental Europe after the Roman Empire. The gatherings in the process of drafting them are considered to be the first [[constituent assembly]] on German soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Zwölf Artikel und Memmingen auf memmingen.de|trans-title=|periodical=|publisher=|url=http://www.memmingen.de/freiheitspreis.html#c4467|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=14 March 2009|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Blickle: Die Geschichte der Stadt Memmingen, von den Anfängen bis zum Ende der Reichsstadtzeit, S. 393 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zwölf Artikel und Bundesordnung der Bauern, Flugschrift "An die versamlung gemayner pawerschafft", Stadtarchiv Memmingen, Materialien zur Memminger Stadtgeschichte, Reihe A, H. 2, S. 1, S. 3 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Unterallgäu und Memmingen, Edition Bayern, Haus der Bayerischen Geschichte, 2010, S. 60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Memminger Stadtrecht, Satzung der Stadt Memmingen über den Memminger Freiheitspreis 1525, Präambel&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidents==
On 6 March 1525 about 50 representatives of the Upper Swabian Peasants Groups (of the [[Baltringer Haufen|Baltringer Mob]], the Allgäuer Mob, and the Lake Constance Mob), met in [[Memmingen]] to deliberate upon their common stance against the [[Swabian League]]. One day later and after difficult negotiations, they proclaimed the Christian Association, an Upper Swabian Peasants' [[Confederation]]. The peasants met again on 15 and 20 March 1525 in Memmingen and, after some additional deliberation, adopted the Twelve Articles and the Federal Order (Bundesordnung).

The Articles and the Order are only examples among many similar programmes developed during the German Peasants' War that were published in print. The Twelve Articles in particular were printed over 25,000 times within the next two months, a tremendous print run for the 16th century. Copies quickly spread throughout [[Germany]]. Since the two texts were not developed any further in the course of the German Peasants' War, some sources speak of the meeting in Memmingen as a constitutional peasant assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Blickle: ''Die Geschichte der Stadt Memmingen, von den Anfängen bis zum Ende der Reichsstadtzeit'', Stuttgart 1997, S. 393.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary of the Twelve Articles== 
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
[[Image:Die12artikelDecke.jpg|thumb|250px|The title page of the ''Twelve Articles''.]]
#Every [[municipality]] shall have the right to elect and remove a preacher if he behaves improperly. The preacher shall preach the [[gospel]] simply, straight and clearly without any [[human]] [[wikt:amendment|amendment]], for, it is written, that we can only come to [[God]] by true [[belief]].
#The preachers shall be paid from the great [[tithe]]. A potential surplus shall be used to pay for the poor and the [[war tax]]. The small tithe shall be dismissed, for it has been trumped-up by humans, for the Lord, our master, has created the cattle free for mankind.
#It has been practice so far, that we have been held as [[villein]], which is pitiful, given that Christ redeemed all of us with his precious bloodshed, the shepherd as well as the highest, no one excluded. Therefore, it is devised by the scripture, that we are and that we want to be free.
#It is unfraternal and not in accordance with the word of God that the simple man does not have the right to catch game, fowls, and fish. For, when God our master created man, he gave him power over all animals, the bird in the air and the fish in the water.
#The high gentlemen have taken sole possession of the woods. If the poor man needs something, he has to buy it for double money. Therefore, all the woods that were not bought (relates to former community woods, which many rulers had simply appropriated) shall be given back to the municipality so that anybody can satisfy his needs for timber and firewood thereof. 
#The matter of excessive services demanded of us should be properly looked into as we are only required to serve according to God
#The nobility shall not force more services or dues from the peasant without payment. The peasant should help the lord when it is necessary and at proper times.
#Many properties are not worth the rent demanded. Honest men shall inspect these properties and fix a rent in accordance with justice
#There are constantly new laws being made. One does not punish according to the offence but at discretion (raising fines and arbitrary punishment was common). It is our opinion that we shall be judged according to the case's merits, and not with partiality
#Several have appropriated meadows and acres (community land that was at the disposition of all members), that belong to the municipality. Those we want back to our common hands.
#The “Todfall” (a sort of inheritance tax) shall be abolished altogether and never again shall widows and orphans be robbed contrary to God and honour. 
#It is our decision and final opinion that if one or several of the articles mentioned herein were not in accordance with the word of God, those we shall refrain from if it is explained to us on the basis of the scripture. If several articles were already granted to us and it emerged afterwards that they were ill, they shall be dead and null. Likewise, we want to have reserved that if even more articles are found in the writ that were against God and a grievance to though neighbour.

==The Federal Order (Bundesordnung)==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
The Federal Order reached high print run as well and was probably particularly popular with the peasants, since it provided a model for a federal social order based on the municipality. Peasants’ communities were found to have been organised pursuant to this in the Black Forest, the Alsace and in Franconia.

==Roots of the Twelve Articles==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
The roots of the Twelve Articles are disputed. Some sources attribute them to the Peasants Leader (Bauernkanzler) Wendel Hipler. Normally they are attributed to the reformer [[Sebastian Lotzer]] from Memmingen, who had possibly broadened already existing texts together with [[Christoph Schappeler]].

On 16 February 1525 about 25 villages pertaining to the city of Memmingen rebelled, and in view of their economic condition and the general political situation, demanded considerable improvements with the city council. The complaints touched subjects like peonage, land regime, easements on the woods and the commons as well as ecclesiastical requirements. 
The peasants wanted reforms on a broad front. The city had set up a committee of villagers and expected to see a long checklist of specific demands. Very unexpectedly though, the peasants delivered a uniform, fundamental declaration made up of twelve articles. Many of those demands did subsequently not prevail in the city council, but one can assume, that the articles of the ''ordines provinciales una congregati'' (the representatives of the territory) of Memmingen had become the basis of discussion for the Twelve Articles agreed on by the Upper Swabian Peasants Confederation of 20 March 1525.

It is well possible that [[Joss Fritz|Joß Fritz]]’s demands, which he had raised during the so-called [[Bundschuh movement]] in 1513 influenced the articles of the representatives of the territory of Memmingen and thereby also had their influence on the Twelve Articles.

==Martin Luther and the Twelve Articles==
The peasants had to burden the many encumbrances they were charged with and in [[Martin Luther]]’s and the reformation’s stance they saw the affirmation that most of those were not provided for by the will of God.

But Luther was not happy with the peasants’ revolts and their invoking him. Possibly he also saw their negative effect on the Reformation as a whole. He called upon the peasants and urged them to keep peace. He also wrote to the gents:

''“They set up twelve articles which of some are so just, that they do shame to you before God and world. But almost all of them are in their favour and not drawn up to the best. […] But it is unbearable to tax and slave-drive people like this forever.”''

In May 1525 Luther’s script "[[Against the Murderous, Thieving Hordes of Peasants]]" appeared, in which he took sides for the authorities and, fearing for the godly order, called for the peasants’ destruction. It was specifically caused by the so-called “Weinsberger Bluttat”, the peasants under [[Jäcklein Rohrbach]] killing the High Governor, count Ludwig Helferich of Helfenstein and his followers, after having seized the city and the castle.

==Continued effect==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
The fundamental ideas laid down in these demands seems to have lasted longer than their main fighters and representatives.

A direct comparison with the [[American Declaration of Independence]] of 1776 yields some equivalence in the motives and the implementation into the text. The results of the [[French Revolution]] starting in 1789 in the form of a modern state, that is a republic, sees quite some of the peasants’ points implemented.

In the following 300 years the peasants rarely rebelled. Only with the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of March 1848/49]] (Märzrevolution), the peasants’ objectives as formulated in the Twelve Articles of 1525 were finally implemented.

The second [[Second Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] of 1965 defined the “supreme principle” of the reform on the liturgy to allow for the “conscious, active and comprehensive participation of the believers” in the liturgy of the church. In this context the respective popular language was added to the thitherto authoritative Latin as the language of the liturgy.

[[File:Angry mob of four.jpg|thumb|right|An artist's depiction of a prototypical angry mob staging a revolt]]

A '''user revolt''' is a social conflict in which [[User (system)|users]] of a [[website]] collectively and openly protest a website host's or [[Internet forum#Administrator|administrator's]] instructions for using the website. Sometimes it happens that the website hosts can control a website's use in certain ways, but the hosts also depend on the users to comply with voluntary social rules in order for the website to operate as the hosts would like. A user revolt occurs when the website users protest against the voluntary social rules of a website, and use the website in a way that is in conflict with the wishes of the website host or administrators.

A user revolt is a process starting with a triggering event, then a [[rebellion]], then a response to the rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mashable.com/2009/05/16/why-revolts-occur/#o9DZjzq0zgq1 |title=Why Social Media Revolts Take Place (and How We Might Prevent Them) |first=Ben |last=Parr |work=mashable.com |date=16 May 2009 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In traditional media like newspapers and television broadcasting, if the media outlet did something to upset readers, they rarely had to fear a hostile audience reaction.&lt;ref name="Douglas 2008"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://gawker.com/348607/how-the-internets-biggest-social-news-site-saved-itself-again |title=How The Internet's Biggest Social News Site Saved Itself (Again) |first=Nick |last=Douglas |work=gawker.com |date=24 January 2008 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because in traditional media, the viewers have limited ability to discuss among themselves how to organize to protest the media outlet they are all sharing.&lt;ref name="Douglas 2008"/&gt; Some Internet media outlets differ in that their community of users can easily contact each other, organize, and present a coordinated revolt against any given media company.&lt;ref name="Douglas 2008"/&gt; Sometimes they can even do this using that media company's own hosted forums.&lt;ref name="Douglas 2008"/&gt;

==Distinction from Internet-based activism==
[[Internet-based activism]] is sometimes called a user revolt when website users protest the terms of a website while using that website for other purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mashable.com/2011/12/07/social-media-uprising-activism/#P73tMy2p5iqs |title=9 Social Media Uprisings That Sought to Change the World in 2011 |first=Zoe |last=Fox |work=mashable.com |date=7 December 2011 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify||date=December 2015}} A distinction between a user revolt and Internet-based activism could be that in a user revolt, an objective of the protest is to revolt against the website itself. In Internet-based activism, the primary goal of the protest is something other than reforming a website, although websites which create barriers to the larger protest may incidentally experience a user revolt for participating in the larger conflict. An example of a situation in which Internet activism includes a user revolt might be when users wish to engage in prohibited political discussion, but a government compels the website host to censor those discussions. The core conflict in this case is between users and the government, and not that the website itself as a communication medium. However, when the website as a communication medium chooses to create barriers to communication for users, then users of the website organize a user revolt even when the primary objective is something other than a website protest.

Examples of Internet-based activism which led to user revolts include [[Social media and the Arab Spring]] and the [[Twitter Revolution]].

==Triggers==
The many triggers of user revolt can be roughly split into three broad categories, including unwelcomed changes to technical features,  unwelcomed changes to policies, and heavy handedness of host platforms in dealing with core members.

Led by Edgar Enyedy, they left Wikipedia on 26 February 2002, and created the new website, hosted free by the [[University of Seville]], with the freely licensed articles of the Spanish-language Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=[[Nathaniel Tkacz|Tkacz]]|first=[[Nathaniel Tkacz|Nathaniel]]|title=The Spanish Fork: Wikipedia's ad-fuelled mutiny|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-01/20/wikipedia-spanish-fork|newspaper=Wired UK|date=20 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The split was provoked over concern that Wikipedia would accept advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://networkcultures.org/cpov/2011/01/15/spanish_fork/ |title=‘Good luck with your WikiPAIDia’: Reflections on the 2002 Fork of the Spanish Wikipedia |first=Nathaniel |last=Tkacz |work=networkcultures.org |date=15 January 2011 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Wikipedia made a commitment to not use advertising, the Spanish fork attracted no more attention, and was mostly abandoned within a year of its founding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lih|first1=Andrew|title=The Wikipedia revolution : how a bunch of nobodies created the world's greatest encyclopedia|date=2009|publisher=Hyperion|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4013-0371-6|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AWuZAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT273&amp;lpg=PT273&amp;dq=wikipedia+spanish+fork+advertising&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Kub6TpjjqF&amp;sig=CgsAYVMbDYRnOglsnJIy_QzioBQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBWoVChMI6bW64r6jxwIVxXE-Ch0HxwDW#v=onepage&amp;q=wikipedia%20spanish%20fork%20advertising&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/12/02/wikipedia-has-a-ton-of-money-so-why-is-it-begging-you-to-donate-yours/ |title=Wikipedia has a ton of money.

====VisualEditor====
{{main|VisualEditor}}

''[[The Daily Dot]]'' suggested that the Wikimedia Foundation's pursuit of more users may be at the risk of alienating the existing editors.&lt;ref name="TheDailyDot"/&gt; Some experienced editors have expressed concerns about the rollout and bugs, with the [[German Wikipedia]] community voting overwhelmingly against making the VisualEditor the new default, and expressing a preference for making it an "opt-in" feature instead.&lt;ref name="TheDailyDot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theregister-buggy"&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Register]]|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/08/01/wikipedians_reject_wysiwyg_editor/ |title=Wikipedians say no to Jimmy's 'buggy' WYSIWYG editor |author=  Andrew Orlowski|date=2013-08-01 |accessdate=2013-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these complaints, the Wikimedia Foundation continued with the rollout to other languages.&lt;ref name="TheDailyDot"&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Daily Dot]]|url=http://www.dailydot.com/business/wikipedia-visual-editor-wysiwyg/ |title=Will Wikipedia's pretty new editing software solve its recruitment crisis? |author= Tim Sampson  |date=2012-07-04 |accessdate=2013-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Register]]'' said, "Our brief exploration suggests it certainly removes any need to so much as remember what kind of parenthesis belongs where."&lt;ref name="TheRegister Sharwood 2013"&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Register]]|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/06/07/wysiwyg_wikipedia_writer_lands_in_july/ |title=Wikimedia edges closer to banishing Wikitext |author= Simon Sharwood|date=2013-06-07 |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Economist]]''{{'}}s L.M.,  said it is "the most significant change in Wikipedia's short history."&lt;ref name="TheEconomist"&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Economist]]|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2011/12/changes-wikipedia |title=Changes at Wikipedia: Seeing things |author= L.M.  |date=2011-12-13 |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Softpedia]]'' ran an article titled "Wikipedia's New VisualEditor Is the Best Update in Years and You Can Make It Better".&lt;ref name="softpedia-best"&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Softpedia]]|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Wikipedia-s-New-VisualEditor-Is-the-Best-Update-in-Years-and-You-Can-Make-It-Better-365072.shtml |title=Wikipedia's New VisualEditor Is the Best Update in Years and You Can Make It Better |author=Lucian Parfeni|date=2013-07-02 |accessdate=2013-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some opponents have said that users may feel belittled by the implication that "certain people" are confused by wiki markup and therefore need the VisualEditor.&lt;ref name="Simonite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/520446/the-decline-of-wikipedia/|title=The Decline of Wikipedia: Even As More People Than Ever Rely on It, Fewer People Create It|last=Simonite|first=Tom|date=October 22, 2013|work=[[MIT Technology Review]]|accessdate=January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Daily Dot'' reported on 24 September 2013 that the Wikimedia Foundation had experienced a mounting backlash from the English Wikipedia community, which criticised the VisualEditor as slow, poorly implemented and prone to break articles' existing text formatting. In the resulting "test of wills" between the community and the Foundation, a single volunteer administrator overrode the Wikimedia Foundation's settings to change the availability of VisualEditor from opt-out to opt-in. The Foundation acquiesced, but vowed to continue developing and improving the VisualEditor.&lt;ref name=thereg&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Register]]|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/09/25/wikipedia_peasants_revolt/|title=Revolting peasants force Wikipedia to cut'n'paste Visual Editor into the bin|author=Andrew Orlowski|date=2013-09-25|accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dd-kww"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailydot.com/news/wikipedia-visualeditor-kww-patch/|title=Wikipedia faces revolt over VisualEditor|work=The Daily Dot|author=Tim Sampson|date=2013-09-24|accessdate=2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Superprotect====
[[File:WMF building wiki wall in August 2014 caricature.jpg|thumb|right|Satirical cartoon depicting the Wikimedia Foundation building a wall to prevent the volunteer Wikimedia community from participating in Wikipedia]]

"Superprotect" was the name for a [[superuser]] tool granted to [[Wikimedia Foundation]] staff but denied to all Wikimedia community members starting in August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Wikipedia contributors listed in history|title=Wikipedia:Protection policy|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Protection_policy#Superprotect|website=Wikipedia|accessdate=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=August 2016}} Wikimedia Foundation staff used the tool to force the installation of the Wikimedia Foundation's software against the wishes of the Wikimedia community.&lt;ref name="Lih 2015"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/opinion/can-wikipedia-survive.html |title=Can Wikipedia Survive? |first=Andrew |last=Lih |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=20 June 2015 |publisher=[[New York Times Company|NYTC]] |location=[[New York, NY|New York]] |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kleinz 2014"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Wikipedia-Superprotect-Streit-spitzt-sich-zu-2293513.html |title=Wikipedia: Superprotect-Streit spitzt sich zu  |first=Torsten |last=Kleinz|work=heise.de |publisher=[[Heinz Heise]] |date=16 August 2014 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conflict was unprecedented.&lt;ref name="Lih 2015"/&gt; [[Erik Möller]], then director of the Wikimedia Foundation, managed the Superprotect tool.&lt;ref name="Kleinz 2014"/&gt; The software in dispute was [[MediaViewer]], which was a software feature that guided Wikipedia readers into viewing images in a certain way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.golem.de/news/superschutz-wikimedia-stiftung-zwingt-deutschen-nutzern-mediaviewer-auf-1408-108522.html |title=Superschutz: Wikimedia-Stiftung zwingt deutschen Nutzern Mediaviewer auf|first=Friedhelm |last=Greis |work=golem.de |date=12 August 2014 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wikimedia commentator [[Andrew Lih]] described the superprotect feature as "[[Orwellian]]-sounding".&lt;ref name="Lih 2015"/&gt;

The MediaViewer and Superprotect conflict between the Wikimedia community and the Wikimedia Foundation was called a revolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/08/18/class_war_wikipedias_workers_revolt_after_bourgeois_papershufflers_suspend_democracy/ |title=Class war! Wikipedia's workers revolt again |first=Andrew |last=Orlowski |work=[[The Register]] |date=18 August 2014 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy demonstrated that the Wikimedia Foundation was unable to control the Wikimedia community with technical features, but rather, that mutual understanding and discussion among stakeholders would be required to develop Wikipedia's software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://netzpolitik.org/2014/kommentar-der-superprotect-streit-in-wikipedia-oder-souveraen-ist-wer-ueber-root-zugriff-verfuegt/ |title=Kommentar: Der "Superprotect"-Streit in Wikipedia, oder: Souverän ist, wer über Root-Zugriff verfügt |first=Leonhard |last=Dobusch |work=[[netzpolitik.org]] |date= 23 August 2014 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feature was reviewed and discussed by the Wikimedia community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2014-08-13/News_and_notes |title=Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost News and notes |author=Neotarf |work=en.wikipedia.org |date=13 August 2014 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=August 2016}}

====Representative dismissals====
Wikimedia users organized a revolt to call for the removal of [[Arnnon Geshuri]], a member of the board of the Wikimedia Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mullin|first1=Joe|title=Wikipedia editors revolt, vote "no confidence" in newest board member|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/01/editors-demand-ouster-of-wikimedia-board-member-involved-in-no-poach-deal/|website=[[Ars Technica]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|accessdate=27 January 2016|date=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=BBC staff|title=Wikipedia editors sign vote of no confidence|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35411208|website=[[BBC]]|accessdate=27 January 2016|date=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wikimedia Foundation head [[Lila Tretikov]] resigned in February 2016 during a user revolt calling for institutional changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Motherboard team|title=Wikimedia Foundation Executive Director Resigns Amid a Community Revolt|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/wikimedia-foundation-executive-director-lila-tretikov-resigns|accessdate=27 February 2016|work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|date=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digg===

====Publishing of DVD unlock code====

In 2007 in the [[AACS encryption key controversy]] various Internet users began publishing the decryption code for the [[Advanced Access Content System]] on various websites. The impact was that the code enabled anyone to write simple software, for example [[DeCSS]], which enabled anyone else to [[Ripping|rip DVDs]] and copy the content as they liked. The release of the key and derivative ripping programs made the illicit distribution of copyrighted media much easier for anyone who wished to share content which was formerly locked by the AACS system.

The AACS codes were published in many places. One place in which they were published was the website [[Digg]].&lt;ref name="Nizza 2007"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/05/02/the-day-the-digg-users-revolted/?_r=0 |title=The Day Digg Users Revolted |first=Mike |last=Nizza |work=thelede.blogs.nytimes.com |date=2 May 2007 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/03/technology/03code.html?hp |title=In Web Uproar, Antipiracy Code Spreads Wildly |first=Brad |last=Stone |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=3 May 2007 |publisher=[[New York Times Company|NYTC]] |location=[[New York, NY|New York]] |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://boingboing.net/2007/05/02/digg-users-revolt-ov.html |title=Digg users revolt over AACS key |first=Cory |last=Doctorow |work=boingboing.net |date=2 May 2007 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://readwrite.com/2007/05/04/what_happened_a_1 |title=What Happened At Digg? - ReadWrite |first=Jitendra |last=Gupta |work=readwrite.com |date=4 May 2007 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.forbes.com/2007/05/02/digital-rights-management-tech-cx_ag_0502digg.html |title=Digg's DRM Revolt |first=Andy |last=Greenberg |work=forbes.com |date=2 May 2007 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2007/05/aacs-la-internet-revolt-be-damned-this-fight-is-not-over/ |title=AACS LA: Internet "revolt" be damned, this fight is not over |first=Ken |last=Fisher |work=arstechnica.com |date=4 May 2007 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 1, 2007, an article appeared on Digg's homepage that contained the [[encryption key]] for the [[Advanced Access Content System|AACS]] [[digital rights management]] protection of [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]]. Then Digg, "acting on the advice of its lawyers," removed posting submissions about the secret number from its database and banned several users for submitting it. The removals were seen by many Digg users as a capitulation to [[corporatocracy|corporate interests]] and an assault on free speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Stone | first = Brad | title = In Web Uproar, Antipiracy Code Spreads Wildly | pages = | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 2007-05-03 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/03/technology/03code.html | accessdate = 2007-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A statement by [[Jay Adelson]] attributed the article's take-down to an attempt to comply with [[cease and desist]] letters from the [[Advanced Access Content System]] consortium and cited Digg's [[Terms of Use]] as justification for taking down the article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.digg.com/?p=73|title=Digg the Blog: What's Happening with HD-DVD Stories?|first=Jay|last=Adelson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some users defended Digg's actions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/31859/97/ |title=Cease and desist letters backfire horribly against AACS |publisher=TGdaily |date=2007-05-01 |accessdate=2009-02-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504015619/http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/31859/97/ |archive-date=2007-05-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://weblog.infoworld.com/railsback/archives/2007/05/digg_losing_con.html |title=Digg losing control of their site |publisher=Weblog.infoworld.com |date= |accessdate=2009-02-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222071122/http://weblog.infoworld.com/railsback/archives/2007/05/digg_losing_con.html |archivedate=2008-12-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sanders |first=Tom |url=http://www.computing.co.uk/vnunet/news/2188970/drm-lobby-tries-hd-dvd-genie |title=DRM lobby tries to get HD DVD genie back into the bottle |publisher=Computing.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a whole the community staged a widespread revolt with numerous articles and comments being made using the encryption key.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=7129|title=DailyTech: AACS Key Censorship Leads to First Internet Riot|first=Marcus|last=Yam|accessdate=2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6615047.stm|title=BBC News: DVD DRM row sparks user rebellion|accessdate=2007-05-02 | date=2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of the user response was so great that one of the Digg users referred to it as a "digital [[Boston Tea Party]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070504173353/http://www.forbes.com/technology/2007/05/02/digital-rights-management-tech-cx_ag_0502digg.html Forbes.com], Digg's DRM Revolt&lt;/ref&gt; The response was also directly responsible for Digg reversing the policy and stating: "But now, after seeing hundreds of stories and reading thousands of comments, you've made it clear. You'd rather see Digg go down fighting than bow down to a bigger company. We hear you, and effective immediately we won't delete stories or comments containing the code and will deal with whatever the consequences might be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://blog.digg.com/?p=74 | title =Digg This: 09 F9 &lt;nowiki&gt;[...]&lt;/nowiki&gt; | accessdate =2007-05-02 | first =Kevin | last = Rose | authorlink =Kevin Rose | date =2007-05-01 | work =Digg the Blog | publisher =Digg Inc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Digg v4 revolt and migration to Reddit====
When [[Digg]] redesigned their website in 2010 the community revolted and used the platform to advertise a user migration to the competitor, [[reddit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mashable.com/2010/08/30/users-revolt-against-new-digg/#6EazsZdx.aqO |title=Users Revolt Against New Digg |first=Vadim |last=Lavrusik |work=mashable.com |date=30 August 2010 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mashable.com/2011/01/03/reddit-2010-growth/#fdhicYEKeuqr |title=Reddit Grew 230% in 2010 at Digg's Expense |first=Ben |last=Parr |work=mashable.com |date=3 January 2011 |accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://readwrite.com/2010/08/30/digg_user_rebellion_reddit_on_front_page |title=Digg User Rebellion Continues: Reddit Now Rules the Front Page - ReadWrite |first=Frederic |last=Lardinois |work=readwrite.com |date=30 August 2010 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2012/07/23/with-digg-on-the-wane-where-are-its-former-power-users |title=With Digg on the Wane, Where Are its Former Power Users? |first=Simons |last=Owens |work=usnews.com |date=23 July 2012 |accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2012/07/13/facebook-didnt-kill-digg-reddit-did/ |title=Facebook Didn't Kill Digg, Reddit Did |first=Paul |last=Tassi |work=forbes.com |date=13 July 2012 |accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/technology/pda/2010/aug/31/digg-redesign-revolt |title=Digg users revolt after redesign |first=Josh |last=Halliday |work=theguardian.com |date=31 August 2010 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2010/08/reddit-digg.html |title=Reddit considers itself a benefactor of Digg user revolt |first=Mark |last=Milian |work=latimesblogs.latimes.com |date=31 August 2010 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Digg's version 4 release was initially unstable. The site was unreachable or unstable for weeks after its launch on August 25, 2010. Many users, upon finally reaching the site, complained about the new design and the removal of many features (such as bury, favorites, friends submissions, upcoming pages, subcategories, videos and history search).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gigaom.com/2010/08/26/digg-redesign-met-with-a-thumbs-down/ |title=Digg Redesign Met with a Thumbs Down |first1=Mathew, |last1=Ingram |date=August 26, 2010 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin Rose replied to complaints on his blog, promising to fix the algorithm and restore some features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kevinrose.com/blogg/2010/8/27/digg-v4-release-iterate-repeat.html |title=Digg v4: release, iterate, repeat. |first1=Kevin |last1=Rose |date=August 27, 2010 |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexis Ohanian]], founder of rival site [[Reddit]], said in an open letter to Rose:

{{quote|… this new version of digg reeks of [[venture capitalist|VC]] meddling. It's cobbling together features from more popular sites and departing from the core of digg, which was to "give the power back to the people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alexisohanian.com/an-open-letter-to-kevin-rose |title=An open letter to Kevin Rose |first1=Alexis |last1=Ohanian |date=May 28, 2010 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Disgruntled users declared a "quit Digg day" on August 30, 2010, and used Digg's own auto-submit feature to fill the front page with content from Reddit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/digg_user_rebellion_reddit_on_front_page.php |title=Digg User Rebellion Continues: Reddit Now Rules the Front Page |publisher=ReadWriteWeb |first1=Frederic |last1=Lardinois |accessdate=August 31, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831122556/http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/digg_user_rebellion_reddit_on_front_page.php |archive-date=August 31, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2010/08/30/digg-users-lash-out-at-new-format-join-forces-with-reddit/ |title=Digg Users Lash Out At New Format, Join Forces with Reddit |publisher=Time Magazine |accessdate=August 31, 2010 |date=August 30, 2010 |first1=Megan |last1=Friedman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-20015042-36.html?part=rss&amp;amp;subj=news&amp;amp;tag=2547-1_3-0-20 |title=Angry Digg users flood home page with Reddit links |publisher=CNet News |first1=Caroline |last1=McCarthy |accessdate=August 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reddit also temporarily added the Digg shovel to their logo to welcome fleeing Digg users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/30/reddit-digg-rivalry-heats_n_699225.html |title=Angry Users SLAM Digg With Links From Rival Reddit |publisher=The Huffington Post |accessdate=August 31, 2010 |first=Craig |last=Kanalley |date=August 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Reddit#IAmA and AMA}}

On July 2, 2015, Reddit began experiencing a series of blackouts as [[Internet forum#Moderators|moderators]] set popular subreddit communities to private, in an event dubbed "AMAgeddon" – a [[portmanteau]] of AMA ("ask me anything") and [[Armageddon]]. This was done in protest of the recent firing of Victoria Taylor, an administrator who helped organize citizen-led interviews with famous people on the popular "Ask me Anything" subreddit. Organizers of the blackout also expressed resentment about the recent severance of the communication between Reddit and the moderators of subreddits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-33379571 |title=Reddit in uproar after staff sacking |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=3 July 2015 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |access-date=3 July 2015 |quote="About 100 chat sections, or sub-reddits, that together have millions of readers are believed to have been shut. Reddit's only comment about the issue has been to say that it did not talk about 'individual employee matters'. The protests were led by the volunteer moderators of the AMA section, which said in an explanatory posting that they needed Ms Taylor to keep the sub-reddit functioning. Ms Taylor helped organise guests for AMAs and worked to verify that people due to answer questions were who they said they were. There had been no explanation of why she was suddenly sacked, said the administrators."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blackout intensified on July 3 when former [[Online community manager|community manager]] David Croach gave an AMA about being fired.

{{Politics of Brazil}}

The '''Vice President of Brazil''' ({{lang-pt|Vice-Presidente do Brasil}}), officially the '''Vice President of the Federative Republic of Brazil''' (''Vice-Presidente da República Federativa do Brasil''), or simply the ''Vice President of the Republic'' (''Vice-Presidente da República'') is the second-highest ranking government official in the [[Cabinet of Brazil|executive branch]] of the [[Government of Brazil]], preceded only by the [[President of Brazil|president]]. The Vice President's primary role is to replace the president on the event of his or her death, resignation, or [[impeachment]], and to temporarily take over the presidential powers and duties while the President is abroad, or otherwise temporarily unable to carry out his or her duties. The Vice President is elected jointly with the president as his or her [[running mate]].

The office has existed since the [[Proclamation of the Republic (Brazil)|Proclamation of the Republic]] in 1889, although it was only officially instituted as of the 1891 Constitution. It has been in place throughout all of Brazil's republican history, save for the fifteen years of the [[Vargas Era]], when it was abolished.

==Requirements==
The requirements to run for the office of Vice President are exactly those of the Presidency itself. In addition to the ordinary requirements to run for political office in Brazil, under the terms of article 14 of the Constitution, a candidate for the Vice Presidency must be a natural born citizen of Brazil (which under certain circumstances may include the offspring of one or two Brazilian parents living abroad) and be at least 35 years of age.

==Election and tenure==
The [[President of Brazil|President]] and Vice President are elected on a single [[ticket (election)|ticket]] for a four-year term and are inaugurated on 1 January of the year following that of the election. Both may be re-elected for a subsequent term. 

If the Vice President succeeds a sitting President, he or she may be reelected for an additional term.  However, he or she is not eligible to run for a second full term, as under Brazilian law any partial term counts toward the limit of two consecutive terms.  This limit applies whenever the Vice President serves as Acting President when the President is either abroad or suspended from office as a result of impeachment.

==Workplace and official residence==
The Vice President works in an annex building of the [[Palácio do Planalto]]. The official residence of the Vice President is the [[Palácio do Jaburu]], inaugurated in 1977.

==Ascension to the Presidency==
Since the [[Proclamation of the Republic (Brazil)|Proclamation of the Republic]] in 1889, eight Vice Presidents have been called upon to replace former Presidents: four due to death of the incumbent ([[Nilo Peçanha]], [[Delfim Moreira]], [[Café Filho]], and [[José Sarney]]), two due to resignation ([[Floriano Peixoto]] and [[João Goulart]]), and two due to impeachment conviction&lt;ref&gt;President [[Fernando Collor de Mello]] was impeached by the Chamber of Deputies, but resigned before being convicted in the Senate, resulting in Itamar Franco becoming President while the trial of Collor continued (eventually resulting in a conviction and his disqualification from public office for eight years).&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Itamar Franco]] and [[Michel Temer]]).

'''Zubr''' ({{lang-be|ЗУБР}}) was a civic [[youth organization]] in Belarus backed and funded by the United States and western powers in opposition to President [[Alexander Lukashenko|Alyaksandr Lukashenka]]. The organization drew inspiration from [[Otpor!]] student movement (formerly of [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]) which contributed to the overthrow of [[Slobodan Milošević]] in 2000, and from [[Gene Sharp]]'s writings on [[nonviolent resistance|nonviolent action]]. Zubr became noticed internationally in 2005 when US Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]], who was visiting Lithuania, met their leaders &amp;ndash;, who risked imprisonment upon their return.

During the 2006 [[Belarusian presidential election, 2006|presidential election]] Zubr had supported [[Alaksandar Milinkievič]], the opposition [[United Democratic Forces of Belarus]] candidate. After international election monitors criticized the conduct of that election, there were several demonstrations at which protestors flew the Zubr flag next to the first post-independence Belarusian white-red-white tricolour and the EU flag.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/03/E6A3F613-0BF4-4F68-9764-A5CF80CA2EB5.html/  ''Belarus: Protesters Hold Vigil Amid Continuing Crackdown'', Jean-Christophe Peuch, ''Radio Free Europe'', 22 March 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816221859/http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/03/E6A3F613-0BF4-4F68-9764-A5CF80CA2EB5.html |date=16 August 2007 }}.Retrieved on 11 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the elections in 2006, "Zubr" ceased its existence.

== Polish Division of "Zubr" ==
After the elections in 2001, some of activists went to emigration to [[Poland]], where they met Polish enthusiasts of Belarusian opposition. Together, they made in few actions of support and solidarity for Belarusian democrats:

* demonstrations near Belarusian embassy in [[Warsaw]] in the anniversary of disappearances of Belarusian oppositionists, and so-called "Chain of Concerned People"
* spreading of informational leaflets for [[Poles]] about [[Human rights in Belarus]]
* cooperation with Polish youth organizations

Polish Division of "Zubr" was virtually independent from the Belarusian one, but the chosen name had some disadvantages, for ex. Polish organization were trying to contact the central in Belarus to consult common activity, and Belarusians living in Poland, working in organizations not friendly towards "Zubr", were refusing cooperation.

Because of this, the organization decided in November 2003 to transform into an association with more neutral name "Union for Democracy in Belarus".
