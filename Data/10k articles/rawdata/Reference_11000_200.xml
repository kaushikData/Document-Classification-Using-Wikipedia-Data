'''''B v Governor of Brockhill Prison, Ex parte Evans''''', an important case in [[English law]], involved the [[unlawful detention]] of a [[prisoner]]. The [[governor]] had sentenced the prisoner on the basis of an interpretation of a [[statute]] which had originally been supported by the courts, but which had subsequently been held to be wrong. It was clear that the governor was blameless, but the sentence raised questions as to whether the new interpretation of the statute should apply prospectively only. The majority of the [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary|Law Lords]] held that, on the facts of this case, it was not appropriate for the interpretation to apply prospectively only, but all of them also accepted that the development of a rule might, in appropriate circumstances, apply prospectively. [[Gordon Slynn, Baron Slynn of Hadley|Lord Slynn of Hadley]] reasoned that "there may be decisions in which it would be desirable, and in no way unjust, that the effect of judicial rulings should be prospective or limited to certain claimants."

The '''Contemporary Art Museum of Macedonia''' ([[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]: Музеј на современата уметност) is one of the largest and most complete national institution of the [[Republic of Macedonia]]. Located in the capital city of [[Skopje]], the museum was founded in 1963 following the [[1963 Skopje earthquake|disastrous earthquake that hit the city]]. The building project was donated by the [[Polish Government]].

==Collection==
The collection is made up of two segments; international and national. The international segment of the collections reflects the modern art from almost all parts of the world. The larger part of the collection marks the art movements of the 1950s, 1960's and 1970s, although it contains also around a hundred works of the early modern art. The older exhibits are mainly highlighted by works of [[Emil Filla]], [[Fernand Léger]], and [[André Masson]]. The works of the internationally well-known artists are of special importance, such as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Hans Hartung]], [[Victor Vasarely]], [[Alexander Calder]], [[Pierre Soulages]], [[Alberto Burri]], [[Christo]], [[Robert Jacobsen]], [[Etienne Hajdu]], [[Zoltan Kemeny]], [[Robert Adams (sculptor and designer)|Robert Adams]], [[Emilio Vedova]], [[Antoni Clavé]], and [[Georg Baselitz]].&lt;ref name="collection"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msu.mk/international/|title=International Collection|publisher=Museum of Contemporary Art - Skopje, Macedonia|accessdate=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cadets in their fourth class ([[freshman]]) year are expected to learn most of the information from ''Contrails'', and be able to recite much of it verbatim. ''Contrails'' has traditionally been published in the class color—Blue, Silver, Red, or Gold—of the freshman class.

The '''''Dublin Annals of Inisfallen''''' refer to a mid 18th century (c. 1765) compilation of medieval [[Irish annals]] reworked and augmented with material from later traditions in the form of [[interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolations]], made by John O'Brien, [[Bishop of Cloyne]] and the Reverend John Conry. They are to be distinguished from the [[Bodleian]] or true ''[[Annals of Inisfallen]]''.

A translation into [[Latin]] was published in 1825 by [[Charles O'Conor (priest)|Charles O'Conor]], but no complete English translation yet exists. Individual entries have been translated by a variety of scholars.

==Contents==
The ''Dublin Annals of Inisfallen'' are regarded to be among the least reliable of Irish Gaelic annalistic sources, but in some entries may preserve valuable material otherwise lost. The reworked nature of the compilation makes distinguishing the valuable from the worthless very difficult.

[[File:Haupt Conservatory NYBG jeh.jpg|thumb|right|320px|Haupt Conservatory in summer|alt=Dome-shaped glass building]]
The '''Enid A. Haupt Conservatory''' is a [[greenhouse]] in [[the Bronx]], [[New York (state)|New York]], United States, a major part of the [[New York Botanical Garden]] (NYBG). Inspiration for the park and the conservatory stemmed from [[Nathaniel Lord Britton]] and his wife Elizabeth. The couple had visited the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Royal Botanic Garden at Kew]] on their honeymoon and thought a similar park and conservatory should be built for New York City.&lt;ref name="ko62"&gt;{{harvcolnb|Koebner|1997|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NYBG and the Conservatory were the result.

The conservatory was designed by the major greenhouse company of the time, [[Lord and Burnham]] Co. The design was modeled after the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew#Palm House|Palm House]] at the Royal Botanic Garden and [[Joseph Paxton]]'s [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] in Italian Renaissance style.&lt;ref name="ko62"/&gt; Groundbreaking took place on January 3, 1899  and construction was completed in 1902 at a cost of $177,000.&lt;ref name="ko62"/&gt;  The building was constructed by John R. Sheehan under contract for the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]].&lt;ref name="tanner90"&gt;{{harvcolnb|Tanner|1991|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the original construction, major renovations took place in 1935, 1950, 1978, and 1993.&lt;ref name="ko62"/&gt;

By the 1970s, the building was in a state of extreme disrepair and had to be either substantially rebuilt or torn down. [[Enid A. Haupt|Enid Annenberg Haupt]] saved the conservatory from demolition with a $5&amp;nbsp;million contribution for renovation and a $5&amp;nbsp;million endowment for maintenance of the building. A subsequent renovation, which started in 1978, restored the conservatory closer to its original design, which had been compromised during the 1935 and 1950 renovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcolnb|Woods|Swartz Warren|1988|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to her generous contributions, the Conservatory was named the Enid A. Haupt Conservatory in 1978.&lt;ref name="tanner93"&gt;{{harvcolnb|Tanner|1991|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1993 renovation replaced the inner workings of the conservatory. At this time, the mechanical systems to control temperature, humidity, and ventilation were upgraded to computerized systems. The exhibits were also redesigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcolnb|Koebner|1997|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The conservatory serves as a focal point of the park and a center for education. It is a New York City landmark.

==History==
While the creation of the New York Botanical Garden was inspired by Nathaniel and Elizabeth Britton's visit to the Royal Botanical Garden at Kew, its creation was dependent on a complex series of events. As early as 1877, ideas were circulating in New York City to create a botanical garden; funding could not be obtained at the time, although the efforts led to parkland being set aside for future use. Ultimately, authorization to set aside {{convert|250|acre|km2}} specifically for a New York Botanical Garden was received in 1891. The principal officers of the new corporation set up for the garden were [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]], [[Andrew Carnegie]] and [[J.P. Morgan]], with [[Nathaniel Lord Britton]] as the new secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcolnb|Tanner|1991|pp=47–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From this beginning, the NYBG was established:

{{quote|... for the purpose of establishing and maintaining a botanical garden and museum and arboretum therein, for the collection of and culture of plants, flowers, shrubs and trees, the advancement of botanical science and knowledge, and the prosecution of original researches therein and in kindred subjects, for affording instruction in the same, for the prosecution and exhibition of ornamental and decorative horticulture and gardening, and for the entertainment, recreation and instruction of the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcolnb|Tanner|1991|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Conservatory was key to the mission and concept of the NYBG from the beginning. When the master plan for the garden was drawn up, planning for the conservatory began.
The commission to design the Conservatory was given to the greenhouse firm Lord and Burnham very early in the process.&lt;ref name="jones24"/&gt;  The primary designer of the building was William R. Cobb, an architect employed by Lord and Burnham. The new Conservatory was primarily made of steel, cast iron, wood and glass.

The original design remained largely intact until the 1935 and 1950 renovations, which significantly compromised the original design. During these renovations, much of the elaborate decoration was removed. The 1935 renovation, in particular, was described as "an attempt to halt the deterioration of the endangered building and bring it up to the prevailing taste of European Modernism."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcolnb|Beyer Blinder Belle Architects|1990|p=III B-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1978, the Conservatory was in a state of extreme disrepair and was slated for demolition due to a lack of funding for its renovation. Following Enid Annenberg Haupt's endowment, [[Edward Larrabee Barnes]] was the architect for the renovation and the conservatory was renamed the Enid A. Haupt Conservatory.&lt;ref name="tanner93"/&gt;

The most recent renovation was completed by [[Beyer Blinder Belle]] Architects in 1997, and was significant for the interior of the conservatory. The mechanical systems to control temperature, humidity, and ventilation were upgraded to computerized systems. The new systems allow optimal growing conditions for a greater variety of plants. This opportunity led to a redesign of the exhibits, which has remained largely intact. The redesign created a transitioning environment through the pavilions that conveys a trip over mountains from wet western slopes, up through the rainforest and down into the desert.

As the conservatory has evolved, the central principles guiding the NYBG's mission have remained consistent. The park (and the conservatory) continues to serve as a center for education. The conservatory also remains the focal point for the park, and is an element drawing the largest crowds to visit the NYBG. Due to the conservatory's history and success, it was dedicated as a New York City landmark in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcolnb|Dolkart|1998|p=340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==

===Architects{{Anchor|Architecture}}===
The original architect for the conservatory was the greenhouse company Lord and Burnham Co. Lord and Burnham was "the premier glasshouse design and fabrication firm of the time"&lt;ref name="jones24"&gt;{{harvcolnb|Jones|2008|loc=2.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and completed several large commissions in addition to the NYBG Conservatory. Lord and Burnham began as Lord's Horticultural Manufacturing Company, which was founded in 1856 by Frederick A. Lord. His son-in-law William Addison Burnham joined the business in 1872, and its name was changed to Lord &amp; Burnham.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcolnb|Lord and Burnham Co.|1956|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord was a carpenter from Ipswich, Massachusetts. He built himself a greenhouse in 1849 after moving to [[Buffalo, New York]], and was subsequently asked to build greenhouses for others. He built greenhouses as a side job, until opening his own company. In 1870, Lord moved to [[Irvington, New York]] to be closer to his clients. Much of his early work consisted of greenhouses for large private estates along the Hudson River.

In 1877, Lord and Burnham was contracted to build a conservatory in [[Golden Gate Park]] in [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]]. This was one of the firm's first public works and led to many future projects. Jay Gould, the railroad tycoon, made an order in 1881 for several greenhouses to be constructed in Irvington. The greenhouses built on his estate were said to be the first steel-frame glass houses constructed in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcolnb|Lord and Burnham Co.|1956|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to their embrace of new materials, Lord and Burnham was innovative in the development of boilers (which were a key part of the greenhouses' functioning).

Lord and Burnham was awarded the commission to design the conservatory in 1896.&lt;ref name="jones24"/&gt; William R. Cobb was the architect working for Lord and Burnham who was in charge of the design of the conservatory.  He was a noted horticultural designer and served as the first vice president, secretary, and general sales manager of Lord and Burnham. As a designer for Lord and Burnham, Cobb designed many parks, conservatories, and private estates throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcolnb|Cobb|1934|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Site and context===
The original architect for the NYBG was [[Calvert Vaux]] (co-designer of [[Central Park]]). He served as an adviser during the formulation of the preliminary design along with [[Samuel Parsons]]. The plan they developed together was submitted in 1896 (shortly after Vaux's death), and was ultimately followed almost exactly.  A notable exception of deviation from this plan was the location of the conservatory, which was the only major element not built on the site shown in the Vaux plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcolnb|Jones|2008|loc=1.14-1.17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time the land was secured for the park nearly until the Conservatory construction began, the placement of the conservatory within the park was heavily debated. The advisory committee of the Parks Department favored a formal spatial arrangement of buildings within the park, while the NYBG disagreed; they believed greater separation of the buildings would ease the management and supervision of crowds. Ultimately, the conservatory was placed away from other buildings in the park. At the time this was an unusual arrangement, as the conservatory had no axial or visual connection to the museum or any other buildings in the park.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcolnb|Jones|2008|loc=2.4-2.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site chosen in 1898 was an open field; some have suggested this open site was chosen to save existing trees.  Additionally, the chosen site placed the conservatory in a location where the building is visible from the boundary streets along the south and west of the park. Southern Boulevard and other adjacent streets were realigned and reorganized when the site was developed. The arrangement created visibility of the conservatory from the road and presented the building as a public icon, relationships which still remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcolnb|Jones|2008|loc=6.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Equally important to the overall placement of the building within the park was the development of the immediately surrounding gardens. The adjacent gardens were considered important supporting resources to the conservatory, and also related to the geometry of the building. "The elaborate, multiple domes style of the Conservatory and its topographic position above the surrounding grades dictated the clean lines and geometries of the surrounding paths, sloping terraces, and planting beds, further integration building and setting".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcolnb|Jones|2008|loc=6.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the adjacent garden elements were formal, geometric, and orthogonal to reflect the architecture of the Conservatory.

===Materials and methods===
[[File:Ny-botanical-haupt-conservatory.JPG|thumb|right|300px|In 2008]]
The main materials used in the construction of the conservatory were steel and glass, in addition to a range of materials used for the base, ornament, and waterproofing. The main structure of the building was made of steel although a few of the pavilions had wrought iron columns. Also, wood beams were used in some locations. Later renovations to the building altered some aspects of the structure. For example, many steel elements were replaced and wood beams were replaced with steel.&lt;ref name="bbbap iii58"&gt;{{harvcolnb|Beyer Blinder Belle Architects|1990|pp=III D-5–III D-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glazing was clearly the other major element in the conservatory. Standardized sized glass panes were used to the greatest extent possible, with {{convert|16|in|mm|adj=on}} panels cut to length in all pavilions except the Palm House (the main pavilion.) The Palm House incorporated {{convert|20|in|mm|adj=on}} glass. All pavilions called for second quality French and American glass. Additionally, clear and ground glass was used depending on the orientation of the glass. All vertical glass was left clear while certain portions of the roof glass were ground.  However, the ground glass was not alone sufficient to provide shading and additional means were employed which would allow for modification depending on seasonal conditions. Stipling and waterproof movable shades were used for additional shade control.&lt;ref name="bbbap iii58"/&gt;

In addition to the structural and glazing systems, a variety of other materials were used for the base of the building, the waterproofing, ornament, and other secondary functions. Bluestone, Buff Bedford Stone, North River brick, and Tennessee marble were used for the masonry work. For leaders and gutters throughout most of the building, copper flashing was used. In some areas cast iron was used for the gutter system. Cast iron was also used for sills, friezes, columns, railings, mullions, transom bars, and snowguards.&lt;ref name="bbbap iii58"/&gt;

While the conservatory has undergone many renovations since the original construction, the same palette of materials has generally been maintained. However, the building systems behind what visitors see have been greatly altered in major efforts to maintain the best possible environment for the plants inside. Though technology has advanced greatly, the commitment to state-of-the-art systems has remained unchanged since the earliest boiler systems installed by Lord and Burnham.

===Form and use===
The conservatory form developed as a combination of the latest technologies in greenhouse design and more traditional ideas of ornament. The overall shape and layout of the building is geared both towards the functional aspects of the interior greenhouse spaces as well as creating a monumental form from the exterior to portray the significance of the building. Lord and Burnham made heavy use of ornament at the conservatory and was a trademark aspect of their civic and public conservatories. The heavy ornamentation here and in other buildings at the time was an essential element in defining the building's status and historical appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcolnb|Beyer Blinder Belle Architects|1990|p=III D-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building is a series of large glass pavilions that are all very open on the inside (typical of greenhouses). The pavilions are laid out symmetrically around the large central Palm House pavilion.  In plan the building is divided into eleven pavilions, where each pavilion has a distinct geometry defining it in relationship to adjacent pavilions. Together the pavilions form a {{convert|512|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} "C"-shape with the central pavilion (with its {{convert|90|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} grand dome) in the center.&lt;ref name="tanner90"/&gt;  The use of ornament creates a hierarchy among the pavilions.  The central dome is the most elaborate, followed by the corner and end pavilions. The interconnecting pavilions are the least ornamented.

Functionally, each pavilion houses a different group of plants representing various conditions found around the globe. The configuration of the building into distinct pavilions allows for each of these global regions to be treated separately in terms of the temperature and humidity maintained for the plants. While the collections have changed over time, the basic concept of display has remained fairly consistent. The base collection is generally permanent, with additional plants brought in for special exhibitions throughout the year. For example, there is an extensive orchid show every spring that draws many visitors to the Conservatory. During the orchid show, thousands of orchids are brought in and are incorporated into the existing collection.

The conservatory is a major resource in the international study of horticulture as well as a center for learning for the public. For example, every year hundreds of scientists travel to the conservatory to study the rare palm and cacti exhibits. The original goal of the conservatory to serve as a center of learning and to advance knowledge of the art and science of horticulture has remained intact since the opening of the conservatory and park. Additional greenhouses have been built on the grounds of the NYBG to provide additional space for research. These greenhouses are a tremendous resource for scientists while also supporting exhibits in the main Conservatory. As a symbol of the NYBG however, the conservatory remains the main draw of the park and its form has developed an iconic status in New York City and beyond.

==Significance==
Since the opening of the NYBG, the conservatory has been a tremendous resource for the community in the New York City area as well as for the global scientific community. The public focus of this conservatory was an important step in the larger history of greenhouses, especially at the time of its construction. Around 1900, greenhouses were a privilege only for the upper classes and carried with them a great air of exclusivity. The explosion of greenhouses across the world was due to a variety of influences. Colonial expansion and expanding worldwide travel at the turn of the century brought with it a certain mania for people to bring exotic flora into their lives, and the possibility was made complete through the development of the modern greenhouse. The Industrial Revolution resulted in such feats as Paxton's Crystal Palace, which marked the beginning of commercialized greenhouse design and construction. The Enid A. Haupt Conservatory opened up the opportunity for people of all classes to enjoy the greenhouse experience.  Also, as New York City expanded in the nineteenth century, open space became more and more precious. The NYBG as a whole provided a release from the pressures of city life and the Conservatory brought the opportunity for new and exotic experiences wholly outside the routines of everyday life. For the scientific community, the Conservatory has always been a major resource for scientists from all over the world and has helped established the New York Botanical Garden as a leader in horticultural research.  The Enid A. Haupt Conservatory continues to uphold the ideals and traditions from its earliest beginnings and is a tremendous resource for New York City and beyond.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1595">The '''Epistle to Corinth''' was a letter written by the 'brethren' ({{lang-gr|οι αδελφοι}}) of the [[early Christian Church]] in [[Ephesus]] to the church in [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] in [[Achaia (Roman province)|Achaia]], referred to in the [[Acts of the Apostles]], commending the Corinthian church to welcome the preacher [[Apollos]]:
:"And when [Apollos] desired to cross to Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him" ({{bibleverse||Acts|18:27|NKJV}}).&lt;ref&gt;This text is the wording of the [[New King James Version]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter is now [[Lost work#Lost works referenced in the New Testament|lost]].

English biblical [[English translations of the bible|translators]] differ in their interpretation of the 'encouraging' ({{lang-gr|προτρεψάμενοι}}) role of the letter, as it can be interpreted as encouraging Apollos (e.g. the [[American Standard Version|ASV]] translation: "the brethren encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples ..."), or as encouraging the Corinthian church (e.g. the [[Modern English Version]]: "the brothers wrote to encourage the disciples to welcome him"). The [[Pulpit Commentary]] suggests it is "rather more consonant to the structure of the sentence and to the probability of the case that the exhortation was addressed to the Corinthian Church, and not to Apollos, who needed no such encouragement".&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/18.htm Pulpit Commentary on Acts 18], accessed 3 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6523">The '''Free Flow of Information Act''' is a bill intended to provide a news reporter with the right to refuse to testify as to information or sources of information obtained during the newsgathering and dissemination process.

While numerous U.S. states have [[shield law]]s, the federal government has no such law.  The bill is an effort to enact a shield law at the federal level.

The bill was introduced to the [[United States Senate]] by Sens. [[Richard Lugar]] and [[Chris Dodd]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dodd.senate.gov/index.php?q=node/3862|title=Lugar, Dodd introduce Free Flow of Information Act|accessdate=2008-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was proposed in its current form by Sen. [[Arlen Specter]].&lt;ref name=gt-1&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 2102 (110th): Free Flow of Information Act of 2007|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/s2035|work=GovTrack.Us|accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, the Free Flow of Information Act was passed by the [[United States House of Representatives]].  However, It was filibustered (failed cloture) on Jul 30, 2008, and withdrawn.&lt;ref name=gt-1/&gt;

In the 2007-08 Senate version, it would not act as an unqualified immunity for journalists.  Instead, federal judges would be allowed to declare certain news stories as having a public interest based on information obtained from confidential sources during the newsgathering process.

More than 50 media companies and organizations support the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aan.org/news/federal_shield_law_is_passed_by_house_of_representatives/Aan/ViewArticle?oid=195310|title=Federal Shield Law is Passed by House of Representatives|accessdate=2008-04-04|publisher=[[Association of Alternative Newsweeklies|AAN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Presidency of George W.

Bush]] opposed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,346228,00.html|title=Administration Launches Web Site Opposing Journalist Media Shield|accessdate=2008-04-04|publisher=[[FoxNews.com]] | date=2008-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Speaking to the [[Associated Press]] annual meeting in Washington, D.C. on April 14, 2008, Senator [[John McCain]], the 2008 Republican nominee for president, said "Despite concerns I have about the legislation, I have narrowly decided to support it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/news/2008/04/mccain041408.html|title=Remarks By John McCain To The Associated Press' Annual Meeting|date=2008-04-14|accessdate=2008-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are fears, however, that the act may be adopted in such a way as to exclude people who are not "professional" journalists, which would in turn serve to effectively shut down investigative reporting by small and independent media sources.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vice.com/read/the-new-media-shield-law-only-shields-corporate-media A new media shield law would only shield corporate media], ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'', 22 Aug 2013. Retrieved 23 Aug 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013 the [[White House]] was pushing for a federal media shield law, the Free Flow of Information Act,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Free Flow of Information Act of 2009|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:S.448:|publisher=[[THOMAS|Thomas]]|accessdate=18 July 2013|author=Charles Schumer and Lindsey Graham}}&lt;/ref&gt; authored by U.S. Senators [[Charles Schumer]] and [[Lindsey Graham]]. Under the bill, the scope of protection for reporters would vary according to whether it was a civil case, an ordinary criminal case or a national security case. The greatest protection would be given to civil cases, in which litigants seeking to force reporters to testify or trying to obtain their calling information would be required to show why their need for the information outweighed the public's interest in unfettered news gathering. Ordinary criminal cases would work in a similar fashion, except the burden would be on the reporter seeking to quash the subpoena to show by a "clear and convincing" standard that the public interest in the free flow of information should prevail over the needs of law enforcement. Cases involving the disclosure of classified information would be more heavily tilted toward the government. Judges could not quash a subpoena through a balancing test if prosecutors presented facts showing that the information sought might help prevent a terrorist attack or other acts likely to harm national security. The legislation would create a presumption that when the government is seeking calling records from a telephone carrier, the news organization would be notified ahead of time, allowing it to fight the subpoena in court. But the bill would also allow the government to seek a 45- to 90-day delay in notification if a court determines that such notice would threaten the integrity of the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Savage|first=Charlie|title=Criticized on Seizure of Records, White House Pushes News Media Shield Law|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/16/us/politics/under-fire-white-house-pushes-to-revive-media-shield-bill.html?_r=0#h|accessdate=18 July 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation would also include an exception where journalists could be subpoenaed if it means national security is at risk. "Now, it's important to remember: virtually the only time the government subpoenas reporters, it involves leak investigations into stories by national security reporters. So it's hard to see how this bill will significantly help improve press freedom," wrote Trevor Timm, an activist with the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] and a board member of the [[Freedom of the Press Foundation]]. "Worse, there's a strong argument that passing the bill [...] will weaken rights reporters already have and make it easier for the government to get sources from reporters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama's media shield law makes prosecuting journalists even easier|url=http://rt.com/usa/obama-shield-bill-law-453/|accessdate=18 July 2013|newspaper=Russia Today|date=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ITRF-Fundamental-u.Satellitenstationen,46 po.jpg|thumb|ITRF reference stations]]
The '''International Terrestrial Reference System''' ('''ITRS''') describes procedures for creating [[frame of reference|reference frame]]s suitable for use with measurements on or near the Earth's surface. This is done in much the same way that a [[Standard (metrology)|physical standard]] might be described as a set of procedures for creating a ''realization'' of that standard. The ITRS defines a [[geocentric]] system of coordinates using the [[SI]] system of measurement.

An '''International Terrestrial Reference Frame''' ('''ITRF''') is a realization of the ITRS. New ITRF solutions are produced every few years, using the latest mathematical and surveying techniques to attempt to realize the ITRS as precisely as possible. Due to [[experimental error]], any given ITRF will differ very slightly from any other realization of the ITRF. The difference between the latest [[World Geodetic System|WGS84]] and the latest ITRF is only a few centimeters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://clynchg3c.com/Technote/geodesy/coorddef.pdf|first=James R. |last=Clynch |title=Earth coordinates |date=February 2006 |website=GPS Geodesy and Geophysics |publisher=James R. Clynch |accessdate=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practical navigation systems are in general referenced to a specific ITRF solution, or to their own coordinate systems which are then referenced to an ITRF solution.
The ITRS and ITRF solutions are maintained by the [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] ([[IERS]]). 

The ''Galileo Terrestrial Reference Frame'' (''GTRF'') is used for the [[Galileo_(satellite_navigation)|Galileo]] navigation system; currently defined as ITRF2005.
GTRF is defined by the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA).

'''A Kenneth Hudson''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE|FSA}}  (4 July 1916  –  28 December 1999), generally known as '''Kenneth Hudson''', was a journalist, anti-museologist, broadcaster and book author.

==Early career==
He was born in [[Harlesden]] and educated at the Lower School of John Lyon (now [[The John Lyon School]]) in [[Harrow, London|Harrow]] and at [[University College London]]. In the [[Second World War]] he registered as a [[conscientious objector]], serving in the [[Friends' Ambulance Unit]].  After the Second World War he worked in Germany in the ''[[Entnazifizierung]]'' campaign.

He became a lecturer in [[adult education]] at the [[University of Bristol]] in 1947, moving to the [[BBC]] in Bristol in 1954 as a radio talks producer and industrial correspondent. In 1966 he joined the staff of Bristol College of Science and Technology, which later became the University of Bath, to set up an educational television service.

==Later career==
As a journalist and museologist, he was a controversial character of the European museum scene and inventor of the term "industrial archaeology" in the 1960s, a broadcaster and the author of numerous books. In 1963 he wrote one of the first books on the subject, ''Industrial Archaeology: An Introduction'', and in 1965 his ''Industrial Archaeology of Southern England''. He was the first editor of the ''Journal of Industrial Archaeology'' in which, with others, he produced an annual review of the rapidly growing literature. In 1972 he published his book on ''Building Materials'' in the Longmans IA series, and in 1979 he co-wrote, with [[Julian Pettifer]], ''Diamonds in the Sky'', the result of historical research on the social history of air travel for the BBC television series of the same name.

The latter part of his career was largely devoted to work on the public level of museums, producing gazetteers such as the classic ''Cambridge Guide to Museums of Britain and Ireland'' (1987) on which he collaborated with Ann Nicholls.

Together with John Letts he founded the [[European Museum of the Year Award]] in 1977, later to become the [[European Museum Forum]], aimed at stimulating the international interchange of ideas and creating networks of inspiration.

==The Hudson Gallery, Museum of Bath at Work (UK)==
The Hudson Gallery at the [[Museum of Bath at Work]] was opened on 4 July 2007. Part of the exhibition is the result of contact with ten historical societies which each submitted four images and 100 words of text they felt best described their area. Other exhibits include the cabinet-making industry in the city and local inventors. Kenneth Hudson was one of the original trustees of the museum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2148">The '''''Kohl Briefmarken-Handbuch''''' was a seminal work of [[philatelic literature]] first published in Germany in 1923 as the 11th edition of the previous well known ''Handbuch'' published by [[Paul Kohl]] of [[Chemnitz]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James Benjamin Seymour|J.B. Seymour]], ''The Stamps of Great Britain, Part One'', The Royal Philatelic Society London, 1950, Introduction, p.v.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production of the work ==
The work was edited by the renowned [[philatelist]] Dr [[Herbert Munk]] who was supported in his endeavours by the ''Verein der Freunde des Kohl-Briefmarkenhandbuchs, e.V.'', whose members were a group of international philatelists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stamps.org/Almanac/alm_halloffame_2005-09.htm#Munk Profile of Dr. Herbert Munk in the American Philatelic Society Hall of Fame.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== English language publication ==
The [[Collectors Club of New York]] acquired the American rights to the work and several sections were translated and published in their journal ''The Collectors Club Philatelist''.

The English rights were acquired by the [[Royal Philatelic Society London]] (RPSL) and the Handbuch formed the basis for important parts of the society's multi-volume work ''The Stamps of Great Britain''. This was only appropriate as much of the Great Britain section in the Handbuch had been prepared from material supplied by the RPSL member [[James Benjamin Seymour|J.B. Seymour]] who had one of the greatest collections of British stamps at the time.

== Awards ==
Seymour and Munk were given the [[Sieger Medal]] for their collaboration on Great Britain in the Handbuch which was considered the best philatelic work in the German language in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukphilately.org.uk/bpt/whowaswho/whowaswho-s.htm Who Was Who In British Philately, profile of J.B. Seymour.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305110805/http://www.ukphilately.org.uk/bpt/whowaswho/whowaswho-s.htm |date=2009-03-05 }} &lt;/ref&gt; And in 1936 Munk won the [[Crawford Medal]] of the RPSL for his editorial work on the Handbuch.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2835">'''''Law Society of the Cape of Good Hope v Windvogel''''' is an important case in South African law, in particular in the area of [[civil procedure]].

== Facts ==
The Law Society applied for a notice of motion to [[Disbarment|strike Windvogel's name from the roll of attorneys]], because he had misappropriated funds entrusted to him as a ''curator bonis'' and had also failed to keep [[bookkeeping|proper books]] of his [[trust account]] transactions.

Windvogel had taken too long to enter his notice of intention to defend, and applied for postponement of the applications to have his name [[Disbarment|struck off the roll of lawyers]], as well as the interdict for him to stop working.

== Argument ==
At trial, Windvogel admitted to having been negligent and careless with his trust account transactions. He put forward all manner of excuses to explain why clients' money had found its way into his personal account.

== Judgment ==
The court found that the question of fitness is a discretionary one. It found, therefore, that Windvogel was not a fit and proper person to be allowed to continue practising as an attorney.

As to the issue of costs, the applicant sought an order for costs against the respondent on the scale as between an attorney and his own client. A court will not normally direct the precise method of taxation of costs, but will generally order costs to be taxed on a party-and-party or on an attorney-and-client scale.

The court considered that an attorney-client cost order may be issued after considering the circumstances surrounding the case, the conduct of the losing party and whether the court finds it just to make such an order. The court considered cases from its division in the past in which it had awarded similar costs and held that "the reason for such a cost order is that the Law Society is a statutory body which obtains its funding from its members and if a member strays to the extent that it becomes necessary for the Law Society to apply for his removal or for his suspension, there is no reason why any of the members of the association to which the respondent belonged should be out of pocket as a result of his conduct."

Accordingly, the court ordered costs on an attorney-client basis.

As to the issue of taxation, the court noted that, before the amount of an attorney-and-client bill can be recovered, it must first be taxed against that latter party. When the other party to the litigation is required to pay costs, the taxation will not be as generous as where an attorney's own client is to pay that attorney's costs.

'''''Le Répertoire de la Cuisine''''' is a professional [[reference book|reference]] [[cookbook]] written by Théodore Gringoire and Louis Saulnier and published originally in 1914, and translated into multiple languages. It is intended to serve as a quick reference to ''[[Le guide culinaire]]'' by Saulnier's mentor, [[Auguste Escoffier]], and adds a significant amount of Saulnier's own material.

==History==

Louis Saulnier, a student of [[Auguste Escoffier]], wrote the ''Répertoire'' as a guide to his mentor's cooking as documented in ''[[Le Guide Culinaire]]''. It is a standard reference for classical French [[haute cuisine]] and has been translated into English (1924) and Spanish (2012).&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Pérez, translator, Gallo Press; 1st edition, 2012, {{isbn|9942117458}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1976 American edition has an introduction by [[Jacques Pépin]].

In [[Michael Ruhlman]]'s 2009 book ''Ratio'', [[Culinary Institute of America]] instructor Uwe Hestnar cited ''La répertoire'' alongside [[Larousse Gastronomique]] and the works of Escoffier and [[Carême]] as required reading for anyone interested in classical French cooking.&lt;ref&gt;Ruhlman, Michael. ''Ratio: The Simple Codes Behind the Craft of Everyday Cooking''. New York: Scribner, 2009, {{ISBN|978-1416566113}}. p xxii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
The style of ''Le Répertoire'' is highly condensed, even in comparison with the brevity of its inspiration; the recipes provided are little more than simple descriptions of dishes, and assume a great deal of background knowledge. The structure of the book itself is based on Escoffier's original to simplify cross-referencing.

'''Little people''' have been part of the folklore of many [[cultures]] in [[human history]], including [[Ireland]], [[Greece]], the [[Philippines]], the [[Hawaii]]an Islands, [[Flores|Flores Island]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]].

[[File:Iroquois fairies from Stories the Iroquois Tell Their Children by Mabel Powers 1917.jpg|thumb|Native American "Little People" from ''Stories the Iroquois Tell Their Children'' by Mabel Powers, 1917]]

==Native American folklore==
The [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native peoples of North America]] told legends of a race of "little people" who lived in the woods near sandy hills and sometimes near rocks located along large bodies of water, such as the [[Great Lakes]]. Often described as "hairy-faced dwarfs" in stories, [[petroglyph]] illustrations show them with horns on their head and traveling in a group of 5 to 7 per canoe.&lt;ref&gt;Furtman, Michael. 2000. ''Magic on the Rocks''. Birch Portage Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:How Morning Star Lost her Fish - from Stories the Iroquois Tell Their Children by Mabel Powers 1917.jpg|thumb|"How Morning Star Lost Her Fish", from ''Stories the Iroquois Tell Their Children'' by Mabel Powers, 1917]]

Native legends often talk of the little people playing pranks on people, such as singing and then hiding when an inquisitive person searches for the music. It is often said that the little people love children and would take them away from bad or abusive parents or if the child was without parents and left in the woods to fend for themselves.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Other legends say the little people if seen by an adult human would beg them not to say anything of their existence and would reward those who kept their word by helping them and their family out in times of need. From tribe to tribe there are variations of what the little people's mannerisms were like, and whether they were good or evil may be different. 

One of the common beliefs is that the little people create distractions to cause mischief. They were believed to be gods by some. One North American Native tribe believed that they lived in nearby caves.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} The caves were never entered for fear of disturbing the little people.

Legends of physical remains of tiny people being found in various locations in the western United States, particularly [[Montana]] and [[Wyoming]], typically describe the remains as being found in caves with various details such as descriptions that they were "perfectly formed", dwarf-size, etc. [[Archeologist]] Lawrence L. Loendorf notes that "The burials, of course, are always sent to a local university or to the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]] for analysis, only to have both the specimens and research results disappear."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Loendorf| first=Lawrence L.| title=Mountain Spirit: The Sheep Eater Indians of Yellowstone| year=2006| publisher=University of Utah Press| isbn=978-0874808681| page=90| author2=Nancy Medaris Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loendorf also suggests that the discovery of two [[mummy|mummies]] of [[anencephalic]] infants in the first half of the twentieth century with deformities that caused some people to believe they were adults has "contributed to public belief in the existence of a group of tiny prehistoric people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Loendorf| first=Lawrence L.| title=Mountain Spirit: The Sheep Eater Indians of Yellowstone| year=2006| publisher=University of Utah Press| isbn=978-0874808681| page=189| author2=Nancy Medaris Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A graveyard unearthed in the 1830s in [[Coshocton County, Ohio]], was believed to contain skeletons belonging to a [[pygmy]] race. In fact, the graves (which were roughly {{convert|3|ft}} long) were "bone burials" containing disarticulated or bent bones packed together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Squier| first=Ephraim George| title=Aboriginal Monuments of New York| origyear=1849| year=1984| publisher=Sourcebook Project| isbn=978-0915554157| page=130| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y_7n5wA3mOwC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=Coshocton,+bones%7Cskeletons&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UMcxUoHpFbLL0AXz9ICoDg&amp;ved=0CHAQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Coshocton%2C%20bones%7Cskeletons&amp;f=false| authorlink=E.

The Native American little people have been said to reside in the [[Pryor Mountains]] of Montana and Wyoming. The Pryors are famous for their "[[fairy ring]]s" and strange happenings. Some members of the Crow tribe consider the little people to be sacred ancestors and require leaving an offering for them upon entry to the area.&lt;ref&gt;Cheung, Theresa. 2006.

==Memegwaans==

Ojibwe myths also bring up a creature known as the Memegwaans, or Memegwaanswag (Plural), which seems to be different from the more common Little People variation of Memegwesi. According to [[Basil Johnson]], a Memegwaans is a little person without definitive form which is terrified of adult humans. However, it seems to have a soft spot for children and will often approach in the guise of a child any young person who seems upset, injured, scared or lonely and either protect them or keep them company until help arrives. If an adult sees one, they will often cower on the ground, screaming and crying hysterically before vanishing in the blink of an eye. They were also known as protectors of copper mines &amp; were prayed to almost as patron saints of lost children. This is more specific &amp; different from the Memegwesi, which is often simply described as a short, hairy man. &lt;ref&gt; Johnson, Basil "The Manitous: The Spiritual World of the Ojibway". 1996 &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame &amp; Northwest Louisiana History Museum''', located in [[Natchitoches, Louisiana]], is a branch of the [[Louisiana State Museum]].  

The [[Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame]] is dedicated to the history of sports in Louisiana, including the achievements of over 300 Louisiana athletes, coaches and other sports figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame &amp; Northwest Louisiana History Museum|url=http://www.crt.state.la.us/museum/properties/SportsHOF.aspx|publisher=Louisiana Dept. of Culture, Recreation and Tourism|accessdate=20 October 2013}} ''&lt;--Broken link, May 2017.'' &lt;/ref&gt; 

The Northwest Louisiana History Museum examines the area's cultural traditions and history from early native-American civilizations to the present. 

The museum opened in 2013 in a new facility located on [[Cane River Lake]]. Built for $23 million, the building was designed by the firm of Trahan Architects of New Orleans and features sinuous molded stone interiors and earth-colored exterior sheathing in order to evoke the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Louisiana State Museum|url=http://www.trahanarchitects.com/158624/1645131/featured-work/louisiana-state-museum|publisher=Trahan Architects|accessdate=20 October 2013}}''&lt;--Broken link, May 2017.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trahan Architects: Louisiana State Museum + Sports Hall of Fame|url=http://www.designboom.com/architecture/trahan-architects-create-louisiana-state-museum-and-sports-hall-of-fame-lsmshof-in-tribute-to-culture/|publisher=''[[Designboom]]''|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame was first founded by the Louisiana Sports Writers Association in 1958, but it did not have a physical structure until the city Natchitoches and [[Northwestern State University]] addressed the issue in 1971 with an offer of space on the campus. The growing archive of memorabilia was shelved in [[Prather Coliseum]] for 40 years until the opening of the new $23 million Hall of Fame on June 28, 2013.

'''McMahon v Gilberd and Co Ltd''' [1955] NZLR 1206 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding  that open offers to the public cannot be accepted by any party that has been previously informed they are excluded from the offer.&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page={{page needed|date=January 2014}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Gilberd was a cordial manufacture, and it advertise to the public that it would pay a certain amount for every bottle returned to them.

McMahon was one of its bottle suppliers, for which Gilberd paid them a lesser wholesale rate for the return of its bottles, and in its sales dockets, contained a clause confirming that the offer to pay the public was not applicable to them.

Despite this notification, McMahon sought payment for their bottles base  on the higher rate advertised payable to the public. Gilberd refused to pay, claiming that even though their offer was to the public in general, that McMahon was not able to accept the offer, as they had been previously advised that they were not entitled to accept this offer.

==Held==
The court held that McMahon could not accept this offer, and so their claim failed.

{{Nihongo|'''''Megatokyo'''''|メガトーキョー}} (also stylized as '''MegaTokyo''') is an English-language [[webcomic]] created by [[Fred Gallagher (cartoonist)|Fred Gallagher]] and [[Rodney Caston]]. ''Megatokyo'' debuted on August 14, 2000,&lt;ref name="Start"/&gt; and has been written and illustrated solely by Gallagher since July 17, 2002.&lt;ref name="gallaghernews"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gallagher|first=Fred|authorlink=Fred Gallagher (cartoonist)|date= June 17, 2002 |work=Megatokyo | title=the other brick | url= http://www.megatokyo.com/rant/274 | accessdate= May 19, 2006 }} Fred Gallagher's news post announcing Caston's departure.&lt;/ref&gt; Gallagher's style of writing and illustration is heavily influenced by Japanese [[manga]]. ''Megatokyo'' is freely available on its official website.  The stated schedule for updates is Tuesday and Friday, but they typically are posted just once or twice a month on non-specific days (in the beginning a three-per-week schedule of Monday, Wednesday, and Friday was the goal). Recently, this schedule has slipped further, due to the health issues of Sarah Gallagher (Seraphim), Fred's wife. ''Megatokyo'' was also published in book-format by [[CMX (comics)|CMX]], although the first three volumes were published by [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]]. For February 2005, sales of the comic's third printed volume were ranked third on BookScan's list of graphic novels sold in bookstores, then the best showing for an [[original English-language manga]].&lt;ref name = "ICV2march2005"/&gt;

Set in a fictional version of Tokyo, ''Megatokyo'' portrays the adventures of Piro, a young fan of [[anime]] and manga, and his friend Largo, an American video game enthusiast. The comic often parodies and comments on the archetypes and clichés of anime, manga, [[dating sim]]s, arcade and video games, occasionally making direct references to real-world works. ''Megatokyo'' originally emphasized humor, with continuity of the story a subsidiary concern. Over time, it focused more on developing a complex plot and the personalities of its characters. This transition was due primarily to Gallagher's increasing control over the comic, which led to Caston choosing to leave the project.&lt;ref name="rodneyversion"&gt;{{cite web|last= Caston|first= Rodney|date= January 18, 2005 | title=The truth about ''Megatokyo''? | url=http://www.rcaston.com/?q=node/71 | accessdate= July 2, 2006}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}} Rodney Caston's version of the events surrounding his departure&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "departurerodney"/&gt; ''Megatokyo'' has received praise from such sources as ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web|last= Hodgman|first= John|date= July 18, 2004|work=The New York Times|title= Chronicle Comics; No More Wascally Wabbits | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9805E2DE123BF93BA25754C0A9629C8B63 | accessdate= April 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while negative criticism of Gallagher's changes to the comic has been given by sources including [[Websnark]].&lt;ref name = "Websnark"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "timewasters"/&gt;

== History ==
''Megatokyo'' began publication as a joint project between [[Fred Gallagher (cartoonist)|Fred Gallagher]] and [[Rodney Caston]], along with a few internet acquaintances. Gallagher and Caston later became business partners, as well. According to Gallagher, the comic's first two strips were drawn in reaction to Caston being "convinced that he and I could do [a webcomic] ... [and] bothering me incessantly about it", without any planning or pre-determined storyline.&lt;ref&gt;''Megatokyo'' book one, pg. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The comic's title was derived from an [[Domain name|Internet domain]] owned by Caston, which had hosted a short-lived gaming news site maintained by Caston before the comic's creation.&lt;ref name="themushroom"&gt;{{cite web | last=Weiser | first=Kevin | date=September 27, 2001 | url=http://www.themushroom.com/20q/megatokyo.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030728181804/http://www.themushroom.com/20q/megatokyo.html | archivedate=2003-07-28 | title=20 Questions with ''Megatokyo'' | accessdate=August 19, 2006 }} Interview with Fred Gallagher and Rodney Caston accessed through archive.org&lt;/ref&gt; With Caston co-writing the comic's scripts and Gallagher supplying its artwork,&lt;ref name="Start"/&gt; the comic's popularity quickly increased,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Reid |first=Calvin | date=February 24, 2003 | title=American Manga Breaks Out | url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20030224/25586-american-manga-breaks-out-.html | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120914102732/http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20030224/25586-american-manga-breaks-out-.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=September 14, 2012 |work=[[Publishers Weekly]] | accessdate=December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; eventually reaching levels comparable to those of such popular webcomics as ''[[Penny Arcade]]'' and ''[[PvP]]''.&lt;ref name=alexa&gt;Alexa traffic rankings for Megatokyo.com,[http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main/megatokyo.com?q=www.megatokyo.com]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} compared to PvPOnline.com [http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main/pvponline.com?q=pvponline.com]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} and Penny-Arcade.com.[http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main/penny-arcade.com?q=penny-arcade.com]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gallagher, ''Megatokyo''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s popularity was not intended, as the project was originally an experiment to help him improve his writing and illustrating skills for his future project, ''[[Fred Gallagher (cartoonist)#Warmth|Warmth]]''.&lt;ref name="popularity"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gallagher |first=Fred |authorlink=Fred Gallagher (cartoonist)| date=January 2, 2006|work=Megatokyo | title=comiket dreamin' | url= http://www.megatokyo.com/index.php?strip_id=803 | accessdate= June 17, 2006 }} Fred Gallagher comments on ''Megatokyo's'' originally experimental status, and mentions that the ''Megatokyo'' books have been translated into German, Italian, French and Polish.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2002, Caston sold his ownership of the title to Gallagher, who has managed the comic on his own since then. In October of the same year, after Gallagher was laid off from his [[day job]] as an architect, he took up producing the comic as a [[full time]] profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://megatokyo.com/index.php?strip_id=329 | first=Fred|last=Gallagher|date=October 30, 2002| title=full time jitters|work=Megatokyo |accessdate=August 16, 2006}}A news post by Fred Gallagher in which he mentions that he has been laid off from work, and announces that he is now working on ''Megatokyo'' full-time.&lt;/ref&gt; Caston's departure from ''Megatokyo'' was not fully explained at the time. Initially, Gallagher and Caston only briefly mentioned the split, with Gallagher publicly announcing Caston's departure on June 17, 2002.&lt;ref name="gallaghernews" /&gt; On January 15, 2005, Gallagher explained his view of the reasoning behind the split in response to a comment made by Scott Kurtz of ''PvP'', in which he suggested that Gallagher had stolen ownership of ''Megatokyo'' from Caston. Calling Kurtz's claim "mean spirited", Gallagher responded:&lt;ref name="departurerodney"&gt;{{cite web|last= Gallagher|first= Fred|date= January 15, 2005|work=Megatokyo | title=more largos?? | url=http://www.megatokyo.com/rant/620 | accessdate= August 26, 2005 }} Fred Gallagher's view of Rodney Caston's departure.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"While things were good at first, over time we found that we were not working well together creatively. There is no fault in this, it happens. I've never blamed Rodney for this creative 'falling out' nor do I blame myself. Not all creative relationships click, ours didn't in the long run."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Four days later, Caston posted his view of the development on his website:&lt;ref name="rodneyversion" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"After this he approached me and said either I would sell him my ownership of MegaTokyo or he would simply stop doing it entirely, and we'd divide up the company's assets and end it all.
This was right before the MT was to go into print form, and I really wanted to see it make it into print, rather [than] die on the vine."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In May 2011, it was announced that ''Endgames'' (a gameworld existing within ''Megatokyo'') was being revamped in a light novel format, with a story written by webfiction author Thomas Knapp, with four light novels planned. A short story "Behind the Masque" was also announced, and released on Amazon's Kindle Store on June 10, 2011.

=== Production ===
[[File:Fred gallagher 2004 MIT.jpg|thumb|right|Creator Fred Gallagher in 2004.]]
''Megatokyo'' is usually hand-drawn in pencil by Fred Gallagher, without any digital or physical "inking". Inking was originally planned, but dropped as Gallagher decided it was unfeasible.&lt;ref name=megatokyobook&gt;''Megatokyo'' book one, pg. 11&lt;/ref&gt; ''Megatokyo''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s first strips were created by roughly sketching on large sheets of paper, followed by [[tracing paper|tracing]], [[Image scanner|scanning]], digital clean-up of the traced comics with [[Adobe Photoshop]], and final touches in [[Adobe Illustrator]] to achieve a finished product.&lt;ref name=megatokyobook2&gt;''Megatokyo'' book one, pg. 148&lt;/ref&gt; Gallagher has stated that tracing was necessary because his sketches were not neat enough to use before tracing.&lt;ref name=megatokyobook3&gt;''Megatokyo'' book one, pg. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the tracing necessary, these comics regularly took six to eight hours to complete.&lt;ref name="megatokyobook3" /&gt; As the comic progressed, Gallagher became able to draw "cleaner" comics without rough lines and tracing lines, and was able to abandon the tracing step. Gallagher believes "that this eventually led to better looking and more expressive comics".&lt;ref name=megatokyobook4&gt;''Megatokyo'' book one, pg. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

''Megatokyo''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s early strips were laid out in four square panels per strip, in a two-by-two square array – a formatting choice made as a compromise between the horizontal layout of American comic strips and the vertical layout of Japanese comic strips.&lt;ref name="reasonforformat"&gt;{{cite web |date= April 18, 2001 | work=Megatokyo | title=Fred Gallagher and Rodney Caston's reasoning for the square panel layout | url=http://www.megatokyo.com/index.php?strip_id=109 | accessdate= May 21, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The limitations of this format became apparent during the first year of ''Megatokyo''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s publication, and in the spring of 2001, the comic switched to a [[manga]]-style, free-form panel layout. This format allowed for both large, detailed drawings and small, abstract progressions, as based on the needs of the script.&lt;ref name="formatchange"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gallagher|first=Fred |date= April 23, 2001 | work=Megatokyo | title=1:1.5 | url=http://www.megatokyo.com/index.php?strip_id=110 | accessdate= May 9, 2006 }} Fred Gallagher details the change of panel layout.&lt;/ref&gt; Gallagher has commented that his drawing speed had increased since the comic's beginning, and with four panel comics taking much less time to produce, it "made sense in some sort of twisted, masochistic way, that [he] could use that extra time to draw more for each comic".&lt;ref name=megatokyobook5&gt;''Megatokyo'' book one, pg. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

''Megatokyo''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s earliest strips were drawn entirely on single sheets of paper. Following these, Gallagher began drawing the comic's panels separately and assembling them in Adobe Illustrator, allowing him to draw more detailed frames. This changed during ''Megatokyo''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s eighth chapter, with Gallagher returning to drawing entire comics on single sheets of paper.&lt;ref name=fullpage2&gt;{{cite web | last=Gallagher | first=Fred | date=October 3, 2006 | url=http://www.megatokyo.com/index.php?strip_id=913 | title=full page, part 2 | accessdate=November 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gallagher stated that this change allowed for more differentiated layouts,&lt;ref name=fullpage&gt;{{cite web | last=Gallagher | first=Fred | date=October 1, 2006 | url=http://www.megatokyo.com/index.php?strip_id=912 | title=full page | accessdate=November 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to allowing him a better sense of momentum during comic creation.&lt;ref name="fullpage2" /&gt;

The strip is currently drawn on inkjet paper in pencil, the text and speech being added later with Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator. In March 2009 he began [http://www.megatokyo.com/fredarting Fredarting], a streaming live video feed of the comic being drawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://megatokyo.com/fredarting_faq |title=Fredarting FAQ |publisher=Megatokyo.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gallagher occasionally has guest artists participate in the production of the comic, including Mohammad F. Haque of ''Applegeeks''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Piro |url=http://megatokyo.com/rant/836 |title=Off to other side of the world |work=MegaTokyo |date=May 27, 2007 |accessdate=2009-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Funding ===
''Megatokyo'' has had several sources of funding during its production. In its early years, it was largely funded by Gallagher and Caston's full time jobs, with the additional support of banner advertisements. A store connected to [[ThinkGeek]] was launched during October 2000 in order to sell ''Megatokyo'' merchandise, and, in turn, help fund the comic.&lt;ref name="firstmegatokyostore"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gallagher|first=Fred |date= October 21, 2000 |work=Megatokyo | title=we have t-shirts... | url=http://www.megatokyo.com/index.php?strip_id=31 | accessdate= May 21, 2006 }} Fred Gallagher announces first ''Megatokyo'' store.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 1, 2004,&lt;ref name="MegaGear"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gallagher|first=Fred|date=August 1, 2004|work=Megatokyo | title=learning to fly | url=http://www.megatokyo.com/index.php?strip_id=589 | accessdate= August 5, 2005 }} Fred Gallagher comments about Megagear's launch status.&lt;/ref&gt; this store was replaced by "Megagear", an independent online store created by Fred Gallagher and his wife, Sarah, to be used solely by ''Megatokyo'', although it now also offers ''Applegeeks'' and ''Angerdog'' merchandise.

Gallagher has emphasized that ''Megatokyo'' will continue to remain on the Internet free of charge, and that releasing it in book form is simply another way for the comic to reach readers,&lt;ref name="megatokyopanel"&gt;{{cite web|date=April 26, 2004 |title=''Megatokyo'' goes to Tokyo – interview with Fred Gallagher |url=http://anime-tourist.com/article.php?sid=701#book2 |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041028191317/http://anime-tourist.com/article.php?sid=701 |archivedate=October 28, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to replacing its webcomic counterpart entirely.&lt;ref name="fredinterview"&gt;{{cite web | last= Curzon|first= Joe|date= January 28, 2004 | title= Interview with Fred Gallagher | url=http://www.digital.anime.org.uk/talkingtopiro1.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040813123907/http://www.digital.anime.org.uk/talkingtopiro1.html | archivedate=2004-08-13 | accessdate= June 4, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he has stated that he is against [[micropayment]]s, as he believes that [[word of mouth]] and public attention are powerful property builders, and that a "pay-per-click" system would only dampen their effectiveness. He has claimed that such systems are a ''superior'' option to direct monetary compensation, and that human nature is opposed to micropayments.&lt;ref name="fredinterview" /&gt;

Much of ''Megatokyo''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s early humor consists of jokes related to the video game [[subculture]], as well as culture-clash issues. In these early strips, the comic progressed at a pace which Gallagher has called "haphazard",&lt;ref name=IGNinterview&gt;{{cite web | date=June 21, 2006 | url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/713/713708p1.html | title=Take a Trip to Megatokyo | accessdate=August 19, 2006 }} IGN interview with Fred Gallagher.&lt;/ref&gt; often interrupted by purely [[Punch line|punchline]]-driven installments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.megatokyo.com/index.php?strip_id=45|title=''Megatokyo'' Strip 45|accessdate=July 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.megatokyo.com/index.php?strip_id=51|title=''Megatokyo'' Strip 51|accessdate=July 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.megatokyo.com/index.php?strip_id=85|title=''Megatokyo'' Strip 85|accessdate=July 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Gallagher gradually gained more control over ''Megatokyo''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s production, the comic began to gain more similarities to the Japanese [[shōjo manga]] that Gallagher enjoys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gallagher|first=Fred|date= June 17, 2002 |work=Megatokyo | title=the other brick | url= http://www.megatokyo.com/index.php?strip_id=273 | accessdate= May 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Gallagher's complete takeover of ''Megatokyo'', the comic's thematic relation to Japanese manga continued to grow.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The comic features characteristics borrowed from anime and manga [[archetype]]s, often [[parody]]ing the medium's clichés.&lt;ref name="fullpage2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=commongripes&gt;{{cite web | last=Gallagher | first=Fred | date=February 2, 2006 | url=http://www.megatokyo.com/index.php?strip_id=819 | title=common gripes | accessdate=November 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include Junpei, a [[ninja]] who becomes Largo's [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]]; Rent-a-zillas, giant monsters based on [[Godzilla]]; the Tokyo Police Cataclysm Division, which fights the monsters with [[Mecha|giant robots]] and supervises the systematic destruction and reconstruction of predesignated areas of the city; [[fan service]];&lt;ref name="fullpage2" /&gt; a Japanese school girl, Yuki, who has also started being a [[magical girl]] in recent comics;&lt;ref name=megatokyobook12&gt;''Megatokyo'' book one, pg. 51&lt;/ref&gt; and Ping, a robot girl.&lt;ref name=megatokyobook11&gt;''Megatokyo'' book one, pg. 156&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Dom and Ed, [[hitman|hitmen]] employed by [[Sega]] and [[Sony]], respectively, are associated with a Japanese stereotype that all Americans are heavily armed.&lt;ref name=megatokyobook10&gt;''Megatokyo'' book one, pg. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Characters in ''Megatokyo'' usually speak Japanese, although some speak English, or English-based [[leet|l33t]]. Typically, when a character is speaking Japanese, it is signified by enclosing English text between [[angle bracket]]s (&lt;&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;''Megatokyo'' book one, pg. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Not every character speaks every language, so occasionally characters are unable to understand one another. In several scenes (such as [http://www.megatokyo.com/strip/716 this one]), a character's speech is written entirely in [[Romanization of Japanese|rōmaji]] Japanese to emphasize this.

''Megatokyo'' is divided into chapters. Chapter 0, which contains all of the comic's early phase, covers a time span in the comic of about six weeks. Each of the subsequent chapters chronicles the events of a single day. Chapter 0 was originally not given a title, although the book version retroactively dubbed it "Relax, we understand j00."&lt;ref&gt;''Megatokyo'' book one, pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Between the chapters, and occasionally referenced in the main comic, are a number of [[omake]].

=== Piro ===
'''Piro''', the [[protagonist]], is an [[author surrogate]] of Fred Gallagher. Gallagher has stated that Piro is an idealized version of himself when he was in college.&lt;ref name=piroidealized&gt;{{cite web | date=June 8, 2006|work=Megatokyo | first=Fred | last=Gallagher | title=i'll take my art back now | url=http://www.megatokyo.com/index.php?strip_id=868 | accessdate=June 20, 2006}} A news post by Fred Gallagher in which he states that the character "Piro" is an idealized version of himself (Gallagher) when he was in college.&lt;/ref&gt; As a character, he is socially inept and frequently depressed.

In the story, Piro has extreme difficulty understanding ''Megatokyo''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s female characters, making him for the most part ignorant of the feelings that the character Nanasawa Kimiko has for him, though he has become much more aware of her attraction as the series progressed. Gallagher has commented that Piro is the focal point of emotional damage, while his friend, Largo, takes the physical damage in the comic.&lt;ref name=thepulseinterview2&gt;{{cite web|last=Contino |first=Jennifer |date=September 5, 2002 |url=http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&amp;f=36&amp;t=000120 |title=''Megatoky's Fred Gallagher'' |accessdate=August 18, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050816121929/http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&amp;f=36&amp;t=000120 |archivedate=August 16, 2005 |df= }}An interview with Fred Gallagher at The Pulse&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Largo ===
'''Largo''' is the comic's secondary protagonist, and the comic version of co-creator [[Rodney Caston]]. An impulsive alcoholic whose speech is rendered in [[L33t]] frequently, he serves as one of the primary sources of [[comic relief]]. A technologically gifted character, he is obsessed with altering devices, often with hazardous results. Gallagher designed Largo to be the major recipient of the comic's physical damage.&lt;ref name="thepulseinterview2" /&gt; Largo's name comes from Caston's online nickname, which refers to the villain from ''[[Bubblegum Crisis]]''.&lt;ref name = nameorigins/&gt; For various reasons (including fire and battle damage) he often ends up wearing very little clothing. Largo seems to have awkwardly blundered into a relatively successful relationship with Hayasaka Erika at the current time in the comic.

=== Hayasaka Erika ===
{{Nihongo|'''Hayasaka Erika'''|早坂 えりか}} is a strong-willed, cynical, and sometimes violent character. At the time of the story, she is a former popular [[Japanese idol]] (singer) and [[Seiyū|voice actress]] who has been out of the spotlight for three years, though she still possesses a considerable fanbase. Erika's past relationship troubles, combined with exposure to swarms of [[fanboy]]s, have caused her to adopt a negative outlook on life. Gallagher has implied that her personality was loosely based on the ''[[tsundere]]'' (tough girl) stereotype often seen in anime and manga.&lt;ref name = findingkimiko/&gt;

=== Nanasawa Kimiko ===
{{Nihongo|'''Nanasawa Kimiko'''|七澤 希美子}} is a Japanese girl who previously worked as a waitress at an [[Anna Miller's]] restaurant, and is Piro's romantic interest. At the current point in the story, she is a voice actress for the possibly-failing Lockart game "Sight", playing the main heroine, Kannazuki Kotone. Kimiko is a kind and soft-spoken character, though she is prone to mood-swings, and often causes herself embarrassment by saying things she does not mean. Gallagher has commented that Kimiko was the only female character not based entirely on anime [[stereotype]]s.&lt;ref name=findingkimiko&gt;{{cite web | last=Gallagher | first=Fred | date=January 6, 2005 | url=http://megatokyo.com/rant/617 | title=finding kimiko | accessdate=August 18, 2006 }} Gallagher comments on Kimiko being of original design.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tohya Miho ===
{{Nihongo|'''Tohya Miho'''|凍耶 美穂|Tōya Miho}} is an enigmatic and manipulative young [[Goth subculture|goth]] girl. She is drawn to resemble a "[[Gothic Lolita]]", and is often described as "darkly cute," with Gallagher occasionally describing her as a "perkigoth."&lt;ref name=perkigoth&gt;Gallagher, Fred. ''Megatokyo'' Volume 1. Dark Horse Books, 2004. Pages 90 and 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Miho often acts strangely compared to the comic's other characters, and regularly accomplishes abnormal feats, such as leaping inhuman distances or perching herself atop telephone poles. Despite these displays of ability, it is hinted at that Miho has problems with her health. Little is revealed in the comic about Miho's past or motivations, although Gallagher states that these will eventually be explained. Largo believes that she (Miho) is the queen of the undead, and is the cause of the zombie invasion of Tokyo.&lt;ref name=nameorigins&gt;{{cite web|title=''Megatokyo'' Panel at Akon 13 |url=http://www.anime-tourist.com/article.php?sid=196#about |accessdate=July 5, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041028112909/http://www.anime-tourist.com/article.php?sid=196 |archivedate=October 28, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been hinted that she is a [[magical girl]] who may have some past connection with the zombies.

== Plot ==
{{Plot|section|date=September 2015}}
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
''Megatokyo''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s story begins when Piro and Largo fly to Tokyo after an incident at the [[E³|Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3). Piro has the proper paperwork; Largo must beat the ninja Junpei at a video game to enter.  After a spending spree, the pair are stranded without enough money to buy plane tickets home, forcing them to live with Tsubasa, a Japanese friend of Piro's. When Tsubasa suddenly departs for America to seek his "first true love", the protagonists are forced out of the apartment. Tsubasa leaves Ping, a robot girl [[PlayStation 2]] accessory, in their care. This leads to old friends of Piro and Largo showing up later. The two are shadow operatives for video game companies, Ed (Sony) and Dom (SEGA).

At one point, Piro, confronted with girl troubles, visits the local bookstore to "research"—look in the vast shelves of [[shoujo manga]] for a solution to his problem. A spunky schoolgirl, Sonoda Yuki, and her friends, Asako and Mami, see him sitting amidst piles of read manga, and ask him what he is doing. Piro, flustered, runs away, accidentally leaving behind his bookbag and sketchbook.

After their eviction, Piro begins work at "Megagamers", a store specializing in anime, manga, and video games. His employer allows him and Largo to live in the apartment above the store. Largo is mistaken for the new English teacher at a local school, where he takes on the alias "[[Great Teacher Onizuka|Great Teacher Largo]]" and instructs his students in L33t, video games, and about [[computing|computers]].  Yuki's father, Inspector Sonada Masamichi of the "[[List of Megatokyo characters#Tokyo Police Cataclysm Division|Tokyo Police Cataclysm Division]]" (TPCD) hires Largo after Largo manipulates Ping into stopping a rampaging monster, the drunken turtle Gameru.

As Largo is working at the local high school, Piro encounters Yuki again while working at Megagamers, when she returns his bookbag and sketchbook, scribbled all over with comments about his drawings. She then, to his consternation, asks if he would give her drawing lessons. Piro, flustered, agrees, and promptly forgets about them.

Earlier in the story, Piro had seen Nanasawa Kimiko at an [[Anna Miller's]] restaurant, where she is a waitress, after Tsubasa brought him and Largo there. Later on, Piro encounters Kimiko outside a train station, where she is worrying aloud that she will miss an audition because she has forgotten her money and railcard. Piro hands her his own railcard and walks off before she can refuse his offer. This event causes Kimiko to develop an idealized vision of her benefactor, an image which is shattered the next time they meet. Despite this, she gradually develops feelings for Piro, though she is too shy to admit them. Later on in the story, Kimiko's outburst on a [[Talk radio|radio talk show]] causes her to suddenly rise to idol status. Angered by the hosts' derisive comments about [[fanboy]]s, she comes to the defense of her audience, immediately and unintentionally securing their obsessive adoration. Later, her new horde of fanboys find out where she works and flock to the restaurant, obsessively trying to get pictures [[upskirt|up her skirt]]. Piro works undercover as a busboy to get rid of all cameras. The scene eventually builds to a climax, in which Kimiko shouts at the fanboys and lifts her skirt in defiance, and they take photographs. Piro, provoked by her outburst into actively defending her, threatens the fanboy crowd, and collects all of their [[memory card]]s with the photos. On the way back from the restaurant, Kimiko is suffering from the aftermath of the scene and lashes out at Piro on the subway, which causes him to walk off.

Meanwhile, Largo develops a relationship with Hayasaka Erika, Piro's coworker at Megagamers.  She and Kimiko share a house. As with Piro and Kimiko, Largo and Erika meet by coincidence early in the story. Later, it is revealed that Erika is a former [[Japanese idol|pop idol]], who caused a big scene then disappeared from the public eye after her fiancé left her. When she is rediscovered by her fans, Largo helps thwart a fanboy horde, but not well enough to escape being dismissed by the TPCD for it.  He then offers to help Erika to deal with her "vulnerabilities in the digital plane".  Erika insists on protecting herself, so Largo instructs her in computer-building. This leads into a little more relationship than Largo can handle, partly because he insists all computer building be done in the nude or as close to it as possible, to avoid [[electrostatic discharge|static electrical discharge]] ruining components, and partly because his behavior, crude though it may appear, impresses Erika in many ways.

The enigmatic Tohya Miho frequently meddles in the lives of the protagonists. Miho knows Piro and Largo from the ''Endgames'' [[MMORPG]] previous to ''Megatokyo''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s plot. She abused a hidden statistic in the game to gain control of nearly all of the game's [[player character]]s, but was ultimately defeated by Piro and Largo.  In the comic, Miho becomes close friends with Ping, influencing Ping's relationship with Piro and pitting Ping against Largo in video game battles. Miho is also involved in Erika's backstory; Miho manipulated Erika's fans after Erika's disappearance. This effort ended badly, leaving Miho hospitalized, and the TPCD cleaning up the aftermath. Most of the exact details of what happened are left to the readers' imagination, as are her current motivations and ultimate goal.  Miho and many of the events surrounding her involve a club in Harajuku, the Cave of Evil (CoE).

After getting yelled at for retaining her waitress job, Kimiko quits her voice acting job and goes home to find Erika assembling a new computer in her undergarments.  Not long after Erika tells Kimiko to strip, Piro comes by, who she tells to get undressed as well.  While Erika and Piro talk about her, Kimiko, who hid when Piro showed up, runs out of the apartment.  Kimiko runs into Ping, who wanted to talk to Piro about why, after an explosion at school, she had started to cry uncontrollably.  They encounter Largo at the store, who explains what went wrong, although no one knows what he means until Piro comes in and translates.  Ping is relieved to know that she won't shut down and Kimiko hugs Piro and apologizes for her actions.  Largo leaves for Erika's apartment after she calls looking for help.  That night, while Piro and Kimiko fall asleep watching TV, Erika, who finished the computer with Largo's help, tries to seduce Largo, but it freaks him out and he runs out for home.  The next morning, after Kimiko departs, Piro finds out she quit her voice acting job and tries to find her.

Kimiko and Miho are in the same diner, to which Ed has sent an attack robot (Kill-Bot) against Miho, since she has disrupted his attempts to destroy Ping. Miho is in the diner trying to contact Piro, Kimiko is talking with Erika. Dom is also there to talk with Kimiko.  After rescuing both herself and Kimiko from the Kill-Bot and chaos at the diner, the two talk about things. Miho talks to Piro on her phone, argues with him, and then Piro and Kimiko have a conversation about that as the two females are leaving the area. Dom follows and tries to coerce Kimiko into joining SEGA for protection from fans, but she refuses. Drained, she has Miho finish talking to Piro on the phone.  Piro then encounters a group who found Kimiko's cell phone and other belongings after she and Miho escaped the diner. The group wants to help Piro get together with Kimiko, partially due to feeling bad for trying to snap a picture up Kimiko's skirt. Piro and the group set out for a press conference Kimiko is going to for the voice acting project, ''Sight''. Besides all of the other fans going to the event, a planned zombie outbreak occurs in the area. Miho, who helped Kimiko get ready for the event and accompanied her to it, later calls the zombies off for unexplained reasons through an unexplained mechanism.

Largo and Yuki, who has since been revealed along the way to be a magical girl like her mother Meimi (likewise revealed), steal a Rent-a-Zilla to fight the zombie outbreak.  Largo leaves Yuki to help Piro get to Kimiko.  Unfortunately, the Rent-a-Zilla gets bitten by zombies and turns into one itself, resulting in the TPCD capturing it.  Yuki protects it from the TPCD, teleports it out of the area, and adopts it as a pet in a miniaturized form, all much to her father's chagrin.

After the event, Erika, Largo, Kimiko and Piro are reunited, and they talk a bit with Miho, who has shown up again after storming out following an argument with Kenji earlier.  Miho declines an offer to eat with the group and wanders off thinking about games and Largo and Piro.  She is shown walking amongst the zombies and then in Ed's gun-sights, and in the center of an attack by a number of Ed's Kill-Bots.

During the next nine days, Piro and Kimiko have made up and Kimiko returned to both of her jobs, with them seeing little of each other.  Largo and Erika are shown to likewise be involved but more often, including going to dinner with the Sonoda family, as the inspector's brother was Erika's fiancé.  Kimiko is attempting to get Piro working as an artist on ''Sight'', which unbeknownst to them is now being funded by Dom.  Ping is concerned about the whereabouts of Miho, who hasn't been seen during the time, but Piro is still upset about all that has happened and somewhat evasively refuses direct assistance.  Ping and Junko, another one of Largo's students, who used to be a friend of Miho, work towards finding Miho.  Yuki and Kobayashi Yutaka then also become involved with the attempt because of this.  That night, Piro and Kimiko discuss Miho and ''Endgames'', which Yuki overhears, they unaware she is there.  This leads Yuki to appropriate Piro's powerless laptop and leave, believing him to still be in love with Miho and that the device might hold clues to finding her.  Kimiko and Piro work on his portfolio for ''Sight'' and then they say goodnight and leave.  He returns to his apartment, but Kimiko goes to the CoE club using a pass Miho gave her long ago in the beginning.  Once at the club, Dom mockingly advises her, Yuki unknowingly whisps past her, and she unexpectedly meets up with an old friend Komugiko.  During all this, Piro has left his apartment after looking at his sketchbook and a drawing of Miho.  His current location is unknown.

Aside from Kimiko, concurrent overlapping events have led to almost every main character converging upon the club for various reasons involving Miho, or in support of others involved. Ed, attempting to destroy Ping, fights with Largo, as the staff of the club have maneuvered Ed and Ping into the protective radius of ex-Idol Erika.  Yuki and Yutaka get Piro's laptop powered on, she reads the old chat logs between Piro and Miho, and follows instructions from her to him.  Going to a "hidden-in-plain-sight" hospital room, she finds Miho alive and well, although seemingly in a weakened state. During a heated argument and Miho's goading, Yuki then forcibly moves Miho to the club. Shortly after the arrival of the two in the center of everyone, the bulk of the denizens go into trance-like states while others are fighting or confused about what to do next. Miho appears to be collapsing. Upon instructions from Erika, Largo finds then uses his Largo-Phone and the club's sound system to knock out power in the immediate area of the club. During this event, Piro has gone to visit Miho at the "hospital" room, where he discovers that she is missing. Following the blackout, Largo, Erika, and Miho board a train, where Miho decides to return home. However, a large crowd has blocked her path home, apparently waiting for someone's return.

The next morning, Piro has been brought to jail, where he has been interrogated by police about Miho's disappearance. He is able to leave jail by paying a suspiciously set low bail of about $100 US, which is obtained through a 10,000 yen bill that has been shaped into an origami 'zilla and left in the cell.  Piro walks back home, where he finds Miho sleeping on a beanbag in the apartment.  Piro and Miho then work out some of the confusion between them, which reveals several background events.  She explains the Analogue Support Facility as a sort of safehouse, where she was able to come and go when she wanted. Since Ping in her extreme attempt to find Miho had posted tons of pictures, videos, and information on the internet, people are now using that to "build a 'real' me", as Miho explains it. During the process, at one point Kimiko calls from the studio, updating Piro on his artwork and telling him some of how last night she and others found Miho and how crazy it was.  Largo and Erika, who are riding on the roof of a train in the Miyagi prefecture also call during the conversation.  After a short conversation with both Largo and Erika on the phone, and a bit more conversation with Miho, Piro instructs her to stay in the apartment until they can figure out what to do.  Junko and Ping are shown leaving for school, with Junko seeming taking Ed's shotguns from last night with her.

After receiving a phone call from Yutaka, whom Masamichi initially disapproves of, Yuki, who has not changed clothing from the events of the previous chapter, leaves her house, grabs him, and takes him to a rooftop, where they try to explain things after Yutaka was being questioned by Asako and Mami. She goes over everything, even why she referred to herself as a "monster", which Yuki's friends previously overheard and misunderstood. Realizing that Miho is the cause of this mess, Yutaka indirectly vows revenge, but Yuki stops him. Yutaka goes anyway and meets his brother in front of Megagamers, who has tracked Miho to the store since the previous night. Yutaka's brother is a member of a group of Nanasawa fans who plan to intervene and remind Piro who his true love is to get rid of Miho. However, Dom's van is blocking the store's entrance. Though Yuki protests against intervention to the group, Dom, who is unknown to them, performs his own method of intervention anyway and forces Piro to choose between Nanasawa and Miho.  It is currently unknown if Dom knows who Miho is, but Miho, in a disguise, overhears the conversation and forces Piro to briefly wear a hat. At the same time, Yuki, deciding that she can wait no longer, steals Dom's van and guns, and rushes into the store with Yutaka in tow. Seeing this, Miho grabs Piro and rushes upstairs, discarding the hat in the process. Yuki subsequently collides with the hat and a presumed explosion occurs, stalling Yuki and Yutaka. Miho and Piro don cosplay outfits as a disguise, escape, and make their way to the local bath house. Just before Yuki grabs Yutaka again, Dom, now trapped under a pile of rubble, expresses his condolences to Yutaka, to which he does not understand. The pair quickly follow Miho and Piro and await for them to leave the bath house.

CMX, along with Wildstorm closed down in 2010. Former publisher Dark Horse regained the rights to the series and planned to release it in omnibus format in January 2013, but didn't.

{{As of|July 2010}}, six volumes are available for purchase: volumes 1 through 3 from Dark Horse, volumes 4 and 5 by CMX/DC, and volume 6 by Wildstorm. The books have also been translated into German, Italian, French, and Polish.&lt;ref name="popularity" /&gt; In July 2004, ''Megatokyo'' was the tenth best-selling manga property in the United States,&lt;ref name="ICV2july2004"&gt;{{cite web |date= July 7, 2004 | title=ICv2 Looks at Manga Channel Shift | url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/5241.html | accessdate= April 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and during the week ending February 20, 2005, volume 3 ranked third in the [[Nielsen BookScan]] figures,&lt;ref name="ICV2march2005"&gt;{{cite web |date= March 4, 2005 | title=''Megatokyo'' Reaches Number 3 | url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/6520.html |publisher=''ICV2''| accessdate = April 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was not only its highest ranking to date ({{as of|August 2006|lc=on}}), but also made it the highest monthly rank for an [[original English-language manga]] title.&lt;ref name="ICV2march2005" /&gt;

In July 2007, [[Kodansha]] announced that in 2008 it intends to publish ''Megatokyo'' in a Japanese-language edition, (in a silver slipcased box as part of Kodansha Box editions, a new manga line started in November 2006).

== Reception ==
[[File:Mt-fredart-megatokyo.png|thumb|right|The grayscale artwork in ''Megatokyo'' has received praise from critics in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and elsewhere.]]

The artwork and characterizations of ''Megatokyo'' have received praise from such publications as ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; and [[Comics Bulletin]].&lt;ref name = "comicsbulletin"/&gt;  Many critics praise ''Megatokyo''{{'}}s character designs and pencil work, rendered entirely in [[grayscale]];&lt;ref name = "Anime_News_Network"/&gt;&lt;ref name="animatedbliss"&gt;{{cite web| title= Manga Review: ''Megatokyo'' Volume 1 | url=http://www.animatedbliss.com/REVIEWS/review.asp?TID=2342| date= February 8, 2003 | accessdate=July 23, 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060422074118/http://www.animatedbliss.com/REVIEWS/review.asp?TID=2342 |archivedate = April 22, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=booklist&gt;{{cite web|year=2005 |url=http://libraries.darkhorse.com/reviews/archive.php?theid=109 |title=''Megatokyo Volume 3'' Booklist review |accessdate=November 7, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904001403/http://libraries.darkhorse.com/reviews/archive.php?theid=109 |archivedate=September 4, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; conversely, it has been criticized for perceived uniformity and simplicity in the designs of its peripheral characters, which have been regarded as confusing and difficult to tell apart due to their similar appearances.&lt;ref name="flipped"&gt;{{cite web|last=Welsh |first=David |title=Comic World News – Flipped |url=http://www.comicworldnews.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi?column=flipped&amp;page=76 |accessdate=July 19, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060723131013/http://www.comicworldnews.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi?column=flipped&amp;page=76 |archivedate=July 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics, such as [[Eric Burns (blogger)|Eric Burns]] of [[Websnark]], have found the comic to suffer from "incredibly slow pacing" ({{asof|2009|3|lc=on}}, only about 2 months of in-universe time have elapsed),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.megatokyo.com/faq |title=FAQ – How much time has passed in the story? |publisher=MegaTokyo |accessdate=2009-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; unclear direction or resolutions for plot threads, a lack of official character profiles and plot summaries for the uninitiated, and an erratic update schedule.&lt;ref name = "Websnark"/&gt; Burns also harshly criticized the often uncanonical filler material Gallagher employs to prevent the comic's front page content from becoming stagnant,&lt;ref name = "Websnark"/&gt; such as ''Shirt Guy Dom'', a punchline-driven [[stick figure]] comic strip written and illustrated by ''Megatokyo'' editor Dominic Nguyen. Following Gallagher taking on ''Megatokyo'' as a full-time occupation, some critics have complained that updates should be more frequent than when he worked on the comic [[part time]].&lt;ref name = "Websnark"/&gt; Update schedule issues prompted Gallagher to install an update progress bar for readers awaiting the next installment of the comic; however, it has since been removed as it itself often wasn't updated.

[[IGN]] called ''Megatokyo'''s fans "some of the most patient and forgiving in the webcomic world."&lt;ref name="IGNinterview" /&gt; During an interview, Gallagher stated that ''Megatokyo'' fans "always [tell him] they are patient and find that the final comics are always worth the wait,"&lt;ref name="IGNinterview" /&gt; but he feels as though he "[has] a commitment to [his] readers and to [himself] to deliver the best comics [he] can, and to do it on schedule,"&lt;ref name="IGNinterview" /&gt; finally saying that nothing would make him happier than "[getting] a better handle on the time it takes to create each page."&lt;ref name="IGNinterview" /&gt; Upon missing deadlines, Gallagher often makes self-disparaging comments.&lt;ref name=IGNinterview /&gt; Poking fun at this, [[Jerry Holkins|Jerry "Tycho" Holkins]] of ''[[Penny Arcade]]'' has claimed to have "gotten on famously" with Gallagher, ever since he "figured out that [Gallagher] legitimately detests himself and is not hoisting some kind of ''glamour''."&lt;ref name="pennyarcade"&gt;{{cite web|last= Holkins|first= Jerry|date= March 27, 2006|work=[[Penny Arcade]]| title= The Doujinshi Code|url= http://www.penny-arcade.com/2006/03/27/ |accessdate = April 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While ''Megatokyo'' was originally presented as a [[slapstick]] comedy, it began focusing more on the romantic relationships between its characters after Caston's departure from the project. As a result, some fans, preferring the comic's [[gag-a-day]] format, have claimed its quality was superior when Caston was writing it.&lt;ref name="timewasters"&gt;{{cite web|last= Sanderson|first= Brandon|date= June 18, 2004|title= The Official Time-Waster's Guide v3.0|url= http://www.timewastersguide.com/view.php?id=182|accessdate= July 19, 2006|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20050921180619/http://www.timewastersguide.com/view.php?id=182|archive-date= September 21, 2005|dead-url= yes|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it has been said that, without Caston's input, Largo's antics appear contrived.&lt;ref name="Websnark"&gt;{{cite web|last= Burns|first= Eric|date= August 22, 2004|work=[[Websnark]] | title= You Had Me, And You Lost Me: Why I don't read ''Megatokyo'' | url=http://www.websnark.com/archives/2004/08/you_had_me_and.html | accessdate= August 27, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Comics Bulletin]] regards ''Megatokyo'''s characters as convincingly portrayed, commenting that "the reader truly feels connected to the characters, their romantic hijinks, and their wacky misadventures with the personal touches supplied by the author."&lt;ref name="comicsbulletin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Murray |first=Robert |date=June 28, 2006 |work=[[Comics Bulletin]] |title=''Megatokyo'' v4 Review |url=http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/reviews/115147692667364.htm |accessdate=July 18, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108154748/http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/reviews/115147692667364.htm |archivedate=November 8, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Anime News Network]] has praised the personal tone in which the comic is written, stating that much of its appeal is a result of the "friendly and casual feeling of a fan-made production."&lt;ref name="Anime_News_Network"&gt;{{cite web| title= ''Megatokyo'' Volume 1 Special Review|work= [[Anime News Network]]|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/reviews/display.php?id=418| date= February 8, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gallagher states early in ''Megatokyo Volume 1'' that he and Caston "didn't want the humor ... to rely too heavily on what might be considered 'obscure knowledge.'" An article in ''The New York Times'' insists that such scenarios were unavoidable, commenting that the comic "sits at the intersection of several streams of obscure knowledge," including "gaming and hacking; manga ... the boom in Web comics over the past few years; and comics themselves."&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; The article also held that "Gallagher doesn't mean to be exclusive ... he graciously offers translation of the strip's later occasional lapses into [[l33t]] ... [and] explains why the characters are occasionally dressed in knickers or as rabbits."&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; The newspaper went on to argue that "The pleasure of a story like ''Megatokyo'' comes not in its novelistic coherence, but in its loose ranginess."&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

''Megatokyo'' was nominated in at least one category of the [[Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards]] every year from 2001 through 2007. It won Best Comic [[2002 Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards|in 2002]], as well as Best Writing, Best Serial Comic, and Best Dramatic Comic. The largest number of nominations it has received in one year is 14 [[2003 Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards|in 2003]], when it won Outstanding Environment Design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards (official site) | url=http://www.ccawards.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series tied with [[Svetlana Chmakova]]'s ''[[Dramacon]]'' for the 2007 Best Continuing OEL Manga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manga.about.com/od/recommendedreading/tp/2007BestManga.htm|title=2007 Best Continuing Manga – Top 10 Current Manga Series of 2007|author=Debi Aoki|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=November 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mount Brown''' (1837-1919)&lt;ref name=abps&gt;[http://www.abps.org.uk/Home/Who_Was_Who/index.xalter#B Who Was Who in British Philately], [[Association of British Philatelic Societies]], 2010. Retrieved 22 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; was an early British [[philatelist]] and the compiler of only the second published [[stamp catalog]]ue in the English language. Brown attended the [[City of London School]] and started to collect stamps in around 1860.&lt;ref name=stamp&gt;''The Stamp Lover'', Vol.1, No.1, June 1908, pp.5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Catalogues ==
Mount Brown published his ''Catalogue of British, Colonial, and Foreign Postage Stamps'' in May 1862, just weeks after [[Frederick Booty]] published his catalogue in April 1862, however, Brown's catalogue was more successful and reckoned to be more complete. Unlike Booty, Brown's catalogue was unillustrated. Others, such as Dr. Viner, may already have prepared unpublished hand-written lists of stamps. Brown's catalogue was more successful than Booty's and went through 7500 copies and five editions up to 1864.&lt;ref name=stamp/&gt;

Brown largely compiled his catalogue in the Rectory of [[All Hallows Staining]], and he believed that the church there was the one mentioned by Charles Dickens in ''Dombey &amp; Son''. Mount Brown had a collection of about 400 stamps but was able to list 1200 different types in his first catalogue with the help of a group of like-minded collectors who met on Saturday afternoons to pool their knowledge. These included [[Charles Viner|Dr. Charles W. Viner]], [[Henry Haslett]], [[Frederick Philbrick]], [[William Hughes-Hughes]], [[Sir Daniel Cooper, 1st Baronet|Sir Daniel Cooper]] and the [[Francis Stainforth|Rev. Francis J. Stainforth]].&lt;ref name=stamp/&gt; The Rev. Stainforth in particular was said to have had a very fine collection which largely formed the basis for Brown's catalogue.&lt;ref name=birch&gt;Birch, Brian. ''Biographies of Philatelists and Dealers''. 9th edition. Standish, Wigan: 2008, p.1362.&lt;/ref&gt;

The catalogue was quickly plagiarised, by John Kline, writing as A.C. Kline, in 1862, and by W.H. Wright writing as "A Collector" in 1863.&lt;ref name=birch/&gt; According to ''The Stamp Collectors Magazine'', Brown was well aware of the plagiarism and had arranged for all copies of Wright's work to be surrendered to him for destruction. He had also taken steps to prevent the introduction of Kline's work to Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;''The Stamp Collector's Magazine'', 1 July 1863, pp.93-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Addenda to the catalogue were published in ''The Stamp Collector's Magazine'', of which Mr Viner was editor 1863-67, and revisions to the format of the catalogue took place in the third edition, following contact between Mount Brown and [[John Edward Gray|Dr. Gray]] of the British Museum.&lt;ref&gt;"On Postage Stamp Catalogues" by Dr.J.E. Gray in ''The Stamp Collector's Magazine'', 1 April 1863, pp.41-43.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of stamps listed also expanded and details of forgeries began to be included.

== Philatelic business ==
As well as catalogues, a stamp album was available, billed as ''Mount Brown's Postage-Stamp or Crest Album'', price seven and a half shillings, and lists of unused postage stamps.&lt;ref&gt;Advertising in ''The Stamp Collector's Magazine'', 1 February 1863, p.15. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6awEAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Download here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1870 Brown's philatelic business was so great that he was forced to choose between it and his normal profession. He chose to give up philately but retained an interest, visiting the [[National Philatelic Society|Junior Philatelic Society]]'s exhibition in 1908 where he met [[Fred Melville]].&lt;ref name=stamp/&gt;

== Organised philately ==
The small group who met at ''All Hallows Staining'' formed the nucleus of what became ''The Philatelic Society, London'', which eventually became the [[Royal Philatelic Society London]].&lt;ref name=royal&gt;Rogers-Tillstone, Capt. B. ''The Royal Philatelic Society London 1869-1969''. London: Royal Philatelic Society, 1969, p.13. {{ISBN|0-900631-00-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mount Brown was not a member of ''The Philatelic Society'', possibly because it was open only to amateurs.

'''OAIster''' is an online [[Union catalog|combined]] [[bibliographic catalogue]] of [[open access]] material [[data harvesting|aggregated]] using [[OAI-PMH]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oclc.org/oaister.en.html The OAIster® database]&lt;/ref&gt;

It began at the [[University of Michigan]] in 2002 funded by a grant from the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]] and with the purpose of establishing a retrieval service for publicly available digital library resources provided by the research library community. During its tenure at the University of Michigan, OAIster grew to become one of the largest aggregations of records pointing to open access collections in the world.

In 2009, [[OCLC]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oclc.org/news/releases/20096.htm |title=OAIster [OCLC&amp;#93; |publisher=Oclc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; formed a partnership with the University of Michigan to provide continued access to open access collections aggregated in OAIster. Since OCLC began managing OAIster, it has grown to include over 30 million records contributed by over 1,500 organizations. OCLC is evolving OAIster to a model of self-service contribution for all open access digital repositories to ensure the long-term sustainability of this rich collection of open access materials.

OAIster data is harvested from [[Open Archives Initiative]] (OAI)-compliant [[Digital library|digital libraries]], [[institutional repository|institutional repositories]], and [[electronic journal|online journal]]s using the self-service WorldCat Digital Collection Gateway.

== Access ==
OAIster.worldcat.org is a freely accessible OCLC site for searching the millions of OAIster records alone. The records will continue to be indexed in OCLC's [[WorldCat]], and will be integrated in WorldCat.org search results along with records from thousands of libraries worldwide. They also will continue to be included in WorldCat Local and WorldCat Local "quick start" search results, and will continue to be available via other OCLC Discovery services.

An '''open standard''' is a [[Technical standard|standard]] that is publicly available and has various rights to use associated with it, and may also have various properties of how it was designed (e.g. open process).  There is no single definition and interpretations vary with usage.

The terms ''open'' and ''standard'' have a wide range of meanings associated with their usage.  There are a number of definitions of open standards which emphasize different aspects of openness, including the openness of the resulting specification, the openness of the drafting process, and the ownership of rights in the standard. The term "standard" is sometimes restricted to technologies approved by formalized committees that are open to participation by all interested parties and operate on a consensus basis.

The definitions of the term ''open standard'' used by academics, the European Union and some of its member governments or parliaments such as Denmark, France, and Spain preclude open standards requiring fees for use, as do the New Zealand, South African and the Venezuelan governments. On the standard organisation side, the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) ensures that its specifications can be implemented on a [[royalty-free]] basis.

Many definitions of the term ''standard'' permit patent holders to impose "reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing" royalty fees and other licensing terms on implementers or users of the standard.  For example, the rules for standards published by the major internationally recognized standards bodies such as the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF),  [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC), and [[ITU-T]] permit their standards to contain specifications whose implementation will require payment of patent licensing fees. Among these organizations, only the IETF and ITU-T explicitly refer to their standards as "open standards", while the others refer only to producing "standards". The IETF and ITU-T use definitions of "open standard" that allow [[Reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing|"reasonable and non-discriminatory" patent licensing]] fee requirements.

There are those in the open-source software community who hold that an "open standard" is only open if it can be freely adopted, implemented and extended.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Henry William | last1= Chesbrough |first2= Wim | last2= Vanhaverbeke|first3= Joel | last3=  West |title=Tim Simcoe: 'Chapter 8: Open Standards and Intellectual Property Rights' in Open Innovation: Researching A New Paradigm | publisher= Oxford University Press | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232957368_Open_Innovation_Researching_A_New_Paradigm |year =2008|accessdate= April 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While open standards or architectures are considered non-proprietary in the sense that the standard is either unowned or owned by a collective body, it can still be publicly shared and not tightly guarded.&lt;ref name="Langlois, Richard N 1999"&gt;Langlois, Richard N. "Technological Standards, Innovation, and Essential Facilities: Toward a Schmpeterian Post-Chicago Approach." (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; The typical example of “open source” that has become a standard is the personal computer originated by IBM and now referred to as Wintel, the combination of the Microsoft operating system and Intel microprocessor. There are three others that are most widely accepted as “open” which include the GSM phones (adopted as a government standard), Open Group which promotes UNIX and the like, and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) which created the first standards of SMTP and TCP/IP. Buyers tend to prefer open standards which they believe offer them cheaper products and more choice for access due to network effects and increased competition between vendors.&lt;ref&gt;Greenstein, Shane, and Victor Sango, eds. ''Standards and Public Policy''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Open standards which specify formats are sometimes referred to as [[open format]]s.

Many specifications that are sometimes referred to as standards are proprietary and only available under restrictive contract terms (if they can be obtained at all) from the organization that owns the copyright on the specification.  As such these specifications are not considered to be fully ''open''. Joel West has argued that "open" standards are not black and white but have many different levels of "openness". Ultimately a standard needs{{According to whom|date=April 2015}} to be open enough that it will become adopted and accepted in the market, but still closed enough that firms can get a return on their investment in developing the technology around the standard. A more open standard tends to occur when the knowledge of the technology becomes dispersed enough that competition is increased and others are able to start copying the technology as they implement it. This occurred with the Wintel architecture as others were able to start imitating the software. Less open standards exist when a particular firm has much power (not ownership) over the standard, which can occur when a firm’s platform “wins” in standard setting or the market makes one platform most popular.&lt;ref&gt;Joel West as cited Greenstein, Shane, and Victor Sango, eds. Standards and Public Policy. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specific definitions of an open standard ==

=== Joint IEEE, ISOC, W3C, IETF and IAB Definition ===
On August 12, 2012, the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE),  Internet Society (ISOC), World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and Internet Architecture Board (IAB), [https://open-stand.org/about-us/affirmation/ jointly affirmed] a set of principles which have contributed to the exponential growth of the Internet and related technologies.  The [https://open-stand.org/about-us/principles/ “OpenStand Principles”] define open standards and establish the building blocks for innovation.  Standards developed using the OpenStand principles are developed through an open, participatory process, support interoperability, foster global competition, are voluntarily adopted on a global level and serve as building blocks for products and services targeted to meet the needs of markets and consumers.  This drives innovation which, in turn, contributes to the creation of new markets and the growth and expansion of existing markets.

'''There are five, key OpenStand Principles, as outlined below:'''

'''1. Cooperation'''
Respectful cooperation between standards organizations, whereby each respects the autonomy, integrity, processes, and intellectual property rules of the others.

'''2. Adherence to Principles''' - Adherence to the five fundamental principles of standards development, namely

*'''''Due process:''''' Decisions are made with equity and fairness among participants. No one party dominates or guides standards development. Standards processes are transparent and opportunities exist to appeal decisions. Processes for periodic standards review and updating are well defined.
*'''''Broad consensus:''''' Processes allow for all views to be considered and addressed, such that agreement can be found across a range of interests.
*'''''Transparency:''''' Standards organizations provide advance public notice of proposed standards development activities, the scope of work to be undertaken, and conditions for participation. Easily accessible records of decisions and the materials used in reaching those decisions are provided. Public comment periods are provided before final standards approval and adoption.
*'''''Balance:''''' Standards activities are not exclusively dominated by any particular person, company or interest group.
*'''''Openness:''''' Standards processes are open to all interested and informed parties.

'''3. Collective Empowerment'''
Commitment by affirming standards organizations and their participants to collective empowerment by striving for standards that:

* are chosen and defined based on technical merit, as judged by the contributed expertise of each participant;
* provide global interoperability, scalability, stability, and resiliency;
* enable global competition;
* serve as building blocks for further innovation; and
* contribute to the creation of global communities, benefiting humanity.

'''4. Availability'''
Standards specifications are made accessible to all for implementation and deployment. Affirming standards organizations have defined procedures to develop specifications that can be implemented under fair terms. Given market diversity, fair terms may vary from royalty-free to fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms (FRAND).

'''5. Voluntary Adoption'''
Standards are voluntarily adopted and success is determined by the market.

=== ITU-T definition ===
The [[ITU-T]] is a [[standards organization|standards development organization]] (SDO) that is one of the three sectors of the [[ITU|International Telecommunications Union]] (a specialized agency of the [[United Nations]]).  The ITU-T has a Telecommunication Standardization Bureau director's ''Ad Hoc'' group on IPR that produced the following definition in March 2005, which the ITU-T as a whole has endorsed for its purposes since November 2005:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/othergroups/ipr-adhoc/openstandards.html|title=ITU-T|author=|date=|website=www.itu.int|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: The [[ITU-T]] has a long history of open standards development. However, recently some different external sources have attempted to define the term "Open Standard" in a variety of different ways. In order to avoid confusion, the ITU-T uses for its purpose the term "Open Standards" per the following definition:
: "Open Standards" are standards made available to the general public and are developed (or approved) and maintained via a collaborative and consensus driven process. "Open Standards" facilitate [[interoperability]] and data exchange among different products or services and are intended for widespread adoption.
: Other elements of "Open Standards" include, but are not limited to:
:*Collaborative process – voluntary and market driven development (or approval) following a transparent consensus driven process that is reasonably open to all interested parties.
:* Reasonably balanced – ensures that the process is not dominated by any one interest group.
:* Due process - includes consideration of and response to comments by interested parties.
:* Intellectual property rights (IPRs) – IPRs essential to implement the standard to be licensed to all applicants on a worldwide, non-discriminatory basis, either (1) for free and under other reasonable terms and conditions or (2) on reasonable terms and conditions (which may include monetary compensation). Negotiations are left to the parties concerned and are performed outside the [[standards organization|SDO]].
:* Quality and level of detail – sufficient to permit the development of a variety of competing implementations of interoperable products or services. Standardized interfaces are not hidden, or controlled other than by the SDO promulgating the standard.
:* Publicly available – easily available for implementation and use, at a reasonable price. Publication of the text of a standard by others is permitted only with the prior approval of the SDO.
:* On-going support – maintained and supported over a long period of time.

The [[ITU-T]], [[ITU-R]], [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], and [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] have harmonized on a common patent policy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/ipr/|title=ITU-T|author=|date=|website=www.itu.int|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the banner of the [[World Standards Cooperation|WSC]]. However, the ITU-T definition should not necessarily be considered also applicable in ITU-R, ISO and IEC contexts, since the Common Patent Policy 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink/fetch/2000/2122/3770791/customview.html?func=ll&amp;objId=3770791&amp;objAction=browse&amp;sort=name|title=00. ISO standards and patents|author=|date=|website=isotc.iso.org|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
does not make any reference to "open standards" but rather only to "standards."

=== IETF definition ===
In section 7 of its RFC 2026, the [[IETF]] classifies specifications that have been developed in a manner similar to that of the IETF itself as being "open standards," and lists the standards produced by [[ANSI]], [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], [[IEEE]], and [[ITU-T]] as examples.  As the IETF standardization processes and IPR policies have the characteristics listed above by ITU-T, the IETF standards fulfill the ITU-T definition of "open standards."

However, the IETF has not adopted a specific definition of "open standard"; both RFC 2026 and the IETF's mission statement (RFC 3935) talks about "open process," but RFC 2026 does not define "open standard" except for the purpose of defining what documents IETF standards can link to.

RFC 2026 belongs to a set of RFCs collectively known as BCP 9 (Best Common Practice, an IETF policy).&lt;ref&gt;[http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp9 BCP 9]: The Internet Standards Process&lt;/ref&gt;
RFC 2026 was later updated by BCP 78 and 79 (among others).  As of 2011 BCP 78 is RFC 5378 (Rights Contributors Provide to the IETF Trust),&lt;ref&gt;[http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp78 BCP 78]: Rights Contributors Provide to the IETF Trust&lt;/ref&gt; and BCP 79 consists of RFC 3979 (Intellectual Property Rights in IETF Technology) and a clarification in RFC 4879.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp79 BCP 79]: Intellectual Property Rights in IETF Technology&lt;/ref&gt; The changes are intended to be compatible with the "Simplified [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] License" as stated in the IETF Trust Legal Provisions and Copyright FAQ based on RFC 5377.&lt;ref&gt;[[IETF]] [http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info Trust Legal Provisions] (page offers a FAQ for non-lawyers)&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, the IETF combined with the W3C and [[IEEE]] to launch OpenStand &lt;ref name="OpenStand"&gt;[http://open-stand.org OpenStand]: OpenStand: Principles for The Modern Standard Paradigm&lt;/ref&gt; and to publish The Modern Paradigm for Standards. This captures "the effective and efficient standardization processes that have made the Internet and Web the premiere platforms for innovation and borderless commerce". The declaration is then published in the form of RFC 6852  in January 2013.

=== European Interoperability Framework for Pan-European eGovernment Services ===
The [[European Union]] defined the term for use within its European Interoperability Framework for Pan-European eGovernment Services, Version 1.0&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/servlets/Docd552.pdf?id=19529 European Interoperability Framework for pan-European eGovernment Services], Version 1.0 (2004) {{ISBN|92-894-8389-X}} page 9&lt;/ref&gt; although it does not claim to be a universal definition for all [[European Union]] use and documentation.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
To reach interoperability in the context of pan-European eGovernment services, guidance needs to focus on open standards.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The word "open" is here meant in the sense of fulfilling the following requirements:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* The standard is adopted and will be maintained by a not-for-profit organization, and its ongoing development occurs on the basis of an open decision-making procedure available to all interested parties (consensus or majority decision etc.).
* The standard has been published and the standard specification document is available either freely or at a nominal charge. It must be permissible to all to copy, distribute and use it for no fee or at a nominal fee.
* The intellectual property - i.e. patents possibly present - of (parts of) the standard is made irrevocably available on a [[royalty-free]] basis.
* There are no constraints on the re-use of the standard&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/servlets/Docd552.pdf?id=19529 |format=PDF |title=European Interoperability Framework for pan-European eGovernment Services |author=European Communities |year=2004 |accessdate=2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium definition ===
The [[Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium]] (NCOIC) defines open standard as the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Specifications for hardware and/or software that are publicly available implying that multiple vendors can compete directly based on the features and performance of their products. It also implies that the existing open system can be removed and replaced with that of another vendor with minimal effort and without major interruption.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncoic.org/home Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium], {{citation |url=http://wiki.ncoic.net/index.php?title=Open_Standards |title=NCOIC Lexicon}}, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Danish government definition ===
The Danish government has attempted to make a definition of open standards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itst.dk/it-arkitektur-og-standarder/standardisering/Tekniske-standarder/arkiv/oio-kataloget-arkiv-version/Definition_of_open_standards.pdf|title="Definitions of Open Standards", 2004|author=|date=|website=itst.dk|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
which also is used in pan-European software development projects. It states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* An open standard is accessible to everyone free of charge (i.e. there is no discrimination between users, and no payment or other considerations are required as a condition of use of the standard)
* An open standard of necessity remains accessible and free of charge (i.e. owners renounce their options, if indeed such exist, to limit access to the standard at a later date, for example, by committing themselves to openness during the remainder of a possible patent's life)
*An open standard is accessible free of charge and documented in all its details (i.e. all aspects of the standard are transparent and documented, and both access to and use of the documentation is free)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== French law definition ===
The French Parliament approved a definition of "open standard" in its "Law for Confidence in the Digital Economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000801164&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=id|title="Loi nº 2004-575" for the Confidence in the Digital Economy," June 21, 2004|author=|date=|website=legifrance.gouv.fr|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition is:&lt;ref name="Estándares Abiertos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.EstandaresAbiertos.org|title=Estándares abiertos e interoperabilidad. Foro sobre Estándares Abiertos.|author=|date=|website=www.estandaresabiertos.org|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* By open standard is understood any communication, interconnection or interchange protocol, and any interoperable data format whose specifications are public and without any restriction in their access or implementation.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Indian Government Definition ===

A clear Royalty Free stance and far reaching requirements case is the one for India's Government &lt;ref name="Policy in India"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Government of India|title=Policy on Open Standards for e-Governance|url=https://egovstandards.gov.in/sites/default/files/Published_Policy_Framework_Document/Policy%20on%20Open%20Standards%20for%20e-Governance.pdf|accessdate=25 July 2014|ref=india}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''4.1 Mandatory Characteristics'''
An Identified Standard will qualify as an “Open Standard”, if it meets the following criteria:
*4.1.1 Specification document of the Identified Standard shall be available with or without a nominal fee.
* 4.1.2 The Patent claims necessary to implement the Identified Standard shall be made available on a Royalty-Free basis for the lifetime of the Standard.
* 4.1.3 Identified Standard shall be adopted and maintained by a not-for-profit organization, wherein all stakeholders can opt to participate in a transparent, collaborative and consensual manner.
* 4.1.4 Identified Standard shall be recursively open as far as possible.
* 4.1.5 Identified Standard shall have technology-neutral specification.
* 4.1.6 Identified Standard shall be capable of localization support, where applicable, for all Indian official Languages for all applicable domains.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Italian Law definition ===

Italy has a general rule for the entire public sector dealing with Open Standards, although concentrating on data formats, in Art. 68 of the Code of the Digital Administration (''Codice dell'Amministrazione Digitale'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art. 68 CAD|url=http://www.normattiva.it/uri-res/N2Ls?urn:nir:stato:decreto.legislativo:2005-03-07;82!vig=|accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

[applications must] allow representation of data under different formats, at least one being an open data format.

[...]

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[it is defined] an open data format, a data format which is made public, is thoroughly documented and neutral with regard to the technological tools needed to peruse the same data.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Spanish law definition ===
A Law passed by the Spanish Parliament &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2007/06/23/pdfs/A27150-27166.pdf|title="Ley 11/2007" of Public Electronic Access of the Citizens to the Public Services, June, 22nd 2007|author=|date=|website=boe.es|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires that all electronic services provided by the Spanish public administration must be based on open standards. It defines an open standard as royalty free, according to the following definition:&lt;ref name="Estándares Abiertos"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
An open standard fulfills the following conditions:
* it is public, and its use is available on a free [gratis] basis, or at a cost that does not imply a difficulty for the user.
* its use is not subject to the payment of any intellectual [copyright] or industrial [patents and trademarks] property right.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Venezuelan law definition ===
The Venezuelan Government approved a "free software and open standards law."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gobiernoenlinea.ve/docMgr/sharedfiles/Decreto3390.pdf "Decreto 3390" of Free Software and Open Standards, December, 23rd 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The decree includes the requirement that the Venezuelan public sector must use free software based on open standards, and includes a definition of open standard:&lt;ref name="Estándares Abiertos"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Article 2: for the purposes of this Decree, it shall be understood as 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
k) Open standards: technical specifications, published and controlled by an organization in charge of their development, that have been accepted by the industry, available to everybody for their implementation in free software or other [type of software], promoting competitivity, interoperability and flexibility.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== South African Government definition ===
The South African Government approved a definition in the "Minimum Interoperability Operating Standards Handbook" (MIOS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpsa.gov.za/documents/egov/MIOSVer4_1_2007.pdf|title="Government of South Africa, MIOS Version 4.1 2007"|author=|date=|website=dpsa.gov.za|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the purposes of the MIOS, a standard shall be considered open if it meets all of these criteria. There are standards which we are obliged to adopt for pragmatic reasons which do not necessarily fully conform to being open in all respects. In such cases, where an open standard does not yet exist, the degree of openness will be taken into account when selecting an appropriate standard:

#it should be maintained by a non-commercial organization
#participation in the ongoing development work is based on decision making processes that are open to all interested parties.
#open access: all may access committee documents, drafts and completed standards free of cost or for a negligible fee.
#It must be possible for everyone to copy, distribute and use the standard free of cost.
#The intellectual rights required to implement the standard (e.g.essential patent claims) are irrevocably available, without any royalties attached.
#There are no reservations regarding reuse of the standard.
#There are multiple implementations of the standard.

=== New Zealand official interoperability framework definition ===
The E-Government Interoperability Framework (e-GIF) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e.govt.nz/standards/e-gif/e-gif-v-3-1/policy/e-gif-v-3-1-policy.pdf|title="New Zealand E-Government Interoperability Framework (e-GIF)" version 3.0, June, 22nd 2007|author=|date=|website=e.govt.nz|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines open standard as royalty free according to the following text:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
While a universally agreed definition of "open standards" is unlikely to be
resolved in the near future, the e-GIF accepts that a definition of “open standards”
needs to recognise a continuum that ranges from closed to open, and encompasses
varying degrees of "openness." To guide readers in this respect, the e-GIF
endorses "open standards" that exhibit the following properties:

* Be accessible to everyone free of charge: no discrimination between users, and no payment or other considerations should be required as a condition to use the standard.
* Remain accessible to everyone free of charge: owners should renounce their options, if any, to limit access to the standard at a later date.
* Be documented in all its details: all aspects of the standard should be transparent and documented, and both access to and use of the documentation should be free.

The e-GIF performs the same function in e-government as the Road Code does on
the highways. Driving would be excessively costly, inefficient, and ineffective if
road rules had to be agreed each time one vehicle encountered another.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Bruce Perens' definition ===
One of the most popular definitions of the term "open standard," as measured by Google ranking, is the one developed by [[Bruce Perens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/opendocument-open.html|title=Is OpenDocument an Open Standard? Yes!|author=|date=|website=www.dwheeler.com|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His [http://perens.com/OpenStandards/Definition.html definition] lists a set of principles that he believes must be met by an open standard:

#Availability: Open Standards are available for all to read and implement.
#Maximize End-User Choice: Open Standards create a fair, competitive market for implementations of the standard. They do not lock the customer into a particular vendor or group.
#No Royalty: Open Standards are free for all to ''implement'', with no royalty or fee. ''Certification'' of compliance by the standards organization may involve a fee.
#No Discrimination: Open Standards and the organizations that administer them do not favor one implementor over another for any reason other than the technical standards compliance of a vendor’s implementation. Certification organizations must provide a path for low and zero-cost implementations to be validated, but may also provide enhanced certification services.
#Extension or Subset: Implementations of Open Standards may be extended, or offered in subset form. However, certification organizations may decline to certify subset implementations, and may place requirements upon extensions (see ''Predatory Practices'').
#Predatory Practices: Open Standards may employ license terms that protect against subversion of the standard by ''[[Embrace, extend and extinguish|embrace-and-extend]]'' tactics. The licenses attached to the standard may require the publication of reference information for extensions, and a license for all others to create, distribute, and sell software that is compatible with the extensions. An Open Standard may not otherwise prohibit extensions.

=== Microsoft's definition ===
Vijay Kapoor, national technology officer, [[Microsoft]], defines what open standards are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efytimes.com/efytimes/fcreative.asp?edid=27036|title=OOXML: To Be, or Not To Be&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=efytimes.com|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Let's look at what an open standard means: 'open' refers to it being royalty-free, while 'standard' means a technology approved by formalized committees that are open to participation by all interested parties and operate on a consensus basis. An open standard is publicly available, and developed, approved and maintained via a collaborative and consensus driven process.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Overall, Microsoft's relationship to open standards was, at best, mixed.  While Microsoft participated in the most significant standard-setting organizations that establish open standards, it was often seen as oppositional to their adoption.&lt;ref name="CassonRyan2006"&gt;{{Citation |ssrn=1656616 |author1=Casson, Tony |author2=Ryan, Patrick S. |contribution=Open Standards, Open Source Adoption in the public sector, and their relationship to Microsoft’s market dominance |date=May 1, 2006 |title=Standards edge: unifier or divider? |editor=Sherrie Bolin |page=87 |publisher=Sheridan Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Open Source Initiative's definition ===
The [[Open Source Initiative]] defines the requirements and criteria for open standards as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opensource.org/osr|title=Open Standards Requirement for Software - Open Source Initiative|author=|date=|website=opensource.org|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Requirement'''

An "open standard" must not prohibit conforming implementations in open source software.

'''The Criteria'''

To comply with the Open Standards Requirement, an "open standard" must satisfy the following criteria. If an "open standard" does not meet these criteria, it will be discriminating against open source developers.

# No Intentional Secrets: The standard MUST NOT withhold any detail necessary for interoperable implementation. As flaws are inevitable, the standard MUST define a process for fixing flaws identified during implementation and interoperability testing and to incorporate said changes into a revised version or superseding version of the standard to be released under terms that do not violate the OSR.
# Availability: The standard MUST be freely and publicly available (e.g., from a stable web site) under royalty-free terms at reasonable and non-discriminatory cost.
# Patents: All patents essential to implementation of the standard MUST:
#* be licensed under royalty-free terms for unrestricted use, or
#* be covered by a promise of non-assertion when practiced by open source software
# No Agreements: There MUST NOT be any requirement for execution of a license agreement, NDA, grant, click-through, or any other form of paperwork to deploy conforming implementations of the standard.
# No OSR-Incompatible Dependencies: Implementation of the standard MUST NOT require any other technology that fails to meet the criteria of this Requirement.

=== Ken Krechmer's definition ===
[[Ken Krechmer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csrstds.com/openstds.html|title=The Meaning of Open Standards|author=|date=|website=www.csrstds.com|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; identifies ten "rights":

#Open Meeting
#Consensus
#Due Process
#Open IPR
#One World
#Open Change
#Open Documents
#Open Interface
#Open Use
#On-going Support

=== World Wide Web Consortium's definition ===
As an important provider of Web technology [[Information and Communications Technology|ICT]] Standards, notably [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]], [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|http]], [[Hypertext Markup Language|HTML]], [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] and [[Web Accessibility Initiative|WAI]], the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) follows a process that promotes the development of high-quality standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/2005/09/dd-osd.html Definition of Open Standards] World Wide Web Consortium&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking at the end result, the spec alone, up for adoption, is not enough. The participative/inclusive process leading to a particular design, and the supporting resources available with it should be accounted when we talk about Open Standards:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
*transparency (due process is public, and all technical discussions, meeting minutes, are archived and referencable in decision making)
*relevance (new standardization is started upon due analysis of the market needs, including requirements phase, e.g. accessibility, multi-linguism)
*openness (anybody can participate, and everybody does: industry, individual, public, government bodies, academia, on a worldwide scale)
*impartiality and consensus (guaranteed fairness by the process and the neutral hosting of the W3C organization, with equal weight for each participant)
*availability (free access to the standard text, both during development, at final stage, and for translations, and assurance that core Web and Internet technologies can be implemented Royalty-Free)
*maintenance (ongoing process for testing, errata, revision, permanent access, validation, etc.)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In August 2012, the W3C combined with the IETF and IEEE to launch OpenStand &lt;ref name="OpenStand"/&gt; and to publish The Modern Paradigm for Standards. This captures "the effective and efficient standardization processes that have made the Internet and Web the premiere platforms for innovation and borderless commerce".

=== Digital Standards Organization definition ===

The [[Digital Standards Organization]] (DIGISTAN) states that "an open standard must be aimed at creating unrestricted competition between vendors and unrestricted choice for users."&lt;ref name="Defining Open Standard"&gt;[http://www.digistan.org/text:rationale Defining "Open Standard"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Its brief definition of "open standard" (or "free and open standard") is "a published specification that is immune to vendor capture at all stages in its life-cycle."  Its more complete definition as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* "The standard is adopted and will be maintained by a not-for-profit organization, and its ongoing development occurs on the basis of an open decision-making procedure available to all interested parties.
* The standard has been published and the standard specification document is available freely. It must be permissible to all to copy, distribute, and use it freely.
* The patents possibly present on (parts of) the standard are made irrevocably available on a royalty-free basis.
* There are no constraints on the re-use of the standard.

A key defining property is that an open standard is immune to vendor capture at all stages in its life-cycle. Immunity from vendor capture makes it possible to improve upon, trust, and extend an open standard over time."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digistan.org/open-standard:definition What is an Open Standard?]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This definition is based on the EU's EIF v1 definition of "open standard," but with changes to address what it terms as "vendor capture."  They believe that "Many groups and individuals have provided definitions for 'open standard' that reflect their economic interests in the standards process. We see that the fundamental conflict is between vendors who seek to capture markets and raise costs, and the market at large, which seeks freedom and lower costs... Vendors work hard to turn open standards into franchise standards. They work to change the statutory language so they can cloak franchise standards in the sheep's clothing of 'open standard.' A robust definition of "free and open standard" must thus take into account the direct economic conflict between vendors and the market at large."&lt;ref name="Defining Open Standard"/&gt;

=== Free Software Foundation Europe's definition ===

The [[Free Software Foundation Europe]] (FSFE) uses a [http://fsfe.org/projects/os/def.html definition] which is based on the [[European Interoperability Framework]] v.1, and was extended after consultation with industry and community stakeholders. FSFE's standard has been adopted by groups such as the [http://www.selfproject.eu/ SELF] EU Project, the 2008 Geneva Declaration on Standards and the Future of the Internet, and international [[Document Freedom Day]] teams.

According to this definition an Open Standard is a format or protocol that is:

# Subject to full public assessment and use without constraints in a manner equally available to all parties;
# Without any components or extensions that have dependencies on formats or protocols that do not meet the definition of an Open Standard themselves;
# Free from legal or technical clauses that limit its utilisation by any party or in any business model;
# Managed and further developed independently of any single vendor in a process open to the equal participation of competitors and third parties;
# Available in multiple complete implementations by competing vendors, or as a complete implementation equally available to all parties.

=== FFII's definition ===

The [[Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure]]'s definition is said{{by whom|date=September 2015}} to coincide with the definition issued in the European Interoperability Framework released in 2004.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A specification that is public, the standard is inclusive and it has been developed and is maintained in an open standardization process, everybody can implement it without any restriction, neither payment, to license the IPR (granted to everybody for free and without any condition). This is the minimum license terms asked by standardization bodies as W3C. Of course, all the other bodies accept open standards. But specification itself could cost a fair amount of money (ie. 100-400Eur per copy as in ISO because copyright and publication of the document itself). 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===UK government definition===

The UK government's definition of open standards applies to software interoperability, data and document formats. The criteria for open standards are published in the “[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-principles Open Standards Principles]” policy paper and are as follows.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
#Collaboration - the standard is maintained through a collaborative decision-making process that is consensus based and independent of any individual supplier. Involvement in the development and maintenance of the standard is accessible to all interested parties.
#Transparency - the decision-making process is transparent, and a publicly accessible review by subject matter experts is part of the process.
#Due process - the standard is adopted by a specification or standardisation organisation, or a forum or consortium with a feedback and ratification process to ensure quality.
#Fair access - the standard is published, thoroughly documented and publicly available at zero or low cost. Zero cost is preferred but this should be considered on a case by case basis as part of the selection process. Cost should not be prohibitive or likely to cause a barrier to a level playing field.
#Market support - other than in the context of creating innovative solutions, the standard is mature, supported by the market and demonstrates platform, application and vendor independence.
#Rights - rights essential to implementation of the standard, and for interfacing with other implementations which have adopted that same standard, are licensed on a royalty free basis that is compatible with both open source and proprietary licensed solutions. These rights should be irrevocable unless there is a breach of licence conditions.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Patents==
In 2002 and 2003 the controversy about using [[reasonable and non-discriminatory]] (RAND) [[licensing]] for the use of patented technology in [[web standard]]s increased. [[Bruce Perens]], important associations as [[Free Software Foundation|FSF]] or [[Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure|FFII]] and others have argued that the use of [[patent]]s restricts who can implement a standard to those able or willing to pay for the use of the patented technology. The [[requirement]] to pay some small amount per user, is often an insurmountable problem for free/open source software implementations which can be redistributed by anyone. [[Royalty-free|Royalty free]] (RF) licensing is generally the only possible license for free/open source software implementations. Version 3 of the [[GNU General Public License]] includes a section that enjoins anyone who distributes a program released under the GPL from enforcing patents on subsequent users of the software or derivative works.

One result of this controversy was that many governments (including the Danish, French and Spanish governments singly and the EU collectively) specifically affirmed that "open standards" required royalty-free licenses.  Some standards organizations, such as the [[W3C]], modified their processes to essentially only permit royalty-free licensing.

Patents for [[software patent|software, formulas and algorithms]] are currently enforceable in the US but not in the EU.  The [http://www.european-patent-office.org/legal/epc/e/ar52.html#A52_2_c European Patent Convention Article 52 paragraph (2)(c)] expressly prohibits algorithms, business methods and software from being covered by patents.  The US has only allowed them since 1989 and there has been growing controversy in recent years as to either the benefit or feasibility.

A standards body and its associated processes cannot ''force'' a patent holder to give up its right to charge license fees, especially if the company concerned is not a member of the standards body and unconstrained by any rules that were set during the standards development process. In fact, this element discourages some standards bodies from adopting an "open" approach, fearing that they will lose out if their members are more constrained than non-members. Few bodies will carry out (or require their members to carry out) a full patent search. Ultimately, the only sanctions a standards body can apply on a non-member when patent licensing is demanded is to cancel the standard, try to rework around it, or work to invalidate the patent.  Standards bodies such as W3C and OASIS require{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} that the use of required patents be granted under a royalty-free license as a condition for joining the body or a particular working group, and this is generally considered enforceable.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Examples of patent claims brought against standards previously thought to be open include [[JPEG#Patent issues|JPEG]] and the [[Rambus]] case over [[DDR SDRAM]]. The [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC#Patent licensing|H.264 video codec]] is an example of a standards organization producing a standard that has known, non-royalty-free required patents.

Often the scope of the standard itself determines how likely it is that a firm will be able to use a standard as patent-like protection. Richard Langlois argues that standards with a wide scope may offer a firm some level of protection from competitors but it is likely that Schumpeterian creative destruction will ultimately leave the firm open to being "invented around" regardless of the standard a firm may benefit from.&lt;ref name="Langlois, Richard N 1999"/&gt;

==Legitimacy of standards==
{{POV-section|date=December 2007}}{{Unreferenced-section|date=July 2007}}

'''Legitimate standards''' are, to some critics, only those [[standardization|standard]]s whose documentation can be downloaded free-of-charge, and which can be implemented without [[royalties]] or other restrictions.

[[Request for Comments|Internet Request for Comments]] (RFCs) are an example of such [[open standards]]. However, many standards organisations attempt to support themselves by restricting standard documentation through [[copyright]]s (and selling copies), and restricting implementation through [[patent]]s (and selling licenses). 
While this second approach does solve the issue of how to pay for the time (and sometimes travel for meetings, and in some cases on-location research) of those writing the standards, it can cause significant problems.

Standards which cost money to purchase and/or license cause significant problems for:
* developers of [[free software]] and [[open hardware]];
* electronics hobbyists;
* manufacturers of small-volume products; and 
* those developing new products who [[Startup company|lack sufficient access to capital]].

An engineer may spend more time just trying to figure out what is involved in implementing and licensing such a standard than
it would take to actually implement an open standard. Expensive standards often show evidence of having been [[Design by committee|designed by a committee]]. Sometimes, they appear to have gratuitous deviations from existing practice that appear to serve the
interests of the standards organization in creating protectable [[intellectual property]], rather than the societal interests. When standards documents are not affordable, it can cause trouble for technicians trying to debug systems, as well as intelligent end users trying to evaluate or understand the technology.

Standards committee members sometimes double-dip by selling books or classes on how to implement a standard; the more arbitrary the standard, the more market for these add-on products. Some formal standards are developed by people who are more office politicians than engineers. Sometimes, licensing of standards is also used to [[Digital rights management|circumvent a user's legal rights to fair use copying]] by preventing the development of equipment or software that allows such copying.

Sometimes, standards organizations may involve companies with vested interests that all "contribute" patents (subject to licensing), when freely available [[technology]] would have done better. Some standards organizations appear to collect millions of dollars a year for a single standard, or a small set of closely related standards, yet appear to do very little in terms of active standards development.

There are some alternative ways of funding standards:
* funding by governments (for example, [[NIST]]);
* making money from optional compatibility [[certification mark]] licensing, rather than patent licensing;
* developing standards, and making them open to all to create a market;  
* developing own standards by end-users.
* instituting cost cutting measures, including using [[teleconference]], rather than expensive travel;
* developing standards by one person, or a few people, and simply offering up for use (such as internet RFCs); where if anyone likes it, they can use it, otherwise, they can come up with a better standard or suggest revisions.

It is worth noting the outcome of the competition between the truly open standards of the [[TCP/IP]] [[protocol stack]] (the basis of the Internet), the designed-by-committee and pay for copies [[OSI model|OSI protocol stack]], and the various vendor [[proprietary]] [[Wide area network|WAN]] standards ([[Decnet]],[[SNA]]). TCP/IP dominates.

Less open standards are more competitive when:
* there are no open alternatives; 
* they get to the market first; 
* extensive marketing is used to prop them up; 
* they have a significant technical advantage.

=== Legitimacy/Openness factors ===
* Is the standard documented?
* Is the standard available for all to use, or is it intended to create a [[monopoly]] or [[vendor lock-in]]?
* Is the documentation available for immediate download, free of charge?
* Can the standard be implemented without payment of [[royalties]], membership, or license fees?
* Does licensing the standard pose other restrictions (such as copy protection enforcement)?
* Is sufficient information available to implement the standard without purchasing official documents?
* Are there any patents interfering with the implementation of the standard?
* Are [[trademark]]s enforced in such a way as to interfere with the use of the standard?
* Does the standard avoid arbitrary deviations from existing standard practice?
* Does the standard use appropriate technology?
* Is the standard supported by multiple companies?
* Are licensing fees stated up front?
* Is uniform licensing available (all companies pay comparable fee per unit)?
* Are licensing fees reasonable for small volumes (1-1000 units)?  Is overhead minimal?
* Are licenses free if the product is free?
* How does the openness of the standard compare to competing standards?
* Is the standard extensible?
* Is the standard locked to a particular platform?

=== Some examples ===
Here are some comparisons between different formats..

* WAN: [[TCP/IP]] is much more open than the [[Open Systems Interconnection|OSI]] protocol suite, DECnet, SNA, etc.
* LAN: TCP/IP is much more open than [[NBF]], the [[NetWare]] protocol stack, etc. 
* Video/Audio: "Ogg [[Vorbis]] Audio" and "Ogg [[Theora]] Video" are much more open than other formats, including those with official standards such as [[MP3]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]], [[MPEG]]1/2/4, etc. Ogg standards are free. Vorbis is patent-free and Theora's patents are automatically licensed, free of charge. Vorbis also appears to offer better audio quality than MP3 or AAC. For [[streaming audio]], [[Icecast]] and [[Peercast]] are more open than RealPlayer or Windows Media Player. MPEG2 patents reportedly cost $2.50 per device (no minimums or annual fees), but there are additional royalties for streaming services, media, etc.
* Instant Messaging:  [[Jabber]] is much more open than [[AIM]], [[ICQ]], [[MSN]], [[Yahoo Messenger]], etc. However, companies such as [[AOL]] have tried to sabotage Jabber by blocking the gateways between Jabber and AIM/ICQ.
* Office Applications: [[OpenDocument]] and [[Office Open XML]] files are much more open than the old [[Microsoft Office]] binary file formats which are proprietary Microsoft controlled formats that are freely available and free to implement. 
* Flash memory: [[Multi Media Card|MMC]] is more open than [[Secure Digital Card]] (though the two are largely interchangeable, if used carefully. SD-card is more open than [[xD-Picture Card]] or [[Sony Memory Stick]]. [[CompactFlash]], based closely on [[Advanced Technology Attachment|ATA]], is more open than SD-card.
* [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] appears to be more open than [[FireWire]]. USB standards can be downloaded for free, and there do not appear to be any licensing fees if one does not use the USB-certified logos.  FireWire ports are covered by dozens of patents; these patents can be licensed for $0.25 per device with no minimum or annual fees.

=== Examples outside of computer technology ===
* One of the earliest and most successful examples of an independent standards organization promoting open standards that could be freely used by hobbyists and commercial manufacturers alike has been the [[National Model Railroad Association]]. Prior to the NMRA's inception, most manufacturers had their own proprietary standards for track, wheels, and so forth, and it was quite rare for commercial models made by different manufacturers to operate well together. In 1935, the hobbyists took charge, forming the NMRA, developing open standards to promote free interchange of models, and making it known that even among non-member hobbyists, compliance with those standards would be worth more to a manufacturer than any intentional incompatibility could possibly be.

A '''paramorphism''' 
(from [[Greek (language)|Greek]] ''[[wikt:παρά|παρά]]'', meaning "close together") 
is an extension of the concept of [[catamorphism]] first introduced by [[Lambert Meertens]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|citeseerx = 10.1.1.19.4825 | title=Paramorphisms | first=Lambert | last=Meertens | authorlink=Lambert Meertens | year = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; to deal with a form which “eats its argument and keeps it too”,&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Wadler]].''Views: A way for pattern matching to cohabit with data abstraction.'' Technical Report 34, Programming Methodology Group, University of Göteburg and Chalmers University of Technology, March 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|citeseerx = 10.1.1.41.125|title=Functional Programming with Bananas, Lenses, Envelopes and Barbed Wire|first=Erik|last=Meijer|authorlink=Erik Meijer (computer scientist)|author2=Fokkinga, Maarten |author3=Paterson, Ross |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
as exemplified by the [[factorial]] function. Its [[categorical dual]] is the [[apomorphism]]. 

It is a more convenient version of catamorphism in that it gives the combining step function immediate access not only to the result value recursively computed from each recursive subobject, but the original subobject itself as well.

Example Haskell implementation, for lists:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
cata :: (a -&gt;       b  -&gt; b) -&gt; b -&gt; [a] -&gt;  b
para :: (a -&gt; ([a], b) -&gt; b) -&gt; b -&gt; [a] -&gt;  b
ana  :: (b -&gt; (a,            b))  -&gt;  b  -&gt; [a]
apo  :: (b -&gt; (a, Either [a] b))  -&gt;  b  -&gt; [a]

cata f b (a:as) = f a     (cata f b as)
cata _ b []     = b

para f b (a:as) = f a (as, para f b as)
para _ b []     = b

ana  u b = case u b of (a,       b') -&gt; a : ana u b'

apo  u b = case u b of (a, Right b') -&gt; a : apo u b'
                       (a, Left  as) -&gt; a : as

&lt;/source&gt;

'''''People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals v. Doughney''''', 263 [[Federal Reporter|F.3d]] 359 (4th Cir. 2001), was an important [[Internet domain]] [[trademark infringement]] decision by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]].

Michael Doughney registered the [[domain name]] peta.org in 1995 and created a website called "People Eating Tasty Animals". The site described itself as "a resource for those who enjoy eating meat, wearing fur and leather, hunting, and the fruits of scientific research".&lt;ref name=boston&gt;Sonja Barisic, ''[http://www.boston.com/news/daily/21/peta.htm Court orders owner of PETA parody site to relinquish address]'', Associated Press (June 20, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) sued Doughney, alleging [[trademark infringement]], [[trademark dilution]], and [[cybersquatting]]. The case was initially heard in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia]], and both parties cross-appealed. The circuit court affirmed the district's court ruling, which had granted [[summary judgment]] to PETA. However, the court denied PETA's cross-appeal for attorney's fees and costs, because it held that Doughney's action was not malicious.&lt;ref name=courtopinion&gt;''People for Ethical Treatment of Animals v. Doughney'', [http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/263/263.F3d.359.00-2289.00-1918.html 263 F.3d 359](4th Cir. 2001). {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511015357/http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/263/263.F3d.359.00-2289.00-1918.html |date=May 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wired&gt;McCullagh, Declan (August 25, 2001). [http://archive.wired.com/politics/law/news/2001/08/46313 "Ethical Treatment of PETA Domain"]. ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 1995, Doughney registered the domain name peta.org for his website titled "People Eating Tasty Animals". The website contained links to over 30 sites including some that promoted the sale of [[leather goods]] and meats. At the bottom of the page, the website inquired "Feeling lost?  Offended?  Perhaps you should, like, ''exit immediately''" and provided a link to the [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] website.

In 1996, PETA requested that Doughney voluntarily transfer the domain name, because it owned the trademark "PETA". Doughney refused to do so, leading to the lawsuit. PETA asserted claims of service mark infringement, [[unfair competition]], trademark dilution, and cybersquatting. Initially, PETA did not seek compensation other than enjoining Doughney from using the peta.org domain and an order to transfer peta.org to PETA. The district court ruled in favor of PETA in its summary judgment, leading to the appeal of the case to the circuit court.

==Accusation of trademark infringement/unfair competition==
PETA was a registered trademark that belonged to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Thus the trademark infringement claim centered on whether "defendant used the mark 'in connection with the sale, offering for sale, distribution, or advertising' of goods or services" The court concluded that because the website prevented others from accessing the actual PETA website, it was a use in "commerce".

Doughney claimed that his peta.org website was a [[parody]] of the PETA organization, and was free speech permissible under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. The court relied on ''Cliffs Notes, Inc. v. Bantam Doubleday Dell Publ'g Group, Inc.'', to rule that, in order to constitute a parody, the peta.org domain must simultaneously convey that (1) the site was the PETA site; and (2) the contradictory message that it is merely a parody.

The court held that the domain name "peta.org" itself only conveyed the first meaning, and thus did not qualify as a parody. The court was unwilling to consider the domain name in conjunction with the site's content for the purposes of determining whether the site "simultaneously" conveyed these two meanings, writing, "Looking at Doughney's domain name alone, there is no suggestion of a parody...The domain name does not convey the second, contradictory message needed to establish a parody -a message that the domain name is not related to PETA, but that it is a parody of PETA. Doughney claims that this second message can be found in the content of his website. Indeed, the website's content makes it clear that it is not related to PETA. However, this second message is not conveyed simultaneously with the first message, as required to be considered a parody. The domain name conveys the first message; the second message is conveyed only when the viewer reads the content of the website".&lt;ref name=courtopinion /&gt;

This refusal to consider a site's content when determining whether it qualifies as a parody was arguably rejected by the Fourth Circuit a few years later in ''[[Lamparello v. Falwell]]'', 420 F.3d 309 (4th Cir. 2005), where in discussing ''PETA v. Doughney'', the court wrote, "[t]o determine whether a likelihood of confusion exists, a court should not consider how closely a fragment of a given use duplicates the trademark, but must instead consider whether the use in its entirety creates a likelihood of confusion". When dealing with domain names, this means a court must evaluate an allegedly infringing domain name in conjunction with the content of the website identified by the domain name".&lt;ref name=Lamparello&gt;''Lamparello v. Falwell'', [http://ftp.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/420/420.F3d.309.04-2122.04-2011.html 420 F.3d 309] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110626082454/http://ftp.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/420/420.F3d.309.04-2122.04-2011.html |date=June 26, 2011 }} (4th Cir. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accusation of cybersquatting==
Although PETA did not initially allege that Doughney violated the [[Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act]] (ACPA), it raised it during its request for summary judgement. Before and during the litigation, Doughney made statements suggesting that PETA should "[[Settlement (litigation)|settle]]" with him and "make him an offer".&lt;ref&gt;U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, ''PETA v. Doughney'' https://cyber.harvard.edu/stjohns/PETA_v_Doughney.html&lt;/ref&gt; This was seen by the court as his attempt to profit from the peta.org domain. Because of this and the fact that the domain name is identical to the distinctive PETA trademark, the court ruled that Doughney violated the ACPA. However, the court further held that PETA was not entitled to damages because Doughney registered and used the domain prior to ACPA's enactment. Instead Doughney was merely required to surrender the domain.

==Ineligible for compensation==
The court ruled that PETA was ineligible for an award of [[attorney's fees]] because Doughney did not maliciously infringe the trademark because he was creating a parody and had a [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right to do so.

[[File:Masopust držíme 10.jpg|upright=1.2|thumbnail|Peruehty in [[Kingdom of Bohemia]]. 1910]]
'''Perchta''' or '''Berchta''' (English: '''[[Bertha]]'''), also commonly known as '''Percht''' and other variations, was once known as a [[goddess]] in [[Pre-Christian Alpine traditions|Alpine paganism]] in the Upper German and Austrian regions of the [[Alps]]. Her name may mean "the bright one" ([[Old High German]] ''beraht, bereht'', from [[Proto-Germanic]] *''brehtaz'') and is probably related to the name ''Berchtentag'', meaning [[Epiphany (holiday)|the feast of the Epiphany]]. [[Eugen Mogk]] provides an alternative etymology, attributing the origin of the name ''Perchta'' to the [[Old High German]] verb ''pergan'', meaning "hidden" or "covered".&lt;ref&gt;Mogk according to Natko.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Perchta is often identified as stemming from the same [[Germanic paganism|Germanic]] goddess  as [[Holda]] and other female figures of German folklore (see [[Frija-Frigg]]). According to [[Jacob Grimm]] and [[Lotte Motz]], Perchta is Holda's southern cousin or equivalent, as they both share the role of "guardian of the beasts" and appear during the [[Twelve Days of Christmas]], when they oversee [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]].&lt;ref&gt;Grimm, 1882.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HiltonMotz"&gt;Motz according to Hilton 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Grimm says Perchta or Berchta was known "precisely in those Upper German regions where Holda leaves off, in Swabia, in Alsace, in Switzerland, in Bavaria and Austria."&lt;ref name=Grimm272&gt;Grimm, 1882:272.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Erika Timm]], Perchta emerged from an amalgamation of Germanic and pre-Germanic, probably [[Celts|Celtic]], traditions of the Alpine regions after the [[Migration Period]] in the [[Early Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Timm according to Natko.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Names of Perchta ==
Perchta had many different names depending on the era and region: Grimm listed the names ''Perahta'' and ''Berchte'' as the main names (in his heading), followed by ''Berchta'' in Old High German, as well as ''Behrta'' and ''Frau Perchta''. In [[Baden]], [[Swabia]], [[Switzerland]] and Slovenian regions, she was often called ''Frau Faste'' (the lady of the [[Ember days]]) or [[Pehta]] or 'Kvaternica', in [[Slovene language|Slovene]]. Elsewhere she was known as ''Posterli,'' ''Quatemberca'' and ''Fronfastenweiber''.&lt;ref name="Ginzburg"&gt;&lt;!--Year &amp; page?--&gt;Ginzburg&lt;!--Year &amp; page?--&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In southern [[Austria]], in [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] among the Slovenes, a male form of Perchta was known as ''Quantembermann'', in German, or ''Kvaternik'', in Slovene (the man of the four [[Ember days]]). Grimm thought that her male counterpart or equivalent is ''[[Berchtold]].''&lt;ref&gt;Grimm 1882:279.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regional variations of the name include ''Berigl'', ''Berchtlmuada'', ''Perhta-Baba'', ''Zlobna Pehta'', ''Bechtrababa'', ''Sampa'', ''Stampa'', ''Lutzl'', ''Zamperin'', ''Pudelfrau'', ''Zampermuatta'' and ''Rauweib''.

==Depiction==
In some descriptions, Perchta has two [[shapeshifting|forms]]; she may appear either as beautiful and white as snow like her name, or as elderly and haggard.

In many old descriptions, Perchta had one large foot, sometimes called a goose foot or swan foot. Grimm thought the strange foot symbolized her being a higher being who could [[shapeshift]] to animal form. He noticed that Bertha with a strange foot exists in many languages (Middle German "Berhte mit dem fuoze", French "Berthe au grand pied", Latin "Berhta cum magno pede", Italian " Berta dai gran piè", title of a medieval epic poem of italian area): "It is apparently a [[swan maiden]]'s foot, which as a mark of her higher nature she cannot lay aside...and at the same time the spinning-woman's splayfoot that worked the [[treadle]]".&lt;ref&gt;Grimm 1882:280&amp;ndash;81.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Tyrol she appears as little old woman with a very wrinkled face, bright lively eyes, and a long hooked nose; her hair is disheveled, her garments tattered and torn.&lt;ref name="Frazer240"/&gt;

Initially, Perchta was the upholder of cultural taboos, such as the prohibition against [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] on holidays.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/30035166?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Smith, John B. "Perchta the Belly-Slitter and Her Kin: A View of Some Traditional Threatening Figures, Threats and Punishments." ''Folklore'' 115.2 (2004): 167-86]&lt;/ref&gt; In the folklore of [[Bavaria]] and [[Austria]], Perchta was said to roam the countryside at midwinter, and to enter homes during the twelve days between Christmas and Epiphany (especially on the [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]]). She would know whether the children and young servants of the household had behaved well and worked hard all year. If they had, they might find a small silver coin the next day, in a shoe or pail. If they had not, she would slit their bellies open, remove their stomach and guts, and stuff the hole with straw and pebbles.  She was particularly concerned to see that girls had spun the whole of their allotted portion of [[flax]] or wool during the year.&lt;ref name="Frazer240"&gt;Frazer 1920:240.&lt;/ref&gt; She would also slit people's bellies open and stuff them with straw if they ate something on the night of her feast day, other than the traditional meal of fish and gruel.&lt;ref name=Grimm272/&gt;&lt;ref name="Frazer240"/&gt;

The cult of Perchta, under which followers left food and drink for ''Fraw Percht'' and her followers in the hope of receiving wealth and abundance, was condemned in Bavaria in the ''Thesaurus pauperum'' (1468) and by [[Thomas Ebendorfer]] von Haselbach in ''De decem praeceptis'' (1439).

Later canonical and church documents characterized Perchta as synonymous with other leading female spirits: [[Holda]], [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], [[Herodias]], [[Richella]] and [[Abundia]].

[[Image:Perchtenmaske.jpg|thumb|right|190px|A ''Perchten'' mask]]

Grimm thought [[Holda]] is her equivalent while the [[Weisse Frauen]] may derive directly from Berchta in her white form.

The word ''[[Pre-Christian Alpine traditions#Perchten|Perchten]]'' is plural for '''Perchta''', and this has become the name of her entourage, as well as the name of animal masks worn in parades and festivals in the mountainous regions of Austria. In the 16th century, the Perchten took two forms: Some are beautiful and bright, known as the ''Schönperchten'' ("beautiful Perchten"). These come during the Twelve Nights and festivals to "bring luck and wealth to the people." The other form is the ''Schiachperchten'' ("ugly Perchten") who have fangs, tusks and horse tails which are used to drive out demons and ghosts. Men dressed as the ugly Perchten during the 16th century and went from house to house driving out bad spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Frazer 1920:242-243&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wagner"&gt;Wagner 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, ''[[The Devil|der Teufel]]'' is viewed as the most ''schiach'' ("ugly") ''Percht''  and ''Frau Perchta'' as the most ''schön'' ("beautiful") ''Percht''.

In Italy, Perchta is roughly equivalent with [[Befana|La Befana]], who visits all the children of Italy on the night before 6 January to fill their socks with candy if they are good or a lump of coal if they are bad.&lt;ref&gt;Illes, p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
According to [[Jacob Grimm]] (1882), Perchta was spoken of in [[Old High German]] in the 10th century as '''Frau Berchta''' and thought to be a white-robed goddess who oversaw spinning and weaving, like the myths of [[Holda]].  He believed she was the feminine equivalent of [[Berchtoldstag|Berchtold]], and was sometimes the leader of the [[Wild Hunt]]. However, John B. Smith disagrees and suggests that Perchta represents the personification of the feast of the Epiphany (Perchta's Day), and is therefore not pre-Christian.&lt;ref name=Hopkin&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7A_XAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=perchta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0u82l3ozOAhXKaD4KHVgXCJkQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=perchta&amp;f=false Hopkin, David. "Folklore and the Historian", ''The Folklore Historian'', Vol. 17, Simon Bronner, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern celebrations==
In contemporary culture, Perchta is portrayed as a "rewarder of the generous, and the punisher of the bad, particularly lying children".&lt;ref name=Hopkin/&gt;
  
Today in Austria, particularly [[Salzburg]], where she is said to wander through [[Hohensalzburg Castle]] in the dead of night,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tBM6AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA563&amp;lpg=PA563&amp;dq=perchta&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8Yfmva8mcM&amp;sig=BsxUJZK-txAVoOjjm5mGzJ5TVUo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjV-Pnl2ozOAhXGbj4KHaVRDoU4MhDoAQgpMAM#v=onepage&amp;q=perchta&amp;f=false Vivian, Mrs. Herbert. "The Perchten Dancers of Salzburg", ''The Wide World Magazine: An Illustrated Monthly of True Narrative, Adventure, Travel, Customs and Sport'', Vol. 21, 1908]&lt;/ref&gt; the Perchten are still a traditional part of holidays and festivals (such as the Carnival [[Fastnacht]]). The wooden animal masks made for the festivals are today called ''Perchten''.&lt;ref name="Wagner"/&gt;

In the [[Pongau]] region of Austria large processions of ''Schönperchten'' ("beautiful Perchten") and ''Schiachperchten'' ("ugly Perchten") are held every winter. Beautiful masks are said to encouraging financial windfalls, and the ugly masks are worn to drive away evil spirits.&lt;ref name=Gallon&gt;[http://www.iga.stir.ac.uk/showblog.php?id=186 Gallon, Stephanie. "Christmas Demons II - Krampus and Perchta", International Gothic Association, December 18, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other regional variations include the ''Tresterer'' in the Austrian [[Pinzgau]] region, the stilt dancers in the town of [[Unken]], the ''Schnabelpercht'' ("trunked Percht") in the [[Unterinntal]] region and the ''Glöcklerlaufen'' ("bell-running") in the [[Salzkammergut]]. A number of large [[Ski resort|ski-resort]]s have turned the tradition into a [[tourist]] attraction drawing large crowds every winter.

Numerous lexemes that are reconstructible for the [[Proto-Slavic]] language have been identified as borrowings from the languages of various tribes that Proto-Slavic speakers came into contact with, either in prehistorical times or during their expansion when they first appeared in history in the 6th century (the Common Slavic period).&lt;ref name="abbreviations"&gt;Language abbreviations used in this article:
Av. [[Avestan language|Avestan]]; Sr-Cr. [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]; Goth. [[Gothic language|Gothic]]; Lat. [[Latin]]; OCS [[Old Church Slavonic]]; OE [[Old English]]; OHG [[Old High German]]; OIr. [[Old Irish]]; ON [[Old Norse]]; PGm. [[Proto-Germanic]]; Pol. [[Polish language|Polish]]; PSl. [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]]; Russ. [[Russian language|Russian]]
&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the loanwords come from [[Germanic languages]], with other contributors being [[Iranian languages|Iranian]], [[Celtic language|Celtic]], and [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]. The topic of such [[loanword]]s in Slavic has sparked numerous sharp debates in the 20th century, some of which persist to this day.

==Slavic and Iranian==
According to [[Ranko Matasović|Matasović]] (2008), "solving the problem of Iranian loanwords in Slavic, their distribution and relative chronology, is one of the most important tasks of modern Slavic studies".&lt;ref&gt;Matasović 2008:48&lt;/ref&gt; Slavs in the era of the Proto-Slavic language came into contact with various Iranian tribes, namely [[Scythians]], [[Sarmatians]], and [[Alans]], which were present in vast regions of eastern and southeastern Europe in the first centuries CE. The names of two large rivers in the centre of Slavic expansion, [[Dnieper]] and [[Dniester]], are of Iranian origin, and Iranian toponyms are found as far west as modern day [[Romania]].&lt;ref name="Mp47"&gt;Matasović 2008:47&lt;/ref&gt;

For a long time there have been investigators who believe that the number of loanwords from Iranian languages in Proto-Slavic is substantial. For example, [[Zbigniew Gołąb|Gołąb]] (1992) maintains that all Slavic words with unexplained initial *''x''- are in fact Iranianisms. However, there have been other Slavists who have claimed that confirmed Iranianisms in Slavic are in fact surprisingly few, and Matasović has raised broad objections to the body of past Iranianist research. [[Antoine Meillet|Meillet]] and Vaillant&lt;ref name="MVp508"&gt;Meillet &amp; Vaillant 1934:508&lt;/ref&gt; cite the Slavic word *''taparu'', axe (Russ. ''[[wikt:топор#Russian|topór]]'', Pol. ''[[wikt:topór#Polish|topór]]'', Sr-Cr. ''[[wikt:topor#Serbo-Croatian|tȍpor]]''),&lt;ref name="abbreviations" /&gt; which came from Iranian *''tapara''- (cf. Persian ''[[wikt:تبر#Persian|tabar]]''). (Gołąb, noting the etymological connection with Slavic *''tepǫ'', I hit, holds that this word is in fact a loan ''from'' Slavic ''into'' Iranian.) Meillet and Vaillant explain the alleged lack of Iranianisms in Slavic with the argument: "the civilization of warrior and partially nomadic tribes, like Scythian and Sarmatian, could have exerted only a cursory influence on the patriarchal civilization of Slavs."&lt;ref name="MVp508" /&gt;

Matasović criticizes Gołąb's approach as "methodologically unacceptable",&lt;ref name="Mp47" /&gt; emphasizing that initial *''x''- in Slavic has several sources, some of which have been ascertained (like [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] *#''ks''-),&lt;ref&gt;By the [[Ruki sound law|RUKI law]]: *#''ks''- &gt; *#''kš''- &gt; *#''kx''- &gt; *#''x''-.&lt;/ref&gt; and others which have not.&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes PIE *#''sk''- metathesizes into *#''ks''- which then regularly yields Proto-Slavic initial *''x''-. This is not, however, a regular sound change. There are several other [[sandhi]] environments (some of which were analogically leveled out in Proto-Slavic) that also yield initial *#''x''-.&lt;/ref&gt; Matasović recommends that instances of initial *''x''- in Slavic should first be explained by recourse to regular Slavic sound laws, and that Iranian should be proposed as a source if and only if the etymon has been attested in Iranian and if and only if there is additional phonetic evidence to support the proposal.

Gołąb and Matasović concur that Reczek (1985) and [[Samuil Bernstein|Bernštejn]] (1961–74) compiled excessively large numbers of alleged Iranianisms by neglecting to thoroughly check the candidates against accepted sound changes in the various major descendants of Proto-Indo-European.

Two likely Iranian loanwords in Common Slavic are&lt;ref name="abbreviations" /&gt;
* PSl. *''gōnjā'', cloak, mantle (Russ. ''gúnja'', Pol. ''gunia'', Sr-Cr. ''gȗnj'') &lt; Iranian *''gaunyā'' (Av.&lt;ref name="abbreviations" /&gt; ''gaona-'', [[Khotanese language|Khotanese]] ''ggūna'', Ossetian ''γun'');
* PSl. *''rāji'', heaven (OCS ''rajь'', Pol. ''raj'', Russ. ''raj'') &lt; Iranian *''rāy''- (Av. ''rāy'').

There are Iranianisms which have not been attested in every one of the three first order subdivisions of the [[Slavic languages]] (East, West, South); hence the evidence is lacking that these borrowings date back to Common Slavic. Examples:
* PSl. *''gupānu'', master (Old Czech ''hpán'', Pol. ''pan'', Ukr. "župan") &lt; Iranian *''gu-pāna'' 'cattle supervisor'
* PSl. *''pātrītej'', to observe (Pol. ''patrzyć'') &lt; Iranian *''pātray''- (Av. ''pāθrāy'' 'to protect')

Meillet and Vaillant considered that the [[semasiology|semasiological]] development of the Proto-Slavic word for god was an Iranianism. In both Slavic and Indo-Iranian, the root that denotes deity also denotes wealth, share (Proto-Slavic *''bagu'' &gt; Common Slavic [[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Slavic *bogъ|*''bogъ'']]) and Indo-Iranian (Old Persian ''[[wikt:𐎲𐎥#Old Persian|baga]]'', Sanskrit ''[[wikt:भग#Sanskrit|bhága]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Compare [[Old Church Slavonic]] (OCS) ''[[wikt:богатъ|bogatъ]]'', rich, to ''[[wikt:ѹбогъ|ubogъ]]'', poor.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they did not argue that the Proto-Slavic root itself was a borrowing, despite its similarity to the Old Persian and Sanskrit roots.

One of the Iranian-Slavic lexical isoglosses is a lone adposition: Old Persian ''[[wikt:𐎼𐎠𐎮𐎹#Old Persian|rādiy]]'', OCS ''[[wikt:ради#Old Church Slavonic|radi]]''.&lt;ref name="Mp47" /&gt;

Matasović notes typological coincidences between Slavic and [[Ossetian language|Ossetian]], an Iranian language whose ancestor was [[Scythian languages|Alanic]]. In both modern Ossetian and the Slavic group, verbs are conjugated for perfective and imperfective [[grammatical aspect|aspects]]; prefixation is a prominent means of deriving perfective verbs from imperfective verbs; there are certain syntactic behaviors of pronominal clitics in common; both sporadically mark direct objects with the [[genitive case|genitive]]. It remains to be determined, however, whether those correspondences are a result of prehistoric contacts between Slavic and Alanic tribes, or just a case of accidental parallel development.

==Slavic and Germanic==
It is not certain when speakers of Proto-Slavic first came into contact with Germanic tribes: among Common Balto-Slavic words that have [[Centum]] reflexes, there is not a single one that has typical Germanic sound features.&lt;ref&gt;Matasović 2008: 49&lt;/ref&gt; As for the Baltic languages, all their prehistoric Germanic loanwords are either mediated through Slavic or are borrowed from [[Old Norse]] or [[Proto-Norse]]; i.e., borrowed during a period well after Slavic prehistory (which ended c. 600 CE). The conclusion is that the speakers of Germanic must have lived far from the area of the subsequent spread of speakers of [[Balto-Slavic|Proto-Balto-Slavic]].

The [[Goths]] are the first Germanic people who can be proved to have had intensive contacts with speakers of Proto-Slavic. Goths are believed to have reached the western shores of the Black Sea between the Danube and Dniester Rivers (an area covered by present-day Ukraine and Romania) about 230 CE, so contact between them and Proto-Slavic speakers might have started in the preceding century. Contact between these two groups continued all the way to the early historical period. It is believed that the [[Gothic language]] was the intermediary for the entry of many terms of Greco-Roman cultural provenience into Proto-Slavic, for example&lt;ref name="abbreviations" /&gt;
* PSl. *''wīna'', wine (OCS ''vino'') &lt; Goth. ''wein''  (&lt; Lat. ''vīnum'');{{dubious|date=February 2017}}
* PSl. *''akitu'', vinegar (OCS ''ocьtъ'') &lt; Goth. ''akeit'' (&lt; Lat. ''acētum'');{{dubious|date=February 2017}}
* PSl. *''kajsārju'', [Roman] emperor (OCS ''cěsarь'') &lt; Goth. ''kaisareis'' (&lt; Lat. ''caesar'').{{dubious|date=February 2017}}

* PSl. *''asilu'', donkey (OCS ''osьlъ'') &lt; Goth. ''asil''- (&lt; Lat. ''asellus'');
* PSl. *''bergu'', hill (OCS ''brěgъ'') &lt; Germanic *''bergaz'' (cf. German ''Berg'');
* PSl. *''bjōda'', bowl (OCS ''bljudo'')  &lt; Goth. ''biuda'';
* PSl. *''bōkū'', letter (OCS ''buky'') &lt; Goth. ''bōkō'';
* PSl. *''činda'', child, infant (OCS ''čędo'') &lt; Germanic *''kinda'' (cf. German ''Kind'');
* PSl. *''gardu'', enclosed space (OCS ''gradъ'') &lt; Goth. ''gards'', court;
* PSl. *''ganeznantej'', to grow healthy (OCS ''goneznǫti'') &lt; Goth. ''ganisan'';
* PSl. *''kōpītej'', to buy (OCS ''kupiti'') &lt; Goth. ''kaupjan'' (&lt; Lat. ''caupo'') (cf. German ''kaufen'');
* PSl. *''kōsītej'', to test, taste (OCS ''kusiti'') &lt; Goth. ''kausjan'';
* PSl. *''kuningu'', duke (OCS ''kъnędzь'') &lt; Proto-Germanic *''kuningaz'' (cf. OE ''cyning'', OHG ''chuning'');
* PSl. *''lēku'', cure (OCS ''lěkъ'') &lt; Germanic *''lēka'' (cf. Gothic ''lēkareis'', doctor);
* PSl. *''lōku'', onion, leek (OCS ''lukъ'') &lt; Proto-Germanic *''lauka''- (cf. OHG ''lauh'', OIcel. ''laukr'');
* PSl. *''nōta'', cattle (OCS ''nuta'') &lt; Germanic *''nauta'';
* PSl. *''ōseringu'', ear-ring (OESl. ''userjazъ'') &lt; Goth. ''ausihriggs'';
* PSl. *''pulku'', folk (OCS ''plъkъ'') &lt; Germanic *''fulkan'' (cf. OE, OHG ''folc'');
* PSl. *''skulingu'',&lt;ref&gt;The expected form *''skilingu'' is incompatible with Proto-Slavic phonotactics, compare *''činda'', not *''kinda'', hence the conversion of the *''i'' to *''u'' after *''k''.&lt;/ref&gt; small money (OCS ''skъlędzь'') &lt; Goth. ''skilling'';
* PSl. *''skatu'', cattle (OCS ''skotъ'') &lt; Germanic *''skatta'' (cf. German ''Schatz'', treasure);
* PSl. *''smakū'', fig (OCS ''smoky'') &lt; Goth. ''smakka'';
* PSl. *''šelmu'', helmet (OCS ''šlěmъ'') &lt; Germanic *''helma''- (cf. OHG ''helm'');
* PSl. *''tūnu'', fence (OCS ''tynъ'') &lt; Germanic *''tūnaz'' &lt; Celtic *''dūno'', fortification (cf. OIr ''dún'');
* PSl. *''xlaiwu'', pigsty (OCS ''xlěvъ'') &lt; Germanic *''hlaiwan'';
* PSl. *''xlajbu'', bread (OCS ''xlěbъ'') &lt; Germanic *''hlaibaz'';
* PSl. *''xulmu'', hummock (OCS ''xъlmъ'') &lt; Germanic *''hulma''-;
* PSl. *''xūzu, xūsu'', house (OCS ''xyzъ'') &lt; Germanic *''hūsan'', *''hūzan'';
* PSl. *''želdān'', to compensate damage (OCS ''žlěsti'')&lt;ref&gt;First-person present singular is ''žlědǫ''; in the infinitive -''dt''- is dissimilated to -''st''-, this being a common Balto-Slavic process still operable in Proto-Slavic.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt; Germanic *''geldan'', to buy out.

This set of loanwords covers diverse semantic fields, fields from which languages readily borrow words: buildings (*''xūzu'',*''tūnu''); terrain features (*''xulmu'', *''bergu''); social interaction and societal structure (*''pulku'', *''želdān'', *''kōpītej'', *''činda''); animals and cattle (*''asilu'', *''skatu'').

===Interpretation of the Germanic material===
Many Germanic loanwords entered Slavic languages well after Proto-Slavic; i.e. in the Common Slavic period. After 600 CE most such borrowings came from Old High German.

Stender-Petersen (1927) assumes two layers of Germanic loanwords in Slavic (whether into Proto-Slavic or into Common Slavic): words from Proto-Germanic and words from Gothic. Kiparsky  suggests a more refined chronological layering:
# from Proto-Germanic, or Proto-East-Germanic
# from Gothic, which borrowings have spread to all Slavic languages
# from Balkan Gothic, which were confined only to the Slavic South
# from Old High German

All investigators agree that Germanicisms entered Proto-Slavic and Common Slavic over a lengthy period and subsequently underwent numerous sound changes. *''činda'', *''želdān'', *''xelmu'' would predate the [[Slavic first palatalization]]; *''lōku'', *''kōsitej'', *''kōpitej'' would predate the change, PSl. *''aw'' &gt; PSl. */ō/. Of special interest are certain Proto-Slavic accentual developments that can be observed in Germanic loanwords:
# Many Germanic words entered Proto-Slavic before the operation of [[Illič-Svityč's law]], and accordingly most Germanic thematic neuters became masculine in Proto-Slavic.&lt;ref&gt;Compare masculine Proto-Slavic *''xūsu'' with neuter modern German ''Haus'', masculine Proto-Slavic *''pulku'' with neuter modern German ''Volk'' etc. Late Proto-Germanic (after the operation of [[Verner's law]]), as well as all attested ancient Germanic languages, had word stress fixed on the first syllable of a word, and Germanic loanwords were thus susceptible to the operation of Illič-Svityč's law.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Most Germanic loanwords entered Proto-Slavic before the operation of [[Dybo's law]], and accordingly all Germanic loanwords with a short initial syllable become Proto-Slavic and Common Slavic [[oxytone]]s. This fact dates Dybo's law rather late, as almost all Germanic loanwords were affected by it except for those very late ones which entered Common Slavic from Balkan Gothic or from Old High German.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Russ. ''smókva'' &lt; Goth. ''smakka''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slavic and Celtic==
By the time Slavs start to appear in historical records, Celtic languages were already limited to the British Isles and modern-day France.&lt;ref&gt;Matasović 2008:52&lt;/ref&gt; However, during Classical Antiquity Celts populated the regions of Central Europe in which Slavs spread in the 6th and the 7th century, there may have been speakers of Celtic languages in the regions of Slavic expansion. In any case, it seems very possible that Celtic words might have entered Slavic indirectly instead, through Vulgar Latin/early Romance dialects, since Celtic, being but marginally spoken, was probably a low prestige idiom spoken by the lower classes of society.{{citation needed|date=November 2009|reason=Matasović 2008: page number ???}} Two likely examples of direct borrowings from Celtic are
# PSl. *''karwā'' ‘cow’ (Pol. ''krowa'', Russ. ''[[wikt:корова#Russian|koróva]]'', SCr. ''krȁva''), postulated by some to be a feminine derivative of a lost masculine noun supposedly borrowed from [[Proto-Celtic]] ''*karwos'' ‘deer’ ([[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''carw'', [[Breton language|Breton]] ''karv'', [[Cornish language|Cornish]] ''karow''), which would in turn be a regular Celtic centum reflex of PIE ''{{PIE|*ḱr̥(h₂)-u̯o-}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eugen|first1=Hill|editor1-last=Nielsen Whitehead|editor1-first=Benedicte|editor2-last=Olander|editor2-first=Thomas|editor3-last=Olsen|editor3-first=Birgit Anette|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Rasmussen|editor4-first=Jens Elmegård|title=The Sound of Indo-European – Phonetics, Phonemics and Morphophonemics|date=2012|publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press|location=Copenhagen|page=190|url=https://www.academia.edu/3727224/Hidden_sound_laws_in_the_inflectional_morphology_of_Proto-Indo-European._A_phonological_account_of_the_primary_first_singular_of_thematic_verbs_and_the_instrumental_case_of_thematic_nouns_and_adjectives|accessdate=11 October 2015|chapter=Hidden sound laws in the inflectional morphology of Proto-Indo-European}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''{{PIE|*ḱr̥(h₂)-u̯o-}}'' is a zero-grade derivative of PIE ''{{PIE|*ḱr̥(h₂)-}}'' ~ ''{{PIE|*ḱer(h₂)-}}'' ‘horn’; cf. Avestan ''sruuā-'' ‘horn’, Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|κεραός}}, ''{{transl|grc|keraós}}'' ‘horned’, Lat. ''cervus'' ‘deer’, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Lithuanian ''kárvė'', whose accentuation matches that of the Slavic etymons, points to prehistorical Balto-Slavic borrowing. However, this hypothesis fails to take into account [[Old Prussian]] ''curwis'' ‘ox’, and the Slavic protoform is usually reconstructed as PSl. *''kòrva'', inherited with incomplete satemization from an ''o''-grade PIE variant ''{{PIE|*ḱorh₂-u(e)h₂-}}''.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Derksen, ''Etymological Dictionary of the Slavic Inherited Lexicon'' (Leiden: Brill, 2008), 236.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Zair, ''The Reflexes of Proto-Indo-European Laryngeals in Celtic'' (Leiden: Brill, 2012), 94-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
# PSl. *''krawu'' ‘roof’ (OCS ''krovъ'', Czech/Russ. ''krov'') is traced by some to Germanic etymons with the same meaning (OE ''hrōf'', ON ''hróf'' etc.); if Celtic mediation is assumed, from dialectal PIE *''ḱrōpo''- &gt; Proto-Celtic *''krāfo''-&lt;ref&gt;Ranko Matasović, ''Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Celtic'' (Leiden: Brill, 2009), 221.&lt;/ref&gt; (cf. MIr ''cró'' ‘enclosure’, Welsh ''crau'' ‘hovel, pigsty’). However, the Slavic preform is usually reconstructed as PSl. *''kròvъ'' and considered a derivative of *''krỳti'' ‘to cover, hide’.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Derksen, ''EDSIL'', 250.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Celtic words are unrelated to Germanic (&lt; *''hrōfa''- &lt; *''ḱrōpo''-), stemming instead from Proto-Celtic *''krewo''- ~ ''kruwo''-,&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Zair, ''Reflexes of PIE Laryngeals'', 170-1.&lt;/ref&gt; presumably from PIE ''{{PIE|*kreu̯h₁-}}'' ‘to hide’.&lt;ref&gt;Ranko Matasović, ''Addenda et corrigenda to Ranko Matasović’s'' Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Celtic ''(Brill, Leiden 2009)''. Published online (Zagreb, 2011), 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slavic and Greek==
Ancient Greek words in Proto-Slavic are identified through phonetic features, some related to Greek phonetic history, others possibly Scythian-Sarmatian or Gothic mediations. Ancient Greek, non-mediated words are ''korablja'' (ark), ''koliba'' (cottage, hut), and supposedly ''trem'' (porch); [[Scythian languages|Scythian]] mediations are ''luk'' (onion), ''haluga'' (fence), ''koš'' (basket), ''talog'' (dregs), ''kurva'' (whore); supposedly [[Gothic language|Gothic]] mediations are ''crkva'' (church) and ''daska'' (plank).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vlajić-Popović|first=Jasna|year=2015|title=Serbian and Greek: A Long History of Lexical Borrowing|url=http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/coe21/publish/no28_ses/Chapter3_2.pdf|journal=Slavic Eurasian Studies|publisher=Hokkaido University|volume=28|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Indo-European languages==
Speculations as to contacts between Proto-Slavic speakers and other Indo-European languages have abounded in the literature on Slavic historical linguistics. Proposals have included [[Italic languages|Italic]], [[Illyrian languages|Illyrian]], [[Thracian language|Thracian]], [[Venetic language|Venetic]], and even [[Armenian language|Armenian]].

==Loanwords from non-Indo-European languages==
There are words that undoubtedly were borrowed from non-Indo-European languages. Most of these words came from [[Turkic languages]], chiefly [[Bulgar language|Bulgar]] and [[Pannonian Avars|European Avar]].&lt;ref&gt;This ancient language is not to be confused with the language of the modern [[Avars (Caucasus)|Avar people]] of the [[Caucasus]]. The genetic affiliation of the "European Avar" language of medieval European history is indetermined, with rival proposals being Turkic, Mongolian, and Iranian.&lt;/ref&gt; Among commonly cited examples of non-IE loanwords are
* OCS ''kъniga'' ‘book’ &lt; Turkic ''küiniŋ'' &lt; [[Middle Chinese]] ''kjwen'' ‘scroll’ (cf. Mandarin ''juǎn'' [[:wikt:卷|卷]]);
* OCS ''bisьrъ'' ‘pearl’ &lt; Turkic &lt; Arabic ''busr''
* Common Slavic *''xъmelь'' ‘common hop (''[[Humulus lupulus]]'')’ &lt; Turkic *''qumlaq'' (cf. [[Bashkir language|Bashkir]] ''qomalaq'', [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]] ''χǝ̂mla'' &lt; *''qumlaɣ'');
* OCS ''kovъčegъ'' ‘box, casket’ &lt; Avar{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}; cf. Mongolian ''qagurčag'';
* Common Slavic *''tъlmačь'' ‘interpreter’ &lt; Turkic{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} (cf. [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]] ''tilmeç'', [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''dilmaç'');
* Common Slavic *''klobukъ'' ‘hat’ &lt; Turkic (cf. [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] ''kalpak'' ‘hat, cap’).

'''''The Road to Hong Kong''''' is a 1962 British semi-musical comedy film directed by [[Norman Panama]] and starring [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Bob Hope]], as well as [[Joan Collins]], with a cameo featuring [[Dorothy Lamour]]&lt;ref name="BFI: Road to Hong Kong "&gt;{{cite web|title=The Road to Hong Kong (1961)|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/48552|work=Film &amp; TV Database|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the setting of [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong under British Rule]]. This was the last in the long-running ''[[Road to …]]'' series and the only one not produced by [[Paramount Pictures]], though references to the others in the series are made in the film and shown in [[Maurice Binder]]'s opening title sequence.

==Plot==
The story is told in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] as Diane ([[Joan Collins]]) explains to American Intelligence how transmissions from passengers picked up from a missile to the moon are by Americans rather than Russians.

Harry Turner (Crosby) and Chester Babcock (Hope) are defrauding people in [[Calcutta]] by selling a "Do-it-yourself interplanetary flight kit" that ends up injuring Chester, giving him [[amnesia]]. An Indian doctor ([[Peter Sellers]]) says the only way for Chester's amnesia to be cured is through help from monks in a [[lamasery]] in [[Tibet]].

At the airport, Chester mistakenly picks up a suitcase with a marking designed to be a point of contact between agents of a [[SPECTRE]]-type spy organization called "The Third Echelon."  Diane (Collins), a Third Echelon [[secret agent]], is supposed to give plans of a Russian rocket fuel stolen by the Third Echelon to the man with the suitcase, who will be taking them to headquarters in [[British Hong Kong]]. She mistakenly thinks Chester is the contact.

In Tibet, the two make their way to the lamasary in ''[[Lost Horizon]]'' fashion. Not only do the lamas cure Chester, but they have a Tibetan tea leaf that gives super memory powers to those who consume it.  Chester and Harry observe as great works of Western literature in the manner of ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' are committed to memory, one giggling lama ([[David Niven]]) memorizes ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]''. The scheming Harry decides to steal a bottle to give Chester the power of [[photographic memory]] for lucrative nefarious purposes.

Returning to Calcutta, followed by Diane, Harry has Chester test the results of the memory herb by memorizing the rocket formula that Diane placed in Chester's coat.  Not knowing what it is, Harry destroys it after Chester has successfully memorized it.  Diane arrives too late, but after seeing Chester recite the formula, she offers them $25,000 to meet her in Hong Kong. On the way to Hong Kong, an agent of the High Lama replaces the stolen Tibetan herbs with a similar bottle containing ordinary tea leaves.

The Third Echelon is seeking the fuel for its own spacecraft with an underwater launching pad in Hong Kong. The goal is to be the first on the moon, where a base is to be established to launch nuclear weapons against Earth and to bring survivors under the agency's control.

With a Russian launch to the moon carrying two apes imminent, the Third Echelon, which was going to emulate the Soviet achievement, decides to gain respect at the [[United Nations]] by launching two human astronauts, Chester and Harry, instead of apes.  The two are used as guinea pigs (and fed with bananas) to test the capabilities of the spacecraft and the effects of spaceflight upon humans. The mission is successful, with moonlight bringing back Chester's photographic memory.

Diane decides to leave the Third Echelon when she discovers that once her colleagues have extracted the final formula from Chester, they plan to dissect Chester and Harry to see the effects of space travel on their bodies.  Diane helps the boys escape. They are pursued through Hong Kong, eventually leading Diane to the authorities. Chester and Harry happen to meet [[Dorothy Lamour]] at a nightclub where they are recaptured by the Third Echelon.

Chester, Harry and Diane all end up in a rocket bound for another planet. They think they're alone after landing, but they're not—Chester calls out, "The Italians!" as they are joined by [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Dean Martin]].

==Production==
Filming in England at [[Shepperton Studios]], the regular ''Road'' picture stars Crosby and Hope returned for one last go, but the [[leading lady]] was now [[Joan Collins]] rather than [[Dorothy Lamour]]. Lamour did make a [[cameo appearance]] as herself late in the film. In her autobiography, Lamour wrote that Crosby thought her too old to be a leading lady (she was 48), while Hope refused to do the film without her. Her extended cameo that featured her singing with Hope and Crosby was a compromise.&lt;ref&gt;p.198 Lamour, Dorothy &amp; McInnes ''My Side of the Road'' Prentice-Hall 1980&lt;/ref&gt; Other cameos are provided by [[David Niven]], [[Peter Sellers]], [[Roger Delgado]], [[Jerry Colonna (entertainer)|Jerry Colonna]], [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Dean Martin]]. In order to preserve the feel of the 1940s and '50s ''Road'' films, the movie was shot in black and white (even as the previous entry ''[[Road to Bali]]'' had been shot in color).

The name of Hope's character, "Chester Babcock", is an [[in-joke]]. Edward Chester Babcock was the real name of Hollywood composer [[Jimmy Van Heusen]], whose work is featured in this and other "Road" pictures. The [[lamasery]] where Hope goes to restore his memory is reused from ''[[Black Narcissus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://parallax-view.org/2009/03/03/bob-bing-and-the-case-of-the-traveling-matte/ Bob, Bing, and the Case of the Traveling Matte]&lt;/ref&gt;  Peter Sellers' appearance as an Indian physician involves extended interplay with Crosby and Hope.

The plot of the film (released 22 May 1962) involves espionage and space rockets predating ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' (released 5 October 1962) and the spy craze of the 1960s. Hope and Crosby are up against a [[SPECTRE]] type organization called "The Third Echelon" who have their own underwater secret headquarters and are led by [[Robert Morley]] with James Bond film regular [[Walter Gotell]] as "Dr. Zorbb" and [[Bob Simmons (stunt man)|Bob Simmons]] as an astronaut. The film's [[art director]] is another Bond film regular, [[Syd Cain]].

Although the movie features the same kind of antics and gags as previous episodes, with all characters trying their utmost to help each other, the film was not as well-received as its predecessors. Some critics felt that the 59-year-old Hope and Crosby couldn't pull off the part credibly at their age and that it was unfair for them to dump their old partner Lamour (with whom they had excellent screen chemistry) for the more youthful Collins. Others thought the decade-long gap since the last ''Road'' movie wrecked the momentum of the series and that Peter Sellers came off as more fresh and funny than the aging stars of the film.

In 1977, [[Sir Lew Grade]] had planned to reunite Hope, Crosby and Lamour in ''The Road to the Fountain of Youth'' for which [[Melville Shavelson]] had completed the script,&lt;ref&gt;Giddins, Gary ''Bing Crosby: A Pocketful of Dreams: The Early Years, 1903–1940'' Thorndike Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; but Crosby died before production.&lt;ref&gt;p.165  Grudens, Richard  ''Bing Crosby: Crooner of the Century'' Celebrity Profiles Publishing, 01/02/2003&lt;/ref&gt; Crosby was rumored to have asked the writers for a Monty Python-esque script in order to keep the series fresh for 1970s audiences.

This is the only ''Road'' film to have its rights retained by the original producer/distributor (where all the previous films are now at the hands of other companies), although today [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (UA's sister studio) handles distribution and marketing on behalf of UA.

==Reception==
[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' welcomed it saying, ''[[inter alia]]'': "Age may have withered somewhat the glossy hides of Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, and custom may have done a little something to stale their brand of vaudeville. But the old boys still come through nicely in another turn in the old “Road” act by which they were jointly elevated to international eminence about twenty years ago...But practically every moment spent with Bing and Bob is good for consecutive chuckles and frequent belly-deep guffaws. For their former travel agents, Norman Panama and Melvin Frank, who have not only written this picture but produced and directed it, have provided them with the gags and business to make for much humorous verbal give-and-take and an almost unending succession of crazy and corny contretemps."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crowther|first1=Bosley|title=The New York Times|date=28 June 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' was pretty positive too. "The seventh “Road” comedy, after a lapse of seven years, should cause a seven-year itch among tab buyers to get in at the laughs. For they come thick and fast in this genial piece of nonsense. Perhaps the old formula creaks occasionally, but not enough to cause any disappointment while the zany situations and razor-edge wisecracks keep the whole affair bubbling happily. . . . The result is an amiable comedy which should please nostalgic customers and entice those who haven’t seen any of the previous “Road” pix..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Variety|date=4 April 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Songs==
All songs were written by [[Jimmy Van Heusen]] (music) and [[Sammy Cahn]] (lyrics) with the exception of "Personality".

*"Team Work" sung by Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, and again by Crosby, Hope and Joan Collins.

*"Warmer Than a Whisper" sung by Dorothy Lamour.

A [[The Road to Hong Kong (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] was released by [[Liberty Records]].

==Quotes==
* "That's the plot so far? I'd better hide you ... from the critics!" – Dorothy Lamour

==DVD &amp; Blu-ray==
''The Road to Hong Kong'' was released to DVD by MGM Home Video in a Region 1 DVD on 1 April 2003.

''The Road to Hong Kong'' was released to Blu-ray (Region A) by Olive Films on 17 Feb 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-Road-to-Hong-Kong-Blu-ray/120955/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marshall Lind.jpg|thumb|180px|Marshall Lind (shown in 1973) was commissioner of the [[Alaska Department of Education]] from 1971 to 1982.  He was the lawsuit's named defendant by virtue of his position.]]
'''''Tobeluk vs. Lind''''' was a landmark case in Alaskan Native education. The 27 teenage plaintiffs brought suit against the State of Alaska, claiming that [[Native American boarding schools]] were discriminatory and unjust.&lt;ref name=tobeluk&gt;{{cite web|title=ANNA TOBELUK, et al.,  Plaintiffs,  vs.  MARSHALL LIND, et al.,  Defendants.  No. 72-2450|url=http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/law/tobeluk.html|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case is widely known as the "Molly Hootch Case" after the first plaintiff named.&lt;ref name=tobeluk/&gt;

At the time of the case, Alaskan Native parents were forced to send their children away for schooling because of a lack of quality local educational facilities in their towns.&lt;ref&gt;http://voices.yahoo.com/equality-education-molly-hootch-case-ensured-5440371.html?cat=37&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source|date=September 2015}} Boarding schools had historically been used as a [[Cultural assimilation of Native Americans#Non-reservation boarding schools|tactic of assimilating]] Native students into white culture. Alaskan Native children were sent far from their parents for their secondary education, often heading to the contiguous 48 states and boarding with local non-Native families. They were thus immersed in a situation that was both geographically (Oregon, Oklahoma, etc.) and culturally removed from their place of origin. The plaintiffs alleged that this situation led to mistreatment of the Native students and a high dropout rate among them (65% within 2 years, in one documented case &lt;ref&gt;http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/law/mhootch_erq.html&lt;/ref&gt;), signs of educational inequality.&lt;ref&gt;http://right2education.wikispaces.com/Molly+Hootch&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1976, the signing of the Tobeluk [[Consent Decree]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/law/tobeluk.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nlm.nih.gov/nativevoices/timeline/544.html&lt;/ref&gt; committed the government to building local high schools in Alaska, which they have since done with positive results on retention rates.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The state by means of the consent decree agreed to create a secondary school in any village with at least fifteen high school-aged children.&lt;ref name=Haycox&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stephen|first1=Haycox|title=Alaska: An American Colony|date=2006|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=0295986298|page=285|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=natRq6WCu4oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=an+american+colony+Haycox&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TLN3VLKfNczIsASqqoLYDA&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=high%20school&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[botany]], a '''virtual herbarium''' is a [[herbarium]] in a digitized form. That is, it concerns a collection of [[digital image]]s of preserved [[plant]]s or plant parts. Virtual herbaria often are established to improve availability of specimens to a wider audience. However, there are digital herbaria that are not suitable for internet access because of the high resolution of scans and resulting large file sizes (several hundred megabytes per file). Additional information about each specimen, such as the location, the collector, and the botanical name are attached to every specimen. Frequently, further details such as related species and growth requirements are mentioned.

== Specimen Imaging ==
The standard hardware used for herbarium specimen imaging is the "HerbScan" [[Image scanning|scanner]]. It is an inverted flat-bed scanner which raises the specimen up to the scanning surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Herbarium digitisation|url=http://www.kew.org/data/herb_digitisation.html|publisher=Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew|accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technology was developed because it is standard practice to never turn a herbarium specimen upside-down. Alternatively, some herbaria employ a flat-bed [[Book scanning|book scanner]] or a [[copy stand]] to achieve the same effect.

A small [[color chart]] and a ruler must be included on a herbarium sheet when it is imaged. The [[JSTOR]] Plant Science&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JSTOR Plant Science|url=http://plants.jstor.org/|publisher=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires that the ruler bears the herbarium name and logo, and that a [[ColorChecker]] chart is used for any specimens to be contributed to the Global Plants Initiative (GPI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JSTOR PLANTS Handbook|url=http://www.snsb.info/SNSBInfoOpenWiki/attach/Attachments/JSTOR-Plants-Handbook.pdf|publisher=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Plants Initiative|url=http://gpi.myspecies.info/|publisher=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
{{see also|Herbarium#Uses|l1=Herbarium: Uses}}
Virtual herbaria are established in part to increase the longevity of specimens. Major herbaria participate in international loan programs, where a researcher can request specimens to be shipped in for study. This shipping contributes to the wear and tear of specimens. If, however, digital images are available, images of the specimens can be sent electronically. These images may be a sufficient substitute for the specimens themselves, or alternatively, the researcher can use the images to "preview" the specimens, to which ones should be sent out for further study. This process cuts down on the shipping, and thus the wear and tear of the specimens, as well as the wait times associated with shipping.

Virtual herbaria can also be used to increase public awareness of herbaria. Some herbaria make their specimen databases publicly available on the [[Internet]]. Digital images of specimens can be added to these databases to allow the public to further engage with the material. Some herbaria also capitalize on their images by selling herbarium prints and greeting cards featuring particularly attractive specimens.

'''''WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's War on Secrecy''''' is a 2011 book by British journalists [[David Leigh (journalist)|David Leigh]] and [[Luke Harding]]. It tells the story of [[Julian Assange]], [[WikiLeaks]], and the leak by [[Chelsea Manning]] (then known as Bradley) of classified material to the website in 2010. It was published by [[Guardian Books]] in February 2011.&lt;ref name=book /&gt;

Along with other sources, portions were adapted for the 2013 film ''[[The Fifth Estate (film)|The Fifth Estate]]''.

==Content==
The book describes Assange's childhood and details about his work creating and expanding WikiLeaks. It explains how his surname comes from his stepfather, a "touring puppet theater owner", and not his biological father, a choice that Assange made himself.&lt;ref name=ibtimes /&gt;

==Controversies==
In response to the book's publication, [[WikiLeaks]] posted on [[Twitter]]: '''The Guardian'' book serialization contains malicious libels.  We will be taking action.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|author=WikiLeaks|user=wikileaks|number=32867678527950848|title=The Guardian book serialization contains malicious libels.  We will be taking action.|date=2 February 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161205175600/https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/32867678527950848 |archivedate=5 December 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Hindu]] writer, Hasan Suroor, said Assange's concern is that the book is "critical of [Assange's] robust style and his alleged tendency to be a 'control freak'".&lt;ref name=thehindu /&gt; One of the points of disagreement is that the book claimed he had initially refused to redact the [[Afghan War documents leak#Informants named|names of Afghan informants]] to the US military from the [[Afghan War documents leak|Afghan War logs]]; the book reports him as saying they would "deserve it" if they were killed.&lt;ref name=independent /&gt; When [[Douglas Murray (author)|Douglas Murray]] relayed these comments in a debate on the 9th of April, 2011, Assange interjected "We are in the process of suing ''The Guardian'' in relation to that comment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=This house believes whistleblowers make the world a safer place: Part II|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2011/04/assange-murray-speech|work=New Statesman|date=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' claimed the following day that they had 'not received any notification of such action from WikiLeaks or its lawyers', two months after the publication of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Addley|first1=Esther|title=Julian Assange claims WikiLeaks is more accountable than governments|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/apr/09/julian-assange-wikileaks-public-debate|work=The Guardian|date=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book, Leigh mentioned the password to a set of unredacted classified [[United States diplomatic cables leak|US State Department cables]]. WikiLeaks had earlier distributed multiple copies of files containing all these cables, and others had mirrored their files with [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]]. WikiLeaks blamed Leigh and ''The Guardian'' for unnecessarily disclosing the password.&lt;ref name=spiegel /&gt; In response ''The Guardian'' said "It's nonsense to suggest the Guardian's WikiLeaks book has compromised security in any way." According to ''The Guardian'', WikiLeaks had indicated that the password was temporary and that WikiLeaks had seven months to take action to protect the files it had subsequently decided to post online.&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt; Wikileaks replied that others posted the files online, and as they were publicly available, the password was still useful. The cables contained in the file had their original form and thus they did have all the names that were erased for the safety of the informants. Specifically, the book mentions about the password:

{{quote|Assange wrote down on a scrap of paper:&lt;br&gt;''ACollectionOfHistorySince_1966_ToThe_PresentDay#''. "That's the password," he said. "But you have to add one extra word when you type it in. You have to put in the word 'Diplomatic' before the word 'History'. Can you remember that?"|David Leigh|WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's War on Secrecy&lt;ref name=huffingtonpost /&gt;&lt;ref name=theatlanticwire /&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14480">'''X.500''' is a series of computer networking standards covering electronic [[directory service]]s.  The X.500 series was developed by [[ITU-T]], formerly known as CCITT, and first approved in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/iso/ill/document/ill_directory/X_500andLDAP.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The directory services were developed in order to support the requirements of [[X.400]] electronic mail exchange and name lookup. [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] was a partner in developing the standards, incorporating them into the [[Open Systems Interconnection]] suite of protocols.  '''ISO/IEC 9594''' is the corresponding ISO identification. 

==X.500 protocols==
The protocols defined by X.500 include
* '''DAP''' ([[Directory Access Protocol]])
* '''DSP''' ([[Directory System Protocol]])
* '''DISP''' ([[Directory Information Shadowing Protocol]])
* '''DOP''' ([[Directory Operational Bindings Management Protocol]])

Because these protocols used the [[Open Systems Interconnection|OSI]] networking stack, a number of alternatives to DAP were developed to allow Internet clients to access the X.500 Directory using the [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]] networking stack.  The most well-known alternative to DAP is Lightweight Directory Access Protocol ([[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]]).  While DAP and the other X.500 protocols can now use the TCP/IP networking stack, LDAP remains a popular directory access protocol.

==X.500 data models==
The primary concept of X.500 is that there is a single [[Directory Information Tree]] (DIT), a hierarchical organization of entries which are distributed across one or more servers, called [[Directory System Agent]]s (DSA).  An entry consists of a set of attributes, each attribute with one or more values.  Each entry has a unique [[Distinguished Name]], formed by combining its [[Relative Distinguished Name]] (RDN), one or more attributes of the entry itself, and the RDNs of each of the superior entries up to the root of the DIT. As LDAP implements a very similar data model to that of X.500, there is further description of the data model in the article on [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]].

[[X.520]] and [[X.521]] together provide a definition of a set of attributes and object classes to be used for representing people and organizations as entries in the DIT.  They are one of the most widely deployed [[white pages schema]].

[[X.509]], the portion of the standard providing for an authentication framework, is now also widely used outside of the X.500 directory protocols.  It specifies a standard format for public-key certificates.

==The relationship of the X.500 Directory and X.509v3 digital certificates==

The current use of X.509v3 certificates outside the Directory structure loaded directly into [[web browser]]s was necessary for e-commerce to develop by allowing for secure web based (SSL/TLS) communications which did not require the X.500 directory as a source of digital certificates as originally conceived in X.500 (1988). One should contrast the role of X.500 and X.509 to understand their relationship in that X.509 was designed to be the secure access method for updating X.500 before the WWW, but when web browsers became popular there needed to be a simple method of encrypting connections on the transport layer to web sites. Hence the trusted root certificates for supported certificate authorities were pre loaded into certificate storage areas on the personal computer or device.

Added security is envisaged by the scheduled 2011-2014 implementation of the US [[National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace]], a two- to three-year project protecting digital identities in cyberspace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nist.gov/nstic|title=National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WWW e-commerce implementation of X.509v3 bypassed but did not replace the original ISO standard authentication mechanism of binding distinguished names in the X.500 Directory.

These packages of certificates can be added or removed by the end user in their software, but are reviewed by Microsoft and Mozilla in terms of their continued trustworthiness. Should a problem arise, such as what occurred with [[DigiNotar]], browser security experts can issue an update to mark a certificate authority as untrusted, but this is a serious removal effectively of that CA from "internet trust". X.500 offers a way to view which organization claims a specific root certificate, outside of that provided bundle. This can function as a "4 corner model of trust" adding another check to determine if a root certificate has been compromised. Rules governing the Federal Bridge policy for revoking compromised certificates are available at [http://www.idmanagement.gov www.idmanagement.gov].

The contrast of this browser bundled approach is that in X.500 or LDAP the attribute "caCertificate" can be "bound" to a directory entry and checked in addition to the default pre-loaded bundle of certificates of which end users typically have never noticed unless an SSL warning message has appeared.

For example, a web site using SSL, typically the DNS site name "www.foobar.com" is verified in a browser by the software using libraries that would check to see if the certificate was signed by one of the trusted root certificates given to the user.

Therefore, creating trust for users that they had reached the correct web site via HTTPS.

However, stronger checks are also possible, to indicate that more than the domain name was verified. To contrast this with X.500, the certificate is one attribute of many for an entry, in which the entry could contain anything allowable by the specific Directory schema. Thus X.500 does store the digital certificate, but it is one of many attributes that could potentially verify the organization, such as physical address, a contact telephone number and an email contact.

CA Certs or certificate authority certs are loaded into the browser automatically (in the case of Microsoft's update mechanism), or in new version updates of browsers, and the user is given further choices to import, delete, or develop an individual trust relationship with the loaded Certificate Authorities and determine how the browser will behave if OCSP revocation servers are unreachable.

This is in contrast with the Directory model which associates the attribute [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4523 caCertificate] with a listed certificate authority.

Thus the browser can verify the SSL cert of the website by means of the loaded group of accepted certificates or the root certificates can be looked up in an X.500 or LDAP Directory (or via HTTP/S) and imported into the list of trusted Certificate Authorities.

The "bound" distinguished name is located in the subject fields of the certificate which matches the Directory entry.  X.509v3 can contain other extensions depending on the community of interest other than international domain names. For broad Internet use, RFC-5280 PKIX describes a profile for fields that may be useful for applications such as encrypted email.

An end user who relies on the authenticity of a certificate being presented to a browser or email has no simple way to compare a forged certificate presented (perhaps which triggers a browser warning) with a valid certificate, without also being given the opportunity to validate the DN or Distinguished Name which was designed to be looked up in an X.500 DIT.

The certificate itself is public and considered to be unforgeable and can therefore be distributed in any manner, but an associated binding to an identity occurs in the Directory. Binding is what links the certificate to the identity who claims to be using that certificate. For example, the X.500 software that runs the Federal Bridge has cross certificates that enable trust between certificate authorities.

Simple homographic matching of domain names has resulted in phishing attacks where a domain can appear to be legitimate, but is not.

If a X.509v3 certificate is bound to a valid organization's distinguished name within the Directory, then a simple check can be made in regards to the authenticity of the certificate by a comparison with what is presented to the browser with what is present in the Directory.

Some options do exist to check notaries to see if a certificate has only recently been seen, and therefore more likely to have been compromised.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Wendlandt|first1=Dan|last2=Andersen|first2=David G.|last3=Perrig|first3=Adrian|date=June 2008|title=Perspectives: Improving SSH-style Host Authentication with Multi-Path Probing|url=https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/usenix08/tech/full_papers/wendlandt/wendlandt.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the 2008 USENIX Annual Technical Conference|volume=|pages=321-334|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the cert is likely to be trusted and is failing because the domain name is a slight mismatch, it will then initially fail in the browser, but then be subjected to the notary trust, which can then bypass the browser warning.

A valid organizational entry, such as o=FoobarWidgets, will also have an associated alphanumeric OID, and it has been "identity proofed" by ANSI, providing another layer of assurance regarding binding the certificate to the identity.

Recent events (2011) have indicated a threat from unknown actors in nation states who have forged certificates. This was done in order to create a [[Man-in-the-middle attack|MITM]] attack against political activists in Syria accessing Facebook over the web. This would have normally triggered a browser warning, but would not if the MITM certificate was issued by a valid certificate authority already trusted by a browser or other software. Similar attacks were used by Stuxnet which allowed software to impersonate trusted code. The point of certificate transparency is to allow an end user to determine, using a simple procedure if a certificate is in fact valid. Checking against the default bundle of certificates may not be enough to do this, and therefore an additional check is desired. Other suggestions for certificate transparency have also been advanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.certificate-transparency.org/|title=Certificate Transparency|author=|date=|website=www.certificate-transparency.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different attack was used against Comodo, a certificate authority, that resulted in forged certificates that were directed at high-profile communications websites. This necessitated an emergency patch to major browsers. These certificates were actually issued from a trusted Certificate Authority, and therefore a user would have had no warning if they had gone to a faked website, in contrast with the Syria incident, where the certificate was crudely forged, including substituting Alto Palo, for Palo Alto. and incorrect serial numbers.

Some projects designed to exchange PHI, protected Health Information (which is considered to be highly [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] sensitive) may obtain X.509v3 certs via a CERT DNS resource record, or via LDAP to a X.500[2008] Directory. The issue of an authoritative bind then is detailed in RFCs related to the accuracy of the DNS information secured by signing from the root using DNSSEC.

The concept of root name servers has been a source of major contention in the Internet community, but for DNS is largely resolved. The name space associated with X.500 has traditionally been thought to start with a national naming authority, which mirrors the ISO/ITU approach to global systems with national representation. Thus different countries will create their own unique X.500 services. The U.S. X.500 was privatized in 1998, when the U.S. Government no longer offered X.500 or DNS registration outside of known government agencies.

The X.500 pilot project has been in development in the commercial space, and the technology continues to be present in major installations of millions of users within corporate data centers, and within the U.S. Government for credentialing.

==Criticism==
The authors of RFC 2693 (concerning [[SPKI]]) note that "The original X.500 plan is unlikely ever to come to fruition. Collections of directory entries... are considered valuable or even confidential by those owning the lists and are not likely to be released to the world in the form of an X.500 directory sub-tree." and that "The X.500 idea of a distinguished name (a single, globally unique name that everyone could use when referring to an entity) is also not likely to occur."

"X.500 is too complex to support on desktops and over the Internet, so [[LDAP]] was created to provide this service 'for the rest of us'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gracion.com/server/whatldap.html What is LDAP?]. Gracion.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yell''', also known as Yell UK, is the subsidiary in the United Kingdom of global media organization, [[hibu]]. Operating in the online marketing space, as of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}, Yell has created over 54,000 websites and managed 20,000 [[Pay per click|PPC]] campaigns for customers in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://business.yell.com/websites/| title=Websites| publisher=Yell Business| access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://business.yell.com/ppc/| title=Pay-Per-Click| publisher=Yell Business| access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yell has been publishing [[yellow pages]] since 1966, originally as a portion of [[Post Office (United Kingdom)|General Post Office]], and launched its Yell.com website in January 1996.

==History==
[[Post Office (United Kingdom)|General Post Office]] first included Yellow Pages in its 1966 [[Brighton]] telephone directory.&lt;ref name=po&gt;{{cite book| title=Classified Directory Advertising Services Market Investigation| publisher=The Stationery Office| date=June 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The General Post Office expanded its Yellow Pages throughout the United Kingdom in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thephonebook.bt.com/media/pdf/dpa_sustainable_directories.pdf| title=Delivering Sustainable Directories| date=June 13, 2008| publisher=Data Publishers Association| access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1996, Yell.com was launched as a local search engine for businesses in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=google/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/may/18/yell-boss-retires| title=City shocked as Yell boss Condron announced his retirement| date=May 18, 2010| author=Richard Wray| publisher=The Guardian| access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yell announced a demerger from its parent company [[BT Group|BT]] in January 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/news/article-1559657/BT-confirms-mulling-Yell-demerger.html| title=BT confirms milling Yell demerger| date=January 28, 2001| publisher=Daily Mail| access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2001, Yell was officially sold to venture capitalists [[Apax Partners]] and [[HM Capital Partners|Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst]] for £2.1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/news/article-1554939/BT-rings-up-16321bn-with-Yell-sale.html| title=BT rings up £2.1bn with Yell sale| author=Paul Armstrong| date=May 24, 2001| publisher=Daily Mail| access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/news/article-1539176/Yell-edges-closer-to-flotation.html| title=Yell edges closer to flotation| date=April 30, 2002| publisher=Daily Mail| access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2005, it was announced that Yell was partnering with [[Google]] to make local classified content available through Google's search engine.&lt;ref name=google&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/510256/yellcom-joins-forces-google-uk-local-classifed-offering#| title=Yell.com joins forces with Google for UK local classified offering| date=April 19, 2005| publisher=Campaign| access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yell integrated Apptus technology into its search engine to broaden is search capacity and enhance site development in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ideon.se/pressrum/pressmeddelanden/artiklar/artikel/uks-local-search-engine-yellcom-chooses-apptus-technology-for-future-development/| title=UK's local search engine Yell.com chooses Apptus' technology for future development| date=January 11, 2008| publisher=Ideon| access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Yell expanded its offerings to include Google [[AdWords]].&lt;ref name=google2&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2009/may/14/yell-gives-up-google-competition-adwords| title=Yell.com stops competing with Google, sells its adWords instead| date=May 14, 2009| author=Robert Andrews| publisher=The Guardian| access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yell threatened Yellowikis with legal action in July 2006, claiming that consumers would confuse the two organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/5169674.stm| title=Legal threat to wiki listing site| date=July 12, 2006| publisher=BBC News| access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, an app was launched for Yell.com on the [[iPhone]] app store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.totaltele.com/view.aspx?ID=449513| title=Yell.com App now available on App store| date=October 5, 2009| publisher=Total Telecom| access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yell UK announced that it was changing its traditional Yellow Pages A4 format to a smaller size in February 2010 in order to improve usage of the directory. At that time, the directories contained an average of 54% recycled fiber content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.letsrecycle.com/news/latest-news/news-in-brief-480/| title=Yellow Pages targets reduced waste with smaller directory| date=February 16, 2010| publisher=Lets Recycle| access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, Yell moved in their new headquarters at One Reading Central, Reading, Berkshire, United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/business/yells-new-building-something-shout-4221454| title=Yell's new building is something to shout about| author=David Millward| date=October 21, 2010| publisher=Get Reading| access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Hanscott was named CEO of Yell in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thebusinessdesk.com/northwest/richard-hanscott-appointed-ceo-of-yell-uk.html| title=Richard Hanscott appointed CEO of Yell UK| date=June 29, 2011| publisher=he Business Desk| access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, Yell's parent company Yell Group announced that it was changing its name to ''[[Hibu]]''.&lt;ref name=hibu/&gt;

In August 2014, Hibu UK changed its customer facing brand back to Yell. They relaunched with updated websites, pay per click advertising and a new display advertising proposition.&lt;ref name=hibu&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/yellow-pages-in-u-turn-over-hibu-brand-9543137.html| title=Yellow Pages in u-turn over Hibu brand| author=Gideon Spanier| date=June 17, 2014| publisher=Independent| access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, [[Glassdoor]] named Richard Hanscott to its list of Highest Rated CEOs in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.glassdoor.com/Award/Highest-Rated-CEOs-UK-2015-LST_KQ0,26.htm| title=Highest Rated CEOs - UK| publisher=Glassdoor| access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, it announced that the Yellow Pages will be no longer published on paper from 2018 since it launched in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41125865 |title= Yellow Pages to stop printing directory after 51-year run |publisher=BBC News |date= 1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final edition will be published in January 2019.
