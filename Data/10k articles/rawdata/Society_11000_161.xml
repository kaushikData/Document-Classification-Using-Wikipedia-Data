'''Afro-Antiguans''' and '''Afro-Barbudans''' are [[Antigua and Barbuda|Antiguans and Barbudans]] of entirely or predominantly African (notably [[West Africa]]n) descent.

According to the 2013 Census, 91% of Antigua and Barbuda's population is Black and 4.4% is [[Mulatto]].&lt;ref name=cia&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ac.html |title=CIA - The World Factbook -- Antigua and Barbuda |accessdate=2013-06-09 |publisher=CIA | archiveurl= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ac.html| archivedate= 5 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
Most of the enslaved Africans brought to Antigua and Barbuda disembarked from the [[Bight of Biafra]] (22,000 Africans) and the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]] (16,000 Africans). Other African slaves came from the [[Windward Coast]] (11,000 Africans), the [[Kingdom of Kongo|West Central Africa]] (9,000 Africans), the [[Bight of Benin]] (6,000 Africans), [[Senegambia]] (5,000 Africans), [[Guinea]] and [[Sierra Leone]] (4,000 Africans).&lt;ref name="photobafriban"&gt;[http://s1207.photobucket.com/user/oditous3/media/AfricanOriginsbroadregionsforCarribeanenglishfrenchnumbers.jpg.html African origins of the slaves from British and former British Antilles]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Settlers raised [[tobacco]], [[indigo]], [[ginger]], and [[sugarcane]] as cash crops. [[Christopher Codrington|Sir Christopher Codrington]] established the first large sugar estate in Antigua in 1674, and leased [[Barbuda]] to raise provisions for his plantations. In the fifty years after Codrington established his initial plantation, the sugar industry became so profitable that many farmers replaced other crops with sugar, making it the economic backbone of the islands. Codrington and others brought slaves from Africa's western coast to work the plantations. Africans started arriving in Antigua and Barbuda in large numbers during the 1670s; they soon became the largest racial group of Antigua and Barbuda.

With all others in the [[British Empire]], Antiguan and Barbudan slaves were [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|emancipated]] in 1834, but remained economically dependent upon the plantation owners. Economic opportunities for the new freedmen were limited by a lack of surplus farming land, no access to credit, and an economy built on agriculture rather than manufacturing. Poor labour conditions persisted until 1939, when a member of a royal commission urged the formation of a trade union movement.

In the 20th-century was redefined the role of Afro-Antiguans and Barbudans. The colonial social structure gradually started to be phased out with the introduction of universal education and better economic opportunities.&lt;ref name=Background&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2336.htm |title=Background Note: Antigua and Barbuda |accessdate=2007-08-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070814213848/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2336.htm| archivedate= 14 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aluo''' ([[Exonym and endonym|autonym]]: ''ɑ55 lo33 pho55''&lt;ref&gt;''Yunnan Province Ethnic Minority Languages Gazetteer'' (云南省志：少数民族语言文字志), p.30&lt;/ref&gt;; '''Naluo'''&lt;ref name="Gao2017"/&gt;) is a [[Loloish language]] spoken by the [[Yi people]] of [[China]]. It is also known by its [[Nasu language|Nasu]] name ''Laka'' (also ''Gan Yi, Yala, Lila, Niluo'').

==Names==
Gao (2017:31)&lt;ref name="Gao2017"/&gt; notes that in [[Wuding County]], Yunnan, Aluo and Naluo are equivalent terms for the same Yi subgroup. ''Naluo'' in the ''Wuding County Gazetteer'' (1990) actually refers to ''Aluo'' speakers (Gao 2017:31). ''Naluo'' is not to be confused with ''[[Naruo language|Naruo]]'', a [[Taloid languages|Taloid]] ([[Central Loloish languages|Central Loloish]]) language of northern Yunnan.

==Locations==
Aluo is spoken in north [[Wuding]], [[Luquan Yi and Miao Autonomous County|Luquan]], and [[Yuanmou]] counties, [[Yunnan]], and in [[Huili County|Huili]] and [[Miyi]] counties, [[Sichuan]].

'''American Women's Voluntary Services''' (AWVS) was the largest American women's service organization in the [[United States]] during [[World War II]] (WWII).&lt;ref name=nwhm/&gt; AWVS provided women volunteers who provided support services to help the nation during the war such as message delivery, ambulance driving, selling [[War bonds#United States 2|war bonds]], emergency kitchens, cycle corps drivers, dog-sled teamsters, aircraft spotters, navigation, aerial photography, fighting fires, truck driving,  and [[Canteen (place)|canteen]] workers. Some of its work overlapped with the [[Office of Civilian Defense]] and the [[American Red Cross]].&lt;ref name="timeawvs"/&gt;

[[Alice Throckmorton McLean]] founded AWVS in January 1940,&lt;ref name=weatherford/&gt; 23 months before the United States entered the war, basing it upon the British [[WRVS|Women's Voluntary Services]],&lt;ref name=mom/&gt; in order to help prepare the nation for the war. Most of the founders were wealthy internationalist women, and its headquarters was in New York City, making America's isolationists suspicious of AWVS. Others saw the organization as being alarmist. Despite these concerns, AWVS had about 18,000 members by the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941.&lt;ref name=weatherford/&gt; Eventually over 325,000 women were trained by AWVS.&lt;ref name=mom/&gt; [[Doris Ryer Nixon]] founded the California chapter in August 1941 and became AWVS's national vice president.&lt;ref name="laguna"/&gt;&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=died/&gt;
[[File:American Women's Voluntary Service.JPG|thumb]]
AWVS also encountered resistance because some men did not want women working. The group also sponsored units in African, Chinese, and Hispanic American parts of the United States.&lt;ref name=weatherford/&gt;&lt;ref name=mom/&gt; This also led to lampooning by the media. By 1944, despite hundreds of thousands of volunteers and large efforts to help win the war, AWVS was accused of being lazy, and the leaders decided to disband the organization at the end of the war. Also, they were formed for the specific purpose of supporting the war, which had been won.&lt;ref name=weatherford/&gt;

Actresses who were AWVS members included [[Joan Crawford]],&lt;ref name=joan/&gt; [[Hattie McDaniel]],&lt;ref name=hattie/&gt; [[Betty White]] and [[Lillian Randolph]].&lt;ref name=lillian/&gt;  AMVS inspired other volunteer service groups, such as "Laguna Cottages for Seniors".&lt;ref name="laguna"/&gt;

Swiss banking secrecy was first codified with the [[Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks|Banking Act of 1934]] which made it a crime to disclose client information to third parties without their consent. The law, coupled with a stable Swiss currency and international neutrality, prompted large capital flight to private Swiss accounts. During the 1940s, [[Numbered bank account|numbered bank accounts]] were introduced creating an enduring principle of bank secrecy that continues to be considered one of the main aspects of [[private banking]] globally. Advances in [[financial cryptography]] (via [[public-key cryptography]]) could make it possible to use anonymous electronic money and anonymous digital bearer certificates for financial privacy and [[anonymous Internet banking]], given enabling institutions and secure computer systems.

&lt;blockquote&gt;You ask why, if there's an important role for a regulated banking system, do you allow a non-regulated banking system to continue? It's in the interest of some of the moneyed interests to allow this to occur. It's not an accident; it could have been shut down at any time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10997">'''Carl Aldo Marzani''' (4 March 1912 – 11 December 1994)  was an Italian-born American leftwing political activist and publisher. He was successively a Communist Party organizer, volunteer soldier in the [[Spanish Civil War]], United States federal intelligence official, documentary filmmaker, author, and publisher. During [[World War II]] he served in the federal intelligence agency, the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) and later the [[U.S. Department of State]]. He picked the targets for the [[Doolittle raid]] on Tokyo, which took place on April 18, 1942. Marzani served nearly three years in prison for having concealed his [[Communist Party USA]] (CPUSA) membership while in the OSS.

== Life ==
Marzani was born in Rome, Italy. The family emigrated to the United States in 1924 and settled in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]]. Carl entered the first grade at the age of twelve, not knowing English. He graduated from High School in 1931 with a scholarship to [[Williams College]]. There, Marzani became a socialist and joined the [[League for Industrial Democracy]]. He began writing and became the editor of the school's literary magazine. In 1935 he married his first wife, Edith Eisner, an actress whose stage name was Edith Emerson. The same year, he graduated summa cum laude from Williams College with a BA in English. Marzani thereupon moved to New York. In 1936 he received a Moody fellowship to [[Oxford University]].

When the Spanish Civil War broke out Marzani traveled to Spain to volunteer for the Republican army. He commanded troops the [[Durruti Column]], a unit of the anarchist wing of the Republican forces, during late 1936 and early 1937. He soon resumed university studies and in June 1938 Marzani received a BA in Modern Greats, Philosophy, Politics and Economics from Oxford. The former anarchist supporter underwent a radical change in his ideology, joining the [[British Communist Party]] and serving as its treasurer of the South Midlands district. In the summer of 1938, Marzani and his second wife, [[Charlotte Pomerantz]], traveled around the world, visiting India, Indochina, China, Japan, and Europe, using Communist Party contacts to meet [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and others.

After their world tour, the Marzanis returned to the United States and went on relief, the [[New Deal]] term for government assistance and welfare. Eventually they got government paid jobs with the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) while at the same time joining the CPUSA under false identities. Marzani joined the CPUSA 23 August 1939, on the day the [[Nazi-Soviet]] Pact was signed. As a WPA instructor at New York University, as served as district Organizer for the Communist Party on the Lower East Side of New York. After the [[German invasion of the Soviet Union]] in mid 1941, Marzani became director of a [[popular front]] anti-fascist organization, and resigned from the Communist party in August 1941.

In early 1942 after the United States became involved in [[World War II]], Marzani joined the OSS, the predecessor organization of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA). Marzani worked under Colonel [[William J. Donovan]] from 1942 to 1945 in the Analysis Branch. A 1943 [[Venona Project]] decryption of Soviet espionage cable traffic reported on an American code-named ''Kollega'' ("Colleage"), recruited by [[Eugene Dennis]], who later became CPUSA [[Secretary General|General Secretary]]. The message described ''Kollega'' as working at the "Photographic Section Pictural Devision" (''sic''), interpreted by the U.S. analysts as "probably the Pictures Division of the News and Features Bureau of the [[Office of War Information]]" (OWI).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/venona/1943/8jun_status_agents.pdf Garbled status reports of several agents 8 June 1943 (Release2)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323091452/http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/venona/1943/8jun_status_agents.pdf |date=23 March 2009 }}, in [http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/declass/venona/jun_1943.shtml Venona Documents, June 1943]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215034125/http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/declass/venona/jun_1943.shtml |date=December 15, 2009 }}, Declassification Initiatives of the [[National Security Agency]], posted January 15, 2009.

''New York Times'', May 9, 1999. Retrieved November 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945 Marzani transferred to the [[Department of State]], where he worked as the Deputy Chief of the Presentation Division of the Office of Intelligence. Marzani handled the preparation of top secret reports.

In 1946 Marzani founded and directed Union Films, a film documentary company that had contracts with the [[United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America]] and other unions to do documentaries. One film entitled ''Deadline for Action'', was released in September 1946, five weeks before Marzani resigned from the State Department. The film blamed the United States for the [[Cold War]].

In January 1947 Marzani was indicted for defrauding the government by receiving government pay while concealing CPUSA membership. He was convicted on 22 June 1947, but nine counts were overturned on appeal, while the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] split 4-4 on a rare rehearing of the last two charges. Marzani served all but four months of a thirty-six-month sentence.

In prison, Marzani began work on a book blaming President [[Harry S. Truman]] for starting the Cold War. Caught attempting to smuggle a manuscript out of prison in 1950, he was placed in solitary confinement for seven months. The book was published in 1952 as ''[https://archive.org/details/WeCanBeFriends We Can Be Friends: Origins of the Cold War]''.

Union Films went out of business during his stay in prison. After his release in 1951, Marzani edited ''UE Steward'' for the United Electrical Workers until 1954. The same year he joined Cameron Associates and partnered with [[Angus Cameron (publisher)|Angus Cameron]] to run Liberty Book Club. Liberty Book Club eventually became Marzani &amp; Munsell which operated the Library-Prometheus Book Club. In this phase of his career Marzani was a contact for the Soviet secret police agency, the [[KGB]], and the KGB subsidized his publishing house in the 1960s, according to allegations made in 1994 by [[Oleg Kalugin]], a retired KGB officer.

Marzani was one of the interviewees in [[Vivian Gornick]]'s 1977 book, ''The romance of American communism''. Like the other interviewees, Marzani was concealed by a pseudonym; his was "Eric Lanzetti".&lt;ref&gt;Cannistraro and Meyer 2003:71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terrill 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years, Marzani seems to have moved away from his Old Left roots. In 1972 he authored Wounded Earth,&lt;ref&gt;Carl Marzani – Wounded Earth – Addison Wesley, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; a well-respected book on environmental matters, at that time an unusual interest for a man associated with orthodox Marxism. In a 1976 article for the periodical In These Times,&lt;ref&gt;Carl Marzani – Towards Eurocapitalism (article) – In These Times – 6–12 December 1976&lt;/ref&gt; he spoke respectfully of the Club of Rome, a think-tank formed by a group of Italian industrialists in 1968 ; "it is a highly sophisticated group, the most thoughtful representatives of European capitalism". In a note appended to the article he commented "I have only two claims to fame : that I was the first political prisoner of the Cold War and that I wrote the first [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] history of it." He continued to proclaim his newfound revisionism in his 1981 book ''The Promise of [[Eurocommunism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Marzani – The Promise of Eurocommunism – Lawrence Hill – 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-19th century, some [[Protestantism|Protestant Christians]] moved from a position of allowing moderate use of alcohol (sometimes called ''moderationism'') to either deciding that not imbibing was wisest in the present circumstances (''abstentionism'') or prohibiting all ordinary consumption of alcohol because it was believed to be a sin (''prohibitionism'').&lt;ref name="Gentry"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gentry |first=Kenneth |authorlink=Kenneth Gentry |title=God Gave Wine |publisher=Oakdown |year=2001 |isbn=0-9700326-6-8 |pages=3ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Protestant churches, particularly [[Methodism|Methodists]] and other [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] groups, advocated abstentionism and were early leaders in the [[temperance movement]] of the 19th and 20th centuries. Today, all three positions exist in Christianity, but the historic position remains the most common worldwide, due to the adherence by the largest bodies of Christians, such as [[Anglicanism]], [[Lutheranism]], [[Roman Catholicism]], and [[Eastern Orthodoxy]].&lt;ref name="Miller2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Stephen M.|title=100 Tough Questions about God and the Bible|date=15 April 2014|publisher=[[Baker Academic]]|language=English|isbn=9781441263520|page=225|quote=Most, however, preach moderation: Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran, and Eastern Orthodox.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alcoholic beverage]]s appear in the [[Bible]], both in usage and in [[poetry|poetic]] expression.

Both the [[climate]] and land of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], where most of the Bible takes place, were well-suited to growing grapes,&lt;ref name="Ewing"&gt;Ewing, p. 824.&lt;/ref&gt; and the wine that the vineyards produced was a valued commodity in ancient times, both for local consumption and for its value in trade.&lt;ref&gt;See Broshi, ''passim'' (for instance, p. 29: Palestine was "a country known for its good wines").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Compare [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2Ch2:3,10 2Ch 2:3,10]&lt;/ref&gt; Trade with Egypt was quite extensive. Jews were a wine-drinking culture well before the foundation of Rome. Vintage wines were found in the tomb of King Scorpion in Hierakonpolis. Archaeological evidence suggests that Semitic predecessors were thought to be responsible for the vintages that were found in the tomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gately |first1=Iain |title=Drink : a Cultural History of Alcohol |date=2008 |publisher=Gotham Books |location=New York |isbn=978-1-592-40464-3 |page=41 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vineyards were protected from robbers and animals by walls, hedges, and manned [[watchtower]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps80:8-15;Is5:1-2;Mk12:1;SS2:15 Ps 80:8-15; Is 5:1f; Mk 12:1; compare SS 2:15]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MigdalHaemek5.jpg|thumb|left|Ancient [[wine press]] in Israel with the pressing area in the center and the collection vat off to the bottom left.]] In Hebrew, grape juice need not ferment before it is called wine: "When the grapes have been crushed and the wine [yayin] begins to flow, even though it has not descended into the cistern and is still in the wine press...".&lt;ref&gt;Sefer Kedushah, MaAchalot Assurot, Ch. 11, Halacha 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[harvest]] time brought much joy and play,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is16:10;Jr48:33 Compare Is 16:10; Jr 48:33]&lt;/ref&gt; as "[m]en, women and children took to the vineyard, often accompanied by the sound of music and song, from late August to September to bring in the grapes."&lt;ref name="Wine Making"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Wine Making|encyclopedia=Illustrated Dictionary of Bible Life &amp; Times|pages=374f}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broshi, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Some grapes were eaten immediately, while others were turned into raisins. Most of them, however, were put into the [[wine press]] where the men and boys trampled them, often to [[music]].&lt;ref name="Wine Making"/&gt;

The fermentation process started within six to twelve hours after pressing, and the [[must]] was usually left in the collection vat for a few days to allow the initial, "tumultuous" stage of fermentation to pass. The wine makers soon transferred it either into large earthenware jars, which were then sealed, or, if the wine were to be transported elsewhere, into wineskins (that is, partially [[Tanning (leather)|tanned]] [[domestic goat|goat]]-skins, sewn up where the legs and tail had protruded but leaving the opening at the neck).&lt;ref name="Ewing"/&gt; After six weeks, fermentation was complete, and the wine was filtered into larger containers and either sold for consumption or stored in a [[basement|cellar]] or [[cistern]], lasting for three to four years.&lt;ref name="Wine Making"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Broshi26"&gt;Broshi, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Even after a year of aging, the vintage was still called "new wine," and more aged wines were preferred.&lt;ref name="Broshi26"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk5:39;Is25:6 Lk 5:39; compare Is 25:6]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dommershausen, pp. 60-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spices and scents were often added to wine in order to hide "defects" that arose from storage that was often not sufficient to prevent all spoiling.&lt;ref&gt;Broshi, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; One might expect about 10% of any given cellar of wine to have been ruined completely, but [[vinegar]] was also created intentionally for dipping bread&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ru2:14 Ru 2:14]&lt;/ref&gt; among other uses.&lt;ref&gt;Broshi, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Lest they drink" (Prov. 31:5) Of course Daniel was absent. (Dan. 5:13) ([[National Gallery]], London)]] The Hebraic opinion of wine in the time before Christ was decidedly positive: wine is part of the world God created and is thus "necessarily inherently good,"&lt;ref&gt;Raymond, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; though excessive use is soundly condemned. The Jews emphasized joy in the goodness of creation rather than the [[temperance (virtue)|virtue of temperance]], which the [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]] advocated.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Wine formed part of the sacrifices made daily to God. (Lev 23:13)

As the Jews returned from the Babylonian exile (starting in 537 BC) and the events of the Old Testament drew to a close, wine was "a common beverage for all classes and ages, including the very young; an important source of nourishment; a prominent part in the festivities of the people; a widely appreciated medicine; an essential provision for any fortress; and an important commodity," and it served as "a necessary element in the life of the Hebrews."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hanson |first=David J. |authorlink=David J.

Although some abstentionists argue that wine in the Bible was almost always cut with water greatly decreasing its potency for inebriation,&lt;ref name="MacArthurDrunk2"/&gt; there is general agreement that, while Old Testament wine was sometimes mixed with various spices to enhance its flavor and stimulating properties, it was not usually diluted with water,&lt;ref name="GentryUndiluted"&gt;Gentry, ''God Gave Wine'', pp. 143-146: "[R]ecognized biblical scholars of every stripe are in virtual agreement on the nondiluted nature of wine in the Old Testament."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, commentary on Is 1:22: "It is remarkable that whereas the Greeks and Latins by mixed wine always understood wine diluted and lowered with water, the Hebrews on the contrary generally mean by it wine made stronger and more inebriating by the addition of higher and more powerful ingredients, such as honey, spices, defrutum, (or wine inspissated by boiling it down to two-thirds or one- half of the quantity,) myrrh, mandragora, opiates, and other strong drugs."&lt;/ref&gt; and wine mixed with water is used as an Old Testament [[metaphor]] for corruption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is1:22 Is 1:22]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the [[Greeks]], however, the cutting of wine with water was a common practice used to reduce potency and improve taste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rayburn |first=Robert S. |authorlink=Robert S.

=== Early Church ===
The [[Apostolic Fathers]] make very little reference to wine.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Clement I|Clement of Rome]] (died 100) said: "Seeing, therefore, that we are the portion of the Holy One, let us do all those things which pertain to holiness, avoiding all evil-speaking, all abominable and impure embraces, together with all drunkenness, seeking after change, all abominable lusts, detestable adultery, and execrable pride."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Clement of Rome|title=Letter to the Corinthians |url=http://saintclementofrome.blogspot.com.au/p/letter-to-corinthians.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest references from the [[Church Fathers]] make it clear that the [[early Christianity|early Church]] used in the Eucharist wine - which was customarily mixed with water.&lt;ref&gt;[[Justin Martyr]], ''[[First Apology]]'', [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.ii.lxv.html "Chapter LXV. Administration of the sacraments"] and [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.ii.lxvii.html "Chapter LXVII. Weekly worship of the Christians"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hippolytus of Rome]] (died 235) says, "By thanksgiving the bishop shall make the bread into an image of the body of Christ, and the cup of wine mingled with water according to the likeness of the blood." Quoted in {{cite journal |last=Mathison |first=Keith |authorlink=Keith Mathison |title=Protestant Transubstantiation - Part 2: Historical Testimony |url=http://thirdmill.org/newfiles/kei_mathison/TH.Mathison.Prot.Transub.2.html |journal=IIIM Magazine Online |volume=3 |issue=1 |date=January 1–7, 2001 |accessdate=2007-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Didache]], an early Christian treatise which is generally accepted to be from the late 1st century, instructs Christians to give a portion of their wine in support of a true [[prophet]] or, if they have no prophet resident with them, to the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Didache, chapter 13 |url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/didache-hoole.html#13 |accessdate=2007-03-16|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070528025425/http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/didache-hoole.html#13 |archivedate = May 28, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clement of Alexandria]] (died c.&amp;nbsp;215) wrote in a chapter about drinking that he admired the young and the old who "abstain wholly from drink," who adopt an [[Asceticism|austere life]] and "flee as far as possible from wine, shunning it as they would the danger of fire." He strongly warned youth to "flee as far as possible" from it so as not to inflame their "wild impulses." He said Christ did not teach affected by it. "...the soul itself is wisest and best when dry." He also said wine is an appropriate symbol of Jesus' blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Clement of Alexandria |authorlink=Clement of Alexandria |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf02.vi.iii.ii.ii.html |title=On Drinking |work=The Instructor, book 2, chapter 2 |accessdate=2007-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Compare the summary in Raymond, pp. 97-104.&lt;/ref&gt; He noted taking a little [[wine as medicine]] is acceptable - lest it make the health worse. Even those who are "moored by reason and time" (such that they aren't as much tempted by drunkenness after a day's work), he still encouraged to mix "as much water as possible" in with the wine to inhibit inebriation. For at all hours, let them keep their "reason unwavering, their memory active, and their body unmoved and unshaken by wine."

[[Tertullian]] (died 220) insisted clergy must be sober in church, citing the Biblical non-drinking precedent: "the Lord said to Aaron: ‘Wine and spirituous liquor shall ye not drink, thou and thy son after thee, whenever ye shall enter the tabernacle, or ascend unto the sacrificial altar; and ye shall not die.’ [Lev. 10:9] So true is it, that such as shall have ministered in the Church, being not sober, shall ‘die.’ Thus, too, in recent times He upbraids Israel: ‘And ye used to give my sanctified ones wine to drink.’ [Amos 2:12]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Tertullian |title=On Fasting, Ch. 9., From Fasts Absolute Tertullian Comes to Partial Ones And Xerophagies |url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/tertullian33.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some early Christian leaders focused on the strength and attributes of wines. They taught that two ''types'' of wine should be distinguished: wine causing joyousness and that causing [[gluttony]] (intoxicating and non-intoxicating). The hermit [[John of Egypt]] (died 395) said: "...if there is any sharp wine I excommunicate it, but I drink the good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Palladius |title="Life of the Holy Fathers", Ch. XXXV |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/pearse/morefathers/files/palladius_lausiac_02_text.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gregory of Nyssa]] (died 395) made the same distinction between types of wine, "not that wine which produces drunkenness, plots against the senses, and destroys the body, but such as gladdens the heart, the wine which the Prophet recommends"&lt;ref name="Gregory_of_Nyssa_395AD"&gt;{{cite web |year=395 |author=Gregory of Nyssa|title=Funeral Oration on Meletius |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf205.xii.ii.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Condemnation of drunkenness had increased by the late 4th-century. Church rules against drinking entertainments are found in the [[Council of Laodicea]] (363):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Synod of Laodicea| url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/PATRISTC/PII14-2.TXT}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Rule XXIV: "No one of the priesthood, from presbyters to deacons, and so on in the ecclesiastical order to subdeacons, readers, singers, exorcists, door-keepers, or any of the class of the Ascetics, ought to enter a tavern." 
# Rule LV: "NEITHER members of the priesthood nor of the clergy, nor yet laymen, may club together for drinking entertainments."

However, [[Basil the Great]] (died 379) repudiated the views of some [[dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] [[heresy|heretics]] who abhorred marriage, rejected wine, and called God's creation "polluted"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Basil the Great |authorlink=Basil the Great |chapter=Letter CXCIX: To Amphilochius, concerning the Canons |title=Basil: Letters and Select Works |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf208.html |others=Philip Schaff (ed.) |year=1895 |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf208.ix.cc.html |accessdate=2008-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and who substituted water for wine in the Eucharist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allert |first=Craig D. |title=The State of the New Testament Canon in the Second Century: Putting Tatian's Diatessaron in Perspective |journal=[[Bulletin for Biblical Research]] |issue=9 |year=1999 |page=5 |accessdate=2008-04-16 |url=http://www.earlychurch.org.uk/pdf/bbr/tatian_allert.pdf |quote=Also among the beliefs of the [heretical] Encratites is the rejection of the drinking of wine.

A minority of Christians abstained totally from alcoholic beverages. [[Saint Monica|Monica of Hippo]] (died 387) eagerly kept the strict rule of total abstinence, which her bishop [[Ambrose]] required. She had never let herself drink much at all, not even "more than one little cup of wine, diluted according to her own temperate palate, which, out of courtesy, she would taste." But now she willingly drank none at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Augustine |title="Confessions", Book VI, Ch. 2 |url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/110106.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine cited a reason for her bishop's rule: "even to those who would use it with moderation, lest thereby an occasion of excess might be given to such as were drunken." Ambrose of course expected leaders and deacons to practice the same rule too. He cited Paul's instructions to them about alcohol in [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Tim3:2-4,3:8-10 1 Timothy 3:2-4 and 3:8-10], and commented: "We note how much is required of us. The minister of the Lord should abstain from wine, so that he may be upheld by the good witness not only of the faithful but also by those who are without."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Ambrose |title="On the Duties of the Clergy", Ch. 50, section 256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, he said: "Let a widow, then, be temperate, pure in the first place from wine, that she may be pure from adultery. He will tempt you in vain, if wine tempts you not."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Ambrose |title="Concerning Widows", Ch. 7, section 40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Chrysostom]] (died 407) said: "they who do not drink take no thought of the drunken."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chrysostom |first=John |authorlink=John Chrysostom |title=Homilies on the Gospel of St. Matthew |url=http://www.catholicprimer.org/chrysostom/matthew/homily057.htm |pages=Homily LVII}}&lt;/ref&gt; So Chrysostom insisted deacons cannot taste wine at all in his homily on 1 Timothy 3:8-10: "The discretion of the blessed Paul is observable. When he would exhort the Deacons to avoid excess in wine, he does not say, 'Be not drunken,' but 'not' even 'given to much wine.' A proper caution; for if those who served in the Temple did not taste wine at all, much more should not these, For wine produces disorder of mind, and where it does not cause drunkenness, it destroys the energies and relaxes the firmness of the soul."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chrysostom |first=John |title=Homilies on the First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy, Homily XI, 1 Timothy 3:8-10 |url=http://www.bible.ca/history/fathers/NPNF1-13/npnf1-13-92.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of course he was aware that not all wines were intoxicating; they had opposite effects and were not all alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Chrysostom |title=Homilies on Ephesians, Homily XIX, Ephesians v. 15, 16, 17 |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf113.iii.iv.xx.html |quote=Like his contemporaries, Chrysostom distinguisted between types of wine, saying ‘it cannot be that one and the same thing should work opposite effects.’}}&lt;/ref&gt; His homily on [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Ti5:23 1 Timothy 5:23] shows he was not as certain heretics and immature Christians who even "blame the fruit given them by God" when saying there should be no wine. He emphasized the goodness of God's creation and adjured: "Let there be no drunkenness; for wine is the work of God, but drunkenness is the work of the devil.

[[Thomas Aquinas]] (died 1274), a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar and the "Doctor Angelicus" of the Catholic Church, says that moderation in wine is sufficient for [[salvation]] but that for certain persons perfection requires abstinence, and this was dependent upon their circumstance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Aquinas |title=Summa Theologica |chapter=Second Part of the Second Part, Question 149, Article 3 - Whether the use of wine is altogether unlawful? |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa.SS_Q149_A3.html |accessdate=2008-04-17 |quote=A man may have wisdom in two ways.

Drinking among monks was not universal, however, and in 1319 [[Bernardo Tolomei]] founded the [[Olivetan Order]], initially following a much more ascetic Rule than Benedict's. The Olivetans uprooted all their vineyards, destroyed their wine-presses, and were "fanatical total abstainers," but the rule was soon relaxed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Almond |first=J. C. |encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia |title=Olivetans |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11244c.htm |year=1913 |quote=St. Bernard Ptolomei's idea of monastic reform was that which had inspired every founder of an order or congregation since the days of St. Benedict—a return to the primitive life of solitude and austerity. Severe corporal mortifications were ordained by rule and inflicted in public. The usual ecclesiastical and conventual fasts were largely increased and the daily food was bread and water&amp;nbsp;... They were also fanatical total abstainers; not only was St. Benedict's kindly concession of a hemina of wine rejected, but the vineyards were rooted up and the wine-presses and vessels destroyed&amp;nbsp;... Truly, relaxation was inevitable. It was never reasonable that the heroic austerities of St. Bernard and his companions should be made the rule, then and always, for every monk of the order&amp;nbsp;...

Wine has a place in the [[Christian liturgy|divine services]] of the [[Orthodox Church]], not only in the celebration of the [[Divine Liturgy]] (Eucharist), but also at the [[artoklassia]] (blessing of bread, wine, wheat and oil during the [[All Night Vigil]]) and in the "common cup" of wine which is shared by the bride and groom during an Orthodox [[wedding]] service. A small amount of warm wine ([[zapivka]]) is taken by the faithful together with a piece of [[antidoron]] after receiving [[Holy Communion]].

Early advocacy for abstentionism in Methodism arose in America.

Despite pressure from interested parties to relax rules of all kinds, the American Methodists afterwards reverted to Wesley's—namely, to avoid "[d]runkenness, buying or selling spirituous [i.e., distilled] liquors, or drinking them, unless in cases of extreme necessity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |last=Fox |first=Henry J. |last2=Hoyt |first2=William B. |chapter=Rule Respecting Intoxicating Liquors |title=Quadrennial Register of the Methodist Episcopal Church |year=1852 |publisher=Case, Tiffany &amp; Co. |location=Connecticut |url=https://books.google.com/?id=YNeBt07_IaUC&amp;pg=PA200 |page=200f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wesley's [[Articles of Religion (Methodist)|Articles of Religion]], adopted by the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] (a precursor of the [[United Methodist Church]]) in 1784, rejected the doctrine of transubstantiation of elements in the Lord's supper (Article XVIII), and said the use of both bread and the cup together extends to all the people (Article XIX), not only one element for laymen and two for ministers as in the Catholic practice of the time.

[[Adam Clarke]] explained 1 Cor. 11:21-22: "One was hungry, and the other was drunken, μεθυει, was filled to the full; this is the sense of the word in many places of Scripture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=Adam|title=Adam Clarke's Commentary, 1 Corinthians 11|url=http://www.studylight.org/commentaries/acc/1-corinthians-11.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Coke and Asbury commented on it saying Paul's objection here concerned the Corinthians (including laymen) and "... their both ''eating'' and ''drinking'' most intemperately" thereby despising the Church of God and shaming those who have nothing.&lt;ref&gt;Coke and Asbury, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zOoCAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA150#PPA24,M1 notes on Article XIX], p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, British Methodists, in particular the [[Primitive Methodists]], took a leading role in the temperance movement of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Methodists saw alcoholic beverages, and [[alcoholism]], as the root of many [[social ills]] and tried to persuade people to abstain from these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Carradice |first=Phil |title=The temperance movement in Wales |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/wales/posts/the-temperance-movement-in-wales |publisher=BBC |accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temperance appealed strongly to the Methodist doctrines of [[sanctification]] and perfection.

This continues to be reflected in the teaching of Methodist denominations today. For example, ¶91 of the 2014 ''Discipline'' of the [[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]] states:&lt;ref name="AWMC2014"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Discipline of the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection (Original Allegheny Conference)|year=2014|publisher=[[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]]|location=[[Salem, Ohio|Salem]]|language=English|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the midst of the social upheaval accompanying the [[American Revolution]] and [[urbanization]] induced by the [[Industrial Revolution]], drunkenness was on the rise and was blamed as a major contributor to the increasing poverty, unemployment, and crime. Yet the temperate sentiments of the Methodists were shared only by a few others, until the publication of a tract by eminent physician and patriot [[Benjamin Rush]], who argued against the use of "ardent spirits" (i.e., distilled alcohol), introduced the notion of addiction, and prescribed abstinence as the only cure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williamson |first=G.

Some denominational statements required "unfermented wine" for the Lord's Supper.

From 1838 to 1845, [[Theobald Mathew (temperance reformer)|Father Mathew]], the Irish apostle of temperance, administered an abstinence pledge to some three to four million of his countrymen, though his efforts had little permanent effect there, and then starting in 1849 to more than 500,000 Americans, chiefly his fellow Irish Catholics, who formed local temperance societies but whose influence was limited. In 1872 the [[Catholic Total Abstinence Union of America]] united these societies and by 1913 reached some 90,000 members including the juvenile, women's, and priestly contingents. The Union pursued a platform of "moral suasion" rather than legislative prohibition and received two papal commendations. In 1878 [[Pope Leo XIII]] praised the Union's determination to abolish drunkenness and "all incentive to it," and in 1906 [[Pope Pius X]] lauded its efforts in "persuading men to practise one of the principal Christian virtues — temperance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Liese |first=W. |last2=Keating |first2= J. |last3=Shanley |first3= W. |year=1912 |title=Temperance Movements |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |location=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |accessdate=2008-05-19 |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14482a.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the 18th Amendment was up for consideration, however, [[Sebastian Gebhard Messmer|Archbishop Messmer]] of [[Milwaukee]] denounced the prohibition movement as being founded on an "absolutely false principle" and as trying to undermine the Church's "most sacred mystery," the Eucharist, and he forbade pastors in his [[diocese|archdiocese]] from assisting the movement but suggested they preach on moderation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Prelate Assails Dry Law.

Many pledged themselves by a sudden impulse, moved thereto by the enthusiasm of assembled multitudes, with little, clear, intelligent, fixed conviction of the evils inseparable from the habits which they were renouncing. The pope, their infallible teacher both in regard to faith and morals, had never pronounced moderate drinking a sin, either mortal or venial; and even occasional drunkenness had been treated in the confessional as a trivial offence....

Similarly, while the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] and [[Anglican]] churches felt some pressure, they did not alter their moderationist position.

"Despite the Scottish heritage of whisky drinking, Presbyterians were strong supporters of temperance and prohibition. They believed (with some justification) that ‘the demon drink’ was destructive of family life. The church was a stronghold of the temperance organisation the Band of Hope... which encouraged youth... to sign a pledge to abstain from alcohol.

==Current views==&lt;!-- This section is linked above; don't rename it without changing the link too --&gt;
Today, the views on alcohol in Christianity can be divided into moderationism, abstentionism, and prohibitionism. Abstentionists and prohibitionists are sometimes lumped together as "[[Teetotalism|teetotalers]]" (compare [[list of teetotalers]]), sharing some similar arguments. However, prohibitionists abstain from alcohol as a matter of law (that is, they believe God requires abstinence in all ordinary circumstances), while abstentionists abstain as a matter of prudence (that is, they believe total abstinence is the wisest and most loving way to live in the present circumstances).&lt;ref name="Gentry"/&gt;

Some groups of Christians fall entirely or virtually entirely into one of these categories, while others are divided between them. Fifty-two percent of [[Evangelicals|Evangelical]] leaders around the world say drinking alcohol is incompatible with being a good Evangelical. Even now nominally "Christian" countries still have 42% who say it is incompatible.&lt;ref name="Global-Survey-Evangelical-Protestant-Leaders"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2011/06/22/global-survey-of-evangelical-protestant-leaders/ |title=Global Survey of Evangelical Protestant Leaders |publisher=[[Pew Forum]] |year=2011 |accessdate=2013-10-31 |quote=[E]vangelical leaders are divided over the consumption of alcohol. About four-in-ten (42%) say it is compatible with being a good evangelical, while 52% say it is incompatible. Leaders from sub-Saharan Africa are especially likely to oppose alcohol use; 78% of them say it is incompatible with being a good evangelical, as do 78% of evangelical leaders who live in Muslim-majority countries.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evangelicals in Asia, Africa, and also in [[Muslim-majority countries]] are decidedly against drinking.

Moderationism argues that, according to the biblical and traditional witness, (1) alcohol is a good gift of God that is rightly used in the Eucharist and for making the heart merry, and (2) while its dangers are real, it may be used wisely and moderately rather than being shunned or prohibited because of potential abuse.&lt;ref name="ProtTrans1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ProtTrans4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meyers1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Meyers |first=Jeffrey J. |title=Concerning Wine and Beer, Part 1 |journal=Rite Reasons, Studies in Worship |issue=48 |date=November 1996 |url=http://www.biblicalhorizons.com/rite-reasons/no-48-concerning-wine-and-beer-part-1/ |accessdate=2007-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meyers2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Meyers |first=Jeffrey J. |title=Concerning Wine and Beer, Part 2 |journal=Rite Reasons, Studies in Worship |issue=49 |date=January 1997 |url=http://www.biblicalhorizons.com/rite-reasons/no-49-concerning-wine-and-beer-part-2/ |accessdate=2007-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moderationism holds that temperance (that is, moderation or self-control) in all of one's behavior, not abstinence, is the biblical norm.&lt;ref&gt;Pierard, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gonzales"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gonzales, Jr. |first=Robert R. |work=RBS Tabletalk |publisher=Reformed Baptist Seminary |url=http://blog.rbseminary.org/2008/08/the-son-of-man-came-drinking-was-jesus-a-social-drinker-part-i/ |title=The Son of Man Came Drinking |accessdate=2010-02-15 |quote=[E]ven if the wine Jesus drank had a lower alcohol context than today's wine, the issue is still moderation not abstinence.

On the first point, moderationists reflect the Hebrew mindset that all creation is good.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond, ''passim'', especially pp. 48f. He adds on p. 85, "St. Paul regards wine as intrinsically good, 'for every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it be received with thanksgiving' [ [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Ti+4:3-4 1Ti 4:3f]&amp;nbsp;]."&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient [[Canons of the Apostles]], which became part of [[Canon Law]] in the eastern and western Churches, likewise allows Church leaders and laity to abstain from wine for [[mortification of the flesh]] but requires that they not "abominate" or detest it, which attitude "blasphemously abuses" the good creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| accessdate=2013-03-28 | editor-last=Schaff |editor-first=Philip | editor-link=Philip Schaff |title=Ante-Nicean Fathers |volume=VII |chapter=The Ecclesiastical Canons of the Same Holy Apostles |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf07.ix.ix.vi.html | quote=51. If any bishop, or presbyter, or deacon, or indeed any one of the sacerdotal catalogue, abstains from marriage, flesh, and wine, not for his own exercise, but because he abominates these things, forgetting that 'all things were very good,' and that 'God made man male and female,' and blasphemously abuses the creation, either let him reform, or let him be deprived [of his office], and be cast out of the Church; and the same for one of the laity.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Going further, [[John Calvin]] says that "it is lawful to use wine not only in cases of necessity, but also thereby to make us merry,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Calvin |first=John |url=http://ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom11.xiii.iii.html#xiii.iii-p15.1 |work=Commentary on the Psalms |title=On Ps 104:15 |accessdate=2007-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in his Genevan Catechism, he answers that wine is appropriate in the Lord's Supper because "by wine the hearts of men are gladdened, their strength recruited, and the whole man strengthened, so by the blood of our Lord the same benefits are received by our souls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Calvin |first=John |url=http://www.reformed.org/documents/calvin/geneva_catachism/geneva_catachism.html |title=Catechism of the Church of Geneva |year=1545 |accessdate=2007-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the second point, [[Martin Luther]] employs a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' to counter the idea that abuse should be met with disuse: "[W]e must not&amp;nbsp;... reject [or] condemn anything because it is abused&amp;nbsp;... [W]ine and women bring many a man to misery and make a fool of him ([[Sirach|Ecclus]]. {{bibleverse-nb||Ecclesiasticus|19:2}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Ecclesiasticus|31:30}}); so [we would need to] kill all the women and pour out all the wine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Luther |first=Martin |url=http://www.godrules.net/library/luther/NEW1luther_b8.htm |title=Fourth Invocavit sermon from 1522 |work=Works, American Edition, vol. 51, p. 85 |accessdate=2007-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In dealing with drunkenness at the [[agape feast|love feast]] in [[Corinth]],&lt;ref name="1Co11:20-22"/&gt; St. Paul does not require total abstinence from drink but love for one another that would express itself in moderate, selfless behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Compare [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Co+11:33-34, 1Co 11:33f]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raymond, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; However, moderationists approve of voluntary abstinence in several cases, such as for a person who finds it too difficult to drink in moderation and for the benefit of the "weaker brother," who would err because of a stronger Christian exercising his or her liberty to drink.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond, pp. 83f.&lt;/ref&gt;

While all moderationists approve of using (fermented) wine in the Eucharist in principle (Catholics, the Orthodox, and Anglicans require it),&lt;ref name="AltarWine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EucharistWine"/&gt; because of prohibitionist heritage and a sensitivity to those who wish to abstain from alcohol, many offer either grape juice or both wine and juice at their celebrations of the Lord's Supper.&lt;ref name="ELCA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UCC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CRCNA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wine or grape juice| url=http://opc.org/qa.html?question_id=138|publisher=Orthodox Presbyterian Church|accessdate=2007-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Christians mix some water with the wine following ancient tradition, and some attach a [[mysticism|mystical]] significance to this practice.&lt;ref&gt;Cross and Livingstone, p. 1767.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=New Catholic Encyclopedia |edition=2nd |publisher=Thomson Gale |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-7876-4004-0 |volume=14

==== Comparison ====
In addition to lexical and historical differences,&lt;ref name="Meyers1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See the thorough discussion of lexical differences in Gentry, ''God Gave Wine'', pp. 33-104.&lt;/ref&gt; moderationism holds that prohibitionism errs by confusing the Christian virtues of temperance and moderation with abstinence and prohibition and by locating the evil in the object that is abused rather than in the heart and deeds of the abuser.&lt;ref name="RaymondP25"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ProtTrans4"/&gt; Moreover, moderationists suggest that the prohibitionist and abstentionist positions denigrate God's creation and his good gifts and deny that it is not what goes into a man that makes him evil but what comes out (that is, what he says and does).&lt;ref name="RaymondP81"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Compare [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt+15:11,18;Mk+7:20,23 Mt 15:11,18; Mk 7:20,23].&lt;/ref&gt; The Bible never uses the word 'wine' of communion. Yet moderationists hold that in banishing wine from communion and dinner tables, prohibitionists and abstentionists go against the 'witness of the Bible' and the church throughout the ages and implicitly adopt a [[Pharisees|Pharisaical]] [[moralism]] that is at odds with what moderationists consider the right approach to biblical [[ethics]] and the doctrines of [[sin]] and [[sanctification]].&lt;ref name="Meyers2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rayburn |first=Robert S. |title=Revising the Practice of the Lord's Supper at Faith Presbyterian Church No. 4, Wine, No. 3 |url=http://sermons.faithtacoma.org/Revising_Communion/Revising_FPC_LordsSupper_No.4_Wine_No.3_Feb.11.2001.htm |date=2001-02-11 |accessdate=2012-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810103155/http://sermons.faithtacoma.org/Revising_Communion/Revising_FPC_LordsSupper_No.4_Wine_No.3_Feb.11.2001.htm |archivedate=2011-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gentry, ''God Gave Wine'', pp. 105-130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abstentionists believe that although alcohol consumption is not inherently sinful or necessarily to be avoided in all circumstances, it is generally not the wisest or most prudent choice.&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{cite web |last=Arterburn |first=Stephen |authorlink=Stephen Arterburn |url=http://www.christianity.com/11546319/print/ |title=Myths and Facts about Alcohol Consumption and Jim Burns |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-11-19 |quote=For the general population, no specific Scriptures forbid wine consumption in small amounts&amp;nbsp;... In our society, with so much damage being done by drinking, many who think it is okay to drink need to reexamine the practice&amp;nbsp;... And for us parents who have to be concerned about the behaviors we are modeling, abstinence is the best choice.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most abstentionists do not require abstinence from alcohol for membership in their churches, they do often require it for leadership positions.&lt;ref name="MacArthurQ&amp;A"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Piper"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Akin"&gt;{{cite web |last=Akin |first=Daniel L. |authorlink=Daniel L. Akin |url=http://www.bpnews.net/bpcolumn.asp?ID=2298 |title=FIRST-PERSON: The case for alcohol abstinence |publisher=[[Baptist Press]] |date=2006-06-30 |accessdate=2013-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605230618/http://www.bpnews.net/bpcolumn.asp?ID=2298 |archivedate=2013-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some reasons commonly given for voluntary abstention are:
# The Bible warns that alcohol can hinder moral discretion. As [[#Drunkenness|discussed above]], Proverbs 31:4-5 warns kings and rulers that they might "forget what is decreed, and pervert the rights of all the afflicted." Some abstentionists speak of alcohol as "corrupt[ing]" the body and as a substance that can "impair my judgment and further distract me from God's will for my life."&lt;ref name="Land"&gt;{{cite web |last=Land |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Land |url=http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?id=23678 |title=FIRST-PERSON: The great alcohol debate |publisher=[[Baptist Press]] |date=2006-07-24 |accessdate=2013-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606002004/http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?id=23678 |archivedate=2013-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Christians must be sensitive to the "weaker brother", that is, the Christian who believes imbibing to be a sin. On this point MacArthur says, "[T]he primary reason I don't do a lot of things I could do, including drinking wine or any alcoholic beverage, [is] because I know some believers would be offended by it&amp;nbsp;... [M]any Christians will drink their beer and wine and flaunt their liberty no matter what anyone thinks. Consequently, there is a rift in the fellowship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=MacArthur |first=John |url=http://www.gty.org/resources/Study-Guide-Chapter/45-111 |title=Unity in Action: Building Up One Another Without Offending--Part 2 |accessdate=2007-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Christians should make a public statement against drunkenness because of the negative consequences it can have on individuals, families, and society as a whole. Some abstentionists believe that their witness as persons of [[moral character]] is also enhanced by this choice.&lt;ref name="Akin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Land"/&gt;

Additionally, abstentionists argue that while drinking may have been more acceptable in ancient times (for instance, using wine to purify [[pollution|polluted]] drinking water),&lt;ref name="MacArthurQ&amp;A"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Guzik |first=David |url=http://www.enduringword.com/commentaries/5405.htm |title=Commentary on 1 Ti 5:23 |accessdate=2007-01-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208100335/http://www.enduringword.com/commentaries/5405.htm |archive-date=2006-12-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; modern circumstances have changed the nature of a Christian's responsibility in this area. First, some abstentionists argue that wine in biblical times was weaker and diluted with water such that drunkenness was less common,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |first=Kenneth L. |last=Barker |first2=John R. |last2=Kohlenberger III|chapter=Commentary on 1 Ti 5:23 |year=1999 |title=Zondervan NIV Bible Commentary |isbn=978-0-310-57840-6 |publisher=Zondervan Pub.

J. |title=Total abstinence |encyclopedia=[[The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge]] |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc11/Page_468.html |page=468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Comparison ====
On historical and lexical grounds, many abstentionists reject the argument of prohibitionists that wine in the Bible was not alcoholic and that imbibing is nearly always a sin.&lt;ref name="SchaffHerzog"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MacArthurQ&amp;A"/&gt; Piper summarizes the abstentionist position on this point:
:The consumption of food and drink is in itself no basis for judging a person's standing with God&amp;nbsp;... [The Apostle Paul's] approach to these abuses [of food and drink] was never to forbid food or drink. It was always to forbid what destroyed God's temple and injured faith. He taught the principle of love, but did not determine its application with regulations in matters of food and drink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Piper |first=John |title=Flesh Tank and Peashooter Regulations |url=http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/Sermons/ByDate/1982/330_Flesh_Tank_and_Peashooter_Regulations/ |date=1982-01-17 |accessdate=2007-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abstentionists also reject the position of moderationists that in many circumstances Christians should feel free to drink for pleasure because abstentionists see alcohol as inherently too dangerous and not "a necessity for life or good living,"&lt;ref name="MacArthurDrunk2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Akin"/&gt; with some even going so far as to say, "Moderation is the cause of the liquor problem."&lt;ref name="Akin"/&gt;

And, behold, this should be wine, yea, pure wine of the grape of the vine, of your own make [compare [[s:The Doctrine and Covenants/Section 27|D&amp;C 27:2-4]]]. And, again, strong drinks are not for the belly, but for the washing of your bodies."&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Church now uses water instead of wine in the sacrament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/gs/s/2 |title=Guide to the Scriptures: Sacrament |year=2006 |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |accessdate=2007-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since 1851, the Word of Wisdom's advice for wise living has been considered "a binding commandment on all Church members."&lt;ref name="Benson"/&gt;

Many Prohibitionist Christians have claimed that the wine Jesus created in John 2 and drank at the Last Supper were non-alcoholic grape juice; however, the Greek word ''oinos'', used in the account of the wedding feast in Cana, is also used to describe alcohol in Ephesians 5:18.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gotquestions.org/Jesus-water-wine.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2975">The '''Ciarraige Airtech''' were a population-group found in [[medieval]] [[Ireland]].

==Origins==

The Ciarraige Airtech were one of three branches of the [[Ciarraige]] located close to each other in central [[Connacht]]. They were the [[Ciarraige Aí]], Ciarraige Airtig and [[Ciarraighe Locha na nÁirne]], along the east [[County Mayo]]/west-central [[County Roscommon]] area. They were thought to have once formed a single over-kingdom which was broken up by the rise of the [[Uí Briúin]] in the 8th and 9th centuries. 

In 2000, [[Nollaig Ó Muraíle]] wrote of them as follows (p.168):

"The most obscure of the (supposed) three branches of Ciarraige Connacht were those of Airtech who are mentioned in the Patrician documents, in the [[Lebor Gabála|Lebor Gabála Érenn]], in the saints' genealogies, and, for the last time, in the early-fourteenth-century annals. Their territory - variously referred to as Crích Airtig and Mag nAirtig - was centred on the parish of Tibohine, baony of Frenchpark (around the present village of Loughglynn), but covered parts of adjacent parishes (including Castlemmore, Kilcolman and Kilnamanagh) in north-west roscommon. Overall, their impact on Connacht history must be adjudged very slight."

==Annalistic references==

* 1315 - ''As for Maelruanaid Mac Diarmata, when he heard that Diarmait Gall had established himself in the seat of dignity of his own family and on the Rock of Loch Key, and that he had been sent to be made king at Cruachan, and when his own cows had been slaughtered in Glenn Fathraim, he marched with his household troops and retainers to the Callow of the Rock and, turning his back to the Shannon, he plundered from that river to Cara, where the eraghts of the '''Three Ciarraige''' were assembled with their flocks and herds, namely the '''Western Ciarraige''', the '''Ciarraige of Mag nAi''' and the '''Ciarraige of Airtech;''' and it is not likely that there was made in that age a fiercer or a more booty-getting attack than this raid.''

[[Image:Lewisham_clc.JPG|260px|right|thumb|A City Learning Centre in Lewisham]]
A '''City Learning Centre''' is a facility in the [[United Kingdom]] which provides  [[Information and Communications Technology|ICT]]-based learning opportunities for the pupils at the host school, for pupils at a network of surrounding schools and for the wider community. The centre aims to enhance learning across the whole [[curriculum]] by providing courses and opportunities for individual pupils from schools around the area. The [[multimedia]] establishments cater to any age and level of ICT understanding, and some offer conferencing facilities which are pre-bookable by local businesses.

==Growth==
The number of established City Learning Centres in [[England]] exceeded 100, and steadily grew since their introduction in 2001. Many City Learning Centres are established on the same ground as an existing school (for example, South Sefton City Learning Centre was established on the grounds of [[Savio High School]]).

==Funding==
City Learning Centres were heavily funded by the [[British Government]] through the [[Excellence in Cities]] programme to ensure they were able to cater for the requirements of local schools and businesses within the area, with an emphasis on enhancing opportunities in disadvantaged areas. Up to £1.2 million of Revenue Funding per CLC was available for capital and initial start-up costs plus recurring funding of £220,000 per annum.

After their first year of operation, an additional £150,000 was available for Capital Redevelopment Funding to ensure their technology remains at the forefront. However, unlike revenue funding, it was only released from the first full [[financial year]] that a CLC was fully operational, requiring that a Centre must be open before 31 March in order to trigger funding in the following financial year. This however was limited to building and structure work, [[computer hardware]] and [[software]], but not the funding required for subscriptions for such software. It should not be used to pay for consumables, staffing costs or other non-CLC purposes. In addition, this money must be spent on the Centre and not simply shared out amongst its partner schools, unless it is to improve connectivity between a Centre and partner schools.

Funding for CLCs was completely abolished when the coalition government came into power in May 2010. The majority of CLCs have closed leaving some still operating. City Learning Centre's now generate income directly from schools, local authorities, others work with businesses or a combination of all of these.

==Usage==
The Centres are there for schools to use and to come up with interesting, [[innovative]] and replicable lesson plans, extra curricular activities and to discover new ways of using technology in the classroom. An important reason for using the Centres, as well as spreading technology more widely, is that it encourages schools to work more co-operatively with each other, sharing ideas as they share resources. It means the Centres are able to be equipped with more specialist technology that would otherwise be cost-effective for individual schools, and will be a 'draw' for pupils and the community as a place to experience the latest technology, as well as meet and exchange ideas. In cases where transport is difficult (or for times when getting to the Centre isn't practical), schools will be able to access the Centres' resources remotely through a '[[hub and spoke]]' arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standards.dfes.gov.uk/local/excellence/nlett3/news3_p3_article.html The Standards Site - Excellence in Cities&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926233821/http://www.standards.dfes.gov.uk/local/excellence/nlett3/news3_p3_article.html |date=2007-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
City Learning Centres offer a wide range of activities and facilities to the pupils in the surrounding area. Some of the facilities or available activities include:
*Use of computer facilities not available in schools.
*Use of expertise in teaching and learning not available in schools.
*Use of professional [[Apple Macs]] for activities such as video editing.
*Use of specialist video editing equipment and software.
*Facilities to print large scale industrial-size printing.
*[[Synergy School Radio | School radio]] stations.
* Consultancy on the use of a range of technologies within the curriculum.
* Expertise in the use of mobile devices such as the iPad in teaching and learning.

'''Crime in Washington, D.C.''', is directly related to [[Demographics of Washington, D.C.|the city's demographics]], [[Geography of Washington, D.C.|geography]], and unique criminal justice system. The District's population reached a peak of 802,178 in 1950. Shortly thereafter, the city began [[White flight|losing residents]], and by 1980 [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] had lost one-quarter of its population. The population loss to the suburbs also created a new demographic pattern, which divided affluent neighborhoods west of [[Rock Creek Park]] from more crime-ridden and blighted areas to the east.

Despite being the headquarters of multiple federal law enforcement agencies, such as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and United States [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), the nationwide [[crack epidemic]] of the 1980s and 1990s greatly affected the city and led to large increases in crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/history/1985-1990.html|title=DEA History Book, 1985 - 1990|publisher=Drug Enforcement Administration|accessdate=2008-12-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823024931/http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/history/1985-1990.html|archive-date=2006-08-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of homicides in Washington peaked in 1991 at 482,&lt;ref name=disastercenternum&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/dccrime.htm|title=District of Columbia Crime Rates 1960 - 2016|publisher=Disaster Center|accessdate=2017-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; a rate of 80.6 homicides per 100,000 residents,&lt;ref name=disastercenterrate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/dccrime.htm|title=District of Columbia Crime Index Rates Per 100,000 Inhabitants|publisher=Disaster Center|accessdate=2017-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the city eventually became known as the "murder capital" of the United States.&lt;ref name=mcapital&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/13/us/13deecee.html?_r=1&amp;n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FPeople%2FW%2FWilliams%2C%20Anthony%20A.|title=Washington Officials Try to Ease Crime Fear |last=Urbina|first=Ian|date=2006-07-13|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crime rate started to fall in the mid-1990s as the [[crack cocaine]] epidemic gave way to economic revitalization projects and as incarceration rates increased. [[Gentrification]] efforts have also started to transform the demographics of distressed neighborhoods, recently leading to the first rise in the District's population in 60 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://washingtonexaminer.com/local/dc/2010/12/dcs-population-tops-600k-marking-first-growth-60-years|title=D.C.'s population grows for first time in 60 years|author=Liz Farmer|date=2010-10-21|work=[[Washington Examiner]]|accessdate=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-2000s, crime rates in Washington dropped to their lowest levels in over 20 years. As in many major cities, crime remains a significant factor in D.C., especially in the city's northwestern neighborhoods, which tend to be more affluent, draw more tourists, and have more vibrant nightlife.&lt;ref name=klein2006&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/12/AR2006101201813.html|title=Liveliest D.C.

According to [[Uniform Crime Reports|Uniform Crime Report]] statistics compiled by the FBI, there were 1,330.2 violent crimes per 100,000 people reported in the District of Columbia in 2010. There were also 4,778.9 property crimes per 100,000 reported during the same period.&lt;ref name=ucr2007tb4&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/tables/10tbl04.xls|title=Crime in the United States by Region, Geographic Division, and State, 2009-2010|date=September 2009|work=Crime in the United States, 2007|accessdate=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average violent crime rate in the District of Columbia from 1960 through 1999 was 1,722 violent crimes per 100,000 population,&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Savage, "Interpreting 'Percent Black:' An Analysis of Race and Violent Crime in Washington, DC", ''Journal of Ethnicity in Criminal Justice''  Volume:4  Issue:1/2  (2006), 29&amp;ndash;63.&lt;/ref&gt; and violent crime, since peaking in the mid 1990s, decreased by 50% in the 1995&amp;ndash;2010 period (with property crime having decreased by 49.8% during the same period).
However, violent crime is still more than three times the national average of 403.6 reported offenses per 100,000 people in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/tables/10tbl01.xls|title=Violent Crime|year=2010|work=Crime in the United States, 2010|accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, Washington, D.C., was known as the "murder capital",&lt;ref name="observer"&gt;{{cite news |title=Drugs: Redemption in Crack City |work=[[The Observer]] |date=1994-10-23 |author=Vulliamy, Ed}}&lt;/ref&gt; experiencing 482 homicides in 1991.&lt;ref name="disastercenternum"/&gt;  The elevated crime levels were associated with the introduction of crack cocaine during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The crack was brought into Washington, D.C. by [[Illegal drug trade in Colombia|Colombian cartels]] and sold in drug markets such as "The Strip" (the largest in the city) located a few blocks north of the [[United States Capitol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Making a D.C.

After the 1991 peak there was a downward trend through to the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="Washington Times"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jan/1/dc-homicides-drop-half-last-decade/ |title=D.C. homicides drop by half in last decade |publisher=Washington Times |date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, 242 homicides occurred,&lt;ref name="homicidereport"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mpdc.dc.gov/mpdc/frames.asp?doc=/mpdc/lib/mpdc/publications/allreports/homicidereport.pdf |title=A Study of Homicides in the District of Columbia |publisher=Metropolitan Police Department, District of Columbia |date=October 2001 |format=PDF |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the downward trend continued in the 2000s. In 2012, Washington, D.C. had only 92 homicides in 91 separate incidents, the lowest annual tally since 1963.&lt;ref name="homicidewatch.org"&gt;Homicide Watch D.C., "92," [http://homicidewatch.org/2013/01/01/92/], January 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The Metropolitan Police Department's official tally is 88 homicides, but that number does not include four deaths that were ruled self-defense or justifiable homicide by citizen.&lt;ref name="homicidewatch.org"/&gt; The cause of death listed on the four case records is homicide and MPD includes those cases in tallying homicide case closures at the end of the year.&lt;ref name="homicidewatch.org"/&gt;
 
As Washington neighborhoods undergo [[gentrification]], crime has been displaced further east. Crime in neighboring [[Prince George's County, Maryland]], initially experienced an increase, but has recently witnessed steep declines as poorer residents moved out of the city into the nearby suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazette.net/stories/01142010/prinnew162102_32559.php |title=Crime in Prince George's is at lowest level since 1975, police say |publisher=Gazette.net |date=2010-01-14 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crime has declined both in the District and the suburbs in recent years. There was an average of 11 robberies each day across the District of Columbia in 2006 which is far below the levels experienced in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mpdc.dc.gov/mpdc/cwp/view,a,1239,q,547256,mpdcNav_GID,1556.asp |title=Citywide Crime Statistics Annual Totals, 1993-2005 |publisher=Metropolitan Police Department |accessdate=2008-12-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522125604/http://mpdc.dc.gov/mpdc/cwp/view,a,1239,q,547256,mpdcNav_GID,1556.asp |archive-date=2008-05-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, 42 crimes in the District were characterized as [[Hate crime laws in the United States|hate crimes]]; over 70% of the reports classified as hate crimes were a result of a bias against the victim's perceived [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref name=hc2008&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2008/data/table_13dc.html|title=Table 13 - DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA - Hate Crime Statistics 2008:|date=October 2009|work=Hate Crime Statistics, 2008|accessdate=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those findings continue the trend from previous years, although the total number of hate crimes is down from 57 in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2006/table13dc.html|title=District of Columbia Hate Crime Incidents per Bias Motivation and Quarter|date=November 2007|work=Hate Crime Statistics, 2006|accessdate=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 48 in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2005/table13washdc.htm|title=District of Columbia Hate Crime Incidents per Bias Motivation and Quarter|date=October 2006|work=Hate Crime Statistics, 2005|accessdate=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012, the number of hate crimes reported were 81, and dropped to 70 in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Noble |first=Andrea |date=19 August 2014 |title=Race-based hate crimes spike in D.C.; whites most common victims, but underreporting feared |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/19/race-based-hate-crimes-spike-in-dc/ |newspaper=Washington Times |publisher=The Washington Times, LLC |accessdate=21 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law enforcement===
{{see also|List of law enforcement agencies in the District of Columbia}}

[[Image:DChomicides.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Homicides in Washington, D.C. are concentrated in eastern neighborhoods.]]
Law enforcement in Washington, D.C. is complicated by a network of overlapping federal and city agencies. The primary agency responsible for law enforcement in the District of Columbia is the [[Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia|Metropolitan Police Department]] (MPD). The MPD is a city agency headed by the Chief of Police, currently Peter Newsham, who is appointed by the [[List of mayors of Washington, D.C.|mayor]]. The Metropolitan Police has 3,800 sworn officers and operates much like other municipal police departments elsewhere in the country. However, given the unique status of Washington as the United States capital, the MPD is adept at providing crowd control and security at large events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mpdc.dc.gov/mpdc/cwp/view,a,1230,q,540333,mpdcNav_GID,1529,mpdcNav,&amp;#0124;31458&amp;#0124;.asp|title=Brief History of the MPDC|publisher=Metropolitan Police Department|accessdate=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its name, the MPD only serves within the boundaries of the District of Columbia and does not have jurisdiction within the surrounding [[Washington Metropolitan Area]].

Several other local police agencies have jurisdiction within the District of Columbia, including: the [[District of Columbia Protective Services Police Department]], which is responsible for all properties owned or leased by the city government; and the [[Metro Transit Police Department]], which has jurisdiction within [[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority]] stations, [[Washington Metro|trains]], and [[Metrobus (Washington, D.C.)|buses]]. Alongside local law enforcement agencies, nearly every [[Federal law enforcement in the United States|federal law enforcement agency]] has jurisdiction within Washington, D.C. The most visible federal police agencies are the [[United States Park Police]], which is responsible for all parkland in the city, the [[United States Secret Service]], and the [[United States Capitol Police]].

A number of special initiatives undertaken by the Metropolitan Police Department in order to combat violent crime have gained particular public attention. Most notable are the city's use of "crime emergencies", which when declared by the Chief of Police, allow the city to temporarily suspend officer schedules and assign additional overtime in order to increase police presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/11/AR2006071100720.html|title=Police Chief Declares D.C. Crime Emergency|last=Klein|first=Allison|date=2006-07-12|work=The Washington Post|page=A01|accessdate=2008-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that crime emergencies do appear to reduce crime when enacted,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/20/AR2006102001031.html|title=Crackdown Is Yielding Results, Ramsey Says|last=Klein|first=Allison|date=2006-10-21|work=The Washington Post|page=B02|accessdate=2008-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; critics fault the city for relying on such temporary stop-gap measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/12/AR2006071201785.html|title=D.C.'s Crime Emergency|date=2006-07-13|work=The Washington Post|page=A22|accessdate=2008-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the city launched its Gang Intervention Project to combat the then-recent upward trend in Latino [[Gangs in the United States|gang violence]], primarily in the Columbia Heights and Shaw neighborhoods. The initiative was claimed a success when gang-related violence declined almost 90% from the start of the program to November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/15/AR2006111501632.html|title=Gang Violence Has Declined, Mayor Says|last=Schwartzman|first=Paul|date=2006-11-16|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=2008-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most controversial program designed to deter crime was a system of police checkpoints in neighborhoods particularly affected by violence. The checkpoints, in place from April 2008 through June 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wusa9.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=72724&amp;catid=158|title=DC Police End Neighborhood Checkpoints|last=Gleaton|first=Idrissa| date=2008-06-12|work=WUSA Channel 9|accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; were used in the [[Trinidad, Washington, D.C.|Trinidad]] neighborhood of Northeast Washington. The program operated by stopping cars entering a police-designated area; officers then turned away those individuals who did not live or have business in the neighborhood. Despite protests by residents, the MPD claimed the checkpoints to be a successful tool in preventing violent crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/07/AR2008060701806.html|title=In Face of Protests, Police Call Area Checkpoints a Success|last=Alexander|first=Keith L.|author2=V. Dion Haynes|date=2008-06-08|work=The Washington Post|page=C06|accessdate=2008-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in July 2010, a federal appeals court found that the checkpoints violated residents' constitutional rights. The police had no plans to continue to use the practice—with declining crime rates—but D.C. Attorney General Peter Nickles said that officers would work to find a "more creative way to deal with very unusual circumstances that is consistent with the Fourth Amendment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/10/AR2009071002750.html|title=Federal Courts Says D.C. Police Checkpoints Were Unconstitutional|last=Glod|first=Maria|date=2010-07-11|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=2010-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the first female Chief of Police of DC, [[Cathy L. Lanier]], was hired by Mayor Vincent Gray. Between 2014 and 2016, there was a spike in homicides and other violent crimes; with a 54% increase in homicides between 2014 and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://mpdc.dc.gov/page/district-crime-data-glance&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Chief Lanier resigned, mentioning her frustration with the problem of the "revolving door for offenders" contributing to high rates of violent crimes in the District.&lt;ref&gt;http://dailycaller.com/2016/09/06/dc-police-chief-fed-up-with-criminal-revolving-door-lack-of-action/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Court system===
The [[Superior Court of the District of Columbia]] hears all local civil and criminal cases in Washington, D.C. Despite the fact that the court is technically a branch of the D.C. government, the Superior Court is funded and operated by the U.S. federal government. In addition, the court's judges are appointed by the President of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dccourts.gov/dccourts/about/index.jsp|title=About the District of Columbia Courts|publisher=District of Columbia Courts|accessdate=2008-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The D.C. Superior Court should not, however, be confused with the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]], which only hears cases dealing with violations of federal law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/districtcourts.html|title=United States District Courts|publisher=Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts|accessdate=2008-12-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205020014/http://www.uscourts.gov/districtcourts.html|archivedate=2008-12-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The District of Columbia has a complicated criminal prosecution system. The [[Attorney General of the District of Columbia]] only has jurisdiction in civil proceedings and prosecuting minor offenses such as low-level [[misdemeanor]]s and traffic violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://occ.dc.gov/occ/cwp/view,a,3,q,530960,occNav_GID,1522,occNav,&amp;#0124;31705&amp;#0124;,.asp|title=Attorney General Duties|publisher=Office of the Attorney General |accessdate=2011-08-27}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; All federal offenses, local [[felony]] charges (i.e. serious crimes such as robbery, murder, aggravated assault, grand theft, and arson), and most local misdemeanors are prosecuted by the [[United States Attorney]] for the District of Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/dc/About_Us/index.html|title=About Us|publisher=United States Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia|accessdate=2008-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; United States Attorneys are appointed by the President and overseen by the [[United States Department of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/|title=United States Attorneys Mission Statement |publisher=United States Department of Justice|accessdate=2008-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This differs from elsewhere in the country where 93% of local prosecutors are directly elected and the remainder are appointed by local elected officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://federalworkforce.oversight.house.gov/documents/20080424175551.pdf|title=Statement on the District of Columbia Attorney Act, H.R. 1296|last=Boyd|first=Eugene|date=2008-04-24|publisher=House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|accessdate=2008-12-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212030451/http://federalworkforce.oversight.house.gov/documents/20080424175551.pdf|archivedate=2008-12-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that the U.S. Attorneys in the District of Columbia are neither elected nor appointed by city officials leads to criticism that the prosecutors are not responsive to the needs of local residents.&lt;ref name=councilres&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dccouncil.washington.dc.us/images/00001/20020710134641.pdf|title=Establishment of an Office of the District Attorney Advisory Referendum Approval Resolution of 2002|date=2002-07-02|publisher=Council of the District of Columbia|accessdate=2008-12-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206151350/http://dccouncil.washington.dc.us/images/00001/20020710134641.pdf|archivedate=2009-02-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, new felony prosecutions by the U.S. Attorneys in the District of Columbia have fallen 34%; from 8,016 in 2003 to 5,256 in 2007. The number of resolved felony cases has also fallen by nearly half; from 10,206 in 2003 to 5,534 in 2007. In contrast, the number of misdemeanor and civil cases prosecuted and resolved by the D.C. Attorney General's office has remained constant over the same time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dccourts.gov/dccourts/docs/DCC2007AnnualReport-StatisticalSummary.pdf|title=2007 Statistical Summary|publisher=District of Columbia Courts|accessdate=2008-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia cites the drop in prosecutions to a 14% cut in its budget. The cuts have caused the office to decrease the number of federal prosecutors from a high of 110 in 2003 to 76 in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/20/AR2007102001106_pf.html |title=D.C. Sees Sharp Drop In Federal Prosecution |work=Washington Post |date=2007-10-21 |last=Leonnig |first=Carol D. |accessdate=2008-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts to create the position of D.C. [[district attorney]] regained attention in 2008. The D.C. district attorney would be elected and have jurisdiction over all local criminal cases, thereby streamlining prosecution and making the justice system more accountable to residents. However, progress to institute such an office has stalled in Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/24/AR2008042403414.html|title=House Panel Considers Prosecutor Change|last=Sheridan|first=Mary Beth|date=2008-04-25|work=The Washington Post|page=B04|accessdate=2008-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prison system===
[[File:Lorton Reformatory - from the quad4.jpg|thumb|Until 2000 felons convicted of violating DC law were housed at [[Lorton Correctional Complex]]]]
Under the [[National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997]], prisoners were put under custody of the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]]; the [[Lorton Correctional Complex]], a prison operated by the District government in [[Lorton, Virginia]], was closed in 2000.

Washington, D.C., has enacted a number of strict [[gun politics|gun-restriction]] laws. The [[Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975]] prohibited residents from owning handguns, excluding those registered prior to February 5, 1977; however, this law was subsequently overturned in March 2007 by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] in ''[[Parker v.

The ruling was upheld in June 2008 by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in ''[[District of Columbia v. Heller]]''. Both courts held that the city's handgun ban violated the [[Right to keep and bear arms in the United States|right to keep and bear arms]] as protected under the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Barnes |title=Supreme Court Strikes Down D.C.

Since then, D.C. has further reduced gun control in several steps in 2009, 2012, 2015, 2016 and 2017. See [[Gun laws in the District of Columbia]]. The cost of permitting process was reduced. Application for re-registration was removed, "shall issue" concealed carry licensing was ordered by the Federal courts. Ammunition control laws were reduced.

Critics{{who|date=November 2018}}, citing numerous statistics{{examples|date=November 2018}}, have questioned the efficiency of these restrictions. The combination in Washington of strict gun-restriction laws and high levels of [[gun violence]] is sometimes used to criticize gun-restriction laws in general as ineffective.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3209">The '''Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006''' (SI 2006/2408) is a piece of [[secondary legislation]] in the [[United Kingdom]], which prohibits employers unreasonably discriminating against employees on grounds of age. It came into force on 1 October 2006. It is now superseded by the [[Equality Act 2010]].

==Outline==
The Regulations follow a very similar structure to existing legislation concerning sex, race, and religion. They provide a broad justification defence and a wide range of exceptions which have been criticised for undermining the concept of discrimination law by providing too many compromises on what would otherwise be unlawful.

==Default Retirement Age==
Significant issues addressed by the legislation include the provision of a national default retirement age set at 65 (to be retained for at least 5 years) and the ability for employees to request work beyond the retirement age following procedure in schedule 6 of the Regulations.

A legal challenge to the Default Retirement Age ("DRA") brought by the charity [[Age Concern and Help the Aged|Age UK]] failed in September 2009, with the judge finding that the Regulations did not breach the [[European Union]]'s [[Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation|Equal Treatment at Work Directive]].&lt;ref name=BBCChallengeFails&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8274328.stm |title=UK retirement age challenge fails |publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2009-09-25 |accessdate=2009-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCQnA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8273789.stm| title=Q&amp;A: Retirement ruling|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2009-09-25 |accessdate=2009-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coalition government announced in July 2010 that it intends to eliminate the DRA from October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC News]], [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-10796718 "Fixed retirement age to be axed"], 29 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The finalised draft regulations were published on 1 March 2010 and the DRA will be abolished so that no forced retirements will be able to take place after 5 October 2012 (at the very latest).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agediscrimination.info/Pages/ItemPage.aspx?Item=353 The finalised Employment Equality (Repeal of Retirement Age Provisions) Regulations 2011 are now out] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718051624/http://www.agediscrimination.info/Pages/ItemPage.aspx?Item=353 |date=July 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eton''', or '''Ìtón''', is a [[Bantu language]] spoken by the [[Beti-Pahuin|Eton people]] of [[Cameroon]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Velde, Mark L. O. Van de. ''A Grammar of Eton'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

It is mutually intelligible with [[Ewondo language|Ewondo]], a fact which may have delayed its study for some time.

Eton speakers inhabit the Lekié department of the [[Centre Region (Cameroon)|Centre Region]] of Cameroon, an area north of the capital [[Yaoundé]] bounded in the north by the [[Sanaga River]].

Ethnologue cites four dialects of Eton, but its speakers generally distinguish two, a northern and a southern dialect, the latter of which is closer to the Ewondo language.

The Mengisa people have largely switched to Eton. A small number continue to speak their ancestral language, [[Leti language|Leti]]. It is not clear if the ISO code for "Mengisa" refers to Eton or Leti; ''Ethnologue'' classifies Mengisa with Eton, but the code is likely based on Guthrie, who classified it with Leti.&lt;ref name=H/&gt;

== Phonology ==
Eton is a [[Tone (linguistics)|tone language]]. It makes use of three tones (low, high and dissimilating high) and [[Floating tone|floating tones]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Grammar ==
Eton is an [[Subject–verb–object|SVO language]]. As is common in Bantu, Eton has a [[noun class]] system. There are twelve classes and the class of a noun determines which agreement prefix it receives and triggers. For instance, verbs agree with the subject's noun class.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{Women in society sidebar}}
'''Gender inequality in Honduras''' has been less marked since the 1980s with a better quality of life for many, especially women. In the 2011 [[Human Development Report]], [[Honduras]] placed 121st out of 187 countries.&lt;ref name="HumanDevelopment"&gt;UNDP. Human Development Report 2011: Sustainability and Equality. 2011. Technical Report.&lt;/ref&gt; Honduras is ranked 101 of 159 countries in 2015 for its Gender Inequality Human Development Index  (.461) with an overall value of 0.511 out of 1 in terms of HDI (with 1 representing perfect inequality) &lt;ref&gt;[http://hdr.undp.org/sites/all/themes/hdr_theme/country-notes/HND.pdf "Human Development Report 2016: Human Development for Everyone"]&amp;nbsp;(PDF).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the inequalities stem from longstanding cultural norms and traditions that have been in place for hundreds or thousands of years revolving around the tasks and roles played in the agricultural society of old [[gender roles in Mesoamerica]].

==Traditional gender roles in Honduras==
[[File:HN999sRamon~DignaKtchn.jpg|thumb|A Honduran girl. Honduran traditional societal norms dictate a primarily domestic role for girls and women.]]
Traditional gender roles have men dominating the public sphere and women occupying the domestic sphere: women were not allowed to participate in what were traditional male positions in society until recently. The male is expected to be the head of the household and the main provider. This also gives men the right to make important decisions over women such as when they may procreate, how many children women may have, when and how many daily chores shall be done, if they may receive education, and whether or not they may enter the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/honduras/51.htm|title=Honduras - FAMILY|author=|date=|website=countrystudies.us|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Honduran men are expected to father many children, and there is little social stigma attached to men's premarital and extramarital sexual relationships.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Women's Issues Worldwide: Central and South America|last=Lind|first=Amy|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2003|isbn=0-313-32787-4|location=Westport, CT|pages=319}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although women who do not conform to what is socially deemed as appropriate behaviour are often subjected to violence, such violence is also targeted towards men.

==Gender Inequality Index (GII)==
In 2011, [[Honduras]] ranked 105th out of 146 countries on the United Nations Development Program's (UNDP) [[Gender Inequality Index]] (GII). This is a multidimensional index that measures and reports a country's level of gender inequality. It is represented in a single number which helps represent where countries stand on gender issues. This number is based on the average of statistics in three categories: reproductive health, empowerment, and economic activity. These statistics can give a general idea of how a country fares on gender issues relative to all 146 countries in the study, and also against other countries from the same region.&lt;ref name="HumanDevelopment" /&gt;

The overall comparison between the HDI and the gender inequality index would suggest that Honduras is performing better and progressing faster on gender issues than on general welfare. These changes have come as a result of social and political shifts in opinion on the role of women in society. Since the 1980s the overall value of Honduras' HDI has averaged an increase of 1.6% annually, which is an impressive improvement that has brought them over a 30% positive increase to date.&lt;ref name="HumanDevelopment" /&gt;

===Reproductive health===
[[Reproductive health]] is usually gauged in terms of the [[maternal mortality]] rate, which is the number of mothers per 100,000 who die from pregnancy-related causes. In 2015, Honduras had a rate of 
129 deaths/100,000 live births.&lt;ref name="cia.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ho.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|author=|date=|website=www.cia.gov|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these deaths come as a result of unregulated and illegally performed abortions which leave the women at great risk for infection. Another indicator is the [[teenage pregnancy|adolescent fertility rate]], which is the number of live births per 1,000 adolescent mothers (ages 13–18). 

For every 1,000 births in Honduras, 93.3, or almost 10 percent, were to adolescent mothers. This high rate is a negative indicator not only for the women who are having children at such a young age, but also for the community as a whole. Women who have children as adolescents put their children in a situation where they are much more likely to be raised in [[poverty]], due to the fact that the secondary education dropout rate is significantly higher among adolescents who have children.

The GII also shows that as of 2011 only 65 percent of women aged 15–49 are using any form of contraception and only 67% of women have a skilled professional present for the birth of their child. This low level of contraception use has not equated to a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS. Only 0.2 percent of women and 0.3 percent of men are infected. Having fewer women than men infected with AIDS is usually a trend found in more developed countries. The bad news on that front is that, according to Sister Namibia, "the sale of young girls and women into prostitution slavery plays a major role in the transmission of AIDS among heterosexual couples."&lt;ref&gt;Glimpse the reality of Honduran women. (1992). Sister Namibia, 4(1), 15. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/194834862 {{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is leading to an increase of cases of AIDS.

The final contributing factor to reproductive health is the number of children women have. The [[total fertility rate]] in Honduras is 2.78 children born/woman (2015 est.).&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt;

===Reproductive and sexual rights===
Fifty percent of births to women under the age of twenty were unplanned and nearly the same number of young women between the ages of 18 and 24 reported becoming sexually active, poorer women at higher rates. Access to birth control is typically more available to married women between the ages of 18 and 24. In regards to women's understanding of safe sex practices in Honduras, the vast majority of adolescents understand how and where to obtain condoms and have knowledge of HIV/AIDS prevention, but only a third of the population have a full educational awareness of the virus itself. 

The highest formal awareness is among the wealthiest of teens, and the least amount of awareness is among the poorest. Abortion has been illegal in Honduras since it was banned in 1997. The Honduran Supreme Court banned the use of contraceptives for emergency purposes in 2012, making the unlawful administering or receiving of it punishable in the same way as abortion. 

Teenagers must have parental consent in order to be tested for HIV/AIDS. In 2010, the Honduran government signed the Ministerial Declaration of Preventing through Education, which set the goal of bettering the sexual and reproductive rights of adolescents by implementing more quality sex education programs in schools, among other related goals.

===Empowerment===
The UNDP's GII includes two measures as indicators of empowerment. These indicators are the percentage of parliament seats held by women compared to men, and the percentage of women with a least secondary education compared to men.

Perhaps the most telling statistic on empowerment, the question "who is the decision maker" was posed to families in Honduras and 91.3% of those people answered the man was the primary decision maker vs. 8.7% female.&lt;ref name="FemalePovertyHardship"&gt;Deere, Carmen Diana, Gina E. Alvarado, and Jennifer Twyman. Poverty, Hardship, and Gender Inequality in Asset Ownership in Latin America. Center for Gender in Global Context, Michigan State University, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  This response suggests that the root of the gender problem in Honduras is the idea of patriarchy being the only way to operate and that women should always be the followers and caregivers, but not the decision makers. This insight into the culture of Honduras may be the key to development. Countries cannot simply stop in their tracks and change. It is only through the merging of old and new in the most seamless way that true and lasting change can be achieved.

A common form of empowerment is through political channels. Women in Honduras find themselves almost entirely cut out of the political system. The constant fight for survival has kept most women out of organized labor parties where their grievances could potentially be heard. If people want their plight to be recognized, they typically need an organized movement to make the government listen. Honduran mothers who spend countless hours providing unpaid labor while also playing the role of the primary breadwinner, have no time to bring their case to the political stage.

==Economic activity==
Economic activity in the GII is based on only one statistic: the proportion of females compared to males in the labor force. As  of 2014, women made 34.6% of the labor force in Honduras.&lt;ref&gt;http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.TOTL.FE.ZS&lt;/ref&gt; Many women work in low-skilled jobs, often in bad conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waronwant.org/women-factory-workers-honduras|title=Women factory workers in Honduras|author=|date=23 June 2015|website=waronwant.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Honduran women have a much lower participation in the workforce than other Latin American women, due to Honduras being more conservative than other countries in the region.&lt;ref name="american.edu"&gt;https://www.american.edu/cas/economics/ejournal/upload/Global_Majority_e_Journal_4_1_Lomot.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The labour opportunities in rural areas are very limited for women, owing to a combination of lack of jobs and social views which dictate that women belong in the home.&lt;ref name="american.edu"/&gt;

In the 2008 Global Gender Gap Index, Honduras was ranked 21st out of 74 countries on their general index value.&lt;ref name="HumanDevelopment" /&gt; Pulled from the same data but for the economic participation and opportunity sub-index they were ranked 47th.&lt;ref name="HumanDevelopment" /&gt;  That is a change of 26 spots when talking about general-well being versus economic inclusion. This is yet another indicator that gender inequality is lower in economic indicators.

On issues of women's health, Honduras did better than other countries close to it on the index, but the economic opportunities and participation leave a lot of room for improvement economically.

There has been a recent wave of immigration consisting mostly of young women moving from rural to urban areas in order to find work. This has led to urban centers in Honduras being made up of over 53% women.&lt;ref name="HumanDevelopment" /&gt; According to Sister Namibia this has resulted in "rapid urban growth in recent years has spawned various social problems, including unemployment, lack of adequate housing and basic services, all of which affect women most severely."&lt;ref name="HumanDevelopment" /&gt;

===Labor force participation===
Men are twice as likely to be employed in Honduras as are  women, and there are very strong stereotypes of what men's and women's jobs should be. Much of this comes from the [[Gender roles in Mesoamerica|Mesoamerican ideas of gender]]. Gender role stereotypes are reinforced from a young age. Boys are given machetes and girls are given meteates (the instrument women use to grind corn into meal).

Rural women carry out very important roles in agricultural life, but are prohibited from stepping out of those boundaries. Women cook, clean, plant crops and even tend animals, but only men are allowed to plow the fields. These roles from ancient culture are still evident even today - women are seen as limited on what they can and can't accomplish. The idea of male and female jobs also carries over into the field of unpaid labor, as women perform a great deal more unpaid labor than men.

Although women have seen an increase in labor force participation in the past few decades, that is not necessarily an indication of equality in the labor force. This slow transition for women from unpaid to paid labor is a  step in the right direction, but there is still much to be done in the battle for equal pay, jobs, and treatment. Women, in addition to having to work twice as hard in order to get a traditionally male-held job, are then paid less than their male counterparts for doing exactly the same job. Women are seen as a second choice as breadwinner in the home. They are preferred to stay home, work as homemakers, and become dependent on their dominant husbands. This gender role is carried into the workplace, making women secondary priority as employees.

Although women are seen as a second choice for a breadwinner, it is becoming more and more common for women to be the main, and in many cases the sole breadwinner. Yoked with this burden of providing for a family while living in a country where one's labor is not valued can be extremely difficult. This has forced many women to be innovative and flexible when it comes to providing for their families.

Many resort to operating food carts or peddling cheap merchandise on street corners. While this is a way to feed a family, it is also detrimental to the cause for women and plays a part in widening the gender gap even further. Overall the average woman makes considerably less than her male counterpart, and is usually forced into industries with little to no benefits and almost no job security.

===Wealth distribution by gender===
[[File:HN007sRamon_horse%2Bownr.jpg|thumb|Woman with horse]]
The share of wealth that a certain group has can be a strong indicator of the amount of power that particular group holds in society. Women in Honduras have a very small share of the overall wealth, and the distribution of the type of wealth women possess reinforces their roles as homemakers and caretakers. This data shows the ratios of ownership of various goods:

Home ownership: 

Women: 38% 

Men: 59% Joint: 3%

Land ownership: 

Women:12.8%

Men:87.2%

Cattle: 

Women:13%

Men: 72%

Joint: 15%

Work animals: Women:10%

Men: 85% 

Joint- 5%&lt;ref name="FemalePovertyHardship" /&gt;

Women have a slight edge in ownership over chickens and pigs, but the place where women clearly have more ownership is in consumer durables. They tend to own more sewing machines, blenders, irons, stoves, toasters, and fridges, whereas men tend to own the computers, bikes, motorcycles, and cars.  The assets that are predominantly owned by the women are of relatively small value compared to the high-value items that are owned almost exclusively by the men. Additionally, the items owned predominantly by the women all revolve around household care.

The underlying message given here is that in general, women own the chickens and the pigs, because they can then prepare them into a meal. They also own the items necessary to sew, blend, iron, cook, bake, and prepare and serve food. They do not, however, have the assets necessary to gain physical mobility through the means of owning a car or bicycle, check email, or cultivate a field, while the men do. This distribution of ownership reinforces the stereotypical and traditional gender roles in society.

==Women's Access to Education==
[[File:HN999sRamon~newSchool8.jpg|thumb|250 px|School girls in Honduras.]]
Due to the traditionally [[patriarchal]] nature of Honduras, girls were often educationally disadvantaged. The reason for this being that if times got tough and only one child in a family was going to be educated, any female children would lose their chance at education before the boys. This is due to the fact that it is much harder for a female to find work regardless of educational achievement. The sought-after, well-paying jobs are commonly associated with [[masculinity]] in Honduras, including heavy manual labor, technical work, and anything that requires extensive training or an advanced degree.&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt;

The main reason that girls are pulled out of school in the first place is usually to help in the family, leading to differences in educational attainment. The situation is changing, as the [[school life expectancy]] is today estimated to be higher for girls (12 years) than boys (11 years) -as of 2013.&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt; Honduras does have a fairly high literacy rate, which is similar for both sexes: 88.4% for males and 88.6% for females.&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt;

== Gender/sexuality-based violence ==
{{See|Femicides in Honduras}}

Violence against women occurs in public and in private, and demonstrates the inequality of power between women and men.  This has led to women being dominated and discriminated against by men and this violence forces women "into a subordinate position compared with men". 

The most common form of gender-based violence is sexual in nature.  Understandably, sexual violence involves exploitation and abuse and is related "to any act, attempt, or threat that results in physical and emotional harm". Sexual violence can occur in the family, through rape or marital rape, coercion, by attempt, in the form of harassment and as a weapon of war or torture. There are four more types of gender/sexuality-based violence:

* Physical violence 
* Emotional and psychological violence
* Harmful traditional practices violence:  This consists of female genital mutilation (FGM), early marriage, forced marriage, honor killing and maiming (murdering a woman as a punishment for dishonoring or bringing shame to the family), infanticide, and denial of education.
* Socio-economic violence:  This involves discrimination or denial of opportunities, social exclusion based on sexual orientation, and obstructive legislative practice (inhibiting women from using their social or economic rights).

In Honduras, the rate of [[femicide]], is rated in sixth place according to a study done in 2011,&lt;ref name="cgrs.uchastings.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cgrs.uchastings.edu/our-work/central-america-femicides-and-gender-based-violence|title=Central America: Femicides and Gender-Based Violence - UC Hastings Center for Gender and Refugee Studies|author=|date=|website=cgrs.uchastings.edu|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and make up 9.6% of the total number of homicides in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.unodc.org/documents/gsh/pdfs/2014_GLOBAL_HOMICIDE_BOOK_web.pdf|title = Global Study on Homicide|date = 2013|accessdate = |website = www.unodc.org|publisher = United National Office of Drugs and Crime (Vienna)|last = Gibbons|first = Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In current years the rates of violence against women have increased.  In this country, femicide is extremely brutal.  Sometimes bodies are found burned or with the feet and hands tied.  During the autopsies, it is often discovered that rape has occurred before the victim's death.  In Honduras, any form of rape is considered a public crime and a report will be made even if charges are not pressed by the victim.

In Honduras and in many countries surrounding it, justice against femicide does not get served. Although there are [[women’s rights]] activists trying to take a stand, "fewer than 3% of reported femicide cases are resolved by the courts".&lt;ref name="cgrs.uchastings.edu"/&gt; This only gives the perpetrators more power and confidence to commit these crimes knowing that they will not be convicted, which makes femicide the norm in Honduras.

===Domestic Violence===
An estimated 27 percent of Honduran women report that they have endured some form of physical violence.
&lt;ref name="derechosdelamujer.org"&gt;http://www.derechosdelamujer.org/tl_files/documentos/derechos_humanos/Violence-Women-Honduras-RapporteurONU-June2014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This may include physical injuries, domestic violence, rape, and homicide. The Public Prosecutor's office recognizes twenty-five forms of violence inflicted upon Honduran women.  The violence against women in Honduras is due to multiple reasons which include [[gender norms]], poverty, [[militarization]], drug trafficking, and inequality.
&lt;ref name="derechosdelamujer.org"/&gt;
As a result, from the years 2005 through 2013, the numbers of violent death arose by two hundred and sixty-three percent. This made the rate of violent deaths of Honduran women increase from 2.7 in 2005 to 14.6 in 2013. 
&lt;ref name="derechosdelamujer.org"/&gt; This increase in violent deaths is greater than the total amount of homicide rates in countries that are currently engaged in a war zone or armed conflict.

The [[Domestic Violence]] Act took effect after a long struggle by women's rights activists to get it passed. The act was focused on dealing with violence in the home, an issue which was largely overlooked by local authorities. The act needed not only to get police to crack down, but the judicial system and social systems also needed to be adjusted to deal with the repercussions. In 1998, the bill was passed and the authorities were charged with the difficult task of dealing with such a widespread and controversial issue. In order to deal with new court cases, special domestic violence judges were assigned to handle the new caseload.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Herrmannsdorfer, Claudia. "Case Study: The Inter-Institutional Commission to Follow-up Implementation of the Domestic Violence Act in Honduras." A PARLIAMENTARY RESPONSE TO VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN (2009): 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill was inspired by the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]], as well as other international organizations in support of women's rights, and had a main goal of reducing violence towards women in Honduras. There was also a network of therapists, charged with providing family counselling to those that were affected by the bill. Men who were sanctioned by the bill were also monitored to reduce the chances of future violence. The bill started off only being enforced around the capital and other major cities, but quickly spread throughout all of Honduras. This was a major step in reducing the frequency and acceptability of gender violence in Honduras.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==History of women's rights== 
Women's organizations have been in existence since the 1920s, when the Women's Cultural Society (Sociedad Cultural Feminina Hondureña) was formed and began to fight for women's rights. One leader, Visitación Padilla, actively opposed U.S. intervention in Honduras in 1924. Women also played important roles in the development of the labor movement,which became particularly active in the 1950s. According to Gladys Lanza, a trade union activist, women were extremely active in the 1954 national banana workers strike.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

They controlled entrances to towns and markets, closed the bars so men could not get drunk, and ran collective kitchens. Despite the extent of this logistical work, there was not a single woman on the strike committee. In the 1950s women also became active in the fight for women's suffrage, which was obtained in 1955.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The current [[Constitution of Honduras]] enshrines gender equality: art 60 reads: "Any discrimination on grounds of sex, race, class and any other injuries to human dignity are declared punishable". (''Se declara punible toda discriminación por motivo de sexo, raza, clase y cualquier otra lesiva a la dignidad humana'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Honduras/vigente.html#|title=Honduras: Constitutions|author=|date=|website=pdba.georgetown.edu|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women in politics ==
Despite the fact that women today have equal political rights, they remain under-represented in politics. Nevertheless, the numbers have increased in recent years, and as of 2013, women made up 25.80% of the Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 6, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328105108/http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm |archivedate=March 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impacts of Migration on Women ==
In [[Honduras]], there are many transnational families: members of the family (typically males) migrate to other countries, usually seeking economic opportunities.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MCKENZIE|first=SEAN|last2=MENJÍVAR|first2=CECILIA|date=2010-12-08|title=The meanings of migration, remittances and gifts: views of Honduran women who stay|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1471-0374.2011.00307.x|journal=Global Networks|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|pages=63–81|doi=10.1111/j.1471-0374.2011.00307.x|issn=1470-2266}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decent number of Hondurans had been living in the United States since the 1950's, but this number increased significantly starting in the 1990's and 2000's. In 2010, there were about 523,000 Hondurans residing in the United States, the majority of which were individuals rather than whole families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/honduras-perils-remittance-dependence-and-clandestine-migration|title=Honduras: The Perils of Remittance Dependence and Clandestine Migration|last=Reichman|first=Daniel|date=2013-04-11|work=migrationpolicy.org|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this mass migration, the Honduran population relies heavily on [[Remittance|remittances]]. Remittances have been a greater source of domestic income than any other sector of the economy of Honduras since 2000: twenty percent of Honduran households were receiving remittances.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Statistics reveal that men are much more likely to migrate than women in Honduras. Eighty percent of Hondurans receiving remittances are women, which means that more women remain behind than men. The majority of these women are between the ages of 20 and 40. Approximately 40 percent of the remittances come from children, 30 percent from siblings, and 20 percent from spouses.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lai.fu-berlin.de/disziplinen/oekonomie/mitarbeiter_innen/Sarah_Hirsch/R21_Migration_and_remittances_Honduras_0310_01-1.pdf|title=Migration and remittances - the case of Honduras|last=Hirsch|first=Sarah|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This large-scale migration driven by the need to improve economic situations particularly impacts the women left behind in Honduras.

There are economic, social, and emotional impacts on the women left behind in Honduras as their male family members, such as brothers, husbands, fathers, and sons, migrate to countries such as the United States in order to earn money for their families. These migrations especially affect women who become the head of the household after their family member leaves. Personal interviews and anecdotal evidence reveal that women suffer from a significant emotional harm as their loved one embarks on an often dangerous journey. Typically, the men who migrate must stay away and work for several years in order to make enough money to adequately provide for the survival of their family members remaining in Honduras. This long term separation and the worry it gives rise to can be incredibly taxing. Interviews with Honduran women revealed that they typically feel much less safe once their male family members. One Honduran woman had a robbery since the criminals knew her husband had migrated and thus targeted her house. Furthermore, this emotional burden and anxiety manifests itself into physical illnesses.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Not only do the women left behind in Honduras have to deal with emotional (and sometimes physical) strain, but they have more tasks to complete once their male family members migrate. These migrations often significantly increase the amount of work and responsibilities that Honduran women must accomplish and bear. Some of this additional work results from jobs that these women already had but shared with their husbands and brothers. For example, women become the sole caregivers of their children - the great physical distance separating their husbands from their children precludes these men from sharing this responsibility. Additional work comes in the form of the jobs their male family members used to take care of before they migrated. Some Honduran women must not only care for the children and their home, but also tackle additional tasks such as farming and other agricultural jobs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There are several other ways in which already strongly prevalent gender inequalities in Honduras are exacerbated by the migration of males to countries such as the United States. Often, these men must employ the help of "coyotes" in order to safely cross the border. These "coyotes" often as for an incredibly large fee: thus, the women left at home become the managers of their husband or other male relative's debt. This inheritance of the debt not only restrains and pressures women financially, but it also increases their emotional stress as it extends the amount of time the men must stay away from home in order to make enough money to provide for their families and pay off this debt.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Additionally, the increase of work for women does not also lead to an increase of political or social power and influence. Thus, women are given an extra burden without being given extra resources, benefits, or power to handle this increased workload. Several Honduran women revealed in interviews that they did not feel more empowered by taking on these additional responsibilities. Not only are their jobs physically, emotionally, mentally, and financially demanding, but these extra jobs were not their choice. Several Honduran women said that if these burdens had been freely chosen rather than thrust on them, they might feel more empowered.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Notably, more research needs to be done on the topic of the political impacts on women after the men migrate from Honduras. The effects are likely to differ between rural and urban areas.

=== More Recent Trends: Women Migrating ===
As the previous part of this section highlights, many Hondurans migrated in the late 20th and very early 21st century for economic reasons, especially after the devastation of [[Hurricane Mitch]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;in late 1998.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, more recent studies show that more women and children are migrating out of Latin American countries than were previously. This is especially the case for [[Guatemala]], [[El Salvador]], and Honduras.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/sexual-gender-violence-driving-central-american-youths-flee-their-countries-n754886|title=Sexual, gender violence is driving Central American youths to flee their countries|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new trend in migration out of Honduras is caused by an increase in sexual and gender violence, especially from gangs: "gang members are using rape, kidnapping, torture, sexual violence, and other crimes, predominantly against women and girls" in Honduras.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In fact, Honduras had the seventh highest rate of gender-motivated murders of women in the world in 2013.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/gender-based-violence-against-women-both-cause-migration-and-risk-along-journey|title=Gender-Based Violence against Women: Both Cause for Migration and Risk along the Journey|last=Parish|first=Anja|date=2017-09-06|work=migrationpolicy.org|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[LGBT|LGBTQ+]] women and children are specifically being targeted by these gangs, as well. Gangs use violence in part as a means to establish control over their territory. This increased violence against women and children have led to their migration to the United States for asylum.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

This is a complex issue, as scholars have pointed to many contributing factors. One notable cause of the increased violence and subsequent migration of women and children is the long history of impunity of gang members in Honduras. The government and justice systems are unable to completely protect the victims of this violence. Fewer than three percent of gender-motivated murders remain unsolved by the courts in the countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Both corruption and intimidation play a large role, and many people don't report the crimes against them out of fear. When people in Honduras do report these crimes, them and their families are often subjected to further gang violence, which the police and government are largely powerless to prevent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Not only do women experience violence while in Honduras, but they also suffer from attacks while migrating to the United States and other nations. This indicates that their situation in Honduras is so unlivable that they are willing to risk violence on their journey.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Women are sexually and physically abused by other migrants, human smugglers, and even government officials or police. Women take contraception to prevent unwanted pregnancy in case of rape while they migrate, demonstrating the dangers they face and their desperation driving them to escape the violence in their home country.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10607">'''Gums and Stabilisers for the Food Industry''' is a biennial conference ([https://web.archive.org/web/20110816133934/http://foodhydrocolloidstrust.org.uk/Register.aspx?ReturnUrl=BrowseProducts.aspx%2F see the official website]) held in [[Wrexham]], [[North Wales]], since 1981, on the application of [[hydrocolloids]] ([[polysaccharides]] and [[proteins]]) in the [[food industry]]. Presentations at the conference cover recent advances in the structure, function and applications of [[gums]] and stabilisers, how these materials are used in industrial processes, and also educational material on the subject. The proceedings of each conference have been published (see below), with the most recent (9th through 16th conferences) published by the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]]. The conference series is organized by the [[Food Hydrocolloids Trust]].

==History of the conference==

The intention of the conference series is to provide a forum for the free exchange of ideas between [[academia]] and [[industry]] and to promote the use and understanding of [[hydrocolloids]] in [[foods]]. Because hydrocolloids are sourced and used in all of the continents except [[Antarctica]], and many types (such as [[resins]], [[seed gum]]s, and certain [[alginates]]) are obtained from specific countries or [[climate zone]]s, the conference attracts an international attendance from [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[North America]], [[Australia]], [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]].

The first conference series was held at [[Glyndŵr University]] in [[Wrexham]] in 1981, chaired by Professor Glyn O Phillips (also of Glyndŵr University), and all subsequent conferences have taken place at the same location and with the same chairman. Th eonly exception to this was the 2011 conference, held in [[Wageningen]] in the [[Netherlands]]. Until 2008, Glyndŵr University was known as the North-East Wales Institute of Higher Education (NEWI).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8969">[[File:TribalPhilippinesTraditionalRange.png|thumb|250px|A map of the highland ethnolinguistic nations of the Philippines by [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]].]]

The '''Philippines''' consist of a large number of upland and lowland ethnolinguistic groups living in the country. The highland ethnic nations have co-existed with the lowland Austronesian ethnic groups for thousands of years in the Philippine archipelago. The primary difference is that they were not absorbed by centuries of [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[United States]] colonization of the Philippines, and in the process have retained their customs and traditions. This is mainly due to the rugged inaccessibility of the [[List of mountains in the Philippines|mountains]], which discouraged Spanish and American colonizers from coming into contact with the highlanders. The indigenous peoples of northern Philippines are collectively called as ''Igorot'', while the non-Muslim indigenous groups of mainland Mindanao are collectively called as ''Lumad''. Numerous indigenous groups also live outside these two indigenous corridors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncipro67.com.ph/indigenous-peoples-of-the-philippines/ National Commission on Indigenous Peoples] Accessed November 15, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Komisyon ng Wikang Filipino]], there are 135 recognized local languages in the Philippines, one of which (Filipino) is known to all groups in the Philippines, and each of the remaining 134 is inherent to a single ethnic group.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} There are 134 ethnic groups in the Philippines, the majority of which are indigenous, though much of the overall Philippine population is constituted by only 8-10 lowland ethnic groups. {{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Overview==

===Demographics===
In the 1990s, there were more than 100 highland tribal groups constituting approximately 3% of the population. The upland tribal groups were a blend in ethnic origin, like those in lowland areas of the country, although the upland tribal groups do not interact nor intermingle with the latter.

Because they displayed a variety of social organization, cultural expression and artistic skills. They showed a high degree of creativity, usually employed to embellish utilitarian objects, such as bowls, baskets, clothing, weapons and spoons. The tribal groups of the Philippines are known for their carved wooden figures, baskets, weaving, pottery and weapons.

==Ethnic groups==

===Northern Philippines===
[[File:Traditional Kalinga dancers.JPG|thumb|left|175px|The traditional Kalinga dancers.]]
These groups ranged from various [[Igorot]] tribes, a group that includes the Bontoc, [[Ibaloi people|Ibaloi]], Ifugao, Isneg, Kalinga, [[Kankanaey people|Kankanaey]] and [[Tinguian]], who built the [[Rice Terraces]]. They also covered a wide spectrum in terms of their integration and acculturation with lowland Christian and Muslim Filipinos. Native groups such as the [[Lumad#Bukidnon|Bukidnon]] in [[Mindanao]], had intermarried with lowlanders for almost a century. Other groups such as the [[Igorot people#Kalinga|Kalinga]] in Luzon have remained isolated from lowland influence.

There were several upland groups living in the Cordillera Central of Luzon in 1990. At one time it was employed by lowland Filipinos in a pejorative sense, but in recent years it came to be used with pride by native groups in the mountain region as a positive expression of their ethnic identity. The Ifugao of [[Ifugao province]], the Bontoc, Kalinga, [[Tinguian]], the [[Kankanaey people|Kankanaey]] and [[Ibaloi people|Ibaloi]] were all farmers who constructed the rice terraces for many centuries.

Other mountain peoples of Luzon are the [[Isnag people|Isnag]] of the province of Apayao, the [[Gaddang people|Gaddang]] of the border between Kalinga and [[Isabela province]]s and the [[Ilongot]] of [[Nueva Vizcaya province]] and [[Caraballo Mountains]] all developed hunting and gathering, farming cultivation and [[headhunting]]. Other groups such as the [[Negrito]]s formerly dominated the highlands throughout the islands for thousands of years, but have been reduced to a small population, living in widely scattered locations, primarily along the eastern ranges of the mountains.

===Southern Philippines===
[[File:"Moro Girl." (Taken during the 1904 World's Fair).jpg|thumb|right|A [[Moro people|Moro]] woman (c. 1904).]]
In the southern Philippines, upland and lowland tribal groups were concentrated on Mindanao and western [[Visayas]], although there are several upland groups such as the [[Mangyan]] living in [[Mindoro]]. Among the most important groups found on Mindanao are collectively called the [[Lumad]], and includes the [[Manobo]] which is a bigger ethnographic group such as the [[Ata-Manobo]] and the [[Matigsalug]] found in Davao City, Davao del Norte and Bukidnon Province; the [[Langilan-Manobo]] in Davao del Norte; the [[Agusan-Manobo]] in Agusan del Sur and southern parts of Agusan del Norte; the [[Pulanguiyon-Manobo]] of Bukidnon Province; the [[Ubo-Manobo]] in southwestern parts of Davao City, and northern parts of North Cotabato Province that is also to include the [[Arumanen-Manobo]] of Carmen (N. Cotabato); the [[Dulangan-Manobo]] in the Province of Sultan Kudarat; the [[Talaandig]], [[Higaonon]] and [[Bukidnon]] of [[Bukidnon province]], [[Bagobo]], [[Mandaya]], [[Mansaka]], [[Tagakaulo]] in Davao region who inhabited the mountains bordering the [[Davao Gulf]]; the '''Kalagan''' lives particularly in lowland areas and seashores of Davao del Norte, Compostella Valley, Davao Oriental and some seashores in Davao Del Sur, the [[Subanon people|Subanon]] of upland areas in [[Zamboanga (province)|Zamboanga]]; the [[Mamanua]] in the Agusan-Surigao border region; the [[B'laan]], [[Teduray]] and [[Tboli people|Tboli]] in the region of the [[Cotabato province]], and the [[Samal people|Samal]].  Samal is synonymous with Luwa'an. Yakan is the indigenous tribe in the hinterlands of Basilan Province.  In the lowland lives the Sama Banguingui tribe while in coastal areas there leave the nomadic Luwa'an. Sulu lowland areas are also home of the Sama Banguingui. The Sama or the Sinama and the Jama Mapun are the indigenous tribes in the province of Tawi-Tawi.

==Reservations==
[[File:Kampilan and two Krises.JPG|thumb|250pz|''[[Kampilan]]'' are weapons used by [[Rajah]]s and [[Datu]]s.]]

The Philippine government succeeded in establishing a number of protected [[Reservation (Philippine tribal groups)|reservation]]s for tribal groups. Highland peoples were expected to speak their native language, dress in their traditional tribal clothing, live in houses constructed of natural materials using traditional architectural designs and celebrate their traditional ceremonies of propitiation of spirits believed to be inhabiting their environment. They are also encouraged to re-establish their traditional authority structure in which, as in indigenous society were governed by chieftains known as ''[[Rajah]]'' and ''[[Datu]]''.

Contact between primitive and modern ethnic groups usually resulted in weakening or destroying tribal culture without assimilating the indigenous groups into modern society. It seemed doubtful that the shift of the Philippine government policy from [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] to [[cultural pluralism]] could reverse the process. Several Filipino tribes tends to lead to the abandonment of traditional culture because land security makes it easier for tribal members to adopt the economic process of the larger society and facilitates marriage with outsiders.

In the past, the Philippine government bureaus could not preserve tribes as social museum exhibits, but with the aid of various nationwide organizations, they hoped to help the people adapt to modern society without completely losing their ethnic identity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16799">Isotopic analysis is one of the most difficult scientific processes in the history of man. There are few ways to conduct this analysis, as a result. However, nuclear magnetic resonance is one of those ways.

This method allows to quantify with great precision the differences of isotopic contents on each site of a [[molecule]] and thus to measure the specific [[natural isotope fractionation]] for each site of this molecule. The SNIF-NMR analysis is mainly used to check the authenticity of [[wines]], [[spirits]], [[fruit juice]], [[honey]], [[sugar]] and [[vinegar]] and to control the naturality of some aromatic molecules ([[vanillin]], [[benzaldehyde]], [[raspberry ketone]], [[anethole]] ...). The SNIF-NMR method 
has been adopted by the [[Organisation Internationale de la Vigne et du vin (OIV)]] and the [[European Union]] as an official method for wine analysis. It is also an official method adopted by the [[Association Of Analytical Chemists (AOAC)]] for analysis of fruit juices, [[maple syrup]], vanillin, and by the [[Comité Européen de Normalisation (CEN)]] for vinegar.

The method has been developed, in response to a government tender, by Professor Gerard Martin and his team at the University of Nantes, in order to detect the (over) sugaring of wine and enrichment of [[grape musts]].

== Background ==

* 1981: Invention of the SNIF-NMR method by Professor Gerard Martin, Maryvonne Martin and their team at the University of Nantes / CNRS &lt;ref name="Eurofins Scientific"&gt;Eurofins Scientific – Worldwide laboratory testing services, “Eurofins Scientific - 1987 - 1997 - The Start-up Phase”, (consulted the 2nd of January 2014). http://www.eurofins.com/en/about-us/our-history/start-up-phase.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1987: Creation of [[Eurofins]] Nantes Laboratories - specializing in wine analysis, and purchase of operating the CNRS patent rights&lt;ref name="Eurofins Scientific"/&gt; (this patent is now public and the name “SNIF-NMR” is now a registered [[trademark]]&lt;ref name="INPI"&gt;INPI : Institut National de la Propriété Industrielle, "Bases de Données Marques", (consulted the 6th of January 2014). http://bases-marques.inpi.fr/&lt;/ref&gt;
The OIV adopts it as an official method
* 1987-1990: Eurofins Laboratories apply the SNIF-NMR method to the analysis of fruit juices and certain natural [[flavors]]
* 1990: The SNIF-NMR method is recognized by the European Union as an official method for the analysis of wines&lt;ref name="wine"&gt;Commission Regulation of the European communities, 1990. (EEC) n° 000/90: “determining community methods for the analysis of wine”. Brussels, Official Journal of the European communities, p.64-73&lt;/ref&gt;

→ Implementation of the SNIF-NMR method for official laboratories in Europe
* 1990-1992: the method is tested on aromatic molecules
* 1996: The SNIF- NMR method is recognized in the United States by the AOAC for fruit juices&lt;ref name="fruit juice"&gt;AOAC official Method 995.17, Beet Sugar in Fruit Juices, SNIF-NMR, AOAC International 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principle ==

=== Isotopic distribution ===

[[File:Natural existence of hydrogen, carbon and oxygen.jpg|thumb|Figure 2]]
[[File:Figure 3 - Isotopic Fractionation Sources.JPG|thumb|Figure 3 - Isotopic Fractionation Sources]]
[[File:Figure 4 - Mr Isotope.jpg|thumb|Figure 4 - Mr Isotope]]

The atoms [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[carbon]] co-exist naturally in specific proportions with their [[stable isotopes]], 2H (or D), 18O and 13C respectively, in different proportions as shown in the figure 2 below.

The amount and distribution of the different isotopes in a molecule is influenced by: 
* Environmental (climatic and geographical) conditions - for natural products 
* Chemical or biochemical processes such as the [[photosynthetic metabolism]] in plants

This phenomenon is known as [[Natural Isotopic Fractionation]] (see Figure 3). The resulting isotopic fingerprint can provide information on the origin - botanical, synthetic, geographical - of the molecule or product.

=== General principle ===

The Principle of the SNIF-NMR is built on: “The Natural Isotopic Fractionation”. Routinely for food authenticity, two nuclei are used:
* The Hydrogen nuclei: &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H-SNIF-NMR method was the initial application of SNIF-NMR, it measures the ratio of [[deuterium]]/hydrogen on each site of a sample molecule
* The Carbon nuclei: &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-SNIF-NMR method has opened new possibilities of analysis by SNIF-NMR (new molecules and new applications). This method will use the ratios of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C over &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C on each site of a molecule

=== Steps of the method ===
[[File:Figure 5 -Steps of SNIF-NMR of ethanol - Official method.jpg|thumb|Figure 5 -Steps of SNIF-NMR of ethanol - Official method]]
The SNIF-NMR is applied on pure (or purified) molecules. Therefore, some preparation steps may be required in the lab before analysis.
For example, for the SNIF-NMR of ethanol, according to official methods:
* [[Fermentation]] (for fruit juice)
* Quantitative extraction of [[ethanol]] by [[distillation]] 
* Standardized preparation of [[NMR]] samples
* NMR acquisition
* Interpretation of results and report on the authenticity

At each step of the SNIF-NMR analysis, efforts should be made to avoid parasite isotopic fractionation. Control measures such as determining the alcoholic strength of the intermediate products of the analysis (fermented juice or distillate) are performed on each sample.

=== Advantages of the method ===
[[File:Figure 6 - Principle of the IRMS.jpg|thumb|Figure 6 - Principle of the IRMS]]
The isotopic ratios of a molecule can also be determined by isotope ratio mass spectrometry [[(IRMS)]], sample quantity for IRMS is much lower than for NMR, and there is the possibility of coupling the mass spectrometer to a chromatographic system to enable on-line purification or analyses of several components of a complex mixture. However the sample is burnt after a physical transformation such as [[combustion]] or [[pyrolysis]]. Therefore, it gives a mean value of the concentration of the isotope studied between all sites of the molecule.  IRMS is the official AOAC technique used for the average ratio &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C (or δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C) of [[sugars]] or ethanol, and the official CEN and OIV method for the 18O/16O in [[water]].

The SNIF-NMR method (Site-Specific Natural Isotope Fractionation studied by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) is able to determine, to a high level of accuracy, the isotopic ratios for each of the sites of the molecule, which enables a better discrimination. For example, for ethanol (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH), the three ratios ((D/H)CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, (D/H)CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and (D/H)&lt;sub&gt;OH&lt;/sub&gt;) can be obtained.

== Examples of applications of &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H-SNIF-NMR ==
[[File:Figure 7 - Official Isotope method recognition for food application – 2013.jpg|thumb|Figure 7 - Official Isotope method recognition for food application – 2013]]

=== Application for fruit juice and maple syrup ===

AOAC Official Method for detecting the addition of sugar in a fruit juice&lt;ref name="fruit juice"/&gt; or in maple syrup. It is the only reliable method to detect addition of C3 sugar (ex: [[beet sugar]]).

=== NMR Spectrum (example of the &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H-SNIF-NMR) ===
[[File:Figure 8 - 2H-NMR spectrum of ethanol.jpg|thumb|Figure 8 - 2H-NMR spectrum of ethanol]]
Ethanol molecules obtained after complete fermentation of the sugar coexists with 3 naturally monodeuterated isotopomers (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-OH, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CHDOH and-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OD). Their presence can then be quantified with relative precision.&lt;ref name="plant analysis"&gt;G. Martin, M.L. Martin. Modern Methods of Plant Analysis: “The Site-Specific Natural Isotope Fractionation-NMR Method Applied to the Study of Wines”, edition: HF Linskens and JF Jackson Springer Verlag, Berlin, 1988, p. 258-275&lt;/ref&gt;

On the following &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR spectrum (Figure 3), a peak corresponds to one of the three observed isotopomers of ethanol. 
In the AOAC official method, the ratios of (D/H)CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and (D/H)CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are calculated by comparison with an Internal standard, [[tetramethylurea]] (TMU), with a certified (D/H) value.

=== Interpretation of SNIF-NMR isotopic values ===
[[File:Figure 9 - Adulteration triangle - repartition of isotopic ratios on ethanol molecules.jpg|thumb|Figure 9 - Adulteration triangle: repartition of isotopic ratios on ethanol molecules]]
The following Figure 9 summarizes the principle of interpretation of:

* Results measured by IRMS (isotopic deviation of δ &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C), which enables discrimination of plants according to their CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthetic metabolism (C4 like can or maize versus C3 like beet, orange or grape)
* With results measured by SNIF-NMR ((D / H)I ) that can differentiate the botanical origin of sugars within the same metabolic group (beet versus orange or grape)

Values obtained on a test sample are then compared with the values of authentic samples (Database).

=== Application for authenticity of wines ===
[[File:Figure 10 - Applications of SNIF-NMR and IRMS to wine authenticity.JPG|thumb|Figure 10 - Applications of SNIF-NMR and IRMS to wine authenticity]]
SNIF-NMR is the official method of the OIV to determine the authentication of wine origin. It is the only method to detect C3 sugar addition (like beet sugar).

The isotopic parameters of both water and ethanol are related to the [[humidity]] and [[temperature]] of the growing region of the [[plant]]. Therefore, considerations of meteorological data of the region and of the year help to make a diagnosis. In the case of wine and fruits, the isotopic parameters of ethanol have been shown to respond even to subtle environmental variations and they efficiently characterize the region of production,.&lt;ref name="plant analysis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="food chem"&gt;Martin GJ, Guillou C, Martin ML, Cabanis MT, Tep Y, Aerny J. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1988;36:316–22&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1991, an isotopic data bank is built in the [[Joint Research Centre of the European Community]] (EC-JRC) concerning wines of all European members. The database contains several thousand entries for European wines &lt;ref name="official journal"&gt;Official Journal of the European Communities. Off. J. Eur. Commun. 1991;L214:39–43&lt;/ref&gt; and is maintained and updated every year. This database is accessible for all official public laboratories. Private companies involved in food and beverage controls have also collected authentic samples and built up specific data banks.&lt;ref name="OIV"&gt;Guillou C, Jamin E, Martin GJ, Reniero F, Wittkowski R, Wood R. Bulletin OIV. 2001;74:26–36&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, by comparing the specific natural isotope fractionation corresponding to each site of a molecule of ethanol of wine with that of a molecule known and referenced in a database.  The geographical origin, botany and method of production of the ethanol molecule and thus the authenticity of wine can be checked.&lt;ref name="natural factors"&gt;G. Martin, C. Guillou, Y.L. Martin, Natural Factors of Isotope Fractionation and the characterization of Wines”, Journal of agricultural and food chemistry, n°36, 1988, p. 316-322&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Application for vinegar and acetic acid ===
[[File:Figure 11 - Application for vinegar.jpg|thumb|Figure 11 - Application for vinegar]]
The origins of vinegars obtained by bacterial or chemical oxidation of ethanol resulting from the fermentation of various sugars can be identified by the &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H-SNIF-NMR. It allows to control the quality of vinegar and to determine if it comes from sugar cane, wine, malt, cider, and alcohol or from a chemical synthesis.&lt;ref name="acetic acid"&gt;Site specific isotope fractionation of Hydrogen in the oxidation of ethanol into acetic acid. Application to vinegars. (C. Vallet, M. Arendt, G. Martin), Biotechnology Techniques, vol. 2 N° 2, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Application for vanillin ===

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H-SNIF-NMR is the official AOAC method for determining the natural vanillin.

The abundance of five monodeuterated isotopomers for vanillin can be measured by &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H-SNIF-NMR. The vanillin molecule is represented in figure 11, all observable sites for which the site specific deuterium concentrations can be measured are referenced with a number.

As for the wine or the fruit, the interpretation of results in terms of origin is done by comparison of the isotopic parameters of the sample analyzed with those from a group of referenced molecules of known origin. 
It appears that all the origins of vanillin are well discriminated using &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR data. Particularly, vanillin ex-bean can well be distinguished from the other sources, as we can see in figure 12 below.

Additionally, this method is the only one to discriminate between natural and biosynthetic sources of vanillin.&lt;ref name="vanillin"&gt;AOAC Official Method 2006.05, Site-Specific Deuterium/Hydrogen (D/H) Ratios in Vanillin, AOAC International 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Application for other aromas ===

The naturality of different aroma can also be checked using SNIF-NMR: for example for anethole, abundance of only six monodeuterated isotopomers can be measured by &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H-SNIF-NMR that allows differentiating the botanical origins fennel, star anise or pine.&lt;ref name="pine"&gt;La Résonnance Magnétique Nucléaire du Deutérium en Abondance Naturelle, une nouvelle méthode d’identification de l’origine de produits alimentaires appliquée à la reconnaissance des Anétholes et des Estragoles. (G. Martin, M. Martin, F. Mabon, J. Bricout), Sciences des Aliments, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

''Other applications:''
The SNIF-NMR applied to benzaldehyde can detect adulterated [[bitter almond]] and [[cinnamon]] oils. It is demonstrated that the site specific deuterium contents of [[benzaldehyde]] allow the determination of the origin of the molecule: synthetic (ex-[[toluene]] and ex-[[benzal chloride]]), natural (ex-kernels from [[apricots]], [[peaches]], [[cherries]] and ex-bitter almond) and semisynthetic (ex-[[cinnamaldehyde]] extracted from cinnamon).&lt;ref name="cinnamon"&gt;G. Remaud, A. Debon, Y. Martin, G. Martin. Authentication of Bitter Almond Oil and Cinnamon Oil: Application of the SNIF-NMR Method to Benzaldehyde, Journal of agricultural and food chemistry, n° 45, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;
Other applications have also been published: raspberry ketone),&lt;ref name="ketone"&gt;Journal of High Resolution Chromatography, vol.18, May 1995,279-285&lt;/ref&gt; heliotropine,…

== &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-SNIF-NMR, a recent routine method ==
[[File:Figure 14 - With this method C3, C4 and CAM plant metabolism are well separated.jpg|thumb|Figure 12 - With this method C3, C4 and CAM plant metabolism are well separated]]
As described in the work of E. Tenailleau and S. Akoka, an optimization of the technique parameters have enabled to reach a better accuracy for the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR measurements).&lt;ref name="routine"&gt;E. Tenailleau, S. Akoka . Adiabatic 1H decoupling scheme for very accurate intensity measurements in 13C NMR, Journal of Magnetic Resonance, n°185, 2007, p50-58&lt;/ref&gt;

The &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-SNIF-NMR method is called method “new frontier” because it is the first analytical method that can differentiate sugars coming from C4-metabolism plants (cane, maize, etc.) and some [[crassulacean]] acid metabolism plants (CAM-metabolism) like [[pineapple]] or [[agave]].&lt;ref name="tequila"&gt;F. Thomas, C. Randet, A. Gilbert, V. Silvestre, E. Jamin and al.  Improved Characterization of the Botanical Origin of Sugar by Carbon-13 SNIF-NMR Applied to Ethanol, Journal of agricultural and food chemistry, n° 58, 2010, p11580-11585&lt;/ref&gt;

This method can also be applied to [[tequila]] products, where it can differentiate authentic 100% agave tequila,  [[misto tequila]] (made from at least 51% agave), and products made from a larger proportion of [[sugarcane|cane]] or [[maize]] sugar and therefore not complying with the legal definition of tequila.&lt;ref name="tequila" /&gt;

This method will certainly have further applications in future, in the field of food and beverage analysis authenticity.

'''Joseph Paul Jernigan''' (January 31, 1954 – August 5, 1993) was a [[Texas]] murderer who was [[execution|executed]] by [[lethal injection]] at 12:31&amp;nbsp;a.m.

In 1981, Jernigan was found guilty of "cold-blooded murder" and [[death penalty|sentenced to death]] for killing Edward Hale, a 75-year-old homeowner who discovered Jernigan and an accomplice as they were burglarizing his home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnston|first1=Jessica|title=The American Body in Context: An Anthology|date=2001|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|pages=241–255|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIWcRAAtxvcC&amp;pg=PA241&amp;lpg=PA241&amp;dq=Joseph+Paul+Jernigan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0lF9x4SReB&amp;sig=nAlIutlPymxVv8689vzWetxzzMA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwju-IrwpKTUAhUIxxQKHV_ZAHA4ChDoAQhDMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=Joseph%20Paul%20Jernigan&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jernigan spent 12 years in prison before his final plea for [[clemency]] was denied. At the prompting of a prison chaplain, he agreed to donate his body for scientific research or medical use. His cadaver was sectioned and photographed for the [[Visible Human Project]] and the [[University of Colorado School of Medicine]] by Dr. Vic Spitzer and associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garling|first1=Caleb|title=Killer’s Corpse Lives Again in Ghostly Time-Lapse Photos|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/04/project-12-31/|website=Wired|accessdate=4 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the subject of an [[HBO]] documentary ''Virtual Corpse'' and also appeared on the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[video game]] TV series, [[GamesMaster]]'s gore special.

The '''Kaohsiung Museum of Labor''' ({{zh|c=高雄市勞工博物館|p=Gāoxióngshì Láogōng Bówùguǎn}}) is a museum about [[Wage labor|labor]] in [[Cianjin District]], [[Kaohsiung City]], [[Taiwan]].

==History==
[[File:Kaohsiung Museum of Labor 20130530.jpg|thumb|Former Kaohsiung Museum of Labor in Pier-2 Art Center.]]
The museum was originally officially opened in conjunction with the [[International Workers' Day]] on 1 May 2010 in [[Pier-2 Art Center]]. However, the soft opening was earlier, on 26 December 2009.&lt;ref name="taiwan-panorama"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taiwan-panorama.com/en/show_issue.php?id=201049904088e.txt&amp;table=3&amp;cur_page=1&amp;distype=|title=Taiwan Panorama – The Voice of Working People:Kaohsiung Museum of Labor|publisher=taiwan-panorama.com|accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the museum was relocated from Yancheng to [[Cianjin District]] and was reopened on 25 July the same year. During the opening ceremony, various events and displays were held, such as retro marketplace and storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aedu/201507250013.aspx|title=Kaohsiung Museum of Labor reopens at new site|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Karo''', or Karonese, are a people of the 'tanah Karo' (Karo lands) of [[North Sumatra]] and a small part of neighboring [[Aceh]]. The Karo lands consist of [[Karo Regency]], plus neighboring areas in [[East Aceh Regency]], [[Langkat Regency]], [[Dairi Regency]], [[Simalungun Regency]] and [[Deli Serdang Regency]].&lt;ref name=karo1&gt;http://faculty.washington.edu/kushnick/karo_biblio_v1.2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the cities of Binjai and [[Medan]], both bordered by Deli Serdang Regency, contain significant Karo populations, particularly in the Padang Bulan area of Medan. The town of Sibolangit, Deli Serdang Regency in the foothills on the road from Medan to Berastagi is also a significant Karo town.

Karoland contains two major volcanoes, [[Mount Sinabung]], which erupted after 400 years of dormancy in 2010, and [[Mount Sibayak]]. Karoland consists of the cooler high lands, and the upper and lower lowlands.

The Karolands were conquered by the Dutch in 1906, and in 1909 roads to the highlands were constructed, ending the isolation of the highland Karo people. The road linked Medan and the lowlands to Kabanjahe and from there to both [[Kutacane]] in Aceh and [[Pematangsiantar]] in [[Simalungun]].

In 1911, an agricultural project began at [[Berastagi]], now the major town in Karoland, to grow European vegetables in the cooler temperatures. Berastagi is today the most prosperous part of Karoland, just one hour from Medan, while towns further in the interior suffer from lower incomes and limited access to healthcare.&lt;ref name=karo1 /&gt;

The administrative centre of Karo Regency is [[Kabanjahe]].

==Karo identity==

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Gezicht over een Karo Batak dorp in de omgeving van het Tobameer TMnr 60011155.jpg|thumb|Traditional [[longhouse]]s at a Karo village near [[Lake Toba]], circa 1870.]]
The Karo people speak the Karo language, a language related to, but not mutually intelligible with, other [[Batak languages]], in addition to [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]. These Karo people are divided up into clans or Merga. The Karo Merga are Ginting, Karo-Karo, Perangin-Angin, Sembiring and Tarigan, these Merga are then divided up into families.

In 13th to 16th century, the Karo people believed has established [[Aru Kingdom]] (also spelled Haru), located in modern day [[Medan]] city and [[Deli Serdang Regency]]. It was one of the earliest kingdom in Sumatra.&lt;ref name="Archaeology Highlands of Sumatra-Aru"&gt;{{cite book | title = From Distant Tales: Archaeology and Ethnohistory in the Highlands of Sumatra | editor1 = Dominik Bonatz | editor2 = John Miksic| editor3 = J. David Neidel | publisher = Cambridge Scholars Publishing | year = 2009 | isbn = 9781443807845| url = https://books.google.com/?id=MusYBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110&amp;dq=Aru+Kingdom#v=onepage&amp;q=Aru%20Kingdom&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population of Aru Kingdom adhered native [[animism]], Hinduism and Islam. Islam slowly gained influence in coastal area since late 13th century. Despite among the earliest Sumatran kingdom that was exposed to Islam, the people of Aru kingdom remained predominantly pagan, especially those who inhabit interior region. The successor state of Aru Kingdom was the [[Sultanate of Deli]], which demonstrate a mixed influences of Karo, Malay, Tamil and Aceh.

Today, the religion of Karo people are mostly [[Christian]], a religion brought to Sumatra in the 19th Century by [[Christian missionaries|missionaries]]. However, an increasing number living away from the Karo Highlands have converted to [[Islam]], with the influence of Muslim [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] from neighboring Deli area in Medan, and [[Javanese people|Javanese]] immigrants, thus making the traditional habits of [[pig farming]] and [[cooking]] less common. Some Muslims and Christians however still retain their traditional [[Animist|animist beliefs]] in [[ghosts]], [[spirits]] (perbegu), and [[Traditional medicine|traditional jungle medicine]], despite that fact it contradicts their other beliefs.

Karo people traditionally lived in shared [[longhouses]], but very few now remain, and new construction is exclusively of modern designs.

It is believed that Karo people may have migrated from the other lands in order to take part in trade with the visiting [[Tamil people|Tamil]]s. This intercourse had an influence on their religious beliefs, as well as ethnic makeup, the [[Marga (Batak)|marga]] 'Sembiring', meaning 'black one', and many Sembiring sub-[[Marga (Batak)|marga]] (Colia, Berahmana, Pandia, Meliala, Depari, Muham, Pelawi and Tekan) are clearly of South-Indian origin, suggesting that inter-marriage between Karo and [[Tamil people]] took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kitlv-journals.nl/index.php/btlv/article/viewFile/3113/3874|title=Deze domeinnaam is via de veiling van DomainOrder.nl geregistreerd|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional beliefs===
{{further|Pemena}}

=== Christianity ===
The Karo were harassing Dutch interests in East Sumatra, and [[Jacob Theodoor Cremer]], a Dutch administrator, regarded [[evangelism]] as a means to suppress this activity. The [[Netherlands Missionary Society]] answered the call, commencing activities in the Karolands in 1890, where they engaged not only in evangelism, but also in [[ethnology]] and documenting the Karo culture. The missionaries attempted to construct a base in [[Kabanjahe]] in the Karo highlands, but were repelled by the suspicious locals.

In retaliation the Dutch administration waged a war to conquer the Karolands, as part of their final consolidation of power in the [[Indies]]. The Karo [[perceived]] Christianity as the 'Dutch religion', and its followers as 'dark-skinned Dutch'. In this context, the Karo church was initially unsuccessful, and by 1950 the church had only 5,000 members. In the years following [[Indonesian independence]] the perception of Christianity among the Karo as an emblem of [[colonialism]] faded, with the church itself acquiring independence, and adopting more elements of traditional Karo culture such as music (whereas previously the brass band was promoted). By 1965, the Karo church had grown to 35,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;History of Christianity in Indonesia. pp. 569-584&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After the Indonesian Genocide ===

[[File:Batak Karo Wedding Selendang.jpg|thumb|upright|Karo married couple being bound in a sling (traditionally used in Indonesia for carrying babies), wearing traditional costume including [[ulos]] (Karonese: ''uis'') this action signifies this couple is now united as man and wife.]]

Unlike the Toba Batak, who embraced Christianity fairly readily, the Karo continued to follow their traditional religion for several decades after the arrival of the first Christian missionaries in the Karolands.

Following the [[Indonesian killings of 1965–1966|Indonesian Genocide]] in 1965–1966, at which time over 70% of the Karo still followed traditional religions, there was a push for Indonesians to identify with an established religion. Many Karo joined the [[GBKP]] (Batak Karo Protestant church) (60,000 were baptised in 1966–1970.&lt;ref&gt;History of Christianity in Indonesia p576&lt;/ref&gt;), and from 5,000 Muslims (mostly non-Karo) in Karoland in 1950, there were 30,000 in 1970.

At this time, the ''Balai Pustaka Adat Merga Si Lima'' (BPAMSL) was established in Berastagi. BPAMSL, proclaimed the 'agama Pemena', or the religion (agama) of the founders ([[Pemena]]).

The concept of 'religion' was relatively new in the Karoland; historically the neighbouring Muslim people, were known as 'kalak Jawi' or the people of the Jawi lands, and the concept of 'kalak Kristen', or Christian people, was the first time that people were identified by their religion rather than their land. The 'agama Pemena' of BPAMSL was a defence against accusations of atheism, Communism or animism.

BPAMSL conducted a ceremony in the Lau Debuk–Debuk hot spring akin to the one to invest a new Karo village. This ceremony essentially validated the Dutch-established Berastagi as a 'true' Karo village, and was attended by the regent of Karo regency and other political figures.

At that time, BPAMSL became the largest religious organisation in the Karolands, surpassing the GBKP, and absorbing many who had joined it following the anti-Communist purge.

As a response to the Pemena movement, the GBKP after 1969 determined that members could participate in village rituals as a matter of [[adat]] (tradition), whereas previously they had been rejected by GBKP as of a religious (unchristian) nature.

After [[Golkar]] won the elections in 1972, Djamin Ginting, a leading BPAMSL figure proclaimed BPAMSL as a movement within Golkar, adopting Islam as his religion, while [[Indonesian National Party]] supporters rejected this. With BPAMSL no longer a united force for the practice of Pemena, and Pemena itself no longer a uniting force in the Karoland, and with all Indonesians required to follow one of the religions of Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism, Hinduism and Buddhism, or risk writing 'without belief' on their identity card, the board members of BPAMSL met with a wealthy Indian man from Medan and determined that the traditional religion was in fact an expression of Indian Hinduism, and that it had been founded by a 'Bagavan Bṛgu', from which had been derived the alternate name for the Karo beliefs 'Perbegu' (followers of 'begu' (in Karo, begu is a spirit or ghost)), the existence of Indian-originating Karo [[Marga (Batak)|marga]] names and similarities between Karo ritual and Indian Hindu ones all proving this. Thus the Association of Karo Hinduism (PAHK) was proclaimed.

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Een verzameling Karo Batak objecten waaronder muziekinstrumenten een mand een zwaard een wichelboek een palmwijnkoker en een aantal doeken TMnr 60011124.jpg|thumb|upright|Musical instruments and other items identified as Karo Batak, photograph (circa 1870) by [[Kristen Feilberg]].]]
The PAHK declared 'Pemena is the same as Hinduism' and received funding from Medan Indians for their cause. PAHK became a movement within [[Parisada Hindu Dharma]] Indonesia, and as a culmination of this, in 1985 PAHK became a branch of the PHDI, PHDK. When Parisada Hindu Dharma Karo (PHDK) was established, it claimed 50,000 members, and 50,000 more sympathisers. The PHD built a Balinese-style temple in Tanjung, a Karo village to inaugurate the PHDK. In doing so it was stated that PHDI (i.e. Balinese) Hinduism was the only valid form, and in fact the Karo 'Hindu' ritual were invalid, the name change from 'Hindu Karo' to 'Hindu Dharma Karo' and the replacement of Tamil Indians on the PAHK board with Balinese on the PHDK symbolising the assertion of 'Hindu Dharma' as the 'valid' Hindu religion, with little regard paid to re-imagining Karo rituals within an Agama Hindu context.

There was an immediate decline in PAHK/PHDK support, with a small number of people still following the PHDK practices, but others following traditional Karo (Pemena) rituals outside of the formal context of PHDK. This left the Christian GBKP, by then for many years an indigenous Karo-run adat-respecting church a rather more comfortable option for most Karo than the Balinese Hinduism asserted by PHDK. There are today four Balinese-style PHDK temples in the Karoland, but the concept of Karo traditional beliefs as a manifestation of Hinduism is otherwise largely extinct.&lt;ref&gt;Hinduism in Modern Indonesia. Chapter 13. Juara Ginting&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern Christianity ===
Although the [[Gereja Batak Karo Protestan]] (GBKP) is the largest Karo church, with has 276,000 members (as of 2006) in 398 congregations with 196 pastors,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oikoumene.org/ru/member-churches/regions/asia/indonesia/karo-batak-protestant-church.html&lt;/ref&gt; there are also Catholic (33,000 members as of 1986) and [[Assemblies of God|several]] [[Pentecostal Church in Indonesia|Pentecostalist]] denominations.

== Merga Si Lima ==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Portret van een jonge Karo Batak vrouw TMnr 60023653.jpg|thumb|upright|A Karo woman in traditional attire.]]

Karo people belong to one of five [[Marga (Batak)|marga]] or clans, which are Ginting, Karo-Karo, Perangin-Angin, Sembiring and Tarigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Masri Singarimbun|title=Kinship, Descent, and Alliance Among the Karo Batak|year=1975|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=05-200-2692-6|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each [[Marga (Batak)|marga]] is further divided into sub-[[Marga (Batak)|marga]] (83 in total). With the exception of [[Marga (Batak)|marga]] Karo-Karo, most Karo identify themselves by their principal rather than sub-[[Marga (Batak)|marga]].

Karo and Batak [[adat]] prohibits marriage within a [[Marga (Batak)|marga]] (e.g., Ginting with Ginting). Upon marriage, the bride becomes a part of the groom's family, with the kalimbubu (bride's family) joining with anakberu (groom's family).

Karonese marriages are very large affairs, with typically 200 attendees, comprising the numerous family members of both marrying parties, comprising a number of elements, including the chewing of betel nut (sirih), traditional Karonese dancing (which focuses on hand movements), the payment of a nominal dowry to each of the kalimbubu. Food is cooked by the anakberu, who will spend many hours cooking vast quantities to cater for the numerous guests. This social obligation is expected to be reciprocated, so that Karonese people can attend several weddings each month. Non-Karo people do not attend the wedding ceremony, although such friends might be invited to a separate party in the evening. Where a non-Karonese person wishes to marry a Karonese, they would be adopted into a Karo [[Marga (Batak)|marga]].

Traditionally kalimbubu-anakberu relationships would be reinforced by cross-cousin marriages (i.e. to one's mother's brother's child), however in modern Karo society this tradition is no longer important.&lt;ref name=karo1 /&gt;

=== Marga origin mythology ===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM 'Karolanden. Si Garang Garang links een bamboe dakladder op den achtergrond de Sinaboeng.' TMnr 10017210.jpg|thumb|right|Karo traditional house, 1914.]]
Karo tradition states that the Merga si Lima originate from five villages, each established by a Sibayak, a founding community. The Sibayak of Suka whose family name was Ginting Suka established the village of Suka. The Sibayak of Lingga called Karo-karo Sinulingga established the village of Lingga. The Sibayak of Barusjahe whose family name was Karo-karo Barus pioneered the village of Barusjahe. The Sibayak of Sarinembah, called Sembiring Meliala established the village of Sarinembah. The Sibayak of Kutabuluh named Perangin-angin established the village of Kutabuluh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hilderia Sitanggang|title=Arsitektur Tradisional Batak Karo|year=1991|publisher=Direktorat Jenderal Kebudayaan|oclc=26988946|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each one of these five villages has its own satellite villages inhabited by the extended families of the main village inhabitants. The satellite villages were established for the convenience of the villagers whose fields were relatively far from the main villages. The purpose was to save them time when travelling back and forth from the village to their fields. Today, these satellite villages have developed and matured to be independent of the main villages. In the old times, these satellite villages used to ask for help from the main villages to deal with natural disasters, tribal disputes, diseases and famine.

The leaders of these satellite villages were called URUNGs. The Sibayak of Lingga administered five villages i.e., Tiganderket, Tiga Pancur, Naman, Lingga and Batukarang. The Sibayak of Suka administered four villages i.e., Suka, Seberaya, Ajinembah and Tengging. The Sibayak of Sarinembah administered four villages i.e., Sarinembah, Perbesi, Juhar and Kutabangun. The Sibayak of Barusjahe administered two villages i.e., Barusjahe and Sukanalu. The Sibayak of Kutabuluh administered two villages i.e., Kutabuluh and Marding-ding.

The '''Khasi people''', endonym: {{Lang|kha|Ki Khun U Hynñiewtrep}} ("Children of the Seven Huts"), are an indigenous ethnic group of [[Meghalaya]] in north-eastern [[India]], with a significant population in the bordering state of [[Assam]], and in certain parts of [[Bangladesh]]. The Khasi people are the native people of [[Meghalaya]] and are the largest ethnic group in the state. Their language, [[Khasi language|Khasi]], is categorised as the northernmost [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] language. Primarily an oral language, they had no script of their own, they used the Bengali script until the arrival of the Welsh missionaries. Particularly significant in this regard was a Welsh evangelist, [[Thomas Jones (missionary)|Thomas Jones]], who had transcribed the Khasi language into the Roman/Latin script. The Khasi people form the majority of the population of the eastern part of [[Meghalaya]], and is the state's largest community, with around 48% of the population of Meghalaya. Before the arrival of Christian missionaries the Khasi people practiced an indigenous tribal religion.&lt;ref&gt;Iarington Kharkongngor (1973), The Preparation For The Gospel In Traditional Khasi Belief. I. Kharkongngor. pp. 19-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gurdon, P.R.T. The Khasis.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to popular belief, the Khasis were never [[Sanskritized]] (nor were they [[Islamicized]]). &lt;ref&gt;Adrian Hastings, Ed., A World History of Christianity (1999), William B&gt; Eerdmans Publishing Company; Grand Rapids, Michigan/Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; Though around 85% of the Khasi populace have embraced Christianity, a substantial minority of the Khasi people still follow and practice their age old indigenous religion, which is known as ''Ka Niam Khasi''. Other religions practised among the Khasis include [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], [[Anglicanism]], [[Unitarianism]], [[Presbyterianism]] (largest Christian denomination among the Khasis), and others. A small number of Khasis, as a result of inter-community marriages, are also Muslims. The main crops produced by the Khasi people are [[betel leaf]], [[areca nut]], oranges, local rice, vegetables, etc.

The War sub-tribe of the Khasi community designed and built the famous [[living root bridges]] of the [[Cherrapunji]] region. Under the Constitution of India, the Khasis have been granted the status of [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled Tribe]]. A unique feature of the Khasi people is that they follow the matrilineal system of descent and inheritance. However, it must not be wrongly thought that men are completely powerless and have no say in private affairs of the household whatsoever. In matters of inheritance, some families do give men shares of the ancestral property, though the daughters usually get bigger shares. The reason is that, since women are the ones to continue the family lineage, giving them larger shares is necessary for them to run the households. In the Khasi system of asset management, the Khasi maternal uncles (Kñi) of the household (usually under the authority of the eldest Kñi), are the managers of their sister's property. No decision can be taken without their consent. In their wife's household too, they provide for their children like a normal father would. In present times, many Khasis are well placed in government and corporate sectors. Many Khasis are well educated. The tribe has produced many IAS, IPS and IFS bureaucrats. Many Khasis are also settled abroad, particularly in the US and Great Britain.

==History ==

===Khasi mythology===
Khasi mythology traces the tribe's original abode to 'Ki ''Hynñiewtrep'' ("The Seven Huts").&lt;ref name="Banaji2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shakuntala Banaji|title=South Asian media cultures | date=1 April 2010|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=978-1-84331-842-2|pages=48–}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Khasi mythology, "U Blei Trai Kynrad" (God, the Lord Master) had originally distributed the human race into 16 heavenly families (''Khadhynriew Trep'').&lt;ref name="Nongkinrih2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Aurelius Kyrham Nongkinrih|title=Khasi society of Meghalaya: a sociological understanding |year=2002|publisher=Indus Publishing|  isbn=978-81-7387-137-5 | pages=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, seven out of these 16 families are stuck on earth while the other 9 are stuck in Heaven. According to the myth, a heavenly ladder resting on the sacred Lum Sohpetbneng Peak (located in the present-day [[Ri-Bhoi district]])enabled people to go freely and frequently to heaven whenever they pleased until one day they were tricked into cutting a divine tree which was situated at Lum Diengiei Peak (also in present-day Ri-Bhoi district), a grave error which prevented them access to the heavens forever. This myth is often seen as a metaphor of how nature and trees in particular are the manifestation of the divine on Earth and destroying nature and trees means severing our ties with the Divine. The Khasi indigenous religion like many other tribal religions of the world which are all based on nature worship face a growing threat of disappearance with the widespread dominance of Christianity and draws its beliefs from earlier times.
Like the Japanese, the Khasis use the Rooster as a symbol because they believe that it was he who aroused God and also humbly paved and cleared the path for God to create the Universe in the beginning of time. The rooster is the symbol of Morning marking a new beginning and a new sunrise.

===Scholarly research===
{{See also|Peopling of India}}

The [[Khasi language]] is classified as part of the [[Austroasiatic]] language family. According to Peter Wilhelm Schmidt, the Khasi people are related to the [[Mon–Khmer languages|Mon-Khmer]] people of South East Asia. Multiple researches indicate that the Austroasiatic populations in India are derived from migrations from southeast Asia during the Holocene. Many of the words also originate from the Tibetan language. "Nga" meaning "I" is the same in Khasi. Meghalaya was a part of Burma much before India claimed it as a part of it after it's independence from British rule. Traces of connections with the Kachin tribe of North Burma have been also been in the Khasis. The Khasi people also have their own word for the Himalayan mountains which is "Ki Lum Makachang" which means that at one point of time, they did cross the mighty mountains. Therefore, all these records and their present culture, features and language strongly show that they also have a strong Tibeto-Himalayan- Burman influence. The word "Khas" means hills and they have always been people of cold and hilly regions and have never been connected to the plains or arid regions. This nature loving tribe call the wettest place on Earth their home. The village of Mawsynram in Meghalaya receives 467 inches of rain per year.

===Modern times===
The Khasis first came in contact with the [[British Raj|British]] in 1823, after the latter captured Assam. The area inhabited by the Khasis became a part of the Assam province after the Khasi Hill States (which numbered to about 25 kingdoms) entered into a subsidiary alliance with the British.

== Geographical distribution and sub-groups ==
[[File:1947-Khasi_states.png|thumb|left|Khasi states, 1947]]
According to the 2011 Census of India, over 1.41&amp;nbsp;million Khasi lived in [[Meghalaya]] in the districts of East Khasi Hills, West Khasi Hills, South West Khasi Hills, Ri-Bhoi, West Jaintia Hills and East Jaintia Hills. In Assam, their population reached 35,000. It is generally considered by many Khasi sociologists that the Khasi Tribe consist of seven sub-tribes, hence the title 'Children of the Seven Huts': Khynriam, Pnar, Bhoi, War, Maram, Lyngngam and Diko. The Khynriam (or Nongphlang) inhabit the uplands of the East Khasi Hills District; the Pnar or Synteng live in the uplands of the Jaintia Hills. The Bhoi live in the lower hills to the north and north-east of the Khasi Hills. and Jaintia Hills towards the [[Brahmaputra]] valley, a vast area now under Ri Bhoi District. The [[War language|War]], usually divided into War-Jaintia and War-Khynriam in the south of the Khasi Hills, live on the steep southern slopes leading to [[Bangladesh]]. The Maram inhabit the uplands of the central parts of West Khasi Hills Districts. The Lyngngam people who inhabit the western parts of the West Khasi Hills bordering the Garo Hills display linguistic and cultural characteristics which show influences from both the Khasis to their east and the Garo people to the west. The last sub-group completing the "seven huts", are the Diko, an extinct group who once inhabited the lowlands of the West Khasi Hills.

== Genetics ==
[[Image:Khasi People.jpg|thumb|100px|left|A Khasi woman]] [[Image:Cachimbo- Khasi.jpg|thumb|100px|right|A Khasi man]]
Khasi people are mostly of short stature, with some exceptions. Estimates show that the average height is 5 feet 2 inches for Khasi men and around 4 feet 11 inches for khasi women. A majority of Khasi people are short while  a very few among them are taller, such as some Khasi males with heights ranging from 5.5 feet to 5.6 feet respectively and for women heights ranging from 5 feet to 5.4 feet normally.

==Dress==

[[File:Shad Suk Mysiem.JPG|thumb|Men dance during the Khasi festival of Shad Suk Mynsiem in Shillong]]
The traditional Khasi male dress is a ''Jymphong'', a longish sleeveless coat without collar, fastened by thongs in front. Nowadays, most male Khasis have adopted western attire. On ceremonial occasions they appear in a ''Jymphong'' and [[sarong]] with an ornamental waist-band and they may also wear a turban.

The traditional Khasi female dress is called the ''Jainsem'' or ''Dhara'', both of which are rather elaborate with several pieces of cloth, giving the body a cylindrical shape. On ceremonial occasions they may wear a crown of silver or gold. A spike or peak is fixed to the back of the crown, corresponding to the feathers worn by the menfolk. The ''Jainsem'' consists of two pieces of material fastened at each shoulder. The "Dhara" consists of a single piece of material also fastened at each shoulder.

== Marriage ==
The Khasis are, for the most part, monogamous. Their social organisation does not favour other forms of marriage; therefore, deviation from this norm is quite rare. Young men and women are permitted considerable freedom in the choice of mates. Potential marriage partners are likely to have been acquainted before betrothal. Once a man has selected his desired spouse, he reports his choice to his parents. They then secure the services of a mediator to make the arrangements with the woman's family (provided that the man's clan agree with his choice). The parents of the woman ascertain her wishes and if she agrees to the arrangement her parents check to make certain that the man to be wed is not a member of their clan (since Khasi clans are exogamous, marital partners may not be from the same clan). If this is satisfactory then a wedding date is set.

Divorce (with causes ranging from incompatibility to lack of offspring) is easily obtainable. This ceremony traditionally consists of the husband handing the wife 5 cowries or paisa which the wife then hands back to her husband along with 5 of her own. The husband then throws these away or gives them to a village elder who throws them away.  Present-day Khasis divorce through the Indian legal system.

The type of marriage is the determining factor in marital residence. In short, post marital residence for a married man when an heiress (known as ''Ka Khadduh'')  is involved must be matrilocal (that is, in his mother-in-law's house), while post marital residence when a non-heiress is involved is neolocal. Generally, Khasi men prefer to marry a non-heiress because it will allow them to form independent family units somewhat immune to pressures from the wife's kin. Traditionally (though nowadays rule is not absolutely true), a Khasi man returns to his Iing-Kur (maternal home) upon the death of his spouse (if she is a Khadduh and they both have no children). These practices are the result of rules governing inheritance and property ownership. These rules are themselves related to the structure of the Khasi Kur (clan system).

== Onomastics ==

Khasi names are known for their originality and elaborate nature.  The given names may be invented by parents for their children, and these can be based on traditional native names, Christian names, or other English words.  The family names, which they call "surnames," remain typically in the native Khasi language.

== Traditional polity ==
The traditional political structure of the Khasi community is democratic in nature. In the past, the Khasis consisted of independent native states called Syiemships, where male elders of various clans under the leadership of the Chief (called U Syiem) would congregate during Durbars or sessions and come to a decision regarding any dispute or problem that would arise in the Syiemship. At the village level, there exists a similar arrangement where all the residents of the village or town come together under the leadership of an elected Headman (called U Rangbah Shnong), to decide on matters pertaining to the locality. This system of village administration is much like the [[Panchayati Raj]] prevalent in most Indian States. There were around 25 independent native states on record which were annexed and acceded to the Indian Union. The Syiems of these native states (called Hima)  were traditionally elected by the people or ruling clans of their respective domains. Famous among these Syiemships are Hima Mylliem, Hima Khyrim, Hima Nongkhlaw, amongst others. These Syiemships continue to exist and function till today under the purview of the Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council (KHADC), which draws its legal power and authority from the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://megartsculture.gov.in/herit_volIII-trad_insts.htm|title=Traditional Institutions of the People of Meghalaya, Heritage of Meghalaya: Department of Arts and Culture, Government of Meghalaya|website=megartsculture.gov.in|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kong is also involved in the Christian [[Charismatic Movement]], a philosophy of ministry that emphasises the [[Great Commandment]], the [[Great Commission]] and the [[Cultural Mandate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kong Hee's Profile|work=City Harvest Church|url=http://www.chc.org.sg/eng/founder/founder.php|accessdate=5 June 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081114010101/http://www.chc.org.sg/eng/founder/founder.php|archivedate=14 November 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Kong is the fifth child of Kong Leng, a [[professional engineer]], and Toh Poh-Eng, a diamond trader. From 1975 to 1988, Kong was a member of [[Marine Parade Christian Centre]], an [[Anglican church]] located in eastern Singapore. He studied at [[Raffles Institution]] (1977–1980), [[Raffles Junior College]] (1981–1982) as well as [[National University of Singapore]], Bachelor of Science (Computer &amp; Information Sciences) (1985–1988).

During his university years, he worked part-time for the [[Chapel of the Resurrection]] under the oversight of Anglican vicar, Reverend Dr. [[Canon James Wong]]. During that tenure, he helped Canon Wong set up a new congregation, [[Orchard Christian Centre]]. Upon university graduation in 1988, Kong worked a short stint in a local publishing house as a programmer.

In 1989, Kong was a staff evangelist with "[[Christ For Asia]]", a missions organisation in the [[Philippines]] led by [[Assemblies of God]] minister, Reverend [[Randy Sing]]. At that same time, there was an opportunity for Kong to pioneer a new church in Singapore. With the support and encouragement of some senior pastors in the city, Kong decided to relocate back to Singapore and helped set up a new congregation with 20 youths.

==City Harvest Church (1989–2016)==
On 7 May 1989, [[City Harvest Church]] was founded as a department (known as "Ekklesia Ministry") of Bethany Christian Centre (Assemblies of God).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Every Member is a Minister' at Singapore Megachurch |publisher=Church &amp; Ministry |date=10 February 2004 |url=http://www.charismanews.com/a.php?ArticleID=8559 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427054242/http://www.charismanews.com/a.php?ArticleID=8559 |archivedate=27 April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1997, Kong was the executive director of the [[Festival of Praise]], an annual event that brought together churches for united prayer and worship. Kong was a board member of Dr. [[David Yonggi Cho]]'s [[Church Growth International]] (South Korea) and Dr. [[Luis Bush]]'s Transform World (Indonesia). With and his wife [[Sun Ho]], they once owned two companies, [[International Harvest]] and [[Skin Couture]].

In December 2010, City Harvest Church had an average of 23,256 attendees&lt;ref name="CHCStory"&gt;{{cite web|title=CHC Story|work=City Harvest Church|url=http://www.chc.org.sg/_eng/church/church.php|accessdate=17 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927181452/http://www.chc.org.sg/_eng/church/church.php|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 47 affiliate "Harvest" churches, as well as 29 affiliate churches and 6 Bible schools in Asia, namely, in Singapore, Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia and Taiwan. Another 18 affiliate churches in the East and West Malaysia are under the [[Malaysian Harvest Fellowship]] which Kong Hee has co-founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Isn't the American church growing?|work=Charisma Magazine|url=http://www.charismamag.com/display.php?id=10291|accessdate=23 January 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022132426/http://www.charismamag.com/display.php?id=10291|archive-date=22 October 2006|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speakers |work=City City Church |url=http://www.ccc.org.au/presence/default.asp?page=presenceSpeakers |accessdate=29 June 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824174023/http://www.ccc.org.au/presence/default.asp?page=presenceSpeakers |archivedate=24 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kong Hee's Profile |work=City Harvest Church |url=http://www.chc.org.sg/english/founder/profile.cfm |accessdate=5 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070603075348/http://www.chc.org.sg/english/founder/profile.cfm |archivedate=3 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Church |work=City Harvest Church |url=http://www.chc.org.sg/english/founder/history.cfm |accessdate=5 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517045056/http://www.chc.org.sg/english/founder/history.cfm |archivedate=17 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigations===
On 31 May 2010, the Office of the Commissioner of Charities and the [[Commercial Affairs Department]] of the Singapore Police began investigating more than 16 individuals linked to City Harvest Church, including church founder Kong Hee and his wife, [[Sun Ho]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xin.msn.com/en/singapore/article.aspx?cp-documentid=4121597|title=MSN Singapore - Outlook, Skype, Hotmail, Messenger|website=news.xin.msn.com|access-date=2 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602222213/http://news.xin.msn.com/en/singapore/article.aspx?cp-documentid=4121597|archive-date=2 June 2010|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1063720/1/.html|title=News|publisher=|accessdate=3 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318051815/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1063720/1/.html|archive-date=18 March 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police were looking into financial transactions involving the possible falsification of accounts and criminal breach of trust amounting to millions of dollars which dated back a number of years.

On 26 June 2012, the Commissioner of Charities released a press statement detailing the results of its inquiry. It stated that there were misconduct and mismanagement in the administration of City Harvest Church. There were irregularities of at least $23 million in the church's funds, which were used to finance [[Ho Yeow Sun|Sun Ho]]'s secular music career. There was also a concerted effort to conceal this movement of funds from stakeholders. Kong Hee and seven others were suspended from their roles in the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://app1.mcys.gov.sg/PressRoom/InquiryfoundmisconductandmismanagementinCHC.aspx |title=Inquiry found misconduct and mismanagement in the City Harvest Church - Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports |date=29 June 2012 |publisher= |accessdate=3 December 2016 |deadurl=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629045349/http://app1.mcys.gov.sg/PressRoom/InquiryfoundmisconductandmismanagementinCHC.aspx |archivedate=29 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trial and conviction===

The trial of Kong Hee and the five other leaders commenced in May 2013 and was adjourned several times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-22540597|title=Singapore church leaders tried on corruption charges|date=15 May 2013|publisher=|accessdate=3 December 2016|via=www.bbc.co.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170601043346/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-22540597|archive-date=1 June 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | df=dmy-all | url=http://m.todayonline.com/worldcup/singapore/city-harvest-church-trial-resume-monday | title=Fourth leg of the trial will stretch for a week and will likely see former church board member John Lam take the stand | accessdate=2015-05-31 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304130242/http://m.todayonline.com/worldcup/singapore/city-harvest-church-trial-resume-monday | archivedate=4 March 2016 | deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/city-harvest-church-case-adjourned-to-oct-4|title=City Harvest Church case adjourned to Oct 4|first=|last=migration|date=30 August 2012|publisher=|accessdate=3 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306180341/http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/city-harvest-church-case-adjourned-to-oct-4|archive-date=6 March 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a total of 142 days of hearings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/trials-and-tragedies-10-singapore-events-that-shaped-2015|title=Trials and tragedies: 10 Singapore events that shaped 2015|first=|last=hermes|date=29 December 2015|publisher=|accessdate=3 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101133912/http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/trials-and-tragedies-10-singapore-events-that-shaped-2015|archive-date=1 November 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The verdicts were announced on 21 October 2015.

Sentencing was on 20 November 2015.

===Appeals===

On 27 November 2015, it was reported that the Attorney General's Chambers has filed appeals against the sentence issued to Kong Hee and the five other defendants, on the grounds that it is  "manifestly inadequate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=City Harvest trial: Prosecution appeals 'manifestly inadequate' sentences|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/city-harvest-trial/2298000.html|accessdate=1 December 2015|publisher=MediaCorp Pte Ltd|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151130003228/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/city-harvest-trial/2298000.html|archive-date=30 November 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 December 2015, it was reported that Kong Hee and the other five defendants have also filed appeals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/city-harvest-trial-all/2312700.html|title=City Harvest trial: All six convicted file notices of appeal|publisher=|accessdate=3 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402103728/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/city-harvest-trial-all/2312700.html|archive-date=2 April 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 March 2016, it was reported that the appeal hearing would commence on 19 September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/city-harvest-church/2572212.html|title=City Harvest Church appeal: Case to be heard in September|publisher=|accessdate=3 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116221656/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/city-harvest-church/2572212.html|archive-date=16 November 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singapore's ambassador-at-large [[Bilahari Kausikan]] posted a warning on Facebook to be wary of  Kong Hee after noting that he had made missionary trips to Japanese cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/spore-diplomat-kausikan-warns-japanese-not-be-deceived-kong-hee|title=S'pore diplomat Kausikan warns Japanese not to be deceived by Kong Hee|website=AsiaOne|access-date=2016-04-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425162319/http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/spore-diplomat-kausikan-warns-japanese-not-be-deceived-kong-hee|archive-date=25 April 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 April 2017, his original sentence of 8 years in prison was reduced to 3.5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/city-harvest-appeal-kong-hee-s-sentence-reduced-to-3-5-years/3659450.html|title=City Harvest appeal: Kong Hee's sentence reduced to 3.5 years|publisher=|access-date=19 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415000625/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/city-harvest-appeal-kong-hee-s-sentence-reduced-to-3-5-years/3659450.html|archive-date=15 April 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has started serving his sentence from the 21 April 2017 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/some-will-start-serving-sentences-by-april-21|title=City Harvest case: Some will start serving sentences by April 21|first=|last=hermes|date=12 April 2017|publisher=|access-date=19 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420045352/http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/some-will-start-serving-sentences-by-april-21|archive-date=20 April 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/city-harvest-church-founder-kong-hee-apologises-for-unwise-decisions-will-start-serving?xtor=CS1-10#link_time=1492616653|title=City Harvest Church founder Kong Hee apologises for 'unwise' decisions, will start serving sentence on April 21|first=|last=hermesauto|date=19 April 2017|publisher=|access-date=9 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803022124/http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/city-harvest-church-founder-kong-hee-apologises-for-unwise-decisions-will-start-serving?xtor=CS1-10#link_time=1492616653|archive-date=3 August 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However,in Page 264-267 of the appeal judgment, Kong is characterised as being "coloured by greed and self-interest", as the Crossover project was designed to benefit Sun Ho and Kong Hee. Sun Ho's contract with Xtron (a company controlled by Kong Hee) was to entitle Sun to 25% of gross income (estimated to reach US$30M) regardless of project costs, in addition to a large salary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Portals/0/Docs/Judgments/[2017]%20SGHC%2071.pdf | title=Public Prosecutor v Lam Leng Hung and other appeals | website=www.singaporelawwatch.sg}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he had told members they were off-salary and needed financial support. A private fund was set up to raise over $3 million and was fully expended by the couple in just 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.charities.gov.sg/Documents/COC_Press_Statement_on_CHC__26_June_2012.pdf | title=INQUIRY FOUND MISCONDUCT AND MISMANAGEMENT IN THE CITY HARVEST CHURCH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Plagiarism===
In March 2010, a blogger identified plagiarism on Kong Hee's 'Daily Devotionals' as they were similar to writings to another publication, "[[The Leadership Bible]]" which was published 10 years ago. The copied text were published as physical copies into two books, "[[Renewing Your Spiritual Energy in 90 Days]]" without accreditation to the original authors. Kong Hee's daily devotionals were originally compiled from his personal reading notes and printed as supplementary reading for his members, free of charge. Some years later, due to popular demand overseas, a local publisher compiled and released foreign language translations of the devotional for sale.

Kong Hee posted a note on his website and explained that the devotion was "originally meant only for internal circulation among the members of my church. As such, there was an oversight in not quoting the sources of some portions that borrow from the writings of other Christian authors." There was also an apology for the oversight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Kong Hee Devotion|url= http://www.konghee.com/www?cat=12|accessdate= 15 June 2010|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090505150335/http://www.konghee.com/www/?cat=12|archive-date= 5 May 2009|dead-url= no|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ST-plagiarisedBook"&gt;[http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_539353.html Kong Hee 'plagiarised' book ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615084701/http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_539353.html |date=15 June 2010 }}, [[The Straits Times]], 12 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://www.straitstimes.com/PrimeNews/Story/STIStory_539170.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The publisher who is also a member of City Harvest Church, acknowledged that at the time of publication, both himself and Mr Kong were aware that certain portions of the content were not original.&lt;ref name="ST-plagiarisedBook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;City Harvest founder now accused of plagiarism, The Straits Times, 12 June 2010, pg A3&lt;/ref&gt;
The publisher of "Renewal" has since made amendments to the soft copies to include accreditation.

==Family==
Kong is married to pop music singer [[Sun Ho]]. They have one son, Dayan Kong, who was born in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/crime/probe-was-traumatic-my-son-kong-hee|title=Probe was traumatic for my son: Kong Hee|website=AsiaOne|access-date=2016-04-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424225725/http://news.asiaone.com/news/crime/probe-was-traumatic-my-son-kong-hee|archive-date=24 April 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Le Invasioni Barbariche in Italia''' is Professor [[Pasquale Villari]]'s popular account of the barbarian invasions of the Roman Empire from the [[Nerva–Antonine dynasty#Antonine dynasty|Antonines]] to the coronation of [[Charlemagne]] in 800 A.D. as Holy Roman Emperor. The book was first published in 1901 by [[Hoepli|Ulrico Hoepli]] in Milan.&lt;ref name=Invasioni&gt;{{cite book|author=Villari, Pasquale|title=Le invasioni barbariche in Italia|year=1901|url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000351979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book, with 3 maps and about 500 pages,&lt;ref name=Invasioni/&gt; was intended to be easy to read and appealing to the general reader of Italian. Hoepli published the second, third and fourth editions in 1905, 1920 and 1928. In the book, Villari's main focus is on the Teutonic invasions of the 3rd through 6th centuries A.D.

In 1902 Fisher Unvwin published a 2-volume translation (''The Barbarian Invasions of Italy'') by [[Linda White Mazini Villari|Linda Villari]], the wife of Pasquale Villari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Villari, Pasquale|translator=Villari, Linda|title=The Barbarian Invasions of Italy|year=1902|publisher=T. Fisher Unvwin|url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/005919523}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|Madame Villari's translation is verbally as accurate as might have been expected; but somehow it lacks the attractiveness of the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review of ''Le Invasioni Barbariche in Italia'' &amp; ''The Barbarian Invasions of Italy''|journal=The Athenæum|date=23 August 1902|issue=no. 3904|pages=241–242|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=iau.31858029268129;view=1up;seq=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{blockquote|The figures of the chief actors in this strife of centuries—Alaric, Attila, Genseric, Theodoric, Justinian, Belisarius, Alboin—are well and forcibly drawn by Professor Villari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review of ''The Barbarian Invasions of Italy''|date=31 May 1902|journal=The Spectator|pages=256–257|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xYRAAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA256}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Lengo''' is a [[Southeast Solomonic languages|Southeast Solomonic]] language of [[Guadalcanal]].

==Phonology==

===Vowels===

Lengo has 6 [[vowel]]s (Unger, 2008:5).

{|class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
!
! [[Front vowel|Front]]
! [[Back vowel|Back]]
|-
! [[Close vowel|Close]]
| {{IPA|i}}
| {{IPA|u}}
|-
! [[Close-mid vowel|Close-Mid]]

| {{IPA|o}}
|-
! [[Open-mid vowel|Open-Mid]]
| {{IPA|ɛ}}
|
|-
! [[Open vowel|Open]]
|
| {{IPA|ɑ}}
|}
[[Diphthong|Vowel sequences]] occur commonly for all combinations of
these vowels, with the exception of {{IPA|/uo/}}. The front open-mid vowel {{IPA|/ɛ/}} never occurs in sequence.

===Consonants===

Lengo has 15 [[consonant]]s (Unger, 2008:4).

{|class=wikitable style=text-align:center

![[Labial consonant|Labial]]

|{{IPA|r}}
|
|-
![[Lateral consonant|Lateral]]
| 
|{{IPA|l}}
| 
|}
[[Voice (phonetics)|Voiced]] stops are [[Prenasalized consonant|prenasalized]]. Two instances of regional variation in these phonemes have been observed. These are {{IPA|/v/}} becoming {{IPA|/β/}}, and {{IPA|/ð/}} becoming {{IPA|/z/}}.

==Morphology==

===Pronominal Systems===
Lengo has five sets of [[Pronouns|pronominal forms]]. These are emphatic, subject reference, object, direct possessor, and indirect possessor. These distinguish maximally between four [[Grammatical person|persons]] (first person inclusive and exclusive, second, and third person), and four [[Grammatical number|numbers]] (singular, plural, dual, and paucal). There is no [[grammatical gender]] distinction, but there is an [[animacy]] distinction in the object paradigm. Two further uses of these pronominal forms occur - a [[reflexive pronoun]], and a set of [[Interrogative word|interrogative pronouns]] (Unger, 2008:27-29).

The dual and paucal forms are derived from the plural forms by the addition of '''ko-''' and '''tu-''' respectively.
The dual forms are used only to indicate ''''two and only two'''', whilst the plural and paucal forms mean ''''two or more'''' and ''''three or more'''' respectively. First person exclusive excludes the addresse(s).

====Emphatic Pronouns====
The emphatic pronoun in Lengo is optional, and can occur in combination with obligatory pronouns that may occur with subject or object function. It can also appear without other pronouns. It is used to emphasize the semantic role of a noun in a clause (Unger, 2008:29).

|-
| ||colspan="9"| "they two pulled up the canoe and I continued to run."
|}(Unger, 2008:30)

====Subject Reference Pronouns====
The subject reference pronoun appears as the first element in a verb phrase. It is obligatory in any main clause, but can be excepted in subordinate clauses. It is optional in imperative sentences (Unger, 2008:34).

|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;DU:EP:1EX.PL&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;ART P.&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;1EX.PL-DU&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;go&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;LOC&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;river&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| ||colspan="6"|"We two, P. and I, we two went to the river."  
|} (Unger, 2008:37)

====Object Pronouns====
The object form in Lengo is identified using a set of pronominal suffixes, which index the object arguments on the verb. In instances where a verb takes both a direct and indirect object, only the indirect object is marked. The third person plural object form is marked for animate or inanimate objects (Unger, 2008:39).

|} (Unger, 2008:39)

|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;3PL&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;wait-o:1SG&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| ||colspan="2"| "They await me."  
|} (Unger, 2008:39)

====Direct Possessor Pronouns====
The direct possessor form is used for [[Inalienable possession|inalienably possessed]] nouns. It is a suffix on the possessed noun that indicates the possessor. In the case of the dual and paucal forms, number is indicated as a prefix on the noun, and the plural form of the possessive suffix is used (Unger, 2008:42).

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
! 
! [[Grammatical person|1st Inclusive]]
! 1st Exclusive
! 2nd
! 3rd
|-
! [[Singular number#Singular versus plural|Singular]]
|colspan="2"| -gu
| -mu
| -a, -na
|-
! [[Plural]]
| -da
| -mami
| -mu
| -dira
|-
! [[Dual (grammatical number)|Dual]]
| ko- -da
| ko- -mami
| ko- -miu
| ko- -dira
|-
! [[Singular number#Paucal|Paucal]]
| tu- -da
| tu- -mami
| tu- -miu
| tu- -dira
|}(Unger, 2008:41)

The third person singular direct possessor appears in two forms, with '-a' being more prevalent than '-na' (Unger, 2008:41).

'''Examples:'''
:{|
| (5) || ''na''|| ''vae-'''gu'''''
|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;ART&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;house-PS:1SG&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| ||colspan="2"| "My house." 
|} (Unger, 2008:42)
&lt;br /&gt;
:{|
| (6) || ''A''|| '''''ko-'''dae'''-mami''''' ||''e'' ||''belo''
|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;ART&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;DU-child-PL:1EX.PL&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;3SG&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;ring.bell&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| ||colspan="4"| "our two's child is ringing the bell." 
|} (Unger, 2008:49)

====Indirect Possessor Pronouns====
The indirect possessor form is used for [[alienable possession|alienably possessed]] nouns. It occurs as a free morpheme preceding the possessed noun. There are two categories distinguished - 'oral consumable' and 'general'. The oral consumable category includes items that are able to be eaten, drunk, or consumed via the mouth, such as tobacco (Unger, 2008:42).

|} (Unger, 2008:42)

'''Oral Consumable form:'''
:{|
| (7) || '''''gha-mu-a'''''|| ''na''|| ''vudi''|| ''lepa''
|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;oral.CLF-PS:2SG-O:3SG&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;ART&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;banana&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;ripe&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| ||colspan="4"| "[Here is a] ripe banana for you to eat."  
|} (Unger, 2008:44)
&lt;br /&gt;
'''General form:'''
:{|
| (8) || '''''ne'''''|| ''na''|| ''be''|| ''O.''
|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;PS:3SG&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;ART&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;pig&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;O&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| ||colspan="4"| "O's pig." 
|} (Unger, 2008:43)

====Reflexive Pronouns====
A [[reflexive pronoun]] is composed when a direct possessor suffix is added to the stem ''''tibo''''. This results in a [[valency (linguistics)|valency]] decrease of the verb (Unger, 2008:44).

'''Examples:'''
:{| 
| (9) || ''u toka'' || '''''tibo-gu'''.'' ||
|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;1SG cut&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;REFL-PS:1SG &lt;/small&gt;||
|-
| ||colspan="2"|"I cut myself."  
|} (Unger, 2008:45)
&lt;br /&gt;
:{| 
| (9) || ''u toka'' || ''na'' || ''ghai''
|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;1SG cut&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;ART&lt;/small&gt;|| &lt;small&gt;tree&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| ||colspan="3"|"I cut the tree."  
|}

====Interrogative and Relative Pronouns====
Lengo has two pronouns that have [[interrogative word|interrogative]] or [[relative pronoun|relative]] uses. ''''thi'''' is used if the reference is human, and ''''tha'''' if the reference is non-human (Unger, 2008:45).

'''Relative use:'''
:{| 
| (8) || ''na'' || ''tinoni'' || ''ketha'' || ''a''' thi''''' || ''ga'' || ''deni'' || ''ba'' || ''k-e'' || ''mai'' || ''lau-a'' || ''pile-a'' || ''na'' || ''vanga'' || ''de''
|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;ART&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;person&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;different&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;ART REL&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;there&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;DEM&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;FUT&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;IRR-3SG&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;come&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;take-o:3SG&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;little.bit-o:3SG&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;ART&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;food&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;DEM&lt;/small&gt;||
|-
| ||colspan="10"| "a different person who is over there will come take a bit of this food." 
|} (Unger, 2008:45)
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Interrogative use:'''
:{| 
| (9) || ''na'' || '''''tha''''' || ''t-o'' || ''goni-a?''
|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;ART&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;INT&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;RL-3SG&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;do-o:3SG&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| ||colspan="4"|"What are you doing?"
|} (Unger, 2008:46)

== Orthography and literature ==
Lotha is written in the [[Latin script]], introduced by the British and American missionaries in the late 19th century. It is a medium of education up to the post-graduate level in the state of Nagaland. It is also the language in which the church sermons are preached. The [[Bible]] has been translated into the Lotha language, adding significantly to its vocabulary, which had an influence of [[Assamese language|Assamese]] and [[Hindi]]. The language has been carried to all parts of the country by the waves of emigrants.

==History==
The Massachusetts Society for Promoting Agriculture was established to promote the study and experimentation of agricultural endeavors. The M.S.P.A. historically has given handsome premiums to individuals who made useful discoveries in the field and communicated these improvements to the general public.

===Premiums===
The first premiums (prizes) offered by the MSPA were $50 for "the most satisfactory account of the natural history of the canker-worm" and $100 for the cheapest and most effective method of eradicating it. Premiums were also offered for the cultivation of wheat and other grains; the improvement of land, including the reclamation of salt marshes; the raising of trees; the greatest stock maintained on the least land; the best vegetable food for wintering stock; the most and best wool from a given number of sheep; the best process for making cider, maple sugar, butter, cheese, flax, and salted provisions; and for the best farm journals, manures, tree plantations, advances in ploughs and ploughing techniques, and farms in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.promotingmassag.org/history.php|title=Massachusetts Society for Promoting Agriculture History.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Milko Kos''' (12 December 1892 &amp;ndash; 24 March 1972) was a [[Slovenia]]n [[historian]], considered the father of the [[Ljubljana school of historiography]].

He was born in the town of [[Gorizia]] (then part of [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], now in [[Italy]]), where his father, the renowned [[medievalist]] [[Franc Kos]], taught at the [[Gymnasium (school)|State Gymnasium]]. His mother was a [[Friuli]]an from [[Gorizia and Gradisca]]. His younger brother [[Anton Gojmir Kos]] later became a prominent painter.

He studied history at the [[University of Vienna]], specializing in the social history of the [[middle ages]]. He was an expert on medieval settlement patterns in the [[Slovene Lands]]. He also wrote about the social history of medieval towns and issues related to early [[History of Slovenia|Slovenian history]], including the [[Slavs|Slavic]] principality of [[Carantania]] and the [[Freising manuscripts]].

In 1928, he started teaching at the [[University of Ljubljana]], where he replaced [[Ljudmil Hauptmann]] as the head of the chair for Slovene history. In this position, he influenced almost all Slovenian historians of the post-World War II period; most of them graduated under his direct supervision, including [[Fran Zwitter]] and [[Bogo Grafenauer]].

Between 1941 and 1945, Kos served as the [[Chancellor (education)|chancellor]] of the University of Ljubljana. During the difficult period of Italian and Nazi German occupation of Slovenia, Kos maintained an underground connection with the [[Liberation Front of the Slovenian People]].

After the war, he became a member of the [[Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts]]. In 1955, he received the [[Prešeren Award]], the highest recognition for cultural achievements in Slovenia, for his work on the land registers in the [[Slovenian Littoral]].

He died in [[Ljubljana]].

The [[Milko Kos Historical Institute]] of Ljubljana is named after him.

'''''Morena Clara''''' is a [[1954 in film|1954 film]] directed by [[Luis Lucia]] starring [[Lola Flores]] and [[Fernando Fernán Gómez]].

==Plot==
The film begins by depicting the fabled tale of how the gypsies came to be. According to folklore gypsies are descendants of an Egyptian pharaoh. In the film, actors are dressed in ancient Egyptian costumes as they dance to flamenco music. As the story continues, the gypsies are run out of their lands and are forced to live nomadic lives, stealing and thieving as a means to survive. The [[Monty Python]]esque history lesson then continues to present the protagonists’ ancestors and the scene that drives the rest of the film: Trinidad’s (Lola Flores) ancestor places a spell on Enrique’s ([[Fernando Fernán Gómez]]) ancestor that will cause his descendant to fall in madly in love with her descendant.

The story continues to the present day, that is to say the 1950s, where Trinidad and her uncle Regalito (Miguel Ligero) are charged with stealing six hams from a shop window. This scene presents some of the most entertaining banter in the entire film as Trinidad and Regalito argue their innocence with very matter-of-fact language and mannerisms common to Andalusian gypsies. Their witty mockery, while creating uproars of laughter from the courtroom audience, causes the judges to grow more infuriated with the pair. It is then that Enrique, a lawyer, steps in to defend Trinidad and Regalito. After much deliberation, the two gypsies, after having to pay a fee, are set free.

The fee they are required to pay forces Trinidad to find employment. Coincidentally, she finds a job as a maid in Seville at the home of Enrique, the lawyer. Instead of dismissing Trinidad, Enrique decides to make her part of an experiment he plans to conduct. His experiment is to see if he can turn Trinidad from a thieving gypsy into a functioning member of Spanish society. He plans to track change in his [[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]-like experiment by playing a song and seeing how she reacts to it. The more refined she becomes, the less she should react to the folkloric music. Trinidad’s reaction to Enrique’s statement, while humorous, presents the moral of the story: she tells him that the spirit of a gypsy is something that no one can tame and that, even though she will try because he has asked her to do this for him, it is an impossible task. Fitted with new, modern clothing, Trinidad’s reaction to the music is a romping performance full of beautiful arm movements and earth-shaking stomps.&lt;ref name="Morena Clara"&gt;{{YouTube|HU3e9MRSexo|Morena Clara}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trinidad’s performance is so spell binding that, not only is Enrique entranced, but her impromptu tune is so catchy that he hums along to it the very next morning.

As the months go by, Enrique’s experiment grows more futile as Trinidad’s charisma wins him over. As Enrique’s coworker sees how entranced he has become by her, he plots to convince Trinidad to leave with the pretense that Enrique’s career might be jeopardized by her presence in his household. Trinidad instantly decides to leave as the last thing she wants to do is hurt Enrique. She makes the decision to say goodbye to him by performing a song dedicated to him. In an emotionally driven performance, Trinidad performs a powerful rendition of “Te Lo Juro Yo,”&lt;ref name="Te Lo Juro Yo"&gt;{{YouTube|6oLZ62z4RHo|Te Lo Juro Yo}}&lt;/ref&gt; quickly leaving as soon as the song is done.

In the end, Enrique tracks down Trinidad and declares his love for her.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3738">The '''New York Declaration on Forests''' is a voluntary and non-legally binding political declaration which grew out of dialogue among governments, companies and civil society, spurred by the [[United Nations]] [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General’s]] [[Climate Summit]] held in [[New York City|New York]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/climatechange/summit/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/07/New-York-Declaration-on-Forests_19May2014.pdf |format=PDF |title=Forests: Action Statements and Action Plans |publisher=Un.org |accessdate=2015-06-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171207232400/https://www.un.org/climatechange/summit/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/07/New-York-Declaration-on-Forests_19May2014.pdf |archivedate=2017-12-07 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Declaration pledges to halve the rate of [[deforestation]] by 2020, to end it by 2030, and to restore hundreds of millions of acres of [[Land degradation|degraded land]]. The proposed land restoration is described as covering "an area larger than [[India]]".

A voluntary Action Agenda accompanies the Declaration, providing "a guide to governments, companies, and organizations regarding the diverse set of actions that can achieve [the Declaration's] transformational goals".

A [[Washington DC|Washington]]-based consulting firm, Climate Advisers, wrote the draft of the Declaration. It has been signed by 37 governments, 20 sub-national governments, 53 multi-national companies, 16 groups representing [[Indigenous community|indigenous communities]] and 63 [[non-government organisations]].

The Declaration has been generally welcomed. The governments of Germany, Norway and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland issued a joint statement strongly supporting the declaration, and committing their governments to "strengthening existing and creating new partnerships with forest countries designing green growth strategies, with leading private sector companies taking deforestation out of their supply chains, and with the financial sector, [[civil society]] and other donor governments to align incentives, transform markets and tip the balance against forest destruction",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/joint-statement-on-redd |title=Joint statement on REDD+ |publisher=GOV.UK |date=2014-09-23 |accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with a financial commitment to fund up to 20 new programmes subject to robust, credible proposals being put forward by developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/renewed-support-to-reduce-emissions-through-protecting-the-worlds-forests |title=Renewed support to reduce emissions through protecting the world’s forests - Press releases |publisher=GOV.UK |date=2014-09-23 |accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some non-governmental organisations have also highlighted the limitations of the Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lang |first=Chris |url=http://www.redd-monitor.org/2014/09/26/the-new-york-declaration-on-forests-an-agreement-to-continue-deforestation-until-2030/ |title=The New York Declaration on Forests: An agreement to continue deforestation until 2030 |publisher=REDD-Monitor.org |date= |accessdate=2015-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/media-center/news-releases/Greenpeace-New-York-Declaration-on-forests-commitments-are-welcome-but-immediate-action-is-needed/ |title=“New York Declaration” on forests commitments are welcome, but immediate action is needed |publisher=Greenpeace.org |date=2014-09-23 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9526">'''Paezan''' (also '''Páesan''', '''Paezano''', '''Interandine''') may be any of several [[Hypothesis|hypothetical]] or obsolete [[language family|language-family]] [[History of the State of Palestine|proposals]] of [[Colombia]] and [[Ecuador]] named after the [[Paez language]].

==Proposals==

Currently, [[Páez language|Páez]] (Nasa Yuwe) is best considered either a [[language isolate]] or the only surviving member of an otherwise [[extinct language|extinct]] [[language family]] (Adelaar &amp; Muysken 2004, Gordon 2005, Matteson 1972, Fabre 2005). It has often been grouped with other languages in a ''Paezan'' family, but several of these proposals are based on a historical error. Even before the discovery of the error, Campbell (1997: 173) stated, "There is no consensus upon Paezan, and opinions vary greatly".

===Páez, Panzaleo, Andaquí===
{{Infobox language family
 |name     = Paezan
 |acceptance=hypothetical / obsolete
 |region   = [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]]
 |familycolor = American
 |family   = Proposed language family
 |child1   = ''[[Paez language|Paez]]''
 |child2   = ''[[Panzaleo language|Panzaleo]]''
 |child3   = ''[[Andaquí language|Andaquí]]
 |glotto   = none
}}

One of the most often repeated statements (e.g. Loukota 1968; Kaufman 1990, 1994) is the supposed connection between Páez and the extinct [[Panzaleo]] (also known as Pansaleo, Latacunga, or Quito), formerly spoken in [[highland (geography)|highlands]] of [[Ecuador]]. However, Panzaleo is poorly [[document|documented]] and the [[evidence]] for this relationship is weak and may be from [[language contact]]. Thus, Panzaleo may best be considered an [[unclassified language|unclassified]] isolate (Adelaar &amp; [[Pieter Muysken|Muysken]] 2004: 393-397; Campbell 1997).

The [[Andaquí]] isolate (also extinct) is often connected with Páez in a Paezan grouping. Documentation is a 20-page list of words and expressions by an anonymous author published in 1928 and another word list collected in 1854 by a priest (Manuel María Albis). There are a number of similarities in vocabulary between Andaquí and Páez. In other aspects, the differences are greater.

===Páez and Coconucan===
{{Infobox language family
 |name     = Paez–Coconucan
 |acceptance=spurious
 |region   = [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]]
 |familycolor = American
 |family   = Proposed language family
 |child1   = ''[[Paez language|Paez]]–[[Panzaleo language|Panzaleo]]''
 |child2   = ''[[Andaquí language|Andaquí]]
 |child3   = [[Coconucan languages|Coconucan]]
 |glotto   = none
}}
The [[Coconucan]] languages were first grouped together with Páez by Henri Beuchat &amp; Paul Rivet in 1910 (under a larger ''Chibchan'' family, which is considerably more inclusive than the conservative [[Chibchan]] recognized today). Curnow (1998) shows this is based on misinterpretation of a ''Moguex'' [[vocabulary]] of Douay (1888), which is a mix of [[Páez language|Páez]] and Guambiano/Totoró. The error has led to subsequent classifiers (e.g. Kaufman 1990, 1994; Campbell 1997; [[Joseph Greenberg|Greenberg]] 1956, 1987; Tovar &amp; Larruceau de Tovar 1984) to group Páez with Guambiano, missing the obvious identification of Coconucan as [[Barbacoan languages|Barbacoan]].

Matteson's 1972 comparison of Páez and Guambiano vocabularies show just a 5.2% overlap, less than comparisons between Páez and [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]], [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] and Proto-[[Chibchan]] (respectively 17%, 12%, and 14%). Following [[Linguistics|linguists]] such as Matteson (1972), Curnow (1998), Curnow &amp; Liddicoat (1998), and Adelaar &amp; Muysken (2004), the Coconucan languages are now placed under [[Barbacoan languages|Barbacoan]]. The question of connections between Páez, Panzaleo, and Andaquí remains open.

===Paez and Otomanguean===
Jolkesky (2017) argues for a connection, perhaps genetic, with the [[Otomanguean languages]] of the Pacific coast of central Mexico, especially with the [[Zapotecan languages|Zapotecan]] branch, and for a possible Otomanguean substratum in a couple families neighboring Paez. The proposal has not been peer-reviewed.

===More distant relations===
{{main|Macro-Paesan languages}}
Prior to Curnow's correction, the Paez–Coconucan "family" had been connected to various other families. Greenberg included Paezan in a ''[[Macro-Chibchan]]'' (or ''Chibchan–Paezan'') stock with [[Barbacoan languages|Barbacoan]], [[Chibchan languages|Chibchan]], [[Choco languages|Chocoan]], [[Jirajaran languages|Jirajaran]], and the isolates [[Betoi language|Betoi]], [[Kamsá language|Kamsá]] (Sibundoy), [[Yaruro language|Yaruro]], [[Esmeraldeño language|Esmeraldeño]], [[Mochica language|Mochica]], [[Cunza language|Cunza]] (Atacameño), [[Itonama language|Itonama]], and [[Yurumangui language|Yurumanguí]]. [[Morris Swadesh]]'s ''Paezan'' included Páez, Barbacoan, Coconucan, Andaquí, Cunza, [[Kapixana language|Kapixana]], and [[Mashubi language|Mashubí]]. Kaufman's (1990, 1994) ''[[Macro-Paesan languages|Macro-Páesan "cluster"]]'' proposal included "Paesan" (as explained above)–Barbacoan, Cunza–Kapixana, Betoi, Itonama, and [[Warao language|Warao]].

'''Palestinians in Iraq''' are people of [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] ancestry, most of whom have been residing in [[Iraq]] after they were expelled from their homeland in [[Nakba|1948]].&lt;ref name=PalestiniansInIraq&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fmreview.org/FMRpdfs/FMR26/FMR2609.pdf |title=Palestinians in Iraq |accessdate=14 August 2007 |publisher=fmreview.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 2003, there were approximately 34,000 Palestinians thought to be living in Iraq, mainly concentrated in Baghdad. However, since the 2003 [[Iraq War]], the figure lies between 10,000–13,000, although a precise figure has been hard to determine.&lt;ref name="refugeesinternational.org"&gt;http://www.refugeesinternational.org/policy/field-report/iraqs-displaced-stable-region-requires-stable-assistance&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE14/012/2008/en/9883f134-0a09-11dd-badf-1352a91852c5/mde140122008e%22Al|title=Error - Amnesty International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sassoon, Joseph 2011. p. 75"&gt;Sassoon, Joseph.

==History==
The birth of the Palestinian community in modern Iraq dates back to 1948, when the Iraqi army, which had been fighting in Palestine, returned to Baghdad with a group of Palestinians who had been forced to flee their homes in Haifa and Jaffa.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/node/11181/section/2|title=Nowhere to Flee: the perilous situation of Palestinians in Iraq|accessdate=28 February 2011 |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some Palestinian villagers had been forcibly drafted by the invading Iraqi army, and they and their families were allowed to resettle in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/palestinian-refugees-in-iraq-to-be-relocated-to-scandinavia-1.251104|title=Palestinian refugees in Iraq to be relocated to Scandinavia|work=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Six-Day War|1967 war with Israel]], a second larger wave of Palestinians sought refuge in Iraq.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch"/&gt; The third and final wave occurred in 1991 after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, when those Palestinians living in Kuwait fled.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch"/&gt; Over the years, there were also many Palestinians who came to Iraq in search of work. Prior to 2003, there were approximately 25,000 registered Palestinian refugees living in Iraq.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;Younes, Kristele.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VahBAl8FKeU], Refugees International, 27 June 2007, accessed on 21 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
In December 2010, approximately 10,000 Palestinians remained in Iraq, the majority of whom were living in and around Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Elizabeth.[http://www.refugeesinternational.org/policy/field-report/iraqs-displaced-stable-region-requires-stable-assistance "Iraq's Displaced: A Stable Region Requires Stable Assistance"], Refugees International, 16 February 2011, accessed on 17 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Under Saddam Hussein===
[[Image:palestinians inIraq.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Palestinians in Iraq]]
Iraq is not a signatory of the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the protection of refugees. Palestinians were never awarded official status by the Iraqi authorities, but were given a degree of protection and assistance by the Iraqi government, guided by the Casablanca Protocol of the League of Arab States in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,MULTILATERALTREATY,DZA,,460a2b252,0.html%22Protocol|title=UNHCR - Document Not Found|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|last=Refugees|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Saddam Hussein’s rule, Palestinians received by and large equitable treatment.{{fact|date=September 2017}} They were granted residency permits, full access to government services including healthcare and education, and were also permitted to work.{{fact|date=September 2017}} The government also issued special travel documents for Palestinian refugees, allowing them to travel freely around Iraq but making it extremely difficult to leave the country.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch"/&gt; Some political and sectarian entities claim that Palestinians were treated favourably under the Ba'thist regime.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt; The government built special housing complexes, and provided heavily subsidized accommodation for Palestinians.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch"/&gt; Palestinians were also exempt from military service, and scholarships were also awarded to Palestinian students, enabling them to study at certain universities.&lt;ref name="hrw.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/node/11181/section/2|title=Nowhere to Flee: the perilous situation of Palestinians in Iraq|accessdate =28 February 2011|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the years of economic sanctions in the 1990s, the Iraqi government froze rent prices, forcing Iraqi landlords to rent their apartments to Palestinians for as little as $1 per month.  This was also a cause of resentment among those Iraqis toward Palestinians.&lt;ref name="hrw.org"/&gt;

===During the UN Sanctions on Iraq===
The Palestinians suffered very much as a result of the UN sanctions on Iraq (1990–2003). Saddam Hussein's Revolution Command Council decided that Palestinians must not be allowed to invest in companies and not be allowed to invest into any kind of entrepreneurial businesses. They had to obtain special permissions to marry Iraqis and Palestinians who had Iraqi mothers could not inherit their mothers. Palestinians were not allowed to live in areas close to international boundaries and were not allowed to work in security sensitive areas. The Palestinians were also trapped inside Iraq because of the UN sanctions did not allow air travel to and from Iraq and because Iraq's neighbours did not allow the Palestinians to enter their countries.

Palestinians were also only allowed to join the regime-backed the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Ba'ath Party]]  and were not allowed to join the traditional Palestinian political organisations.

==Persecution in post–war Iraq==
After the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime in April 2003, Palestinians in Iraq were subject to discrimination, sectarian violence{{fact|date=September 2017}} and ruthless killing by the Iraqi government{{fact|date=September 2017}} and various militia groups.{{fact|date=September 2017}} Palestinian neighborhoods such as al-Doura, al-Hurriyya and al-Baladiyyat in Baghdad were also bombarded and attacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-awdacal.org/iraq-facts.htmlFactsheet:Palestinian|title=refugees in Iraq|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report by the UNHCR in 2007 provided details of the violence and persecution perpetrated against Palestinians in Iraq, which included abductions, attacks, torture by both unknown militia groups and the Iraqi Ministry of the Interior and the deaths of many Palestinian women, men and children.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unhcr.no/Pdf/Position_countryinfo_2007/Iraq%20guidelines.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governmental policies===
Under the newly elected Iraqi government, Palestinians were stripped of their residency permits and made to register at the Ministry of the Interior each month.{{fact|date=September 2017}} This has proven extremely dangerous, and the fear of being shot upon entering or leaving the ministry has deterred many Palestinians from obtaining their right to residency in Iraq.{{fact|date=September 2017}} In addition, Human Rights Watch reported that Ministry of Interior officials have arbitrarily arrested, beaten, tortured, and in a few cases, forcibly disappeared Palestinian refugees.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch"/&gt;

===Bombing of the Al-Askari Mosque===
After the bombing of the [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslim]] [[Al-Askari Mosque]] in the city of Samarra, circumstances of those Palestinians living in Iraq worsened considerably as they became scapegoats, synonymous with "terrorists" and "insurgents".{{fact|date=September 2017}} Human Rights Watch reported that in mid-March, an unknown militia group calling itself the "Judgment Day Brigades" distributed leaflets in Palestinian neighborhoods, accusing the Palestinians of collaborating with the insurgents and stating the following: "We warn that we will eliminate you all if you do not leave this area for good within ten days." [[Marja'|Grand Ayatollah]] [[Ali al-Sistani]] issued a [[fatwa]] in April 2006, forbidding any attacks on Palestinians. However, the mass of killings and death threats put the Palestinian community in a "state of shock" and forced thousands to leave the country, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch"/&gt;

==Palestinians fleeing Iraq==
[[File:Karamadoor.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Karamadoor]]
After 2003, the majority of Palestinians were either killed or fled to the neighbouring countries of Syria and Jordan – neither of which is a signatory to the 1951 Geneva Convention, although each country adheres to the 1965 Casablanca Protocol without reservation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,MULTILATERALTREATY,DZA,,460a2b252,0.html "Protocol for the Treatment of Palestinians in Arab States, Casablanca Protocol", accessed on March 12th 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the admirable generosity and hospitality of Syria and Jordan towards thousands of Iraqis, and their large and well-integrated populations of Palestinians, both countries have closed their borders to Palestinians coming from Iraq.  As a result, many have been left stranded in squalid conditions within border camps such as [[Al-Waleed (camp)|Al-Waleed]] or Al-Karama, both of which are situated in ‘No Man’s Land’ near to the borders shared with Syria and Jordan. Others have had no choice but to return to cities of Baghdad and Mosul. In 2007, UNHCR published ‘Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Iraqi Asylum-Seekers’, which stated that many Arab refugees (including Palestinians) “…do not hold valid documentation, limiting their freedom of movement, access to services and putting them at risk of detention and possibly refoulement. As such, in adjudicating the refugee claims of individuals who were previously refugees in Iraq, it should be noted that the current situation in Iraq is such that “effective protection” in the country is generally unavailable.”&lt;ref&gt;‘Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Iraqi Asylum-Seekers’, UNHCR (Geneva 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jordan===
[[Image:Palestinian Iraqi IDP girls with clothesline.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Palestinian girls stranded near the Iraqi-Jordanian border]]
Jordan has the largest number of refugees relative to total population in the world, and is host to the highest number of Palestinian refugees under the mandate of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA).  The 1952 Jordanian Constitution does forbid the extradition of ‘political refugees…on account of their political beliefs or their defence of liberty'.&lt;ref&gt;Sassoon, Joseph. The Iraqi Refugees: The New Crisis in the Middle East, Paperback Edition. I.B. Tauris, 2011., p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the government signed a Memorandum of Understanding with UNHCR in 1998, underlining its agreement to the definition of a refugee and the obligation of [[non-refoulement]].&lt;ref name="PDFViewer 2010"&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home/opendocPDFViewer.html?docid=4cd96bfc9&amp;query=refugee%20camp%20jordan "UNHCR 2011 Global Appeal for Jordan"] UNHCR, December 2010, accessed on 4 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Historically, the Jordanian government has granted full citizenship to the vast majority of Palestinian refugees, while UNRWA administers aid and provides health and education services to those living in refugee camps.&lt;ref&gt;Sassoon, Joseph. The Iraqi Refugees: The New Crisis in the Middle East, Paperback Edition. I.B. Tauris, 2011., p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;  Its policies towards Iraqis have been less clear.  Currently, the government estimates that 450,000 – 500,000 Iraqis live in Jordan, although only 31,000 of these Iraqis are registered with UNHCR.&lt;ref name="PDFViewer 2010"/&gt; The regime has followed the principles of Arab hospitality and brotherhood by opening its doors to thousands of Iraqis; yet its policies towards them with regard to provision of basic services have been less clear. Moreover, it has preferred to use ‘visitor’ or ‘guest’ when referring to Iraqis, avoiding the socially and politically loaded term ‘refugee’ and the subsequent need to establish more permanent arrangements, services and solutions that would strain Jordanian infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;Sassoon, Joseph. 1he Iraqi Refugees: The New Crisis in the Middle East, Paperback Edition. I.B. Tauris, 2011., p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;  The situation for Palestinians from Iraq fleeing to Jordan after 2003 following the invasion of Iraq is yet more difficult. Aside from a few with family connections inside Jordan, the majority of Palestinians were refused entry or free movement inside the country. Thus, many were stranded in No Man’s Land between Iraq and Jordan, or detained in Al-Raweished Camp within Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/4d19a5199.html "Non-Iraqi refugees in Jordan"] UNHCR, 20 February 2007, accessed on 3 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====Al Ruweished Camp====
[[File:Palestinian Iraqi IDP family near Jordanian border.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Palestinian Iraqi IDP family near Jordanian border]]
Al Ruweished was located in Eastern Jordan, 60 kilometres from the border with Iraq. Over the years, those living in the camp have included Palestinians from Iraq, Iranian Kurds, Somalis and Sudanese. In December 2003, Angelina Jolie visited the camp by helicopter, and kept a journal of her experiences.  She reported that most of the 500 residents of al-Ruweished were Palestinians, and over 100 of them were under the age of 16.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home/opendocPDFViewer.html?docid=4a07ee4a6&amp;query=al%20ruweished "Angelina Jolie's Jordan Journal] UNHCR, 10 December 2003, accessed on 6 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Living conditions in the camp were extremely difficult, with soaring temperatures during the summer months, and storms during the harsh winters.&lt;ref name="PDFViewer 2010"/&gt; The UNHCR and local NGOs provided food and assistance to camp residents. However, most children were unable to access education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al-awda.org/alert-iraq.html "Palestinians Stranded on Iraq Border"], Al Awda, accessed 7 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2003, more than a thousand people have been resettled to third countries, including 54 Palestinians who were granted asylum in Canada in November 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Ziadah, Rafeef [http://electronicintifada.net/v2/article6655.shtml "Palestinian Refugees of Iraq", March 11th 2007. accessed March 7th 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; and 107 Palestinians who were accepted by Brazil in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;UNHCR Jordan’s Ruweished camp empty as last family leaves (5 November 2007) http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/news/opendoc.htm?tbl=NEWS&amp;id=472f38be4&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in November that year, the remaining residents (all of whom were Palestinian) were resettled in the states of São Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil.  There, they were promised rented accommodation, furniture and material aid for up to two years, as moral support from volunteers in the communities, who were to help them with local integration.&lt;ref&gt;UNHCR Jordan’s Ruweished camp empty as last family leaves (5 November 2007)http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/news/opendoc.htm?tbl=NEWS&amp;id=472f38be4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syria===
There has been a significant Palestinian presence in Syria since the first arrivals in 1948, as well as several hundred thousand Iraqis in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/page?page=49e486a76, " 2011 UNHCR Country Operations Profile – Syrian Arab Republic"], accessed on 5 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a Fafo report in 2007, “Palestinian refugees have been better integrated into Syrian society than in Jordan”&lt;ref&gt;Tiltnes, Åge A., Keeping Up: A Brief on Living Conditions of Palestinian Refugees in Syria (Fafo 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Jordan, Palestinians living in Syria have not been granted citizenship. Aside from Syrian nationality and the right to vote, Palestinians are entitled to “…the same civil rights and services as those enjoyed by local citizens, and are more socially integrated than Palestinian refugees in any other host country.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Sari Hanafi]] in Are Knudsen and Sari Hanafi, Palestinian Refugees: Identity, space and place in the Levant (New York: Routledge, 2011), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to Jordan, Syria has not signed the 1951 Convention, but is party to the 1965 Casablanca Protocol for the protection of Palestinian refugees.  The 1973 constitution does not allow for the deportation of refugees because of their 'political principles or defence of freedom', although the government does not have a procedure for granting asylum.&lt;ref&gt;Sassoon, Joseph. The Iraqi Refugees: The New Crisis in the Middle East, Paperback Edition. I.B. Tauris, 2011., p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;   The Syrian Ministry of Social Affairs also shares a Memorandum of Understanding with UNHCR, allowing for assistance and cooperation with local organizations to provide aid to refugees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/page?page=49e486a76, " 2011 UNHCR Country Operations Profile –Syrian Arab Republic"], accessed on 5 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

After such a history of providing shelter and services for Palestinian and Iraqi refugees, it is therefore unclear as to why the Syrian government has refused entry to Palestinians coming from Iraq since 2006.&lt;ref name="Sassoon, Joseph 2011. p. 75"/&gt;

====Al Tanf Camp====
Al-Tanf Camp was a makeshift camp located on the Syrian side of the border with Iraq.  It was first opened in 2006, when 389 Iraqi-Palestinians were refused entry by the Syrian authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE14/012/2008/en/9883f134-0a09-11dd-badf-1352a91852c5/mde140122008e "Al Tanf Camp: Trauma Continues for Palestinians Fleeing Iraq] Amnesty International, April 2008, accessed on 7 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; UNHCR representatives envisioned that the camp would be open for a matter of weeks, but weeks turned into years, despite unbearable living standards.&lt;ref name="Witness: Leaving Al Tanf"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP6lBwBhsGc "Witness: Leaving Al Tanf"] Al Jazeera, February 2010, accessed on 21 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Numbers within the camp continued to increase, as those Palestinians from Iraq arriving in Syria using forged documents were discovered by the Syrian authorities.  During the period from March 2006 until the day of its closure in 2010, it hosted over 1,300 Iraqi-Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/photo_galleries/middleeast/2010318132024701812.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Living conditions in Al-Tanf were extremely grim, with residents exposed to the harsh climate of the desert.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.aljazeera.net/photo_galleries/middleeast/2010318132024701812.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Extreme temperatures, sandstorms, strong winds and devastating&lt;ref name="unhcr.org"/&gt; were endured by residents, as well as infestations of scorpions and vermin.&lt;ref name="Witness: Leaving Al Tanf"/&gt; Outbreaks of fire were also a common occurrence in Al Tanf and other camps, due to the highly flammable canvas tents.  A pregnant woman was killed there in January 2009, when the tent she was staying in caught fire.&lt;ref&gt;Garai, Romola &amp; Khalil, Mustafa.[https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2009/mar/19/syria-refugees-romola-garai "Romola Garai Visits Al Tanf"] The Guardian, 20 March 2009, accessed on 28 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Some residents of the camp established an amateur television network called ''Al Tanf Media Group'', to draw attention to their suffering, and to occupy younger residents of the camp and to provide them with opportunities to acquire skills. Using a computer and a small digital camera, they were able to produce short documentaries and organize screenings within the camp.  These films were distributed over the internet, and to delegations from international organizations visiting the camps.&lt;ref name="Witness: Leaving Al Tanf"/&gt;

On 1 February 2010, UNHCR closed the camp and moved the last remaining 60 residents to Al Hol camp, where it was said they would live temporarily before being resettled to third countries.&lt;ref name="unhcr.org"/&gt;

====Al Hol Camp====
Al Hol remains open to this day, and is located in the north-eastern province of Hassakeh around 55&amp;nbsp;km from the city of
[[Deir ez-Zor]].,&lt;ref name="unhcr.org"/&gt; close to the border with Iraq. The camp first opened in 1991, to cope with the influx of Iraqi refugees from the [[Gulf War]].  It reopened in 2005 in response to the Palestinians fleeing Iraq. Currently, there are 45 families living in the camp without news of resettlement in the near future.&lt;ref name="un.org.sy"&gt;http://www.un.org.sy/gallery/&lt;/ref&gt; As a result,UNRWA and UNHCR have begun to work with residents of the camp to provide them with more permanent arrangements.  Children of the camp attend school with Syrian children in the nearby village of Al Hol, men grow crops to provide additional food, the UNHCR provides basic education, health and recreational facilities within the camp;&lt;ref name="un.org.sy"/&gt; and vocational training schemes for women have been established by the International Organization of Migration in partnership with the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iom.int/jahia/Jahia/media/press-briefing-notes/pbnAF/cache/offonce/lang/en?entryId=29139&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resettlement==
Resettlement continues to evade thousands of Iraqi-Palestinians, living as IDPs in Iraq or refugees in squalid border camps.  However, there has been progress - particularly for those living in the border camps in Iraq, Syria and Jordan. At the end of 2009, 61 residents of Al-Tanf camp were given permission to settle in Italy,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP6lBwBhsG&lt;/ref&gt; and out of the 1,300 Iraqi-Palestinian residents who had been stranded in the camp, more than 1000 were relocated to third countries; including Belgium, Chile, Finland, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="unhcr.org"/&gt; In 2009, the United States also allowed more than a thousand Iraqi Palestinians from camps inside Iraq to be resettled within its borders.  This was the largest ever Palestinian refugee resettlement in U.S. history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jta.org/news/article/2009/07/08/1006395/iraqi-palestinians-to-be-resettled-in-us#When:14:24:00Z "Iraqi Palestinians to be resettled in U.S."] ''[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency|JTA]]''.  8 July 2009.  8 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the State Department decision to resettle this group of Palestinians objected that they were sympathizers of Saddam Hussein.&lt;ref name="JPost_US_resettle"&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1246443761006 "US to resettle 1,350 Palestinians from Iraq."] ''[[Jerusalem Post]]''. 9 July 2009. 9 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2009, the united efforts of the not for profit company, [[Australian Society for Palestinian Iraqi Refugees Emergency]] (ASPIRE), and Amnesty International-Australia led to the Australian government approving 16 families making up 68 people from Al Hol for humanitarian refugee status.

==Durable solutions and the current situation==
In February 2010, the UNHCR pledged to ''"continue to advocate a dignified solution for all those Palestinian refugees stranded in camps"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/4b67064c|title=UNHCR - Document Not Found|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|last=Refugees|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of March 2011, a few thousand Iraqi-Palestinians were thought to be living illegally in Damascus without access to services.  Moreover, several hundred Palestinians remained in [[Al-Waleed (camp)|Al Waleed]] and Al Hol camps, without immediate hope of resettlement in third countries.&lt;ref name="refugeesinternational.org"/&gt; In the Summer of 2014 at least 85 Palestinian refugees, mainly from [[Mosul]], took shelter at Khazir IDP camp and later Baharka IDP camp, near [[Erbil]], fleeing the Islamic State in Iraq and Levant during the Northern Iraq Offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/02/isil-forces-iraq-palestinians-flee-150223063402422.html|title=ISIL forces Iraq’s Palestinians to flee again|work=[[Al Jazeera English]] | author=Khalel, Sheren|author2=Vickery, Matthew|date=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Patuxet''' were a Native American band of the [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]] tribal confederation. They lived primarily in and around modern-day [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]].  The Patuxet have been extinct since 1622.

==Devastation==

The Patuxet were wiped out by a series of [[pandemic|plagues]] that decimated the indigenous peoples of southeastern [[New England]] in the second decade of the 17th century. The epidemics which swept across New England and the [[Canadian Maritimes]] between 1614 and 1620 were especially devastating to the Wampanoag and neighboring [[Massachuset]], with [[Mortality rate|mortality]] reaching 100% in many mainland villages. When the [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] landed in 1620, all the Patuxet except [[Squanto]] had died.&lt;ref name="wampanoag history"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tolatsga.org/wampa.html | title=Wampanoag History | accessdate=30 November 2008 | work=[http://www.tolatsga.org/Compacts.html First Nations Histories] | last=Sultzman | first=Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The plagues have been attributed variously to [[smallpox]],&lt;ref name="mahalo"&gt;http://www.mahalo.com/Wampanoag_Tribe ''Mahalo.com''{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[leptospirosis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Marr JS, Cathey JT |title=New hypothesis for cause of an epidemic among Native Americans, New England, 1616–1619 |journal=Emerg Infect Dis |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=281–6 |date=February 2010 |doi=10.3201/eid1602.090276 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/16/2/281.htm |pmid=20113559 |pmc=2957993}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Webster N |title=A brief history of epidemic and pestilential diseases |publisher=[[Hudson and Goodwin]] |location=Hartford CT |year=1799 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uen8dansteEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Williams H |title=The epidemic of the Indians of New England, 1616–1620, with remarks on Native American infections |journal=Johns Hopkins Hospital Bulletin |volume=20 |pages=340–9 |year=1909 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bratton TL |title=The identity of the New England Indian epidemic of 1616–19 |journal=Bull Hist Med |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=351–83 |year=1988 |pmid=3067787 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Speiss A, Speiss BD |title=New England pandemic of 1616–1622. cause and archeological implication |journal=Man in the Northeast |volume=34 |pages=71–83 |year=1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The last Patuxet==
{{see also|Squanto}}
Some [[Europe]]an expedition captains were known to increase profits by capturing natives to sell as [[slavery|slave]]s. Such was the case when Thomas Hunt kidnapped several Wampanoag in 1614 in order to sell them later in [[Spain]]. One of Hunt's captives was a Patuxet named Tisquantum.  Tisquantum eventually came to be known as [[Squanto]] (a nickname given to him by his friend [[William Bradford (Plymouth Colony governor)|William Bradford]]). After Squanto regained his freedom, he was able to work his way to [[England]] where he lived for several years, working with a shipbuilder.

He signed on as an [[interpreter]] for a British expedition to [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. From there Squanto went back to his home, only to discover that, in his absence, epidemics had killed everyone in his village.&lt;ref name="wampanoag history"/&gt;

Squanto succumbed to "[[Indian fever]]" in November 1622.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archive.capecodonline.com/special/tribalrecog/wamptimeline.htm | title=A history of the Wampanoag | work=[http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/frontpage Cape Cod Online] | accessdate=30 November 2008 | date=16 February 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229220547/http://archive.capecodonline.com/special/tribalrecog/wamptimeline.htm | archivedate=29 December 2008 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With his death, the Patuxet people passed into history.

==The Pilgrims==
The first settlers of [[Plymouth Colony]] (modern [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]]), sited their colony at the location of a former Patuxet village, named "Port St. Louis" ([[Samuel de Champlain]], 1605) or "Accomack" ([[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]], 1614).  By 1616, the site had been renamed New Plimoth in Smith's ''[[A Description of New England]]'' after a suggestion by [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles]] of England.  When the Pilgrim Settlers decided to make their settlement, the land that had been cleared and cultivated by the prior inhabitants (since dead through disease) was a primary reason for the location.

Squanto was instrumental in the survival of the colony of English settlers at [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]]. [[Samoset]], a Pemaquid ([[Abenaki]]) [[sachem]] from [[Maine]], introduced himself to the Pilgrims upon their arrival in 1620. Shortly thereafter, he introduced Squanto (presumably because Squanto spoke better English) to the Pilgrims, who had settled at the site of Squanto's former village.&lt;ref name="wampanoag history"/&gt; From that point onward, Squanto devoted himself to helping the Pilgrims.  Whatever his motivations, with great kindness and patience, he taught the English the skills they needed to survive, including how best to cultivate varieties of the Three Sisters: beans, maize and squash.

Although Samoset appears to have been important in establishing initial relations with the Pilgrims, Squanto was undoubtedly the main factor in the Pilgrims' survival. In addition, he also served as an [[intermediary]] between the Pilgrims and [[Massasoit]], the [[Sachem|Grand Sachem]] of the Wampanoag (original name [[Ousamequin]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mayflowerfamilies.com/philip/d1.htm#P1 | title=Native People of Massachusetts | accessdate=30 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "Yellow Feather"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~mosmd/massasoit.htm | title=The Massasoit Ousa Mequin  |  year=2001 | last=Cline | first=Duane A. | work=[http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~mosmd/index.htm The Pilgrims and Plymouth Colony: 1620] | accessdate=30 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;). As such, he was instrumental in the friendship treaty that the two signed, allowing the settlers to occupy the area around the former Patuxet village.&lt;ref name="wampanoag history"/&gt;  Massasoit honored this treaty until his death in 1661.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mashpeewampanoagtribe.com/history.html | title=History &amp; Culture | work=[http://mashpeewampanoagtribe.com/index.html Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe] | date=23 June 2008 | accessdate=30 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thanksgiving==
In the fall of 1621, the Plymouth colonists and Wampanoag shared an autumn harvest feast. This three-day celebration involving the entire village and about 90 Wampanoag has been celebrated as a symbol of cooperation and interaction between English colonists and Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.history.com/minisite.do?content_type=Minisite_Generic&amp;content_type_id=872&amp;display_order=1&amp;mini_id=1083 | title=The First Thanksgiving | work=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] | accessdate=30 November 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225031630/http://www.history.com/minisite.do?content_type=Minisite_Generic&amp;content_type_id=872&amp;display_order=1&amp;mini_id=1083 | archivedate=25 February 2009 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The event later inspired 19th century Americans to establish [[Thanksgiving]] as a national holiday in the United States.
The harvest celebration took place at the historic site of the Patuxet villages. [[Squanto|Squanto's]] involvement as an intermediary in negotiating the friendship treaty with Massasoit led to the joint feast between the Pilgrims and Wampanoag. This feast was a celebration of the first successful harvest season of the colonists.&lt;ref name="wampanoag history"/&gt;

The '''Queensland Ornithological Society Inc''' ('''QOSI'''), also known as '''Birds Queensland''', was founded on 15 October 1969 when the [[Queensland]] branch of the [[Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union]] (RAOU) became defunct following drastic reform within the RAOU in the late 1960s.  The founding President was [[James David Macdonald (ornithologist)|J.D. Macdonald]].  It publishes a quarterly journal, ''[[Sunbird (journal)|Sunbird]]'', as well as a monthly newsletter, ''[[Queensland Bird Notes]]''.  Its aims are “to promote the scientific study and conservation of birds by all means possible, with particular reference to the birds of Queensland”.  For its members it holds monthly meetings in [[Brisbane]] as well as regular field excursions and campouts.  The logo of Birds Queensland is the [[yellow-bellied sunbird]], a species whose Australian range lies entirely within Queensland.

A '''registered office''' is the official address of an [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] [[company (law)|company]], association or any other [[Juristic person|legal entity]]. Generally it will form part of the public record and is required in most countries where the registered [[organization]] or legal entity is incorporated.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Arthur. ''The European Film Production Guide: Finance, Tax, Legislation''. [[Routledge]], 1996. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_14gq_KsRwMC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=%22Registered+office%22+definition&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1tAuTPSHDcWqlAfJwIyTCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Registered%20office%22%20definition&amp;f=false 21]. Retrieved from [[Google Books]] on 3 July 2010. {{ISBN|0-415-13665-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-13665-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A registered physical office address is required for incorporated organizations to receive official correspondence and formal notices from government departments, investors, banks, shareholders and the general public.&lt;ref name="A&amp;T"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adirondack|first1=Sandy|last2=Taylor|first2=James Sinclair|title=Voluntary sector legal handbook|date=2008|publisher=Directory of Social Change|location=London|isbn=9781903991879|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|209}}

==In the United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]] and many other [[List of country legal systems#Common law|common law countries]], the registered office address does not have to be where the organization conducts its actual business or trade, and it is not unusual for [[law firms]], [[accountant]]s or incorporation agents to provide the official registered office address service. In the United Kingdom all statutory correspondence for an incorporated organization (e.g. formal notices, [[service of process]], tax and government communications) is posted or hand delivered to the registered office address as recorded on the [[Companies House]] register. A registered physical office address is required for incorporated organizations to receive official correspondence and formal notices from government departments, investors, banks, shareholders and the general public.&lt;ref name="A&amp;T"/&gt;{{rp|209}}

Under regulations implemented in the UK on 1 October 2009, company directors may now also use a registered office address instead of their private home address for contact on the Companies House register.

The company's full registered name must be visible to the public on the premises. The Company's records previously had to be kept at the registered office and available for public inspection. Since 1 October 2009 it has been possible for companies to designate a single alternative inspection location (SAIL) as a place to keep their records which must be available for public inspection.&lt;ref name="A&amp;T"/&gt;{{rp|210}}

==Other countries==
In many other countries the address with which a company is registered must be where its headquarters or [[Seat (legal entity)|seat]] is located, and this will often determine the subnational registry at which the company must be registered.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2267">{{Other uses of|smoking gun|Smoking gun (disambiguation)}}
The term "'''smoking gun'''" is a reference to an object or fact that serves as conclusive [[evidence (law)|evidence]] of a [[crime]] or similar act, just short of being caught ''[[in flagrante delicto]]''. "''Smoking gun''" refers to the strongest kind of [[circumstantial evidence]], as opposed to [[direct evidence]]. Direct evidence would include the entire action: Pulling the trigger, firing the gun, and the victim falling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Walton, Douglas |title=Legal Argumentation and Evidence |publisher=Penn State Press |year=2010 |page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Phrase origin==
The phrase originally came from the idea that finding a very recently fired (hence smoking) gun on the person of a suspect wanted for shooting someone, which in that situation would be nearly unshakable proof of having committed the crime. The phrase originated in the [[Sherlock Holmes]] story, "[[The Adventure of the Gloria Scott]]" (1893).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Safire |first=William |authorlink=William Safire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/26/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-1-26-03-on-language-smoking-gun.html &lt;!-- redirect from http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E5DE1130F935A15752C0A9659C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all --&gt; |department=The Way We Live Now |series=On Language |title=Smoking Gun |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=26 January 2003 |accessdate=2015-05-06 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extended meaning==
In addition to this, its meaning has evolved in uses completely unrelated to criminal activity: for example, scientific evidence that is highly suggestive in favor of a particular hypothesis is sometimes called "smoking gun evidence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/smoking%20gun |title=Smoking Gun |accessdate=2018-01-30 |website=[[Merriam-Webster.com]] |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
The Talishis generally identify themselves with the ancient [[Cadusii|Cadusians]], who inhabited the area to the southwest of [[Caspian Sea]], bounded on the north by [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura River]], including modern provinces of [[Ardabil Province|Ardabil]] and [[Gilan Province|Gilan]]. The name ''Talishi'' may be etymologically related to Cadusi, which has influenced the name of the Caspian and Caucasus.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

== Language ==
Talysh has two major mutually intelligible dialects – Northern (in Azerbaijan and Iran), and Southern (in Iran). [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] is used as the literary language in Azerbaijan and [[Persian language|Persian]] in Iran.

== Genetics ==
With regards to their [[Y-Chromosome|NRY]]-[[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y-DNA]] [[haplogroup]]s, the Talysh show salient Near-Eastern affinities, with [[Haplogroup J-M172 (Y-DNA)|haplogroup J2]], associated with the advent and diffusion of agriculture in the neolithic [[Levant|Near East]], found in over 25% of the sample.&lt;ref name="Nasidze"&gt;Nasidze I, Quinque D, et al. (2009). "mtDNA and Y-chromosome variation in the Talysh of Iran and Azerbaijan". American Journal of Physical Anthropology 138 (1): 82–9&lt;/ref&gt; Another patriline, [[Haplogroup R-M207 (Y-DNA)|haplogroup R1]], is also seen to range from 1/4 to up to 1/2, while [[Haplogroup R-M420 (Y-DNA)|R1a1]], a marker associated with Eastern [[Indo-European people|Indo-European]], which includes [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian peoples]] of [[Central Asia|Central]]/[[South Asia|South]] [[Eurasia]], only reaches to under 5%, along with [[Haplogroup G-M201 (Y-DNA)|haplogroup G]].&lt;ref name="Nasidze" /&gt;

== Demographics ==
[[File:Talysh language dialects.svg|thumb|Talysh language dialects]]
According to the [[Russian Imperial Census]] of 1897 there were 34,994 Talysh in [[Baku Governorate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Первая всеобщая перепись населения Российской Империи 1897 г. Распределение населения по родному языку и уездам Российской Империи кроме губерний Европейской России|url=http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/emp_lan_97_uezd.php?reg=319|website=Демоскоп Weekly|accessdate=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 1926 census, there were 77,039 Talysh in [[Azerbaijan SSR]].  From 1959 to 1989, the Talysh were not included as a separate ethnic group in any census, but rather they were included as part of the Turkic-speaking Azerbaijanis, although the Talysh speak an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian language]]. In 1999, the Azerbaijani government claimed there were only 76,800 Talysh in Azerbaijan, but this is believed to be an under-representation given the problems with registering as a Talysh. Some claim that the population of the Talysh inhabiting the southern regions of Azerbaijan is 600,000.&lt;ref name="Trends and Tensions" /&gt; Talysh nationalists have always asserted that the number of Talysh in Azerbaijan is substantially higher than the official statistics.&lt;ref name="cria-online.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="One Europe, Many Nations" /&gt;

Obtaining accurate statistics is difficult, due to the unavailability of reliable sources, intermarriage, and the decline of the [[Talysh language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Allegation of Minority Rights Violations in Azerbaijan | work = Wash. profile | url = http://www.washprofile.org/en/node/6773 | accessdate = 2007-12-29 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071107102024/http://www.washprofile.org/en/node/6773 | archivedate = 7 November 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Talysh: Editor Arrested  | work = | publisher = http://www.unpo.org/| date =8 February 2007 | url = http://www.unpo.org/article.php?id=6268 | accessdate = 2007-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Radio Free Europe]]/[[Radio Liberty]] have voiced their concerns about the arrest of [[Novruzali Mamedov]], Chairman of the Talysh Cultural Centre and editor-in-chief of the ''Tolyshi Sado'' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Azerbaijani Authorities Accused of Discriminating Against Ethnic Minorities| work = HRI | publisher = Hellenic Resources Network | date = 7 July 2011 | url = http://www.hri.org/news/balkans/rferl/2007/07-07-11.rferl.html#11 | accessdate = 2007-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a U.S. government interview with Khilal Mamedov, a Talysh rights activist, Mr. Mamedov:  “Accused the Azerbaijani leadership of Turkic nationalism and of seeking to suppress non-Turkic minorities…. He said the Azerbaijani leadership seeks to minimize contacts between the Talysh communities in Azerbaijan and Iran and to run Azerbaijan into a monoethnic state.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = RFE/RL | newspaper = Newsline | title = Azerbaijani authorities accused of discriminating against ethnic minorities | date = 20 February 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== During modern history ==

=== USSR era ===
In the early Soviet period, there were Talysh high schools, a newspaper called "Red Talysh", and several Talysh language books published, but by end of the 1930s these schools were closed and the Talysh identity was not acknowledged in official statistics, with the Talysh being classified as "Azerbaijani".&lt;ref name="Trends and Tensions" /&gt;

According to Russian historian and ethnologist [[Victor Schnirelmann]],
{{quote | Simultaneously ethnic minorities suffered persecutions in Azerbaijan. After Soviet power was established, the Iranian speaking Talyshes, who lived in southeast Azerbaijan dreamt of the restoration of the Talysh Mugan republic declared in the summer of 1919 and brutually ruined by Ottoman Troops. In 1936–38, Talysh nationalists were exiled to Siberia, and Talysh schools were closed.  Broadcasting in Talysh was abolished, and the Talyshes were deprived of their mass media in general. Since that time, the Talyshes have been pressed to identify themselves with the Azeris.&lt;ref&gt;Shnirelmann, V.A. (2001), ''The Value of the Past: Myths, Identity and Politics in Transcaucasia'', Osaka: National Museum of Ethnology.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== From 1991 to present ===

Historical repression of identity and the inability to practice their culture and language has led the Talysh to an internalized self repression.&lt;ref name="Trends and Tensions" /&gt; This makes it hard to gauge support for any type of Talysh movement.&lt;ref name="Trends and Tensions" /&gt; According to Hema Kotecha, many Talysh fear being associated with the separatist [[Talysh-Mughan Autonomous Republic]], with Russia, or with [[Armenia]] if they acknowledge or attempt to talk about their beliefs in the public sphere.  For instance, a school in Lerik wanted to invite a poet from Lenkoran to a party in his honor and to speak to children; the headmaster was told that he would be dismissed if the event went ahead.  The fear of the police is another factor to this silence, although support for a secular democracy and shared Azerbaijani-Talysh feelings towards Nagorno-Karabakh contribute as well.&lt;ref name = "Trends and Tensions" /&gt; The Talesh population is declining; the language is on its way to extinction within 25–35 years, as its very often not passed on to children.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Young Talesh people more frequently use [[Persian language|Persian]] or [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] in their communities.

{{As of | 2008}}, [[Ismail Shabanov]] was the president of the Talysh diaspora of Russia.

===The National Talysh Movement (NTM)===
The National Talysh Movement (NTM) was formally created in 2007 by Talysh leaders exiled in the [[Netherlands]]. The members of the organization include those who were in support of the Talysh-Mughan Autonomous Republic such as [[Alikram Hummatov]], the self-proclaimed president of Talysh-Mughan. The movements favors an autonomous region within Azerbaijan. It also demands the promotion of democratic, cultural, and linguistic rights of all minorities within Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name=talyshunpo&gt;{{cite web|title=Talysh|url=http://unpo.org/members/17338|publisher=Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO)|date=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tono Maria''' also known as the “[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] of [[South America]]” was another woman, similar to [[Sarah Baartman]]’s case, that was exhibited in the “London shows” or freak shows in the 1800s. Tono Maria, a Botocudo (derived from the Portuguese word, botoque for plug) woman from the South American region (now the Brazilian state of [[Minas Gerais]]) was known for her scars, social codes that signified her sexual transgressions, her full figure and large lip and ear plugs. Tono Maria’s features fascinated the London spectators and further fueled their studies in scientific racism and western superiority.

==Life==
Tono Maria was displayed in a London freak show, and described in an 1822 article called the “Sketches of Society: The Shows of London” as the [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] of South America whose “charms are reputed to have been irresistible in her native land in which she made conquest of no fewer than three chieftains in succession." She is described at the time as being "about forty years of age". &lt;ref name="London Literary Gazette"&gt;Sketches of Society: The Shows of London.” The London Literary Gazettte and Journal of the Belle Lettres, 1822. pg 123. Accessed April 14, 2017. https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435059865105;view=1up;seq=131&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbolism ==
Author Janell Hobson briefly recounts Tono Maria in her memoir, ''Venus in the Dark'', and describes how the London spectators viewed her nearly 100 scars, each supposedly representing a sexual transgression committed in her own tribe, as a social stigma, a mark of excess sexuality representing how nonwhites were "openly licentious, debauched, and depraved” in comparison with European white women who were considered “pure” and “refined”.&lt;ref name="Venus in the Dark"&gt;Janell Hobson. Venus in the Dark: Blackness and Beauty in Popular Culture. Routledge. Taylor &amp; Francis Group. pg 46. 2005. Accessed April 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Author Rosemarie Garland Thompson mentions Tono Maria in her book, ''Extraordinary Bodies'', as a spectacle that “confirmed the Englishman’s sense of physical mastery” and was seen as a cautionary tale of female sexual appetite. &lt;ref&gt;Rosemarie Garland Thompson. ''Extraordinary Bodies''. Columbia University Press.April 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tulādhar''' ([[Devanagari]]: तुलाधर) is a Nepalese caste from the [[Newar]] community of the [[Kathmandu Valley]] in [[Nepal]]. The name Tuladhar is derived from the Sanskrit words "tula" ([[weighing scale]]) and "dhar" (possessor), thus meaning scale-bearer or in general, merchant. Tuladhars belong to the [[Uray (caste group)|Uray]] group which includes [[Kansakar]], [[Tamrakar]], [[Sthapit]], [[Bania (Newar caste)|Bania]], Sindurakar, Selalik and other castes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Todd T.|title=Notes on the Uray and the Modernization of Newar Buddhism|url=http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/contributions/CNAS_23_01_08.pdf|accessdate=31 January 2011|newspaper=Contributions to Nepalese Studies|date=January 1996}} Page 110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Wright| first =Daniel| url = https://archive.org/stream/HistoryOfNepal/HistoryOfNepaldanielWright_djvu.txt| title =History of Nepal with an Introductory Sketch of the Country and People of Nepal| work = | publisher =Cambridge| year=1877| accessdate = 23 September 2012}} Page 86.&lt;/ref&gt; They follow [[Newar Buddhism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Locke| first =John K.| url =http://www.niem.com.np/newararticles/unique_features.htm| title =Unique Features of Newar Buddhism| work =| publisher =Nagarjuna Institute of Exact Methods| year =2008| accessdate =9 February 2011| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120324221525/http://www.niem.com.np/newararticles/unique_features.htm| archivedate =24 March 2012| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; and speak [[Nepal Bhasa]] as a mother tongue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Todd T|title=Buddhism, Himalayan Trade, and Newar Merchants|url=http://buddhim.20m.com/8-4.htm/|accessdate=31 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional occupation==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 135-S-10-04-32, Tibetexpedition, Karawane vor Chomolhari.jpg|thumb|200px|A caravan in Tibet, Mt. Chomolhari in background.]]
According to the division of labor laid down from ancient times in Newar society, business is the traditional occupation of Tuladhars. They are best known for their history as trans-Himalayan traders conducting trade between Nepal, [[India]] and [[Tibet]].&lt;ref&gt;LeVine, Sarah and Gellner, David N. (2005) ''Rebuilding Buddhism: The Theravada Movement in Twentieth-Century Nepal.'' Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-674-01908-9}}. Page 25.

The merchants used two trade routes to travel to Tibet. One went north from Kathmandu and crossed the Himalaya at Kuti (now known as [[Nyalam Town|Nyalam]]) or [[Gyirong (village)|Kyirong]], also spelt [[Gyirong (village)|Gyirong]]. The other route started at Kalimpong&lt;ref&gt;''Kalimpong.'' New Delhi: Nest &amp; Wings. {{ISBN|81-87592-01-X}}. Page 20.&lt;/ref&gt; and passed through [[Nathula]] or [[Jelepla]] on the [[Sikkim]]-Tibet border. These trade routes are offshoots of the ancient [[Silk Road]].

Textiles and other factory products were the main exports to Tibet while they brought back wool, musk pods, hides and yak tails. This traditional business came to an end in the mid-1960s after the route through Sikkim was shut down following the 1962 [[Sino-Indian War]], and all the Tuladhar traders returned home. In the course of conducting trade, they have been a cultural bridge between South and Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tuladhar|first=Kamal Ratna|title=Merchants of yore|url=http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2010/01/08/Expression/Merchants-of-yore/203864/|accessdate=1 February 2011|newspaper=The Kathmandu Post|date=9 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rai|first=Dinesh|title=Traders on the Roof of the World: Lhasa Newars In Tibet|url=http://www.ecs.com.np/feature_detail.php?f_id=188|accessdate=31 January 2011|newspaper=ECS|date=October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, while they are still primarily merchants, many pursue varied professions.

==Cultural life==
[[File:Asan paya 2012.jpg|thumb|200px|Asan Pāyā sword procession]]
Tuladhars observe an annual schedule of religious performances, devotional musical concerts and hymn singing sessions that are conducted at the community level. Among the prominent street performances are the Dāpā Thāyegu, [[Gunla Bajan]] Thāyegu and Bahidyah Bwayegu festivals.

The month-long Dāpā Thāyegu festival is held in October when they gather to sing hymns every evening. A picture of a sacred jar made of wheat, popcorn and black soybean is displayed at Asan to mark the end of the festival.

The Bahidyah Bwayegu festival is held in August when a procession of musicians playing Gunla Bajan music and followers make a tour of sacred courtyards in Kathmandu where statues of [[Dipankara Buddha]] and [[paubha]]s are put on exhibition.

Asan Pāyā (असं पाया) is part of the Mohani festival in October when a sword procession is held at Asan. The ceremony ends with the participants chopping up a gourd painted with the face of a demon.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1887">'''West-Veluws''' is a [[Veluws]] dialect from the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] province of [[Gelderland]]. This dialect is spoken in different villages on the west side of the Veluwe and some villages on border of [[Gelderland]] and [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] ([[Bunschoten]], [[Scherpenzeel, Gelderland|Scherpenzeel]] et cetera). Sometimes even the dialect of [[Huizen]] in [[North Holland]] is seen as West-Veluws (but mostly as [[Hollandic]]).

There is a 'dictionary' (more like a theme book with the local Veluws translations of Dutch words).

*Part one: ''Woordenboek van de Gelderse Dialecten, Veluwe - Het huis''
*Part two: ''Woordenboek van de Gelderse Dialecten, Veluwe - De mens''
*Part three: ''Woordenboek van de Gelderse Dialecten, Veluwe - De wereld''

{{Update|date=January 2011}}
The whole project is expected to be put online by 2010.

West-Veluws is a [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] which lies between [[Low Franconian]] and Low Saxon. West-Veluws does however belong to Low Saxon because of its grammar, typical Low Saxon vocabulary and history.

Legally, '''women in Andorra''' have equal rights under the laws of the [[Andorra|Principality of Andorra]]. Politically, Andorran women won 15 seats during their country's parliamentary election of 2011; for this reason, Andorra became the first nation in [[Europe]] and the second country internationally to have elected a "majority female legislature". 

== Women's rights in Andorra ==
Among the problems that confront Andorran women at present are the existence of violence against them, the absence of government departments that deal with issues about women, and the non-existence of shelters for battered women that are managed by the [[government of Andorra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andorra|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2012/andorra|publisher=Freedom House (2012)|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andorra was slow to give women legal rights: [[women's suffrage]] was achieved only in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/3406417.stm|title=Timeline: Andorra|date=9 November 2011|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Women in society sidebar}}
Freeborn '''women in ancient Rome''' were [[Roman citizenship|citizens]] (''cives''),&lt;ref&gt;The form of [[Roman marriage]] called ''conubium'', for instance, requires that both spouses be citizens; like men from [[municipium|towns]] granted ''[[civitas|civitas sine suffragio]]'', women (at least those eligible for ''conubium'') were citizens without [[suffrage]]. The legal status of a mother as a citizen affected her son's citizenship. All Roman citizens recognized as such by law did not hold equal rights and privileges, particularly in regard to holding high office. See ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'' following, and [[A.N. Sherwin-White]], ''Roman Citizenship'' (Oxford University Press, 1979), pp. 211 and 268 [https://books.google.com/books?id=atzisLCgoPUC&amp;pg=PA268&amp;dq=%22ex+duobus+civibus+Romanis+natos%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ex%20duobus%20civibus%20Romanis%20natos%22&amp;f=false online] (on male citizenship as it relates to marrying citizen women) ''et passim''. ("children born of two Roman citizens") indicates that a Roman woman was regarded as having citizen status, in specific contrast to a ''[[Peregrinus (Roman)|peregrina]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; but could not vote or hold [[Roman magistrate|political office]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce W. Frier and Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'' (Oxford University Press: American Philological Association, 2004), pp. 31–32, 457, ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their limited public role, women are named less frequently than men by [[Roman historiography|Roman historians]]. But while Roman women held no direct political power, those from wealthy or powerful families could and did exert influence through private negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;Kristina Milnor, "Women in Roman Historiography," in ''The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Historians'' (Cambridge University Press, 2009), p. 278; Ann Ellis Hanson, "The Restructuring of Female Physiology at Rome," in ''Les écoles médicales à Rome: Actes du 2&lt;sup&gt;ème&lt;/sup&gt; Colloque international sur les textes médicaux latins antiques, Lausanne, septembre 1986'' (Université de Nantes, 1991), p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptional women who left an undeniable mark on history range from [[Lucretia]] and [[Claudia Quinta]], whose stories took on [[Roman mythology|mythic significance]]; fierce [[Roman Republic|Republican-era]] women such as [[Cornelia Africana|Cornelia]], mother of the [[Gracchi]], and [[Fulvia]], who commanded an army and issued coins bearing her image; women of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]], most prominently [[Livia]] (58 BC-AD 29), who contributed to the formation of [[Roman Empire|Imperial]] ''[[mos maiorum|mores]]''; and the empress [[Helena (Empress)|Helena]] ({{circa}}250–330 AD), a driving force in promoting Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Unless otherwise noted, this introductory overview is based on Beryl Rawson, "Finding Roman Women," in ''A Companion to the Roman Republic'' (Blackwell, 2010), p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Great Man theory|As is the case with male members of society]], elite women and their politically significant deeds eclipse those of lower status in the historical record. [[Epigraphy|Inscriptions]] and especially [[epitaph]]s document the names of a wide range of women throughout the Roman Empire, but often tell little else about them. Some vivid snapshots of daily life are preserved in [[Latin literature|Latin literary genres]] such as [[Roman comedy|comedy]], [[satire]], and poetry, particularly the poems of [[Catullus]] and [[Ovid]], which offer glimpses of women in Roman [[triclinium|dining rooms]] and boudoirs, at sporting and theatrical events, shopping, [[Cosmetics in Ancient Rome|putting on makeup]], practicing [[Magic in the Greco-Roman world|magic]], worrying about pregnancy — all, however, [[Male gaze|through male eyes]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Olson, "The Appearance of the Young Roman Girl," in ''Roman Dress and the Fabrics of Roman Culture'' (University of Toronto Press, 2008), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; The published letters of [[Cicero]], for instance, reveal informally how the self-proclaimed great man interacted on the domestic front with his wife [[Terentia]] and daughter [[Tullia (daughter of Cicero)|Tullia]], as his speeches demonstrate through disparagement the various ways Roman women could enjoy a free-spirited sexual and social life.&lt;ref&gt;In reference to his character assassination of the notorious [[Clodia Metelli|Clodia]]; see ''[[Pro Caelio]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The one major public role reserved solely for women was in the sphere of [[Religion in ancient Rome|religion]]: the priestly office of the [[Vestals]]. Freed of any obligation to marry or have children, the Vestals devoted themselves to the study and correct observance of rituals which were deemed necessary for the security and survival of Rome but which could not be performed by the male [[Collegium (ancient Rome)|colleges]] of priests.&lt;ref&gt;For an extensive modern consideration of the Vestals, see Ariadne Staples, ''From Good Goddess to Vestal Virgins: Sex and Category in Roman Religion'' (Routledge, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Childhood and education==
[[File:Spielende Mädchen.JPG|thumb|left|Roman girls playing a game]]

Childhood and upbringing in ancient Rome were determined by social status, wealth and gender. Roman children played a number of games, and their toys are known from archaeology and literary sources. Animal figures were popular, and some children kept live animals and birds as pets.&lt;ref&gt;Beryl Rawson, ''Children and Childhood in Roman Italy'' (Oxford University Press, 2003), pp. 129–130.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Roman art]], girls are shown playing many of the same games as boys, such as ball, [[Hoop rolling#History|hoop-rolling]], and [[knucklebones]]. [[Doll]]s are sometimes found in the tombs of those who died before adulthood. The figures are typically 15–16&amp;nbsp;cm tall, with jointed limbs, and made of materials such as wood, [[terracotta]], and especially [[Ivory carving|bone and ivory]]. Girls coming of age [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#votum|dedicated]] their dolls to [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], the goddess most concerned with girlhood, or to [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] when they were preparing for marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, ''Children and Childhood in Roman Italy'', p. 128, citing [[Persius]] 2.70 and the related [[scholion]], and p. 48 on Diana. Rome lacked the elaborate puberty rites for girls that were practiced in ancient Greece (p. 145).&lt;/ref&gt; Noble girls were known to marry as young as 12 years of age,&lt;ref name="Beryl Rawson 1999 p. 21"&gt;Beryl Rawson, "The Roman Family in Italy" (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas females in the lower classes were more likely to marry slightly further into their teenage years.&lt;ref&gt;Judith P. Hallett, Fathers and Daughters in Roman Society: Women and the Elite Family (Princeton University Press, 1984), 142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Lauren, Caldwell, "Roman Girlhood and the Fashioning of Femininity" (Cambridge University Press, 2014), pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the marriage age of noble females can be seen with [[Cicero]]'s lifelong friend Atticus, who married his daughter [[Caecilia Attica]] to [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]] when she was 14.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Bronze young girl reading CdM Paris.jpg|thumb|upright|Bronze statuette of the 1st century depicting a girl reading]]
Girls were expected to safeguard their chastity, modesty and reputation, in preparation for eventual marriage.&lt;ref name="Caldwell p. 16"&gt;Caldwell, "Roman Girlhood and the Fashioning of Femininity", p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The light regulation of marriage by the law with regards to minimum age (12) and consent to marriage was designed to leave families, primarily fathers, with much freedom to propel girls into marriage whenever and with whomever they saw fit. Marriage facilitated a partnership between the father and prospective husbands, and enabled the formation of a mutually beneficial alliance with both political and economic incentives at heart.&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, "Roman Girlhood and the Fashioning of Femininity", pp. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt; The social regime, geared towards early marriage and implemented through children's education and upbringing, was particularly restrictive for girls.&lt;ref name="Caldwell p. 16"/&gt; Some, perhaps many, girls went to a [[ludus (ancient Rome)|public primary school]], however there is some evidence to suggest that girls’ education was limited to this elementary school level. It has been inferred that individual school tutoring of girls at home was led by concerns about threats to girls’ modesty in coeducational classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, "Roman Girlhood and the Fashioning of Femininity", p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ovid]] and [[Martial]] imply that boys and girls were educated either together or similarly, and [[Livy]] takes it for granted that the daughter of a [[centurion]] would be in school.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, ''Children and Childhood in Roman Italy'', pp. 197–198&lt;/ref&gt; However many other historians and philosophers, such as [[Epictetus]], suggest that the educational system, particularly rhetorical training, was preoccupied with the development of masculine virtue; with male teenagers performing school exercises in public speaking about [[Mos maiorum|Roman values]].&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, "Roman Girlhood and the Fashioning of Femininity", p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Children of both genders learned to behave socially by attending dinner parties or other, less elitist events. Both genders participated in [[Roman festivals|religious festivals]]; for example, at the [[Secular Games]] of 17 BC, the ''[[Carmen Saeculare]]'' was sung by a choir of girls and boys.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, ''Children and Childhood in Roman Italy'', p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Children were made into virtuous adults through scholastic means, with curriculum, language, literature, and philosophy teaching moral precepts. Children of the elite were taught [[ancient Greek language|Greek]] as well as Latin from an early age.&lt;ref&gt;Janine Assa, ''The Great Roman Ladies'' (New York, 1960), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the upper classes, women seem to have been well-educated, some highly so, and were sometimes praised by the male historians for their learning and cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;Beryl Rawson, "The Roman Family," in ''The Family in Ancient Rome: New Perspectives'' (Cornell University Press, 1986), pp. 30, 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Some women became socially prominent, and even relatively independent.&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, "Roman Girlhood and the Fashioning of Femininity", p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cornelia Metella]], the young wife of [[Pompey the Great]] at the time of his death, was distinguished for her musicianship and her knowledge of geometry, literature, and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Pompey'' 55 [[LacusCurtius]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pompey*.html#55 edition.]&lt;/ref&gt; This degree of learning indicates formal preparation, however among the lower classes education was limited and strongly geared towards the course of marriage, and performing the tasks of the female within the household.&lt;ref&gt;Sandra R. Joshel, [[Sheila Murnaghan]], "Women and Slaves in Greco-Roman Culture" (Routledge; New edition 2001), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Elite families poured money into their daughters literary and virtue training to equip them with skills that would appeal to prospective husbands. Epictetus suggests that at the age of 14, girls were considered to be on the brink of womanhood, and beginning to understand the inevitability of their future role as wives. They learned modesty through explicit instruction and upbringing.&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, "Roman Girlhood and the Fashioning of Femininity", pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lives of boys and girls began to diverge dramatically after they formally came of age,&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, "The Roman Family," p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; and memorials to women recognize their domestic qualities far more often than intellectual achievements.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, ''Children and Childhood in Roman Italy'', p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The skills a Roman matron needed to run a household required training, and mothers probably passed on their knowledge to their daughters in a manner appropriate to their station in life, given the emphasis in Roman society on traditionalism.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, ''Children and Childhood in Roman Italy'', p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; Virginity and sexual purity was a culturally valued quality, and considered vital for the stability of both family and state. The rape of an unmarried girl posed a threat to her reputation and marriageability, and the penalty of death was sometimes imposed on the unchaste daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, "Roman Girlhood and the Fashioning of Femininity", pp. 11, 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt; The Emperor Augustus introduced marriage legislation, the [[Lex Papia Poppaea]], which rewarded marriage and childbearing. The legislation also imposed penalties on young persons who failed to marry and on those who committed adultery. Therefore, marriage and childbearing was made law between the ages of twenty-five and sixty for men, and twenty and fifty for women.&lt;ref&gt;Mary T. Boatwright, Daniel J. Gargola, Noel Lenski, Richard J. A. Talbert, "A Brief History of The Romans" (Oxford University Press; 2 edition, 2013), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women in the family and law==

===Always a daughter===
{{See also|Pater familias}}
Both daughters and sons were subject to ''[[patria potestas]]'', the power wielded by their father as head of household (''familia''). A Roman household was considered a collective (''corpus'', a "body") over which the ''pater familias'' had mastery (''dominium''). Slaves, who had no legal standing, were part of the household as property. In the early Empire, the legal standing of daughters differed little if at all from that of sons.&lt;ref&gt;Frier, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; If the father died without a will, the right of a daughter to share in the family property was equal to that of a son, though legislation in the 2nd century BCE had attempted to limit this right. Even apart from legal status, daughters seem no less esteemed within the Roman family than sons, though sons were expected to ensure family standing by following their fathers into public life.&lt;ref&gt;Beryl Rawson, "The Roman Family," in ''The Family in Ancient Rome: New Perspectives'' (Cornell University Press, 1986), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cremona, museo civico, ritrattuo femminile, primi decenni del iii secolo d.c..JPG|thumb|upright|left|Bust of a Roman girl, early 3rd century]]
The ''pater familias'' had the right and duty to find a husband for his daughter,&lt;ref&gt;Frier, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; and first marriages were normally arranged. Technically, the couple had to be old enough to consent, but the age of consent was 12 for girls and 14 for boys, though in practice boys seem to have been on average five years older. Among the elite, 14 was the age of transition from childhood to adolescence,&lt;ref&gt;[[John Crook (classicist)|J.A. Crook]], ''Law and Life of Rome 90B.C.-212 A.D.''&lt;/ref&gt; but a [[betrothal]] might be arranged for political reasons when the couple were too young to marry,&lt;ref name="Beryl Rawson 1999 p. 21"/&gt; and in general [[nobiles|noble women]] married younger than women of the lower classes. Most Roman women would have married in their late teens to early twenties. An aristocratic girl was expected to be a virgin when she married, as her young age might indicate.&lt;ref&gt;Judith P. Hallett, ''Fathers and Daughters in Roman Society: Women and the Elite Family'' (Princeton University Press, 1984), 142.&lt;/ref&gt; A daughter could legitimately refuse a match made by her parents only by showing that the proposed husband was of bad character.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, "The Roman Family", p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman Republic#Early Republic (458 BCE - 274 BCE)|early Republic]], the bride became subject to her husband's ''potestas'', but to a lesser degree than their children.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce W. Frier and Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; By the early Empire, however, a daughter's legal relationship to her father remained unchanged when she married, even though she moved into her husband's home.&lt;ref name="McGinn, pp. 19"&gt;Frier and McGinn, ''Casebook'', pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; This arrangement was one of the factors in the degree of independence Roman women enjoyed relative to those of many other ancient cultures and up to the early modern period: although she had to answer to her father legally, she didn't conduct her daily life under his direct scrutiny,&lt;ref&gt;"If adults sons or daughters and their children had lived in the same household as the ''paterfamilias''," notes Rawson, "they may well have found the constant awareness of his powers and position a great strain" ("The Roman Family," p. 15).&lt;/ref&gt; and her husband had no legal power over her.&lt;ref name="McGinn, pp. 19"/&gt;

A daughter was expected to be deferential toward her father and to remain loyal to him, even if it meant having to differ with her husbands.&lt;ref&gt;Hallett, 139.&lt;/ref&gt; "Deference" was not always absolute. After arranging his daughter's first two marriages, [[Cicero]] disapproved — rightly, as it turned out — of her choice to marry the unreliable [[Publius Cornelius Dolabella|Dolabella]], but found himself unable to prevent it.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, ''The Roman Family'', p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

A daughter kept her own [[Naming conventions for women in ancient Rome|family name]] (''nomen'') for life, not assuming that of her husband. Children usually took the father's name. In the Imperial period, however, children might sometimes make their mother's family name part of theirs, or even adopt it instead.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, "The Roman Family," p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women and sexuality ==
From the start of the Roman republic, there was a high emphasis placed on a woman's virginity. [[Pudicitia]] (chastity) was a goddess of feminine purity, and was worshipped by Roman women. Only those who were virgins were allowed to enter the temple.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Politics in Ancient Rome|last=Bauman|first=Richard|publisher=Routlege|year=1992|isbn=|location=New York, New York|pages=8, 10, 15, 105}}&lt;/ref&gt; A woman's sexual life began with the consummation of her marriage in her husband's cubiculum, or private room where slaves did not enter. In Roman houses it was common for men and women to each have their own cubicula, allowing potential for them to engage in sex lives separate from each other. While it was expected that women should only have sexual relations with their husbands, it was common for men to have many sexual partners throughout his life.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; After marriage, women were scrutinized in the household to prevent any adulterous behavior. For example, [[Julius Caesar|Julius Caesar's]] first wife, [[Pompeia (wife of Julius Caesar)|Pompeia]], highlights this point well as she attempted to have private relations with [[Publius Clodius Thrasea Paetus|Publius Clodius]]. Julius Caesar's mother, Aurelia, monitored Pompeia's actions and prevented their private meetings. The mere possibility of Pompeia committing adultery caused Caesar to divorce her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Growing up and Growing old in Ancient Rome|last=Harlow, Mary|first=and Ray, Laurence|publisher=Rutledge|year=2002|isbn=|location=New York, New York|pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Augustus's campaign on women and the family ===
The obsession with a woman's purity, and her role as a faithful wife and dutiful mother in the family increased during the reign of Augustus. This general campaign to improve family dynamics began in 18–17 BC.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Brief History of the Romans|last=Boatwright|first=Mary|last2=Gargola|first2=Daniel|last3=Lenski|first3=Noel|last4=Talbert|first4=Richard|publisher=Oxford University|year=2005|isbn=|location=New York|pages=176–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus' new laws targeted both men and women between the ages of 20-55, who were rewarded for being in healthy relationships, and punished if not married and without children. Additionally, Augustus enforced the divorce and punishment of adulterous wives. Women under his rule could be punished in the courts for adultery and banished. This shifted a woman's body and relationships from being private, to become a public matter that could be regulated. Therefore, the palace was secured and driven by this idea that women would be returned to their proper places as chaste wives and mothers, and thus household order would be restored. Augustus went so far as to punish and exile his own daughter, Julia, for engaging in extramarrital affairs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Women and the law===
{{rquote|right|''There never was a case in court in which the quarrel was not started by a woman. If Manilia is not a defendant, she'll be the plaintiff; she will herself frame and adjust the pleadings; she will be ready to instruct [[Publius Juventius Celsus|Celsus himself]] how to open his case, and how to urge his points.''|[[Juvenal]], ''Satire'' VI}}

Although the rights and status of women in the earliest period of Roman history were more restricted than in the [[Roman Republic#Late Republic (147 BCE - 30 BCE)|late Republic]] and Empire, as early as the 5th century BC, Roman women could own land, write their own wills, and appear in court. The historian [[Valerius Maximus]] devotes a section of his work ''On Memorable Deeds and Speeches'' to women who conducted cases on their own behalf, or on behalf of others.&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Bauman, ''Women and Politics in Ancient Rome'' (Routledge, 1992, 1994), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; These women showed ability as orators in the courtroom, even though oratory was considered a defining pursuit of the most ambitious Roman men. One of these, [[Amaesia Sentia|Maesia Sentinas]],&lt;ref&gt;Her name appears also as ''Amesia''.&lt;/ref&gt; is identified by her origin in the town of [[Sentinum]], and not, [[naming conventions for women in ancient Rome|as was customary]], by her relation to a man. The independent Maesia spoke in her own defense, and was acquitted almost unanimously after only a short trial because she spoke with such strength and effectiveness. Since these characteristics were considered masculine, however, the historian opined that under her feminine appearance, she had a "virile spirit," and thereafter she was called "the [[Androgyne]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Valerius Maximus]] 8.3.1; Joseph Farrell, ''Latin Language and Latin Culture'' (Cambridge University Press, 2001), pp. 74–75; Michael C. Alexander, ''Trials in the Late Roman Republic, 149–50 BCE'' (University of Toronto Press, 1990), p. 180. Alexander places the date of the trial, about which Valerius is unclear, to sometime between 80 and 50 BCE. The charge goes unrecorded.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fanciulla intenta alla lettura (IV stile), I sec, da pompei, MANN 8946.JPG|thumb|left|Roman fresco of a [[blond]] maiden reading a text, [[Pompeian Styles|Pompeian Fourth Style]] (60–79 AD), [[Pompeii]], Italy]]
Maesia's ability to present a case "methodically and vigorously" suggests that while women didn't plead regularly in open court, they had experience in private declamation and family court.&lt;ref&gt;Bauman, ''Women and Politics'', p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gaia Afrania|Afrania]],&lt;ref&gt;The name is vexed; it may also be ''Carfrania''.&lt;/ref&gt; the wife of a senator during the time of [[Sulla]], appeared so frequently before the [[praetor]] who presided over the court, even though she had male advocates who could have spoken for her, that she was accused of ''[[calumnia (Roman law)|calumnia]]'', [[malicious prosecution]]. An edict was consequently enacted that prohibited women from bringing claims on behalf of others, on the grounds that it jeopardized their ''pudicitia'', the modesty appropriate to one's station.&lt;ref&gt;Bauman, ''Women and Politics'', pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noted&lt;ref&gt;Bauman, ''Women and Politics'', p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; that while women were often impugned for their feeblemindedness and ignorance of the law, and thus in need of protection by male advocates, in reality actions were taken to restrict their influence and effectiveness. Despite this specific restriction, there are numerous examples of women taking informed actions in legal matters in the Late Republic and [[Principate]], including dictating legal strategy to their advocate behind the scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Bauman, ''Women and Politics'', pp. 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

An emancipated woman legally became ''[[sui iuris]]'', or her own person, and could own property and dispose of it as she saw fit. If a ''pater familias'' died [[Intestacy|intestate]], the law required the equal division of his estate amongst his children, regardless of their age and sex. A will that did otherwise, or emancipated any family member without due process of law, could be challenged.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, ''Roman Law in Context'', chapter 3.3; Frier and McGinn, ''Casebook'', Chapter IV.&lt;/ref&gt; From the late Republic onward, a woman who inherited a share equal with her brothers would have been independent of [[wikt:agnatic|agnatic]] control.&lt;ref&gt;Yan Thomas, "The Division of the Sexes in Roman Law," in ''A History of Women from Ancient Goddesses to Christian Saints'' (Harvard University Press, 1991), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the case of minors, an emancipated woman had a legal guardian (''tutor'') appointed to her. She retained her powers of administration, however, and the guardian's main if not sole purpose was to give formal consent to actions.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Watson, ''The Spirit of Roman Law'' (University of Georgia Press, 1995), p. 13; Thomas, "The Division of the Sexes," p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; The guardian had no say in her private life, and a woman ''sui iuris'' could marry as she pleased.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Evans Grubbs, ''Women and the Law in the Roman Empire: A Sourcebook on Marriage, Divorce and Law in the Roman Empire'' (Routledge, 2002) , p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; A woman also had certain avenues of recourse if she wished to replace an obstructive tutor.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, ''The Spirit of Roman Law'', p. 13; Gaius, ''Inst.'' 1.173.&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Augustus]], a woman who had gained the ''[[ius trium liberorum|ius liberorum]]'', the legal right to certain privileges after bearing three children, was also released from guardianship,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, "The Division of the Sexes," p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; and the emperor Claudius banned agnatic guardianship. The role of guardianship as a legal institution gradually diminished, and by the 2nd century [[BCE|CE]] the [[Gaius (jurist)|jurist Gaius]] said he saw no reason for it.&lt;ref&gt;Gaius, ''Institutes'' 1.190–1.191.&lt;/ref&gt; The Christianization of the Empire, beginning with the conversion of the Emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] in the early 4th century, eventually had consequences for the legal status of women.

===Marriage===
{{Main|Marriage in ancient Rome}}
[[File:Roman marriage vows.jpg|thumb|300px|Roman couple in the ceremonial joining of hands; the bride's knotted belt symbolized that her husband was "belted and bound" to her.&lt;ref&gt;''Cinctus vinctusque'', according to [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] 55 (edition of Lindsay); Karen K. Hersch, ''The Roman Wedding: Ritual and Meaning in Antiquity'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010), pp. 101, 110, 211 .&lt;/ref&gt; 4th century sarcophagus]]
Family tomb inscriptions of respectable Romans suggest that the ideal Roman marriage was one of mutual loyalty, in which husband and wife shared interests, activities, and property.&lt;ref&gt;Wiesner, Merry E. ''“The Family” Gender in History: Global Perspectives,'' 2nd Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd., 2011, p.32&lt;/ref&gt;

In the earliest period of the [[Roman Republic]], a bride passed from her father's control into the "hand" ''(manus)'' of her husband. She then became subject to her husband's ''potestas'', though to a lesser degree than their children.&lt;ref&gt;Frier and McGinn, ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In the earliest periods of Roman history, [[Manus Marriage]] meant that a married woman would be subjugated by her husband, but that custom had died out by the 1st century BCE, in favor of Free Marriage which did not grant a husband any rights over his wife or have any changing effect on a woman's status.&lt;ref&gt;Duby,Perrot,and Pantel A History of Women Volume 1, pg. 133&lt;/ref&gt; During the classical era of [[Roman law]], marriage required no ceremony, but only a mutual will and agreement to live together in harmony. Marriage ceremonies, contracts, and other formalities were meant only to prove that a couple had, in fact, married. Under early or archaic [[Roman law]], marriages were of three kinds: ''[[confarreatio]]'', symbolized by the sharing of bread (''panis farreus''); ''coemptio'', "by purchase"; and ''usus'', by mutual cohabitation. [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|Patricians]] always married by ''confarreatio'', while [[plebs|plebeians]] married by the latter two kinds. In marriage by ''usus'', if a woman was absent for three consecutive nights at least once a year, she would avoid her husband establishing legal control over her. This differed from the [[Ancient Greek marriage law|Athenian custom of arranged marriage]] and sequestered wives who were not supposed to walk in the street unescorted.

The form of marriage known as ''manus'' was the norm in the [[Roman Republic#Early Republic (458 BCE - 274 BCE)|early Republic]], but became less frequent thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;The late Imperial Roman [[Gaius (jurist)|jurist Gaius]] writes of ''manus'' marriage as something that used to happen. Frier and McGinn, ''Casebook'', p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this early form of marriage, the bride passed into the "hand" (''manus'') of her husband; that is, she was transferred from the ''potestas'' of her father to that of her husband. Her [[dowry]], any [[inheritance|inheritance rights]] transferred through her marriage, and any property acquired by her after marriage belonged to him. Husbands could divorce on grounds of adultery, and a few cases of divorce for a wife's infertility are recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Frier and McGinn, ''Casebook'', p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Manus'' marriage was an unequal relationship; it changed a woman’s intestate heirs from her siblings to her children, not because she was their mother, but because in law her position was the same as that of a daughter to her husband. Under ''manus'', women were expected to obey their husbands in almost all aspects of their lives.

This archaic form of ''manus'' marriage was largely abandoned by the time of [[Julius Caesar]], when a woman remained under her father's authority by law even when she moved into her husband's home. This arrangement was one of the factors in the independence Roman women enjoyed relative to those of many other ancient cultures and up to the modern period:&lt;ref&gt;[[Eva Cantarella]], ''Pandora's Daughters: The Role and Status of Women in Greek and Roman Antiquity'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1987), pp. 140–141; J.P. Sullivan, "Martial's Sexual Attitudes", ''Philologus'' 123 (1979), p. 296, specifically on sexual freedom.&lt;/ref&gt; So-called "free" marriage caused no change in personal status for either the wife or the husband.&lt;ref&gt;David Johnston, ''Roman Law in Context'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Free marriage usually involved two citizens, or a citizen and a person who held [[Latin Rights|Latin rights]], and in the later Imperial period and with official permission, soldier-citizens and non-citizens. In a free marriage a bride brought a dowry to the husband: if the marriage ended with no cause of adultery he returned most of it.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, ''Roman Law'', pp. 36–36; Frier and McGinn, ''Casebook'', section V.&lt;/ref&gt; So total was the law's separation of property that gifts between spouses were not recognized as such; if a couple divorced or even lived apart, the giver could reclaim the gift.&lt;ref&gt;Frier and McGinn, ''Casebook'', pp. 49, 52, citing Ulpian, ''D.'' 24.1.3.1. If the donor died first, however, the gift to the surviving spouse was valid.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Divorce====
[[File:Fresco depicting a seated woman, from the Villa Arianna at Stabiae, Naples National Archaeological Museum (17393152265).jpg|thumb|[[Fresco]] of a seated woman from [[Stabiae]], 1st century AD]]
[[Divorce]] was a legal but relatively informal affair which mainly involved a wife leaving her husband’s house and taking back her dowry. According to the historian [[Valerius Maximus]], divorces were taking place by 604 BCE or earlier, and the law code as embodied in the mid-5th century BCE by the [[Twelve Tables]] provides for divorce.  Divorce was socially acceptable if carried out within social norms (''[[mos maiorum]]''). By the time of [[Cicero]] and [[Julius Caesar]], divorce was relatively common and "shame-free," the subject of gossip rather than a social disgrace.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suzanne Dixon]], "From Ceremonial to Sexualities: A Survey of Scholarship on Roman Marriage" in ''A Companion to Families in the Greek and Roman Worlds'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2011), p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Valerius says that Lucius Annius was disapproved of because he divorced his wife without consulting his friends; that is, he undertook the action for his own purposes and without considering its effects on his social network (''[[amicitia]]'' and ''[[Patronage in ancient Rome|clientela]]''). The [[Roman censor|censors]] of 307 BCE thus expelled him from the Senate for moral turpitude.

Elsewhere, however, it is claimed that the first divorce took place only in 230 BCE, at which time [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] notes&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], ''Antiquitates Romanae'', 2.25&lt;/ref&gt; that "[[Spurius Carvilius]], a man of distinction, was the first to divorce his wife" on grounds of infertility. This was most likely the [[Spurius Carvilius Maximus Ruga]] who was consul in 234 and 228 BCE. The evidence is confused.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aulus Gellius]] (''Noctes Atticae'' 4.3.1) places the divorce in 227 BCE,  but fudges the date and his sources elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the classical period of Roman law (late Republic and [[Principate]]), a man or woman&lt;ref&gt;Alan Watson, ''The Spirit of Roman Law'' (University of Georgia Press, 1995), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; could end a marriage simply because he or she wanted to, and for no other reason. Unless the wife could prove the spouse was worthless, he kept the children. Because property had been kept separate during the marriage, divorce from a "free" marriage was a very easy procedure.&lt;ref&gt;Frier and McGinn, ''Casebook'', part D, "The End of Marriage."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Remarriage====

The frequency of remarriage among the elite was high. Speedy remarriage was not unusual, and perhaps even customary, for aristocratic Romans after the death of a spouse.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Treggiari, ''Roman Marriage: ''Iusti Coniuges'' from the Time of Cicero to the Time of Ulpian'' (Oxford University Press, 1991), pp. 258–259, 500–502 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; While no formal waiting period was dictated for a widower, it was customary for a woman to remain in mourning for ten months before remarrying.&lt;ref&gt;Karen K. Hersch, ''The Roman Wedding: Ritual and Meaning in Antiquity'', p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; The duration may allow for pregnancy: if a woman had become pregnant just before her husband's death, the period of ten months ensures that no question of paternity, which might affect the child's social status and inheritance, would attach to the birth.&lt;ref&gt;In Roman [[inclusive counting]], a pregnancy was counted as lasting ten months.&lt;/ref&gt; No law prohibited pregnant women from marrying, and there are well-known instances: Augustus married Livia when she was carrying her former husband's child, and the [[College of Pontiffs]] ruled that it was permissible as long as the child's father was determined first. Livia's previous husband even attended the wedding.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eva Cantarella]], "Marriage and Sexuality in Republican Rome: A Roman Conjugal Love Story," in ''The Sleep of Reason: Erotic Experience and Sexual Ethics in Ancient Greece and Rome'' (University of Chicago Press, 2002), p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because elite marriages often occurred for reasons of politics or property, a widow or divorcée with assets in these areas faced few obstacles to remarrying. She was far more likely to be legally emancipated than a first-time bride, and to have a say in the choice of husband. The marriages of [[Fulvia]], who commanded troops during the last civil war of the Republic and who was the first Roman woman to have her face on a coin, are thought to indicate her own political sympathies and ambitions: she was married first to the [[populares|popularist]] champion [[Publius Clodius Pulcher|Clodius Pulcher]], who was murdered in the street after a long feud with Cicero; then to [[Scribonius Curio]], a figure of less ideological certitude who at the time of his death had come over to Julius Caesar; and finally to [[Mark Antony]], the last opponent to the republican oligarchs and to Rome's future first emperor.

The [[Greek historiography|Greek observer]] [[Plutarch]] indicates that a second wedding among Romans was likely to be a quieter affair, as a widow would still feel the absence of her dead husband, and a divorcée ought to feel shame.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Roman Questions'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Roman_Questions*/E.html#105 105.]&lt;/ref&gt; But while the circumstances of divorce might be shameful or embarrassing, and remaining married to the same person for life was ideal, there was no general disapproval of remarriage; on the contrary, marriage was considered the right and desirable condition of adult life for both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Karen K. Hersh, ''The Roman Wedding: Ritual and Meaning in Antiquity'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010), pp. 4, 48, ''et passim'' citing Humbert (1971), pp. 1–11. See also Treggiari, ''Roman Marriage''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cato the Younger]], who presented himself as a paragon modeled after his [[Cato the Elder|moral namesake]], allowed his pregnant wife [[Marcia (wife of Cato the Younger)|Marcia]] to divorce him and marry [[Quintus Hortensius|Hortensius]], declining to offer his young daughter to the 60-year-old orator instead. After the widowed Marcia inherited considerable wealth, Cato married her again, in a ceremony lacking many of the formalities.&lt;ref&gt;Hersh, ''The Roman Wedding'', ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=TZEJQPjc4sIC&amp;dq=marcia+intitle%3Aroman+intitle%3Awedding&amp;q=marcia#v=snippet&amp;q=marcia&amp;f=false passim]'', pointing to the fictionalized and possibly satiric account by [[Lucan]]. Or some scholars see in this more of an arrangement than marriage proper.&lt;/ref&gt; Women might be mocked, however, for marrying too often or capriciously, particularly if it could be implied that sexual appetites and vanity were motives.&lt;ref&gt;Hersh, ''The Roman Wedding'', pp. 103–104.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Concubinage ====
{{Details|Concubinage in ancient Rome}}
[[File:Pompeii - Casa dei Casti Amanti - Banquet.jpg|thumb|250px|Roman fresco with a banquet scene from the Casa dei Casti Amanti, [[Pompeii]]]]
A concubine was defined by Roman law as a woman living in a permanent monogamous relationship with a man not her husband.&lt;ref&gt;Frier and McGinn, ''Casebook'', p. 480.&lt;/ref&gt; There was no dishonor in being a concubine or living with a concubine, and a concubine could become a wife.&lt;ref&gt;Frier and McGinn, ''Casebook'', p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Gifts could be exchanged between the partners in concubinage, in contrast to marriage, which maintained a more defined separation of property.

Couples usually resorted to concubinage when inequality of social rank was an obstacle to marriage: for instance, a man of [[Roman senate|senatorial rank]], and a woman who was a social inferior, such as a freedwoman or one who had a questionable background of poverty or prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;Frier and McGinn, ''Casebook'', p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Two partners who lacked the right to the form of legal marriage known as ''[[Marriage in ancient Rome|conubium]]'' might enter into concubinage, or even a highborn woman who loved a man of low social status.&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Crook Law and Life of Rome 90 B.C.-212 A.D.&lt;/ref&gt; Concubinage differed from marriage chiefly in the status of children born from the relationship. Children had their mother's social rank, and not as was customary their father's.

====Domestic abuse====
[[File:Maenad and Cupid MAN Napoli Inv110591.jpg|thumb|A [[maenad]] with a [[cupid]] in her arms, fresco, 1st century AD]]
Classical Roman law did not allow any [[domestic abuse]] by a husband to his wife,&lt;ref&gt;''A casebook on Roman Family Law'', Frier and McGinn, pg. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; but as with any other crime, laws against domestic abuse can be assumed to fail to prevent it. [[Cato the Elder]] said, according to his biographer [[Plutarch]], "that the man who struck his wife or child, laid violent hands on the holiest of holy things. Also that he thought it more praiseworthy to be a good husband than a good senator."&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Cato the Elder'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cato_Major*.html#20.2 20.2.]&lt;/ref&gt; A man of status during the Roman Republic was expected to behave moderately toward his wife and to define himself as a good husband. Wife beating was sufficient grounds for divorce or other legal action against the husband.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett G. Fagan, "Violence in Roman Social Relations," in ''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations'' (Oxford University Press, 2011), p. 487.&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic abuse enters the historical record mainly when it involves the egregious excesses of the elite. The Emperor [[Nero]] was alleged to have had his first wife (and stepsister) [[Claudia Octavia]] murdered, after subjecting her to torture and imprisonment. Nero then married his pregnant mistress [[Poppaea Sabina]], whom he kicked to death for criticizing him.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, Annals XVI.6&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern historians believe that Poppaea died from a miscarriage or childbirth, and that the story was exaggerated to vilify Nero. The despised [[Commodus]] is supposed also to have killed his wife and his sister.&lt;ref&gt;Frank McLynn, ''Marcus Aurelius: A Life'', p. 435.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motherhood===
[[File:Sarcophagus Marcus Cornelius Statius Louvre Ma659 n1.jpg|thumb|left|Mother nursing an infant in the presence of the father, detail from a young boy's [[sarcophagus]] ''ca.'' 150 [[BCE|CE]]]]
Roman wives were expected to bear children, but the women of the aristocracy, accustomed to a degree of independence, showed a growing disinclination to devote themselves to traditional motherhood. By the 1st century [[BCE|CE]], most elite women avoided breast-feeding their infants themselves, and hired wet-nurses.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, "The Roman Family," p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was not uncommon as early as the 2nd century [[BCE]], when the comic playwright [[Plautus]] mentions wet-nurses casually.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plautus]], ''Miles Gloriosus'' 697.&lt;/ref&gt; Since a mother's milk was considered best for the baby,&lt;ref&gt;As noted by [[Soranus of Ephesus|Soranus]] (1st century AD) in his ''Gynaecology'' 2.18.&lt;/ref&gt; aristocratic women might still choose to breast-feed, unless physical reasons prevented it.&lt;ref&gt;Jane F. Gardner, ''Women in Roman Law and Society'' (Indiana University Press, 1991), p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; If a woman chose to forgo nursing her own child she could visit the [[Columna Lactaria]]  ("Milk Column"), where poor parents could obtain milk for their infants as charity from wet nurses, and those who could afford it could choose to hire a wet nurse.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Richardson, "A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome," (JHU Press, 1992), p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Licinia, the wife of [[Cato the Elder]] (d. 149 BCE), is reported to have nursed not only her son, but sometimes the infants of her slaves, to encourage "brotherly affection" among them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Cato the Elder'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cato_Major*.html#20.3 20.3]; Christopher Michael McDonough, "Carna, Procra and the ''Strix'' on the Kalends of June," ''Transactions of the American Philological Association'' 127 (1997), p. 322, note 29.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of [[Tacitus]] (d. 117 CE), breastfeeding by elite matrons was idealized as a practice of the virtuous old days.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''Dialogus'' 28, as noted by McDonough, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent to which Roman women might expect their husbands to participate in the rearing of very young children seems to vary and is hard to determine. Family-values traditionalists such as Cato appear to have taken an interest: Cato liked to be present when his wife bathed and swaddled their child.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Cato the Elder'' 20.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Large families were not the norm among the elite even by the [[Roman Republic#Late Republic (147 BCE - 30 BCE)|Late Republic]]; the family of [[Publius Clodius Pulcher|Clodius Pulcher]], who had at least three sisters and two brothers, was considered unusual.&lt;ref&gt;W. Jeffrey Tatum, ''The Patrician Tribune: Publius Clodius Pulcher'' (University of North Carolina Press, 1999), p. 33ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[birth rate]] among the aristocracy declined to such an extent that the first Roman emperor [[Augustus]] (reigned 27 BCE–14 CE) passed a series of laws intended to increase it, including special honors for women who bore at least three children (the ''[[Jus trium liberorum|ius trium liberorum]])''.&lt;ref&gt;Janine Assa, ''The Great Roman Ladies'' (New York, 1960), p. 32; ''A History of Women in the West from Ancient Goddesses to Christian Saints'', vol. 1, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who were unmarried, divorced, widowed, or barren were prohibited from inheriting property unless named in a will.&lt;ref&gt;Jane F. Gardner, ''Family and ''Familia'' in Roman Law and Life'' (Oxford University Press, 1999, 2004), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman women were not only valued for the number of children that they produced, but also for their part in raising and educating children to become good citizens. To rear children for successful lives, an exemplary Roman mother needed to be well-educated herself.&lt;ref&gt;Assa, ''The Great Roman Ladies'', p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the Roman women most famous for their strength and influence as a mother was [[Cornelia Africana|Cornelia]], the mother of the [[Gracchi]]. [[Julius Caesar]], whose father died when he was only a young teen, had a close relationship with his mother, [[Aurelia Cotta|Aurelia]], whose political clout was essential in preventing the execution of her 18-year-old son during the [[proscription]]s of [[Sulla]].

Aristocratic women managed a large and complex household. Since wealthy couples often owned multiple homes and country estates with dozens or even hundreds of slaves, some of whom were educated and highly skilled, this responsibility was the equivalent of running a small corporation. In addition to the social and political importance of entertaining [[hospitium|guests]], [[Patronage in ancient Rome|clients]], and visiting dignitaries from abroad, the husband held his morning business meetings (''salutatio'') at home.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Treggiari, ''Roman Marriage:'' Iusti Coniuges ''from the Time of Cicero to the Time of Ulpian'' (Oxford University Press, 1991, reprinted 2002), p. 420.&lt;/ref&gt; The home (''[[domus]]'') was also the center of the family's social identity, with ancestral portraits displayed in the entrance hall (''atrium''). Since the most ambitious aristocratic men were frequently away from home on military campaign or administrative duty in the [[Roman province|provinces]], sometimes for years at a time, the maintenance of the family's property and business decisions were often left to the wives; for instance, while [[Julius Caesar]] was away from Rome throughout the 50s BCE, his wife [[Calpurnia (wife of Caesar)|Calpurnia]] was responsible for taking care of his assets. When Ovid, Rome's greatest living poet, was exiled by [[Augustus]] in 8 CE, his wife exploited social connections and legal maneuvers to hold on to the family's property, on which their livelihood depended.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hermann Fränkel]], ''Ovid: A Poet between Two Worlds'' (University of California Press, 1956), p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; Ovid expresses his love and admiration for her lavishly in the poetry he wrote during his exile.&lt;ref&gt;Jo-Marie Claasen, "Tristia," in ''A Companion to Ovid'' (Blackwell, 2009), p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Frugality, parsimony, and austerity were characteristics of the virtuous matron.&lt;ref&gt;Assa, ''The Great Roman Ladies'', p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important tasks for women to oversee in a large household was clothing production. In the early Roman period, the spinning of wool was a central domestic occupation, and indicated a family's self-sufficiency, since the wool would be produced on their estates. Even in an urban setting, wool was often a symbol of a wife's duties, and equipment for spinning might appear on the funeral monument of a woman to show that she was a good and honorable matron.&lt;ref&gt;Assa, ''The Great Roman Ladies'', p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Even women of the upper classes were expected to be able to spin and weave in virtuous emulation of their rustic ancestors — a practice ostentatiously observed by [[Livia]].

===In business===
"One of the most curious characteristics of that age," observed French classical scholar [[Gaston Boissier]], "was that the women appear as much engaged in business and as interested in speculations as the men. Money is their first care. They work their estates, invest their funds, lend and borrow. We find one among Cicero's creditors, and two among his debtors."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaston Boissier]], ''Cicero and his friends: a study of Roman Society in the time of Caesar'', [https://www.questia.com/read/10552570?title=Cicero%20and%20His%20Friends%3a%20A%20Study%20of%20Roman%20Society%20in%20the%20Time%20of%20Caesar Questia edition.]&lt;/ref&gt; Although Roman society did not allow women to gain official political power, it did allow them to enter business.&lt;ref&gt;A Casebook on Roman Family Law Frier+McGinn pg 461&lt;/ref&gt;

Even women of wealth were not supposed to be idle ladies of leisure. Among the aristocracy, women as well as men lent money to their peers to avoid resorting to a moneylender. When Pliny was considering buying an estate, he factored in a loan from his mother-in-law as a guarantee rather than an option.&lt;ref&gt;Law and Life of Rome, J.A. Crook pg.172&lt;/ref&gt; Women also joined in funding public works, as is frequently documented by inscriptions during the Imperial period.  The "lawless" Politta, who appears in the ''Martyrdom of [[Pionius]]'', owned estates in the [[Asia (Roman province)|province of Asia]]. Inscriptions record her generosity in funding the renovation of the [[Sardis]] gymnasium.&lt;ref&gt;Christians and Pagans, Fox, Pg. 464&lt;/ref&gt;

Because women had the right to own property, they might engage in the same business transactions and management practices as any landowner. As with their male counterparts, their management of slaves appears to have varied from relative care to negligence and outright abuse. During the [[First Servile War]], Megallis and her husband Damophilus were both killed by their slaves on account of their brutality, but their daughter was spared because of her kindness and granted safe passage out of Sicily, along with an armed escort.&lt;ref&gt;The Gracchi Marius and Sulla, A.H. Beesley, pg. 21 on the first Serville War&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pompeii - Fullonica of Veranius Hypsaeus 2 - MAN.jpg|thumb|left|Women working alongside a man at a dye shop (''fullonica''), on a wall painting from Pompeii]]
Unlike landholding, industry was not considered an honorable profession for those of [[Roman senate|senatorial]] rank. [[Cicero]] suggested that in order to gain respectability a merchant should buy land. Attitudes changed during the Empire, however, and [[Claudius]] created legislation to encourage the upper classes to engage in shipping. Women of the upper classes are documented as owning and running shipping corporations.

Trade and manufacturing are not well represented in Roman literature, which was produced for and largely by the elite, but funerary inscriptions sometimes record the profession of the deceased, including women.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Ancient Roman Life as Illustrated by Latin Inscriptions'' by Brian K. Harvey.&lt;/ref&gt; Women are known to have owned and operated [[Roman brick|brick factories]].&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, Society and Politics in Ancient Rome: Essays and Sketches, pg. 98&lt;/ref&gt; A woman might develop skills to complement her husband's trade, or manage aspects of his business. Artemis the gilder was married to Dionysius the helmet maker, as indicated by a [[curse tablet]] asking for the destruction of their household, workshop, work, and livelihood.&lt;ref&gt;Women's life in Greece &amp; Rome, Lefkowitz+Fant, pg. 171&lt;/ref&gt; The status of ordinary women who owned a business seems to have been regarded as exceptional. Laws during the Imperial period aimed at punishing women for adultery exempted those "who have charge of any business or shop" from prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius Paulus Prudentissimus|Paul]], ''Opinions'' 2.26.11 L, as cited in ''Women's Life in Greece and Rome: A Source Book in Translation'', edited by Mary R. Lefkowitz and Maureen B. Fant (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1982, 3rd ed. 2005), p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some typical occupations for a woman would be [[wet nurse]], [[Theatre of ancient Rome|actress]], dancer or acrobat, [[Prostitution in ancient Rome|prostitute]], and [[midwife]] — not all of equal respectability.&lt;ref&gt;"Women and Marriage in Ancient Rome," [http://womenshistory.about.com/cs/ancientrome/a/roman_wm_10101b.htm Chapter 1]; Jane Bingham,''The Usborne Internet-Linked Encyclopedia of The Roman World'' (Usborne, 2002), page 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitutes and performers such as actresses were stigmatized as ''[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Pleasure and infamy|infames]]'', people who had recourse to few legal protections even if they were free.&lt;ref&gt;Catharine Edwards, "Unspeakable Professions: Public Performance and Prostitution in Ancient Rome," in ''Roman Sexualities'' (Princeton University Press, 1997), pp. 66ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Inscriptions indicate that a woman who was a wet nurse (''nutrix'') would be quite proud of her occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Celia E. Schultz, ''Women's Religious Activity in the Roman Republic'' (University of North Carolina Press, 2006), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Women could be scribes and secretaries, including "girls trained for beautiful writing," that is, [[calligraphy|calligraphers]].&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, ''Children and Childhood in Roman Italy'', p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] gives a list of female artists and their paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''Natural History'', 35.147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Romans lived in ''[[insula (building)|insulae]]'' (apartment buildings), and those housing the poorer [[plebs|plebeian]] and [[Peregrinus (Roman)|non-citizen]] families usually lacked kitchens. The need to buy prepared food meant that takeaway food was a thriving business. Most of the Roman poor, whether male or female, young or old, earned a living through their own labour.

===In politics===
[[File:Le Suicide de Porcia.JPG|thumb|The heroic suicide of [[Porcia Catonis|Porcia]], daughter of [[Cato the Younger|Cato]] and wife of [[Marcus Brutus|Brutus]], as pictured by [[Pierre Mignard]]]]
Men argued firmly to block women from engaging in the [[public sphere]]. The political system in ancient Rome involved men exclusively—from senators to magistrates. Women were even prevented from voting. They were not seen as fit to be part of the political sphere as men believed them to be only suited for "elegance, adornment, and finery."&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; However, elite women could manipulate their husbands and through them exercise control over the political world. In some cases, women were viewed as a threat to male rule. [[Cato the Elder|Cato the elder]] went so far as to prevent boys from attending senatorial meetings in fear that they would relay the news to their inquisitive mothers.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fathers and Daughters in Roman Society|last=Hallet|first=Judith|publisher=Princeton University|year=1984|isbn=|location=Princeton, New Jersey|pages=8, 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the civil wars that ended the Republic, [[Appian]] reports the heroism of wives who saved their husbands.  An [[epitaph]] known as the ''[[Laudatio Turiae]]'' preserves a husband's [[laudatio funebris|eulogy]] for his wife, who during the [[Liberators' civil war|civil war following the death of Julius Caesar]] endangered her own life and relinquished her jewelry to send support to her husband in exile.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Ernest Gordon, ''Illustrated Introduction to Latin Epigraphy'' (University of California Press, 1983), pp. 34, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Both survived the turbulence of the time to enjoy a long marriage. [[Porcia Catonis|Porcia]], the daughter of [[Cato the Younger]] and wife of [[Marcus Brutus|Brutus]] the [[assassination of Julius Caesar|assassin]], came to a less fortunate but (in the eyes of her time) heroic end: she killed herself as the Republic collapsed, just as her father did.

The rise of [[Augustus]] to sole power in the last decades of the 1st century BCE diminished the power of political officeholders and the [[Roman senate|traditional oligarchy]], but did nothing to diminish and arguably increased the opportunities for women, as well as slaves and [[freedmen]], to exercise influence behind the scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Saller, "Status and patronage", ''Cambridge Ancient History: The High Empire, A.D. 70–192'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Before this point, women's political power was extremely curtailed compared to the power men held by preventing their right to vote. However, starting with Augustus' rule, the inability to vote no longer mattered because the senate lost its power. Additionally, the shift from the forum to the palace allowed for women who lived there to gain an upper hand in influencing politics.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;

One notable woman was [[Livia Drusilla]] [[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]] (58 BCE – CE 29),  the wife of [[Augustus]] and the most powerful woman in the [[Principate|early Roman Empire]], acting several times as regent and being Augustus' faithful advisor. Several women of the Imperial family, such as Livia's great-granddaughter and Caligula's sister [[Agrippina the Younger]], gained political influence as well as public prominence.

Women also participated in efforts to overthrow the emperors who abused their power. Shortly after [[Caligula]]'s sister [[Drusilla (sister of Caligula)|Drusilla]] died, her widower [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (executed 39)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]] and her sisters [[Agrippina the Younger]] and [[Livilla (sister of Caligula)|Livilla]] conspired to overthrow Caligula. The plot was discovered, and Lepidus was executed. Agrippina and Livilla were exiled, and returned from exile only when their paternal uncle Claudius came to power after Caligula's assassination in 41 CE.

Women could also be motivated by less than noble causes. Claudius's third wife [[Valeria Messalina]] conspired with [[Gaius Silius]] to overthrow her husband in the hope of installing herself and her lover in power.

[[Tacitus]] immortalized the woman [[Epicharis (Pisonian conspirator)|Epicharis]] for her part in the [[Pisonian conspiracy]], where she attempted to gain the support of the Roman fleet and was instead arrested.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, Annals 15.51&lt;/ref&gt; Once the conspiracy was uncovered, she would reveal nothing even under torture, in contrast to the senators, who were not subjected to torture and yet raced to spill the details. Tacitus also praises Egnatia Maximilla for sacrificing her fortune in order to stand by her innocent husband against Nero.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, Annals 15.71.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women and the military===
Classical texts have little to say about women and the Roman army. Emperor Augustus (reigned 27 BC–AD 14) disallowed marriage by ordinary soldiers, a ban that lasted nearly two centuries. However it has been suggested  that  wives and children of centurions lived with them at border and provincial forts.&lt;ref&gt;Allison P. (2011) 'Soldiers’ families in the early Roman Empire', in B. Rawson, ed., Family and household in ancient Greece and Rome: a companion, 161–182. Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt;  Shoes in women's and children's sizes were found at Vindolanda&lt;ref&gt;Greene, E.M. (2014). “If the shoe fits: Style and function of children’s shoes from Vindolanda” in R. Collins and F. McIntosh (eds.), Life in the Limes: Studies of the People and Objects of the Roman Frontiers. Oxford: Oxbow. 29–36.&lt;/ref&gt; (site of a Roman fort on Hadrian's wall in northern England), along with bronze plaques, awarded to provincial soldiers whose 25 years of service earned them Roman citizenship, that mention their wives and children. Likewise, in Germany, further evidence of this practice was discovered in the form of brooches and shoes. [[Trajan's Column]] depicts six women amongst the soldiers who are attendants holding sacrificial offerings at a military religious ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, E.M. (2015) 'Girls or Boys on the Column of Trajan? Depictions of Female Participation in Military Religion' presented at 116th Joint Annual Meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America and the Society for Classical Studies (formerly the American Philological Association), January 8–11, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious life===
[[File:House of the Vestals 2.jpg|thumb|300px|Ruins of the [[House of the Vestals]], with pedestals for [[Roman sculpture|statuary]] in the foreground]]
Women were present at most [[Roman festivals]] and cult observances. Some rituals specifically required the presence of women, but their participation might be limited. As a rule women did not perform [[animal sacrifice]], the central rite of most major public ceremonies,&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, ''Religions of Rome: A History'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), vol. 1, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; though this was less a matter of prohibition than the fact that most priests presiding over state religion were men.&lt;ref&gt;Celia E. Schultz, ''Women's Religious Activity in the Roman Republic'' (University of North Carolina Press, 2006), pp. 134–136. In some sense, every head of household was a priest responsible for religious maintenance at home; in Roman patriarchal society, this was the ''paterfamilias''. Public religion, like society and politics in general, reflected the hierarchy of the household, since the ''familia'' was the building block of society. See John Scheid, ''An Introduction to Roman Religion'' (Indiana University Press, 2003), p. 129ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Some cult practices were reserved for women only, for example, the rites of the Good Goddess ([[Bona Dea]]).&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al''., ''Religions of Rome'', vol. 1, pp. 296–297.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women priests played a prominent and crucial role in the official [[Religion in ancient Rome|religion of Rome]]. Although the state [[collegium (ancient Rome)|colleges]] of male priests were far more numerous, the six women of the [[Vestal Virgin|college of Vestals]] were Rome's only "full-time professional clergy."&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Culham, "Women in the Roman Republic," in ''The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic'' (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacerdos|Sacerdos]]'', plural ''sacerdotes'', was the Latin word for a priest of [[grammatical gender|either gender]]. Religious titles for women include ''sacerdos'', often in relation to a deity or temple, such as a ''sacerdos Cereris'' or ''Cerealis'', "priestess of [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]]", an office never held by men;&lt;ref&gt;Barbette Stanley Spaeth, ''The Roman Goddess Ceres'' (University of Texas Press, 1996), p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; ''magistra'', a high priestess, female expert or teacher in religious matters; and ''ministra'', a female assistant, particularly one in service to a deity. A ''magistra'' or ''ministra'' would have been responsible for the regular maintenance of a cult. Epitaphs provide the main evidence for these priesthoods, and the woman is often not identified in terms of her marital status.&lt;ref&gt;Lesley E. Lundeen, "In Search of the Etruscan Priestess: A Re-Examination of the ''hatrencu''," in ''Religion in Republican Italy'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 46; Schultz, ''Women's Religious Activity in the Roman Republic'', pp. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vestals possessed unique religious distinction, public status and privileges, and could exercise considerable political influence. It was also possible for them to amass "considerable wealth."&lt;ref&gt;Ariadne Staples, ''From Good Goddess to Vestal Virgins: Sex and Category in Roman Religion'' (Routledge, 1998), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering her office, a Vestal was emancipated from her father's authority. In archaic Roman society, these priestesses were the only women not required to be under the legal guardianship of a man, instead answering directly and only to the [[Pontifex Maximus]].&lt;ref&gt;Gary Forsythe, ''A Critical History of Early Rome: From Prehistory to the First Punic War'' (University of California Press, 2005, 2006), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Their vow of chastity freed them of the traditional obligation to marry and rear children, but its violation carried a heavy penalty: a Vestal found to have polluted her office by breaking her vow was given food, water, and entombed alive. The independence of the Vestals thus existed in relation to the prohibitions imposed on them. In addition to conducting certain religious rites, the Vestals participated at least symbolically in every official sacrifice, as they were responsible for preparing the required ritual substance ''[[mola salsa]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Staples, ''From Good Goddess to Vestal Virgins,'' pp. 154–155.&lt;/ref&gt; The Vestals seem to have retained their religious and social distinctions well into the 4th century CE, until the Christian emperors dissolved the order.

A few priesthoods were held jointly by married couples. Marriage was a requirement for the [[Flamen Dialis]], the high priest of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]; his wife, the Flaminica Dialis, had her own unique priestly attire, and like her husband was placed under obscure magico-religious prohibitions. The flaminica was a perhaps exceptional case of a woman performing animal sacrifice; she offered a ram to Jupiter on each of the ''[[Roman calendar#Nundinal cycle|nundinae]]'', the eight-day Roman cycle comparable to a [[week]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' 1.16.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple were not permitted to divorce, and if the flaminica died the flamen had to resign his office.

[[File:Arte romana, triade capitolina, 160-180 dc (guidonia montecelio, museo civico archeologico) 01.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Capitoline Triad]] of Minerva, Jupiter, and Juno]]
Like the Flaminica Dialis, the ''[[regina sacrorum]]'', "queen of the sacred rites," wore distinctive ceremonial dress and performed animal sacrifice, offering a sow or female lamb to Juno on the [[Kalends|first day of each month]].&lt;ref&gt;Emily A. Hemelrijk, "Women and Sacrifice in the Roman Empire," in ''Ritual Dynamics and Religious Change in the Roman Empire. Proceedings of the Eighth Workshop of the International Network Impact of Empire (Heidelberg, July 5–7, 2007)'' (Brill, 2009), pp. 258–259, citing [[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' 1.15.19.&lt;/ref&gt; The names of some ''reginae sacrorum'' are recorded by [[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|inscriptions]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jörg Rüpke]], ''Fasti sacerdotum: A Prosopography of Pagan, Jewish, and Christian Religious Officials in the City of Rome, 300 BCE to CE 499'' (Oxford University Press, 2008, originally published in German 2005), pp. 223, 783, 840.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''regina'' was the wife of the ''[[rex sacrorum]]'', "king of the sacred rites," an archaic priesthood regarded in the earliest period as more prestigious than even the Pontifex Maximus.&lt;ref&gt;Forsythe, ''A Critical History of Early Rome'', p. 136, based on [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] on the ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#ordo sacerdotum|ordo sacerdotum]]'' (hierarchy of priests), 198 in the edition of Lindsay.&lt;/ref&gt;

These highly public official duties for women contradict the commonplace notion that women in ancient Rome took part only in private or domestic religion. The dual male-female priesthoods may reflect the Roman tendency to seek a gender complement within the religious sphere;&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, ''Women's Religious Activity in the Roman Republic'', pp. 79–81.&lt;/ref&gt; most divine powers are represented by both a [[List of Roman deities|male and a female deity]], as seen in divine pairs such as [[Liber]] and [[Libera (mythology)|Libera]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lipka, ''Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach'' (Brill, 2009), pp. 141–142 [https://books.google.com/books?id=1zGZQnqWH2MC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;dq=%22gods+were+differentiated+according+to+sex%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yWOjTYL0LeOx0QHpxJWBBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22gods%20were%20differentiated%20according%20to%20sex%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dii Consentes|twelve major gods]] were presented as six gender-balanced pairs,&lt;ref&gt;[[Varro]], ''De re rustica'' 1.1.4, says their golden images stood in the forum, "six male and the same number of female."&lt;/ref&gt; and Roman religion departed from [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European tradition]] in installing two goddesses in its [[Capitoline Triad|supreme triad]] of [[tutelary deity|patron deities]], Juno and [[Minerva]] along with Jupiter. This triad "formed the core of Roman religion."&lt;ref&gt;The Capitoline Triad replaced the Indo-European [[Archaic Triad]], composed of three male gods, and is thought to result from [[Etruscan religion|Etruscan influence]]; see Robert Schilling, ''Roman and European Mythologies'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981), pp. 73, 87, 131, 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pompeii - Villa del Cicerone - Mosaic - MAN.jpg|thumb|Mosaic depicting masked actors in a play: two women consult a "witch" or private [[divination|diviner]]]]
From the [[Roman Republic#Mid-Republic (274–148 BCE)|Mid Republic]] onward, religious diversity became increasingly characteristic of the city of Rome. Many religions that were not part of Rome's earliest state cult offered leadership roles for women, among them the cult of [[Isis#Greco-Roman world|Isis]] and of the [[Cybele|Magna Mater]]. An epitaph preserves the title ''sacerdos maxima'' for a woman who held the highest priesthood of the Magna Mater's temple near the current site of [[St. Peter's Basilica]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen L. Dyson, ''Rome: A Living Portrait of an Ancient City'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2010), p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although less documented than public religion, private religious practices addressed aspects of life that were exclusive to women. At a time when the [[infant mortality rate]] was as high as 40 percent,&lt;ref&gt;M. Golden, "Did the Ancients Care When Their Children Died?" ''Greece &amp; Rome'' 35 (1988) 152–163.&lt;/ref&gt; divine aid was solicited for the life-threatening act of giving birth and the perils of caring for a baby. Invocations were directed at the goddesses [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], [[Lucina (goddess)|Lucina]], the ''[[di nixi]]'', and a host of [[List of Roman birth and childhood deities|divine attendants devoted to birth and childrearing]].

Male writers vary in their depiction of women's religiosity: some represent women as paragons of Roman virtue and devotion, but also inclined by temperament to excessive religious devotion, the lure of [[Magic in the Greco-Roman world|magic]], or "[[Religion in ancient Rome#Superstitio and magic|superstition]]."&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al''., ''Religions of Rome'', vol. 1, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; Nor was "private" the same as "secret": Romans were suspicious of secretive religious practices, and Cicero cautioned that nocturnal sacrifices were not to be performed by women, except for those ritually prescribed ''pro populo'', on behalf of the Roman people, that is, for the public good.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De legibus'' 2.9.21; Emily A. Hemelrijk, "Women and Sacrifice in the Roman Empire," in ''Ritual Dynamics and Religious Change in the Roman Empire. Proceedings of the Eighth Workshop of the International Network Impact of Empire (Heidelberg, July 5–7, 2007)'' (Brill, 2009), p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social activities===
[[File:Casale Bikini.jpg|thumb|Mosaic showing Roman women in various recreational activities]]
Wealthy women traveled around the city in a [[Litter (vehicle)|litter]] carried by slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Assa, ''The Great Roman Ladies'', p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Women gathered in the streets on a daily basis to meet with friends, attend religious rites at [[Roman temple|temples]], or to visit the [[thermae|baths]]. The wealthiest families had private baths at home, but most people went to bath houses not only to wash but to socialize, as the larger facilities offered a range of services and recreational activities, among which [[casual sex]] was not excluded. One of the most vexed questions of Roman social life is whether the sexes bathed together in public. Until the late Republic, evidence suggests that women usually bathed in a separate wing or facility, or that women and men were scheduled at different times. But there is also clear evidence of [[mixed bathing]] from the late Republic until the rise of Christian dominance in the later Empire. Some scholars have thought that only lower-class women bathed with men, or those of dubious moral standing such as entertainers or prostitutes, but [[Clement of Alexandria]] observed that women of the highest social classes could be seen naked at the baths. [[Hadrian]] prohibited mixed bathing, but the ban seems not to have endured. Most likely, customs varied not only by time and place, but by facility, so that women could choose to segregate themselves by gender or not.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett G. Fagan, ''Bathing in Public in the Roman World'' (University of Michigan Press, 1999, 2002), pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

For entertainment women could attend debates at the Forum, the public games (''[[ludi]]''), [[chariot races]], and theatrical performances. By the late Republic, they regularly attended dinner parties, though in earlier times the women of a household dined in private together.&lt;ref&gt;Assa, ''The Great Roman Ladies'', p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Conservatives such as [[Cato the Elder]] (234–149 BCE) considered it improper for women to take a more active role in public life; his complaints indicated that indeed some women did voice their opinions in the public sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Livius, Titus, A History of Rome, (Indianapolis, IN: Hackett Pub, 2006), 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the practice was discouraged, Roman generals would sometimes take their wives with them on [[military campaign]]s. [[Caligula]]'s mother [[Agrippina the Elder]] often accompanied her husband [[Germanicus]] on his campaigns in northern Germania, and the emperor [[Claudius]] was born in [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]] for this reason. Wealthy women might tour the empire, often participating or viewing religious ceremonies and sites around the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Assa, 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Rich women traveled to the countryside during the summer when Rome became too hot.&lt;ref&gt;Assa, 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attire and adornment===

{{see also|Cosmetics in Ancient Rome|l1=Cosmetics in ancient Rome|Clothing in ancient Rome}}
Women in ancient Rome took great care in their appearance, though extravagance was frowned upon. They wore cosmetics and made different concoctions for their skin. [[Ovid]] even wrote a [[Medicamina Faciei Femineae|poem about the correct application of makeup]]. Women used white [[chalk]] or [[arsenic]] to whiten their faces, or rouge made of lead or [[carmine]] to add color to their cheeks as well as using lead to highlight their eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Assa, 65.&lt;/ref&gt; They spent much time arranging their hair and often dyed it black, red, or blonde. They also wore wigs regularly.&lt;ref&gt;Assa, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Matrons usually wore two simple tunics for undergarments covered by a ''[[stola]]''. The ''stola'' was a long white dress that was cinched at the waist and which fell to the wearer’s feet, secured by clasps at the shoulder. Wealthier women would decorate their ''stola'' further.  When going out a woman wore a ''[[Palla (garment)|palla]]'' over her ''stola'', which was held by a clasp at the shoulder.&lt;ref&gt;Assa, 65&lt;/ref&gt; Young women were not permitted to wear a ''stola'', and instead wore tunics.&lt;ref&gt;Assa, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitutes and those caught committing adultery put on the male [[toga]].&lt;ref name="FaraoneMcClure2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christopher A. Faraone|author2=Laura K. McClure|title=Prostitutes and Courtesans in the Ancient World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kxOLn0IoGhAC&amp;pg=PA6|accessdate=3 April 2013|date=14 March 2008|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-21313-8|pages=6–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wealthy women wore jewels such as [[emerald]]s, [[aquamarine (gemstone)|aquamarine]], [[opal]], and [[pearl]]s as earrings, [[necklace]]s, rings and sometimes sewn onto their shoes and clothing.&lt;ref&gt;Assa, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Matronalivia2.jpg|thumb|150px|Exaggerated hairstyle of the [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian period]] (80s–90s CE)]]
In the aftermath of Roman defeat at [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]], economic crisis provoked the passing of the [[Lex Oppia]] (215 BCE) to restrict personal and public extravagance. The law limited women's possession and display of gold and silver (as money or personal ornament), expensive clothing and their "unnecessary" use of chariots and litters. Victory over [[Carthage]] flooded Rome with wealth and in 195 BCE the Lex Oppia was reviewed. The ruling consul, [[Cato the Censor]] argued for its retention: personal morality and self-restraint were self-evidently inadequate controls on indulgence and luxury. Luxury provoked the envy and shame of those less well-off, and was therefore divisive. Roman women, in Cato's view, had showed only too clearly that their appetites once corrupted knew no limits, and must be restrained. Large numbers of Roman matrons thought otherwise, and made concerted public protest. In 193 BCE the laws were abolished: Cato's opposition did not harm his political career. Later, in 42 BCE, Roman women, led by [[Hortensia (orator)|Hortensia]], successfully protested against laws designed to tax Roman women, by use of the argument of [[no taxation without representation]].&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, Sarah Jane, ''Women in Classical Antiquity''&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of a lessening on luxury restrictions can also be found; one of the Letters of Pliny is addressed to the woman Pompeia Celerina praising the luxuries she keeps in her villa.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Younger, Letters, Book 1 letter IV&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on Roman art and literature, [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Breasts|small breasts]] and wide hips were the ideal body type for women considered alluring by Roman men.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Olson, "The Appearance of the Young Roman Girl," in ''Roman Dress and the Fabrics of Roman Culture'' (University of Toronto Press, 2008), p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Roman art from the [[Augustus|Augustan period]] shows idealized women as substantial and fleshy, with a full abdomen and breasts that are rounded,&lt;ref&gt;John R. Clarke, ''Looking at Lovemaking: Constructions of Sexuality in Roman Art 100 B.C.–A.D. 250'' (University of California Press, 1998, 2001), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; not pendulous.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus: Sexuality and Aggression in Roman Humor'' (Oxford University Press, 1983, 1992), pp. 68, 110.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prostitution in ancient Rome|Prostitutes]] depicted in [[erotic art in Pompeii and Herculaneum|Roman erotic art]] have fleshy bodies and wide hips, and often have their breasts covered by a ''strophium'' (a sort of strapless bra) even when otherwise nude and performing sex acts.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, ''Looking at Lovemaking,'' p. 34 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; Large breasts were mocked as humorous or a sign of old age.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martial]], ''Epigrams'' 1.100, 2.52, 14.66; Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus'', pp. 52, 54, 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Young girls wore a ''strophium'' secured tightly in the belief that it would inhibit the growth of breasts,&lt;ref&gt;Olson, "The Appearance of the Young Roman Girl," p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; and a regimen of massaging the breasts with [[Conium#Uses and effects|hemlock]], begun while a woman was still a virgin, was thought to prevent sagging.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''Natural History'' 25.95, citing [[Anaxilaus]], a [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] physician in the time of Augustus; Matthew W. Dickie, ''Magic and Magicians in the Greco-Roman World'' (Routledge, 2001, 2005), p. 167. Pliny also notes that an application of hemlock was used to suppress [[lactation]].&lt;/ref&gt; Breasts receive relatively minimal attention in erotic art and literature as a sexual focus;&lt;ref&gt;Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus'', p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; the breast was associated primarily with nursing infants and a woman's role as a mother.&lt;ref&gt;Larissa Bonfante, "Nursing Mothers in Classical Art," in ''Naked Truths: Women, Sexuality, and Gender in Classical Art and Archaeology'' (Routledge, 1997, 2000), pp. 174ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In times of extreme emotional duress, such as mourning or captivity in wartime, women might bare their breasts as an [[apotropaic]] gesture.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Corbeill, ''Nature Embodied: Gesture in Ancient Rome'' (Princeton University Press, 2004), p. 87ff.; [[Alan Cameron (classical scholar)|Alan Cameron]], ''The Last Pagans of Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 2011), p. 725; [[Mary Lefkowitz]] and Maureen B. Fant, ''Women's Life in Greece and Rome'', p. 350, note 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Mos maiorum'' and the love poets===
{{See also|Sexuality in ancient Rome}}
[[File:Roman mosaic- Love Scene - Centocelle - Rome - KHM - Vienna.jpg|thumb|300px|Romantic scene from a mosaic (Villa at Centocelle, Rome, 20 BCE–20 CE)]]
During the late Republic penalties for sexuality were barely enforced if at all,&lt;ref&gt;Citation needed&lt;/ref&gt; and a new erotic ideal of romantic relationship emerges. Subverting the tradition of male dominance, the love poets of the late Republic and [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan era]] declared their eagerness to submit to "love slavery" (''servitium amoris''). [[Catullus]] addresses a number of poems to "Lesbia," a married woman with whom he has an affair, usually identified as a fictionalized [[Claudia Pulchra (wife of Metellus)|Clodia]], sister of the prominent [[populares|popularist]] politician [[Clodius Pulcher]]. The affair ends badly, and Catullus's declarations of love turn to attacks on her sexual appetites — rhetoric that accords with the other hostile source on Clodia's behavior, [[Cicero]]'s ''[[Pro Caelio]]''.

In ''[[Ars Amatoria|The Art of Love]]'', [[Ovid]] goes a step further, adopting the genre of [[didactic poetry]] for offering instruction in how to pursue, keep, and get over a lover. Satirists such as [[Juvenal]] complain about the dissolute behavior of women.&lt;ref&gt;Juvenal, Satire VI lines 6.286–313&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gynecology and medicine===
The practices and views in the ''[[Hippocratic Corpus]]'' regarding women's bodies and their perceived weaknesses were inadequate for addressing the needs of women in the [[Hellenistic]] and Roman eras, when women led active lives and more often engaged in [[family planning]]. The [[physiology]] of women began to be seen as less alien to that of men.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Ellis Hanson, "The Restructuring of Female Physiology at Rome," in ''Les écoles médicales à Rome'' (Université de Nantes, 1991), p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; In the older tradition, [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]], [[pregnancy]], and [[childbirth]] were not only central to [[women's health]], but the ''[[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]]'' for female physiology;&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, "The Restructuring of Female Physiology," p. 259–260; Marilyn B. Skinner, introduction to ''Roman Sexualities'' (Princeton University Press, 1997), p. 11: The "notion of women as 'Same' as well as 'Other' presupposed a female body partly assimilated to the male constitution, one whose sex-specific functions, such as [[lactation]] or even pregnancy, did not constitute its entire raison d'être."&lt;/ref&gt; men, by contrast, were advised to exercise moderation in their sexual behavior, since [[hypersexuality]] would cause disease and fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, "The Restructuring of Female Physiology," pp. 259–260.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pompeii - Casa del Chirurgo - Paintress - MAN.jpg|thumb|left|A female artist paints a statue of the phallic god [[Priapus]]]]
The Hippocratic view that [[amenorrhea]] was fatal became by Roman times a specific issue of [[infertility]], and was recognized by most Roman medical writers as a likely result when women engage in intensive physical regimens for extended periods of time. Balancing food, exercise, and sexual activity came to be regarded as a choice that women might make. The observation that intensive training was likely to result in amenorrhea implies that there were women who engaged in such regimens.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, "The Restructuring of Female Physiology," p. 260. The ''Gynecology'' of [[Soranus of Ephesus|Soranus]] is central to Hanson's arguments.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Roman era, medical writers saw a place for exercise in the lives of women in sickness and health. [[Soranus of Ephesus|Soranus]] recommends playing ball, swimming, walking, reading aloud, riding in vehicles, and travel as recreation, which would promote overall good health.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, "The Restructuring of Female Physiology," p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; In examining the causes of undesired childlessness, these later [[gynecology|gynecological]] writers include information about sterility in men, rather than assuming some defect in the woman only.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, "The Restructuring of Female Physiology," p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hypersexuality was to be avoided by women as well as men. An enlarged [[clitoris]], like an [[phallus|oversized phallus]],&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, "The Restructuring of Female Physiology," p. 267, citing ''[[Priapea]]'' 78 on the vitiating effects of uncontrolled sexual activity and releasing too much semen, and ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' 12.6721(5), one of the [[Perusia|Perusine]] ''[[Sling (weapon)#Ammunition|glandes]]''. The outsized phallus of [[Roman art]] was associated with the god [[Priapus]], among others. It was laughter-provoking, grotesque, or used for magical purposes; see David Fredrick, ''The Roman Gaze: Vision, Power, and the Body'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002), p. 156. Nude statues of men that were intended to be beautiful or dignified had a small penis.&lt;/ref&gt; was considered a symptom of excessive sexuality. Although Hellenistic and Roman medical and other writers refer to [[clitoridectomy]] as primarily an "Egyptian" custom, gynecological manuals under the Christian Empire in [[late antiquity]] propose that hypersexuality could be treated by surgery or repeated childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, "The Restructuring of Female Physiology," p. 267. Clitoridectomy is described in some detail by the Byzantine physicians and medical writers [[Aëtius of Amida]] (''[[wikt:floruit|fl.]]'' mid-5th century/mid-6th century) and [[Paul of Aegina]], as well as the [[Africa (Roman province)|North African]] gynecological writer [[Muscio]] (''ca.'' 500 CE); see Holt N. Parker, "The Teratogenic Grid," in ''Roman Sexualities'' (Princeton University Press, 1997), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slavery==

Freedwomen were [[manumission|manumitted]] slaves. A freed slave owed a period of service, the terms of which might be agreed upon as a precondition of freedom, to her former owner, who became her [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patron]]. The patron had obligations in return, such as paying for said services and helping in legal matters. The [[patron-client relationship]] was one of the fundamental social structures of ancient Rome, and failure to fulfill one's obligations brought disapproval and censure.

In most ways, freedwomen had the same legal status as freeborn women. But because under Roman law a slave had no father, freed slaves had no inheritance rights unless they were named in a will.

The relationship of a former slave to her patron could be complicated. In one legal case, a woman named Petronia Iusta attempted to show — without a birth declaration to prove it — that she had been free-born. Her mother, she acknowledged, had been a slave in the household of Petronius Stephanus and Calatoria Themis, but Iusta maintained that she had been born after her mother's manumission. Calatoria, by now a widow, in turn argued that Iusta was born before her mother was free and that she had been manumitted, therefore owing her former owner the service due a patron. Calatoria could produce no documentation of this supposed manumission, and the case came down to the testimony of witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Crook, ''Law and Life of Rome 90 B.C.-A.D. 212'' (Cornell University Press, 1967, 1984), pp. 48–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Uneducated or unskilled slaves had few opportunities to earn their freedom, and if they became free would lack means of supporting themselves. Therefore, a freedwoman in the workplace could have the advantage in training and skill over a woman born to a free family of [[working poor]].&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, ''Children and Childhood in Roman Italy'', p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

The status of freedwomen, like freedmen, varied widely. [[Caenis]] was a freedwoman and secretary to the Emperor [[Vespasian]]; she was also his concubine. He is said to have lived with her faithfully, but she was not considered a wife.&lt;ref&gt;Crook, ''Law and Life of Rome'', p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prostitution==
{{Main|Prostitution in ancient Rome}}
Women could turn to prostitution to support themselves, but not all prostitutes had freedom to decide. There is some evidence that even slave prostitutes could benefit from their labor.&lt;ref&gt;The Economy of Prostitution in the Roman World: A Study of social History and the Brothel By Thomas A. McGinn. pg. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Although rape was a crime, the law only punished the rape of a slave if it "damaged the goods," because a slave had no legal standing. The penalty was aimed at providing her owner compensation for the "damage" of his property. Because a slave woman was considered property under Roman law, forcing her to be a prostitute was not considered a crime. Prior to [[Septimius Severus]], women who engaged in acts that brought ''infamia'' to them as slaves also suffered ''infamia'' when freed.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas AJ McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'', Oxford University Press. 1998, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes sellers of female slaves attached a ''ne serva'' clause to the slave to prevent her from being prostituted. The Ne Serva clause meant that if the new owner or any owner after him or her used the slave as a prostitute she would be free. Later on the ''ne serva'' agreements became enforceable by law.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas AJ McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'', Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitution was not limited to slaves or poor citizens; according to Suetonius, Caligula when converting his palace into a brothel employed upper class "matrons and youths" as prostitutes. Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula, Tacitus records that during one of Nero's feasts the prefect [[Tigellinus]] had brothels filled with upper class women.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, Annals 15.37&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitution could also be a punishment instead of an occupation; a law of Augustus allowed that women guilty of adultery could be sentenced to work in brothels as prostitutes. The law was abolished in 389.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas AJ McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'', Oxford University Press, 1998, pp. 171, 310.&lt;/ref&gt;
