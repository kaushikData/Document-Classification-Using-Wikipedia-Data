'''Apophatic theology''', also known as '''negative theology''',{{sfn|McCombs|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=_cbuGVI_UNAC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=%22negative+theology%22%22apophatic+theology%22%22via+negativa%22%22via+negationis%22 84]}} is a form of [[theology|theological]] thinking and religious practice which attempts to [[Problem of religious language|approach God]], the Divine, by [[negation]], to speak only in terms of what may not be said about the perfect goodness that is [[God]].{{r|Bunnin_Yu|group=web}} It forms a pair together with [[cataphatic theology]], which approaches God or the Divine by affirmations or positive statements about what God ''is''.{{r|DC_interview|group=web}}

The apophatic tradition is often, though not always, allied with the approach of [[mysticism]], which aims at the vision of God, the perception of the divine reality beyond the realm of [[Perception|ordinary perception]].{{sfn|Belzen|Geels|2003|p=84–87}}

==Etymology and definition==
"Apophatic", {{lang-grc|ἀπόφασις}} ([[adjective]]); from ἀπόφημι ''apophēmi'', meaning "to deny". From ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]'': 
{{quote|apophatic (adj.) "involving a mention of something one feigns to deny; involving knowledge obtained by negation", 1850, from Latinized form of Greek ''apophatikos'', from apophasis "denial, negation", from apophanai "to speak off," from apo "off, away from" (see apo-) + phanai "to speak," related to pheme "voice," from PIE root *bha- (2) "to speak, tell, say."{{r|OED|group=web}}}}

''Via negativa'' or ''via negationis'' ([[Latin]]), "negative way" or "by way of denial".{{sfn|McCombs|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=_cbuGVI_UNAC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=%22negative+theology%22%22apophatic+theology%22%22via+negativa%22%22via+negationis%22 84]}} The negative way forms a pair together with the ''[[kataphatic]]'' or positive way. According to Deirdre Carabine,
{{quote|Dionysius describes the kataphatic or affirmative way to the divine as the "way of speech": that we can come to some understanding of the Transcendent by attributing all the perfections of the created order to God as its source. In this sense, we can say "God is Love", "God is Beauty", "God is Good". The apophatic or negative way stresses God's absolute transcendence and unknowability in such a way that we cannot say anything about the divine essence because God is so totally beyond being. The dual concept of the immanence and transcendence of God can help us to understand the simultaneous truth of both "ways" to God: at the same time as God is immanent, God is also transcendent. At the same time as God is knowable, God is also unknowable. God cannot be thought of as one or the other only.{{r|DC_interview|group=web}}}}

==Origins and development==
According to Fagenblat, "negative theology is as old as philosophy itself;" elements of it can be found in Plato's "unwritten doctrines," while it is also present in Neo-Platonic, Gnostic and early Christian writers. A tendency to apophatic thought can also be found in [[Philo of Alexandria]].{{sfn|Fagenblat|2017|p=4}}

According to Carabine, "apophasis proper" in Greek thought starts with Neo-Platonism, with its speculations about the nature of the One, culminating in the works of Proclus.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}} According to Carabine, there are two major points in the development of apophatic theology, namely the fusion of the Jewish tradition with Platonic philosophy in the writings of Philo, and the works of Dionysius the Pseudo-Areopagite, who infused Christian thought with Neo-Platonic ideas.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}}

The Early Church Fathers were influenced by Philo,{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}} and Meredith even states that Philo "is the real founder of the apophatic tradition."{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=545}} Yet, it was with [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] and [[Maximus the Confessor]],{{sfn|Berthold|1985|p=9}} whose writings shaped both [[Hesychasm]], the contemplative tradition of the Eastern Orthodox Churches, and the mystical traditions of western Europe, that apophatic theology became a central element of Christian theology and contemplative practice.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}}

==Greek philosophy==
{{See also|Epoché|Pyrrhonism|Skepticism}}

===Pre-Socratic===
For the ancient Greeks, knowledge of the gods was essential for proper worship.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}} Poets had an important responsibility in this regard, and a central question was how knowledge of the Divine forms can be attained.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}} [[Epiphany (feeling)|Epiphany]] played an essential role in attaining this knowledge.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}} [[Xenophanes]] (c. 570 – c. 475 BC) noted that the knowledge of the Divine forms is restrained by the human imagination, and Greek philosophers realized that this knowledge can only be mediated through myth and visual representations, which are culture-dependent.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}}

According to [[Herodotus]] (484–425 BCE), [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]] (between 750 and 650 BC) taught the Greek the knowledge of the Divine bodies of the Gods.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=51}} The ancient Greek poet Hesiod (between 750 and 650 BC) describes in his ''[[Theogony]]'' the birth of the gods and creation of the world,{{r|ellopsos|group=web}} which became an "ur-text for programmatic, first-person [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphanic]] narratives in Greek literature,"{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}}{{refn|group=note|Hesiod's ''Theogony'' was highly referred in the time of [[Plato]] (428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BCE), and Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' shows a profound familiarity with Hesiod's ''Theogony''.{{sfn|Boys-Stones|Haubold|2009|p=xiviii}} See also Timaeus e39-e41.{{r|ellopsos|group=web}}}} but also "explores the necessary limitations placed on human access to the divine."{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}} According to Platt, the statement of the Muses who grant Hesiod knowledge of the Gods "actually accords better with the logic of apophatic religious thought."{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=53}}{{refn|group=note|Richard G. Geldard: "[M]ore than any other pre-Socratic thinker, Heraclitus embodies the apophatic method. He "unsaid" the myths of the Archaic tradition on his way to transforming the ideas of divinity through the divine Logos. It was a transformation affirmed by Plotinus 800 years later."{{sfn|Geldard|2000|p=23}}}}

[[Parmenides]] (fl. late sixth or early fifth century BC), in his poem ''On Nature'', gives an account of a revelation on two ways of inquiry. "The way of conviction" explores Being, true reality ("what-is"), which is "What is ungenerated and deathless,/whole and uniform, and still and perfect."{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=109-111}} "The way of opinion" is the world of appearances, in which one's sensory faculties lead to conceptions which are false and deceitful. His distinction between unchanging Truth and shifting opinion is reflected in Plato's [[allegory of the Cave]]. Together with the Biblical story of Moses's ascent of Mount Sinai, it is used by Gregory of Nyssa and Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite to give a Christian account of the ascent of the soul toward God.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=111-112}} Cook notes that Parmenides poem is a religious account of a mystical journey, akin to the [[mystery cults]],{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=109}} giving a philosophical form to a religious outlook.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=112}} Cook further notes that the philosopher's task is to "attempt through 'negative' thinking to tear themselves loose from all that frustrates their pursuit of wisdom."{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=112}}

===Plato===
[[File:Plato Silanion Musei Capitolini MC1377.jpg|thumb|Plato Silanion Musei Capitolini MC1377]]
[[Plato]] (428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BCE), "deciding for Parmenides against [[Heraclitus]]" and his theory of eternal change,{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}} had a strong influence on the development of apophatic thought.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}}

Plato further explored Parmenides's idea of timeless truth in his dialogue ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'', which is a treatment of the [[Theory of Forms|eternal forms]], ''Truth, Beauty and Goodness'', which are the real aims for knowledge.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}} The Theory of Forms is Plato's answer to the problem "how one unchanging reality or essential{{clarify|date=July 2017}} being can admit of many changing phenomena (and not just by dismissing them as being mere illusion)."{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}}

In ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', Plato argues that the "real objects of knowledge are not the changing objects of the senses, but the immutable Forms,"{{r|EoP_Plato(Republic)|group=web}} stating that the ''[[Form of the Good]]''{{refn|group=note|Identified by various commentators with the Form of Unity.{{explain|date=April 2017}}{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}}} is the highest object of knowledge.{{sfn|Kahn|1998|p=61}}{{sfn|Phillips|2008|p=234}}{{r|EoP_Plato(Republic)|group=web}}{{refn|group=note|See ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' 508d–e, 511b, 516b)}} His argument culminates in the [[Allegory of the Cave]], in which he argues that humans are like prisoners in a cave, who can only see shadows of the Real, the ''Form of the Good''.{{sfn|Phillips|2008|p=234}}{{r|EoP_Plato(Republic)|group=web}} Humans are to be educated to search for knowledge, by turning away from their bodily desires toward higher contemplation, culminating in an intellectual{{refn|group=note|As opposed to mere rationality.}} understanding or apprehension of the Forms, c.q. the "first principles of all knowledge."{{sfn|Phillips|2008|p=234}}

According to Cook, the ''Theory of Forms'' has a theological flavour, and had a strong influence on the ideas of his Neo-Platonist interpreters Proclus and Plotinus.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}} The pursuit of ''Truth, Beauty and Goodness'' became a central element in the apophatic tradition,{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}} but nevertheless, according to Carabine "Plato himself cannot be regarded as the founder of the negative way."{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=21}} Carabine warns not to read later Neo-Platonic and Christian understandings into Plato, and notes that Plato did not identify his Forms with "one transcendent source," an identification which his later interpreters made.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=21-22}}

===Middle Platonism===
{{Main|Middle Platonism}}

[[Middle Platonism]] (1st century BCE - 3rd century CE){{r|IEP_Middle_Platonism|group=web}} further investigated Plato's "Unwritten Doctrines," which drew on [[Pythagoras]]' first principles of the [[Monad (philosophy)|Monad]] and the [[Dyad (Greek philosophy)|Dyad]] (matter).{{r|IEP_Middle_Platonism|group=web}} Middle Platonism proposed a [[hierarchy of being]], with God as its first principle at its top, identifying it with Plato's ''Form of the Good''.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} An influential proponent of Middle Platonism was [[Philo of Alexandria|Philo]] (c.25 BCE–c. 50 CE), who employed Middle Platonic philosophy in his interpretation of the Hebrew scriptures, and asserted a strong influence on early Christianity.{{r|IEP_Middle_Platonism|group=web}} According to Craig D. Allert, "Philo made a monumental contribution to the creation of a vocabulary for use in negative statements about God."{{sfn|Allert|2002|p=89}} For Philo, God is undescribable, and he uses terms which emphasize God's transcendence.{{sfn|Allert|2002|p=89}}

===Neo-Platonism===
{{Main|Neo-Platonism}}

Neo-Platonism was a mystical or contemplative form of Platonism, which "developed outside the mainstream of Academic Platonism."{{r|IEP_Neo-Platonism|group=web}} It started with the writings of Plotinus (204/5–270), and ended with the closing of the Platonic Academy by Emperor Justinian in 529 CE, when the pagan traditions were ousted.{{r|IEP_Plotinus|group=web}} It is a product of Hellenistic syncretism, which developed due to the crossover between Greek thought and the Jewish scriptures, and also gave birth to [[Gnosticism]].{{r|IEP_Neo-Platonism|group=web}} Proclus was the last head of the Platonic Academy; his student Pseudo-Dinosysius had a far-stretching Neo-Platonic influence on Christianity and Christian mysticism.{{r|IEP_Neo-Platonism|group=web}}

====Plotinus====
[[File:Plotinus.jpg|thumb|left|Plotinus]]
[[Plotinus]] (204/5–270) was the founder of Neo-Platonism.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} In the [[Neoplatonism|Neo-Platonic philosophy]] of Plotinus and Proclus, the first principle became even more elevated as a radical unity, which was presented as an unknowable Absolute.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} For Plotinus, ''the One'' is the first principle, from which everything else emanates.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} He took it from Plato's writings, identifying the Good of the ''Republic'', as the cause of the other Forms, with ''the One'' of the first hypothesis of the second part of the ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]''.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} For Plotinus, ''the One'' precedes the [[Theory of Forms|Forms]],{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} and "is beyond Mind and indeed beyond Being."{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} From ''the One'' comes the [[Nous|Intellect]], which contains all the Forms.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} ''The One'' is the principle of Being, while the Forms are the principle of the essence of beings, and the intelligibility which can recognize them as such.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} Plotinus's third principle is Soul, the desire for objects external to the person. The highest satisfaction of desire is the contemplation of ''the One'',{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} which unites all existents "as a single, all-pervasive reality."{{r|IEP_Plotinus|group=web}}

''The One'' is radically simple, and does not even have self-knowledge, since self-knowledge would imply multiplicity.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} Nevertheless, Plotinus does urge for a search for the Absolute, turning inward and becoming aware of the "presence of the intellect in the human soul,"{{refn|group=note|Compare Korean Chon (Zen) master [[Jinul]]s "tracing back the radiance":&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;''"Question: What is the mind of void and calm, numinous awareness?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chinul: What has just asked me this question is precisely your mind of void and calm, numinous awareness. Why not trace back its radiance rather than search for it outside? For your benefit I will now point straight to your original mind so that you can awaken to it. Clear your minds and listen to my words."''{{r|Chinul|group=web}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See also {{Citation | last =Buswell | first =Robert E. | year =1991 | title =Tracing Back the Radiance: Chinul's Korean Way of Zen | publisher =University of Hawaii Press}}}} initiating an ascent of the soul by [[Abstraction#In philosophy|abstraction]] or "taking away," culminating in a [[Subitism|sudden appearance]] of ''the One''.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=8}} In the ''[[Enneads]]'' Plotinus writes: 
{{quote|Our thought cannot grasp the One as long as any other image remains active in the soul [...] To this end, you must set free your soul from all outward things and turn wholly within yourself, with no more leaning to what lies outside, and lay your mind bare of ideal forms, as before of the objects of sense, and forget even yourself, and so come within sight of that One.}}

Carabine notes that Plotinus' apophasis is not just a mental exercise, an acknowledgement of the unknowability of ''the One'', but a means to ''[[Ecstasy (philosophy)|extasis]]'' and an ascent to "the unapproachable light that is God."{{r|Carabine_interview|group=web}} Pao-Shen Ho, investigating what are Plotinus' methods for reaching ''[[henosis]]'',{{refn|group=note|The Neoplatonic concept of ''henosis'' has precedents in the Greek [[mystery religions]]{{sfn|Angus|1975|p=52}} as well as parallels in [[Eastern philosophy]].{{sfn|Gregorios|2002}}}} concludes that "Plotinus' mystical teaching is made up of two practices only, namely philosophy and negative theology."{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20}} According to Moore, Plotinus appeals to the "non-discursive, intuitive faculty of the soul," by "calling for a sort of prayer, an invocation of the deity, that will permit the soul to lift itself up to the unmediated, direct, and intimate contemplation of that which exceeds it (V.1.6)."{{r|IEP_Plotinus|group=web}} Pao-Shen Ho further notes that "for Plotinus, mystical experience is irreducible to philosophical arguments."{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20}} The argumentation about ''henosis'' is preceded by the actual experience of it, and can only be understood when ''henosis'' has been attained.{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20}} Ho further notes that Plotinus's writings have a didactic flavour, aiming to "bring his own soul and ''the souls of others'' by way of [[Nous|Intellect]] to union with the One."{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20}} As such, the ''Enneads'' as a spiritual or ascetic teaching device, akin to ''The Cloud of Unknowing'',{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20-21}} demonstrating the methods of philosophical and apophatic inquiry.{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=26}} Ultimately, this leads to silence and the abandonment of all intellectual inquiry, leaving contemplation and unity.{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=25-27}}

====Proclus====
[[Proclus]] (412-485) introduced the terminology which is being used in apophatic and cataphatic theology.{{sfn|Louth|2012|p=139}} He did this in the second book of his ''Platonic Theology'', arguing that Plato states that ''the One'' can be revealed "through analogy," and that "through negations [''dia ton apophaseon''] its transcendence over everything can be shown."{{sfn|Louth|2012|p=139}} For Proclus, apophatic and cataphonic theology form a contemplatory pair, with the apophatic approach corresponding to the manifestation of the world from ''the One'', and cataphonic theology corresponding to the return to ''the One''.{{sfn|Louth|2012|p=140}} The analogies are affirmations which direct us toward ''the One'', while the negations underlie the confirmations, being closer to ''the One''.{{sfn|Louth|2012|p=140}} According to Luz, Proclus also attracted students from other faiths, including the Samaritan Marinus. Luz notes that "Marinus' Samaritan origins with its Abrahamic notion of a single [[Ineffability|ineffable]] [[Tetragrammaton|Name of God]] ({{Hebrew|יהוה}}) should also have been in many ways compatible with the school's ineffable and apophatic divine principle."{{sfn|Luz|2017|p=149}}
{{Christian mysticism}}

==Christianity==
===Apostolic Age===
The [[Book of Revelation]] 8:1 mentions "the silence of the perpetual choir in heaven." According to Dan Merkur,
{{quote|The silence of the perpetual choir in heaven had mystical connotations, because silence attends the disappearance of plurality during experiences of mystical oneness. The term "silence" also alludes to the "still small voice" ([[1 Kings]] {{bibleverse-nb|1 Kings|19:12|HE|}}) whose [[theophany|revelation]] to [[Elijah]] on [[Mount Horeb]] rejected visionary imagery by affirming a negative theology.{{sfn|Merkur|2014|p=331}}{{refn|group=note|According to Michel Masson, Elijah's theophany is an "apophatic revelation," a mystical experience which is akin to ''nirvana'' and Böhme's ''Ungrund''."

===Early Church Fathers===
The [[Early Church Fathers]] were influenced by [[Philo of Alexandria|Philo]]{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}} (c. 25 BCE – c. 50 CE), who saw [[Moses]] as "the model of human virtue and Sinai as the archetype of man's ascent into the "luminous darkness" of God."{{sfn|Woloschak|2016}} His interpretation of Moses was followed by Clement of Alexandria, [[Origen]], the Cappadocian Fathers, Pseudo-Dionysius, and Maximus the Confessor.{{sfn|Louth|2003|p=220}}{{sfn|Lane|2007|p=67}}{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=545}}{{sfn|Boersma|2013|p=243}}

God's appearance to Moses in the [[burning bush]] was often elaborated on by the Early Church Fathers,{{sfn|Louth|2003|p=220}} especially [[Gregory of Nyssa]] (c. 335 – c. 395),{{sfn|Lane|2007|p=67}}{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=545}}{{sfn|Boersma|2013|p=243}} realizing the fundamental unknowability of God;{{sfn|Louth|2003|p=220}}{{sfn|Mayes|2016|p=117]}} an exegesis which continued in the medieval mystical tradition.{{sfn|Glasscoe|1992|p=57]}} Their response is that, although God is unknowable, Jesus as person can be followed, since "following Christ is the human way of seeing God."{{sfn|Louth|2003|p=221}}

[[Clement of Alexandria]] (c. 150 – c. 215) was an early proponent of apophatic theology.{{sfn|Hägg|2006}}{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=545}} According to R.A. Baker, in Clement's writings the term ''theoria'' develops further from a mere intellectual "seeing" toward a spirutal form of contemplation.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=88}} Clement's apophatic theology or philosophy is closely related to this kind of ''theoria'' and the "mystic vision of the soul."{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=88}} For Clement, God is transcendent and immanent.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=89}} According to Baker, Clement's apophaticism is mainly driven by Biblical texts, but by the Platonic tradition.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=92-92}} His conception of an ineffable God is a synthesis of Plato and Philo, as seen from a Biblical perspective.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=92}} According to Osborne, it is a synthesis in a Biblical framework; according to Baker, while the Platonic tradition accounts for the negative approach, the Biblical tradition accounts for the positive approach.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=92-93}} ''Theoria'' and abstraction is the means to conceive of this ineffable God; it is preceded by dispassion.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=98-103}}

According to [[Tertullian]] (c. 155 – c. 240),
{{quote|[t]hat which is infinite is known only to itself.  This it is which gives some notion of God, while yet beyond all our conceptions{{spndash}}our very incapacity of fully grasping Him affords us the idea of what He really is.  He is presented to our minds in His transcendent greatness, as at once known and unknown.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tertullian]], ''Apologeticus'', § 17.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite===
Apophatic theology found its most influential expression in the works of [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] (late 5th to early 6th century), a student of [[Proclus]] (412-485), combining a Christian worldview with Neo-Platonic ideas.&lt;ref name="Berthold1985_p9"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berthold |first1=George C. |title="Introduction" to Maximus the Confessor.

Dionysius the Areopagite was a pseudonym, taken from [[Acts of the Apostles]] chapter 17, in which [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] gives a [[Areopagus sermon|missionary speech to the court of the Areopagus]] in Athens.{{sfn|Stang|2011|p=12}} In {{bibleref2|Acts|17:23|KJV|verse 23}} Paul makes a reference to an altar-inscription, dedicated to the [[Unknown God]], "a safety measure honoring foreign gods still unknown to the Hellenistic world."{{sfn|Stang|2011|p=12}} For Paul, Jesus Christ is this unknown God, and as a result of Paul's speech Dionysius the Areopagite converts to Christianity.{{sfn|Stang|2011|p=13}} Yet, according to Stang, for Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite Athens is also the place of Neo-Platonic wisdom, and the term "unknown God" is a reversal of Paul's preaching toward an integration of Christianity with Neo-Platonism, and the union with the "unknown God."{{sfn|Stang|2011|p=13}}

According to Corrigan and Harrington, "Dionysius' central concern is how a triune God, ... who is utterly unknowable, unrestricted being, beyond individual substances, beyond even goodness, can become manifest to, in, and through the whole of creation in order to bring back all things to the hidden darkness of their source."{{sfn|Corrigan|Harrington|2014}} Drawing on Neo-Platonism, Pseudo-Dionysius described humans [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|ascend to divinity]] as a process of purgation, illumination and union.{{sfn|MacCulloch|2010|p=439}} Another Neo-Platonic influence was his description of the cosmos as a series of hierarchies, which overcome the distance between God and humans.{{sfn|MacCulloch|2010|p=439}}

===Eastern Orthodox Christianity===
{{Main|Eastern Orthodox Church}}

In [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] apophatic theology is taught as superior to cataphatic theology. The fourth-century [[Cappadocian Fathers]]{{refn|group=note|[[Basil the Great]] (330–379), who was bishop of [[Caesarea Mazaca|Caesarea]]; Basil's younger brother [[Gregory of Nyssa]] (c.332–395), who was bishop of [[Nyssa (Cappadocia)|Nyssa]]; and a close friend, [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] (329–389), who became [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=WDL1&gt;{{cite web|title=Commentary on Song of Songs; Letter on the Soul; Letter on Ascesis and the Monastic Life|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4168|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} stated a belief in the existence of God, but an existence unlike that of everything else: everything else that exists was created, but the Creator [[Transcendence (religion)|transcends]] this existence, is uncreated. The [[essence]] of God is completely unknowable; mankind can know God only through His [[Energies of God|energies]].&lt;ref name="McGinn"&gt;{{cite book |last=McGinn |first=Bernard |chapter=4.

[[John of Damascus]] (c.675/676–749) employed negative theology when he wrote that positive statements about God reveal "not the nature, but the things around the nature."

[[Maximus the Confessor]] (580-622) took over Pseudo-Dionysius' ideas, and had a strong influence on the theology and contemplative practices of the Eastern Orthodox Churches.&lt;ref name="Berthold1985_p9"/&gt; [[Gregory Palamas]] (1296–1359) formulated the definite theology of [[Hesychasm]], the Orthodox practices of [[contemplative prayer]] and [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]], "deification."

Influential modern Eastern Orthodox theologians are [[Vladimir Lossky]], [[John Meyendorff]], [[John S. Romanides]] and [[Georges Florovsky]]. Lossky argues, based on his reading of Dionysius and Maximus Confessor, that positive theology is always inferior to negative theology which is a step along the way to the superior knowledge attained by negation.&lt;ref&gt;Lossky, ''The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church'' p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; This is expressed in the idea that [[mysticism]] is the expression of dogmatic theology ''par excellence''.&lt;ref&gt;Lossky, ''The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church'' p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lossky, outside of directly revealed knowledge through [[Scripture]] and [[Sacred Tradition]], such as the Trinitarian nature of God, God in His essence is beyond the limits of what human beings (or even [[angel]]s) can understand. He is [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] in essence (''[[ousia]]''). Further knowledge must be sought in a direct experience of God or His [[Energies of God|indestructible energies]] through ''[[Christian contemplation|theoria]]'' (vision of God).&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Lossky|Lossky, Vladimir]] (1997), ''The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church'', Crestwood, N.Y.: [[SVS Press]], p. 81, {{ISBN|0-913836-31-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lossky (1997), ''The Vision of God'', Crestwood, N.Y.: SVS Press, pp. 36–40, {{ISBN|0-913836-19-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aristotle Papanikolaou, in Eastern Christianity, God is [[Immanence|immanent]] in his [[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]] or existences.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle Papanikolaou|Papanikolaou, Aristotle]] (2006), ''Being With God: Trinity, Apophaticism, and Divine–Human Communion'' (1st Edition), Notre Dame, Indiana:[[University of Notre Dame Press]], p. 2, {{ISBN|978-0-268-03830-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Christianity===
Negative theology has a place in the Western Christian tradition as well. The 9th-century theologian [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena|John Scotus Erigena]] wrote: 
{{quote|We do not know what God is. God Himself does not know what He is because He is not anything [i.e., "not any created thing"]. Literally God ''is not'', because He [[transcendence (religion)|transcends]] [[being]].''"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=Eriugena+%22We+do+not+know+what+God+is.+God+Himself+does+not+know+what+He+is+because+He+is+not+anything.+Literally+God+is+not%2C+because+He+transcends+being%22 Quote] on [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}
When he says "''He is not anything''" and "''God is not''", Scotus does not mean that there is no God, but that God cannot be said to exist in the way that creation exists, i.e. that God is uncreated. He is using apophatic language to emphasise that God is "other".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Indick|first1=William|title=The Digital God.

Theologians like [[Meister Eckhart]] and [[Saint John of the Cross]] (San Juan de la Cruz) exemplify some aspects of or tendencies towards the apophatic tradition in the West. The medieval work, ''[[The Cloud of Unknowing]]'' and Saint John's ''[[Dark Night of the Soul]]'' are particularly well known. In 1215 apophatism became the official position of the [[Catholic Church]], which, on the basis of [[Religious text#Christianity|Scripture]] and [[Sacred tradition|church tradition]], during the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran|Fourth Lateran Council]] formulated the following [[Dogma in the Catholic Church|dogma]]:

[[Thomas Aquinas]] was born ten years later (1225-1274) and, although in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' he quotes Pseudo-Dionysius 1,760 times,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Ware |first=Kallistos |author-link=Kallistos Ware |year=1963 |publication-date= |title=The Orthodox Church |page=73 |place=London |publisher=Penguin Group |isbn=0-14-020592-6 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; his reading in a [[Aristotelianism|neo-Aristotelian]] key{{sfn|Przywara|2014|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=Fc9RAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=%22Thomas+Aquinas+stands+out+as+Aristotle's+most+important+medieval+commentator+—+both+for+having+clarified+received+notions+of+analogy+and+for+assessing+its+theological+uses%22 38 ("Thomas Aquinas stands out as Aristotle's most important medieval commentator — both for having clarified received notions of analogy and for assessing its theological uses")]}} of the conciliar declaration overthrew its meaning inaugurating the "analogical way" as ''[[wikt:tertium|tertium]]'' between ''via negativa'' and ''via positiva'': the ''via eminentiae'' (see also ''[[analogia entis]]''). According to Adrian Langdon,
{{quote|The distinction between univocal, equivocal, and analogous language and relations corresponds to the distinction between the ''via positiva'', via ''negativa'', and ''via eminentiae''.

According to ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', the ''Doctor Angelicus'' and the [[Scholasticism|scholastici]] declare [that] 
{{quote|God is not absolutely unknowable, and yet it is true that we cannot define Him adequately. But we can conceive and name Him in an "analogical way". The perfections manifested by creatures are in God, not merely nominally (''equivoce'') but really and positively, since He is their source. Yet, they are not in Him as they are in the creature, with a mere difference of degree, nor even with a mere specific or generic difference (''univoce''), for there is no common concept including the finite and the Infinite. They are really in Him in a supereminent manner (''eminenter'') which is wholly incommensurable with their mode of being in creatures. We can conceive and express these perfections only by an analogy; not by an analogy of proportion, for this analogy rests on a participation in a common concept, and, as already said, there is no element common to the finite and the Infinite; but by an analogy of proportionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic Encyclopedia |last=Sauvage |first=George |year=1907 |inline=1 |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01449a.htm|title=Analogy}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[C. S. Lewis]], in his book ''[[Miracles (book)|Miracles]]'' (1947), advocates the use of negative theology when first thinking about God, in order to cleanse our minds of misconceptions. He goes on to say we must then refill our minds with the truth about God, untainted by mythology, bad [[analogies]] or false mind-pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brazier |first=P.

The mid-20th century Dutch philosopher [[Herman Dooyeweerd]], who is often associated with a neo-Calvinistic tradition, provides a philosophical foundation for understanding why we can never absolutely know God, and yet, paradoxically, truly know something of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Friesen|first1=J. Glenn|title=The religious dialectic revisited|url=https://jgfriesen.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/revisited.pdf|website=jgfriesen.files|accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dooyeweerd made a sharp distinction between theoretical and pre-theoretical attitudes of thought. Most of the discussion of knowledge of God presupposes theoretical knowledge, in which we reflect and try to define and discuss. Theoretical knowing, by its very nature, is never absolute, always depends on religious presuppositions, and cannot grasp either God or the law side. Pre-theoretical knowing, on the other hand, is intimate engagement, and exhibits a diverse range of aspects. Pre-theoretical intuition, on the other hand, can grasp at least the law side. Knowledge of God, as God wishes to reveal it, is pre-theoretical, immediate and intuitive, never theoretical in nature.&lt;ref name="VanDrunen"&gt;{{cite book |last=VanDrunen |first=David |title=Natural Law and the Two Kingdoms.

[[Ivan Illich]] (1926-2002), the historian and social critic, can be read as an apophatic theologian, according to a longtime collaborator, Lee Hoinacki, in a paper presented in memory of Illich, called "Why Philia?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pudel.uni-bremen.de/pdf/Hoinacki_Clar04_Philia_philia_en.pdf Hoinacki, Lee].&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century===
According to [[Deirdre Carabine]], negative theology has become a hot topic since the 1990s,{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=i, viii}} resulting from a broad effort in the 19 and 20th century to portray Plato as a mysticist, which revived the interest in Neoplatonism and negative theology.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=i-ii}}

[[File:Maimonides-2.jpg|thumb|left|Maimonides]]

[[Maimonides]] (1135/1138-1204) was "the most influential medieval Jewish exponent of the ''via negativa''."{{sfn|Fagenblat|2017|p=4}} Maimonides, but also [[Samuel ibn Tibbon]], draw on [[Bahya ibn Paquda]],{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} who shows that our inability to describe God is related to the fact of His [[Jewish principles of faith#God is One|absolute unity]]. God, as the entity which is "truly One" (האחד האמת), must be free of properties and is thus unlike anything else and [[Divine simplicity|indescribable]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} According to Rabbi Yosef Wineberg, Maimonides stated that "[God] is knowledge," and saw His Essence, Being and knowledge as completely one, "a perfect unity and not a composite at all."&lt;ref name="Wineberg"/&gt; Wineberg quotes Maimonides as stating
{{quote|This [form of unity] wherein G‑d’s knowledge and so on is one with G‑d Himself is beyond the capacity of the mouth to express, beyond the capacity of the ear to hear, and beyond the capacity of the heart of man to apprehend clearly.&lt;ref name="Wineberg"&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=7994 ''Shaar Hayichud Vehaemunah Ch. 8]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'' Maimonides stated:
{{quote|God's existence is absolute and it includes no composition and we comprehend only the fact that He exists, not His essence. Consequently it is a false assumption to hold that He has any positive [[Abstraction|attribute]] [...] still less has He accidents (מקרה), which could be described by an attribute. Hence it is clear that He has no positive attribute however, the negative attributes are necessary to direct the mind to the truths which we must believe [...] When we say of this being, that it exists, we mean that its non-existence is impossible; it is living &amp;mdash; it is not dead; [...] it is the first &amp;mdash; its existence is not due to any cause; it has power, wisdom, and will &amp;mdash; it is not feeble or ignorant; [[Jewish principles of faith#God is One|He is One]] &amp;mdash; there are not more Gods than one [...] Every attribute predicated of God denotes either the quality of an action, or, when the attribute is intended to convey some idea of the Divine Being itself &amp;mdash; and not of His actions &amp;mdash; the [[negation]] of the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'', [http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp.htm 1:58]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Fagenblat, it is only in the modern period that negative theology really gains importance in Jewish thought.{{sfn|Fagenblat|2017|p=4}} [[Yeshayahu Leibowitz]] (1903-1994) was a prominent modern exponent of Jewish negative theology.{{sfn|Fagenblat|2017|p=2}} According to Leibowitz, a person's faith is his commitment to obey God, meaning God's commandments, and this has nothing to do with a person’s image of God. This must be so because Leibowitz thought that God cannot be described, that God's understanding is not man's understanding, and thus all the questions asked of God are out of place.&lt;ref&gt;Zev Golan, "God, Man and Nietzsche: A Startling Dialogue between Judaism and Modern Philosophers" (New York: iUniverse, 2008), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian parallels==
[[File:Raja Ravi Varma - Sankaracharya.jpg|thumb|Shankara]]
There are interesting parallels in Indian thought, which developed largely separate from Western thought. Early [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophical]] works which have apophatic themes include the [[Mukhya Upanishads|Principal Upanishads]] (800 BCE to the start of common era) and the [[Brahma Sutras]] (from 450 BCE and 200 CE). An expression of negative theology is found in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]], where Brahman is described as "[[neti neti]]" or "neither this, nor that".&lt;ref&gt;Tharaud, Barry. Emerson for the Twenty-First Century: Global Perspectives on an American Icon. Rosemont Publishing and Printing Corp, 2010. p. 453. {{ISBN|978-0-87413-091-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Further use of apophatic theology is found in the Brahma Sutras, which state:{{Quote|Whenever we deny something unreal, it is in reference to something real.&lt;ref&gt;Verse III.2.22, Brahma-Sutra, Translated by Swami Gambhirananda.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Buddhist philosophy]] has also strongly advocated the way of negation, beginning with the Buddha's own theory of [[anatta]] (not-[[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]], not-self) which denies any truly existent and unchanging essence of a person. [[Madhyamaka]] is a Buddhist philosophical school founded by [[Nagarjuna]] (2nd-3rd century CE), which is based on a fourfold negation of all assertions and concepts and promotes the theory of emptiness ([[Śūnyatā|shunyata]]). Apophatic assertions are also an important feature of Mahayana sutras, especially the [[Prajnaparamita|prajñaparamita]] genre. These currents of negative theology are visible in all forms of Buddhism.

Apophatic movements in medieval [[Hindu philosophy]] are visible in the works of [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] (8th century), a philosopher of [[Advaita Vedanta]] (non-dualism), and [[Bhartṛhari]] (5th century), a grammarian. While Shankara holds that the transcendent noumenon, [[Brahman]], is realized by the means of negation of every phenomenon including language, Bhartṛhari theorizes that language has both phenomenal and noumenal dimensions, the latter of which manifests Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Coward|Coward, Harold G.]] and Foshay, Toby. Derrida and Negative Theology. State University of New York, 1992. P. 21. {{ISBN|0-7914-0964-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Advaita, Brahman is defined as being [[Nirguna]] or without qualities. Anything imaginable or conceivable is not deemed to be the ultimate reality.&lt;ref&gt;Renard, John.  Responses to One Hundred One Questions on Hinduism. Paulist Press, 1999. P. 75. {{ISBN|0-8091-3845-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Taittiriya]] hymn speaks of Brahman as "one where the mind does not reach". Yet the Hindu scriptures often speak of Brahman's positive aspect. For instance, Brahman is often equated with bliss. These contradictory descriptions of Brahman are used to show that the attributes of Brahman are similar to ones experienced by mortals, but not the same. 

Negative theology also figures in the [[Buddhist]] and Hindu [[polemics]]. The arguments go something like this – Is Brahman an object of experience? If so, how do you convey this experience to others who have not had a similar experience? The only way possible is to relate this unique experience to common experiences while explicitly negating their sameness.

==Apophatic theology and atheism==
Even though the ''via negativa'' essentially rejects theological understanding in and of itself as a path to God, some have sought to make it into an intellectual exercise, by describing God only in terms of what God is not. One problem noted with this approach is that there seems to be no fixed basis on deciding what God is not, unless the Divine is understood as an abstract experience of full aliveness unique to each individual consciousness, and universally, the perfect goodness applicable to the whole field of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pondé|first1=Luiz Felipe|title=Crítica e profecia: a filosofia da religião em Dostoiévski |date=2003 |publisher=Editora 34 |location=São Paulo|pages=74–92|isbn=8573262842}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apophatic theology is often accused of being a version of [[atheism]] or [[agnosticism]], since it cannot say truly that God exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Kvanvig |editor-first=Jonathan |editor-link=Jonathan Kvanvig |year=2015 |chapter=7.

"Negative theology is a complement to, not the enemy of, positive theology".{{sfn|Bryson|2016|p=114}} Since religious experience—or consciousness of the holy or sacred, is not reducible to other kinds of human experience, an abstract understanding of religious experience cannot be used as evidence or proof that religious discourse or praxis can have no meaning or value.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Lonergan|Lonergan, Bernard]] (1972), "Method in Theology", New York, N.Y.: Seabury Press, {{ISBN|0-8164-2204-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In apophatic theology, the negation of theisms in the ''via negativa'' also requires the negation of their correlative atheisms if the dialectical method it employs is to maintain integrity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael J. Buckley|Buckley, Michael J.]] (2004), "Denying and Disclosing God: The Ambiguous Progress of Modern Atheism", New Haven, C.T.: [[Yale University Press]], pp. 120ff, {{ISBN|0-30009384-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans usually have deep-seated duty to authority, and tend to [[compliance (psychology)|comply]] when requested by an authority figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Stanley |last=Milgram |authorlink=Stanley Milgram |title=Obedience to Authority: An Experimental View |year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any society, a diverse and widely accepted system of authority allows the development of sophisticated structures for the production of resources, trade, expansion and [[social control]]. Since the opposite is [[anarchy]], we are all trained from birth to believe that [[obedience (human behavior)|obedience]] to authority is right. Notions of submission and [[loyalty]] to legitimate rule of others are accorded values in schools, the law, the military and in political systems. The strength of the bias to obey a legitimate authority figure comes from systemic [[socialization]] practices designed to instill in people the perception that such obedience constitutes correct behavior. Different societies vary the terms of this dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|last1=Hinnosaar| first1=Marit| last2=Hinnosaar| first2=Toomas| title=Authority Bias| date=August 31, 2012 |url=https://www.academia.edu/2108445/Authority_Bias}}&lt;/ref&gt; As we grow up, we learn that it benefits us to obey the dictates of genuine authority figures because such individuals usually possess higher degrees of knowledge, wisdom and [[Power (social and political)|power]]. We tend to do what our doctor advises. Consequently, [[deference]] to authority can occur in a mindless fashion as a kind of [[decision-making]] short cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Huczynski| first=Andrzej| title=Influencing within organizations| publisher=[[Routledge]]| year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The availability of consequences associated with an action is positively related to perceptions of the magnitude of the consequences of that action. In other words, the easier it is to recall the consequences of something the greater those consequences are often perceived to be. Most notably, people often rely on the content of their recall if its implications are not called into question by the difficulty that they experience in bringing the relevant material to mind.&lt;ref name="schwarz"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwarz|first1=Norbert|last2=Bless| first2=Herbert| last3=Strack |first3=Fritz |last4=Klumpp| first4=Gisela| last5=Rittenauer-Schatka| first5=Helga| last6=Simons| first6=Annette|title=Ease of retrieval as information: Another look at the availability heuristic|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1991|volume=61|issue=2|pages=195–202|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.61.2.195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview and history==
Prior to the work of Kahneman and Tversky, the predominant view in the field of human judgment was that humans are rational actors.  However, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, [[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]] began work on a series of papers examining "heuristic and biases" used in the judgment under uncertainty. They explained that judgment under uncertainty often relies on a limited number of simplifying heuristics rather than extensive algorithmic processing. Soon this idea spread beyond academic psychology, into law, medicine, and political science. This research questioned the descriptive adequacy of idealized models of judgment, and offered insights into the cognitive processes that explained human error without invoking motivated irrationality.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=FfTVDY-zrCoC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=history+overview+OR+OR+OR+definition+%22availability+heuristics%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title = Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment|date = 2002-07-08|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = |isbn = 9780521796798|author1 = Gilovich|first1 = Thomas|last2 = Griffin|first2 = Dale|last3 = Kahneman|first3 = Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt; One simplifying strategy people may rely on is the tendency to make a judgment about the frequency of an event based on how many similar instances are brought to mind. In 1973, Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman first studied this phenomenon and labeled it the "availability heuristic". An availability heuristic is a mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to a given person's mind when evaluating a specific topic, concept, method or decision. As follows, people tend to use a readily available fact to base their beliefs about a comparably distant concept. There has been much research done with this heuristic, but studies on the issue are still questionable with regard to the underlying process. Studies illustrate that manipulations intended to increase the subjective experience of ease of recall are also likely to affect the amount of recall. Furthermore, this makes it difficult to determine if the obtained estimates of frequency, likelihood, or typicality are based on participants' phenomenal experiences or on a biased sample of recalled information.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

However, some textbooks have chosen the latter interpretation introducing the availability heuristic as "one's judgments are always based on what comes to mind". For example, if a person is asked whether there are more words in the English language that begin with a t or k, the person will probably be able to think of more words that begin with the letter t, concluding that t is more frequent than k.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment|author1=Gilovich, T. D. |author2=Griffin, D. |author3= Kahneman, D. |date = 2002|work = |accessdate = |publisher = New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Chapman (1967) described a bias in the judgment of the frequency with which two events co-occur. This demonstration showed that the co-occurrence of paired stimuli resulted in participants overestimating the frequency of the pairings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chapman|first=L.J|title=Illusory correlation in observational report|journal=Journal of Verbal Learning|year=1967|volume=6|pages=151–155|doi=10.1016/s0022-5371(67)80066-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; To test this idea, participants were given information about several hypothetical mental patients. The data for each patient consisted of a clinical diagnosis and a drawing made by the patient. Later, participants estimated the frequency with which each diagnosis had been accompanied by various features of the drawing. The subjects vastly overestimated the frequency of this co-occurrence (such as suspiciousness and peculiar eyes). This effect was labeled the illusory correlation. Tversky and Kahneman suggested that availability provides a natural account for the illusory-correlation effect. The strength of the association between two events could provide the basis for the judgment of how frequently the two events co-occur. When the association is strong, it becomes more likely to conclude that the events have been paired frequently. Strong associations will be thought of as having occurred together frequently.&lt;ref name="tversky"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tversky|first1=Amos|last2=Kahneman|first2=Daniel|title=Availability: A heuristic for judging frequency and probability|journal=Cognitive Psychology|volume=5|issue=2|year=1973|pages=207–232|issn=0010-0285|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(73)90033-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Tversky &amp; Kahneman's first examination of availability heuristics, subjects were asked, "If a random word is taken from an English text, is it more likely that the word starts with a K, or that K is the third letter?" They argue that English-speaking people would immediately think of many words that begin with the letter "K" (kangaroo, kitchen, kale), but that it would take a more concentrated effort to think of any words in which "K" is the third letter (acknowledge, ask). Results indicated that participants overestimated the number of words that began with the letter "K" and underestimated the number of words that had "K" as the third letter. Tversky and Kahneman concluded that people answer questions like these by comparing the availability of the two categories and assessing how easily they can recall these instances. In other words, it is easier to think of words that begin with "K", more than words with "K" as the third letter. Thus, people judge words beginning with a "K" to be a more common occurrence. In reality, however, a typical text contains twice as many words that have "K" as the third letter than "K" as the first letter. There are three times more words with "K" in the third position than words that begin with "K".&lt;ref name="tversky" /&gt;

In Tversky and Kahneman's seminal paper, they include findings from several other studies, which also show support for the availability heuristic. Apart from their findings in the "K" study, they also found:
	When participants were shown two visual structures and asked to pick the structure that had more paths, participants saw more paths in the structure that had more obvious available paths. In the structure that participants chose, there were more columns and shorter obvious paths, making it more available to them. When participants were asked to complete tasks involving estimation, they would often underestimate the end result. Participants were basing their final estimation off of a quick first impression of the problem. Participants particularly struggled when the problems consisted of multiple steps. This occurred because participants were basing their estimation on an initial impression. Participants failed to account for the high rate of growth in the later steps due to the impression they formed in the initial steps. This was shown again in a task that asked participants to estimate the answer to a multiplication task, in which the numbers were presented as either 1x2x3x4x5x6x7x8 or 8x7x6x5x4x3x2x1. Participants who were presented the equation with the larger numbers first (8x7x6...), estimated a significantly higher result than participants with the lower numbers first (1x2x3...). Participants were given a short amount of time to make the estimation, thus participants based their estimates off of what was easily available, which in this case was the first few numbers in the sequence.&lt;ref name="tversky" /&gt;

== Explanations ==
Many researchers have attempted to identify the psychological process which create the availability heuristic.

Tversky and Kahneman argue that the number of examples recalled from memory is used to infer the frequency with which such instances occur. In an experiment to test this explanation, participants listened to lists of names containing either 19 famous women and 20 less famous men or 19 famous men and 20 less famous women. Subsequently, some participants were asked to recall as many names as possible whereas others were asked to estimate whether male or female names were more frequent on the list. The names of the famous celebrities were recalled more frequently compared to those of the less famous celebrities. The majority of the participants incorrectly judged that the gender associated with more famous names had been presented more often than the gender associated with less famous names. Tversky and Kahneman argue that although the availability heuristic is an effective strategy in many situations, when judging probability use of this heuristic can lead to predictable patterns of errors.&lt;ref name="tversky" /&gt;

Schwarz and his colleagues, on the other hand, proposed the '''ease of retrieval''' explanation, in which is the ease with which examples come to mind, not the number of examples, is used to infer the frequency of a given class. In a study by Schwarz and colleagues to test their explanation, participants were asked to recall either six or twelve examples of their assertive or very unassertive behavior. Participants were later asked to rate their own assertiveness. Pretesting had indicated that although most participants were capable of generating twelve examples, this was a difficult task. The results indicated that participants rated themselves as more assertive after describing six examples of assertive compared with unassertive behavior condition, but rated themselves as less assertive after describing twelve examples of assertive compared with unassertive behavior condition. The study reflected that the extent to which recalled content impacted judgment was determined by the ease with which the content could be brought to mind (it was easier to recall 6 examples than 12), rather than the amount of content brought to mind.&lt;ref name="schwarz" /&gt;

Research by Vaugh (1999) looked at the effects of [[uncertainty]] on the use of the availability heuristic. College students were asked to list either three or eight different study methods they could use in order to get an A on their final exams. The researchers also manipulated the time during the semester they would ask the students to complete the questionnaire.  Approximately half of the participants were asked for their study methods during the third week of classes, and the other half were asked on last day of classes. Next, participants were asked to rate how likely they would be to get an A in their easiest and hardest classes.  Participants were then asked to rank the difficulty they experienced in recalling the examples they had previously listed. The researchers hypothesized that students would use the availability heuristic, based on the number of study methods they listed, to predict their grade only when asked at the beginning of the semester and about their hardest final. Students were not expected to use the availability heuristic to predict their grade at the end of the semester or about their easiest final. The researchers predicted this use of availability heuristic because participants would be uncertain about their performance throughout the semester. The results indicated that students used the availability heuristic, based on the ease of recall of the study methods they listed, to predict their performance when asked at the beginning of the semester and about their hardest final. If the student listed only three study methods, they predicted a higher grade at the end of the semester only on their hardest final. If students listed eight study methods, they had a harder time recalling the methods and thus predicted a lower final grade on their hardest final. The results were not seen in the easy final condition because the students were certain they would get an A, regardless of study method. The results supported this hypothesis and gave evidence to the fact that levels of uncertainty affect the use of the availability heuristic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vaugh|first1=Leigh Ann|title=Effects of uncertainty on use of the availability of heuristic for self-efficacy judgments|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|volume=29|issue=2/3|pages=407–410|doi=10.1002/(sici)1099-0992(199903/05)29:2/3&lt;407::aid-ejsp943&gt;3.0.co;2-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Media===
After seeing news stories about child abductions, people may judge that the likelihood of this event is greater. Media coverage can help fuel a person's example bias with widespread and extensive coverage of unusual events, such as homicide or airline accidents, and less coverage of more routine, less sensational events, such as common diseases or car accidents. For example, when asked to rate the probability of a variety of causes of death, people tend to rate "newsworthy" events as more likely{{fact|date=November 2018}} because they can more readily recall an example from memory{{fact|date=November 2018}}. Moreover, unusual and vivid events like homicides, shark attacks, or lightning are more often reported in mass media than common and un-sensational causes of death like common diseases.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

For example, many people think that the likelihood of dying from shark attacks is greater than that of dying from being hit by falling airplane parts, when more people actually die from falling airplane parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.sandiegouniontribune.com/uniontrib/20040222/news_mz1c22odds.html|title=Odds and ends - The San Diego Union-Tribune|website=legacy.sandiegouniontribune.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a shark attack occurs, the deaths are widely reported in the media whereas deaths as a result of being hit by falling airplane parts are rarely reported in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Read|first=J.D.|title=The availability heuristic in person identification: The sometimes misleading consequences of enhanced contextual information|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|year=1995|volume=9|issue=2|pages=91–121|doi=10.1002/acp.2350090202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2010 study exploring how vivid television portrayals are used when forming social reality judgments, people watching vivid violent media gave higher estimates of the prevalence of crime and police immorality in the real world than those not exposed to vivid television. These results suggest that [[Research on the effects of violence in mass media|television violence]] does in fact have a direct causal impact on participants' social reality beliefs. Repeated exposure to vivid violence leads to an increase in people's risk estimates about the prevalence of crime and violence in the real world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riddle|first=Karen|title=Always on My Mind: Exploring How Frequent, Recent, and Vivid Television Portrayals Are Used in the Formation of Social Reality Judgments|journal=Media Psychology|year=2010|volume=13|issue=2|pages=155–179|doi=10.1080/15213261003800140}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Counter to these findings, researchers from a similar study argued that these effects may be due to effects of new information. Researchers tested the new information effect by showing movies depicting dramatic risk events and measuring their risk assessment after the film. Contrary to previous research, there were no effects on risk perception due to exposure to dramatic movies.&lt;ref name="SjöbergEngelberg2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sjöberg|first1=Lennart|last2=Engelberg|first2=Elisabeth|title=Risk Perception and Movies: A Study of Availability as a Factor in Risk Perception|journal=Risk Analysis|volume=30|issue=1|year=2010|pages=95–106|issn=0272-4332|doi=10.1111/j.1539-6924.2009.01335.x|pmid=20055978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
Researchers examined the role of cognitive heuristics in the [[AIDS]] risk-assessment process. 331 physicians reported worry about on-the-job [[HIV]] exposure, and experience with patients who have HIV. By analyzing answers to questionnaires handed out, researchers concluded that availability of AIDS information did not relate strongly to perceived risk.&lt;ref name="HeathAcklin1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heath|first1=Linda|last2=Acklin|first2=Marvin|last3=Wiley|first3=Katherine|title=Cognitive Heuristics and AIDS Risk Assessment Among Physicians|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|volume=21|issue=22|year=1991|pages=1859–1867|issn=0021-9029|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1991.tb00509.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants in a 1992 study read case descriptions of hypothetical patients who varied on their sex and sexual preference. These hypothetical patients showed symptoms of two different diseases. Participants were instructed to indicate which disease they thought the patient had and then they rated patient responsibility and interactional desirability. Consistent with the availability heuristic, either the more common ([[influenza]]) or the more publicized (AIDS) disease was chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Triplet|first=R.G|title=Discriminatory biases in the perception of illness: The application of availability and representativeness heuristics to the AIDS crisis|journal=Basic and Applied Social Psychology|year=1992|volume=13|issue=3|pages=303–322|doi=10.1207/s15324834basp1303_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business and economy===
One study sought to analyze the role of the availability heuristic in financial markets. Researchers defined and tested two aspects of the availability heuristic:&lt;ref name="kliger"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kliger|first1=Doron|last2=Kudryavtsev|first2=Andrey|title=The Availability Heuristic and Investors' Reaction to Company-Specific Events|journal=Journal of Behavioral Finance|volume=11|issue=1|year=2010|pages=50–65|issn=1542-7560|doi=10.1080/15427561003591116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Outcome Availability&amp;nbsp;– availability of positive and negative investment outcomes, and
* Risk Availability&amp;nbsp;– availability of financial risk.&lt;ref name="kliger" /&gt;

On days of substantial stock market moves, abnormal stock price reactions to upgrades are weaker, than those to downgrades. These availability effects are still significant even after controlling for event-specific and company-specific factors.&lt;ref name="kliger" /&gt;

Similarly, research has pointed out that under the availability heuristic, humans are not reliable because they assess probabilities by giving more weight to current or easily recalled information instead of  processing all relevant information. Since information regarding the current state of the economy is readily available, researchers attempted to expose the properties of business cycles to predict the availability bias in analysts' growth forecasts. They showed the availability heuristic to play a role in analysis of forecasts and influence investments because of this.&lt;ref name="LeeO'Brien2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Byunghwan|last2=O'Brien|first2=John|last3=Sivaramakrishnan|first3=K.|title=An Analysis of Financial Analysts' Optimism in Long-term Growth Forecasts|journal=Journal of Behavioral Finance|volume=9|issue=3|year=2008|pages=171–184|issn=1542-7560|doi=10.1080/15427560802341889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In effect, investors are using availability heuristic to make decisions and subsequently, may be obstructing their own investment success. An investor's lingering perceptions of a dire market environment may be causing them to view investment opportunities through an overly negative lens, making it less appealing to consider taking on investment risk, no matter how small the returns on perceived "safe" investments.   To illustrate, Franklin Templeton's annual Global Investor Sentiment Survey 1 asked individuals how they believed the S&amp;P 500 Index performed in 2009, 2010 and 2011. 66 percent of respondents stated that they believed the market was either flat or down in 2009, 48 percent said the same about 2010 and 53 percent also said the same about 2011.  In reality, the S&amp;P 500 saw 26.5 percent annual returns in 2009, 15.1 percent annual returns in 2010 and 2.1 percent annual returns in 2011, meaning lingering perceptions based on dramatic, painful events are impacting decision-making even when those events are over.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/the-availability-bias-is-driving-investor-decisions-2012-10. Franklin Templeton Investments. "Investors Should Beware The Role of 'Availability Bias'". Business Insider. Oct. 6, 2012. Dec. 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, a study by Hayibor and Wasieleski found that the availability of others who believe that a particular act is morally acceptable is positively related to others' perceptions of the morality of that act. This suggests that availability heuristic also has an effect on [[ethical]] decision making and ethical behavior in organizations.&lt;ref name="HayiborWasieleski2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hayibor|first1=Sefa|last2=Wasieleski|first2=David M.|title=Effects of the Use of the Availability Heuristic on Ethical Decision-Making in Organizations|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|volume=84|issue=S1|year=2008|pages=151–165|issn=0167-4544|doi=10.1007/s10551-008-9690-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
A study done by Craig R. Fox provides an example of how availability heuristics can work in the classroom. In this study, Fox tests whether difficulty of recall influences judgment, specifically with course evaluations among college students.  In his study he had two groups complete a course evaluation form.  He asked the first group to write two recommended improvements for the course (a relatively easy task) and then write two positives about the class. The second group was asked to write ten suggestions where the professor could improve (a relatively difficult task) and then write two positive comments about the course.  At the end of the evaluation both groups were asked to rate the course on a scale from one to seven.  The results showed that students asked to write ten suggestions (difficult task) rated the course less harshly because it was more difficult for them to recall the information.{{why|date= August 2013}} Students asked to do the easier evaluation with only two complaints had less difficulty in terms of availability of information, so they rated the course more harshly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fox|first=Craig R.|title=The availability heuristic in the classroom: How soliciting more criticism can boost your course ratings|journal=Judgment and Decision Making |year=2006 |volume=1|issue=1|pages=86–90|url=http://journal.sjdm.org/jdm06020.pdf|issn=1930-2975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criminal justice===
The media usually focuses on violent or extreme cases, which are more readily available in the public's mind. This may come into play when it is time for the judicial system to evaluate and determine the proper punishment for a crime. In one study, respondents rated how much they agreed with hypothetical laws and policies such as "Would you support a law that required all offenders convicted of unarmed muggings to serve a minimum prison term of two years?" Participants then read cases and rated each case on several questions about punishment. As hypothesized, respondents recalled more easily from [[long-term memory]] stories that contain severe harm, which seemed to influence their sentencing choices to make them push for harsher punishments. This can be eliminated by adding high concrete or high contextually distinct details into the crime stories about less severe injuries.&lt;ref name="Stalans1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stalans|first1=Loretta J.|title=Citizens' crime stereotypes, biased recall, and punishment preferences in abstract cases: The educative role of interpersonal sources.|journal=Law and Human Behavior|volume=17|issue=4|year=1993|pages=451–470|issn=1573-661X|doi=10.1007/BF01044378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar study asked jurors and college students to choose sentences on four severe criminal cases in which prison was a possible but not an inevitable sentencing outcome. Respondents answering questions about court performance on a public opinion formulated a picture of what the courts do and then evaluated the appropriateness of that behavior. Respondents recalled from public information about crime and sentencing. This type of information is  incomplete because the news media present a highly selective and non-[[representative sample|representative]] selection of crime, focusing on the violent and extreme, rather than the ordinary. This makes most people think that judges are too lenient. But, when asked to choose the punishments, the sentences given by students were equal to or less severe than those given by judges. In other words, the availability heuristic made people believe that judges and jurors were too lenient in the courtroom, but the participants gave similar sentences when placed in the position of the judge, suggesting that the information they recalled was not correct.&lt;ref name="DiamondStalans1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diamond|first1=Shari Seidman|last2=Stalans|first2=Loretta J.|title=The myth of judicial leniency in sentencing|journal=Behavioral Sciences &amp; the Law|volume=7|issue=1|year=1989|pages=73–89|issn=0735-3936|doi=10.1002/bsl.2370070106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers in 1989 predicted that mock jurors would rate a witness to be '''more''' deceptive if the witness testified truthfully ''before'' lying than when the witness was caught lying first before telling the truth. If the availability heuristic played a role in this, lying second would remain in jurors' minds (since it was more recent) and they would most likely remember the witness lying over the truthfulness. To test the hypothesis, 312 university students played the roles of mock jurors and watched a videotape of a witness presenting testimony during a trial. Results confirmed the hypothesis, as mock jurors were most influenced by the most recent act.&lt;ref name="deTurckTexter1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=deTurck|first1=M. A.|last2=Texter|first2=L. A.|last3=Harszlak|first3=J. J.|title=Effects of Information Processing Objectives on Judgments of Deception Following Perjury|journal=Communication Research|volume=16|issue=3|year=1989|pages=434–452|issn=0093-6502|doi=10.1177/009365089016003006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perceived risk===
Previous studies have indicated that explaining a hypothetical event makes the event seem more likely through the creation of causal connections. However, such effects could arise through the use of the availability heuristic; that is, subjective likelihood is increased by an event becoming easier to imagine.&lt;ref name="Carroll1978"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carroll|first1=John S.|title=The effect of imagining an event on expectations for the event: An interpretation in terms of the availability heuristic|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=14|issue=1|year=1978|pages=88–96|issn=0022-1031|doi=10.1016/0022-1031(78)90062-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vividness effects===
Two studies with 108 undergraduates investigated vivid information and its impact on social judgment and the availability heuristic and its role in mediating vividness effects.

In study 1, Subjects listened to a tape recording that described a woman who lived with her 7-year-old son. Subjects then heard arguments about the woman's fitness as a parent and were asked to draw their own conclusions regarding her fitness or unfitness. Concrete and colorful language was found to influence judgments about the woman's fitness as a mother.

In study 2, a series of male and female names was presented to subjects; for each name, subjects were told the university affiliation of the individual (Yale or Stanford). When some names were presented, subjects were simultaneously shown a photograph that purportedly portrayed the named individual. Subsequently, to assess what subjects could remember (as a measure of availability), each name was re-presented, as well as the appropriate photograph if one had been originally presented. The study considered whether the display or non-display of photographs biased subjects' estimates as to the percentage of Yale (vs Stanford) students in the sample of men and women whose names appeared on the original list, and whether these estimated percentages were causally related to the respondents' memory for the college affiliations of the individual students on the list. The presence of photographs affected judgments about the proportion of male and female students at the two universities. Such effects have typically been attributed to the ready accessibility of vividly presented information in memory—that is, to the availability heuristic.

In both studies, vividness affected both availability (ability to recall) and judgments. However, causal modeling results indicated that the availability heuristic did not play a role in the judgment process.&lt;ref name="ShedlerManis1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shedler|first1=Jonathan|last2=Manis|first2=Melvin|title=Can the availability heuristic explain vividness effects?|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=51|issue=1|year=1986|pages=26–36|issn=1939-1315|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.51.1.26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judging frequency and probability===
In general, availability is correlated with ecological frequency, but it is also affected by other factors. Consequently, the reliance on the availability heuristic leads to systematic biases. Such biases are demonstrated in the judged frequency of classes of words, of combinatorial outcomes, and of repeated events. The phenomenon of illusory correlation is explained as an availability bias.&lt;ref name="tversky" /&gt;

In the original Tversky and Kahneman (1973) research, three major factors that are discussed are the [[frequency]] of repetition, frequency of co-occurrence, and [[illusory correlation]]. The use of frequency of repetition aids in the retrieval of relevant instances. The idea behind this phenomenon, is that the more an instance is repeated within a category or list, the stronger the link between the two instances becomes. Individuals then use the strong association between the instances to determine the frequency of an instance. Consequently, the association between the category or list and the specific instance, often influences frequency judgements. Frequency of co-occurrence strongly relates to Frequency of repetition, such that the more an item-pair is repeated, the stronger the association between the two items becomes, leading to a bias when estimating frequency of co-occurrence. Due to the phenomena of frequency of co-occurrence, [[Illusory correlations]] also often play a big role.&lt;ref name="tversky" /&gt;

Another factor that affects the availability heuristic in frequency and probability is exemplars. Exemplars are the typical examples that stand out during the process of recall. If asked what participants thought different set sizes were (how many men and how many women are in the class), participants would use exemplars to determine the size of each set.  Participants would derive their answer on ease of recall of the names that stood out. Participants read a list of names of members of a class for 30 seconds, and then participants were asked the male to female ratio of the class. The participant's answer would depend on the recall of exemplars. If the participant reading the list recalled seeing more common male names, such as Jack, but the only female names in the class were uncommon names, such as Deepika, then the participant will recall that there were more men than women. The opposite would be true if there were more common female names on the list and uncommon male names. Due to the availability heuristic, names that are more easily available are more likely to be recalled, and can thus alter judgments of probability.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manis|first1=Melvin|last2=Jonides|first2=Jonathan|last3=Shedler|first3=John|last4=Nelson|first4=Thomas|title=Availability Heuristic in Judgments of Set Size and Frequency of Occurrence|journal=Journal of Personality &amp; Social Psychology|date=1993|volume=65|issue=3|pages=448–457|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.65.3.448}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of the availability heuristic and exemplars would be seeing a shark in the ocean. Seeing a shark has a greater impact on an individual's memory than seeing a dolphin.  If someone sees both sharks and dolphins in the ocean, they will be less aware of seeing the dolphins, because the dolphins had less of an impact on their memory. Due to the greater impact of seeing a shark, the availability heuristic can influence the probability judgement of the ratio of sharks and dolphins in the water. Thus, an individual who saw both a shark and a dolphin would assume a higher ratio of sharks in the water, even if there are more dolphins in reality.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Critiques==

=== Ease of recall as a critique ===
One of the earliest and most powerful critiques of the original Tversky and Kahneman&lt;ref name="TverskyKahneman1974"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tversky|first1=A.|last2=Kahneman|first2=D.|title=Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases|journal=Science|volume=185|issue=4157|year=1974|pages=1124–1131|issn=0036-8075|doi=10.1126/science.185.4157.1124|pmid=17835457|bibcode=1974Sci...185.1124T}}&lt;/ref&gt; study on the availability heuristic was the Schwarz et al.&lt;ref name="schwarz" /&gt; study which found that the ease of recall was a key component in determining whether a concept became available.  Many studies since this criticism of the original availability heuristic model have repeated this initial criticism, that the ease of recall factor became an integral facet of the availability heuristic itself (see Research section).

=== Alternative explanations ===
Much of the criticism against the availability heuristic has claimed that making use of the content that become available in our mind is not based on the ease of recall as suggested by Schwarz et al.&lt;ref name="schwarz" /&gt;  For example, it could be argued that recalling more words that begin with K than words with the third letter being K could arise from how we categorize and process words into our memory.  If we categorize words by first letter, and recall them through the same process, this would show more support for the representativeness heuristic than the availability heuristic.  Based on the possibility of explanations such as these, some researchers have claimed that the classic studies on the availability heuristic are too vague in that they fail to account for people's underlying mental processes.  Indeed, a study conducted by Wanke et al. demonstrated this scenario can occur in situations used to test the availability heuristic.&lt;ref name="wanke"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wänke|first1=Michaela|last2=Schwarz|first2=Norbert|last3=Bless|first3=Herbert|title=The availability heuristic revisited: Experienced ease of retrieval in mundane frequency estimates|journal=Acta Psychologica|volume=89|issue=1|year=1995|pages=83–90|issn=0001-6918|doi=10.1016/0001-6918(93)E0072-A}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Future studies should be conducted to determine if and when this alternative explanation will occur.

A second line of study has shown that frequency estimation may not be the only strategy we use when making frequency judgments.  A recent line of research has shown that our situational working memory can access long term memories, and this memory retrieval process includes the ability to determine more accurate probabilities.&lt;ref name="HulmeRoodenrys1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hulme|first1=Charles|last2=Roodenrys|first2=Steven|last3=Brown|first3=Gordon|last4=Mercer|first4=Robin|title=The role of long-term memory mechanisms in memory span|journal=British Journal of Psychology|volume=86|issue=4|year=1995|pages=527–536|issn=0007-1269|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1995.tb02570.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This finding suggests that more research should be conducted to determine how much memory activation affects the availability heuristic.

'''''Bhūmi''''' ([[Sanskrit]]: भूमि) is the 32 and 33 place (10 and 11 in simple count) on the outgoing's process of [[Mahayana]] [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|awakening]]. In [[Buddhism]], initially the [[monks]] who arrived at ''Bhūmi'' were called [[śrāvakas]] in opposition to [[Brahminism]]. [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Śakro devānām]] and [[Trāyastriṃśa]] are together called "Bhūmi nivāsin".

The Sanskrit term ''[[wikt:भूमि#Sanskrit|bhūmi]]'' literally means "ground" or "foundation". Each stage represents a level of attainment in that case, and serves as a basis for the next one. Each level marks a definite advancement in one's training, that is accompanied by progressively greater power and wisdom.

Another term used to describe the ten [[bodhisattva]] stages was "vihara" (abode, dwelling).&lt;ref&gt;Takeuchi Yoshinori (editor). Buddhist Spirituality: Indian, Southeast Asian, Tibetan, and Early Chinese, page 164&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Five Paths==
The bhūmis are subcategories of the Five Paths (''pañcamārga'', [[Wylie transliteration|Wylie Tibetan]] ''lam lnga''):&lt;ref name="5paths"&gt;[http://www.losangsamten.com/files/04_intro_buddhist_path_5_paths.pdf Losangsamten, ''Introduction to the Buddhist Path'']&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''The path of accumulation''' (''saṃbhāra-mārga'', Wylie Tibetan: ''tshogs lam''). Persons on this Path:
## Possess a strong desire to overcome suffering, either their own or others;
## Renounce the worldly life.&lt;ref name="5paths" /&gt;
#'''The path of preparation''' or '''application''' (''prayoga-mārga'', Wylie Tibetan: ''sbyor lam''). Persons on this Path:
## Start practicing meditation;
## Have analytical knowledge of [[Sunyata|emptiness]].&lt;ref name="5paths" /&gt;
#'''The path of seeing''' (''[[darśana]]-mārga'', Wylie Tibetan: ''mthong lam''). Persons on this Path:
## Practice profound [[Samatha|concentration meditation]] on the nature of reality;
## Realize the emptiness of reality.&lt;ref name="5paths" /&gt;
#'''The path of meditation''' (''[[bhāvanā]]-mārga'', Wylie Tibetan: ''sgom lam''). Persons on this path purify themselves and accumulate [[Wisdom in Buddhism|wisdom]].&lt;ref name="5paths" /&gt;
#'''The path of no more learning''' or '''consummation''' (''aśaikṣā-mārga'', Wylie Tibetan: ''mi slob pa’i lam'' or ''thar phyin pa'i lam''). Persons on this Path have completely purified themselves.&lt;ref name="5paths" /&gt;

Passage through the grounds and paths begins with [[Bodhicitta]], the wish to liberate all sentient beings. ''Aspiring Bodhicitta'' becomes ''Engaging Bodhicitta'' upon actual commitment to the [[Bodhisattva vows]]. With these steps, the practitioner becomes a [[Bodhisattva]], and enters upon the paths.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gyatso|2003|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=pHrATkNDRtkC&amp;pg=PA536 pp. 535–536]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before attaining the ten grounds, the bodhisattva traverses the first two of the five [[Mahayana]] paths:
#The path of accumulation
#The path of preparation

The ten grounds of the bodhisattva are grouped within the three subsequent paths:
#Bhūmi 1: The path of seeing
#Bhūmi 2-7: The path of meditation
#Bhūmi 8-10: The path of no more learning

In [[Huayan school|Hua-yen]] Buddhism there are some 40 previous stages before the first bhumi:
* [[10 faiths]]
* [[10 abodes]]
* [[10 practices]]
* [[10 merit-transferences]]

In [[Tientai]] Buddhism the practitioner of the so-called "perfect teaching" is equal in attainment to [[arhats]] by just the 4th faith.

Mahayana literature often features an enumeration of "two obstructions" (Wylie: ''sgrib gnyis''): 
# The "obstructions of delusive emotions" (Sanskrit: ''kleśa-varaṇa'', Wylie: ''nyon-mongs-pa'i sgrib-ma'')
# The "obstructions to knowledge" (Sanskrit: ''jñeyāvaraṇa'', Wylie: ''shes-bya'i sgrib-ma'').&lt;ref&gt;Dorje, Jikdrel Yeshe ([[Dudjom Rinpoche]], author), translated and edited: [[Gyurme Dorje]] and [[Matthew Kapstein]] (1991). ''The Nyingma School of Tibetan Buddhism: Its Fundamentals and History''. Boston, USA: Wisdom Publications. {{ISBN|0-86171-199-8}}, p.&amp;nbsp;107(Enumerations).&lt;/ref&gt; 
The obstruction of delusive emotions  is overcome at the attainment of the path of seeing, and the obstructions to knowledge are overcome over the course of the path of meditation. This is not a statement agreed upon by all Buddhist schools, e.g. [[Korean Son]]'s [[Kihwa]] states that the obstructions to knowledge are overcome by the 10th bhumi.

==Ten bhūmis==
The [[Avatamsaka Sutra|Avataṃsakasūtra]] refers to the following ten bhūmis.&lt;ref&gt;Sutra Translation Committee of the United States and Canada (1998).

# '''''The first bhūmi, the Very Joyous.''''' (Skt. ''pramuditā''), in which one rejoices at realizing a partial aspect of the truth;
# '''''The second bhūmi, the Stainless.''''' (Skt. ''vimalā''), in which one is free from all defilement;
# '''''The third bhūmi, the Light-Maker.''''' (Skt. ''prabhākarī''), in which one radiates the light of wisdom;
# '''''The fourth bhūmi, the Radiant Intellect.''''' (Skt. ''arciṣmatī''), in which the radiant flame of wisdom burns away earthly desires;
# '''''The fifth bhūmi, the Difficult to Master.''''' (Skt. ''sudurjayā''), in which one surmounts the illusions of darkness, or ignorance as the [[Middle Way]];
# '''''The sixth bhūmi, the Manifest.''''' (Skt. ''abhimukhī'') in which supreme wisdom begins to manifest;
# '''''The seventh bhūmi, the Gone Afar.''''' (Skt. ''dūraṃgamā''), in which one rises above the states of the [[Two vehicles]];
# '''''The eighth bhūmi, the Immovable.''''' (Skt. ''acalā''), in which one dwells firmly in the truth of the [[Middle Way]] and cannot be [[perturbed]] by anything;
# '''''The ninth bhūmi, the Good Intelligence.''''' (Skt. ''sādhumatī''), in which one preaches the Law freely and without restriction;
# '''''The tenth bhūmi, the Cloud of Doctrine.''''' (Skt. ''dharmameghā''), in which one benefits all [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]] with the Law ([[Dharma]]), just as a cloud sends down rain impartially on all things.

=== The first bhūmi, the Very Joyous ===
The First bhūmi, called "Very Joyous", is attained with the first direct perception of emptiness ([[Sunyata]]) and is simultaneous with entry into the third of the five paths to awakening, the path of seeing.&lt;ref&gt;This explanation is given by the Korean scholar Wonch'uk in his ''Commentary on the Sutra Explaining the Thought (Arya-gambhīra-saṃdhinirmocana-sūtra-ṭīkā; 'Phags pa dgongs pa zab mo nges par 'grel pa'i mdo'i rgya cher 'grel pa;'' Delhi: Delhi Karmapae Choedhey, Gyalwae Sungrab Partun Khang, 1985, ''mdo 'grel,'' vol. ''thi'' [119], p. 523.3)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Nargajuna's ''Precious Garland'' (''Ratnāvalī''; tr. {{harvp|Hopkins|1974}}), verse 441.&lt;/ref&gt; It is called "very joyous" because the bodhisattva works at the perfections of generosity and develops the ability to give away everything without regret and with no thought of praise or reward (for themselves). All phenomena are viewed as empty and as subject to decay, suffering, and death, and so bodhisattvas lose all attachment to them. According to [[Tsong Khapa]], first level bodhisattvas directly understand that persons do not exist by way of their own nature. Due to this, they overcome the false idea that the five aggregates constitute a truly existent person. They also eliminate predispositions toward corrupted ethics so completely that they will not arise again.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hopkins|1985|pp=140–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite having directly and correctly perceived (but not yet realized) emptiness, bodhisattvas on the first level are primarily motivated by [[fait in Buddhism|faith]]. While they can return to the authentic perception of emptiness within the context of formal practice or receiving instruction, during post-meditation their awareness of emptiness is largely analytical or faith-based. They train in ethics in order to cleanse their minds of negativity and, so they prepare themselves for the cultivation of mundane meditative absorption that comes on the second level.

=== The second bhūmi, the Stainless ===
Bodhisattvas on the second level, the "Stainless", perfect ethics and overcome all tendencies towards engagement in negative actions. Their control becomes so complete that even in dreams they have no immoral thoughts. According to Tsong Khapa for such a bodhisattva, &lt;blockquote&gt;
"on all occasions of waking and dreaming his movements or activities of body, speech and mind are pure of even subtle infractions...he fulfills the three paths of virtuous actions-abandoning killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct-with his body; the middle four-abandons lying, divisive talk, harsh speech, and senseless chatter-with his speech; and the last three-abandoning covetousness, harmful intent, and wrong views-with his mind. Not only does he refrain from what is prohibited but he also fulfills all the positive achievements related to proper ethics."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hopkins|1985|pp=193–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And according to Nāgārjuna,
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
The second is called the Stainless
Because all ten [virtuous] actions
Of body, speech, and mind are stainless
And they naturally abide in those [deeds of ethics].
Through the maturation of those [good qualities]
The perfection of ethics becomes supreme.
They become Universal Monarchs helping beings,
Masters of the glorious four continents and of the seven precious objects.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because of this, the bodhisattva's mind becomes purified and equinanimous, which is a prerequisite for training in the four [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]]s (meditative absorptions) and the four [[arūpajhāna]]s (formless absorptions).

=== The third bhūmi, the Light-Maker ===
Tsong Khapa states that the third bhūmi is called the "Light-Maker" because when it is attained "the fire of wisdom burning all the fuel of objects of knowledge arises along with a light which by nature is able to extinguish all elaborations of duality during meditative equipoise."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hopkins|1985|p=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bodhisattvas on this level cultivate the perfection of patience. Their equanimity becomes so profound that

&lt;blockquote&gt;even if someone...cuts from the body of this bodhisattva not just flesh but also bone, not in large sections but bit by bit, not continually but pausing in between, and not finishing in a short time but cutting over a long period, the bodhisattva would not get angry at the mutilator.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hopkins|1985|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Bodhisattva realizes that his tormentor is motivated by afflicted thoughts and is sowing seeds of his own future suffering. As a result, the bodhisattva feels not anger, but a deep sadness and compassion for this cruel person, who is unaware of the operations of karma. Trainees on the third level overcome all tendencies toward anger, and never react with hatred (or even annoyance) to any harmful acts or words. Rather, their equanimity remains constant, and all sentient beings are viewed with love and compassion:

All anger and resentment rebound on the person who generates them, and they do nothing to eliminate harms that one has already experienced. They are counterproductive in that they destroy one's peace of mind and lead to unfavorable future situations. There is nothing to be gained through anger and resentment, revenge does nothing to change the past, and so the bodhisattva avoids them.

Bodhisattvas on this level also train in the four [[Rupajhana|form meditations]], the four [[arūpajhāna|formless meditations]], and the [[Brahma-vihara|four immeasurables]], and the [[Abhijna|higher knowledges]].

=== The fourth bhūmi, the Radiant Intellect ===
On the fourth level, the "Radiant Intellect", bodhisattvas cultivate the perfection of effort and eliminate afflictions. According to Wonch'uk, this level is so named because fourth bhumi bodhisattvas "constantly emit the radiance of exalted wisdom." He also cites [[Maitreya-nātha|Maitreya's]] ''[[Mahayana-sutra-alamkara-karika|Ornament for the Mahayana Sutras]]'', which explains that bodhisattvas on this level burn up the afflictive obstructions and the obstructions to omniscience with the radiance of their wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Wongch'uk, vol. ''thi'' [119], p. 527.5.&lt;/ref&gt; They enter into progressively deeper meditative absorptions and attain a powerful mental pliancy as a result. This eliminates laziness and increases their ability to practice meditation for extended periods of time. They destroy deeply rooted afflictions and cultivate the [[Bodhipakkhiyādhammā|thirty-seven factors of awakening]].

Through training in these thirty-seven practices, bodhisattvas develop great skill in meditative absorptions and cultivate wisdom, while weakening the artificial and innate conceptions of true existence.

=== The fifth bhūmi, Difficult to Master ===
The fifth level is called the "Difficult to Master" because it involves practices that are so arduous and require a great deal of effort to perfect. It is also called the "Difficult to Overcome" because when one has completed the training of this level one has profound wisdom and insight that are difficult to surpass or undermine. According to Nāgārjuna,&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
The fifth is called the Extremely Difficult to Overcome
Since all evil ones find it extremely hard to conquer him;
He becomes skilled in knowing the subtle
Meanings of the noble truths and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hopkins|1974|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Bodhisattvas on this level cultivate the perfection of [[Samādhi (Buddhism)|samadhi]]. They develop strong powers of meditative stabilization and overcome tendencies toward distraction. They achieve mental one-pointedness and they perfect calm abiding. They also fully penetrate the meanings of the [[four noble truths]] and the two truths (conventional truths and ultimate truths) and perceive all phenomena as empty, transient and prone to suffering.

=== The sixth bhūmi, the Manifest ===
The sixth level is called the "Manifest" because the bodhisattva clearly perceives the workings of [[dependent arising]] and directly understands "the signless" (''Mtshan ma med pa'', Tibetan. ''Animitta'', Sanskrit). The signless refers to the fact that phenomena seem to possess their apparent qualities by way of their own nature, but when one examines this appearance one realizes that all qualities are merely mentally imputed and not a part of the nature of the objects they appear to characterize.

As a result of these understandings bodhisattvas manifest [[meditation|meditative]] [[Wisdom in Buddhism|wisdom]] and avoid attachment to either [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|cyclic existence]] or [[nirvana]].&lt;ref&gt;This explanation is given by Wonch'uk (vol. ''thi'' [119], p. 531.1, whose source is the ''Sutra on the Ten Bhumis''&lt;/ref&gt; Having overcome all attachments, [[bodhisattva]]s on this level can attain [[nirvana]], but because of the force of the mind of awakening they decide to remain in the world in order to benefit other [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]]. They cultivate the [[Perfection of Wisdom]], through which they perceive all phenomena as lacking inherent existence, as being like dreams, illusions, reflections, or magically created objects. All notions of "I" and "other" are transcended, along with conceptions of "inherent existence" and "inherent nonexistence." These sixth-level bodhisattvas abide in contemplation of suchness, with minds that are undisturbed by false ideas.

=== The seventh bhūmi, the Gone Afar ===
Bodhisattvas on the seventh level develop the ability to contemplate signlessness uninterruptedly and enter into advanced [[jhana|meditative absorptions]] for extended periods of time, thus passing beyond both the [[mundane]] and [[supramundane]] paths of [[śrāvaka]]s and [[Pratyekabuddha]]s (Hearers and solitary realizers). For this reason, this level is called the "Gone Afar."&lt;ref&gt;This explanation is given by Wonch'uk (vol. ''thi'' [119], p. 532.6), on a basis of a commentary on the ''Sutra on the Ten Bhumis'', but he does not provide that exact title.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nāgārjuna, &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
The seventh is the Gone Afar because
The number of his qualities has increased,
Moment by moment he can enter
The equipoise of [[nirvana|cessation]],&lt;ref name="Hopkins_1974_86"&gt;{{harv|Hopkins|1974|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On this level bodhisattvas perfect their [[Upaya|skill in means of meditation and practice]] (''Thabs la mkhas pa'', Tibetan; ''Upaya-Kausalya'', Sanskrit), which is their ability to cleverly adapt their teaching tactics to the individual proclivities and needs of their audiences. They also develop the ability to know the thoughts of others, and in every moment are able to practice all the [[paramita|perfections]]. All thoughts and actions are free from afflictions, and they constantly act spontaneously and effectively for the benefit of others.

=== The eighth bhūmi, the Immovable ===
The eighth level is called the "Immovable" because [[bodhisattva]]s overcome all afflictions regarding signs and their minds are always completely absorbed in the [[dharma]].  At this level, a bodhisattva has achieved [[Nirvana#mahayana perspectives|nirvana]]. According to [[Nāgārjuna]],&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
The eighth is the Immovable, the youthful stage,
Through nonconceptuality he is immovable;
And the spheres of his body, speech and mind's
Activities are inconceivable.&lt;ref name="Hopkins_1974_86"/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Because they are fully acquainted with signlessness, their minds are not moved by ideas of signs. Eighth Bhumi bodhisattvas are said to be "irreversible", because there is no longer any possibility that they might waver on the path or backslide. They are destined for full buddhahood, and there are no longer any inclinations to seek a personal nirvana. They cultivate the "perfection of aspiration", which means that they undertake to fulfill various vows, due to which they accumulate the causes of further virtues.&lt;ref&gt;This explanation is found in the ''Compendium of Mahayana'', p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Although they resolve to work for the benefit of others and they pervade the universe with feelings of [[metta|friendliness]] toward all sentient beings, these bodhisattvas have transcended any tendency to misunderstand [[anatta]].

Their understanding of [[sunyata|emptiness]] is so complete that it overturns innate delusions, and reality appears in a completely new light. They enter into [[sunyata|meditation on emptiness]] with little effort. Bodhisattvas on this level are compared to people who have awakened from dreams, and all their perceptions are influenced by this new awareness. They attain the meditative state called "forbearance regarding [[Anutpada|non-arisen phenomena]]", due to which they no longer think in terms of inherent causes or inherent causelessness. They also develop the ability to manifest in various forms in order to instruct others. Compassion and skillful means are automatic and spontaneous. There is no need to plan or contemplate how best to benefit others, since bodhisattvas on the eighth level automatically react correctly to every situation.

=== The ninth bhūmi, the Good Intelligence ===
From this point on, bodhisattvas move quickly toward [[bodhi|awakening]]. Before this stage, progress was comparatively slow, like that of a boat being towed through a harbour. On the eighth through tenth bhumi, however, [[bodhisattva]]s make huge strides toward buddhahood, like a ship that reaches the ocean and unfurls its sails. On the ninth level, they fully understand the three vehicles - [[Śrāvaka|hearers]], [[Pratyekabuddha|solitary realizers]], and [[bodhisattva]]s - and perfect the ability to teach the doctrine. According to the ''Sutra Explaining the Thought'',&lt;blockquote&gt;
Because of attaining faultlessness and very extensive intelligence in terms of mastery of teaching the doctrine in all aspects, the ninth level is called the "Good Intelligence."&lt;ref&gt;''Sutra Explaining the Thought'', p. 116.3.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Ninth bhūmi bodhisattvas also acquire the "four analytical knowledges"-of fundamental concepts, meaning, grammar, and exposition. Due to this, they develop wondrous eloquence and skill in presenting doctrinal teachings. Their intelligence surpasses that of all humans and gods, and they comprehend all names, words, meanings, and languages. They can understand any question from any being. They also have the ability to answer them with a single sound, which is understood by each being according to its capacities. On this level they also cultivate the perfection of [[virya]], which means that because of the strength of their mastery of the four analytical knowledges and their meditation they are able to develop [[paramita]]s energetically and to practice them continually without becoming fatigued.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Lamotte|1973|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The tenth bhūmi, the Cloud of Dharma ===
On the tenth bhūmi, [[bodhisattva]]s overcome the subtlest traces of the afflictions. Like a cloud that pours rain on the earth, these bodhisattvas spread the dharma in all directions, and each [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient being]] absorbs what it needs in order to grow spiritually. Thus Nāgārjuna states that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The tenth is the Cloud of Dharma because&lt;br/&gt;
The rain of excellent doctrine falls,&lt;br/&gt;
The Bodhisattva is consecrated&lt;br/&gt;
With light by the Buddhas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hopkins|1974|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At this stage bodhisattvas enter into progressively deeper meditative absorptions and develop limitless powers with regard to magical formulas. They cultivate the perfection of exalted wisdom, which, according to [[Asaṅga]], enables them to increase their exalted wisdom. This in turn strengthens the other perfections. As a result, they become established in the joy of the doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lamotte|1973|pp=208–299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They acquire perfect bodies, and their minds are cleansed of the subtlest traces of the afflictions. They manifest in limitless forms for the benefit of others and transcend the ordinary laws of time and space. They are able to place entire world systems in a single pore, without diminishing them or increasing the size of the pore. When they do this, the beings inhabiting the worlds feel no discomfort, and only those who are advanced [[bodhisattva]]s even notice.

Bodhisattvas on this level receive a form of empowerment from innumerable buddhas. This is called "great rays of light", because the radiance of these bodhisattvas shines in all directions. This empowerment helps them in removing the remaining obstructions to omniscience and gives them added confidence and strength. At the final moment of this stage they enter into a meditative state called the "vajralike meditative stabilization", in which the subtlest remaining obstacles to buddhahood are overcome. They arise from this concentration as [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]].

==Additional bhūmi==
Within the 10th bhūmi, various [[Vajrayana]] schools recognize 3–13 additional bhūmi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fjdh.cn/wumin/2013/04/165725224642.html 九乘次第论集 附录 四部宗义要略] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415052512/http://www.fjdh.cn/wumin/2013/04/165725224642.html |date=April 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam''' ('''CDHRI''') is a declaration of the member states of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] adopted in [[Cairo]], Egypt, on 5 August 1990,&lt;ref name = Brems&gt;{{cite book | last = Brems | first = E | isbn = 90-411-1618-4 | title = Human rights: universality and diversity: Volume 66 of International studies in human rights | publisher = Martinus Nijhoff Publishers | year = 2001 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=INlkqsHpIFEC&amp;pg=PA241 241–84] | chapter = Islamic Declarations of Human Rights }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Conference of [[Foreign Minister]]s, 9–14 [[Muharram]] 1411H in the [[Islamic calendar]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/instree/cairodeclaration.html University of Minnesota, Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]&lt;/ref&gt;) which provides an overview on the Islamic perspective on [[human rights]], and affirms [[Islamic]] [[sharia]] as its sole source. CDHRI declares its purpose to be "general guidance for Member States [of the OIC] in the field of human rights".

This declaration is widely acknowledged as an Islamic response to the [[United Nations]]'s [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), adopted in 1948. It guarantees many of the same rights as the UDHR and serves as a living document of human rights guidelines prescribed for all members of the [[Organization of Islamic Cooperation|OIC]] (Organization of Islamic Cooperation) to follow, but restricts them explicitly to the limits set by the [[sharia]]. This greatly restricts rights with respect to the Universal Declaration, since for example, women and members of other religions do not have the same rights as men under sharia, and that [[freedom of expression]] can be severely limited for religious reasons: for example, [[blasphemy]] can even now be punishable by death, in clear opposition to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].

==History==
Various [[Muslim countries]] had criticized the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights for its failure to take into account the cultural and religious context of non-[[Western world|Western]] countries.&lt;ref&gt;National Review Online, [http://www.nationalreview.com/article/205577/human-rights-and-human-wrongs-david-g-littman Human Rights and Human Wrongs], David G. Littman, January 19, 2003, retrieved 30 May, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, Said Rajaie-Khorassani—the post-[[Iranian Revolution|revolutionary]] Iranian representative to the UN—articulated the position of his country regarding the UDHR, by saying that it was a [[Moral relativism|relativistic]] "[[Secularism|secular]] understanding of the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition", which could not be implemented by Muslims without trespassing Islamic law.&lt;ref name="Midstream"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/205577/human-rights-and-human-wrongs/david-g-littman|title=Universal Human Rights and 'Human Rights in Islam'|publisher='Midstream'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CDHRI was adopted in 1990 by members of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]]. It has been signed by 45 states so far.&lt;ref&gt;Anver M. Emon, Mark Ellis, Benjamin Glahn: [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y3hpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113 Islamic Law and International Human Rights Law] p. 113. Oxford University Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the CDHRI was presented to the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]], where it was strongly condemned by the [[International Commission of Jurists]].

==Contents==
The Declaration starts {{Citation needed|reason=A cursory glance at the source reveals that the document does not start with this sentence, but in fact begins by saying "All human beings form one family whose members are united by their subordination to Allah and descent from Adam."|date=June 2017}} by saying "All human beings form one family whose members are united by their subordination to Allah and descent from Adam." and it forbids "discrimination on the basis of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[Skin colour|colour]], [[language]], [[belief]], [[sex]], [[religion]], [[political affiliation]], [[social status]] or other considerations". It goes on to proclaim the [[sanctity of life]], and declares the "preservation of human life" to be "a duty prescribed by the [[Shariah]]". The CDHRI also guarantees non-belligerents—such as old men, [[women and children]], the wounded and sick, and [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]—the [[right to food]], shelter, and access to safety and medical treatment in times of war.

The CDHRI affords women "equal human dignity", "own rights to enjoy", "duties to perform", "own civil entity", "financial independence", and the "right to retain her name and lineage". Both men and women are given the "right to marriage" regardless of their race, colour, or nationality. The Declaration makes it incumbent upon both parents to protect the child, both before and after birth, while stressing that the [[Gender roles in Islam|husband is responsible]] for the social and financial protection of his family, including any children and wives. 

The Declaration recognises the [[Right to property|rights to property]] and [[right to privacy|privacy]] for the individuals.&lt;ref name="RuleGreenleaf2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rule|first1=James B.|last2=Greenleaf|first2=G. W.|title=Global Privacy Protection: The First Generation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L2I2Lrf1BeYC&amp;pg=PA45|date=1 January 2010|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84844-512-3|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baderin2003"/&gt; The Article 18 (b) says that "Everyone shall have the right to privacy in the conduct of his private affairs, in his home, among his family, with regard to his property and his relationships. It is not permitted to spy on him, to place him under surveillance or to besmirch his good name. The State shall protect him from arbitrary interference".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/cairodeclaration.html |title=University of Minnesota Human Rights Library |publisher=[[University of Minnesota]] |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It forbids the [[demolition]] and [[confiscation]] of any family's residence and the [[eviction]] of the family.&lt;ref name="Baderin2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baderin|first=Mashood A.|title=International Human Rights and Islamic Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RHRCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP141|date=11 September 2003|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-102182-4|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, should the family get separated in times of [[Islam and war|war]], it is the responsibility of the [[Sovereign state|state]] to "arrange visits or reunions of families".

Article 10 of the Declaration states: "Islam is the religion of unspoiled nature. It is [[Haram|prohibited]] to exercise any form of [[Al-Baqara 256|compulsion]] on man or to exploit his [[Islam and poverty|poverty]] or ignorance in order to convert him to another religion or to [[Atheism and Islam|atheism]]." Since in Islamic society all reasons for conversion away from Islam are considered to be essentially{{by whom|date=February 2018}} either compulsion or ignorance, this effectively forbids conversion away from Islam.

The Declaration protects each individual from [[Arbitrary arrest and detention|arbitrary arrest]], [[torture]], maltreatment, or indignity. Furthermore, no individual is to be used for medical or scientific experiments without his consent or at the risk of his health or of his life. It also prohibits the taking of hostages of any individual "for any purpose whatsoever". Moreover, the CDHRI guarantees the [[presumption of innocence]]; guilt is only to be proven through a trial in "which he [the defendant] shall be given all the guarantees of defence". The Declaration also forbids the promulgation of "emergency laws that would provide executive authority for such actions". Article 19 stipulates that there are no other crimes or punishments than [[Hudud#Punishments|those mentioned in the sharia]]. Sharia allows [[corporal punishment]] (whipping, amputation) and [[capital punishment]] by [[Stoning#In Islam|stoning]] or [[Beheading in Islam|decapitation]].&lt;ref&gt;There shall be no crime or punishment except as provided for in the Schari’a.&lt;/ref&gt; The right to hold public office can only be exercised in accordance with the sharia.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2003), p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

The Declaration also emphasizes the "full right to freedom and self-determination", and its opposition to [[Slavery in Islam|enslavement]], oppression, [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]], and [[Muslim conquests|colonialism]]. The CDHRI declares the [[rule of law]], establishing "equality and justice for all", [[Fiqh|with the limitations provided under Islamic law]]. The CDHRI also guarantees all individuals the "right to participate, directly or indirectly in the administration of his country's public affairs". The CDHRI also forbids any abuse of authority "subject to the Islamic Shariah."

Article 22(a) of the Declaration states that "Everyone shall have the right to [[Freedom of speech|express his opinion freely]] in such manner as would not be [[Sharia#Freedom of speech|contrary to the principles of the Shariah]]." Article 22(b) states that "Everyone shall have the right to advocate what is right, and propagate what is good, and warn against what is wrong and evil according to the norms of Islamic Shariah." Article 22(c) states: "Information is a vital necessity to society. It may not be exploited or misused in such a way as may violate sanctities and the dignity of Prophets, undermine moral and ethical values or disintegrate, corrupt or harm society, or weaken its faith." This is an explicit restriction on the freedom to make any statement which might be considered blasphemous, the penalty for the making of which might be death and as such the wording of this clause allows the death penalty for blasphemy in clear contravention of the UDHR.     Article 22(d) states that "It is not permitted to arouse nationalistic or doctrinal hatred or to do anything that may be an incitement to any form of racial discrimination."

===Religious features===
{{further information|Human rights in the Quran}}
Although the CDHRI uses a [[Universalism|universalist]] language akin to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, "quite a number of [its] features express an Islamic particularity."&lt;ref name = Brems/&gt; The [[preamble]] is mostly religious [[rhetoric]], and the particulars of the CDHRI contain numerous references to the [[Quran]], sharia, and aspects of the Islamic faith that appear on no other similar international list.&lt;ref name = Brems/&gt; The CDHRI concludes in Articles 24 and 25 that all rights and freedoms mentioned are subject to the Islamic sharia, which is the declaration's sole source.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/cairodeclaration.html Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam, Aug. 5, 1990, U.N. GAOR], World Conf. on Hum. Rts., 4th Sess., Agenda Item 5, U.N. Doc.
A/CONF.157/PC/62/Add.18 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; The CDHRI declares true religion to be the "guarantee for enhancing such dignity along the path to human [[integrity]]". It also places the responsibility for defending those rights upon the entire [[Ummah]].

==Criticism==
{{See also|Criticism of Sharia law|Human rights in Islamic countries|Application of sharia law by country|Islam and violence}}

The CDHRI has been criticized for being implemented by a set of states with widely disparate religious policies and practices who had "a shared interest in disarming international criticism of their domestic human rights record."&lt;ref name = Brems/&gt;

Article 24 of the declaration states: "All the rights and freedoms stipulated in this Declaration are subject to the Islamic Sharia." Article 19 also says: "There shall be no crime or punishment except as provided for in the Sharia."&lt;ref name="Farouh2002"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kazemi | first = F | chapter = Perspectives on Islam and Civil Society | title = Islamic Political Ethics: Civil Society, Pluralism and Conflict | editors = Hashmi SH | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]] | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-691-11310-6 | page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=5LmXFpnp_bMC&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 50] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CDHRI has been criticised for failing to guarantee [[freedom of religion]], in particular the right of each and every individual to [[Apostasy in Islam|change their religion]], as a "fundamental and non-derogable right".&lt;ref name="Farouh2002"/&gt; In a joint written statement submitted by the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] (IHEU), a [[non-governmental organization]] in special [[consultative status]], the Association for World Education (AWE) and the Association of World Citizens (AWC), a number of concerns were raised that the CDHRI limits human rights, religious freedom, and freedom of expression. The statement concludes that "The Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam is clearly an attempt to limit the rights enshrined in the UDHR and the International Covenants. It can in no sense be seen as complementary to the Universal Declaration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iheu.org/node/3162|title=The Cairo Declaration and the Universality of Human Rights|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031135736/http://www.iheu.org/node/3162|archivedate=2008-10-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2008, in an article to the United Nations, the [[Center for Inquiry]] writes that the CDHRI "undermines equality of persons and freedom of expression and religion by imposing restrictions on nearly every human right based on Islamic Sharia law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/newsroom/cfi_defends_freedom_of_expression_at_the_un_human_rights_council/|title=CFI Defends Freedom of Expression at the U.N. Human Rights Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhona Smith writes that, because of the CDHRI's reference to Shariah, it implies an inherent degree of superiority of men.&lt;ref name="Smith2003"&gt;Rhona, Smith. ''Textbook on International Human Rights'', Oxford University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|1-84174-301-1}}, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adama Dieng]]—a member of the [[International Commission of Jurists]]—has also criticised the CDHRI. He argued that the declaration gravely threatens the inter-cultural consensus on which the international human rights instruments are based; that it introduces intolerable discrimination against non-Muslims and women. He further argued that the CDHRI reveals a deliberately restrictive character in regard to certain fundamental rights and freedoms, to the point that certain essential provisions are below the legal standards in effect in a number of Muslim countries; it uses the cover of the "Islamic sharia (Law)" to justify the legitimacy of practices, such as corporal punishment, which attack the integrity and dignity of the human being.&lt;ref name="Midstream"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In 2009, the journal ''[[Free Inquiry]]'' summarized the criticism of the Cairo Declaration in an editorial: "We are deeply concerned with the changes to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] by a coalition of Islamic states within the [[United Nations]] that wishes to prohibit any criticism of religion and would thus protect Islam's limited view of human rights. In view of the conditions inside the Islamic Republic of Iran, Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the Sudan, Bangdalesh, Iraq, and Afghanistan, we should expect that at the top of their human rights agenda would be to rectify the legal inequality of women, the suppression of political dissent, the curtailment of free expression, the persecution of ethnic minorities and religious dissenters—in short, protecting their citizens from egregious human rights violations. Instead, they are worrying about protecting Islam."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kurtz, [[Austin Dacey]], and Tom Flynn. "Defaming Human Rights". ''[[Free Inquiry]]''. February/March 2009, Vol. 29, No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cognitive city''' is a term which expands the concept of the ''[[smart city]]''&lt;ref name="Portmann &amp; Finger"&gt;Portmann, E., Finger, M.: ''Smart Cities? – Ein Überblick!'' Meier, A. &amp; E. Portmann eds. Smart City. 52th ed. Heidelberg: HMD 304, 2015, pp. 470-481.&lt;/ref&gt; with the aspect of [[cognition]]. A cognitive city differs from conventional cities and smart cities in the fact that it is steadily learning through constant [[interaction]] with its [[citizen]]s through advanced [[information and communications technology|information and communications technologies]] (ICT) and that, based on this exchange of information, it becomes continuously more [[Efficiency|efficient]], more [[Sustainability|sustainable]] and more [[Resilience (engineering and construction)|resilient]].&lt;ref name="D'Onofrio &amp; Portmann"&gt;D’Onofrio, S., Portmann, E.(in print): ''Cognitive Computing in Smart Cities'', Informatik Spektrum, “Special Issue Smart Cities”, Heidelberg, Deutschland: Springer, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mostashari, A, Arnold, F., Mansouri, M., Finger, M.: ''Cognitive Cities and Intelligent Urban Governance.'' Netw Ind Q Vol. 13, No. 3, 2011, pp. 4–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Portmann, E., Finger, M.: ''Towards cognitive cities: advances in cognitive computing and its applications to the governance of large urban systems.'' Springer International Publishing, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

Cognitive cities are based on advanced ICTs which support the steady [[automation]] of daily urban processes. Additionally, learning processes are added to the underlying systems of the city which allow a system to learn from its [[past]] – meaning, the past behavior of the [[User (system)|user]] – and to adapt to changes in the environment and thus to new [[Need|requirements]]. The city learns by collecting [[data]] that has been provided by the citizens through the available ICT and by subsequently analyzing them. Both, citizens and the city, profit from this continuous interaction as well as from the ongoing learning process and they steadily develop themselves whereby also the [[collective intelligence]]&lt;ref name="Malone"&gt;Malone, T.W., Bernstein, M.S.: ''Handbook of Collective Intelligence.'' MIT Press, Cambridge, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; within the city is increased.&lt;ref name="D'Onofrio &amp; Portmann" /&gt;

== Challenges ==

Just like smart cities, cognitive cities should facilitate the response to the economic, social, ecologic, cultural and political challenges of the [[urban planning|urban development]]. The focus here lies especially on problems caused by increasing [[population growth]], [[demographic transition]], [[scarcity]] of [[resource]]s, [[pollution]] of the environment, [[global warming]] and financial uncertainties.
The most important component of all challenges of a city are the citizens themselves. Therefore, it is important to include every single inhabitant in the urban development process. This means, that by taking into account every single citizen (cf. citizen as sensors)&lt;ref&gt;Goodchild, M.F.: ''Citizens as Sensors: Web 2.0 and the volunteering of geographic infor-mation.'' GeoFocus (Editorial), 2007, Vol. 7, pp. 8-10.&lt;/ref&gt; a city can further develop itself in such a way that it can fulfill the requirements of the citizens and stay attractive for current as well as potential citizens. Only a collaboration between the city and its citizens makes a successful urban development possible.&lt;ref name="Portmann &amp; Finger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="D'Onofrio &amp; Portmann" /&gt;

== Interaction between Citizen and City ==

Such a collaboration can take place through different paths:

[[Question answering|Question-answering-system]]: As a knowledge-based system, a question-answering-system is able to give [[answer (response)|answer]]s to [[question]]s asked in [[natural language]]. Thus, an efficient [[dialogue]] between human and system should be enabled. On the basis of the collected data (cf. [[big data]]), the city is able to see which topics the citizens engage with.&lt;ref&gt;Portmann, E.: ''Cognitive Computing leads to the next level of answering questions on the Web.'' Volume 3 of Tiny Transactions on Computer Science. Online Journal, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Netzwoche"&gt;[http://www.netzwoche.ch/news/2016-10-26/staedte-und-gemeinden-im-zeitalter-der-digitalisierung.] Netzwoche. Abgerufen am 4. November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zadeh, L.A.: ''From Search Engines to Question Answering Systems –The Problems of World Knowledge, Relevance, Deduction and Precisiation.'' E. Sanchez (Ed.), Fuzzy Logic and the Semantic Web, Elsevier, 2006, pp. 163-210.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Internet of Things]] (IoT): The whole urban environment is equipped with [[sensor]]s that make all recorded data available in the cloud ([[cloud computing]]). In this way, a permanent interaction between citizens and the [[technology]] that surrounds them is developed. The citizens thus become a part of the technological infrastructure of a city. The [[Web of Things]] uses web standards to overcome IoT-challenges.&lt;ref&gt;Guinard, D., Trifa, V., Wilde, E.: ''A resource oriented architecture for the web of things.'' In Internet of Things (IOT), IEEE, 2010, pp. 1-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cloud based social feedback'', [[crowdsourcing]] and [[predictive analytics]]: Developments such as cloud based social feedback, crowdsourcing and predictive analytics allow the creation of cities which actively and independently learn to build a [[memory]], to search and also to expand that memory when new [[information]] is added to the already existing. In this way, the city acquires the ability to recognize [[behavioral pattern]]s and changes, maybe even to predict them and to react to them (possibly with new solution strategies).&lt;ref name="Netzwoche" /&gt;

== The Cognition of a City ==

The cognitive city pursues one main goal: improved information exchange for the development of [[knowledge]], the so-called collective intelligence.&lt;ref name="Malone" /&gt; Hereby not only individual experiences and perceptions are important but also the [[experience]]s and [[perception]]s of others. In order to attain this goal, the city, among other things, applies ''[[cognitive computing]]''.&lt;ref name="D'Onofrio &amp; Portmann" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Siemens"&gt;Siemens, G.: ''Connectivism: A Learning Theory for the Digital Age.'' International Journal of Instructional Technology &amp; Distance Learning, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics of Cognitive Computing ==

The theory of [[connectivism]] implies that humans do not only learn based on their own experiences but also based on the experiences of others. Thus, the knowledge base can be continually expanded. This theory emphasizes the importance of the interaction of humans and computer systems in a city as the constant interaction between city and its citizens increases their common existing knowledge.&lt;ref name="Siemens" /&gt;

A further base for cognitive computing is [[computational thinking]]. The goal of computational thinking is to find solutions to complex problems ([[problem solving]]) within a city and to get an understanding of human behavior with the help of [[computer science]]. Computational thinking allows to operate on different levels of abstraction and to mechanize them through precise [[notation]] and models.&lt;ref&gt;Wing, J.M.: ''Computational Thinking.'' Communications of the ACM, 2006, Vol. 49, Nr. 3, pp. 33-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the [[intelligence amplification]] loop, another important component of cognitive computing, implies that human and computer system continually learn from each other through interaction. A “learning loop” is developed in which the knowledge of human and system is continually expanded. Thus, the collective intelligence of a city is steadily increasing. The process of the intelligence amplification loop is characterized by the [[emergence]] which refers to the spontaneous formation of new and connected [[insight]]s through interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, M., Portmann, E., Fathi, M.: ''A Concept of Semantics Extraction from Web Data by Induction of Fuzzy Ontologies.'' IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology, 2013, pp. 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Portmann, E., Kaufmann, M., &amp; Graf, C.: ''A Distributed, Semiotic-Inductive, and Human-Oriented Approach to Web-Scale Knowledge Retrieval.'' International Workshop on Web-scale Knowledge Representation, Retrieval, and Reasoning. Maui, Hawaii, USA, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most data which can be collected in a city and from its citizens are only available in natural language, which are thus imprecise. For most of today’s computer systems it is difficult (or impossible) to directly process [[vagueness|vague]] [[input (computer science)|inputs]]. The [[data processing|processing]] and [[analysis]] of the existing data is absolutely necessary. For this reason, [[soft computing]] is applied. Contrary to traditional methods of calculation, soft computing techniques allow the inclusion of values which are described in natural language. This enables a nature-based [[precision (computer science)|precision]] of imprecise information which does justice to the perceptions of human beings. This is a necessary precondition for the application of cognitive computer systems and thus for cognitive cities.&lt;ref&gt;Zadeh, L.A.: ''Fuzzy Logic = Computing with Words.'' IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 1996, Vol. 4, No. 2, pp. 103 - 111.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zadeh, L.A.: ''Fuzzy Logic.'' IEEE Computer, 1988, Vol. 21, No. 4, pp. 83-93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zadeh, L.A.: ''Some reflections on soft computing, granular computing and their roles in the conception, design and utilization of information/intelligent systems.'' Soft Computing, 1998, Vol. 2, pp. 23-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D’Onofrio, S., Portmann, E.: ''Von Fuzzy-Sets zu Computing-with-Words.''

In mathematics, a '''condensation point''' ''p'' of a subset ''S'' of a [[topological space]], is any point ''p'', such that every [[open neighborhood]] of ''p'' contains [[uncountably many]] points of ''S''. Thus, "condensation point" is synonymous with "&lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;-[[accumulation point]]".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Condensation_point_of_a_set&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
*If ''S'' = (0,1) is the open unit interval, a subset of the [[real numbers]], then 0 is a condensation point of ''S''.
*If ''S'' is an uncountable subset of a set ''X'' endowed with the [[indiscrete topology]], then any point ''p'' of ''X'' is a condensation point of ''X'' as the only open neighborhood of ''p'' is ''X'' itself.

In the mathematical field of [[set theory]], the '''continuum''' means the [[real numbers]], or the corresponding (infinite) [[cardinal number]], &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c}&lt;/math&gt;. [[Georg Cantor]] proved that the cardinality &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c}&lt;/math&gt; is larger than the smallest infinity, namely, &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;. He also proved that &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c}&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt; 2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;, the cardinality of the [[power set]] of the [[natural numbers]].

The ''[[cardinality of the continuum]]'' is the [[cardinality|size]] of the set of real numbers. The [[continuum hypothesis]] is sometimes stated by saying that no [[cardinality]] lies between that of the continuum and that of the [[natural numbers]], &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;.

== Linear continuum == 
{{Main|Linear continuum}}
According to [[Raymond Wilder]] (1965) there are four axioms that make a set ''C'' and the relation &lt; into a '''linear continuum''':
* ''C'' is [[simply ordered set|simply ordered]] with respect to &lt;.
* If [''A,B''] is a cut of ''C'', then either ''A'' has a last element or ''B'' has a first element. (compare [[Dedekind cut]])
* There exists a non-empty, [[countable]] subset ''S'' of ''C'' such that, if ''x,y'' &amp;isin; ''C'' such that ''x'' &lt; ''y'', then there exists ''z'' &amp;isin; ''S'' such that ''x'' &lt; ''z'' &lt; ''y''. ([[separable space|separability axiom]])
* ''C'' has no first element and no last element. ([[Bounded set|Unboundedness axiom]])
These axioms characterize the [[order type]] of the [[real number line]].

'''Desmond Ravenstone''' ([[Boston, Massachusetts]]) is a writer, blogger, activist and educator on sexuality issues, who has addressed on [[BDSM]] and other [[alternative sexuality|alternative sexual identities]], and currently focuses on [[sex workers' rights]].  A former [[Unitarian Universalist]] [[lay leader]], he has frequently addressed the intersection of [[religion and sexuality|sexuality and spirituality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teach.itg.emerson.edu/surviveandthrive/2009/12/polyamorous-community-seeks-mo.html |title=Polyamorous community seeks more support from Unitarian Universalist Association |publisher=Survive And Thrive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Ravenstone first became involved in the BDSM community addressing the issue of "ravishment" or [[rape fantasy|rape fantasies]].  He wrote a number of articles and two books.&lt;ref&gt;Ravenstone, Desmond.  ''Ravishment: The Dark Side of Erotic Fantasy'' (2005)  {{ISBN|1-4116-5547-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ravenstone, Desmond.  ''Taken: A Story of Ravishment'' (2005)  {{ISBN|1-4116-5559-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; dealing with both the psychology and practical enactment of ravishment role-play,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thephoenix.com/ADULT/blogs/eroticenquirer/archive/2008/03/19/holy-whip.aspx |title=Holy Whip: Interview with Desmond Ravenstone |publisher=Thephoenix.com |date= |accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and helped to form the online Ravishment Network (RavNet) as a forum for education and advocacy.

Ravenstone has also led workshops on ravishment, [[sexual roleplaying|erotic role-playing]] and other subjects to a number of BDSM groups across the country.  He served as education coordinator for the New England Dungeon Society for two years, and authored an advice column for the online [[zine]] '‘The Dominant's View'’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedomsview.com/Vol6/I6/deardesmond.htm |title=Dear Desmond, Advice for the Kinky (archive) |publisher=Thedomsview.com |date= |accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ravenstone was a member of [[Arlington Street Church]], an historic [[Unitarian Universalist]] congregation, where he served on the worship committee as well as Co-Moderator,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ascboston.org/about/governance.html|title=Arlington Street Church - About Us: Governance }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other leadership roles; in the past, he has represented the congregation as a delegate to the Mass Bay District and the [[General Assembly (Unitarian Universalist Association)|UUA General Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uupa.org/reports/GA2014-report |title=Report on General Assembly 2014 (PDF document) |publisher=Unitarian Universalists for Polyamory Awareness |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502090905/http://uupa.org/reports/GA2014-report |archivedate=May 2, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also wrote a blog for several years, '‘‘Ravenstone's Reflections'’’, offering his thoughts on sexuality, spirituality, politics and other related topics.  This gave him a prominent place to speak on behalf of kinksters, [[polyamory|polyamorists]] and other "alt-sexers" within the UU denomination.  Ravenstone started the organization [[Leather &amp; Grace]], for UUs identified with kink and BDSM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leatherandgrace.wordpress.com |title=Leather &amp; Grace website |publisher=Leatherandgrace.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014, he published a lengthy post on his blog, defending the view that kink should be regarded as a [[sexual orientation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://ravenstonesreflections.blogspot.com/2014/10/towards-more-inclusive-model-of-sexual.html |title=Towards a More Inclusive Model of Sexual Orientation |publisher=ravenstonesreflections.blogspot.com |date=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was also carried as a guest blog on the website of the [[National Coalition for Sexual Freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web|url=https://ncsfreedom.org/?option=com_zoo&amp;task=item&amp;item_id=1007 |title=NCSF Guest Blog: Towards a More Inclusive Model of Sexual Orientation |publisher= National Coalition for Sexual Freedom |date=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, Ravenstone posted on his blog that he was leaving organized Unitarian Universalism, expressing frustration at how resistant the leadership of the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]]'s handled many issues, including those around sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ravenstonesreflections.blogspot.com/2015/10/this-is-goodbye.html |title=This is Goodbye |publisher=ravenstonesreflections.blogspot.com |date=October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, he officially ended ''Ravenstone's Reflections'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ravenstonesreflections.blogspot.com/2017/01/moving-on.html |title=Moving On ... |publisher=ravenstonesreflections.blogspot.com |date=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and announced the start of a new blog devoted specifically to [[sex workers' rights]], ''The Harlot's Bulldog''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harlotsbulldog.wordpress.com/about/ |title=The Harlot's Bulldog |publisher=harlotsbulldog.wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He currently administrates the website for Clients of Sex Workers Allied for Change (CoSWAC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sexworkclients.org |title=CoSWAC: Clients of Sex Workers Allied for Change |publisher=sexworkclients.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ravenstone is politically unaffiliated, and describes himself as a "[[left libertarianism|libertarian progressive]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/people/Desmond-Ravenstone/100000472704628 |title=Desmond Ravenstone's Facebook page |publisher=Facebook.com |date=December 8, 2010 |accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "deep pragmatist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harlotsbulldog.wordpress.com/about/ |title=The Harlot's Bulldog |publisher=harlotsbulldog.wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he ran a [[write-in]] campaign for president on a sexual freedom platform; his running-mate was [[Darklady|Theresa "Darklady" Reed]], a fellow writer and sexual-freedom activist from [[Oregon]].

[[File:Solar Spectrum.png|240px|right|thumb|Spectrum of sunlight above the atmosphere (yellow) and at sea level (red), revealing an absorption spectrum with a discrete part (such as the line due to {{chem|O|2}}) and a continuous part (such as the bands labeled {{chem|H|2|O}}).]]

A [[observable|physical quantity]] is said to have a '''discrete spectrum''' if it takes only distinct values, with gaps between one value and the next.

The classical example of discrete spectrum (for which the term was first used) is the characteristic set of discrete [[spectral line]]s seen in the [[emission spectrum]] and [[absorption spectrum]] of isolated [[atom]]s of a [[chemical element]], which only absorb and emit light at particular [[wavelength]]s. The technique of [[spectroscopy]] is based on this phenomenon.

Discrete spectra are contrasted with the [[continuous spectrum (physics)|continuous spectra]] also seen in such experiments, for example in [[thermal emission]], in [[synchrotron radiation]], and many other light-producing phenomena.

[[File:Oh No Girl Spectrogram.jpg|240px|right|thumb|[[Acoustic spectrogram]] of the words "Oh, no!" said by a young girl, showing how the discrete{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} spectrum of the sound (bright orange lines) changes with time (the horizontal axis).]]
Discrete spectra are seen in many other phenomena, such as vibrating [[string (music)|string]]s, [[microwave]]s in a [[microwave cavity|metal cavity]], [[sound wave]]s in a [[pulsating star]], and [[resonance (particle physics)|resonances]] in high-energy [[particle physics]].

The general phenomenon of discrete spectra in physical systems can be mathematically modeled with tools of [[functional analysis]], specifically by the [[decomposition of spectrum (functional analysis)|decomposition of the spectrum]] of a [[linear operator]] acting on a [[functional space]].

==Origins of discrete spectra==

=== Classical mechanics ===
In [[classical mechanics]], discrete spectra are often associated to [[wave]]s and [[oscillation]]s in a bounded object or domain.  Mathematically they can be identified with the [[eigenvalue]]s of [[differential operator]]s that describe the evolution of some continuous variable (such as [[deformation (mechanics)|strain]] or [[pressure]]) as a function of time and/or space.

Discrete spectra are also produced by some [[non-linear oscillator]]s where the relevant quantity has a non-[[sinusoid]]al [[waveform]].  Notable examples are the sound produced by the [[vocal chord]]s of mammals.&lt;ref name=pulak&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.684}} and the [[stridulation]] organs of [[cricket]]s,&lt;ref name=popov&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; whose spectrum shows a series of strong lines at frequencies that are integer multiples ([[harmonic]]s) of the [[fundamental frequency|oscillation frequency]].

A related phenomenon is the appearance of strong harmonics when a sinusoidal signal (which has the ultimate "discrete spectrum", consisting of a single spectral line) is modified by a non-linear [[filter (signal processing)|filter]]; for example, when a [[pure tone]] is played through an overloaded [[amplifier]],&lt;ref name=klip&gt;
  Paul V. Klipsch (1969), [http://www.elpee.info/Documenten/KlipschVervorming.pdf ''Modulation distortion in loudspeakers''] Journal of the Audio Engineering Society.
&lt;/ref&gt; or when an intense [[monochromatic]] [[laser]] beam goes through a [[non-linear optics|non-linear medium]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  In the latter case, if two arbitrary sinusoidal signals with frequencies ''f'' and ''g'' are processed together, the output signal will generally have spectral lines at frequencies |''mf'' + ''ng''| where ''m'' and ''n'' are any integers.

=== Quantum mechanics ===
{{main|Spectrum (functional analysis) #Point spectrum}}
In [[quantum mechanics]], the discrete spectrum of an observable corresponds to the [[eigenvalue]]s of the [[operator (physics)|operator]] used to model that observable.  According to the [[functional analysis|mathematical theory of such operators]], its eigenvalues are a discrete set of [[isolated point]]s, which may be either [[finite set|finite]] or [[countable set|countable]].

Discrete spectra are usually associated with systems that are [[bound state|bound]] in some sense (mathematically, confined to a [[compact space]]).  The [[position operator|position]] and [[momentum operator]]s have continuous spectra in an infinite domain, but a discrete (quantized) spectrum in a compact domain &lt;ref name=LL&gt;L. D. Landau, E. M. Lifshitz,  [https://archive.org/details/QuantumMechanics_104 Quantum Mechanics ( Volume 3 of A Course of Theoretical Physics ) Pergamon Press 1965]&lt;/ref&gt;  and the same properties of spectra hold for [[angular momentum]], [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonians]] and other operators of  quantum  systems.&lt;ref name= LL /&gt;

The [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] and the [[hydrogen atom]] are examples of physical systems in which the Hamiltonian has a discrete spectrum. In the case of the hydrogen atom the spectrum has both a continuous and a discrete part, the continuous part representing the [[ionization]].

{{Refimprove|date=December 2007}}

'''Evasion''' in [[law]], is a fundamental [[public policy (law)|public policy]] doctrine, which exists also in the [[conflict of laws]].

==Definition==
Although one may legitimately plan affairs to avoid the incidence of obligations or liabilities imposed by the law, but no one may evade the operation of otherwise-mandatory provisions if duties and liabilities have been properly imposed or incurred.

It is a standard doctrine in most [[jurisdiction]]s: in [[France]], it is termed, ''fraude à la loi'', in [[Spain]], ''fraude de ley'', in [[Italy]], ''violazione di norme di legge'', in [[Germany]], ''Rechtswidrige Umgehung eines Gesetzes''. It reflects the need for [[government]]s to prevent their [[citizen]]s from intentionally and improperly manipulating their behaviour to prevent mandatory provisions in the law from applying to them. As the translated names necessarily imply, the key is an intention to displace the normal operation of the legal system.

Sometimes, that intention is express. On other occasions, it is for the courts to decide whether a sufficient intention can be imputed. Once the intention is established, the evasive manoeuvre is void, and the normal legal provisions will apply to the parties.

==Taxation==
Almost all [[state (polity)|states]] operate a collection system for [[taxation]] revenues within a framework of law that is enforced by independent [[court]]s. Enabling [[statute]]s must be strictly applied, and it is generally against public policy to allow the tax administration to agree to reduce the amount of tax payable by any individual. Like [[criminal law]] in which agreements by the policing authorities to exempt a criminal are prohibited, tax law has a special status as being essential to an organised society in maintaining public trust through the policy of equal treatment in the legal system.

Nevertheless, a taxpayer who organises affairs to exploit a loophole in the law to avoid the incidence of tax liability will usually be permitted to do so. It is not for the courts to legislate and plug the gaps left by the legislature.

The test of avoidance is whether there is a legitimate purpose for the given behaviour. Many states adopt a "business purpose" test, by decomposing the transaction into its component steps to determine the true purpose of the transaction(s) (see [[tax avoidance]]).

==Family law==
In [[Family law]], the citizens of any state may not be allowed to evade rules like those on [[marriage]] by blood relatives or by persons of the same biological sex only by travelling to and going through a ceremony in a state that allows them. The policies underpinning such laws are so fundamental to the [[culture]] of a state that they acquire mandatory status (see [[nullity (conflict)|nullity]]). The same applies to [[divorce (conflict)|divorce]].

An early case in [[France]] (under the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law system]]), known as the ''Princess Bauffremont Affair'' decided by the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Cour de cassation]] in 1878 [Civ. 18 mars 1878, S.78.1.193 (note Labbé)] saw the princess obtain [[citizenship]] in [[Germany]] to obtain a divorce there and then remarry. She returned to France where she attempted to re-establish herself. Because the divorce was not recognised in France, her remarriage was declared null as a ''fraude à la loi''.

==Contract law==
In [[Contract law]], as an exception to the principle of autonomy implicit in the policy of [[freedom of contract]], the parties cannot agree to a voluntary agreement to evade obligations imposed by law or to prevent the courts from taking jurisdiction if a dispute arises.

Also, the courts will examine the entire context for any series of transactions that seeks to avoid the operation of law. Hence, if it is illegal to export particular goods from X to A, such a law cannot be evaded by entering into back-to-back agreements to export the goods first to Y and then to A.

Some laws are so fundamental that they can never be evaded. Thus, even though the contracts might be perfectly legal, they would be denied enforcement if the effect would be against public policy, such as the following: 
*protection from unreasonable [[restraint of trade|restraints of trade]], such as [[non-compete clause|agreements not to compete]] after terminating [[employment]] or selling a business must allow individuals a reasonable opportunity to earn a living.
*protection of family relationships: an agreement relating to the custody of a child and maintenance cannot exclude the power of a court to examine its terms and to judge whether it is in the best interests of the child.
*Prevention of the enforcement of contracts:
::involving commission of a [[tort]] or crime;
::inducing breach of fiduciary duties;
::inducing a breach in a contract with a third party;
::disclaiming liability for harm caused intentionally, recklessly or negligently (including liability for any misrepresentation). Liability for personal injuries arising from the use of products can be disclaimed only in rare circumstances (for example, if two merchants fairly bargain for it, and the product is experimental).
::involving the waiver or release of entrenched rights: in the [[United States]], the release of rights granted by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 81 Stat. 602, 29 U.S.C. § 621 will not be effective even if supported by [[consideration]], except under the Older Workers Benefit Protection Acta.

==Conflict of laws==
At either the [[characterisation (conflict)|characterisation]] or the [[choice of law]] stage, the most usual manipulation involves the way in which the connecting factors are pleaded as between the ''[[lex fori]]'' and the ''[[lex loci]]'' so that inconvenient local laws are evaded in favour of a "foreign" law.

==Detection==
Under US [[Drug Trafficking Vessel Interdiction Act]], it is illegal to operate or embark in a submersible vessel or semi-submersible vessel without nationality on an international voyage&lt;ref&gt;{{USPL|110|407}}, §101&lt;/ref&gt; with the intent to evade detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|18|2285}}(a)&lt;/ref&gt; That is curious because one of the required proofs of nationality is the documents issued under the 1958 [[Convention on the High Seas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|18|2285}}(d)(1)&lt;/ref&gt; a convention, which Congress has never acknowledged by ratifying&lt;ref name=rufe&gt;Roger Rufe, President of the Ocean Conservancy. [http://foreign.senate.gov/testimony/2003/RufeTestimony031021.pdf Statement before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, October 21, 2003].&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
[[File:FIRA CONFERENCE - NAGPUR-1.JPG|thumb|A banner for the 8th National Conference of FIRA held in [[Nagpur]]]]
There are a number of rationalist, atheist, skeptic, and secularist groups active in the states and regions of India. It was to coordinate the activities of these organisations at the national level that as part of 10th Kerala State Conference of [[Kerala Yukthivadi Sangham]], a meeting of activists from around India was convened at [[Trivandrum]], [[Kerala]]. The meeting decided to launch a federation of all the rationalist and skeptic associations active in India. As a result, the Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations was launched on February 7, 1997 at [[Palakkad]], Kerala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Quack |first=Johannes |authorlink=Johannes Quack |date=2012 |title=Disenchanting India: Organized Rationalism and Criticism of Religion in India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6YxpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98 |location=[[New York City]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=98 |isbn=978-0-19-981260-8 |accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Basava Premanand]] of [[Indian CSICOP]], [[Tamil Nadu]] was the founder-convener of the federation. Since its foundation, the FIRA membership has increased to "nearly 50" organisations in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20050512/aplus.htm |title=FIRA’s proposal |author=Varinder Walia |publisher=[[India Tribune]] |date=12 May 2005 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to "more than 75" in 2011&lt;ref name=carvaka&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.carvaka4india.com/2012/03/8th-fira-national-conferance.html |title=Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations (FIRA) - 8th National Conference |publisher=Cārvāka 4 India |date=8 December 2011 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 83 in 2012.&lt;ref name="MR"/&gt;

Dr G Vijayam, [[Atheist Centre]], [[Vijayawada]], was elected as the patron of the association at the 8th National Conference held in [[Nagpur]] on 11 and 12 February 2012. The conference reelected [[Narendra Nayak|Prof Narendra Nayak]] of [[Dakshina Kannada Rationalist Association]], [[Karnataka]] as the national president of the association and [[Kalanathan|U.Kalanathan]] of [[Kerala Yukthivadi Sangham]] as its general secretary.&lt;ref name=carvaka/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Humanism is a democratic and ethical life stance, which affirms that human beings have the right and responsibility to give meaning and shape to their own lives. It stands for the building of a more humane society through an ethic based on human and other natural values in the spirit of reason and free inquiry through human capabilities. It is not theistic, and it does not accept supernatural views of reality."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Quantum field theory}}
In [[physics]], the '''fine-structure constant''', also known as '''Sommerfeld's constant''', commonly denoted {{math|''α''}} (the [[Alpha|Greek letter ''alpha'']]), is a [[dimensionless physical constant]] characterizing the strength of the [[electromagnetic interaction]] between elementary charged particles. It is related to the [[elementary charge]] {{math|''e''}}, which characterizes the strength of the coupling of an elementary charged particle with the [[electromagnetic field]], by the formula {{math|1=4π''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''ħcα'' = ''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Being a [[dimensionless quantity]], it has the same numerical value of about {{sfrac|137}} in all [[system of units|systems of units]].

==Definition==
Some equivalent definitions of {{math|''α''}} in terms of other fundamental [[physical constant]]s are:
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{\hbar c} = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{e^2 c}{\hbar} = \frac{k_\text{e} e^2}{\hbar c} = \frac{c \mu_0}{2 R_\text{K}} = \frac{e^2}{4 \pi}\frac{Z_0}{\hbar}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*{{math|''e''}} is the [[elementary charge]] (:= 1.602176634×10&lt;sup&gt;−19&lt;/sup&gt; C);
*{{math|π}} is the mathematical constant [[pi]];
*{{math|''ħ'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''h''|2π}}}} is the reduced [[Planck constant]] (:= {{sfrac|6.62607015×10&lt;sup&gt;−34&lt;/sup&gt; |2π}}  J s);
*{{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light in vacuum]] (:= 299792458 m/s);
*{{math|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[electric constant]] or permittivity of free space;
*{{math|''µ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[magnetic constant]] or permeability of free space;
*{{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Coulomb constant]];
*{{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[von Klitzing constant]];
*{{math|''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[vacuum impedance]] or impedance of free space.

The definition reflects the relationship between {{math|''α''}} and the permeability of free space {{math|''µ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, which equals &lt;math&gt;\mu_0 = \frac{2 \alpha}{e^2} \frac{h}{c}.&lt;/math&gt;In to the new SI system entering into force in 2019, 4{{pi}}&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;1.000 000 000 82 (20) 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; H·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is a value in the new system for {{math|''µ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} according to a new measurement of the fine structure constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/CGPM/Convocation-2018.pdf#page=30|title=Convocationde la Conférence générale des poids et mesures (26e réunion)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parker|first=Richard H.|last2=Yu|first2=Chenghui|last3=Zhong|first3=Weicheng|last4=Estey|first4=Brian|last5=Müller|first5=Holger|date=2018-04-13|title=Measurement of the fine-structure constant as a test of the Standard Model|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/191|journal=Science|language=en|volume=360|issue=6385|pages=191–195|doi=10.1126/science.aap7706|issn=0036-8075|pmid=29650669}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Richard S.|date=2017|title=Determining the value of the fine-structure constant from a current balance: Getting acquainted with some upcoming changes to the SI|url=https://doi.org/10.1119/1.4976701|journal=American Journal of Physics|language=en|volume=85|issue=5|pages=364–368|doi=10.1119/1.4976701|issn=0002-9505|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===In non-SI units===
In electrostatic [[cgs]] units, the unit of [[electric charge]], the [[statcoulomb]], is defined so that the [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb constant]], {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}}, or the [[electric constant|permittivity factor]], {{math|4π''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, is 1 and [[dimensionless]]. Then the expression of the fine-structure constant, as commonly found in older physics literature, becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{e^2}{\hbar c}. &lt;/math&gt;

In [[natural units]], commonly used in high energy physics, where {{math|1=''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''c'' = ''ħ'' = 1}}, the value of the fine-structure constant is&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
|last=Peskin |first=M.

|publisher=[[Westview Press]]
|isbn=978-0-201-50397-5
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \alpha = \frac{e^2}{4 \pi}. &lt;/math&gt;
As such, the fine-structure constant is just another, albeit dimensionless, quantity determining (or determined by) the [[elementary charge]]: {{math|1=''e'' = {{radic|4π''α''}} ≈ {{val|0.30282212}}}} in terms of such a natural unit of charge.

In [[atomic units]] ({{math|1=''e'' = ''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = ''ħ'' = 1}} and {{math|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|1|4π}}}}), the fine structure constant is
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{1}{c}. &lt;/math&gt;

The horizontal line with an arrow represents the electron while the wavy lines are virtual photons, and the circles represent virtual [[electron]]–[[positron]] pairs.]]
The 2014 [[CODATA]] recommended value of {{math|''α''}} is&lt;ref name="CODATA 2014"&gt;

This has a relative standard uncertainty of 0.23&amp;nbsp;[[parts per billion]].&lt;ref name="CODATA 2014"/&gt;

For reasons of convenience, historically the value of the [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the fine-structure constant is often specified. The 2014 CODATA recommended value is given by&lt;ref name="CODATA 2014"/&gt;
:{{math|''α''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} {{val|137.035999139|(31)}}.}}

While the value of {{math|''α''}} can be ''estimated'' from the values of the constants appearing in any of its definitions, the theory of [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED) provides a way to measure {{math|''α''}} directly using the [[quantum Hall effect]] or the [[anomalous magnetic moment]] of the [[electron]]. The theory of QED predicts a relationship between the [[g-factor (physics)|dimensionless magnetic moment]] of the [[electron]] and the fine-structure constant {{math|''α''}} (the magnetic moment of the electron is also referred to as "[[Landé g-factor|Landé {{math|''g''}}-factor]]" and symbolized as {{math|''g''}}). The most precise value of {{math|''α''}} obtained experimentally (as of 2012) is based on a measurement of {{math|''g''}} using a one-electron so-called "quantum cyclotron" apparatus, together with a calculation via the theory of QED that involved {{val|12672}} tenth-order [[Feynman diagrams]]:&lt;ref&gt;

This measurement of {{math|''α''}} has a precision of 0.25&amp;nbsp;[[parts per billion]]. This value and uncertainty are about the same as the latest experimental results.&lt;ref&gt;

==Physical interpretations==
The fine-structure constant, {{math|''α''}}, has several physical interpretations. {{math|''α''}} is:
*The square of the ratio of the [[elementary charge]] to the [[Planck charge]]
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \left( \frac{e}{q_\text{P}} \right)^2.&lt;/math&gt;
*The ratio of two energies: (i) the energy needed to overcome the [[electrostatic repulsion]] between two electrons a distance of {{math|''d''}} apart, and (ii) the energy of a single [[photon]] of wavelength {{math|''λ'' {{=}} 2π''d''}} (or of [[wavelength#Angular wavelength|angular wavelength]] {{math|''d''}}; see [[Planck relation]]):
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \left. \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 d} \right/ \frac{h c}{\lambda} = \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 d} \times {\frac{2 \pi d}{h c}} = \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 d} \times {\frac{d}{\hbar c}} = \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 \hbar c}.&lt;/math&gt;
*The ratio of the velocity of the electron in the first circular orbit of the [[Bohr model of the atom]], which is {{math|{{sfrac|1|4π''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} {{sfrac|''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|''ħ''}}}} to the [[speed of light]] in vacuum, {{math|''c''}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[NIST]] [http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/ Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty] [http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/alpha.html Current advances: The fine-structure constant and quantum Hall effect]&lt;/ref&gt; This is Sommerfeld's original physical interpretation. Then the square of {{math|''α''}} is the ratio between the [[Hartree energy]] ({{nowrap|27.2 eV {{=}} twice the [[Rydberg constant|Rydberg energy]]}} {{=}} approximately twice its ionization energy) and the [[electron]] [[rest energy]] (511&amp;nbsp;keV).
*The two ratios of three characteristic lengths: the [[classical electron radius]] {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the [[Compton wavelength]] of the electron {{math|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and the [[Bohr radius]] {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}:
:&lt;math&gt;r_\text{e} = \frac{\alpha \lambda_\text{e}}{2\pi} = \alpha^2 a_0&lt;/math&gt;
*In [[quantum electrodynamics]], {{math|''α''}} is directly related to the [[coupling constant]] determining the strength of the interaction between [[electron]]s and [[photon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Riazuddin|first1=Fayyazuddin|title=A Modern Introduction to Particle Physics|publisher=World Scientific|pages=4|edition=Third|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dbysnBTHF4QC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 April 2017|isbn=9789814338837|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory does not predict its value. Therefore, {{math|''α''}} must be determined experimentally. In fact, {{math|''α''}} is one of about 20 empirical [[Standard Model#Theoretical aspects|parameters in the Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]], whose value is not determined within the Standard Model.
*In the [[electroweak theory]] unifying the [[weak interaction]] with [[electromagnetism]], {{math|''α''}} is absorbed into two other [[coupling constant]]s associated with the electroweak [[gauge theory|gauge fields]]. In this theory, the [[electromagnetic interaction]] is treated as a mixture of interactions associated with the electroweak fields. The strength of the [[electromagnetic interaction]] varies with the strength of the [[energy]] field.
*Given two hypothetical point particles each of [[Planck mass]] and elementary charge, separated by any distance, {{math|''α''}} is the ratio of their electrostatic repulsive force to their gravitational attractive force.
*In the fields of [[electrical engineering]] and [[solid-state physics]], the fine-structure constant is one fourth the product of the characteristic [[impedance of free space]], {{math|1=''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''c''}}, and the [[conductance quantum]], {{math|1=''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = {{sfrac|2''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|''h''}}}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \tfrac{1}{4} Z_0 G_0&lt;/math&gt;.
:The [[optical conductivity]] of [[graphene]] for visible frequencies is theoretically given by {{math|{{sfrac|π''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;|4}}}}, and as a result its light absorption and transmission properties can be expressed in terms of the fine structure constant alone.&lt;ref name="NairBlake2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nair |first1=R.

*Alpha is related to the probability that an electron will emit or absorb a photon.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leon M. Lederman|Lederman, Leon]], ''The God Particle: If the Universe is the Answer, What is the Question?'' (1993), [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]], pp. 28-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]] is applied to [[quantum electrodynamics]], the resulting [[perturbative]] expansions for physical results are expressed as sets of [[power series]] in {{math|''α''}}. Because {{math|''α''}} is much less than one, higher powers of {{math|''α''}} are soon unimportant, making the perturbation theory practical in this case. On the other hand, the large value of the corresponding factors in [[quantum chromodynamics]] makes calculations involving the [[strong nuclear force]] extremely difficult.

===Variation with energy scale===
According to the theory of the [[renormalization group]], the value of the fine-structure constant (the strength of the electromagnetic interaction) grows [[logarithm]]ically as the [[energy scale]] is increased. The observed value of {{math|''α''}} is associated with the energy scale of the [[electron mass]]; the electron is a lower bound for this energy scale because it (and the [[positron]]) is the lightest charged object whose [[quantum loop]]s can contribute to the running. Therefore, {{sfrac|1|137.036}} is the value of the fine-structure constant at zero energy. Moreover, as the energy scale increases, the strength of the electromagnetic interaction approaches that of the other two [[fundamental interaction]]s, a fact important for [[grand unification]] theories. If quantum electrodynamics were an exact theory, the fine-structure constant would actually diverge at an energy known as the [[Landau pole]]. This fact makes quantum electrodynamics inconsistent beyond the [[perturbative]] expansions.

==History==
[[File:Sommerfeld-Muenchen.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Sommerfeld memorial at [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|University of Munich]] ]]
Based on the precise measurement of the hydrogen atom spectrum by [[Albert A. Michelson|Michelson]] and [[Edward W. Morley|Morley]],&lt;ref&gt;AA. Michelson and E. W. Morley, Amer. J. Sci.34, 427 (1887); Phil Mag. 24, 463 (1887)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] extended the [[Bohr model]] to include elliptical orbits and relativistic dependence of mass on velocity. He introduced a term for the fine-structure constant in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Sommerfeld, Arnold (1919). "Atombau und Spektrallinien". Braunschweig: Friedrich Vieweg und Sohn. {{ISBN|3-87144-484-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The first physical interpretation of the fine-structure constant {{math|''α''}} was as the ratio of the velocity of the electron in the first circular orbit of the relativistic [[Bohr atom]] to the [[speed of light]] in the vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equivalently, it was the quotient between the minimum [[angular momentum]] allowed by relativity for a closed orbit, and the minimum angular momentum allowed for it by quantum mechanics. It appears naturally in Sommerfeld's analysis, and determines the size of the splitting or [[fine structure|fine-structure]] of the hydrogenic [[Lyman series|spectral lines]].

With the development of [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED) the significance of α has broadened from a spectroscopic phenomenon to a general coupling constant for the electromagnetic field, determining the strength of the interaction between electrons and photons. The term {{math|{{sfrac|''α''|2π}}}} is engraved on the tombstone of one of the pioneers of QED, [[Julian Schwinger]], referring to his calculation of the [[anomalous magnetic dipole moment]].

==Is the fine-structure constant actually constant?==
{{Further|Time-variation of physical constants}}
Physicists have pondered whether the fine-structure constant is in fact constant, or whether its value differs by location and over time. A varying {{math|''α''}} has been proposed as a way of solving problems in [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] and [[astrophysics]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[String theory]] and other proposals for going beyond the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics have led to theoretical interest in whether the accepted [[physical constant]]s (not just {{math|''α''}}) actually vary.

In the experiments below, {{math|Δ''α''}} represents the change in {{math|''α''}} over time, which can be computed by {{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;prev&lt;/sub&gt; − ''α''&lt;sub&gt;now&lt;/sub&gt;}}. If the fine-structure constant really is a constant, then any experiment should show that
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta \alpha}{\alpha} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \frac{\alpha _\mathrm{prev}-\alpha _\mathrm{now}}{\alpha_\mathrm{now}}=0,&lt;/math&gt;
or as close to zero as experiment can measure. Any value far away from zero would indicate that {{math|''α''}} does change over time. So far, most experimental data is consistent with {{math|''α''}} being constant.

===Past rate of change===
The first experimenters to test whether the fine-structure constant might actually vary examined the [[spectral line]]s of distant astronomical objects and the products of [[radioactive decay]] in the [[Oklo]] [[natural nuclear fission reactor]]. Their findings were consistent with no variation in the fine-structure constant between these two vastly separated locations and times.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the [[Keck telescopes]] and a data set of 128 [[quasars]] at [[redshift]]s {{math|0.5 &lt; ''z'' &lt; 3}}, Webb ''et al.'' found that their spectra were consistent with a slight increase in {{math|''α''}} over the last 10–12&amp;nbsp;billion years. Specifically, they found that
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta \alpha}{\alpha} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \frac{\alpha _\mathrm{prev}-\alpha _\mathrm{now}}{\alpha_\mathrm{now}}=\left(-5.7\pm 1.0 \right) \times 10^{-6}.&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, they measured the value to be somewhere between {{val|−0.0000047}} and {{val|−0.0000067}}. This is a very small value, nearly zero, but their error bars do not actually include zero. This result either indicates that ''α'' is not constant or that there is experimental error that the experimenters did not know how to measure.

In 2004, a smaller study of 23 absorption systems by Chand ''et al.'', using the [[Very Large Telescope]], found no measurable variation:&lt;ref&gt;

King ''et al.'' have used [[Markov Chain Monte Carlo]] methods to investigate the algorithm used by the UNSW group to determine {{math|{{sfrac|Δ''α''|''α''}}}} from the quasar spectra, and have found that the algorithm appears to produce correct uncertainties and maximum likelihood estimates for {{math|{{sfrac|Δ''α''|''α''}}}} for particular models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv

In principle, this technique provides enough information to measure a variation of 1 part in {{val|e=9}} (4 orders of magnitude better than the current quasar constraints). However, the constraint which can be placed on {{math|''α''}} is strongly dependent upon effective integration time, going as {{math|''t''&lt;sup&gt;−{{1/2}}&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The European [[LOFAR]] [[radio telescope]] would only be able to constrain {{math|{{sfrac|Δ''α''|''α''}}}} to about 0.3%.&lt;ref name=Khatri/&gt; The collecting area required to constrain Δ''α''/''α'' to the current level of quasar constraints is on the order of 100&amp;nbsp;square kilometers, which is economically impracticable at the present time.

===Spatial variation – Australian dipole===
In September 2010 researchers from Australia said they had identified a dipole-like structure in the variation of the fine-structure constant across the observable universe. They used data on [[quasar]]s obtained by the [[Very Large Telescope]], combined with the previous data obtained by Webb at the [[Keck telescopes]]. The fine-structure constant appears to have been larger by one part in 100,000 in the direction of the southern hemisphere constellation [[Ara (constellation)|Ara]], 10&amp;nbsp;billion years ago.

In September and October 2010, after Webb's released research, physicists [[Chad Orzel]] and [[Sean M. Carroll]] suggested various approaches of how Webb's observations may be wrong. Orzel argues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why I'm Skeptical About the Changing Fine-Structure Constant |url=http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2010/09/14/httpksjtrackermitedu20100907e/ |first=Chad |last=Orzel |authorlink=Chad Orzel |date=14 October 2010 |publisher=ScienceBlogs}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the study may contain wrong data due to subtle differences in the two telescopes, in which one of the telescopes the data set was slightly high and on the other slightly low, so that they cancel each other out when they overlapped. He finds it suspicious that the sources showing the greatest changes are all observed by one telescope, with the region observed by both telescopes aligning so well with the sources where no effect is observed. Carroll suggested&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Fine Structure Constant is Probably Constant |url=http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2010/10/18/the-fine-structure-constant-is-probably-constant/ |first=Sean M. |last=Carroll |authorlink=Sean M. Carroll |date=18 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a totally different approach; he looks at the fine-structure constant as a scalar field and claims that if the telescopes are correct and the fine-structure constant varies smoothly over the universe, then the scalar field must have a very small mass. However, previous research has shown that the mass is not likely to be extremely small. Both of these scientists' early criticisms point to the fact that different techniques are needed to confirm or contradict the results, as Webb, et al., also concluded in their study.

In October 2011, Webb ''et al.'' reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Anthropic explanation==
The [[anthropic principle]] is a controversial argument of why the fine-structure constant has the value it does: stable matter, and therefore life and intelligent beings, could not exist if its value were much different. For instance, were {{math|''α''}} to change by 4%, stellar [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] would not produce [[carbon]], so that carbon-based life would be impossible. If {{math|''α''}} were greater than 0.1, stellar fusion would be impossible and no place in the universe would be warm enough for life as we know it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Numerological explanations and multiverse theory==
As a dimensionless constant which does not seem to be directly related to any [[mathematical constant]], the fine-structure constant has long fascinated physicists.

[[Arthur Eddington]] argued that the value could be "obtained by pure deduction" and he related it to the [[Eddington number]], his estimate of the number of protons in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led him in 1929 to conjecture that the reciprocal of the fine-structure constant was not [[almost integer|approximately the integer]] 137, but precisely the [[integer]] [[137 (number)|137]]. Other physicists neither adopted this conjecture nor accepted his arguments but by the 1940s experimental values for {{math|{{sfrac|1|''α''}}}} deviated sufficiently from 137 to refute Eddington's argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fine-structure constant so intrigued physicist [[Wolfgang Pauli]] that he collaborated with psychoanalyst [[Carl Jung]] in a quest to understand its significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Max Born]] believed that would the value of alpha differ, the universe would degenerate. Thus, he asserted that {{sfrac|1|137}} is a law of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|author = A.I. Miller
|year = 2009
|title = Deciphering the Cosmic Number: The Strange Friendship of Wolfgang Pauli and Carl Jung
|page= 253
|publisher = [[W.W. Norton &amp; Co.|W.W. Norton &amp; Co]]
|isbn = 978-0-393-06532-9
|quote = '''Max Born''': If alpha were bigger than it really is, we should not be able to distinguish matter from ether [the vacuum, nothingness], and our task to disentangle the natural laws would be hopelessly difficult. The fact however that alpha has just its value 1/137 is certainly no chance but itself a law of nature. It is clear that the explanation of this number must be the central problem of natural philosophy.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Feynman]], one of the originators and early developers of the theory of [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED), referred to the fine-structure constant in these terms:

{{quote|There is a most profound and beautiful question associated with the observed coupling constant, {{math|''e''}} – the amplitude for a real electron to emit or absorb a real photon. It is a simple number that has been experimentally determined to be close to 0.08542455. (My physicist friends won't recognize this number, because they like to remember it as the inverse of its square: about 137.03597 with about an uncertainty of about 2 in the last decimal place. It has been a mystery ever since it was discovered more than fifty years ago, and all good theoretical physicists put this number up on their wall and worry about it.) Immediately you would like to know where this number for a coupling comes from: is it related to pi or perhaps to the base of natural logarithms? Nobody knows. It's one of the greatest damn mysteries of physics: a magic number that comes to us with no understanding by man. You might say the "hand of God" wrote that number, and "we don't know how He pushed his pencil." We know what kind of a dance to do experimentally to measure this number very accurately, but we don't know what kind of dance to do on the computer to make this number come out, without putting it in secretly!|[[Richard Feynman]]|{{cite book

Conversely, statistician [[I. J. Good]] argued that a numerological explanation would only be acceptable if it came from a more fundamental theory that also provided a Platonic explanation of the value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]
|page=141
|isbn=978-0-19-853215-6
|quote = '''[[I. J. Good]]''': There have been a few examples of numerology that have led to theories that transformed society: see the mention of Kirchhoff and Balmer in Good (1962, p. 316) … and one can well include Kepler on account of his third law. It would be fair enough to say that numerology was the origin of the theories of electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, gravitation.... So I intend no disparagement when I describe a formula as numerological. When a numerological formula is proposed, then we may ask whether it is correct. … I think an appropriate definition of correctness is that the formula has a good explanation, in a Platonic sense, that is, the explanation could be based on a good theory that is not yet known but ‘exists’ in the universe of possible reasonable ideas.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Attempts to find a mathematical basis for this dimensionless constant have continued up to the present time. However, no numerological explanation has ever been accepted by the community.

In the early 21st century, multiple physicists, including [[Stephen Hawking]] in his book ''[[A Brief History of Time]]'', began exploring the idea of a [[multiverse]], and the fine-structure constant was one of several universal constants that suggested the idea of a [[fine-tuned universe]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Stephen Hawking]] |year=1988 |title=A Brief History of Time |publisher=Bantam Books |isbn=978-0-553-05340-1 |pages=7, 125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Whale''' (25 November 1849 – 4 May 1925) was an English [[solicitor]] and [[Freethought|freethinker]].

==Biography==

Whale worked as a solicitor in [[Huntingdon]] and [[Woolwich]]. He was the Mayor of Woolwich (1908–1909) and was a Liberal parliamentary candidate for [[Marylebone]]. He was a fellow of the [[Royal Historical Society]] and member of the [[Folklore Society]], Johnson Club, Omar Khayyam Club, [[National Liberal Club]] and [[Samuel Pepys Club]].&lt;ref name= "Gissing 1995"&gt;Gissing, George; Mattheisen, Paul F; Young, Arthur C.

The '''Global Organization of Parliamentarians Against Corruption''' ('''GOPAC'''; [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: المنظمة العالمية للبرلمانيين ضد الفساد; [[French language|French]]: ''Organisation mondiale des parlementaires contre la corruption''; [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: "Organización Mundialde Parlamentarios Contra la Corrupción") is an [[International nongovernmental organization]] made up of parliamentarians from across the world, working together to combat corruption, strengthen good government, and uphold the rule of law. Based in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], GOPAC has fifty-two national chapters in five continental associations. GOPAC supports its members through original research, global [[anti‑corruption]] capacity building, and international peer support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GOPAC Network|url=http://www.gopacnetwork.org/|publisher=Global Organization of Parliamentarians Against Corruption|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GOPAC seeks to achieve ethical and accountable governance throughout the world, through effective anti-corruption mechanisms and co-operation between parliamentarians, government leaders, and civil society.

==History==
GOPAC was founded in October 2002 as a result of a Global Conference in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada which brought together approximately 170 parliamentarians and 400 observers who were part of the international leadership in the fight against political corruption and for good governance.

As it has grown, GOPAC has formed a web of partnerships with other international institutions, including the [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]], the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]], the [[World Bank]], and [[Transparency International]].

==Organization==
GOPAC works internationally, and is present on every populated continent of the world.  It operates in four official languages: [[Arabic language|Arabic]]; [[English language|English]]; [[French language|French]]; and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

===Membership===
Individual membership in GOPAC is open to current and former democratically-elected legislators.

There are also National Chapters in fifty-two countries, grouped into six continental regions: Africa; Latin America; North America; Oceania; South Asia; and Southeast Asia.

Individual legislators may be members of GOPAC even if there is no national chapter in their countries.  Similarly, national chapters can be members of GOPAC even if their continent has not formed a continental association.

===Global Task Forces===
GOPAC has five thematic Global Task Forces (GTFs): Anti-Money Laundering; Parliamentary Ethics and Conduct; Parliamentary Oversight; Participation of Society, and the United Nations Convention Against Corruption; and its Women in Parliament Network.

===Global Conference===
Every two years, GOPAC convenes a Global Conference to act as an international focus for parliamentarians from across the world to set the international agenda, and to collaborate in fighting political corruption. The 2013 Global Conference was held in Manila, Philippines.

The '''Habitats Directive''' (more formally known as '''Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the Conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora''') is a [[European Union directive]] adopted in 1992 as an EU response to the [[Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats|Berne Convention]]. It is one of the EU's two directives in relation to wildlife and nature conservation, the other being the [[Birds Directive]].&lt;ref name="EUwebsite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature |title=EUROPA – Environnement – Nature and Biodiversity – Homepage |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JNCC-EUlaw&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-1372 |title=Joint Nature Conservation Committee – European Legislation |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of European nature's policies that establishes one organised network—[[Natura 2000]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Natura 2000]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=January 2018}} which intends to protect nature and wildlife. The Habitats Directive requires national governments to specify areas that are expected to be ensuring the conservation of flora and fauna species.

The '''Habitats Directive''' assures the conservation of endangered native animal and plant divisions. It aims to protect 220 habitats and approximately 1,000 species listed in the directive's Annexes. These are species and habitats which are considered to be of European interest, following criteria given in the directive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/mission_statement/index_en.htm EUROPA – Environnement – Nature and Biodiversity – Mission Statement] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019093120/http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/mission_statement/index_en.htm |date=19 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JNCC-Habitat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-1374 |title=Joint Nature Conservation Committee – EC Habitats Directive |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |date=30 October 1994 |accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It directs Member States of the EU to take measures to maintain the "favourable conservation status" of protected habitats and species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Epstein|first=Yaffa|date=7 May 2016|title=Favourable Conservation Status for Species: Examining the Habitats Directive’s Key Concept through a Case Study of the Swedish Wolf|url=http://jel.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/05/06/jel.eqw006|journal=Journal of Environmental Law|pages=eqw006|doi=10.1093/jel/eqw006|issn=0952-8873}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Annex I covers habitats, 
* Annex II species requiring designation of [[Special Areas of Conservation]], 
* Annex IV species in need of strict protection, and 
* Annex V species whose taking from the wild can be restricted by European law.
The directive led to the setting up of a network of Special Areas of Conservation, which together with the existing [[Special Protection Area]]s form a network of protected sites across the [[European Union]] called [[Natura 2000]].&lt;ref name="EUwebsite"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JNCC-EUlaw"/&gt; Article 17 of the directive requires EU Member States to report on the state of their protected areas every six years. The first complete set of country data was reported in 2007.

==History==

From 1988 to 1992, the policy was given importance at the national level by policy experts, scientists and ecologists and later on spawned political, social and administrative discussions within the states that are engaged in the policy in the 1990s.

In 1998, the protection of the habitat of the [[European hamster]]&lt;ref&gt;[[European hamster]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=January 2018}} —''Korenwolf'', received a lot of attention from the public and the media during discussions projected by the ''Non-governmental Organization'' responsible for the matter. The extinction of the species symbolised the failed conservation of wild flora and fauna and other species of plants and animals and the deficiency of the pursuit for nature policies in the Netherlands.

==Implications==
Due to differences in nature conservation traditions, national problems have arisen in the implementation of the directive. Since member states in the South and East of Europe participated less in nature policies, these states experienced misfits in promoting the new EU-originating provisions. In Germany, Austria, Italy and Belgium, the observation of conflicts between various government layers have caused prolonged delays in the management of nature policies. On the other hand, in member states such as United Kingdom and Sweden, positive outcomes have developed due to stakeholder involvement, pro-active authorities, agencies responsible for implementation and public participation.

Not only does the '''Habitats Directive''' promote nature and wildlife conservation but it also develops a disquisition between ''"economy" and "ecology"'' (Van der Zouwen and Van den Top 2002). Several discussions have been made regarding the directive and its flaws by the Dutch politics and administration— these discussions are still going on until today. The disadvantages of the policy have been believed to raise awareness on Europe's implementation of policies. Representatives of provinces and municipalities have been putting efforts in implementing nature policies within their area and scope. The '''Habitats Directive''' and [[Birds Directive]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Birds Directive]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=January 2018}}were considered as the first legitimate effort in pursuing [[Europeanization]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Europeanisation]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=January 2018}}

"homogeneous." 
Encyclopedia of Mathematics.

Science Online. Facts On File, Inc. 
"A polynomial in several variables p(x,y,z,…) is called homogeneous [...] more generally, a function of several variables f(x,y,z,…) is homogeneous [...] Identifying homogeneous functions can be helpful in solving differential equations [and] any formula that represents the mean of a set of numbers is required to be homogeneous. In physics, the term homogeneous describes a substance or an object whose properties do not vary with position. For example, an object of uniform density is sometimes described as homogeneous."  
[http://www.fofweb.com/activelink2.asp?ItemID=WE40&amp;SID=5&amp;iPin=EMATH0406&amp;SingleRecord=True James. homogeneous (math).] 
(accessed: 2009-11-16)&lt;/ref&gt; A uniform [[electric field]] (which has the same strength and the same direction at each point) would be compatible with homogeneity (all points experience the same physics). A material constructed with different constituents can be described as effectively homogeneous in the [[electromagnetic field|electromagnetic]] materials domain, when interacting with a directed [[EM radiation|radiation field]] (light, microwave frequencies, etc.).&lt;ref name=homogeneity&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/homogeneity Homogeneity]. Merriam-webster.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Homogeneous&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Homogeneous Homogeneous]. Merriam-webster.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematically, homogeneity has the connotation of [[invariant (physics)|invariance]], as all components of the [[equation]] have the same degree of value whether or not each of these components are scaled to different values, for example, by multiplication or addition. Cumulative distribution fits this description. "The state of having identical cumulative distribution function or values".&lt;ref name=homogeneity/&gt;&lt;ref name=Homogeneous/&gt;

==Context==
The definition of homogeneous strongly depends on the context used. For example, a [[composite material]] is made up of different individual materials, known as "''constituents''" of the material, but may be defined as a homogeneous material when assigned a function. For example, [[asphalt]] paves our roads, but is a composite material consisting of asphalt binder and mineral aggregate, and then laid down in layers and compacted. However, homogeneity of materials does not necessarily mean [[Isotropic solid|isotropy]]. In the previous example, a composite material may not be isotropic.

In another context, a material is not homogeneous in so far as it is composed of [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s.  However, at the normal level of our everyday world, a pane of glass, or a sheet of metal is described as glass, or stainless steel. In other words, these are each described as a homogeneous material.

A few other instances of context are: ''Dimensional homogeneity'' (see below) is the quality of an equation having quantities of same units on both sides; ''Homogeneity (in space)'' implies [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation of momentum]]; and ''homogeneity in time'' implies [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation of energy]].

===Homogeneous alloy===
In the context of composite metals is an alloy. A blend of a metal with one or more metallic or nonmetallic materials is an alloy. The components of an alloy do not combine chemically but, rather, are very finely mixed. An alloy might be homogeneous or might contain small particles of components that can be viewed with a microscope. Brass is an example of an alloy, being a homogeneous mixture of copper and zinc. Another example is steel, which is an alloy of iron with carbon and possibly other metals. The purpose of alloying is to produce desired properties in a metal that naturally lacks them. Brass, for example, is harder than copper and has a more gold-like color. Steel is harder than iron and can even be made rust proof (stainless steel).&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Joe. "Alloy." Encyclopedia of Physics. New York: Facts On File, Inc., 2004. Science Online. Facts On File, Inc. accessed 2009-11-16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homogeneous cosmology===
Homogeneity, in another context plays a role in [[cosmology]]. From the perspective of 19th-century cosmology (and before), the [[universe]] was [[Infinity|infinite]], unchanging, homogeneous, and therefore filled with [[star]]s. However, German astronomer [[Heinrich Olbers]] asserted that if this were true, then the entire night sky would be filled with light and bright as day; this is known as [[Olbers' paradox]]. Olbers presented a technical paper in 1826 that attempted to answer this conundrum. The faulty premise, unknown in Olbers' time, was that the universe is not infinite, static, and homogeneous. The [[Big Bang]] cosmology replaced this model (expanding, finite, and [[Inhomogeneous cosmology|inhomogeneous universe]]). However, modern astronomers supply reasonable explanations to answer this question. One of at least several explanations is that distant stars and [[galaxies]] are [[red shift]]ed, which weakens their apparent light and makes the night sky dark.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, Deborah, and Joseph A. Angelo Jr. "''Olbers, Heinrich Wilhelm Matthäus''." A to Z of Scientists in Space and Astronomy. New York: Facts on File, Inc., 2005. Science Online. Facts On File, Inc. [http://www.fofweb.com/activelink2.asp?ItemID=WE40&amp;SID=5&amp;iPin=AZSSA0100&amp;SingleRecord=True Olbers, Heinrich Wilhelm Matthäus] (accessed 2009-11-16)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the weakening is not sufficient to actually explain Olbers' paradox. Many cosmologists think that the fact that the Universe is finite in time, that is that the Universe has not been around forever, is the solution to the paradox.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The fact that the night sky is dark is thus an indication for the Big Bang.

==Translation invariance==
{{main|translational invariance}}

By [[translation (geometry)|translation]] invariance, one means independence of (absolute) position, especially when referring to a law of physics, or to the evolution of a physical system.

Fundamental laws of physics should not (explicitly) depend on position in space. That would make them quite useless. In some sense, this is also linked to the requirement that experiments should be [[reproducible]].
This principle is true for all laws of mechanics ([[Newton's laws]], etc.), electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, etc.

In practice, this principle is usually violated, since one studies only a small subsystem of the universe, which of course "feels" the influence of rest of the universe. This situation gives rise to "external fields" (electric, magnetic, gravitational, etc.) which make the description of the evolution of the system depending on the position ([[potential well]]s, etc.). This only stems from the fact that the objects creating these external fields are not considered as (a "dynamical") part of the system.

Translational invariance as described above is equivalent to [[translational invariance|shift invariance]] in [[system analysis]], although here it is most commonly used in [[linear]] systems, whereas in physics the distinction is not usually made.

The notion of [[isotropy]], for properties independent of direction, is not a consequence of homogeneity. For example, a uniform electric field (i.e., which has the same strength and the same direction at each point) would be compatible with homogeneity (at each point physics will be the same), but not with [[isotropy]], since the field singles out one "preferred" direction.

===Consequences===

In [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] formalism, homogeneity in space implies conservation of [[momentum]], and homogeneity in time implies conservation of [[energy]]. This is shown, using [[variational calculus]], in standard textbooks like the classical reference [Landau &amp; Lifshitz] cited below. This is a particular application of [[Noether's theorem]].

==Dimensional homogeneity==
{{main|Dimensional analysis#Dimensional homogeneity}}

As said in the introduction, ''dimensional homogeneity'' is the quality of an equation having quantities of same units on both sides. A valid equation in [[physics]] must be homogeneous, since equality cannot apply between quantities of different nature. This can be used to spot errors in formula or calculations. For example, if one is calculating a [[speed]], units must always combine to [length]/[time]; if one is calculating an [[energy]], units must always combine to [mass]•[length]²/[time]², etc. For example, the following formulae could be valid expressions for some energy:
:&lt;math&gt;E_k = \frac 12 m v^2 ;~~ E = m c^2 ;~~ E = p v ; ~~ E = hc/\lambda&lt;/math&gt;
if ''m'' is a mass, ''v'' and ''c'' are velocities, ''p'' is a [[momentum]], ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]], ''λ'' a length. On the other hand, if the units of the [[right hand side]] do not combine to [mass]•[length]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/[time]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, it cannot be a valid expression for some energy.

Being homogeneous does not necessarily mean the equation will be true, since it does not take into account numerical factors. For example, ''E = m•v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' could be or could not be the correct formula for the energy of a particle of mass ''m'' traveling at speed ''v'', and one cannot know if ''h•c''/λ should be divided or multiplied by 2π.

Nevertheless, this is a very powerful tool in finding characteristic units of a given problem, see [[dimensional analysis]].

[[Theoretical physicist]]s tend to express everything in [[natural units]] given by [[constants of nature]], for example by taking ''c'' = ''ħ'' = ''k'' = 1; once this is done, one partly loses the possibility of the above checking.

Board of Education, 05311955.gif|thumb|right|220px|The first page of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] judgement in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', the "mother of all impact litigation".{{sfn | Schuck | 2006 | p=104}}]]
'''Impact litigation''' or '''strategic litigation''' is the practice of bringing [[lawsuit]]s intended to effect societal change.{{sfn | Schuck | 2006 | p=103}}{{sfn | Okafor | 2006 | p=81}} Impact litigation cases may be [[class action]] lawsuits or individual claims with broader significance,{{sfn | Schuck | 2006 | p=104}} and may rely on [[statutory law]] arguments or on [[constitution]]al claims.{{sfn | Tushnet | 2008 | p=383}} Such litigation has been widely and successfully used to influence public policy, especially by [[Left-wing politics|left-leaning]] groups, and often attracts significant media attention.{{sfn | Schuck | 2006 | p=103}}

==History==
In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (at times though its [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund|Legal Defense Fund]]) both pursued legal action to advance and protect civil rights in the [[United States of America|United States]]. The ACLU followed a primarily "defensive" strategy, fighting individual violations of rights when they were identified. The NAACP, in contrast, developed a more coordinated plan to actively file suits to challenge discrimination, known as "affirmative" or "strategic" litigation.{{sfn |Tushnet |2008 |p=380}} The NAACP's model became the pattern for "impact litigation" strategies, which applied similar tactics in contexts other than racial discrimination.{{sfn|Tushnet |2008 |p=383}}

Important early impact litigation cases included ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' and ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''.{{sfn | Schuck | 2006 | p=104}} ''Brown'', a 1954 U.S. [[school desegregation]] decision, was carefully prepared by [[Thurgood Marshall]] and other NAACP lawyers so that the eventual [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling invalidated official racial discrimination throughout the U.S. government. Many cases since then have closely imitated it, in the course of seeking greater protections for other disadvantaged groups.{{sfn | Schuck | 2006 | p=104}}

==Scope==
Impact litigation has played a major role in the development of American desegregation, [[abortion]],  [[Regulation of tobacco by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration |tobacco regulation]] policy{{sfn | Mason | Leavitt | Chaffee | 2013 | p=547}} and [[gay marriage]].  

Since the 1980s, impact litigation has been used to seek reform in the reform of U.S. [[Child protection|child welfare law]], following earlier work which involved the courts in jail and mental hospital reforms and in school desegregation.{{sfn| Lowry |1986 |p=260}}

Strategic impact litigation has also been used in [[Nigeria]], among other things to push for convictions of perpetrators of [[police brutality]] and to defeat legal attacks on the [[freedom of the press]].{{sfn | Okafor | 2006 | p=81}}

In a few jurisdictions where attorneys are prohibited from bringing class action lawsuits, citizens have filed "grassroots impact litigation" cases and successfully represented their own claims.{{sfn |Freeman |1991 }}

==Debate==
Impact litigation has been criticized by legal scholars and politicians on the bases of judicial legitimacy and competence.

The legitimacy argument holds that, in countries with a constitutional [[separation of powers]], societal changes are to be enacted by democratically elected bodies and are outside the purview of individual judges. The competence argument claims that institutional limitations on the amount and quality of information that can be made available in a court proceeding make the courts poorly prepared to handle complex policy issues. Another version of this argument points out that courts are limited in the scope of their responses, relative to legislative bodies.{{sfn | Schuck | 2006 | pp=107-111}} These debates overlap with those concerning so-called "[[judicial activism]]".{{sfn| Lowry |1986 |p=260}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8006">'''Intellectual opportunism''' is the pursuit of intellectual opportunities with a selfish, ulterior motive not consistent with relevant principles. The term refers to certain self-serving tendencies of the human intellect, often involving professional producers and disseminators of ideas, who work with idea-formation all the time.

Intellectual opportunism sometimes also refers to a specific school or trend of thought, or to a characteristic of a particular intellectual development. Thus, a certain set of people who share ideas are then said to display a tendency for "intellectual opportunism", often with the connotation that they deliberately act intellectually in a certain way, to gain special favor with an authority, group or organization; to justify a state of affairs that benefits themselves; or because they have the motive of financial or personal gain.

==Background==

At issue is the ''motive'' and ''intention'' involved in pursuing, creating, or expressing particular ideas (why certain ideas are being taken up), and the relevant contrast is between: 

* the intellectual's stated principles, versus ideas he publicly or outwardly supports, endorses or concerns himself with.
* the original intention of ideas such as it is normally understood, versus the uses they are put to.

"Theoretical opportunism" in science refers to the attempt to save a theory from refutation, or protect it from criticism, with the use of [[ad hoc]] methods that in some way lack deeper scientific consistency or credibility. Theorists may believe so strongly in the value of their own theory, that they try to explain away inconsistencies or contrary evidence – borrowing any idea that plausibly fits with the theory, rather than developing the theory in such a way, that it can truly account for the relevant evidence.

The phenomenon of intellectual opportunism is frequently associated by its critics with [[careerism]] and dubious, unprincipled self-promotion, where ideas become "just another commodity" or a "bargaining tool". When human knowledge becomes a tradeable good in a market of ideas, all sorts of opportunities arise for huckstering, swindling, haggling and hustling with information in ways which are regarded as unprincipled, dubious or involve deceit of some sort. 

==Morality==
The intellectual opportunist ''adapts'' his intellectual concerns, pursuits and utterances to "fit with the trend/fashion" or "fit the situation" or "with what sells" – with the (ulterior) motive of gaining personal popularity/support, protecting intellectual coherence, obtaining personal credit, acquiring privilege or status, persuading others, ingratiating himself, taking advantage or making money. Normally this assumes some degree of intellectual flexibility, agility or persuasiveness. The intellectual opportunist:

* "Holds his mouth where the money or the support is" or where the opportunities for self-advancement or self-promotion are.
* "Hires out" his own ideas for purposes that conflict with his real nature or the organization he works for, only for the purpose of gaining personal advantage.
* Latches onto any readily available ideas or "picks the brains of others" to advance or defend his own position.
* Compromises what he really believes in, for the sake of some ulterior motive or purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Quilty, "Political realities and intellectual opportunism." ''The Daily Star'' (Beirut), 19 May 2006.[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Politics/May/19/Political-realities-and-intellectual-opportunism.ashx#axzz]&lt;/ref&gt;

Often intellectual opportunism is therefore understood as a sign of lack of [[integrity]] or intellectual shallowness, to the extent that the opportunist is not concerned with the worth of the ideas in themselves, but only with how he can benefit from them himself by pursuing them. As a corollary, the intellectual opportunist is often apt to change his opinions, and "change his line" rapidly or arbitrarily, according to where he can gain personal advantage, in a manner not consistent or principled.  

The implication is usually that ideas are no longer being pursued because of their ''intrinsic merit or worth'', or out of a genuine concern with what is at stake in an argument or idea, but only because of the ''instrumental'' value of ideas, i.e., the selfish advantage that can be gained from pursuing some ideas in preference to other ones. Observably ventilating or "advertising" suitably formulated ideas is then merely a ''means'' or a "tool" for self-advancement or the promotion of a group or organization, giving rise to accusations that the real intention of particular ideas is being twisted around to serve an alien or improper purpose. The general outcome may be that the ideas involved, though plausible at a superficial level, lack any deeper coherence, the coherence being ruled out by lack of regard for relevant principles. Intellectual "dilettantes" (people who do not truly know what they are talking about, i.e. dabblers) are often regarded as opportunists, insofar as they like to side with whatever viewpoint seems to be popular or credible at the time.

==Perception==
Intellectual opportunism may appear obvious or crass, if the selfish motives for engaging in it are clear. It may also be very difficult to detect if: 

*the intellectual opportunist is clever and intelligent, while his audience is not, or his audience lacks sufficient relevant information to "judge the intellectual act". A clever intellectual opportunist may be able to reconcile his changing stories and his ulterior selfish motives in such a way, that his intellectual concerns seem perfectly principled and consistent.
*it is very difficult to distinguish between legitimately seizing an intellectual opportunity with sincere motives, and using an intellectual opportunity for some selfish, ulterior motive.
*the intellectual opportunist is himself ''not aware'' of his own opportunism, i.e. what it means, or what its broader significance is, regarding his own pursuit of intellectual opportunities as perfectly legitimate. In this case, the true motives or the effects of a course of action may be unclear or in dispute.&lt;ref&gt;"...opportunists almost never believe that is what they are. They believe they are making reasonable adjustments to circumstances, and when they do acknowledge that they are doing wrong, we generally note the absence of real guilt in their voices and the worldly smile that tells us they think themselves wrong only by conventional standards, not by the standards of real life." Neal O. Weiner, ''The harmony of the soul: mental health and moral virtue reconsidered.'' Albany: State University of New York Press, 1993, p.85.&lt;/ref&gt;
*the relevant and appropriate moral norms are themselves in dispute, so that the validity of the assessment of "opportunism" in intellectual behaviour depends on "point of view".

To ''prove'' intellectual opportunism by an individual or a group may therefore require very comprehensive knowledge pertaining to the case. An additional complicating factor is the influence of cultural differences on human intentions. Behavior regarded as opportunist in one culture may not be so regarded in another because of differences in norms of moral propriety. For example, in American culture there is a much greater preoccupation with self-marketing, advertising and self-promotion, which in European countries might be regarded as crass opportunism, because the culturally appropriate ways to assert self-interest or self-concern are different. There may however be just as much opportunism in Europe as anywhere else, but with a different cultural style. People may say, "all's fair in love and war", but that also means that if one can ''represent'' something as a war or a matter of love, one can justify any action, since love and war permit actions that would ordinarily be regarded as unprincipled or illegitimate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10166">In psychology, '''intellectualization''' is a [[Defence mechanism|defense mechanism]] by which reasoning is used to block confrontation with an [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] conflict and its associated emotional stress – where thinking is used to avoid feeling.&lt;ref&gt;Glen O. Gabbard, ''Long-Term Psychodynamic Psychotherapy'' (London 2010) p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; It involves removing one's self, emotionally, from a stressful event. Intellectualization may accompany, but is different from, [[rationalization (psychology)|rationalization]], the pseudo-rational justification of irrational acts.&lt;ref&gt;George E. Vaillant, ''Ego mechanisms of defence: a guide for clinicians and researchers'' (1992) p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectualization is one of [[Freud]]'s original defense mechanisms. Freud believed that memories have both conscious and unconscious aspects, and that intellectualization allows for the conscious analysis of an event in a way that does not provoke anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Intellectualization is a transition to reason, where the person avoids uncomfortable emotions by focusing on facts and logic. The situation is treated as an interesting problem that engages the person on a rational basis, whilst the emotional aspects are completely ignored as being irrelevant. 

While Freud did not himself use the term "intellectualization",&lt;ref&gt;Edward Erwin, ''The Freud encyclopedia'' (2002) p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; in  ''On Negation'' he described clinical instances in which "the intellectual function is separated from the affective process....The outcome of this is a kind of intellectual acceptance of the repressed, while at the same time what is essential to the repression persists".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (Penguin 1987) p. 438&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere he described an (unsuccessful) analysis with "the patient participating actively with her intellect, though absolutely tranquil emotionally...completely indifferent",&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Studies II'' (London 1991) p. 390&lt;/ref&gt; while he also noted how in the obsessional the thinking processes themselves becomes sexually charged.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Studies'' p. 124 and note&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anna Freud]] devoted a chapter of her book ''The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense'' [1937] to "Intellectualization at Puberty", seeing the growing intellectual and philosophical approach of that period as relatively normal attempts to master adolescent drives.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;  She considered that only "if the process of intellectualization overruns the whole field of mental life" should it be considered pathological.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Freud, ''The ego and the mechanism of defense'' (London 1993) p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jargon]] is often used as a device of intellectualization. By using complex terminology, the focus becomes on the words and finer definitions rather than the human effects.

Intellectualization protects against anxiety by repressing the emotions connected with an event. A comparison sometimes made is that between ''isolation'' (also known as '[[Isolation (psychology)|isolation of affect]]') and ''intellectualization''.  The former is a dissociative response that allows one to dispassionately experience an unpleasant thought or event. The latter is a cognitive style that seeks to conceptualize an unpleasant thought or event in an intellectually comprehensible manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uic.edu/orgs/convening/coping.htm The caller's coping styles] retrieved December 14, 2011 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327023424/http://www.uic.edu/orgs/convening/coping.htm |date=March 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [DSM-IV-TR, page 808, thus mentions them as separate entities]. It allows one to rationally deal with a situation, but may cause [[Thought suppression|suppression]] of feelings that need to be acknowledged to move on.

==In the defense hierarchy==

[[George Eman Vaillant|Vaillant]] divided defense mechanisms into a hierarchy of defenses ranging from immature through neurotic to healthy defenses,&lt;ref&gt;Skinner/Cleese, ''Life'' p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;  and placed intellectualization – imagining an act of violence without feeling the accompanying emotions, for example – in the mid-range, neurotic defenses.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner/Cleese, ''Life'' p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Like rationalisation, intellectualisation can thus provide a bridge between immature and mature mechanisms both in the process of growing up and in adult life.&lt;ref&gt;A. Bateman and J. Holmes, ''Introduction to Psychoanalysis'' (London 1999) p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Winnicott]], however, considered that erratic childhood care could lead to over-dependence on intellectuality as a substitute for mothering;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Kissing, Tickling and Being Bored'' (London 1994) p. 43-4&lt;/ref&gt; and saw over-preoccupation with knowledge as an emotional impoverishment aimed at self-mothering via the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalind Minsky, ''Psychoanalysis and Gender'' (London 1996) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julia Kristeva]] similarly described a process whereby "symbolicity itself is cathected...Since it is not sex-oriented, it denies the question of sexual difference".&lt;ref&gt;Julia Kristeva, ''Powers of Horror'' (New York 1982) p. 44-5&lt;/ref&gt; 

One answer to such over-intellectualization may be the sense of humour, what [[Richard Hofstadter]] called the necessary quality of playfulness&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Peter Gay, ''Reading Freud'' (London 1990) p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; – Freud himself saying that "Humour can be regarded as the highest of these defensive processes"!&lt;ref&gt;Skinner/Cleese, ''Life'' p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

==During therapy==

Among the intellectual defenses against analysis are a refusal to accept the logic of emotions, attempts to refute the theory of psychoanalysis,&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, ''Neurosis'' p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; or speculating about one's own problems rather than experiencing them and attempting to change.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay ed., ''The Freud Reader'' (London 1995) p. 362-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Such intellectualizations of therapy may form part of wider manic defenses against emotional reality.&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Segal, ''Introduction to the Work of Melanie Klein'' (London 1964) p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; A further difficulty may be that of assimilating new and unfamiliar feelings once the defense of intellectualization begins to crack open.&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, ''Neurosis'' p. 477&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively the therapist may unwittingly deflect the patient away from feeling to mere talking of feelings, producing not emotional but merely intellectual insight&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''On Learning from the Patient' (London 1990) p. 178-9&lt;/ref&gt;  an obsessional attempt to control through thinking the lost feelings parts of the self.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Rycroft, ''A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'' (Penguin 1977) p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Jung]] put it, "the intellectual still suffers from a neurosis if feeling is undeveloped".&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Memories, Dreams, Reflections'' (London 1995) p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychoanalytic controversy==

Freud's theory of psychoanalysis may be a formidable intellectual construct, but it has certainly been criticised for revealing intellectual [[grandiosity]].&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter, ''A Social History of Madness'' (London 1999) p.222&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Lacan]] however would defend it on the very ground of its intellectuality, arguing that you could "recognize bad psychoanalysts...by the word they use to deprecate all technical or theoretical research...''intellectualization''".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (London 1996) p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;  Lacan himself was of course exposed to exactly the same criticism: "My own conception of the dynamics of the unconscious has been called an intellectualization – on the grounds that I based the function of the signifier in the forefront".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (London 1994) p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud himself accepted that he had a vast desire for knowledge;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gay, ''Reading'' p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; and knew well how theorising can become a compulsive activity.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''The Uncanny'' (Penguin 2003) p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;  He might not have disagreed too strongly with [[Didier Anzieu]]'s assessment of the extent to which "his elaboration of psychoanalytic theory...corresponded to a setting up of obsessional defenses against depressive anxiety" – of Freud's need "to defend himself against [anxiety] through such a degree of intellectualisation".&lt;ref&gt;Didier Anzieu, ''Freud's Self-Analysis'' (London 1986) p. 581 and p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further examples==
Suppose John has been brought up by a strict father, feels hurt, and is angry as a result. Although John may have deep feelings of hatred towards his father, when he talks about his childhood, John may say: "Yes, my father was a rather firm person, I suppose I do feel some [[antipathy]] towards him even now".&lt;ref&gt;[http://changingminds.org/explanations/behaviors/coping/intellectualization.htm Changing Minds explanations for coping behaviours] retrieved February 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; John intellectualizes; he chooses rational and emotionally cool words to describe experiences which are usually emotional and very painful.

A woman in therapy continues to theorise her experience to her therapist – 'It seems to me that being psycho-analysed is essentially a process where one is forced back into infantilism...intellectual primitivism' – despite knowing that she 'would get no answer to it, or at least, not on the level I wanted, since I knew that what I was saying was the "intellectualising" to which she attributed my emotional troubles'.&lt;ref&gt;Doris Lessing, ''The Golden Notebook'' (Herts 1973) p. 455&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who is heavily in debt builds a complex spreadsheet of how long it would take to repay using different payment options and interest rates, rather than attempting to understand and then stop his urge to overspend his money.

The '''Interlock System''' is [[R. Talsorian Games]]' proprietary role-playing system.

==History==
Interlock was a game system by [[R. Talsorian Games]] based on a simple ‘die + bonus’ system, using a d10.&lt;ref name="designers"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers &amp; Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|208}} ''[[Mekton II]]'' (1987) – the 3rd edition of R. Talsorian's mecha game – revealed for the first time the full-fledged Interlock system. Interlock featured point-based characters with a character background system that had appeared in ''[[Mekton]]'', though in a more complex and comprehensive form called Lifepaths.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|208}} ''[[Cyberpunk 2013]]'' (1988) was R. Talsorian's second Interlock design.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|208}} ''Cyberpunk'' expanded the original Interlock system by introducing a new combat system called "Friday Night Firefight". The second edition of the game, ''[[Cyberpunk 2020]]'' (1990), polished up the Interlock system once more, producing what is now known as "Standard Interlock".&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|209}}

Interlock is one of the direct parents of the [[Fuzion]] system (the other is the [[Hero System]]).  The Interlock System is "skill-based"&amp;mdash;characters are created by choosing skills for them, and by advancing those skills individually, rather than by choosing [[character class]] packages.  The Interlock System is used primarily in the ''[[Cyberpunk 2020]]'' and ''[[Mekton]]'' role-playing games. A variant of the Interlock System is used in ''[[Teenagers from Outer Space (role-playing game)|Teenagers from Outer Space]]'' and the Japanese ''[[Gundam Senki]]'' RPG.

==System==
[[Ability score|Stats]] and skills are both rated on a scale of 0-10 with 0 representing no ability/no training and 10 representing the maximum ability possible for a human being.  A typical skill roll will range from 12-20 for most tasks, so a skill 10 + stat 10 will succeed at virtually any task barring a critical mishap, while a skill 0 + stat 2 (minimum statistic level for a human character) will fail at any but the very simplest task, and even then will succeed only on a critical success.  Interlock builds on the typical skill-based paradigm by offering "template" (Mekton) or "profession" (Cyberpunk) packages that give specialized abilities to characters that take these packages.

There are nine Attributes: Intelligence (INT), Reflexes (REF), Cool (COOL), Technical Ability (TECH), Luck (LUCK), Attractiveness (ATT), Movement (MOVE), Empathy (EMP), and Body (BOD). Characters must have a starting Attribute stat minimum of 2 and a system stat maximum of 10. 

In ''Cyberpunk'' and ''Cybergeneration'' Empathy is very important. It not only controls interpersonal interactions but it also determines how much cyberware you can install. Every piece of cyberware has a Humanity Cost that reduces the character's base Empathy. A rating of "0" or less means the character has become psychotic and can no longer be played.

The Interlock System is best known for its ''Lifepath'' system, a storytelling device used to create character backgrounds without particular direct benefit or drawback to the character, avoiding [[min-maxing]].

The '''Iriomote cat''' (''Prionailurus bengalensis iriomotensis'') is a [[Subspecies (biology)|subspecies]] of the [[leopard cat]] that lives exclusively on the [[Japan]]ese island of [[Iriomote]]. It has been listed as [[critically endangered]] on the [[IUCN Red List]] since 2008, as the only population comprises fewer than 250 adult individuals and is considered declining.&lt;ref name=iucn&gt;{{IUCN |assessor=Izawa, M. |assessor2=Doi T. |last-assessor-amp=yes|year=2016 |title=Prionailurus bengalensis ssp. iriomotensis |id=18151 |version=2016.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, there were an estimated 100–109 individuals remaining.&lt;ref name=Ministry_environment /&gt;

In [[Japanese language|Japanese]], it is called {{nihongo3|"Iriomote mountain cat"|西表山猫|'''Iriomote-yamaneko'''}}. In local dialects of the [[Yaeyama language]], it is known as {{nihongo3|"the cat in the mountain"|ヤママヤー|'''yamamayaa'''}}, {{nihongo3|"that which shines on the mountain"|ヤマピカリャー|'''yamapikaryaa'''}}, and {{nihongo3|"that which has flashing eyes"|メーピスカリャー|'''meepisukaryaa'''}}.&lt;ref name="Imaizumi1994-Yamapika"&gt;今泉(1994), Pp.8–13, Pp. 144-147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Togawa1972-1&gt;戸川(1972), Pp.13–92&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Iriomote yamaneko stuffed.jpg|thumb|right|A taxidermied Iriomote cat at the Iriomote Wildlife Conservation Center. It has dark gray and brown fur, rounded ears, light amber eyes, and a flattened nose.]]
The fur of the Iriomote cat is mostly dark gray and light brown, with lighter hair on the belly and insides of the limbs. Hair along the jaw is white.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt; There are two dark brown spots on each cheek. There are 5–7 stripes spanning from the forehead to the back of the head, but, unlike the leopard cat, the stripes stop before reaching the shoulders.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1986 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ohara_2000 /&gt; Dark brown spots cover the sides of the body, and there are 3–4 bands of irregular stripes on the chest.&lt;ref name=Ohara_2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1991 /&gt; The tail is dark brown; darker spots pattern the back side of the tail while the underside of the tail is solid. The tip of the tail is dark.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt;

The tips of the ears are rounded, with black hair along the edge. There are no tufts of longer hair on the top of the ears. Adult Iriomote cats have a white spot on the back of each ear, much like those found on [[tiger]]s' ears.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt; Young Iriomote cats do not have these marks, and even as adults the spots will not be as white as those seen on other leopard cat subspecies.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt;

The Iriomote cat's eyes are a light amber color.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt; Its nose is large and flat, with no fur covering the reddish-brown skin.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ohara_2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1991 /&gt; The paw ranges from {{convert|29|-|37|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide, in contrast to the {{convert|24|-|30|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide paw of a [[domestic cat]].&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt;

The skull is longer and more narrow than that of a domestic cat. When compared to the leopard cat's skull, the Iriomote cat's is roughly the same size but thicker. Because of this, the Iriomote cat's brain is smaller; a male leopard cat's brain is about 42 grams, whereas a male Iriomote cat's brain is about 30 grams.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt; The [[occipital bone]] of the skull and the auditory capsule are not connected.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1986 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1991 /&gt; The [[mandibular symphysis]] is short.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1986 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ohara_2000 /&gt;

Male Iriomote cats grow to be {{convert|50|-|60|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and weigh {{convert|3.5|-|5|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Females are smaller at about {{convert|50|-|55|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3|-|3.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Red_2005 /&gt; Their tails are thick from base to tip and {{convert|23|-|24|cm|in|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48&gt;{{cite book |last=今泉 |first=忠明 |script-title=ja:イリオモテヤマネコの百科 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Iriomote Wild Cat Encyclopedia |isbn=4887182856 |publisher=Data House |year=1994 |pages=7–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ohara_2000 /&gt; They have long torsos and short, thick limbs.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt; Their necks are also thick, and their shoulders are muscular, though their jumping power is comparatively weak. Unlike other small cats, their spines cannot bend sharply.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt;

The Iriomote cat has six pairs of [[incisors]], two pairs of [[canine teeth]], four pairs of [[premolars]], and two pairs of [[molars]] for a total of 28 teeth. Compared to other cats, including small wild cats, the Iriomote cat is lacking one pair of premolars on the top jaw behind the canines.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt; In addition to this, unlike most other subtropical mammals, Iriomote cats' teeth give details about their year-to-year history. It is expected that these details will help determine the age and behavior of the cats.&lt;ref name=Tooth_age&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ryukyushimpo.jp/news/storyid-169649-storytopic-5.html |script-title=ja:イリオモテヤマネコ、歯年輪で年齢判別 |author=琉球新報 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Iriomote Cat, Tooth Rings Show Age |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[anal gland|anal scent glands]] of the Iriomote cat surround the [[anus]]; this contrasts with other cat species', where they are inside the anus.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-119-157&gt;{{cite book |last=今泉 |first=忠明 |script-title=ja:イリオモテヤマネコの百科 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Iriomote Wild Cat Encyclopedia |isbn=4887182856 |publisher=Data House |year=1994 |pages=119–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology and behavior==
Iriomote cats are [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]], but climb trees, go into the water and also swim.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1986 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Shizenkan /&gt;&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_2004 /&gt; They are [[nocturnal]] and especially active during [[twilight]] hours.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Center /&gt; During the daytime, they sleep in tree hollows or in caves. They mark their [[territory (animal)|territory]] by [[urinating]] and [[defecating]] on rocks, tree stumps and bushes. Their home ranges vary from {{convert|1|to|7|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} in size.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1986 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ohara_2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Red_2005 /&gt;

===Home range===
Iriomote cats are usually solitary. Their home range varies seasonally and also individually, and is smaller during the mating season. In 1998 and 1999, a male and a female Iriomote cat were [[Radio telemetry|radio tracked]] for seven to 13 successive days in the western part of the island. Their home ranges overlapped extensively in all periods. The periodical home range of the male was {{convert|0.83|–|1.65|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} in size, and the resident female's range was {{convert|0.76|–|1.84|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Center /&gt;&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-75-117 /&gt;&lt;ref name=nakanishi05&gt;Nakanishi, N., Okamura, M., Watanabe, S., Izawa, M., Doi, T. (2005). [http://www.bioone.org/doi/pdf/10.3106/1348-6160%282005%2930%5B1%3ATEOHOH%5D2.0.CO%3B2 ''The effect of habitat on home range size in the Iriomote Cat "Prionailurus bengalensis iriomotensis" '']. Mammal Study 30: 1–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Iriomote cats are [[Territoriality|territorial]].&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-75-117 /&gt; Home ranges of males and females overlap, and one to two females live within a male's home range.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-75-117 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Yamaneko_center /&gt; Typically, home ranges of same gender cats will not overlap, but partial overlaps are seen.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-75-117 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Yamaneko_center /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wildlife_2006 /&gt; Often, these small overlaps are hunting grounds.&lt;ref name=Wildlife_2006 /&gt; It is thought that they patrol their territories during three to four days, marking and hunting as they go.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-75-117 /&gt;

Young male Iriomote cats and some adult cats are transient, i. e. wandering over the island and waiting for an open home range slot that they can occupy by marking this area.&lt;ref name=Yamaneko_center /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wildlife_2006 /&gt; Female cats allow their young to stay in their own home range and mark a new territory once the next breeding season comes.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1986 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ohara_2000 /&gt;

===Feeding ecology===
[[File:Slaty-legged Crake ( Rallina eurizonoides).jpg|thumb|right|[[Slaty-legged crake]]s make up a portion of Iriomote cats' diet]]
Iriomote cats are [[carnivorous]] and prey on various mammals, [[birds]], [[reptiles]], [[amphibians]], [[fish]], and [[crustaceans]]. They typically ingest {{convert|400–600|g|lb|abbr=on}} of food a day.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_2004 /&gt; Other wild cats primarily hunt small mammals, such as [[rodents]] and [[rabbits]], but because there are no other carnivores to compete with the Iriomote cat on the island, there is no need for them to isolate themselves from the various habitats and food sources that are available. Thus, their diet is quite varied.&lt;ref name=Wildlife_2006&gt;{{Cite book |author=財団法人　自然環境研究センター |title=イリオモテヤマネコBOOK |language=Japanese |trans-title=The Iriomote Cat BOOK |publisher= 株式会社高陽堂印刷 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mammalian prey includes [[black rats]], [[Ryukyu flying fox]]es and young Ryukyu [[wild boar]]. Their prey also includes a wide range of birds, such as the [[spot-billed duck]], [[slaty-legged crake]], [[Eurasian scops-owl]], [[pale thrush]], and [[white-breasted waterhen]].&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1986 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Red_2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Center /&gt;
Reptiles include various types of snakes and [[Eumeces kishinouyei|Kishinoue's giant skink]].&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1986 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Red_2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Center /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sakaguchi, N., Ono, Y. (1994). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/v861r72n28545275/fulltext.pdf ''Seasonal change in the food habits of the Iriomote cat 'Felis iriomotensis' '']. Ecological Research 9 (2): 167−174.&lt;/ref&gt; They are also known to hunt [[rice frog|Sakishima rice frogs]], [[yellow-spotted crickets]] and [[crabs]].&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1986 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Red_2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Center /&gt; As their hunting grounds tend to be in [[swamps]] or on [[shore]]s, they sometimes swim and dive to catch water birds, fish, and freshwater prawns.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wildlife_2006 /&gt;

When eating birds that are larger than a [[dusky thrush]], most types of cats will pluck the feathers and then eat it, but the Iriomote cat will eat even large birds whole without removing the feathers.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_2004 /&gt; Also, unlike other cats, the Iriomote cat does not kill its prey immediately by breaking the [[spinal cord]]. Instead, it holds the animal in its mouth until it stops moving.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1986 /&gt;

It is estimated that water birds comprise about 60% of the cat's diet with black rats being its secondary source of food at about 10–30% of its diet.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-75-117 /&gt; Based on [[feces|stool]] samples, birds represent 60% of their diet, black rats 30%, insects 30%, lizards and frogs about 15–20%, bats 3–17%, and wild pig less than 1%. In addition, fish and crustaceans appear roughly 3–4% of the time.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-75-117&gt;{{cite book |last=今泉 |first=忠明 |script-title=ja:イリオモテヤマネコの百科 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Iriomote Wild Cat Encyclopedia |isbn=4887182856 |publisher=Data House |year=1994 |pages=75–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-75-117 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Anma_2001&gt;{{Cite book |last= 安間 |first=繁樹 |script-title=ja:琉球列島　生物の多様性と列島のおいたち |language=Japanese |trans-title=The Ryukyu Archipelago: Diversity of Animals and Island Development |pages=112–147 |isbn= 978-4-48601555-0 |publisher= 東海大学出版会 |year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seasonal dietary changes have been observed. They eat rats and frogs year-round, lizards in the summer and spring, and crickets and bats more often in the fall and winter.&lt;ref name=Wildlife_2006 /&gt;

===Reproductive behavior===
During the [[mating season]], Iriomote cats become active during the day as well.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-119-157 /&gt; Breeding females are more active than nonbreeding ones during the late night and morning hours.&lt;ref name=schmidt09&gt;Schmidt, K., Nakanishi, N.,Izawa, M., Okamura, M., Watanabe, S., Tanaka, S. Doi, T. (2009). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/y7v7w37h8143v413/fulltext.pdf ''The reproductive tactics and activity patterns of solitary carnivores: the Iriomote cat'']. Journal of Ethology 27: 165–174.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the mating season the cats live in solitary, but when they begin breeding they act together.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-119-157 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-75-117 /&gt; The mating season lasts from December to March, and females go into heat several times during this period, with the peak being in January and February.&lt;ref name=Red_2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-75-117 /&gt;&lt;ref name=schmidt09/&gt; Towards the end of February, they fast for about two weeks. It is during this period that females are most sexually excited. Male and female cats always stay together at this time, and it is thought that [[fertilisation|conception]] happens during these two weeks.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-119-157 /&gt;

Pregnancy is [[viviparity|viviparous]], and between April and June pregnant female cats give birth to 1–3 kittens in a tree hollow or cavern.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-119-157 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Yamaneko_center&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iwcc.a.la9.jp/ym_about.htm |script-title=ja:イリオモテヤマネコについて |author=西表野生生物保護センター |language=Japanese |trans-title=About Iriomote Cats |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The locations chosen for birthing and rearing are dry and have good ventilation.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-119-157 /&gt; Kittens stay with their mother for about eleven months.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-119-157 /&gt; They begin to become more independent during the fall and winter months. They stay in their mother's home range from anywhere between a few months and years.&lt;ref name=Wildlife_2006 /&gt; Kittens reach [[sexual maturity|maturity]] twenty months after birth.&lt;ref name=Ohara_2000 /&gt;

===Lifespan===
It is estimated that Iriomote cats live for seven to eight years in the wild, and eight to nine years in captivity.&lt;ref name=Ohara_2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-119-157 /&gt; Human influences, traffic accidents and [[animal trapping|traps]] may lower their lifespan to two to five years.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-119-157 /&gt; In captivity, an Iriomote cat lived for an estimated 15 years and one month, the longest known lifespan of any Iriomote cat.&lt;ref name=Yon_death&gt;{{cite web |author=Ealey, M. |url=http://english.ryukyushimpo.jp/2011/04/12/220/ |title=Oldest Iriomote wildcat dies aged 15 years one month |publisher=Ryukyu Shimpo |year=2011 |accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The Iriomote cat was discovered in 1965 by {{nihongo|Yukio Togawa|戸川幸夫|Togawa Yukio}}, an author who specialized in works about animals. In 1967, it was first described by [[Yoshinori Imaizumi]], director of the zoological department of the [[National Museum of Nature and Science]] in [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1967&gt;{{cite journal |last=Imaizumi |first1=Y. |year=1966–1967 |script-title=ja:琉球, 西表島産の山猫 (新属新種) について |language=Japanese |trans-title=A new genus and species of cat from Iriomote, Ryukyu Islands |journal=哺乳動物学雑誌 |volume=3 |pages=75–105 |publisher=日本哺乳動物学界 |issn=1884-393X |format=pdf |accessdate=June 8, 2012 |url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jmammsocjapan1952/3/4/3_4_75/_pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to its scientific discovery, the Iriomote cat was known locally by various names: {{nihongo3|"the cat in the mountain"|ヤママヤー|'''yamamayaa'''}}, {{nihongo3|"that which shines on the mountain"|ヤマピカリャー|'''yamapikaryaa'''}}. To distinguish between the Iriomote cat and other cats on the island, locals also gave other cats nicknames such as {{nihongo3||ピンギマヤ|pingimaya}} for stray cats and {{nihongo3||マヤ|maya}} or {{nihongo3||マヤグヮー|mayagwaa}} for house cats.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-8-13-144-147&gt;{{cite book |last=今泉 |first=忠明 |script-title=ja:イリオモテヤマネコの百科 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Iriomote Wild Cat Encyclopedia |isbn=4887182856 |publisher=Data House |year=1994 |pages=8–13, 144–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-8-13-144-147 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-13-92&gt;{{cite book |last=戸川 |first=幸夫 |script-title=ja:イリオモテヤマネコ：原始の西表で発見された〝生きた化石動物〟の謎 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Iriomote Cat: the Mystery of the "Living Fossil" Discovered on Primeval Iriomote Island |publisher=自由国民社 | year=1972 |pages=13–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, believed that the Iriomote cat was a [[feral]] cat.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1986 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1991 /&gt;

===Prior to specimen acquisition===
Based on information from the locals, {{nihongo4|Tetsuo Koura|高良鉄夫|Koura Tetsuo}} from the [[University of the Ryukyus]] was able to capture a kitten in 1962, but did not get an adult specimen.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1986 /&gt; In 1964, {{nihongo4|Tokio Takano|高野凱夫|Takano Tokio}} from the exploration department of [[Waseda University]] informed Imaizumi of the rumors of a cat living in the mountains of Iriomote.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt;

In February 1965 Togawa visited the [[Yaeyama Islands]]. He had heard in [[Naha]] from a newspaper columnist that there were rumors of wild cats living on Iriomote.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-13-92 /&gt; He at first assumed that, like reports of the extinct [[Japanese wolf]], people must have been mistaking escaped and [[feral]] house pets for wild animals. He spoke with colleague Tetsuo Koura who knew of and believed there to be some truth to the rumors. Koura then entrusted Togawa with the task of acquiring evidence.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-13-92 /&gt; Togawa then traveled to Iriomote to gather information for his own report and to collect information on the Iriomote cat and a specimen.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-13-92 /&gt;

Upon arriving on the island, Togawa learned that because there wasn't enough food on Iriomote, people would cook Iriomote cats that had been caught and use the meat in soup. Cats caught in traps would also be disposed of, which made acquiring samples difficult.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-13-92 /&gt;

Following these discoveries, he went to the hamlet of {{nihongo4|Amitori|網取部落|Amitori Buraku}} on the western side of the island. There, a middle school teacher who had worked under Koura said that he had caught one of the cats in a trap set for wild boar. He had sent the skin to Koura but buried the rest of the body. Togawa dug up the remains and got the skull. He also found two feces samples near the village, and was able to get a skin from a fisherman who lived in {{nihongo4|Inaba|イナバ部落|Inaba Buraku}}, a hamlet along [[Urauchi River]].&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-13-92 /&gt;

He returned to Koura and sent the two skins, the feces, and the skull to Yoshinori Imaizumi at the National Museum of Nature and Science where {{nihongo4|[[The Mammalogical Society of Japan]]|日本哺乳動物学会|Nihon Honyū Dōbutsu Gakkai}} tested the subjects.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-13-92 /&gt; The analysis took place on March 14, 1965.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt; The results showed the cat to be either a new species or a new subspecies, but there weren't enough samples to confirm. They requested either a complete set of remains or a live specimen.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt; Following the announcement, some members of the society believed the samples to show simple mutations while others believed them to be the remains of wild cats that had previously been brought to and left on the island by foreign ships.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-13-92 /&gt;

===Live specimen acquisition to announcement===
In June 1965, Togawa returned to Iriomote with Koura in order to obtain a complete set of remains, a live specimen, and information regarding the cat's [[ecology]]. They brought box traps and [[Actinidia polygama|silvervine]] to aid their efforts in catching a live cat. According to hunters, though, only one or two cats per year were caught, and the number of remaining cats was probably quite low. Togawa did not expect to catch one alive.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-93-138&gt;{{cite book |last=戸川 |first=幸夫 |script-title=ja:イリオモテヤマネコ：原始の西表で発見された〝生きた化石動物〟の謎 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Iriomote Cat: the Mystery of the "Living Fossil" Discovered on Primeval Iriomote Island |publisher=自由国民社 | year=1972 |pages=93–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mare falls.jpg|thumb|right| Maaree Waterfall, where a group of children found an Iriomote cat on May 5, 1965]]
In May 1965, prior to Togawa's return to the island, a group of children from {{nihongo4|Ōhara Elementary School|大原小学校}} on a field trip to the southern part of the island found a weakened, injured male Iriomote cat at the base of the small {{nihongo4|Maaree Waterfall|マーレー滝|Maaree Taki}} on {{nihongo4|Haemita Beach|南風見田の浜|Haemita no Hama}}. The teacher in charge of the children took the cat. Another teacher preserved the pelt in [[formalin]] and buried the skeleton in a wooden box behind the school. Togawa exhumed the remains, and this cat became the prototype for the species.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-93-138 /&gt; In addition to this example, the scientists also were able to obtain the crushed skull of a kitten from the neighboring [[Yubu Island]] that was later reconstructed by Imaizumi.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-93-138 /&gt;

In addition to researching the Iriomote cat, Togawa also looked into rumors of a larger cat on the island (see [[#Yamapikaryaa]]) and conducted an investigation.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-93-138 /&gt; Before returning to [[Tokyo]], he offered $100 for any live Iriomote cat and $30 for dead cats that were brought to him. With the aid of the [[Taketomi, Okinawa|Taketomi]] mayor and the {{nihongo4|[[Daily Yaeyama Newspaper]]|八重山毎日新聞|Yaeyama Mainichi Shinbun}}, he was able to publicize the offer on bulletin boards and in other ways.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-139-176 /&gt; He also announced rewards for the rumored large cat on the island: $200 if brought in alive, $100 for remains.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-139-176 /&gt;

Through these offers, he acquired two complete skeletons, two skulls, and three pelts that he brought back with him to Tokyo. One of the pelts was that which the elementary school children helped obtain, and it was confirmed to be that of an Iriomote cat. The sample from Yubu Island was small, and judgment was held back. A sample from [[Ishigaki Island]] was discovered to be a house cat.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-139-176 /&gt;

In January 1966, the body of an Iriomote cat that had been caught in a wild boar trap in the mid-basin of the [[Nakama River]] was sent to Koura at the University of the Ryukyus, but there was no more information regarding captures for some time after this.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-139-176 /&gt; In December 1966, {{nihongo4|Hiroshi Kuroda|黒田宏|Kuroda Hiroshi}}, a hunter at the Nakama River's mid-basin, caught a live male cat, but it escaped immediately.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-139-176 /&gt; He then caught another male cat soon after.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt;

On January 15, 1966, local hunters caught a young female Iriomote cat near {{nihongo4|[[Nakama Mountain]]|仲間山|Nakama-yama}}.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-139-176 /&gt; The National Museum of Nature and Science planned on using funds intended for garden repairs to pay for the specimens, but the hunters who caught the cats expected $1000–$3000 per cat.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-139-176 /&gt; At the persuasion of the director of the District Forestry Office, the hunters accepted an award within the budget as a “daily allowance” or “finder's fee”.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-139-176 /&gt;

During this time, the mayor of Taketomi was making negotiations with the {{nihongo4|[[Southern Japan Liaison Offices]]|南方連絡事務所|Nanpō Renraku Jimusho}} and the Ryukyu government. He traveled to Naha for these discussions, which covered the possibility of offering the two captured Iriomote cats to the [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]] with the stated purpose of increasing national knowledge about Iriomote and for the promotion of industrial development on the island. At the same time, the Taketomi town offices, under the premise of obtaining permission from the Ryukyu government to keep the cats, confiscated samples from the staff of the National Museum of Nature and Science and brought them back to their offices.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-139-176 /&gt;

With Togawa pressuring the newspapers and Yoshinori Imaizumi urging the Ryukyuan government and Southern Japan Liaison Offices through the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Ministry of Education]], the Southern Japan Liaison Offices denied the possibility of giving the cats to the emperor, and the Ryukyuan government persuaded the mayor not to follow through with his plans. Finally, the specimens were delivered to the museum.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-139-176 /&gt;

The cats arrived at [[Haneda airport]] in March 1967.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-139-176 /&gt; Yoshinori Imaizumi kept them shortly until Togawa, having been entrusted by the museum to observe them, took charge of them for about two years.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-177-242&gt;{{cite book |last=戸川 |first=幸夫 |script-title=ja:イリオモテヤマネコ：原始の西表で発見された〝生きた化石動物〟の謎 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Iriomote Cat: the Mystery of the "Living Fossil" Discovered on Primeval Iriomote Island |publisher=自由国民社 | year=1972 |pages=177–242}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cats were then transferred to the museum for monitoring. The male died on April 25, 1973 and the female on December 13, 1975. The male's pelt was temporarily [[Taxidermy|stuffed]], the blood was sent off for [[chromosomal]] research, and the rest of the body was preserved in [[formaldehyde]]. The female was stuffed and put on display in the museum.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt;

In May 1967, The Mammalogical Society of Japan issued their third and fourth issues, announcing in English the discovery of a new genus of cat that was closely related to the primitive cat genus ''[[Metailurus]]''.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt; The former genus name of ''Mayailurus'' stems from the word used for “cat” on Iriomote, ''maya-'', while ''-ailurus'' comes ancient Greek and also means “cat”.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt; The subspecies name of ''iriomotensis'' means “from Iriomote”.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt; The Japanese name of {{nihongo4|Togawa mountain cat|トガワヤマネコ|Togawa-yamaneko}} was proposed by Yoshinori Imaizumi, in honor of Togawa who discovered the species, but Togawa turned down the request and instead supported the name {{nihongo4|'''Iriomote cat'''|イリオモテヤマネコ|Iriomote-yamaneko}} based on the Tsushima cat, which was also named after the location at which it was discovered. Koura agreed with Togawa, thus officiating the name.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-13-92 /&gt;

==Classification and genealogy==
In 1967, Dr. {{nihongo4|Yoshinori Imaizumi|今泉吉典|Imaizumi Yoshinori}} announced the Iriomote cat to the scientific community as a new species of [[Felinae|feline]] in its own [[genus]]. It was labeled ''Mayailurus iriomotensis''.&lt;ref name=Masuda_1996 /&gt; Dr. Imaizumi pointed out that, compared to other leopard cats, the Iriomote cat retained some especially primitive features. Judging from these characteristics, Yoshinori Imaizumi estimated that the Iriomote cat appeared as a species sometime between ten million years ago in the [[Miocene epoch]] and three million years ago during the [[Pliocene epoch]]. He also believed that they shared many primitive characteristics with fossils in the extinct genus ''[[Metailurus]]''.&lt;ref name=Masuda_1996 /&gt; He emphasized these points, stating that the Iriomote cat and ''Metailurus'' shared a common ancestor sometime between ten million and five million years ago,&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Masuda_1996 /&gt; and from that he deducted that the Iriomote cat's ancestors must have widened its range from mainland [[Asia]] to Iriomote and other areas beginning three million years ago.&lt;ref name=Masuda_1996 /&gt; It appears to be a very ancient species, a ‘missing link’, nearer to the common root of the cat tribe than any other extant species.&lt;ref&gt;Leyhausen, P., Pfleiderer, M. (1999). ''The systematic status of the Iriomote cat (Prionailurus iriomotensis Imaizumi 1967) and the subspecies of the leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis Kerr 1792)''. Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research 37: 121–131.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to Dr. Imaizumi's assertions about its unique characteristics, other researchers have strongly disputed the idea that the Iriomote cat is its own species ever since its discovery. Investigations involving skulls and teeth, samples and living animals, and genetic research were conducted to determine whether it is its own species or a subspecies of leopard cat.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1986 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Masuda_1996 /&gt; Because of these studies, it has been subordinated under the genus ''[[Prionailurus]]'' as ''Prionailurus iriomotensis''.&lt;ref name=msw3&gt;{{MSW3 Wozencraft |id=14000193 |pages=543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iriomote cat's [[karyotype]], the restriction fragment length of the [[ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA), and [[molecular phylogenetic]] analyses of the [[mitochondrial]] 12S rRNA and [[cytochrome b]] have proven to be identical, or nearly so, to the leopard cat's.&lt;ref name=Masuda_1996 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Suzuki_1994&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suzuki |first1=Hitoshi |last2=Hosoda |first2=Tetsuji |last3=Sakurai |first3=Susumu |last4=Tsuchiya |first4=Kimiyuki |last5=Munechika |first5=Isao |last6=Korablev |first6=Vladimir P. |date=August 1994 |title=Phylogenetic relationship between the Iriomote cat and the leopard cat, Felis bengalensis, based on the ribosomal DNA |journal=The Japanese Journal of Genetics |volume=69 |issue=4 |pages=397–406 |publisher=The Genetics Society of Japan |issn=0021-504X |doi=10.1266/jjg.69.397}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two cats are assumed to be extremely closely related, their differences being categorized as either intraspecies variations or individual [[mutations]]. Also, from the speed of cytochrome b's [[base-pair substitution]] and its diversity, it is estimated that the Iriomote cat diverged from the leopard cat around 180,000-200,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=Masuda_1995&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Masuda R, Yoshida MC |title=Two Japanese wildcats, the Tsushima cat and the Iriomote cat, show the same mitochondrial DNA lineage as the leopard cat ''Felis bengalensis'' |journal=Zoological Science |year= 1995 |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=656–9 |doi=10.2108/zsj.12.655}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[marine geology|marine geologists]], the [[Ryukyu Islands]] were connected to mainland Asia via a [[land bridge]] from about 20,000 years ago to 240,000 years ago. Scientists believe that the Iriomote cat moved its range to the islands during this period.&lt;ref name=Masuda_1996 /&gt; Because of this, it is assumed that there is little [[genetic variety]] within the species.&lt;ref name=Center /&gt;&lt;ref name=Warren_1999&gt;{{cite book |last1=Johnson |first1=Warren E. |last2=Shinyashiki |first2=Fumiharu |last3=Menotti-Raymond |first3=Marilyn |last4=Driscoll |first4=Carlos |last5=Leh |first5=Charles |last6=Sunquist |first6=Mel |last7=Johnston |first7=Leslie |last8=Bush |first8=Mitchel |last9=Wildt |first9=David |last10=Yuhki |first10=Naoya |last11=O'Brien |first11=Stephen J. |title=Molecular Genetic Characterization of Two Insular Asian Cat Species, Bornean Bay Cat and Iriomote Cat |journal=Evolutionary Theory and Processes: Modern Perspectives |year= 1999 |pages=223–248 |displayauthors=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threats==
[[File:Warning signs for Iriomote cat.jpg|thumb|right|Sign warning motorists of animals, with a picture of an Iriomote cat]]
Destruction of habitat due to development, predation by dogs, traffic accidents, and traps set for wild boar and crabs all contribute to the decline in number of Iriomote cats.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1986 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ohara_2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Red_2005 /&gt; During the second survey of the island, conducted from 1982–1984, it was estimated that 83–108 Iriomote cats lived on the island. The third survey, conducted from 1993–1994, estimated that 99–110 of the cats were on the island. During the fourth survey, conducted from 2005–2007, there were an estimated 100–109 remaining cats.&lt;ref name=Ministry_environment&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.env.go.jp/press/press.php?serial=10060 |script-title=ja:イリオモテヤマネコ生息状況等総合調査（第４次）の結果について（お知らせ） |author=環境省 |language=Japanese |trans-title=(Fourth) Survey of the State of the Iriomote Cat's Habitat: Regarding the Results (notice) |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Center /&gt; The method of estimating the numbers differed between the third and fourth surveys, though; if the third estimate were to be revised, there would have been an estimated 108–118 Iriomote cats at the time, meaning that the population is shrinking over time.&lt;ref name=Ministry_environment /&gt;

Along with the traffic accidents, logging due to development, and development of the swamplands, house pets are also causing problems. House cats and stray cats especially cause issues with competition, disease transmission, and [[genetic pollution]] due to [[hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] born of inter-species breeding. It is also feared that dogs prey on the Iriomote cats.&lt;ref name=Red_2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Center /&gt;&lt;ref name=tropics&gt;{{cite journal|author=伊津雅子, 阪口法明|author2=土肥昭夫|last-author-amp=yes|year=2000|title=Recent conservation programs for the Iriomote cat Felis iriomotensis|journal=Tropics|volume=10|issue=1|pages=79–85|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/tropics/10/1/10_1_79/_pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Iriomote wildlife conservation centre.jpg|thumb|left|Iriomote Wildlife Conservation Center]]
The primary fear stems from house cats that have become feral or partially feral, but there has been no monitoring of these interactions. Pressure from competition over food, contact with house cats that have contracted [[feline immunodeficiency virus]] (FIV) and other contagious diseases, as well as decrease in population due to hybridization are all important issues with the Iriomote cat.&lt;ref name=Red_2005 /&gt;

In June 1999, the Iriomote Wildlife Protection Center conducted an investigation among 50 house and feral cats and 23 Iriomote cats in order to see if FIV was being transmitted within the populations. FIV was not seen in any of the Iriomote cats, but three of the house and feral cats tested positive.&lt;ref name=Cat_AIDS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iwcc.a.la9.jp/iwcc.htm |script-title=ja:西表で猫エイズ初確認/イリオモテヤマネコへの感染懸念/環境庁などが野良猫調査/県、竹富町と対策協議へ*影響は全く未知数 |author=琉球新報 |language=Japanese |trans-title=First Confirmation of Feline AIDS on Iriomote/Fears of Transmission to Iriomote Cats/EPA Surveys Strays/Okinawa Prefecture, Taketomi Town to Discuss Counter-Measures*Number Affected Unknown |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the fears regarding transmission of the disease, starting in 2001 Taketomi Town enacted the Cat Breeding Ordinance which required all residents to register their pet cats. In June 2008, the ordinance was revised to include mandatory FIV testing and vaccinations, spaying and neutering, and microchipping. A new limit to the number of pets allowed per owner was also added.&lt;ref name=Desex&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ryukyushimpo.jp/news/storyid-133305-storytopic-1.html |script-title=ja:飼い猫の避妊義務化　イリオモテヤマネコ保護 |author=琉球新報 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Desexing of House Cats Becomes Mandatory; Preservation of Iriomote Cats |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the [[cane toad]], which secretes a poisonous liquid from glands in its ears, has also appeared on the island. In order to prevent further contamination of Iriomote, residents of Ishigaki Island began extermination measures in 2008.&lt;ref name=IWCC_Crisis&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iwcc.a.la9.jp/ym_kiki.htm |script-title=ja:ヤマネコにせまる危機 |author=IWCC |language=Japanese |trans-title=Crisis Approaching Iriomote Cats |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Invasive&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.y-mainichi.co.jp/news/15157/ |script-title=ja:外来生物次々と侵入　広がる生態系への影響 |author=八重山毎日新聞 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Invasive Species Come One After Another; The Broadening Ecological Influences |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==

===Status===
Since 2008, the Iriomote cat is categorized as "critically endangered" by IUCN.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;

The Iriomote cat has been designated a natural monument by the [[Okinawa]] government.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-139-176&gt;{{cite book |last=戸川 |first=幸夫 |script-title=ja:イリオモテヤマネコ：原始の西表で発見された〝生きた化石動物〟の謎 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Iriomote Cat: the Mystery of the "Living Fossil" Discovered on Primeval Iriomote Island |publisher=自由国民社 | year=1972 |pages=139–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 15, 1972, along with the recovery of Okinawa, it was nationally recognized as a [[Monuments of Japan#Natural Monuments and Special Natural Monuments|natural monument]]. On March 15, 1977, it was given special status amongst natural monuments, and in 1994 with the Species Protection Act, it was designated as a {{nihongo4|Specified National Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora|国内希少野生動植物種|Kokunai Kishō Yasei Dōshokubutsu-shu}}.&lt;ref name=Kato_1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Center /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rare_animals&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.env.go.jp/nature/yasei/hozonho/list_domestic.pdf |script-title=ja:国内希少野生動植物種 |author=環境省 |language=Japanese |trans-title=National Rare Species |accessdate=10 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620202308/http://www.env.go.jp/nature/yasei/hozonho/list_domestic.pdf |archivedate=20 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This act was adopted on January 28 and enacted on March 1.&lt;ref name=Ministry_nature&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.env.go.jp/press/press.php?serial=8648 |title=哺乳類、汽水・淡水魚類、昆虫類、貝類、植物 I 及び植物 II のレッドリストの見直しについて |author=環境省自然環境局野生生物課 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Mammals, Brackish Water and Fresh Water Fish, Insects, Shellfish, and Plants I Plants II Regarding Changes to the Red List |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Projects and activities===
In 1977, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] wrote a letter addressed to Crown Prince [[Akihito]] regarding the preservation of the Iriomote cat. The report attached to the letter (written by Professor Leyhausen) suggested outlawing any further migration to the island as well as banning the cultivation of the land.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-119-157 /&gt; In response, Crown Prince Akihito said that he wished for a way that would allow for the preservation of the cats and the continued habitation of people on the island. He also explained that the prime minister at the time, [[Takeo Fukuda]], was considering the implementation of a wildlife sanctuary on Iriomote.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-119-157 /&gt;

[[File:Iriomote yamaneko warning sign.jpg|thumb|left|Sign warning motorists of Iriomote cats. The number is used in reporting sightings of the cat.]]
In 1972, the National Museum of Nature and Science prepared for researching the ecology of Iriomote cats, and in November 1973 the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and the [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]] conducted a joint preliminary investigation regarding the cat's ecology,&lt;ref name=Ministry_environment /&gt;&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-7-48 /&gt; and from 1974 the Ministry of the Environment conducted a comprehensive investigation that lasted three years. After that, there were three more investigations beginning in 1982, 1992, and 2005.&lt;ref name=Ministry_environment /&gt;

In 1979, the EPA began a three-year-long feeding operation in order to increase the survival rate of kittens,&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-119-157 /&gt; but these actions have received some criticism.&lt;ref name=Ohara_2000 /&gt;

Since the Iriomote cat's discovery, various investigations have taken place. In 2006, automatic cameras and radio telemetry were used in order to understand the cats' state of life. Pathological tests regarding the contagiousness of diseases were also conducted, and tests on feces and food leftovers were also done. They also compiled records of cat sightings by locals and tourists.&lt;ref name=Wildlife_2006 /&gt;

Part of the Iriomote's cat range was designated as {{nihongo4|Iriomote Ryukyu Government Park|西表政府立公園|Iriomote Seifu-ritsu Kōen}} on April 18, 1972. With the [[History of the Ryukyu Islands#Post-war occupation|US's return of the Ryukyu Islands to Japanese control]] on May 15, it became [[Iriomote-Ishigaki National Park|Iriomote National Park]], and in March 1991 11,584.67 [[hectares]] of the island was designated the {{nihongo4|Iriomote Forest and Ecological Preserve|西表島森林生態系保護地域|Iriomote-jima Shinrin Seitaikei Hogo Chiiki}} in order to protect the natural environment within the area's confines.&lt;ref name=Ministry_basic&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.env.go.jp/park/iriomote/intro/basis.html |script-title=ja:西表石垣国立公園　基礎情報 |author=環境省 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Iriomote-Ishigaki National Park: Basic Information |accessdate=10 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120044938/http://www.env.go.jp/park/iriomote/intro/basis.html |archivedate=20 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kyushu_forest&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rinya.maff.go.jp/kyusyu/okinawa/sinrinkanrisyo/hogotiiki/index.html |script-title=ja:西表島森林生態系保護地域（保全利用地区・保存地区） |author=九州森林管理局 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Iriomote Forest and Ecological Preserve (Complete Area, Preservation Area) Information |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these efforts, not enough land within the cats' preferred habitat of 200 meters below sea level was included. In 1995 the {{nihongo4|Iriomote Wildlife Preservation Center|西表野生生物保護センター|Iriomote Yaseisei Seibutsu Hogo Sentā}} was established to increase preservation work, enforce research, and to increase understanding of the cats.&lt;ref name=Center /&gt;

[[File:Zebra zone at iriomote.jpg|thumb|right|"Zebra zone" strips and inclined ditches on an Iriomote road]]
Since the US returned control of the Ryukyu Islands to Japan in 1972, development on Iriomote continued with finances from the Okinawan mainland. In 1977, a prefectural road was built that circles half of the island, which has led to a few Iriomote cat deaths every year due to traffic accidents.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-119-157 /&gt; The Ministry of the Environment as well as the governments of Okinawa and Taketomi Town began installing road signs to warn people of Iriomote cats, tunnels beneath the road for animals' safe crossing, zebra zones which create loud noises when cars ride over them, wide ditches on the sides of roads, and ditches on the side of the road that are inclined on one side in order to improve the preservation of the cats.&lt;ref name=Center /&gt;&lt;ref name=Protect_cats&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iwcc.a.la9.jp/iwcc.htm |title=イリオモテヤマネコを守る！～IWCCの取り組み |author=西表野生生物保護センター |language=Japanese |trans-title=Protect the Iriomote Cats! ~IWCC's Efforts |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many residents have objected to restrictions on land cultivation and improvement brought about by the measures in place to protect the Iriomote cat and other species on the island.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-119-157 /&gt;

===In captivity===
There have been a handful of Iriomote cats kept in captivity. A five-week-old male kitten that had been separated from its mother was found on June 14, 1979. He was named Keita and was kept at the [[Okinawa Zoo]] until he died of old age at approximately thirteen years and two months of age.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-119-157 /&gt; A female specimen was also kept at the [[National Museum of Nature and Science]]. She was believed to have been approximately nine years and seven months old when she died.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-119-157 /&gt; On August 6, 1996, a male kitten that would later be known as Yon was taken into care at the Iriomote Wildlife Protection Center after being involved in a traffic accident.&lt;ref name=Yon_death /&gt;

===Yon===

====Discovery and hospitalization====
[[File:Iriomote yamaneko-yon.jpg|thumb|right|The taxidermied body of "Yon". He was hit by a car on August 6, 1996 then rehabilitated at the Iriomote Wildlife Conservation Center. He died on April 9, 2011 at the estimated age of fifteen years and one month, the longest confirmed lifespan of any Iriomote cat.&lt;ref name=Yon_death /&gt;]]
On August 6, 1996, a young Iriomote cat was involved in a traffic accident near Nadara Bridge on the northern part of the island. He weighed 1.6 kilograms and was assumed to have been born in early March, making him about five months old. It is possible that he had just been separated from his mother. The next morning he had regained consciousness, but he wasn't able to regulate his body temperature due to the serious injuries he received. He was transferred to Ishigaki Island at 9 am to receive medical care at Ishigaki Veterinary Clinic. He spent 24 days under their care.&lt;ref name=Yon&gt;{{cite book |last=西表野生生物保護センター |title=W-48: イリオモテヤマネコよんの歩み |language=Japanese |trans-title=W-48: Yon the Iriomote Cat's Progress |type=brochure}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the accident he couldn't move on his own, but he regained his ability to walk while on Ishigaki. He was brought back to the Iriomote Wildlife Preservation Center for rehabilitation on August 31. Originally labeled W-48 due to the fact that he was the forty-eighth confirmed sighting of an Iriomote cat on the western part of the island, he eventually was given the name Yon.&lt;ref name=Yon /&gt;

====Rehabilitation====
By September 2, Yon weighed 1.9 kilograms. Despite his progress, his caretakers noticed a tendency for him to turn to the right because of the effects of his accident.&lt;ref name=Yon /&gt;

From the beginning, Yon's caretakers took careful measures in order to avoid acclimation to humans so that one day he could be released back into the wild. Only three staff members were allowed to feed him directly. Other people, including center staff, were only allowed to view him via video camera monitoring. The media were also prohibited from taking direct photographs.&lt;ref name=Yon /&gt;

From the time he was discharged until February 3, 1999 Yon's rehabilitation was restricted to a room within the center. Thin logs were used to make a jungle gym so that he would be able to practice walking, jumping, and climbing trees. Rice plants were also grown in his room as a substitute for grass that cats use to help regurgitate. Once he was healthy enough, he was moved to an outdoor cage where he lived until his health began deteriorating on December 20, 2010.&lt;ref name=Yon /&gt;

He was permanently handicapped after his accident; his left paw was paralyzed, and he tended to move towards the right.&lt;ref name=Yon /&gt;

====Death====
On December 20, 2010 Yon was found to be curled up and unmoving near a dried stream. He was brought into the center's rehabilitation room, where it was discovered that he had [[pulmonary edema]], which had nearly killed him; however, he was able to eat by the next day and gradually got better. He was unable to walk for the remainder of December, though by the end of January he had regained this ability and, during February and March, he improved enough to be able to walk up and down stairs. However, his condition then took a turn for the worse, and he died on the night of April 9 at an estimated fifteen years and one month old. He weighed 3.5 kilograms and was 78.5 centimeters long. He is the oldest Iriomote cat on record.&lt;ref name=Yon /&gt;

====Influence on research====
Yon was the first Iriomote cat to be kept for an extended period of time, the only to be saved after an accident, and the first to go through rehabilitation. Other Iriomote cats that were rescued either died immediately or shortly after being brought in for care.&lt;ref name=Yon /&gt;

Though he was never returned to the wild, the recorded observations of Yon are extremely important regarding Iriomote cat preservation. Every day, records were taken including what he did at what time, weight, and anything else of note. Because of difficulties in researching Iriomote cats in the wild, observations of Yon are currently the best example of the cats' natural behavior. There are also very few cases of the cats being cared for by people, so records of his health care may help injured and sick Iriomote cats in the future.&lt;ref name=Yon /&gt;

==In culture==
On July 30, 2010, the [[Taketomi, Okinawa|Taketomi]] Town Tourist Association invited residents to create a design for a local mascot. A Komi Elementary School sixth grader's design, which was based on the Iriomote cat, was chosen. The island of Iriomote, where Taketomi is located, is pictured on the mascot's chest. It was named in the same manner it was designed; on August 31, 2010 the name {{nihongo|"Pikaryaa"|ピカリャ～}} was chosen based on the submission of an Ishigaki resident who drew inspiration from the local nickname of the cat, ''yamapikaryaa''.&lt;ref name=Pikarya_name&gt;{{cite web |url=http://painusima.com/t10namaebosyu.htm |script-title=ja:竹富町マスコットキャラクター　名前が決定しました！ |author=竹富町観光協会 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Taketomi's Mascot's Name is Picked! |accessdate=10 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909153854/http://painusima.com/t10namaebosyu.htm |archivedate=9 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yamapikaryaa==
In general, names such as ''yamapikaryaa'' are used in reference to the Iriomote cat, but some locals claim to have seen another type of cat on the island. This cat is described as being twice as large as a house cat with a tail that is 60 centimeters long and a coat pattern that is different from what the Iriomote cat displays. It has been sighted several times.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-8-13-144-147 /&gt; Locals have given it several nicknames. In the neighborhoods of Sonai and Komi they call it {{nihongo3||クンズマヤー|kunzumayaa}} and {{nihongo3||トウトウヤー|toutouyaa}}, respectively, and on Aragusu Island they call it {{nihongo3||ヤマピカリャー|yamapikaryaa}}.

In 1965, Togawa spoke with a local hunter who claimed to have killed a large cat with fur like a tiger's. He disposed of the body, and Haemi on the southern part of the island, where the body was disposed of, was searched.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-93-138 /&gt; The hunter said that, until ten days prior to the interview, the cat's skeleton was still where he had left it, but the recent rains had washed it away.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-93-138 /&gt; He described that cat as having a shoulder height that reached an adult human's knee, a tail that was 60 centimeters long, a body twice as large as a house cat's, and greenish striped fur.&lt;ref name=Togawa_1972-93-138 /&gt;

On June 2, 1982 the [[Yomiuri Shimbun]] published an article about ''yamapikaryaa''. An experienced boar hunter claimed to have seen yamapikaryaa about ten times in the mountains around Mount Dedou. He also said that he caught and ate one once. On another occasion, he said he saw an adult female yamapikaryaa with a kitten.&lt;ref name=Imaizumi_1994-8-13-144-147 /&gt;

Other articles regarding ''yamapikaryaa'' have also been published, including on September 14, 2007. Professor {{nihongo4|Eiyuu Akiyoshi|秋吉英雄|Akiyoshi Eiyuu}} of [[Shimane University]], who was staying on Iriomote in order to research fish, spotted a cat larger than the Iriomote cat with a long tail and spots. He saw the cat on {{nihongo4|Sakiyama Peninsula|崎山半島|Sakiyama Hantō}} on the seldom-visited western part of the island.&lt;ref name=Yamapikarya&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ryukyushimpo.jp/news/storyid-30074-storytopic-5.html |script-title=ja:伝説の生物「ヤマピカリャー」？　西表で目撃相次ぐ |author=琉球新報 |language=Japanese |trans-title=The Legendary "Yamapikaryaa"?

[[File:Frauenberg 030.jpg|thumb|[[Fresco]] of the Judgment of Solomon, {{Interlanguage link multi|Wallfahrtskirche Frauenberg|de}} [[Frauenberg, Styria]]]]

The '''Judgment of Solomon''' is a story from the [[Hebrew Bible]] in which [[Solomon|King Solomon of Israel]] ruled between two women both claiming to be the mother of a child. Solomon revealed their true feelings and relationship to the child by suggesting to cut the baby in two, with each woman to receive half. With this strategy,  he was able to discern the non-mother as the woman who entirely approved of this proposal, while the actual mother begged that the sword might be sheathed and the child committed to the care of her rival. Some consider this approach to justice an [[archetype|archetypal]] example of an impartial judge displaying wisdom in making a ruling.

==Biblical narrative==
[[File:Giorgione Salomone.jpg|thumb|''[[The Judgement of Solomon (Giorgione)|The Judgement of Solomon]]'' (School of [[Giorgione]], 1500)]]

{{bibleverse|1|Kings|3:16–28|HE}} recounts that two mothers living in the same house, each the mother of an infant son, came to Solomon. One of the babies [[Overlaying|had been smothered]], and each claimed the remaining boy as her own. Calling for a sword, Solomon declared his judgment: the baby would be cut in two, each woman to receive half. One mother did not contest the ruling, declaring that if she could not have the baby then neither of them could, but the other begged Solomon, "Give the baby to her, just don't kill him!"

The king declared the second woman the true mother, as a mother would even give up her baby if that was necessary to save its life. This judgment became known throughout all of Israel and was considered an example of profound wisdom.

==Classification and parallels==
The story is commonly viewed in scholarship as an instance or a reworking of a [[Folklore|folktale]]. Its folkloristic nature is apparent, among other things, in the dominance of [[direct speech]] which moves the plot on and contributes to the [[characterization]].&lt;ref name="Mordechai Cogan 2001, p. 196"&gt;Mordechai Cogan, ''I Kings'' (Anchor Bible), New York: Doubleday, 2001, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; The story is classified as [[Aarne-Thompson]] tale type 926, and many parallel stories have been found in world [[folklore]]. In Uther's edition of the Aarne-Thompson index,&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Jörg Uther, ''The Types of International Folktales: A Classification and Bibliography, Based on the System of Antii Aarne and Stith Thompson'', I, Helsinki: Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; this tale type is classified as a [[Novella (folklore)|folk novella]], and belongs to a subgroup designated: "Clever Acts and Words". Eli Yassif defines the folk novella as "a realistic story whose time and place are determined&amp;nbsp;... The novella emphasizes such human traits as cleverness, eroticism, loyalty, and wiliness, that drive the plot forward more than any other element".&lt;ref&gt;Eli Yassif, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LbZPv-2LO6YC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Hebrew Folktale: History, Genre, Meaning''] (Folklore Studies in Translation), Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1999, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hugo Gressmann]] has found 22 similar stories in world folklore and literature, especially in India and the far east.&lt;ref&gt;See Hugo Gressmann, [https://archive.org/stream/deutscherundsch130stutuoft#page/212/mode/2up "Das salomonische Urteil"], ''Deutsche Rundschau'' 130 (1907), pp. 212–28&lt;/ref&gt; One Indian version is a [[Jataka]] story dealing with [[Buddha]] in one of his previous incarnations as the sage Mahosadha, who arbitrates between a mother and a [[Yakshini]] who is in the shape of a woman, who kidnapped the mother's baby and claimed he was hers. The sage announced a [[tug war]]: He drew a line on the ground and asked the two to stand on opposite sides of the line, one holding his feet and the other his hands – The one who would pull the baby's whole body beyond the line would get him. The mother, seeing how the baby suffers, released him and let the Yakshini take him, weeping. When the sage saw that, he turned the baby back to the hands of the true mother, exposed the identity of the Yakshini and expelled her.&lt;ref&gt;See E. B. Cowell (ed.), [http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/j6/j6012.htm#page_163 ''The Jātaka, or Stories of the Buddha's Former Births''], VI, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1907, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; In other Indian versions the two women are widows of one husband.&lt;ref&gt;See for example G. R. Subramiah Pantulu, ''Indian Antiquary'' 26 (1897), [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.61241/2015.61241.The-Indian-Antiquary-Vol-Xxvi#page/n111/mode/2up p. 111]&lt;/ref&gt; Another version appears in the Chinese drama [[The Chalk Circle]] (in this version the judge draws a circle on the ground),&lt;ref&gt;Theodor Herzl Gaster, ''Myth, Legend, and Custom in the Old Testament: A Comparative Study with Chapters from Sir James G. Frazer's Folklore in the Old Testament'', II, New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1969, p. 493.&lt;/ref&gt; which has been widespread all over the world and many versions and reworkings were made after it, among them [[The Caucasian Chalk Circle]], a play by [[Bertolt Brecht]].
[[File:Gaspar de Crayer - The judgement of Solomon.jpg|thumb|left|290px|''The judgement of Solomon'' by [[Gaspar de Crayer]], c. 1620]]
The common motif in those different parallels is that the wise judge announces an absurd procedure, which is reasonable in some perverse way: Splitting the baby, according to the principle of compromise; Or a tug war, in which one can possibly assume that the true mother will be motivated to pull harder. But this procedure is actually a concealed emotional test, designed to force each woman to decide whether her compassion to the baby overpowers her will to win.&lt;ref name="William Hansen 2002, p. 228"&gt;William Hansen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ezDlXl7gP9oC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA228#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Ariadne's Thread: A Guide to International Tales Found in Classical Literature''], Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2002, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is indirect evidence that the story was widespread in ancient times in the western world too. A Greek [[papyrus]] fragment, dating from the beginning of the second century AD, includes a fragmented reference to an ancient legal case which is similar to the judgment of Solomon. The writer ascribes the story to Phliliskos of [[Miletos]], living in the fourth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;William Hansen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ezDlXl7gP9oC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA229#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Ariadne's Thread: A Guide to International Tales Found in Classical Literature''], Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2002, pp. 229–30.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[fresco]] found in the "House of the Physician" in [[Pompeii]] depicts [[pygmies]] introducing a scene similar to the biblical story.&lt;ref name="Hansen: fresco"&gt;William Hansen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ezDlXl7gP9oC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA231#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Ariadne's Thread: A Guide to International Tales Found in Classical Literature''], Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2002, pp. 231–32. [http://www.flickriver.com/photos/16472880@N06/2218609158/ A picture of the fresco].&lt;/ref&gt; Some think that the fresco relates directly to the biblical story,&lt;ref&gt;Frederick E. Brenk, "Greek, Greeks; C. Religion", ''Encyclopedia of the Bible and its Reception'', v. 10, 2015, p. 889.&lt;/ref&gt; while according to others it represents a parallel tradition.&lt;ref name="Hansen: fresco" /&gt;

Several suggestions for the genre of the biblical story have been raised, beyond its characterization as a folktale of a known type. [[Edward Lipinski (orientalist)|Edward Lipinski]] suggests that the story is an example of "king's bench tales", a subgenre of the [[wisdom literature]] to which he finds parallels in [[Sumerian literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward Lipinski, "Ancient Types of Wisdom Literature in Biblical Narrative", in Alexander Rofé and Yair Zakovitch (eds.), ''Isac Leo Seeligmann Volume'', Jerusalem: E. Rubenstein, 1983, pp. 51–55&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have pointed out that the story resembles the modern [[Detective fiction|detective story]] genre. Both king Solomon and the reader are confronted with some kind of a juridical-detective riddle. [[Meir Sternberg]] notes that two genres merge in the story: A riddle and a test; The juridical dilemma, which is the riddle, also constitutes a test for the young king: If he will solve it he will be acknowledged to possess divine wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Meir Sternberg, ''The Poetics of Biblical Narrative: Ideological Literature and the Drama of Reading'' (Indiana Studies in Biblical Literature), Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1985, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Stuart Lasine classifies the story as a law-court riddle.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Lasine, "The Riddle of Solomon’s Judgment and the Riddle of Human Nature in the Hebrew Bible", ''Journal for the Study of the Old Testament'' 45 (1989), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Raymond Westbrook]], the story is essentially a hypothetical problem, introduced to the recipient as a pure intellectual challenge and not as a concrete juridical case. In such problems, any unnecessary detail is usually omitted, and this is the reason why the characters in the story have no distinctive characteristics. Also, the description of the case eliminates the possibility to obtain circumstantial evidence, thereby forcing the recipient to confront the dilemma directly and not seek for indirect ways to solve it.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Westbrook, "Law in Kings", in [[André Lemaire]], Baruch Halpern, and Matthew J. Adams (eds.), ''The Book of Kings: Sources, Composition, Historiography and Reception'' (Supplements to Vetus Testamentum 129), Leiden: Brill, 2010, pp. 446–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars think that the original folk story underwent significant literary reworking so that in its biblical crystallization it can no longer be defined as a folktale. Jacob Liver notes the absence of any "local coloring" in the story, and concludes that the story is "not an actual folk tale but a scholarly reworking of a folk tale (apparently from a non-Israelite source) which in some way reached the court circles of Jerusalem in the times of Solomon".&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Liver, "The Book of the Acts of Solomon", ''Biblica'' 48 (1967), p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Jeev Weisman characterizes it as "a [[Wisdom literature|wisdom]] [[anecdote]] which originated in the court circles".&lt;ref&gt;Translation from the Hebrew original: "אנקדוטה חכמתית שמוצאה מחוגי החצר" (Jeev Weisman, ''Political Satire in the Bible'' [The Biblical Encyclopaedia Library 13], Jerusalem: Bialik Institute, 1996, p. 213). George W. Coats also characterizes it as an anecdote ("Parable, Fable, and Anecdote: Storytelling in the Succession Narrative", ''Interpretation'' 35 [1981], p. 379)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The story has a number of parallels in folktales from various cultures. All of the known parallels, among them several from [[India]], have been recorded in later periods than the biblical story; nevertheless, it is unclear as to whether they reflect earlier or later traditions. [[Hermann Gunkel]] rules out the possibility that such a sophisticated motif had developed independently in different places.&lt;ref name="Hermann Gunkel 1987, p. 156"&gt;Hermann Gunkel, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CC_bBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA156#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Folktale in the Old Testament''] (Historic Texts and Interpreters in Biblical Scholarship), translated by Michael D. Rutter, Sheffield, UK: Almond, 1987, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars are of the opinion that the source of the story is untraceable.&lt;ref name="MontgomeryGehman"&gt;James A. Montgomery and Henry Snyder Gehman, [https://archive.org/stream/criticalexegetic10montuoft#page/108/mode/2up ''Kings''] (International Critical Commentary), Edinburgh: T. &amp; T. Clark, 1951, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gwilym H. Jones, ''1 and 2 Kings'' (New Century Bible), I, Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1984, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the biblical version, the two women are identified as prostitutes, as opposed to some Indian versions in which they are widows of one husband. Some scholars have inferred from this difference as to the origin of the story. Following Gressmann,&lt;ref&gt;Hugo Gressmann, [https://archive.org/stream/deutscherundsch130stutuoft#page/218/mode/2up "Das salomonische Urteil"], ''Deutsche Rundschau'' 130 (1907), pp. 218&lt;/ref&gt; Gunkel speculates a possible Indian origin, on the basis that "[s]uch stories of wise judgments are the real life stuff of the Indian people", and that, in his view, "a prostitute has no reason to value a child which was not born to her"; he acknowledges, however, that the Indian versions "belong to a later period".&lt;ref name="Hermann Gunkel 1987, p. 156"/&gt; On the other hand, Lasine opines that the Hebrew story is better motivated than the Indian one, for it is the only one in which the motivation for the behavior of both women is rooted in typical motherly feelings: compassion for the true mother, and jealousy for the impostor.&lt;ref name="Lasine"&gt;Stuart Lasine, "The Riddle of Solomon’s Judgment and the Riddle of Human Nature in the Hebrew Bible", ''Journal for the Study of the Old Testament'' 45 (1989), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars point out that such a travelling folktale might become, in its various forms, more or less coherent; the assertion that one version is more coherent than the other does not compel the conclusion that the first is more original.&lt;ref name="William Hansen 2002, p. 228"/&gt; Consequently, the argument as to which version's women had more compelling reasons to fight over the child would be irrelevant.

==Composition and editorial framing==
The story is considered to be literarily unified, without significant editorial intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. Mulder, ''1 Kings'' (Historical Commentary on the Old Testament), translated by John Vriend, Leuven: Peeters, 1998, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burke O. Long 1984, p. 68"&gt;Burke O. Long, [https://books.google.co.il/books?id=o3Vxhco6ItcC&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''1 Kings''] (Forms of the Old Testament Literature 9), Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1984, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; The ending of the story, noting the wisdom of Solomon, is considered to be a [[Deuteronomist]]ic addition to the text.&lt;ref name="Mordechai Cogan 2001, p. 196"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Volkmar Fritz, ''1 &amp; 2 Kings'' (Continental Commentary), translated by Anselm Hagedorn, Minneapolis: Fortress, 2003, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars consider the story an originally independent unit, integrated into its present context by an editor.&lt;ref&gt;Mordechai Cogan, ''I Kings'' (Anchor Bible), New York: Doubleday, 2001, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simon J. DeVries, ''1 Kings'' (Word Biblical Commentary 12), Waco, TX: Word Books, 1985, pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt; Solomon's name is not mentioned in the story, and he is simply called "the king". Considered out of context, the story leaves the king anonymous just like the other characters. Some scholars think that the original tale was not necessarily about Solomon, and perhaps dealt with a typical unnamed king. A different opinion is held by Eli Yassif, who thinks that the author of the Book of Kings did not attribute the story to Solomon on his own behalf, but the attribution to Solomon had already developed in preliterary tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Yassif, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LbZPv-2LO6YC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Hebrew Folktale: History, Genre, Meaning''] (Folklore Studies in Translation), Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1999, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars point out that the story is linked to the preceding account of Solomon's dream in Gibeon, by the common pattern of prophetic dream and its subsequent fulfillment. Some think this proximity of the stories results from the work of a [[Redaction|redactor]]. Others, such as Saul Zalewski, consider the two accounts to be inseparable and to form a literarily unified unit.&lt;ref&gt;Saul Zalewski, ''Solomon's Ascension to the Throne: Studies in the Books of Kings and Chronicles'', Jerusalem: Y. Marcus, 1981, pp. 188–92 (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

In its broader context, the Judgment of Solomon forms part of the account of Solomon's reign, generally conceived as a distinct segment in the Book of Kings, compassing chapters 3–11 in 1 Kings; Some include in it also chapters 1–2, while others think that these chapters originally ended the account of David's reign in 2 Samuel. According to Liver, the source for the Judgment of Solomon story, as well as other parts of the account of Solomon's reign, is in the speculated book of the [[Acts of Solomon]], which he proposes to be a wisdom work which originated in the court circles shortly after the split of the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|united monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Liver, "The Book of the Acts of Solomon", ''Biblica'' 48 (1967), pp. 75–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==

===General description===
The story may be divided to two parts similar in length, matching the trial's sequence. In the first part (verses 16–22) the case is described: The two women introduce their arguments, and at this point, no response from the king is recorded. In the second part (23–28) the decision is described: the king is the major speaker and the one who directs the plot. Apart from this clear twofold division, suggestions have been raised as to the plot structure and the literary structure of the story and its internal relations.&lt;ref&gt;For the plot structure see the commentaries, and also Bezalel Porten, "The Structure and Theme of the Solomon Narrative (I Kings 3-11)", ''Hebrew Union College Annual'' 38 (1967), pp. 99–100. For the literary structure see Willem A. M. Beuken, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BDlCAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "No Wise King without a Wise Woman (I Kings III 16–28)"], in A.

J. Mulder'' (Oudtestamentische Studiën 25), Leiden: Brill, 1989, pp. 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

As stated before, most of the story is reported by [[direct speech]] of the women and Solomon, with a few sentences and utterance verbs by the narrator. The dialogues move the plot forward.&lt;ref name="Burke O. Long 1984, p. 68"/&gt; The women's contradictory testimonies create the initial conflict necessary to build up the [[dramatic tension]]. The king's request to bring him a sword enhances the tension, as the reader wonders why it is needed. The story comes to its climax with the shocking royal order to cut the boy, which for a moment casts doubt on the king's judgment. But what seems to be the verdict turns out to be a clever trick which achieves its goal, and results in the recognition of the true mother and the resolution.

===Purpose===
The major overt purpose of the account of Solomon's reign, to which the Judgment of Solomon belongs as stated above, is to glorify King Solomon, and his wisdom is one of the account's dominant themes. The exceptions are: The first two chapters (1 Kings 1–2), which according to many scholars portray a dubious image of Solomon, and as stated above, are sometimes ascribed to a separate work; And the last chapter in the account (11), which describes Solomon's sins in his old age. Nevertheless, many scholars point out to elements in the account that criticize Solomon, anticipating his downfall in chapter 11.&lt;ref&gt;See in detail: Daniel J. Hays, "Has the Narrator Come to Praise Solomon or to Bury Him? Narrative Subtlety in 1 Kings 1–11", ''Journal for the Study of the Old Testament'' 28/2 (2003), pp. 149–74; And the literature cited at pp. 151–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its immediate context, the story follows the account of Solomon's dream at [[Gibeon (ancient city)|Gibeon]], in which he was promised by God to be given unprecedented wisdom. Most scholars read the story at face value, and conclude that its major purpose is to demonstrate the fulfillment of the divine promise and to illustrate Solomon's wisdom expressed in a juridical form. Yet some scholars recognize in this story too, as in other parts of the account of Solomon's reign, ironic elements which are not consistent with the story's overt purpose to glorify Solomon.

Some scholars assume, as mentioned, that the story had existed independently before it was integrated into its current context. Willem Beuken think that the original tale was not about the king's wisdom – the concluding note about Solomon's wisdom is considered secondary – but about a woman who, by listening to her motherly instinct, helped the king to break through the legal impasse. Beuken notes additional biblical stories which share the motif of the woman who influenced the king: [[Bathsheba]], the [[woman of Tekoa]], and Solomon's foreign wives who seduced him into idolatry.&lt;ref&gt;Willem A. M. Beuken, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BDlCAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "No Wise King without a Wise Woman (I Kings III 16–28)"], in A. S. van der Woude (ed.), ''New Avenues in the Study of the Old Testament: A Collection of Old Testament Studies, Published on the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Oudtestamentisch Werkgezelschap and the Retirement of Prof. Dr. M. J. Mulder'' (Oudtestamentische Studiën 25), Leiden: Brill, 1989, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Beuken concludes that the true mother exemplifies the biblical character type of the wise woman.&lt;ref&gt;Willem A. M. Beuken, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BDlCAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "No Wise King without a Wise Woman (I Kings III 16–28)"], in A. S. van der Woude (ed.), ''New Avenues in the Study of the Old Testament: A Collection of Old Testament Studies, Published on the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Oudtestamentisch Werkgezelschap and the Retirement of Prof. Dr. M. J. Mulder'' (Oudtestamentische Studiën 25), Leiden: Brill, 1989, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; He proposes an analysis of the literary structure of the story, according to which the section that notes the compassion of the true mother (verse 26b) constitutes one of the two climaxes of the story, along with the section that announces Solomon's divine wisdom (verse 28b). According to this analysis, the story in its current context gives equal weight to the compassion of the true mother and to the godly wisdom that guided Solomon in the trial.&lt;ref&gt;Willem A. M. Beuken, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BDlCAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "No Wise King without a Wise Woman (I Kings III 16–28)"], in A. S. van der Woude (ed.), ''New Avenues in the Study of the Old Testament: A Collection of Old Testament Studies, Published on the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Oudtestamentisch Werkgezelschap and the Retirement of Prof. Dr. M. J. Mulder'' (Oudtestamentische Studiën 25), Leiden: Brill, 1989, pp. 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Marvin A. Sweeney|Marvin Sweeney]], in its original context, as part of the [[Deuteronomistic history]], the story exalted Solomon as a wise ruler and presented him as a model to [[Hezekiah]]. Later, the narrative context of the story has undergone another Deuteronomistic redaction that has undermined Solomon's figure in comparison to [[Josiah]].&lt;ref&gt;Marvin A. Sweeney, [https://books.google.co.il/books?id=d4jn8uj49RIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA82#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''I &amp; II Kings''] (Old Testament Library), Louisville, KY: Westminster John Knox, 2007, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; In its current context, the story implicitly criticizes Solomon for violating the biblical law that sets the [[Priesthood (Ancient Israel)|priests]] and [[Levite]]s on top of the judicial hierarchy (Deuteronomy 17:8–13).&lt;ref&gt;Marvin A. Sweeney, ''I &amp; II Kings'' (Old Testament Library), Louisville, KY: Westminster John Knox, 2007, pp. [https://books.google.co.il/books?id=d4jn8uj49RIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 73], [https://books.google.co.il/books?id=d4jn8uj49RIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA82#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 82].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intra-biblical allusions===
Several stories in the Hebrew Bible bear similarity to the Judgment of Solomon, and scholars think they allude to it.

The most similar story is that of the two cannibal mothers in 2 Kings 6:24–33, which forms part of the [[Elisha]] cycle. The background is a famine in [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]], caused by a siege on the city. As the king passes through the city, a woman calls him and asks him to decide in a quarrel between her and another woman: The two women had agreed to cook and eat the son of one woman, and on the other day to do the same with the son of the other woman; but after they ate the first woman's son, the other woman hid her own son. The king, shocked from the description of the case, tore up his royal cloth and revealed that he was wearing sackcloth beneath it. He blamed Elisha for the circumstances and went on to chase him.

There are some striking similarities between this story and the Judgment of Solomon. Both deal with nameless women who gave birth to a son. One of the son dies, and a quarrel erupts as to the fate of the other one. The case is brought before the king to decide. According to Lasine, the comparison between the stories emphasize the absurdity of the situation in the story of the cannibal mothers: While in the Judgment of Solomon, the king depend on his knowledge of maternal nature to decide the case, the story of the cannibal women describe a "topsy-turvy" world in which maternal nature does not work as expected, thus leaving the king helpless.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Lasine, "Jehoram and the Cannibal Mothers (2 Kings 6.24–33): Solomon’s Judgment in an Inverted World", ''Journal for the Study of the Old Testament'' 50 (1991), pp. 27–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The women's characters===
Like many other women in the Hebrew Bible, the two women in this story are anonymous. Perhaps their names have not been mentioned so that they would not overshadow Solomon's wisdom, which is the main theme of the story. The women seem to be poor. They live alone in a shared residence, without servants. As prostitutes, they lack male patronage and have to take care of themselves in a patriarchal society.&lt;ref&gt;Athalya Brenner, ''The Israelite Woman: Social Role and Literary Type in Biblical Narrative'' (The Biblical Seminar 2), Sheffield, UK: JSOT Press, 1985, pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The women's designation as prostitutes is necessary as background to the plot: It clarifies why the women live alone, gave birth alone and were alone during the alleged switch of the babies;&lt;ref name="Simon J. DeVries 1985, p. 61"&gt;Simon J. DeVries, ''1 Kings'' (Word Biblical Commentary), Waco, TX: Word Books, 1985, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of witnesses seems to create a legal impasse that only the wise king can solve. It also clarifies why the women are not represented by their husbands, as is customary in biblical society.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Ann Bird, "The Harlot as Heroine: Narrative Art and Social Presupposition in Three Old Testament Texts", ''Semeia'' 46 (1989), p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Solomon is depicted as a king accessible to all of his subjects, even those in the margins of society.&lt;ref name="Simon J. DeVries 1985, p. 61"/&gt; The women's designation as prostitutes links the story to the common biblical theme of God as the protector of the weak, "A father to the fatherless, a defender of widows" (Psalms 68:5). Prostitutes in biblical society are considered functional widows, for they have no male patron to represent them in court, and their sons are considered fatherless. They also bear similarity to the [[proselyte]], who is sometimes mentioned in the Hebrew Bible with the widow and the fatherless, in that they are socially marginalized and deprived of the right to advocacy. They can only seek justice from one place: God, embodied in the story as the source of Solomon's wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Carole R. Fontaine, "The Bearing of Wisdom on the Shape of 2 Samuel 11-12 and 1 Kings 3", ''Journal for the Study of the Old Testament'' 34 (1986), pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gina Hens-Piazza, ''Of Methods, Monarchs, and Meanings: A Sociorhetorical Approach to Exegesis'' (Studies in Old Testament Interpretation 3), Macon, GA: Mercer University Press, 1996, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

The women are not explicitly condemned for their occupation,&lt;ref&gt;Mordechai Cogan, ''I Kings'' (Anchor Bible), New York: Doubleday, 2001, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; and some think that the narrator does not intend to discredit them for being prostitutes, and their conduct should be judged against universal human standards.&lt;ref&gt;Volkmar Fritz, ''1 &amp; 2 Kings'' (Continental Commentary), translated by Anselm Hagedorn, Minneapolis: Fortress, 2003, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Phyllis Bird]] thinks that the story presupposes the stereotypical biblical image of the prostitute as a selfish liar. The true mother is revealed when her motherly essence – which is also stereotypical – surpasses her selfish essence.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Ann Bird, "The Harlot as Heroine: Narrative Art and Social Presupposition in Three Old Testament Texts", ''Semeia'' 46 (1989), pp. 132–33&lt;/ref&gt; [[Athalya Brenner]] notes that both women's maternal instinct is intact: For the true mother it is manifested, as mentioned, in the compassion and devotion that she shows for her son; And for the impostor it is manifested in her desire for a son, which makes her steal the other mother's son when her own son dies. According to Brenner, one of the lessons of the story is that "true maternal feelings&amp;nbsp;... may exist even in the bosom of the lowliest woman".&lt;ref&gt;Athalya Brenner, ''The Israelite Woman: Social Role and Literary Type in Biblical Narrative'' (The Biblical Seminar 2), Sheffield, UK: JSOT Press, 1985, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The women are designated in the Hebrew text as ''zōnōṯ'' (זוֹנוֹת), which is the plural form of the adjective ''zōnâ'' (זוֹנָה), prostitute. However, some propose a different meaning for this word in the context of the story, such as "tavern owner" or "innkeeper". These proposals are usually dismissed as apologetic.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: Mordechai Cogan, ''I Kings'' (Anchor Bible), New York: Doubleday, 2001, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; Jerome T. Walsh combines the two meanings, and suggests that in ancient Near East, some prostitutes also provided lodging services (cf. the story of [[Rahab]]).&lt;ref&gt;Jerome T. Walsh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=B7vv5v76kVUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA80#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''1 Kings''] (Berit Olam), Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 1996, p. 80 n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison to detective literature===
As mentioned before, many scholars have compared the story to the modern genre of [[Detective fiction|detective story]]. A striking feature in the biblical story, untypical to its parallels,&lt;ref&gt;William Hansen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ezDlXl7gP9oC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PA229#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Ariadne's Thread: A Guide to International Tales Found in Classical Literature''], Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2002, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; is that it does not begin with a credible report of the [[omniscient narrator]] about the events that took place before the trial; It immediately opens with the women's testimonies. Thus, the reader is unable to determine whether the account given by the plaintiff is true or false, and he confronts, along with Solomon, a juridical-detective riddle. According to Sternberg, the basic convention shared by the Judgment of Solomon and the detective story genre is the "fair-play rule", which states that both the reader and the detective figure are exposed to the same relevant data.&lt;ref&gt;Meir Sternberg, ''The Poetics of Biblical Narrative: Ideological Literature and the Drama of Reading'' (Indiana Studies in Biblical Literature), Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1985, pp. 167–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lasine, dealing with the story from a sociological perspective, points out that like the detective story, the Judgment of Solomon story deals with human "epistemological anxiety" deriving from the fact that man, as opposed to God, is generally unable to know what is in the mind of other men. The detective story, as well as this biblical story, provides a comfort to this anxiety with the figure of the detective, or Solomon in this case: A master of human nature, a man who can see into the depths of one's soul and extract the truth from within it. This capability is conceived as a superhuman quality, inasmuch as Solomon's wisdom in judgment is described as a gift from God. There is an ambiguity concerning the question whether such a capability may serve as a model for others, or it is unavailable to ordinary men.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Lasine, [http://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/1811/58746/HAR_v11_247.pdf?sequence=1 "Solomon, Daniel, and the Detective Story: The Social Function of a Literary Genre"], ''Hebrew Annual Review'' 11 (1987), pp. 247–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the story, Solomon reveals the identity of the true mother. But according to the Hebrew text, while the king solves the riddle, the reader is not exposed to the solution; Literally translated from the Hebrew text, Solomon command reads: "Give her the living child...". One cannot infer from this wording whether the word "her" refers to the plaintiff or to the defendant, as the narrator remains silent on the matter.

==Jewish interpretation==

According to the [[Midrash]], the two women were mother- and daughter-in-law, both of whom had borne sons and whose husbands had died. The lying daughter-in-law was obligated by the laws of [[Yibbum]] to marry her brother-in-law unless released from the arrangement through a formal ceremony. As her brother-in-law was the living child, she was required to marry him when he came of age or wait the same amount of time to be released and remarry. When Solomon suggested splitting the infant in half, the lying woman, wishing to escape the constraints of Yibbum in the eyes of God, agreed. Thus was Solomon able to know who the real mother was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jlaw.com/Commentary/solomon.html|title=Jewish Law – Commentary/Opinion – The Brilliant Wisdom of King Solomon|work=jlaw.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representations in art==
If the above-mentioned [[Pompei|Pompean]] fresco indeed depicts the Judgment of Solomon, it is the first known painting of a biblical story (presently moved to the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum|''Museo Nazionale'' in Naples]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/ancient-cultures/solomon-socrates-and-aristotle/|title=Solomon, Socrates and Aristotle|work=Biblical Archaeology Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This theme has long been a popular subject for artists and is often chosen for the decoration of courthouses. In the Netherlands, many 17th century courthouses (''Vierschaar'' rooms) contain a painting or relief of this scene. Elsewhere in Europe, celebrated examples include:
* Fresco by [[Raphael]]
* The Judgement of Solomon by [[William Blake]]
* Etching by [[Gustave Doré]]
* Woodcut by the school of [[Michael Wolgemut]] in the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]]
* Paintings by [[Andrea Mantegna]], [[Poussin]] and [[Franz Caucig]]
* Relief sculpture on the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]] in Venice by an unknown artist (near the exit into St. Mark's Square)
* Stained glass window by Jean Chastellain in [[St-Gervais-et-St-Protais]] church of Paris

===Other media===
The scene has been the subject of television episodes of ''[[Dinosaurs (TV series)|Dinosaurs]]'', ''[[Recess (TV series)|Recess]]'', ''[[The Simpsons (TV series)|The Simpsons]]'' (where a pie was substituted for the baby), the [[Netflix]] animated series,  [[All Hail King Julien]], where a pineapple is cut in two to settle a dispute, the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode [[The Seven]], and ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]''. It has influenced other artistic disciplines, e.g. [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s play [[The Caucasian Chalk Circle]] and Ronnie snatching Kat's baby in ''[[EastEnders]]''.

The [[HIM (Finnish band)|HIM]] song "Shatter Me With Hope" includes the line "We'll tear this baby apart, wise like Solomon".

=="Splitting the baby"==
The expressions "splitting the baby" or "cutting the baby in half" can be used to describe a split award (usually accompanied by a split costs award) in the most for a heavy-handed, costs-insensitive suit (such as entailing multiple hearings and disproportionate spending on both sides) for a relatively simple compromise.  The analogy reminds litigants to keep their costs down in cases where [[judge]] may well divide fault, i.e. may "split the difference" in terms of [[Damages|damage awards]] or other [[Legal remedy|remedies]] between the two [[Party (law)|parties]] (a very common example is in a [[comparative negligence]] case also known as contributory negligence scenario).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eba-net.org/adrblog/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/splitting-the-baby-article-by-naimark.pdf Stephanie E.

{{Hindu philosophy}}
'''Kundalini''' ([[Sanskrit]]: {{lang|sa|कुण्डलिनी}} ''{{IAST|kuṇḍalinī}}'', {{audio|Kundalini.ogg|pronunciation}}, "coiled one"), in [[Hinduism]] refers to a form of primal [[Energy (esotericism)|energy]] (or ''[[shakti]]'') said to be located at the base of the spine.
In Hindu tradition, [[Bhairavi]] is the goddess of Kundalini.&lt;ref&gt;David Frawley, [https://books.google.com/books?id=T6Vp_rTWkAAC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=Kundalini+%2B+Bhairavi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=j3HjlyPsxS&amp;sig=l2lZzhk8J1DOxdwlr7lzlStllXw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiE0-eKy5HdAhVzCDQIHQzhBvwQ6AEwCnoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Kundalini%20%2B%20Bhairavi&amp;f=false Inner Tantric Yoga], Lotus Press, 2008,  page 163-164&lt;/ref&gt; Kundalini awakenings may happen through a variety of methods.  Many systems of yoga focus on awakening Kundalini through: [[meditation]]; [[pranayama]] breathing; the practice of [[asana]] and chanting of [[mantra]]s.&lt;ref name="YJ Spotlight"&gt;{{cite web|title=Spotlight on Kundalini Yoga|url=http://www.yogajournal.com/basics/1336|publisher=Yoga Journal|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kundalini Yoga]] is a school of yoga that is influenced by [[Shaktism]] and [[Tantra]] schools of [[Hinduism]]. It derives its name through a focus on awakening kundalini energy through regular practice of [[Mantra]], [[Tantra]], [[Yantra]], [[Yoga]]
or [[Meditation]].&lt;ref name="YJ Spotlight" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Swami Sivananda Radha 2004, pp 13-15"&gt;Swami Sivananda Radha,  2004, pp. 13, 15&lt;/ref&gt;
The Kundalini experience is frequently reported to be a distinct feeling of electric current running along the spine.&lt;ref name="Sarawati"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saraswati|first1=Swami Satyananda|title=Kundalini Tantra|date=1984|publisher=Bihar School of Yoga|location=Munger, Bihar, India|isbn=978-8185787152|pages=34–36|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Judith|first1=Anodea|title=Eastern Body, Western Mind: Psychology and the Chakra System as a Path to the Self|date=2004|publisher=Celestial Arts|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=978-1-58761-225-1|pages=451–454|edition=Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paulson|first1=Genevieve Lewis|title=Kundalini and the Chakras: A Practical Manual--evolution in this Lifetime|date=1998|publisher=Llewellyn Publications|location=St. Paul, Minnesota|isbn=978-0-87542-592-4|pages=7–10, 194|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The concept of Kundalini is mentioned in the [[Upanishads]] (9h century BCE – 3rd century BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dale|first1=Cyndi|title=Kundalini: Divine Energy, Divine Life |date=2011|publisher=Llewellyn Publications|location=Woodbury, Minnesota|isbn=978-0-7387-2863-6|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{check|date=July 2015}} The Sanskrit adjective ''{{IAST|kuṇḍalin}}'' means "circular, annular". It is mentioned as a noun for "snake" (in the sense "coiled", as in "forming ringlets") in the 12th-century ''[[Rajatarangini]]'' chronicle (I.2). ''{{IAST|Kuṇḍa}}'' (a noun meaning "bowl, water-pot" is found as the name of a [[Nāga|Naga]] in [[Mahabharata]] 1.4828). The 8th-century ''Tantrasadbhava Tantra'' uses the term ''kundalī'' ("ring, bracelet; coil (of a rope)").&lt;ref name="White"&gt;{{cite book|last1=White|first1=David Gordon|title=Kiss of the Yogini: "Tantric Sex" in its South Asian Contexts|date=2004|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-89483-6|edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|230}}{{clarify|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--cite the verse. the word does not appear in online translations of this text--&gt;

The use of ''kuṇḍalī'' as a name for Goddess [[Durga]] (a form of [[Shakti]]) appears often in [[Tantrism]] and [[Shaktism]] from as early as the 11th century in the ''Śaradatilaka''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saivism|first1=Kashmir Saivism|title=Vac: The Concept of the Word in Selected Hindu Tantras|date=1990|publisher=Sri Satguru Publications|isbn=978-1-4384-1532-1|pages=124–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was adopted as a technical term in [[Hatha yoga]] during the 15th century, and became widely used in the [[Yoga Upanishad]]s by the 16th century. [[Eknath Easwaran]] has paraphrased the term as "the coiled power", a force which ordinarily rests at the base of the spine, described as being "coiled there like a serpent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morrison|first1=Diana|title=A Glossary of Sanskrit from the Spiritual Tradition of India|date=1977|publisher=Nilgiri Press|location=Petaluma, California|isbn=978-0-915132-11-9|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Descriptions ==
{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2018}}
When awakened, Kundalini is said to rise up from the [[muladhara]] [[chakra]], through the central [[nadis|nadi]] (called ''[[sushumna]]'') inside or alongside the spine reaching the top of the head. The progress of Kundalini through the different [[chakra]]s is believed to achieve different levels of awakening and a [[mystical experience]], until Kundalini finally reaches the top of the head, [[Sahasrara]] or crown [[chakra]], producing an extremely profound transformation of consciousness.&lt;ref name="Sarawati" /&gt;{{rp|5–6}} Energy is said to accumulate in the [[muladhara]], and the [[yogi]] seeks to send it up to the brain transforming it into 'Ojas', the highest form of energy.

There are many physical effects that some people believe to be a sign of a Kundalini awakening; however, there are also others who contend that the undesirable side effects are not Kundalini but chakra awakening.&lt;ref name="Maheshwaranada"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maheshwarananda|first1=Paramhans Swami|authorlink=Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda|title=The Hidden Power in Humans: Chakras and Kundalini|date=2004|publisher=Ibera Verlag|location=|isbn=978-3-85052-197-0|pages=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following are either common signs of an awakened Kundalini or symptoms of a problem associated with an awakening Kundalini:

* Enlightenment
* Bliss, feelings of infinite love and universal connectivity, transcendent awareness, seeing truth (third eye opening), euphoria
* Awakened sense of smell, hearing, taste
* No longer controlled by desire/cravings
* Sound heard in the pineal gland (pleasurable/enjoyable)
* Change in the thyroid, sudden ability to sing in perfect pitch, change in voice
* Change in the sex organs
* Change in breathing
* Energy rushes or feelings of electricity circulating the body. This tingly feeling, at first, might be mistaken for a "shiver."
* Involuntary jerks, tremors, shaking, itching, tingling, and crawling sensations, especially in the arms and legs
* Intense heat (sweating) or cold, especially as energy is experienced passing through the [[chakra]]s
* Spontaneous [[pranayama]], [[asana]]s, [[mudra]]s and [[Bandha (Yoga)|bandhas]]
* Visions or sounds at times associated with a particular chakra
* Diminished or control over sexual desire
* Emotional upheavals or surfacing of unwanted and repressed feelings or thoughts with certain repressed emotions becoming dominant in the conscious mind for short or long periods of time.&lt;ref name="Eastman" /&gt;
* Headache, migraine, or pressure inside the skull. Relief of this pressure during an awakening may be felt as a "popping," depending on the person and their body at the time the awakening begins to occur.{{cn|date=August 2018}}
* Pains in different areas of the body, especially back and neck
* Sensitivity to light, sound, and touch
* Trance-like and altered states of consciousness
* Disrupted sleep pattern (periods of insomnia or oversleeping)
* Vegetarianism or veganism
* Change in body odor (sweetness/natural/healthy)

In his article on Kundalini in the ''Yoga Journal'', David Eastman narrates two personal experiences. One man said that he felt an activity at the base of his spine starting to flow, so he relaxed and allowed it to happen. A feeling of surging energy began traveling up his back. At each chakra, he felt an orgasmic electric feeling like every nerve trunk on his spine beginning to fire. A second man describes a similar experience but accompanied by a wave of euphoria and happiness softly permeating his being. He described the surging energy as being like electricity but hot, traveling from the base of his spine to the top of his head. He said the more he analyzed the experience, the less it occurred.&lt;ref name="Eastman"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eastman |first=David T. |title=Kundalini Demystified |journal=Yoga Journal |date=September 1985 |pages=37–43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Building a Noble Worl''d, [[Shiv R. Jhawar]] describes his '''Kundalini awakening''' experience at Muktananda's public program at Lake Point Tower in Chicago on September 16, 1974, as follows:

"Baba [Swami Muktananda] had just begun delivering his discourse with his opening statement: 'Today's subject is meditation. The crux of the question is: What do we meditate upon?' Continuing his talk, Baba said: 'Kundalini starts dancing when one repeats Om Namah Shivaya.' Hearing this, I mentally repeated the mantra. I noticed that my breathing was getting heavier. Suddenly, I felt a great impact of a rising force within me. The intensity of this rising kundalini force was so tremendous that my body lifted up a little and fell flat into the aisle; my eyeglasses flew off. As I lay there with my eyes closed, I could see a continuous fountain of dazzling white lights erupting within me. In brilliance, these lights were brighter than the sun but possessed no heat at all. I was experiencing the thought-free state of "I am," realizing that "I" have always been, and will continue to be, eternal. I was fully conscious and completely aware while I was experiencing the pure "I am," a state of supreme bliss. Outwardly, at that precise moment, Baba delightfully shouted from his platform...''mene kuch nahi kiya; kisiko shakti ne pakda'' (I didn't do anything. The Energy has caught someone.)' Baba noticed that the dramatic awakening of kundalini in me frightened some people in the audience. Therefore, he said, 'Do not be frightened. Sometimes kundalini gets awakened in this way, depending upon a person's type.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jhawar|first1=Shiv R.|title=Building a Noble World|date=2004|publisher=Noble World Foundation|isbn=978-0-9749197-0-6|page=85|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kundalini experiences ==

=== Invoking Kundalini experiences ===
Several yogis consider that Kundalini can be awakened by ''[[shaktipat]]'' (spiritual transmission by a Guru or teacher), or by spiritual practices such as yoga or meditation.

There are two broad approaches to Kundalini awakening: active and passive. The ''active approach'' involves systematic physical exercises and techniques of concentration, visualization, [[pranayama]] (breath practice) and meditation under the guidance of a competent teacher. These techniques come from any of the four main branches of yoga, and some forms of yoga, such as [[Kriya yoga]], [[Kundalini yoga]] and [[Sahaja yoga]].

The ''passive approach'' is instead a path of surrender where one lets go of all the impediments to the awakening rather than trying to actively awaken Kundalini. A chief part of the passive approach is [[shaktipat]] where one individual's Kundalini is awakened by another who already has the experience. Shaktipat only raises Kundalini temporarily but gives the student an experience to use as a basis.&lt;ref name="Eastman" /&gt;

[[Gopi Krishna (yogi)|Gopi Krishna]] reports having experienced his first kundalini awakening at age 34. In his book ''Kundalini: Questions and Answers'' he writes that while meditating upon a lotus in full bloom his attention was drawn towards the crown of his head. He began to experience a sensation of light as if it was entering his brain which was at first distracting but soon began to acquire an enrapturing condition. He felt it "like liquid light through all my nervous system, in my stomach, in my heart, in my lungs, in my throat, in my head, and taking control of the whole body. That was a most marvelous experience for me, as if a new life energy had now taken possession of my body."{{fact|date=May 2018}}

He subsequently came to believe "As the ancient writers have said, it is the vital force or [[prana]] which is spread over both the macrocosm, the entire Universe, and the microcosm, the human body... The atom is contained in both of these. Prana is life-energy responsible for the phenomena of terrestrial life and for life on other planets in the universe. Prana in its universal aspect is immaterial. But in the human body, Prana creates a fine biochemical substance which works in the whole organism and is the main agent of activity in the nervous system and in the brain. The brain is alive only because of Prana...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krishna|first1=Gopti|title=Kundalini Questions and Answers|date=1995|publisher=The Institute for Consciousness Studies|isbn=978-0-9938316-6-9|pages=6–8|edition=Smashwords}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quotation|...The most important psychological changes in the character of an enlightened person would be that he or she would be compassionate and more detached. There would be less ego, without any tendency toward violence or aggression or falsehood. The awakened life energy is the mother of morality, because all morality springs from this awakened energy. Since the very beginning, it has been this evolutionary energy that has created the concept of morals in human beings.}}

American [[comparative religions]] scholar [[Joseph Campbell]] describes the concept of Kundalini as "the figure of a coiled female serpent—a serpent goddess not of "gross" but "subtle" substance—which is to be thought of as residing in a torpid, slumbering state in a subtle center, the first of the seven, near the base of the spine: the aim of the yoga then being to rouse this serpent, lift her head, and bring her up a subtle nerve or channel of the spine to the so-called "thousand-petaled lotus" ([[Sahasrara]]) at the crown of the head...She, rising from the lowest to the highest lotus center will pass through and wake the five between, and with each waking, the psychology and personality of the practitioner will be altogether and fundamentally transformed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Joseph|title=A Joseph Campbell Companion: Reflections on the Art of Living|date=2011|publisher=Joseph Campbell Foundation|location=San Anselmo, California|isbn=978-1-61178-006-2|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hatha yoga ====
According to the [[hatha yoga]] text, the ''Goraksasataka'', or "Hundred Verses of Goraksa", certain hatha yoga practices including [[mula bandha]], uddiyana bandha, [[Jalandhara Bandha|jalandhara bandha]] and [[kumbhaka]] can awaken Kundalini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=White|first1=David Gordon|title=Yoga in Practice|date=2012|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-691-14085-8|pages=2, 268–270}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another hathayoga text, the ''Khecarīvidyā'', states that [[kechari mudra]] enables one to raise Kundalini and access various stores of [[amrita]] in the head, which subsequently flood the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mallinson|first1=James|title=The Khecarividya of Adinatha: A Critical Edition and Annotated Translation of an Early Text of Hathayoga|date=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-39115-3|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Shaktipat ====
The spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] emphasized the need for a master when actively trying to awaken Kundalini:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Kundalini is a latent power in the higher body. When awakened, it pierces through six chakras or functional centers and activates them. Without a master, the awakening of the kundalini cannot take anyone very far on the Path; and such indiscriminate or premature awakening is fraught with dangers of self-deception as well as the misuse of powers. The kundalini enables man to consciously cross the lower planes and it ultimately merges into the universal cosmic power of which it is a part, and which also is at times described as kundalini&amp;nbsp;... The important point is that the awakened kundalini is helpful only up to a certain degree, after which it cannot ensure further progress. It cannot dispense with the need for the grace of a Perfect Master.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baba|first1=Meher|authorlink=Meher Baba|title=Beams from Meher Baba on the Spiritual Panorama|date=1958|publisher=Sufism Reoriented|location=San Francisco|pages=13–14|url=http://ambppct.org/Book_Files/Beams.pdf|accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Kundalini awakening while prepared or unprepared ===
The experience of Kundalini awakening can happen when one is either prepared or unprepared.&lt;ref name="Eastman" /&gt;

==== Preparedness ====
According to Hindu tradition, in order to be able to integrate this spiritual energy, a period of careful purification and strengthening of the body and nervous system is usually required beforehand.&lt;ref name="Maheshwaranada" /&gt; Yoga and [[Tantra]] propose that Kundalini can be awakened by a [[guru]] (teacher), but body and spirit must be prepared by yogic austerities, such as [[pranayama]], or breath control, physical exercises, visualization, and chanting. The student is advised to follow the path in an open-hearted manner.&lt;ref name="Eastman" /&gt;

Traditionally, people would visit ashrams in India to awaken their dormant kundalini energy. Typical activities would include regular meditation, mantra chanting, spiritual studies as well as a physical asana practice such as [[kundalini yoga]].

==== Spontaneously ====
The Kundalini always awakens spontaneously when the person least expects it. Whether prepared or unprepared, the kundalini rises despite any attempt to stop it by the sadhak.

== Religious interpretations ==

=== Indian interpretations ===
Kundalini is considered to occur in the [[chakra]] and [[Nadi (yoga)|nadis]] of the [[subtle body]]. Each chakra is said to contain special characteristics&lt;ref name="Scotton"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scotton|first1=Bruce W.|title=Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology|date=1999|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-465-09530-8|page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with proper training, moving Kundalini through these chakras can help express or open these characteristics.

Kundalini is described as a sleeping, dormant potential force in the human organism.&lt;ref&gt;Swami Satyananda Saraswati. Kundalini Tantra.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=October 2017}} It is one of the components of an esoteric description of the "[[subtle body]]", which consists of [[nadis]] (energy channels), [[chakras]] (psychic centres), [[prana]] (subtle energy), and [[bindu (symbol)|bindu]] (drops of essence).

Kundalini is described as being coiled up at the base of the spine. The description of the location can vary slightly, from the rectum to the navel.&lt;ref name="White" /&gt;{{rp|229–231}} Kundalini is said to reside in the triangular shaped [[sacrum]] bone in three and a half coils.&lt;ref name="Srivastava" /&gt;

[[Ramana Maharshi]] mentioned that Kundalini is nothing but the natural energy of the Self, where Self is the universal consciousness ([[Paramatma]]) present in every being and that the individual mind of thoughts cloaks this natural energy from unadulterated expression. [[Advaita]] teaches [[self-realization]], [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], [[Higher consciousness|God-consciousness]], and [[nirvana]]. But initial Kundalini awakening is just the beginning of the actual spiritual experience. Self-inquiry meditation is considered a very natural and simple means of reaching this goal.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

[[Swami Vivekananda]] describes Kundalini briefly in his book ''Raja Yoga'' as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vivekananda|first1=Swami|title=Raja Yoga: Conquering the Internal Nature|date=1995|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|location=Calcutta|isbn=978-8185301167|pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to the [[Yogi]]s, there are two nerve currents in the spinal column, called Pingalâ and Idâ, and a hollow canal called [[Susumna|Sushumnâ]] running through the spinal cord. At the lower end of the hollow canal is what the Yogis call the "Lotus of the Kundalini". They describe it as triangular in a form in which, in the symbolical language of the Yogis, there is a power called the Kundalini, coiled up. When that Kundalini awakens, it tries to force a passage through this hollow canal, and as it rises step by step, as it were, layer after layer of the mind becomes open and all the different visions and wonderful powers come to the Yogi. When it reaches the brain, the Yogi is perfectly detached from the body and mind; the soul finds itself free. We know that the spinal cord is composed in a peculiar manner. If we take the figure eight horizontally (∞), there are two parts which are connected in the middle. Suppose you add eight after eight, piled one on top of the other, that will represent the spinal cord. The left is the Ida, the right Pingala, and that hollow canal which runs through the center of the spinal cord is the Sushumna. Where the spinal cord ends in some of the [[lumbar vertebrae]], a fine fiber issues downwards, and the canal runs up even within that fiber, only much finer. The canal is closed at the lower end, which is situated near what is called the sacral plexus, which, according to modern physiology, is triangular in form. The different plexuses that have their centers in the spinal canal can very well stand for the different "lotuses" of the Yogi.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When Kundalini [[Shakti]] is conceived as a goddess, then, when it rises to the head, it unites itself with the Supreme Being of ([[Lord Shiva]]). The aspirant then becomes engrossed in deep meditation and infinite bliss. [[Paramahansa Yogananda]] in his book ''[[Bhagavad Gita (Yogananda)|God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita]]'' states:&lt;ref name="Yogananda"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yogananda|first1=Paramahansa|title=The Bhagavad Gita: God Talks with Arjuna: Royal Science of God Realization: the Immortal Dialogue Between Soul and Spirit: a New Translation and Commentary|date=1995|publisher=Self Realization Fellowship|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-0-87612-030-9|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2017}}

{{quote|At the command of the yogi in deep meditation, this creative force turns inward and flows back to its source in the thousand-petaled lotus, revealing the resplendent inner world of the divine forces and consciousness of the soul and spirit. Yoga refers to this power flowing from the coccyx to spirit as the awakened kundalini.}}

Paramahansa Yogananda also states:
{{quote|The yogi reverses the searchlights of intelligence, mind and life force inward through a secret astral passage, the coiled way of the kundalini in the coccygeal plexus, and upward through the sacral, the lumbar, and the higher dorsal, cervical, and medullary plexuses, and the spiritual eye at the point between the eyebrows, to reveal finally the soul's presence in the highest center (Sahasrara) in the brain.&lt;ref name="Yogananda" /&gt;{{rp|18, 1093}}}}

== Western significance ==
[[Sir John Woodroffe]] (1865–1936) – also known by his pseudonym Arthur Avalon – was a British Orientalist whose published works stimulated a far-reaching interest in [[Hindu philosophy]] and [[Yogic]] practices. While serving as a High Court Judge in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], he studied [[Sanskrit]] and [[Hindu Philosophy]], particularly as it related to Hindu [[Tantra]]. He translated numerous original [[Sanskrit]] texts and lectured on [[Indian Philosophy]], Yoga and Tantra. His book, ''The Serpent Power: The Secrets of Tantric and Shaktic Yoga'' became a major source for many modern Western adaptations of [[Kundalini yoga]] practice. It presents an academically and philosophically sophisticated translation of, and commentary on, two key Eastern texts: ''Shatchakranirūpana'' (Description and Investigation into the Six Bodily Centers) written by Tantrik Pūrnānanda Svāmī (1526) and the ''Paduka-Pancakā'' from the Sanskrit of a commentary by Kālīcharana (Five-fold Footstool of the Guru). The Sanskrit term "Kundali Shakti" translates as "Serpent Power". Kundalini is thought to be an energy released within an individual using specific meditation techniques. It is represented symbolically as a serpent coiled at the base of the spine.

In his preface to ''The Serpent Power'' Woodroffe clarifies the concept of Kundalini:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woodroffe|first1=Sir John|title=The Serpent Power|date=1950|publisher=Ganesh &amp; Co. (MADRAS) LTD. The Theosophical Society|location=AdyarMadras|page=Preface|edition=Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|Vivified by the “Serpent Fire”( Kundalini) they (chakras) become gates of connection between the physical and “astral” bodies. When the astral awakening of these centers first took place, this was not known to the physical consciousness. But the sense body can now “be brought to share all these advantages by repeating that process of awakening with the etheric centers. This is done by the arousing through will-force of the “Serpent Fire,” which exists clothed in “etheric matter in the physical plane, and sleeps  in the corresponding etheric center—that at the base of the spine. When this is done, it vivifies the higher centers, with the effect that it brings into the physical consciousness the powers which are aroused by the development  of their corresponding astral centers. . . There mere rousing of the Serpent Power does not, from the spiritual Yoga standpoint, amount too much. Nothing, however, of real moment, from the higher Yogi’s point of view, is achieved until the Ajna Cakra is reached. Here, again, it is said that the Sadhaka whose Atma is nothing but a meditation on the lotus “becomes the creator, preserver and destroyer of the three worlds”…It is not until the Tattvas of this center are also absorbed, and complete knowledge of the Sahasrara is gained, that the Yogi attains that which is both his aim and the motive of his labor, cessation from rebirth which follows on the control and concentration of the Citta on the Siva-sthanam, the Abode of Bliss.}}

In his book Artistic Form and Yoga in the Sacred Images of India, [[Heinrich Zimmer]] spoke highly of Woodroffe's works:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zimmer|first1=Heinrich|title=Artistic Form and Yoga in the Sacred Images of India|date=1984|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-691-02060-0|page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The values of the Hindu tradition were disclosed to me through the enormous life-work of Sir John Woodroffe, alias Arthur Avalon, a pioneer and a classic author in Indie studies, second to none, who, for the first time, by many publications and books made available the extensive and complex treasure of late [[Hindu]] tradition: the [[Tantras]], a period as grand and rich as the [[Vedas]], the Epic, [[Puranas]], etc.; the latest crystallization of Indian wisdom, the indispensable closing link of a chain, affording keys to countless problems in the history of [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]], in mythology and symbolism.}}

When Woodroffe later commented upon the reception of his work he clarified his objective, "All the world (I speak of course of those interested in such subjects) is beginning to speak of Kundalinî Shakti." He described his intention as follows: "We, who are foreigners, must place ourselves in the skin of the [[Hindu]], and must look at their doctrine and ritual through their eyes and not our own."&lt;ref name="Jung"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jung|first1=Carl Gustav|authorlink=Carl Jung|title=The Psychology of Kundalini Yoga: Notes of the Seminar Given in 1932 by C.G. Jung|date=1996|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-691-02127-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xvi}}

Western awareness of kundalini was strengthened by the interest of Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst Dr. [[Carl Jung]] (1875–1961). Jung's seminar on Kundalini yoga presented to the Psychological Club in Zurich in 1932 was widely regarded as a milestone in the psychological understanding of [[Eastern thought]] and of the symbolic transformations of inner experience. [[Kundalini yoga]] presented Jung with a model for the developmental phases of [[higher consciousness]], and he interpreted its symbols in terms of the process of individuation, with sensitivity towards a new generation's interest in alternative religions and psychological exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nichol|first1=David|title=Psychoanalytic Books:|journal=A Quarterly Journal of Reviews|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the introduction to Jung's book ''The Psychology of Kundalini Yoga'', [[Sonu Shamdasani]] puts forth "The emergence of depth psychology was historically paralleled by the translation and widespread dissemination of the texts of yoga... for the depth psychologies sought to liberate themselves from the stultifying limitations of Western thought to develop maps of inner experience grounded in the transformative potential of therapeutic practices. A similar alignment of "theory" and "practice" seemed to be embodied in the yogic texts that moreover had developed independently of the bindings of Western thought. Further, the initiatory structure adopted by institutions of psychotherapy brought its social organization into proximity with that of yoga. Hence, an opportunity for a new form of comparative psychology opened up."&lt;ref name="Jung" /&gt;{{rp|xviii-xix}}

The American writer William Buhlman, began to conduct an international survey of out-of-body experiences in 1969 in order to gather information about symptoms: sounds, vibrations and other phenomena, that commonly occur at the time of the OBE event.  His primary interest was to compare the findings with reports made by yogis, such as [[Gopi Krishna (yogi)]] who have made reference to similar phenomenon, such as the 'vibrational state' as components of their kundalini-related [[spiritual experience]]. He explains:
{{Quotation| There are numerous reports of full Kundalini experiences culminating with a transcendental out-of-body state of consciousness. In fact, many people consider this experience to be the ultimate path to enlightenment. The basic premise is to encourage the flow of Kundalini energy up the spine and toward the top of the head—the [[crown chakra]]—thus projecting your awareness into the higher heavenly dimensions of the universe. The result is an indescribable expansion of consciousness into spiritual realms beyond form and thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buhlman|first1=William|title=The Secret of the Soul: Using Out-of-Body Experiences to Understand Our True Nature|date=2011|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0-06-196808-2|page=191|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

George King (1919–1997), founder of the [[Aetherius Society]], describes the concept of Kundalini throughout his works and claimed to have experienced this energy many times throughout his life while in a "positive samadhic yogic trance state".{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theninefreedoms.org/dr-george-king.html|title=Dr. George King – The Nine Freedoms 50th Anniversary|website=theninefreedoms.org|access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to King,
&lt;blockquote&gt;It should always be remembered that despite appearances to the contrary, the complete control of Kundalini through the spinal column is man's only reason for being on Earth, for when this is accomplished, the lessons in this classroom and the mystical examination is passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=King|first1=George|title=The Nine Freedoms: An authoritative Metaphysical treatise on the progress through Ascension to Cosmic Existence|date=1998|publisher=Aetherius Society|isbn=978-0-937249-04-8|page=79|edition=3rd|url=http://www.aetherius.org/index.cfm?app=content&amp;SectionID=67&amp;PageID=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his lecture entitled ''The Psychic Centers&amp;nbsp;– Their Significance and Development'', he describes the theory behind the raising of Kundalini and how this might be done safely in the context of a balanced life devoted to selfless service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=King|first=George|title=The Psychic Centers&amp;nbsp;– Their Significance and Development|url=http://www.aetherius.org/index.cfm?app=content&amp;SectionID=155&amp;PageID=466|website=audio lecture|publisher=aetherius.org|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sri Aurobindo]] was the other great authority scholar on Kundalini parallel to Woodroffe with a somewhat different viewpoint, according to Mary Scott (who is herself a latter-day scholar on Kundalini and its physical basis) and was a member of the Theosophical Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scott|first1=Mary|title=Kundalini in the Physical World|date=1983|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|location=London|isbn=978-0-7100-9417-9|pages=259–263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other well-known spiritual teachers who have made use of the idea of Kundalini include [[Aleister Crowley]], whose [[Gnostic Mass]] symbolically incorporates the concept via various means including the entrance procession ('circumambulation') of the Priest and Priestess; [[Albert Rudolph]] (Rudi), [[Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh]] (Osho), [[George Gurdjieff]], [[Paramahansa Yogananda]], [[Sivananda Radha Saraswati]], who produced an English language guide to [[Kundalini yoga]] methods, [[Muktananda]], [[Bhagawan Nityananda]], [[Yogi Bhajan]], [[Nirmala Srivastava]], [[Samael Aun Weor]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

=== New Age ===
Kundalini references may be found in a number of [[New Age]] presentations, and is a word that has been adopted by many [[new religious movements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Yoga Journal|date=July–August 1985|issue=63|page=42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a-sDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=Stuart+Slovatsky#v=onepage&amp;q=Stuart%20Sovatsky&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 January 2017|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|language=en|issn=0191-0965|quote=I just wanted to talk to someone who would understand about kundalini and wouldn't think I was crazy&amp;nbsp;...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Carl Jung]] "...&amp;nbsp;the concept of Kundalini has for us only one use, that is, to describe our own experiences with the unconscious&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hayman|first1=Ronald|title=A Life of Jung|date=2001|publisher=W.

He cautioned that all forms of yoga, when used by Westerners, can be attempts at domination of the body and unconscious through the ideal of ascending into higher chakras.&lt;ref name="Shamdasani"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shamdasani|first1=Sonu|title=The Psychology of Kundalini Yoga: Notes of the Seminar Given in 1932 by C.G.

According to Shamdasani, Jung claimed that the symbolism of Kundalini yoga suggested that the bizarre symptomatology that patients at times presented, actually resulted from the awakening of the Kundalini. He argued that knowledge of such symbolism enabled much that would otherwise be seen as the meaningless by-products of a disease process to be understood as meaningful symbolic processes, and explicated the often peculiar physical localizations of symptoms.&lt;ref name="Shamdasani" /&gt;{{rp|xxvi}}

Recently, there has been a growing interest within the medical community to study the physiological effects of [[meditation]], and some of these studies have applied the discipline of Kundalini yoga to their clinical settings.&lt;ref&gt;Lazar et al. (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;Cromie (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The popularization of eastern spiritual practices has been associated with psychological problems in the west. Psychiatric literature notes that "since the influx of eastern spiritual practices and the rising popularity of meditation starting in the 1960s, many people have experienced a variety of psychological difficulties, either while engaged in intensive spiritual practice or spontaneously".&lt;ref name="Turner"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turner|first1=R.

The differentiation between spiritual emergency associated with Kundalini awakening may be viewed as an acute [[psychotic episode]] by psychiatrists who are not conversant with the culture. The biological changes of increased P300 amplitudes that occurs with certain yogic practices may lead to acute psychosis. Biological alterations by Yogic techniques may be used to warn people against such reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bharadwaj|first1=Balaji|title=Proof-of-concept studies in Yoga and mental health|journal=International Journal of Yoga|date=2012|volume=5|issue=1|page=74|doi=10.4103/0973-6131.91719|url=http://www.ijoy.org.in/article.asp?issn=0973-6131;year=2012;volume=5;issue=1;spage=74;epage=74;aulast=Bharadwaj|accessdate=5 January 2017|issn=0973-6131|pmc=3276938|pmid=22346071}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1479">A '''landscape evolution model''' is a physically based [[numerical model]] that simulates changing terrain over the course of time. This can be due to [[glacier|glacial]] erosion and deposition; [[erosion]], [[sediment transport]], and [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] in [[fluvial]] systems such as [[river]]s; [[Soil production function|regolith production]]; the movement of material on [[hill]]slopes; more intermittent events such as [[rockfall]]s, [[debris flow]]s, [[landslide]]s, and other surface processes. This can also be due to surface [[uplift (geology)|uplift]] and/or [[subsidence]]. A typical landscape evolution model takes many of these factors into account.

Landscape evolution models are used primarily in the field of [[geomorphology]]. As they improve, they are beginning to be consulted by [[land management|land managers]] to aid in decision making.

The earliest of these models were developed in the 1970s. In these models, water was run across a mesh, and cell elevations were changed in response to calculated [[water erosion|erosion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/hyp.426|title=Landscape evolution models: a software review|year=2001|last1=Coulthard|first1=T.

[[Linguistic rights]] in Africa are stated in [[constitution]]s which differ by country. These constitutions usually state the [[national language]](s) and/or [[official language]](s), and may or may not explicitly allow for other languages in the country. Most of the linguistic rights stated here are negative rights, which grant freedom of usage of own language and prevent discrimination based on language.

==Linguistic rights in African constitutions==

[[File:M-T-Cicero.jpg|thumb|[[Cicero]] discussed the method of loci in his ''[[De Oratore]]''.]]
The '''method of loci''' (''loci'' being Latin for "places") is a method of memory enhancement which uses visualizations with the use of spatial memory, familiar information about one's environment, to quickly and efficiently recall information. The method of loci is also known as the '''memory journey''', '''memory palace''', or '''mind palace technique'''. This method is a [[mnemonic]] device  adopted in [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] and [[ancient Greece|Greek]] rhetorical treatises (in the anonymous ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'', [[Cicero]]'s ''[[De Oratore]]'', and [[Quintilian]]'s ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]''). Many [[Memory sport|memory contest]] champions claim to use this technique to recall faces, digits, and lists of words.

The term is most often found in specialised works on [[psychology]], [[neurobiology]], and [[memory]], though it was used in the same general way at least as early as the first half of the nineteenth century in works on [[rhetoric]], [[logic]], and [[philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in a discussion of "topical memory" (yet another designator) Jamieson mentions that "memorial lines, or verses, are more useful than the method of loci." [[Alexander Jamieson]], ''A Grammar of Logic and Intellectual Philosophy'', A. H. Maltby, 1835, p112&lt;/ref&gt; [[John O'Keefe (neuroscientist)|John O'Keefe]] and [[Lynn Nadel]] refer to:&lt;blockquote&gt;'the method of loci', an imaginal technique known to the ancient Greeks and Romans and described by [[Frances Yates|Yates]] (1966) in her book ''[[The Art of Memory]]'' as well as by [[Alexander Luria|Luria]] (1969). In this technique the subject memorizes the layout of some building, or the arrangement of shops on a street, or any geographical entity which is composed of a number of discrete loci. When desiring to remember a set of items the subject 'walks' through these loci in their imagination and commits an item to each one by forming an image between the item and any feature of that locus. Retrieval of items is achieved by 'walking' through the loci, allowing the latter to activate the desired items. The efficacy of this technique has been well established (Ross and Lawrence 1968, Crovitz 1969, 1971, Briggs, Hawkins and Crovitz 1970, Lea 1975), as is the minimal interference seen with its use.&lt;ref name="cognitivemap"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = O'Keefe| first1 =John |last2 = Nadel |first2 =Lynn| authorlink2 = Lynn Nadel  | title =The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map'| publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]| date = December 7, 1978| location = Oxford|url =http://www.cognitivemap.net | isbn = 978-0198572060}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The items to be remembered in this mnemonic system are mentally associated with specific physical locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Neil R.|title=Psychology the science of behaviour|year=2010|publisher=Pearson Canada Inc.|isbn=9780205645244|pages=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The method relies on memorized spatial relationships to establish order and recollect memorial content. It is also known as the "Journey Method", used for storing lists of related items, or the "Roman Room" technique, which is most effective for storing unrelated information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Roman Room Technique| work = AcademicTips.org| url =http://www.academictips.org/memory/romanrom.html| accessdate =October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary usage==
Many effective memorisers today use the "method of loci" to some degree. Contemporary memory competition, in particular the [[World Memory Championship]], was initiated in 1991 and the first [[USA Memory Championship|United States championship]] was held in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Foer| first =Joshua| authorlink =Joshua Foer| title =Forget Me Not: How to win the U.S. memory championship| work =[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]| date = March 16, 2005| url =http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/dispatches/2005/03/forget_me_not.single.html| accessdate = October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the competition requires committing to memory and recalling a sequence of digits, two-digit numbers, alphabetic letters, or playing cards. In a simple method of doing this, contestants, using various strategies well before competing, commit to [[long-term memory]] a unique vivid image associated with each item. They have also committed to long-term memory a familiar route with firmly established stop-points or loci. Then in the competition they need only deposit the image that they have associated with each item at the loci. To recall, they retrace the route, "stop" at each locus, and "observe" the image. They then translate this back to the associated item. For example, Ed Cooke, a World Memory Champion Competitor, describes to Josh Foer in his book ''[[Moonwalking with Einstein]]'' how he uses the method of loci. First, he describes a very familiar location where he can clearly remember many different smaller locations like his sink in his childhood home or his dog's bed. Cooke also advises that the more outlandish and vulgar the symbol used to memorize the material, the more likely it will stick.

Memory champions elaborate on this by combining images. Eight-time [[World Memory Champion]] [[Dominic O'Brien]] uses this technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = 1997 World Memory Championships| work = Mind Sports Worldwide| url =http://www.msoworld.com/brain/mental/memory97_2.html| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110514121614/http://www.msoworld.com/brain/mental/memory97_2.html| archivedate = May 14, 2011| accessdate =October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mt.artofmemory.com/wiki/Memory_Town_System_for_Languages|title=Memory Town System for Languages - Memory Techniques Wiki|author=|date=|website=mt.artofmemory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 [[World Memory Champion]], [[Clemens Mayer]], used a 300-point-long journey through his house for his world record in "number half marathon", memorising 1040 random digits in a half-hour. Gary Shang has used the method of loci to memorise [[pi]] to over 65,536 (2&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;) digits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Using this technique a person with ordinary memorisation capabilities, after establishing the route stop-points and committing the associated images to long-term memory, with less than an hour of practice, can remember the sequence of a shuffled deck of cards. {{cn|date=September 2017}} The world record for this is held by Simon Reinhard at 21.19 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = 5 Minute Speed Cards| work = World Memory Statistics| publisher = World Memory Sports Council| url =http://www.world-memory-statistics.com/discipline.php?id=spdcards| accessdate =October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique is taught as a metacognitive technique in learning-to-learn courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn|title=Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects - Coursera|author=|date=|website=Coursera}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally applied to encoding the key ideas of a subject. Two approaches are:
# Link the key ideas of a subject and then deep-learn those key ideas in relation to each other, and
# Think through the key ideas of a subject in depth, re-arrange the ideas in relation to an argument, then link the ideas to loci in good order.

The method of loci has also been shown to help sufferers of [[Major depressive disorder | depression]] remember positive, self-affirming memories.&lt;ref name="Dagleish"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dalgleish |first=Tim |last2=Navrady |first2=Lauren |last3=Bird |first3=Elinor |last4=Hill |first4=Emma |last5=Dunn |first5=Barnaby D. |last6=Golden |first6=Ann-Marie |date=12 February 2013 |title=Method-of-Loci as a Mnemonic Device to Facilitate Access to Self-Affirming Personal Memories for Individuals With Depression |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2167702612468111 |journal=Clinical Psychological Science |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=156–162 |doi=10.1177/2167702612468111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study at the University of Maryland evaluated participants ability to accurately recall two sets of familiar faces, using a traditional desktop, and with a head-mounted display. The study was designed to leverage the method of loci technique, with virtual environments resembling memory palaces. The study found an 8.8% recall improvement in favor of the head-mounted display, in part due to participants being able to leverage their vestibular and proprioceptive sensations.&lt;ref name="EKrokos"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Krokos|first=Eric|last2=Plaisant|first2=Catherine|last3=Varshney|first3=Amitabh |date=16 May 2018|title=Virtual Memory Palaces: Immersion Aids Recall|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10055-018-0346-3 |pages=1-15 |doi=10.1007/s10055-018-0346-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==
The ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'' and most other sources recommend that the method of loci should be integrated with [[elaborative encoding]] (i.e., adding visual, auditory, or other details) to strengthen memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/research/memoria/Ad_Herennium_Passages.html|title=Rhetorica ad Herennium Passages on Memory|first=Douglas Boin/Karl|last=Galinsky|date=|website=www.utexas.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.artofmemory.com/quintillian-on-memory-109.html|title=Quintilian on Memory - Art of Memory Blog|author=|date=25 November 2010|website=artofmemory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the strength of spatial memory, simply mentally placing objects in real or imagined locations without further elaboration can be effective for simple associations.

A variation of the "method of loci" involves creating imaginary locations (houses, palaces, roads, and cities) to which the same procedure is applied. It is accepted that there is a greater cost involved in the initial setup, but thereafter the performance is in line with the standard loci method. The purported advantage is to create towns and cities that each represent a topic or an area of study, thus offering an efficient filing of the information and an easy path for the regular review necessary for long term memory storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bremer| first = Rod| title =The Manual - A guide to the Ultimate Study Method (USM)| publisher =  Fons Sapientiae Publishing | date = September 20, 2011| location = Cambridge, United Kingdom| isbn = 978-0956990709}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.artofmemory.com/memory-techniques-brazilian-portuguese-795.html|title=New Project: Use Memory Techniques to Learn Brazilian Portuguese - Art of Memory Blog|author=|date=18 December 2010|website=artofmemory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Something that is likely a reference to the "method of loci" techniques survives to this day in the common English phrases "in the first place", "in the second place", and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Finger| first =Stanley| title =Origins of Neuroscience: A History of Explorations Into Brain Function| publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]| date = October 11, 2001| location = Oxford| pages = 333 | isbn = 978-0195146943}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.artofmemory.com/first-place-second-place-5806.html|title="In the First Place, in the Second Place" - Art of Memory Blog|author=|date=12 January 2015|website=artofmemory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique is also used for second language vocabulary learning, as polyglot [[Timothy Doner]] described in his 2014 [[TED (conference)|TED]] talk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Donor|first1=Timothy|title=Breaking the language barrier|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNmf-G81Irs|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method is further described in Anthony Metiver's book "How to learn and memorise German vocabulary". What the author suggests is creating a memory palace for each letter of the German alphabet. Each memory palace then shall include a number of loci where an entry (a word or a phrase) can be stored and recalled whenever you need it.

==Applicability of the term==
The designation is not used with strict consistency. In some cases it refers broadly to what is otherwise known as the [[art of memory]], [[Art of memory#Origins and history|the origins of which are related]], according to tradition, in the story of [[Simonides of Ceos]] and the collapsing banquet hall.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Yates, ''The Art of Memory'', University of Chicago, 1966, p1-2&lt;/ref&gt; For example, after relating the story of how Simonides relied on remembered seating arrangements to call to mind the faces of recently deceased guests, Stephen M. Kosslyn remarks "[t]his insight led to the development of a technique the Greeks called the method of loci, which is a systematic way of improving one's memory by using imagery."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen M. Kosslyn, "Imagery in Learning" in: Michael S. Gazzaniga (Ed.), ''Perspectives in Memory Research'', MIT Press, 1988,  p245; it should be noted that Kosslyn fails to cite any example of the use of an equivalent term in period Greek or Latin sources.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Skoyles (scientist)|Skoyles]] and [[Dorion Sagan|Sagan]] indicate that "an ancient technique of memorization called Method of Loci, by which memories are referenced directly onto spatial maps" originated with the story of Simonides.&lt;ref&gt;John Robert Skoyles, Dorion Sagan, ''Up From Dragons: The Evolution of Human Intelligence'', McGraw-Hill, 2002, p150&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to mnemonic methods, Verlee Williams mentions, "One such strategy is the 'loci' method, which was developed by Simonides, a Greek poet of the fifth and sixth centuries BC."&lt;ref&gt;Linda Verlee Williams, ''Teaching For The Two-Sided Mind: A Guide to Right Brain/Left Brain Education'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 1986, p110&lt;/ref&gt; Loftus cites the [[foundation story]] of Simonides (more or less taken from [[The Art of Memory|Frances Yates]]) and describes some of the most basic aspects of the use of space in the [[art of memory]]. She states, "This particular mnemonic technique has come to be called the "method of loci".&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth F. Loftus, ''Human Memory: The Processing of Information'', Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1976, p65&lt;/ref&gt; While place or position certainly figured prominently in ancient mnemonic techniques, no designation equivalent to "method of loci" was used exclusively to refer to mnemonic schemes relying upon space for organization.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Aristotle referred to ''topoi'' (places) in which memorial content could be aggregated - hence our modern term "topics", while another primary classical source, ''Rhetorica ad Herennium'' (Bk III) discusses rules for places ''and'' images. In general Classical and Medieval sources describe these techniques as the art or arts of memory (''ars memorativa'' or ''artes memorativae''), rather than as any putative "method of loci". Nor is the imprecise designation current in specialized historical studies, for example Mary Carruthers uses the term "architectural mnemonic" to describe what is otherwise designated "method of loci".&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cases the designation is generally consistent, but more specific: "The Method of Loci is a Mnemonic Device involving the creation of a Visual Map of one's house."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Gutman| first =Sharon A.| title =Quick Reference Neuroscience For Rehabilitation Professionals| publisher = SLACK Incorporated| date = December 1, 2007 |location =Thorofare, New Jersey| pages = 216| isbn =978-1556428005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This term can be misleading: the ancient principles and techniques of the [[art of memory]], hastily glossed in some of the works, cited above, depended equally upon images ''and'' places. The designator "method of loci" does not convey the equal weight placed on both elements. Training in the art or arts of memory as a whole, as attested in classical antiquity, was far more inclusive and comprehensive in the treatment of this subject.

== Spatial mnemonics and specific brain activation ==

Brain scans of "superior memorizers", 90% of whom use the method of loci technique, have shown that it involves activation of regions of the brain involved in spatial awareness, such as the [[Parietal lobe|medial parietal cortex]], [[retrosplenial cortex]], and the [[Hippocampus|right posterior hippocampus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Patients who have medial parietal cortex damage have trouble linking landmarks with certain locations; many of these patients are unable to give or follow directions and often get lost. The retrosplenial cortex is also linked to memory and navigation.  In one study on the effects of selective granular retrosplenial cortex lesions in rats, the researcher found that damage to the retrosplenial cortex led to impaired spatial learning abilities. Rats with damage to this area failed to recall which areas of the maze they had already visited, rarely explored different arms of the maze, almost never recalled the maze in future trials, and took longer to reach the end of the maze, as compared to rats with a fully working retrosplenial cortex.

In a classic study in cognitive [[neuroscience]], O'Keefe and Nadel proposed "that the hippocampus is the core of a neural memory system providing an objective spatial framework within which the items and events of an organism's experience are located and interrelated."&lt;ref This theory has generated considerable debate and further experiment. It has been noted that "[t]he hippocampus underpins our ability to navigate, to form and recollect memories, and to imagine future experiences. How activity across millions of hippocampal [[neurons]] supports these functions is a fundamental question in neuroscience, wherein the size, sparseness, and organization of the hippocampal neural code are debated.":&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In a more recent study, memory champions during resting periods did not exhibit specific regional brain differences, but distributed functional brain network connectivity changes compared to control subjects. When volunteers trained use of the method of loci for six weeks, the training-induced changes in brain connectivity were similar to the brain network organization that distinguished memory champions from controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Fictional portrayals ==
Fictional portrayals of the method of loci extend as far back as [[Greek mythology|ancient Greek myths]]. The method of loci also features prominently in the [[BBC]] series  ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]'', in which the titular main character uses a "mind palace" to store information. In the original [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] stories, [[Sherlock Holmes]] referred to his [[brain]] as an [[attic]].&lt;ref name="Zielinski18"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zielinski|first1=Sarah|title=The Secrets of Sherlock’s Mind Palace|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/secrets-sherlocks-mind-palace-180949567/|accessdate=6 March 2018|work=Smithsonian|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Hannibal Rising]]'' by [[Thomas Harris]], a detailed description of [[Hannibal Lecter]]'s memory palace is provided.&lt;ref name="harris-thomas-hanibal-rising"&gt;{{cite book |last=Harris|first=Thomas|year=2006|title=[[Hannibal Rising]]|location=United States|publisher=[[Delacorte Press]]|isbn=0385339410|pages=1-2,167,178-179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="martinez-conde-susana-sciam"&gt;{{cite news|last=Martinez-Conde|first=Susana|title=Neuroscience in Fiction: Hannibal Lecter's Memory Palace|date=April 26, 2013|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/illusion-chasers/hannibal-lecter/|work=Scientific American|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Minority''' ({{lang-fr|minorité}}) is a philosophical concept developed by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] in their books ''Kafka: Towards a Minor Literature'' (1975), ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' (1980), and elsewhere. In these texts, they criticize the concept of "[[majority]]".  For Deleuze and Guattari, "[[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]]-minor(itarian)" is primarily an [[ethic]]al action, one of the becomings one is [[affect (philosophy)|affected]] by when avoiding "becoming-fascist". They argued further that the concept of a "[[people]]", when invoked by subordinate groups or those aligned with them, always refers to a minority, whatever its numerical power might be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= The Concept of Minority for the Study of Culture| first1= Timothy | last1= Laurie | first2= Rimi | last2= Khan | journal=Continuum: Journal for Media and Cultural Studies  | volume= 31 | issue= 1 | pages= 3–4 | year= 2017 | url=https://www.academia.edu/31725889/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For Deleuze and Guattari the "minor" and "becoming-minority" does not refer to minority groups as described in ordinary language.  Minority groups are defined by identities and are thus '''molar configurations'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; belonging to the majoritarian State machine. (Molar configurations are composed of infinite lines of particles, i.e. lines of becoming.)&lt;ref&gt;Charles Stivale, ''Gilles Deleuze: Key Concepts'' (Routledge, 2014), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;  Deleuze and Guattari's central example here is [[Franz Kafka]]. Kafka finds himself at home among neither the [[Prague]] Jews nor the dominant German and Austria-Hungarian power structure.  For him a "people is missing" and his literature sets out to summon that people.  Nonetheless, there is a connection between what are ordinarily referred to as "minorities" and Deleuze and Guattari's conception of the minor and becoming-minor.  If becoming-minor often occurs in the context of what are ordinarily called [[minority group]]s, then this is because, Deleuze and Guattari argue, becoming-minor is catalyzed by existence in cramped social spaces.  The key point not to be missed is that becoming-minor is not related to molar identities, nor is it a politics that seeks representation or recognition of such identities (though Deleuze and Guattari stress that these are worthwhile political ambitions).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= The Concept of Minority for the Study of Culture| first1= Timothy | last1= Laurie | first2= Rimi | last2= Khan | journal=Continuum: Journal for Media and Cultural Studies  | volume= 31 | issue= 1 | pages= 1–12 | year= 2017 | url=https://www.academia.edu/31725889/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The example of [[patriarchy]] provides an illustration of how the concept of "minority" is used: while there may be more women than men numerically, in Deleuze and Guattari's terms, which are sensitive to relations of power, men still constitute the majority whereas women form a minority. Thus the concept of "becoming-minor" converges with that of "becoming-woman" (as they say, "everyone has to 'become-woman', even women..."), "becoming-animal", "becoming-molecular", "becoming-imperceptible" and ultimately, "becoming-revolutionary". Each type of affective becoming marks a new phase of a larger process that Deleuze and Guattari call [[deterritorialization]].

He also served as the [[Organisation of African Unity]]'s Assistant Secretary General, the [[Arab League]]'s Assistant Secretary-general, the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]]'s Special Representative for Somalia in 1992 and the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]]'s Special Representative for the [[Great Lakes region of Africa]] in 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/past/unosom1backgr2.html|title=UNITED NATIONS OPERATION IN SOMALIA I (UNOSOM I) - Background (Full text)|website=www.un.org|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Press release of the United Nations on 27 January 1997: Mohamed Sahnoun of Algeria nominated UN/OAU special representative for great lakes region of Africa [https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/1997/19970127.sga626.html]&lt;/ref&gt; before continuing to work for peace and reconciliation through various UN-related&lt;ref&gt;UPEACE – [[University for Peace]] [http://www.upeace.org/about/history.cfm]&lt;/ref&gt; or independent charities.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] {{cite web |url=http://www.iisd.org/about/staffbio.aspx?id=640 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231142216/http://www.iisd.org/about/staffbio.aspx?id=640 |archivedate=31 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = marshall&gt;[[Initiatives of Change]], interview with Katherine Marshall [http://www.iofc.org/mohamed-sahnoun-cfhs-interview-katherine-marshall]&lt;/ref&gt; He particularly focused on developing intercultural and inter-religious dialogues and on healing wounded memories from past conflicts.&lt;ref name = marshall/&gt;

==Early years and Algerian War==
Mohamed Sahnoun was born in 1931 in [[Chlef]] (known as [[Castellum Tingitanum]] during [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times, [[Al Asnam]] during the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] period and from 1962 to 1980 as well as [[Orléansville]] during the French colonization), in [[Algeria]]. He first studied at the Lycée of Algiers and then went on at the [[Sorbonne]] in Paris. He was there on the day of [[Algerian War#Beginning of hostilities|the first hostilities of the Algerian War]] (1 November 1954). As an activist of the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]], he responded to the call to strike launched by the  '’Union générale des étudiants musulmans algériens (Ugema)'’ on 19 May 1956,&lt;ref&gt;Henry Clement-Moore, L'Ugema (1955–1962) : témoignages, Casbah Éditions, Alger, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; stopped studying in Paris and came back home in Algeria.

There, he started to work in the 'Social Centers' created by former French Resistance fighter [[Germaine Tillon]] with the agreement of [[Jacques Soustelle]] (then Governor General of Algeria) in order to alleviate misery, squalor and illiteracy in Algerian populations.&lt;ref name = Chapeu &gt;Sybille Chapeu, Des Chrétiens dans la Guerre d'Algérie: l'action de la mission de France, Éditions « Atelier Ed De L'», Paris, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1957, the organisation was raided and searched by police, who arrested and detained twelve Christians (among which priests) and twenty-three Muslims. Being one of the managers of the 'Social Centers', Mohamed Sahnoun was part of this group, which was charged with conspiracy and tried in a fairly loudly-trumpeted trial, nicknamed the “Progressive Christians” trial.&lt;ref name = Chapeu/&gt; Mohamed Sahnoun was subsequently detained in the infamous "{{ill|Villa Sésini|fr}}", the torture and detention centre of the [[1st Foreign Parachute Regiment]] during the [[Battle of Algiers (1956–57)|Battle of Algiers]]. He himself was subjected to torture.&lt;ref&gt;''Les ennemis complémentaires: guerre d'Algérie'', par Germaine Tillon, Éditions Tirésias, 2005, {{p.|216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Released for lack of conclusive evidence, Mohamed Sahnoun then sought refuge in metropolitan France, in [[Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine|Clichy]] then in Switzerland in [[Lausanne]]. He was unable to go back to Algeria before independence.

During his early years Mohamed Sahnoun also got acquainted with the pacifist NGO [[Service Civil International]] in Algeria in 1952–53; he participated in several of their international workcamps and even became the head of their Algerian branch for some time. This provided him with an enduring philosophical background (see infra) and also with an important network of trusted friends who would be of great assistance to him through the events of the 1950s. Mohamed Sahnoun then resumed his studies at [[New York University]] where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Master of Arts degrees, both in political science.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Diplomatic career ==

===At the service of Algeria===
Mohamed Sahnoun first became diplomatic advisor of the [[Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic]]. In 1962 he travelled with [[Ahmed Ben Bella|president Ben Bella]] on his first official visit to the USA, where he met with [[John Fitzgerald Kennedy|president John Kennedy]] who had been one of the supporters of the cause of Algerian independence.  As the Algerian delegation was then due to travel to [[Cuba]], Kennedy showed Ben Bella the first secret pictures taken by [[Lockheed U-2|U2 planes]] showing [[Cuban Missile Crisis|Russian missiles launch pads in Cuba]]. In the name of peace and human security, Ben Bella agreed to convey a message to [[Fidel Castro]] making clear how much the American regarded this situation as a ''casus belli''&lt;ref&gt;''Ainsi était le "Che"'' par Ahmed Ben Bella, Le Monde diplomatique, novembre 1997 [http://www.mai68.org/textes/lecheparbenbella/benbella.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}.&lt;ref&gt;Interview de Mohamed Sahnoun par Katherine Marshall dans le Huffington Post le 10 mai 2011 [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/katherine-marshall/mohamed-sahnoun-interview-healing-memories_b_993262.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
Mohamed Sahnoun then held the following positions:
*Deputy Secretary-General of the [[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU) (1964–1973)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/people/mohamed-sahnoun|title=Mohamed Sahnoun|website=berkleycenter.georgetown.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Deputy Secretary-General of the [[League of Arab States]] in charge of Arab-Africa dialogue (1973–1975).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
*Algerian Ambassador to [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] (1975–1979)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*Algerian Ambassador to France (1979–1982). Under his leadership, an agreement was reached between France and Algeria regarding social security and retirement settlement for Algerian workers in France.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  
*Head of the Algerian diplomatic mission to the United States (1982–1984)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*Algerian Ambassadeur d'Algérie to the United States (1984–1989). During his tenure, he organised a state visit by president [[Chadli Bendjedid]] to Ronald Reagan, the first official visit ever of an Algerian head of state to the United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*In 1989, Sahnoun is called to take over urgently as Algeria's Ambassador to [[Morocco]], in order to succeed ambassadeur [[Abdelhamid Mehri]], who is himself urgently requested to take the presidency of [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] after the [[1988 October riots]] in Algeria; he becomes simultaneously Algerian Ambassador to Morocco and secretary of the [[Arab Maghreb Union]] (1989–1990).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
*His name was mentioned as a possible recourse candidate for the [[Algerian presidential election, 1999|Algerian presidential election of April 1999]] but it is finally [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]], a former foreign minister who had retired from public office since 1981, who stood as a " free candidate " for and from [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]].&lt;ref name = naylor&gt;Phillip C. Naylor, Historical Dictionary of Algeria, Scarecrow Press, Oxford, 2006 ; {{p.|400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== At the service of the United Nations ===
*Senior Adviser to the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED).&lt;ref name=ONU&gt;Source : United Nations press release, 27 January 1997, last consulted 7 March 2015 [https://www.un.org/press/en/1997/19970127.sga626.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to Somalia (April to November 1992).&lt;ref name=ONU/&gt; In this position, the efficiency of his diplomatic style is unanimously recognised and promising results are achieved;&lt;ref name = naylor/&gt; however his peacebuilding action was interrupted by the lack of efficient backing from the UN&lt;ref&gt;In his book entitled "Somalia: The Missed Opportunities", Mohamed Sahnoun clearly showed that when the United Nations tried to provide [[humanitarian assistance]], they were totally outperformed by NGOs, whose competence and dedication sharply contrasted with the United Nations' excessive caution and bureaucratic inefficiencies, their main Somalia envoys operating from the safety of their desks in Nairobi. The refusal of [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]], then [[UN Secretary General]] to accept this criticism led to the early end of Mohamed Sahnoun's mission in Somalia&lt;/ref&gt; and by the US military impatience to intervene. Mohamed Sahnoun resigned in protest. The intervention led by the US-backed [[Unified Task Force]] (code-named Operation Restore Hope) actually ended in utter disaster.&lt;ref&gt;Interview of Mohamed Sahnoun et [[Cornelio Sommaruga]] by Richard Werly and François d'Alançon, in ''Oser la Paix'', Éditions Autrement, Paris, 2011, {{ISBN|978-2-7467-3053-3}}, p. XVI.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the OAU in the Congo (1993).&lt;ref name=ONU/&gt;
*Special Adviser to the Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) for the Culture of Peace Programme (1995–1997).&lt;ref name=ONU/&gt;
*United Nations/[[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU) Special Representative for the Great Lakes region of Africa (1997).&lt;ref name=ONU/&gt;

==Studies and reports==
*Mohamed Sahnoun was a member of the [[Brundtland Commission]] on environment and development and co-author of the [[Our Common Future|Brundtland report]], which coined the expression [[sustainable development]] and its definition.  
*Co-chair with [[Gareth John Evans|Gareth Evans]] of the [[International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty]] (ICISS), whose report, entitled '’The Responsibility to Protect'’ was published in December 2001 with the support of the [[Canadian government]]. (Following the [[Rwanda genocide]], the [[Canadian government]] established the [[International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty]] (ICISS) in September 2000 under the joint presidency of [[Gareth Evans (politician)|Gareth Evans]] and Mohamed Sahnoun. In February 2001, the ICISS suggested the phrase "responsibility to protect" as a way to avoid the "right to intervene" or "obligation to intervene" doctrines and yet keep a degree of duty to act to resolve humanitarian crises.&lt;ref&gt;Haines, Steven; Kassimeris, George, ed. (2010), "Chapter 18, Humanitarian Intervention: Genocide, Crimes against Humanity and the Use of Force", The Ashgate research companion to modern warfare, Burlington, VT: Ashgate Publishing Ltd, pp. 307–329, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-7410-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

*President of [[Initiatives of Change]] International, Swiss-based iNGO which promotes effecting social change beginning with personal change, and works particularly on reestablishing dialogue and trust between opposing parties as a contribution towards peacebuilding, good governance and sustainable economic development (2007–2008).&lt;ref name = Le_Temps&gt;" Un musulman à la tête du centre de Caux ", paper in the Swiss daily [[Le Temps]] ([[Geneva]]) mercredi 6 décembre 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
*In 1994, Mohamed Sahnoun published "Somalia: The Missed Opportunities",&lt;ref&gt;USIP Press Books, octobre 1994, {{ISBN|978-1-878379-35-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; a book in which he analyses the reasons for the failure of the 1992 UN intervention in [[Somalia]]; he shows in particular that, between the start of the Somali civil war in 1988 and the fall of the [[Siad Barre]] regime in January 1991, the United Nations missed at least three opportunities to prevent major human tragedies. When the United Nations tried to provide humanitarian assistance, they were totally outperformed by NGOs, whose competence and dedication sharply contrasted with the United Nations' excessive caution and bureaucratic inefficiencies. If radical reform was not undertaken, warned Mohamed Sahnoun, then the United Nations would continue to respond to such crisis in a climate of inept improvisation.&lt;ref&gt;Book Review by Gail M. Gerhart in ''Foreign Affairs'', March/April 1995 [http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/50763/gail-m-gerhart/somalia-the-missed-opportunities]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2007, Mohamed Sahnoun also published (in French) a largely autobiographic novel set in [[Algeria]] in 1954, ''Mémoire blessée'' ('’Hurt Memory'’); its main character, Salem, '’a man of faith and dialogue'’, is jailed and tortured because of his convictions. He is however rescued by French people, some civilian, some military and some ecclesiactic – who all take great risks to shield him.  The book is clearly an evocation of the events which marked the author's younger years (see above the early years and Algeria wars section), but it also calls for human solidarity and the protection of the weaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|fr|Mémoire blessée : Algérie, 1957}}; Presses de la Renaissance, Paris, 2007, {{ISBN|978-2750902988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Mohamed Sahnoun met [[pacifism]] in 1952 in Alger through the [[Service Civil International]] NGO.  He had read the book by [[Pierre Ceresole]], the Swiss founder of this organisation, and even more importantly the book by [[Romain Rolland]] on [[Gandhi]], "which was practically my bedside book at the time.&lt;ref name=SCI&gt;Interview dans Breaking down barriers 1945–1975, 30 years of voluntary service for peace with [[Service Civil International]], Olivier Bertrand, Paris, 2008 (in French) [http://www.archives.sciint.org/sahnoun-mohamed_fr]&lt;/ref&gt;"
These ideas stayed with him through his long professional career, where he was from the onset a man of dialogue, trying for instance to establish appropriate communication between communities about [[Congo-Kinshasa|Congo]] through the UNESCO-backed World Assembly of Youth (WAY), or as a leading figure of the [[OAU]], particularly when African countries were confronted with the problems stemming from the borders inherited from [[colonialism]], or in his different missions for the UN.
His participation for several years in the very international and religiously mixed [[Service Civil International]] NGO also played a role in his understanding the sources of conflict and brought him to invest in how to heal the memory injuries resulting from past conflicts.&lt;ref name=SCI/&gt; 
He reinforces further this reflection in his later career years as he more and more commits in favour of human security, for instance though ''The Responsibility to Protect'' project (2001) or through his organizing from 2008 to 2012 of the Caux Forum for Human Security, with the following five themes: Healing Memory, Just Governance, Living Sustainably, Inclusive Economics and Intercultural Dialogue&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cauxforum.net/about/holistic#sthash.iBxTC4QC.dpuf|title=Holistic Approach {{!}} Caux Forum for Human Security|website=www.cauxforum.net|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Very committed to interreligious diversity and dialogue, Mohamed Sahnoun rose strongly against the idea of [[Clash of Civilizations]], saying for example: "I said to [[Samuel P. Huntington|Huntington]] during a discussion in Washington, there is no such clash. Take the Somalian example: from a religious point of view, Somalis are more or less all on the same wavelength. But because of total insecurity, they split into clans and sub-clans. That's why I want to develop intercultural and inter-religious dialogue. "&lt;ref name = Le_Temps/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42986">'''Morality and religion''' is the relationship between [[religion|religious]] views and [[morals]]. Many religions have value frameworks regarding personal behavior meant to guide adherents in determining between right and wrong. These include the [[Jainism#Core beliefs|Triple Gems of Jainism]], [[Judaism|Judaism's]] [[Halacha]], [[Islam|Islam's]] [[Sharia]], [[Catholicism|Catholicism's]] [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]], [[Buddhism|Buddhism's]] [[Eightfold Path]], and [[Zoroastrianism#Principal beliefs|Zoroastrianism's]] "good thoughts, good words, and good deeds" concept, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Good Without God: What a Billion Nonreligious People Do Believe|edition= |last= Esptein|first= Greg M.|year= 2010|publisher= HarperCollins|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-06-167011-4|page= 117}}&lt;/ref&gt; These frameworks are outlined and interpreted by various sources such as holy books, oral and written traditions, and religious leaders. Many of these share tenets with [[secular]] value frameworks such as [[consequentialism]], [[freethought]], and [[utilitarianism]].

Religion and morality are not synonymous. Morality does not necessarily depend upon religion, though for some, this is "an almost automatic assumption."&lt;ref name="The Elements of Moral Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book  | last1 =  Rachels| first1 = (ed) James | last2 =  Rachels | first2 = (ed) Stuart | title = The Elements of Moral Philosophy | publisher = McGraw-Hill| edition = 7 | year = 2011| location = New York| page = | isbn = 0-07-803824-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics'', religion and morality "are to be defined differently and have no definitional connections with each other. Conceptually and in principle, morality and a religious value system are two distinct kinds of value systems or action guides."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last1 =  Childress| first1 = (ed) James F. | last2 =  Macquarrie| first2 = (ed) John  | title = The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics | publisher = The Westminster Press| edition = | year = 1986| location = Philadelphia| page = 401| isbn = 0-664-20940-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the views of others, the two can overlap. According to one definition, morality is an active process which is, "at the very least, the effort to guide one's conduct by reason, that is, doing what there are the best reasons for doing, while giving equal consideration to the interests of all those affected by what one does."&lt;ref name="The Elements of Moral Philosophy"/&gt;

[[Value judgment]]s can vary greatly between religions, past and present. People in various religious traditions, such as [[Christianity]], may derive ideas of right and wrong from the rules and laws set forth in their respective authoritative guides and by their religious leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|edition= | authorlink = Simon Blackburn|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|pages= 9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equating morality to adherence to authoritative commands in a holy book is the [[Divine Command Theory]].&lt;ref name="The Elements of Moral Philosophy"/&gt; [[Polytheistic]] religions such as [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] generally draw from some of the broadest canons of religious works.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhippriya Subhadra Siriwardena, [http://www.lankaweb.com/dhamma/view12.html 'The Buddhist perspective of lay morality'], 1996&lt;/ref&gt; There has been interest in the relationship between religion and crime and other behavior that does not adhere to contemporary laws and [[social norm]]s in various countries. Studies conducted in recent years have explored these relationships, but the results have been mixed and sometimes contradictory.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar Saint George, [http://www.prisoners.com/relcrime.html "Religion's Effects On  Crime Rates"]&lt;/ref&gt; The ability of religious faiths to provide value frameworks that are seen as useful is a debated matter. Religious commentators have asserted that a moral life cannot be led without an [[Divine law|absolute lawgiver]] as a guide. Other observers assert that moral behavior does not rely on religious tenets, and secular commentators point to ethical challenges within various religions that conflict with contemporary social norms.

== Relationship between religion and morality ==
Within the wide range of ethical traditions, religious traditions co-exist with secular value frameworks such as [[humanism]], [[utilitarianism]], and others. There are many types of religious values. Modern [[monotheistic]] religions, such as [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] (and to a certain degree others such as [[Sikhism]]) define right and wrong by the laws and rules set forth by their respective gods and as interpreted by religious leaders within the respective faith. [[Polytheistic]] religious traditions tend to be less absolute. For example, within [[Buddhism]], the intention of the individual and the circumstances play roles in determining whether an action is right or wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Morgan, "Buddhism." In {{cite book |title = Ethical Issues in Six Religious Traditions |edition = Second|editor1-first =  Peggy|editor1-last = Morgan|editor2-first = Clive A. | editor2-last = Lawton|year = 2007|publisher = Columbia University Press|location = |isbn = 978-0-7486-2330-3 |pages = 61, 88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbara Stoler Miller]] points out a further disparity between the morals of religious traditions, stating that in Hinduism, "practically, right and wrong are decided according to the categories of social rank, kinship, and stages of life. For modern Westerners, who have been raised on ideals of universality and egalitarianism, this relativity of values and obligations is the aspect of Hinduism most difficult to understand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The Bhagavad Gita: Krishna's Counsel in Time of War |last =  Miller|first = Barbara Stoler|year = 2004|publisher = Random House|location = New York|isbn = 0-553-21365-2 |page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Stephen Gaukroger]]: "It was generally assumed in the 17th century that religion provided the unique basis for morality, and that without religion, there could be no morality."&lt;ref name="Gaukroger 2012 91"&gt;{{cite book |title = Objectivity: A Very Short Introduction|edition = |last = Gaukroger|first = Stephen|year = 2012|publisher = Oxford University Press|location = Oxford|isbn = 978-0-19-960669-6|page = 91}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view slowly shifted over time. In 1690, [[Pierre Bayle]] asserted that religion "is neither necessary nor sufficient for morality".&lt;ref name="Gaukroger 2012 91"/&gt; Modern sources separate the two concepts. For example, ''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics'' says that, &lt;blockquote&gt;For many religious people, morality and religion are the same or inseparable; for them either morality is part of religion or their religion is their morality. For others, especially for nonreligious people, morality and religion are distinct and separable; religion may be immoral or nonmoral, and morality may or should be nonreligious. Even for some religious people the two are different and separable; they may hold that religion should be moral and morality should be, but they agree that they may not be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last1 =  Childress | first1 = (ed) James F. | last2 =  Macquarrie | first2 = (ed) John | title = The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics | publisher = The Westminster Press | edition = | year = 1986 | location = Philadelphia | page = 400 | isbn = 0-664-20940-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Richard Paula and Linda Elder of the Foundation for Critical Thinking assert that, "Most people confuse ethics with behaving in accordance with social conventions, religious beliefs, and the law." They separate the concept of ethics from these topics, stating: &lt;blockquote&gt;The proper role of ethical reasoning is to highlight acts of two kinds: those which enhance the well-being of others—that warrant our praise—and those that harm or diminish the well-being of others—and thus warrant our criticism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |title = The Miniature Guide to Understanding the Foundations of Ethical Reasoning|edition = |last1 = Paul|first1 = Richard|last2 = Elder|first2 = Linda|year = 2006|publisher = Foundation for Critical Thinking Free Press|location = United States|isbn = 0-944583-17-2|pages = np}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; They note problems that could arise if religions defined ethics, such as:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

# religious practices like "torturing unbelievers or burning them alive" potentially being labeled "ethical"
# the lack of a common religious baseline across humanity because religions provide different theological definitions for the idea of [[sin]]

They further note that various documents, such as the [[UN Declaration of Human Rights]] lay out "transcultural" and "trans-religious" ethical concepts and principles—such as slavery, genocide, torture, sexism, racism, murder, assault, fraud, deceit, and intimidation—which require no reliance on religion (or social convention) for us to understand they are "ethically wrong".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Armin Geertz suggests that "the age-old assumption that religion produces morals and values is neither the only, nor the most parsimonious, hypothesis for religion".&lt;ref&gt;

== Religious frameworks ==
Religions provide different ways of dealing with moral dilemmas. For example, there is no absolute prohibition on killing in [[Hinduism]], which recognizes that it "may be inevitable and indeed necessary" in certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Menski, "Hinduism." In {{cite book |title= Ethical Issues in Six Religious Traditions |edition= Second|editor1-first=  Peggy|editor1-last= Morgan|editor2-first= Clive A. | editor2-last= Lawton|year= 2007|publisher= Columbia University Press|location= |isbn= 978-0-7486-2330-3 |page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Christian traditions, certain acts are viewed in more absolute terms, such as [[abortion]] or [[divorce]]. In the latter case, a 2008 study by the Barna Group found that some denominations have a significantly higher divorce rate than those in non-religious demographic groups (atheists and agnostics). However Catholics and Evangelical Christians had the lowest divorce rates and the agnostic/atheist group had by far the lowest number of married couples to begin with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/15-familykids/42-new-marriage-and-divorce-statistics-released|title= New Marriage and Divorce Statistics Released|author= Barna Group|date= 31 March 2008|publisher= Barna Group|accessdate= 19 November 2011|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141219120231/http://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/15-familykids/42-new-marriage-and-divorce-statistics-released|archivedate= 19 December 2014|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Thomas Dixon, "Many today&amp;nbsp;... argue that religious beliefs are necessary to provide moral guidance and standards of virtuous conduct in an otherwise corrupt, materialistic, and degenerate world."&lt;ref name="Dixon 2008 115"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Dixon| first = Thomas| title = Science and Religion: A Very Short Introduction| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 2008| location = Oxford| pages = 115| isbn = 978-0-19-929551-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same vein, [[Christian theology|Christian theologian]] Ron Rhodes has remarked that "it is impossible to distinguish evil from good unless one has an infinite reference point which is absolutely good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~ronrhodes/Atheism.html|title=Strategies for Dialoguing with Atheists|author=Ron Rhodes|publisher=[http://home.earthlink.net/~ronrhodes/ Reasoning from the Scriptures Ministries]|accessdate=January 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Dixon states, "Religions certainly do provide a framework within which people can learn the difference between right and wrong."&lt;ref name="Dixon 2008 115"/&gt;

== Religion and social dimensions ==

The study of religion and morality is contentious due to conceptual differences.  The ethnocentric views on morality, failure to distinguish between in group and out group altruism, and inconsistent definition of religiosity all contribute to conflicting findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKay|first1=R|last2=Whitehouse|first2=H|title=Religion and morality.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=March 2015|volume=141|issue=2|pages=447–73|doi=10.1037/a0038455|pmid=25528346|pmc=4345965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galen|first1=LW|title=Does religious belief promote prosociality?

Furthermore, some studies have shown that religious prosociality is primarily motivated by wanting to appear prosocial, which may be related to the desire to further ones religious group.  The egoistically motivated prosociality may also affect self-reports, resulting in biased results. Peer ratings can be biased by stereotypes, and indications of a persons group affiliation are sufficient to bias reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galen|first1=LW|title=The complex and elusive nature of religious prosociality: reply to Myers (2012) and Saroglou (2012).|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=September 2012|volume=138|issue=5|pages=918–23|doi=10.1037/a0029278|pmid=22925145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with other findings suggesting that religious humanitarianism is largely directed at in-group members, greater religious identification, greater extrinsic religiosity and greater religious fundamentalism were associated with racial prejudice.  This is congruent with the fact that 50% of religious congregations in the US are racially segregated, and only 12% have a degree of diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=Deborah L.|last2=Matz|first2=David C.|last3=Wood|first3=Wendy|title=Why Don’t We Practice What We Preach?

According to global research done by Gallup on people from 145 countries, adherents of all the major world religions who attended religious services in the past week reported higher rates of generosity such as donating money, volunteering, and helping a stranger than do their coreligionists who did not attend services (non-attenders). Even for people who were nonreligious, those who said they attended religious services in the past week exhibited more generous behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stark|first1=Rodney|last2=Smith|first2=Buster G.|title=Religious Attendance Relates to Generosity Worldwide|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/122807/religious-attendance-relates-generosity-worldwide.aspx|publisher=Gallup|date=September 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another global study by Gallup on people from 140 countries showed that highly religious people are more likely to help others in terms of donating money, volunteering, and helping strangers despite them having, on average, lower incomes than those who are less religious or nonreligious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crabtree|first1=Steve|last2=Pelham|first2=Brett|title=Worldwide, Highly Religious More Likely to Help Others|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/111013/worldwide-highly-religious-more-likely-help-others.aspx|publisher=Gallup|date=October 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study on [[Prosocial behavior|pro-social]] sentiments showed that non-religious people were more inclined to show generosity in random acts of kindness, such as lending their possessions and offering a seat on a crowded bus or train. Religious people were less inclined when it came to seeing how much compassion motivated participants to be charitable in other ways, such as in giving money or food to a homeless person and to non-believers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/04/120430140035.htm Highly Religious People Are Less Motivated by Compassion Than Are Non-Believers] by Science Daily&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laura R.

Modern research in [[Relationship between criminology and sociology of education|criminology]] also acknowledges an inverse relationship between religion and crime,&lt;ref&gt;As is stated in: Doris C. Chu (2007). Religiosity and Desistance From Drug Use. Criminal Justice and Behavior, 2007; 34; 661 originally published online Mar 7, 2007; {{doi|10.1177/0093854806293485}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some studies establishing this connection.&lt;ref&gt;
For example:

&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-analysis of 60 studies on religion and crime concluded, "religious behaviors and beliefs exert a moderate deterrent effect on individuals' criminal behavior".&lt;ref&gt;Baier, C. J.,&amp; Wright, B. R. (2001). "If you love me, keep my commandments":A meta-analysis of the effect of religion on crime. Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency,38,3–21.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in his books about the materialism in Americas Evangelical Churches [[Ron Sider]] accuses fellow Christians of failing to do better than their secular counterparts in the percentage adhering to widely held moral standards (e.g., lying, theft and sexual infidelity).&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Ronald J. Sider, ''The Scandal of the Evangelical Conscience: Why Are Christians Living Just Like the Rest of the World?'' (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker, 2005). Sider quotes extensively from polling research by [[The Barna Group]] showing that moral behavior of evangelical Christians is unexemplary.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Georgia State University]] study published in the academic journal ''Theoretical Criminology'' suggests that religion helps criminals to justify their crimes and might "encourage" it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/crime/2013/03/08/faith_based_prison_programs_new_study_suggests_religion_may_help_criminals.html | title=New Study Suggests Religion May Help Criminals Justify Their Crimes | publisher=www.slate.com | accessdate=March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research concluded that "many street offenders anticipate an early death, making them less prone to delay gratification, more likely to discount the future costs of crime, and thus more likely to offend".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://tcr.sagepub.com/content/17/1/49.short?rss=1&amp;amp%3bssource=mfr | title=With God on my side: The paradoxical relationship between religious belief and criminality among hardcore street offenders |author1=Volkan Topalli |author2=Timothy Brezina |author3=Mindy Bernhardt | journal=Theoretical Criminology |date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of religious values ==
Religious values can diverge from commonly-held contemporary moral positions, such as those on [[murder]], mass atrocities, and [[slavery]]. For example, [[Simon Blackburn]] states that "apologists for Hinduism defend or explain away its involvement with the caste system, and apologists for Islam defend or explain away its harsh penal code or its attitude to women and infidels".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|page= 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regard to Christianity, he states that the "[[Bible]] can be read as giving us a carte blanche for harsh attitudes to children, the mentally handicapped, animals, the environment, the divorced, unbelievers, people with various sexual habits, and elderly women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|page= 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He provides examples such as the phrase in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 22:18 that has "helped to burn alive tens or hundreds of thousands of women in Europe and America": "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live," and notes that the [[Old Testament]] God apparently has "no problems with a slave-owning society", considers birth control a crime punishable by death, and "is keen on child abuse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|pages= 10, 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blackburn notes morally suspect themes {{which|date=February 2017}} in the Bible's New Testament as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|pages= 11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[David Hume]] stated that, "The greatest crimes have been found, in many instances, to be compatible with a superstitious piety and devotion; Hence it is justly regarded as unsafe to draw any inference in favor of a man's morals, from the fervor or strictness of his religious exercises, even though he himself believe them sincere."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Hume]], "The Natural History of Religion." In {{cite book |title= The Portable Atheist: Essential Readings for the Nonbeliever|last= Hitchens|first= Christopher|year= 2007|publisher= Da Capo Press|location= Philadelphia|isbn= 978-0-306-81608-6|page= 30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] said, "There are also, in most religions, specific ethical tenets which do definite harm. The Catholic condemnation of birth control, if it could prevail, would make the mitigation of poverty and the abolition of war impossible. The Hindu beliefs that the cow is a sacred animal and that it is wicked for widows to remarry cause quite needless suffering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Why I Am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects|edition= |last= Russell|first= Bertrand|authorlink=Bertrand Russell|year= 1957|publisher= George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd.|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-671-20323-8|page= vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; He asserts that &lt;blockquote&gt;You find this curious fact, that the more intense has been the religion of any period and the more profound has been the dogmatic belief, the greater has been the cruelty and the worse has been the state of affairs....You find as you look around the world that every single bit of progress in humane feeling, every improvement in the criminal law, every step toward the diminution of war, every step toward better treatment of the colored races, or every mitigation of slavery, every moral progress that there has been in the world, has been consistently opposed by the organized churches of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why I Am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects |edition= |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |year=1957 |publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd. |location= New York |isbn=978-0-671-20323-8 |pages= 20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Paul Copan, Jewish laws in the bible show an evolution of moral standards towards protecting the vulnerable, imposing a death penalty on those pursuing forced slavery and identifying slaves as persons and not property.&lt;ref name="Paul Copan"&gt;{{cite web |last=Copan |first=Paul |url=http://enrichmentjournal.ag.org/201102/201102_108_slavery.htm.cfm |title=Does the Old Testament Endorse Slavery? An Overview |accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bertrand Russell, "Clergymen almost necessarily fail in two ways as teachers of morals. They condemn acts which do no harm and they condone acts which do great harm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Why I Am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects|edition= |last= Russell|first= Bertrand|year= 1957|publisher= George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd.|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-671-20323-8|page= 68}}&lt;/ref&gt; He cites an example of a clergyman who was warned by a physician that his wife would die if she had another (her tenth) child, but impregnated her regardless, which resulted in her death. "No one condemned him; he retained his benefice and married again. So long as clergymen continue to condone cruelty and condemn 'innocent' pleasure, they can only do harm as guardians of the morals of the young."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Why I Am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects|edition= |last= Russell|first= Bertrand|year= 1957|publisher= George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd.|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-671-20323-8|pages= 68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell further states that, "The sense of sin which dominates many children and young people and often lasts on into later life is a misery and a source of distortion that serves no useful purpose of any sort or kind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Why I Am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects|edition= |last= Russell|first= Bertrand|year= 1957|publisher= George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd.|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-671-20323-8|page= 166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russel allows that religious sentiments have, historically, sometimes led to morally acceptable behavior, but asserts that, "in the present day, [1954] such good as might be done by imputing a theological origin to morals is inextricably bound up with such grave evils that the good becomes insignificant in comparison."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Why I Am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects|edition= |last= Russell|first= Bertrand|year= 1957|publisher= George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd.|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-671-20323-8|page= 195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are number of secular value frameworks, such as [[consequentialism]],  [[freethought]], [[humanism]], and [[utilitarianism]]. Yet, there have been opposing views about the ability of both religious and secular moral frameworks to provide useful guides to right and wrong actions.

Various non-religious commentators have supported the ability of secular value frameworks to provide useful guides. [[Bernard Williams]] argued that, "Either one's motives for following the moral word of God are moral motives, or they are not. If they are, then one is already equipped with moral motivations, and the introduction of God adds nothing extra. But if they are not moral motives, then they will be motives of such a kind that they cannot appropriately motivate ''morality'' at all&amp;nbsp;... we reach the conclusion that any appeal to God in this connection either adds to nothing at all, or it adds the wrong sort of thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Morality|authorlink1=Bernard Williams|last= Williams|first= Bernard|year= 1972|publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= Cambridge|isbn= 0-521-45729-7|pages= 64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other observers criticize religious morals as incompatible with modern social norms. For example, popular atheist [[Richard Dawkins]], writing in ''[[The God Delusion]]'', has stated that religious people have committed a wide variety of acts and held certain beliefs through history that we now consider morally repugnant. He has stated that [[Religious views of Adolf Hitler|Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Religious aspects of Nazism|Nazis]] held broadly Christian religious beliefs that inspired the [[Holocaust]] on account of [[Christian antisemitism|antisemitic Christian]] doctrine, that Christians have traditionally imposed [[Christianity and women|unfair restrictions]] on the legal and civil rights of women, and that [[Slavery and Christianity|Christians have condoned slavery]] of some form or description throughout most of Christianity's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The God Delusion]] |authorlink1=Richard Dawkins |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |year=2006 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |location=Boston, New York |isbn=0-618-68000-4 |pages= 262–279}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Paul Copan, the position of the Bible to slaves is a positive one for the slaves in that Jewish laws imposed a death penalty on those pursuing slavery and treated slaves as persons, not property.&lt;ref name="Paul Copan"/&gt;

{{moresources|date=November 2007}}
{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
{{nihongo|'''''Mura'''''|[[wikt:斑|斑]]}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word meaning "unevenness; irregularity; lack of uniformity; nonuniformity; inequality",&lt;ref&gt;''Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary'' (2003), 5th edition, Tokyo: Kenkyusha, p. 2536.&lt;/ref&gt; and is a key concept in the [[Toyota Production System]] (TPS) as one of the three types of waste (''[[muda (Japanese term)|muda]]'', ''mura'', ''[[muri (Japanese term)|muri]]'').&lt;ref name = emiliani-better-thinking&gt;{{cite book | title = Better thinking, better results: case study and analysis of an enterprise-wide lean transformation | first1 = Bob  | last1 = Emiliani  | first2 = David | last2 = Stec | first3 = Lawrence  | last3 = Grasso  | first4 = James | last4 = Stodder | location =  Kensington, Conn  | publisher = Center for Lean Business Management | year = 2007 | edition = 2nd | ISBN = 978-0-9722591-2-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Waste reduction]] is an effective way to increase profitability. [[Toyota]] adopted these three Japanese words as part of their product improvement program, due to their familiarity in common usage.

Mura, in terms of business/process improvement, is avoided through [[Just-in-time manufacturing|Just-In-Time]] systems which are based on keeping little or no inventory. These systems supply the production process with the right part, at the right time, In the right amount, using [[first-in, first-out]] (FIFO) component flow. Just-In-Time systems create a “pull system” in which each sub-process withdraws its needs from the preceding sub-processes, and ultimately from an outside supplier. When a preceding process does not receive a request or withdrawal it does not make more parts.  This type of system is designed to maximize [[productivity]] by minimizing storage overhead.

For example:
# The assembly line “makes a request to,” or “pulls from” the Paint Shop, which pulls from Body Weld. 
# The Body Weld shop pulls from Stamping. 
# At the same time, requests are going out to suppliers for specific parts, for the vehicles that have been ordered by customers. 
# Small buffers accommodate minor fluctuations, yet allow continuous flow.
 
If parts or material defects are found in one process, the Just-in-Time approach requires that the problem be quickly identified and corrected.

== Implementation ==

[[Production leveling]], also called [[heijunka box|heijunka]], and frequent deliveries to customer are key to identifying and eliminating Mura. The use of different types of [[Kanban]] to control inventory at different stages in the process are key to ensuring that "pull" is happening between sub-processes. Leveling production, even when different products are produced in the same system, will aid in scheduling work in a standard way that encourages lower costs.

It is also possible to smooth the workflow by having one operator work across several machines in a process rather than have different operators; in a sense merging several sub-processes under one operator. The fact that there is one operator will force a smoothness across the operations because the workpiece flows with the operator. There is no reason why the several operators cannot all work across these several machines following each other and carrying their workpiece with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A study of the Toyota Production System |author= [[Shigeo Shingo]] |publisher=Productivity Press |year= 1989 |page= 157|isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This multiple machine handling is called "multi-process handling" in the Toyota Production System.

== Limitations, critiques and improvements ==

Some processes have considerable [[lead time]].  Some processes
have unusually high costs for waiting or downtime.  When this is
the case, it is often desirable to try to predict the upcoming demand
from a sub-process before pull occurs or a card is generated.  The smoother
the process, the more accurately this can be done from analysis of
previous historical experience.

Some processes have asymmetric cost.  In such situations, it may
be better to err away from the higher cost error.  In this case,
there appears to be waste and higher average error, but the waste
or errors are smaller ones and in aggregate leads to lower costs / 
more customer value.

For example, consider running a call center. 
It may be more effective to have low cost call center operators wait for 
high value clients rather than risk losing high value clients by making
them wait.  Given the asymmetric cost of these errors - particularly if
the processes are not smooth - it may be prudent to have what seems like
a surplus of call center operators that appear to be "wasting" call center
operator time, rather than commit the higher-cost error of losing the
occasional high value client.

[[File:Testudo horsfieldii locking into the camera.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Some tortoises show negligible senescence.]]
'''Negligible senescence''' is a term coined by [[biogerontology|biogerontologist]] [[Caleb Finch]] to denote organisms that do not exhibit evidence of [[senescence]] (biological aging), such as measurable reductions in their reproductive capability, measurable functional decline, or rising death rates with age.&lt;ref name=FinchLSG&gt;{{cite book |last1=Finch |first1=Caleb |title=Longevity, Senescence and the Genome |date=1994 |publisher=.  University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, IL |pages=206-247 |chapter=Negligible Senescence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many examples of species for whose organisms scientists have not detected an increase in mortality rate after maturity.&lt;ref name=FinchLSG/&gt; This may mean that the lifespan of the organism is so long that researchers' subjects have not yet lived up to the time when a measure of the species' longevity can be made. Turtles, for example, were once thought to lack senescence, but more extensive observations have found evidence of decreasing fitness with age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Study of negligibly senescent animals may provide clues that lead to better understanding of the aging process&lt;ref name=FinchLSG/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guerin | first1 = J | year = 2004 | title = Emerging area of aging research: long-lived animals with "negligible senescence" | url = | journal = Ann N Y Acad Sci | volume = 1019 | issue = | pages = 518–20 | doi=10.1196/annals.1297.096 | pmid=15247078}}&lt;/ref&gt; and influence [[evolution of aging|theories of aging]]. The phenomenon of negligible senescence in some animals is a traditional argument for attempting to achieve similar negligible senescence in humans by technological means.

There are also organisms{{which|date=January 2017}} that exhibit negative senescence, whereby mortality chronologically decreases as the organism ages, for all or part of the life cycle, in disagreement with the [[Gompertz–Makeham law of mortality]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(07)62033-8 |title=Evolution's greatest mistakes |year=2007 |author=Ainsworth, C |journal=New Scientist |volume=195 |pages=36–39 |last2=Lepage |first2=M|issue=2616}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Late-life mortality deceleration]]). Furthermore, there are species that have been observed to regress to a larval state and regrow into adults multiple times, such as ''[[Turritopsis dohrnii]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://8e.devbio.com/preview_article.php?ch=2&amp;id=6 |title=Cheating Death: The Immortal Life Cycle of '&amp;#39;Turritopsis'&amp;#39; |publisher=8e.devbio.com |accessdate=2010-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402085711/http://8e.devbio.com/preview_article.php?ch=2&amp;id=6 |archivedate=2010-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies have indicated a connection between phenomena related to negligible senescence and the general stability of an organism's [[genome]], specifically [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] processes, over its lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kogan|first1=Valeria|first2=Ivan|last2=Molodtcov|first3=Leonid I.|last3=Menshikov|first4=Robert J.|last4=Shmookler Reis|first5=Peter|last5=Fedichev|title=Stability analysis of a model gene network links aging, stress resistance, and negligible senescence|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=5|year=2015|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep13589|doi=10.1038/srep13589|pages=13589|pmid=26316217|pmc=4551969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In vertebrates==
Some fish, such as some varieties of [[sturgeon]] and [[rougheye rockfish]], and some [[tortoise]]s and [[turtle]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = J | year = 2001 | title = Escaping senescence: demographic data from the three-toed box turtle (Terrapene carolina triunguis)". | url = | journal = Exp Gerontol | volume = 36 | issue = 4–6| pages = 829–32 | doi=10.1016/s0531-5565(00)00243-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; are thought to be negligibly senescent, although recent research on turtles has uncovered evidence of senescence in the wild.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warner|first=Daniel A.|last2=Miller|first2=David A.

==In plants==
In plants, [[aspen]] trees are one example of [[biological immortality]]. Each individual tree can live for 40–150 years above ground, but the [[root]] system of the [[clonal colony]] is long-lived. In some cases, this is for thousands of years, sending up new trunks as the older trunks die off above ground. One such colony in [[Utah]], given the nickname of [[Pando (Quaking Aspen)|"Pando"]], is estimated to be 80,000 years old, making it possibly the [[list of long-living organisms|oldest living colony]] of aspens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/brca/naturescience/quakingaspen.htm Quaking Aspen] by the [[Bryce Canyon]] [[National Park Service]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's oldest known living non-[[Vegetative cloning|clonal]] organism was the [[Methuselah (tree)|Methuselah tree]] of the species ''[[Pinus longaeva]]'' growing high in the [[White Mountains (California)|White Mountains]] of [[Inyo County, California|Inyo County]] in eastern [[California]], aged {{Age as of date|4789|1957|August|5}} years.&lt;ref name=database&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conifers.org/pi/Pinus_longaeva.php |title= ''Pinus longaeva'' |accessdate= 2008-06-20 |publisher= Gymnosperm Database|date= March 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This record was superseded in 2012 by another Great Basin bristlecone pine located in the same region as Methuselah, and was estimated to be 5062 years old. The tree was sampled by Edmund Schulman and dated by Tom Harlan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rmtrr.org/oldlist.htm |title=OLDLIST, a database of old trees |last=Brown |first=Peter M |date=2012 |publisher=Rocky Mountain Tree-Ring Research, Inc. |access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In bacteria==
Among [[bacteria]], individual organisms are vulnerable and can easily die, but on the level of the [[Colony (biology)|colony]], bacteria can live indefinitely. The two daughter bacteria resulting from [[cell division]] of a parent bacterium can be regarded as unique individuals or as members of a biologically “immortal” colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chao|first=Lin|author2=Guttman, David S.|title=A Model for Damage Load and Its Implications for the Evolution of Bacterial Aging|journal=PLoS Genetics|date=26 August 2010|volume=6|issue=8|pages=e1001076|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1001076|pmid=20865171|pmc=2928801}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two daughter cells can be regarded as “rejuvenated” copies of the parent cell because damaged macromolecules have been split between the two cells and diluted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rang|first=Camilla U.|author2=Peng, Annie Y. |author3=Chao, Lin |title=Temporal Dynamics of Bacterial Aging and Rejuvenation|journal=Current Biology|date=8 November 2011|volume=21|issue=21|pages=1813–1816|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2011.09.018|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982211010207|pmid=22036179}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[asexual reproduction]].

==Cryptobiosis==
Some rare organisms, such as [[tardigrade]]s, usually have short lifespans, but are able to survive for thousands of years — and, perhaps, indefinitely — if they enter into the state of [[cryptobiosis]], whereby their [[metabolism]] is reversibly suspended. It is hypothesized by advocates of [[cryonics]] that the human [[central nervous system]] can be similarly put into a state of [[suspended animation]] shortly before [[brain death]] to be revived at a future point in the technological development of humankind when such operation would be possible.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

'''Nicolas Malebranche''', [[Oratory of Jesus]] ({{IPAc-en|m|æ|l|ˈ|b|r|ɑː|n|ʃ}}; {{IPA-fr|nikɔlɑ malbrɑ̃ʃ|lang}}; 6 August 1638 – 13 October 1715), was a [[French people|French]] [[Oratory of Jesus|Oratorian]]&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with the [[Congregation of the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catholic priest|priest]] and [[rationalist]] [[philosophy|philosopher]]. In his works, he sought to synthesize the thought of [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] and [[Descartes]], in order to demonstrate the active role of [[God]] in every aspect of the world. Malebranche is best known for his doctrines of [[Nicolas Malebranche#Vision in God|vision in God]], [[occasionalism]] and [[ontologism]].

==Biography==

===Early years===
Malebranche was born in [[Paris]] in 1638, the youngest child of Nicolas Malebranche, secretary to King [[Louis XIII of France]], and Catherine de Lauzon, sister of [[Jean de Lauson]], a [[Governor of New France]]. Because of a malformed spine, Malebranche received his elementary education from a private tutor. He left home at the age of sixteen to pursue a course of philosophy at the [[Collège de la Marche]], and subsequently to study [[theology]] at the [[Collège de Sorbonne]], both colleges from the [[University of Paris]]. He eventually left the Sorbonne, having rejected [[scholasticism]], and entered the Oratory in 1660. There, he devoted himself to [[ecclesiastical history]], [[linguistics]], the [[Bible]], and the works of [[Saint Augustine]]. Malebranche was ordained a priest in 1664.

In 1664, Malebranche first read [[Descartes]]' ''Treatise on Man'', an account of the [[physiology]] of the human body.  Malebranche’s biographer, Father Yves André reported that Malebranche was influenced by Descartes’ book because it allowed him to view the natural world without [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] [[scholasticism]]. Malebranche spent the next decade studying the [[Cartesian materialism|Cartesian system]].

===Philosophical career===
In 1674–75, Malebranche published the two volumes of his first and most extensive philosophical work. Entitled ''Concerning the Search after Truth. In which is treated the nature of the human mind and the use that must be made of it to avoid error in the sciences'' ({{lang-fr|De la recherche de la vérité. Où l’on traite de la Nature de l’Esprit de l’homme, et de l’usage qu’il en doit faire pour éviter l’erreur dans les Sciences}}), the book laid the foundation for Malebranche’s philosophical reputation and ideas. It dealt with the causes of [[human error]] and on how to avoid such mistakes. Most importantly, in the third book, which discussed pure understanding, he defended a claim that the ideas through which we perceive objects exist in God.

Malebranche's first critic was the [[Abbé]] [[Simon Foucher]], who attacked the ''Search'' even before its second volume had been published. Malebranche replied in a short preface added to that second volume, and then, in the 1678 third edition, he added 50% to the already considerable size of the book with a sequence of (eventually) seventeen ''Elucidations''. These responded to further criticisms, but they also expanded on the original arguments, and developed them in new ways. In the Tenth ''Elucidation'', for instance, Malebranche introduced his theory of "[[intelligible extension]]", a single, archetypal idea of extension into which the ideas of all particular kinds of bodies could be jointly resolved. In others, Malebranche placed a greater emphasis than he had previously done on his occasionalist account of causation, and particularly on his contention that God acted for the most part through "general volitions" and only rarely, as in the case of miracles, through "particular volitions".

Malebranche expanded on this last point in 1680 when he published ''Treatise on Nature and Grace''. Here, he made it explicit that the generality of the laws whereby God regulated His behaviour extended not only to His activity in the natural world but also applied to His gift of [[divine grace|grace]] to human beings. The book was attacked by fellow Cartesian philosopher, [[Antoine Arnauld]], and, although Arnauld's initial concerns were theological ones, the bitter dispute which ensued very quickly branched out into most other areas of their respective systems. Over the next few years, the two men wrote enough [[polemics]] against one other to fill four volumes of Malebranche's collected works and three of Arnauld's. Arnauld's supporters managed to persuade the [[Roman Catholic]] Church to place ''Nature and Grace'' on its [[Index of Prohibited Books]] in 1690, and it was followed there by the ''Search'' nineteen years later. (Ironically, the Index already contained several works by the [[Jansenist]] Arnauld himself.) Other critics with whom Malebranche entered into significant discussion include another fellow Cartesian, [[Pierre Sylvain Regis]], as well as [[Dortous de Mairan]]. De Mairan was sympathetic to the views of [[Baruch Spinoza]], and felt that he had found similar views in his reading of Malebranche: Malebranche assiduously resisted such an association.

===Vision in God&lt;!--linked from the lead--&gt;===
Just as all human action (along with the action of any other creature) is entirely dependent on God, so too is all human cognition. Malebranche argued that human knowledge is dependent on divine understanding in a way analogous to that in which the motion of bodies is dependent on divine will. Like [[René Descartes]], Malebranche held that humans attain knowledge through ideas – immaterial representations present to the mind. But whereas Descartes believed ideas are mental entities, Malebranche argued that all ideas exist only in God. These ideas, therefore, are uncreated and independent of finite minds. When we access them intellectually, we apprehend objective truth. Malebranche defined "[[truth]]" as a relation between ideas: since these ideas are in God, they are eternal and immutable, and consequently the only truths worthy of the name will themselves be eternal and immutable. Malebranche divided these relations between ideas into two categories: relations of magnitude and relations of quality or perfection. The former constitute "speculative" truths, such as those of geometry, while the latter constitute the "practical" truths of ethics. [[ethics|Ethical principles]], for Malebranche, are therefore divine in their foundation, universal in their application, and to be discovered by intellectual contemplation, just as geometrical principles are.

With regard to this account of intellectual knowledge, Malebranche was more or less following [[Saint Augustine]]. His great innovation was to explain how these same divine ideas could also serve as the immediate objects of human minds in sensual perception. The problem there is that the divine ideas are [[universal (metaphysics)|universal]], whereas all perception seems to be of particulars. Malebranche's solution was to suggest that, whereas the mind's intellectual conception of these ideas is pure and direct, its sensual perception of them will be modified by "sensations". These sensations, unlike the ideas, are indeed proper to individual created minds, and subsist as modes thereof. The idea will represent only the [[geometric]]al or [[mechanic]]al properties of bodies (size, shape, motion), while the sensation will consist in [[colour]] or some other sensible quality. The latter will limit the mind's apprehension of the former in such a manner as to make it represent a particular individual to that mind. To a different mind, one with a different sensation, the same idea could represent a different individual of the same general kind. In the ''Dialogues On Metaphysics And Religion'' (dialogue 1), Malebranche added that the same basic structure can also account for (the mental as opposed to the physiological element in) imagination, in this case where the idea only "lightly touches" the mind.

Malebranche was strongly influenced by Descartes but did not accept his philosophy uncritically. He is noted particularly for his view that we see all things in God and for his adoption of psycho-physical parallelism and 'occasionalism' to deal with the problem of interaction between mind and body. However, his attribution of epistemological and explanatory primacy to God leads to difficulties.

(1) If we see all things in God in the sense that He puts the ideas into our minds we can have no direct knowledge of the external world. We can appeal to clear and distinct ideas as a criterion for the veridicality of judgements about physical things, but it is God who is ultimately responsible for our ideas.

(2) If all things are under the direct control of God, subject to His will, what of human freedom? Malebranche's view that we have freedom to choose but only in relation to finite goods is not convincing, denying as it does the possibility of resistance of movement towards God as the universal good.

(3) In so far as God is not to be identified with the archetypal eternal truths in his mind Malebranche is not a pantheist. But, as in mediaeval philosophy, this gives rise to the problem of reconciling God's freedom with His supposed immutability.

(4) God is central to Malebranche's philosophy. However, his 'vision' of all things in God needs to be supported by rational proof. Unfortunately he offers only the Cartesian version of the [[Ontological Argument|ontological argument]]; and this is open to the standard objection that an entity's actuality cannot be derived from a mere abstract concept.

===Theodicy===
Malebranche's [[theodicy]] is his solution to the [[problem of evil]]. Although he conceded that God had the power to create a more perfect world, free from all defects, such a world would have necessitated a greater complexity in divine ways. Thus, God produces the natural evils that follow from simple laws not because he wills those particular effects, but because he wills a world that best reflects his wisdom by achieving the best possible balance between the intrinsic perfection of the work and the simplicity and generality of its laws.

===Malebranche's dualism===
Whereas Malebranche followed [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] in his description of [[intellectual]] [[knowledge]], in his approach to [[mind-body problem]]s he began as a follower of [[Descartes]].  But in contrast to Descartes, who considered it possible to form a clear and distinct idea of the mind, Malebranche argues in the ''[[Dialogues on Metaphysics]]'', a dialogue between Theodore and Aristes, that we do not have a complete conception of the powers of the mind, and thus no clear conception of the nature of the mind.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am unable, when I turn to myself, to recognize any of my faculties or my capacities.  The inner sensation which I have of myself informs me that I am, that I think, that I [[will (philosophy)|will]], that I have [[Sensation and perception psychology|sensory awareness]], that I [[suffering|suffer]], and so on; but it provides me with no [[knowledge]] whatever of ''what'' I am - of the nature of my [[thought]], my sensations, my [[Passions (philosophy)|passion]]s, or my [[pain]] - or the mutual relations that obtain between all these things [...] I have no idea whatever of my soul.&lt;ref name=meta_dia&gt;{{Citation

This leads Theodore to declare that 'I am not my own light to myself'; the nature of our own minds is highly obscure.  What is more, with regard to psycho-physical interaction, Malebranche argues that body could not act on mind, nor mind on body. The only active power (hence the only efficient cause of change in the world) is God. When I will that my arm should rise, my volition is the "occasion" or the "occasional cause" of the movement of my arm; the efficient cause of both my volition and the movement of my arm is God. Malebranche's doctrine, which could be found in contemporary commentaries on Aristotle, and which first appeared in certain Arab philosophers, is therefore called "occasionalism".&lt;ref name=meta_dia /&gt;

===Occasionalism===
In general, [[occasionalism]] is the view that there are no efficient causes in the full sense other than God. Created things are at best "occasions" for divine activity. Bodies and minds act neither on themselves nor on each other; God alone brings about all the [[phenomena]] of nature and the mind. Changes occurring in created things will exhibit regularities (and will thus satisfy a [[Humean]] definition of causation) because God in creating the world, observes what Malebranche calls "order": he binds himself to act according to laws of nature chosen in accordance with his general will that the world be as good as possible, and thus (for example) that the laws be simple and few in number.

In particular, there will be laws governing what we would customarily call the "interaction" of body and mind, so that similar movements in the body will "occasion" similar ideas in the mind. That relation has some features of the causal relation (it satisfies, for example, universal conditionals of the form "Whenever ''C'' occurs, ''E'' occurs"). But in reality both the idea in the mind and the movement in the body are caused by God.

==Scientific contributions==
Although better known for his philosophical work, Malebranche made some notable contributions to [[physics]], working within a broadly Cartesian framework but nevertheless prepared to depart from Descartes where necessary. In 1699, he delivered an address to the [[Académie Royale des Sciences]] on the nature of [[light]] and [[color]], wherein he argued that different colors resulted out of different frequencies in the pressure vibrations of subtle matter, much as different musical tones derived from different frequencies in the vibrations of air. His theory was presented as a corrective to Descartes' view, rather than a refutation thereof, but it has important parallels with the rival optical theory of [[Isaac Newton]]. Newton had already developed his position some thirty years earlier, but Malebranche probably would not have been aware of it until it was finally published in the ''[[Opticks]]'' of 1704, or, more likely, in its Latin translation of 1706. When Malebranche revised his 1699 paper for inclusion as the Sixteenth ''Elucidation'' of the 1712 edition of ''The Search After Truth'', he inserted a number of references to "Newton's excellent work".

In addition, Malebranche wrote on the [[Classical mechanics|laws of motion]], a topic he discussed extensively with [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]].  He also wrote on [[mathematics]] and, although he made no major mathematical discoveries of his own, he was instrumental in introducing and disseminating the contributions of [[Descartes]] and Leibniz in France. Malebranche introduced [[Guillaume de l'Hôpital|l'Hôpital]] to [[Johann Bernoulli]], with the ultimate result being the publication of the first textbook in [[infinitesimal calculus]].

Malebranche also developed an original theory related to [[preformationism]], postulating that each embryo probably contained even smaller embryos [[ad infinitum]], like an idealized [[Matryoshka doll]]. According to Malebranche, "an infinite series of plants and animals were contained within the seed or the egg, but only naturalists with sufficient skill and experience could detect their presence." (Magner 158–9)&lt;ref name=Magner&gt;

==Legacy==

Aside, perhaps, from [[John Norris (philosopher)|John Norris]] (who, in any case, drew at least as much from Malebranche's own sources, primarily Saint Augustine, as he did from Malebranche himself), there are few if any philosophers who can be considered faithful followers of Malebranche in all matters. He was, however, held in widespread high regard within his own lifetime and for some time afterwards, and the influence of certain of his ideas can be discerned in the works of several important figures.

[[Pierre Bayle]] regarded Malebranche as "one of the greatest philosophers of this age" (though, admittedly, not as ''the'' greatest, as is often reported).&lt;ref&gt;See Bayle's ''[[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique|Historical and Critical Dictionary]]'', article on "[[Epicurus]]", note S.&lt;/ref&gt; In note H to his "[[Zeno of Elea]]" article, Bayle discussed Malebranche's views on material substance with particular approval. Occasionalism and the vision in God seem to make the real existence of material substance redundant. Not only is it unable to be directly perceived, but it cannot actually affect us or anything else in any way at all. Descartes had also maintained that matter was not directly perceivable, but he had argued that the veracity of God could support a proof of its certain existence. Malebranche, however, weakened Descartes' argument, concluding that, from a philosophical point of view, its existence could only be shown to be probable. Bayle pushed even further down this same path, thereby laying much of the ground work for the [[immaterialism]] of [[George Berkeley]]. Berkeley, influenced both by Bayle and directly by Malebranche himself, simply took the final step to a full denial of the existence of material substance. ([[Arthur Collier]], who was also influenced directly by Malebranche, and by Norris, made the same move at around the same time as Berkeley did, but, it would appear, entirely independently of him.) Berkeley, admittedly, did reject the theory of vision in God. "It is evident", he insisted, "that the things I perceive are my own ideas."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous]]'', second dialogue.&lt;/ref&gt; But he was influenced by Malebranche's occasionalism, even though he excluded the activity of created minds from its domain. In addition, Berkeley agreed with Malebranche, against [[René Descartes|Descartes]], that we could not achieve a clear idea of the mind itself. [[John Locke]] had also argued for this, but he had made no distinction between minds and bodies on this point, whereas both Berkeley and Malebranche maintained (each in his own way) that we could have ideas of bodies but not of minds.

[[Gottfried Leibniz|Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] (who met Malebranche in Paris in about 1675 and corresponded with him thereafter) also rejected the vision in God, and his theory of [[pre-established harmony]] was designed as a new alternative to occasionalism as well as to the more traditional theory of efficient causal interaction. However, in his own [[theodicy]], even if it was somewhat more elaborate than Malebranche's, he did at least agree with Malebranche's fundamental contention that the simplicity of God's ways had to be given as much regard as the world's perfection.

[[David Hume]] supported and drew upon Malebranche's negative arguments to show that no genuine causal connections could be conceived between distinct mundane entities. However, when it came to finding a positive replacement for such causal connections, he turned inwards to the workings of the human mind, instead of turning upwards to God. With regard to this second half of Malebranche's occasionalism, Hume wrote:

:"We are got into fairy land, long ere we have reached the last steps of our theory... Our line is too short to fathom such immense abysses."&lt;ref&gt;''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]'', section 7, part 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume's [[empiricist]] [[epistemology]] led him to distrust Malebranche's confidence in discovering abstruse [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] truths through an intellectual union with God. Likewise, Locke felt that Malebranche's metaphysical speculations lacked a proper foundation, and, though ingenious, were ultimately unintelligible. In a somewhat similar manner, [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] regarded the theory of vision in God as "explaining something unknown by something even more unknown."&lt;ref&gt;''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Vol. I, "Sketch of a History of the Doctrine of the Ideal and the Real"&lt;/ref&gt;

Locke withheld his "An Examination of P[ère] Malebranche's Opinion Of Seeing All Things In God" from publication, "because he looked upon it to be an opinion that would not spread but was like to die of itself, or at least to do no great harm." &lt;ref&gt;"Advertisement To The Reader" of Locke's ''Posthumous Works''.&lt;/ref&gt; Much as Locke predicted, Malebranche's reputation outside France (where he always enjoyed high esteem) did begin to diminish during the 18th century, and remained low thereafter. However, over the last three or four decades, Malebranche's work has drawn renewed and ever-increasing interest. Several of his works have been translated into English for the first time, as scholars have been reassessing his ideas. Many{{who|date=September 2013}} have begun to argue that the originality and unity of his philosophical system merits him a place alongside such figures as Descartes, [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]], and Leibniz.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16565">'''Positive affectivity''' ('''PA''') is a human characteristic that describes how much people experience positive affects (sensations, emotions, sentiments...); and as a consequence how they interact with others and with their surroundings.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Ashby, F. G., Isen, A. M., &amp; Turken, A. U. (1999). A neuropsychological theory of positive affect and its influence on cognition. Psychological Review, 106(3), 529-550. doi:10.1037/0033-295x.106.3.529&lt;/ref&gt;

People with high positive affectivity are typically enthusiastic, energetic, confident, active, and alert. Research has linked positive affectivity with an increase in longevity, better sleep, and a decrease in stress hormones.&lt;ref&gt;Paterson, T. S., Yeung, S. E., &amp; Thornton, W. L. (2015). Positive affect predicts everyday problem-solving ability in older adults. Aging &amp; Mental Health, 20(8), 871-879. doi:10.1080/13607863.2015.1043619&lt;/ref&gt; People with a high positive affectivity have healthier coping styles, more positive self-qualities, and are more goal oriented.&lt;ref&gt;3. Li, Y. I., Starr, L. R., &amp; Hershenberg, R. (2017). Responses to positive affect in daily life: positive rumination and dampening moderate the association between daily events and depressive symptoms. Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment, 39(3), 412-425. doi:10.1007/s10862-017-9593-y&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Paterson, T. S., Yeung, S. E., &amp; Thornton, W. L. (2015). Positive affect predicts everyday problem-solving ability in older adults. Aging &amp; Mental Health, 20(8), 871-879. doi:10.1080/13607863.2015.1043619&lt;/ref&gt; Positive affectivity also promotes an open-minded attitude, sociability, and helpfulness.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Those having low levels of positive affectivity (and high levels of ''negative'' affectivity) are characterized by sadness, lethargy, distress, and un-pleasurable engagement (see [[#Negative affectivity|negative affectivity]]). Low levels of positive affect are correlated with social anxiety and depression, due to decreased levels of dopamine.&lt;ref&gt; Cohen, Jonah N., et al. "Positive and negative affect as links between social anxiety and depression: predicting concurrent and prospective mood symptoms in unipolar and bipolar mood disorders." Behavior Therapy, vol. 48, no. 6, 2017, pp. 820–833., doi:10.1016/j.beth.2017.07.003.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and findings ==
Studies are finding there is a relationship between dopamine release and positive affect in cognitive abilities.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; For instance, when dopamine levels are low, positive affect can stimulate the release of more dopamine, temporarily increasing cognitive, motor, and emotional processing. Stimulating dopamine release influences several cognitive functions. First, an increase in dopamine in the nigrostriatal system can temporarily relieve motor or cognitive dysfunction, due to Parkinson’s.

An increase in dopamine release also influences the mesocorticolimbic system, via VTA cells, increasing mood and open mindedness in older adults. Positive affect also stimulates dopamine production in the prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate facilities, which help with processing working memory and executive attention. Lastly, PA indirectly improves memory consolidation in the hippocampus, by increasing acetylcholine release from an increase in dopamine.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Overall, positive affect results in a more positive outlook, increases problem solving skills, increases social skills, increases activity and projects, and can play a role in motor function.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;4. Nelis, S., Bastin, M., Raes, F., Mezulis, A., &amp; Bijttebier, P. (2016). Trait affectivity and response styles to positive affect: Negative affectivity relates to dampening and positive affectivity relates to enhancing. Personality and Individual Differences, 96, 148-154. doi:10.1016/j.paid.2016.02.087&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negative affectivity==
Positive affectivity (PA) and negative affectivity (NA) are nearly independent of each other;&lt;ref name="EPP"&gt;Naragon, K., &amp; Watson, D. (2009). "Positive affectivity". In S. Lopez (Ed.), ''The Encyclopedia of Positive Psychology'' (pp. 707-711). Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; it is possible for a person to be high in both PA and NA, high in one and low in the other, or low in both. Affectivity has been found to be moderately stable over time and across situations (such as working versus relaxing).&lt;ref name="EPP"/&gt; Positive affectivity may influence an individual's choices in general, particularly their responses to questionnaires.

[[Happiness]], a feeling of well-being, and high levels of [[self-esteem]] are often associated with high levels of positive affectivity, but they are each influenced by negative affectivity as well.&lt;ref name="EPP"/&gt; Trait PA roughly corresponds to the dominant [[Personality psychology|personality factors]] of [[extraversion]];&lt;ref name="Watson 1"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Watson|first= David|last2= Clark|first2= Lee Anna|date= 1984|title= Negative Affectivity: The Disposition to Experience Aversive Emotional States|url= |journal= [[Psychological Bulletin]]|publisher= [[American Psychological Association]] (APA)|volume= 96|issue= 3|pages= 465–490|doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.96.3.465|accessdate= |pmid=6393179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tellegen"/&gt; however, this construct is also influenced by interpersonal components.&lt;ref name="EPP"/&gt;

==Testing==
Because there is not a hard-and-fast rule for defining certain levels of positive affectivity, different [[Self-report study|self-reported assessments]] use different scales of measure.&lt;ref name="EPP"/&gt; Several prominent tests are listed below; in each of these, the respondent determines the degree to which a given adjective or phrase accurately characterizes him or her.

*Differential Emotions Scale (DES): A PA scale that assesses enjoyment (happy or joyful feelings) and interest (excitement, [[alertness]], [[curiosity]]).&lt;ref name="EPP"/&gt;
*Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist – Revised (MAACL-R): Measures PA according to the DES scale and to an additional scale assessing thrill-seeking behavior (i.e., how daring or adventurous the person is).&lt;ref name="EPP"/&gt;
*Profile of Mood States (POMS): Uses vigor scale to assess the domain of PA.&lt;ref name="EPP"/&gt;
*Expanded Form of the Positives and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS-X): This test uses three main scales: joviality (how cheerful, happy, or lively), self-assurance (how confident and strong), and attentiveness (alertness and concentration).&lt;ref name="EPP"/&gt;
*International Positive and Negative Affect Schedule Short-Form (I-PANAS-SF): This is a brief, 10-item version of the PANAS that has been developed and extensively validated for use in English with both native and non-native English speakers.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=E.R.|title=Development and validation of an internationally reliable short-form of the positive and negative affect schedule (PANAS)|journal=[[Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology]]|year=2007|volume=38|issue=2|pages=227–242|doi=10.1177/0022022106297301|url=http://dionysus.psych.wisc.edu/lit/Articles/ThompsonE2007a.pdf}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Internal consistency]] reliability for the 5-item PA scale is reported to range between .72 and .78.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;

==In business management==
Positive affectivity is a managerial and organizational behavior tool used to create positive environments in the workplace. Through the use of PA, the manager can induce a positive employee experience and culture. "Since affectivity is related to the employee experiences, we expect the employees with high PA to feel considerable organizational support. Their optimism and confidence also helps them discuss their views in a manner characterized by constructive controversy with their supervisor, so that problems are solved and their positive feelings confirmed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hui|first1=Chun|last2=Wong|first2=Alfred|last3=Tjosvold|first3=Dean|title=Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology (2007), 80, 735–751|journal=Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology|page=738|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive Affectivity allows creative problem solving to flourish in an environment where employees are not intimidated to approach managers, therefore employees believe they are playing a key role in the organization in coming forward with solutions. The goal is to maximize PA and minimize any negative affectivity circulating in the business. Negative emotions, such as [[fear]], [[anger]], stress, [[hostility]], [[sadness]], and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], increase the predictability of [[workplace deviance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|last2=Kibeom|last3=Allen|first3=Natalie J|title=Organizational Citizenship Behavior and Workplace Deviance: The Role of Affect and Cognitions|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=2002|volume=87|issue=1|pages= 131–142|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.87.1.131|pmid=11916207}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore reduce the productivity of the business.

==Effects==
Positive affectivity is an integral part of [[everyday life]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} PA helps individuals to process emotional information accurately and efficiently, to solve problems, to make plans, and to earn achievements. The [[broaden-and-build]] theory of PA&lt;ref name="Fred 1"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Fredrickson|first= Barbara L.|date= September 1998|title= What Good Are Positive Emotions?|url= |journal= [[Review of General Psychology]]|publisher= |volume= 2|issue= 3|pages= 300–319|doi= 10.1037/1089-2680.2.3.300|accessdate= |pmid=21850154 |pmc=3156001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fredrickson2001&gt;{{cite journal |last= Fredrickson|first= Barbara L.|date= March 2001|title= The Role of Positive Emotions in Positive Psychology: The Broaden-and-Build Theory of Positive Emotions|journal= [[American Psychologist]]|publisher= APA|volume= 56|issue= 3|pages= 218–226|doi= 10.1037/0003-066x.56.3.218|pmid=11315248 |pmc=3122271}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that PA broadens people's momentary thought-action repertoires and builds their enduring personal resources.

Research shows that PA relates to different classes of variables, such as social activity and the frequency of pleasant events.&lt;ref name="Watson 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beiser"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Beiser|first= Morton|date= December 1974|title= Components and Correlates of Mental Well-Being|journal= [[Journal of Health and Social Behavior]]|publisher= [[American Sociological Association]]|volume= 15|issue= 4|pages= 320–327|doi= 10.2307/2137092|jstor=2137092}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bradburn"&gt;Bradburn, N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6393">'''Price's model''' (named after the physicist [[Derek J. de Solla Price]]) is a mathematical model for the growth of [[citation network]]s.
It was the first model which generalized the [[Simon model]]&lt;ref name="simon"&gt;Simon, H. A., ''On a class of skew distribution functions'', Biometrika '''42''', 425-440 (1955).&lt;/ref&gt; to be used for networks, especially for growing networks. Price's model belongs to the broader class of network growing models (together with the highly influential [[Barabási–Albert model]]) whose primary target is to explain the origination of networks with strongly skewed degree distributions. The model picked up the ideas of the [[Simon model]] reflecting the concept of [[rich get richer]], also known as the [[Matthew effect]]. [[Price]] took the example of a network of citations between scientific papers and expressed its properties. His idea was that the way how an old vertex (existing paper) gets new edges (new citations) should be proportional to the number of existing edges (existing citations) the vertex already has. This was referred to as ''cumulative advantage'', now also known as [[preferential attachment]]. Price's work is also significant in providing the first known example of a [[scale-free network]] (although it was named later). His ideas were used to describe many real-world networks such as the [[World Wide Web|Web]].

== The model ==

===Basics===
Consider a directed graph with ''n'' nodes. Let &lt;math&gt;p_k&lt;/math&gt; denote the fraction of nodes with degree ''k'' so that &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k}{p_k}=1&lt;/math&gt;. Each new node has a given out-degree (namely those papers it cites) and it is fixed in the long run. This does not mean that the out-degrees can not vary across nodes, simply we assume that the mean out-degree ''m'' is fixed over time. It is clear, that &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k}{kp_k}=m&lt;/math&gt;, consequently ''m'' is not restricted to integers. The most trivial form of preferential attachment means that a new node connects to an existing node proportionally to its in-degrees. In other words, a new paper cites an existing paper in proportional to its in-degrees. The caveat of such idea is that no new paper is cited when it is joined to the network so it is going to have zero probability of being cited in the future (which necessarily is not how it happens). To overcome this, [[Derek J. de Solla Price|Price]] proposed that an attachment should be proportional to some &lt;math&gt;k+k_0&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt; constant. In general &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt; can be arbitrary, yet Price proposes a &lt;math&gt;k_0=1&lt;/math&gt;, in that way an initial citation is associated with the paper itself (so the proportionality factor is now ''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 instead of ''k''). The probability of a new edge connecting to any node with a degree ''k'' is

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{(k+1)p_k}{\sum_k (k+1)p_k}=\frac{(k+1)p_k}{m+1}&lt;/math&gt;

===Evolution of the network===
The next question is the net change in the number of nodes with degree ''k'' when we add new nodes to the network. Naturally, this number is decreasing, as some ''k''-degree nodes have new edges, hence becoming (''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-degree nodes; but on the other hand this number is also increasing, as some (''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-degree nodes might get new edges, becoming ''k'' degree nodes. To express this net change formally, let us denote the fraction of ''k''-degree nodes at a network of ''n'' vertices with &lt;math&gt;p_{k,n}&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;(n+1)p_{k,n+1}-np_{k,n}=[kp_{k-1,n}-(k+1)p_{k,n}]\frac{m}{m+1}\text{ for }k\geq 1,&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;(n+1)p_{0,n+1}-np_{0,n}=1-p_{0,n}\frac{m}{m+1}\text{ for }k=0.&lt;/math&gt;

To obtain a stationary solution for &lt;math&gt;p_{k,n+1}=p_{k,n}=p_k&lt;/math&gt;, first let us express &lt;math&gt;p_{k}&lt;/math&gt;  using the well-known [[master equation]] method, as

: &lt;math&gt;p_k=\begin{cases}[kp_{k-1}-(k+1)p_k]\frac{m}{m+1} &amp; \text{for } k\geq 1 \\1-p_0\frac{m}{m+1} &amp; \text{for } k=0\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

After some manipulation, the expression above yields to

: &lt;math&gt;p_0=\frac{m+1}{2m+1}&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;p_k=\frac{k!}{(k+2+1/m)\cdots(3+1/m)}p_0=(1+1/m)\mathbf{B}(k+1,2+1/m),&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; being the [[beta function|Beta-function]]. As a consequence, &lt;math&gt;p_k\sim k^{-(2+1/m)}&lt;/math&gt;. This is identical to saying that &lt;math&gt;p_k&lt;/math&gt; follows a [[power law|power-law distribution]] with exponent &lt;math&gt;\alpha=2+1/m&lt;/math&gt;. Typically, this places the exponent between 2 and 3, which is the case for many real world networks. [[Derek J. de Solla Price|Price]] tested his model by comparing to the citation network data and concluded that the resulting ''m'' is feasible to produce a sufficiently good [[power law|power-law distribution]].

===Generalization===

It is straightforward how to generalize the above results to the case when &lt;math&gt;k_0\neq 1&lt;/math&gt;. Basic calculations show that

: &lt;math&gt;p_k=\frac{m+k_0}{m(k_0+1)+k_0}\frac{\mathbf{B}(k+k_0,2+k_0/m)}{\mathbf{B}(k_0,2+k_0/m)},&lt;/math&gt;

which once more yields to a power law distribution of &lt;math&gt;p_k&lt;/math&gt; with the same exponent &lt;math&gt;\alpha=2+k_0/m&lt;/math&gt; for large ''k'' and fixed &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt;.

Fortunately, much work dedicated to preferential attachment and network growth has been enabled by recent technological progress.

In mathematics, and especially [[topology]], a '''Pytkeev space''' is a [[topological space]] that satisfies qualities more subtle than a [[convergence (mathematics)|convergence]] of a [[sequence]]. They are named after E. G. Pytkeev, who proved in 1983 that [[sequential space]]s have this property.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | mr = 733840
 | pages = 209–213
 | title = Maximally decomposable spaces
 | volume = 154
 | year = 1983}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==

Let ''X'' be a topological space. For a subset ''S'' of ''X'' let &lt;span style="text-decoration: overline;"&gt;''S''&lt;/span&gt; denote the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of ''S''. Then a point ''x'' is called a ''Pytkeev point'' if for every set A with {{nowrap|1=''x'' ∈ &lt;span style="text-decoration: overline;"&gt;''A'' \ {''x''}&lt;/span&gt;}}, there is a countable &lt;math&gt; \pi &lt;/math&gt;-net of infinite subsets of ''A''.  A ''Pytkeev space'' is a space in which every point is a Pytkeev point.&lt;ref name="TAIA"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malykhin|first=V. I.|last2=Tironi|first2=G|year=2000|title=Weakly Fréchet–Urysohn and Pytkeev spaces|journal=Topology and its Applications|volume=104|issue=2|pages=181–190|doi=10.1016/s0166-8641(99)00027-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

* Every [[sequential space]] is also a Pytkeev space. This is because, if {{nowrap|1=''x'' ∈ &lt;span style="text-decoration: overline;"&gt;''A'' \ {''x''}&lt;/span&gt;}} then there exists a sequence {''a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''} that converges to ''x''. So take the countable π-net of infinite subsets of ''A'' to be {{nowrap|1={''A&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''} = {''a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+2&lt;/sub&gt;, …}}}.&lt;ref name="TAIA"/&gt;
* If ''X'' is a Pytkeev space, then it is also a [[Weakly Fréchet–Urysohn space]].

Society and the adolescent self-image. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. online pdf here: https://www.docdroid.net/Vt9xpBg/society-and-the-adolescent-self-image-morris-rosenberg-1965.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; is a [[self-esteem]] measure widely used in social-science research. It uses a scale of 0-40 where a score less than 15 may indicate a problematic low self esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://callhelpline.org.uk/Download/Rosenberg%20Self-Esteem%20Scale.pdf|title=Rosenberg self-esteem scale|website=callhelpline.org.uk, by The Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board|accessdate=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RSES is designed similar to the social-survey questionnaires. It is a ten-item [[Likert scale|Likert-type scale]] with items answered on a four-point scale&amp;mdash;from strongly agree to strongly disagree. Five of the items have positively worded statements and five have negatively worded ones. The scale measures state self-esteem by asking the respondents to reflect on their current feelings. The original sample for which the scale was developed consisted of 5,024 high-school juniors and seniors from 10 randomly selected schools in [[New York State]]. The Rosenberg self-esteem scale is considered a reliable and valid quantitative tool for self-esteem assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Blascovich, Jim and Joseph Tomaka. 1993. "Measures of Self-Esteem."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5331">'''Rosy retrospection''' refers to the [[Psychology|psychological]] [[phenomenon]] of people sometimes judging the past disproportionately more positively than they judge the present. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] occasionally referred to this phenomenon with the [[Latin]] phrase "{{lang|la|memoria praeteritorum bonorum}}", which translates into [[English language|English]] roughly as "the past is always well remembered".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/hide-and-seek/201411/the-meaning-nostalgia|title=The Meaning of Nostalgia|website=Psychology Today|language=en|access-date=2017-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosy retrospection is very closely related to the concept of [[nostalgia]]. The difference between the terms is that rosy retrospection is a [[cognitive bias]], whereas the broader phenomenon of nostalgia is not necessarily based on a biased perspective.

Although rosy retrospection is a cognitive bias, and distorts a person's view of [[reality]] to some extent, some people theorize that it may in part serve a useful purpose in increasing [[self-esteem]] and a person's overall sense of [[well-being]]. For example, Terence Mitchell and Leigh Thompson mention this possibility in a chapter entitled "A Theory of Temporal Adjustments of the Evaluation of Events"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/biases/Book_Chapter_Theory_of_Temporal_Adjustments.pdf|title=A Theory of Temporal Adjustments of the Evaluation of Events|last=|first=|date=|website=MIT|access-date=2017-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a book of collected research reports from various authors entitled "Advances in Managerial Cognition and Organizational Information Processing".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://online.seu.edu/rosy-retrospection-psychological-phenomenon/|title=Rosy Retrospection: A Psychological Phenomenon|date=2016-02-23|work=Southeastern University|access-date=2017-04-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simplifications and exaggerations of [[Memory|memories]] (such as occurs in rosy retrospection) may also make it easier for people's [[brain]]s to store long-term memories, as removing details may reduce the burden of those memories on the brain and make the brain require fewer [[Neuron|neural connections]] to form and engrain memories. [[Mnemonic]]s, psychological [[Chunking (psychology)|chunking]], and [[subconscious]] distortions of memories may in part serve a similar purpose: memory compression by way of simplification. [[Data compression]] in [[computer]]s works on similar principles: compression [[algorithm]]s tend to either (1) remove unnecessary details from [[data]] or (2) reframe the details in a simpler way from which the data can subsequently be reconstructed as needed, or (3) both. Much the same can be said of human memories and the human brain's own process of [[memorization]].

In English, the [[idiom]] "[[wikt:rose-colored glasses|rose-colored glasses]]" or "rose-tinted glasses" is also sometimes used to refer to the phenomenon of rosy retrospection. Usually this idiom occurs as some variation of the phrase "seeing things through rose-tinted glasses" or some other roughly similar phrasing.

Rosy retrospection is also related to the concept of [[declinism]].

==Experiments==
In one group of experiments, three groups going on different vacations were interviewed before, during, and after their vacations. Most followed the pattern of initially positive anticipation, followed by mild disappointment thereafter. Generally, most subjects reviewed the events more favorably some time after the events had occurred than they did while experiencing them.&lt;ref name="10.1006/jesp.1997.1333"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="652">The '''signal-to-crosstalk ratio''' at a specified point in a [[electrical network|circuit]] is the [[ratio]] of the [[power (physics)|power]] of the wanted [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] to the power of the unwanted signal from another [[Communication channel|channel]]. 

The signals are adjusted in each channel so that they are of equal power at the [[zero transmission level point]] in their respective channels. 

The signal-to-[[crosstalk (electronics)|crosstalk]] ratio is usually expressed in [[decibel|dB]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34240">'''Social behavior''' is [[behavior]] among two or more [[Organism|organisms]], and encompasses any behavior in which one member effects another within the same species. This is due to an [[interaction]] among those members. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.elsevier.com/books/the-laboratory-rat/suckow/978-0-12-074903-4|title=The Laboratory Rat - 2nd Edition|last=Elsevier|website=www.elsevier.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.elsevier.com/books/handbook-of-biologically-active-peptides/kastin/978-0-12-385095-9|title=Handbook of Biologically Active Peptides - 2nd Edition|last=Elsevier|website=www.elsevier.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social behavior can be seen as similar to an exchange of goods, with the expectation that when you give, you will receive the same. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Homans|first=George C.|date=1958|title=Social Behavior as Exchange|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2772990|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=63|issue=6|pages=597–606}}&lt;/ref&gt; This behavior can be effected by both the qualities of the individual, along with environmental (situational) factors, and result from an interaction between the two. This means that, in regards to humans, social behavior can be determined by both the individual characteristics of the person, and the situation they are in. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snyder|first=Mark|last2=Ickes|first2=W.|date=1985|title=Personality and social behavior|url=https://experts.umn.edu/en/publications/personality-and-social-behavior|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major aspect of social behavior is [[communication]], which is the basis for survival and [[reproduction]] due to the need for interaction. &lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Gene E.|last2=Fernald|first2=Russell D.|last3=Clayton|first3=David F.|date=2008-11-07|title=Genes and Social Behavior|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/322/5903/896|journal=Science|language=en|volume=322|issue=5903|pages=896–900|doi=10.1126/science.1159277|issn=0036-8075|pmid=18988841}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social behavior is said to be determined by two different processes, that can either work together or oppose one another. The dual-systems model of reflective and impulsive determinants of social behavior came out of the realization that behavior cannot just be determined by one single factor, whether that be consciously behaving or by pure impulse. Instead, these factors that determine behavior can work in different situations and moments, and even oppose one another. While at times one can behave with a specific goal in mind, other times they can behave without rational control, and driven by impulse instead. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strack|first=Fritz|last2=Deutsch|first2=Roland|date=2004|title=Reflective and impulsive determinants of social behavior|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15454347|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review: An Official Journal of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc|volume=8|issue=3|pages=220–247|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0803_1|issn=1088-8683|pmid=15454347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also distinctions between different types of social behavior, such as [[mundane]] versus [[defence mechanisms|defensive]] social behavior. Mundane social behavior is a result of interactions in day-to-day life, and are behaviors learned as one is exposed to different situations. On the other hand, defensive behavior arises out of impulse, when one is faced with conflicting desires. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whiting|first=Beatrice Blyth|date=1980|title=Culture and Social Behavior: A Model for the Development of Social Behavior|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/640018|journal=Ethos|volume=8|issue=2|pages=95–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Development of Social Behavior ==
'''Social behavior''' constantly changes as one continues to grow and develop, reaching different stages of life. The development of behavior is deeply tied with the biological and cognitive changes one is experiencing at any given time, and thus creates general patterns of social behavior development in humans. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.elsevier.com/books/childrens-social-behavior/strain/978-0-12-673455-3|title=Children's Social Behavior - 1st Edition|last=Elsevier|website=www.elsevier.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as social behavior is influenced by both the situation and an individual's characteristics, the development of behavior is due to the combination of the two as well--the [[temperament]] of the child along with the settings they are exposed to. &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothbart|first=Mary K.|last2=Ahadi|first2=Stephan A.|last3=Hershey|first3=Karen L.|date=1994|title=Temperament and Social Behavior in Childhood|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/23087906|journal=Merrill-Palmer Quarterly|volume=40|issue=1|pages=21–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whiting|first=Beatrice Blyth|date=1980|title=Culture and Social Behavior: A Model for the Development of Social Behavior|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/640018|journal=Ethos|volume=8|issue=2|pages=95–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Culture]] (parents and individuals that influence socialization in children) play a large role in the development of a child's social behavior, as the parents or caregivers are typically those who decide the settings and situations that the child is exposed to. These various settings the child is placed in (for example, the playground and classroom) form habits of interaction and behavior insomuch as the child being exposed to certain settings more frequently than others. What takes particular precedence in the influence of the setting are the people that the child must interact with--their age, sex, and at times culture. &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Emotions also plays a large role in the development of social behavior, as it is intertwined with the way an individual behaves. Through social interactions, emotion is understood through various verbal and nonverbal displays, and thus plays a large role in communication. Many of the processes that occur in the brain and underly emotion often greatly correlate with the processes that are needed for social behavior as well. A major aspect of interaction is understanding how the other person thinks and feels, and being able to detect emotional states becomes necessary for individuals to effectively interact with one another and behave socially. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.elsevier.com/books/advances-in-child-development-and-behavior/kail/978-0-12-374317-6|title=Advances in Child Development and Behavior, Volume 36 - 1st Edition|last=Elsevier|website=www.elsevier.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the child continues to gain social information, their behavior develops accordingly. &lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Gene E.|last2=Fernald|first2=Russell D.|last3=Clayton|first3=David F.|date=2008-11-07|title=Genes and Social Behavior|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/322/5903/896|journal=Science|language=en|volume=322|issue=5903|pages=896–900|doi=10.1126/science.1159277|issn=0036-8075|pmid=18988841}}&lt;/ref&gt; One must learn how to behave according to the interactions and people relevant to a certain setting, and therefore begin to intuitively know the appropriate form of social interaction depending on the situation. Therefore, behavior is constantly changing as required, and maturity brings this on. A child must learn to balance their own desires with those of the people they interact with, and this ability to correctly respond to contextual cues and understand the intentions and desires of another person improves with age. &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; That being said, the individual characteristics of the child (their temperament) is important to understanding how the individual learns social behaviors and cues given to them, and this learnability is not consistent across all children. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Patterns of Development Across the Lifespan ===
When studying patterns of biological development across the human lifespan, there are certain patterns that are well-maintained across humans. These patterns can often correspond with social development, and biological changes lead to respective changes in interactions. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In '''pre and post-natal infancy,''' the behavior of the infant is correlated with that of the mother. In infancy, there is already a development of the awareness of a stranger, in which case the individual is able to identify and distinguish between people. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Come '''childhood,''' the individual begins to attend more to their peers, and communication begins to take a verbal form. One also begins to classify themselves on the basis of their own gender and other qualities salient about themselves, like race and age. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

When the child reaches '''school age,''' one typically becomes more aware of the structure within society in regards to gender, and how their own gender plays a role in this. They become increasingly reliant on verbal forms of communication, and more likely to form groups and awareness of their own role within the group. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

By '''puberty,''' general relations among same and opposite sex individuals are much more salient, and individuals begin to behave according to the norms of these situations. With the increasing awareness of their sex and thus stereotypes that go along with it, the individual begins to choose how much they align with these stereotypes and thus behaves either according to those stereotypes or not. This is also the time that individuals more often form sexual pairs. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Once the individual reaches '''childrearing''' age, one must begin to undergo changes within the own behavior in accordance to major life-changes of a developing family. The potential new child requires the parent to modify their behavior to accommodate a new member of the family. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Come '''senescence''' and '''retirement,''' behavior is more stable as the individual as often established their social circle (whatever it may be) and is more committed to their social structure. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Neural and Biological Correlates of Social Behavior ==

With the advent of the field '''social cognitive neuroscience''' came interest in studying social behavior's correlates within the brain, to see what is happening beneath the surface as organisms act in a social manner. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Behrens|first=Timothy E. J.|last2=Hunt|first2=Laurence T.|last3=Rushworth|first3=Matthew F. S.|date=2009-05-29|title=The Computation of Social Behavior|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/324/5931/1160|journal=Science|language=en|volume=324|issue=5931|pages=1160–1164|doi=10.1126/science.1169694|issn=0036-8075|pmid=19478175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is debate about which particular regions of the brain are responsible for social behavior, some have claimed that the paracingulate cortex is activated when one person is thinking about the motives or aims of another, a means of understanding the social world and behaving accordingly. The medial prefrontal lobe was also been seen to have activation during social cognition &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amodio|first=David M.|last2=Frith|first2=Chris D.|date=April 2006|title=Meeting of minds: the medial frontal cortex and social cognition|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn1884|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|language=En|volume=7|issue=4|pages=268–277|doi=10.1038/nrn1884|issn=1471-003X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also discovered through studies on [[Rhesus macaque|rhesus monkeys]] that the [[amygdala]]''',''' a region known for expressing fear, was activated specifically when the monkeys were faced with a social situation they had never been in before. This region of the brain was shown to be sensitive to the fear that comes with a novel social situation, inhibiting social interaction. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amaral|first=David G.|date=December 2003|title=The amygdala, social behavior, and danger detection|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14766647|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=1000|pages=337–347|issn=0077-8923|pmid=14766647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of studying which brain regions may be responsible for social behavior has been through looking at patients with brain injuries who have an impairment in social behavior. Lesions in the [[prefrontal cortex]] that occurs in adulthood can effect the functioning of social behavior. When these lesions or a dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex occur in infancy/early on in life, the development of proper moral and social behavior is effected and thus atypical. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Steven W.|last2=Bechara|first2=Antoine|last3=Damasio|first3=Hanna|last4=Tranel|first4=Daniel|last5=Damasio|first5=Antonio R.|date=November 1999|title=Impairment of social and moral behavior related to early damage in human prefrontal cortex|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nn1199_1032|journal=Nature Neuroscience|language=En|volume=2|issue=11|pages=1032–1037|doi=10.1038/14833|issn=1097-6256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biological Correlates ===
[[File:Prairie vole.gif|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Prairie%20vole.gif|thumb|A prairie vole]]
Along with neural correlates, research has investigated what happens within the body (and potentially modulates) social behavior. [[Vasopressin]] is a [[posterior pituitary]] [[hormone]] that is seen to potentially play a role in affiliation for young rats. Along with young rats, vasopressin has also been associated with paternal behavior in [[Prairie vole|prairie voles]]. Research has tried to connect animal research to humans, and found that vasopressin ''may'' play a role in the social responses of males in human research. &lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Handbook_of_Positive_Psychology.html?id=TLtRmAEACAAJ|title=Handbook of Positive Psychology|last=Snyder|first=C. R.|last2=Lopez|first2=Shane J.|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195135336|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oxytocin]] was also correlated with positive social behavior, and elevated levels were even seen to work to potentially help improve social behavior that may have been suppressed due to stress. Thus, targeting levels of oxytocin may play a role in interventions of disorders that deal with atypical social behavior. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013-01-01|title=Peptides and Behavior|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123850959002542|journal=Handbook of Biologically Active Peptides|language=en|pages=1858–1863|doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-385095-9.00254-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with vasopressin, [[serotonin]] has also been inspected in relation to social behavior in humans. It was found to be associated with human feelings of social connection, and we see a drop in serotonin when one is socially isolated or has feelings of social isolation. Serotonin has also been associated with social confidence. &lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;

== Affect and Social Behavior ==
[[Positive affectivity|Positive affect]] (emotion) has been seen to have a large impact on social behavior, particularly by inducing more helping behavior, [[cooperation]], and sociability. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=xFc1oeDgOZ0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA203&amp;ots=MXXkHCmW4l&amp;sig=0pB2499gMjgi1aA27mcp6GR70Qo#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|date=1987-11-05|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780080567341|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that even subtly inducing [[Positive affectivity|positive affect]] within individuals caused greater social behavior and helping. This phenomena, however, is not one-directional. Just as positive affect can influence social behavior, social behavior can have an influence on positive affect. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Isen|first=Alice M.|last2=Levin|first2=Paula F.|date=1972|title=Effect of feeling good on helping: Cookies and kindness.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/h0032317|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=21|issue=3|pages=384–388|doi=10.1037/h0032317|issn=1939-1315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electronic Media and Social Behavior ==
Social behavior has typically been seen as a changing of behaviors relevant to the situation at hand, acting appropriately with the setting one is in. However, with the advent of electronic media, people began to find themselves in situations they may have not been exposed to in everyday life. Novel situations and information presented through electronic media has formed interactions that are completely new to people. While people typically behaved in line with their setting, the lines were now becoming blurred. This led to a cascade of results, as gender norms started to merge, and people were coming in contact with information they had never been exposed to through face-to-face interaction. A political leader could no longer tailor a speech to just one audience, for their speech would be translated and heard by anyone through the media. People can no longer play drastically different roles when put in different situations, because the situations overlap more and information is more readily available. Communication flows more quickly and fluidly through media, causing behavior to merge accordingly. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=RMrQCwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=types+of+social+behavior&amp;ots=Q6mw4_keQ5&amp;sig=B7eK6e-Bqe75zNciNTKAgux1_yA#v=onepage&amp;q=conclusion&amp;f=false|title=No Sense of Place: The Impact of Electronic Media on Social Behavior|last=Meyrowitz|first=Joshua|date=1986-12-11|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198020578|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Helping the homeless (cropped).jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Helping%20the%20homeless%20(cropped).jpg|thumb|An example of helping behavior]]
Media has also been shown to have an impact on promoting different types of social behavior, such as prosocial and aggressive behavior. For example, violence shown through the media has been seen to lead to more aggressive behavior in its viewers. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Craig A.|last2=Shibuya|first2=Akiko|last3=Ihori|first3=Nobuko|last4=Swing|first4=Edward L.|last5=Bushman|first5=Brad J.|last6=Sakamoto|first6=Akira|last7=Rothstein|first7=Hannah R.|last8=Saleem|first8=Muniba|date=2010|title=Violent video game effects on aggression, empathy, and prosocial behavior in Eastern and Western countries: A meta-analytic review.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0018251|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=136|issue=2|pages=151–173|doi=10.1037/a0018251|issn=1939-1455}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bushman|first=Brad J.|last2=Huesmann|first2=L.

Aggression is an important social behavior that can have both negative consequences (in a social interaction) and adaptive consequences (adaptive in humans and other primates for survival).

=== Social Anxiety Disorder ===
''Main Article:'' [[Social anxiety disorder|Social Anxiety Disorder]]

Social Anxiety Disorder is a phobic disorder characterized by a fear of being judged by others, which manifests itself as a fear of people in general. Due to this pervasive fear of embarrassing oneself in front of others, it causes those affected by this to avoid interactions with other people at all costs. &lt;ref name=":06"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2008-03-29|title=Social anxiety disorder|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673608604882|journal=The Lancet|language=en|volume=371|issue=9618|pages=1115–1125|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60488-2|issn=0140-6736}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who classify has having Social Anxiety Disorder typically have a low self-esteem due to be highly critical of themselves, and thus avoid contact for fear of being "exposed" as unlikable. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=Brian J.|last2=Fleet|first2=Claire|last3=Stein|first3=Murray B.|date=October 2004|title=Self-criticism and social phobia in the US national comorbidity survey|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2003.12.012|journal=Journal of Affective Disorders|volume=82|issue=2|pages=227–234|doi=10.1016/j.jad.2003.12.012|issn=0165-0327}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":06" /&gt; Efforts to find a neural correlates associated with Social Anxiety Disorder have turned to [[functional neuroimaging]], which has found that Social Anxiety Disorder is greatly associated with hyperactivity of the [[amygdala]], the brain area activated during fear. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Etkin|first=Amit|last2=Wager|first2=Tor D.|date=October 2007|title=Functional Neuroimaging of Anxiety: A Meta-Analysis of Emotional Processing in PTSD, Social Anxiety Disorder, and Specific Phobia|url=https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.07030504|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|language=en|volume=164|issue=10|pages=1476–1488|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.07030504|issn=0002-953X|pmc=3318959|pmid=17898336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder mainly identified by its symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.

=== Autism Spectrum Disorder ===
''Main Article:'' [[Autism spectrum|Autism Spectrum Disorder]]

Autism Spectrum Disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder that effects the functioning of social interaction and communication. People who fall on the autism spectrum scale may have difficulties in understanding social cues and the emotional states of others. Due to this, one may find it difficult to modulate behavior according to the situation, and acting according to the setting's standards. &lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/terminology/icd_10/en/|title=WHO {{!}} ICD-10 classification of mental and behavioural disorders|website=www.who.int|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along the spectrum of autism includes [[Asperger syndrome|Aspergers Syndrome]], which contains the atypical functioning of social interaction and communication seen in autism, but without a clinically significant delay on cognitive and language abilities. &lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2008-02-08|title=Structural Variation of Chromosomes in Autism Spectrum Disorder|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929707000353|journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics|language=en|volume=82|issue=2|pages=477–488|doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2007.12.009|issn=0002-9297}}&lt;/ref&gt;Research is still being done to investigate which brain regions are involved in Autism Spectrum Disorder. &lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2006-09-01|title=Autism spectrum disorders|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1476179306000449|journal=Psychiatry|language=en|volume=5|issue=9|pages=320–324|doi=10.1053/j.mppsy.2006.06.007|issn=1476-1793}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to abnormalities that often occur in Autism Spectrum Disorder, one who classifies as among the spectrum may have a series of symptoms, such as difficulty or inability to maintain eye-contact with another person, and communicate via face and body expression. One may have a hard time forming relationships with their peers, and have a difficult time forming mutual interests with others and sharing a common excitement in something. Language may be impaired to those on the low-end of the spectrum, which effects conversation and communication with others. &lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3544">In [[decision theory]], the '''sure-thing principle''' states that a decision maker who would take a certain action if he knew that event ''E'' has occurred, and also if he knew that the negation of ''E'' has occurred, should also take that same action if he knows nothing about ''E''.

The principle was coined by [[Leonard Jimmie Savage|L.J. Savage]]:&lt;ref&gt;Savage, L. J. (1954), ''The foundations of statistics''. John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=A businessman contemplates buying a certain piece of property. He considers the outcome of the next presidential election relevant. So, to clarify the matter to himself, he asks whether he would buy if he knew that the Democratic candidate were going to win, and decides that he would. Similarly, he considers whether he would buy if he knew that the Republican candidate were going to win, and again finds that he would. Seeing that he would buy in either event, he decides that he should buy, even though he does not know which event obtains, or will obtain, as we would ordinarily say. It is all  too seldom that a decision can be arrived at on the basis of this principle, but except possibly for the assumption of simple ordering, I know of no other extralogical principle governing decisions that finds such ready acceptance.|source=p. 21}}

He formulated the principle as a [[Strategic dominance|dominance principle]], but it can also be framed probabilistically.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Richard |last=Jeffrey |jstor=192456 |title=The Sure Thing Principle |journal=Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association |volume=2 |year=1982 |pages=719-730}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jeffrey&lt;ref name="Jeffrey" /&gt; and later Pearl&lt;ref name=pearl-causality2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pearl|first1=Judea|title=Causality: Models, Reasoning, and Inference|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that Savage's principle is only valid when the probability of the event considered (e.g., the winner of the election) is unaffected by the action (buying the property). Under such conditions, the sure-thing principle is a theorem in the ''do''-calculus&lt;ref name=pearl-causality2&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Bayes networks]]). Blyth&lt;ref name="blyth-72"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blyth|first1=C.|title=On Simpson's paradox and the sure-thing principle|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|date=1972|volume=67|pages=364–366|doi=10.2307/2284382}}&lt;/ref&gt; constructed a counterexample to the sure-thing principle using sequential sampling in the context of [[Simpson's paradox]], but this example violates the required action-independence provision.&lt;ref name=pearl-2015-r466&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pearl|first1=Judea|title=The sure-thing principle|url=http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r466.pdf|website=UCLA Cognitive Systems Laboratory, Technical Report R-466|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle is closely related to [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]], and equivalent under the axiom of truth (everything the agent knows is true).&lt;ref&gt;Samet, Dov.  [http://www.tau.ac.il/~samet/papers/the-sure-thing-principle.pdf "The sure-thing principle and independence of irrelevant knowledge". Israel Institute of Business Research, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is similarly targeted by the [[Ellsberg paradox|Ellsberg]] and [[Allais paradox|Allais paradoxes]], in which actual people's choices seem to violate this principle.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey" /&gt;

'''Tathātā''' ({{lang-sa|तथाता|tathātā}}; {{lang-pi|तथता|tathatā}}; {{bo|t=དེ་བཞིན་ཉིད་}}; {{zh|c=真如}}) is variously translated as "thusness" or "suchness".

The synonym '''dharmatā''' is also often used.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

While alive the Buddha referred to himself as the [[Tathāgata]], which can mean either "One who has thus come" or "One who has thus gone",&lt;ref&gt;Oxford dictionary of Buddhism; P296&lt;/ref&gt; and interpreted correctly can be read as "One who has arrived at suchness".

== Mahayana Buddhism ==
Tathātā in the East Asian Mahayana tradition is seen as representing the base reality and can be used to terminate the use of words. A 5th-century Chinese Mahayana scripture entitled "''[[Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana]]''" describes the concept more fully:
{{quote|In its very origin suchness is of itself endowed with sublime attributes. It manifests the highest wisdom which shines throughout the world, it has true knowledge and a mind resting simply in its own being. It is eternal, blissful, its own self-being and the purest simplicity; it is invigorating, immutable, free... Because it possesses all these attributes and is deprived of nothing, it is designated both as the Womb of Tathagata and the Dharma Body of Tathagata.&lt;ref name="Berry1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berry|first=Thomas|title=Religions of India: Hinduism, Yoga, Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ouWxrcybsxIC|year=1996|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-10781-5|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

R. H. Robinson, echoing [[D. T. Suzuki]], conveys how the ''[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]]'' perceives dharmata through the portal of [[śūnyatā]]: "The ''Laṅkāvatāra'' is  always   careful   to   balance Śūnyatā with Tathatā, or to insist that when the world is viewed as śūnya, empty, it is grasped  in its  suchness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robinson|first1=Richard H.|title=Some Logical Aspects of Nagarjuna's System|journal=Philosophy East &amp; West|date=1957|volume=6|issue=4|pages=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chan Buddhism ===

In Chan stories, tathātā is often best revealed in the seemingly mundane or meaningless, such as noticing the way the wind blows through a field of grass, or watching someone's face light up as they smile. According to Chan hagiography, [[Gautama Buddha]] transmitted the awareness of tathātā directly to [[Mahākāśyapa]] in what has come to be rendered in English as the [[Flower Sermon]]. In another story, the Buddha asked his disciples, "How long is a human life?" As none of them could offer the correct answer he told them "Life is but a breath".&lt;ref name="CaiBruya1994"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cai|first1=Zhizhong|last2=Bruya|first2=Brian|title=Zen Speaks: Shouts of Nothingness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TN4GAAAACAAJ|year=1994|publisher=Anchor Books|isbn=978-0-385-47257-9|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here we can see the Buddha expressing the impermanent nature of the world, where each individual moment is different from the last.

The Thiền master [[Thích Nhất Hạnh]] wrote, "People usually consider walking on water or in thin air a miracle. But I think the real miracle is not to walk either on water or in thin air, but to walk on earth.

The '''Tecopa pupfish''' (''Cyprinodon nevadensis calidae'') is an [[extinction|extinct]] subspecies of the Amargosa pupfish (''[[Cyprinodon nevadensis]]''). The small, heat-tolerant [[pupfish]] was [[endemism|endemic]] to the outflows of a pair of [[hot spring]]s in the [[Mojave Desert]] of [[California]]. Habitat modifications and the introduction of non-native species led to its extinction in about 1970.

==Taxonomy==
The Tecopa pupfish is member of the genus ''[[Cyprinodon]]''  of the pupfish family Cyprinodontidae, a taxon of [[killifish]] most diverse in [[North America]].  Most [[divergent evolution|divergence]] of local ''Cyprinodon'' species likely took place during the early-to-mid [[Pleistocene]], a time when [[pluvial lake]]s intermittently filled the now-desert region, though some may have occurred during the last 10,000 years. The evaporation of the lakes resulted in the [[geographic isolation]] of small ''Cyprinodon'' populations in remnant wetlands and the [[speciation]] of ''C. nevadensis''.&lt;ref name=moyle /&gt;

''C. n. calidae'' was first described as a subspecies in 1948 by [[Robert Rush Miller]],&lt;ref name=noecker /&gt; after six years of study.&lt;ref name=saar /&gt;  Miller also identified five other subspecies: the [[Cyprinodon nevadensis amargosae|Amargosa River pupfish]] (''C. n. amargosae''), the [[Ash Meadows pupfish]] (''C. n. mionectes''), the [[Saratoga Springs pupfish]] (''C. n. nevadensis''), the [[Warm Springs pupfish]] (''C. n. pectoralis''), and the [[Shoshone pupfish]] (''C. n. shoshone'').&lt;ref name=itis /&gt;

Other local ''Cyprinodons'' include the [[Death Valley pupfish]] (''Cyprinodon salinus''), the [[Devil's Hole pupfish]], (''Cyprinodon diabolis'') the desert pupfish (''[[Cyprinodon macularius]]'') and the [[Owens pupfish]] (''Cyprinodon radiosus'').

==Description and behavior==
[[File:Tecopapupfish.png|thumb|left|A Tecopa pupfish]] 
The fish were about 1–1.5&amp;nbsp;inches (2.5–4&amp;nbsp;cm) in length. The [[dorsal fin]] was positioned closer to the tail than the head.  The [[pelvic fin]] was small or sometimes absent, and had six [[lepidotrichia]].  Similar to some other ''Cyprinodons'', breeding males displayed a bright blue coloration.  Females had between six and ten vertical stripes.&lt;ref name=cadfg /&gt;

''C. n. calidae'' primarily ate [[cyanobacteria]] (blue-green algae). Invertebrates such as [[mosquito#Larva|mosquito larvae]] provided occasional nutrition.&lt;ref name=cadfg /&gt;  The fish were capable of surviving water temperatures of 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43&amp;nbsp;°C)&lt;ref name=levitt /&gt; or more.&lt;ref name=miller /&gt;

==Decline and extinction==
Tecopa Hot Springs lies at an elevation of 1,411 feet (430 m), about 2 miles north of the town of [[Tecopa, California|Tecopa]] in [[Inyo County, California]].&lt;ref name=gnis /&gt; The outflows of the two [[hot spring]]s are tributaries of the [[Amargosa River]], and were the only place where ''C. n. calidae'' existed.&lt;ref name=levitt /&gt;

The popularity of the springs in the 1950s and 1960s led to the extensive alteration of the pupfishes' habitat.  During the construction of bathhouses, the hot spring pools were enlarged and the outflows diverted.&lt;ref name=miller /&gt;  In 1965, the outflows of the northern and southern hot springs were re-channeled and merged. The resulting swifter currents caused downstream water temperatures to rise above a level to which the pupfish were adapted.&lt;ref name=levitt /&gt; Modifications also allowed the related [[Amargosa River pupfish]] (''C. n. amargosae'') to migrate upstream from the Amargosa River and [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]ize with the Tecopa pupfish.&lt;ref name=miller /&gt;

In 1966, Miller found that the population at Tecopa Hot Springs was nearly extinct. A population was found at a reservoir at a nearby motel two years later, but its smaller scales suggested that it may have already hybridized with the [[Cyprinodon nevadensis amargosae|Amargosa River pupfish]].&lt;ref name=miller2 /&gt; In 1970, concerns over this habitat alteration and the presence of non-native species such as the [[bluegill]] and the [[gambusia affinis|western mosquitofish]] led to its inclusion in both Federal and California lists of endangered species.&lt;ref name=noecker /&gt;

The last confirmed specimens of ''C. n. calidae'' were collected on February 2, 1970, and the subspecies was probably extinct by the next year.&lt;ref name=miller /&gt; Further surveys in 1972 and 1977 returned no examples of the fish.&lt;ref name=miller /&gt; In 1978, [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] announced that it was considering delisting the fish, with Assistant [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] Robert L. Herbst calling the loss  "totally avoidable" and saying, "The human projects which so disrupted its habitat, if carefully planned, could have ensured its survival."&lt;ref name=levitt2 /&gt; In 1981, after an exhaustive search of over 40 locations, the Fish and Wildlife Service officially declared the fish extinct.  It was the first animal removed from the provisions of the 1973 [[Endangered Species Act]] as a result of its extinction.&lt;ref name=levitt /&gt;

In [[musical tuning]] and [[harmony]], the '''Tonnetz''' ({{lang-de|tone-network}}) is a conceptual [[Lattice (music)|lattice]] [[diagram]] representing tonal space first described by [[Leonhard Euler]] in 1739.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; Various visual representations of the ''Tonnetz'' can be used to show [[Tonality|traditional harmonic relationships]] in European classical music.

==History through 1900==
[[Image:Eulers tonnetz.png|thumb|left|Euler's Tonnetz.]]

The ''Tonnetz'' originally appeared in Euler's 1739 ''Tentamen novae theoriae musicae ex certissismis harmoniae principiis dilucide expositae''. Euler's Tonnetz, pictured at left, shows the triadic relationships of the perfect fifth and the major third: at the top of the image is the note F, and to the left underneath is C (a perfect fifth above F), and to the right is A (a major third above F). The space was rediscovered in 1858 by Ernst Naumann, and was disseminated in an 1866 treatise of [[Arthur von Oettingen]]. Oettingen and the influential musicologist [[Hugo Riemann]] (not to be confused with the mathematician [[Bernhard Riemann]]) explored the capacity of the space to chart harmonic motion between chords and modulation between keys. Similar understandings of the ''Tonnetz'' appeared in the work of many late-19th century German music theorists.&lt;ref name="cohnintro"&gt;{{cite journal
|last1=Cohn|first1=Richard
|title=Introduction to Neo-Riemannian Theory: A Survey and a Historical Perspective
|journal=Journal of Music Theory|year=1998|volume=42|issue=2 Autumn|pages=167–180|ref=harv|jstor=843871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oettingen and Riemann both conceived of the relationships in the chart being defined through [[just intonation]], which uses pure intervals. One can extend out one of the horizontal rows of the Tonnetz indefinitely, to form a never-ending sequence of perfect fifths: F-C-G-D-A-E-B-F#-C#-G#-D#-A#-E#-B#-Fx-Cx-Gx- (etc.) Starting with F, after 12 perfect fifths, one reaches E#. Perfect fifths in just intonation are slightly larger than the compromised fifths used in [[equal temperament]] tuning systems more common in the present. This means that when one stacks 12 fifths starting from F, the E# we arrive at will not be exactly seven octaves above the F we started with. Oettingen and Riemann's ''Tonnetz'' thus extended on infinitely in every direction without actually repeating any pitches.

The appeal of the ''Tonnetz'' to 19th-century German theorists was that it allows spatial representations of tonal distance and tonal relationships. For example, looking at the dark blue A minor triad in the graphic at the beginning of the article, its parallel major triad (A-C#-E) is the triangle right below, sharing the vertices A and E. The relative major of A minor, C major (C-E-G) is the upper-right adjacent triangle, sharing the C and the E vertices. The dominant triad of A minor, E major (E-G#-B) is diagonally across the E vertex, and shares no other vertices. One important point is that every shared vertex between a pair of triangles is a shared pitch between chords - the more shared vertices, the more shared pitches the chord will have. This provides a visualization of the principle of parsimonious voice-leading, in which motions between chords are considered smoother when fewer pitches change. This principle is especially important in analyzing the music of late-19th century composers like Wagner, who frequently avoided traditional tonal relationships. &lt;ref name="cohnintro"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twentieth-century reinterpretation==
{{main|Neo-Riemannian theory}}
[[Image:PLR on tonnetz.png|thumb|right|Neo-Riemannian music theory's PLR operations applied to a minor chord&amp;nbsp;Q.]]

Recent research by [[Neo-Riemannian theory|Neo-Riemannian]] music theorists [[David Lewin]], Brian Hyer, and others, have revived the ''Tonnetz'' to further explore properties of pitch structures. &lt;ref name="cohnintro"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Modern music theorists generally construct the ''Tonnetz'' using [[equal temperament]],&lt;ref name="cohnintro"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and using pitch-classes, which make no distinction between octave transpositions of a pitch. Under equal temperament, the never-ending series of ascending fifths mentioned earlier becomes a cycle. Neo-Riemannian theorists typically assume enharmonic equivalence (in other words, Ab&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;G#), and so the two-dimensional plane of the 19th-century ''Tonnetz'' cycles in on itself in two different directions, and is mathematically [[isomorphic]] to a [[torus]]. Theorists have studied the structure of this new cyclical version using mathematical [[group theory]]{{citation needed|reason=Which theorists?|date=March 2016}}.

Neo-Riemannian theorists have also used the ''Tonnetz'' to visualize non-tonal triadic relationships. For example, the diagonal going up and to the left from C in the diagram at the beginning of the article forms a division of the octave in three [[major third]]s: C-Ab-E-C (the E is actually an Fb, and the final C a Dbb). Richard Cohn argues that while a sequence of triads built on these three pitches (C major, Ab major, and E major) cannot be adequately described using traditional concepts of functional harmony, this cycle has smooth voice leading and other important group properties which can be easily observed on the ''Tonnetz''. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohn|first=Richard|title=Maximally Smooth Cycles, Hexatonic Systems, and the Analysis of Late-Romantic Triadic Progressions|journal=Music Analysis|date=March 1996|volume=15|issue=1|pages=9–40|doi=10.2307/854168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similarities to other graphical systems==
The [[harmonic table note layout]] is a recently{{when|date=May 2012}} developed musical interface that uses a note layout topologically equivalent to the Tonnetz.

A ''Tonnetz'' of the [[syntonic temperament]] can be derived from a given [[isomorphic keyboard]] by connecting lines of successive [[perfect fifth]]s, lines of successive [[major third]]s, and lines of successive [[minor third]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The [[topology]] of the [[syntonic temperament]]'s Tonnetz is generally [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]].

[[Image:Chord Lattice.jpg|thumb|right|Tonnetz showing enclosed chords. Capitalized chords ('Xx') are major; others ('xx') are minor.]]

The ''Tonnetz'' is the [[dual graph]] of [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]]'s '''chart of the regions''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''transmediale''' is an annual festival for [[art]] and [[Cyberculture|digital culture]] in Berlin, usually held over five days at the end of January and the beginning of February. The 2017 edition marked its 30-year anniversary. 

A conference, varying exhibition formats, a film and video program, performances, and workshops build its programmatic core. Simultaneously and in cooperation with transmediale, [[CTM Festival]] (formerly club transmediale, renamed in 2011) offers an annual platform for experimental and electronic music. Once a side event of transmediale, it is now organized and curated independently. Throughout the year, transmediale is also involved in a number of long- and short-term cooperative projects via transmediale/resource.

== History ==
transmediale was founded in 1988 under the name of VideoFilmFest (VideoFest as of 1989) within the framework of [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlinale]], as a side event of the Internationales Forum des Jungen Films section. Its founders, Hartmut Horst and video artist and activist [[Micky Kwella]], sought to create a platform for electronic media productions, which were excluded from classic film festivals such as Berlinale. Over the course of the following 30 years, the festival evolved steadily and independently of Berlinale: from its initial focus on video culture it turned to cultivating an artistic and critical dialogue with television and multimedia, eventually emerging as a leading international platform for media art. In 1997, its name was changed to transmedia, and finally to transmediale in 1998. The change reflected the programmatic extension of the festival, which by then encompassed a broad spectrum of [[multimedia]] art forms such as [[Internet art|Internet]] and [[Software art|Software Art]].

In 2001, transmediale underwent far-reaching structural changes; further additions to the program and a new venue, [[Haus der Kulturen der Welt]], led to a continuous increase in attendance. transmediale.02 was the first edition to feature an extensive exhibition in which media art could be experienced in a sensuous and physical way. In 2006, the festival’s subheading changed from “international media art festival” to “festival for art and digital culture”—a decision reflective of a shift towards a more open approach that would include art, technology, and everyday life in an increasingly digitalized world instead of the previous, narrower focus on media art alone.

The transmediale Award was introduced in 2001 to honour visionary works and projects centering around technology-led societies. In order to do justice to the rising number of submissions of theoretical works, the competition was complemented by the Vilém Flusser Theory Award at transmediale.08. Named after philosopher and media theorist [[Vilém Flusser]], it promoted “outstanding, media-theoretical and research-based artworks” until 2011. In 2012, it was converted into a residency program for artistic research; the transmediale Award and Open Web Award were discontinued.

In addition, club transmediale was founded as a side event of transmediale in 1999. Since then, [[CTM Festival|CTM]] has developed into an independent festival that presents electronic and experimental music in various Berlin venues once a year.

== Organisation ==
transmediale was founded by Hartmut Horst and Micky Kwella in 1988. From 2001 to 2007, art historian and curator Andreas Broeckmann took over the artistic direction of the festival. He was superseded by media and arts researcher Stephen Kovats, who led transmediale until 2011. As of April 2011, curator and media researcher Kristoffer Gansing has been the artistic director of the festival. 

Since 2004, Kulturstiftung des Bundes has been funding transmediale (alongside documenta, Berlin Biennale and others) as a Beacon of Contemporary Culture. The host organization of the festival is Kulturprojekte Berlin GmbH, which was operated under the name of Kulturveranstaltungs-GmbH until 2005.

In 2011, transmediale/resource was established as a framework for transmediale’s year-round activities. Its aim is to provide a sustainable structure for feedback, research, and reflection beyond the timeframe of the festival. In addition to varying cooperative projects and network activities, transmediale/resource includes the Vilém Flusser Residency Program for Artistic Research, online publication format transmediale/journal and pre-festival program Vorspiel, presented in collaboration with CTM and a network of organizations, galleries, independent project spaces, and venues all over Berlin.

== Places ==
Until 1992, VideoFilmFest took place at MedienOperative as well as Deutsche Akademie der Künste in East Berlin. In 1993, it moved to Podewil, which is also where the transmediale offices have been located since 1997. From 2002 to 2005, Haus der Kulturen der Welt became the festival’s main location. In 2006, transmediale relocated to [[Academy of Arts, Berlin|Akademie der Künste]], only to return to [[Haus der Kulturen der Welt]] in 2008, where it has remained since.

'''Tunnel vision''' &lt;!-- WHAT ABOUT 'KALNIENK VISION" YOU MAY ASK? "KALNIENK VISION" WAS ADDED BY AN ANONYMOUS VANDAL IN 2010 AND HAS SNUCK ITS WAY ONTO THE INTERNET WHEN THIS ARTICLE WAS COPIED PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T NOTICE THAT IT WAS VANDALISM. IF YOU WANT TO RESTORE 'KALNIENK VISION' TO THIS ARTICLE, GET ME PROOF THAT IT WAS USED PRIOR TO 2010. --&gt;is the loss of [[peripheral vision]] with retention of central vision, resulting in a constricted circular [[tunnel]]-like [[visual field|field of vision]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=24514 Medical terms]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
Tunnel vision can be caused by:
{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|
* [[Glaucoma]], a disease of the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Glaucoma: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|url = https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001620.htm|website = www.nlm.nih.gov|access-date = 2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Retinitis pigmentosa]], a disease of the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Retinitis pigmentosa|url = http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/retinitis-pigmentosa|website = Genetics Home Reference|date = 2016-02-15|access-date = 2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Blood loss ([[hypovolemia]])
* Alcohol consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.wright.edu/bie/rehabengr/vision/visionalcohol.htm Effects of Alcohol on Vision] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008100320/http://www.cs.wright.edu/bie/rehabengr/vision/visionalcohol.htm |date=2006-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the vision becomes blurred or double since eye muscles lose their precision causing them to be unable to focus on the same object.
* Sustained (1 second or more) high accelerations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051123000128/http://www.vnh.org/FSManual/02/02SustainedAcceleration.html Web Archive: Virtual Naval Hospital]&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, flying an airplane with a centripetal acceleration of up to or over 39&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (4gs) with the head towards the center of curvature, common in aerobatic or fighter pilots. In these cases, tunnel vision and [[greyout (medical)|greyout]] may proceed to a ''g''-force induced Loss Of Consciousness [[G-LOC|(''g''-LOC)]].
* [[Psychedelics, Dissociatives and Deliriants|Hallucinogenic]] drugs, in particular the [[dissociative]]s.
* Extreme fear or distress, most often in the context of a [[panic attack]].
* Excitement or extreme [[pleasure]] such as on a roller-coaster, causing a surge of adrenaline in the body.
* During periods of high [[epinephrine|adrenaline]] production, such as an intense [[hand-to-hand combat|physical fight]].
* [[Altitude sickness]], [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] in passenger aircraft&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061005203309/http://www.house.gov/transportation/aviation/06-05-03/friend.html Web Archive: Aircraft air quality]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Exposure to oxygen at a partial pressure above 1.5-2 atmospheres, producing central nervous system oxygen toxicity, called narcosis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051122223954/http://www.vnh.org/FSManual/01/10OxygenToxic.html Web Archive: Virtual Naval Hospital, Oxygen Toxity]&lt;/ref&gt; Other symptoms can include dizziness, nausea, blindness, fatigue, anxiety, confusion and lack of coordination.
* [[Pituitary adenoma|Pituitary tumours]] (or other brain tumours that compress the [[optic chiasm]])
* Prolonged exposure to air contaminated with heated [[hydraulic fluids]] and oils, as can sometimes happen in passenger aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061005203309/http://www.house.gov/transportation/aviation/06-05-03/friend.html Web Archive: Aircraft air quality]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Severe [[cataract]]s, causing a removal of most of the field of vision
* During the [[Migraine#Aura phase|aura phase of a migraine]]
* Intense anger, due to the body being rapidly flooded with adrenaline and oxygen
* A bite from a [[black mamba]] and other snakes with the same strength venom.
* Mercury poisoning (especially [[methylmercury]])
* Sleep deprivation

==Eyeglass users==
[[Eyeglass]] users experience tunnel vision to varying degrees due to the [[corrective lens]] only providing a small area of proper focus, with the rest of the field of view beyond the lenses being unfocused and blurry. Where a naturally sighted person only needs to move their eyes to see an object far to the side or far down, the eyeglass wearer may need to move their whole head to point the eyeglasses towards the target object.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The eyeglass frame also blocks the view of the world with a thin opaque boundary separating the lens area from the rest of the field of view. The eyeglass frame is capable of obscuring small objects and details in the peripheral field.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Mask, goggle, and helmet users==
[[File:US Navy 050727-N-0295M-010 Electrician's Mate 2nd Class Shane Portton emerges out of the Navy Diver-Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) dive tank exhibit at the 2005 National Scout Jamboree held at Fort A.P. Hill, Va.jpg|thumb|200px|Wide-field, wrap-around diving mask]]

Activities which require a protective mask, safety goggles, or fully enclosing protective helmet can also result in an experience approximating tunnel vision. Underwater [[diving mask]]s using a single flat transparent lens usually have the lens surface several centimeters from the eyes. The lens is typically enclosed with an opaque black rubber sealing shell to keep out water. For this type of mask the peripheral field of the diver is extremely limited. Generally, the peripheral field of a diving mask is improved if the lenses are as close to the eye as possible, or if the lenses are large, multi-window, or is a curved wrap-around design.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Protective helmets such as a [[welding helmet]] restrict vision to an extremely small slot or hole, with no peripheral perception at all. This is done out of necessity so that [[ultraviolet radiation]] emitted from the [[welding arc]] does not damage the welder's eyes due to reflections off shiny objects in the peripheral field.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

== Optical instruments ==
[[Binoculars]], [[telescope]]s, and [[microscope]]s induce an experience of extreme tunnel vision due to the design of the optical components. A wide field microscope or telescope generally requires much larger diameter and thicker lenses, or complex parabolic mirror assemblies, either of which results in significantly greater cost for construction of the optical device.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Wide-field binoculars are possible, but require bulkier, heavier, and more complex eyepieces. The diameter of the objective lenses is unimportant for field of view.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.meade.com/support/selbinoc.html&lt;/ref&gt; The widest-angle eyepieces used in telescopes are so large that two would not fit side-by-side for use in binoculars.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}
