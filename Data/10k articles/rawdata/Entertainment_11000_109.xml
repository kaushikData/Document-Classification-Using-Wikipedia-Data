[[Image:Ballet barre.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A ballet dancer doing barre exercises at a portable barre. A permanent barre can be seen in the reflected background, mounted to the wall, to the right.]]

A '''barre''' ({{IPA-fr|baʁ}}) is a stationary [[handrail]] that provides support for people during various types of exercise. Barres are used extensively in [[ballet]] training and [[warming up|warm up]] exercises, where such exercises are commonly referred to as ''barre work''. In a ballet class, '''barre''' may also refer to the part of the class that involves barre work. Barres are also used for warm up exercises in other types of dance, as well as in general fitness programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=barre | url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/barre | website=thefreedictionary.com|publisher=Farlex|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
The design of a barre—which includes both the handrail and its support mechanism—depends on whether the barre is to be portable or permanently located. A permanent barre typically consists of a handrail that is mounted to and supported by a wall, whereas a portable barre consists of a handrail mounted onto a rigid or adjustable, free-standing supporting structure. Some barres have two parallel handrails at different heights to accommodate people of differing heights. Barre handrails and supports are typically made of metal, wood, plastic, or a combination of these materials.

==Exercises==

===Ballet===

In ballet, barre work includes both slow and fast exercises, which both serve to strengthen muscles. Slow exercises are typically performed first, to stretch and warm up muscles, and to focus on proper body form, whereas fast exercises condition dancers to maintain precise [[ballet technique]] while moving. Each exercise has a specific purpose, such as to strengthen feet and legs, increase extension, improve flexibility, and develop [[ballon (ballet)|ballon]]. Proper form (posture, [[positions of the feet in ballet|positions of feet]] and [[positions of the arms in ballet|arms]]) is strived for in all exercises.

A barre helps dancers by providing a means of stability and balance and, consequently, barre work often comprises a significant portion of the beginning dancer's class. It is an essential tool when first learning foot placement technique, and also for beginning [[pointe]] dancers, who have not yet developed the strength and technique needed for pointe work. The barre continues to be an important tool in all levels of ballet. Barre work helps dancers prepare for [[partnering (dance)|partnering]], with the barre simulating the support of a real partner.

===General fitness===
{{main article|Barre (exercise)}}
When used for promoting general fitness, barre exercises may incorporate a wide variety of activities to increase stamina, flexibility and strength, including ballet movements that require balance and stimulate the core such as [[plié]]s and [[pirouette]]s.

Barre classes have become a popularized form of exercise. A barre class includes the use of the barre as a tool for repetitions of small, pulsing movements with emphasis on form, alignment and core engagement.&lt;ref name="Huffington"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/14/are-barre-classes-worth-the-buzz_n_925538.html|title = Are Barre Classes Worth The Buzz? We Tried It|website = The Huffington Post|access-date = 2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devices such as yoga straps, exercise balls and hand weights are sometimes used during barre classes. Barre classes draw from yoga as well as dance and pilates and focus on breath and the mind-body connection.&lt;ref name="Huffington" /&gt;

[[File:Victor Wooten 2.jpg| thumb |[[Victor Wooten]] performing on the electric bass. ]]
A '''bassline''' (also known as a '''bass line''' or '''bass part''') is the term used in many styles of music, such as [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[funk]], [[Dub music|dub]] and [[electronic music|electronic]], traditional [[music]], or classical music for the low-pitched [[Part (music)|instrumental part]] or line played (in jazz and some forms of popular music) by a [[rhythm section]] instrument such as the [[bass guitar|electric bass]], [[double bass]], [[cello]], [[tuba]] or keyboard ([[piano]], [[Hammond organ]], electric organ, or synthesizer). In unaccompanied solo performance, basslines may simply be played in the lower [[register (music)|register]] of any instrument such as [[guitar]] or piano while [[melody]] and/or further [[accompaniment]] is provided in the middle or upper register. In solo music for piano and pipe organ, these instruments have an excellent lower register that can be used to play a deep bassline. On organs, the bass line is typically played using the [[pedal keyboard]] and massive 16' and 32' bass pipes.

Basslines in [[Pop music|popular music]] often use [[ostinato#Riff|"riffs"]] or "[[groove (music)|grooves]]", which are usually simple, appealing musical motifs or phrases that are repeated, with variation, throughout the song. "The bass differs from other voices because of the particular role it plays in supporting and defining harmonic motion. It does so at levels ranging from immediate, chord-by-chord events to the larger harmonic organization of {{sic|a}} entire work."&lt;ref&gt;Cadwallader, Allen (1998). ''Analysis of Tonal Music: A Schenkerian Approach'', p. 45. {{ISBN|0195102320}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bassline riffs usually emphasize the chord tones of each chord (usually the root note, the third note, or the fifth note), which helps to define a song's key. At the same time, basslines work along with the drum part and the other rhythm instruments to create a clear rhythmic pulse.

The type of rhythmic pulse used in basslines varies widely in different types of music. In [[Swing music|swing]] jazz and [[jump blues]], basslines are often created from a continuous sequence of quarter notes in a mostly scalar, stepwise or arpeggio-based part called a "[[#Walking bass|walking bass]] line". In [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]], [[salsa music]], [[jazz fusion]], [[reggae]], [[electronica]], and some types of  [[rock music|rock]] and [[metal music|metal]], basslines may be very rhythmically complex and [[syncopation|syncopated]]. In bluegrass and traditional country music, basslines often emphasize the root and fifth of each chord.  
[[File:Fotothek df roe-neg 0006311 021 Musiker mit einem Kontrabass.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A German double bass section in 1952. The player to the left is using a German bow.]]
Though basslines may be played by many different types of [[musical instrument|instrument]]s and in a broad musical [[Range (music)|range]], they are generally played on [[Bass (instrument)|bass instruments]] and in the range roughly at least an [[octave]] and a half below [[middle C]] (roughly the range of the [[bass clef]]). In [[European classical music|classical music]] such as string quartets and symphonies, basslines play the same harmonic and rhythmic role; however, they are usually referred to as the "bass voice" or the "bass part".

==Instruments==
Most popular musical ensembles include an instrument capable of playing bass notes. In the 1890s, a [[tuba]] was often used.  From the 1920s to the 1940s, most popular music groups used the [[double bass]] as the bass instrument. Starting in the 1950s, the [[bass guitar]] began to replace the double bass in most types of popular music, such as rock and roll, blues, and folk. The bass guitar was easier to transport and, given that it uses magnetic pickups, easier to amplify to loud stage volumes without the risk of [[audio feedback]], a common problem with the amplified double bass. By the 1970s and 1980s, the electric bass was used in most rock bands and [[jazz fusion]] groups. The double bass was still used in some types of popular music that recreated styles from the 1940s and 1950s such as [[jazz]] (especially swing and [[bebop]]), traditional 1950s [[blues]], [[jump blues]], [[country music|country]], and [[rockabilly]].

In some popular music bands, keyboard instruments are used to play the bass line. In [[organ trio]]s, for example, a [[Hammond organ]] player performs the basslines using the organ's [[pedal keyboard]]. In some types of popular music, such as [[hip-hop]] or [[house music]], the bass lines are played using [[bass synthesizer]]s, sequencers, or electro-acoustically modeled samples of basslines.

[[File:TB303 Front View.jpg|right|thumb|330px.jpg|TB-303 front panel]] 
Basslines are important in many forms of [[dance music|dance]] and [[electronic music]], such as [[electro (music)|electro]], [[drum and bass]], [[dubstep]], and most forms of [[house music|house]] and [[trance music|trance]]. In these genres, basslines are almost always performed on [[synthesizers]], either physical, such as the [[Minimoog]] and the [[Roland TB-303]], or [[softsynth|virtual]], such as [[Sytrus]] and [[ZynAddSubFX]]. In [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], producer [[Rick Rubin]] popularized the technique of creating basslines by lengthening the bass drum decay of the [[Roland TR-808|TR-808]] drum machine and tuning it to different pitches.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/8-ways-the-808-drum-machine-changed-pop-music-w453714|title=8 ways the 808 drum machine changed pop music|last=Leight|first=Elias|date=6 December 2016|work=|newspaper=Rolling Stone|access-date=16 January 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chinese orchestra]]s use the zhōng ruǎn (中阮) and dà ruǎn (大阮) for creating basslines. Other, less common bass instruments are the lā ruǎn (拉阮), dī yīn gé hú (低音革胡), and da dī hú (大低胡) developed during the 1930s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Russian [[balalaika]] orchestra use bass balalaika and contrabass balalaika.

Australia's indigenous music and some [[World music]] that is influenced by Australian music uses [[didjeridus]] for basslines.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Classical music===
[[File:BeethovenSymphonyNo5Mvt3Opening.png|thumb|300px|The opening of Beethoven's Symphony No. 5, third movement is often used as an orchestral excerpt during bass [[audition]]s. {{audio|BeethovenSymphonyNo5Mvt3Opening.mid|Play}}]]

In [[classical music]], the bassline is always written out for the performers in [[musical notation]]. In [[orchestra]]l  repertoire, the basslines are played by the [[double bass]]es and [[cello]]s in the [[string section]], by [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]]s, and [[bass clarinet]]s in the woodwinds and by [[bass trombone]]s, [[tuba]]s and a variety of other low brass instruments. In symphonies from the Classical period, a single bassline was often written for the cellos and basses; however, since the bass is a transposing instrument, and it is notated an octave higher than it sounds, when cellos and basses play the same bassline, the line is performed in octaves, with the basses an octave below the cellos. By the end of the Classical period, with Beethoven's symphonies, cellos and double basses were often given separate parts. In general, the more complex passages and rapid note sequences are given to the cellos, while the basses play a simpler bassline. The [[timpani]] (or kettledrums) also play a role in orchestral basslines, albeit confined in 17th and early 18th century works to a few notes, often the tonic and the dominant below it. In a small number of symphonies, the [[pipe organ]] is used to play basslines.

In [[chamber music]], the bassline is played by the cello in string quartets and the bassoon in wind chamber music. In some larger chamber music works, both a cello and a double bass are used to play the bassline. In a Baroque era (ca. 1600-1750) piece accompanied by [[basso continuo]], the accompanying musicians would include a chordal instrument (e.g., [[harpsichord]], [[pipe organ]] or [[lute]]) and a number of bass instruments might perform the same bassline, such as the cello, [[viol]], double bass, [[theorbo]], [[serpent (instrument)|serpent]] (an early wind instrument), and, if an organist was present, the lower manual of the organ and the low-pitched [[pedal keyboard]]. In 2000s-era performances of Baroque music, the basso continuo is typically performed by just two instruments: a chordal instrument and one bass instrument (often harpsichord and cello).

==Popular music==

In many genres of modern [[traditional music]] (ranging from [[folk rock]] to blues) and popular music (ranging from rock and pop to reggae to funk), the bassline is generally played by an [[bass guitar|electric bass]] player. In [[rockabilly]], [[psychobilly]], traditional blues and [[bluegrass music]], the bassline is played by a [[double bass]] player. The bassline uses low notes that provide a rhythm while simultaneously setting out the foundation of the [[chord progression]]. The bassline bridges the gap between the rhythmic part played by the drummer and the melodic lines played by the [[lead guitar]]ist and the chordal parts played by the [[rhythm guitar]]ist and/or keyboard player. In most traditional and popular music styles, the bass player is expected to be able to [[musical improvisation|improvise]] a bassline which they base in the [[chord progression]] of a song. When a bassist is playing a [[cover song]], they may play the bassline that was originally used on the recording. A [[session musician|session bassist]] playing in a music studio is expected to be able to read a bassline written in [[musical notation]]. Bass players also perform [[fill (music)|fills]] in between the phrases of the vocal melody, and they may also perform [[bass run]]s or bass breaks, which are short solo sections. Rhythmic variations by the bass, such as the introduction of a syncopated figure can dramatically change the feel of a song, even for a simple groove.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In any style, the bass's role in the [[Groove (popular music)|groove]] is the same: to keep time and to outline the tonality. When developing bass lines, these two things should always be your goal"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Santerre|2001|p=iv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{quote|[One] may view in it [(the bass part)] all the other parts in their original essence.[[Thomas Campion]] 1967:327&lt;ref name="Perlman"/&gt;}}

==Walking bass==
&lt;!-- Linked from redirect Walking bass --&gt;
A '''walking bass''' is a style of bass accompaniment or line, common in [[Baroque music]] (1600-1750) and 20th century [[jazz]], [[blues]] and [[rockabilly]], which creates a feeling of regular quarter note movement, akin to the regular alternation of feet while [[walking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buelow|2004|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Friedland| 1995|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus walking basslines generally consist of [[syncopation|unsyncopated]] [[musical notation|notes]] of equal value, usually [[quarter note]]s (known in jazz as a "four feel"). Walking basslines use a mixture of [[Musical scale|scale]] tones, [[arpeggio]]s, chromatic runs, and [[passing tone]]s to outline the [[chord progression]] of a song or tune, often with a melodic shape that alternately rises and falls in pitch over several bars.  To add variety to a walking bassline, bassists periodically interpolate various fills, such as playing scale or arpeggio fragments in swung eighth notes, plucking muted percussive grace notes (either one grace note or a "raked" sequence of two or three grace notes), or holding notes for two, three, or four beats. Some songs lend themselves to another type of variation: the [[pedal point]], in which the bassist holds or repeats a single note (often the tonic or the dominant) under the chord changes.

Walking basslines are usually performed on the [[double bass]] or the [[bass guitar|electric bass]], but they can also be performed using the low register of a [[piano]], [[Hammond organ]], [[tuba]] or other instruments. They can also be sung, as is done by some a capella vocal groups. While walking bass lines are most commonly associated with jazz and blues, they are also used in [[Rock music|rock]], [[rockabilly]], [[ska]], [[R&amp;B]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]], [[Country music|country]], and many other genres.&lt;ref name="Building"&gt;{{harvnb|Friedland|1995|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples ===
Walking bass in the [[pedal keyboard]] part of Baroque organ music (J.S. Bach's ''[[Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland]]'', BWV 659, from the [[Great Eighteen Chorale Preludes]]):

&lt;!--this image displayed wider than 500px for clarity--&gt;
[[File:Excerpt-BWV659.png|700px]]
:{{Audio|Organ-BWV659.mid|play}}

Other walking bass lines can be heard in the opening movements of [[Joseph Haydn]]'s [[Symphony No. 22 (Haydn)|Symphony No. 22]] (nicknamed "The Philosopher"), [[Anton Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 5 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 5]] and [[Edward Elgar]]'s [[Symphony No. 1 (Elgar)|Symphony No. 1]].[[File:Haydn Symphony 22 first movement.wav|thumb|Haydn Symphony 22 opening]][[File:Haydn Symphony 23 opening.png|thumb|center|500px|Haydn Symphony 22 opening]]

[[File:Bruckner Symphony No. 5, opening.wav|thumb|Bruckner Symphony No. 5, opening]][[File:Bruckner Symphony No. 6, opening.png|thumb|center|500px|Bruckner Symphony No. 5, opening]]

[[File:Elgar Symphony No 1 opening.wav|thumb|Elgar Symphony No 1 opening]][[File:Elgar Symphony No 1 opening.png|thumb|center|500px|Elgar Symphony No 1 opening]]

Walking bass often alternates quarter notes:

&lt;score&gt;\relative c' \repeat volta 2{ c g c g c g b a g d' g, d' g, d' e d}&lt;/score&gt;
:{{Audio|Walking bass I-V.mid|play}}

giving rise to the term.

Many [[boogie-woogie bass]]lines are walking bass lines:

[[File:"Texas &amp; Pacific" boogie woogie bass.svg|500px|Typical boogie woogie walking bassline]]
:{{audio|"Texas &amp; Pacific" boogie woogie bass.mid|Play in G}} or {{audio|Twelve bar boogie-woogie blues in C.mid|in C}}

Walking bass often moves in stepwise (scalar) motion to successive [[root (chord)|chord root]]s, such as often in [[country music]]:

[[File:Walking bass I-IV.PNG|400px|Walking bass I-IV]]

:{{audio|Walking bass I-IV.mid|Play}}

In this example, the last two quarter notes of the second measure, D and E, "walk" up from the first quarter note in that measure, C, to the first note of the third measure, F (C and F are the roots of the chords in the first through second and third through fourth measures, respectively).

In both cases, "walking" refers both to the steady duple rhythm (one step after the other) and to the strong directional motion created;&lt;ref name="Building"/&gt; in the examples above, from C to F and back in the second, and from root to seventh and back in the first.

In [[bebop]] jazz, the walking bass has a stabilising effect, offsetting and providing a foil to the complexity of the improvised melodic lines, for example in [[Sonny Rollins]]’ [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59aXJ8GvMYE “Blue Seven”].

{{Further|Fill (music)}}

A '''bass run''' (or "bass break") is a short [[instrumental break]] or [[fill (music)|fill]] in which the [[Bass (instrument)|bass instrument]] (such as an [[bass guitar|electric bass]] or a [[double bass]]) or instruments (in the case of a marching band) and the bassline are given the forefront.&lt;ref name="van der Merwe 1989 283"&gt;{{harvnb|van der Merwe|1989|p=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bass part for a bass run often differs from the usual bass [[accompaniment]] style, in terms of the register, [[timbre]], or melodic style that is used, or the number of notes per beat which are played.

A bass run may be composed by the performer or by an [[arranger]] prior to a performance, or it may be [[improvisation|improvised]] onstage by the performer using scales, arpeggios, and standard [[lick (music)|lick]]s and [[riff]]s. In some cases, a bass run may incorporate a display of [[virtuoso]] techniques such as rapid passages or high notes. During a bass run, the main [[singer|vocal]] or [[melody]] line usually stops, and in some cases, the [[percussion instrument|percussion]] or [[Drum kit|drums]] may also stop.  The technique originated in the [[march (music)|marches]] of the "[[John Philip Sousa|Sousa]] school", though its resemblance to [[Call and response (music)|call and response]] techniques familiar to [[African-American music|African American music]]ians indicates an earlier origin.&lt;ref name="van der Merwe 1989 283"/&gt;

===Electric bass===

In a [[Rock music|rock]] song in which the bassline consists of low-pitched quarter notes played on the electric bass, a bass run may consist of a rapid sequence of sixteenth notes in a higher register, or of a melodic [[riff]] played in a higher register. In some cases, the bassist will select a "brighter"-sounding pickup or increase the treble response of the instrument for a bass run, so that it will be easier to hear.

In a [[heavy metal bass|heavy metal]] song where the bassist was ordinarily playing low notes without overdrive to accompany, for a solo, he or she may turn on a [[fuzz bass]] pedal and use a [[wah pedal]] to create a more pronounced tone (an approach used by [[Cliff Burton]]), and then play an upper register riff or scale run. Some [[shred guitar]]-style bassists may do two-handed [[tapping]] during a bass solo (e.g., [[Billy Sheehan]]).

In a [[Pop music|pop]] song in which the bassline consists of notes plucked on the electric bass, a bass run may consist of several bars of percussive [[slap and pop|slapping and popping]]. Bass solos and guitar solos are rare in pop. In the rare cases that instrumental solos occur in pop, they are often played by [[synthesizer]] or, in some bands, by [[saxophone]].

In a [[funk]] song in which the bassline already consists of percussive slapping and popping, a bass run may consist of a virtuostic display of rapid slapping and popping techniques combined with techniques such as glissando, note-bending, and harmonics.

===Double bass===

In a [[jump blues]] tune in which the bassline consists of low-pitched quarter notes played on the double bass in a scalar walking bass style, a bass run may consist of a bar of swung eighth notes played using a percussive slap bass style, in which the right hand strikes the strings against the fingerboard.

In a [[Swing music|swing]] tune in which the bassline consists of low-pitched quarter notes played on the double bass in a scalar walking bass style, a bass run may consist of a descending chromatic scale played in a higher register.

In a [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] tune in which the bassline consists of low-pitched quarter notes played on the double bass on the root and fifth of each [[chord (music)|chord]] on beats one and three (of a 4/4 tune), a bass run may consist of a walking bass line played for several bars.

In a [[psychobilly]] band, a bass solo will often consist of a virtuostic display of triple and quadruple slaps, creating a percussive, drum solo-like sound.

===Wind bass===

In a [[marching band]] context, a bass run may consist of a several bar unaccompanied passage composed for the tubas and sousaphones which displays either rapid passages of notes or higher-register techniques. In New Orleans jazz, the tuba may provide a walking bass line similar to that of the double bass.

'''''Beast Wars: Transformers''''' (titled '''''Beasties: Transformers''''' in Canada),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfkGgI0HiTQ|accessdate=2012-04-09 |title=Beasties - Opening - Youtube| date=2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American-Canadian [[Computer graphics|computer]] [[animated television series]] that debuted in 1996 and ended on March 7, 1999, serving as the [[flagship]] of the ''[[Transformers: Beast Wars]]'' franchise. The series featured the Maximals and Predacons, descendants of the Autobots and Decepticons respectively, and was set in the future of the [[Transformers: Generation 1|"original" ''Transformers'']] continuity; however, it was eventually revealed that they had traveled back in time before the series began and were actually on a prehistoric Earth some time in between when Optimus Prime and Megatron first crash-landed on Earth and the time when they awoke (as depicted in the first episode of [[Transformers: Generation 1|"original" ''Transformers'']]). Beast Wars was set up as a sequel to the first [[The Transformers (TV series)|''Transformers'' series]] (which has since been [[reboot (continuity)|rebooted]] in limited comic book stories by [[Dreamwave Productions|Dreamwave]] and [[IDW Publishing|IDW]] among others).

The ''Beast Wars'' [[TV series]] was the first Transformers series to feature computer-animated characters, and was produced by [[Rainmaker Studios|Mainframe Entertainment]] (now known as '''Rainmaker Studios''') of Canada, specifically [[Vancouver]]; its story editors were [[Bob Forward]] and [[Larry DiTillio]]. All three seasons are currently available on [[DVD]] in the [[United States|USA]] and other Region 1 territories. In Australia, to coincide with the show's tenth anniversary in 2006, [[Madman Entertainment]] released all three seasons in Region 4 format. These boxsets include "world exclusive" special features, such as commentaries and interviews with the voice actors.

The production designer for the show, [[Clyde Klotz]], won a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation in 1997 for his work on ''Beast Wars.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Setting and plot summary==
The two main factions of "Transformers" in Beast Wars are descendants of the two main factions in the original cartoon: the [[Maximal (Transformers)|Maximals]] are the descendants of the [[Autobot]]s and the [[Predacon]]s are the descendants of the [[Decepticon]]s. (In the sequel series ''[[Beast Machines: Transformers|Beast Machines]]'', the process during which Autobots and Decepticons became Maximals and Predacons is referred to as "The Great Upgrade.")

The leader of the Predacon team is [[Megatron (Beast Era)|Megatron]], a namesake of the original Decepticon commander. He and his forces are a splinter group on the hunt for powerful crystals known as Energon, though in "The Agenda Part 1" it's revealed Megatron got the location of energon as a bonus to be used in a ploy for power and dominance. They do this with the aid of an artifact known as the [[Voyager Golden Record|Golden Disk]] and Megatron's stolen ship, the ''[[List of Transformers spacecraft#Darksyde|Darksyde]]'', which is equipped with a transwarp drive. A Maximal exploration ship, the ''[[Axalon]]'', led by [[Optimus Primal]], is sent to stop them. Together the ships plunge through a time/space phenomenon created by the transwarp device during their battle in space, and [[Ancient astronauts|crash-land on a mysterious planet]].

The planet is found to be rich in deposits of raw Energon, in such extreme amounts that it proves to be poisonous to both factions' robot forms, forcing them to take on alternate organic forms for protection until their robot forms are needed. Thus the robots take on the beast forms of recognizable animals including mammals, birds, dinosaurs, arachnids, and insects.

Before crashing, the ''Axalon'' deploys its cargo of "stasis pods" containing Maximal [[protoforms]] — Transformer robots with vulnerable and undeveloped physical forms, which are left to orbit the planet as an alternative to possible destruction in the initial crash landing. This plays a larger part in the IDW series, ''The Gathering''. Throughout the series, stasis pods lose altitude and crash-land on the planet, and the Maximals and Predacons race and fight to acquire them, as protoforms acquired by Megatron's forces can be reprogrammed to become Predacons. The stasis pods are used as a [[plot device]] to introduce new characters.

The teams are divided between the "good" Maximals and the "evil" Predacons, equivalent to the traditional Autobots and Decepticons. Most of the Maximals are based on mammals, while the Predacons are based on reptiles or insects. [[Dinobot]] changes sides, starting as a Predacon and becoming a Maximal, and was later created as an artificial Predacon clone by Megatron in season 3. This made Dinobot the only reptile-based Maximal, as he is based on a [[Utahraptor]]. Additionally certain "Predacons" like [[Inferno (Transformers)|Inferno]] and [[Blackarachnia]] were created from Maximal protoforms, but were fitted with Predacon shell programs, fighting instead for the Predacons. For the Maximals, the emphasis is on team spirit and good-natured arguing, especially from [[Rattrap]], but the Predacons argue and battle for leadership, which impairs their effectiveness against the Maximals.

==Video games==
There have been two ''Beast Wars'' video games. The first game, simply called ''[[Beast Wars: Transformers (video game)|Beast Wars: Transformers]]'', was released for the [[PlayStation]] and [[IBM PC compatible|PC]]. It was a [[third person shooter]], based on the first season of the show, in which you can control either the Maximals or the Predacons in a series of missions to undermine the other faction's attempts at gaining enough resources to win the war between them and escape the planet. It was given a multiplayer feature (removed from the console releases) that allowed up to 8 players to play over [[Local Area Network|LAN]], with its own play rooms in the MS Gaming Zone (they have subsequently been removed).

The second game, ''[[Transformers: Beast Wars Transmetals|Beast Wars Transmetals]]'', is a [[Fighting Vipers]]-style fighting game based on the second season  released by [[BAM! Entertainment|Bay Area Multimedia]]. This game was memorable for having most of the cast members from the show reprise their voice roles.

A third game was in the works for the [[PlayStation 2]], but was scrapped in [[pre-production]], without any official word as to why, or how far the project was before the plug was pulled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/aftermath/episode/45417/trivia.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120913045735/http://www.tv.com/aftermath/episode/45417/trivia.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-09-13|title=Beast Wars - Season 2, Episode 1: Aftermath - TV.com|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=TV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DVD releases==
The series was originally released on DVD in Region 1 by [[Rhino Entertainment]] in 2003/2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdempire.com/Exec/v4_item.asp?item_id=541028|title=Beast Wars Transformers: Complete First Season Boxed Set|work=DVDEmpire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdempire.com/Exec/v4_item.asp?item_id=589524|title=Beast Wars Transformers: Complete Second Season Boxed Set|work=DVDEmpire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdempire.com/Exec/v4_item.asp?item_id=618442|title=Beast Wars Transformers: Complete Third Season Boxed Set|work=DVDEmpire}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These releases have been discontinued and are now out of print.

On February 8, 2011, [[Shout! Factory]] announced that they had acquired the rights to the series and planned to re-release it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Beast-Wars-Transformers-DVDs-Planned/15006|title=Beast Wars: Transformers DVD news: DVD Plans for Beast Wars: Transformers - TVShowsOnDVD.com|work=tvshowsondvd.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825071506/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Beast-Wars-Transformers-DVDs-Planned/15006|archivedate=2011-08-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They subsequently re-released season 1 on DVD on June 7, 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Beast-Wars-Transformers-Season-1-Press-Release/15397|title=Beast Wars: Transformers DVD news: Press Release for Beast Wars: Transformers - Season 1 - TVShowsOnDVD.com|work=tvshowsondvd.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519094442/http://tvshowsondvd.com/news/Beast-Wars-Transformers-Season-1-Press-Release/15397|archivedate=2011-05-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a complete series set on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shoutfactorystore.com/prod.aspx?pfid=5257412 Transformers Beast Wars: Complete Series | Shout!Factory&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625180238/http://www.shoutfactorystore.com/prod.aspx?pfid=5257412 |date=June 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both releases contain extensive bonus features including interviews, featurettes and special 24 page comic book- '''Transformers Timelines "Dawn of Future's Past."'''

==Reception==
While the toyline was lauded for its innovative joint construction and the show is overall liked by fans, the show was initially derided by a large portion of loyal Generation 1 fans for using animals, dinosaurs and insects instead of vehicles for the line's alternate forms.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} For the majority of season 1 developers were confronted with hate mail from disgruntled fans. An internet social battle emerged between old school original die hard fans and the new age fans. "Trukk not Munky" became the banner and popular argument material for unhappy watchers.

Ironically ''Beast Wars'' turned out to be mutually adored by both old and new fans alike.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Mainframe integrated enough G1 cameos and easter eggs to win over any watcher old or new. Beast Wars is still known as one of the greatest Transformer story incarnations and has stood the test of time—so much that a 10th anniversary toy line was released by Hasbro in honor of the show's success over the years. Even now Hasbro is still producing new toy molds of fan favorite characters of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/entertainment/hollywood/magazine/15-07/trans_movie |accessdate=2009-08-10 |title=The Rebirth of Optimus Prime |work=Wired |date=June 26, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815011837/http://www.wired.com/entertainment/hollywood/magazine/15-07/trans_movie |archivedate=August 15, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, ''Beast Wars'' was well received and is often praised for its mature tone and character development, in addition to its blend of comic relief and darker storylines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= The History of Transformers on TV|work= IGN|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/800/800768p2.html|accessdate=2010-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Beast Wars Transformers: Complete Second Season|work= DVD Talk|date=|url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/10037/beast-wars-transformers-complete-second-season/|accessdate=2010-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Beast Wars Transformers: Complete Third Season|work= DVD Talk|date=|url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/12259/beast-wars-transformers-the-complete-third-season/|accessdate=2010-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Beast Machines Transformers: The Complete Series|work= DVD Talk|date=|url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/20792/beast-machines-transformers-the-complete-series/|accessdate=2010-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The season two episode "Code of Hero" became regarded as one of the best episodes in Transformers history.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Dinobot became the first ''Beast Wars'' character to be inducted into the [[Transformers Hall of Fame]] in 2010. Waspinator, Beast Wars Megatron, and Optimus Primal later followed.

==Legacy==
{{Main|Transformers: Beast Wars}}
The Beast Wars franchise would go on for years worldwide. In animation, the show was succeeded by ''[[Beast Machines: Transformers|Beast Machines]]'', with a new creative team in charge of production. The traditionally-animated Japanese series ''[[Beast Wars II]]'' and ''[[Beast Wars Neo]]'' were created to fill the gap while the second and third seasons of ''Beast Wars'' were being translated into Japanese (called ''Beast Wars: Metals''). Several [[Transformers: Beast Wars#Comic books|comic books]] and [[Transformers: Beast Wars#Video games|video games]] were also produced. Beast Wars was also the second television series created by [[Mainframe Entertainment]] and [[Alliance Atlantis Communications]], two now-defunct companies who are the same creators of the world's [[History of computer animation|first ever entirely-CGI television series]] ''[[ReBoot]]'', which aired two years prior to Beast Wars.

On June 21, 2017, producer [[Lorenzo di Bonaventura]] announced that a film adaptation of ''Beast Wars'' was not in plans, as he explained: "I'm probably not the one to be asking that question to because I don't get ''Beast Wars'', but you know, thankfully I'm not the only vote on it. I've never quite understood, they kind of feel like incompatible to me, you have animals, robots, we're used to cars."&lt;ref&gt;[http://screenrant.com/transformers-producer-not-too-sure-about-beast-wars-potential/ Transformers Producer Not Too Sure About Beast Wars Potential].

{{Essay-like|article|date=December 2008}}
A '''body swap''' is a [[Literary technique|storytelling device]] seen in a variety of science and supernatural fiction, in which two people (or beings) exchange minds and end up in each other's bodies. In media such as television and film, the device is an opportunity for two actors to temporarily play each other's characters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/20677/6-staples-of-sci-fi-and-fantasy-television|title=6 staples of sci-fi and fantasy television|author=|date=|website=denofgeek.us|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315042020/http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/20677/6-staples-of-sci-fi-and-fantasy-television|archivedate=15 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in some cases, dialogue is [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] by the original actors.

There are different types of body swapping. For non-technology swapping, switches can be caused by [[magic item]]s such as amulets, heartfelt [[wish]]es, or just strange quirks of the [[universe]]. The switches typically reverse after the subjects have expanded their [[world view]]s, gained a new appreciation for each other's troubles by literally "walking in another's shoes" and/or caused sufficient amounts of [[farce]]. Notable examples include the books ''[[Vice Versa (book)|Vice Versa]]'' (1882)&lt;!-- No, that's STILL NOT a typo --&gt; and&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allreaders.com/Topics/Info_17775.asp|title=Vice Versa by F.

Switches accomplished by technology, exempting gadgets [[Clarke's three laws|advanced sufficiently]] to appear as magic, are the fare of [[mad scientist]]s. Body-swapping devices are usually characterized by a highly experimental status, straps, helmets with many complicated cables that run to a central system and a tendency to direly malfunction before their effects can be reversed. Those without such means may resort to [[whole-body transplant|brain transplant]]s. Such experiments can have overtones of [[Horror fiction|horror]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

'''''Bug Too!''''' is a [[Platform game|platforming]] [[video game]], the sequel to ''[[Bug!]]''. ''Bug Too!'' was originally released for the [[Sega Saturn]] on November 30, 1996 in North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtassoc.com/gm_bugtoo.html# PROJECT: Bug Too!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222130341/http://www.rtassoc.com/gm_bugtoo.html%23 |date=February 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then ported to Windows on December 10, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobygames.com/game/bug-too Bug Too! - MobyGames&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
The background plot involves popular action film stars Bug, Maggot Dog, and Super Fly being signed for a six picture deal, with all six movies being filmed in a single day.

==Gameplay==
The players can play as Bug, Maggot Dog, or Super Fly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Bug's Back for More!|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=9|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=July 1996|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bug Too!'' is played like a traditional [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling platform game]].&lt;ref name="EGM88"&gt;{{cite magazine| title=Bug Too!: Not Even Raid Can Stop this Sequel |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=88 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=November 1996 |pages=198-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player character must make his way through all the levels in each zone, with a boss level at the end of each zone. ''Bug Too!'' has 3D levels, which take the side-view and tweak it. Bug can walk sideways up vertical surfaces and even upside down.&lt;ref name="EGM88"/&gt;

Unlike the original ''Bug!'', ''Bug Too'' has a run button.&lt;ref name="EGM88"/&gt; The two-player mode allows players to alternate playing the game and compete for high scores.&lt;ref name="EGM88"/&gt;

When the player finishes a stage with at least 100 crystals collected, they are sent to one of several bonus stages. If the player collects a bonus stage's requisite number of Oscars, they earn an extra life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Lee|last=Nutter |title=Jammy Bugger!|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=16 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=February 1997 |pages=50-53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bug Too!'' was met with mixed reviews. Critics were generally pleased with the series additions of the run ability&lt;ref name=EGM90/&gt;&lt;ref name=SSM16/&gt;&lt;ref name=GP101/&gt; and new characters,&lt;ref name=EGM90/&gt;&lt;ref name=GSrev/&gt;&lt;ref name=NGen28/&gt;&lt;ref name=SSM16/&gt;&lt;ref name=GP101/&gt; though some noted that there is little gameplay difference between them and Bug.&lt;ref name=NGen28/&gt;&lt;ref name=SSM16/&gt; However, while the graphics in general were praised,&lt;ref name=EGM90/&gt;&lt;ref name=NGen28/&gt;&lt;ref name=SSM16/&gt;&lt;ref name=GP101/&gt; critics found the fixed side-view camera created frustrating problems with the gameplay, such as walls obstructing the player's view of Bug and difficulty judging distances when moving between the foreground and background.&lt;ref name=EGM90/&gt;&lt;ref name=SSM16/&gt;&lt;ref name=GP101/&gt; The four reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' deemed it an overall fun title, though not a must-have.&lt;ref name=EGM90/&gt; ''[[GamePro]]''{{'}}s Major Mike concluded, "''Bug Too!'' meets the expectations of its predecessor and at times exceeds them. Fans of the first game will definitely want to check it out, and for all you newcomers, it's a great time to get bugged."&lt;ref name=GP101&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Bug Too!|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=101|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=February 1997|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee Nutter of ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' similarly stated, "In all, ''Bug Too!'' is a top quality platform game surpassing its predecessors in all areas. But to be honest it really is just more of the same which is great if you liked the original. However, those who didn't won't find anything new to tempt them into purchasing it."&lt;ref name=SSM16/&gt; A reviewer for ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' regarded this lack of genuine innovation over the first game to be a particularly strong strike against it, and compared the game unfavorably to contemporary Saturn platformers ''[[Nights into Dreams]]'' and ''[[Sonic 3D Blast]]''.&lt;ref name=NGen28/&gt; [[Jeff Gerstmann]] of ''[[GameSpot]]'' also compared it unfavorably to ''Sonic 3D Blast'', and remarked, "The choice of films is far hipper than ''[[Spot Goes To Hollywood]]'', but the game doesn't play much better."&lt;ref name=GSrev/&gt;

'''''Castle Nightmare''''' is a [[computer game]] for the [[Commodore 64]]. The game was first released in 1984 by RSC Soft.&lt;ref name="emu" /&gt;

==Description==
The player assumes the role of Simon the Hero, who must navigate through ten mazes in search of the diamond.  Simon must gather certain items—a key and a lock—in order to reveal the doorway to the next maze.  Each maze is completed when Simon escapes through the exit.

During his journey, Simon must avoid the various enemies in order to stay alive.  The enemies along travel in a constant path at different speeds.  This makes them somewhat predictable, and they can be avoided with good timing and a proper strategy.  Simon has the ability to run, which can be used to help avoid the enemies.  Simon is also vulnerable to other static dangers; he will die if he comes in contact with the electric walls throughout the castle or if too much time is taken to complete a maze.

In addition to the key and the lock, there are other objects that can aid Simon on his quest.  The potion of life is introduced in the eponymous "Potion of Life" level and reappears in the levels "Dark Walls" and "Black Room".  Collecting the potion gives the player an extra life.  The lantern appears only in Level 8 (Black Room) and allows the player to see the illuminated layout of the maze.  The potion and lantern are very helpful, but they are not required in order to complete the game.

'''chameckilerner''' is a New York-based dance and video collective consisting of Rosane Chamecki and Andrea Lerner. Originally from [[Curitiba]], [[Brazil]], the duo was founded in 1992 primarily as a choreographic platform, but has since shifted their focus primarily to choreographing for the camera, video, and multi-channel installations. The shift in medium coincided with the premiere of their interdisciplinary performance EXIT at [[The Kitchen]] in 2007, which was deemed the "figurative killing off of the duo".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BOMB Magazine — chameckilerner by Eve Sussman|url = http://bombmagazine.org/article/10020/chameckilerner|website = bombmagazine.org|access-date = 2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been described as making use of "articulated movement ingrained in physical structures to define the psychological state of a body."

chameckilerner had their performance work presented at The Kitchen (2007); [[Dance Theater Workshop]] (1992, 1994, 1999, 2003); and [[Performance Space 122]] (1995), [[New York City|New York]], among others. In 2008 their first video work, Flying Lesson, premiered at the Dance on Camera Festival, [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]], New York where it won the Jury Award for Best Film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FLYING LESSON|url = http://chameckilerner.com/flying-lesson/|website = chameckilerner.com|access-date = 2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 they were recipients of the [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], and have also received numerous grants and fellowships such as the Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists award (1998), awards from [[New York State Council on the Arts|New York State Council on The Arts]], the [[Jerome Foundation]], and [[Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center|EMPAC]], and others. The duo has a forthcoming solo exhibition at Pierogi Gallery, Brooklyn, New York in February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = chameckilerner at The Boiler|url = http://www.pierogi2000.com/2015/12/rosane-chamecki-and-andrea-lerner-at-the-boiler/|website = Pierogi Gallery|access-date = 2016-02-03|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19210">A '''chordioid''', also called ''chord fragment'' or ''fragmentary voicing''&lt;ref name=rawlins_p86&gt;Rawlins, Robert, et al. (2005)  ''Jazzology: The Encyclopedia of Jazz Theory for All Musicians'', p. 86.  Winona: Hal Leonard.  {{ISBN|0634086782}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''partial voicing'',&lt;ref name=rawlins_p86 /&gt; is a group of musical notes which does not qualify as a [[chord (music)|chord]] under some preferred chord theory or other, but still useful to name and [[Reification (knowledge representation)|reify]] for other reasons.

The main use of chordioids is to form "legitimate" chords [[enharmonic]]ally in [[12TET]] by adding one or more notes to this base.&lt;ref name=slonimsky_pv&gt;Slonimsky, Nicholas.  (1947) ''Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns'', p. v.  New York: Charles Scribner Sons. {{ISBN|002-6118505}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is typical of chordioids that many different resultant chords can be created from the same base depending on the note or combination of notes added.&lt;ref name=slonimsky_pv /&gt;  The resultant chords on a single chordioid are somewhat related, because they can be [[Chord progression|progressed between]] using motion of just one voice.  Theorists&amp;nbsp;– or practical music teachers&amp;nbsp;– writing of chordioids usually go so far as to advise that students learn them in the practical manner of chords generally: in all [[transposition (music)|transpositions]], [[Range (music)|ranges]], [[permutations]], and [[voicing (music)|voicings]], for reading, writing, and playing.&lt;ref name=rawlins_p86 /&gt;&lt;ref name=slonimsky_pv /&gt;&lt;ref name=slonimsky_p241&gt;Slonimsky, Nicholas.  (1947) ''Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns'', p. 241.  New York: Charles Scribner Sons. {{ISBN|002-6118505}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is the case, also, that "legitimate chords" can be used as chordioids to create resultant chords by the same process.&lt;ref name="schillinger_p487"&gt;Schillinger, Joseph. (1941) ''The Schillinger System of Musical Composition, Vol. 1'', p. 478.  New York: Carl Fischer.  {{ISBN|0306775212}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps this is whence the non-chord chordioids come.  The [[Augmented sixth chord#Italian sixth|Italian augmented 6th chord (It+6)]] is one example, from which proceed the [[Augmented sixth chord#French sixth|French augmented 6th chord (Fr+6)]] and [[Augmented sixth chord#German sixth|German augmented 6th chord (Gr+6)]] by addition of one note.  Rawlins(2005) asserts that the notion derives from practice of such composers as [[Eric Satie]], [[Claude Debussy]], [[Maurice Ravel]], and [[Gabriel Faure]], and was first used in jazz by [[Bill Evans]].&lt;ref name=rawlins_p86 /&gt;

Two chordioids may potentially be combined, as well.  Typically, duplication of notes will result in a reduced number of unique notes in the resultant.

Chordioids as a technique is related to [[polychord]]s insofar as polychords are the result of an additive process, but differs in that the basis of polychords is the addition of two known chords.  Chordioids is related also to [[upper structure]]s as a technique insofar as upper structures represent groups of notes not commonly taken to be "legitimate" chords, but differs in that chordioids as a technique uses ''a priori'' structures held in common rather than a free selection of color tones appropriate for a lower integral chord.  Chordioids is related to [[slash chord]]s as a technique insofar as known chords may be used as chordioids to create resultant scales, but differs in that chordioids used are not exclusively known chords.

== Master chord ==
[[File:Master chord chardiod resultant chords.png|450px|thumb|center|Master chardiod resultant chords: added note = square note heads, implied notes=parenthesis]]

[[Nicolas Slonimsky]] named "master chord"&lt;ref name=slonimsky_pv /&gt; that chordioid described in [[jazz]] chord theory as [[Dominant seventh chord|7no5]], e.g.: {{nobreak|{ C D F{{music|sharp}} }. }} The sonority of the chordioid itself is identical to that of the [[Augmented sixth chord#Italian sixth|It+6]], a subset of the [[Wholetone scale]] and so subject to some of the [[Symmetry|symmetries]] and [[homogeneity]] for which that scale is known, and [[Anhemitonia|anhemitonic]] allowing the possibility that the resultant scale be anhemitonic or at least [[Ancohemitonia|ancohemitonic]] itself.

The chord buttons of the [[Accordion]] usually play master chords, allowing the bass buttons (or a second chord button) to supply the variable note (or notes) to complete the sonority.

The new name and concept, "master chord", thus does not imply either jazz derivation, completeness of the sonority as an independent chord, nor connection to other use as a chord of [[dominant function]].  It does not speciously denote anything to be "missing", or posit that the listener should ever hear a note not actually present.  It rejects the tertian chordal basis as pertaining at all.  These, the practicality of application, and the variety of use, are the logical basis of chordioids.

The following table shows the resultant chord for some of the possible added notes:

== [[Augmented sixth chord]]s ==

{{Main|Augmented sixth chord}}

Harmonically, [[Augmented sixth chord|augmented sixth chords (+6ths) ]] in prime position require three things:

* the interval of a [[major third]] up from the bottom note,
* the interval of an [[augmented sixth]] up from the bottom note, and
* strict [[anhemitonia]]: that there be no semitones present.&lt;ref&gt;Christ, William (1966). Materials and Structure of Music, v. 2, pp. 153ff. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice–Hall. LOC 66-14354.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tymoczko, Dimitri.  (2011) ''A Geometry of Music'', pp. 61ff.  New York: Oxford University.  {{ISBN|978-0195336672}} .&lt;/ref&gt;
Given these requirements, which are minimally fulfilled by the [[Augmented sixth chord#Italian sixth|Italian sixth (It+6)]], e.g.: { A{{music|flat}} C F{{music|sharp}} }, it is possible to derive all potential +6 chords from the It+6.  The following table illustrates:&lt;ref&gt;Prout, Ebenezer. (1889)  ''Harmony: Its Theory and Practice'', pp. 197ff.  London: Augener.(&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other known chords as chordioids ==

[[Joseph Schillinger]] also used basic triads and the master chord as chordioids in building bigger structures, textures, and strata.  His [[Seventh chord|7th chords]] were based upon single notes added below [[Major chord|major]], [[Minor chord|minor]], [[Diminished triad|diminished]], or [[Augmented chord|augmented]] triads;&lt;ref&gt;Schillinger, Joseph. (1941) ''The Schillinger System of Musical Composition, Vol. 1'', p. 447.  New York: Carl Fischer.  {{ISBN|0306775212}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of his hybrid 4-part harmony (including [[Eleventh chord|11th]] and [[Thirteenth chord|13th]] chords)&lt;ref name=schillinger_p487 /&gt; likewise.

The mixture of 'high' culture, such as the opera music of ''[[Diva (1981 film)|Diva]]'' and ''[[Les Amants du Pont-Neuf]],'' and pop culture, for example the references to [[Batman]] in ''[[Subway (film)|Subway]]'', was another key feature.&lt;ref name=Austin/&gt;

==Origins==
French filmmakers were inspired by [[New Hollywood]] films (most notably [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[One from the Heart]]'' and ''[[Rumble Fish]]''), late [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder|Fassbinder]] films (''[[Lola (1981 film)|Lola]]''), as well as television commercials, [[music video]]s, and fashion photography.{{sfn|Bordwell|Thompson|2003|p=620}}

'''''Commercial Breakdown''''' is a [[light entertainment]] show that shows humorous [[television advertisement]]s from around the world and ran from 29 December 1989 to 3 August 2008 and aired on [[BBC One]]. British adverts were initially not allowed because of the BBC's [[Royal Charter]] (advertising is completely forbidden on the BBC), however presently, provided the adverts are not currently being broadcast, they are allowed. Many of the adverts were international which means they were not selling items on the British market.

The {{Nihongo|'''''Dotch Cooking Show'''''|どっちの料理ショー|Dotchi no Ryōri Shō|lead=yes}} (April 17, 1997 – March 17, 2005) was a [[Japan]]ese [[cooking show]] produced by the [[Yomiuri Telecasting Corporation]] and known for its use of the highest quality and most expensive food ingredients available from both domestic and international sources. In the show two chefs prepare two competing dishes, each using a special premium ingredient, but the dish that is ultimately served at the end of the show is determined by majority vote of the panelists, and then served only to those who voted for that dish. The show is continued by the {{Nihongo|[[#The New Dotch Cooking Show|'''''New Dotch Cooking Show''''']]|新どっちの料理ショー|Shin Dotchi no Ryōri Shō}} from April 14, 2005.

==Format==
Each of the two hosts, [[Hiroshi Sekiguchi]] (関口宏) and [[Yuji Miyake]] (三宅裕司), chooses a particular dish for the contest, and oversees the dish's creation by his chef.  For most of the show's run, Sekiguchi was in charge of the Red kitchen, and Miyake took the Yellow kitchen.  In later episodes, the two dishes were pre-selected, and whichever meal Sekiguchi and Miyake prepared for his side was determined by a special dice throw.  The competing dishes were typically from the same category; an example of a typical "battle" would be miso ramen versus salt-and-butter ramen.  Other battles have included miso-based dishes versus mayonnaise-based dishes, chocolate fondant cake versus fruit tart, and even tacos versus spring rolls.

The seven guests would be asked to choose which meal they would most like to eat.  Unlike [[Iron Chef]], where the judges would get to eat the food prepared by both chefs, only the guests who chose the winning dish were allowed to eat.  There were three periods when the guests would vote; the first was when the dishes were announced, the second was after the "tasting time," and the third was after both dishes had been completed.  Though Sekiguchi and Miyake would be allowed to taste the dishes in progress and describe what they had eaten (often in dramatic fashion), the guests were allowed only one "tasting time," where they got a sample of each kitchen's special ingredient, usually prepared in a manner similar to how it would be for the finished product.  In the later episodes of the show, the tasting time was eliminated for all but one of the guests. The lucky guest, who was randomly chosen, would be allowed the samples as previously described, and would then have to describe what they tasted to the other guests.  As a result, they would be the only one asked to choose the dish they wanted during the second voting.  This was done to increase the suspense for the TV audience and put the guests on the same level as the audience.

While the chefs were preparing their dishes, each side would reveal a special ingredient that they hoped would sway the guests to vote for their respective dishes.  The special ingredients could be anything from the focus of the recipe, such as a meat or vegetable, to a sauce or flavoring component.  Though most of the special ingredients were found in often remote areas of Japan, some came from outside Japan, such as Mongolia, Korea, and even Scotland.  In very rare and unusual instances, the special ingredients were not food items, but rather tools for preparing or serving the dish, such as a granite bowl from Korea, used in the preparation of stone-cooked [[bibimbap]], or a special cast iron press used to make [[taiyaki]].  Each kitchen's special assistant would go to where the special ingredient was grown/raised/manufactured/harvested, to both procure the special ingredient and observe how it was produced.

At the end of the show, the two hosts would declare in unison: "{{Nihongo|''Kon'ya no gochūmon wa dotch?''|今夜の御注文はどっち？||Which dish will you order for tonight?}}" The word "{{Nihongo|''Dotch''|どっち|Dotchi}}", which appears in the show's graphics, is a transliteration of the Japanese word meaning "which one". The guests would press a button (corresponding to which dish they chose) and the side with the most votes was declared the winner.  The winning host would then ask the loser to withdraw (''tesshū'', 撤收).  The losing host and his chef would then take away their losing dish, and the winning guests and host would then dine on their selection.  The hungry losers would watch the winners eat.  This would often be followed by a scene of the winning host and guests leaving the show set satisfied after their meal, a scene of the losing host and guests griping about not getting to eat as they left the studio, or sometimes both.   At the very end of the show, the losing chef would typically be shown eating his dish alone, wondering why he did not win.

Since each side had to prepare food for eight people (seven guests and the winning host, in the event of a complete 7-0 victory (later 9 portions for seven guests, the winning host, and the assistant for the winning kitchen) and typically fewer than that number would actually get to eat, any food left over after the winners had eaten was usually consumed by the show's crew.  Since each show usually took hours to film, the hunger expressed by the losing guests at the end was genuine.

==Attendants==
* Sekiguchi's Kitchen
** Sekiguchi Hiroshi
** Sekiguchi's Assistant: Sosuke Sumitani (炭谷宗佑, an announcer at Nippon TV)
** Sekiguchi's Chef
** Sekiguchi's Mascot: DOTCHkun (ドッチくん) - Voiced by Aya Hara (原亜弥)
[Later episodes of The New Dotch Cooking Show: Keisuke Mori (森圭介, an announcer at Nippon TV) becomes the new assistant]

* Miyake's Kitchen
** Miyake Yuji
** Miyake's Assistant: Ken Shimizu (清水健, an announcer at Yomiuri TV)
** Miyake's Chef

* Regular guest: [[Tsuyoshi Kusanagi]] (草彅剛)
* 6 other guests, usually famous Japanese [[entertainer]]s or [[sportsperson|athlete]]s.

The assistants reported, newscaster-style, on the obtaining of special ingredients.  The chefs were hired from a pool of highly skilled cooks.

==The New Dotch Cooking Show==
The format of the show is basically the same, except that tasting time has been completely eliminated for the contestants (Sekiguchi and Miyake still get to taste the works in progress).  The contestant roster was expanded from 7 to 11 (occasionally 9), with 4 celebrity contestants (Tsuyoshi Kusanagi still appeared as a regular) and 7 (occasionally 5) additional contestants, called "Hara-Helicopters," drawn from a pool.  Typically, the Hara-Helicopters are everyday people, though some groups are distinctly categorized, e.g. schoolchildren, "idols," "young men who have not eaten for 48 hours," or restaurateurs.  During the preparation of the meals, the celebrity contestants would be allowed to observe each chef's methods up close, and smell/feel (not taste) the various ingredients used, while the Hara-Helicopters would watch the action from their seats overlooking the stage.  In some episodes, Kusanagi would bring a plate of one of the special ingredients up to the Hara-Helicopters so they could smell it.  The series went on hiatus on September 14, 2006
and returned on January 4, 2007 for a one-time only TV special.

'''EQ Music Blog''' (formerly Electroqueer.com) is an independent British music [[website]] and [[blog]] founded by American digital and music enthusiast Raj Rudolph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| |url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajrudolph| title=Raj Rudolph | work=[[Linkedin]]| |accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative names include '''EQ''' and '''EQ Music'''; the site supports new [[electronic pop]] artists alongside its music reviews, features, interviews and video previews. In 2007, with the addition of New Artists Editor Mandy Rogers, the site developed into a multi-author blog; in 2013, pop blogger Luis Gonzalez joined.

In 2008, the EQ Music brand began to spoke into several entertainment related divisions including live showcasing, touring, [[record label]] and artist management; together, EQ Music's brands consolidate into a diverse international music [[media group]].

== History ==
In 2005, digital and music enthusiast Raj Rudolph launched Electroqueer.com as a blog focused on discovering and inspiring new talent in the [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Electronic music|electronic]] genres of music. In 2008, EQ Music Live was formed, with the subsequent formation of the EQ Music Tour in 2011.

At the 2008 [[The Weblog Awards (Bloggies)|Weblog Awards]], Electroqueer.com placed as finalist in the Best Music Blog category.&lt;ref name="Best Music Blog Finalists 2008"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kevin|first1=Aylward|title=Best Music Blog|url=http://2008.weblogawards.org/polls/best-music-blog/|website=2008.weblogawards.org|accessdate=2 June 2015|date=31 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Electroqueer.com changed its name, becoming EQ Music Blog. The following year, [[Wales|Welsh]] [[electropop]] duo [[Electrovamp]] won EQ Music Blog's theme song contest; the band's winning entry, "Electroqueer", became the site's official theme song and was featured on volume one of the ''This Beat Is Poptronik'' compilation album, curated by the blog.&lt;ref name="EQMusicBlog Theme Song Winners"&gt;{{cite web|title=Announcing The Winner Of The 2011 EQ Music Theme Song Community Project – Electrovamp!|url=http://eqmusicblog.com/announcing-the-winner-of-the-2011-eq-theme-song-community-project-electrovamp/|website=EQMusicBlog.com|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Poptronik Vol. 1 - Itunes"&gt;{{cite web| |url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/this-beat-is-poptronik-volume/id520123239| title=This Beat Is Poptronik – Volume One | work=[[Itunes store]]| |accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, EQ Music announced co-sponsorship from [[Gaydar Radio]], [[Budweiser]] and Music Jobs Ltd for the inaugural Poptronik Festival held in Spain.&lt;ref name="UK.music-jobs.com Poptronik Festival 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sitgesevents.com Poptronik Festival"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sitges Poptronik Festival 2014|url=http://www.sitgesevents.com/event/sitges-poptronik-festival-2014|website=Sitgesevents.com|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, EQ Music launched its artist management division.&lt;ref name="Mrwillwong.com EQ Management"&gt;{{cite web|title=NEWMUSIC: PARRALOX &amp; RYAN ADAMÉS – "SILENT MORNING"|url=http://www.mrwillwong.com/newmusic-parralox-ryan-adames-silent-morning/|website=Mrwillwong.com|accessdate=9 June 2015|date=1 May 2013|quote=Electroqueer officially has branched into Artist Management over in the UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the brand launched on [[Viber]] Public Chats, giving app users the ability to access the [[blogsite]]'s music picks and recommendations via the platform's [[instant messaging]] and [[Voice over IP]] (VoIP) software.&lt;ref name="Viber"&gt;{{cite web| |url=http://chats.viber.com/eqmusic| title=EQ Music on Viber Public Chats | work=[[Viber]]| |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing style and criticism==
At its heart, EQ Music Blog describes itself as "a fun place to discover new music, watch music videos and dig deeper into the lives of the people creating quality electronic pop music, written with a fun and constructive tone."&lt;ref name="Zoominfo.com EQ Music Blog"&gt;{{cite web|title=EQ Music Blog|url=http://www.zoominfo.com/s/#!search/profile/company?companyId=359284985&amp;targetid=profile|website=Zoominfo.com|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site's editorial views have been featured in British press (''[[The Guardian (newspaper)|The Guardian]]'', ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|The Metro]]'' and ''[[Daily Star (British newspaper)|The Daily Star]]'').&lt;ref name="The Guardian One Direction"&gt;{{cite web| |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/jan/18/jeremy-joseph-gay-one-direction| title=Is there only One Direction for G-A-Y? | work=[[The Guardian (newspaper)|The Guardian]]| |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Metro Lady Gaga"&gt;{{cite web| |url=http://metro.co.uk/2010/03/01/lady-gaga-at-londons-o2-arena-gig-review-135258| title=Lady Gaga hailed as ‘new Queen of Pop’ after triumphant O2 gig | work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|The Metro]]| |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Daily Star Patrick Wolf"&gt;{{cite web| |url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/gossip/64671/Wolf-attacked-at-Madonna-show| title=Wolf 'attacked' at Madonna show | work=[[Daily Star (British newspaper)|The Daily Star]]| |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Australian blogsite PopTrashAddicts accused EQ Music of spending most of its time copying content from other pop blogs; a view EQ called a good laugh.&lt;ref name="EQ Wins Worst Music Blog Pop Trash Addicts!"&gt;{{cite web|title=EQ Wins Worst Music Blog From Pop Trash Addicts!|url=http://eqmusicblog.com/eq-wins-worst-music-blog-from-pop-trash-addicts/|website=EQMusicBlog.com|accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[BBC News Online]] selected EQ Music's Raj Rudolph as an influential UK-based music editor and [[Sound of]] pundit, an accolade consecutively held since 2011—2015.&lt;ref name="Sound of 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sound of 2015"&gt;{{cite web| |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3S3vM9fKwyr0w0vbxhl4KG5/the-pundits| title=Sound of 2015: Pundits | work=[[BBC News]]| |publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sound of 2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sound of 2012: Pundits|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/soundof/2012/pundits/az/|website=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Puerto Rican production duo [[Los de la Nazza]], which had been working with Daddy Yankee since 2007, left [[El Cartel Records]] and stopped being his main producers in order to focus on their careers. Chris Jeday and Gaby Music were hired as the album's main producers during late 2014. ''El Disco Duro'' was officially announced during mid-2014 as ''King Daddy II'' with the promotion of the single "Sábado Rebelde" featuring Puerto Rican duo [[Plan B (duo)|Plan B]], released on October 31.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elnuevoherald.com/entretenimiento/musica/article16902242.html|title=Daddy Yankee sigue siendo el Rey|trans-title=Daddy Yankee is still the king|work=[[El Nuevo Herald]]|last=Vargas|first=Doraluz|language=Spanish|date=March 30, 2015|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 10, he was urgently moved to a nearby hospital in [[Cali]], [[Colombia]], where he was set to perform later that night. Daddy Yankee suffered a rise in blood pressure, [[hypoglycemia]] and dehydration, which almost caused him to suffer a heart attack before being treated by doctors. His condition improved and he was sent to rest in his native Puerto Rico, but had to cancel other concerts in Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.peopleenespanol.com/article/daddy-yankee-estuvo-al-borde-del-ataque-cardiaco|title=Daddy Yankee: los problemas de salud que le llevaron al hospital|publisher=peopleenespanol.com|last=Mabry Paraíso|first=Alexander|language=spanish|date=September 13, 2016|accessdate=October 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 19, he confirmed that his hypoglycemia worsened and turned into a [[prediabetes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elheraldo.hn/entretenimiento/1009872-466/reguetonero-daddy-yankee-confirma-grave-enfermedad|title=Reguetonero Daddy Yankee confirma grave enfermedad|publisher=eheraldo.hn|language=spanish|date=October 19, 2016|accessdate=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1953723-daddy-yankee-rompio-el-silencio-sobre-la-enfermedad-que-padecen-el-y-una-de-sus-hijas|title=Daddy Yankee rompió el silencio sobre la enfermedad que padecen él y una de sus hijas|publisher=lanacion.com.ar|language=spanish|date=November 5, 2016|accessdate=November 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Emergency 4: Global Fighters for Life''''' (known as '''''911: First Responders''''' in North America) is a [[simulation video game]] developed by German studio Sixteen Tons Entertainment allowing users to manage [[emergency service]]s on a variety of [[accident]] and/or accident scenes.

==Gameplay==
The player becomes head of operations in a fictional rescue management organization in command of a number of vehicles and staff from the fire department, medical rescue, police, and technical services. The player has to react to a variety of events against a background of continuous day/night rotation and constantly changing weather conditions.&lt;ref name="giantbomb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.giantbomb.com/emergency-4-global-fighters-for-life/3030-15091/ | title=Emergency 4: Global Fighter for Life | publisher=Giant Bomb | accessdate=August 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nowgamer"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nowgamer.com/pc/pc-reviews/906639/emergency_4_global_fighters_for_life.html | title=Emergency 4: Global Fighters For Life | publisher=NowGamer | accessdate=August 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game includes 20 missions, the ability to manage a team of emergency response professionals, ability to manage a variety of emergency response vehicles, with mandatory free play intermissions at every interim, and the Endless and Challenge free play modes.&lt;ref name="giantbomb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nowgamer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ataricom"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atari.com/buy-games/simulation/911-first-responders | title=911: First Responders | publisher=Atari | accessdate=August 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsgf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wsgf.org/dr/911-first-responders | title=911: First Responders | work=Widescreen Gaming Forum | accessdate=August 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Emergency 4'' boasts several improvements in user-friendliness over previous games in the ''[[Emergency (series)|Emergency]]'' series. For instance, it is possible to dispatch several vehicles at the same time, order them to arrive at a specific location, there's a simple counter for the number of casualties in the area of operations, and idle [[emergency physician]]s seek out nearby untended casualties.

A deluxe release includes three extra missions and support for voice commands.

'''Fritz Muliar''', born as '''Friedrich Ludwig Stand''' (December 12, 1919 – May 4, 2009), was an [[Austria]]n actor who, due to his huge popularity, is often referred to by his countrymen as ''Volksschauspieler''.

== Biography ==
Born in [[Neubau]], [[Vienna]] as the stepson of a [[jewellery|jeweller]], Muliar became a [[cabaret]] artist in the late 1930s. He was a [[Boy Scout]] in his youth.&lt;ref name= "Pfade"&gt;{{cite journal|author=
| title =Eingeschlagene Pfade|language = German | journal = Skills-100 Jahre Pfadfinder.Magazin zum Abenteuer des Lebens.|pages=104–105| date =
| year = 2007|publisher= Pfadfinder und Pfadfinderinnen Österreichs und Monopol Verlag }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dabei"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kati Kieser;Lisa Niederdorfer
| title =Dabei gewesen|language = German | journal = Skills-Pfadfinderinnen und Aussen.Magazin zum Abenteuer des Lebens.|pages=66–67|year = 2010|publisher= Pfadfinder und Pfadfinderinnen Österreichs und Monopol Verlag }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After serving in the [[World War II|Second World War]], he was imprisoned by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] in 1942 and spent seven months in [[solitary confinement]] for ''Betätigung zur Wiederherstellung eines freien Österreich'' (activities to restore Austrian independence&amp;mdash;'''see''' [[Anschluss]]).

After the war, Muliar started his career as a stage actor. Of small build, he once said that his ambitions had never included playing parts such as that of [[Othello]]. Rather, he had always preferred comic roles and traditional Austrian fare ([[Johann Nestroy]], [[Ferdinand Raimund]]). Muliar also excelled in imitating various [[Accent (dialect)|accent]]s, in particular those used by [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Yiddish]] speakers of [[German language|German]]. In 1990, he had enormous success in [[Felix Mitterer]]'s play for one person, ''[[Siberia (play)|Siberia]]'' (televised in 1991), a study in [[ageism]] about an old man who has been abandoned by his family in a [[retirement home]] and his struggle for [[dignity]].

While he also performed regularly at the [[Salzburg Festival]] in the play ''[[Jedermann (play)|Jedermann]]'' (a version of ''[[Everyman (play)|Everyman]]''), Muliar was associated with two Viennese theatres in particular: the [[Burgtheater]] (whose [[tenure]]d member he was until his retirement), and the [[Theater in der Josefstadt]], where he worked until his death in 2009. He was one of the severest critics of [[Claus Peymann]] (born 1937), director of the Burgtheater between 1986 and 1999 whose leadership polarized Austrian theatregoers by its focus on controversial playwrights such as [[Thomas Bernhard]] and [[Elfriede Jelinek]]. [[Musical theatre]] saw Muliar in the non-singing role of Frosch in ''[[Die Fledermaus]]''.  At Theater in der Josefstadt, Muliar was perhaps best known for the role of Mr. Green in [[Jeff Baron]]'s [[Visiting Mr. Green]] (Besuch bei Mr Green).  Muliar, Michael Dangl the theater and Jeff Baron were awarded the 2001 Kulturpreis Europa for this production, which ran for several seasons and was nationally telecast.

Muliar appeared in numerous films and in some television series such as ''[[Kir Royal – Aus dem Leben eines Klatschreporters|Kir Royal]]'' (alongside [[Franz Xaver Kroetz]]) and ''[[Kommissar Rex]]''. He is best remembered beyond the boundaries of his native Vienna for playing the title role in the 13-part TV series, ''[[The Good Soldier Svejk|Die Abenteuer des braven Soldaten Schwejk]]'', which was filmed in [[German language|German]] and broadcast by the [[Austria]]n state TV ([[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]]) in 1972.

Muliar was a committed [[Social Democrat]] who publicly supported various Austrian [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democratic]] politicians during their [[election campaign]]s. He was married from 1955 to [[Franziska Kalmar]], Austria's first [[television presenter]]. In January 2006 he was elected to the position of a public advisor in the Austrian state TV (ORF). He died in Vienna, aged 89.

'''''Fury''''' was a [[player versus player]] (PvP) competitive online role-playing game and [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] (MMORPG) developed by [[Auran]]. The game was published by Gamecock Media Group on October 16, 2007, and was the first game they published.&lt;ref name="gs"&gt;{{cite news|last1=GameSpot Staff|title=Auran's Fury shuts down|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/aurans-fury-shuts-down/1100-6195434/|accessdate=February 9, 2017|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=August 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less than two months later, the developer announced it had laid off all employees.&lt;ref name="gs"/&gt; The game switched to a free-to-play model, but in October 2008 Auran shutdown the game servers meaning the game would no longer be playable.&lt;ref name="gs"/&gt;

==Gameplay==
''Fury''{{'s}} focus on PvP combat differentiated it from traditional RPGs that center around [[player versus environment]] (PvE) content against [[non-player character]]s. However, like most RPGs, ''Fury'' used collectible equipment, skills, and a ranking mechanism for players. ''Fury'' used a method of matching equally ranked players from across the world in PvP matches.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

''Fury'' further differentiated itself from traditional RPGs by making many of its [[magic (gaming)|spells]] and abilities activate instantly and lacking a [[cooldown]] period. The pace of gameplay thus tended to be faster than PvP combat in traditional RPGs. For example, spell-casters in ''Fury'' were sometimes not frozen in place when casting a spell, which allowed them to retreat and avoid obstacles that might otherwise have locked them in.

==Development==
The game was initially well received in beta testing and during a pre-release event known as the ''Fury Challenge''; however, many aspects of the game were changed before the public release.

At the beginning of 2008, a large change was made to the game mechanics and the business plan of ''Fury''. This made the game completely free to play, with the option of upgrading to the two previous payment options: retail price (a one-time fee), and Immortal (monthly payments). Additionally, all players prior to this large patch were given Immortal status free for life.

A new business plan was drafted late in the game's life which attempted to save the game. This plan included a match limit for free players and the possibility for skilled players to turn their skill into cash; however, the servers shut down before this plan was ever implemented.

'''GOOG-411''' (or '''Google Voice Local Search''') was a [[telephone]] service launched by [[Google]] in 2007, that provided a [[speech recognition|speech-recognition]]-based business [[directory assistance|directory search]], and placed a [[phone call|call]] to the resulting [[phone number|number]] in the [[United States]] or [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/goog411/about.html |title=1-800-GOOG-411: Find and connect with local businesses for free from your phone. |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=2009-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227084550/https://www.google.com/goog411/about.html |archivedate=February 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The service was accessible via a [[toll-free telephone number]].  It was an alternative to [[4-1-1]], an often-expensive service provided by [[local exchange carrier|local]] and [[long-distance calling|long-distance]] [[phone companies]], and was therefore commonly known as '''Google 411'''.  This service was discontinued on November 12, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/10/goodbye-to-old-friend-1-800-goog-411.html |title=Official Blog: Goodbye to an old friend: 1-800-GOOG-411 |publisher=Googleblog.blogspot.com |date=2010-10-08 |accessdate=2013-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
GOOG 411 had been assisting people with obtaining phone numbers since 2007. On November 12, 2010, GOOG-411 shut down its service. While Google did not provide an official reason for the shut down, many believe that Google had simply gathered enough voice samples for its research purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chitu |first=Alex |url=http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2010/10/google-shuts-down-goog-411.html |title=Google Shuts Down GOOG-411 |publisher=Googlesystem.blogspot.com |date=2010-10-09 |accessdate=2013-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://buildcontext.com/blog/2011/the-411-parable |title="The 411 Parable": Make sure you are playing the same game. &lt; blog :: buildcontext the personal blog of Ben Hedrington |publisher=Buildcontext.com |date=2011-05-03 |accessdate=2013-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google also operated a similar service from SMS number 466453 which has also been discontinued.

==Operations==
Users who called the [[toll-free telephone number]]s 800-466-4411 or 877-466-4411 (800-GOOG-411 and 877-GOOG-411) or the local number [[area code 425|425]]-296-4774&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mobile.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=114953 |title= Using : Corporate or commercial users - Mobile Help |publisher= [[Google]] |accessdate= November 5, 2009 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20091211121927/http://mobile.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=114953 |archivedate= December 11, 2009 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; were asked for the city and state of the sought business.  Users were also able to search for by business name or category, which generated a list of up to eight search results.  Search was also invoked by using the [[keypad]] if the user preferred.  This worked in a similar manner to [[predictive text]] input on a [[cellular phone]].  Users were able to select the destination by speaking or pressing the number that corresponded to the desired result.  Once the destination was selected, the service placed a call to the business or returned a [[short message service|text message]] with the phone number.  Alternatively, users were able to listen to the [[street address]] and phone number by saying "details".  U.S. users could narrow search results by [[ZIP code]] or street [[intersection (road)|intersection]].

Although Google's [[FAQ]] stated that users were able to prevent their phone number from being saved by blocking their [[caller ID]], this is ineffective when calling the 800 number (due to [[Automatic Number Identification|ANI]]) and only works when calling the other two.&lt;ref&gt;this can be verified by pressing &lt;code&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;*&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/code&gt; at the opening message&lt;/ref&gt;
The service announced that the [[call recording software|call may be recorded]] for the purpose of service improvements.

Google advised users not to use the service for [[emergency call]]s, recommending that they call [[9-1-1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mobile.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=91565&amp;topic=13551 |title=Overview: Emergency Calls |publisher=Google Inc. |accessdate=2009-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081214204654/http://mobile.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=91565&amp;topic=13551 |archivedate=December 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Homophobia in hip hop culture''' is the homophobic attitude from [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] artists towards [[LGBT people]], in the form of song lyrics that use [[Anti-gay slogan|anti-gay slurs]] and normalize [[violence against LGBT people]].

In 1979, the [[Sugarhill Gang]] released "[[Rapper’s Delight]]", which is the first hip hop record to become a top 40 hit. Although their homophobia was minuscule{{According to whom|date=May 2017}} compared to other rappers in hip hop, “Rapper’s Delight” did exhibit slights to fictional character Superman, who was referred to as a “fairy” for wearing a tight suit. 

In 1986, the hip hop trio [[Beastie Boys]] originally wanted to name their debut album ''Don’t Be A Faggot'', but their record label [[Columbia Records]] refused to release it under that title, so it changed to ''[[Licensed To Ill]]''. Years later, the Beastie Boys formally apologized to the [[LGBT community]] for the “shitty and ignorant” things they said on their first record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://globalgrind.com/1889805/hip-hops-history-homophobia-list-videos/|title=Hip-Hop’s History Of Homophobia (LIST)|author=|date=September 18, 2012|website=GlobalGrind.com|access-date=May 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In song lyrics ==
Ice-T stated on his autobiography that record-label executive [[Seymour Stein]] took the exception to a homophobic line in his song "409": "''Guys grab a girl, girls grab a guy/If a guy wants a guy, please take it outside''".&lt;ref name="Ice"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marrow |first1=Tracy |authorlink1= |last2=Century |first2=Douglas |title=Ice: A Memoir of Gangster Life and Redemption—from South Central to Hollywood |year=2011 |publisher=Random House |isbn=978-0-345-52328-0 |pages=100-101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ice-T later became one of the first rappers to condemn homophobia on raps such as ''Straight Up Nigga'' and ''The Tower'' in his album ''[[OG Original Gangster]]''.

Many songs by rapper [[Eminem]] have been considered homophobic for his frequent use of anti-gay slurs, especially the song "Criminal" from his third album ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP]]'' (2000), which containing lines like: "My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge, That'll stab you in the head, whether you're a fag or lez. pants or dress? Hate fags? The answer's 'yes'". In an interview with [[Anderson Cooper]] on ''[[60 Minutes]]'', Eminem denies being homophobic and explained the frequent use of the slur "faggot" in his lyrics, that this word was "thrown around constantly" in battle rapping and he does not refer it to gay people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024025240/http://www.towleroad.com/2010/10/eminem-discusses-homophobic-lyrics-with-anderson-cooper.html|title=Eminem Discusses Homophobic Lyrics With Anderson Cooper- News - Towleroad|date=24 October 2012|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album ''The Marshall Mathers LP'' was nominated for [[Album of the Year (Grammy)|Album of the Year]] by the [[Grammy Awards 2001]], which leads to protests due to the album's controversial content. At the show, Eminem performed "[[Stan (song)|Stan]]" with openly gay musician [[Elton John]] as response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elton-john-eminem-homophobia_us_58d519ace4b03787d3573e58|title=Elton John Defends Eminem Against Charges Of Homophobia|first=Cavan|last=Sieczkowski|date=24 March 2017|accessdate=24 December 2017|publisher=[[Huff Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lyrics of one song on rapper [[Trick-Trick]]'s 2008 album ''[[The Villain (album)|The Villain]]'', he refers to [[Ellen DeGeneres]] and [[Rosie O'Donnell]] as "dyke bitches" and says he will send a "scud missile right through their fucking cruise ship". Trick-Trick expressed his dislike towards homosexuals in an interview with music site [[AllHipHop]]: “Faggots hate me and I don’t give a fuck. I don’t want your faggot money any goddam way.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.towleroad.com/2008/11/us-rapper-trick/|title=U.S. Rapper Trick Trick Tells Gays Not to Buy His Homophobic Album - Towleroad|author=|date=November 12, 2008|website=Towleroad.com|access-date=May 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hounds and Jackals''' is the modern name given to an [[Ancient Egypt]]ian game, that is known from several examples of [[board game|gaming boards]] and gaming pieces found in excavations. The modern name was invented by [[Howard Carter]], who found one complete gaming set in a [[Thebes, Egypt|Theban]] tomb that dates to the [[13th Dynasty]]. The latter game set is one of the best preserved examples and is today in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[[William C. Hayes]]: ''The Scepter of Egypt, I. From the Earliest Times to the End of the Middle Kingdom'', New York 1953 {{ISBN|0-87099-190-6}}, 250, fig. 160&lt;/ref&gt; He called it ''Hounds contra Jackals''. Another modern name for this game, but not so often used is '''fifty-eight holes'''.&lt;ref name=vaturi&gt;Anne Elizabeth Dunn-Vaturi: ''Game of Hounds and Jackals'', in: A. Oppenheim, d. Arnold, D. Arnold, Kei Yamamoto (editors): ''Ancient Egypt Transformed, The Middle Kingdom'', New York 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-58839-564-1}}, 249, no. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

The gaming board has two sets of 29 holes. Gaming pieces are ten small sticks with either jackal or dog heads. The aim of the game was perhaps to start at one point on the board and to reach with all figures another point on the board. The game appeared in Egypt, around 2000 BC and was mainly popular in the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=vaturi/&gt; However, it is also known from Mesopotamia and the Caucasus.&lt;ref name = "Bower2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Bower|first1= B.|title= A Bronze Age game called 58 holes was found chiseled into stone in Azerbaijan|journal= [[Science News]]|volume= 194|issue= |pages= |date= 2018-11-16|url= https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bronze-age-game-found-chiseled-stone-azerbaijan|access-date= 2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1956 movie [[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|''The 10 Commandments'']], Pharaoh Seti and Nefretiri are depicted playing the game.

'''Independent Local Radio''' is the collective name given to [[Commercial broadcasting|commercial radio]] stations in the [[United Kingdom]]. As a result of the buyouts and mergers permitted by the Broadcasting Act of 1990, and deregulation resulting from the Communications Act 2003, most commercial stations are now neither independent nor local. The same name is used for Independent Local Radio in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

==History==
{{Further information|Timeline of independent radio in the United Kingdom}}
===Development of ILR===
Until the early 1970s, the [[BBC]] had a legal [[monopoly]] on radio broadcasting in the UK. Despite competition from the commercial [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] and, for a period in the mid-1960s, the off-shore "[[Marine Broadcasting Offences Act|pirate]]" broadcasters, it had remained the policy of both major political parties that radio was to remain under the BBC.

Upon the election of [[Edward Heath]]'s government in 1970, this policy changed. It is possible that Heath's victory was partly due to younger voters upset by the UK government closing down the popular pirate radio stations.

The new Minister of Post and Telecommunications, [[Christopher Chataway]], announced a Bill to allow for the introduction of commercial radio in the United Kingdom. This service would be planned and regulated in a similar manner to the existing [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] service and would compete with the recently developed [[BBC Local Radio]] services (rather than the four national BBC services).

The Sound Broadcasting Act{{Ref|SBA}} received [[Royal Assent]] on 12 July 1972 and the [[Independent Television Authority]] (ITA) accordingly changed its name to the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] (IBA) that same day.{{Ref|BTA}}

The IBA immediately began to plan the new service, placing advertisements encouraging interested groups to apply for medium-term contracts to provide programmes in given areas. The first major areas to be advertised were [[London]] and [[Glasgow]], with two contracts available in London, one for "news and information", one for "general and entertainment".{{Ref|TR85}}

The London news contract was awarded to [[LBC|London Broadcasting Company]] (LBC) and they began broadcasting on 8 October 1973. The London general contract went to [[Capital London|Capital Radio]], who began broadcasting on 16 October 1973.  In total, 19 contracts were awarded between 1973 and 1976. Due to government limits on capital expenditure and turbulence in the broadcasting field (mainly due to the [[Annan Report]]), no further contracts were awarded until 1980, when a second tranche of contracts were awarded. All stations were awarded an [[AM broadcasting|AM]] and an [[FM broadcasting|FM]] frequency, on which they broadcast the same service.

===Extension of ILR===
In the late 1980s, the expansion of ILR continued at a similar rate. Under the Broadcasting Acts, the IBA had a duty to ensure that any area it licensed for radio could support a station with the available advertising revenue. Therefore, many areas were not included in the IBA's ILR plans as it was felt that they were not viable.{{Ref|TR81}} This did not prevent Radio West in Bristol getting into financial trouble and having to merge with Wiltshire Radio on 1 October 1985;{{Ref|GWR}} nor did it prevent Centre Radio going into receivership on 6 October 1983.{{Ref|Centre}}

===Split services===
Nevertheless, the areas served by ILR continued to increase and 1986 the IBA sanctioned in principle the idea that different services could be broadcast on each station's FM and AM frequency. The first experimental part-time split service was provided by [[Radio Forth]], who created Festival City Radio for the duration of the [[Edinburgh Festival]] in 1984{{Ref|FestivalCityRadio}}. The first station to permanently split their frequencies was [[Guildford|Guildford's]] [[County Sound]]{{Ref|CountySound}} who rebranded the FM output as Premier Radio and turned the AM output into a new golden oldies station, County Sound Gold in 1988. Other stations then followed suit.

By 1988, the government had decided that the practice of splitting was beneficial and a quick way to increase choice for listeners. The IBA then began a programme of encouraging ILR stations to split their services and most stations had soon complied. The usual format was to have a "gold" (oldies) service on AM and pop music on FM, although Radio City tried "City Talk" on AM before abandoning the format.

==The Broadcasting Act 1990==
The [[1990 Broadcasting Act]] provided for the abolition of the IBA and its replacement by the [[Independent Television Commission]]. The IBA continued to regulate radio under the new name of the Radio Authority, but with a different remit.

As a "light-touch" regulator (although heavier than the ITC), the Radio Authority was to issue licences to the highest bidder and promote the development of commercial radio choice.{{Ref|WA2006}}

===INR, RSLs, SALLIES and IRR===
This led to the awarding of three national contracts (known as Independent National Radio, but still usually referred to under the banner of "ILR" by most commentators) to [[Classic FM (UK)|Classic FM]], Virgin 1215 (later [[Virgin Radio]] and then rebranded [[Absolute Radio]]) and Talk Radio (later [[talkSPORT]]).

The Radio Authority also began to license [[Restricted Service Licence]] (RSL) stations – low-power temporary radio stations for special events, operating for up to 28 days a year – and to reduce the criteria for a "viable service area" with the introduction of Small Scale Local Licences (SALLIES) for villages, special interest groups and small communities.{{Ref|RLG2003}}

By this time the [[medium wave]] band had become unpopular with radio groups and the majority of new stations were awarded an FM licence only, even when an AM licence was jointly available.

The Radio Authority also introduced regional stations (Independent Regional Radio, again usually grouped under the banner "ILR" by most commentators) and began to license the commercial [[Digital Audio Broadcasting]] (DAB) multiplexes in October 1998.{{Ref label|WA2006|10|a}}

The Radio Authority was replaced by the Office of Communications ([[Ofcom]]) in 2004, which also replaced the ITC, the Broadcasting Standards Commission, the Radio Communications Agency and the Office of Telecommunications (Oftel). Ofcom has stated that they plan to continue the development of Independent Local Radio, with an emphasis on digital broadcasting, and to "ensure the character" of local stations, following the mergers and loss of local identities that followed the 1990 Act.{{Ref label|WA2006|10|b}}

==ILR stations==
As of 2005, there are 217 licensed analogue ILR and IRR services in [[England]]; 16 in [[Wales]]; 34 in [[Scotland]]; eight in [[Northern Ireland]]; and two in the [[Channel Islands]]. These are ''licences'' rather than ''franchises''. Some licences are grouped nationally, regionally or by format to provide one service; other licences cover two or more services.{{Ref label|WA2006|10|c}}

There are three national analogue services. There is one national DAB service (Digital One) and 47 regional DAB services, owned by 10 and operated by nine companies.{{Ref|Ofcom}}

===Manx Radio===
The first licensed commercial radio station in the United Kingdom is often stated to be [[Manx Radio]], which launched in June 1964.{{Ref|Manx}} However, since the [[Isle of Man]] is not part of the United Kingdom, Manx Radio is not considered to be an ILR station and launched with a [[General Post Office|Post Office]] licence. Manx Radio is funded by a mixture of commercial advertising and a yearly £860,000 Manx Government subvention.

==History==
When [[Zuffa]], parent company of the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]], purchased rival promotion [[Strikeforce (mixed martial arts)|Strikeforce]] in {{start date|2011|03}}, Shannon Knapp received several calls from female fighters who were afraid of what the future might hold for them in Strikeforce since the UFC had never promoted a women's fight.&lt;ref name="Debut - Fighters" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Debut - Bleacher Report"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the women were calling Knapp for representation, she started looking at the issue and met Janet Martin, and between the two acquired the financial resources needed.&lt;ref name="Debut - SI.com"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Invicta'', a [[Latin]] word for "invincible and incomparable", was chosen by founders Knapp and Martin since the terms invincible and incomparable are very masculine, but the term appears in the feminine form in Latin, and they thought it was a good description for women's MMA.&lt;ref name="Martin interview"&gt;{{cite web

===Free online streamed events===

After more than a year in the making,&lt;ref name="Debut - SI.com" /&gt; the promotion held its first event, [[Invicta FC events#Invicta FC 1: Coenen vs. Ruyssen|Invicta FC 1]] on {{start date|2012|04|28}}.&lt;ref name="Invicta 1 debut"&gt;{{cite web

[[Liz Carmouche]] and [[Jessica Penne]] both received social media bonuses.&lt;ref name="Invicta 1 bonuses"&gt;{{cite web

On June 9, it was announced that Invicta has formed a strategic partnership with Japanese promotion [[Jewels (mixed martial arts)|JEWELS]] to cross-promote the world's top female fighters on their respective fight cards in the United States and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Invicta then held its second event ([[Invicta FC events#Invicta FC 2: Baszler vs. McMann|Invicta FC 2: Baszler vs. McMann]]) on July 28, 2012. Like the first event, it was made available as a free stream on the promotion's official website. The event was headlined by 
[[Wrestling at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Women's freestyle 63 kg#Medalists|2004 Summer Olympics women's freestyle wrestling silver medalist]] [[Sara McMann]] and [[Shayna Baszler]].&lt;ref name="Invicta 1 headliner"&gt;{{cite web

[[Carla Esparza]] and [[Barb Honchak]] made their promotional debuts on this card. As part of the alliance with Japanese promotion Jewels, Jewels lightweight champion [[Ayaka Hamasaki]] was set to face undefeated Austrian fighter Jasminka Cive as part of the main event but Cive was unable to secure her visa in time and was replaced by Lacey Shuckman.&lt;ref name="Jewels" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ishikawa"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 24, 2012, Invicta announced a strategic alliance with the [[Super Fight League]], which aims to bring the best Indian female fighters to Invicta, whilst Invicta will aim to send world class female mixed martial artists to the Super Fight League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mmapundit.co.uk/2012/09/24/invicta-fc-forms-strategic-alliance-with-super-fight-league-to-develop-womens-mma-talent/ |title=Super Fight League to Develop Women's MMA Talent |first= |last= |publisher=mmapundit.co.uk |date=September 24, 2012 |accessdate=September 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sara McMann]] was originally scheduled to fight for the [[Invicta Fighting Championships#Current champions|Invicta FC Bantamweight Championship]] at Invicta FC 3 but this did not occur due to an injury to McMann.

[[Invicta FC events#Invicta FC 3: Penne vs. Sugiyama|Invicta FC 3: Penne vs. Sugiyama]] took place on October 6, 2012. Invicta continued their partnership with Jewels as [[Jessica Penne]] faced and beat the previously undefeated Jewels 105&amp;nbsp;lb champion [[Naho Sugiyama]] for the inaugural [[Invicta Fighting Championships#Current champions|Invicta FC Atomweight Championship]].

Also at Invicta FC 3, Leslie Smith fought [[Kaitlin Young]] in a rematch from their exciting "fight of the night" Invicta FC 1 bout where they fought to a draw. This time, Smith was able to get the better of Young and defeated her by TKO in the second round.&lt;ref name="Invicta FC 2 Results"&gt;{{cite web

Fight of the night bonuses went to [[Michelle Waterson]] and Lacey Schuckman. The submission of the night bonus was split between Jessamyn Duke and Stephanie Frausto while knockout of the night went to promotional newcomer [[Joanne Calderwood]].

===Move to online pay-per-view events===

On December 19, 2012, Shannon Knapp announced Invicta FC 4 would air as an online pay-per-view.

Invicta Fighting Championships held their fourth event ([[Invicta FC events#Invicta FC 4: Esparza vs. Hyatt|Invicta FC 4: Esparza vs. Hyatt]]) on January 5, 2013. The event was headlined by the inaugural [[Invicta Fighting Championships#Current champions|Invicta FC Strawweight Championship]] bout between [[Carla Esparza]] and [[Bec Hyatt]] (in Hyatt's promotional debut). Esparza was originally scheduled to fight [[Ayaka Hamasaki]] for the title but Hamasaki pulled out of the fight due to commitments to defending her JEWELS lightweight title. Hamasaki was originally replaced by undefeated Brazilian fighter Claudia Gadelha but on December 28, Gadelha was also forced to withdraw after suffering a broken nose in training. Esparza defeated Hyatt to become the first [[Invicta Fighting Championships#Current champions|Invicta FC Strawweight Champion]]. Also [[Alexis Davis (fighter)|Alexis Davis]] defeated [[Shayna Baszler]] in the card's fight of the night and Rose Namajunas won knock-out of the night in her professional [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]] debut.

Due to purchasing issues on the night of the event, the event was streamed for free rather than pay per view and it was announced that all buyers would be refunded.

[[Invicta FC events#Invicta FC 5: Penne vs. Waterson|Invicta FC 5: Penne vs. Waterson]] took place on April 5, 2013. The card was headlined by [[Jessica Penne]] who lost her [[Invicta Fighting Championships#Current champions|Invicta FC Atomweight Championship]] to "The Karate Hottie" [[Michelle Waterson]]. The event featured a co-main event of Vanessa Porto vs. [[Barb Honchak]] with the latter being crowned as the first [[Invicta Fighting Championships#Current champions|Invicta FC Flyweight Champion]]. In addition, [[Sarah Kaufman (fighter)|Sarah Kaufman]] and "Cyborg" [[Cristiane Justino]] both won in their Invicta FC debuts. On this occasion, the online pay per view went smoothly, avoiding any issues experiences at Invicta FC 4.

During Invicta FC 5, there were no issues with the Ustream pay-per-view system as there had been in January.

===Televised pay-per-view===

[[Invicta FC events#Invicta FC 6: Coenen vs. Cyborg|Invicta FC 6: Coenen vs. Cyborg]] took place on 13 July 2013, featuring the crowning of [[Cristiane Justino|Cristiane "Cyborg" Justino]] as the inaugural [[Featherweight]] champion and a [[Strawweight]] title eliminator match won by [[Claudia Gadelha]] over [[Ayaka Hamasaki]] (previously unbeaten JEWELS lightweight champion). The winner will face champion [[Carla Esparza]]. The card also featured wins by [[Jessica Penne]], [[Lauren Taylor (Fighter)|Lauren Taylor]], [[Tecia Torres]], [[Leslie Smith (fighter)|Leslie Smith]] and [[Joanne Calderwood]].

This event was aired on cable and satellite pay-per-view in the United States and Canada in addition to their online PPV stream, as the promotion had come to a deal with Integrated Sports Media for live viewing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmajunkie.com/news/2013/06/invicta-fc-6-to-air-on-cable-and-satellite-pay-per-view-in-u-s-and-canada|title=Invicta FC 6 to air on cable and satellite pay-per-view in U.S. and Canada|work=MMAjunkie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UFC Fight Pass===
In early 2014 an agreement with the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] was announced to air all future Invicta FC events exclusively on the UFC's subscription-based digital streaming service, [[UFC Fight Pass]], and that the entire Invicta FC fight library would be added to the "On Demand" part of [[UFC Fight Pass]]. On July 10, Invicta and the UFC held a joint conference call to announce that Invicta FC 8 would be the first event to stream live on Fight Pass. The September 6th event was to be headlined by [[Michelle Waterson|Michelle Waterson's]] first title defense of her [[Atomweight (MMA)|atomweight]] belt vs. [[Yasuko Tamada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2014/7/10/5888381/invicta-fc-8-waterson-vs-tamada-set-for-ufc-fight-pass-debut|title=Invicta FC 8: Waterson vs. Tamada set for UFC Fight Pass debut|author=Shaun Al-Shatti|date=10 July 2014|work=MMA Fighting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combate===

On February 24, it was announced the partnership between Invicta and [[Globosat|Combate]]. The deal allows the Brazilian channel the broadcast of Invicta live events as well the event library of Invicta in the South American country. The first Invicta event broadcast on Combate was [[Invicta FC events#Invicta FC 11: Cyborg vs. Tweet|Invicta FC 11: Cyborg vs. Tweet]] showing the Brazilian Invicta's featherweight champion Cris Cyborg versus the Canadian challenger Charmaine Tweet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportv.globo.com/site/combate/noticia/2015/02/combate-transmite-ao-vivo-defesa-de-titulo-de-cris-cyborg-no-invicta-fc-11.html|title=Combate transmite ao vivo defesa de título de Cris Cyborg no Invicta FC 11|work=sportv.globo.com/site/combate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Earl Kenneth "Ken" Forsse''' (September 17, 1936 – March 19, 2014) was an [[United States|American]] inventor, author, and producer who created the toy [[Teddy Ruxpin]] and the subsequent animated series ''[[The Adventures of Teddy Ruxpin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Alchemy II Makes Technology Cuddly Company Tries to Conjure Up Cash With New Talking Bear |publisher= The Los Angeles Times|date=November 24, 1985|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1985-11-24/business/fi-1921_1|accessdate=2010-08-22 | first=Alan | last=Goldstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lovable Teddy Ruxpin evolves from toy to animated star of his own half-hour program thanks to Crawley Films, Toronto Star - October 31, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

After working for [[The Walt Disney Company]], [[Sid &amp; Marty Krofft]] Entertainment and other entertainment companies, he founded Alchemy II, Inc. One of Alchemy II's first projects was building the animatronic characters used on the television show ''[[Welcome to Pooh Corner]]''. Forsse and his team then brought Teddy Ruxpin to the marketplace. Teddy Ruxpin became the top selling toy of 1985 and 1986&lt;ref name="PRWeb"&gt;[http://www.emediawire.com/releases/2006/9/emw439779.htm Teddy Ruxpin Earns Top Spot in 2006 Toy Awards]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, PRWeb, September 21, 2006.

Accessed February 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and was made by [[Worlds of Wonder (toy company)|Worlds of Wonder]].

In 2005, Alchemy II made an agreement with toy manufacturer BackPack Toys to have Teddy Ruxpin back on the shelves yet again and the toy made a return in 2006 before being discontinued again in 2010. In addition, the animated TV series was released for the first time on DVD in 2008.&lt;ref name="BW"&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2005_May_24/ai_n13776117 "He's Back!

On February 19, 2018, independent filmmaker Billy Tooma announced that he was entering into development/pre-production on a feature-length documentary titled ''Ken Forsse: Come Dream with Me Tonight'', with a 2021 release date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Tooma|first=Billy|title=Ken Forsse: Come Dream with Me Tonight|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8031636/|others=Vincent Conroy, Jan Forsse, Josh Isaacson|accessdate=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a list of [[Sketch comedy|sketches]] which debuted on ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]]'' on [[NBC]].

==Carried over from ''Late Night''==
Many sketches originated on O'Brien's original show, ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' and were carried over to, and continued on ''The Tonight Show'' during O'Brien's short reign.
The sketches include:

{{col-end}}

==Twitter Tracker==
In this sketch, Conan is interrupted by an overzealous announcer (voiced by show writer [[Brian McCann (actor)|Brian McCann]]) while lamenting the increasing number of celebrities who are using [[Twitter]]. The announcer attempts to prove to Conan that celebrity tweets are exciting by reading some of his favorites, which all describe mundane activities or are bland statements. Some examples include [[Ashton Kutcher]] reporting that he is going to the grocery store, and [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]] saying that the weather is beautiful.

The sketch is always accompanied by increasingly elaborate animations in which the bird from the Twitter logo is repeatedly killed. It also includes the announcer trying to persuade Conan to play a game by using a rhyming sentence in which he refers to him as CoCo. Past games have included Complete the Tweet, Trick or Tweet, and Beat the Tweet.

On Thanksgiving, ''The Tonight Show'' celebrated Tweetsgiving, during which the announcer read celebrity twanks (tweets that give thanks). [[Christmas]] and [[Chanukah]]-themed tweets were read during the holiday season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jay Leno |url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/holiday-twitter-tracker-122109/1187894/ |title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno &amp;#124; Watch Episodes and Video Online for Free - NBC Official Site |publisher=Tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120914133936/http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/holiday-twitter-tracker-122109/1187894/ |archivedate=2012-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tweetsgiving game was "Pilgrim or Pornstar?", where Conan had to guess if the following tweet was by a pilgrim or a porn star.

==Conan's Tabloid Moment==
Having acknowledged the higher profile that comes with being host of ''The Tonight Show'', Conan schemes to beat the [[paparazzi]] at their own game by photographing himself in embarrassing situations and selling the pictures directly to the [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloids]]. To manufacture these moments, Conan makes use of a [[green screen]] and some inexpensive props. Past moments have included Conan running over a bible salesman, stealing underwear from [[Barbara Walters]], loading a corpse into the trunk of a car, and kicking babies at a playground (all while drunk).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jay Leno |url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/conans-tabloid-moment-121709/1186652/ |title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno &amp;#124; Watch Episodes and Video Online for Free - NBC Official Site |publisher=Tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091219191003/http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/conans-tabloid-moment-121709/1186652/ |archivedate=2009-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traffic Copter==
As Conan discusses L.A.'s chronic traffic problems, he calls for a view from ''The Tonight Show'''s traffic copter. The scene then shifts to a fake road filled with gridlocked toy cars. The cause of the traffic jam would always be something absurd, such as a dog celebrating its [[bar mitzvah]], a marauding robot, or a giant [[Amy Winehouse]] passed out on the road. Based on a former sketch used on his previous show in similar fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jay Leno |url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/tonight-show-traffic-copter-090309/1153972/?__cid=nbceditorial |title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno &amp;#124; Watch Episodes and Video Online for Free - NBC Official Site |publisher=Tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121044056/http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/tonight-show-traffic-copter-090309/1153972/ |archivedate=January 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trump Properties==
After discussing something topical, Conan will present a video from [[Donald Trump]]. In the video, Trump divulges his plans as they relate to the topic. These plans always include constructing something ridiculously expensive, such as a parking space paved with imported marble or a resort on the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jay Leno |url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/trump-moon-bay-111709/1176867/?__cid=nbceditorial |title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno &amp;#124; Watch Episodes and Video Online for Free - NBC Official Site |publisher=Tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Andy'll Try It==
In this sketch, [[Andy Richter|Andy]] is given a product to test and review. Past products have included [[Bacon vodka]], a flaming bra worn by [[Lady Gaga]], and a skydiving simulator.

On one occasion, Andy was presented with a Tofurky and Gravy flavored [[Jones Soda]]. After refusing to try it, the sketch was renamed "Just Shut Up and Drink It" and the unpleasant task was passed along to [[Richie "LaBamba" Rosenberg|LaBamba]], who instantly gagged and regurgitated the beverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jay Leno |url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/andyll-try-it-112409/1179348/?__cid=nbceditorial |title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno &amp;#124; Watch Episodes and Video Online for Free - NBC Official Site |publisher=Tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After discussing an interesting news story, Conan would sometimes introduce a tangentially related guest who he would claim was appearing live via satellite. At the beginning of the interview Conan would often note the surprisingly good quality of the satellite feed or simply call the technology very expensive. In reality, the guest would actually be in front of a false wall or [[chroma key|green screen]] just a few feet away from Conan and in full view of the studio audience. At the end of the interview, the guest would sometimes walk off camera while still in split-screen format and cross in front of Conan's camera, clearly demonstrating that he was there the whole time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jay Leno |url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/spammer-jailed-120109/1181073/?__cid=nbceditorial |title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno &amp;#124; Watch Episodes and Video Online for Free - NBC Official Site |publisher=Tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wax Fonzie and Wax Tom Cruise==
While visiting a warehouse full of poor quality celebrity wax figures, Conan identified two as his favorite and purchased them. One was of [[Henry Winkler]] as his [[Happy Days]] character [[Arthur Fonzarelli]] (whose hand positioning caused Conan to comment that he had just finished up at the urinal), and the other was a creepy-looking figure of [[Tom Cruise]]. Both wax figures made several appearances on the show.

In addition to appearing in various places around the studio (such as at the urinal in the men's washroom),  Wax Fonzie and Wax Tom Cruise were also spotted at the [[2008-09 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles Lakers' 2009 NBA championship]] celebration and were incorporated into many recurring sketches on the show (such as an installment of "Conan's Tabloid Moment" where Wax Fonzie played a corpse and Wax Tom Cruise played a murderous accomplice).

Both figures were routinely placed in dangerous situations and sustained damage. Wax Tom Cruise was decapitated and dismembered while testing out Universal's skydiving simulator during an installment of "Andy'll Try It". Meanwhile, Wax Fonzie was stabbed while acting as Conan's assistant during a knife-throwing segment. Both figures later were shot out of circus cannons. Wax Tom Cruise emerged unscathed, but Wax Fonzie landed on his face and was horribly mangled. When he was brought out at a later date as part of a "Prop Auction" sketch, the audience audibly gasped in amusement at his appearance.

Wax Fonzie was last seen sitting in the car that was blown up at the conclusion of the "Conan, Please Blow Up My Car" contest, and was presumably destroyed after the explosion. Wax Tom Cruise was stationed nearby to say farewell.

Wax Tom Cruise eventually returned during an installment of "America's New Oprah" and was made to re-enact the real Tom Cruise's infamous couch-jumping incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jay Leno |url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/conan-is-the-new-oprah-4-112509/1179658/?__cid=nbceditorial |title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno &amp;#124; Watch Episodes and Video Online for Free - NBC Official Site |publisher=Tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the end of the Tonight Show controversy in January, Wax Tom Cruise was featured on Twitter in a picture, wearing a "Team Conan" shirt.

==A Message from All On TV==
After reaching significant milestones in his career, Conan would present a message he claimed was sent to him from his peers in the television industry. The message would consist of a series of clips from various news and talk shows that had been spliced together to create the message to Conan. The message would usually close by insulting either Andy or Max.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jay Leno |url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/congrats-from-everybody-on-tv-110909/1174035/?__cid=nbceditorial |title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno &amp;#124; Watch Episodes and Video Online for Free - NBC Official Site |publisher=Tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A Rebuttal from Conan's Father==
After Conan says something respectful and thoughtful about senior citizens, he will receive a video rebuttal message from his dad. In the message, Conan's dad belittles Conan's achievements and describes him as insincere and uncaring. He also notes how Conan pales in comparison to his older brother. It is sometimes even suggested that Conan's brother has died as a result of Conan's stupidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jay Leno |url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/a-message-from-conans-dad-112609/1179971/?__cid=nbceditorial |title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno &amp;#124; Watch Episodes and Video Online for Free - NBC Official Site |publisher=Tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conan Visits His Neighbors==
Conan visits various businesses near the Universal Studios lot, poking fun at the bizarre establishments he finds. Past businesses have included a pornography studio, a tattoo parlor operated by a man named Freak Show, and a store that exclusively sells items decorated like the American flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jay Leno |url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/conan-visits-more-of-his-neighbors-120309/1181862/?__cid=nbceditorial |title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno &amp;#124; Watch Episodes and Video Online for Free - NBC Official Site |publisher=Tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wing Pang==
On August 7, 2009, a remote piece aired featuring Conan's visit to a NBC/Universal Studios Gift Shop. During the filming of the remote, Conan interviewed a NBC employee by the name of Wing Pang. Conan was visibly impressed by the man's natural comedic timing and sincere personality and the focus of the remote shifted from the NBC store to Wing Pang, himself. Directly after the airing of the segment, Conan brought Wing Pang on stage and thanked him for his participation in the remote. Wing Pang went on to make two more appearances, the first of which aired on Nov. 5 which was another remote piece featuring an interview between Conan and Wing followed by a fencing match between the two. Wing's third and final appearance was on Nov. 26, which was another remote, this time featuring Conan's [[Thanksgiving]] dinner with Wing as well as Jordan Schlansky and [[Pierre Bernard (comedian)|Pierre Bernard]].

==Bon Voyage, Max==
Whenever [[Max Weinberg]] goes on tour with [[Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band]], Conan will imply that Max must leave the show immediately in order to make his flight. The entire platform on which Max sits will then start moving as Max continues to drum. The motorized platform goes out into the street, presumably on its way to the airport. Various things might occur along the way, such as Max stopping at a drive-thru or Max being hit by a large truck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jay Leno |url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/bon-voyage-max-092809/1161692/ |title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno &amp;#124; Watch Episodes and Video Online for Free - NBC Official Site |publisher=Tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120917145221/http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/bon-voyage-max-092809/1161692/ |archivedate=2012-09-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Checking in on Max in Europe==
In this sketch, Conan reveals that [[Max Weinberg]] has allowed a camera crew to follow him while touring in Europe with [[Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band]]. Conan then decides to check and see what Max is doing at that particular moment. A [[stock footage]] clip of a person involved in an altercation with police is then shown. The intent is for the audience to believe this person is Max.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jay Leno |url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/checking-in-on-max-in-europe-073109/1141012/?__cid=nbceditorial |title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno &amp;#124; Watch Episodes and Video Online for Free - NBC Official Site |publisher=Tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tonight Show Tour-iffic Tram-tacular==
When their studio was added to the [[Studio Tour|Universal Studios Tour]], Conan acknowledged that it could not compete with the other stops on the tour. In order to compensate for this, Conan and Andy would act out exciting scenarios as the tour passed the studio. Past scenarios have included Conan delivering Andy's baby and Conan curing Andy's paralysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jay Leno |url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/tonight-show-tramtacular-100709/1164675/?__cid=nbceditorial |title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno &amp;#124; Watch Episodes and Video Online for Free - NBC Official Site |publisher=Tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Back Row Entertainment==
Feeling that those audience members seated at the back of the studio did not get as good an experience as those seated near the front in "the Cone Zone", Conan would arrange for some special entertainment in the back row. This entertainment was usually something underwhelming, such as a hamster race or a bodybuilder posing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jay Leno |url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/back-row-mr-universe-110309/1172439/?__cid=nbceditorial |title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno &amp;#124; Watch Episodes and Video Online for Free - NBC Official Site |publisher=Tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kiss Cam==
Inspired by a recent trip to [[Dodger Stadium]], Conan introduces the concept of couples sharing a kiss when the camera settles on them. These sketches typically deviate from this standard formula by including several odd pairings, such as a hunter making out with a bear or a nerdy [[Harry Potter]] fan groping an imaginary woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jay Leno |url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/tonight-show-kiss-cam-073109/1141013/?__cid=nbceditorial |title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno &amp;#124; Watch Episodes and Video Online for Free - NBC Official Site |publisher=Tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conan and Andy Do Anime==
In response to the immense popularity of Japanese [[anime]], Conan and Andy went to the studios of [[Bang Zoom! Entertainment]] to record voiceovers for some of their films. These voiceovers consisted primarily of improvising comical dialogue based on literal interpretations of the scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jay Leno |url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/conan-and-andy-do-anime-again-092209/1159851/?__cid=nbceditorial |title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno &amp;#124; Watch Episodes and Video Online for Free - NBC Official Site |publisher=Tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dumbledore Goes Hollywood==
Following the release of ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', Conan reports that one the film's main actors has let success go to his head. Footage of [[Albus Dumbledore]] (played by [[Brian Stack]]) harassing partygoers in Hollywood is then played.

Throughout the video, Dumbledore uses many Harry Potter-themed innuendoes, such as asking women if he can [[Slytherin]] to their [[Gryffindor]]. At the end of each sketch, Dumbledore is either beaten or pursued by the police and his mug shot is displayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jay Leno |url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/dumbledore-rides-again-122209/1188249/ |title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno &amp;#124; Watch Episodes and Video Online for Free - NBC Official Site |publisher=Tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091226032200/http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/dumbledore-rides-again-122209/1188249 |archivedate=2009-12-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shatner Recites Palin==
After former [[Alaska]] governor [[Sarah Palin]] used flowery language during her resignation speech (and later on her [[Twitter]] account), Conan called on [[William Shatner]] to recite some of her most poetic statements in a dramatic, exaggerated fashion reminiscent of [[William Shatner's musical career|his musical career]]. During these sketches, Shatner would be accompanied by [[Mike Merritt (musician)|Mike Merritt]] on bass and Ronnie Gutierrez or James Wormsworth on bongos.

During one installment, after Shatner had read from Palin's [[Going Rogue: An American Life|autobiography]], Palin appeared and read from Shatner's [[Up Till Now|autobiography]] (which includes a description of riding an elephant in his underwear).

In later occurrences, Shatner instead recited statements from [[Levi Johnston]]'s Twitter account, which were crude and pointless rather than poetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jay Leno |url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/shatner-gets-served-by-palin-121109/1184491/ |title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno &amp;#124; Watch Episodes and Video Online for Free - NBC Official Site |publisher=Tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091214015939/http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/shatner-gets-served-by-palin-121109/1184491/ |archivedate=2009-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conan's Fake Endorsements==
After mentioning that [[Oprah Winfrey]] is suing companies for using her name and image without permission, Conan claims to be a victim of similar unauthorized endorsements. He then shows a commercial made up of clips that were spliced together to give the impression he was endorsing a certain product (while making other inappropriate remarks). Conan would later admit that he would be okay with the endorsement if he was being paid for it.

In one installment, Max claimed to be a victim of unauthorized endorsements as well, only to later admit that his endorsement of a male enhancement cream was legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jay Leno |url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/conans-fake-endorsement-091109/1156430/?__cid=nbceditorial |title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno &amp;#124; Watch Episodes and Video Online for Free - NBC Official Site |publisher=Tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Puppies Dressed as Cats==
Conan gives his audience a Mini Dose of Joy by bringing out puppies that are wearing cat costumes. The sketch is accompanied by an annoyingly repetitive song. For Halloween, the sketch was changed to "Puppies Dressed as Frankensteins". For Thanksgiving, the sketch was changed to "Puppies Dressed as Thanksgiving Dinner".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jay Leno |url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/puppies-dressed-as-thanksgiving-dinner-112609/1180008/ |title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno &amp;#124; Watch Episodes and Video Online for Free - NBC Official Site |publisher=Tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091201025006/http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/puppies-dressed-as-thanksgiving-dinner-112609/1180008 |archivedate=2009-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinton Chart==
2009 proved to be a successful year for former President [[Bill Clinton]] and occasionally Conan would use a chart to illustrate fluctuations in his popularity. The chart consisted of a picture of Clinton and an arrow that was attached at his crotch. As positive statistics were presented, the arrow would thicken and elongate, simulating an erection. When negative statistics were presented, the arrow would shrink and shrivel up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jay Leno |url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/clintons-nobel-prize-chances-101409/1166976/?__cid=nbceditorial |title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno &amp;#124; Watch Episodes and Video Online for Free - NBC Official Site |publisher=Tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elmo PSAs==
In this sketch, a [[Public service announcement|PSA]] featuring [[Elmo]] would be shown, in which his voice had been dubbed over. While his human counterparts offered sincere advice to children regarding ways to prevent the spread of illnesses (such as [[Swine Flu]]), Elmo would announce that death was inevitable and instead urge children to make peace with their God or to stay home and smoke cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jay Leno |url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/elmo-psa-100709/1164673/?__cid=nbceditorial |title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno &amp;#124; Watch Episodes and Video Online for Free - NBC Official Site |publisher=Tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tonight Show PSAs==
In response to current events, the staff of the Tonight Show present a series of [[Public service announcement|PSAs]] they have recorded. Following a pair of humorous messages from Conan and Andy, a third message is shown, which usually stars either Max or LaBamba. This final message features information that is just barely related to the subject matter being discussed. For example, Max recorded a [[Swine Flu]] PSA in which he suggested that everyone wear [[surgical mask]]s, but only so women would have a harder time identifying him after he exposes himself to them on the subway. Similarly, LaBamba recorded an [[Environmentalism]] PSA in which he eats spaghetti from a dumpster and then simply shouts "Environment!" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jay Leno |url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/even-more-eco-psas-111909/1177732/?__cid=nbceditorial |title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno &amp;#124; Watch Episodes and Video Online for Free - NBC Official Site |publisher=Tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conan's Hunky Vampire Assistant==
Due to the popularity of vampire-themed films and shows such as ''[[Twilight (2008 film)|Twilight]]'', ''[[True Blood]]'', and ''[[The Vampire Diaries (TV series)|The Vampire Diaries]]'', Conan hired a vampire assistant named Cody Deveraux. Stereotypically brooding and overly dramatic, Cody's appearance is always accompanied by melancholy emo music. The sketches always end with Cody fleeing the studio in despair after receiving some mildly upsetting information. Once outside, sunlight causes Cody to ignite, leaving only a pile of charred clothes on the sidewalk. After one such appearance (and subsequent death), Tonight Show announcer [[Andy Richter]] questioned Cody's ability to repeatedly die, only to later reappear unharmed. Cody's true fate was then revealed, as he was shown backstage drinking coffee and smoking a cigarette.

In later occurrences of the sketch, Cody becomes distraught upon learning that Conan has hired additional assistants based on popular films. This included hiring a zombie due to the popularity of ''[[Zombieland]]'', hiring an invisible presence due to the popularity of ''[[Paranormal Activity]]'', hiring a wolf boy due to the popularity of ''[[The Twilight Saga: New Moon]]'', hiring a football player due to the popularity of ''[[The Blind Side (film)|The Blind Side]]'', and hiring a [Pandoran_biosphere#Naʼvi|[Na'vi]] after the success of ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''. Another assistant to appear alongside Cody was [[Frankenstein]]'s monster (played by [[Brian Stack]]) from ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''.

In one skit, [[Jerry Springer]] was called in to break up a fight between Cody and Wolf Boy. When Cody inevitably committed suicide, Jerry followed suit, revealing that he, too, had been a vampire all along.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jay Leno |url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/?mea=1178890&amp;__cid=thefilter |title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno &amp;#124; Watch Episodes and Video Online for Free - NBC Official Site |publisher=Tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Trends==
Conan takes the time to let his viewers know what is in and what is out for the coming season. The items that are out are usually a bizarre variation of a current trend, such as being touched by an [[iPod]] salesman rather than buying an [[iPod Touch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jay Leno |url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/new-trends-111309/1175748/?__cid=nbceditorial |title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno &amp;#124; Watch Episodes and Video Online for Free - NBC Official Site |publisher=Tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==High Definition Wizard of Oz==
Following the release of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' in [[High-definition video|High Definition]], Conan complained that the film had been ruined. He then presented examples of scenes that had been worsened by the incredible level of detail. These scenes included things that had supposedly gone unnoticed in previous versions of the film, such as the [[Cowardly Lion]]'s penis or a smoking munchkin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jay Leno |url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/high-def-wizard-of-oz-100209/1163180/?__cid=nbceditorial |title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno &amp;#124; Watch Episodes and Video Online for Free - NBC Official Site |publisher=Tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==LA Weather Update==
During a time when Los Angeles was experiencing light rain, Conan's commentary about the weather would be interrupted by updates from a weather reporter (played by [[Brian McCann (actor)|Brian McCann]]). The weather reporter was often surrounded by individuals who reacted to the rain in extreme fashion, such as emergency crews, a robotic mop, and roving bands of warriors. The sketches were meant to exaggerate Los Angeles residents' fear of the rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jay Leno |url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/the-great-drizzle-day-3-101409/1166950/ |title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno &amp;#124; Watch Episodes and Video Online for Free - NBC Official Site |publisher=Tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019072402/http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/the-great-drizzle-day-3-101409/1166950 |archivedate=2009-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Smoky Ads==
When the [[United States Forest Service]] released new ads featuring [[Smoky the Bear]], Conan noted their aggressive tone and disturbing content. He then presented the ads, in which Smoky's voice had been dubbed over. In each installment, Smoky would confront someone who was being careless with fire and threaten to do terrible things to them, like bury them alive or bite off their genitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jay Leno |url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/smoky-the-bear-returns-102909/1170984/?__cid=nbceditorial |title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno &amp;#124; Watch Episodes and Video Online for Free - NBC Official Site |publisher=Tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Andy's Motorized Podium==
Inspired by a man who garned media attention for motorizing his [[recliner]], Andy revealed that he'd motorized the podium from which he watches each episode. For the next few moments Andy would pilot his podium around the stage, often cutting in front of the camera and distracting Conan as he attempts to continue with the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jay Leno |url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/more-of-andys-motorized-podium-110909/1178234/?__cid=nbceditorial |title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno &amp;#124; Watch Episodes and Video Online for Free - NBC Official Site |publisher=Tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==America's New Oprah==
Following the announcement that [[Oprah Winfrey]]'s talk show would be concluding in 2011, Conan dubbed himself the new Oprah and commanded his audience to buy obscure products. His recommendations included the 1974 [[Television movie|made-for-TV]] movie ''[[Killdozer! (film)|Killdozer]]'', [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0810935929 a calendar of extraordinary chickens],  and [[Songs from the Crystal Cave|an album]] of music from [[action film]] star [[Steven Seagal]]. Conan would later refer to the [[Amazon.com]] pages for these items to prove that customers had indeed been purchasing them together.

On one occasion, Max was called upon to provide relationship advice in the style of [[Dr. Phil]]. Max happily reminded viewers to ask prostitutes if they are actually cops before requesting services.

Other past recommendations have included ''[[Cool as Ice]]'', several films from the ''[[Leprechaun (franchise)|Leprechaun]]'' franchise, ''[[Troll 2]]'', and a Christmas-themed [[VHS]] starring [[Kathie Lee Gifford]] (which was so terrible that Conan revoked his recommendation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jay Leno |url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/forget-oprah-try-conan-121009/1184202/ |title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno &amp;#124; Watch Episodes and Video Online for Free - NBC Official Site |publisher=Tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091214015915/http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/forget-oprah-try-conan-121009/1184202/ |archivedate=2009-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sucking up to Comcast==
After [[NBC]] had been purchased by [[Comcast]], Conan would announce that no jokes would be made at his new employers' expense, opting instead to list the various accomplishments that made them worthy of respect. Andy, sometimes wearing Comcast merchandise, would offer similar sentiments. At the end of the sketch, LaBamba would usually be called upon to provide his opinion of Comcast, but would instead announce something childish and unrelated, such as "I like pancakes!" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jay Leno |url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/comcastic-spectacular-120309/1181805/ |title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno &amp;#124; Watch Episodes and Video Online for Free - NBC Official Site |publisher=Tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207050102/http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/comcastic-spectacular-120309/1181805/ |archivedate=2009-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tiger Woods Joke Caddy==
Following the revelation that [[Tiger Woods]] had been cheating on his wife with several different women, Conan insisted that he needed professional help to determine which of the numerous possible jokes he should tell with regards to Woods' infidelities. A [[caddy]] would then enter, carrying with him a golf bag full of cue cards. After evaluating the audience for things such as temperature and wind speed, the caddy would select a joke for Conan to read. Prior to the reading of the joke, Andy would comment on the situation in the hushed voice of a golf announcer.

During one installment, Conan and his caddy were interrupted by [[Bob Saget]], who appeared with his own joke caddy and asked to play through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jay Leno |url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/another-joke-caddy-in-town-120909/1183759/?__cid=nbceditorial |title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno &amp;#124; Watch Episodes and Video Online for Free - NBC Official Site |publisher=Tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sketches introduced during the ''Tonight Show'' conflict==

===Classic ''Tonight Show'' Moment===
In the weeks leading to O'Brien's departure following a seven-month tenure, Conan began showing "classic" moments from their seven months at ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. The sketch was a joke, as a show usually runs for a number of years before it starts showing classic clips, rather than a few months, as was Conan's tenure as host. Such sketches included: when the [[List of The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien sketches#Wax Fonzie and Wax Tom Cruise|wax figures of Tom Cruise and Fonzie]] were shot from a cannon, or [[Tom Hanks]] was hit with a [[meteorite]]. Conan asks why one of the vignettes in the opening shows him suffering a [[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien#Other notable episodes|concussion]].

===Writer Deon Cole===
Saying that one of the staff members wants to share his thoughts about what is happening, Conan introduces writer Deon Cole, who described, in successive episodes, how Conan is a ho, a pimp, or black, asking Conan such questions as "Has [[Charlie Sheen]]/[[Paris Hilton]] ever been on your couch?" The routine ends with the word of the day (such as "BLACK MAN" or "PIMP") being stamped over Conan's face, similar to the "Ass" stamp.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/television/2004801,CST-FTR-cole22.article]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125164306/http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/television/2004801%2CCST-FTR-cole22.article |date=January 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===I Put ''The Tonight Show'' on Craigslist===
Saying, "I do not know if I'm even legally allowed to do this, but screw it," Conan says he put ''The Tonight Show'' up for sale on [[Craigslist]], and shows the "real" responses he received, and that these are real photos of what was offered, such as a 1970 [[AMC Gremlin]], or someone's brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jay Leno |url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/more-craigslist-offers-011810/1194379/ |title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno &amp;#124; Watch Episodes and Video Online for Free - NBC Official Site |publisher=Tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120221035/http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/more-craigslist-offers-011810/1194379/ |archivedate=2010-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; No element of ''The Tonight Show'' was actually sold.

===Crazy Expensive Comedy Bits===
During the final week of his Tonight Show tenure, Conan decided to unveil new characters that were designed to be more expensive than funny since NBC is required to pay for everything used in the show's segments. The first night, Conan introduced the '[[Bugatti Veyron]] Mouse', an actual model of the car dressed in mouse whiskers and ears accompanied by the master recording of [[The Rolling Stones]] '[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]' at a purported cost of $1.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/21/conan-blowing-nbcs-money_n_430883.html |title=Conan Blowing NBC's Money, Spends $1.5 Million For One Minute Segment (VIDEO) |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= 2010-01-21|accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, the car was donated for use by the [[Petersen Automotive Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matt Hardigree |url=http://jalopnik.com/5453816/update-petersen-museum-loaned-bugatti-veyron-to-conan |title=UPDATE: Petersen Museum Loaned Bugatti Veyron To Conan |publisher=Jalopnik.com |date=2010-01-21 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; however NBC was forced to remove all web clips of the sketch from its website and [[Hulu]] in order to avoid paying the royalty fees for 'Satisfaction'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jennifer Van Grove 259 |url=http://mashable.com/2010/01/21/bugatti-veyron-mouse/ |title=NBC Pulls Web Clips of Conan's Most Expensive Bit Ever [VIDEO&amp;#93; |publisher=Mashable.com |date=2010-01-21 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following night, Conan acquired [[2009 Kentucky Derby]] winner [[Mine That Bird]], dressed the horse in a mink Snuggie and
had it watch restricted [[National Football League|NFL]] [[Super Bowl]] coverage at a purported cost of $4.8 million. Repeated viewings by internet viewers revealed though that the horse was similar looking stand-in and that the football footage shown was actually from the [[United States Football League|USFL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Koster |first=Kyle |url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/sportsprose/2010/01/mine_that_bird_helps_conan_obr.html |title=Mine That Bird helps Conan O'Brien waste NBC's money - Sports Pros(e) |publisher=Blogs.suntimes.com |date=2010-01-22 |accessdate=2011-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723232746/http://blogs.suntimes.com/sportsprose/2010/01/mine_that_bird_helps_conan_obr.html |archivedate=2012-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final show featured a purchased fossil of a ground sloth from the [[Smithsonian]] spraying an original [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] with beluga caviar at a cost of $65 million. After this, Conan addressed the fact that internet users believed the purchases to be real, stating that they were all supposed to be obvious fakes.

'''Minyong Kim''' is an [[impersonator]] of [[Kim Jong-un]], the [[List of leaders of North Korea|supreme leader]] of [[North Korea]]. He is an undergraduate student at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]].&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news |last=Castillo |first=Walbert |date=October 7, 2015 |title=Kim Jong Un impersonator a big hit on U. of Illinois campus |url=http://college.usatoday.com/2015/10/07/kim-jong-un-impersonator-a-big-hit-on-u-of-illinois-campus/ |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |location= |access-date=October 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kim was born in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], and is currently studying [[business]] at the University of Illinois. He first enrolled at the university in 2009, then went back to South Korea for 25 months to complete mandatory military service in the [[Republic of Korea Air Force|Korean Air Force]], and is now back at the university as a full-time student.&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt;

Capitalizing on his resemblance to Kim Jong-un, Kim decided to impersonate the North Korean leader. He put on weight, bought a black suit, and got a trapezoidal haircut to make the act more convincing. He has become very popular on the campus of the University of Illinois, with hundreds of people stopping him on the street every day to take [[selfie]]s with him. His resemblance to Kim Jong-un has earned him roles in movies and commercials in South Korea. Kim says his reason for impersonating the North Korean leader on the University of Illinois campus is to make people happy.&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Coit |first=Heather |date=October 15, 2015 |title=Minyong Kim impersonates Kim Jong-un |url=http://www.news-gazette.com/multimedia/photogallery/2015-10-15/minyong-kim-impersonates-kim-jong-un |newspaper=[[The News-Gazette (Champaign-Urbana)|The News-Gazette]] |location=[[Champaign, Illinois]] |access-date=October 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wurth |first=Julie |date=October 15, 2015 |title=Kimpersonator |url=http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2015-10-15/kimpersonator.html |newspaper=[[The News-Gazette (Champaign-Urbana)|The News-Gazette]] |location=[[Champaign, Illinois]] |access-date=October 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
British comedians [[Richard Herring]] and [[Jo Caulfield]] wrote in an article that observational comedy "essentially involves saying 'Did you ever notice?' and then recounting something that will hopefully be universally familiar, but that won't necessarily have been consciously noted by your audience. If it's too obvious an observation it won't be funny (Have you ever noticed how buses always come in threes? Yes.) and if it's too oblique then it won't hit home."&lt;ref name="Herring Caulfield"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Herring|first1=Richard|last2=Caulfield|first2=Jo|authorlink1=Richard Herring|authorlink2=Jo Caulfield|title=The comedian's toolbox|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/22/comedy4|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=21 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eddie Izzard]] noted that a comedian's observations "need to be something that people can relate to, for the audience to pick up on it" in order to be considered a successful observational comedy act.&lt;ref name="Double"/&gt; [[Douglas Coupland]] writes, "Anybody can describe a pre-[[Wet wipe|moistened towelette]] to you, but it takes a good observational comedian to tell you what, exactly is the 'deal' with them." He adds that observational comedy first of all depends on a "lone noble comedian adrift in the modern world, observing the unobservable-those banalities and fragments of minutiae lurking just below the threshold of perception: Cineplex candy; remote control units."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grassian|first=Daniel|title=Hybrid Fictions: American Literature and Generation X|date=2003|publisher=McFarland|location=London|isbn=978-0786416325|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observational comedy has been compared to [[sociology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Galea|first=Patrick|title="So what’s the deal with that?" – Observational Comedy and Sociology|journal=[[Electronic Journal of Sociology]]|date=30 January 2012|url=http://www.sociology.org/so-whats-the-deal-with-that-observational-comedy-and-sociology/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Observational comedy became popular in the United States in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Double"/&gt; Although one author suggests that it "has never been particularly new. Even the more 'old-fashioned' jokes it supposedly replaced were often themselves disguised commentaries based on observing human nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Byrne|first=John|authorlink=John Byrne (columnist)|title=Writing Comedy|date=2012|publisher=Methuen Drama|location=London|isbn=978-1408146453|page=10|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Besides, older writers and live readers and speakers as [[Mark Twain]] himself, making jabs at everyday common place matters appealing to their Public's common sense about little noticed characters and their actions, early but very few entertainers followed in pokes at individuals and situation comedy instead of creating them and mimicking sketches. One of them, who became outstandingly successful in America and mixed it like Twain's personal gab of common man's as perspective, with his own personal trademark as embodyment of America's quintessential folky hero as a [[wikt:plainsman|plainsman]], by noticing and pointing to Public as his accomplice in the observations, using their old country folk common sense as deadpan or jolly neutral denominator for the comic revelation punch unfolding which departed from the hitherto satirical, was  [[Will Rogers]]. He used to make the witty disclaimer, "I don't make jokes. I just watch the government, and report their activities." [[Shelley Berman]] was one of the pioneers in the field.&lt;ref name="Double"/&gt; [[David Brenner]]'s "brand of observational comedy became a staple for other standups",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Elber|first=Lynn|title=Comedian David Brenner, 'Tonight' favorite, dies|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/comedian-david-brenner-tonight-favorite-dies|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=16 March 2014|quote=...whose brand of observational comedy became a staple for other standups, including Jerry Seinfeld and Paul Reiser...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Platt|first=Larry|title=David Brenner will perform at the Sellersville Theater|url=http://articles.philly.com/2011-06-15/entertainment/29660728_1_david-brenner-wash-larry-platt|publisher=[[Philadelphia Media Network]]|date=15 June 2011|quote=Brenner gave birth to a generation of "observational" comics - funny men who examined small moments closely and poked fun at life's minutiae.

The British observational comedy tradition began with the Irish comedian [[Dave Allen (comedian)|Dave Allen]]'s performances in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Double|first1=Oliver|title=Stand-Up! on being a comedian|date=1997|contribution=Dave Allen|publisher=Methuen Publishing|location=London|isbn=978-0413703200|page=140|quote=This was quite an innovation, because up to this point there had been no tradition of observational comedy in British stand-up.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the term==
[[Richard Zoglin]] considers the term "observational comedy" misleading because it is not "about politics or social issues or the comedian's own autobiography, but simply about everyday life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zoglin|first1=Richard|authorlink1=Richard Zoglin|title=Comedy at the Edge: How Stand-up in the 1970s Changed America|date=2009|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|location=New York|isbn=978-1582346250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Orquesta típica''', or simply a '''típica''', is a Latin-American term for a band which plays popular music. The details vary from country to country. The term tends to be used for groups of medium size (about 8 to 12 musicians) in some well-defined instrumental set-up.

==Argentina==
In Argentina, the term orquesta típica is associated with [[tango music]]. The orquesta típica usually comprises a string section (of violins, [[viola]], and [[cello]]), a [[bandoneón]] section (of 3 or more bandoneons), and a rhythm section (of [[piano]] and [[double bass]]). An orquesta típica is an expanded version of a sexteto tipico, which includes 2 bandoneons, 2 violins, double bass and piano.

==Cuba==
In Cuba a típica is an ensemble mainly composed of [[wind instruments]]. They have existed at least from the middle of the 19th century to the present day. One of the earliest, [[Early Cuban bands#Orchesta Flor de Cuba|Orquesta Flor de Cuba]], had the following make-up: [[cornet]], [[trombone]], figle ([[ophicleide]]), two [[clarinet]]s, two [[violin]]s, [[double bass]], [[kettle drum]], and [[güiro]]. The [[ophicleide]] was a sort of bass bugle with keys, invented in 1817, now superseded by the tuba and/or baritone horn, the name surviving for a pipe organ stop; the trombone would be more typically a valved rather than a slide instrument. See ''[[Early Cuban bands]]'' for more examples.

Típicas were later superseded by [[Charanga (Cuba)|charanga]]s, which along with son [[Conjunto#Cuban conjunto|conjuntos]], were one of the main precursors of the salsa ensemble. A typical salsa conjunto might include two trumpets, trombone, double bass, piano, conga, bongó or timbales (and/or timbalitos) and a güiro (scraper).&lt;ref&gt;Orovio, Helio 1981.

:''For the later Downtown Club, see [[Palladium (New York City)]]''

[[File:The Palladium Ballroom.gif|thumb|right|300px|Palladium Ballroom]]

The '''Palladium Ballroom''' was a second-floor dance hall above a drug store at the corner of [[53rd Street (Manhattan)|53rd Street]] and [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in New York City. It became famous for its [[Latin music (genre)|Latin music]] from 1948 until its closing on May 1, 1966.

==Opening==
When the Palladium opened as a dance studio and dance hall, it had a racially restrictive policy and did not maintain the level of funding needed to operate. It had a dance floor that could hold a thousand couples but had fallen into decline by 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Rondón, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the Latin bands were scheduled for the matinee session. Many were used as relief bands for the big society bands. Latin bands played at nightclubs such as The Conga, The China Doll, The Park Palace, and The Park Plaza in [[Spanish Harlem]]. 

The Palladium needed capital to survive, so it opened its doors to whites, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans, and people of different races and origin; everyone was accepted. Private investors joined and attorneys from big law firms participated in this joint venture for their friends, including Lou Walters and Federico Pagani.

==Palladium starts featuring Latin music==
In 1948, dance promoter Federico Pagani approached his longtime friend Lou Walters, owner of the Latin Quarter, and stated that he wanted to open a nightclub across the street from the Latin Quarter and bring Latin music from Havana. They asked Max Hyman and his wife Ann, an heiress to the [[Otis Elevator Company]] fortune, about booking Latin music and representing Federico Pagani to manage the Palladium. Pagani was the first to start the Latin matinee in a downtown dance hall on a Sunday and Wednesday. The first booking, on that Sunday afternoon, was a huge success, quickly prompting the club to fill its schedule with Latin music. Among the top acts to appear at the ballroom were the band of [[Arsenio Rodríguez]], whose band members included Arsenio's bassist Alfonso "El Panameño" Joseph, one of the most popular bands to perform at the Palladium; [[Machito]] (born Frank Grillo) and His Afro-Cubans, an established New York act, with music arranger and sax player [[Mario Bauzá]], Machito's brother-in-law, and [[Graciela]], Machito's sister, on vocals; and [[Tito Puente]]. He was responsible for bringing many stars from Havana, such as [[Orquesta Aragón]], [[Desi Arnaz]], [[César Concepción]], [[Celia Cruz]], [[Xavier Cugat]], [[José Curbelo]], [[José Fajardo (musician)|José Fajardo]], [[Marcelino Guerra]], [[La Lupe]], [[Sonora Matancera]], Joseíto Mateo, [[Noro Morales]], [[Benny Moré]], [[Tommy Olivencia]], [[Pérez Prado]], [[Ismael Rivera]], [[Daniel Santos (singer)|Daniel Santos]], [[Miguelito Valdés]], and Vicentico Valdés.

* Riverside Plaza, 95th Street at Riverside Drive

==Big Three==
In 1948, the Palladium Ballroom gained in stature because of the Big Three acts: Tito Puente, Tito Rodríguez, and Machito. The Big Three grew in popularity on the strength of their bookings at the Palladium. These bands were turning out [[Mambo (dance)|mambo]] hit after mambo hit such as  "Asia Minor" and "Babarabatiri", "Picadillo" and "Ran Kan Kan", nad "Mambo Mona". The popularity of Dámaso Pérez Prado's ''[[Mambo No. 5]]'' (1952) was taking everyone by storm.

==Popular dancers and dances==
The Palladium was known not only for its music but for the its dancers, fueled by weekly dance competitions and pie contests along with a Female Best Leg Contest. Ability to dance, not class or color, was the [[social currency]] inside the club. The Palladium's top star-performers, Augie and Margo Rodríguez, took the mambo to unimaginable heights. Another popular act featured was the group The Mambo and Cha-Cha-Aces with Andy, Mike and Tina. Mike Ramos and Freddie Rios did their side by side act. Marilyn Winters danced the entire floor in her one-woman show, as did Carmen Cruz. The Palladium became a showcase for the [[chachachá]], [[Merengue (dance)|merengue]], and the [[pachanga]]. These became as popular with the masses as the Mambo. 

The year 1948 started the mambo craze that spread across the United States. It began at the Palladium Ballroom. At the height of its popularity, the Palladium attracted Hollywood and Broadway stars, especially on Wednesday nights, which included a free dance lesson. Dance instructors such as "Killer Joe" Piro — who briefly served as master of ceremonies at the Palladium when Federico Pagani was not available — Augie and Margo were featured dancers there. Cuban Pete and Millie Donay appeared all over the world. Tito Puente wrote a song for Cuban Pete. Carmen Marie Padilla would offer mass dance lessons for the huge crowds.

==Jazz musicians, celebrities and Latin bands==
The Palladium was next jazz clubs on West [[52nd Street (Manhattan)|52nd Street]] such as [[Birdland (jazz club)|Birdland]], CuBop City, and the [[Onyx Club]]. Jazz musicians and some celebrities would sit in and play with the Latin bands. Others watched and enjoyed the show. Examples of notables who went to the ballroom include [[Count Basie]], [[Marlon Brando]], [[Dave Brubeck]], [[Paul Desmond]], [[Joe Morello]], [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Gene Krupa]], [[Jerry Lewis]], [[Peter Lawford]], [[Dean Martin]],  [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Buddy Rich]], [[George Shearing]], [[Cal Tjader]], and [[Pedro Vargas]]. Saxophonist [[Wayne Shorter]], who lived in the New York City area during the heyday of the Palladium Ballroom, composed a piece during the 1970s called "Palladium" while a member of the seminal jazz-fusion group [[Weather Report]]. The song appears on their ''[[Heavy Weather (album)|Heavy Weather]]'' album and features a driving Latin rhythm.

==Mambo losing popularity==
By the early 1960s, tastes had shifted and it was clear a new sound was on the horizon. The Palladium closed its doors in the spring of 1966. Dancers' and music fans' enthusiasm for the music was not diminished. [[The Village Gate]] in [[Greenwich Village]] opened its doors to Latin Night on Mondays and Wednesdays. Federico Pagani started Latin Nights with radio host [[Symphony Sid]] Torin and Joe Gaines. Pagani started doing the same at Tony Roma's El Corso on 86th Street and Third Avenue, Barney Googles, and the [[Cheetah]] nightclub. These venues became the places "the scene" went to next. Pagani also was responsible for his input on the movie filming ''Nuestra Cosa'' (''Our Latin Thing'' ) at the Cheetah and The Red Garder with Symphony Sid.

==Palladium in ''The Mambo Kings'' movie==
The dance floor and bandstand of the club were recreated in ''[[The Mambo Kings]]'' (1992), a  film starring [[Armand Assante]] and [[Antonio Banderas]] about the era of the mambo at the Palladium Ballroom and about Federico Pagani. [[Roscoe Lee Brown]] played the part of promoter Fernando Pérez, who would listen to what one had to offer in music, could make or break candidates, and was very serious and honest in telling them whether or not they had a chance to make it. Tito Puente played himself, and [[Desi Arnaz Jr.]] played Desi Arnaz Sr. The Mambo Kings Band featured [[Ralph Irizarry]], Machito's son Mario Grillo, and others.

'''''Pinball FX 3''''' is a [[pinball]] simulator [[video game]] developed and published by [[Zen Studios]] and was released on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Xbox One]], [[PlayStation 4]] in September 2017 and then later released on the [[Nintendo Switch]] in December 2017. It is a continuation of [[Zen Studios]]' pinball series, which includes ''[[Pinball FX 2]]'' and ''[[Zen Pinball 2]]''.

==Gameplay==
''Pinball FX 3'' allows players to play one of several simulated [[pinball]] tables, and includes online scoreboard support for informal competition with other players.. The game is aimed to provide a more engaging multiplayer experience than previous titles; the game will provide support for asynchronous competitive multiplayer options, and tournament-style play.&lt;ref name="eurog announce"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-06-28-zen-pinball-says-goodbye-to-last-gen-with-pinball-fx3 | title = Zen Studios says goodbye to last-gen with Pinball FX3 | first=  Jeffrey | last = Matulef | date = June 28, 2017 | accessdate = June 29, 2017 | work = [[Eurogamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There will be shared leaderboards and multiplayer options between PlayStation 4 and users playing through [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on Windows, and similarly shared options for Xbox One and Nintendo Switch players with both Steam and Windows 10 users.&lt;ref name="kotaku aug2017"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/pinball-fx-3-is-all-about-cross-platform-competition-1797931064 | title = Pinball FX 3 Is All About Cross-Platform Competition | first = Mike | last = Fahey | date = August 17, 2017 | accessdate = August 17, 2017 | work = [[Kotaku]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Zen's prior games have been split across consoles. The ''Pinball FX'' games typically have been for the [[Xbox 360]] and [[Windows]] platform, while the ''Zen Pinball'' was for the [[PlayStation 3]]. ''Pinball FX 3'' will be a single title for all three platforms and for future games in the series. Zen has stated that a "majority" of the previous [[downloadable content]] pinball tables that a player has purchased for either ''Pinball FX 2'' or ''Zen Pinball 2'' will be available in ''Pinball FX 3'' at no cost; Zen cited issues with licensing that prevents some tables from being brought to the new version.&lt;ref name="eurog announce"/&gt; Zen Studios has affirmed that more than fifty tables will carry over, with only about half a dozen that will not.&lt;ref name="kotaku aug2017"/&gt;

''Pinball FX 3'' launched with three new tables based on movie properties from [[Universal Pictures]] that includes ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', ''[[Back to the Future]]'', and ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''. Additional tables are in development with new [[intellectual property]] holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pinball-fx3-aims-to-redefine-the-video-game-pinbal/1100-6451286/ | title = Pinball FX3 Aims To "Redefine" The Video Game Pinball Experience | first = Eddie | last = Makuch | date = June 28, 2017 | accessdate = June 29, 2017 | work = [[GameSpot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kotaku aug2017"/&gt;

A version for the [[Nintendo Switch]] was released in December 2017, with one free table and 29 additional tables that can be purchased as DLC. The Switch version takes advantage of the unit's portability; the game can be played in [[Page orientation|portrait mode]] and the player can tilt the device to simulate tilting of the pinball table.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.destructoid.com/pinball-fx3-is-tilting-on-to-switch-soon-470351.phtml | title = Pinball FX3 is tilting on to Switch soon | first = Peter | last= Glagowski | date = November 1, 2017 | accessdate = November 1, 2017 | work = [[Destructoid]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, following release, players reported issues with low frame rates and poor graphics on some of the tables; while Zen Studios has said they were working on a patch to fix these as well as make other display improvements, the studio later announced in March 2018 that they had to forgo the patch citing that there was no universal fix as the issue was one done table-by-table; they can optimize tables going forward but could not justify the time and cost to fix the existing ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-03-07-zen-studios-ditches-plans-to-patch-pinball-fx3-nintendo-switch-performance | title = Zen Studios ditches plans to patch Pinball FX3 Nintendo Switch performance | date = March 7, 2018 | accessdate = March 7, 2018 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reacting on the negative backlash of this announcement, the studio later reverted on this stance and is now committed to releasing a performance update during summer 2018 that will increase handheld performance to 60fps and will raise docked resolution to 1080p Full HD for all existing tables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pinballfx.com/?page_id=7632|title=Pinball FX3 – Nintendo Switch Update|work=Zen Studios|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, Zen Studios announced that it has received the license to recreate several real [[Bally Manufacturing|Bally]] and [[WMS Industries|Williams]] tables for the game.&lt;ref name="Polygon Bally/Williams"&gt;{{cite web|last=McWhertor|first=Michael|title=Classic Bally/Williams pinball tables coming to Pinball FX3|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/9/4/17818186/pinball-fx3-arcade-bally-williams-rights|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|accessdate=2018-09-04|date=2018-09-04|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marks the first time in the ''Pinball FX'' series that real world tables are recreated in the game. This announcement came a few months after [[FarSight Studios]], the developers of ''[[The Pinball Arcade]]'', lost the same license.&lt;ref name="Polygon Bally/Williams"/&gt; These tables can be played in two visual modes that otherwise do not impact the game: one based on the more realistic appearance of the actual pinball games, and another that added ''Pinbal FX 3''{{'}}s simulated elements like animated characters, and unique ball trail colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.destructoid.com/pinball-fx-3-s-williams-tables-will-feature-classic-and-all-new-remastered-modes-523460.phtml | title = Pinball FX 3's Williams tables will feature Classic and all-new Remastered modes | first=  Chris  |last = Moyse | date = September 20, 2018 | accessdate = September 20, 2018 | work = [[Destructoid]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as to retain the game's overall [[ESRB]] "E10+" rating and to avoid the cost and difficulties of re-rating the game, original graphical elements of the pinball tables had to be censored or altered, such as altering innuendo that was present on the ''[[Fish Tales (pinball)|Fish Tales]]'' backboards.&lt;ref name="williams censored"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.destructoid.com/pinball-fx-3-s-williams-tables-are-available-now-feature-censored-elements-526515.phtml | title = Pinball FX 3's Williams tables are available now, feature censored elements | first = Chris | last = Moyse | date = October 10, 2018 | accessdate = October 10, 2018 | work = [[Destructoid]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arstech williams"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/10/pinball-fx3-self-censors-classic-pinball-art-for-lower-esrb-rating/ | title = Zen Studios alters classic pinball art to protect family-friendly rating | first = Kyle | last = Orland | date = October 12, 2018 | accessdate = October 12, 2018 | work = [[Ars Technica]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zen Studios' Mel Kirk said that while these tables had been released in ''The Pinball Arcade'' under its E10+ ESRB rating, Zen Studios' internal review believed that there was no way that the tables could have fallen within E10+. Kirk stated that he believed that with  ''The Pinball Arcade'', "somehow they flew under the radar and it was not caught".&lt;ref name="arstech williams"/&gt; Further, Zen Studios had had past issues with ESRB content ratings with games such as ''Infinite Minigolf'' and wanted to exercise caution.&lt;ref name="arstech williams"/&gt; The first of these tables were released on October 9, 2018.&lt;ref name="williams censored"/&gt;

[[Image:ATM Machine RAS Syndrome sign.jpg|thumb|"ATM machine" is a common example of RAS syndrome]]
'''RAS syndrome''' (where "RAS" stands for "'''redundant acronym syndrome'''", making the phrase "RAS syndrome" [[self-reference|self-referential]]) is the use of one or more of the words that make up an [[acronym]] or other [[initialism]] in conjunction with the abbreviated form, thus in effect repeating one or more words. Two common examples are "[[Personal identification number|PIN]] or [[Vehicle identification number|VIN]] number" (the "N" in PIN and VIN stands for "number") and "[[Automated teller machine|ATM]] machine" (the "M" in ATM stands for "machine"). The term ''RAS syndrome'' was coined in 2001 by ''[[New Scientist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Clothier |first=Gary |date=8 November 2006 |title=Ask Mr. Know-It-All |newspaper=The York Dispatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Newman&gt;{{Cite news |last=Newman |first=Stanley |date=December 20, 2008 |url=http://www2.canada.com/windsorstar/news/readersatplay/story.html?id=ea936740-3787-49be-813d-937b3a63eb74 |title=Sushi by any other name |newspaper=Windsor Star |page=G4 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503121728/http://www2.canada.com/windsorstar/news/readersatplay/story.html?id=ea936740-3787-49be-813d-937b3a63eb74 |archivedate=May 3, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Feedback |newspaper=[[New Scientist]]|issue=2285 |date=2001-04-07 |page=108 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17022858.000 |format=fee required |accessdate=2006-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Usage of these '''redundant acronyms'''&lt;ref name=Garner&gt;[[Bryan A. Garner|Garner, Bryan A]]. (2000) ''The Oxford Dictionary of American Usage and Style.'' Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; are advised against by many style guides, but they continue to have widespread usage in colloquial speech.

== Reasons for use ==
Although there are many instances in editing where removal of redundancy improves clarity,&lt;ref name="Bryson2002"&gt;{{Citation |last=Bryson |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill Bryson |title=Bryson's Dictionary of Troublesome Words |year=2002 |isbn=0-7679-1043-5 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the pure-logic ideal of ''zero'' redundancy is seldom maintained in human languages. [[Bill Bryson]] says,&lt;ref name="Bryson2002"/&gt; "Not all repetition is bad. It can be used for effect&amp;nbsp;..., or for clarity, or in deference to [[wikt:idiom|idiom]]. '[[OPEC]] countries', '[[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|SALT]] talks' and '[[HIV]] virus' are all technically redundant because the second word is already contained in the preceding abbreviation, but only the ultra-finicky would deplore them. Similarly, in 'Wipe that smile off your face' the last two words are tautological—there is no other place a smile could be—but the sentence would not stand without them."&lt;ref name="Bryson2002"/&gt;

A limited amount of redundancy can improve the effectiveness of communication, either for the whole readership or at least to offer help to those readers who need it. A phonetic example of that principle is the need for [[spelling alphabet]]s in radiotelephony. Some instances of RAS syndrome can be viewed as syntactic examples of the principle. The redundancy may help the listener by providing context and decreasing the "[[alphabet soup (linguistics)|alphabet soup]] quotient" (the [[wikt:cryptic|cryptic]] overabundance of abbreviations and acronyms) of the communication.

Acronyms and initialisms from foreign languages are often treated as unanalyzed [[morphemes]] when they are not translated.  For example, in French, "le protocole IP" (the Internet protocol protocol) is often used, and in English "please [[RSVP (invitations)|RSVP]]" (roughly "please respond please") is very common.&lt;ref name=Garner/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linguistlist.org/issues/4/4-532.html#1 |title=LINGUIST List 4.532: Last Posting: Acronyms |publisher=Linguistlist.org |date= |accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs for the same [[linguistics|linguistic]] reasons that cause [[List of tautological place names|many toponyms to be tautological]]. The [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]] is not parsed by the mind in most instances of real-world use (in many cases because the foreign word's meaning is not known anyway; in others simply because the usage is idiomatic).

'''''The Last of Us: Left Behind''''' is an [[action-adventure game]] developed by [[Naughty Dog]] and published by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]]. It was released worldwide for the [[PlayStation 3]] on February 14, 2014, as a [[Downloadable content|downloadable]] [[expansion pack]] to ''[[The Last of Us]]''; it was later bundled with ''[[The Last of Us Remastered]]'', an updated version of the game released for the [[PlayStation 4]] on July 29, 2014,{{efn|name=Remastered}} and was released as a [[Stand-alone expansion pack|standalone expansion pack]] for both consoles on May 12, 2015. Set in a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] world, players control [[Ellie (The Last of Us)|Ellie]], a teenage girl who spends time with her best friend Riley after her unexpected return.

''The Last of Us: Left Behind'' is played from a [[Third-person view|third-person]] perspective; players use firearms, [[improvised weapons]] and [[Stealth game|stealth]] to defend against hostile humans and [[Zombie (fiction)|zombie]]-like creatures infected by a mutated strain of the ''[[Cordyceps]]'' fungus. Players can use "Listen Mode" to locate enemies through a heightened sense of hearing and spatial awareness. The game also features a [[Crafting (gaming)|crafting]] system, allowing players to customize weapons through the upgrades.

''The Last of Us: Left Behind'' was highly anticipated due to the critical success of ''The Last of Us''. It was acclaimed by many reviewers, with particular praise for its story, [[Character arc|characterization]], and depiction of female and [[LGBT themes in video games|LGBT]] characters. It [[List of accolades received by The Last of Us|won several year-end accolades]] from multiple [[Video game journalism|gaming publications]].

==Gameplay==
{{see also|The Last of Us#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of The Last of Us}}

''The Last of Us: Left Behind'' is similar to the basic gameplay of ''[[The Last of Us]]''. It is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[survival horror]] game that uses a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]]. The game involves gunfights, [[melee]] combat and a [[cover system]].&lt;ref name="announcement"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2011/12/10/naughty-dog-reveals-the-last-of-us-at-2011-vgas/ |title=Naughty Dog Reveals The Last of Us at 2011 VGAs |last=Wells |first=Evan |work=[[PlayStation Blog]] |publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]] |date=December 10, 2011 |accessdate=October 6, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6T7B9EzaT?url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2011/12/10/naughty-dog-reveals-the-last-of-us-at-2011-vgas/ |archivedate=October 6, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Players control [[Ellie (The Last of Us)|Ellie]]. An added feature in combat is the ability to focus the attention of the Infected towards human enemies, by throwing objects to distract them. This results in a lower number of enemies to encounter, giving players a [[Positional advantage|tactical advantage]].&lt;ref name="IGN Review"/&gt; Throughout the game, players encounter locations and activities around the mall, such as a carousel, photo booth, video arcade, mask store and water guns. All of these locations and activities have some level of interactivity, allowing players to use them in different ways; for example, the photo booth allows players to select different mannerisms in which to pose for a picture, while using the water guns prompts players to soak Riley.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

==Plot==
In the aftermath of a fight that leaves Joel ([[Troy Baker]]) severely injured, [[Ellie (The Last of Us)|Ellie]] ([[Ashley Johnson]]) searches an abandoned mall for supplies to heal him. She discovers a medical kit in a derelict military helicopter. Making her way back to Joel, Ellie is impeded by the Infected and members of a hostile human group. She fights her way back to the unconscious Joel, treats his open wound, and takes him to find a hideout for the coming winter.

Months earlier, before Ellie meets Joel, Ellie's friend Riley ([[Yaani King]]) surprises Ellie at their boarding school after weeks away. She reveals that she has joined the Fireflies, a revolutionary militia group, and takes Ellie to explore an abandoned shopping mall. Riley reveals that she has been assigned to a group of Fireflies in a different city, and broke the rules to see Ellie again. The girls argue, but Ellie eventually tells her that she supports her decision as it is something that Riley has wanted for a long time. Before parting, Riley plugs Ellie's [[walkman]] into the sound system and dances with her. Ellie tearfully begs Riley not to leave. Riley rips her [[dog tag]]s off and Ellie kisses her. Drawn by the noise, the Infected pursue Ellie and Riley; they run, but are bitten. They consider suicide, but choose to spend their final hours together.

==Development==
[[File:Neil Druckmann SDCC 2014.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Neil Druckmann]] worked as the creative director on ''The Last of Us: Left Behind'', writing the game's story.|alt=A 35-year-old man with curly black hair talking into a microphone, looking at something to the left of the camera.]]

[[Naughty Dog]] began developing ''The Last of Us: Left Behind'' following the release of ''The Last of Us'' in June 2013, with a team about half the size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbTHjKrnzek&amp;t=52m40s |title=The Last of Us design panel |last1=Zeldin |first1=Ashley |last2=Druckmann |first2=Neil |authorlink2=Neil Druckmann |last3=Cambier |first3=Ricky |last4=Newman |first4=Anthony |conference=[[International Game Developers Association]] |location=[[Santa Monica]] |date=April 3, 2014 |accessdate=May 9, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6YOEi0BBB?url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbTHjKrnzek&amp;t=52m40s |archivedate=May 9, 2015 |deadurl=no |quote=I would say it's less than half the team that worked on the main game. We started on it as we were wrapping up ''The Last of Us''. |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the decision to create single-player [[downloadable content]] for the game, the development team immediately decided that the story would focus on the character of Ellie; they found that players of ''The Last of Us'' were interested to learn about events in Ellie's life prior to the events of the main game, particularly the events involving [[List of The Last of Us characters#Riley|Riley Abel]], whom Ellie mentioned in ''The Last of Us''. In addition, they found that some players were interested in the events that occurred between the Fall and Winter segments of the main game, in which Ellie cares for an injured Joel. This led to the team deciding to contrast these two events against each other, feeling it would help the story's pacing. Game director [[Bruce Straley]] said that the team felt the story justified the development of ''Left Behind''.&lt;ref name="From Dreams"/&gt;

[[File:AshleyJohnson cropped.jpg|150px|thumb|left|[[Ashley Johnson]] portrayed Ellie in ''Left Behind'', reprising the role from ''The Last of Us''.|alt=A 30-year-old woman with long, blonde hair, smiling at someone to the right of the camera.]]
''Left Behind'' was written to focus on the relationship between Ellie and Riley, and to recount the events that defined their later personalities.&lt;ref name="GSpot interview"/&gt; Riley was chronologically introduced to Ellie in ''[[The Last of Us: American Dreams]]'', a comic book written by creative director [[Neil Druckmann]] and artist [[Faith Erin Hicks]]. The team used the comic as a reference point when developing the relationship between Ellie and Riley, becoming particularly interested in having the chance to see more of their relationship;&lt;ref name="From Dreams"/&gt; Druckmann felt that they would not have developed ''Left Behind'' if ''American Dreams'' hadn't been written.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt; Druckmann felt that the story of Joel and Ellie's relationship in ''The Last of Us'' dealt with survival, loyalty and love, and that Ellie and Riley's relationship in ''Left Behind'' deals with similar themes. Straley felt that the themes involve love, loss and devotion, pondering the extent that one goes to protect those one cares about. [[Ashley Johnson]] portrayed Ellie in ''Left Behind'', reprising her role from ''The Last of Us''. To portray Riley, the team cast [[Yaani King]]; Johnson has noted that it was interesting to act against someone different, and that King fit the role immediately. King felt intimidated to become part of a large project, and was worried about "fit[ting] in".&lt;ref name="From Dreams"/&gt; The team found it interesting to tell the story of Riley, as players of ''The Last of Us'' were already aware of the effect that she had on Ellie; ''Left Behind'' sees Riley's behavior change Ellie, resulting in the latter's focus to fight in order to save those close to her. The team were also interested in Ellie's behavior around Riley; she is perceived as being more playful.&lt;ref name="From Dreams"/&gt; In ''Left Behind'', Ellie and Riley share a kiss; the team explored omitting the kiss from the game, but felt that it was imperative to the story, and that it strengthened the relationship.&lt;ref name="GSpot interview"/&gt; Though initially he only felt that Ellie viewed Riley as an influence, Druckmann later considered her romantic appeal, and decided to explore the concept.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2014/02/last-of-us-dlc-interview-long/ |title=Inside the Mind Behind the Brilliant New Last of Us DLC |last=Hudson |first=Laura |work=[[Wired (website)|Wired]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=February 18, 2014 |accessdate=March 3, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6WkaQbeBN?url=http://www.wired.com/2014/02/last-of-us-dlc-interview-long/ |archivedate=March 3, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While writing ''The Last of Us'', Druckmann had a general idea of the events that would shape Ellie's identity; when conceiving the story direction for ''Left Behind'', he found that these events were suitable.&lt;ref name="GSpot interview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/videos/the-last-of-us-developers-talk-left-behind-dlc-spo/2300-6417282/ |title=The Last of Us Developers Talk Left Behind DLC [SPOILERS] |last=Mc Shea |first=Tom |publisher=[[GameSpot]]. [[CBS Interactive]] |date=February 18, 2014 |accessdate=March 3, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6a5Dv0OCB?url=http://www.gamespot.com/videos/the-last-of-us-developers-talk-left-behind-dlc-spo/2300-6417282/ |archivedate=July 17, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Druckmann felt that omitting the nature of the argument between Ellie and Riley, which took place prior to the events of the game, allowed players to draw their own conclusions. The team found various sections of the game interesting, such as the references to [[Facebook]] and [[Halloween]], as the characters are unaware of their meaning.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

The smaller time frame of development for ''Left Behind'' gave the team an opportunity to trial mechanics and ideas that they were unable to test on the main game. With the game's combat, an added feature was to allow players to focus the attention of the Infected towards human enemies, allowing an easier escape. The gameplay was also more focused on the characters, as opposed to the combat, to allow players to relate to them more.&lt;ref name="From Dreams"&gt;{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WEeNH_C2I |title=From Dreams - The Making The Last of Us: Left Behind |people=[[Naughty Dog]] |publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]] |year=2014 |accessdate=March 2, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6WiDzMkly?url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WEeNH_C2I |archivedate=March 1, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The gameplay sequences were designed to contrast with other moments of Ellie's life; for example, the water gun fight with Riley is contrasted to the gunfights with enemies.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt; The team found that creating some gameplay mechanics was a challenge, with even fewer combat scenarios in ''Left Behind'' than in ''The Last of Us''.&lt;ref name="GSpot interview"/&gt; The animation of the masks also presented a challenge, due to the number of [[joint]]s; it took various iterations before the final design was implemented.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

''The Last of Us: Left Behind'' was released worldwide for the [[PlayStation 3]] on February 14, 2014 as a downloadable [[expansion pack]] to ''The Last of Us''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/news/a550101/games-out-this-week-lightning-returns-the-last-of-us-left-behind-dlc/ |title=Games out this week: Lightning Returns, The Last of Us Left Behind DLC |last=Reynolds |first=Matthew |publisher=[[Digital Spy]].

''The Last of Us: Left Behind'' was released to critical acclaim. [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Normalization (statistics)|normalized]] rating in the 0–100 range, calculated an average score of 88 out of 100, indicating "generally favorable reviews", based on 69 reviews.&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt; Reviewers praised the character development, story and subtext, gameplay and combat, and depiction of female and [[LGBT themes in video games|LGBT]] characters.

'''''The Modern Amazons: Warrior Women On-Screen''''' ({{ISBN|0-87910-327-2}}) by &lt;ref&gt;[[Alicia Eler]] "Women As Warriors" (''Windy City Times'', July 3rd, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;[[Dominique Mainon]] and [[James Ursini]], published by Hal Leonard/Limelight Editions is a non-fiction book documenting the evolution of the female action hero in cinema, television and pop-culture. From ''[[Barbarella (comics)|Barbarella]]'' to ''[[Barb Wire]]'', the book surveys the public's interest with the warrior-woman and amazon archetype in media. From the same authors who wrote ''[[Cinema of Obsession: Erotic Fixation and Love Gone Wrong in the Movies (book)]]'', this book also contains hundreds of illustrations, and a complete bibliography, an extensive 30 page filmography, as well as sidebars about trends, style, and trivia.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Cowper - "Reviewer's Bookwatch" (April 2006, Volume 6, Number 4)&lt;/ref&gt; The warrior-woman image throughout the past five decades is explored, from the iconic Raquel Welch in the prehistoric adventure fantasy One Million Years BC in the "fur bikinis and jungle love" chapter, to the [[blaxploitation]] films (''[[Coffy]], [[Foxy Brown (film)|Foxy Brown]]'', and ''[[Sheba, Baby]]'') made famous by [[Pam Grier]], the first African-American woman to play a warrior woman within the action movie genre . Included also is Lucy Lawless' six-season portrayal of ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]''; Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft in two ''[[Tomb Raider]]'' movies; Sigourney Weaver as Ripley in the sci-fi ''[[Alien (Alien franchise)|Alien]]'' adventures, and all the various women who have played vampire slayers, superheroes (and villains), as well as assorted television, cartoon, comics, and video game fighter characters in the various movie action/adventure genres. In addition, the book highlights Hong Kong martials arts warriors such as [[Angela Mao]] (''[[Enter the Dragon]]'') and [[Zhang Ziyi]] (''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'') and &lt;ref&gt;J.R. Taylor - Packed, Stacked and on the Attack (Mr. Skin, July 1st, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;[[Cynthia Rothrock]], and also sexploitation films, including the controversial Ilsa trilogy.

==Theme==
''The Modern Amazons: Warrior Women On-Screen'' has been viewed as a sociologically sound study of strong women of this growing female action hero genre in film and TV. It is quoted as having &lt;ref&gt;Gary Dowell - "B Movie Magic: Celebrating the Silver Screen's Tough Broads and One Mutated Superhero" (Baltimore City Paper, June 7, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;"an authoritative style that’s thankfully free of pretension and stuffiness." It is written from a female perspective (Mainon's) but balanced with scholarly data from verified popcult expert, [[James Ursini]].&lt;ref&gt;Staff - "The Modern Amazons: Warrior Women On-Screen" (Books to Watch Out For: The Lesbian Edition)&lt;/ref&gt; The book includes analysis of both feminist and lesbian text and subtext in action movies, TV series, and cartoons, such as ''[[Powerpuff Girls]]''. as well as - ''[[Tank Girl]]'', ''[[G.I. Jane]]'', ''[[La Femme Nikita]]'', Ripley from ''[[Alien (Alien franchise)|Alien]]'' - but also not forgetting ''[[Pippi Longstocking]]'', Pepper from ''[[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]'', and Clarice (Jodie Foster) from ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]''.

The book also relates a brief background on warrior women in history, myth, and literature, chronicling the effects of male fantasy and societal values on their portrayal in film and on television, and their overall portrayal in Hollywood. Revenge and loss of father, [[Oedipal]] conflicts and sisterhood are among the themes underlying warrior-women movies that are discussed. The book also contains special features sections which include topics such as the "Weapons of Warrior Women," "Occupational Hazards of Superheroines," and the study of the representation of women as felines ("The Feline Woman") and the association of women and snakes in myths and history ("Woman and the Serpent").

'''Tony Pastor''' (May 28, 1837 &amp;ndash; August 26, 1908) was an American [[impresario]], variety performer and theatre owner who became one of the founding forces behind [[United States|American]] [[vaudeville]] in the mid- to late-nineteenth century. He was sometimes referred to as the "Father of Vaudeville". The strongest elements of his entertainments were an almost [[jingoism|jingoistic]] brand of [[United States]] patriotism and a strong commitment to attracting a mixed-gender audience, the latter being something revolutionary in the male-oriented variety halls of the mid-century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Snyder, Robert W. | title=The Voice of the City: Vaudeville and Popular Culture in New York | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1989 | isbn=0-19-505285-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A collection of his papers is maintained at the [[Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center]] at the [[University of Texas]] in Austin,&lt;ref name=RansomCtr&gt;{{cite web |title=Tony Pastor: An Inventory of His Collection |url=http://research.hrc.utexas.edu:8080/hrcxtf/view?docId=ead/00106.xml |publisher=Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center |accessdate=2014-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the archives of the [[New York Public Library for the Performing Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tony Pastor collection |url=http://www.nypl.org/archives/4785 |publisher=New York Public Library |work=Archives &amp; Manuscripts |accessdate=2014-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
After his Spanish father (Antonio Pastor) came to New York and met his future wife Cornelia Buckley, from [[New Haven, Connecticut]], they lived in Manhattan.  Their third child, and first son, Antonio Pastor, was born in [[Manhattan]] on May 28, 1837, at his parents' residence at 400 [[Greenwich Street]], in what is now the financial district of lower Manhattan.  His father was a Spanish immigrant who supported his family as a barber and part-time musician.&lt;ref name=Fields&gt;{{cite book |first=Armond |last=Fields |title=Tony Pastor, Father of Vaudeville |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XlCFnqopzQ4C&amp;pg=PA4 |year=2007 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-7864-3054-3 |pages=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zellers&gt;{{cite book |first=Parker |last=Zellers |title=Tony Pastor: Dean of the Vaudeville Stage |publisher=Eastern Michigan University Press |year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William Ellis |last=Horton |title=About Stage Folks |year=1902 |publisher=Free Press Printing |page=9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tQQOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
Pastor embarked on a show business career at a very young age, obtaining a job singing at [[P.T. Barnum]]'s [[Barnum's American Museum|Scudder's American Museum]]. During the next few years he worked in [[minstrel show]]s, the circus business, and as a comic singer in variety revues. He established himself as a popular songwriter during a four-year run at [[Robert Butler (vaudevillian)|Robert Butler]]'s American Music Hall, a variety theater located at 444 Broadway in what is now called Soho but was then the heart of the lower Manhattan theater district. Pastor published "songsters", books of his lyrics which were sung to popular tunes. The music had no notation, as it was assumed that the audience had a collective knowledge of popular song. The subject matter of his music was intended to be bawdy and humorous.&lt;ref name=NYT1908&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Tony Pastor and His 60 Years on the Stage |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=August 16, 1908 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tony-Pastor-02.JPG|left|thumb|225px|Tony Pastor and Bonnie Thornton (circa 1897)]]

Though Pastor was popular with the nearly all-male variety theater audiences, he knew that his ticket sales would double if he attracted a female audience. Soon he began to produce [[variety shows]], presenting an evening of clean fun that was a distinct alternative to the bawdy shows of the time and more appropriate for middle-class families. In 1865 Pastor opened Tony Pastor's Opera House on the Bowery in partnership with [[minstrel show]] performer, Sam Sharpley, whom he later bought out. The same year he organized traveling minstrel troupes who toured the country annually between April and October. With shows that appealed to women and children as well as the traditional male audience, his theater and touring companies quickly became popular with the middle classes and were soon being imitated.

In 1874, Pastor moved his company a few blocks to take over Michael Bennett Leavitt's former theater at 585 Broadway. The theater district was moving uptown to Union Square, however, and in 1881 Pastor took a lease on the former Germania Theatre on 14th Street in the same building that housed [[Tammany Hall]]. He alternated his theater's presentations between [[operetta]]s and family-oriented variety shows, creating what became known as [[vaudeville]]. His theater featured performers such as [[Ben Harney]] presenting a new style called "[[ragtime]]" as well as other up-and-coming talents such as [[Joe Weber (vaudevillian)|Weber]] and [[Lew Fields|Fields]], [[George M. Cohan]], [[Sophie Tucker]], [[Lillian Russell]], [[Buster Keaton]], [[Gus Edwards]], [[Eva Tanguay]], [[Blossom Seeley]], [[Benny Fields]], [[May Irwin]] and [[Eddie Leonard]].  Harry S. Sanderson was his business manager from 1878 until 1908. The business records from this period are available to researchers.&lt;ref name=RansomCtr/&gt;

In the musical [[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]], the song "Put On Your Sunday Clothes" includes the line, "We'll join the Astors at Tony Pastor's".  It also references seeing "the shows at [[Delmonico's]]", which suggests that the character does not really know about upper class social life in New York.

Tony Pastor died in [[Elmhurst, Queens|Elmhurst]], New York on August 26, 1908 and was interred in the [[Cemetery of the Evergreens]], in [[Brooklyn]].  He was 71, and though greatly mourned at his death as one of the last gentlemen of the early vaudeville halls, the medium had passed him by with the advent of the vaudeville circuit in the 1880s.  Pastor had remained a local showman in an epoch that increasingly came to be dominated by regional and national chains.  Fighting against the monopolies for the rights of individual local showmen was an undertaking that marked the last years of his life, earning him the nickname of "Little Man Tony".{{clear left}}

===Music===
According to the humor of the time, Pastor wrote several songs that negatively portrayed ethnic stereotypes, such as "The Contraband's Adventures", the story of a freed slave. After the slave is set free by [[Union Army|Union]] soldiers, he attends an anti-slavery meeting where the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] try to scrub off his dark pigment. The slave concludes by singing...

&lt;blockquote&gt; ...De nigger will be nigger till de day of jubilee&lt;br&gt;
For he never was intended for a white man.&lt;br&gt;
Den just skedaddle home-leave de colored man alone;&lt;BR&gt;
For you're only making trouble for de nation;&lt;BR&gt;
You may fight and you may fuss&lt;BR&gt;
But you never will make tings right&lt;BR&gt;
Until you all agree for to let de nigger be&lt;BR&gt;
For you'll neber, neber, neber wash him white! &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though he separated some ethnic groups in his music, he also intended to unite the lower and middle classes. In songs like "The Upper and Lower Ten Thousand", he defended the common man of the Bowery:

&lt;blockquote&gt; If an [[Upper-Ten]] fellow a swindler should be&lt;BR&gt;
And with thousands of dollars of others make free&lt;BR&gt;
Should he get into court, why, without any doubt,&lt;BR&gt;
The matter's hushed up and they'll let him step out.&lt;BR&gt;
If a Lower-Ten Thousand chap happens to steal,&lt;BR&gt;
For to keep him from starving, the price of a meal,&lt;BR&gt;
Why the law will declare it's a different thing-&lt;BR&gt;
For they call him a thief, and he's sent to [[Sing-Sing]]! &lt;/blockquote&gt;

An '''unseen character''' in theatre, comics, film, or television, or '''silent character''' in radio, is a [[Character (arts)|character]] referred to but not directly known to the audience, but who advances the action of the plot in a significant way, and whose absence enhances their effect on the plot.&lt;ref name="Mahfouz" /&gt; The concept does not apply to the non-visual medium of [[literature]], where all characters are unseen by the reader.

The portrayal of an unseen character may vary depending on the form of media. In visual media such as film, stage or television, an unseen character may sometimes be partially depicted as body parts or an offscreen voice, but is still considered unseen as long as their face is never revealed.

== History ==
Unseen characters have been used since the beginning of theatre with the [[classical Greece|ancient Greek]] [[tragedy|tragedians]], such as [[Laius]] in [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' and [[Jason]]'s bride in [[Euripides]]' [[Medea (play)|''Medea'']], and continued into Elizabethan theatre with examples such as Rosaline in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''.&lt;ref name="Gray" /&gt; However, it was the early twentieth-century European playwrights [[August Strindberg|Strindberg]], [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]], and [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]] who fully developed the dramatic potential of the unseen character. [[Eugene O'Neill]] was influenced by his European contemporaries and established the absent character as an aspect of character, narrative, and stagecraft in [[Theater of the United States|American theatre]].&lt;ref name="Mahfouz"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mahfouz|first1=Safi Mahmoud|title=The Presence of Absence: Catalytic and Omnipresent Offstage Characters in Modern American Drama.(Critical essay)|journal=The Midwest Quarterly|date=22 June 2012|volume=53|issue=4|pages=392(18)|url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-297138820/the-presence-of-absence-catalytic-and-omnipresent|accessdate=8 August 2016|publisher=Pittsburg State University - Midwest Quarterly|language=English|issn=0026-3451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose and characteristics ==
Unseen characters are causal figures included in dramatic works to motivate the onstage characters to a certain course of action and advance the plot, but their presence is unnecessary. Indeed, their absence makes them appear more powerful because they are only known by inference.&lt;ref name="Mahfouz" /&gt; The use of an unseen character "take[s] advantage of one of the simplest but most powerful theatrical devices: the manner in which verbal references can make an offstage character extraordinarily real [...] to an audience," exploiting the audience's tendency to create visual images of imaginary characters in their mind.&lt;ref name="Lawson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lawson|first1=Mark|title=Missing in action: meet the invisible stars of contemporary drama|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/apr/08/missing-in-action-contemporary-drama-unseen-stars|accessdate=4 February 2018|work=The Guardian|publisher=Trinity Mirror|date=8 April 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study of 18th-century French comedy, F. C. Green suggests that an "invisible character" can be defined as one who, though not seen, "influences the action of the play".&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frederick Charles Green|authorlink1=Frederick Charles Green|editor1-last=Jones|editor1-first=Percy Mansell|editor1-link=Percy Mansell Jones|editor2-last=Austin|editor2-first=L. J.|editor3-last=Reed|editor3-first=Garnet|editor4-last=Vinaver|editor4-first=Eugéne|title=Studies in Modern French Literature|chapter=Some Marginal Notes on Eighteenth-Century French Comedy|date=1961|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|pages=133-137|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VRa8AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA133&amp;pg=PA133#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 February 2018|language=en|quote=The invisible character may best be defined as a character who, although never shown to the audience, nevertheless influences the action of the play.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition, according to Green, would rule out a character like Laurent (Lawrence), ''[[Tartuffe]]'s'' unseen valet,  whose sole function is merely to give the playwright an opportunity to introduce Tartuffe.&lt;ref name="Green" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tartuffe"&gt;{{cite wikisource|title=Tartuffe or the Hypocrite|last=Poquelin|first=Jean-Baptiste|author-link=Molière|others=Translated by [[Curtis Hidden Page]]|year=1664|chapter=Act II, Scene II}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unseen characters can develop organically even when their creators initially did not expect to keep them as unseen, especially in episodic works like television series. For instance, the producers of ''[[Cheers]]'' and ''[[Frasier]]'' initially did not want to make the character [[Niles Crane]]'s wife [[Minor characters on Frasier#Maris Crane|Maris]] an unseen character because they did not want to draw parallels to Vera, [[Norm Peterson]]'s wife on ''Cheers''. They originally intended that Maris would appear after several episodes, but were enjoying writing excuses for her absence so eventually it was decided she would remain unseen, and after the increasingly eccentric characteristics ascribed to her, no real actress could portray her.&lt;ref name="Couch"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Barbour, Jon (Producer); Khammar, Gary (Producer) |date=24 November 2003 |title=Behind the Couch: The Making of 'Frasier' |medium=DVD |volume=Season 1 |language=English |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tKGHc-9Qyc |publisher=Paramount Home Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

===Comics===
* [[Al Capp]] introduced [[Lena the Hyena]] in June 1946 as an invisible character in the ''[[Li'l Abner]]'' newspaper strip. She was described as "the world's ugliest woman". Characters always reacted in fright when they saw her or an image of her but readers couldn't see her because she was hidden behind objects or out of frame. Eventually Capp organized a contest in which readers could send in their own graphic interpretations of what she might look like. The winner was cartoonist [[Basil Wolverton]], whose design was first shown in the 21 October 1946 strip.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/w/wolverton.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Merho]]'s comics series ''[[De Kiekeboes]]'' Mevrouw Stokvis, a friend of Moemoe Kiekeboe, is always mentioned or referred to, but has never actually been seen in the series.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/m/merho.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theatre ===
Unseen characters occur elsewhere in drama, including the plays of [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[Tennessee Williams]], and [[Edward Albee]].&lt;ref name="Byrd"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Byrd|first1=Robert E.

The series gradually severed all ties with the original detective series. Both the series and the character herself were renamed in an attempt to change direction, but this did not help the poor ratings and the series was ultimately canceled in March 1980 after only thirteen episodes had aired.&lt;ref name="totally"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.totallykate.com/mrscolum/katemyst.htm|title=Kate Loves a Mystery|accessdate=May 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="freeuk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbo-site.freeuk.com/mrsc.htm|title=Mrs. Columbo Revealed!|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On ''[[Rhoda]]'', Carlton, the doorman in [[Rhoda Morgenstern]]'s apartment building, is often heard on the intercom (voiced by [[Lorenzo Music]]) but almost never seen – only his arm would occasionally appear from doors and he was once shown dancing and conversing while wearing a gorilla mask. After ''Rhoda'' ended its run, Carlton was featured as an animated character in the 1980 spin-off special ''[[Carlton Your Doorman]]''.

'''''Émilie''''' is an [[opera]] – specifically a 9-scene, 75-minute [[monodrama]] for [[soprano]] – by Finnish composer [[Kaija Saariaho]] (b. 1952)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://musicologynow.ams-net.org/2016/06/saariahos-lamour-de-loin-first-woman.html|title=Saariaho's L'amour de loin: First Woman Composer in a Century at the Metropolitan Opera|website=musicologynow.ams-net.org|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a [[libretto]] by [[Amin Maalouf]]. It was written in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sikorski.de/575/en/0/a/0/oper/1037688_emilie_oper.html ''Émilie''] at [[Hans Sikorski|Sikorski]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2010|title=NEWS SECTION|jstor=40794473|journal=Tempo|volume=64|issue=252|pages=115–117|doi=10.2307/40794473}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the life and writings of Marquise [[Émilie du Châtelet]] (1706-1749),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chesternovello.com/Default.aspx?TabId=2434&amp;State_2912=2&amp;newsId_2912=1907 ''Émilie''] at [[Music Sales Group|Chester &amp; Novello]]: synopsis, premiere information&lt;/ref&gt; the work premiered at the [[Opéra National de Lyon|Opéra de Lyon]], France, on 1 March 2010, with Finnish soprano [[Karita Mattila]], its dedicatee. It recounts the achievements of the [[mathematician]], physicist, and [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] of [[Voltaire]]: the first woman to establish an international scientific reputation, with pioneering work in the study of [[fire]].

The opera ''Émilíe'' is based on the actual biography of [[Émilie du Châtelet]], who was a contemporary intellectual to, as well as the [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] of, [[Voltaire]]. She also took another lover later who fathered her child. The [[childbirth]] led to her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://womeninscience.history.msu.edu/Biography/C-4A-0/marquise-du-chtelet/|title=Women in Science {{!}} Biographies {{!}} Marquise Du Châtelet|website=womeninscience.history.msu.edu|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the plot of the opera, her character's arias are linked to the birth of the child and of her significant scholarship. The [[soprano]] soloist is seen in character pregnant and penning new ideas as the opera begins. The  subject of the work depicted in the opera was an actual French translation of technical writing in ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Newton|Eléments de la philosophie de Newton]]'' (1738). Though her French translation of what is also known simply as ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]] by'' [[Isaac Newton]] was published posthumously in 1759, it remains a definitive text.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/emilie-du-chatelet/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Detlefsen|first=Karen|date=2016|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émilie du Châtelet|Châtelet]] died 10 years prior to its publication. Composer Saariaho uses creative license to dramatically and sonically set the two births for solo soprano in a historical [[monodrama]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://saariaho.org/works/emilie/|title=Emilie «  Kaija Saariaho|website=saariaho.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The context of women characters and roles in [[opera]]s from the 17th century to the present rarely address their role as scientists or scholars, not to mention [[childbirth]], making this composition and performance an intervention that expands the genre as studied in new or [[feminist musicology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Opera_Or_The_Undoing_of_Women.html?id=dc4HeHS3ulMC|title=Opera, Or, The Undoing of Women|last=Clement|first=Catherine|date=1999|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|isbn=9780816635269|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7waGip0qN6sC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=susan%20mclary&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=susan%20mclary&amp;f=false|title=Feminine Endings: Music, Gender, and Sexuality|last=McClary|first=Susan|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|isbn=9781452906362|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émilie du Châtelet|Émilie]] is one of three "female-centered operas" by Saariaho exhibiting a sonic world that feminist musicologist [[Susan McClary]] opines as "a 'sensual version of [[modernism]],' one in which 'smoldering intensities' of desire find [[Human voice|voice]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/04/29/even-the-score|title=Even the Score|last=Ross|first=Alex|date=2013-04-22|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-11-17|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [[Émilie du Châtelet|Châtelet]] was actually tutored in mathematics by leading European scholars and her exceptional skills were thought to influence Voltaire's work,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the scenery in the 2008 [[Opéra National de Lyon|Opera de Lyon]] production of the opera featured images of mathematical [[equation]]s as significant aspects of the set and scenery for the monodrama.

Reviews dubbed it a "[[Bluestocking|blue-stocking]] monodrama about the tension between intellect and nature." Billed as the third opera by [[Kaija Saariaho|Saariaho]], Emilie is more accurately a sister-piece to the [[oratorio]] [[La Passion de Simone]] (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/classical/reviews/emilie-op-ra-national-de-lyon-lyon-france-1917293.html|title=Emilie, Opéra National de Lyon, Lyon, France|date=2010-03-07|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-11-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual score is accessible online.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
