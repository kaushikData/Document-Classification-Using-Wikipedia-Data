In October 2017, the company encouraged Roberts to inject himself with an untested gene therapy that the company claimed was capable of curing his HIV. That test was [[live-streamed]] on Facebook. In an early February 2018 biohacking conference in Texas in which Traywick injected himself on-stage, Traywick claimed the company may have created a vaccine and cure for herpes. This attracted much ire from the biohacking community.}}&lt;/ref&gt; to make inexpensive treatments available for incurable conditions such as [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] and the [[herpes simplex virus]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610179/a-biotech-ceo-explains-why-he-injected-himself-with-a-diy-herpes-treatment-live-on-stage/|title=A biotech CEO explains why he injected himself with a DIY herpes treatment on Facebook Live|last=Mullin|first=Emily|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/02/biohacking-stunts-crispr/553511/|title=A Biohacker Regrets Publicly Injecting Himself With CRISPR|last=Zhang|first=Sarah|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; His lack of any medical training and his unconventional methods—such as broadcasting an associate injecting himself with an “untested experimental gene therapy”, then later doing the same to himself in an onstage public demonstration—drew widespread criticism. 

He was found dead under unexplained circumstances in April 2018.

== Education ==
Aaron Traywick was a resident of [[Elmore, Alabama|Elmore]], Alabama, and a graduate of [[Stanhope Elmore High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brooksidefuneralhomeal.com/obituaries/Aaron-Traywick/#!/Obituary|title=Mr. Aaron James Traywick: Obituary &amp; Service Information|last=|first=|date=|website=Brookside Funeral Home {{!}} Memorial Services|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the [[University of Montevallo]] in Alabama with a degree in interdisciplinary studies; he held no background in the sciences or formal training in clinical medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonian.com/2018/05/01/dc-spa-confirms-controversial-ceo-aaron-traywick-died-premises/|title=DC Spa Confirms Controversial CEO Aaron Traywick Died on Its Premises {{!}} Washingtonian|date=2018-05-01|work=Washingtonian|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
In 2016 he worked to advocate investment in radical approaches towards [[Life extension|anti-aging]] at the [[Edwina Rogers#Global Healthspan Policy Institute|Global Healthspan Policy Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/01/global-healthspan-policy-institute-launches/ Jan. 25, 2015: New Thinktank to Promote Research, Innovation for Treatment of Underlying Causes of Aging-Related Disease]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 he founded Ascendance Biomedical in Washington, D.C. with the mission to “make cutting edge biomedical technologies available for everyone”. 

Traywick's self-administered [[Do it yourself|DIY]] homemade gene therapies received substantial media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acsh.org/news/2018/02/08/biohackers-injecting-themselves-internet-homemade-drugs-thing-12535|title=Biohackers Injecting Themselves on the Internet with Homemade Drugs is a Thing {{!}} American Council on Science and Health|website=www.acsh.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42989077|title=Bodyhackers: Bold, inspiring and terrifying|last=Lee|first=Dave|date=2018-02-08|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41990981|title=Why I injected myself with an untested gene therapy|last=Lussenhop|first=Jessica|date=2017-11-21|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a16691487/fda-gene-therapy-concern-crispr/|title=People Are Treating Themselves With DIY Gene Therapies and the Government Is Getting Worried|date=2018-02-08|work=Popular Mechanics|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/5/16973432/biohacking-aaron-traywick-ascendance-biomedical-health-diy-gene-therapy|title=A biohacker injected himself with a DIY herpes treatment in front of a live audience|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://futurism.com/bad-idea-biohacker/|title=Surprise!

In a later conversation with BBC reporters, he spoke of it as a “treatment” for Herpes Virus, a term with a specific meaning subject to FDA regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43973588|title=Controversial biohacker is found dead|date=2018-05-02|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after the event, the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] issued a statement on the inherent dangers of this approach to untested gene editing, without mentioning the company by name:&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/CellularGeneTherapyProducts/ucm586343.htm|title=FDA Statement on Cellular and Gene Therapy Products: Information About Self-Administration of Gene Therapy|last=FDA|first=Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research|date=|website=FDA.gov|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Block quote|The FDA is aware that gene therapy products intended for self-administration and “do it yourself” kits to produce gene therapies for self-administration are being made available to the public.

At the time of his death, Traywick was planning a [[CRISPR]] gene therapy trial for the treatment of lung cancer in Tijuana, Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://crisprrejuvenation.com|title=CRISPR Rejuvenation|website=crisprrejuvenation.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611076/before-he-died-this-biohacker-was-planning-a-crispr-trial-in-mexico/|title=Before he died, this biohacker was planning a CRISPR trial in Mexico|last=Mullin|first=Emily|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-05-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and served as managing director for Inovium Rejuvenation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://inoviumrejuvenation.com/aaron-traywick|title=Aaron Traywick: Inovium Rejuvenation|last=|first=|date=|work=Inovium Rejuvenation|access-date=2018-05-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was conducting pre-enrollment for FDA-approved trials in several US locations to reverse menopause, rejuvenate ovaries, restore fertility, and bring hormone levels back in line with those found in youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://inoviumrejuvenation.com/aaron-traywick|title=Aaron Traywick - Inovium Rejuvenation|work=Inovium Rejuvenation|access-date=2018-05-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://futurism.com/new-anti-aging-technique-goes-to-clinical-trials/|title=A New Anti-Aging Technique Just Made It to Clinical Trials|date=2017-01-15|work=Futurism|access-date=2018-05-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.totrevolution.com/power-crispr-cas9|title=The Power of Crispr Cas9 &amp; How to Create a Clearer Truth w/Aaron Traywick - TOT Revolution|date=2017-12-12|work=TOT Revolution|access-date=2018-05-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
Traywick was found unconscious in a [[Isolation tank|sensory deprivation isolation tank]], or “float pod”, at Soulex Float Spa in Washington, D.C. on April 29, 2018.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Citation|last=News2Share|title=Late Aaron Traywick: Previously Unreleased Interview on Biohacking, Transhumanism|date=2018-04-30|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6PBarqWMBE|accessdate=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-43973588 |title=Biohacker Aaron Traywick found dead in a spa |publisher=BBC |date=2 May 2018 |accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Biohacker-Found-Dead-at-DC-Flotation-Spa-481565451.html|title=Biohacker Found Dead in Sensory Deprivation Tank at DC Spa|work=NBC4 Washington|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/biotech-engineer-found-dead-in-sensory-deprivation-tank-in-dc/2018/05/01/ad767c6e-4d69-11e8-84a0-458a1aa9ac0a_story.html|title=Biotech engineer found dead in sensory deprivation tank in D.C.|last=Hermann|first=Peter|date=2018-05-02|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spa spokesperson informed reporters that the spa's co-owner arrived twenty minutes after Traywick's float session was scheduled to end, and asked why someone was still in the float room. The door was closed although unlocked. The room was dark, though its automatic lights should have been activated when the tank's lid was opened. Traywick was discovered in the tank, which had automatically drained by that point. Emergency responders arrived within four minutes of the spa's 911 call.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonian.com/2018/05/02/aaron-traywick-dc-spa-says-police-found-drug-paraphernalia/|title=Police Reportedly Found Drug Paraphernalia Among Aaron Traywick's Belongings|date=2018-05-02|work=Washingtonian|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traywick’s body was taken to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner for an autopsy. A spokesperson for the spa told reporters that DC police twice told her they found drug paraphernalia among Traywick's belongings;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonian.com/2018/05/02/aaron-traywick-dc-spa-says-police-found-drug-paraphernalia/|title=Police Reportedly Found Drug Paraphernalia Among Aaron Traywick's Belongings|date=2018-05-02|work=Washingtonian|access-date=2018-05-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; DC police did not confirm this point. Toxicology reports were said to be expected six to ten weeks following autopsy.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

An autopsy report provided to Bloomberg News on June 28 by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner showed that he accidentally drowned with the drug [[ketamine]] in his system. Ketamine, a [[Dissociative|dissociative anesthetic]], is sometimes used as a [[Ketamine#Recreational use|recreational drug]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-29/autopsy-reveals-biohacker-traywick-died-from-accidental-drowning|title=It Wasn't Biohacking That Killed the Biohacker: He Drowned|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. [[Transhumanism|Transhumanist Party]] issued an official statement about his death, saying it was, as far as they were aware, a "tragic accident".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://transhumanist-party.org/2018/05/02/ustp-traywick-statement/|title=U.S. Transhumanist Party Official Statement on the Death of Aaron Traywick – U.S. Transhumanist Party – Official Website|website=transhumanist-party.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anna Leopoldovna''' ({{lang-ru|А́нна Леопо́льдовна}}; 18 December 1718&amp;nbsp;– 19 March 1746), born as '''Elisabeth Katharina Christine von Mecklenburg-Schwerin''' and also known as '''Anna Carlovna'''{{sfn|EB|1878}} (А́нна Ка́рловна), was [[regent]] of [[Russian Empire|Russia]] for a few months in 1740 and 1741 during the minority of her infant son Emperor [[Ivan VI of Russia|Ivan VI]].{{sfn|EB|1911}}

==Biography==
===Early life===
Anna Leopoldovna was born as Elisabeth Katharina Christine, the daughter of [[Karl Leopold, Duke of Mecklenburg|Karl Leopold]], Duke of [[Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Mecklenburg-Schwerin]],{{sfn|EB|1911}} by his wife [[Tsarevna Catherine Ivanovna of Russia|Catherine]], the eldest daughter of Tsar [[Ivan V of Russia]]. Catherine's father, Ivan V, was the elder brother and co-ruler of Russia with [[Peter the Great]], but because he was mentally challenged and unfit to rule, all the power was in the hands of [[Peter the Great]], who was like a father to Catherine and who looked out for her interest as long as he was alive.

Elisabeth's mother Catherine was the third wife of Duke Karl Leopold, who had divorced his first two wives after very short marriages (less than two years each). Catherine was the only wife ever to bear him a living child, and Elizabeth was that single child. In 1721, when Elizabeth was three years old, her mother became pregnant a second time, but the child was [[stillborn]]. By this time, the marriage between her parents was in trouble, and in 1722, Catherine returned to the court of her uncle [[Peter the Great]]. She took her daughter with her, and Elizabeth therefore grew up in Russia, having little or no contact with her father.

In 1730, Tsar [[Peter II of Russia|Peter II]], who was the last surviving male member of the [[Romanov dynasty]], died unwed, and his dynasty died with him. The Russian privy council debated about whom to invite to the throne, and Anna's mother Catherine was one of the candidates who was considered. However, she was passed over for several reasons and the throne was offered to her younger sister, Anna Ivanovna, who became known to history as Empress [[Anna of Russia]]. The new Empress was a childless widow with only one surviving sister, Catherine, and Elizabeth was Catherine's only child. Her position at court was therefore a important one.
[[File:Anton ulrikh.jpg|thumb|left|Anthony Ulrich]]
In 1733, Elisabeth converted to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and was given the name Anna Leopoldovna, which was a complement to her aunt, [[Empress Anna]], and also of her father, Karl Leopold, Duke of Mecklienburg-Schwerin. Her conversion to the orthodox faith made her acceptable as heiress to the throne, but she was never actually declared heiress by her aunt. In 1739, Anna Leopoldovna (as she was now known) was given in marriage to [[Duke Anthony Ulrich of Brunswick|Anthony Ulrich]] (1714–1776), the second son of [[Ferdinand Albert II, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Ferdinand Albert]], Duke of [[Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]].{{sfn|EB|1911}} Anthony Ulrich had lived in Russia since 1733 so that he and his bride could get to know each other better, He was able to do this because he was a younger son, and it was improbable that he would be called upon to shoulder the responsibility of ruling his father's principality. Both of these circumstances clearly indicate that Empress Anna intended her niece to inherit her throne, and was laying the ground for it by selecting a husband of suitable birth and situation, and observing him at close quarters for several years before the marriage was celebrated.

On 5 October 1740, the empress Anna adopted their newborn son Ivan and proclaimed him heir to the Russian throne.{{sfn|EB|1878}} On 28 October, just a few weeks after this proclamation, the empress died, leaving directions regarding the succession and appointing her [[favourite]] [[Ernst Johann von Biron|Ernest Biron]], Duke of [[Courland]], as regent.{{sfn|EB|1911}}

Biron, however, had made himself an object of detestation to the Russian people.{{sfn|EB|1878}} After Biron threatened to exile Anna and her spouse to Germany, she had little difficulty working with Field Marshal [[Burkhard Christoph von Münnich]] to overthrow him.{{sfn|EB|1878}} The coup succeeded and she assumed the regency on 8 November, taking the title of [[Grand Duke|Grand Duchess]]. Field Marshal Münnich personally arrested Biron in his apartment, where the formerly tyrannical Biron ingloriously begged for his life on his knees.{{sfn|Moss|2001|p=255}}

===Regency===
Anna knew little of the character of the people with whom she had to deal, knew even less of the conventions and politics of Russian government, and speedily quarrelled with her principal supporters.{{sfn|EB|1911}}

According to the ''Dictionary of Russian History'',{{clarify|date=June 2015}} she ordered an investigation of the garment industry when new uniforms received by the military were found to be of inferior quality. When the investigation revealed inhuman conditions she issued decrees mandating a minimum wage and maximum working hours in that industry as well as the establishment of medical facilities at every garment factory. She also presided over a brilliant victory by Russian forces at the [[Battle of Villmanstrand]] in Finland after Sweden had declared war against her Government. 

She had an influential favourite, [[Julia von Mengden]]. Anna's love life took up much time, as the bisexual Anna was involved simultaneously in what were described as "passionate" affairs with the Saxon ambassador Count Mozritz zu Lynar and her lady-in-waiting Mengden.{{sfn|Moss|2001|p=254}} Anna's husband did his best to ignore the affairs.{{sfn|Moss|2001|p=254}} After becoming Regent, Anton was marginalized, being forced to sleep in another palace while Anna took either Lynar, Mengden or both to bed with her.{{sfn|Troyat|2000|p=99}} At times the grand duke would appear to complain about being "cuckolded", but he was always sent away.{{sfn|Troyat|2000|p=99}} At one point, Anna proposed to have Lynar marry Mengden in order to unite the two people closest to her in the world together.{{sfn|Troyat|2000|p=101}} The regent's relationship with Mengden caused much disgust in Russia, though the French historian [[Henri Troyat]] wrote that amongst the many libertines of St. Petersburg Anna's "sexual eclecticism" in having both a man and a woman as her lovers was seen as a sign of Anna's open-mindedness.{{sfn|Troyat|2000|p=100}} More damagingly, many in the Russian elite believed that at the age of twenty-two Anna was too young and immature to be the Regent of Russia and that her preoccupation with her relationships with Lynar and Mengden at the expense of governing Russia made her a danger to the state.{{sfn|Moss|2001|p=254}} 

Troyat described Anna as an "indolent day-dreamer" who spent her mornings reading novels in bed, only got up in the afternoon, liked to wander around her apartment barely dressed with her hair undone, and was principally interested in reading novels.{{sfn|Troyat|2000|p=99}} Anna's preference for handing out government jobs to [[Baltic nobility|Baltic German aristocrats]] caused much resentment on the part of the ethnic Russian nobility who not for the first nor last time complained that a disproportionate number of [[Baltic Germans]] were holding high office.{{sfn|Moss|2001|p=254}}

===Later life===
In December 1741, [[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabeth]], the daughter of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]], excited the guards to revolt, having already become a favorite of theirs.{{clarify|date=June 2015}}{{sfn|EB|1878}} The coup overcame the insignificant opposition and was supported by the ambassadors of [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]], owing to the pro-British and pro-Austrian policies of Anna's government. The French ambassador in St. Petersburg, [[Jacques-Joachim Trotti, marquis de La Chétardie|the marquis de La Chétardie]], was deeply involved in planning Elizabeth's coup and bribed numerous officers of the Imperial Guard into supporting the coup.{{sfn|Cowles|1971|pp=67-68}}

The victorious regime first imprisoned the family in the fortress of [[Dünamünde]] near [[Riga]] and then [[exile]]d them to [[Kholmogory, Arkhangelsk Oblast|Kholmogory]] on the [[Northern Dvina]] river. Anna eventually died on 18 March 1746 during childbirth.{{sfn|EB|1911}} Her son Ivan VI was murdered in [[Shlisselburg]] on 16 July 1764, while her husband Anthony Ulrich died in Kholmogory on 19 March 1776. Her remaining four children ([[Catherine Antonovna of Brunswick|Ekaterina]], Elizaveta, Peter and [[Alexei Antonovich of Brunswick|Alexei]]{{sfn|Kamenskiĭ|Griffiths|1997||p=164 }}) were released from prison into the custody of their aunt, the Danish queen dowager [[Juliana Maria of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]], on 30 June 1780 and settled in [[Jutland]], where they lived in comfort under  [[house arrest]] in [[Horsens]] for the rest of their lives under the guardianship of Juliana and at the expense of [[Catherine the Great]]. Having lived as prisoners, they were not used to social life, and kept a small "court" of some forty to fifty people, all Danish except for the priest.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Marie |last=Tetzlaff |title=Katarina den stora |year=1998|page={{page needed|date=December 2016}}}}{{full|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Army-Navy "E" Award''' was an honor presented to companies during [[World War II]] whose production facilities achieved "Excellence in Production" ("E") of war equipment. The award was also known as the Army-Navy Production Award.  The award was created to encourage industrial [[mobilization]] and production of war time materials.  By war's end, the award had been earned by only 5% of the more than 85,000 companies involved in producing materials for the U.S. military's war effort.

== History ==
[[File:"For Excellence in producton, Army Navy "E" - NARA - 514282.jpg|thumb|For Excellence in production, Army Navy "E", Let's Keep It Flying!]]
[[File:Army-Navy Production Award to Stanley Works, presentation program, January 20, 1943 - New Britain Industrial Museum - DSC09905.JPG|thumb|Army-Navy Production Award to [[Stanley Black &amp; Decker|Stanley Works]], presentation program, January 20, 1943]]

An earlier award, the Navy "E" Award, had been created in 1906 during [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s administration.&lt;ref name=Previous&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/a/army-navy-e-award.html#award |title=Letter from The Secretary of the Navy to The American Brass Company |work=[[United States Secretary of the Navy]] |publisher=[[Naval History and Heritage Command]] (archivist) |date=1942-04-07 |accessdate=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fuller"&gt;Fuller, George Newman. ''Michigan History.'' Michigan Historical Commission, Lewis Beeson, Michigan State Historical Society, page 22 {{Volume needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of World War I, the Navy "E" Award had been joined by the Army "A" Award and the Army-Navy Munitions Board "Star".

These three separate awards continued until seven months after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] had pulled the United States into [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=EndDetail&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/a/army-navy-e-award.html#press |title=Army-Navy “E” Award Termination Sees Award Granted to 5% of Eligible Plants |work=[[United States Department of War|The War Department]] Bureau of Public Relations |publisher=[[Naval History and Heritage Command]] (archivist) |date=1945-12-05 |accessdate=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 1942, the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] proclaimed that the new Army-Navy "E" Award would merge the Navy "E", Army "A" and Army-Navy Munitions Board "Star" into a single, service-wide award.&lt;ref name=NewAward&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/a/army-navy-e-award.html#circ |title=Circular No. 228, 1942: Army-Navy Production Award |work=[[United States Department of War|The War Department]] |publisher=[[Naval History and Heritage Command]] (archivist) |date=1942-07-08 |accessdate=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criteria ==
All factories engaged in war production were eligible to receive the award. Government as well as privately owned plants were eligible, as were contractors.&lt;ref name=NewAward/&gt;

Although the award was granted to industry, one academic institution and one individual received it. Iowa State College (now [[Iowa State University]]) received the award for its contribution to the production of uranium for the [[Manhattan Project]]. Dr. [[Harley A. Wilhelm]] received the award for inventing the [[Ames process]] for the extraction, purification and mass production of uranium for the Manhattan Project, which occurred at Iowa State College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ameslab.gov/about/our-history |title=Our History |publisher=[[Ames Laboratory]] |accessdate=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some factors which were considered in selecting recipients were:&lt;ref name=NewAward/&gt;

* Quality and quantity of production
* Overcoming of production obstacles
* Avoidance of work stoppages
* Maintaining of [[Fair Labor Standards Act|fair labor standards]]
* Training of additional labor forces
* Good record keeping in relation to health and safety

District procurement officers, chiefs of the supply services, agencies concerned with production and the Commanding Officers for the Matériel Commands would recommend plants, complete with the reasons for such recommendations.  An Award Board would review the recommended plants and decide on granting of the awards.&lt;ref name=NewAward/&gt;

== Design ==
The award consisted of a [[Pennon|pennant]] for the production plant and emblems for all employees in the plant at the time the award was made. The pennant was a [[Swallowtail (flag)#Triangular swallowtail|triangular swallowtail]] with a white border, with a capital E within a yellow wreath of oak and laurel leaves on a vertical divided blue and red background. ARMY is on the red background and NAVY on the blue background. 

[[File:Army &amp; Navy. Bridgeport Brass Ordnance Employees Are Working For the Star - NARA - 534377.jpg|thumb|File:Army &amp; Navy. Bridgeport Brass Ordnance Employees Are Working For the Star]]
Plants that maintained an outstanding record of performance for six months after receiving their original Army-Navy E-Award were granted a star award, with a white star added to their pennant.&lt;ref name="Fuller"/&gt;  As with only a small percentage of all war production companies earning an Army-Navy "E" Award, only a small number of these earned stars, with a very small number of plants earning six stars by the end of the war. 

== Ceremony ==
Usually an Army officer and a Navy officer would be present at a ceremony, where the company would assemble all the employees involved in production. After the award of the pennant to the plant (to be flown), the employees present would receive individual pins.

A total of 4,283 companies received the award in the course of the war.&lt;ref name=EndDetail/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Herbert M. (1945). ''The Theatre Catalog.'' Philadelphia: Jay Emanuel Publications; page xviii&lt;/ref&gt; This amounted to about five percent of the companies engaged in war work.&lt;ref name=EndDetail/&gt;

== Program end ==
The Army-Navy "E" Award was terminated three months after the end of World War II, on December 5, 1945.&lt;ref name=EndDetail/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18919">'''Battered woman syndrome''' ('''BWS''') emerged in the 1990s from several murder cases in England in which women had killed violent partners in response to what they claimed was cumulative abuse, rather than in response to a single provocative act. Feminist groups, particularly [[Southall Black Sisters]] and [[Justice for Women]], challenged the legal definition of [[Provocation (legal)|''provocation'']], and in a series of appeals against murder convictions secured the courts' recognition of battered woman syndrome.&lt;ref name=Connelly2010p292&gt;{{cite book|last1=Connelly|first1=Clare|editor1-last=Hunter|editor1-first=Rosemary|editor2-last=McGlynn|editor2-first=Clare|editor3-last=Rackley|editor3-first=Erica|title=Feminist Judgments: From Theory to Practice|date=2010|publisher=Hart Publishing|location=Oxford|pages=(292–310), 292|chapter=Commentary on ''Attorney-General for Jersey v Holley''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bottomley1996p201&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bottomley|first1=Anne|title=Feminist Perspectives on The Foundational Subjects of Law|date=1996|publisher=Cavendish Publishing|location=London|p=201|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Magrath|first1=Paul|title=Law Report: Classic direction to jury on provocation defence upheld: R v Ahluwalia|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/law-report-classic-direction-to-jury-on-provocation-defence-upheld-r-v-ahluwalia-court-of-appeal-1538094.html|work=The Independent|date=3 August 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tan11July1995&gt;Ying Hui Tan (11 July 1995).

Walker]]'s ''The Battered Woman'' (1979).

==The law==
{{further|Provocation in English law}}

Until the mid-1990s, the legal definition of ''provocation'' in England had relied on [[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin|Devlin J]] in ''R v Duffy'' [1949] 1 All ER 932: "Provocation is some act, or series of acts done (or words spoken)&amp;nbsp;... which would cause in any reasonable person and actually causes in the accused, a sudden and temporary loss of self-control, rendering the accused so subject to passion as to make him or her for the moment not master of his or her mind." Three cases helped to change this: [[Kiranjit Ahluwalia|''R v Ahluwalia'']] [1992] 4 AER 889; [[Emma Humphreys|''R v Humphreys'']] [1995] 4 All ER 1008); and ''[[Sara Thornton case|R v Thornton]] (No 2)'' [1996] 2 AER 1023.&lt;ref name=Connelly2010p292/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bottomley1996p201/&gt;

The courts in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States have accepted the extensive and growing body of research showing that battered women can use force to defend themselves and sometimes kill their abusers because of the abusive and sometimes life-threatening situation in which they find themselves, acting in the firm belief that there is no other way than to kill for self-preservation. The courts have recognized that this evidence may support a variety of defenses to a charge of [[murder]] or to mitigate the [[sentence (law)|sentence]] if convicted of lesser offenses. Battered woman syndrome is not a legal defense in and of itself, but may legally constitute:

* Self-defense when using a reasonable and proportionate degree of violence in response to the abuse might appear the most appropriate defense but, until recently, it almost never succeeded. Research in 1996 in England found no case in which a battered woman successfully pleaded self-defense (see Noonan at p. 198). After analysing 239 appellate decisions on trials of women who killed in self-defense in the U.S., Maguigan (1991) argues that self-defence is gender biased.
* [[provocation (legal)|provocation]];
* insanity (usually within the meaning of the [[M'Naghten Rules]]); and
* [[diminished responsibility]].

However, in 1994, as part of the [[Violence Against Women Act]], the [[United States Congress]] ordered an investigation into the role of battered woman syndrome expert testimony in the courts to determine its validity and usefulness.  In 1997, they published the report of their investigation, titled ''The Validity and Use of Evidence Concerning Battering and Its Effects in Criminal Trials''.  "The federal report ultimately rejected all terminology related to the battered woman syndrome...noting that these terms were 'no longer useful or appropriate{{'"}} (Rothenberg, "Social Change", 782).&lt;ref&gt;Rothenberg, Bess.  {{"'}}We Don't Have Time for Social Change’ Cultural Compromise and the Battered Woman Syndrome". ''Gender and Society'', Oct. 2003:771-87.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of using the term "battered woman", the terminology "battering and its effects" became acceptable. The decision to change this terminology was based on a changing body of research indicating there is more than one pattern to battering and a more inclusive definition was necessary to more accurately represent the realities of domestic violence.

==English law==
In ''R v Ahluwalia'' (1992) 4 AER 889 a woman ([[Kiranjit Ahluwalia]]), created [[napalm]] and set fire to the bed of her husband, Deepak, after he had gone to sleep. He suffered severe burns over 40% of his body and died 10 days later in the hospital. He allegedly had attempted to break her ankles and burn her with a hot iron on the night of her attack. Accusing him of [[domestic violence]] and [[marital rape]], she claimed provocation. The judge directed the jury to consider whether, if she did lose her self-control, a reasonable person having the characteristics of a well-educated married Asian woman living in England would have lost her self-control given her husband's provocation. On appeal, it was argued that he should have directed the jury to consider a reasonable person suffering from 'battered woman syndrome'. Having considered fresh medical evidence, the [[Court of Appeal (England and Wales)|Court of Appeal]] ordered a retrial on the basis that the new evidence showed an arguable case of [[diminished responsibility in English law]].&lt;ref&gt;''R v Ahluwalia'' (1992) 4 AER 889.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in ''[[Sara Thornton case|R v Thornton]] (No 2)'' (1996) 2 AER 1023 the battered wife adduced fresh evidence that she had a personality disorder and the Court of Appeal ordered a retrial considering that, if the evidence had been available at the original trial, the jury might have reached a different decision. The victim does not have to be in a position to carry out the threats immediately.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Thornton (No 2)'' (1996) 2 AER 1023.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''R v Charlton'' (2003) EWCA Crim 415, following threats of sexual and violent abuse against herself and her daughter, the defendant killed her obsessive, jealous, controlling partner while he was restrained by handcuffs, blindfolded and gagged as part of their regular sexual activity. The term of five years' imprisonment was reduced to three and a half years because of the terrifying threats made by a man determined to dominate and control the defendant's life. The threats created a genuine fear for the safety of herself and more significantly, her daughter, and this caused the defendant to lose control and make the ferocious attack.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Charlton'' (2003) EWCA Crim 415.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''HM's AG for Jersey v Holley'' (2005) 3 AER 371, the Privy Council regarded the Court of Appeal precedent in ''Smith''&lt;ref&gt;''R v Smith (Morgan)'' [1998] ''The Times'', 29 July 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; as wrongly decided, interpreting the Act as setting a purely objective standard. Thus, although the accused's characteristics were to be taken into account when assessing the gravity of the provocation, the standard of self-control to be expected was invariable except for the accused's age and sex. The defendant and the deceased both suffered from chronic [[alcoholism]] and had a violent and abusive relationship. The evidence was that the deceased was drunk and taunted him by telling him that she had sex with another man. The defendant then struck the deceased with an axe which was an accident of availability. Psychiatric evidence was that his consumption of alcohol was involuntary and that he suffered from a number of other psychiatric conditions which, independently of the effects of the alcohol, might have caused the loss of self-control and induced him to kill. Lord Nicholls said:
:Whether the provocative acts or words and the defendant's response met the 'ordinary person' standard prescribed by the statute is the question the jury must consider, not the altogether looser question of whether, having regard to all the circumstances, the jury consider the loss of self-control was sufficient excusable. The statute does not leave each jury free to set whatever standard they consider appropriate in the circumstances by which to judge whether the defendant's conduct is 'excusable'.&lt;ref&gt;''HM's AG for Jersey v Holley'' (2005) 3 AER 371.&lt;/ref&gt;
Since the passage of the [[Coroners and Justice Act 2009]], the defence of provocation—used in a number of the aforementioned cases—has been replaced with 'loss of control'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199696796.001.0001/acprof-9780199696796-chapter-8|title=Principles and Values in Criminal Law and Criminal Justice: Essays in Honour of Andrew Ashworth|last=Mitchell|first=Barry|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=113–132|language=en|chapter=Years of Provocation, Followed by a Loss of Control|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199696796.003.0008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Law Commission Report on ''Partial Defences to Murder'' (2004) rejects the notion of creating a mitigatory defence to cover the use of excessive force in self-defence but accepts that the "all or nothing" effect of self-defence can produce unsatisfactory results in the case of murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawcom.gov.uk/app/uploads/2015/03/lc290_Partial_Defences_to_Murder.pdf The Law Commission Report on ''Partial Defences to Murder''] (2004), Part 4 (pp. 78-86).]&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=December 2017}}

==Australia==
In Australia, self-defence might be considered the most appropriate defence to a charge of murder for a woman who kills to protect her life or the lives of her children in a domestic violence context. It is about the rational act of a person who kills in order to save her (or his) own life.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite AustLII|HCA|75|1998|litigants=Osland v The Queen |parallelcite= |date=10 December 1998 |courtname=auto}}.

Under the new laws, victims of family violence will be able to put evidence of their abuse before the court as part of their defence, and argue self-defence even in the absence of an immediate threat, and where the response of killing involved greater force than the threatened harm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theage.com.au/news/national/end-draws-near-for-defence-of-provocation/2005/10/04/1128191716823.html The Age article].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
In 1911 in [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]], [[Angelina Napolitano]], a 28-year-old, pregnant immigrant, killed her abusive husband Pietro with an axe after he tried to force her into prostitution.&lt;ref name ="PlatinumRelease"&gt;Platinum Image Film press release ''New Film About Italian Immigrant'', March 13, 2006. Accessed June, 2008 via [http://www.heroines.ca/news/archives2006.html A Guide to Women in Canadian History]&lt;/ref&gt;  She confessed and was sentenced to hang after a brief trial, but during the delay before the sentence was carried out (a delay necessary to allow her to give birth to her child), a public campaign for her release began.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;{{cite DCB |title=Napolitano (Neapolitano), Angelina |first=Franca |last=Iacovetta |volume=15 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/napolitano_angelina_15E.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napolitano's supporters argued that the judge in the case had been wrong to throw out evidence of her long-standing abuse at Pietro's hands (including an incident five months before when he stabbed her nine times with a pocket knife).&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt; The [[Cabinet of Canada|federal cabinet]] eventually [[Commutation of sentence|commuted]] her sentence to [[life imprisonment]].&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt; She was the first woman in Canada to use the battered woman defense on a murder charge.&lt;ref name="SooToday"&gt;''I just killed a pig'' by David Helwig. [http://www.sootoday.com/content/news/full_story.asp?StoryNumber=6944 SooToday.com, May 06, 2004. ] Online version accessed June, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] set a precedent for the use of the battered women defence in the 1990 case of ''[[R. v. Lavallee]]''.

==New Zealand==
In ''R v Fate'' (1998) 16 [[CRNZ]] 88 a woman who had come to [[New Zealand]] from the small island of [[Nanumea]], which is part of the [[Tuvalu Islands]], received a two-year sentence for manslaughter by provocation. Mrs. Fate spoke no English and was isolated within a small close-knit [[Wellington]] community of 12 families, so she felt trapped in the abusive relationship.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Fate'' (1998) 16 CRNZ 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, ''The Queen v Epifania Suluape'' (2002) [[NZCA]] 6, deals with a wife who pleaded provocation after she killed her husband with an axe when he proposed to leave her for another woman. There was some evidence of neglect, humiliation, and abuse but the court concluded that this was exaggerated. On appeal, the court was very conscious of the [[Samoa]]n culture in New Zealand in restricting the power of the wife to act independently of her husband and reduced her sentence for manslaughter to five years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/cgi-bin/disp.pl/nz/cases/NZCA/2002/6.html?query=tuvalu%2a ''The Queen v Epifania Suluape'' (2002) NZCA 6(21 February 2002)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
"Guilt" is remorse for having committed some offense or wrong, real or imagined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/guilt "Simple definition of 'Guilt'", ''Merriam-Webster's Learner's Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt; It is related to, although distinguishable from, "shame", in that the former involves an awareness of causing injury to another, while the latter arises from the consciousness of something dishonorable, improper, or ridiculous, done by oneself. One might feel guilty for having hurt someone, and also ashamed of oneself for having done so.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/shame/201305/the-difference-between-guilt-and-shame Burgo, Joseph. "The Difference Between Guilt and Shame", ''Psychology Today'', May 30, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

Philip Yancey compares guilt to the sensation of physical pain as an indication that something should not be ignored but attended to. Rabbi David Wolpe says, "Facing up to the hurt we cause others with cruel speech or callous acts, and to our myriad failures to meet the marks God sets for living a true and good life, "makes forgiveness meaningful, not merely a catchphrase,".&lt;ref&gt;[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/religion/2010-09-11-guilt14ONLINE_ST_N.htm Grossman, Cathy Lynn. "'Catholic guilt,' 'Jewish guilt' not just a joke, it's essential", ''USA Today'', October 14, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Penitential Rite]] at the beginning of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] is a liturgical rudiment of this previously sacramental confession. This private confession became the normal way in which this sacrament was and is practiced, with a strict [[seal of confession|seal of secrecy]] on the part of the priest. Sometimes the practice of the sacrament emphasized doing acts of penance, sometimes it emphasized making one's sorrow or [[contrition]] authentic, sometimes it emphasized confessing all one's serious ([[mortal sin|mortal]]) sins, sometimes it emphasized the power of the priest, In Persona Christi, to absolve the penitent of sin, and currently there are forms that include simply one-on-one confession to a priest or communal preparation and then one-on-one confession to a priest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=  Richard M. |last= Gula |title= To Walk Together Again: The Sacrament of Reconciliation |publisher= Paulist Press |date = 1984-05-01 |isbn= 978-0-8091-2603-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
{{See also|Scrupulosity}}
Guilt is an important factor in perpetuating [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Leslie J.

A study of 165 individuals by the [[University of Parma]] found that religious individuals scored higher on measures of control of thoughts and overimportance of thoughts, and that these measures were associated with obsessive-compulsive symptoms only in the religious participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796701001206 |title=Religiousness and obsessive–compulsive cognitions and symptoms in an Italian population  |date=2002-07-31 |accessdate=2013-11-02 |doi=10.1016/S0005-7967(01)00120-6 |pmid=12074375  |volume=40 |issue=7  |journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy |pages=813–823|last1=Sica  |first1=Claudio  |last2=Novara  |first2=Caterina  |last3=Sanavio  |first3=Ezio  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study noted a link between intrinsic religiosity and obsessive-compulsive cognitions/behaviors only among Catholic participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886997001645 |title=Personality predictors of religious orientation among Protestant, Catholic, and non-religious college students  |date=1998-02-28 |accessdate=2013-11-02 |doi=10.1016/S0191-8869(97)00164-5 |volume=24 |issue=2  |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |pages=145–151|last1=Hutchinson  |first1=Geoffrey T.  |last2=Patock-Peckham  |first2=Julie A.  |last3=Cheong  |first3=Jee Won  |last4=Nagoshi  |first4=Craig T.  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a study from Boston University found that no particular religion was more common among OCD patients, and that OCD patients were no more religious than other subjects with anxiety.

A study in American Behavioral Scientist analyzed interviews with participants from Catholic, Jewish, and Protestant backgrounds. The author reported that most participants "eagerly described an experience of guilt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1985-12077-001|title=Contrasting Experiences of Shame and Guilt|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|first=J.|last=LINDSAY-HARTZ|date=1 August 1984|volume=27|issue=6|pages=689–704|doi=10.1177/000276484027006003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

University of Ulster students participated in a study that found a slightly higher level of collective guilt among the Catholic students than the Protestant students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cS5fqn3KJKIC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=Catholic+guilt#v=onepage&amp;q=Catholic%20guilt&amp;f=false |title=Collective Guilt: International Perspectives – Google Books |accessdate=2013-11-02|isbn=978-0-521-52083-6 |date=2004-09-06 |last1=Branscombe |first1=Nyla B |last2=Branscombe |first2=Nyla R |last3=Doosje |first3=Bertjan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley and from the University of Notre Dame examined the concept of Catholic guilt among U.S. teenagers. The authors found no evidence of Catholic guilt in this population, noting that Catholicism both caused and relieved less guilt than other religious traditions. The authors found no evidence that Catholic teenagers experience more guilt than non-Catholic teenagers. The authors did not find that more observant Catholics feel guiltier than less observant Catholics.  The study also noted no difference in the effect of guilt-inducing behaviors on Catholic versus non-Catholic participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=20447515|title=Catholic Guilt among U.S. Teenagers: A Research Note|first1=Stephen|last1=Vaisey|first2=Christian|last2=Smith|date=1 January 2008|journal=Review of Religious Research|volume=49|issue=4|pages=415–426|doi=10.2307/20447515|doi-broken-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study from Hofstra University reported no difference in total guilt among religions, although religiosity itself was connected to guilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/u62156850p579t85/ |title=Predicting guilt from irrational beliefs, religious affiliation and religiosity –|date=1988-12-01 |accessdate=2013-11-02 |doi=10.1007/BF01061292 |volume=6 |issue=4 |journal=Journal of Rational-Emotive &amp; Cognitive-Behavior Therapy |pages=259–272|last1=Demaria|first1=Thomas|last2=Kassinove|first2=Howard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guilt can be viewed in terms of constructiveness versus destructiveness: "constructive guilt" is focused on forgiving one's ethical lapses and changing one's behavior, while "destructive guilt" remains mired in self-loathing and does not emphasize learning from one's wrongdoings and moving ahead with life. A study in ''Psychology of Religion'' found that Catholic participants demonstrated a higher level of constructive guilt reactions than other groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/brill/arp/2005/00000027/00000001/art00006 |title=ingentaconnect Guilt and Religion: The influence of orthodox Protestant and orth |publisher=Ingentaconnect.com |date=2005-01-01 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
[[Evelyn Waugh]]'s ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]'' involves guilt in the Catholic religion. Distressed by her romantic relationship with Charles Ryder, Julia Flyte exclaims:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Living in sin, with sin, by sin, for sin, every hour, every day, year in, year out. Waking up with sin in the morning, seeing the curtains drawn on sin, bathing it, dressing it, clipping diamonds to it, feeding it, showing it round, giving it a good time, putting it to sleep at night with a tablet of Dial if it's fretful. Always the same, like an idiot child carefully nursed, guarded from the world. 'Poor Julia,' they say, 'she can't go out. She's got to take care of her little sin. A pity it ever lived,' they say, 'but it's so strong. Children like that always are. Julia's so good to her little, mad sin.’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shmoop.com/brideshead-revisited/lady-julia-flyte.html |title=on Julia Flyte |publisher=Shmoop.com |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''[[30 Rock]]'' episode "[[The Fighting Irish]]", Catholic guilt is described by Jack Donaghy ([[Alec Baldwin]]).
&lt;blockquote&gt;Jack Donaghy: That's not how it works, Tracy. Even though there is the whole confession thing, that's no free pass, because there is a crushing guilt that comes with being a Catholic. Whether things are good or bad or you're simply... eating tacos in the park, there is always the crushing guilt".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0974983/quotes IMDB] 30 Rock&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Criticism ==
The term "Catholic guilt" is considered a pejorative against Catholics and Catholic ethics in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://catholicbones.wordpress.com/2009/03/01/catholic-guilt/|title=Catholic Guilt|date=2009-03-01|website=Catholic in the Bones|access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Guilt is a by-product of an informed [[conscience]] but "Catholic" guilt is often confused with [[scrupulosity]]. An overly scrupulous conscience is an exaggeration of healthy guilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholicspiritualdirection.org/scrupulosity.html|title=Catholic Spiritual Direction|website=www.catholicspiritualdirection.org|access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Guilt is not considered a positive thing in itself in any Catholic teaching, rather [[contrition]] is considered constructive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.catholic365.com/article/1116/whats-wrong-with-catholic-guilt.html|title=What's wrong with "Catholic guilt?"|work=Catholic365|access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chacoan peccary''' or '''''tagua''''' (''Catagonus wagneri'') is the last extant species of the genus '''''Catagonus''''';&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fossilworks.org/bridge.pl?a=taxonInfo&amp;taxon_no=42423|title=Fossilworks: Catagonus|website=fossilworks.org|access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is a [[peccary]] found in the [[Gran Chaco]] of [[Paraguay]], [[Bolivia]], and [[Argentina]]. Approximately 3,000 remain in the world. It is believed to be the closest living relative to the [[extinct]] [[genus]] ''[[Platygonus]]''.

The Chacoan peccary has the unusual distinction of having been first described in 1930 based on [[fossil]]s and was originally thought to be an extinct species. In 1971, the animal was discovered to still be alive in the Chaco region, in the Argentine province of [[Salta province|Salta]]. The species was well known to the native people, but it took a while for scientists to acknowledge its existence. It is known locally as the ''tagua''.

==Habitat==
&lt;!-- uncited Chacoan peccaries have received the nickname "pigs from green hell" because of their wild, impenetrable habitats.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}--&gt;

The Chacoan peccary is confined to hot, dry areas. Dominated by low-lying [[succulent plant|succulents]] and thorny bushes, the Gran Chaco is about 140,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. A few scattered giant trees are found, but the majority of the vegetation is thorny [[scrubland|scrub vegetation]]. The Chacoan peccary has developed adaptations such as well-developed [[sinuses]] to combat dry, dusty conditions. Their feet are also small, which allows maneuverability among spiny plants.

==Physical characteristics==
The largest of the three generally accepted species of [[peccaries]], the Chacoan peccary has many [[Suidae|pig]]-like features. It is an [[ungulate]] with a well-formed [[rostrum (anatomy)|rostrum]] with a tough leathery snout. The bristle-like hair is generally brown to almost gray. A dark stripe runs across the back, and white fur is on the shoulders. Chacoan peccaries differ from other peccary species by having longer ears, snouts, and tails. It has white hairs around the mouth, unlike other peccaries. ''Catagonus wagneri'' also has a third hind toe, but other peccaries only have two. The [[hypsodont]] teeth follow this dental formula: 2/3, 1/1, 3/3, 3/3. The upper canines display the distinguishing trait of peccaries, pointing downwards instead of out and up like other [[Suiformes]]. When the Chacoan peccary is nervous or frightened, it flees, and raises the hairs on its back. While escaping, it sprays secretions from its dorsal glands, which may be a signal for other peccaries to keep the group together through the dense bush.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ultimateungulate.com/Artiodactyla/Catagonus_wagneri.html Catagonus wagneri - Chacoan peccary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110021845/http://www.ultimateungulate.com/Artiodactyla/Catagonus_wagneri.html |date=January 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproduction==
Young are generally born between September and December, but litters have been found almost year-round. Births have been linked to periods of food abundance and rainfall. The average number of embryos has been recorded as approximately 2.72. Females may leave the herd to give birth and then return afterwards. Newborns are [[precocial]], able to run a few hours after birth. The pelage of the young resembles that of the adults. There is no [[sexual dimorphism]].

==Behavior==
Chacoan peccaries often travel in herds of up to 20 individuals. They are active during the day, especially in the morning when they are most apt to travel. Herds display a general travel cycle within their home range of 42 days. This allows the individuals to monitor and show ownership over their areas.

These social mammals communicate by various sounds, ranging from grunts to chatters of the teeth. Though individuals may occasionally exhibit aggressive behavior such as charging and biting, this species is not as aggressive as others.

As a defensive strategy, members of a herd may line up in a defensive wall; this makes the herds harder targets for hunters. The Chacoan peccary produces a milky, odorous substance used for marking trees, shrubs, and similar. The substance is secreted from glands located on their backs, and is dispersed by rubbing. Frequently bathing in mud or dust, Chacoan peccaries also defecate at particular "stations".

==Food habits==
The arid habitat of the Gran Chaco region provides very tough vegetation for the Chacoan peccary. These peccaries feed on various species of [[cacti]], such as ''[[Cleistocactus]] baumannii'' and ''[[Opuntia]] discolor''. It uses its tough snout to roll the cacti on the ground, rubbing the spines off. It may pull off the spines with its teeth and spit them out. The kidneys are specialized to break down acids from the cacti. The two-chambered stomachs are also well suited to digest tough foods. Occasionally grazing on [[bromeliad]] roots, it also eats [[acacia]] pods and fallen cactus flowers. This species of peccary seeks out salt licks formed from ant mounds and construction projects (road building and land clearings). The Chacoan peccary gains essential minerals like [[calcium]], [[magnesium]], and [[chlorine]] from the [[salt lick]]s.

==Conservation status==
Because the Chacoan peccary is endemic to a formerly isolated region of South America, it is most vulnerable to human activity. Just as quickly as this species is discovered in an area, it disappears. Herd numbers are decreasing as a result of [[habitat loss]] and [[habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]]. Their range is being quickly transformed into large Texas-style [[ranch]]es. Hunting also continues, as well as an unidentified disease that has plagued the herds in recent years. A population has been established in North American and European zoos. Preserves have also been established in Paraguay, but are not highly enforced.

'''Cédrika Provencher''' (born 29 August 1997) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] girl from [[Trois-Rivières]], [[Québec]], Canada, who disappeared aged 9 on &lt;time&gt;31 July 2007&lt;/time&gt;. Her disappearance resulted in  one of the biggest police search in Québec's history. She was declared "missing" on 31 July 2007 (but some commentators in the media already believed that she was kidnapped), and "likely abducted" 72 hours later.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web |title= Il y a un coupable et il se connaît {{!}} Jean-Marc Beaudoin {{!}} Le Nouvelliste |url= http://www.cyberpresse.ca/le-nouvelliste/200809/08/01-665103-il-y-a-un-coupable-et-il-se-connait.php |website= La Presse |accessdate= 2015-12-11 |language= fr-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web |title= Où est Cédrika? {{!}} Marie-Eve Lafontaine {{!}} Le Nouvelliste |url= http://www.cyberpresse.ca/le-nouvelliste/200809/08/01-653543-ou-est-cedrika.php |website= La Presse|accessdate = 2015-12-11 |language= fr-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the offer of a reward, her whereabouts remained unknown for more than eight years.

On 12 December 2015, Québec  provincial police ([[Sûreté du Québec|SQ]]) announced that her remains had been found by hunters in a woody area not far from Trois-Rivières.&lt;ref name="montreal.ctvnews.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/c%C3%A9drika-provencher-s-remains-found-in-trois-rivieres-sq-1.2698337|publisher=montreal.ctvnews.ca|title=Over 200 police on scene as Cedrika Provencher investigation continues &amp;#124; CTV Montreal News|accessdate=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tvanouvelles.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvanouvelles.ca/2015/12/12/les-restes-humaines-retrouves-a-saint-maurice-sont-ceux-de-cedrika-provencher|title=Les ossements de Cédrika Provencher retrouvés|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobody has yet been charged in relation to this. 

==Disappearance and search==
It is believed that Cédrika was asked by a man to help search for a lost [[dog]], and agreed to help. She cycled around the area, knocking on doors and asking residents if they had seen the dog. She was seen emerging from a wooded area with a friend, closely followed by a man. She was then seen on her bike in a local park and on various nearby streets. At 8:30&amp;nbsp;pm, her bicycle was found leaning against a [[fire hydrant]] on the corner of streets Chabanel and Chapais.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Site Officiel - Fondation Cédrika Provencher|url = http://www.cedrika.com/|website = Fondation Cedrika Provencher|accessdate = 2015-12-11|language = fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lapresse.ca"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cédrika: apprendre à vivre sans sa fille {{!}} Clément Sabourin {{!}} Actualités|url = http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/200809/08/01-662943-cedrika-apprendre-a-vivre-sans-sa-fille.php|website = La Presse|accessdate = 2015-12-11|language = fr-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 August 2007, 72 hours later, municipal officers suggested that she had been abducted, even though it was already known since day one that a man asked her about a dog. The [[Sûreté du Québec]] (SQ) therefore took over the investigation from the smaller Trois-Rivières police service, as per law.

==Discovery of remains==
On 11 December 2015, three hunters stumbled upon a set of human remains in the woods in [[Saint-Maurice, Quebec|Saint-Maurice]], a small town near Trois-Rivières close to [[Quebec Autoroute 40|Highway 40]], about 15&amp;nbsp;km from the last place Cédrika had been seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvanouvelles.ca/2015/12/12/des-restes-humains-trouves-pres-de-trois-rivieres|title=Des restes humains trouvés en Mauricie|publisher=tvanouvelles.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/cedrika-provencher-death-hunters-remains-1.3363077|title='We felt it was related to Cédrika Provencher,' says hunter who found remains of missing girl|publisher=CBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 December, it was confirmed that the remains were Cédrika's although police had no further information at the time and said they would need to carry out further investigations.&lt;ref name="montreal.ctvnews.ca"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tvanouvelles.ca"/&gt; On 16 December, [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|Radio-Canada]] revealed that investigators were still looking for a person of interest who had been seen around the area where Cédrika disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/cedrika-provencher-person-of-interest-1.3367238|title=Man flagged in 2007 remains person of interest in Cédrika Provencher case|publisher=CBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suspect ==
Jonathan Bettez has been considered a prime suspect since early on, but has never been indicted due to a complete lack of [[direct evidence]].

The fact that he was the main suspect was publicly revealed by journalists on 29 August 2016 after he was arrested and charged with six counts of possessing and distributing [[child pornography]]. He was however acquitted on 12 October 2018 by judge Lacoursière, before the beginning of hearings, as the proof against him was considered to have been obtained illegitimately. In December 2015, a day or two after the finding of Cédrika's remains, investigators involved in the case decided to look into whether Bettez, the sole suspect, could be a user of such pornography. Without any warrant, they were given by Facebook inc. 12 [[IP address]]es associated with his account within the last year or so. Their request was motivated by a sense of "urgency" inherent to the recent finding of the corpse, and worry that evidence could be imminently destroyed (judge Lacoursière found however that there was no urgency and that a proper warrant should have been obtained).&lt;ref name="soq"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://citoyens.soquij.qc.ca/ID=B226F63AD18B45B3378731C068F527F6 |title=Décision - R. vs Bettez - 2018 QCCQ 7274 |date=12 October 2018 |website=SOQUIJ |language=fr |access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The querying of an international police database then showed that one of the IP address, which investigators learned was from his place of work (a small company owned by Bettez's father, with more than a dozen of employees using a computer), had been used to view and share illicit content between 2010 and 2011. With this in hands, police officers chose, instead of asking a judge for a specific [[search warrant]], to only request a "general warrant" from a [[justice of the peace#Canada|justice of the peace]], which is easier to obtain and was only intended as an "overview browsing" of Bettez's seized goods. The detailed and thus unauthorized inspection of his electronic devices subsequently revealed traces of a number of illegal files that had been deleted.&lt;ref name=echap&gt;{{Cite journal |date=2018-10-13 |title=Les autorités échappent leur suspect |url=http://plus.lapresse.ca/screens/91bc38c6-0277-4f7f-b829-389ad733eb00__7C___0.html |journal=La Presse+ |language=fr-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="soq"/&gt;

=== Investigation ===
The case against him, at least what was revealed in media, is strictly [[Circumstantial evidence|circumstantial]] and goes as follow. Around the presumed time and place of the kidnapping on 31 July 2007, someone witnessed a "suspicious" red [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]] car with [[Chrome plating|chromed]] door handles. Since this car was also recorded by a surveillance camera at a nearby gas station, the police managed to boil it down to the 2004 red [[Acura TSX]] model, which is assembled with such handles.&lt;ref name="Acura"&gt;{{cite web |title=La thèse de l'Acura rouge confirmée |url=https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/372521/cedrika-acura-rouge |publisher=Radio-Canada |date=2 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The news that the police was looking for a "red Acura" quickly spread through media outlets. In the summer of 2007, there were 258 vehicles of this model and color registered in the province. Only six exactly matched the characteristics that were sought and Bettez was the only owner whose [[alibi]] could not be corroborated. He met with investigators for the first time on 6 September 2007, and on five more occasions before 24 October. From then, he has been the object of intense police surveillance, including the use of hidden cameras and [[wiretapping]].&lt;ref name="tribune"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.latribune.ca/actualites/justice-et-faits-divers/affaire-cedrika-provencher-des-details-sur-lenquete-finalement-rendus-publics-eb096788e215d7dd54e001d2cd4423ec |title=Affaire Cédrika Provencher: des détails sur l’enquête finalement rendus publics |date=2018-07-12 |work=La Tribune |access-date=2018-10-22 |language=fr-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 September he initially accepted to let his vehicle be searched, but at that time the car was in a repair shop to have [[Automobile repair shop#Auto body repair|bodywork]] done on its rear. Investigators only gained access to the car in December after obtaining a search warrant, but no meaningful forensic evidence was retrieved.&lt;ref name="tribune" /&gt; In the meantime, the SQ announced through media in November that it was "certain" the infamous ''Acura rouge'' car was involved in the kidnaping.&lt;ref name="Acura" /&gt;

Bettez has always refused to take a [[polygraph|polygraph test]] one way or the other, and according to crime journalist [[Claude Poirier]], he was at some point planning to flee to [[Switzerland]], a country which has no [[Extradition|extradition treaty]] with Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.985fm.ca/actualites/nouvelles/affaire-cedrika-le-suspect-voulait-quitter-le-pay-791748.html|title=Affaire Cedrika: le suspect voulait quitter le pays, selon Claude Poirier • Actualités • 98,5 fm Montréal|website=www.985fm.ca|accessdate=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to court documents filed during pre-hearing and obtained by journalists, he was the object in 2009 of a year-long [[undercover operation]] similar to the "[[Mr. Big (police procedure)|Mr. Big technique]]", so as to elicit confidences concerning Cédrika — to no avail.&lt;ref name="Radio-Canada"&gt;{{cite web |title=Affaire Cédrika Provencher : des documents montrent l'ampleur de la traque de Bettez |url=https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1111832/cedrika-provencher-documents-traque-jonathan-bettez |publisher= Radio-Canada |language=fr |date= 2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even before 2016 he was already rumored to be involved in the case. In 2011, a journalist from the investigative television program [[TVA Nouvelles#JE|''J.E.'']] tried to interview Bettez, which he declined on camera. At the time, the segment aired on [[TVA (Canada)|TVA channel]] but the suspect was kept unnamed and his face [[Pixelization|blurred]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.tvanouvelles.ca/2016/08/30/je-avait-rencontre-jonathan-bettez |title=«J.E.» avait rencontré Jonathan Bettez |website=TVA Nouvelles |language=fr-CA |access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' [[fantasy]] [[role-playing game]] contains many [[Lists of Dungeons &amp; Dragons monsters|monsters]] that are similar or related to dragons but which are not "[[Dragon (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|true dragons]]", which are dragons that grow stronger with age. These can be [[Magical beast (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|magical beast]]s, half-dragons, creatures with more distant dragon ancestry, races descending from actual dragons, or creatures of other types, which resemble dragons. Alternatively, they could have the [[Creature type (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)#Dragon|dragon type or keyword]], but not be true dragons, or they could have the "dragonblood" subtype in the 3rd edition of ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]''.

==Ambush Drake==

Ambush drakes are dragons that are [[Wolf|lupine]] in form rather than [[felidae|feline]] like true dragons. They are short, squat and compact compared to normal dragons, but still grow to be at least as large as an adult human. They have muscular limbs, and short spines on their necks and ugly heads. Their wings are disproportionate. Ambush drakes have grey bodies and back legs, with dark orangey-red heads, front legs and wings. They are far less intelligent than regular dragons.

In the [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]] [[fantasy]] [[role-playing game]], the dracotaur is a [[Dragon (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|dragon]]. They are sort of a dragon-[[centaur]], having the upper body of a [[List of reptilian humanoids|reptilian humanoid]] and the lower body of a dragon. They are nomadic hunter-warriors who practice [[Sorcerer (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|sorcery]] and occasionally serve true dragons.

Dracotaurs are large creatures which have the upper torso of a muscular reptilian humanoid, and the lower, quadrupedal body of a wingless dragon. Their eyes are black, their feet large and clawed, and their sharp teeth glisten.

The favored class of the dracotaur is the [[Sorcerer (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|sorcerer]]. Dracotaur [[Barbarian (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|barbarians]], [[Fighter (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|fighters]], and [[Ranger (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|rangers]] are also common. Dracotaurs are not overly religious, with [[Cleric (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|clerics]] of them being rare. If not, however, Dracotaurs worship [[Tiamat (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Tiamat]]. They speak Draconic.

}}
'''Half-dragons''' are fictional creatures in the [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]] [[fantasy]] [[roleplaying game]].

A dragon's magical nature allows it to breed with virtually any species. This sort of [[Conception (biology)|conception]] usually happens when a dragon has been polymorphed or had its form changed in some way. Metallic half-dragons are usually kind except when abused by the common races in the game which will turn half-dragons away from all others except from its kin; those based on evil chromatic dragons often mirror their progenitor's outlook. Half-dragon's features are reptilian, with scales, horns, elongated faces and exaggerated teeth and claws. All have wings.

When engaged in combat half-dragons are formidable creatures and can be nearly invulnerable to weak adventurers. All Half-Dragons have a breath weapon according to their variety. Gold, Red and Brass spew fire. Bronze and Blue breathe lightning. Black, Green and Copper exhale acid and corrosive gas. Silver and White dragons blow extremely frigid air and ice. In addition all half-dragons have a special immunity towards the element of their breath weapon. There are exceptions to this for different dragon types. For example, the Deep Dragon of the Forgotten Realms setting has a Corrosive Acid gas breath weapon, but has a Charm immunity rather than an acid immunity.

The accessory, '''[[Races of the Dragon]]''', has information on playing a half-dragon character, making half-dragons based on other dragon types (such as the dragons of the [[Oriental Adventures]] or [[Forgotten Realms]] [[campaign setting]]s or the planar dragons of the ''[[Draconomicon]]''), and creating draconic creatures (which have some amount of dragon blood in their family, but not a dragon parent).

In the [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]] [[fantasy]] [[role-playing game]], '''landwyrms''' are wingless, predatory cousins of [[Dragon (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|dragons]]. They lack the breath weapons that are a signature of true dragons. They have some basic similarities to wurms, such as different species inhabiting certain environments, and neither having wings. However, landwyrms have legs, unlike wurms.

* '''Desert Landwyrm''' – Neutral Evil landwyrm found in desert environments. Its heart burns with a patient evil as it waits for prey to pass by as it hides under the desert sand. They are often found in ruins and ancient tombs. It is usually the most intelligent type of landwyrm.
* '''Forest Landwyrm''' – Lawful Neutral landwyrm found in temperate forest environments. The kindest of the landwyrms. It may sometimes protect villages of gnomes.
* '''Hill Landwyrm''' – Chaotic Evil landwyrm found in temperate hills. A heavy-bodied, very stupid bully that will attack anything weaker than itself. It fears hill giants.
* '''Jungle Landwyrm''' – Neutral Evil landwyrm found in warm forests and jungles. Though it is very large, it can glide through jungle foliage like a small monkey. With its disease-bearing claws, it can kill almost anything. Its only predators are older green dragons.
* '''Mountain Landwyrm''' – Lawful Evil landwyrm found in mountain environments. The largest of the landwyrms, it can be 80&amp;nbsp;ft. long. It sleeps most of the time, but when it awakes, its tread can shake the earth.
* '''Plains Landwyrm''' – Chaotic Neutral landwyrm found in temperate plains. The smallest and weakest of the landwyrms. It commonly walks on its hind legs and resembles a raptor. It is a reputed scavenger.
* '''Swamp Landwyrm''' – Chaotic Evil landwyrm found in warm marshes. An extremely cruel and deadly monster whose eyes glow with malice. It preys on anything, even large black dragons.
* '''Tundra Landwyrm''' – Neutral landwyrm found in cold plains. It normally lies under the snow in semi-hibernation. It drinks the blood of warm-blooded creatures.
* '''Underdark Landwyrm''' – Lawful Evil landwyrm found underground. Its eyesight is very poor, but it has an excellent sense of smell.

==Linnorm==
In the [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]] [[fantasy]] [[role-playing game]], '''linnorms''' are ancient, primeval cousins of [[Dragon (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|dragons]].  Linnorms lack wings and hind legs, making them more serpentine than true dragons.  All known linnorms are evil and cruel.

Linnorms are sometimes referred to as "Norse dragons".

* '''Corpse Tearer Linnorm''' – The most powerful linnorm, possesses energy drain, spells and acid breath.
* '''Dread Linnorm''' – Two-headed linnorm, the largest of its kind. They are also very intelligent and knowledgeable in matters of lore.
* '''Flame Linnorm'''
* '''Forest Linnorm'''

'''Spawn of Tiamat''' are the progeny of Dragons, though not themselves of the Dragon type. They are the main object in a theme recently applied to such settings as [[Eberron]] and the [[Forgotten Realms]], in that [[Tiamat (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Tiamat]], the evil patron goddess of evil [[Dragon (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|dragons]], is waging war against [[Bahamut (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Bahamut]], and the mortal races. In order for her legions to be more effective, she has tweaked with the eggs of her Dragon minions to produce all manner of bizarre draconic creatures suited to special roles in the war, such as assassination, bodyguarding, elite shock trooping, and aerial/aquatic support.

Spawn of Tiamat are created by all manner of experiments and rituals and such upon the eggs, come in all shapes and sizes and forms, are of varying intelligence levels, perform all manner of roles, and are basically the most varied members of dragonkind. All however, are descended from true dragons serving Tiamat, and are fiercely loyal to both her and their parents. Spawn of Tiamat are named according to the color they and their parent are of, followed by the word spawn, and then the type of spawn they are. The creatures are the key elements in the Monster Manual IV, and the recent War of the Dragon Queen D&amp;D miniatures pack. Below is a list of the known types of spawn of Tiamat, and a brief description of each:

===Blackspawn Raider===
These are created in large hordes to act like draconic ogres, minotaurs, orcs, goblins, lizardfolk and such. They gather in groups at camps on the fringes of civilization, and occasionally raid against a town or village. They look like wingless, orc-sized, humanoid black dragons with minotaur-like horns. They are often depicted with large swords or axes.

===Blackspawn Stalker===
These resemble spider-like black dragons. They have two sets of horns, razor-sharp teeth, 6 eyes, 8 legs, bloated abdomens, no wings, and two tails which can weave silk.

===Bluespawn Ambusher===
These perform, as their name suggests, the role of ambushing people. They lurk beneath the sand of their desert homes, or on top of a rock, and then leap forward like a pouncing lion and kill victims with their horn, claws, and lightning attacks. They resemble medium, wingless blue Dragons with leonine bodies. They have huge front legs for attacking, and long, muscular back legs for leaping.

===Bluespawn Burrower===
These resemble [[marmot]]-like, wingless Blue dragons with enormous front legs, paws and claws. As their name implies, their role is digging and tunneling.

===Bluespawn Godslayer===
These are designed for slaying Tiamat's most powerful foes and adversaries. They are created from the placing of her blessing upon one of her most trusted blue Dragon lieutenants. They resemble giant, wingless, humanoid blue Dragons who always carry a huge blade and an arm-length shield made from a Dragon's skull. They are very intelligent, extremely strong, and fanatically loyal behemoths. They are probably the most famous of the Spawn of Tiamat.

===Bluespawn Stormlizard===
These resemble wingless blue dragon-like [[rhinoceri]]. From their stubby front horn, they can cast lightning so powerful it can, as the creature's name suggests, create storms.

===Greenspawn Leaper===
These resemble fiendish, [[sugarglider]]-like green dragons. They have web-like wings between their limbs, and they specialize in leaping from trees, gliding, and ambushing victims from above.

===Greenspawn Razorfiend===
These resemble lanky, crested, humanoid green Dragons with wings growing from their arms and fingers the way those of a bat do. They live in swampy forests.

===Greenspawn Sneak===
These specialize in assassination, sabotage, spying and the like. They resemble tiny, very silent and stealthy, wingless, humanoid green dragons. They are often depicted with twin blades, and black leather armor.

===Redspawn Arcaniss===
These are the spellcasters of the spawn of Tiamat. They are extremely skilled at casting magic and spells, particularly ones associated with fire. They resemble humanoid, wingless red Dragons with crested, spiked heads and tails. They are depicted with spiked body armor, and a bronze, mace-like wand.

===Redspawn Firebelcher===
These resemble large, chubby, round, short-tailed wingless red dragons with bloated stomachs. They dwell in the lairs of true red dragons, and bask on the banks of pools of molten lava the way seals do on beaches. They attack, as their name suggests, by inhaling heat from the air, and then belching it out in enormous blasts of flame.

===Whitespawn Berserker===
These resemble fiendish, lanky, jointed, wingless, alien-like white Dragons. As their name suggests, they specialize in fighting with two weapons, usually a pair of spiked, serrated whips.

===Whitespawn Hordeling===
These specialize in overwhelming opponents. They resemble small, wingless, monkey-like white dragons who carry twin weapons and breath shards of ice. They always travel in huge groups, which attack in unison.

===Whitespawn Iceskidder===
These resemble bluish-white dracotaurs with claws like [[ski]]s and sail-like wings attached to their arms. As their name suggests, they specialize in traveling on ice, using their claws as skates and their wings for direction.

==Life==
Roach grew up in Mount Pleasant, [[Tobago]]:
{{quote|My village, Mount Pleasant, was a sprawling bushy compound of crude wattle or clapboard cabins with thatched or tin roofs, shabby like ourselves. In later years it seemed to me that in my boyhood we were clinging to life by the skin of our teeth and did not realise our hardship because we knew nothing else.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Roach, 'Growing up in Tobago', in Michael Anthony &amp; Andrew Carr, eds., ''David Frost Introduces Trinidad and Tobago'', London: Andre Deutsch, 1975, pp. 147-58&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1960s, Roach began to gain an international reputation. However, he became overwhelmed and depressed, and committed suicide in 1974, drinking insecticide before swimming in the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eric Roach|url=http://www.peepaltreepress.com/authors/eric-roach|accessdate=3 August 2017|work=Peepal Tree Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Breiner|first1=Laurence|title=Laureate of nowhere|url=http://caribbeanreviewofbooks.com/crb-archive/10-november-2006/laureate-of-nowhere/|accessdate=3 August 2017|journal=Caribbean Review of Books|date=November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EFQM''' (the European Foundation for Quality Management) is a not-for-profit membership foundation in Brussels, established in 1989 to increase the [[competitiveness]] of the [[European economy]]. The initial impetus for forming EFQM was a response to the work of [[W. Edwards Deming]] and the development of the concepts of [[Total Quality Management]].

== History ==
The intention to found EFQM was signed in October 1988 by 14 European business leaders. The 14 CEOs were:

The foundation was formed in 1989, with 67 members.  The first version of the [[EFQM Excellence Model]] was created by a group of experts from various sectors and academic institutions and launched in 1992. It acted as the framework for assessing applications for the [[European Quality Award]], the [[List of national quality awards|transnational quality awards]] of Europe.

== Activities ==
EFQM provides networking, education, and awards, using a framework called the [[EFQM Excellence Model]].

The '''fetal head''', from an obstetrical viewpoint, and in particular its size, is important because an essential feature of labor is the adaptation between the fetal head and the maternal bony [[pelvis]]. Only a comparatively small part of the head at term is represented by the face. The rest of the head is composed of the firm skull, which is made up of two frontal, two parietal, and two [[temporal bone]]s, along with the upper portion of the occipital bone and the wings of the [[sphenoid bone|sphenoid]]. 

These bones are separated by membranous spaces, or sutures. The most important sutures are the frontal, between the two frontal bones; the [[sagittal]], between the two parietal bones; the two coronal, between the frontal and parietal bones; and the two [[lambdoid]], between the posterior margins of the [[parietal bone]]s and upper margin of the [[occipital bone]]. Where several sutures meet, an irregular space forms, which is enclosed by a membrane and designated as a fontanel. The greater, or anterior fontanel, is a lozenge-shaped space that is situated at the junction of the [[sagittal]] and the coronal sutures. The lesser, or posterior fontanel, is represented by a small triangular area at the intersection of the [[sagittal]] and [[lambdoid]] sutures. The localization of these fontanels gives important information concerning the presentation and position of the fetus. The temporal, or casserian fontanels, have no diagnostic 

It is customary to measure certain critical diameters and circumferences of the newborn head. The diameters most frequently used, and the average lengths thereof, are:
#The [[occipitofrontal circumference|occipitofrontal]] (11.5&amp;nbsp;cm), which follows a line extending from a point just above the root of the nose to the most prominent portion of the occipital bone.
#The [[Parietal bone|biparietal]] (9.5&amp;nbsp;cm), the greatest transverse diameter of the head, which extends from one parietal boss to the other.
#The bitemporal (8.0&amp;nbsp;cm), the greatest distance between the two temporal sutures.
#The occipitomental (12.5&amp;nbsp;cm), from the chin to the most prominent portion of the [[occiput]].
#The suboccipitobregmatic (9.5&amp;nbsp;cm), which follows a line drawn from the middle of the large fontanel to the undersurface of the occipital bone just where it joins the neck.

The greatest circumference of the head, which corresponds to the plane of the [[occipitofrontal circumference|occipitofrontal]] diameter, averages 34.5&amp;nbsp;cm, a size too large to fit through the pelvis without flexion. The smallest circumference, corresponding to the plane of the suboccipitobregmatic diameter, is 32&amp;nbsp;cm. The bones of the cranium are normally connected only by a thin layer of fibrous
tissue that allows considerable shifting or sliding of each bone to accommodate the size and shape of the maternal pelvis. This intrapartum process is termed molding. The head position and degree of skull ossification result in a spectrum of cranial plasticity from minimal to great and, in some  Cases, undoubtedly contribute to fetopelvic disproportion, a leading indication for cesarean delivery.

===Silver Age===
{{Main|Legion of Super-Heroes (1958 team)}}
[[Image:LightningLordOrigin.JPG|200px|thumb|left|Lightning Lad's origin.]]
Lightning Lad is a founding member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] along with [[Saturn Girl]] and [[Cosmic Boy]].  Born on the planet [[Winath]], he is the twin brother of fellow Legionnaire [[Ayla Ranzz]] (Lightning Lass), the younger brother of the [[supervillain]] Mekt Ranzz ([[Lightning Lord]]), and the father of two sets of twins; Sons Garridan ([[Validus]]) and Graym Ranzz and daughters Dacey and Dorrit Ranzz.

Early in the Legion's history, he sacrificed himself battling [[Zaryan the Conqueror]], but was later resurrected by the sacrifice of [[Proty]], [[Chameleon Boy]]'s shapeshifting pet. However, a later [[retcon]] revealed that Proty's mind had actually taken over Lightning Lad's form. This retcon has since been eliminated from Legion canon.

An incident against a monster dubbed the "[[Super Moby Dick of space]]" resulted in the loss of Lightning Lad's right arm, which was replaced with a bionic appendage.  He eventually had his arm regrown, but in the interim a criminal scientist used the situation to hypnotize Lightning Lad into acting as the super criminal [[Starfinger]] who used the bionic arm as a weapon. After the [[Great Darkness Saga]], his son was abducted by [[Darkseid]] and he was subsequently transformed into the monster [[Validus]].

During the [[Legion of Super-Heroes#"Five Years Later"|"Five Year Gap"]] following the Magic Wars, Earth fell under the covert control of the [[Dominators (DC Comics)|Dominators]], and withdrew from the [[United Planets]].  A few years later, the members of the Dominators' highly classified "Batch SW6" escaped captivity.  Originally, Batch SW6 appeared to be a group of teenage Legionnaire clones, created from samples apparently taken just prior to [[Ferro Lad]]'s death at the hands of the [[Sun-Eater]].  Later, they were revealed to be time-paradox duplicates, every bit as legitimate as their older counterparts.  After Earth was destroyed in a disaster reminiscent of the destruction of [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] over a millennium earlier,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' (Vol. 4) #38 (Late December 1992) [[DC Comics]].&lt;/ref&gt;  a few dozen surviving cities and their inhabitants reconstituted their world as New Earth. The SW6 Legionnaires remained, and their version of Lightning Lad assumed the code name '''Live Wire'''.  Unlike the adult Garth, he did not possess Proty's mind or personality.  Thus, the teenage Live Wire was far more reckless and rebellious than any previous depiction of Garth.

===Zero Hour - Reboot===
{{Main|Legion of Super-Heroes (1994 team)}}
In the aftermath of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' Superman's origin was revamped and Superboy was erased from Superman's past. Unfortunately, the Legion's history greatly revolved around Superboy, and that version of the character was [[retcon]]ned into being part of a "pocket universe", a solution which caused several continuity errors. After the ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'' miniseries, Legion history was completely rebooted. Garth's new history started when the twins went with Mekt on a trip in their parents' new space cruiser and became stranded on the barren planet [[Korbal]] after the cruiser's power cells drained. Ayla suggested that they use the "Lightning Beasts" (the only living things on the planet) in an attempt to recharge their cruiser. The only result of this, however, was that all three were found in [[coma]]s the following day as a result of massive [[electric shock|electrocution]].{{issue|date=November 2015}}

Months later, Garth and Ayla awoke simultaneously to find that Mekt had awoken around a week earlier, displayed electrical powers like the Beasts, threatened the staff, and vanished. After hearing this, they kept the fact that they had developed similar powers from their parents before Garth, thinking that the lightning had corrupted Mekt somehow and would soon corrupt them and refusing to believe that Mekt had developed into a [[Psychopathy|sociopath]] just because he had been a "solo" on a world of twins, ran away from home to find Mekt (telling his parents he was going to visit his Aunt Ryth), despite Ayla's attempts to dissuade him.{{issue|date=November 2015}}

====Legion====
Hearing that Mekt might be on Earth, he got on a shuttle bound for Earth via Titan, and met [[Cosmic Boy|Rokk Krinn]] there. The two hit it off immediately, but although he developed a crush on her at first sight, [[Saturn Girl|Imra Ardeen]] gave him a frosty reception. Nonetheless, when she shouted that four "maintenance men" were actually assassins after [[R.J. Brande]], the three worked together to stop them. This gave Brande an idea. Shortly after, a bar-room brawl caused Garth to be arrested, but just as his cellmates were about to beat him up, [[Triad (comics)|Triad-Orange]] came and posted his bail - Brande wanted a word. There, he found the other two Luornus had fetched Imra and Rokk. Brande, a follower of the 21st Century "Heroic Age", proceeded to talk the three of them into founding "a Legion of Heroes. Super-Heroes," with Garth taking the codename '''Live Wire'''.{{issue|date=November 2015}}

Despite early tension between him and Saturn Girl, Garth's initial period with the Legion passed with little trouble, until his sister showed up. At this point, they were only permitted to have one Legionnaire per world and Garth, classed as a runaway, was not who Winath wanted to represent them. Ayla, codenamed '''Spark''', was apologetic, but neither of them had much choice in the matter and after he nearly leveled Legion Plaza in his fight with [[Ultra Boy]] (after UB had threatened Ayla), he quit rather than embarrass Rokk or Imra any more by letting them plead to let him stay.{{issue|date=November 2015}}

====Solo====
After this, he joined [[Leland McCauley|Leland McCauley's]] [[Workforce (comics)|Workforce]] to try to get the money to follow Mekt again, but only stayed with them a short time before McCauley's complete lack of morals became too much and he quit. Shortly afterward, he went to ask Brande if he could borrow a ship to find his brother. Since several stargates (the standard means of traveling faster than light, which Brande manufactured) had recently been destroyed and Brande didn't want to take any chances, he turned him down, but told him to go and visit Saturn Girl, who was in the hospital, having been mentally regressed to childhood by the strain from shutting down the [[Composite Man|Composite Man's]] mind. Upon seeing her have a toddler-style temper tantrum, though, he could not bring himself to go in.{{issue|date=November 2015}}

Shortly after, several [[Daxamites]] attacked Earth, and when Garth visited Legion HQ to see if he could help, he was given a flight ring by Rokk and ordered to go and see Imra (who he'd seen pleading for Garth earlier). When she saw him, she threw her arms around him, and, by telling her that the Legion needed her - and that HE needed her - he talked her back to sanity.{{issue|date=November 2015}}

At the end, the three founders stood on Legion HQ as Saturn Girl called the Daxamites there, just in time for [[Element Lad]] and [[Brainiac 5]] to send them to a planet where they would be powerless, ending the threat.{{issue|date=November 2015}}

====Mekt====
In the aftermath, however, he was once more forced off the team—and stung by Ayla's charge that he talked a good game on finding Mekt, but never actually did anything about it—- he went on his travels again to try once more to find his wayward brother. After spending 27060 [[Credit (finance)|credits]] in his search, he found himself on the planet Bisbe, having been robbed of his last 512 credits. When trying to get his money back, he was arrested for murder under Mekt's name. Rather than protesting that he wasn't Mekt, he stayed silent, and just as the truth was discovered, Mekt broke through the wall and killed the police officer who was trying to dissuade Garth from taking Mekt's fall. When Garth saw just how insane Mekt had become, he tried to blast him, but was knocked out by his brother. Meanwhile, Ayla was told of Garth's arrest and the cop's electrocution, and she rushed straight to Bisbe.{{issue|date=November 2015}}

Garth awoke just as they were entering Korbal's orbit, where Mekt started killing more beasts to increase his own power, so he would be the only one with lightning powers, a plan that did not involve Garth or Ayla. As Garth realized this, several [[Science Police]] cruisers flew overhead announcing that ''he'' was under arrest for the murder of a policeman. Mekt immediately began to down the cruisers, while Garth pleaded with Mekt to stop. Finally, when Ayla showed up, a ranting Mekt attacked her. Garth was finally forced to face the truth about Mekt, but Mekt, now more powerful than both of the twins together, retaliated by vaporizing Garth's right arm. Ayla grabbed Mekt's laser pistol and shot him in the leg, delaying him while she saw that Garth's wound had cauterized itself. Finally, as Mekt prepared to finish them off, Garth prompted Ayla to hold his remaining hand and let their powers run together freely. The resulting blast was enough to not only knock Mekt off his feet, but completely discharge him (not to mention turn his hair white). Mekt was finally arrested by the S.P., and (after a short stay in hospital) Garth was cleared of all charges.{{issue|date=November 2015}}

While he was recovering from the ordeal, and getting used to his artificial arm, he was contacted by Cosmic Boy, who knew that President Chu was up to something, but he didn't know what and thus had to play along with her wishes (which included keeping Live Wire off the team). Rokk thus had Live Wire put together a secret "Rescue Squad." After recruiting [[Ultra Boy]], [[Element Lad]], [[Laurel Gand|Andromeda]], [[Lar Gand|Valor]] and [[XS (comics)|XS]], they saved the Legion from the [[Fatal Five]]. Both teams then divided into three, and all the heroes combined to have Chu impeached and arrested, and to prevent her (with the Fatal Five's help) from reviving the [[Braal (planet)|Braal]]-[[Titan (moon)|Titan]] War. R.J. Brande was then reluctantly drafted as the new U.P. president, and his first act was to abolish the U.P.-installed membership restrictions on the team, allowing Garth to rejoin.{{issue|date=November 2015}}

Garth was killed during the "Legion Lost" storyline, sacrificing himself in battle with the Progenitor (actually an insane [[Element Lad]]). A few crystals were left from the destruction of the Progenitor, which Kid Quantum took with her upon the Lost Legion's return to the "first" galaxy; she left the crystals on Shanghalla (the heroes' graveyard). It turned out Garth's essence survived in the crystals and Jan's body regrew but with Garth's mind. He was apparently able to use both the Element Lad and Lightning Lad powers in the new crystalline body. His relationship with other Legionnaires, including Saturn Girl, was strained due to his outward  resemblance to the Progenitor.{{issue|date=November 2015}}

In the ''[[Final Crisis]]: [[Legion of 3 Worlds]]'' miniseries, the post-Zero Hour Legion is brought to the pre-crisis Legion's timeline, to help battle [[Superboy Prime]] and the [[Legion of Super-Villains]]. During this time, the pre-crisis [[Brainiac 5]] uses a specially charged lightning rod to increase the transmutation ability of Element Lad's body, allowing Garth to mutate the body itself into a match for his own.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds]]'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Threeboot===
{{Main|Legion of Super-Heroes (2004 team)}}
In the 2005 Waid/Kitson revamp, Garth Ranzz (again as '''Lightning Lad''') remains a charter member of the galactic youth movement the Legion has become. (It is revealed that he coined the first Legion motto—"Eat it, Grandpa!")  He and Saturn Girl share an intimate connection, and Garth notes that one has to be "way honest" to date a telepath. He is protective of his twin, Light Lass, and bears a slight grudge against [[Timber Wolf (comics)|Brin Londo]] for his treatment of Ayla. One of the Legion's fiercest fighters, he almost single-handedly routed the terrorist group Terra Firma in their first skirmish with the Legion. Made acting leader in the wake of the Lemnos crisis, it was Lightning Lad who signed the accord which officially named the Legion as an arm of the United Planets and saved hundreds of Legionnaires from being brutally deported by the Science Police. He is the Legion member who has logged the least time on Earth, tending to prefer exploring space, as if searching for something, revealed to be his older brother, Mekt, who ultimately came to Earth, himself, leading his own super team known as "The Wanderers." This fact, and his almost total dedication to the Legion's cause puts a serious strain on his relationship with Saturn Girl, eventually putting her in [[Ultra Boy|Ultra Boy's]] arms.

===Post-"Infinite Crisis"===
The events of the 2005–2006 "[[Infinite Crisis]]" storyline restored a close analogue of the Pre-"[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]" Legion to continuity, as seen in "[[The Lightning Saga]]" story arc in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' and ''[[Justice Society of America]]'', and in the "[[Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes (comics)|Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes]]" story arc in ''[[Action Comics]]''.  Lightning Lad is included in their number, and is still married to Saturn Girl.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Action Comics]]'' #859. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Garth later escorts Superman back to the present, where the two take to the time to reminisce on certain teenage misadventures in the [[Fortress of Solitude]]. The two are then joined by [[Batman]], who reveals that the bodies of [[Karate Kid (comics)|Karate Kid]] and [[Triplicate Girl|Una]] were found in [[Gotham City]]. Garth and Batman react very hostile towards one another, given Batman's distrust of time travelers. Garth leaves back to the 31st Century with Karate Kid and Una's bodies, but not before giving Superman a new flight ring and giving Batman a veiled warning about [[Batman R.I.P.|upcoming struggles]].&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' #864. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2009 revival of ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' Garth is sent by an imprisoned Mekt to uncover the truth about whether Mekt was in fact a single birth, or whether his suspicions are correct that he does have a twin and that his parents have covered this up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | writer = [[Johns, Geoff]]; [[Shoemaker, Michael]]| artist = [[Henry, Clayton]]| story = Long Live the Legion, Part Two: Lightning Lad | title = [[Adventure Comics]]|issue = 2 | date =November 2009| publisher = DC Comics| page = 29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains to be seen whether he is telling the truth, is lying, or has deluded himself into believing this. If it is true, this revelation would be a significant alteration to the characters' backstory.

==Powers and abilities==
Lightning Lad has the ability to generate electricity within his own body without harming himself.  This electricity he is able to discharge in the form of potent "lightning bolts" (in some undisclosed way his power prevents these bolts from taking the path of least resistance to Earth, such that he is able to target objects with great accuracy). He can also create flashing lettering which can be seen from great distances. He has occasionally displayed a limited control of weather.  In more recent versions of the character, Garth is also able to direct his electric powers internally so as to move at superhuman speed, with his top speed being approximately one-third the speed of light.  Lightning Lad is immune to the harmful effects of electric currents, not only those currents which he himself generates.

As a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] he is provided a [[Legion Flight Ring]]. It allows him to fly and protects him from the vacuum of space and other dangerous environments.{{issue|date=November 2015}}

==In other media==
===Television===
* In ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', Lightning Lad made a cameo background appearance in the episode "New Kids In Town".
* Lightning Lad appeared in an episode of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' titled "Far From Home".
[[Image:lighning lad losh.jpg|175px|thumb|left|Lightning Lad in ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super-Heroes]]'']]
* Lightning Lad is part of the core Legion team in the ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' series, voiced by [[Andy Milder]]. Lightning Lad is the Legion's field leader in this version of the story. Physically he looks almost identical to his earlier comic book counterparts, except for a [[Thunderbolt|lightning bolt]]-shaped scar over his right eye which glows when his powers are activated. He is also portrayed as brash and hot-headed with a somewhat competitive attitude towards Superman, though they seem to develop a closer relationship later on{{Episode needed|date=January 2010}}. The episode "Champions" shows him to be a top "[[Decathlon|dodecathlete]]" in the Intergalactic Games, a sort of future [[Olympic Games|Olympics]]. After Saturn Girl is left in a coma in season 2, he swears revenge on the people who did it to her. In the episode "Chained Lightning," it was revealed that he and his brother Mekt had received their powers during an attack by Lightning Beasts, during which their sister was presumed to have died. Later in that episode, Garth loses his right arm during a battle with his brother when [[Imperiex]] attacked, and gained a new arm called the "Cybernetic 4000" featuring explosive charges and lasers all powered by his own electrical abilities (albeit never seen). It is revealed to the Legion that Ayla had not perished during the Lightning Beast attack as they originally thought, but was instead shifted to another state of being, becoming an energy vortex that Imperiex attempted to tap into in order to power a new weapon. With Mekt's help, Garth was able to restore Ayla back to the way she was before the incident.
[[Image:SmallvilleLighteningLad.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Calum Worthy as Garth Ranzz on ''Smallville'']]
* In the [[The CW Television Network|CW]] series ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', Lightning Lad was portrayed by [[Calum Worthy]]. He first appeared with [[Cosmic Boy]] and [[Saturn Girl]], in the January 15, 2009 episode "[[Smallville (season 8)|Legion]]", marking his first live-action appearance. In the episode, Garth is generally portrayed as an overzealous fan of Clark Kent who initially expresses disappointment in Clark's attitude before Clark rallies them to help him defeat the villain Brainiac. He is the only Legion member to be referred to by his full codename.
* Lightning Lad was mentioned on ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' episode "[[The Flash (season 5)|Nora]]" by Nora West-Allen.

===Film===
* Lightning Lad appears in ''[[Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League: Cosmic Clash]]'', voiced again by Andy Milder. Lightning Lad appears with Saturn Girl and Cosmic Boy as the last surviving members of the Legion of Super Heroes in the year 2116, where Brainiac has taken control over the Earth and Superman. When Batman attempts to free Superman from Brainiac's control and send him back to the present, the Legion attempts to slow down Superman, but are presumably killed by Superman, with Lightning Lad being frozen into a block of ice. This was later revealed to be an illusion cast by Saturn Girl. After Batman succeeds in freeing Superman from Brainiac's control and sending him back to the present, the Legion give Batman their last Time Bubble to send him home.

===Video games===
* In ''[[Injustice 2]]'', Lightning Lad and other members of the Legion of Superheroes are seen in [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]'s ending where [[Brainiac 5]] posed as Brainiac in order to defeat Brainiac. While they grilled him for going back in time to stop Brainiac, they are pleased that he stopped Brainiac's rampage.

[[Image:MarGregorios.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Mar Gregorios Abdal Jaleel]]
'''Mar Gregorios Abdal Jaleel Bawa''' (died 27 April 1681) was a [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] bishop of Jerusalem from 1664 until his death in 1681. He is chiefly remembered for his 1665 mission to [[India]], in which he  re established ties between the  [[Malankara Church]] and the [[Syriac Orthodox]] church. He is venerated as a [[saint]] by his church.

Abdal Jaleel was born in [[Mosul]], [[Iraq]]. In 1654 he was ordained [[metropolitan bishop]] for the Ameed (Diyarbaker) diocese in [[Turkey]] by the Patriarch [[List of Syriac Patriarchs of Antioch from 512 to 1783|Mar Ignatius She'mun]]. In 1664, he was elevated as the Metropolitan of Jerusalem with the title Mor Gregorios. He traveled to [[India]] in 1665 to  the ordination of [[Mar Thoma I]], [[archdeacon]] of the [[Syriac Christian]] community. He was the deligate of Maphriyana/catholicate of Syriac orthodox church to Kerala syrian Christians.
He died in India in 1681, and his remains are interred in the St. Thomas Church at [[North Paravur]]. On April 4, 2000, Patriarch [[Ignatius Zakka I]] declared Mar Gregorios Abdal Jaleel a saint.

==Mission in India==
[[File:Paravur St. Thomas Jacobite Syrian Church.jpg|thumb|Paravur St. Thomas Jacobite Syrian Church which houses the tomb of Mar Gregorios Abdal Jaleel.]]
[[File:Susthathikon of Mar Gregorios Abdul Jaleel, the first Antiochian Bishop to reach Malankara.jpg|thumb|Susthathikon of Mar Gregorios Abdal Jaleel.]]

Thomas Christians are popularly and traditionally called as ''Syriac Christians'', a term associated with their use of liturgical rites of [[Syriac Christianity]]. The name ''Syriac'' came to refer to those Christians that were using various Syriac Rites at the very beginning of Christianity. The ''Syrian Christian'' label was also attached to the Churches in Syria, which was submitted to the ecclesiastical authority of the Church of Antioch in the ancient capital of [[Roman Syria]]. It was referred to as the ''Syrian Church'' in the epistle of St. Ignatius (the third Patriarch of Antioch), to the Romans in AD 107.

The Saint Thomas Christians were in communion with the [[Church of the East]] until their encounter with the Portuguese in 1599.&lt;ref&gt;I. Gillman and H.-J. Klimkeit, ''Christians in Asia Before 1500'', (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1999), p. 177.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; There after the Christians of St Thomas had been influenced by many belief streams at different points of time. These influences have later resulted in serious rifts and in the breaking down of the monolithic apostolic church to different fragments under different faith stream. They were organised as a Church in the 8th century, served by foreign bishops and with  a hereditary local chief called Arkadiyokon or [[Archdeacon]]. In the 16th century the overtures of the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] ''[[padroado]]'' to bring the Saint Thomas Christians into the [[Catholic Church]] led to the first of several rifts in the community and the establishment of [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Malankara Church]] factions.Since that time further splits have occurred, and the Saint Thomas Christians are now divided into several [[Eastern Catholic]], [[Oriental Orthodox]], and independent bodies, each with their own liturgies and traditions.

After the [[Coonen Cross Oath]] incident, [[Mar Thoma I|Archdeacon Thomas]] was ordained as bishop by the laying on of hands by twelve priests. This was considered necessary in view of the extraordinary circumstances. Appeals were sent to various Eastern Christian centers and Mor Gregorios Abdul Jaleel Bawa of Jerusalem was the first to respond.

Mor Gregorios reached Ponnani, then an important port on the south Western coast of India, in 1665. The 'Travancore State Manual' Vol II Page 187, records the arrival of Mor Gregorios as follows - "Two years afterwards, in 1665, the position of the Archdeacon Thomas altered by the arrival on this coast of a Bishop named Gregory, Patriarch of Jerusalem sent by the Jacobite Patriarch of Antioch Ignatius XXIII the quarter whence had come [[Ahathalla]], thirteen years previously".

Knowing the prevailing political climate, he traveled further south by land in disguise until he came across some Syriac Rite Christians from the North Paravur church. He revealed his identity showing them the 'Sthathikon' from the Patriarch of Antioch. They led him to their church and sent word to others. The Archdeacon and many people rushed to the place to welcome the Bawa. Soon after, Mor Gregorios canonically ordained the Archdeacon as Metropolitan [[Mar Thoma I]]. Together, they traveled to various churches affirming the Orthodox faith and traditions. In 1670 March Gregorios and Mar Thoma I together ordained [[Mar Thoma II]] as the second [[Malankara Metropolitan|Malankara]] Metropolitan.

An important encyclical by Mor Gregorios dated 5th Kumbam 1668 gives us a record of the Malankara Church during the period. Referring to the [[Synod of Diamper]], it says "Most of the early records on the faith and history of the Malankara Church prior to the arrival of Portuguese were destroyed in the aftermaths of the Synod of Diamper. They did this in order to establish a new chapter in Malankara. The ultimate aim of the Synod was to transform the Syriac Rite Christians into the Roman Catholic fold by use of force and in this process, they managed to destroy all the earlier records. The support of Portuguese military and the local Kings made their task much easier."&lt;ref&gt;Extracts from this encyclical were later published in the book E M Philipose, ''Indian Church of St.Thomas'', 1907. The original is preserved at the Kottayam Valiyapally.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregorios died on 27 April 1681 (M.E. 857 Medom 14th, Friday). It is said{{by whom|date=January 2013}} that he knew beforehand the exact hour of his demise. In accordance with his instructions, he was dressed in the pontifical habits with cross and staff in hand and taken to the church seated in a chair. A large number of people gathered at the church and, as he died, it was reported that the people witnessed a bright glow inside and outside the church and several other miraculous signs.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} His mortal remains were interred in the 'Hykala' of the St. Thomas Church at North Paravur which has since become a pilgrimage centre.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

On April 4, 2000, Patriarch Ignatius Zakka I of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] declared Gregorios Abdal Jaleel a saint.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} On 7 February 2006, the Patriarch issued a decree authorizing the recital of the name of Mor Gregorios Abdel`Jaleel in the Fifth 'TUBDEN' (diptych).{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

== Relics ==
[[File:First Antiochian Bishop to reach Malankara Mar Gregorios Abdul Jaleel's Tomb in Paravur Church.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Mar Gregorios Abdal Jaleel inside St. Thomas Jacobite Syrian Church, North Paravur.]]
The relics of Mor Gregorios is preserved at St. Thomas Church, North Paravur which include his vestments, a golden cross, a golden chalice, paten set and an ''arulikka'' worn by Mor Gregorios. The holy 'Arulikka' has 12 partitions of which 11 contain the relics of saints and the twelfth partition in the middle contains a piece of the cross on which Christ was crucified. The Chalice and Platen are still used in the Holy Qurbana celebrated on the feast of Mor Gregorios. The relics are ceremoniously taken out and exhibited for public veneration on the feast day.

==Feast==
The Perunal (Malayalam) or Dhukrono (Syriac) of Mor Gregorios Bava is celebrated for 4 days starting from 24 April every year and culminating on the 27th. During these days, the North Paravur is declared as a festival area by the Kerala government considering the large flow of pilgrims. Thousands of pilgrims from different parts of Kerala, mostly from the northern part of Malankara, travel by foot covering many miles to reach the tomb every year.

The Feast of Mor Gregorios Abdal Jaleel is also celebrated at Elanjikal Palli in Niranam on 28 April.

'''Halle Tanner Dillon Johnson''' (1864 – 26 April 1901) was an [[United States|American]] [[physician]] who in 1891 became the first female [[African-American]] doctor in [[Alabama]].

==Biography==

===Early years===
Johnson was born '''Halle Tanner''' in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], the oldest daughter of nine children to Benjamin Tucker and Sarah Elizabeth Tanner. Johnson was well educated and as a young girl became familiar with the work of prominent African-American intellectuals. She worked with her father on ''[[The Christian Recorder]]'', a publication of the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]], where he ministered.

In 1886, Johnson married Charles Dillon and the couple had a child before her husband's sudden death. A widow at 24, Johnson returned to live with her family and decided to enter medical school. After three years of study at the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania, she earned her M.D. in 1891, graduating with honors.

Around the time of her graduation, African-American educator [[Booker T. Washington]], founder of the [[Tuskegee Institute]] in [[Alabama]], had written to the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania to request a nomination for a teaching position he had been struggling to fill for four years. He hoped to find an African-American physician to serve the school and its surrounding community. Johnson accepted Washington's offer of [[United States dollar|US$]]600 a month, including lodging and meals, and arrived to begin her service in August 1891.

===Career===
Before beginning her new job, however, young Dr. Dillon had to face a significant obstacle: passing the Alabama State Medical Examination. The very fact that she was sitting for the examination caused a public stir in [[Montgomery, Alabama]]. She spent ten days taking the exam, addressing a different area of medicine each day. Her examiners included the directors and leading figures of most of the state's major medical institutions. Dillon impressed them with her responses and she passed the test.

Dr. Dillon was the first woman to practice medicine in the state of Alabama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Birmingham Museum of Art | title = Birmingham Museum of Art: A Guide to the Collection | publisher = Giles | year = 2010 | location = London | pages = 139 | url = http://www.birminghammuseumstore.org/bmapu.html | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | isbn = 978-1-904832-77-5 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110910171150/http://www.birminghammuseumstore.org/bmapu.html | archivedate = 2011-09-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her brief tenure at Tuskegee, she was responsible for the health care of the school's 450 students and 30 faculty and staff. She also established a training school for nurses and founded the [[Lafayette Dispensary]] to serve the health care needs of local residents, often mixing medicines herself for their use. She also taught two classes each day.

===Personal life===
Johnson's tenure at Tuskegee ended in 1894 when she married the Reverend John Quincy Johnson, an African Methodist Episcopal minister and math instructor at Tuskegee. The couple moved first to [[Columbia, South Carolina]], where Reverend Johnson became president of [[Allen University]], a private school for black students. They later moved from [[Hartford, Connecticut]] to [[Atlanta, Georgia]], and then to [[Princeton, New Jersey]], as Reverend Johnson pursued undergraduate and graduate degrees in [[theology]]. Finally, in 1900, the couple settled in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] with their three children and Reverend Johnson became the pastor of Saint Paul A.M.E. Church. Halle Johnson died in Nashville from complications during childbirth.

[[File:Hanns Bolz.jpg|thumb|200px|Self-portrait (1910)]]
'''Hanns Bolz''' (22 January 1885, [[Aachen]] - 4 July 1918, [[Munich]]) was a German painter, illustrator and sculptor. He worked in the [[Expressionist]] and [[Cubo-Futurist]] styles.

== Biography ==
After studying in Aachen and Cologne, he attended the [[Kunstakademie Düsseldorf]] from 1905 to 1908. He then spent three years in Paris, where he rented a studio in [[Montmartre]] that had previously been occupied by [[Pablo Picasso]]. He became an habitué of [[Le Dôme Café]], where he became acquainted with [[Hans Purrmann]], [[Rudolf Levy]] and, most importantly, [[Alfred Flechtheim]], who would serve as his agent for the rest of his brief career.

From 1911 to 1912, he lived in Munich, working as an illustrator for the magazine ''Komet''. While there, he met [[Franz Marc]] and became associated with the painters of the [[Der Blaue Reiter]]. Apparently restless there, he returned to Paris and rented another studio; this time in [[Montparnasse]]. He also travelled extensively, visiting Madrid, London, Venice and Oslo.

In 1914, he was drafted for military service and sent to the front. While there, he was involved in a poison gas attack that left him nearly blind and he was mustered out of service in 1917. From that time on, he concentrated on sculpting, as the tactile element compensated for his lost vision to some extent. 

At this time, he was living with [[Otto Freundlich]], at his studio in Cologne. Later, he returned to Munich, but became ill and had to be admitted to a hospital where he died of complications from his war injuries.

'''James Harold''' "'''Harry'''" '''Chatton''' (born 23 April 1899 in [[Enniskillen]], [[County Fermanagh]], Ireland), commonly referred to as '''Harry Chatton''', was an Irish [[association football|footballer]] who played for several clubs in the [[Scottish Football League|Scottish League]], the [[American Soccer League (1921-1933)|American Soccer League]] and the [[League of Ireland]]. Chatton was a [[dual Irish international footballers|dual internationalist]] and played for both Ireland teams – the [[Ireland national football team (IFA)|IFA XI]] and the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|FAI XI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/double-caps.html|title=Players Appearing for Two or More Countries|accessdate=9 July 2014|publisher=RSSSF}}&lt;/ref&gt; His date and place of death are unknown.

==Club career==
After playing with [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]] and [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]] in the [[Scottish Football League|Scottish League]], Chatton joined [[Indiana Flooring]] of the [[American Soccer League (1921-1933)|American Soccer League]] in 1926. At the end of the 1926–27 season, he and team mate [[Alec Donald]] broke their contracts with Flooring and returned to Scotland to sign with [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]]. The ASL, through the [[United States Football Association]], immediately contested Chatton's contract with Hearts resulting in [[FIFA]] voiding the contract. As a result Chatton returned to Flooring, now known as the [[New York Nationals (ASL)|New York Nationals]].&lt;ref name="Colin"&gt;{{cite book | last = Jose | first = Colin | title = American Soccer League, 1921–1931 | type = Hardback | publisher = The Scarecrow Press | year = 1998 | id = ({{ISBN|0-8108-3429-4}}) }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chatton subsequently helped the Nationals win the [[1928 National Challenge Cup]], beating Chicago's [[Bricklayers and Masons F.C.]] 4–1 on aggregate in the final.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesu/usacuphist.html#det  U.S. Open Cup at RSSSF]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1929, the Nationals also won the Lewis Cup, the ASL league cup, defeating the [[New Bedford Whalers]] over three games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sover.net/~spectrum/year/1929.html American Soccer – 1929]&lt;/ref&gt; That January, [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] again attempted to induce Chatton to move to Scotland, but he declined and played one more season in the ASL.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} On 25 May 1930 at the [[Polo Grounds]], Chatton played for the Nationals in a friendly against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], the reigning [[Scottish football champions|Scottish champions]]. Nationals lost this game 5–4.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Among Chatton's team mates at the Nationals were [[Jimmy Douglas (American soccer)|Jimmy Douglas]], [[Jimmy Gallagher]], [[Bart McGhee]] and [[Robert Millar (soccer)|Robert Millar]]. The former three all played for the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] at the [[1930 FIFA World Cup squads|1930 World Cup]] while Millar was the team coach. After four years in the ASL, Chatton returned to Ireland and joined [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]], helping them win the [[League of Ireland]] title in 1931. He then had two further seasons with [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Emms | first1 = Steve | last2 = Wells |first2 = Richard | title = Scottish League Players' Records Division One 1890/91 to 1938/39 | publisher = Tony Brown | year = 2007 | location = Beeston, Nottingham  | isbn = 978-1-899468-66-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; before joining [[Cork F.C.]], who he helped win the [[FAI Cup]] in 1934.

==Irish international==
During the years Chatton played international football, there were, in effect, two Ireland teams, chosen by two rival associations. Both associations, the [[Northern Ireland]] – based [[Irish Football Association|IFA]] and the [[Irish Free State]] – based [[Football Association of Ireland|FAI]] claimed jurisdiction over the whole of Ireland and selected players from the whole island. As a result several notable Irish players from this era, including Chatton, played for both teams.

===IFA XI===
Between 1924 and 1925, while playing for [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]], Chatton played 3 times for the [[Ireland national football team (IFA)|IFA XI]]. He made his international debut on 22 October 1924 against [[England national football team|England]] in 3–1 defeat at [[Goodison Park]]. He won his second cap for the IFA, against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in 3–0 defeat on 28 February 1925 at [[Windsor Park]]. He made his final appearance for the IFA XI in a 0–0 draw with England on 24 October 1925, again at Windsor Park. His team mates while playing for the IFA XI included, among others, [[Tom Farquharson]], [[Mick O'Brien (1893-1940)|Mick O'Brien]], [[Bill Lacey (footballer)|Bill Lacey]], [[Elisha Scott]] and [[Billy Gillespie]].

&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/scot-intres1939.html  Scotland results at Rsssf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===FAI XI===
Between 1931 and 1934 Chatton also played 3 times for the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|FAI XI]]. He won each of his three FAI caps while playing for three different clubs – [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]],
&lt;ref&gt;[http://planet_shels.tripod.com/history/internationalcaps.html  Shelbourne internationals]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]] and [[Cork F.C.]]. Chatton made his debut for the FAI XI against [[Spain national football team|Spain]] on 26 April 1931. He helped a team that also included [[Tom Farquharson]], [[Peter Kavanagh (Irish footballer)|Peter Kavanagh]] and [[Paddy Moore]], gain a respectable 1–1 draw at the [[Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys|Montjuic Stadium]] in Barcelona. On 13 December 1931 at [[Dalymount Park]] he then captained the FAI XI in the return game against Spain; this time, however, his team lost 5–0. He made his third and final appearance for the FAI XI against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] on 8 April 1934 in a [[1934 FIFA World Cup qualification|World Cup qualifier]] which ended in a 5–2 defeat.

'''Jerome Irving Rodale''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|oʊ|d|eɪ|l}};&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgQ9dBZgJxM "How J.I. Rodale Started Organic Gardening Magazine - Story told by Patricia Bragg - Interview 1/12"]&lt;!--at 2:40--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; August 16, 1898 – June 8, 1971) was a publisher, editor, author, playwright, and founder of [[Rodale, Inc.]]

Rodale was an early advocate of [[sustainable agriculture]] and [[organic farming]] in the United States. As an author, his work included several magazines and books, including books featuring different authors, on the subject of health. He popularized the term "organic" as a term for growing food without pesticides. Rodale also published works on other topics, including ''The Synonym Finder''.

Rodale died after suffering a fatal heart attack on-camera. While appearing as a guest on a segment of ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'', that subsequently never aired, he slumped back in his seat and became unresponsive. He was taken to [[St. Luke's–Roosevelt Hospital Center|Roosevelt Hospital Center]] and was pronounced dead on arrival at the age of 72.

==Biography==
Rodale was born in [[Manhattan]] on August 16, 1898, the son of a grocer, and raised on the [[Lower East Side]]. His birth name was Cohen, but presuming it would be a handicap in business, he changed it to a non-Jewish-sounding one.  He worked as an accountant for New York City 1917-1920, and worked for the Internal Revenue Service 1920-21.  His brother Joseph and he co-founded Rodale Manufacturing, a maker of electrical equipment, in New York in 1923.&lt;ref name=cyclopedia&gt;{{cite book|title=The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography|date=1967|publisher=James T.

To improve his health, he read the works of [[Bernarr Macfadden]]&lt;ref name="Robert"&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Rodale interview Part 1|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqWtlc06_hI|website=YouTube|publisher=Alternative Farming Systems Information Center|accessdate=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and invented an exercising device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Physical-exercising device (Patent US1707449)|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US1707449|publisher=US Patent Office|accessdate=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Rodale brothers moved Rodale Manufacturing to [[Emmaus, Pennsylvania]], in 1930 to cut costs during the Depression.  He founded Rodale Press in 1930, marketing books and magazines. Inspired by his encounter with the ideas of [[Albert Howard]], Rodale developed an interest in promoting a healthy and active lifestyle that emphasized organically grown foods, and established the [[Rodale Organic Gardening Experimental Farm]] in 1940.&lt;ref name=rodale&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rodale.com/1,6597,1-101,00.html |title= Rodale: Brief History |accessdate=2007-08-26 |quote=On September 20, 1990, Bob Rodale was killed in a traffic accident in Russia.

''Organic Farming and Gardening'' promotes [[organic horticulture]]; later, the magazine was retitled ''Organic Gardening''. To Rodale, [[agriculture]] and health were inseparable. Healthy soil required [[compost]] and eschewing [[pesticides]] and synthetic [[fertilizers]]. Eating plants grown in such soil would then help humans stay healthier, he expounded.

One of Rodale's most successful projects was ''[[Prevention (magazine)|Prevention]]'' magazine, founded in 1950, which promotes practices preventing disease rather than trying to cure it later.&lt;ref name=rodale/&gt; It pioneered the return to whole grains, unrefined sweets, using little fat in food preparation, seldom eating animal products, folk cures, herbal medicines, and breastfeeding. It also promoted the consumption of higher than typical amounts of nutritional supplements and forgoing nicotine and caffeine.

Rodale was also a playwright, operating the Cecilwood Theater in [[Fishkill, New York]], and the [[off-Broadway]] Rodale Theater at 62 East Fourth Street in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]. Rodale's plays included ''Toinette'' (1961) and ''The Hairy Falsetto'' (1964).&lt;ref name=cyclopedia/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Louis |last=Calta |authorlink= |title=Rodale Will Open Intimate Theatre.

==Death==
Rodale died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at the age of 72 while participating as a guest on an early-evening taping of ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'' slated to be aired that same night, Tuesday, June 8, 1971.  Rodale was still on stage, having finished his interview, and was seated on a couch next to the active interviewee, ''[[New York Post]]'' columnist [[Pete Hamill]].  Rodale had stated during his just-completed interview on the show, "I'm in such good health that I fell down a long flight of stairs yesterday and I laughed all the way", "I've decided to live to be a hundred", and "I never felt better in my life!"&lt;ref name="cavett" /&gt; He had also previously said, "I'm going to live to be 100, unless I'm run down by some sugar-crazed taxi driver."&lt;ref name=guru&gt;{{cite news |first=Wade |last= Greene|authorlink=  |title=Guru of the Organic Food Cult |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/06/06/archives/guru-of-the-organic-food-cult-guru-of-the-organic-food-cult.html |quote= 'I'm going to live to be 100,' says the author of ''Natural Health, Sugar and the Criminal Mind,'' 'unless I'm run down by a sugar-crazed taxi driver.' ... |work=[[New York Times Magazine]] |date=June 6, 1971|accessdate=2007-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Harden |authorlink= |title=Lights Off, Pounds Off ... |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&amp;dat=20030723&amp;id=LpoNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0XADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4930,610168 |quote= Organic-food crusader Jerome Rodale once boasted, "I will live to be 100 unless I'm run down by a sugar-crazed taxi driver." ... |publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |date=July 23, 2003|page=C2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Dick Cavett]], Hamill noticed something was wrong with Rodale, leaned over to Cavett, and said, "This looks bad." According to others, Cavett asked, "Are we boring you, Mr. Rodale?" Cavett himself said that he "emphatically" did not recall saying this, but one of the two physicians in the audience did remember this. The physicians (an internist and orthopedic surgeon, both in residency) rushed onto the stage to try to revive Rodale with cardiopulmonary resuscitation, including mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. (During an appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' that originally aired on February 5, 1982, Cavett stated "firefighters from across the street" also attended the patient.) Although an electrocardiogram continued to show cardiac activity, they were unsuccessful; Rodale was pronounced dead on arrival at [[Roosevelt Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frater|first=Jamie|title= Listverse.Com's Ultimate Book of Bizarre Lists|year=2010|publisher=Ulysses Press|location=Canada|isbn= 9781569758175|page=400}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric White, MD, was one of the physicians present.&lt;/ref&gt; The episode was never broadcast, although Cavett has described the story in public appearances and on his blog.&lt;ref name="cavett"&gt;{{cite news |first= Dick|last= Cavett|authorlink= |title=When That Guy Died on My Show |url=http://cavett.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/05/03/when-that-guy-died-on-my-show/ |quote=I brought out the next guest, [[Pete Hamill]], whose column ran in the ''[[New York Post]]''. Rodale moved 'down one' to the couch. As Pete and I began to chat, Mr.&amp;nbsp;Rodale suddenly made a snoring sound, which got a laugh. Comics would sometimes do that for a laugh while another comic was talking, pretending boredom. His head tilted to the side as Pete, in closeup as it happened, whispered audibly, 'This looks bad.' The audience laughed at that. I didn't, because I knew Rodale was dead. To this day, I don't know how I knew. I thought, 'Good God, I'm in charge here. What do I do?' Next thing I knew I was holding his wrist, thinking, I don't know anything about what a wrist is supposed to feel like. |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=May 3, 2007 |accessdate=2018-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
After Rodale's death, his son [[Robert Rodale]] ran the publishing firm until his own death in a car accident in 1990.&lt;ref name=rodale/&gt; That work included editing the high-circulation ''Prevention'' magazine. Robert Rodale had competed in the Olympics in rifle shooting and was inducted into the [[United States Bicycling Hall of Fame]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Glenn|last= Fowler|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Robert Rodale, 60, Dies in Crash.

Rodale's granddaughter [[Maria Rodale]] became chairman and CEO of Rodale, Inc. She attributes her interest in the organic food movement to growing up on America's first certified organic farm.&lt;ref name="Maria"&gt;[http://www.mariasfarmcountrykitchen.com/about/ Maria's Farm Country Kitchen]&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 2017 New York media giant Hearst Corp. announced it will acquire the magazine and book businesses of the 90-year-old Rodale Inc. for an undisclosed price.

Until 1506 he resided at [[Vendôme]] where he participated in the building of the [[Trinity Abbey, Vendôme|Trinity Abbey]].

In 1506, he was commissioned to rebuild the northern bell tower of the [[Chartres Cathedral]]&lt;ref name="Archives"&gt;{{Cite web

'''Jiggs II''' (September 22, 1925 – March 30, 1937), also known as '''Silent White Richard''', was the second of a number of [[English Bulldog]]s to serve as mascots of the [[United States Marine Corps]]. He succeeded the original mascot, Jiggs, following that dog's death in 1927. A champion of the Westminster Dog Show, Jiggs II died in 1937 and was buried with full military honors at Marine Corps Base Quantico.

==Early life and family==
Jiggs II was whelped in [[Huntington, New York]] as Silent White Richard, the son of the champion show dog Silent White Duke, his father described by the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' as "one of the best-blooded English Bulldogs in America".&lt;ref name="bg"&gt;{{cite news |title=Jiggs II is Having Pretty Soft Time with Marines |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/430953529 |accessdate=November 30, 2018 |work=[[Boston Globe]] |date=April 9, 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="akg"/&gt;{{efn|Following death, Silent White Duke's body was donated to the [[American Museum of Natural History]].&lt;ref name="akg"/&gt;}} He was almost entirely white with brindle markings on his face and tail.&lt;ref name="akg"/&gt; 
[[File:Smedley Butler with Bulldogs, 1930 (9451129397).jpg|thumb|left|Jiggs II (foreground right) pictured with [[Smedley Butler]], Bill, and Sergeant Thunder, in 1930.]]

==Career==
Silent White Richard won a blue ribbon at the 1926 [[Westminster Dog Show]].&lt;ref name="akg"/&gt;

The following year, he was presented to the United States Marine Corps by his owner, heavyweight boxing champion [[Gene Tunney]] – himself a former Marine – after Tunney learned of the death of Marine mascot Jiggs in January of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jiggs |url=https://www.mca-marines.org/leatherneck/1927/05/jiggs-ii |accessdate=November 30, 2018 |work=Leatherneck |date=May 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kramer |first1=Jeffrey |title=The Stories Behind 6 of the USMC’s Bulldog Mascots |url=https://www.navalhistory.org/2018/06/27/the-stories-behind-6-of-the-usmcs-bulldog-mascots |accessdate=November 30, 2018 |work=Naval History Blog |publisher=[[U.S. Naval Institute]] |date=June 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was formally accepted by the Marine Corps on March 27, 1927 and subsequently renamed Jiggs II.&lt;ref name="akg"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Proctor |first1=Clarance |title=Devil Dogs Have Always Owned Many Great Dogs as Mascots |work=American Kennel Gazette |date=December 1, 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his donation, Jiggs II was 17 months old, stood 15 inches high, and weighed 47 pounds.&lt;ref name="akg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bg"/&gt; 

Some months after Tunney donated Jiggs II, the dog was temporarily transferred back to the boxer to serve as mascot at his Chicago training camp before being returned to Marine service.&lt;ref name="akg"/&gt; 

In 1930, Jiggs II made another appearance at the Westminster Dog Show as a non-competing guest.&lt;ref name="akg"/&gt; He was named by the show "Honorary Champion".&lt;ref name="akg"/&gt;

During his career Jiggs II was posted to [[Marine Barracks Washington]], [[Marine Corps Base Quantico]], and [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tunney Scans Service Record of Marine Mascot, Jiggs II |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/301923885 |accessdate=November 30, 2018 |work=[[Miami News]] |date=March 4, 1928}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notionally enlisted as a private, he was subsequently advanced to [[sergeant major]].&lt;ref name="es"/&gt; He briefly served alongside Private Pagett (registered in pedigree under the name Pride of Field), an English Bulldog donated by the [[Corps of Royal Marines]] to the U.S. Marine Corps in 1927.&lt;ref name="akg"/&gt;{{efn|Private Pagett, who was known to have an unpleasant disposition and was prone to biting and chasing, died in 1928 due to heat exhaustion. His date of death and aggressive mannerisms have been frequently, erroneously attributed to Jiggs II.&lt;ref name="akg"/&gt;}}

==Personal life==
Early in his military career, the ''Boston Globe'' described Jiggs II as "ferocious looking" but with a "mild manner and gentle disposition".&lt;ref name="bg"/&gt; Writing in a 1937 issue of ''American Kennel Gazette'', then retired Sergeant Major Clarance Proctor affirmed this description of Jiggs II.&lt;ref name="akg"/&gt;

Jiggs II died in 1937 and was buried in [[Quantico, Virginia]] with full military honors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Favorite Mascots of U.S. Marines are Dogs |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/358988391 |accessdate=November 30, 2018 |work=Wilmington Daily Press Journal |date=May 11, 1937}}{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="es"&gt;{{cite news |title=Marines Arrange Mascot's Funeral |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/369730343 |accessdate=November 30, 2018 |work=Evening Sun |date=March 31, 1937}}{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jumbo''' (about Christmas 1860 – September 15, 1885), also known as '''Jumbo the Elephant''' and '''Jumbo the Circus Elephant''', was a 19th-century male [[African bush elephant]] born in [[Sudan]]. Jumbo was exported to [[Jardin des Plantes]], a zoo in [[Paris]], and then transferred in 1865 to [[London Zoo]] in England. Despite public protest, Jumbo was sold to [[P. T. Barnum]], who took him to the United States for exhibition in March 1882.

The giant elephant's name has spawned the common word, "[[wiktionary:jumbo|jumbo]]", meaning large in size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jumbo (''adj.'')|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=jumbo|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|accessdate=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jumbo's shoulder height has been estimated to be {{convert|3.23|m|ft|1}} at the time of his death,&lt;ref name=probos_mass/&gt; and was claimed to be about {{convert|4|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} by Barnum.

Jumbo is the [[Tufts University#Athletics|Tufts University mascot]],&lt;ref name="Tufts-mascot"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jumbo the Elephant, Tufts' Mascot|url=http://www.tufts.edu/home/get_to_know_tufts/history/jumbo/|publisher=[[Tufts University]]|accessdate=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is referenced by a plaque outside the old Liberal Hall, now a [[Wetherspoons]] pub, in [[Crediton]].&lt;ref name="Chambers(2008)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chambers|first=Paul|title=Jumbo the greatest elephant in the world|year=2008|publisher=Steerforth Press|location=Hanover, N.H.|isbn=1586421530|page=PT14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2WkXkdmLGNoC&amp;pg=PT14&amp;lpg=PT14#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=1st US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Jumbo was born around Christmas 1860 in [[Sudan]], and after his mother was killed by hunters, the infant Jumbo was captured by Sudanese elephant hunter Taher Sheriff.&lt;ref name="Chambers(2008)"/&gt; The calf was sold to Lorenzo Casanova, an Italian animal dealer and explorer. Casanova transported the animals that he had bought from Sudan north to [[Suez]], and then across the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to [[Trieste]].

This collection was sold to Gottlieb Christian Kreutzberg's "Menagerie Kreutzberg"&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Gottlieb Christian Kreutzberg]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=February 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Menagerie_Kreutzberg|title=Menagerie Kreutzberg - Wikimedia Commons|website=commons.wikimedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Germany.&lt;ref name=St.Thomas&gt;{{cite web|title=The Life of Jumbo the Elephant|url=https://stthomaspubliclibrary.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Jumbo-March-2014.pdf|publisher=St. Thomas Public Library|accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, the elephant was imported to France and kept in the Paris zoo [[Jardin des Plantes]]. In 1865, he was transferred to the [[London Zoo]], arriving on 26 June,&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; and became famous for giving rides to visitors, especially children. London zookeeper association leader Anoshan Anathajeyasri gave Jumbo his name; it is likely a variation of one of two [[Swahili language|Swahili]] words: ''[[wikt:jambo|jambo]]'', which means "hello"; or ''jumbe'', meaning "chief".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swahili-English translation for "jumbe"|url=http://en.bab.la/dictionary/swahili-english/jumbe|publisher=bab.la Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Anathajeyasri was from India, he possibly named Jumbo after a gigantic rose-apple tree called ''jambu'' (which at that time would be transliterated as 'jumboo'), which grows on the mythical [[Mount Meru]] and whose fruits were said to be as large as elephants.

While in London, Jumbo broke both tusks, and when they regrew, he ground them down against the stonework of his enclosure.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; His keeper in London was Matthew Scott, whose 1885 autobiography details his life with Jumbo.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

Jumbo was sold in February 1882 to the [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus|Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]] for £2,000.&lt;ref name=St.Thomas/&gt; Popular objection occurred when Barnum's proposal became known; 100,000 school children wrote to [[Queen Victoria]] begging her not to sell the elephant.{{efn|''The Elephant War'' (1960) by [[Gillian Avery]] is a historical novel featuring the protest movement based in Oxford.}} [[John Ruskin]], a fellow of the [[Zoological Society of London|Zoological Society]], wrote in ''[[The Morning Post]]'' in February 1882:
"I, for one of the said fellows, am not in the habit of selling my old pets or parting with my old servants because I find them subject occasionally, perhaps even "periodically," to fits of ill temper; and I not only "regret" the proceedings of the council, but disclaim them utterly, as disgraceful to the city of London and dishonourable to common humanity."&lt;ref&gt;Complete works of John Ruskin, Vol 34 Page 560.http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/depts/ruskinlib/stormcloud and http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/depts/ruskinlib/Works%20of%20John%20Ruskin&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a lawsuit against the Zoological Gardens alleging the sale was in violation of multiple zoo bylaws, and the zoo's attempt to renege on the sale, the court upheld the sale and Barnum refused to sell Jumbo back.&lt;ref name=St.Thomas/&gt; Matthew Scott elected to go with Jumbo to the USA.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

In New York, Barnum exhibited Jumbo at [[Madison Square Garden (1879)|Madison Square Garden]], earning enough in three weeks from the enormous crowds to recoup the money he spent to buy the animal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hockey.ballparks.com/NHL/NewYorkRangers/1stoldindex.htm "Madison Square Garden I"] on Ballpark.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=St.Thomas/&gt;  In the 31-week season, the circus earned $1.75M, largely due to its star attraction.&lt;ref name=St.Thomas/&gt; On 30 May 1884, Jumbo was one of Barnum's 21 elephants that crossed the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] to prove that it was safe after 12 people died during a stampede caused by mass panic over collapse fears a year earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=McCullough|first=David| title=The Great Bridge: the epic story of the building of the Brooklyn Bridge |date=2012 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |location=London|isbn=1451683235 | pages=431, 543 | url= |edition=Updated}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jumbo died at a railway [[classification yard]] in Canada at [[St. Thomas, Ontario]] on September 15, 1885. In those days the circus crisscrossed North America by train. St. Thomas was the perfect location for a circus because many rail lines converged there. Jumbo and the other animals had finished their performances that night, and as they were being led to their box car, a train came down the track. Jumbo was hit and mortally wounded, dying within minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Friday January 5, 2018 Full Text Transcript|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-january-05-2018-1.4473373/friday-january-5-2018-full-text-transcript-1.4475448#segment2|work=CBC Radio|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=David Suzuki|title=Jumbo: The Life Of An Elephant Superstar|url=http://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/episodes/jumbo-the-life-of-an-elephant-superstar|agency=CBC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tufts Magazine, Spring, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Susan Wilson|date=Spring 2002|title=An Elephant's Tale|url=http://www.tufts.edu/alumni/magazine/spring2002/jumbo.html|journal=[[Tufts Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnum told the story that Tom Thumb, a young circus elephant, was walking on the railroad tracks and Jumbo was attempting to lead him to safety. Barnum claimed that the locomotive hit and killed Tom Thumb before it derailed and hit Jumbo. However, other witnesses did not support Barnum's account. According to newspapers, the freight train hit Jumbo directly, killing him, while Tom Thumb suffered a broken leg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/travel/2010/09/08/jumbo_the_elephant_leaves_a_big_legend_in_southern_ontario.html|title=Jumbo the elephant leaves a big legend in southern Ontario|last=Brennan|first=Pat|date=2010-09-08|work=The Toronto Star|access-date=2018-01-23|language=en-CA|issn=0319-0781}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Jumbo's Death", ''[[The Globe (Toronto newspaper)|The Globe]]'', September 17, 1885, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many metallic objects were found in the elephant's stomach, including [[History of the British penny (1714–1901)|English pennies]], keys, rivets, and a [[police whistle]].{{efn|"A postmortem revealed his stomach to contain 'a hat-full' of English pennies, gold and silver coins, stones, a bunch of keys, lead seals from railway trucks, trinkets of metal and glass, screws, rivets, pieces of wire and a police whistle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meredith|first=Martin|title=Elephant Destiny: Biography of an Endangered Species in Africa|year=2009|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=0786728388|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TYtYbS7QA7MC&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;dq=jumbo%20elephant%20metal%20stomach&amp;pg=PA117#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 January 2013|page=117|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ever the showman, Barnum had portions of his star attraction separated, to have multiple sites attracting curious spectators. After touring with Barnum's circus,&lt;ref name=rochester&gt;{{cite web|title=Jumbo: From Our Special Collections|url=http://www.lib.rochester.edu/index.cfm?PAGE=3599|publisher=University of Rochester Libraries|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the skeleton was donated to the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in [[New York City]], where it remains.&lt;ref name = "Immolation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/22/arts/barnum-s-jumbo-is-back-in-museum-s-center-ring.html | title=Barnum's Jumbo Is Back In Museum's Center Ring | first=Glenn | last=Collins | date=22 January 1993 | newspaper=[[New York Times]] | accessdate=10 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The elephant's heart was sold to [[Cornell University]].  Jumbo's hide was stuffed by William J. Critchley and [[Carl Akeley]], both of [[Ward's Natural Science]], who stretched it during the mounting process; the mounted specimen traveled with Barnum's circus for two years.&lt;ref name=rochester /&gt;

Barnum eventually donated the stuffed Jumbo to [[Tufts University]], where it was displayed at [[Barnum Museum of Natural History|P.T. Barnum Hall]] there for many years. The hide was destroyed in a fire in April 1975.&lt;ref name = "Immolation" /&gt; Ashes from that fire, which are believed to contain the elephant's remains, are kept in a 14-ounce [[Peter Pan (peanut butter)|Peter Pan Crunchy Peanut Butter]] jar in the office of the Tufts athletic director, while his taxidermied tail, removed during earlier renovations, resides in the holdings of the Tufts Digital Collections and Archives.&lt;ref name="Tufts Magazine, Spring, 2002"/&gt;

==Legacy==

Remaining in the United Kingdom are statues and other memorabilia of Jumbo. The elephant &amp;ndash; or rather its statuette in the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] &amp;ndash; was made [[holotype]] of [[Richard Lydekker]]'s proposed [[subspecies]] (''Loxodonta africana rothschildi'') for the large elephants of the eastern [[Sahel]]. Modern authorities do not recognize this (or any other subspecies of African bush elephants), considering its purportedly diagnostic large size and peculiarly shaped ears to be individual variation.

While Jumbo's hide resided at Tufts' P.T. Barnum Hall, a superstition held that dropping a coin into a nostril of the trunk would bring good luck on an examination or sports event.&lt;ref name="Tufts-mascot"/&gt;  Although the hide was destroyed by a major fire,&lt;ref name = "Immolation" &gt;"[http://www.americanheritage.com/content/immolation-jumbo The Immolation Of Jumbo]", ''American Heritage'', Vol. 26, Issue 6, October 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; Jumbo remains the mascot of Tufts, and representations of the elephant are featured prominently throughout the campus.&lt;ref name="Tufts-mascot"/&gt;

[[Image:Jumbo1St.jpg|thumb|left|Jumbo statue in St. Thomas, Ontario, Canada]]
A life-sized statue of the elephant was erected in 1985 in St. Thomas, Ontario, to commemorate the centennial of the elephant's death.  It is located on Talbot Street on the west side of the city. In 2006, the Jumbo statue was inducted into the [[North America Railway Hall of Fame]] in the category of "Railway Art Forms &amp; Events" as having local significance.&lt;ref&gt;[//narhf.org/?p=5762 The North America Railway Hall of Fame | Inductee: The Jumbo Statue]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jumbo was the inspiration of the nickname of the 19th-century [[Jumbo Water Tower]] in the town of [[Colchester]] in [[Essex]], England.
[[File:Lucy the Margate Elephant HABS NJ,1-MARGCI,1-7.jpg|thumb|[[Lucy the Elephant]], a Jumbo-inspired building in New Jersey]]

[[Lucy the Elephant]], a six-story structure in [[Margate City, New Jersey]], was modeled after Jumbo.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Built by [[James V. Lafferty]] in 1881, Lucy is the oldest surviving [[Roadside attraction|roadside tourist attraction]] in America and a [[National Historic Landmark]]. Lafferty also made other Jumbo-shaped structures, including [[Elephantine Colossus]], on [[Coney Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lucytheelephant.org/|title=The World's Greatest Elephant - Lucy The Elephant|website=Lucy The Elephant|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jumbo has been lionized on a series of sheet-music covers from roughly 1882–83. The four-colour lithograph of Jumbo was created by [[Alfred Concanen]] of England, with the music title "Why Part With Jumbo",{{efn|Full title: "Why Part With Jumbo, the Pet of the Zoo"; by: George Barnham (composer); G. H. Macdermott (lyricist); Ernest J. Symons (composer)&lt;ref name=JS-Jumbo&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Part With Jumbo, the Pet of the Zoo|url=https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/handle/1774.2/22643|work=Levy Sheet Music Collection|publisher=JScholarship|accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; }} a song by the ''[[lion comique]]'' of [[Victorian Britain|Victorian British]] [[music hall]]s, [[G. H. MacDermott]]. It pictured children zoo visitors riding, somewhat precariously, on Jumbo's back. Multiple American lithographic music covers were done, including by [[John Henry Bufford|J. H. Bufford]]'s Sons.

Canadian folk singer [[James Gordon (Canadian musician)|James Gordon]] wrote the song "Jumbo's Last Ride", which recounts the story of Jumbo's life and death. It is on his 1999 CD ''Pipe Street Dreams''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jumbo's Last Ride|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/jumbos-last-ride-mt0000759950|website=AllMusic|publisher=[[All Media Network]]|accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==More evidence==
A television program about Jumbo, ''Attenborough and the Giant Elephant'', presented by the naturalist and broadcaster [[David Attenborough]], was transmitted on [[BBC One]] in the United Kingdom on 10 December 2017.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2017/50/attenborough-and-the-giant-elephant | title=Attenborough And The Giant Elephant | work=Media Centre | publisher=[[BBC]] | location=UK | accessdate=10 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An international team of scientists examined the skeleton and found:
* Jumbo's molar teeth were malformed and out of line as a result of a long-term soft diet that did not wear his molar teeth down enough, obstructing the forward eruptive movement of the next molar.
* Jumbo's nightly rages were probably caused by toothache, rather than [[musth]], as his keeper thought at the time.
* A ''post mortem'' photograph of Jumbo shows skin abrasions consistent with an illustration produced just after his death of the freight train hitting him on a hip from behind as he was being led across to his traveling carriage, and said that the likeliest cause of death was internal bleeding from his injuries.
* Examination of Jumbo's limb bones showed overgrown tendon attachment areas consistent with a long-term history of being overloaded at his work.
* Jumbo was still growing at the time of his death, as is normal for African male elephants of his age, and may eventually have attained the size claimed by Barnum.

D. | doi = 10.1098/rsbm.2001.0006 | title = Keith Gordon Cox. 25 April 1933 – 27 August 1998: Elected F.R.S. 1988 | journal = [[Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society]] | volume = 47 | pages = 91 | year = 2001 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; (25 April 1933 &amp;ndash; 27 August 1998) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[geologist]] and academic at the [[University of Oxford]]. He had a particular interest in [[flood basalt]]s and was regarded as one of the leading experts in this area.

==Life and career==

Cox was born in [[Birmingham]], [[England]], where his father was a university lecturer in chemistry.  After [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|wartime evacuation]] to [[Canada]], Cox attended [[King Edward's School, Birmingham]] and [[Leeds Grammar School]].  He completed [[National service#National Service in the United Kingdom|national service]] in the [[Royal Engineers]] between 1950 and 1952. He then took a scholarship to [[The Queen's College, Oxford]], where he obtained a first-class degree in geology in 1956. He lost an eye in an accident in the [[Lake District]] whilst on a field trip in 1955. After Oxford, Cox carried out further research at the [[University of Leeds]] before being appointed lecturer in [[petrology]] at [[Edinburgh University]]. In 1972 he became a lecturer in geology at Oxford, being appointed a fellow of [[Jesus College, Oxford]] in 1973. He was appointed a [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in 1988, the same year in which he became a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]]. He made several trips to South Africa and collaborated with local geochemists such as Dr. A.J. Erlank. He drowned in a sailing accident at [[Erraid]] off the [[Isle of Mull]] in the [[Hebrides]] on 27 August 1998.&lt;ref name=Cox&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/70888 | title = Cox, Keith Gordon (1933&amp;ndash;1998) | last=Bell | first=David | work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] (online edition, subscription access) | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]| year=2004 | accessdate=2007-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Cox's doctoral and post-doctoral research at Leeds was on the Masukwe Complex in the Nuanetsi region of what was then called [[Southern Rhodesia]]. This led to his developing a particular interest in [[flood basalt]]s, upon which topic he in due course became a world expert. Cox contemplated the significance of the geochemistry of these rocks during his work in the [[Karoo-Ferrar|Karoo]] region and, whilst at Edinburgh, also studiied conperable rocks from the [[Deccan Traps|Deccan]] area of India, as well as rocks from southern Arabia.  His research at Oxford also covered flood basalts in the [[Paraná and Etendeka traps|Parana]] region of South America, the Hebrides and [[Antarctica]]. He also studied [[kimberlite]]s.&lt;ref name=Cox/&gt;

He edited the [[Journal of Petrology]] (1971&amp;ndash;83) and [[Earth and Planetary Science Letters]] (1981&amp;ndash;85). He also wrote two textbooks: ''An Introduction to the Practical Study of Crystals, Minerals and Rocks'' (1967) (with B. N. Price and B. Harte) and ''The Interpretation of Igneous Rocks'' (1979) (with J. D. Bell and [[Robert John Pankhurst|R. J. Pankhurst]]).&lt;ref name=Cox/&gt;

'''Koinophilia''' is an [[evolution]]ary hypothesis proposing that during [[sexual selection]], animals preferentially seek [[Mate choice|mate]]s with a minimum of unusual or [[mutation|mutant]] features, including functionality, appearance and behavior.&lt;ref name= symons&gt;{{cite book |last= Symons |first= Donald | title= The Evolution of Human Sexuality |location= New York |publisher= Oxford University Press|publication-date= 1979 |isbn= 0-19-502535-0|LCCN= 78023361|OCLC= 4494283 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Langlois &amp; Roggman, 1990"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Langlois |first1=Judith H. |last2=Roggman |first2=Lori A. |date=1990 |title=Attractive faces are only average |journal=[[Psychological Science (journal)|Psychological Science]] |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |publisher=Sage Publications |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=115–121 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1990.tb00079.x |issn=0956-7976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koeslag, 1990"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koeslag |first=Johan H. |date= 1990 |title=Koinophilia groups sexual creatures into species, promotes stasis, and stabilizes social behaviour |journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Biology]] |location=Amsterdam, the Netherlands |publisher=Elsevier |volume=144 |issue=1 |pages=15–35 |doi=10.1016/s0022-5193(05)80297-8 |issn=0022-5193 |pmid=2200930}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koeslag, 1995"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koeslag |first=Johan H. |date= 1995 |title=On the engine of speciation |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |location=Amsterdam, the Netherlands |publisher=Elsevier |volume=177 |issue=4 |pages=401–409 |doi=10.1006/jtbi.1995.0256 |issn=0022-5193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=miller&gt;{{cite book|author1-last=Miller|author1-first =William B.|title=In: The Microcosm within: Evolution and Extinction in the Hologenome.|chapter= What is the big deal about evolutionary gaps?|publication-date=2013|publisher= Universal Publishers.|location= Boca Raton, Florida.|isbn=1-61233-2773|pages=177, 395–396}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unnikrishnan&gt;{{cite journal | author-last1= Unnikrishnan| author-first1=M.K.|year=2012 | title=Koinophilia revisited: the evolutionary link between mate selection and face recognition. | journal=Current Science|volume =102|issue =4|pages=563–570 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Koinophilia intends to explain the clustering of sexual organisms into [[species]] and other issues described by [[Speciation#Darwin's dilemma: Why do species exist?|Darwin's Dilemma]].&lt;ref name="Koeslag, 1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Koeslag, 1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name=miller /&gt; The term derives from the Greek, ''koinos'', "common", "that which is shared", and ''philia'', "fondness".

[[Natural selection]] causes [[Fitness (biology)|beneficial]] inherited features to become more common at the expense of their disadvantageous counterparts. The koinophilia hypothesis proposes that a sexually-reproducing animal would therefore be expected to avoid individuals with rare or unusual features, and to prefer to mate with individuals displaying a predominance of common or average features.&lt;ref name="Langlois &amp; Roggman, 1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Koeslag, 1990" /&gt; [[Mutation|Mutants]] with strange, odd or peculiar features would be avoided because most mutations that manifest themselves as changes in appearance, functionality or behavior are disadvantageous.&lt;ref name="Maynard Smith"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Maynard Smith |first1=John | title= Evolutionary Genetics |location=Oxford |publisher= Oxford University Press |publication-date=1989 |pages=55, 267, 273, 281 |isbn=0-19-854215-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because it is impossible to judge whether a new mutation is beneficial (or might be advantageous in the unforeseeable future) or not, koinophilic animals avoid them all, at the cost of avoiding the very occasional potentially beneficial mutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=George C. | chapter=Optimization and related concepts | title=In: Natural Selection: Domains, Levels and Challenges |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |publication-date=1992 |pages=60–61 |isbn= 0-19-506933-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, koinophilia, although not infallible in its ability to distinguish [[Fitness (biology)|fit]] from unfit mates, is a good strategy when [[Sexual selection|choosing a mate]]. A koinophilic choice ensures that offspring are likely to inherit a suite of features and attributes that have served all the members of the species well in the past.&lt;ref name="Koeslag, 1990" /&gt;

Koinophilia differs from the "like prefers like" mating pattern of [[assortative mating]].&lt;ref name=ayala&gt;{{cite book |last= Ayala |first= Francisco J. | title= Population and Evolutionary Genetics |location= Menlo Park, California |publisher= Benjamin/Cummings |publication-date= 1982| pages = 60, 73–83, 182–190, 198–215 |isbn= 0-8053-0315-4|lccn= 81021623| oclc= 8034790 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author-last=Buss|author-first =D.M.|title= Human mate selection |publication-date=1985|journal= American Scientist |volume=37| pages=47–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; If like preferred like, [[Leucism|leucistic]] animals (such as white peacocks) would be sexually attracted to one another, and a leucistic subspecies would come into being. Koinophilia predicts that this is unlikely because leucistic animals are attracted to the average in the same way as are all the other members of its species. Since non-leucistic animals are not attracted by leucism, few leucistic individuals find mates, and leucistic lineages will rarely form.

Koinophilia provides simple explanations for the almost universal canalization of sexual creatures into species,&lt;ref name="Koeslag, 1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Koeslag, 1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name=miller /&gt; the rarity of transitional forms between species (between both extant and fossil species),&lt;ref name="Koeslag, 1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Koeslag, 1995" /&gt; [[rate of evolution|evolutionary stasis]], [[punctuated equilibrium|punctuated equilibria]],&lt;ref name="Koeslag, 1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Koeslag, 1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name=miller /&gt; and the evolution of [[Co-operation (evolution)|cooperation]].&lt;ref name="Koeslag, 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koeslag |first1= J.H.|title= Sex, the prisoner's dilemma game, and the evolutionary inevitability of cooperation. |journal= [[Journal of Theoretical Biology]]|publication-date=1997 |volume=189 |pages=53–61 |doi=10.1006/jtbi.1997.0496 |pmid=9398503}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koeslag, 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koeslag |first1=J.H. |title= Evolution of cooperation: cooperation defeats defection in the cornfield model. |journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Biology]] | publication-date=2003 |volume=224 |pages=399–410 |doi=10.1016/s0022-5193(03)00188-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Koinophilia might also contribute to the ''maintenance'' of [[Evolution of sexual reproduction|sexual reproduction]], preventing its reversion to the much simpler and inherently more advantageous [[Asexual reproduction|asexual form of reproduction]].&lt;ref name="Koeslag, 1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koeslag |first1=J.H. |last2= Koeslag|first2= P.D. |title= Evolutionarily stable meiotic sex. |journal= [[Journal of Heredity]] | publication-date=1993 |volume=84 |pages=396–399}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koeslag, 1994"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koeslag |first1=P.D. |last2=Koeslag |first2=J.H. | title= Koinophilia stabilizes bi-gender sexual reproduction against asex in an unchanging environment. |journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Biology]] | publication-date=1994 |volume=166 |pages=251–260 |doi=10.1006/jtbi.1994.1023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reproductive isolation induced by koinophilia might thus be the first crucial step in the development of, ultimately, physiological, anatomical and behavioral barriers to hybridization, and thus, ultimately, full specieshood. Koinophilia will thereafter defend that species' appearance and behavior against invasion by unusual or unfamiliar forms (which might arise by immigration or mutation), and thus be a paradigm of [[punctuated equilibria]] (or the "vertical" aspect of the speciation problem).&lt;ref name="Koeslag, 1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Koeslag, 1995"/&gt;

===Background===
 
Evolution can be extremely rapid, as shown by the creation of domesticated animals and plants in a very short period of geological time, spanning only a few tens of thousands of years, by humans with little or no knowledge of genetics. [[Maize#Origin|Maize]], ''Zea mays'', for instance, was [[Teosinte|created]] in Mexico in only a few thousand years, starting about 7&amp;nbsp;000 to 12&amp;nbsp;000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Laws |first=Bill |year=2010 |title=Fifty Plants that Changed the Course of History| pages=210–215 |location=Buffalo, NY |publisher=Firefly Books |isbn=978-1-55407-798-4 |lccn=2011414731 |oclc=711609823}}&lt;/ref&gt; This raises the question of why the long term [[rate of evolution]] is far slower than is theoretically possible.&lt;ref name="Maynard Smith" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EldredgeN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="williams 1992" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mayr |first=Ernst |authorlink=Ernst Mayr |year=1954 |chapter=Change of genetic environment and evolution |editor1-last=Huxley |editor1-first=Julian |editor1-link=Julian Huxley |editor2-last=Hardy |editor2-first=Alister C. |editor2-link=Alister Hardy |editor3-last=Ford |editor3-first=Edmund B. |editor3-link=E.

Evolution is imposed on species or groups. It is not planned or striven for in some [[Lamarckism|Lamarckist]] way.&lt;ref name="GouldHopefulMonster"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gould |first1=Stephen Jay |chapter= Return of the hopeful monster | title=In: The Panda’s Thumb: More Reflections in Natural History |location=New York |publisher= W.W.

Therefore, while a species or group might benefit by being able to adapt to a new environment through the accumulation of a wide range of genetic variation, this is to the detriment of the ''individuals'' who have to carry these mutations until a small, unpredictable minority of them ultimately contributes to such an adaptation.

Consequently, sexual ''individuals'' would be expected to avoid transmitting mutations to their progeny by avoiding mates with strange or unusual characteristics.&lt;ref name=symons /&gt;&lt;ref name="Langlois &amp; Roggman, 1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Koeslag, 1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name=miller /&gt; Mutations that therefore affect the external appearance and habits of their carriers will seldom be passed on to the next and subsequent generations. They will therefore seldom be tested by natural selection. Evolutionary change in a large population with a wide choice of mates, will, therefore, come to a virtual standstill. The only mutations that can accumulate in a population are ones that have no noticeable effect on the outward appearance and functionality of their bearers (they are thus termed  "[[silent mutations|silent]]" or "[[neutral theory of molecular evolution|neutral mutations]]").

===Evolutionary process===

The restraint koinophilia exerts on [[phenotype|phenotypic change]] suggests that evolution can only occur if mutant mates cannot be avoided as a result of a severe scarcity of potential mates. This is most likely to occur in [[Island genetics|small restricted communities]], such as on small islands, in remote valleys, lakes, river systems, caves,&lt;ref name=ayala /&gt; or [[Glacial period|during periods of glaciation]],&lt;ref name=Poelstra /&gt; or following [[mass extinction]]s, when sudden bursts of evolution can be expected.&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Neil A. |authorlink=Neil Campbell (scientist) |year=1990 |title=Biology |edition=2nd |pages=450–451, 487–490, 499–501  |location=Redwood City, CA |publisher=Benjamin/Cummings Pub. Co. |isbn=0-8053-1800-3 |lccn=89017952 |oclc=20352649 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under these circumstances, not only is the choice of mates severely restricted, but [[population bottlenecks]], [[founder effects]], [[genetic drift]] and [[inbreeding]] cause rapid, random changes in the isolated population's genetic composition.&lt;ref name="ayala" /&gt; Furthermore, [[Hybrid speciation|hybridization with a related species]] trapped in the same isolate might introduce additional genetic changes.&lt;ref name=Arnold&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnold|first=M.L.|title=Natural Hybridization and Evolution|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-509975-1|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Wendel |first1=J.F. | last2=Doyle |first2=J.J. | chapter= DNA Sequencing |editor1-last= Soltis |editor1-first=D.E. |editor2-last= Soltis |editor2-first=P.S. |editorlink2 = Pamela S.

In geological terms this will be an abrupt event. A resumption of avoiding mutant mates will, thereafter, result, once again, in evolutionary stagnation.

Thus the [[Fossil record|fossil record]]  of an evolutionary progression typically consists of species that suddenly appear, and ultimately disappear hundreds of thousands or millions of years later, without any change in external appearance.&lt;ref name=Gould&amp;Eldredge1977 /&gt;&lt;ref name=gould2 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell" /&gt;&lt;ref name=McCarthy&gt;{{cite book |last1=McCarthy |first1=Terence |last2=Rubidge |first2=Bruce |year=2005 |title=The Story of Earth &amp; Life: A Southern African Perspective on a 4.6-Billion-Year Journey |location=Cape Town, South Africa |publisher=Struik Publishers |isbn=1-77007-148-2 |lccn=2006376206 |oclc=62098231 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Graphically, these fossil species are represented by horizontal lines, whose lengths depict how long each of them existed. The horizontality of the lines illustrates the unchanging appearance of each of the fossil species depicted on the graph. During each species' existence new species appear at random intervals, each also lasting many hundreds of thousands of years before disappearing without a change in appearance. The degree of relatedness and the lines of descent of these concurrent species is generally impossible to determine. This is illustrated in the following diagram depicting the [[Human evolution|evolution of modern humans]] from the time that the [[Hominini|hominins]] separated from the line that led to the evolution of our closest living primate relatives, the [[chimpanzees]].&lt;ref name=McCarthy /&gt;

===Phenotypic implications===

This proposal, that [[population bottlenecks]] are possibly the primary generators of the variation that fuels evolution, predicts that evolution will usually occur in intermittent, relatively large scale [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] steps, interspersed with prolonged periods of evolutionary stagnation,&lt;ref name="Gouldepisodic"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gould |first1=Stephen Jay |chapter= The episodic nature of evolutionary change | title=In: The Panda’s Thumb: More Reflections in Natural History |location=New York |publisher= W.W.

Norton &amp; Company |publication-date=1980 |pages=27–34 |isbn=0-393-30023-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The present model predicts  that, in addition to vestiges which reflect an organism’s evolutionary heritage, all the members of a given species will also bear the stamp of their isolationary past – arbitrary, random features, accumulated through [[founder effects]], [[genetic drift]] and the other genetic consequences of sexual reproduction in [[Island genetics|small, isolated communities]].&lt;ref name="Koeslag, 1995" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Zimmer |year=2001 |title=Evolution: The Triumph of an Idea |edition=1st |others=Introduction by [[Stephen Jay Gould]]; foreword by Richard Hutton |location=New York |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |isbn=0-06-019906-7 |lccn=2001024077 |oclc=46359440 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus all lions, African and Asian, have a highly characteristic black tuft of fur at the end of their tails, which is difficult to explain in terms of an adaptation, or as a vestige from an early [[Felidae|feline]], or more ancient ancestor. The unique, often color- and pattern-rich plumage of each of today’s wide variety of bird species presents a similar evolutionary enigma. This richly varied array of [[phenotype]]s is more easily explained as the products of isolates, subsequently defended by koinophilia, than as assemblies of very diverse evolutionary relics, or as sets of uniquely evolved adaptations.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Evolution of co-operation===
{{Main|Co-operation (evolution)|Altruism (biology)}}

[[Co-operation (evolution)|Co-operation]] is any group behavior that benefits the individuals more than if they were to act as independent agents. 

[[Image:Canis lupus pack surrounding Bison.jpg|thumb|center|250 px|Co-operative hunting by wolves allows them to tackle much larger and more nutritious prey than any individual wolf could handle. However, such [[Co-operation (evolution)|co-operation]] could be exploited by selfish individuals which do not expose themselves to the dangers of the hunt, but nevertheless share in the spoils.]]

However selfish individuals can exploit the co-operativeness of others by not taking part in the group activity, but still enjoying its benefits. For instance, a selfish individual which does not join the hunting pack and share in its risks, but nevertheless shares in the spoils, has a fitness advantage over the other members of the pack. Thus, although a group of co-operative individuals is fitter than an equivalent group of selfish individuals, selfish individuals interspersed among a community of co-operators are always fitter than their hosts. They will raise, on average, more offspring than their hosts, and will ultimately replace them.&lt;ref name="River_Out_of_Eden" /&gt;&lt;ref name=dawkins /&gt;&lt;ref name=dennet /&gt;&lt;ref name=pinker /&gt;

If, however, the selfish individuals are ostracized, and rejected as mates, because of their deviant and unusual behavior, then their evolutionary advantage becomes an evolutionary liability.&lt;ref name="Koeslag, 1990" /&gt; Co-operation then becomes [[Evolutionarily stable strategy|evolutionarily stable]].&lt;ref name="Koeslag, 1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Koeslag, 2003" /&gt;

==Effects of diets and environmental conditions==

[[File:Drosophila pseudoobscura-Male.png|thumb|right|300 px|Male ''Drosophila pseudoobscura'']]

The best-documented creations of new species in the laboratory were performed in the late 1980s. William Rice and G.W. Salt bred fruit flies, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', using a maze with three different choices of habitat, such as light/dark and wet/dry. Each generation was placed into the maze, and the groups of flies that came out of two of the eight exits were set apart to breed with each other in their respective groups. After thirty-five generations, the two groups and their offspring were isolated reproductively because of their strong habitat preferences: they mated only within the areas they preferred, and so did not mate with flies that preferred the other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rice |first1=William R. |last2=Salt |first2=George W. |date= 1988 |title=Speciation via disruptive selection on habitat preference: Experimental evidence |journal=The American Naturalist |location=Chicago, IL |publisher=University of Chicago Press on behalf of the American Society of Naturalists |volume=131 |issue=6 |pages=911–917 |doi=10.1086/284831 |issn=0003-0147}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of such attempts is described in Rice and Hostert (1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rice |first1=William R. |last2=Hostert |first2=Ellen E. |date= 1993 |title=Laboratory experiments on speciation: What have we learned in 40 years? |journal=[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]] |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] for the [[Society for the Study of Evolution]] |volume=47 |issue=6 |pages=1637–1653 |doi=10.2307/2410209 |issn=0014-3820 |jstor=2410209}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid14628909"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gavrilets |first=Sergey |date= 2003 |title=Perspective: Models of speciation: What have we learned in 40 years? |journal=Evolution |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons for the Society for the Study of Evolution |volume=57 |issue=10 |pages=2197–2215 |doi=10.1554/02-727 |issn=0014-3820 |pmid=14628909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
William B. Miller,&lt;ref name=miller /&gt; in an extensive recent (2013) review of koinophilia theory, notes that while it provides [[Occam's razor|precise]] explanations for the grouping of sexual animals into species, their unchanging persistence in the fossil record over long periods of time, and the phenotypic gaps between species, both fossil and extant, it represents a major departure from the widely accepted view that [[Fitness (biology)|beneficial mutations]] spread, ultimately, to the whole, or some portion of the population (causing it to evolve gene by gene).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dawkins |first1=Richard |chapter=Accumulating small change| title= In: The Blind Watchmaker |location=London |publisher=Penguin Books |publication-date=1988 |pages=43–74|isbn=0-14-014481-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dawkins |first1=Richard | title= Climbing Mount Improbable | location=London |publisher=Penguin Books |publication-date=1996 |pages=97–179 |isbn=0-670-85018-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] recognized that this process had no inherent, or inevitable propensity to produce species.&lt;ref name="Gould 1980" /&gt;&lt;ref name=darwin /&gt; Instead populations would be in a [[Speciation#Darwin's dilemma: Why do species exist?|perpetual state of transition both in time and space]].&lt;ref name="Gould 1980" /&gt;&lt;ref name=darwin /&gt; They would, at any given moment, consist of individuals with varying numbers of beneficial characteristics that may or may not have reached them from their various points of origin in the population, and neutral features will have a scattering determined by random mechanisms such as [[genetic drift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gould |first1=S.J. |last2=Lewontin |first2=R.C. |title=The spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian paradigm: A critique of the adaptationist programme |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B | publication-date=1979 |volume=205 |pages=581–598 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1979.0086 |pmid=42062 |date=September 1979|bibcode=1979RSPSB.205..581G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gould |first1=Stephen Jay | chapter=Hyena myths and realities | title=In: Hen’s Teeth and Horse’s Toes.

He also notes that koinophilia provides no explanation as to how the physiological, anatomical and genetic causes of reproductive isolation come about. It is only the behavioral [[reproductive isolation]] that is addressed by koinophilia. It is furthermore difficult to see how koinophilia might apply to plants, and certain marine creatures that discharge their gametes into the environment to meet up and fuse, it seems, entirely randomly (within conspecific confines). However, when pollen from several compatible donors is used to pollinate stigmata, the donors typically do not sire equal numbers of seeds.&lt;ref name=marshall&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marshall |first1=Diane L. |last2=Diggle |first2=Pamela K. |title=Mechanisms of differential pollen donor performance in wild radish, ''Raphanus sativus'' (Brassicaceae) |journal=American Journal of Botany | publication-date=2001 |volume=88 |pages=242–257|issn=1537-2197 |doi=10.2307/2657015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall and Diggle state that the existence of some kind of non-random seed paternity is, in fact, not in question in flowering plants.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="532">In [[telecommunication]], a '''layered system''' is a [[system]] in which components are grouped, ''i.e.'', layered, in a hierarchical arrangement, such that lower layers provide functions and services that support the functions and services of higher layers. 

Systems of ever-increasing complexity and capability can be built by adding or changing the layers to improve overall system capability while using the components that are still in place.

'''Macrofossils''', also known as '''megafossils''', are preserved [[life|organic]] remains large enough to be visible without a [[microscope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Macrofossil|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/macrofossil|website=Merriam Webster|accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''macrofossil'' stands in opposition to the term [[microfossil]]. Microfossils, by contrast, require substantial magnification for evaluation by [[fossil]]-hunters or professional [[paleontology|paleontologist]]s. As a result, most fossils observed in the [[field research|field]] and most "museum-quality" specimens are macrofossils.

==Varieties==

===Plant macrofossils===

[[Plantae|Plant]] macrofossils include [[leaf]], [[Pinophyta|needle]], [[Conifer cone|cone]], and [[plant stem|stem]] debris; and can be used to identify types of plants formerly growing in the area. Such [[Botany|botanical]] macrofossil data provide a valuable complement to [[pollen]] and [[fauna]]l data that can be used to reconstruct the [[prehistoric life|prehistoric]] [[Earth|terrestrial]] environment.  [[Algae|Algal]] macrofossils (for instance, brown [[kelp]], [[sea lettuce]] and large  [[stromatolite]]s) are increasingly used to analyze prehistoric [[Marine ecosystem|marine]] and [[aquatic ecosystem]]s.

===Animal macrofossils===

[[Animalia|Animal]] macrofossils include the [[teeth]], [[skull]]s, and [[bone]]s of [[Vertebrata|vertebrate]]s, as well as such [[invertebrate]] remains as [[Animal shell|shell]]s, [[test (biology)|test]]s, [[armour (zoology)|faunal armor]], and [[exoskeleton]]s.  Fossilized dung (that is, [[coprolite]]s) are also macrofossils.

[[Beatification|Blessed]] '''María Francisca Ricart Olmos''' (23 February 1881 - 2 October 1936) - in religious '''María Guadalupe''' - was a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Nun|professed religious]] from the [[Servite Order]].&lt;ref name=SEB&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/93381|title=Blessed María Guadalupe (María Francisca) Ricart Olmos|date=|publisher=Santi e Beati|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://catholicsaints.info/blessed-maria-francisca-ricart-olmos/|title=Blessed María Francisca Ricart Olmos|publisher=Saints SQPN|date=2 October 2016|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ricart's call to the religious life manifested at the time she made her [[First Communion]] after expressing the desire to consecrate herself to [[God]]; she entered the [[convent]] when she turned fifteen and served her convent as both a [[Mistress of novices|novice mistress]] and [[prioress]]. Her peers held her in high regard for her dedication to helping and instructing new [[Nun|nuns]] as well as for her compassionate and jovial character.&lt;ref name=MG&gt;{{citeweb|date=|publisher=Beata Madre María Guadalupe|accessdate=10 January 2018|title=Childhood and adolescence|url=http://www.madreguadalupe.com/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SH&gt;{{citeweb|publisher=Friar Servants of Mary|date=|title=Blessed People|accessdate=10 January 2018|url=http://www.servite.org/History/history-Blessed.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

Ricart's beatification process opened in the late 1950s and concluded upon her beatification itself on 11 March 2001 in which [[Pope John Paul II]] beatified her and [[233 Spanish Martyrs|232 others]] slain during the [[Spanish Civil War]].

==Life==
María Francisca Ricart Olmos was born in 1881 in [[Albal]] nine kilometers from [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] as the second of four children to Francisco Ricart and María Olmos; she was [[baptized]] within a week following her birth.&lt;ref name=MG/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; Her eldest sibling was José and the two siblings that followed her were Antonio and Filomena. Her father died in 1885 due to illness and people in their village often referred to her mother as a saint.

Ricart became an active participant in parish life and later made her [[First Communion]] in 1891. Ricart was known for being exuberant in her childhood but was noted to have grown more reserved following her First Communion due to the strengthening of her faith; she still maintained a kind and amiable disposition to those around her.&lt;ref name=MG/&gt; The [[Venerable]] Vicente Garrido Pastor oversaw her and other girls' formation for First Communion and asked if some of them would be willing to dedicate themselves to [[God]]. Garrido was surprised when Ricart raised her hand at once and replied in the affirmative with a smile.

The girl made frequent visits to the Pie de la Cruz [[convent]] of the [[Servite Order]] in Valencia since it was there that her mother had a friend. This made the convent recognizable for Ricart who longed to enter it as a [[nun]].&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; It was also in that place that her call to the religious life grew to the point where both her mother and parish priest agreed to allow her to enter the convent on 11 July 1896 after she turned fifteen.&lt;ref name=SH/&gt;&lt;ref name=MG/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; It was upon her arrival to the convent that she became a postulant before doing her [[novitiate]] and initial profession. Ricart made her solemn religious profession on 19 June 1900 in the habit as "María Guadalupe".

From 1928 until 1931 she served as the [[Mistress of novices|novice mistress]] before she served as the convent's [[prioress]] from 1931 until 1934 when she was re-elected as the novice mistress; she would hold that position until her death. Ricart was devoted to the [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]] and often meditated on the sufferings of the [[Blessed virgin Mary|Mother]] at the foot of the Cross.&lt;ref name=MG/&gt; Her colleagues held her in high regard for her jovial and compassionate spirit as well as for her strong leadership abilities while noting her dedication to passing down the proper values of contemplative life to new members.&lt;ref name=SH/&gt;

In July 1936 the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Valencia in Spain|Archbishop of Valencia]] Prudencio Melo i Alcalde ordered the religious of the convent to adopt secular clothing and flee their convent to take refuge with their families due to the increasing violence and [[anti-religious sentiment]] of the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Ricart first moved into her niece's home but remained there for just over a week since her niece was pregnant and Ricart did not wish to jeopardize her niece's life.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; Ricart moved to Albal after this at the month's end to reside with her sister Filomena.&lt;ref name=MG/&gt;

On 2 October 1936 just after midnight she was disturbed after hearing a commotion. Ricart left her room to see her sister and brother-in-law José attempting to prevent four militiamen from searching the house.&lt;ref name=SH/&gt; Filomena had been seated while José was asleep when the four men knocked on the window three times asking to be allowed into the home.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; Ricart made her presence known to which one soldier asked if she was a nun after a [[scapular]] and other items were discovered. Ricart replied "I am a nun" to which the same man said: "You must come with us". Ricart was calm and offered no resistance as she said "then let's go".&lt;ref name=MG/&gt; The nun climbed into the back of a truck clutching her [[crucifix]] and urged courage to her sister and brother-in-law. Her final actions were first to thank José for all he had done for her and hugging Filomena with a calm and serene look.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

Ricart was hauled before a sham tribunal which sentenced her to death. But she demonstrated a great degree of peace which made her executioners hesitant in following their orders. One of the militiamen grew frustrated and called them "cowards" before declaring that he would kill her himself. Ricart was killed two hours later at 4:00am after two shots ended her life as well as a period of extreme abuse and ill-treatment. Ricart was killed in Torre Espioca along the [[Silla, Valencia|Silla]]-[[Picassent]] town borders on the provincial road to [[Madrid]].&lt;ref name=MG/&gt;

Her remains were left in a common grave but relocated on 2 March 1940 to the convent before being moved again to the relocated convent at [[Mislata]] beside the main altar.&lt;ref name=SH/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; Her remains were [[Exhumation|exhumed]] on 19 June 2000 for canonical inspection. This meant her remains would be examined before being re-clothed and sterilized for transferal and reburial. This lasted one week in preparation for her beatification.&lt;ref name=MG/&gt;

==Beatification==
{{main article|233 Spanish Martyrs}}
The beatification process for Ricart opened in the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Valencia in Spain|Valencia archdiocese]] under Marcelino Olaechea i Loizaga who inaugurated a diocesan investigation on 24 January 1958 before closing it just a few months later on 21 June. The cause remained dormant for sometime until 17 July 1987 when the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] validated this investigation in [[Rome]]. The C.C.S. later received the [[Positio]] dossier for evaluation a decade later in 1996.

Theologians approved the cause on 2 December 1998 as did the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. on 13 April 1999 before [[Pope John Paul II]] issued final approval on 28 June 1999 in a move that confirmed Ricart would be beatified. The beatification was celebrated on 11 March 2001 in [[Saint Peter's Square]] in which Ricart was beatified alongside 232 others; she is often identified as a member of that large group despite her cause having been initiated and conducted separate to the group.

The current [[postulator]] for this cause is the Servite priest Franco M. Azzalli.

This was the first of several cases across the [[United States]] that were reported to the police as supposed acts of retaliation for the attacks. Balbir Singh Sodhi, who wore a beard and a [[turban]] in accordance with his [[Sikh]] faith, was mistaken for an [[Arab]] [[Muslim]] and murdered by 42-year-old [[Frank Silva Roque]], a [[Boeing]] aircraft mechanic at a local repair facility who held a criminal record for an [[robbery|attempted robbery]] in [[California]]. Roque had reportedly told friends that he was "going to go out and shoot some towel-heads" the day of the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Valarie|last=Karr|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-09-23/his-brother-was-murdered-wearing-turban-after-911-last-week-he-spoke-killer|title=His brother was murdered for wearing a turban after 9/11. 15 years later, he spoke to the killer|work=pri.org|date=September 23, 2016|accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roque was sentenced to death ([[clemency|commuted]] later to [[life imprisonment]]) for [[first degree murder]].

== Background ==
Born in [[Punjab, India]], Balbir Singh Sodhi was a member of the [[Sikh]] religion. He immigrated to the United States in 1989 and initially resided in [[Los Angeles]], where he worked as a computer engineer and analyst at [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]]. He saved enough money to buy a gas station and several affiliated franchises in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] and moved there.&lt;ref name="NYT09-17-2001"&gt;{{cite news|first=Tamar | last=Lewin | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/17/us/sikh-owner-of-gas-station-is-fatally-shot-in-rampage.html? | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | title=Sikh Owner Of Gas Station Is Fatally Shot In Rampage | date=September 17, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 11, 2001, members of [[al-Qaeda]], a militant [[Islamist]] group, hijacked four airplanes and perpetrated [[September 11 attacks|the 9/11 attacks]], killing 2,977 victims. According to family members, Sodhi had become distraught by the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Naomi|last=Gingold|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-09-20/brother-one-first-hate-crime-victims-post-911-keeps-teaching-tolerance|title=The brother of one of the first hate-crime victims post 9/11 keeps on teaching tolerance|work=pri.org|date=September 20, 2016|accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roque shootings==
On September 15, 2001, Roque took his [[Chevrolet S-10]] from the Wild Hare sports bar in [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]], where he had reportedly been ranting about immigrants, and drove to the [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron gas station]] owned by Sodhi. Roque shot Sodhi five times from his truck with a .380 handgun, killing him. At the time of the shooting, Sodhi was helping landscaper Luis Ledesma plant flowers around the edge of his gas station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Gary|last=Grado|url=http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/news/roque-could-get-death-penalty-for-sikh-murder/article_83b74c56-3b8f-5e72-85af-ce8d4a4d944d.html|title=Roque could get death penalty for Sikh murder|work=[[East Valley Tribune]]|publisher=[[Times Media Group]]|location=Tempe, Arizona|date=October 1, 2003|accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roque, who apparently wanted revenge for the 9/11 attacks, mistook him for an [[Arab]] [[Muslim]] because of the clothes he wore, his [[turban]], and his beard. Roque then drove to a [[Mobil|Mobil gas station]] 10 miles away. Twenty minutes after the first shooting, he shot at a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]]-American clerk from his truck, but missed.&lt;ref name="NYT09-17-2001" /&gt; Roque then drove to his former residence, which had been purchased by a local Afghan family, and fired multiple rounds at the outside of the house. After fleeing the scene of the final shooting, Roque was reported to have gone to a local bar and boasted, "They're investigating the murder of a turban-head down the street."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Sunny | last=Hundal| title = Wisconsin temple shooting: Sikhs have been silent scapegoats since 9/11 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/06/wisconsin-temple-shooting-sikh-scapegoats | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London, England|date = August 6, 2012|accessdate = August 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="splc"/&gt;

==Arrest, trial, conviction==
Police arrested Roque the next day, initially unaware of the later shooting incidents. He reportedly shouted slogans including "I am a patriot!" and "I stand for America all the way!" during his arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccr.gov/pubs/sac/dc0603/ch6.htm|title=Chapter 6: Fears and Concerns of Affected, At-Risk Communities|website=Usccr.gov|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[bail]] was set at $1 million.

Roque's [[trial by jury]] began on August 18, 2003. Defense attorneys argued he was not guilty [[plea of insanity|due to insanity]], claiming that he had a diminished [[IQ]] and heard relentless voices telling him that Arabs were Satanic and must be killed. Two coworkers testified that Roque was "narrow-minded" and that he hated both immigrants and Arabs. Roque's defense attorney characterized him as mentally ill, and noted that his mother had twice been hospitalized for [[schizophrenia]], a condition which has been shown to appear in those genetically predisposed to it.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|first=Julian|last=Borger|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/oct/11/usa.julianborger|title=September 11 revenge killer to die for shooting Sikh|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=10 October 2003|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 30, 2003, he was found guilty of [[first degree murder]], and was [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]] nine days later.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

On July 19, 2005, Roque was found guilty of an unspecified conspiracy charge while in prison, specified only as a violent crime. On February 27, 2006, he was found guilty of having manufactured a primitive weapon in prison three days earlier. In August 2006, the Arizona Supreme Court changed Roque's death sentence to a sentence of life in prison without parole, citing his low IQ and [[mental illness]] as [[mitigating factor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Michael|last1=Kiefer|first2=Jim|last2=Walsh|title=9/11-tied slayer won't be executed|url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/local/articles/0815roque0815.html |work=[[Arizona Republic]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=Phoenix, Arizona|date=August 15, 2006|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120720154640/http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/local/articles/0815roque0815.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 20, 2012 |accessdate=December 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://korematsu.blogspot.com/2006/08/arizona-supreme-court-overturns-death.html |title=DNSI Blog: Arizona Supreme Court Overturns Death Sentence for Frank Roque - Killer of Balbir Singh Sodhi |publisher=Korematsu.blogspot.com |date=August 15, 2006 |accessdate=July 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial was aired by [[Court TV]] in a five-part series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jim|last=Walsh|url=http://tucsoncitizen.com/morgue2/2003/09/03/149112-killer-of-sikh-after-9-11-called-ill/|title=Killer of Sikh after 9-11 called ill|work=[[Tucson Citizen]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=Tucson, Arizona|date=September 3, 2003|accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sukhpal Sodhi==
On August 4, 2002, less than a year after Sodhi's death, his younger brother Sukhpal was shot to death while driving his taxicab in San Francisco, apparently killed by a stray bullet from a nearby [[gang]] fight. In response to this second tragedy, Balbir's son Sukhwinder said, "What are you going to do with anger? We like peace and we are a peaceful people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Judi|last1=Villa|first2=Adam|last2=Klawonn|url=http://www.sikhmediawatch.org/newsite/news/newsdetail.asp?newsid%3D50 |title=Brother of slain Valley Sikh killed in San Francicso (sic)|work=[[The Arizona Republic]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=Phoenix, Arizona|date=August 6, 2002|accessdate=June 8, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030122220844/http://www.sikhmediawatch.org/newsite/news/newsdetail.asp?newsid=50 |archivedate=January 22, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Intelligence Council''' ('''NIC''') is the center for midterm and long-term strategic thinking within the [[United States Intelligence Community]] (IC).  It was formed in 1979.  According to its official website:

* It leads the IC's effort to produce [[National Intelligence Estimate]]s and other documents;
* It supports (and reports to) the [[United States Director of National Intelligence|Director of National Intelligence]];
* It serves as a focal point for [[policymaker]]s' questions;
* It contributes to the effort to allocate IC resources in response to policy changes; and
* It communicates with experts in [[academia]] and the [[private sector]] to broaden the IC's perspective;

The NIC's goal is to provide policymakers with the best information: unvarnished, unbiased and without regard to whether the analytic judgments conform to current U.S. policy.

One of the NICs most important analytical projects is a Global Trends report produced for the incoming US president.  The report is delivered to the incoming president between Election Day and [[Inauguration Day]], and it assesses critical drivers and scenarios for global trends with an approximate time horizon of fifteen years.  The Global Trends analysis provides a basis for long-range strategic policy assessment for the White House and the intelligence community.  The NIC's most recent Global Trends report, "Global Trends 2035: Paradox of Progress" was released in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dni.gov/files/images/globalTrends/documents/GT-Full-Report.pdf NIC Global Trends 2035]&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 2, 2007, the [[Office of the Director of National Intelligence]], and the National Intelligence Council released the National Intelligence Estimate (NIE)—{{"-}}'Prospects for Iraq's Stability: A Challenging Road Ahead' Unclassified Key Judgments".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dni.gov/press_releases/20070202_release.pdf Iraq National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) - "Prospects for Iraq's Stability: A Challenging Road Ahead" Unclassified Key Judgments] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302125700/http://www.dni.gov/press_releases/20070202_release.pdf |date=2007-03-02 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
The NIC has a Chairman and Vice Chairman, as well as a Vice Chairman for Evaluation, a Director of Strategic Plans and Outreach, a Director of Analysis and Production Staff, a Special Adviser, and [[National Intelligence Officer]]s (NIOs) and Deputy National Intelligence Officer for each of the following areas and subject matters:

* [[Africa]]
* [[East Asia]]
* [[Europe]]
* [[Latin America]]
* [[Near East]]
* [[South Asia]]
* [[Russia]] and [[Eurasia]]
* [[Economics]] &amp; Global Issues

'''Pavel Nikolayevich Filonov''' ({{lang-rus|Па́вел Никола́евич Фило́нов|p=ˈpavʲɪl nʲɪkɐˈlajɪvʲɪtɕ fʲɪˈlonəf|a=Pavyel Nikolayevich Filonov.ru.vorb.oga}}; January 8, 1883 – December 3, 1941) was a [[Russian avant-garde]] painter, art theorist, and poet.

==Biography==
[[Image:Pavel Filonov Glebova.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''Portrait of E.&amp;nbsp;N.&amp;nbsp;Glebova'' (the artist's sister), 1915, oil on canvas. 117x152.5&amp;nbsp;cm. [[Russian Museum]].]]
Filonov was born in Moscow on January 8, 1883 ([[Gregorian calendar]]) or December 27, 1882 ([[Julian calendar]]). In 1897, he moved to [[Saint Petersburg|St.&amp;nbsp;Petersburg]] where he took art lessons. In 1908, he entered [[Imperial Academy of Arts|St.&amp;nbsp;Petersburg Academy of Arts]], from which, he was expelled in 1910.

In 1910–1914, he took part in the arts group [[Soyuz Molodyozhi]] created by artists [[Elena Guro]] and [[Mikhail Matyushin]]. In 1912, he wrote the article ''The Canon and the Law'', in which, he formulated the principles of [[analytical art|analytical realism]], or "anti-Cubism". According to Filonov, [[Cubism]] represents objects using elements of their surface geometry but "analytical realists" should represent objects using elements of their inner soul. He was faithful to these principles for the remainder of his life.
[[Image:Pavel Filonov HolyFamily.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''[[Peasant Family|A Peasant Family (The Holy Family)]]'', 1914, oil on canvas, 159x128 cm, [[Russian Museum]].]]

During the years 1913 to 1915, Filonov was close to [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], [[Velimir Khlebnikov]], and other [[Russian Futurism|futurists]]. He co-illustrated Khlebnikov's ''Selected Poems with Postscript, 1907–1914'' alongside [[Kazimir Malevich]] during this time.&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/9236/ |title = Selected Poems with Postscript, 1907–1914 |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1914 |accessdate = 2013-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the autumn of 1916, he enlisted for service in World War I, and served on the [[Romania]]n front. Filonov participated actively in the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and served as the Chairman of the Revolutionary War Committee of Dunay region.

In 1919, he exhibited in the First Free Exhibit of Artists of All Trends at the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]]. In 1923, he became a professor of St.&amp;nbsp;Petersburg Academy of Arts and a member of the Institute for Artistic Culture (INKhUK). He organized a large arts school of Masters of Analytical Realism (over seventy artists). Their work influenced [[suprematism]] and [[expressionism]].

In 1929, a large retrospective exhibition of Filonov art was planned at the [[Russian Museum]]; however, the Soviet government forbade the exhibition from going forward. From 1932 onward, Filonov literally starved but still refused to sell his works to private collectors. He wanted to give all his works to the Russian Museum as a gift so as to start a Museum of Analytical Realism. He died of starvation on December 3, 1941 during the [[Siege of Leningrad|Nazi Siege of Leningrad]].

==Method==
Under the umbrella of [[Universal Flowering]], Filonov put forth a manner of working that proceeded from the particular to the general. He believed that objects and fields should be built up from small details and bits and stated that doing it the other-way-round was nothing short of "charlatanism". To this end, he worked, and required his students to work, with very small brushes in painting and the finest of points when drawing.

==Legacy==

Most of Filonov's works were saved by his sister Yevdokiya Nikolayevna Glebova. She stored the paintings in the Russian Museum's archives and eventually donated them as a gift. Exhibitions of Filonov's work were forbidden. In 1967, an exhibition of Filonov's works in [[Novosibirsk]] was permitted. In 1988, his work was allowed in the Russian Museum. In 1989 and 1990, the first international exhibition of Filonov's work was held in Paris.

During the period of half-legal status of Filonov's works it was seemingly easy to steal them; however, there was a [https://web.archive.org/web/20071230105139/http://www.tv-ostankino.ru/material/Material_459_42.htm legend] that Filonov's ghost protected his art and anybody trying to steal his paintings or to smuggle them abroad would soon die, become paralyzed, or have a similar misfortune.&lt;!--is this encyclopedic?--&gt;

He was rated the 70th richest Canadian by ''[[Canadian Business Magazine]]'' in 2009 with a net worth of $817 million &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kirbyson |first=Geoff |url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/manitobans-make-magazines-rich-100-list-70447987.html |title=Manitobans make magazine's Rich 100 list |publisher=Winnipeg Free Press |date=2009-11-19 |accessdate=2010-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but he is not shown on the Canadian Business ranking of the 100 wealthiest individuals and families in Canada 2018 list [https://www.canadianbusiness.com/lists-and-rankings/richest-people/100-richest-canadians-complete-list/]

==Early life and education==

Nygård was born in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]] in 1943.

==Tan Jay==
On December 1, 1967, Nygård started working as sales manager for a new jeans line of a woman’s clothing manufacturer Jacob Fashions . A few weeks later Nygård used his life [[savings]] of $8,000 and an additional [[loan]] to purchase 20% of the company from the founder Nathan Jacob. A few years later, Nygård bought the rest of the company from Jacobs daughters and renamed it Tan Jay.[http://jonesbahamas.com/the-opportunity-that-led-to-a-fortune/]

Nygård apparel manufacturing company was founded in 1967 in [[Winnipeg]], Manitoba.  Its Canada headquarters is now in [[Toronto]], Ontario with its world headquarters in [[Times Square]], [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.nygard.com/company-profile/?ID=31&amp;Folder_id=14 |title=Nygard International Company Profile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nygård's fashion concept retail store opened in [[Times Square]] in [[Manhattan]] on Friday, November 6, 2009.

==Nygård Cay==

In 1987, Nygård built a {{convert|150000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} compound at [[Lyford Cay]] in the Bahamas.  It was partly destroyed by a fire on November 10, 2009.&lt;ref name="nygard_cay_fire"&gt;[http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/Fire-destroys-Nygards-Bahamas-compound-69911722.html "Fire destroys Nygard's Bahamas compound"], [[Winnipeg Free Press]], November 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Cay is inspired by the [[Mayan civilization]]’s architecture. One of the major buildings is a 32,000 ft&lt;sup&gt;2 &lt;/sup&gt;grand-hall with a 100,000&amp;nbsp;lb glass ceiling.&lt;ref name="DTProfile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unusualvillarentals.com/caribbean/bahamas/nygard/|title=Nygård Cay|publisher=unusualvillarentals.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626100416/http://www.unusualvillarentals.com/caribbean/bahamas/nygard/|archive-date=2010-06-26|dead-url=yes|accessdate=28 June 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 14, 2010 Peter Nygard announced he was planning a $50 million renovation of Nygård Cay, which would take two years to complete and repair the damage and employ 200 construction workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenassauguardian.com/bixex/325682364938194.php|title=Nygard pledges 50 million comeback|publisher=[[List of newspapers in the Bahamas|The Nassau Guardian]]|accessdate=June 28, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627081222/http://www.thenassauguardian.com/bixex/325682364938194.php|archive-date=2010-06-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribune242.com/searchresults/16082010_nkn-nygard-no-license_news_pg1|title=Nygard Cay is not licensed as commercial property|publisher=The Nassau Tribune|date=August 16, 2010|accessdate=August 31, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822030630/http://www.tribune242.com/searchresults/16082010_nkn-nygard-no-license_news_pg1|archive-date=2010-08-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But a letter from the Bahamian prime minister's office rejected his construction application, citing the improper expansion of his property through intentional accretion of land over the seabed.

On September 28, 2018 Nygård Cay was seized by the Supreme Court of the Bahamas as part of a legal battle surrounding Nygard’s efforts to dredge the sea floor around the estate [https://theworldnews.net/ca-news/peter-nygard-locked-out-of-his-luxury-home-in-bizarre-bahamas-feud]

==Charity==
Nygård has supported the [[Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnwtelbec.com/en/releases/archive/September2007/30/c6818.html?view=print |title=$26.5 million Raised Nationwide as Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation CIBC Run for the Cure Celebrates Sweet Sixteen |publisher=Cnwtelbec.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nygård has been a longtime sponsor of amateur sports in the Bahamas. In June 2010, is the main sponsor of [[Amateur Boxing Federation of the Bahamas]]' team for Continental Elite Boxing Championships Invitation only event slated for June 13–19 in [[Quito]], Ecuador.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribune242.com/sports/06012010_Nygardsponsorship_sports|title=Nygard sponsoring team for 'invitation only' amateur boxing event|publisher=The Tribune|date=June 1, 2010|accessdate=June 29, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717100937/http://www.tribune242.com/sports/06012010_Nygardsponsorship_sports|archive-date=2011-07-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wellington Miller, the president of the [[Bahamas Olympic Committee]], said Nygård has contributed significantly to the Amateur Boxing Association of the Bahamas and their Olympic success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribune242.com/sports/03292011_Gibsonhonored_sports|title=Nygard to sponsor Exuma regatta|publisher=The Tribune|date=March 29, 2011|accessdate=April 13, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315023708/http://www.tribune242.com/sports/03292011_Gibsonhonored_sports|archive-date=2012-03-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Nygård held the "2011 National Family Island Regatta" at Nygård Cay, which included a press conference to honor Bahamian musician "King" [[Eric Gibson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jonesbahamas.com/news/123/ARTICLE/22793/2011-03-28.html|title=Nygard Does It Again, Sponsors National F.I.

==Lawsuits==
Nygård has been accused of [[Abuse|abusive]] labor practices, [[tax evasion]], [[sexual harassment]] and [[rape]].&lt;ref name="FalkenbergForbes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Nygard Answers to No One|last=Falkenberg|first=Kai|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2010/1206/features-peter-nygard-sexual-harassment-answers-to-no-one.html#52f40c70bc9b|date=November 18, 2010|publisher=Forbes Media LLC|access-date=October 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1978, Nygård's takeover of a sportswear designer's business in New York City led to a 12-year legal battle in New York federal court.&lt;ref name="FalkenbergForbes"/&gt;
*In 1980, the ''Free Press'' wrote that Nygård was charged with the rape of an 18-year-old girl by Winnipeg authorities. Later those charges were dropped.&lt;ref name="FalkenbergForbes"/&gt;
*Nygård [[Settlement (litigation)|settled]] sexual harassment complaints by three former employees in Manitoba in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="FalkenbergForbes"/&gt;
*In 1999, Nygård sued [[Linda Brava|Linda Lampenius]] for defamation when she claimed that he hired lookalikes for his [[Oscar party]] and "defrauded the entertainment industry and international press". The case was settled with Lampenius printing an apology in the Finnish press.&lt;ref name="FalkenbergForbes"/&gt;
*In 2003, Nygård was sued in Florida by an American couple who claimed he deceived them into accepting jobs as managers of his Bahamas estate. The case was settled in 2007.&lt;ref name="FalkenbergForbes"/&gt;
*In 2006, Canadian tax authorities claimed Nygård underreported $15&amp;nbsp;million in taxes. Nygård argued that he severed residential ties with Canada in 1975; he was ultimately subject to taxes on an unreported $2&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="FalkenbergForbes"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 2007 with a bit of irritation over runoff has escalated to a battle royal encompassing no fewer than 16 [[Legal action|legal actions]] between Nygård and [[Louis Bacon|Luis Bacon]] and their associates, in which both sides are claiming damages in the tens of millions of dollars and lobbing allegations of activities that include [[vandalism]], [[bribery]], [[insider trading]], [[arson]], [[murder]], destruction of the fragile seabed, and having a close association with the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. Bacon v.

{{refimprove|date=February 2011}}
'''Quality time''' ('''QT''') is an informal reference to [[time]] spent with close [[family]], [[significant other|partners]] or [[friend]]s that is in some way important, special, productive or profitable. It is time that is set aside for paying full and undivided attention to the person or matter at hand. It may also refer to time spent performing some favorite activity.

"Quality time" (''[[noun phrase]]'') is a relatively new expression, in use since the 1970s. One of the earliest records of this phrase in print was in the [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], [[Maryland]] (United States) newspaper ''[[The Capital]]'', January 1973, in the article "How To Be Liberated":
{{quote|The major goal of each of these role changes is to give a woman time to herself, Ms. Burton explained. "A woman's right and responsibility is to be self fulfilling," she said. She gives "quality time" rather than "quantity time" to each task, whether it be writing, cleaning the house or tending the children.}}

Relationship counselor [[Gary_Chapman_(author)|Gary Chapman]] suggests that quality time is one of [[The 5 Love Languages|five "languages"]] which are used (more or less, preferentially, by a given individual) to express love.

In the context of [[artificial neural network]]s, the '''rectifier''' is an [[activation function]] defined as the positive part of its argument:

&lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^+ = \max(0, x)&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''x'' is the input to a neuron. This is also known as a [[ramp function]] and is analogous to [[half-wave rectification]] in electrical engineering. 
This [[activation function]] was first introduced to a dynamical network by Hahnloser et al. in 2000 with strong [[biological]] motivations and mathematical justifications.&lt;ref name="Hahnloser2000"&gt;{{cite journal |first=R. |last=Hahnloser |first2=R. |last2=Sarpeshkar |first3=M.

A unit employing the rectifier is also called a '''rectified linear unit''' ('''ReLU''').&lt;ref name="nair2010"/&gt;

Rectified linear units find applications in [[computer vision]]&lt;ref name="glorot2011"/&gt; and [[speech recognition]]&lt;ref name="tothl2013"&gt;{{cite conference |authors=László Tóth |year=2013 |title=Phone Recognition with Deep Sparse Rectifier Neural Networks |conference=[[International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing|ICASSP]] |url=http://www.inf.u-szeged.hu/~tothl/pubs/ICASSP2013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maas2014"&gt;Andrew L.

== Softplus ==
A smooth approximation to the rectifier is the [[analytic function]]
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \log(1 + e^x),&lt;/math&gt;
which is called the '''softplus''' function.&lt;ref&gt;C. Dugas, Y. Bengio, F. Bélisle,  C. Nadeau, R. Garcia, NIPS'2000, (2001),[http://papers.nips.cc/paper/1920-incorporating-second-order-functional-knowledge-for-better-option-pricing.pdf Incorporating Second-Order Functional Knowledge for Better Option Pricing].&lt;/ref&gt; The derivative of softplus is &lt;math&gt;f'(x) = \frac{e^x}{1 + e^x}= \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[logistic function]]. The logistic function is a smooth approximation of the derivative of the rectifier, the [[Heaviside step function]].

The multivariable generalization of single-variable softplus is the [[LogSumExp]] with the first argument set to zero:
:&lt;math&gt;LSE_0^+(x_1,...,x_n) := LSE(0,x_1,...,x_n) = \log\left(1 + e^{x_1}+ \cdots + e^{x_n} \right).&lt;/math&gt;
The LogSumExp function itself is:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{LSE}(x_1, \dots, x_n) = \log\left( e^{x_1}+ \cdots + e^{x_n} \right),&lt;/math&gt;
and its gradient is the [[softmax function|softmax]]; the softmax with the first argument set to zero is the multivariable generalization of the logistic function. Both LogSumExp and softmax are used in machine learning.

== Variants ==

===Noisy ReLUs===
Rectified linear units can be extended to include [[Gaussian noise]], making them noisy ReLUs, giving&lt;ref name="nair2010"&gt;{{cite conference|authors=Vinod Nair and [[Geoffrey Hinton]]|first=|date=|year=2010|title=Rectified Linear Units Improve Restricted Boltzmann Machines|url=https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/reluICML.pdf|conference=[[International Conference on Machine Learning|ICML]]|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \max(0, x + Y)&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;Y \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma(x))&lt;/math&gt;

Noisy ReLUs have been used with some success in [[restricted Boltzmann machine]]s for computer vision tasks.&lt;ref name="nair2010"/&gt;

=== Leaky ReLUs ===

Leaky ReLUs allow a small, positive gradient when the unit is not active.&lt;ref name="maas2014"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)  = \begin{cases}
    x &amp; \mbox{if } x &gt; 0 \\
    0.01x &amp; \mbox{otherwise}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Parametric ReLUs (PReLUs) take this idea further by making the coefficient of leakage into a parameter that is learned along with the other neural network parameters.&lt;ref name="prelu"&gt;{{cite arxiv  |eprint=1502.01852 |last1=He |first1=Kaiming |title=Delving Deep into Rectifiers: Surpassing Human-Level Performance on Image ''Net'' Classification |last2=Zhang |first2=Xiangyu |last3=Ren |first3=Shaoqing |last4=Sun |first4=Jian |class=cs.CV |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)  = \begin{cases}
    x &amp; \mbox{if } x &gt; 0 \\
    a x &amp; \mbox{otherwise}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
Note that for &lt;math&gt;a\leq1&lt;/math&gt;, this is equivalent to
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)  = \max(x, ax)&lt;/math&gt;
and thus has a relation to "maxout" networks.&lt;ref name="prelu"/&gt;

=== ELUs ===
Exponential linear units try to make the mean activations closer to zero which speeds up learning. It has been shown that ELUs can obtain higher classification accuracy than ReLUs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv  |eprint=1511.07289 |last1=Clevert |first1=Djork-Arné |title=Fast and Accurate Deep Network Learning by Exponential Linear Units (ELUs) |last2=Unterthiner |first2=Thomas |last3=Hochreiter |first3=Sepp |class=cs.LG |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \begin{cases} 
x &amp; \mbox{if } x &gt; 0 \\ 
a(e^x-1) &amp; \mbox{otherwise}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Hyperparameter (machine learning)|hyper-parameter]] to be tuned and &lt;math&gt;a \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; is a constraint.

== Advantages ==

* Biological plausibility: One-sided, compared to the [[Antisymmetric relation|antisymmetry]] of [[tanh]].
* Sparse activation: For example, in a randomly initialized network, only about 50% of hidden units are activated (having a non-zero output).
* Better gradient propagation: Fewer [[Vanishing gradient problem|vanishing gradient]] problems compared to sigmoidal activation functions that saturate in both directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Glorot|first=Xavier|last2=Bordes|first2=Antoine|last3=Bengio|first3=Yoshua|date=2011-06-14|title=Deep Sparse Rectifier Neural Networks|url=http://proceedings.mlr.press/v15/glorot11a.html|journal=PMLR|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Efficient computation: Only comparison, addition and multiplication.
* Scale-invariant: &lt;math&gt;\max(0, ax) = a \max(0, x) \mbox{ for } a \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Rectifying activation functions were used to separate specific excitation and unspecific inhibition in the Neural Abstraction Pyramid, which was trained in a supervised way to learn several computer vision tasks.&lt;ref name=NeuralAbstractionPyramid&gt;{{cite book|last=Behnke|first=Sven|year=2003|title=Hierarchical Neural Networks for Image Interpretation|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220688219_Hierarchical_Neural_Networks_for_Image_Interpretation|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|volume=2766|publisher=Springer|doi= 10.1007/b11963}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011,&lt;ref name="glorot2011"/&gt; the use of the rectifier as a non-linearity has been shown to enable training deep [[Supervised learning|supervised]] neural networks without requiring [[Unsupervised learning|unsupervised]] pre-training. Rectified linear units, compared to [[sigmoid function]] or similar activation functions, allow for faster and effective training of deep neural architectures on large and complex datasets.

== Potential problems ==
* Non-differentiable at zero; however it is differentiable anywhere else, and a value of 0 or 1 can be chosen arbitrarily to fill the point where the input is 0.
* Non-zero centered
* Unbounded
* Dying ReLU problem: ReLU neurons can sometimes be pushed into states in which they become inactive for essentially all inputs. In this state, no gradients flow backward through the neuron, and so the neuron becomes stuck in a perpetually inactive state and "dies." This is a form of the [[vanishing gradient problem]]. In some cases, large numbers of neurons in a network can become stuck in dead states, effectively decreasing the model capacity. This problem typically arises when the learning rate is set too high. It may be mitigated by using Leaky ReLUs instead, which assign a small positive slope to the left of x = 0.

'''Scenario analysis'''  is a process of analyzing possible future events by considering alternative possible outcomes (sometimes called "alternative worlds"). Thus, scenario analysis, which is one of the main forms of projection, does not try to show one exact picture of the future. Instead, it presents several alternative future developments. Consequently, a scope of possible future outcomes is observable. Not only are the outcomes observable, also the development paths leading to the outcomes. In contrast to [[prediction|prognoses]], the scenario analysis is not based on [[extrapolation]] of the past or the extension of past trends. It does not rely on historical data and does not expect past observations to remain valid in the future. Instead, it tries to consider possible developments and turning points, which may only be connected to the past. In short, several scenarios are fleshed out in a scenario analysis to show possible future outcomes. Each scenario normally combines optimistic, pessimistic, and more and less probable developments. However, all aspects of scenarios should be plausible. Although highly discussed, experience has shown that around three scenarios are most appropriate for further discussion and selection. More scenarios risks making the analysis overly complicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aaker|first=David A.|title=Strategic Market Management|year=2001|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York|isbn=0-471-41572-3|pages=108 et seq.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bea, F.X.|first=Haas, J.|title=Strategisches Management|year=2005|publisher=Lucius &amp; Lucius|location=Stuttgart|pages=279 and 287 et seq.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principle ==

Scenario-building is designed to allow improved decision-making by allowing deep consideration of outcomes and their implications.

Scenario analysis can also be used to illuminate "wild cards."  For example, analysis of the possibility of the earth being struck by a meteor suggests that whilst the probability is low, the damage inflicted is so high that the event is much more important (threatening) than the low probability (in any one year) alone would suggest.  However, this possibility is usually disregarded by organizations using scenario analysis to develop a strategic plan since it has such overarching repercussions.

== Applications ==

=== Financial ===
In economics and finance, a financial institution might use scenario analysis to forecast several possible scenarios for the economy (e.g. rapid growth, moderate growth, slow growth) and for financial market returns (for bonds, stocks and cash) in each of those scenarios.  It might consider sub-sets of each of the possibilities.  It might further seek to determine correlations and assign probabilities to the scenarios (and sub-sets if any).  Then it will be in a position to consider how to distribute assets between asset types (i.e. [[asset allocation]]); the institution can also calculate the scenario-weighted expected return (which figure will indicate the overall attractiveness of the financial environment). It may also perform [[stress testing]], using adverse scenarios.&lt;ref name="hassani2016"&gt;"Scenario Analysis in Risk Management", Bertrand Hassani, Published by Springer, 2016, {{ISBN|978-3-319-25056-4}}, [https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319250540]&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the complexity of the problem, scenario analysis can be a demanding exercise.  It can be difficult to foresee what the future holds (e.g. the actual future outcome may be entirely unexpected), i.e. to foresee what the scenarios are, and to assign probabilities to them; and this is true of the general forecasts never mind the implied financial market returns.  The outcomes can be modeled mathematically/statistically e.g. taking account of possible variability within single scenarios as well as possible relationships between scenarios. In general, one should take care when assigning probabilities to different scenarios as this could invite a tendency to consider only the scenario with the highest probability.&lt;ref name="schwartz1996"&gt;''The Art of the Long View: Paths to Strategic Insight for Yourself and Your Company'', Peter Schwartz, Published by Random House, 1996, {{ISBN|0-385-26732-0}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=fILtwg777hsC  Google book]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geopolitical ===

In politics or geopolitics, scenario analysis involves reflecting on the possible alternative paths of a social or political environment and possibly diplomatic and war risks.

== Traditional critique ==

While there is utility in weighting hypotheses and branching potential outcomes from them, reliance on scenario analysis without reporting some parameters of measurement accuracy (standard errors, confidence intervals of estimates, metadata, standardization and coding, weighting for non-response, error in reportage, sample design, case counts, etc.) is a poor second to traditional prediction.  Especially in “complex” problems, factors and assumptions do not correlate in lockstep fashion.  Once a specific sensitivity is undefined, it may call the entire study into question.

It is faulty logic to think, when arbitrating results, that a better hypothesis will render empiricism unnecessary.  In this respect, scenario analysis tries to defer statistical laws (e.g., [[Chebyshev's inequality]] Law), because the decision rules occur outside a constrained setting.  Outcomes are not permitted to “just happen”; rather, they are forced to conform to arbitrary hypotheses ex post, and therefore there is no footing on which to place expected values.  In truth, there are no ex ante expected values, only hypotheses, and one is left wondering about the roles of modeling and data decision.  In short, comparisons of "scenarios" with outcomes are biased by not deferring to the data; this may be convenient, but it is indefensible.

“Scenario analysis” is no substitute for complete and factual exposure of survey error in economic studies.  In traditional prediction, given the data used to model the problem, with a reasoned specification and technique, an analyst can state, within a certain percentage of statistical error, the likelihood of a coefficient being within a certain numerical bound.  This exactitude need not come at the expense of very disaggregated statements of hypotheses.  R Software, specifically the module “WhatIf,”&lt;ref&gt;"[http://gking.harvard.edu/bin/windows/contrib/2.6/WhatIf_1.5-4.zip  WhatIf: Software for Evaluating Counterfactuals]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}", H Stoll, G King, L Zeng - Journal of Statistical Software, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; (in the context, see also Matchit and Zelig) has been developed  for causal inference, and to evaluate counterfactuals. These programs have fairly sophisticated treatments for determining model dependence, in order to state with precision how sensitive the results are to models not based on empirical evidence.

Encyclopædia Britannica 2006 CD. 13 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Soul or psyche ([[Ancient Greek]]: ψυχή ''psūkhḗ'', of ψύχειν ''psū́khein'', "to breathe") are the mental abilities of a living being: reason, character, feeling, consciousness, memory, perception, thinking, etc. Depending on the philosophical system, a soul can either be mortal or [[immortality of the soul|immortal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soul (noun) - Oxford English Dictional (online full edition)|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/185083|website=Oxford English Dictionary (OED)|publisher=Oxford English Dictional (OED)|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Judeo-Christianity]], only human beings have immortal souls (although immortality is disputed within Judaism and may have been influenced by Plato).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/8092-immortality-of-the-soul|title=IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com|access-date=2016-12-14|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220130344/http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/8092-immortality-of-the-soul|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Catholic theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] attributed "soul" (''[[wikt:anima|anima]]'') to all organisms but argued that only human souls are immortal.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Eardley and Carl Still, ''Aquinas: A Guide for the Perplexed'' (London: Continuum, 2010), pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt;

Other religions (most notably [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]]) hold that all living things from the smallest bacterium to the largest of mammals are the souls themselves ([[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]], [[jiva]]) and have their physical representative (the body) in the world. [[Jainism|Jain philosophy]] is the oldest world philosophy that separates body ([[matter]]) from the [[soul]] (consciousness) completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/dravya|title=dravya – Jainism|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual self is the soul, while the body is only a mechanism to experience the karma of that life i.e if we see a tiger then there is a self conscious identity residing in it (the soul), and a physical representative (the whole body of tiger which is observable) in the world. Some teach that even non-biological entities (such as rivers and mountains) possess souls. This belief is called [[animism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080709052029/http://www.bartleby.com/65/so/soul.html "Soul"], ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', Sixth Edition. 2001–07. Retrieved 12 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Greek philosophers, such as [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]], understood that the soul (ψυχή ''[[wikt:ψυχή#Ancient Greek|psūchê]]'') must have a logical faculty, the exercise of which was the most divine of human actions. At his defense trial, Socrates even summarized his teaching as nothing other than an exhortation for his fellow Athenians to excel in matters of the psyche since all bodily goods are dependent on such excellence (''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'' 30a–b).

The current [[scientific consensus|consensus of modern science]] is that there is no evidence to support the existence of the soul when traditionally defined as the spiritual breath of the body. In [[metaphysics]], the concept of "Soul" may be equated with that of "[[Mind]]" in order to refer to the [[consciousness]] and [[intellect]] of the individual.

==Etymology==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
The Modern English word "[[:wikt:soul|soul]]", derived from [[Old English]] ''sáwol, sáwel'', was first attested in the 8th&amp;nbsp;century poem ''[[Beowulf]]'' v. 2820 and in the [[Vespasian Psalter]] 77.50&amp;nbsp;. It is cognate with other German and [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] terms for the same idea, including [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''saiwala'', [[Old High German]] ''sêula, sêla'', [[Old Saxon]] ''sêola'', [[Old Dutch|Old Low Franconian]] ''sêla, sîla'', [[Old Norse]] ''sála'' and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''siela''. Deeper etymology of the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] word is unclear.

The original concept behind the Germanic root is thought to mean “''coming from or belonging to the sea'' (or ''lake'')”, because of the Germanic and pre-Celtic belief in souls emerging from and returning to [[Holy well|sacred lakes]], [[Old Saxon]] ''sêola'' (soul) compared to [[Old Saxon]] ''sêo'' (sea).

==Synonyms==
{{See also|Spirit}}
The [[Koine Greek]] [[Septuagint]] uses {{lang|grc|ψυχή}} (''psyche'') to translate [[biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]] {{lang|he|נפש}} (''[[nephesh]]''), meaning "life, vital breath", and specifically refers to a mortal, physical life, but in English it is variously translated as "soul, self, life, creature, person, appetite, [[mind]], living being, desire, emotion, passion";{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} an example can be found in {{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:21}}:
: Hebrew – {{lang|he |וַיִּבְרָא אֱלֹהִים, אֶת-הַתַּנִּינִם הַגְּדֹלִים; וְאֵת כָּל-נֶפֶשׁ הַחַיָּה הָרֹמֶשֶׂת}}{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}
: Septuagint – {{lang|grc|καὶ ἐποίησεν ὁ θεὸς τὰ κήτη τὰ μεγάλα καὶ πᾶσαν ψυχὴν ζῴων ἑρπετῶν.}}
: [[Vulgate]] – ''{{lang|la|Creavitque Deus cete grandia, et omnem animam viventem atque motabilem.}}
: [[Authorized King James Version]] – "And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth."

The Koine Greek word {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:ψυχή|ψυχή]]}} (''[[psyche (psychology)|psychē]]''), "life, spirit, consciousness", is derived from a verb meaning "to cool, to blow", and hence refers to the breath, as opposed to {{lang|grc|[[wikt:σῶμα|σῶμα]]}} (''soma''), meaning "body".{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} ''Psychē'' occurs juxtaposed to {{lang|grc|σῶμα}}, as seen in {{Bibleverse|Matthew|10:28}}:
: Greek – {{lang|grc|καὶ μὴ φοβεῖσθε ἀπὸ τῶν ἀποκτεννόντων τὸ σῶμα, τὴν δὲ ψυχὴν μὴ δυναμένων ἀποκτεῖναι· φοβεῖσθε δὲ μᾶλλον τὸν δυνάμενον καὶ ψυχὴν καὶ σῶμα ἀπολέσαι ἐν γεέννῃ.}}
: Vulgate – ''{{lang|la|et nolite timere eos qui occidunt corpus animam autem non possunt occidere sed potius eum timete qui potest et animam et corpus perdere in gehennam.}}''
: Authorized King James Version (KJV) – "And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell."

[[Paul the Apostle]] used ψυχή (''psychē'') and {{lang|grc|[[pneuma|πνεῦμα]]}} (''pneuma'') specifically to distinguish between the Jewish notions of {{lang|he|נפש}} (''nephesh'') and {{lang|he|רוח}} ''[[ruach|ruah]]'' (spirit){{citation needed|date=October 2017}} (also in the Septuagint, e.g. {{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:2}} {{lang|he|רוּחַ אֱלֹהִים}} = {{lang|grc|πνεῦμα θεοῦ}} = ''{{lang|la|spiritus Dei}}'' = "the Spirit of God").

[[File:Souls of Pe and Nekhen towing at Ramses' Temple in Abydos c.jpg|thumb|left|The [[souls of Pe and Nekhen]] towing the royal bargue on a relief of [[Ramesses II]]'s temple in Abydos.]]
In the [[ancient Egyptian religion]], an individual was believed to be made up of various elements, some physical and some spiritual. Similar ideas are found in ancient Assyrian and Babylonian religion. [[Kuttamuwa]], an 8th-century BC royal official from [[Sam'al]], ordered an inscribed [[stele]] erected upon his death. The inscription requested that his mourners commemorate his life and his [[afterlife]] with feasts "for my soul that is in this stele". It is one of the earliest references to a soul as a separate entity from the body. The {{convert|800|lb|adj=on}} [[basalt]] stele is {{convert|3|ft|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|2|ft|abbr=on}} wide. It was uncovered in the third season of excavations by the Neubauer Expedition of the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute]] in Chicago, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Found: An Ancient Monument to the Soul |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/18/science/18soul.html?8dpc=&amp;_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all |quote=In a mountainous kingdom in what is now southeastern Turkey, there lived in the eighth century B.C. a royal official, Kuttamuwa, who oversaw the completion of an inscribed stone monument, or stele, to be erected upon his death.

===Bahá'í===
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] affirms that "the soul is a sign of God, a heavenly gem whose reality the most learned of men hath failed to grasp, and whose mystery no mind, however acute, can ever hope to unravel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bahá'u'lláh |authorlink=Bahá'u'lláh |year=1976 |title=Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-87743-187-6 |pages=158–163 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/gwb-82.html#gr1 |accessdate=2016-02-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303214835/http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/gwb-82.html#gr1 |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bahá'u'lláh]] stated that the soul not only continues to live after the physical death of the human body, but is, in fact, immortal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bahá'u'lláh |authorlink=Bahá'u'lláh |year=1976 |title=Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-87743-187-6 |pages=155–158 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/gwb-81.html#gr1 |accessdate=2016-02-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304104955/http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/gwb-81.html#gr1 |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heaven can be seen partly as the soul's state of nearness to God; and hell as a state of remoteness from God. Each state follows as a natural consequence of individual efforts, or the lack thereof, to develop spiritually.&lt;ref name="rob1"&gt;{{cite book |author= Taherzadeh, Adib |authorlink= Adib Taherzadeh |year= 1976 |title= The Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh, Volume 1 |publisher= George Ronald |location= Oxford, UK |isbn= 0-85398-270-8 |url= http://www.peyman.info/cl/Baha%27i/Others/ROB/V1/Contents.html |accessdate= 2016-02-23 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160303191017/http://www.peyman.info/cl/Baha'i/Others/ROB/V1/Contents.html |archivedate= 3 March 2016 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'u'lláh taught that individuals have no existence prior to their life here on earth and the soul's evolution is always towards God and away from the material world.&lt;ref name="rob1"/&gt;

===Buddhism===
[[Buddhism]] teaches that all things are in a constant state of flux: all is changing, and no [[wikt:permanent|permanent]] state exists by itself.&lt;ref&gt;Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught'' (NY: Grove, 1962), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sources of Indian Tradition'', vol. 1, ed. Theodore de Bary (NY: Columbia UP, 1958), p. 92-93&lt;/ref&gt; This applies to human beings as much as to anything else in the cosmos. Thus, a human being has no permanent self.&lt;ref&gt;Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught'' (NY: Grove, 1962), p. 55-57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sources of Indian Tradition'', vol. 1, ed. Theodore de Bary (NY: Columbia UP, 1958), p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; According to this doctrine of ''anatta'' (Pāli; Sanskrit: ''anātman'') – "no-self" or "no soul" – the words "I" or "me" do not refer to any fixed thing. They are simply convenient terms that allow us to refer to an ever-changing entity.&lt;ref&gt;Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught'' (NY: Grove, 1962), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''anatta'' doctrine is not a kind of [[materialism]]. Buddhism does not deny the existence of "immaterial" entities, and it (at least traditionally) distinguishes bodily states from mental states.&lt;ref&gt;''Sources of Indian Tradition'', vol. 1, ed. Theodore de Bary (NY: Columbia UP, 1958), p. 93-94&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the conventional translation of ''anatta'' as "no-soul"&lt;ref&gt;for example, in Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught'' (NY: Grove, 1962), p. 51-66&lt;/ref&gt; can be confusing. If the word "soul" simply refers to an incorporeal component in living things that can continue after death, then Buddhism does not deny the existence of the soul.&lt;ref name="Indian Tradition 1958 p. 94"&gt;''Sources of Indian Tradition'', vol. 1, ed. Theodore de Bary (NY: Columbia UP, 1958), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Buddhism denies the existence of a permanent entity that remains constant behind the changing corporeal and incorporeal components of a living being. Just as the body changes from moment to moment, so thoughts come and go, and there is no permanent state underlying the mind that experiences these thoughts, as in [[Cartesianism]]. Conscious mental states simply arise and perish with no "thinker" behind them.&lt;ref&gt;Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught'' (NY: Grove, 1962), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; When the body dies, Buddhists believe the incorporeal mental processes continue and are reborn in a new body.&lt;ref name="Indian Tradition 1958 p. 94"/&gt; Because the mental processes are constantly changing, the being that is reborn is neither entirely different from, nor exactly the same as, the being that died.&lt;ref&gt;Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught'' (NY: Grove, 1962), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; However, the new being is ''continuous'' with the being that died – in the same way that the "you" of this moment is continuous with the "you" of a moment before, despite the fact that you are constantly changing.&lt;ref&gt;Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught'' (NY: Grove, 1962), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhist teaching holds that a notion of a permanent, abiding self is a delusion that is one of the causes of human conflict on the emotional, social, and political levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Conze |first= Edward |authorlink= Edward Conze |title= A Short History of Buddhism |year=1993 |publisher= Oneworld |isbn=1-85168-066-7 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught'' (NY: Grove, 1962), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; They add that an understanding of ''anatta'' provides an accurate description of the human condition, and that this understanding allows us to pacify our mundane [[desire (philosophy)|desire]]s.

Various schools of Buddhism have differing ideas about what continues after death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-MAG/45144_2.htm |title=六朝神滅不滅論與佛教輪迴主體之研究 |publisher=Ccbs.ntu.edu.tw |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313160542/http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-MAG/45144_2.htm |archivedate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yogacara]] school in [[Mahayana]] Buddhism said there are [[Store consciousness]] which continue to exist after death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-AN/an162621.htm |title=佛教心理論之發達觀 |publisher=Ccbs.ntu.edu.tw |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313160549/http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-AN/an162621.htm |archivedate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some schools, particularly [[Tibetan Buddhism]], the view is that there are three minds: ''very subtle mind'', which does not disintegrate in death; ''subtle mind'', which disintegrates in death and which is "dreaming mind" or "unconscious mind"; and ''gross mind'', which does not exist when one is ''sleeping''. Therefore, ''gross mind'' is less permanent than subtle mind, which does not exist in death. ''Very subtle mind'', however, does continue, and when it "catches on", or coincides with phenomena, again, a new ''subtle mind'' emerges, with its own personality/assumptions/habits, and ''that'' entity experiences [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]] in the current continuum.

Certain modern Buddhists, particularly in [[Western world|Western countries]], reject—or at least take an agnostic stance toward—the concept of rebirth or reincarnation. [[Stephen Batchelor (agnostic)|Stephen Batchelor]] discusses this in his book ''Buddhism Without Beliefs''. Others point to [[reincarnation research|research]] that has been conducted at the [[University of Virginia]] as proof that some people are reborn.&lt;ref&gt;[[B.

===Christianity===
{{See also|Soul in the Bible|Christian mortalism}}
[[File:SoulCarriedtoHeaven.jpg|thumb|Soul carried to Heaven by [[William Bouguereau]]]]
Most Christians understand the soul as an [[ontology|ontological]] reality distinct from, yet integrally connected with, the body. Its characteristics are described in moral, spiritual, and philosophical terms. [[Richard Swinburne]], a Christian [[philosophy of religion|philosopher of religion]] at Oxford University, wrote that "it is a frequent criticism of substance dualism that [[Mind-body dualism|dualists]] cannot say what souls are. Souls are immaterial subjects of mental properties. They have sensations and thoughts, desires and beliefs, and perform intentional actions. Souls are essential parts of human beings". According to a common [[Christian eschatology]], when people die, their souls will be [[particular judgment|judged by God]] and determined to go to [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]] or to [[Hell in Christianity|Hell]]. Though all branches of Christianity – Catholics, [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], [[Church of the East]], [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]], and [[mainline Protestant]]s – teach that Jesus Christ plays a decisive role in the [[Christian salvation]] process, the specifics of that role and the part played by individual persons or [[ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] rituals and relationships, is a matter of wide diversity in official church teaching, theological speculation and popular practice. Some Christians believe that if one has not repented of one's sins and has not trusted in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, he/she will go to [[Christian views on Hell|Hell]] and suffer eternal [[damnation]] or eternal separation from God. Some hold a belief that babies (including the unborn) and those with cognitive or mental impairments who have died will be received into [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]] on the basis of God's grace through the sacrifice of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Doctrine and Covenants|last=Smith|first=Joseph|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints|year=1981|isbn=1592975038|location=Salt Lake City, Utah, United States of America|pages=286|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Christians understand the soul as the life, and believe that the dead are sleeping ([[Christian conditionalism]]). This belief is traditionally accompanied by the belief that the unrighteous soul will cease to exist instead of suffering eternally ([[annihilationism]]). Believers will inherit [[eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]] either in [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]], or in a [[Kingdom of God]] on earth, and enjoy eternal fellowship with God.

There are also beliefs in [[universal salvation]].

====Trichotomy of the soul====
[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], one of western Christianity's most influential early Christian thinkers, described the soul as "a special substance, endowed with reason, adapted to rule the body". Some Christians espouse a [[trichotomy (philosophy)|trichotomic]] view of humans, which characterizes humans as consisting of a body (''soma''), soul (''psyche''), and spirit (''pneuma'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm |title=Soul |publisher=newadvent.org |date=1 July 1912 |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128201145/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm |archivedate=28 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the majority of modern Bible scholars point out how spirit and soul are used interchangeably in many biblical passages, and so hold to dichotomy: the view that each of us is body and soul. Paul said that the "body wars against" the soul, "For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit" (Heb 4:12 NASB), and that "I buffet my body", to keep it under control.
Trichotomy was changed to dichotomy as tenet of Christian faith at the Council of Constantinople in 869 regarded as the 8th Ecumenical Council by Roman Catholics.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

====Origin of the soul====
The 'origin of the soul' has provided a vexing question in Christianity. The major theories put forward include [[creationism (soul)|soul creationism]], [[traducianism]], and [[pre-existence]]. According to creationism, each individual soul is created directly by God, either at the moment of conception or some later time. According to traducianism, the soul comes from the parents by natural generation. According to the preexistence theory, the soul exists before the moment of conception. There have been differing thoughts regarding whether human [[embryo]]s have souls from conception, or there is a point between conception and birth where the [[fetus]] [[ensoulment|acquires a soul]], [[consciousness]], and/or [[personhood]]. Stances in this question might more or less influence judgements on the [[Christianity and abortion|morality of abortion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/medical_ethics/me0116.htm |title="Do Embryos Have Souls?", Father Tadeusz Pacholczyk, PhD, Catholic Education Resource Center |publisher=Catholiceducation.org |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629203818/http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/medical_ethics/me0116.htm |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Matthew Syed |date=12 May 2008 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article3912708.ece |title=Embryos have souls?

====Various denominations====

Protestants generally believe in the soul's existence, but fall into two major camps about what this means in terms of an [[afterlife]]. Some, following [[Jean Calvin|Calvin]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Helm]], ''John Calvin's Ideas'' 2006 p129 "The Immortality of the Soul: As we saw when discussing Calvin's Christology, Calvin is a substance dualist."&lt;/ref&gt; believe in the [[immortality of the soul]] and conscious existence after death, while others, following [[Martin Luther|Luther]],&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Grafton, Glenn W. Most, Salvatore Settis ''The Classical Tradition'' 2010 p480 "On several occasions, Luther mentioned contemptuously that the Council Fathers had decreed the soul immortal."&lt;/ref&gt; believe in the [[mortality of the soul]] and unconscious "sleep" until the [[resurrection of the dead]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Marius ''Martin Luther: the Christian between God and death'' 1999 p429 "Luther, believing in soul sleep at death, held here that in the moment of resurrection... the righteous will rise to meet Christ in the air, the ungodly will remain on earth for judgment,..."&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[new religious movement]]s derived from Adventism—including [[Christadelphians]],&lt;ref&gt;''Birmingham Amended Statement of Faith''.

The [[Hindu philosophy|six orthodox schools of Hinduism]] believe that there is Ātman (self, essence) in every being, a major point of difference with [[Buddhism]], which does not believe that there is either soul or self.&lt;ref name=4sources&gt;KN Jayatilleke (2010), Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, {{ISBN|978-8120806191}}, pages 246-249, from note 385 onwards; Steven Collins (1994), Religion and Practical Reason (Editors: Frank Reynolds, David Tracy), State Univ of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791422175}}, page 64; "Central to Buddhist soteriology is the doctrine of not-self (Pali: anattā, Sanskrit: anātman, the opposed doctrine of ātman is central to Brahmanical thought).

In [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]], a ''jiva'' ({{lang-sa|जीव}}, {{IAST|jīva}}, alternative spelling ''jiwa''; {{lang-hi|जीव}}, {{IAST|jīv}}, alternative spelling ''jeev'') is a living being, or any entity imbued with a life force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Matthew Hall|title=Plants as Persons: A Philosophical Botany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SqzkqnETEVYC|year=2011|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-1-4384-3430-8|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jainism, ''jiva'' is the immortal essence or soul of a living organism (human, animal, fish or plant etc.) which survives physical death.&lt;ref name=jajinixxii/&gt; The concept of ''Ajiva'' in Jainism means "not soul", and represents matter (including body), time, space, non-motion and motion.&lt;ref name=jajinixxii&gt;{{cite book|author=J Jaini|title=Outlines Of Jainism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=54A9AAAAIAAJ|year=1940|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=xxii–xxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Jainism, a ''Jiva'' is either ''samsari'' (mundane, caught in cycle of rebirths) or ''mukta'' (liberated).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qN82XwAACAAJ|title=Gommatsara Jiva-kanda|first1=Jagmandar-lāl|last1=Jaini|archive-url=https://archive.org/download/sacredbooksofthe029558mbp|archive-date=2006|year=1927|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-94-024-0852-2_100397|title=Buddhism and Jainism|last=|first=|date=2017|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789402408515|editor-last=Sarao|editor-first=K.

The concept of ''jiva'' in Jainism is similar to ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'' in Hinduism. However, some Hindu traditions differentiate between the two concepts, with ''jiva'' considered as individual self, while atman as that which is universal unchanging self that is present in all living beings and everything else as the metaphysical [[Brahman]].&lt;ref name=varenne46&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean Varenne|title=Yoga and the Hindu Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=meUWxDDqzuAC&amp;pg=PA46|year=1989|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0543-9|pages=45–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Myers|title=Brahman: A Comparative Theology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xfvaAAAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-83565-0|pages=140–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kO8-980xGk8C&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=hiranyagarba&amp;ei=gCnrSaGyLZLQMu3AmaQB ''The Philosophy of Person: Solidarity and Cultural Creativity'', Jozef Tichner and George McClean, 1994, p. 32]&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is sometimes referred to as ''jiva-atman'' (a soul in a living body).&lt;ref name=varenne46/&gt;
According to [[Brahma Kumaris]], the soul is an eternal point of light.

===Islam===
{{Main|Rūḥ|Nafs}}
The [[Quran]], the holy book of [[Islam]], distinguishes between the immortal ''[[rūḥ]]'' (spirit or "soul") and the mortal ''[[nafs]]'' (psyche).&lt;ref name=Talib&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Deuraseh |first1 = Nurdeen |last2 = Abu Talib |first2 = Mansor |year = 2005 |title = Mental health in Islamic medical tradition |url = |journal = The International Medical Journal |volume = 4 |issue = 2 |pages = 76–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; The immortal rūḥ "drives" the mortal nafs, which comprises temporal desires and perceptions necessary for living.&lt;ref name="Ahmad"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ahmad |first=Sultan |title=Islam In Perspective |chapter=''Nafs:'' What Is it? |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YxT_3zlWc-UC&amp;pg=PA180 |edition=revised |publisher=Author House |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-4490-3993-6 |page=180 |via=Google Books |access-date=2017-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the passages in the Quran that mention ''rûh'' occur in chapters 17 ("The Night Journey") and 39 ("The Throngs"):
{{quote|And they ask you, [O Muhammad], about the spirit [''rûh'']. Say, "The spirit is of the affair of my Lord. And mankind has not been given of knowledge except a little.|Quran 17:85}}

===Jainism===
{{Main|Jīva (Jainism)|Vitalism (Jainism)}}
{{Further|Jain philosophy|Jainism and non-creationism}}
In Jainism, every living being, from plant or bacterium to human, has a soul and the concept forms the very basis of Jainism. According to Jainism, there is no beginning or end to the existence of soul. It is eternal in nature and changes its form until it attains liberation.

The soul ''([[Jīva (Jainism)|Jīva]])'' is basically categorized in one of two ways based on its present state.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}
# Liberated Souls – These are souls which have attained liberation (''[[moksha]]'') and never become part of the life cycle again.
# Non-Liberated Souls – The souls of any living being which are stuck in the life cycle of 4 forms; ''Manushya Gati'' (Human Being), ''Tiryanch Gati'' (Any other living being), ''Dev Gati'' (Heaven) and ''Narak Gati'' (Hell).

Until the time the soul is liberated from the ''[[Saṃsāra (Jainism)|saṃsāra]]'' (cycle of repeated birth and death), it gets attached to one of these bodies based on the [[Karma in Jainism|karma]] (actions) of the individual soul. Irrespective of which state the soul is in, it has got the same attributes and qualities. The difference between the liberated and non-liberated souls is that the qualities and attributes are manifested completely in case of ''[[siddha]]'' (liberated soul) as they have overcome all the karmic bondages whereas in case of non-liberated souls they are partially exhibited.

Concerning the Jain view of the soul, [[Virchand Gandhi]] said
{{quote|the soul lives its own life, not for the purpose of the body, but the body lives for the purpose of the soul. If we believe that the soul is to be controlled by the body then soul misses its power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forgotten Gandhi, Virchand Gandhi (1864-1901) - Advocate of Universal Brotherhood |url=http://www.all-famous-quotes.com/Virchand_Gandhi_quotes.html |publisher=All Famous Quotes |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921112719/http://www.all-famous-quotes.com/Virchand_Gandhi_quotes.html |archivedate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Judaism===
{{Primary sources|date=April 2018}}
The [[Hebrew]] terms {{Hebrew|נפש}} ''[[nephesh|nefesh]]'' (literally "living being"), {{Hebrew|רוח}} ''[[ruach]]'' (literally "wind"), {{Hebrew|נשמה}} ''neshamah'' (literally "breath"), {{Hebrew|חיה}} ''chayah'' (literally "life") and {{Hebrew|יחידה}} ''yechidah'' (literally "singularity") are used to describe the soul or spirit.&lt;ref&gt;''Zohar'', ''Rayah Mehemna'', ''Terumah'' 158b.  See Leibowitz, Aryeh (2018). ''The Neshamah: A Study of the Human Soul''. Feldheim Publishers. Pages 27 and 110. {{ISBN|1680253387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Judaism]] the soul was believed to be given by God to Adam as mentioned in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], {{quote|Then the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.|{{Bibleverse|Genesis|2:7|JPR}}}}

Judaism relates the quality of one's soul to one's performance of the commandments (''[[mitzvot]])'' and reaching higher levels of understanding, and thus closeness to God. A person with such closeness is called a ''[[tzadik]]''. Therefore, Judaism embraces the commemoration of the day of one's death, ''[[Yartzeit|nahala]]''/''Yahrtzeit'' and not the [[birthday]]&lt;ref&gt;The only person mentioned in the [[Torah]] celebrating birthday (party) is the wicked [[pharaoh]] of Egypt {{Bibleverse|Genesis|40:20-22|JPR}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as a festivity of remembrance, for only toward the end of life's struggles, tests and challenges could human souls be judged and credited for righteousness.&lt;ref name="rebchaim birthday"&gt;{{cite web|last=HaQoton|first=Reb Chaim|title=Happy Birthday|url=http://rchaimqoton.blogspot.de/2007/04/happy-birthday.html|publisher=Reb Chaim HaQoton|accessdate=11 July 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109001613/http://rchaimqoton.blogspot.de/2007/04/happy-birthday.html|archivedate=9 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aish birthday"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Jewish Birthdays|url=http://www.aish.com/jl/l/ms/47139952.html|work=Judaism 101|publisher=Aish.com|accessdate=11 July 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822100333/http://www.aish.com/jl/l/ms/47139952.html|archivedate=22 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judaism places great importance on the study of the souls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13933-soul|title=SOUL - JewishEncyclopedia.com|publisher=jewishencyclopedia.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308035611/http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13933-soul|archivedate=8 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kabbalah]] and other mystic traditions go into greater detail into the nature of the soul. Kabbalah separates the soul into five elements, corresponding to the [[five worlds]]:

# [[Nephesh|Nefesh]], related to natural instinct.
# [[Ruach]], related to emotion and morality.
# Neshamah, related to intellect and the awareness of God.
# Chayah, considered a part of God, as it were.
# [[Yechidah]].  This aspect is essentially one with God.

Kabbalah also proposed a concept of reincarnation, the ''[[gilgul]]''. (See also ''[[nefesh habehamit]]'' the "animal soul".)

===Scientology===
The [[Scientology]] view is that a person does not have a soul, it is a soul. A person is immortal, and may be reincarnated if they wish. The Scientology term for the soul is "[[thetan]]", derived from the Greek word "theta", symbolizing thought. Scientology counselling (called [[auditing]]) addresses the soul to improve abilities, both worldly and spiritual.

===Shamanism===
According to Nadya Yuguseva, a shaman from the Altai, "A woman has 40 souls; men have just one".&lt;ref&gt;

===Sikhism===
[[Sikhism]] considers soul (''atma'') to be part of God ([[Waheguru]]). Various hymns are cited from the holy book [[Guru Granth Sahib]] (SGGS) that suggests this belief. "God is in the Soul and the Soul is in the God."&lt;ref&gt;SGGS, M 1, p 1153.&lt;/ref&gt; The same concept is repeated at various pages of the SGGS. For example: "The soul is divine; divine is the soul. Worship Him with love."&lt;ref&gt;SGGS, M 4, p 1325.&lt;/ref&gt; and "The soul is the Lord, and the Lord is the soul; contemplating the Shabad, the Lord is found."&lt;ref&gt;SGGS, M 1, p 1030.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''atma'' or soul according to Sikhism is an entity or "spiritual spark" or "light" in our body because of which the body can sustain life. On the departure of this entity from the body, the body becomes lifeless – No amount of manipulations to the body can make the person make any physical actions. The soul is the ‘driver’ in the body. It is the ''roohu'' or spirit or ''atma'', the presence of which makes the physical body alive.

Many religious and philosophical traditions support the view that the soul is the ethereal substance – a spirit; a non material spark – particular to a unique living being. Such traditions often consider the soul both immortal and innately aware of its immortal nature, as well as the true basis for sentience in each living being. The concept of the soul has strong links with notions of an afterlife, but opinions may vary wildly even within a given religion as to what happens to the soul after death. Many within these religions and philosophies see the soul as immaterial, while others consider it possibly material.

===Taoism===
According to Chinese traditions, every person has two types of soul called [[hun and po]] (魂 and 魄), which are respectively [[yin and yang|yang and yin]]. [[Taoism]] believes in ten souls, ''sanhunqipo'' ([[:zh:三魂七魄|三魂七魄]]) "three ''hun'' and seven ''po''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deathreference.com/Ce-Da/Chinese-Beliefs.html |title=Encyclopedia of Death and Dying (2008) |publisher=Deathreference.com |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105103959/http://www.deathreference.com/Ce-Da/Chinese-Beliefs.html |archivedate=5 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pò is linked to the dead body and the grave, whereas the hún is linked to the ancestral tablet.

&lt;!-- {{Main|Salvation|Soul sleep}} No, [[Salvation]] and [[Soul sleep]] are not the "main articles" for "Life and death", as this former article section has been called. Any connections between these terms should be made explicit in the text. At the very least, [[Template:Seealso]] would be more appropriate than [[Template:Main]]. --&gt;
In theological reference to the soul, the terms "life" and "death" are viewed as emphatically more definitive than the common concepts of "[[life|biological life]]" and "biological death". Because the soul is said to be transcendent of the ''[[matter|material]] existence,'' and is said to have (potentially) [[immortality|eternal life]], the death of the soul is likewise said to be an ''eternal death''. Thus, in the concept of [[divine judgment]], God is commonly said to have options with regard to the dispensation of souls, ranging from [[Heaven]] (i.e., [[angel]]s) to [[hell]] (i.e., [[demon]]s), with various concepts in between. Typically both Heaven and hell are said to be eternal, or at least far beyond a typical human concept of [[life expectancy|lifespan]] and time.

===Spirituality, New Age, and new religions===

====Brahma Kumaris====
In [[Brahma Kumaris]], human souls are believed to be incorporeal and [[eternity|eternal]]. God is considered to be the Supreme Soul, with maximum degrees of spiritual qualities, such as peace, love and purity.&lt;ref name="Ramsay_Possession"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Theosophy====
In [[Helena Blavatsky]]'s [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], the soul is the field of our psychological activity (thinking, emotions, memory, desires, will, and so on) as well as of the so-called paranormal or [[psychic]] phenomena (extrasensory perception, out-of-body experiences, etc.). However, the soul is not the highest, but a middle dimension of human beings. Higher than the soul is the spirit, which is considered to be the real self; the source of everything we call "good"—happiness, wisdom, love, compassion, harmony, peace, etc. While the spirit is eternal and incorruptible, the soul is not. The soul acts as a link between the material body and the spiritual self, and therefore shares some characteristics of both. The soul can be attracted either towards the spiritual or towards the material realm, being thus the "battlefield" of good and evil. It is only when the soul is attracted towards the spiritual and merges with the Self that it becomes eternal and divine.

====Anthroposophy====
[[Rudolf Steiner]] differentiated three stages of soul development, which interpenetrate one another in consciousness:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Creeger|first=Rudolf Steiner; translated by Catherine E.|title=Theosophy: an introduction to the spiritual processes in human life and in the cosmos|year=1994|publisher=Anthroposophic Press|location=Hudson, NY|isbn=0-88010-373-6|pages=42–46|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The "sentient soul", centering on sensations, drives, and passions, with strong [[conation|conative]] (will) and emotional components;
*The "intellectual" or "mind soul", internalizing and reflecting on outer experience, with strong affective (feeling) and cognitive (thinking) components; and
*The "consciousness soul", in search of universal, objective truths.

====Miscellaneous====
In [[Surat Shabd Yoga|Surat Shabda Yoga]], the soul is considered to be an exact replica and spark of the Divine. The purpose of Surat Shabd Yoga is to realize one's True Self as soul (Self-Realisation), True Essence (Spirit-Realisation) and True Divinity (God-Realisation) while living in the physical body.

Similarly, the spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] held that "Atma, or the soul, is in reality identical with Paramatma the Oversoul — which is one, infinite, and eternal...[and] [t]he sole purpose of creation is for the soul to enjoy the infinite state of the Oversoul consciously."&lt;ref&gt;Baba, Meher. (1987). ''Discourses.'' Myrtle Beach, SC: Sheriar Press. p. 222. {{ISBN|978-1880619094}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical views==
The [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] used the word "[[Ensoulment|ensouled]]" to represent the concept of being "alive", indicating that the earliest surviving [[western philosophy|western philosophical]] view believed that the soul was that which gave the body life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2009/entries/ancient-soul/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Lorenz|first=Hendrik|date=2009|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soul was considered the incorporeal or spiritual "breath" that animates (from the Latin, ''[[:wikt:anima|anima]]'', cf. "animal") the living organism.

[[F. M. Cornford|Francis M. Cornford]] quotes [[Pindar]] by saying that the soul sleeps while the limbs are active, but when one is sleeping, the soul is active and reveals "an award of joy or sorrow drawing near" in dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Francis M. Cornford, ''Greek Religious Thought'', p.64, referring to Pindar, Fragment 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erwin Rohde]] writes that an early pre-[[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] belief presented the soul as lifeless when it departed the body, and that it retired into [[Hades]] with no hope of returning to a body.&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Rohde, ''Psyche'', 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socrates and Plato&lt;!--Linked from 'Emanationism'--&gt;===
[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Plato]] (left) and [[Aristotle]] (right), a detail of ''[[The School of Athens]]'', a [[fresco]] by [[Raphael]].]]
{{Main|Plato's tripartite theory of soul}}
Drawing on the words of his teacher Socrates, Plato considered the psyche to be the [[essence]] of a person, being that which decides how we behave. He considered this essence to be an incorporeal, eternal occupant of our being. Plato says that even after death, the soul exists and is able to think. He believed that as bodies die, the soul is continually reborn in subsequent bodies. However, Aristotle believed that only one part of the soul was immortal namely the intellect (''[[Logos#Ancient Greek philosophy|logos]]''). The Platonic soul consists of three parts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Gift of Logos: Essays in Continental Philosophy|last = Jones|first = David|publisher = Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year = 2009|isbn = |location = |pages = 33–35|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1RgaBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=plato+soul+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjL-or46rPJAhVU_mMKHUQ-C48Q6AEIRjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=plato%20soul%20logos&amp;f=false|accessdate = 2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# the ''logos'', or ''logistikon'' (mind, [[nous]], or [[reason]])
# the ''[[Thumos|thymos]]'', or ''thumetikon'' ([[emotion]], spiritedness, or masculine)
# the ''[[Eros (concept)|eros]]'', or ''epithumetikon'' (appetitive, [[motivation|desire]], or feminine)

The parts are located in different regions of the body:
# ''logos'' is located in the head, is related to reason and regulates the other part.
# ''thymos'' is located near the chest region and is related to anger.
# ''eros'' is located in the stomach and is related to one's desires.

Plato also compares the three parts of the soul or psyche to a societal [[Plato's tripartite theory of soul|caste system]]. According to Plato's theory, the three-part soul is essentially the same thing as a state's class system because, to function well, each part must contribute so that the whole functions well. Logos keeps the other functions of the soul regulated.

===Aristotle===
[[File:Aristotelian Soul.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The structure of the souls of plants, animals, and humans, according to [[Aristotle]], with ''Bios'', ''Zoê'', and ''Psūchê'']]
Aristotle (384 BCE – 322 BCE) defined the soul, or ''Psūchê'' (ψυχή), as the "[[first actuality]]" of a naturally organized body,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aristotle|title=On The Soul|pages=412b5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and argued against its separate existence from the physical body. In Aristotle's view, the primary activity, or full actualization, of a living thing constitutes its soul. For example, the full actualization of an eye, as an independent organism, is to see (its purpose or [[final cause]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aristotle |title=Physics |at=Book VIII, Chapter 5, pages 256a5-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is that the full actualization of a human being would be living a fully functional human life in accordance with reason (which he considered to be a faculty unique to humanity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aristotle |title=Nicomachean Ethics |at=Book I, Chapter 7, pages 1098a7-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Aristotle, the soul is the organization of the form and matter of a natural being which allows it to strive for its full actualization. This organization between form and matter is necessary for any activity, or functionality, to be possible in a natural being. Using an artifact (non-natural being) as an example, a house is a building for human habituation, but for a house to be actualized requires the material (wood, nails, bricks, etc.) necessary for its actuality (i.e. being a fully functional house). However, this does not imply that a house has a soul. In regards to artifacts, the source of motion that is required for their full actualization is outside of themselves (for example, a builder builds a house). In natural beings, this source of motion is contained within the being itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aristotle |title=Physics |at=Book III, Chapter 1, pages 201a10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle elaborates on this point when he addresses the faculties of the soul.

The various [[faculties of the soul]], such as nutrition, movement (peculiar to animals), reason (peculiar to humans), sensation (special, common, and incidental) and so forth, when exercised, constitute the "second" actuality, or fulfillment, of the capacity to be alive. For example, someone who falls asleep, as opposed to someone who falls dead, can wake up and live their life, while the latter can no longer do so.

Aristotle identified three hierarchical levels of natural beings: plants, animals, and people, having three different degrees of soul: ''Bios'' (life), ''Zoë'' (animate life), and ''Psuchë'' (self-conscious life). For these groups, he identified three corresponding levels of soul, or biological activity: the nutritive activity of growth, sustenance and reproduction which all life shares (''Bios''); the self-willed motive activity and sensory faculties, which only animals and people have in common (''Zoë''); and finally "reason", of which people alone are capable (''Pseuchë'').

Aristotle's discussion of the soul is in his work, ''De Anima'' (''[[On the Soul]]''). Although mostly seen as opposing Plato in regard to the immortality of the soul, a controversy can be found in relation to the fifth chapter of the third book: In this text both interpretations can be argued for, soul as a whole can be deemed mortal, and a part called "active intellect" or "active mind" is immortal and eternal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aristotle |title=On The Soul |at=Book III, Chapter 5, pages 430a24-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates exist for both sides of the controversy, but it has been understood that there will be permanent disagreement about its final conclusions, as no other [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] text contains this specific point, and this part of ''De Anima'' is obscure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-psychology/active-mind.html |title=Aristotle's Psychology |chapter=supplement: The Active Mind of De Anima iii 5) |accessdate=2013-12-12 |author=Shields, Christopher |year=2011 |publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Aristotle states that the soul helps humans find the truth and understanding the true purpose or role of the soul is extremely difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{dite book |title=Introduction to Aristotle |last=Smith |first=J. S. (Trans) |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1973 |location=Chicago |pages=155–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Avicenna and Ibn al-Nafis===
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2014}}
Following Aristotle, [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina) and [[Ibn al-Nafis]], a [[list of Persian philosophers|Persian philosopher]], further elaborated upon the Aristotelian understanding of the soul and developed their own theories on the soul. They both made a distinction between the soul and the spirit, and the [[Avicennism|Avicennian]] doctrine on the nature of the soul was influential among the [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]]. Some of Avicenna's views on the soul include the idea that the immortality of the soul is a consequence of its nature, and not a purpose for it to fulfill. In his theory of "The Ten Intellects", he viewed the human soul as the tenth and final [[intelligence|intellect]].

While he was imprisoned, Avicenna wrote his famous "Floating Man" [[thought experiment]] to demonstrate human [[self-awareness]] and the substantial nature of the soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artandpopularculture.com/Floating_Man|title=Floating Man - The Art and Popular Culture Encyclopedia|website=www.artandpopularculture.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180426075928/http://www.artandpopularculture.com/Floating_Man|archivedate=26 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told his readers to imagine themselves suspended in the air, isolated from all sensations, which includes no [[sense|sensory]] contact with even their own bodies. He argues that in this scenario one would still have [[self-consciousness]]. He thus concludes that the idea of the [[self (philosophy)|self]] is not logically dependent on any physical [[object (philosophy)|thing]], and that the soul should not be seen in [[relative term]]s, but as a primary given, a [[substance theory|substance]]. This argument was later refined and simplified by [[René Descartes]] in [[epistemology|epistemic]] terms, when he stated: "I can abstract from the supposition of all external things, but not from the supposition of my own consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;Seyyed [[Hossein Nasr]] and [[Oliver Leaman]] (1996), ''History of Islamic Philosophy'', p. 315, [[Routledge]], {{ISBN|0-415-13159-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Avicenna generally supported Aristotle's idea of the soul originating from the [[heart]], whereas Ibn al-Nafis rejected this idea and instead argued that the soul "is related to the entirety and not to one or a few [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s". He further criticized Aristotle's idea whereby every unique soul requires the existence of a unique source, in this case the heart. al-Nafis concluded that "the soul is related primarily neither to the spirit nor to any organ, but rather to the entire matter whose temperament is prepared to receive that soul," and he defined the soul as nothing other than "what a human indicates by saying "[[I (pronoun)|I]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nahyan A. G. Fancy|year=2006|title=Pulmonary Transit and Bodily Resurrection: The Interaction of Medicine, Philosophy and Religion in the Works of Ibn al-Nafīs (d. 1288)"|pages=209–210|work=Electronic Theses and Dissertations'', [[University of Notre Dame]]|url=http://etd.nd.edu/ETD-db/theses/available/etd-11292006-152615|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404020329/http://etd.nd.edu/ETD-db/theses/available/etd-11292006-152615/|archivedate=4 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thomas Aquinas===
Following Aristotle (whom he referred to as "the Philosopher") and Avicenna, [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–74) understood the soul to be the first actuality of the living body. Consequent to this, he distinguished three orders of life: plants, which feed and grow; animals, which add sensation to the operations of plants; and humans, which add intellect to the operations of animals.

Concerning the human soul, his epistemological theory required that, since the knower becomes what he knows, the soul is definitely not corporeal—if it is corporeal when it knows what some corporeal thing is, that thing would come to be within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|title=Quaestiones Disputatae de Veritate|url=http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/qdv02.html#51826|language=latin|accessdate=2016-02-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023626/http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/qdv02.html#51826|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the soul has an operation which does not rely on a body organ, and therefore the soul can exist without a body. Furthermore, since the rational soul of human beings is a subsistent form and not something made of matter and form, it cannot be destroyed in any natural process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|title=Super Boetium De Trinitate|url=http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/cbt.html#84681|language=latin|accessdate=2016-02-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304110654/http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/cbt.html#84681|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full argument for the [[immortality of the soul]] and Aquinas' elaboration of Aristotelian theory is found in Question 75 of the First Part of the [[Summa Theologica]].

===Immanuel Kant===
In his discussions of rational psychology, [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) identified the soul as the "I" in the strictest sense, and argued that the existence of inner experience can neither be proved nor disproved.
{{quote|We cannot prove a priori the immateriality of the soul, but rather only so much: that all properties and actions of the soul cannot be recognized from materiality.}} It is from the "I", or soul, that Kant proposes transcendental rationalization, but cautions that such rationalization can only determine the limits of knowledge if it is to remain practical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Philosophy of mind===
{{Main|Philosophy of mind}}
[[Gilbert Ryle]]'s [[ghost in the machine]] argument, which is a rejection of Descartes' [[mind–body dualism]], can provide a contemporary understanding of the soul/mind, and the problem concerning its connection to the brain/body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ryles|first=Gilbert|title=The Concept of Mind|year=1949|publisher=University Of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===James Hillman===
Psychologist James Hillman's [[archetypal psychology]] is an attempt to restore the concept of the soul, which Hillman viewed as the "self-sustaining and imagining substrate" upon which consciousness rests. Hillman described the soul as that "which makes meaning possible, [deepens] events into experiences, is communicated in love, and has a religious concern", as well as "a special relation with death".&lt;ref name="Blue Fire 5"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hillman J (T Moore, Ed.) |title=A blue fire: Selected writings by James Hillman |publisher=HarperPerennial |location=New York, NY, USA |year=1989 |page=21 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Departing from the Cartesian [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] "between outer tangible reality and inner states of mind", Hillman takes the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] stance&lt;ref name="Blue Fire 7"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hillman J (T Moore, Ed.) |title=A blue fire: Selected writings by James Hillman |publisher=HarperPerennial |location=New York, NY, USA |year=1989 |page=112 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that there is a "third, middle position" in which soul resides.&lt;ref name="Blue Fire 6"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hillman J (T Moore, Ed.) |title=A blue fire: Selected writings by James Hillman |publisher=HarperPerennial |location=New York, NY, USA |year=1989 |page=121 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archetypal psychology acknowledges this third position by attuning to, and often accepting, the [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]], [[dream]]s, [[mythology|myths]], and even [[psychopathology|psychopathologies]] through which, in Hillman's view, soul expresses itself.

==Science==
The current [[scientific consensus]] across all fields is that the existence of any kind of soul in the traditional sense is incompatible with a modern scientific understanding of the human mind, which holds that the human being is merely a complex machine that operates based on the exact same physical laws as all other objects in the universe, according to Julien Musolino, a cognitive scientist and professor at [[Rutgers University]],&lt;ref name="Musolino2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Musolino|first=Julien|date=2015|title=The Soul Fallacy: What Science Shows We Gain from Letting Go of Our Soul Beliefs|location=Amherst, New York|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=978-1-61614-962-8|pages=21–38|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; who states that there is currently no scientific evidence whatsoever to support the existence of the soul&lt;ref name="Musolino2015"/&gt; and there is considerable evidence that seems to indicate that souls do not exist.&lt;ref name="Musolino2015"/&gt;

===Neuroscience===
[[Neuroscience]] as an [[interdisciplinary]] field, and its branch of [[cognitive neuroscience]] particularly, operates under the [[ontology|ontological]] assumption of [[physicalism]]. In other words, it assumes—in order to perform its science—that only the fundamental phenomena studied by [[physics]] exist. Thus, neuroscience seeks to understand mental phenomena within the framework according to which human [[thought]] and [[behavior]] are caused solely by physical processes taking place inside the brain, and it operates by the way of [[reductionism]] by seeking an explanation for the mind in terms of brain activity.&lt;ref&gt;O. Carter Snead. "[http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2010/12/28%20neuroscience%20snead/1228_neuroscience_snead.pdf Cognitive Neuroscience and the Future of Punishment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105165031/http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2010/12/28%20neuroscience%20snead/1228_neuroscience_snead.pdf |date=5 November 2014 }}" (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kandel, ER; Schwartz JH; Jessell TM; Siegelbaum SA; Hudspeth AJ.

To study the mind in terms of the brain several methods of [[functional neuroimaging]] are used to study the neuroanatomical correlates of various [[cognition|cognitive processes]] that constitute the mind. The evidence from brain imaging indicates that all processes of the mind have physical correlates in brain function.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Eugenio Cavanna, Andrea Nani, Hal Blumenfeld, Steven Laureys. "[https://books.google.com/books/about/Neuroimaging_of_Consciousness.html?id=YQZomQEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y Neuroimaging of Consciousness]" (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; However, such correlational studies cannot determine whether neural activity plays a causal role in the occurrence of these cognitive processes ([[correlation does not imply causation]]) and they cannot determine if the neural activity is either [[necessity and sufficiency|necessary or sufficient]] for such processes to occur. Identification of [[causality|causation]], and of necessary and sufficient conditions requires explicit experimental manipulation of that activity. If manipulation of brain activity changes consciousness, then a causal role for that brain activity can be inferred.&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farah|first=Martha J.|author2=Murphy, Nancey|title=Neuroscience and the Soul|journal=Science|date=February 2009|volume=323|issue=5918|page=1168|doi=10.1126/science.323.5918.1168a|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/323/5918/1168.1.full|accessdate=20 November 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426214509/http://www.sciencemag.org/content/323/5918/1168.1.full|archivedate=26 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Max Velmans, Susan Schneider.

Physicist [[Sean M. Carroll]] has written that the idea of a soul is incompatible with [[quantum field theory]] (QFT). He writes that for a soul to exist: "Not only is new physics required, but dramatically new physics. Within QFT, there can't be a new collection of 'spirit particles' and 'spirit forces' that interact with our regular atoms, because we would have detected them in existing experiments."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sean M. Carroll|Carroll, Sean M.]]. (2011). [http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2011/05/23/physics-and-the-immortality-of-the-soul/ "Physics and the Immortality of the Soul"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006180135/http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2011/05/23/physics-and-the-immortality-of-the-soul/ |date=6 October 2011 }}. ''[[Scientific American]]''. Retrieved 2014-10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quantum indeterminacy|Quantum indeterminism]] has been invoked by some theorists as a solution to the problem of how a soul might interact with the brain, but neuroscientist Peter Clarke found errors with this viewpoint, noting there is no evidence that such processes play a role in brain function; and concluded that a [[Cartesian dualism|Cartesian]] soul has no basis from quantum physics.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Peter. (2014). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24355546 ''Neuroscience, Quantum Indeterminism and the Cartesian Soul''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910221027/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24355546 |date=10 September 2017 }}. Brain and cognition 84: 109-117.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parapsychology==
Some [[parapsychologists]] have attempted to establish, by [[scientific]] experiment, whether a soul separate from the brain exists, as is more commonly defined in religion rather than as a synonym of psyche or mind. [[Milbourne Christopher]] (1979) and [[Mary Roach]] (2010) have argued that none of the attempts by parapsychologists have yet succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;[[Milbourne Christopher]]. (1979).

===Weight of the soul===
In 1901 [[Duncan MacDougall (doctor)|Duncan MacDougall]] conducted [[21 grams experiment|an experiment]] in which he made weight measurements of patients as they died. He claimed that there was weight loss of varying amounts at the time of death; he concluded the soul weighed 21 grams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = MacDougall |first1 = Duncan |authorlink = Duncan MacDougall (doctor) |year = 1907 |title = The Soul: Hypothesis Concerning Soul Substance Together with Experimental Evidence of the Existence of Such Substance |url = |journal = American Medicine.

Park]] has written that MacDougall's experiments "are not regarded today as having any scientific merit" and the psychologist [[Bruce Hood (psychologist)|Bruce Hood]] wrote that "because the weight loss was not reliable or replicable, his findings were unscientific."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert L. Park|Park, Robert L]]. (2009). ''Superstition: Belief in the Age of Science''.

[[File:Space Shuttle Mockup at the Space Vehicle Mockup Facility.jpg|thumb|The Full Fuselage Trainer of the Orbiter Space Shuttle in the SVMF]]
The '''Space Vehicle Mockup Facility''' (SVMF) is a large open space area located inside Building 9 of [[Johnson Space Center]] in Houston. It consists of a long 200 meter long chamber that houses several [[Space Shuttle]] mockups, as well as mockups of every major pressurized module on the [[International Space Station]]. It is primarily used for [[astronaut]] training and systems familiarization.&lt;ref name="Book"&gt;{{cite book|title=Space Center Houston Official Souvenir Book|date=2016|publisher=AeroGraphics, Inc.|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Space Station modules are 1:1 scale and are maintained as accurate as possible to the real spacecraft in orbit. The facility also has a 1/6th gravity simulator and Mars Rover test vehicles. An industrial door at the North End, and overhead cranes allows the installation of new mockup spacecraft to be loaded into the facility. [[Space Center Houston]] allows a level 9 VIP tourist access to the entire training facility.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34030">'''Swarm intelligence''' ('''SI''') is the [[collective behavior]] of [[decentralization|decentralized]], [[Self-organization|self-organized]] systems, natural or artificial. The concept is employed in work on [[artificial intelligence]]. The expression was introduced by [[Gerardo Beni]] and Jing Wang in 1989, in the context of cellular robotic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beni, G., Wang, J.|chapter=Swarm Intelligence in Cellular Robotic Systems|title=Proceed. NATO Advanced Workshop on Robots and Biological Systems, Tuscany, Italy, June 26–30 (1989)|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-58069-7_38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SI systems consist typically of a population of simple [[Intelligent agent|agents]] or [[boids]] interacting locally with one another and with their environment. The inspiration often comes from nature, especially biological systems. The agents follow very simple rules, and although there is no centralized control structure dictating how individual agents should behave, local, and to a certain degree random, interactions between such agents lead to the [[emergence]] of "intelligent" global behavior, unknown to the individual agents. Examples of swarm intelligence in natural systems include [[ant colony|ant colonies]], bird [[flocking (behavior)|flocking]], animal [[herding]], [[bacteria#Growth and reproduction|bacterial growth]], fish [[shoaling and schooling|schooling]] and [[microbial intelligence]].

The application of swarm principles to [[robot]]s is called [[swarm robotics]], while 'swarm intelligence' refers to the more general set of algorithms. 'Swarm prediction' has been used in the context of forecasting problems.

=== Boids (Reynolds 1987) ===
{{main article|Boids}}
Boids is an [[artificial life]] program, developed by [[Craig Reynolds (computer graphics)|Craig Reynolds]] in 1986, which simulates the [[Flocking (behavior)|flocking]] behaviour of birds. His paper on this topic was published in 1987 in the proceedings of the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[SIGGRAPH]] conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with most artificial life simulations, Boids is an example of [[emergence|emergent]] behavior; that is, the complexity of Boids arises from the interaction of individual agents (the boids, in this case) adhering to a set of simple rules.  The rules applied in the simplest Boids world are as follows:

* '''separation''': [[wikt:steer#Verb|steer]] to avoid crowding local flockmates
* '''alignment''': steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
* '''cohesion''': steer to move toward the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates

More complex rules can be added, such as obstacle avoidance and goal seeking.

[[Evolutionary algorithm]]s (EA), [[particle swarm optimization]] (PSO), [[ant colony optimization]] (ACO) and their variants dominate the field of nature-inspired [[metaheuristic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Michael A.|last=Lones|year=2014|title=Metaheuristics in Nature-Inspired Algorithms|journal=[[Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference|GECCO '14]]|url=http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~ml355/common/papers/lones-gecco2014-metaheuristics.pdf|doi=10.1145/2598394.2609841}}&lt;/ref&gt; This list includes algorithms published up to circa the year 2000. A large number of more recent metaphor-inspired metaheuristics have started to [[List of metaphor-inspired metaheuristics#Criticism|attract criticism in the research community]] for hiding their lack of novelty behind an elaborate metaphor.

=== Stochastic diffusion search (Bishop 1989) ===
{{main article|Stochastic diffusion search}}
First published in 1989 Stochastic diffusion search (SDS)&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, J.M., Stochastic Searching Networks, Proc. 1st IEE Int. Conf. on Artificial Neural Networks, pp. 329-331, London, UK, (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nasuto, S.J. &amp; Bishop, J.M., (2008), Stabilizing swarm intelligence search via positive feedback resource allocation, In: Krasnogor, N., Nicosia, G, Pavone, M., &amp; Pelta, D. (eds), Nature Inspired Cooperative Strategies for Optimization, Studies in Computational Intelligence, vol 129, Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, New York, pp. 115-123.&lt;/ref&gt; was the first Swarm Intelligence metaheuristic. SDS is an agent-based [[Probabilistic algorithm|probabilistic]] global search and optimization technique best suited to problems where the objective function can be decomposed into multiple independent partial-functions. Each agent maintains a hypothesis which is iteratively tested by evaluating a randomly selected partial objective function parameterised by the agent's current hypothesis. In the standard version of SDS such partial function evaluations are binary, resulting in each agent becoming active or inactive. Information on hypotheses is diffused across the population via inter-agent communication. Unlike the [[Stigmergy|stigmergic]] communication used in ACO, in SDS agents communicate [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] via a one-to-one communication strategy analogous to the [[tandem running]] procedure observed in [[Leptothorax acervorum]].&lt;ref&gt;Moglich, M.; Maschwitz, U.; Holldobler, B., Tandem Calling: A New Kind of Signal in Ant Communication, Science, Volume 186, Issue 4168, pp. 1046-1047&lt;/ref&gt; A positive feedback mechanism ensures that, over time, a population of agents stabilise around the global-best solution.

=== Ant colony optimization (Dorigo 1992) ===
{{main article|Ant colony optimization}}
Ant colony optimization (ACO), introduced by Dorigo in his doctoral dissertation, is a class of [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] [[algorithm]]s modeled on the actions of an [[ant colony]]. ACO is a [[Probabilistic algorithm|probabilistic technique]] useful in problems that deal with finding better paths through graphs. Artificial 'ants'—simulation agents—locate optimal solutions by moving through a [[parameter space]] representing all possible solutions. Natural ants lay down [[pheromone]]s directing each other to resources while exploring their environment. The simulated 'ants' similarly record their positions and the quality of their solutions, so that in later simulation iterations more ants locate for better solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Ant Colony Optimization by Marco Dorigo and Thomas Stützle, MIT Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-262-04219-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Particle swarm optimization (Kennedy, Eberhart &amp; Shi 1995) ===
{{main article|Particle swarm optimization}}
Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a [[global optimization]] algorithm for dealing with problems in which a best solution can be represented as a point or surface in an n-dimensional space.  Hypotheses are plotted in this space and seeded with an initial [[velocity]], as well as a communication channel between the particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1016568309421 |title=Recent Approaches to Global Optimization Problems Through Particle Swarm Optimization |last=Parsopoulos |first=K. E. |last2=Vrahatis |first2=M. N. |journal=Natural Computing |volume=1 |issue=2-3 |pages=235–306 |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iste.co.uk/?searchtext=clerc&amp;ACTION=Search&amp;cat=&amp;ACTION=Search Particle Swarm Optimization] by Maurice Clerc, ISTE, {{ISBN|1-905209-04-5}}, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Particles then move through the solution space, and are evaluated according to some [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] criterion after each timestep. Over time, particles are accelerated towards those particles within their communication grouping which have better fitness values. The main advantage of such an approach over other global minimization strategies such as [[simulated annealing]] is that the large number of members that make up the particle swarm make the technique impressively resilient to the problem of [[local minima]].

==Applications==
Swarm Intelligence-based techniques can be used in a number of applications.  The U.S. military is investigating swarm techniques for controlling unmanned vehicles. The [[European Space Agency]] is thinking about an orbital swarm for self-assembly and interferometry. [[NASA]] is investigating the use of swarm technology for planetary mapping.  A 1992 paper by [[M. Anthony Lewis (roboticist)|M. Anthony Lewis]] and [[George A. Bekey]] discusses the possibility of using swarm intelligence to control nanobots within the body for the purpose of killing cancer tumors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lewis |first=M. Anthony |last2=Bekey |first2=George A. |title=The Behavioral Self-Organization of Nanorobots Using Local Rules |work=Proceedings of the 1992 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely al-Rifaie and Aber have used [[stochastic diffusion search]] to help locate tumours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = al-Rifaie | first1 = M.M. | last2 = Aber | first2 = A. | year = | title = Identifying metastasis in bone scans with Stochastic Diffusion Search | url = | journal = Proc.

"Utilising Stochastic Diffusion Search to identify metastasis in bone scans and microcalcifications on mammographs." In Bioinformatics and Biomedicine Workshops (BIBMW), 2012 IEEE International Conference on, pp. 280-287. IEEE, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Swarm intelligence has also been applied for [[data mining]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=D. |last=Martens |first2=B. |last2=Baesens |first3=T. |last3=Fawcett |title=Editorial Survey: Swarm Intelligence for Data Mining |journal=Machine Learning |volume=82 |issue=1 |pages=1–42 |year=2011 |doi=10.1007/s10994-010-5216-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ant-based routing===
The use of swarm intelligence in [[Telecommunications network|telecommunication networks]] has also been researched, in the form of [[Ant colony optimization algorithms|ant-based routing]]. This was pioneered separately by Dorigo et al. and [[Hewlett Packard]] in the mid-1990s, with a number of variations since. Basically, this uses a [[Probabilistic algorithm|probabilistic]] routing table rewarding/reinforcing the route successfully traversed by each "ant" (a small control packet) which flood the network. Reinforcement of the route in the forwards, reverse direction and both simultaneously have been researched: backwards reinforcement requires a symmetric network and couples the two directions together; forwards reinforcement rewards a route before the outcome is known (but then one would pay for the cinema before one knows how good the film is). As the system behaves stochastically and is therefore lacking repeatability, there are large hurdles to commercial deployment. Mobile media and new technologies have the potential to change the threshold for collective action due to swarm intelligence (Rheingold: 2002, P175).

The location of transmission infrastructure for wireless communication networks is an important engineering problem involving competing objectives. A minimal selection of locations (or sites) are required subject to providing adequate area coverage for users. A very different-ant inspired swarm intelligence algorithm, stochastic diffusion search (SDS), has been successfully used to provide a general model for this problem, related to circle packing and set covering. It has been shown that the SDS can be applied to identify suitable solutions even for large problem instances.&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker, R.M., Hurley, S.. An agent based approach to site selection for wireless networks. Proc ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, pp. 574–577, (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

Airlines have also used ant-based routing in assigning aircraft arrivals to airport gates. At [[Southwest Airlines]] a software program uses swarm theory, or swarm intelligence—the idea that a colony of ants works better than one alone. Each pilot acts like an ant searching for the best airport gate. "The pilot learns from his experience what's the best for him, and it turns out that that's the best solution for the airline," [[Douglas A. Lawson]] explains. As a result, the "colony" of pilots always go to gates they can arrive at and depart from quickly. The program can even alert a pilot of plane back-ups before they happen. "We can anticipate that it's going to happen, so we'll have a gate available," Lawson says.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Science Daily |date=April 1, 2008 |title=Planes, Trains and Ant Hills: Computer scientists simulate activity of ants to reduce airline delays |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/videos/2008/0406-planes_trains_and_ant_hills.htm |accessdate=December 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124132227/https://www.sciencedaily.com/videos/2008/0406-planes_trains_and_ant_hills.htm |archivedate=November 24, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crowd simulation===
Artists are using swarm technology as a means of creating complex interactive systems or [[Crowd simulation|simulating crowds]].

''[[Stanley and Stella in: Breaking the Ice]]'' was the first movie to make use of swarm technology for rendering, realistically depicting the movements of groups of fish and birds using the Boids system. Tim Burton's ''[[Batman Returns]]'' also made use of swarm technology for showing the movements of a group of bats. [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]] made use of similar technology, known as [[Massive (software)|Massive]], during battle scenes. Swarm technology is particularly attractive because it is cheap, robust, and simple.

Airlines have used swarm theory to simulate passengers boarding a plane. Southwest Airlines researcher Douglas A. Lawson used an ant-based computer simulation employing only six interaction rules to evaluate boarding times using various boarding methods.(Miller, 2010, xii-xviii).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Peter |year=2010 |title=The Smart Swarm: How understanding flocks, schools, and colonies can make us better at communicating, decision making, and getting things done |publisher=Avery |location=New York |isbn=978-1-58333-390-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human swarming===

Enabled by mediating software such as the SWARM platform (formally unu) from [[Unanimous A.I.]], networks of distributed users can be organized into "human swarms" through the implementation of real-time closed-loop control systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20161215-why-bees-could-be-the-secret-to-superhuman-intelligence|title=Why bees could be the secret to superhuman intelligence|last=Oxenham|first=Simon|access-date=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inc.com/kevin-j-ryan/unanimous-ai-swarm-intelligence-makes-startlingly-accurate-predictions.html|title=This Startup Correctly Predicted the Oscars, World Series, and Super Bowl.

===Swarm grammars===
Swarm grammars are swarms of [[stochastic grammar]]s that can be evolved to describe complex properties such as found in art and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=vonMammen|first1=Sebastian|last2=Jacob|first2=Christian|title=The evolution of swarm grammars -- growing trees, crafting art and bottom-up design|journal=Computational Intelligence|volume=4|pages=10–19|date=2009|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fncom.2015.00090/full|doi=10.1109/MCI.2009.933096}}&lt;/ref&gt; These grammars interact as agents behaving according to rules of swarm intelligence. Such behavior can also suggest [[deep learning]] algorithms, in particular when mapping of such swarms to neural circuits is considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=du Castel|first1=Bertrand|title=Pattern Activation/Recognition Theory of Mind|journal=Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience|volume=9|issue=90|date = 15 July 2015|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fncom.2015.00090/full|doi=10.3389/fncom.2015.00090|ref=neuroscience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swarmic art===
In a series of works al-Rifaie et al.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = al-Rifaie | first1 = MM | last2 = Bishop | first2 = J.M. | last3 = Caines | first3 = S. | year = 2012 | title = Creativity and Autonomy in Swarm Intelligence Systems | url = | journal = Cognitive Computing | volume = 4 | issue = 3| pages = 320–331 | doi=10.1007/s12559-012-9130-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; have successfully used two swarm intelligence algorithms—one mimicking the behaviour of one species of ants (''Leptothorax acervorum'') foraging ([[stochastic diffusion search]], SDS) and the other algorithm mimicking the behaviour of birds flocking ([[particle swarm optimization]], PSO)—to describe a novel integration strategy exploiting the local search properties of the PSO with global SDS behaviour. The resulting [[hybrid algorithm]] is used to sketch novel drawings of an input image, exploiting an artistic tension between the local behaviour of the 'birds flocking'—as they seek to follow the input sketch—and the global behaviour of the "ants foraging"—as they seek to encourage the flock to explore novel regions of the canvas. The "creativity" of this hybrid swarm system has been analysed under the philosophical light of the "rhizome" in the context of [[Deleuze]]'s "Orchid and Wasp" metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze G, Guattari F, Massumi B. A thousand plateaus. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press; 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a more recent work of al-Rifaie et al., "Swarmic Sketches and Attention Mechanism",&lt;ref&gt;al-Rifaie, Mohammad Majid, and John Mark Bishop. "[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-36955-1_8 Swarmic sketches and attention mechanism]". Evolutionary and Biologically Inspired Music, Sound, Art and Design. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2013. 85-96.&lt;/ref&gt; introduces a novel approach deploying the mechanism of 'attention' by adapting SDS to selectively attend to detailed areas of a digital canvas. Once the attention of the swarm is drawn to a certain line within the canvas, the capability of PSO is used to produce a 'swarmic sketch' of the attended line. The swarms move throughout the digital canvas in an attempt to satisfy their dynamic roles—attention to areas with more details—associated to them via their fitness function. Having associated the rendering process with the concepts of attention, the performance of the participating swarms creates a unique, non-identical sketch each time the 'artist' swarms embark on interpreting the input line drawings. In other works while PSO is responsible for the sketching process, SDS controls the attention of the swarm.

In a similar work, "Swarmic Paintings and Colour Attention",&lt;ref&gt;al-Rifaie, Mohammad Majid, and John Mark Bishop. "[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-36955-1_9 Swarmic paintings and colour attention]". Evolutionary and Biologically Inspired Music, Sound, Art and Design. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2013. 97-108.&lt;/ref&gt; non-photorealistic images are produced using SDS algorithm which, in the context of this work, is responsible for colour attention.

The "computational creativity" of the above-mentioned systems are discussed in&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;al-Rifaie, Mohammad Majid, Mark JM Bishop, and Ahmed Aber. "Creative or Not? Birds and Ants Draw with Muscle." Proceedings of AISB'11 Computing and Philosophy (2011): 23-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;al-Rifaie MM, Bishop M (2013) Swarm intelligence and weak artificial creativity.

A '''tantrum''', '''temper tantrum''', '''meltdown''' or '''hissy fit''' is an [[emotion]]al [[wikt:outburst|outburst]], usually associated with children or those in emotional distress, that is typically characterized by [[wikt:stubborn|stubbornness]], [[crying]], [[screaming]], [[violence]], [[wikt:defy|defiance]], [[anger|angry]] [[wikt:rant|ranting]], a resistance to attempts at pacification, and, in some cases, hitting, and other physically violent behavior. Physical control may be lost; the person may be unable to remain still; and even if the "goal" of the person is met, he or she may not be calmed.&lt;ref name="babycentre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.babycentre.co.uk/toddler/penelopeleach/whatisatantrum/ |title=What is a tantrum? |publisher=Babycentre.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kidshealth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kidshealth.org/parent/emotions/behavior/tantrums.html |title=Temper Tantrums |publisher=Kidshealth.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.babycenter.com/0_tantrums_11569.bc |title=Tantrums |publisher=BabyCenter |date= |accessdate=2011-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturalchild.org/jan_hunt/tantrum.html |title=When a Child Has a Tantrum – The Natural Child Project |publisher=Naturalchild.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A tantrum may be expressed in a tirade: a protracted, angry speech.&lt;ref name="babycentre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kidshealth" /&gt;

==In early childhood==
Tantrums are one of the most common forms of problematic behavior in young children, but tend to decrease in frequency and intensity as the child grows older. For the [[toddler]], tantrums can be considered as normal, even as gauges of a developing strength of character.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Skynner/John Cleese, ''Families and how to survive them'' (London 1993) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Kasketaldi_haurra_001.jpg|thumb|Child having a tantrum]]While tantrums are sometimes seen as a predictor of future [[anti-social behaviour]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Potegal, Michael, L.P. |author2=Davidson, Richard J. | title = Temper Tantrums in Young Children| journal = Journal of Developmental &amp; Behavioral Pediatrics| volume = 24| issue = 3| pages = 140–147| date = June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; in another sense they are simply an age-appropriate sign of excessive [[frustration]], and will diminish over time given a calm and consistent handling.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Benaroch, ''Solving Health and Behavioral Problems from Birth Through Preschool'' (2008) p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;  Parental containment where a child cannot contain itself—rather than what the child is ostensibly demanding—may be what is really required.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1990) p. 113-4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Selma Fraiberg]] warned against "too much pressure or forceful methods of control from the outside" in child-rearing: "if we turn every instance of pants changing, treasure hunting, napping, puddle wading and garbage distribution into a governmental crisis we can easily bring on fierce defiance, tantrums, and all the fireworks of revolt in the nursery".&lt;ref&gt;Selma H. Fraiberg, ''The Magic Years'' (New York 1987), p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intellectual disabilites ==
Some people who have neurological disorders such as [[autism]], [[ADHD]], and [[intellectual disability]] could be more vulnerable to tantrums than others, although anyone experiencing brain damage (temporary or permanent) can suffer from tantrums. Anyone may be prone to tantrums once in a while, regardless of gender or age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autism.lovetoknow.com/Temper_Tantrums_and_Autism|title=Temper Tantrums and Autism - LoveToKnow|publisher=|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a meltdown due to [[sensory overload]] (which even [[neurotypical]] children can experience) is not the same as a temper tantrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bennie|first1=Maureen|title=Tantrum vs Autistic Meltdown: What Is The Difference?|url=https://autismawarenesscentre.com/what-is-the-difference-between-a-tantrum-and-an-autistic-meltdown/|website=Autism Awareness|publisher=Autism Awareness Centre Inc.|accessdate=9 June 2017|date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aberrations==
[[Freud]] considered that the [[Sergei Pankejeff|Wolf Man]]'s development of temper tantrums was connected with his seduction by his sister: he became "discontented, irritable and violent, took offence on every possible occasion, and then flew into a rage and screamed like a savage".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (PFL 9) p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; Freud linked the tantrums to an unconscious need for punishment driven by feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]&lt;ref&gt;Freud, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;—something which he thought could be generalised to many other cases of childhood tantrums.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (PFL 9) p. 257-8 and p. 242&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heinz Kohut]] contended that tantrums were [[narcissistic rages]],&lt;ref name="I. Goldenberg, 2007 p. 172"&gt;H. and I. Goldenberg, ''Family Therapy'' (2007) p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; caused by the thwarting of the infant's [[Grandiosity|grandiose]]-[[exhibitionist]] core.  The blow to the inflated self-image, when a child's wishes are (however justifiably) refused, creates fury because it strikes at the feeling of [[omnipotence]].&lt;ref name="Gambling 1974 p. 182"&gt;[[Edmund Bergler]] in J. Halliday/P. Fuller eds., ''The Psychology of Gambling'' (London 1974) p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jealousy]] over the birth of a sibling, and resulting aggression, may also provoke [[negativistic]] tantrums, as the effort at controlling the feelings overloads the child's system of self-regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Selma H. Fraiberg, ''The Magic Years'' (New York 1987) p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

==In later life==
[[Thackeray]] claimed that in later life "you may tell a Tantrum as far as you can see one, by the distressed and dissatisfied expression of its countenance—'Tantrumical', if we may term it so".&lt;ref&gt;William Makepeace Thackeray, ''The Irish Sketch Book'' (1848) p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heinz Kohut]] contended that "the infant's core is likely to contain a self-centred, [[Grandiosity|grandiose]]-exhibitionist part", and that "tantrums at being frustrated thus represent [[narcissistic rages]]"&lt;ref name="I. Goldenberg, 2007 p. 172"/&gt; at the blow to the inflated self-image. With "a child confronted with some refusal ... regardless of its justifications, the refusal automatically provokes fury, since it offends his sense of [[omnipotence]]".&lt;ref name="Gambling 1974 p. 182"/&gt;

The willingness of the [[celebrity culture|celebrity]] to throw tantrums whenever thwarted to the least degree&lt;ref&gt;Cooper Lawrence, ''The Cult of Celebrity'' (2009) p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; is a kind of [[Acquired Situational Narcissism]]&lt;ref&gt;Simon Crompton, ''All about Me'' (London 2007) p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; or tantrumical behavior.

If tantrums are shown by older people they might often be signs of immaturity and a mental disability; however, many people can have them under extreme stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/health-news/adult-temper-tantrums-1.1126134|title=North Jersey|website=North Jersey|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tibs the Great''' (November 1950 – December 1964) was the [[Royal Mail|British Post Office]]'s "number one cat" and kept the post office headquarters completely mouse-free during his 14 years of service. He was the son of Minnie, and on his death, several newspapers ran an obituary.

==Background==
Cats had been officially employed by the Post Office to catch rodents since September 1868, when three cats were taken on for a six-month trial period at a rate of one shilling per week, in the London Money Order Office.&lt;ref name="wordpress1"&gt;[https://postalheritage.wordpress.com/2014/07/30/museumcats-day-industrial-chaos-in-the-post-office-cat-world/ #MuseumCats Day: "Industrial chaos in the Post Office cat world".] The British Postal Museum &amp; Archive, 30 July 2014. Retrieved 21 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 May 1869, it was noted that "the cats have done their duty very efficiently".&lt;ref name="telegraph1"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/qi/6729316/QI-quite-interesting-facts-about-keeping-in-touch.html QI: quite interesting facts about keeping in touch.] Molly Oldfield and John Mitchinson, ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', 7 December 2009. Retrieved 21 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1873, the cats were being paid 1s 6d, and were being employed in other post offices.&lt;ref name="wordpress1"/&gt;

==Early life==
It is thought that Tibs was born in London in November 1950.&lt;ref name="theguardian1"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/04/royal-mail-secret-railway-reopen-next-year Royal Mail 'secret' railway on track to reopen next year.] Maev Kennedy, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 4 February 2016. Retrieved 21 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; His father is unknown. His mother was Minnie, another "fine cat" also owned by Alf Talbut.&lt;ref name="royalmail" /&gt;

==Career==
Tibs worked at Post Office Headquarters in London for 14 years, and was officially employed and paid 2s 6d per week. He worked in the basement and his job was to catch rats. He was cared for by Alf Talbut, cleaner at St Martin's-le-Grand throughout his life.&lt;ref name="royalmail"/&gt; During his 14 years, Tibs kept the Post Office headquarters completely mouse-free.&lt;ref name="wordpress1" /&gt;

In 1952 there was "public outrage" that the cats had not had a pay rise since 1873, and the next year there was a question in the House of Commons, asking the [[Assistant Postmaster-General]], [[David Gammans]], "when the allowance payable for the maintenance of cats in his department was last raised?"&lt;ref name="wordpress1"/&gt;

Gammans replied,&lt;ref name="wordpress1"/&gt;

{{quote|There is, I am afraid, a certain amount of industrial chaos in the Post Office cat world. Allowances vary in different places, possibly according to the alleged efficiency of the animals and other factors. It has proved impossible to organise any scheme for payment by results or output bonus. These servants of the State are, however, frequently unreliable, capricious in their duties and liable to prolonged absenteeism.

My hon. and gallant Friend has been misinformed regarding the differences between rates for cats in Northern Ireland and other parts of the United Kingdom. There are no Post Office cats in Northern Ireland. Except for the cats at Post Office Headquarters who got the special allowance a few years ago, presumably for prestige reasons, there has been a general wage freeze since July, 1918, but there have been no complaints!&lt;ref name="cats1953"&gt;{{cite hansard |title= Cats (Maintenance Allowances)|url= http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1953/mar/18/cats-maintenance-allowances#S5CV0513P0_19530318_HOC_33|house= House of Commons|date= 18 March 1953|column_start= 4|column_end=5 |volume=513}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He also hastened to assure the House that Post Office cats had "an adequate maternity service", and that equal pay prevailed in the group.&lt;ref name="cats1953"/&gt;

==In media==
In 1953, Tibs was featured in a book titled ''Cockney Cats'' by [[Warren Tute]] and [[Felix Fonteyn]]. He also appeared at a "Cats and Film Stars" party.&lt;ref name="royalmail"&gt;[http://500years.royalmailgroup.com/gallery/tibs-the-great-is-no-more/ "Tibs the Great is no more".] ''Post Office Magazine'', January 1965. Celebrating 500 Years of Royal Mail. royalmailgroup.com Retrieved 21 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Tibs died in December 1964. He had been suffering from [[oral cancer]]. He received obituaries in several newspapers. By the time of his death he had grown to 23lb in weight, probably due to living in one of the staff dining rooms, rather than from eating rats.&lt;ref name="theguardian1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="royalmail" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smithsonianmag"&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/brief-history-post-office-cats-180958061/?no-ist A Brief History of Post Office Cats.] Erin Blakemore, smithsonian.com, 9 February 2016.

The last cat employed at Post Office headquarters was Blackie, who died in 1984, which coincided with cloth sacks being replaced with rodent-resistant plastic sacks.&lt;ref name="telegraph1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22429">The '''UN Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force (CTITF)''' is an instrument designed to roll out the [[UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy]].&lt;ref name="unp"&gt;[https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/ctitf/en/un-global-counter-terrorism-strategy un.org: "UN GLOBAL COUNTER-TERRORISM STRATEGY"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its formation in 2005, the task force has brought forth different initiatives that assist in the Counter Terrorism Strategy including the UN Counter Terrorism Handbook.  Its working groups have offered workshops and presented reports that are designed to assist important UN actors, member states and stakeholders in the fight against terrorism.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalct.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/rosand_policybrief_091.pdf|title=The UN’s Role in Implementing its Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Before the CTITF was formed, the Security Council of the UN legally binded all member states through resolutions relating to the [[United Nations Charter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/215035/pdf|title=The United Nations, Counter Terrorism, and Human Rights: Institutional Adaptation and Embedded Ideas|last=Foot|first=Rosemary|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolutions included;

The [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1267]], adopted in October 1999 requires the [[Taliban]] in Afghanistan to stop providing refuge to terrorist organizations and demand that they cooperate in bringing terrorists to justice.  This resolution also imposes aviation actions and financial sanctions on the Taliban.  It also established the Security Council Committee.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sanctionsandsecurity.nd.edu/assets/110258/action_agenda_un_counterterrorism.pdf|title=An Action Agenda for Enhancing the United Nations Program on Counter-Terrorism|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373]], adopted in September 2001 under Chapter VII of the [[United Nations Charter]].  The aims of this resolution is to hinder terrorist actions.  This resolution calls on states to adjust national laws to better combat terrorism and focuses on regulating immigration laws to contain the spread of terrorism.  It also place legal obligations on member states requiring them to freeze any financial assets of terrorist and supporters, deny travel means or safe havens for terrorists, and prevent their weapon supply and recruitment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

These resolutions began the formation of branches in the United Nations to combat terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=qBQ0jcXc2vcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=United+Nations+Counter+Terrorism+Implementation+Task+Force&amp;ots=3yj8CGAven&amp;sig=s2SJ3u__4vnA8LMF31fypu3hVUk#v=onepage&amp;q=United%20Nations%20Counter%20Terrorism%20Implementation%20Task%20Force&amp;f=false|title=Uniting Against Terror: Cooperative Nonmilitary Responses to the Global Terrorist Threat|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the Secretary- General [[Kofi Annan]] created the United Nations Counter Terrorism Implementation Task Force.  It was later endorsed by the General Assembly in 2006 through the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, to ensure that all terrorism units in the UN work together to increase the efficiency and range.

== Makeup ==
The Secretary General appoints a senior United Nations official to act as the chair of the task force.  The task force is divided into approximately 38 member entities including the [[World Bank]], the Youth Envoy and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opcw.org/special-sections/ctitf-report/about-the-united-nations-counter-terrorism-implementation-task-force/|title=About the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Interpol|INTERPOL]].  The CTITF is divided into 4 subgroups; the [[United Nations Security Council]], the [[United Nations Secretariat|Secretariat]], the Agencies Programmes Funds and Observers. The goal of the CTITF is to maximize each of the entity‘s comparative advantage by delivering as one to help Member States implement the four pillars of the Global Strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/ctitf/en/working-groups|title=Working Groups of the UN|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pillars of the CTITF ==
The intent of Counter Terrorism Implementation Task Force is to help states in the UN enforce the 4 building blocks that make up Global Strategy.  The four Pillars are;
* Pillar 1- Methods of being aware of the circumstances that encourage possibilities of terrorism.
* Pillar 2- Methods preventing and combating terrorism.
* Pillar 3- Methods that allow states to be better equipped to fight terrorism and how the United Nations can help.
* Pillar 4- Methods that enforce the rule of law as the foundation of fighting terrorism and ensuring all have human rights.
The Counter Terrorism Implementation Task Force is responsible for ensuring all needs of member states in the United Nations are met and policies are supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/ctitf/en/about-task-force|title=Coordination and coherence of the counter-terrorism efforts of the United Nations|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Status of Working Groups ==
The status of working groups has implemented a project on harmonized border management, compiling all recent international conventions, and best practices in an applicable, user-friendly format to help interested states build the institutional and procedural mechanisms for an effective border management system A working arrangement on harmonized border management has been completed by the working group. This idea will continue to be maximized through ongoing consultations with member states and international organizations.

== Entities ==
Entities of the United Nations Counter Terrorism Implementation Task Force involve;

'''Mobility and processing of people'''

Because the processes that allow travel and economic and cultural exchanges is exploited by terrorists, measures that are put in place to prevent terrorism have become explicitly linked to the management and regulation of movement across borders. These measures include implementing passenger integrated border-management systems, issuing secure travel documents, promoting exchange of information among stakeholders, training, and capacity-building.  Improving in areas like this can help heighten security and immigration systems while also allowing the cross-border movement of people. Some of these measures are technologically complex, but more basic systems can be achieved in traditional areas of migration- management with a view to enhancing overall capacity&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Movement and processing of goods'''

Global trade, as well as the international supply chain are vulnerable to manipulation by terrorists. In order to minimize this vulnerability, a range of measures should be taken, including ensuring receipt of advance electronic cargo information about inbound, outbound and transit shipments; employing a consistent risk-management approach to address threats to cargo security; using non-intrusive detection equipment; promoting cooperation among customs administrations (e.g. by performing outbound inspection of high-risk containers and cargo); and establishing partnerships with the private sector for the implementation of secure practices at every stage of the supply chain, through Authorized Economic Operator (AEO). The implementation of these and other measures is key in order to maximize security in international trade and facilitate the movement of goods across borders programmes&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Maritime security'''

Over 90 per cent of the total goods traded internationally is transported from source to destination along the world’s main global sea-trading routes he security of the maritime domain is therefore classified as a major problem of global importance. The aims of maritime security are to detect and deter security threats; to take preventive measures against security incidents affecting ships or port facilities; and to safeguard passengers, crews, ships and their cargoes, port facilities and the people who work and live in port areas, while still allowing for the safe and efficient movement of maritime trade.   Effective implementation of the relevant legislative and practical security measures is necessary in order to prevent unlawful acts against the passengers and crew of ships engaged in international voyages and against the port facilities that serve them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Early warning and alert systems'''

Border security is a dynamic and constantly changing process because the illegal cross-border movement of people affects not only the security, but also economic and social welfare of states. Comprehensive early-warning and alert systems are therefore key components of effective border management systems. They strengthen the collective capacity of states to detect, and combat terrorism, by facilitating inter-agency cooperation and the timely sharing and exchange of pertinent, reliable information, allow the enabling important decisions to be taken in a reasonable manner&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Many international organizations with a border-control mandate and utilize early- warning and alert systems. Those tools include the [[World Customs Organization|WCO]] CEN and RILO networks; IMOSOLAS, LRIT and AIS; the Consolidated Lists of the Security Council “sanctions” committees, and the “I-24/7” secure global communications system, SLTD database and Notices regime of the International Criminal Police Organization ([[Interpol|INTERPOL]])&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Working Groups ==
The United Nations Secretariat, agencies, funds and programmes, and affiliated organizations contribute to the implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy both through their individual mandates and through their membership in the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force (CTITF)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/ctitf/en/working-groups|title=Working Groups of the UN's Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Integrated Assistance for Countering Terrorism is an important working group in the Task force.  The working group consists of representatives from different UN entities involved in putting the counter terrorism strategy in action for countries who wish to receive help from the UN.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2014, the inter-agency [[working group]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s of the CTITF were reformed in 2014 to help improve efficiency and effectiveness of the entities' in achieving results.

Some of the working groups currently in place include;

'''Border Management and Law Enforcement relating to Counter-Terrorism'''

This working group strives to allow guidance to Member States on implementation of legal, institutional and practical counter-terrorism-related border control measures required. It focuses on the following areas: terrorist mobility; integrity and security of travel documents; illicit movement of cash and bearer negotiable instruments; movement and processing of goods; illicit movement of small arms, light weapons, ammunition, explosives and weapons of mass destruction; aviation and maritime security; early-warning and alert systems.

The goal of this group is to gather information exchange on human rights and the rule of law capacity building surrounding the concept of counter terrorism.  This working group has now set in place a support and assistance function available to member states to ensure human rights and the rule of law is well established.  In April 2013, a global project was launched by this working group called Capacity Building and Training of Law Enforcement Officials on Human Rights, the Rule of Law and the Prevention of Terrorism.  The goal of this project is to properly train law enforcement officials in charge of counter terrorism on human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/ctitf/en/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-and-rule-law-while-countering-terrorism|title=Promoting and Protecting Human Rights and the Rule of Law While Countering Terrorism|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Veterinary ethics''' is a system of moral principles that apply values and judgements to the practice of [[veterinary medicine]]. As a scholarly discipline, veterinary ethics encompasses its practical application in clinical settings as well as work on its history, philosophy, theology, and sociology.   Veterinary ethics combines veterinary professional ethics and the subject of [[animal ethics]].  It can be interpreted as a critical reflection on the provision of veterinary services in support of the profession's responsibilities to animal kind and mankind.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

== History ==

[[Animal welfare]] has been a subject that is studied in great depth, it largely looks at the ways in which an animal may suffer in particular circumstances or how their lives may be enriched.  [[Animal ethics]] is another well documented subject where philosophers, since [[Aristotle]],{{cn|date=January 2018}} have commented on its importance.  Often referred to as “the animal problem’ the questions that seem to be asked in this field are at their foundation trying to determine what the morally relevant difference is between [[animals]] and [[humans]], and if there is no difference how do we justify treating animals a certain way and if there is a difference then what is it about this difference that allows us to treat animals in a certain way.

Veterinary ethics is a modern subject that does not have a defined start point.  As it combines the study of animal welfare and animal ethics as its root and uses information from this as data for its deliberations it could be said to have a long history, however as an academic discipline it is only recently that works have been published on the topic.

The two academics seen to have written on veterinary ethics for the longest are [[Bernard Rollin]] ([[Colorado State University]]){{cn|date=January 2018}} and Jerrold Tannenbaum ([[University of California, Davis]]).{{cn|date=January 2018}} They can be seen as the founders of the subject in veterinary ethics.  Currently, most veterinary schools teach veterinary ethics and it is often combined in teaching with animal welfare or with law.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

== Relations with medical ethics ==

The subject is very similar to that of [[Medical ethics|human medical ethics]] in that the study of the relationship between the doctor and the patient relates closely to that of the veterinary surgeon and animal owner.  However, the subject differs greatly in the consideration of the uses of animals, while a doctor’s duty may to preserve life at nearly all cost, the veterinary surgeon needs to adapt their attitude to health and longevity of life to the purpose of the animal (E.g., farm animals).

Much of what is understood in the field of professionalism and professional responsibilities in confidentiality, preserving autonomy, beneficence, truth-telling, whistleblowing, informed consent and communication is largely lifted from the research done in the medical profession.  The difference between the human patients and the animal patients does not interfere with the professionalism discussion between doctors and human patients and vets with their clients.

Another major difference between veterinary ethics and human [[medical ethics]] is the interplay with law.  Human medical ethics has driven changes in the law and, to a lesser degree, vice versa.  Largely involving cases of human rights a wide ranging variety of high-profile legal challenges in many countries have involved the use of ethics to encourage changes in law (for example, assisted suicide, abortion, duty of care, rights to refuse treatment).  Veterinary ethics does not have such a strong interplay.  It is rare to have an animal based legal challenge reaching high into the legal system.   Cases involving challenges to professionalism and duty of care are largely dealt with via the veterinary governing bodies.

The veterinary profession remains largely self-regulating across the world (''e.g.'', by the [[Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons|RCVS]] and [[American Veterinary Medical Association|AVMA]]).  This has caused some controversy as to why the veterinary profession remains one of the few remaining self-regulating professions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rollin|first1=Bernard E.|author-link=Bernard Rollin|title=An Introduction to Veterinary Medical Ethics: Theory and Cases|date=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118704516|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard Rollin]] wrote on this the difficulty in keeping public confidence while remaining self-regulating, trust and impartiality are critical but most importantly is the need for a profession to self-sacrificial by putting the clients needs above that of the profession or professional’s need.

“Every profession—be it medicine, law, or agriculture—is given freedom by the social ethic to pursue its aims. In return, society basically says to professions it does not understand well enough to regulate, “You regulate yourselves the way we would regulate you if we understood what you do, which we don’t. But we will know if you don’t self-regulate properly and then we will [hammer you with draconian rules and] regulate you, despite our lack of understanding.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://savma.omnibooksonline.com/2008/data/papers/107.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 13, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715000128/http://savma.omnibooksonline.com/2008/data/papers/107.pdf |archivedate=July 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles ==
The [[American Veterinary Medical Association]] (AVMA) regularly reviews and updates its principles of ethics.  The AVMA Judicial Council acts as the group in charge of insuring the principles are current.  Much like the human medical code, veterinarians are expected to "adhere to a progressive code of ethical conduct". Overall there are eight main principles, covering areas such as compentance, animal welfare, the veterinarian-client-patient relationship, standards of professionalism, honesty, compliance with the law, continuing education, acting within boundaries of compentance, and the betterment of public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Principles of Veterinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA|url=https://www.avma.org/KB/Policies/Pages/Principles-of-Veterinary-Medical-Ethics-of-the-AVMA.aspx|website=www.avma.org|accessdate=2017-02-04|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key topics ==
The key topics within veterinary ethics are:
* [[Euthanasia]]
* [[Informed consent]]
* Complementary and [[alternative medicine]]
* Cosmetic interventions
* Non-therapeutic mutilations
* [[Negligence]]
* Professionalism
* Religious influences
* [[Research ethics]]
* Confidentiality
* [[Selective breeding]]
* Professional regulation
