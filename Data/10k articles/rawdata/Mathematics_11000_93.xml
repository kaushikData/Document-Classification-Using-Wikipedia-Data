'''''A Mathematician's Lament''''', often referred to informally as '''Lockhart's Lament''', is a short book on the [[Mathematics education|pedagogics]] and [[Philosophy of mathematics|philosophy]] of [[mathematics]] by [[Paul Lockhart (mathematician)|Paul Lockhart]], originally a research mathematician but for many years a math teacher at [[Saint Ann's School (New York City)|Saint Ann's School]] in Brooklyn, New York. Characterized as a strongly worded opinion piece arguing for an aesthetic, [[intuition (psychology)|intuitive]] and [[heuristic]] approach to teaching and the importance of mathematics teaching reforms, the book frames learning mathematics as an [[mathematics and art|artistic and imaginative pursuit]] which is not reflected at all in the way the subject is taught in the American educational system.

==Background==
The book was developed from a 25-page essay that was written in 2002, originally circulated in typewritten manuscript copies, and subsequently on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Devlin, Keith (2009). ''Foreword'', p.&amp;nbsp;9 of {{citation | first = Paul | last = Lockhart | year = 2009 | title = A Mathematician's Lament}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5794">{{dablink|This article is about certain functional equations.  For ordinary differential equations that are cubic in the unknown function, see [[Abel equation of the first kind]].}}

The '''Abel equation''', named after [[Niels Henrik Abel]], is a type of [[functional equation]] which can be written in the form
:&lt;math&gt;f(h(x)) = h(x + 1)&lt;/math&gt;
or, equivalently, 
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha(f(x))=\alpha(x)+1&lt;/math&gt;
and controls  the iteration of &amp;nbsp; {{mvar|f}}.

==Equivalence==
These equations are equivalent. Assuming that {{mvar|α}} is an [[invertible function]], the second equation can be written as
:&lt;math&gt; \alpha^{-1}(\alpha(f(x)))=\alpha^{-1}(\alpha(x)+1)\,  .&lt;/math&gt;

Taking  {{math|''x'' {{=}}  ''α''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''y'')}}, the equation can be written as
::&lt;math&gt;f(\alpha^{-1}(y))=\alpha^{-1}(y+1)\,  .&lt;/math&gt;

For a function {{math|''f''(''x'')}}  assumed to be known, the task is to  solve the functional equation for the  function {{math|''α''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;≡''h''}}, possibly satisfying additional requirements, such as {{math|''α''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(0)&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;1}}.

The change of variables {{math|''s''&lt;sup&gt;''α''(''x'')&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}}  Ψ(''x'')}}, for a real parameter {{mvar|s}}, brings Abel's equation into the celebrated [[Schröder's equation]], {{math|Ψ(''f''(''x'')) {{=}} ''s''&amp;nbsp;Ψ(''x'')}} .

The further change {{math|''F''(''x'') {{=}} exp(''s''&lt;sup&gt;''α''(''x'')&lt;/sup&gt;)}}  into [[Böttcher's equation]],  {{math|''F''(''f''(''x'')) {{=}} ''F''(''x'')&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

The Abel equation is a special case of (and easily generalizes to) the '''translation equation''',&lt;ref&gt;[[János Aczél (mathematician)|Aczél, János]], (1966): ''Lectures on Functional Equations and Their Applications'', [[Academic Press]],  reprinted by Dover Publications,  {{ISBN|0486445232}} .&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\omega(  \omega(x,u),v)=\omega(x,u+v) ~,&lt;/math&gt;
e.g., for &lt;math&gt;\omega(x,1)= f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, 
:&lt;math&gt;\omega(x,u)= \alpha^{-1}(\alpha(x)+u) &lt;/math&gt;.   &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  (Observe {{math|  ''ω''(''x'',0) {{=}} ''x''}}.) 

The Abel function {{math|''α''(''x'')}} further provides the canonical coordinate for [[Shift operator|Lie advective flows]] (one parameter [[Lie group]]s).

The equation of [[tetration]] is a special case of Abel's equation, with {{math|''f'' {{=}} exp}}.

In the case of an integer argument, the equation encodes  a recurrent procedure, e.g.,

In [[mathematics]], '''additive K-theory''' means some version of [[algebraic K-theory]] in which, according to [[Spencer Bloch]], the [[general linear group]] ''GL'' has everywhere been replaced by its [[Lie algebra]] ''gl''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~bloch/addchow_rept.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is not, therefore, one theory but a way of creating additive or infinitesimal analogues of multiplicative theories.

==Formulation==

Following [[Boris Feigin]] and [[Boris Tsygan]],&lt;ref&gt;B. Feigin, B. Tsygan. ''Additive K-theory'', LNM 1289, Springer&lt;/ref&gt; let &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; be an algebra over a field &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; of [[characteristic zero]] and let &lt;math&gt; {\mathfrak gl}(A) &lt;/math&gt; be the algebra of infinite matrices over &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; with only finitely many nonzero entries. Then the [[Lie algebra homology]]

:&lt;math&gt; H_\cdot ({\mathfrak gl}(A),k) &lt;/math&gt;

has a natural structure of a [[Hopf algebra]]. The space of its [[Primitive element (co-algebra)|primitive elements]] of degree &lt;math&gt; i&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;K^+_i(A)&lt;/math&gt; and called the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th '''additive K-functor''' of&amp;nbsp;''A''.

The additive K-functors are related to [[cyclic homology]] groups by the isomorphism

:&lt;math&gt; HC_i(A) \cong K^+_{i+1}(A). &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!-- Keep this note! Technical term, necessary for Wikipedia articles; don't assign for wiktionary
--&gt;
The term '''arithmetic underflow''' (or "[[floating point]] underflow", or just "underflow") is a condition in a computer program where the result of a calculation is a number of smaller absolute value than the computer can actually represent in memory on its CPU.

Arithmetic underflow can occur when the true result of a floating point operation is smaller in [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] (that is, closer to zero) than the smallest value representable as a [[normal number (computing)|normal]] floating point number in the target datatype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coonen|first1=Jerome T|title=An implementation guide to a proposed standard for floating-point arithmetic|journal=Computer|date=1980|volume=13|issue=1|pages=68–79|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8b13/26cd9b6411cbf1ffc325e0c48afbd0d29f24.pdf|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Underflow can in part be regarded as negative [[Arithmetic overflow|overflow]] of the [[exponent]] of the floating point value.
For example, if the exponent part can represent values from &amp;minus;128 to 127, then a result with a value less than &amp;minus;128 may cause underflow.

Note that storing values that are too low in an integer variable (e.g. attempting to store -1 in an unsigned integer) is properly referred to as [[integer overflow]], or more broadly "integer wraparound". The term underflow normally refers to floating point numbers only, and is a separate issue. It is not possible in most floating-point designs to store a too-low value, as usually they are signed and have a negative infinity value.

==Underflow gap==
The interval between &amp;minus;''fminN'' and ''fminN'', where
''fminN'' is the smallest positive normal floating point value, is called the underflow gap.
This is because the size of this interval is many orders of magnitude larger than the distance between
adjacent normal floating point values just outside the gap. For instance, if the floating
point datatype can represent 20 binary digits, the underflow gap is 2&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; times
larger than the absolute distance between adjacent floating point values just outside the gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sun Microsystems|title=Numerical Computation Guide|date=2005|publisher=Oracle|url=https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19422-01/819-3693/|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In older designs, the underflow gap had just one usable value, zero. When an underflow occurred,
the true result was replaced by zero (either directly by the hardware, or by system software
handling the primary underflow condition). This replacement is called ''flush to zero''.

The 1984 edition of [[IEEE 754]] introduced [[subnormal numbers]]. The subnormal numbers (including zero) fill the
underflow gap with values where the absolute distance between adjacent values is the same as
for adjacent values just outside the underflow gap. This enables ''gradual underflow'' where
a nearest subnormal value is used, just as a nearest normal value is used when possible.
Even when using gradual underflow, the nearest value may be zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Demmel|first1=James|title=Underflow and the Reliability of Numerical Software|journal=SIAM Journal on Scientific and Statistical Computing|date=1984|volume=5|issue=4|pages=887–919|doi=10.1137/0905062|url=https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/0905062|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The absolute distance between adjacent floating point values just outside the gap is called the machine epsilon. The [[machine epsilon]] is typically characterized by the largest value whose sum with the value 1 will result in the answer with value 1 in that floating point scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heath|first1=Michael T.|title=Scientific Computing|date=2002|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=0-07-239910-4|page=20|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be written as &lt;math&gt;fl(1+\epsilon) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;fl()&lt;/math&gt; is a function which converts the real value into the floating point representation. While the machine epsilon is not to be confused with the underflow level (assuming subnormal numbers), it is closely related. The machine epsilon is dependent on the number of bits which make up the [[significand]], whereas the underflow level depends on the number of digits which make up the exponent field. In most floating point systems, the underflow level is smaller than the machine epsilon.

==Handling of underflow==
The occurrence of an underflow may set a ('sticky') status bit, raise an exception, at the hardware
level generate an interrupt, or may cause some combination of these effects.

As specified in [[IEEE 754]], the underflow condition is only signaled if there is also a loss of precision.
Typically this is determined as the final result being inexact.
However, if the user is [[trap (computing)|trapping]] on underflow,
this may happen regardless of consideration for loss of precision.
The default handling in IEEE 754 for underflow (as well as other exceptions) is to record
as a floating point status that underflow has occurred. This is specified for the application
programming level, but often also interpreted as how to handle it at the hardware level.

'''Brownian dynamics (BD)''' can be used to describe the motion of [[molecule]]s for example in molecular [[simulation]]s or in reality. It is a simplified version of [[Langevin dynamics]] and corresponds to the limit where no average acceleration takes place. This approximation can also be described as '[[overdamped]]' Langevin dynamics, or as Langevin dynamics without [[inertia]].

In [[Langevin dynamics]], the equation of motion is

:&lt;math&gt;M\ddot{X} = - \nabla U(X) - \gamma \dot{X} + \sqrt{2 \gamma k_B T} R(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where  
*&lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a [[friction coefficient]],
*&lt;math&gt;U(X)&lt;/math&gt; is the particle interaction potential,
*&lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; is the gradient operator such that &lt;math&gt;- \nabla U(X)&lt;/math&gt; is the force calculated from the particle interaction potentials
*the dot is a time derivative such that &lt;math&gt;\dot{X}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity, and &lt;math&gt;\ddot{X}&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration
*T is the temperature
*k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]]
*&lt;math&gt;R(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a delta-correlated stationary [[Gaussian process]] with zero-mean, satisfying

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle R(t) \right\rangle =0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle R(t)R(t') \right\rangle = \delta(t-t').&lt;/math&gt;

In Brownian dynamics, the &lt;math&gt;M\ddot{X}(t)&lt;/math&gt; term is neglected, and the sum of these terms is zero.

:&lt;math&gt;0 = - \nabla U(X) - \gamma \dot{X}+ \sqrt{2 \gamma k_B T } R(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[Einstein relation (kinetic theory)|Einstein relation]], &lt;math&gt;D = k_B T/\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, it is often convenient to write the equation as,

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{X}(t) = - \nabla U(X) D / k_B T + \sqrt{2 D} R(t).&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3175">In [[linear algebra]], a '''coefficient matrix''' is a matrix consisting of the coefficients of the variables in a set of [[linear equations]]. The matrix is used in solving [[systems of linear equations]].

==Coefficient matrix==
In general, a system with ''m'' [[linear equations]] and ''n'' unknowns can be written as
: &lt;math&gt;a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + \cdots + a_{1n}x_n = b_1 \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + \cdots + a_{2n}x_n = b_2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\vdots \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;a_{m1}x_1 + a_{m2}x_2 + \cdots + a_{mn}x_n = b_m \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ x_2,...,x_n&lt;/math&gt; are the unknowns and the numbers &lt;math&gt;a_{11},\ a_{12},...,\ a_{mn}&lt;/math&gt; are the  coefficients of the system.  The coefficient matrix is the ''mxn'' matrix with the coefficient &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; as the (''i'',''j'')-th entry:&lt;ref name="Liebler"&gt;{{cite book| url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dD1OKMD-rMoC&amp;dq=coefficient+matrix+linear+systems&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| title= Basic Matrix Algebra with Algorithms and Applications| last=Liebler| first=Robert A. |publisher=[[CRC Press]]| date=December 2002| access-date=13 May 2016|pages=7-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{1n} \\
a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp;\cdots &amp; a_{2n} \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
a_{m1} &amp; a_{m2} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{mn} \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Then the above set of equations can be expressed more succinctly as 

:&lt;math&gt; Ax=b&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' is the coefficient matrix and ''b'' is the column vector of constant terms.

==Relation of its properties to properties of the equation system==

By the [[Rouché–Capelli theorem]], the system of equations is [[inconsistent equations|inconsistent]], meaning it has no solutions, if the [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] of the [[augmented matrix]] (the coefficient matrix augmented with an additional column consisting of the vector ''b'') is greater than the rank of the coefficient matrix. If, on the other hand, the ranks of these two matrices are equal, the system must have at least one solution. The solution is unique if and only if the rank ''r'' equals the number ''n'' of variables. Otherwise the general solution has ''n – r '' free parameters; hence in such a case there are an infinitude of solutions, which can be found by imposing arbitrary values on ''n – r'' of the variables and solving the resulting system for its unique solution; different choices of which variables to fix, and different fixed values of them, give different system solutions.

==Dynamic equations==

A first-order [[matrix difference equation]] with constant term can be written as 

:&lt;math&gt;y_{t+1}=Ay_t+c,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' is ''n'' × ''n'' and ''y'' and ''c'' are ''n'' × 1. This system converges to its steady-state level of ''y'' [[if and only if]] the [[absolute value]]s of all ''n'' [[eigenvalue]]s of ''A'' are less than 1.

A first-order [[matrix differential equation]] with constant term can be written as 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dt}=Ay(t) +c.&lt;/math&gt;

This system is stable if and only if all ''n'' eigenvalues of ''A'' have negative real parts.

{{floating-point}}
In [[computing]], '''decimal64''' is a [[decimal floating-point]] [[computer numbering format]] that occupies 8 bytes (64 bits) in computer memory.
It is intended for applications where it is necessary to emulate decimal rounding exactly, such as financial and tax computations.

Decimal64 supports 16 [[decimal digit]]s of [[significand]] and  an [[exponent]] range of −383 to +384, i.e. {{gaps|±0.000|000|000|000|000|e=-383}} to {{gaps|±9.999|999|999|999|999|e=384}}.  (Equivalently, {{gaps|±0|000|000|000|000|000|e=-398}} to {{gaps|±9|999|999|999|999|999|e=369}}.) In contrast, the corresponding binary format, which is the most commonly used type, has an approximate range of {{gaps|±0.000|000|000|000|001|e=-308}} to {{gaps|±1.797|693|134|862|315|e=308}}. Because the significand is not normalized, most values with less than 16 [[significant digits]] have multiple possible representations; {{gaps|1×10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|&amp;#61;|0.1×10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;|&amp;#61;|0.01×10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}}, etc.  Zero has 768 possible representations (1536 if you include both [[signed zero]]s).

Decimal64 floating point is a relatively new decimal floating-point format, formally introduced in the [[IEEE 754-2008|2008 version]]&lt;ref name="IEEE-754_2008"&gt;{{cite journal |title=IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic |author=IEEE Computer Society |date=2008-08-29 |publisher=[[IEEE]] |id=IEEE Std 754-2008 |doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.2008.4610935 |ref=CITEREFIEEE_7542008 |isbn=978-0-7381-5753-5 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4610933 |access-date=2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[IEEE 754]] as well as with [[ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011]].&lt;ref name="ISO-60559_2011"&gt;{{cite journal |title=ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011 |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=57469 |date=2011 |access-date=2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IEEE 754 allows two alternative representation methods for decimal64 values. The standard does not specify how to signify which representation is used, for instance in a situation where decimal64 values are communicated between systems:

* In the [[#Binary integer significand field|binary representation method]], the 16-digit significand is represented as a binary coded positive integer, based on [[binary integer decimal]] (BID).
* In the [[#Densely packed decimal significand field|decimal representation method]], the 16-digit significand is represented as a decimal coded positive integer, based on [[densely packed decimal]] (DPD) with 5 groups of 3 digits (except the most significant digit encoded specially) are each represented in declets (10-bit sequences). This is pretty efficient, because 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; = 1024, is only little more than needed to still contain all numbers from 0 to 999.

Both alternatives provide exactly the same range of representable numbers: 16 digits of significand and 3×2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; = 768 possible decimal exponent values. (All the possible decimal exponent values storable in a [[binary64]] number are representable in decimal64, and most bits of the significand of a binary64 are stored keeping roughly the same number of decimal digits in the significand.)

In both cases, the most significant 4 bits of the significand (which actually only have 10 possible values) are combined with the most significant 2 bits of the exponent (3 possible values) to use 30 of the 32 possible values of a 5-bit field.  The remaining combinations encode [[infinity|infinities]] and [[NaN]]s.

|}

In the cases of Infinity and NaN, all other bits of the encoding are ignored.  Thus, it is possible to initialize an array to Infinities or NaNs by filling it with a single byte value.

=== Binary integer significand field ===
This format uses a binary significand from 0 to 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;−1 = {{gaps|9|999|999|999|999|999}} = 2386F26FC0FFFF&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; = {{gaps|1000|1110000110|1111001001|1011111100|0000111111|1111111111&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

The encoding, completely stored on 64 bits, can represent binary significands up to 10×2&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt;−1 = {{gaps|11|258|999|068|426|239}} = 27FFFFFFFFFFFF&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;, but values larger than 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;−1 are illegal (and the standard requires implementations to treat them as 0, if encountered on input).

As described above, the encoding varies depending on whether the most significant 4 bits of the significand are in the range 0 to 7 (0000&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to 0111&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), or higher (1000&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or 1001&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

If the 2 bits after the sign bit are "00", "01", or "10", then the  exponent field consists of the 10 bits following the sign bit, and the significand is the remaining 53 bits, with an implicit leading 0 bit:

 s 00eeeeeeee   (0)ttt tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt
 s 01eeeeeeee   (0)ttt tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt
 s 10eeeeeeee   (0)ttt tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt
 
This includes [[subnormal numbers]] where the leading significand digit is 0.

If the 2 bits after the sign bit are "11", then the 10-bit exponent field is shifted 2 bits to the right (after both the sign bit and the "11" bits thereafter), and the represented significand is in the remaining 51 bits. In this case there is an implicit (that is, not stored) leading 3-bit sequence "100" for the most bits of the true significand (in the remaining lower bits ''ttt...ttt'' of the significand, not all possible values are used).

 s 1100eeeeeeee (100)t tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt
 s 1101eeeeeeee (100)t tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt
 s 1110eeeeeeee (100)t tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt tttttttttt

The 2-bit sequence "11" after the sign bit indicates that there is an ''implicit'' 3-bit prefix "100" to the significand. Compare having an implicit 1-bit prefix "1" in the significand of normal values for the binary formats. Note also that the 2-bit sequences "00", "01", or "10" after the sign bit are part of the exponent field.

Note that the leading bits of the significand field do ''not'' encode the most significant decimal digit; they are simply part of a larger pure-binary number.  For example, a significand of {{gaps|8|000|000|000|000|000}} is encoded as binary {{gaps|0111|0001101011|1111010100|1001100011|0100000000|0000000000}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with the leading 4 bits encoding 7; the first significand which requires a 54th bit is 2&lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt; = {{gaps|9|007|199|254|740|992}}. The highest valid significant is {{gaps|9|999|999|999|999|999}} whose binary encoding is
{{gaps|(100)0|1110000110|1111001001|1011111100|0000111111|1111111111}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (with the 3 most significant bits (100) not stored but implicit as shown above; and the next bit is always zero in valid encodings).

In the above cases, the value represented is

: (−1)&lt;sup&gt;sign&lt;/sup&gt; × 10&lt;sup&gt;exponent−398&lt;/sup&gt; × significand &lt;!-- Remember, significand is defined as an integer: 0 &lt;= significand &lt; 10^16 --&gt;

If the four bits after the sign bit are "1111" then the value is an infinity or a NaN, as described above:

 s 11110 xx...x    ±infinity
 s 11111 0x...x    a quiet NaN
 s 11111 1x...x    a signalling NaN

=== Densely packed decimal significand field ===
In this version, the significand is stored as a series of decimal digits.  The leading digit is between 0 and 9 (3 or 4 binary bits), and the rest of the significand uses the [[densely packed decimal]] (DPD) encoding.

Unlike the binary integer significand version, where the exponent changed position and came before the significand, this encoding, combines the leading 2 bits of the exponent and the leading digit (3 or 4 bits) of the significand into the five bits that follow the sign bit.

This eight bits after that are the exponent continuation field, providing the less-significant bits of the exponent.

The last 50 bits are the significand continuation field, consisting of five 10-bit ''[[declet (computing)|declet]]s''.&lt;ref name="Muller_2010"&gt;{{cite book |author-last1=Muller |author-first1=Jean-Michel |author-last2=Brisebarre |author-first2=Nicolas |author-last3=de Dinechin |author-first3=Florent |author-last4=Jeannerod |author-first4=Claude-Pierre |author-last5=Lefèvre |author-first5=Vincent |author-last6=Melquiond |author-first6=Guillaume |author-last7=Revol |author-first7=Nathalie |author-last8=Stehlé |author-first8=Damien |author-last9=Torres |author-first9=Serge |title=Handbook of Floating-Point Arithmetic |year=2010 |publisher=[[Birkhäuser]] |edition=1 |isbn=978-0-8176-4704-9&lt;!-- print --&gt; |doi=10.1007/978-0-8176-4705-6 |lccn=2009939668&lt;!-- |isbn=978-0-8176-4705-6 (online), ISBN 0-8176-4704-X (print) --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each declet encodes three decimal digits&lt;ref name="Muller_2010"/&gt; using the DPD encoding.

If the first two bits after the sign bit are "00", "01", or "10", then those are the leading bits of the exponent, and the three bits "TTT" after that are interpreted as the leading decimal digit (0 to 7):

 s 00 TTT (00)eeeeeeee (0TTT)[tttttttttt][tttttttttt][tttttttttt][tttttttttt][tttttttttt]
 s 01 TTT (01)eeeeeeee (0TTT)[tttttttttt][tttttttttt][tttttttttt][tttttttttt][tttttttttt]
 s 10 TTT (10)eeeeeeee (0TTT)[tttttttttt][tttttttttt][tttttttttt][tttttttttt][tttttttttt]

If the first two bits after the sign bit are "11", then the second 2-bits are the leading bits of the exponent, and the next bit "T" is prefixed with implicit bits "100" to form the leading decimal digit (8 or 9):

 s 1100 T (00)eeeeeeee (100T)[tttttttttt][tttttttttt][tttttttttt][tttttttttt][tttttttttt]
 s 1101 T (01)eeeeeeee (100T)[tttttttttt][tttttttttt][tttttttttt][tttttttttt][tttttttttt]

The remaining two combinations (11 110 and 11 111) of the 5-bit field after the sign bit are used to represent ±infinity and NaNs, respectively.

The DPD/3BCD transcoding for the declets is given by the following table. b9...b0 are the bits of the DPD, and d2...d0 are the three BCD digits.

{{Densely packed decimal}}

The 8 decimal values whose digits are all 8s or 9s have four codings each.
The bits marked x in the table above are ignored on input, but will always be 0 in computed results.
(The 8×3 = 24 non-standard encodings fill in the gap between 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;=1000 and 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;=1024.)

In the above cases, with the ''true significand'' as the sequence of decimal digits decoded, the value represented is

:&lt;math&gt;(-1)^\text{signbit}\times 10^{\text{exponentbits}_2-398_{10}}\times \text{truesignificand}_{10}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5471">In [[mathematics]], a '''diffeology''' on a set  declares what the smooth parametrizations in the set are. In some sense a diffeology generalizes the concept of smooth charts in a [[differentiable manifold]]. 

The concept was first introduced by [[Jean-Marie Souriau]] in the 1980s and developed first by his students [[Paul G. Donato|Paul Donato]] (homogeneous spaces and coverings) and [[Patrick Iglesias-Zemmour|Patrick Iglesias]] (diffeological fiber bundles, higher homotopy etc.), later by other people. A related idea was introduced by [[Kuo-Tsaï Chen]] (陳國才, ''Chen Guocai'') in the 1970s, using convex sets instead of open sets for the domains of the plots.

==Definition==
If ''X'' is a set, a '''diffeology''' on ''X'' is a set of maps, called '''plots''', from [[open set|open subsets]] of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (''n'' ≥ 0) to ''X'' such that the following hold:

* Every constant map is a plot.
* For a given map, if every point in the domain has a [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] such that restricting the map to this neighborhood is a plot, then the map itself is a plot.
* If ''p'' is a plot, and ''f'' is a [[smooth function]] from an open subset of some real vector space into the domain of ''p'', then the composition ''p'' &amp;#x2218; ''f'' is a plot.
Note that the domains of different plots can be subsets of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; for different values of ''n''.

A set together with a diffeology is called a '''diffeological space'''. 

A map between diffeological spaces is called '''differentiable''' if and only if composing it with every plot of the first space is a plot of the second space. It is a '''diffeomorphism''' if it is differentiable, [[bijective]], and its [[inverse function|inverse]] is also differentiable.

The diffeological spaces, together with differentiable maps as [[morphism]]s, form a [[category theory|category]]. The isomorphisms in this category are the diffeomorphisms defined above.  The [[category theory|category]] of diffeological spaces is closed under many categorical operations.

A diffeological space has the '''D-topology''': the finest [[topological space|topology]] such that all plots are [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]].

If ''Y'' is a [[subset]] of the diffeological space ''X'', then ''Y'' is itself a diffeological space in a natural way: the plots of ''Y'' are those plots of ''X'' whose images are subsets of ''Y''.

If ''X'' is a diffeological space and ~ is some [[equivalence relation]] on ''X'', then the [[quotient set]] X/~ has the diffeology generated by all compositions of plots of ''X'' with the projection from ''X'' to ''X''/~. This is called the '''quotient diffeology'''. The [[quotient topology|quotient D-topology]] is the D-topology of the quotient diffeology, and that this topology may be trivial without the diffeology being trivial.

A Cartan De Rham calculus can be developed in the framework of diffeology, as well as fiber bundles, homotopy etc.

==Smooth manifolds==

[[Differentiable manifold]]s also generalize smoothness. They are normally defined as [[topological manifold]]s with an atlas, whose transition maps are smooth, which is used to pull back the differential structure. 

Every smooth manifold defined in this way has a natural diffeology, for which the plots correspond to the smooth maps from open subsets of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to the manifold. With this diffeology, a map between two smooth manifolds is smooth if and only if it is differentiable in the diffeological sense. Hence the smooth manifolds with smooth maps form a full subcategory of the diffeological spaces. 

This allows one to give an alternative definition of smooth manifold which makes no reference to transition maps or to a specific atlas: a smooth manifold is a diffeological space which is locally diffeomorphic to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

The relationship between smooth manifolds and diffeological spaces is analogous to the relationship between topological manifolds and topological spaces.

This method of ''modeling'' diffeological spaces can be extended to other locals models, for instance: orbifolds, modeled on quotient spaces '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;/Γ where Γ is a finite linear subgroup, or manifolds with boundary and corners, modeled on [[orthant]]s etc.

==Examples==

* Any [[open set|open]] subset of a finite-dimensional real, and therefore complex, vector space is a diffeological space. 
* Any smooth manifold is a diffeological space. 
* Any quotient of a diffeological space is a diffeological space. This is an easy way to construct non-manifold diffeologies. For example, the set of [[real number]]s '''R''' is a smooth manifold. The quotient '''R'''/('''Z''' + α'''Z'''), for some [[irrational number|irrational]] α, is the ''irrational torus'', a diffeological space diffeomorphic to the quotient of the regular 2-torus '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/'''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by a line of [[slope]] α. It has a non-trivial diffeology, but its D-topology is the [[trivial topology]].

Certain classes of ''E''-semigroups have been studied long before the more general class, in particular, a [[regular semigroup]] that is also an ''E''-semigroup is known as an [[orthodox semigroup]].

Weipoltshammer proved that the notion of [[weak inverse]] (the existence of which is one way to define [[E-inversive semigroup|''E''-inversive semigroup]]s) can also be used to define/characterize ''E''-semigroups as follows: a semigroup ''S'' is an ''E''-semigroup if and only if, for all ''a'' and ''b'' ∈ ''S'', ''W''(''ab'') = ''W''(''b'')''W''(''a''), where ''W''(''x'') ≝ {''x'' ∈ ''S'' | ''xax'' = ''x''} is the set of weak inverses of ''x''.&lt;ref name="W"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4789">In [[mathematics]], '''field arithmetic''' is a subject that studies the interrelations between arithmetic properties of a {{ql|field_(mathematics)|field}} and its [[absolute Galois group]].
It is an interdisciplinary subject as it uses tools from [[algebraic number theory]], [[arithmetic geometry]], [[algebraic geometry]], [[model theory]], the theory of [[finite groups]] and of [[profinite groups]].

==Fields with finite absolute Galois groups==
Let ''K'' be a field and let ''G'' = Gal(''K'') be its absolute Galois group. If ''K'' is [[algebraically closed]], then ''G'' = 1. If ''K'' = '''R''' is the real numbers, then

:&lt;math&gt;G=\operatorname{Gal}(\mathbf{C}/\mathbf{R})=\mathbf{Z}/2 \mathbf{Z}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here '''C''' is the field of complex numbers and '''Z''' is the ring of integer numbers. 
A [[Artin–Schreier theorem|theorem of Artin and Schreier]] asserts that (essentially) these are all the possibilities for finite absolute Galois groups.

'''Artin–Schreier theorem.''' Let ''K'' be a field whose absolute Galois group ''G'' is finite. Then either ''K'' is separably closed and ''G'' is trivial or ''K'' is [[real closed]] and ''G'' = '''Z'''/2'''Z'''.

==Fields that are defined by their absolute Galois groups==
Some profinite groups occur as the absolute Galois group of non-isomorphic fields.  A first example for this is

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{Z}}=\lim_{\longleftarrow}\mathbf{Z}/n \mathbf{Z}.&lt;/math&gt;

This group is isomorphic to the absolute Galois group of an arbitrary [[finite field]]. Also the absolute Galois group of the field of [[formal Laurent series]] '''C'''((''t'')) over the complex numbers is isomorphic to that group.

To get another example, we bring below two non-isomorphic fields whose absolute Galois groups are free (that is [[free profinite group]]).

* Let ''C'' be an [[algebraically closed]] field and ''x'' a variable.  Then Gal(''C''(''x'')) is free of rank equal to the cardinality of ''C''. (This result is due to [[Adrien Douady]] for 0 characteristic and has its origins in [[Riemann's existence theorem]]. For a field of arbitrary characteristic it is due to [[David Harbater]] and [[Florian Pop]], and was also proved later by [[Dan Haran]] and [[Moshe Jarden]].)
* The absolute Galois group Gal('''Q''') (where '''Q''' are the rational numbers) is compact, and hence equipped with a normalized [[Haar measure]]. For a Galois automorphism ''s'' (that is an element in Gal('''Q''')) let ''N&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' be the maximal Galois extension of '' '''Q''' '' that ''s'' fixes. Then with probability 1 the absolute Galois group Gal(''N''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;) is free of countable rank. (This result is due to [[Moshe Jarden]].)

In contrast to the above examples, if the fields in question are finitely generated over '''''Q''''', [[Florian Pop]] proves that an isomorphism of the absolute Galois groups yields an isomorphism of the fields:

'''Theorem.''' Let ''K'', ''L'' be finitely generated fields over '''''Q''''' and let ''a'':&amp;nbsp;Gal(''K'')&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;Gal(''L'') be an isomorphism. Then there exists a unique isomorphism of the algebraic closures, ''b'': ''K''&lt;sub&gt;alg&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''L''&lt;sub&gt;alg&lt;/sub&gt;, that induces  ''a''.

This generalizes an earlier work of [[Jürgen Neukirch]] and [[Koji Uchida]] on number fields.

==Pseudo algebraically closed fields==
{{Main|Pseudo algebraically closed field}}

A [[pseudo algebraically closed field]] (in short PAC) ''K'' is a field satisfying the following geometric property. Each [[absolutely irreducible]] algebraic variety ''V'' defined over ''K'' has a ''K''-[[rational point]].

Over PAC fields there is a firm link between arithmetic properties of the field and group theoretic properties of its absolute Galois group. A nice theorem in this spirit connects [[Hilbertian field]]s with ω-free fields (''K'' is ω-free if any [[embedding problem]] for ''K'' is properly solvable).

'''Theorem.''' Let ''K'' be a PAC field. Then ''K'' is Hilbertian if and only if ''K'' is ω-free.

[[Peter Roquette]] proved the right-to-left direction of this theorem and conjectured the opposite direction. [[Michael Fried (mathematician)|Michael Fried]] and [[Helmut Völklein]] applied algebraic topology and complex analysis to establish Roquette's conjecture in characteristic zero. Later Pop 
proved the Theorem for arbitrary characteristic by developing "[[rigid patching]]".

Quant is often taken to mean “financial quant,” in which case it is similar to financial engineer.&lt;ref name=Haug&gt;Espen Gaarder Haug, ''Derivatives Models on Models'', Wiley (July 24, 2007) 978-0470013229&lt;/ref&gt; The difference is that it is possible to be a theoretical quant, or a quant in only one specialized niche in finance, while “financial engineer” usually implies a practitioner with broad expertise.&lt;ref name=Lindsey&gt;Richard R. Lindsey and Barry Schachter (editors), ''How I Became a Quant: Insights from 25 of Wall Street's Elite'', Wiley (August 3, 2009) 978-0470452578&lt;/ref&gt;

“[[Rocket scientist]]” ([[aerospace engineer]]) is an older term, first coined in the development of rockets in WWII ([[Wernher von Braun]]), and later, the NASA space program; it was adapted by the first generation of financial quants who arrived on [[Wall Street]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref name=Derman&gt;Emanuel Derman, ''My Life as a Quant: Reflections on Physics and Finance'', Wiley (September 16, 2004) 978-0471394204&lt;/ref&gt; While basically synonymous with financial engineer, it implies adventurousness and fondness for [[disruptive innovation]].&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;Aaron Brown, ''Red-Blooded Risk: The Secret History of Wall Street'', Wiley (October 11, 2011) 978-1118043868&lt;/ref&gt; Financial "Rocket scientists" were usually trained in applied mathematics, [[statistics]] or finance; and spent their entire careers in risk-taking.&lt;ref name=Brown1&gt;Aaron Brown, ''The Poker Face of Wall Street'', Wiley (March 31, 2006) 978-0470127315&lt;/ref&gt; They were not hired for their mathematical talents, they either worked for themselves or applied mathematical techniques to traditional financial jobs.&lt;ref name="Neftci"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brown /&gt; The later generation of financial engineers were more likely to have PhDs in mathematics or [[physics]] and often started their careers in academics or non-financial fields.&lt;ref name=Stefanica&gt;Dan Stefanica, ''A Primer for the Mathematics of Financial Engineering'', FE Press (April 4, 2008) 978-0979757600&lt;/ref&gt;

The first degree programs in financial engineering were set up in the early 1990s. The number and size of programs has grown rapidly, so now some people use the term “financial engineer” to mean someone who has a degree in the field.&lt;ref name=IAFE /&gt;

An older use of the term "financial engineering" that is less common today is aggressive restructuring of corporate [[balance sheet]]s. It is generally (but not always) a disparaging term, implying that someone is profiting from paper games at the expense of employees and investors.&lt;ref name=Pomerleano&gt;Michael Pomerleano and William Shaw (editors), ''Corporate Restructuring: Lessons from Experience'', World Bank Publications (April 2005) 978-0821359280&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

One of the critics of financial engineering is [[Nassim Taleb]], a professor of financial engineering at [[Polytechnic Institute of New York University]]
&lt;ref name=Taleb&gt;Nassim Nicholas Taleb, ''The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable'', Random House (April 17, 2007) 978-1400063512&lt;/ref&gt; who argues that it replaces common sense and leads to disaster.  A series of economic collapses has led many governments to argue a return to "real" [[engineering]] from financial engineering.

Many other authors have identified specific problems in financial engineering that caused catastrophes: [[Aaron Brown (financial author)|Aaron Brown]]&lt;ref name=Brown2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minyanville.com/business-news/markets/articles/quants-quant-traders-trading-quantitative-traders/7/9/2012/id/42227|title=''Whodunit?

He blames over-reliance on models for financial problems.

The [[financial innovation]] often associated with financial engineers was mocked by former chairman of the Federal Reserve [[Paul Volcker]] in 2009 when he said it was a code word for risky securities, that brought no benefits to society.

'''Fisher's inequality''', is a [[Necessity and sufficiency|necessary condition]] for the existence of a balanced incomplete [[block design]], that is, a system of subsets that satisfy certain prescribed conditions in [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] [[mathematics]]. Outlined by [[Ronald Fisher]], a [[population genetics|population geneticist]] and [[statistics|statistician]], who was concerned with the [[design of experiments]]; studying the differences among several different [[variety (botany)|varieties]] of [[plant]]s, under each of a number of different growing conditions, called ''blocks''.

Let:

* {{math|''v''}} be the number of varieties of plants;
* {{math|''b''}} be the number of blocks.

To be a balanced incomplete block design it is required that:

* {{math|''k''}} different varieties are in each block, {{math|1 ≤ ''k'' &lt; ''v''}}; no variety occurs twice in any one block;
* any two varieties occur together in exactly {{math|λ}} blocks;
* each variety occurs in exactly {{math|''r''}} blocks.

Fisher's inequality states simply that

:: {{math|''b'' ≥ ''v''}}.

== Proof ==
Let the incidence matrix {{math|'''M'''}} be a {{math|''v'' × ''b''}} matrix defined so that {{math|'''M'''&lt;sub&gt;i,j&lt;/sub&gt;}} is 1 if element {{math|''i''}} is in block {{math|''j''}} and 0 otherwise. Then {{math|1='''B'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''MM'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;}} is a {{math|''v'' × ''v''}} matrix such that {{math|1='''B'''&lt;sub&gt;i,i&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r''}} and {{math|1='''B'''&lt;sub&gt;i,j&lt;/sub&gt; = λ}} for {{math|''i'' ≠ ''j''}}. Since {{math|''r'' ≠ λ}}, {{math|det('''B''') ≠ 0}}, so {{math|1=rank('''B''') = ''v''}}; on the other hand, {{math|1=rank('''B''') ≤ rank('''M''') ≤ ''b''}}, so {{math|''v'' ≤ ''b''}}.

==Generalization==
Fisher's inequality is valid for more general classes of designs. A ''pairwise balanced design'' (or PBD) is a set {{math|''X''}} together with a family of non-empty subsets of {{math|''X''}} (which need not have the same size and may contain repeats) such that every pair of distinct elements of {{math|''X''}} is contained in exactly {{math|λ}} (a positive integer) subsets. The set {{math|''X''}} is allowed to be one of the subsets, and if all the subsets are copies of {{math|''X''}}, the PBD is called "trivial". The size of {{math|''X''}} is {{math|''v''}} and the number of subsets in the family (counted with multiplicity) is {{math|''b''}}.

Theorem: For any non-trivial PBD, {{math|''v'' ≤ ''b''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stinson|2003|loc = pg.193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This result also generalizes the [[De Bruijn–Erdős theorem (incidence geometry)|Erdős–De Bruijn theorem]]:

For a PBD with {{math|1=λ = 1}} having no blocks of size 1 or size {{mvar|v}}, {{math|''v'' ≤ ''b''}}, with equality if and only if the PBD is a [[projective plane]] or a near-pencil (meaning that exactly {{math|''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}} of the points are [[collinear]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stinson|2003|loc= pg.183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another direction, [[Dijen K. Ray-Chaudhuri|Ray-Chaudhuri]] and [[R. M. Wilson|Wilson]] proved in 1975 that in a {{math|2''s''-(''v'', ''k'', λ)}} design, the number of blocks is at least &lt;math&gt;\binom{v}{s}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Dijen K.|last1=Ray-Chaudhuri|first2=Richard M.|last2=Wilson|title=On t-designs|year=1975|journal=Osaka Journal of Mathematics|url=https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ojm/1200758175|volume=12|pages=737–744|MR=0592624|zbl=0342.05018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Florence Nightingale David''', also known as '''F. N. David''' (23 August 1909 – 23 July 1993) was an English statistician, born in [[Ivington]], Herefordshire, England. She was head of the Statistics Department at the University of California, Riverside in 1970.

== Early life and education ==
David was named after [[Florence Nightingale]], who was a friend of her parents.

David was tutored privately by a local parson, beginning at age five.&lt;ref name="Salsburg2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Salsburg|title=The Lady Tasting Tea: How Statistics Revolutionized Science in the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VCw_RxBrJc8C|date=1 May 2002|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|isbn=978-1-4668-0178-3|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; By that age she already knew some arithmetic, so she began with algebra.  Since David already knew English, the parson taught her Latin and Greek.&lt;ref name="Salsburg2002" /&gt;  At the age of ten, she entered to formal schooling. She studied mainly mathematics for three years, with the aim of becoming an actuary, but at that time the actuarial firms only accepted men. She earned a degree in Mathematics from [[Bedford College for Women]] in 1931.

David received a scholarship and continued her studies with [[Karl Pearson]] at University College, London, as his research assistant. When Pearson retired, his son Egon, and R. A. Fisher, took over Karl's duties. After Karl Pearson died in 1934, David returned to the Biometrics laboratory to work with [[Jerzy Neyman]], submitting her four most recently published papers as her PhD thesis, and earned a doctorate in 1938.

== Career ==
Working for Karl Pearson, F. N. David computed solutions to complicated multiple integrals, and the distribution of the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|correlation coefficients]]. As a result, her first book was released in 1938, called ''Tables of the Correlation Coefficient''. All the calculations were done on a [[pinwheel calculator|hand-cranked mechanical calculator]] known as a [[Brunsviga]].

During [[World War II]], David worked for the [[Ministry of Home Security]]. In late 1939 when war had started but England had not yet been attacked, she created statistical models to predict the possible consequences of bombs exploding in high density populations such as the big cities of England and especially London. From these models, she determined estimates of harm to humans and damage to non-humans. This included the possible numbers living and dead, the reactions to fires and damaged buildings as well as damages to communications, utilities such as phones, water, gas, electricity and sewers.
As a result, when the Germans bombed London in 1940 and 1941, vital services were kept going and her models were updated and modified with the evidence from the real harms and real damage.

After [[World War II]] she returned to University College in London and became a Professor in 1962. In 1968 she moved to California and became a Professor, and in 1970 the Chair, in the Department of Statistics at the [[University of California, Riverside]], and was the book review editor for the journal ''Biometrics'' for four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biometrics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q6VOAQAAIAAJ|year=1993|page=1291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1977 she had retired but moved to the University of California, Berkeley where she continued to teach and do research in Biostatistics.

David died in 1995.&lt;ref name="Salsburg2002" /&gt;{{Contradict-inline|date=October 2018}}

== Awards and recognition==
In 1954 she was elected as a [[Fellow of the American Statistical Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amstat.org/awards/fellowslist.cfm View/Search Fellows of the ASA], accessed 2016-07-23.&lt;/ref&gt;
She was also a Fellow of the [[Institute of Mathematical Statistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.imstat.org/awards/honored_fellows.htm|title=Honored Fellows|publisher=Institute of Mathematical Statistics|accessdate=2017-11-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302125855/http://www.imstat.org/awards/honored_fellows.htm|archive-date=2 March 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In conjunction with other numerous academic honours, in 1992 David won the first Elizabeth L. Scott Award &lt;ref name="JohnsonKotz2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Norman L. Johnson|author2=Samuel Kotz|title=Leading Personalities in Statistical Sciences: From the Seventeenth Century to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AzZZ-uW6WuEC&amp;pg=PA92|date=26 September 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-15072-6|pages=92–}}&lt;/ref&gt; "...for her efforts in opening the door to women in statistics; for contributions to the professions over many years; for contributions to education, science, and public service; for research contributions to combinatorics, statistical methods, applications and understanding history; and her spirit as a lecturer and as a role model.".&lt;ref&gt;"F. N. David Wins First Elizabeth L. Scott Award", AWM Newsletter, May–June 1993, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; The University named a library for her, and in 2001 established the [[Florence Nightingale David Award]].&lt;ref name="Williams2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard H. Williams|title=Twelve British Statisticians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2aPig4bwX0gC&amp;pg=PA37|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Bitingduck Press LLC|isbn=978-1-932482-44-7|pages=37–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributions ==
David's research resulted in advances in  [[combinatorics]], including a clear exposition of complicated methods.  She studied the Correlation coefficient, and computed solutions of complicated multiple integrals, using the distribution of the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|correlation coefficient]].&lt;ref name="Salsburg2002" /&gt;

David investigated the origins and history of probability and statistical ideas. She wrote a book on [[history of probability]], using problems thought of by famous mathematicians and scientists like Cardano and Galileo. It was called ''Games, Gods and Gambling: The Origins and History of Probability''. She "speculat[ed] that [[gambling]] may be the first invention of human society. Her clue to this is the [[talus bone|talus]]. This most common randomizer of ancient times is a predecessor of the [[dice|die]]: the astragalus or talus is the 'knucklebone' or heel bone of a running animal. In creatures such as deer, horse, oxen, sheep and [[hartebeest]] this bone is so formed that when it is thrown to land on a level surface it can come to rest in only four ways. Well polished and often engraved examples are regularly found on the sites of [[ancient Egypt]]. Tomb illustrations and scoring boards make it virtually certain that these were used for gaming."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Hacking]] (1975) [[The Emergence of Probability]], pages 1,2, [[Cambridge University Press]] {{ISBN|0-521-20460-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==
David published ten books and more than 100 papers,&lt;ref name="Salsburg2002" /&gt; including:

* 1962: (with D.E. Barton) ''Combinatorial Chance'' {{ISBN|978-0-85264-057-9}}
* 1962: ''Games, Gods and Gambling'' {{ISBN|978-0-85264-171-2}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2818">In [[algebraic geometry]], a [[complex manifold]] is called '''Fujiki class C''' if it is [[bimeromorphic]] to a compact [[Kähler manifold]].

&lt;math&gt;X\subset M&lt;/math&gt; its complex subvariety. Then ''X''
is also in Fujiki class C (,&lt;ref&gt;A. Fujiki, ''Closedness of the Douady spaces of compact Kahler spaces'',  Publ. Res. Inst. Math. Sci.  14  (1978/79), no. 1, 1--52.{{MathSciNet | id = 486648}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lemma 4.6). Moreover, the [[Douady space]] of ''X'' (that is, the [[moduli space|moduli of deformations]] of  a subvariety &lt;math&gt;X\subset M&lt;/math&gt;, ''M'' fixed) is compact and in Fujiki class C.&lt;ref&gt;A. Fujiki, ''On the Douady space of a compact complex space in the category C.'' Nagoya Math. J. 85 (1982), 189--211.{{MathSciNet | id = 759679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conjectures ==

[[Jean-Pierre Demailly|J.-P. Demailly]] and M. Pǎun have
shown that a manifold is in Fujiki class C if and only
if it supports a [[Kähler current]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Pierre Demailly|Demailly, Jean-Pierre]]; Pǎun, Mihai [https://arxiv.org/abs/math.AG/0105176 ''Numerical characterization of the Kahler cone of a compact Kahler manifold''],  Ann. of Math. (2)  159  (2004),  no. 3, 1247--1274. {{MathSciNet | id = 2113021}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
They also conjectured that a manifold ''M'' is in Fujiki class C if it admits a [[nef current]] which is ''big'', that is, satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;\int_M \omega^{{dim_{\Bbb C} M}}&gt;0.&lt;/math&gt;

For a cohomology class &lt;math&gt;[\omega]\in H^2(M)&lt;/math&gt; which is rational, this statement is known: by [[Grauert-Riemenschneider conjecture]], a holomorphic line bundle ''L'' with first [[Chern class]]

:&lt;math&gt;c_1(L)=[\omega]&lt;/math&gt;

[[Numerically effective|nef]] and big has maximal [[Kodaira dimension]], hence the corresponding rational map to

:&lt;math&gt;{\Bbb P} H^0(L^N)&lt;/math&gt;

is [[generically finite]] onto its image, which is algebraic, and therefore Kähler.

Fujiki&lt;ref&gt;A. Fujiki, ''"On a Compact Complex Manifold in C without Holomorphic 2-Forms,"'' Publ. RIMS 19 (1983). {{MathSciNet | id = 700948}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ueno&lt;ref&gt;K. Ueno, ed., ''"Open Problems,"'' Classification of Algebraic and  Analytic Manifolds, Birkhaser, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; asked whether the property C is stable under deformations. This conjecture was disproven in 1992 by Y.-S. Poon and [[Claude LeBrun ]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Claude LeBrun]], Yat-Sun Poon, [https://arxiv.org/abs/alg-geom/9202006 ''"Twistors, Kahler manifolds, and bimeromorphic geometry II"''], J. Amer. Math. Soc. 5 (1992) {{MathSciNet | id = 1137099}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dr. Gareth Loy''' is an American author, [[composer]], musician and mathematician. Loy is the author&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/computer_music_journal/v032/32.3.ballora.html |author=Mark Ballora |year=2008 |volume=32 |issue=3, Fall |journal=Computer Music Journal |pages=103–105 |title=Musimathics: The Mathematical Foundations of Music, Volume 2 (review) |doi=10.1162/comj.2008.32.3.103}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the two volume series on the intersection of music and mathematics titled ''Musimathics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/AutoSurfRestarter/musimathics-volume-1-the-mathematical-foundations-of-music-by-gareth-loy |accessdate=June 17, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503154131/http://www.slideshare.net/AutoSurfRestarter/musimathics-volume-1-the-mathematical-foundations-of-music-by-gareth-loy |archivedate=May 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Loy was an early practitioner of [[Synthesizer|music synthesis]] at Stanford, and wrote the first software compiler for the Systems Concepts Digital Synthesizer (Samson Box).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/kna/Experiences_Samson_Box.html |title=Experiences with the Samson Box |publisher=Ccrma.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Loy has published the freeware music programming language ''Musimat'', designed specifically for subjects covered in ''Musimathics'', available as a free download.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musimat.com/ |title=Musimat Home Page |publisher=Musimat.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Musimathics was first published in 2006 and 2007, the series continues to evolve with updates by the author and publishers, and the texts are being used in numerous math and music classes at both the graduate and undergraduate level, with more current reviews noting that the originally targeted academic distribution is now reaching a much wider audience. Music synthesis pioneer [[Max Mathews]] stated that Loy's books are a "guided tour-de-force of the mathematics of [[physics]] and [[music]]... Loy has always been a brilliantly clear writer. In ''Musimathics'', he is also an encyclopedic writer. He covers everything needed to understand existing music and musical instruments, or to create new music or new instruments... Loy's book and [[John R. Pierce|John R. Pierce's]] famous ''The Science of Musical Sound'' belong on everyone's bookshelf, and the rest of the shelf can be empty."&lt;ref&gt;Musimathics, V. I, Foreword, p. xv {{ISBN|0-262-12282-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Chowning]] states, in regard to Nekyia and the Samson Box, "After completing the (Samson Box) software, Loy composed Nekyia, a beautiful and powerful composition in four [[Communication channel|channels]] that fully exploited the capabilities of the Samson Box. As an integral part of the (original Stanford) community, Loy has paid back many times over all that he learned, by conceiving the (Samson) system with maximal generality such that it could be used for research projects in [[psychoacoustics]] as well as for hundreds of compositions by a host of composers having diverse compositional strategies."&lt;ref&gt;Musimathics, V. II, p xii, {{ISBN|978-0-262-12285-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biographical background==
Dr. Gareth Loy was born in Los Angeles in 1945. He was an early employee at [[Apple Computer]], and is the brother of the late Dr. Tom Loy, a renowned molecular archaeologist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/10/1030_031030_icemandeath.html |title=Was Ancient Alpine "Iceman" Killed in Battle? |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=2010-10-28 |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and member of the team that researched [[Oetzi the Iceman]].

In the 1960s and 1970s, [[CCRMA#Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics|CCRMA]]&amp;nbsp;– the Center for Research in Music and Acoustics at Stanford University&amp;nbsp;– which was then a research project at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL), developed fundamental technologies later used extensively in the digital synthesizer and digital audio industries. Dr. Loy was a grad student at CCRMA in the mid-70s, and wrote the compiler software for the original [[Samson Box]], which was the original and most powerful and complex digital synthesizer/[[Digital signal processor|processor]] of the day. Since Dr. Loy is both a mathematician and a composer, in addition to the mathematics, [[engineering]] and software code for the Samson Box, Loy also composed Nekyia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdemusic.org/store/cde_search.cfm?keywords=computer%20music%20currents&amp;CFID=101585&amp;CFTOKEN=95602538 |title=Website Unavailable |publisher=Cdemusic.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; a dynamic and powerful four channel composition, to fully demonstrate the capabilities of the Samson Box. Nekyia still stands today as a landmark in [[Digital data|digital]] composition, and maintains its power despite the advances in synthesizer technology since then. Loy received his B.A. from [[San Francisco State University]] in 1975 and his DMA (Doctor of Musical Arts) from Stanford's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and CCRMA, in [[Computer Science]], [[Signal Processing]] and Digital Music Composition in 1980. Gareth lives with his wife Lisa in [[San Rafael, California]].

==Current activities==
In addition to composing, performing and writing journal articles on the technology of mathematics and music, Dr. Loy has been an expert witness in some high visibility cases, performing forensic analysis of technology details. Loy has testified in numerous such cases involving [[Guitar Hero]] and other technologies, performing forensic analysis of technology details to clarify patent issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garethinc.com/GarethLoy_Resume.pdf |accessdate=June 17, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908082722/http://www.garethinc.com/GarethLoy_Resume.pdf |archivedate=September 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composer and performer==
Loy has been a long time member of the Flying Without Instruments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flyingwithoutinstruments.com/ |title=Flying Without Instruments |publisher=Flying Without Instruments |date= |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; band, which has performed internationally, including compositions by Loy. Dr. Loy also composed the score for Das Kapital, a music video based on a poem by Hale Thatcher, and performed by violinist [[János Négyesy]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Loy's composition ''Blood From a Stone'' (1992) was written for an electronic violin designed by [[Max Mathews]] and performed by Negyesy. Gareth also performs in the Tenaya Classical Guitar Duo, and founded the San Francisco performance art group "Hermes," which performed live concerts of abstract electronic music with [[liquid light projection]]s for 5 years in the early 1970s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2910">'''Hilbert's seventh problem''' is one of [[David Hilbert]]'s [[Hilbert problems|list of open mathematical problems]] posed in 1900. It concerns the [[irrational number|irrationality]] and [[transcendental number|transcendence]] of certain numbers (''Irrationalit&amp;auml;t und Transzendenz bestimmter Zahlen'').

==Statement of the problem==
Two specific equivalent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parshin|first1=A. N.|last2=Shafarevich|first2=I. R.|title=Number Theory IV Transcendental Numbers|date=1998|publisher=Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-540-61467-8|pages=146–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; questions are asked:

#In an [[isosceles triangle]], if the ratio of the base [[angle]] to the angle at the vertex is [[algebraic number|algebraic]] but [[irrational number|not rational]], is then the ratio between base and side always [[transcendental number|transcendental]]?
#Is &lt;math&gt;a^b&lt;/math&gt; always [[transcendental number|transcendental]], for [[algebraic number|algebraic]] &lt;math&gt;a \not\in \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt; and [[irrational number|irrational]] algebraic &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;?

==Solution==
The question (in the second form) was answered in the affirmative by [[Aleksandr Gelfond]] in 1934, and refined by [[Theodor Schneider]] in 1935. This result is known as Gelfond's theorem or the [[Gelfond–Schneider theorem]]. (The restriction to irrational ''b'' is important, since it is easy to see that &lt;math&gt;a^b&lt;/math&gt; is algebraic for algebraic ''a'' and rational ''b''.)

From the point of view of generalizations, this is the case

:&lt;math&gt;b \ln{\alpha} + \ln{\beta} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

of the general [[linear form in logarithms]] which was attacked by Gelfond and then solved by [[Alan Baker (mathematician)|Alan Baker]]. It is called the Gelfond conjecture or [[Baker's theorem]]. Baker was awarded a [[Fields Medal]] in 1970 for this achievement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2971">'''Hong Kong Mathematical High Achievers Selection Contest''' (HKMHASC, [[Traditional Chinese]]: 香港青少年數學精英選拔賽) is a yearly [[mathematics competition]] for students of or below [[High School|Secondary]] 3 in [[Hong Kong]]. It is jointly organized by [[Po Leung Kuk]] and [[Hong Kong Association of Science and Mathematics Education]] since the academic year 1998-1999. Recently, there are more than 250 secondary schools participating. 

==Format and Scoring==
Each participating school may send at most 5 students into the contest. There is one paper, divided into Part A and Part B, with two hours given. Part A is usually made up of 14 - 18 easier questions, carrying one mark each. In Part A, only answers are required. Part B is usually made up of 2 - 4 problems with different difficulties, and may carry different number of marks, varying from 4 to 8. In Part B, workings are required and marked.  No [[calculator]]s or calculation assisting equipments (e.g. printed [[mathematical table]]s) are allowed.

==Awards and Further Training==
Awards are given according to the total mark. The top 40 contestants are given the First Honour Award (一等獎), the next 80 the Second Honour Award (二等獎), and the Third Honour Award (三等獎) for the next 120. Moreover, the top 4 can obtain an award, namely the Champion and the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Runner-up. 

Group Awards are given to schools, according to the sum of marks of the 3 contestants with highest mark. The first 4 are given the honour of Champion and 1st, 2nd and 3rd Runner-up. The honour of ''Top 10'' (首十名最佳成績) is given to the 5th-10th, and ''Group Merit Award'' (團體優異獎) is given to the next 10.

First Honour Award achievers would receive further training. Eight students with best performance will be chosen to participate in the [[Invitational World Youth Mathematics Inter-City Competition]] (IWYMIC).

The '''Institute of Mathematics''' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: {{lang|hy|Մաթեմատիկայի Ինստիտուտ}}) is owned and operated by the [[Armenian Academy of Sciences]], located in [[Yerevan]].

==History==
The '''Institute of Mathematics of National Academy of Sciences of Armenia''' originated as the Section for Mathematics and Mechanics, created within the newly formed [[Armenian Academy of Sciences]] in 1944.  The section later developed into an Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics of Armenian Academy of Sciences, whose first Director was academician [[Artashes Shahinian]], known for his results in [[complex analysis]]. The Institute of Mathematics of Armenian Academy of Sciences separated from the latter Institute in 1971. The bearer of the office of the Director of Institute has been academician [[Mkhitar Djrbashian]] (1971-1989, 1989-1994 Honorary Director).

The academicians [[Sergey Mergelyan]], [[Norair Arakelian]], [[Alexandr Talalyan]], [[Raphayel Alexandrian]], [[Rouben V. Ambartzumian]] and [[Anry Nersesyan]] also have greatly influenced the formation of the scientific profile of the Institute and largely contributed to mathematics in general. In particular [[Rouben V. Ambartzumian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.3103/S1068362313010019?no-access=true |doi= 10.3103/S1068362313010019 |volume=48 |title= Academician R. V. Ambartzumian |journal= Journal of Contemporary Mathematical Analysis |pages= 1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; is famous for his work in [[Stochastic geometry|Stochastic Geometry]] and [[Integral geometry|Integral Geometry]], where he created a new branch called Combinatorial Integral Geometry.&lt;ref&gt;1982 – R.V. Ambartzumian. ''Combinatorial Integral Geometry with Applications to Mathematical [[Stereology]]'', John Wiley, Chichester, NY&lt;/ref&gt; He has provided solutions to a number of classical problems in particular the solution to the Buffon Sylvester problem as well as the [[Hilbert's fourth problem#cite note-5|Hilbert's fourth problem]] in dimensions 2&lt;ref&gt;R. V. Ambartzumian. "A note on pseudo-metrics on the plane". ''Zeitschrift für Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie und Verwandte Gebiete''. 1976, Volume 37, Issue 2, pp. 145-155&lt;/ref&gt; and 3.&lt;ref&gt;R. V. Ambartzumian. "Remarks on Combinatorics of Planes in Euclidean Three Dimensions". ''SOP Transactions on Applied Mathematics''. Volume 1, Number 2, pp. 29-43. 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years, the investigations carried out in the Institute concentrated on [[complex analysis|Function Theory]]. Gradually the sphere of investigations expanded and now includes [[differential equations|Differential]] and [[integral equation|Integral]] Equations, [[Functional Analysis]], [[Probability Theory]] and [[Mathematical Statistics]].

==Journals==
The institute has a journal, ''[[Izvestia NAS RA Matematika]]''. The founder and the first Editor in Chief (1971–1990) of the journal was [[Mkhitar Djrbashian]]; under [[Rouben V. Ambartzumian]] Editor in Chief (1990 - 2010) the journal obtained international recognition and obtained an English version, ''[[Journal of Contemporary Mathematical Analysis]]'', published initially by Allerton Press, Inc. New York and later by [[Springer Science+Business Media]]. Journal covers a host of topics including: [[real analysis]] and [[complex analysis]]; [[approximation theory]], [[boundary value problem]]s; [[integral geometry]] and [[stochastic geometry]]; [[differential equations]]; [[probability]] and [[statistics]]; [[integral equations]]; [[algebra]].

==Directors, faculty and members==
At present the Institute has about 30 main researchers as well as a number of associate researchers from [[Yerevan State University]].

[[Norair Arakelian]] in 1970 (Nice) and [[Mkhitar Djrbashian]], [[Rouben V. Ambartzumian]] in 1974 (Vancouver) were invited speakers at the 
[[International Congresses of Mathematicians]].

In [[dynamical systems]], a branch of [[mathematics]], an '''invariant manifold''' is a [[topological manifold]] that is invariant under the action of the dynamical system.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsh M.W., Pugh C.C., Shub M., Invariant Manifolds, Lect. Notes. Math., 583, Springer, Berlin — Heidelberg, 1977 
&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[slow manifold]], [[center manifold]], [[stable manifold]],  unstable manifold, [[subcenter manifold]] and [[inertial manifold]].

Typically, although by no means always, invariant manifolds are constructed as a 'perturbation' of an [[invariant subspace]] about an equilibrium.
In dissipative systems, an invariant manifold based upon the gravest, longest lasting modes forms an effective low-dimensional, reduced, model of the dynamics.
&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Roberts. The utility of an invariant manifold description of the evolution of a dynamical system. SIAM J. Math. Anal., 20:1447–1458, 1989. http://locus.siam.org/SIMA/volume-20/art_0520094.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Consider the [[differential equation]] &lt;math&gt;dx/dt = f(x),\ x \in \mathbb R^n,&lt;/math&gt;
with flow &lt;math&gt;x(t)=\phi_t(x_0)&lt;/math&gt; being the solution of the differential equation with &lt;math&gt;x(0)=x_0&lt;/math&gt;. 
A set &lt;math&gt;S \subset \mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; is called an ''invariant set'' for the differential equation if, for each &lt;math&gt;x_0 \in S&lt;/math&gt;, the solution &lt;math&gt;t \mapsto \phi_t(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;, defined on its maximal interval of existence, has its image in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. Alternatively, the orbit
passing through each &lt;math&gt;x_0 \in S&lt;/math&gt; lies in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. In addition, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is called an ''invariant manifold'' if &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a [[manifold]].
&lt;ref&gt;C. Chicone. Ordinary Differential Equations with Applications, volume 34 of Texts in Applied Mathematics. Springer, 2006, p.34&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Simple 2D dynamical system===

For any fixed parameter &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, consider the variables &lt;math&gt;x(t),y(t)&lt;/math&gt; governed by the pair of coupled differential equations
:&lt;math&gt;dx/dt=ax-xy\quad\text{and}\quad dy/dt=-y+x^2-2y^2.&lt;/math&gt;
The origin is an equilibrium.  This system has two invariant manifolds of interest through the origin.  
* The vertical line &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; is invariant as when &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-equation becomes &lt;math&gt;dx/dt=0&lt;/math&gt; which ensures &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; remains zero.  This invariant manifold,  &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;, is a [[stable manifold]] of the origin (when &lt;math&gt;a\geq0&lt;/math&gt;) as all initial conditions &lt;math&gt;x(0)=0,\ y(0)&gt;-1/2&lt;/math&gt; lead to solutions asymptotically approaching the origin.
* The parabola &lt;math&gt;y=x^2/(1+2a)&lt;/math&gt; is invariant for all parameter &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.  One can see this invariance by considering the time derivative &lt;math&gt;d/dt[y-x^2/(1+2a)]&lt;/math&gt; and finding it is zero on &lt;math&gt;y=x^2/(1+2a)&lt;/math&gt; as required for an invariant manifold.  For &lt;math&gt;a&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; this parabola is the unstable manifold of the origin.  For &lt;math&gt;a=0&lt;/math&gt; this parabola is a [[center manifold]], more precisely a [[slow manifold]], of the origin.
* For &lt;math&gt;a&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; there is only an invariant [[stable manifold]] about the origin, the stable manifold including all &lt;math&gt;(x,y),\ y&gt;-1/2&lt;/math&gt;.

==Invariant manifolds in non-autonomous dynamical systems==

A differential equation  
:&lt;math&gt;dx/dt = f(x,t),\ x \in \mathbb R^n,\ t \in \mathbb R,&lt;/math&gt;
represents a [[Non-autonomous system (mathematics) | non-autonomous dynamical system]],  whose solutions are of the form  &lt;math&gt;x(t;t_0,x_0)=\phi^t_{t_0}(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;   with &lt;math&gt;x(t_0;t_0,x_0)=x_0&lt;/math&gt;. In the extended phase space &lt;math&gt;  \mathbb R^n \times \mathbb R &lt;/math&gt; of such a system, any initial surface &lt;math&gt; M_0\subset \mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; generates an invariant manifold 
:&lt;math&gt;{\mathcal M}=\cup_{t\in \mathbb R}\phi^t_{t_0}(M_0).&lt;/math&gt;
A fundamental question is then how one can locate, out of this large family of  invariant manifolds, the ones that have the highest influence on the overall system dynamics. These most influential invariant manifolds in the extended phase space of a non-autonomous dynamical systems are known as [[Lagrangian coherent structure | Lagrangian Coherent Structures]].&lt;ref name=Haller2015&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev-fluid-010313-141322| title = Lagrangian Coherent Structures| journal = Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics| volume = 47| pages = 137| year = 2015| last1 = Haller | first1 = G. | bibcode = 2015AnRFM..47..137H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isaac Milner''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRS}} (11 January 1750 – 1 April 1820) was a mathematician, an inventor, the President of [[Queens' College, Cambridge]] and [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lucasianchair.org/19/milner.html Lucasian Chair&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was instrumental in the 1785 [[religious conversion]] of [[William Wilberforce]] and helped him through many trials and was a great supporter of the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionists]]' campaign against the [[slave trade]], steeling Wilberforce with his assurance before the 1789 Parliamentary debate:
{{quote|If you carry this point in your whole life, that life will be better spent than in being prime minister of many years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime.shtml BBC Radio 4 In our Time, Feb 22 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He was also a [[natural philosopher]] and the [[Dean of Carlisle]].

==Biography==
Milner was born on 11 January 1750 in Mabgate, Leeds. He began his education at a grammar school in Leeds in 1756, but this ended in 1760 with the death of his father. He was apprenticed as a weaver, reading the classics when time permitted, until his elder brother, [[Joseph Milner]], provided him with an opportunity. Joseph was offered the mastership at Hull's grammar school and invited Isaac to become the institution's usher.

Through the patronage of his brother, Milner was subsequently freed from his duties in Hull and entered [[Queens' College, Cambridge]], as a [[sizar]] in 1770. He graduated with a BA degree as [[senior wrangler]] in 1774, winning the Smith's first prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=MLNR770I|name=Milner, Isaac}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after he took his bachelor's degree he was ordained as deacon; in 1776 Queens' offered him a fellowship; in the following year he became a priest and college tutor; and in 1778 he was presented with the rectory of [[St Botolph's Church, Cambridge]]. However, he was a northerner at heart and thus was sent to reform the management of the Deanery of Carlisle. Taking a scientific approach to the Church of England's most northerly parishes he achieved success for the chapter and diocese. But Milner remained ambitious and seeking promotion he desired a return to Cambridge.

During these years his career as a natural philosopher began to take off. In 1776 [[Nevil Maskelyne]] hired him as a computer for the board of longitude, and two of his mathematical papers were presented to the Royal Society, of which he was elected fellow in 1780. In these papers Milner displayed three things: proficiency in mathematics, suspicion of French philosophy, and adherence to English Newtonian mechanics.  In 1782 the Jacksonian professorship of natural philosophy was established and the syndicate selected Milner as the inaugural professor, a position he retained until 1792.

Besides lecturing, Milner also developed an important process to fabricate nitrous acid, a key ingredient in the production of gunpowder. His paper describing this process was published in the Royal Society's Philosophical Transactions in 1789 alongside an article of [[Joseph Priestley]]'s, and the two corresponded on the subject. In later years Milner transferred his elaborate collection of chemical apparatus into the president's lodge at Queens' and performed experiments with E. D. Clarke, [[William Whewell]], and the Wollaston brothers; he also collaborated with [[Humphry Davy]] and [[Joseph Banks]] in an attempt to cure gout.

Over the span of his forty-five-year career, Milner's scientific sentiments came to reflect his religious sentiments strongly. Although he never parted from the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] fold, he came to embrace the central evangelical doctrines of the late eighteenth century. Milner, with [[Charles Simeon]], was largely responsible for the evangelical revival at Cambridge in post as Master of Queens' College.  Indeed, throughout the years of his tenure he dramatically changed the entire complexion of the college.  He was also responsible for the conversion of [[William Wilberforce]], which occurred during their long continental tour of 1784–5. The parliamentary act of 1807 to abolish slavery owed much to their partnership. Milner's co-authorship of the seven-volume ''Ecclesiastical History of the Church of Christ'' (1818) with his brother Joseph also earned him nationwide renown.

After his death Milner was remembered for his astonishing intellect, his peculiar lifestyle, his tremendous physical bulk and his part in the rise in evangelicalism. [[Thomas De Quincey]], in his preface to the Confessions, deemed Milner an 'eloquent and benevolent' opium user.

In [[graph theory]], the '''Kelmans–Seymour conjecture''' states that every [[k-vertex-connected graph|5-vertex-connected]] graph that is not [[planar graph|planar]] contains a [[Homeomorphism (graph theory)|subdivision]] of the 5-vertex [[complete graph]] {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}}. It is named for [[Paul Seymour (mathematician)|Paul Seymour]] and Alexander Kelmans, who independently described the conjecture; Seymour in 1977 and Kelmans in 1979.&lt;ref name=Solved&gt;{{citation|url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/mathematics/maths-mystery-solved-after-40-years|title=Maths mystery solved after 40 years|magazine=Cosmos|first=Bill|last=Condie|date=May 30, 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By [[Kuratowski's theorem]], a nonplanar graph necessarily contains a subdivision of either {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}} or the [[complete bipartite graph]] {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;3,3&lt;/sub&gt;}}.
The conjecture refines this by providing a condition under which one of these two graphs can be guaranteed to exist. In this sense, it is the analogue for [[topological minor]]s of [[Wagner's theorem]] that 4-connected nonplanar graphs contain {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}} as a [[graph minor]].

In 2016, a proof was claimed by Xingxing Yu of the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] and his Ph.D. students Dawei He and Yan Wang.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv|last=He|first=Dawei|last2=Wang|first2=Yan|last3=Yu|first3=Xingxing|date=2015-11-16|title=The Kelmans-Seymour conjecture I: special separations|eprint=1511.05020|class=math.CO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv|last=He|first=Dawei|last2=Wang|first2=Yan|last3=Yu|first3=Xingxing|date=2016-02-24|title=The Kelmans-Seymour conjecture II: 2-vertices in $K_4^-$|eprint=1602.07557|class=math.CO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[algebra]], '''[[linear equation]]s''' and '''[[systems of linear equations]]''' over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] are widely studied. "Over a field" means that the [[coefficient]]s of the equations and the solutions that one is looking for belong to a given field, commonly the [[real number|real]] or the [[complex number]]s. This article is devoted to the same problems where "field" is replaced by "[[commutative ring]]", or, typically "[[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]] [[integral domain]]".

In the case of a single equation, the problem splits in two parts. First, the '''ideal membership problem''', which consists, given a non homogeneous equation
:&lt;math&gt;a_1x_1 + \cdots + a_kx_k=b&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;a_1, \ldots, a_k&lt;/math&gt; and {{math|''b''}} in a given ring {{math|''R''}}, to decide if it has a solution with &lt;math&gt;x_1, \ldots, x_k&lt;/math&gt; in {{math|''R''}}, and, if any, to provide one. This amounts to decide if {{math|''b''}} belongs to the ideal generated by the {{math|''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. The simplest instance of this problem is, for ''k'' = 1 and {{math|1=''b'' = 1}}, to decide if {{math|''a''}} is a unit in {{math|''R''}}.

The '''syzygy problem''' consists, given ''k'' elements &lt;math&gt;a_1, \ldots, a_k&lt;/math&gt; in {{math|''R''}}, to provide a system of generators of the [[module (mathematics)|module]] of the [[Syzygy (mathematics)|syzygies]] of &lt;math&gt;(a_1, \ldots, a_k),&lt;/math&gt; that is a system of generators of the [[submodule]] of those elements &lt;math&gt;(x_1, \ldots, x_k)&lt;/math&gt; in {{math|''R''}}&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; that are solution of the homogeneous equation
:&lt;math&gt;a_1x_1 + \cdots + a_kx_k=0.&lt;/math&gt; 
The simplest case, when ''k'' = 1 amounts to find a system of generators of the [[Annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]] of {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Given a solution of the ideal membership problem, one obtains all the solutions by adding to it the elements of the module of syzygies. In other words, all the solutions are provided by the solution of these two partial problems.

In the case of several equations, the same decomposition into subproblems occurs. The first problem becomes the '''submodule membership problem'''. The second one is also called the '''syzygy problem'''.

A ring such that there are algorithms for the arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) and for the above problems may be called a '''computable ring''', or '''effective ring'''. One may also say that linear algebra on the ring is '''effective'''.

The article considers the main rings for which linear algebra is effective.

==Generalities==
To be able of solving the syzygy problem, it is necessary that the module of syzygies is finitely generated, because it is impossible to output an infinite list. Therefore the problems considered here make sense only for [[Noetherian ring]]s, or at least a [[coherent ring]]. In fact, this article is restricted to Noetherian [[integral domain]]s because of the following result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Constructive aspects of Noetherian rings|last=Richman|first=Fred|journal=Proc. Amer. Math. Soc.|year=1974|volume=44|pages=436–441|doi=10.1090/s0002-9939-1974-0416874-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Given a Noetherian integral domain, if there are [[algorithm]]s to solve the ideal membership problem and the syzygies problem for a single equation, then one may deduce from them algorithms for the similar problems concerning systems of equations.''

This theorem is useful to prove the existence of algorithms. However, in practice, the algorithms for the systems are designed directly, as it is done for the systems of linear equations over a field.

===Properties of effective rings===
Let ''R'' be an effective commutative ring. 
*There is an algorithm for testing if an element ''a'' is a [[zero divisor]]: this amounts to solve the linear equation {{math|1=''ax'' = 0}}.
*There is an algorithm for testing if an element ''a'' is a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]], and if it is, computing its inverse: this amounts to solve the linear equation {{math|1=''ax'' = 1}}.
*Given an ideal ''I'' generated by {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, there is an algorithm for testing if two elements of ''R'' have the same image in ''R''/''I'', and linear algebra is effective over ''R''/''I'': testing the equality of the images of ''a'' and ''b'' amounts to solve the equation {{math|1=''a'' = ''b'' + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ⋅⋅⋅ + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;''z''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}}; for solving a linear system over ''R''/''I'', it suffices to write it over ''R'' and to add to one side of the ''i''th equation {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''z''&lt;sub&gt;''i'',1&lt;/sub&gt; + ⋅⋅⋅ + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;''z''&lt;sub&gt;''i'',''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (for ''i'' = 1, ...), where the {{math|''z''&lt;sub&gt;''i'',''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are new unknowns.

== Linear equations over the integers or a principal ideal domain ==

There are algorithms to solve all the problems addressed in this article over the integers. In other words, ''linear algebra is effective over the integers''. See [[Linear Diophantine system]] for details.

The same solution applies to the same problems over a [[principal ideal domain]], with the following modifications.

The notion of [[unimodular matrix]] of integers must be extended by calling ''unimodular'' a matrix over a [[integral domain]] whose [[determinant]] is a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]]. This means that the determinant is [[invertible]] and implies that unimodular matrices are the [[invertible matrices]] such all entries of the [[inverse matrix]] belong to the domain.

To have an algorithmic solution of linear systems, a solution for a single linear equation in two unknowns is clearly required. In the case of the integers, such a solution is provided by [[extended Euclidean algorithm]]. Thus one needs that, for the considered principal ideal domain, there is an algorithm with a similar specification as the extended Euclidean algorithm. That is, given ''a'' and ''b'' in the principal ideal domain, there is an algorithm computing a unimodular matrix 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}  s&amp;t\\u&amp;v \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
such that 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}  s&amp;t\\u&amp;v \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}  a\\b \end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix}\gcd(a,b)\\0 \end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

Having such an algorithm, the [[Smith normal form]] of a matrix may be computed exactly as in the integer case, and this suffices to apply the method of [[Linear Diophantine system]].

The main case where this is commonly used is the case of linear systems over the ring of [[univariate polynomial]]s over a field. In this case, the extended Euclidean algorithm may be used. See [[polynomial greatest common divisor#Bézout's identity and extended GCD algorithm]] for details.

The '''Linux Unified Key Setup''' ('''LUKS''') is a [[disk encryption]] specification created by Clemens Fruhwirth in 2004 and originally intended for [[Linux]].

While most [[disk encryption software]] implements different, incompatible, and undocumented formats, LUKS implements a platform-independent standard on-disk format for use in various tools. This not only facilitates compatibility and interoperability among different programs, but also assures that they all implement [[password management]] in a secure and documented manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/wikis/LUKS-standard/on-disk-format.pdf |title=LUKS On-Disk Format Specification Version 1.2.1 |first=Clemens |last=Fruhwirth |date=2011-10-16 |accessdate=2015-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[reference implementation (computing) | reference implementation]] for LUKS operates on Linux and is based on an enhanced version of [[cryptsetup]], using [[dm-crypt]] as the disk encryption backend. Under [[Microsoft]] [[Windows]], LUKS-encrypted disks can be used with the now defunct [[LibreCrypt]] (formerly [[DoxBox]]).

LUKS is designed to conform to the [[TKS1]] secure key setup scheme.&lt;ref name=tks1&gt;{{cite paper |author=Clemens Fruhwirth |title=TKS1 &amp;ndash; An anti-forensic, two level, and iterated key setup scheme |work=draft |url=http://clemens.endorphin.org/TKS1-draft.pdf |format=PDF |date=2004-07-15 |accessdate=2006-12-12 }}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3176">In [[probability theory]], the '''martingale representation theorem''' states that a random variable that is [[measurable]] with respect to the [[Filtration (probability theory)|filtration]] generated by a [[Brownian motion]] can be written in terms of an [[Itô integral]] with respect to this Brownian motion.

The theorem only asserts the existence of the representation and does not help to find it explicitly; it is possible in many cases to determine the form of the representation using [[Malliavin calculus]].

Similar theorems also exist for [[Martingale (probability theory)|martingales]] on filtrations induced by [[jump process]]es, for example, by [[Markov chain]]s.

==Statement of the theorem==
Let &lt;math&gt;B_t&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Brownian motion]] on a standard [[filtered probability space]] &lt;math&gt;(\Omega, \mathcal{F},\mathcal{F}_t, P )&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}_t&lt;/math&gt; be the [[augmented filtration]] generated by &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. If ''X'' is a [[square integrable]] random variable measurable with respect to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}_\infty&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a [[predictable process]] ''C'' which is [[adapted process|adapted]] with respect to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}_t&lt;/math&gt;, such that

:&lt;math&gt;X = E(X) + \int_0^\infty C_s\,dB_s.&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently,

:&lt;math&gt; E(X| \mathcal{G}_t) = E(X) + \int_0^t C_s \, d B_s.&lt;/math&gt;

==Application in finance==
The martingale representation theorem can be used to establish the existence
of a [[hedge (finance)|hedging]] strategy.
Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\left ( M_t \right )_{0 \le t &lt; \infty}&lt;/math&gt; is a Q-martingale process, whose [[volatility (finance)|volatility]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma_t&lt;/math&gt; is always non-zero.
Then, if &lt;math&gt;\left ( N_t \right )_{0 \le t &lt; \infty}&lt;/math&gt; is any other Q-martingale, there exists an &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;-previsible process &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, unique up to sets of measure 0, such that &lt;math&gt;\int_0^T \phi_t^2 \sigma_t^2 \, dt &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt; with probability one, and ''N'' can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;N_t = N_0 + \int_0^t \phi_s\, d M_s.&lt;/math&gt;

The replicating strategy is defined to be:
* hold &lt;math&gt;\phi_t&lt;/math&gt; units of the stock at the time ''t'', and
* hold &lt;math&gt;\psi_t B_t =  C_t - \phi_t Z_t&lt;/math&gt; units of the bond.
where &lt;math&gt;Z_t&lt;/math&gt; is the stock price discounted by the bond price to time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_t&lt;/math&gt; is the expected payoff of the option at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

At the expiration day ''T'', the value of the portfolio is:
:&lt;math&gt;V_T = \phi_T S_T + \psi_T B_T = C_T = X&lt;/math&gt;

and it's easy to check that the strategy is self-financing: the change in the value of the portfolio only depends on the change of the asset prices &lt;math&gt;\left ( dV_t = \phi_t d S_t + \psi_t\, d B_t \right ) &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Minimalist grammars''' are a class of [[formal grammar]]s that aim to provide a more rigorous, usually proof-theoretic, formalization of Chomskyan [[Minimalist program]] than is normally provided in the mainstream Minimalist literature. A variety of particular formalizations exist, most of them developed by [[Edward Stabler]], Alain Lecomte, Christian Retoré, or combinations thereof. 

==Lecomte and Retoré's extensions of the Lambek Calculus==

Lecomte and Retoré (2001) &lt;ref name="lecomte_retore_2001"&gt;{{cite book| author=Lecomte, A., Retoré, C.| chapter=Extending Lambek Grammars: A Logical Account of Minimalist Grammars| title=Proc. 39th Ann. Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics| year=2001| pages=362–369}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduce a formalism that modifies that core of the Lambek Calculus to allow for movement-like processes to be described without resort to the combinatorics of [[Combinatory categorial grammar]]. The formalism is presented in proof-theoretic terms. Differing only slightly in notation from Lecomte and Retoré (2001), we can define a minimalist grammar as a 3-tuple &lt;math&gt;G = (C, F, L)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a set of "categorial" features, &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a set of "functional" features (which come in two flavors, "weak", denoted simply &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, and "strong", denoted &lt;math&gt;f*&lt;/math&gt;), and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is a set of lexical atoms, denoted as pairs &lt;math&gt;w : t&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is some phonological/orthographic content, and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is a syntactic type defined recursively as follows:

: all features in &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; are (atomic) types, and

: if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; are types, so are &lt;math&gt;X/Y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;X \backslash Y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;X \circ Y&lt;/math&gt;.

We can now define 6 inference rules:

: &lt;math&gt;\vdash w : X&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;w : X \in L&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;w : X \vdash w : X&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;w : X \notin L&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Gamma \vdash a : X/Y \qquad \Gamma' \vdash b : Y}{\Gamma; \Gamma' \vdash ab : X}[/E]&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Gamma' \vdash b : Y \qquad \Gamma \vdash a : X\backslash Y}{\Gamma'; \Gamma \vdash ba : X}[\backslash E]&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Gamma; \Gamma' \vdash \alpha}{\Gamma, \Gamma' \vdash \alpha} entropy&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Gamma \vdash a : X \circ Y \qquad \Delta, b : X, c : Y, \Delta' \vdash d : Z}{\Delta, \Gamma, \Delta' \vdash d[b := a, c := a] : Z}[\circ E]&lt;/math&gt;

The first rule merely makes it possible to use lexical items with no extra assumptions. The second rule is just a means of introducing assumptions into the derivation. The third and fourth rules just perform directional feature checking, combining the assumptions required to build the subparts that are being combined. The entropy rule presumably allows the ordered sequents to be broken up into unordered sequents. And finally, the last rule implements "movement" by means of assumption elimination.

The last rule can be given a number of different interpretations in order to fully mimic movement of the normal sort found in the Minimalist Program. The account given by Lecomte and Retoré (2001) is that if one of the product types is a strong functional feature, then the phonological/orthographic content associated with that type on the right is substituted with the content of the ''a'', and the other is substituted with the empty string; whereas if neither is strong, then the phonological/orthographic content is substituted for the category feature, and the empty string is substituted for the weak functional feature. That is, we can rephrase the rule as two sub-rules as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Gamma \vdash a : X \circ Y^{*} \qquad \Delta, b : X, c : Y^{*}, \Delta' \vdash d : Z}{\Delta, \Gamma, \Delta' \vdash d[b := \epsilon, c := a] : Z}[\circ E_{strong}]&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;X \in C, Y^{*} \in F&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Gamma \vdash a : X \circ Y \qquad \Delta, b : X, c : Y, \Delta' \vdash d : Z}{\Delta, \Gamma, \Delta' \vdash d[b := a, c := \epsilon] : Z}[\circ E_{weak}]&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;X \in C, Y \in F&lt;/math&gt;

Another alternative would be to construct pairs in the ''/E'' and ''\E'' steps, and use the &lt;math&gt;\circ E&lt;/math&gt; rule as given, substituting the phonological/orthographic content ''a'' into the highest of the substitution positions, and the empty string in the rest of the positions. This would be more in line with the Minimalist Program, given that multiple movements of an item are possible, where only the highest position is "spelled out".

==Example==

As a simple example of this system, we can show how to generate the sentence ''who did John see'' with the following toy grammar:

Let &lt;math&gt;G = (\{N, S\}, \{W\}, L)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''L'' contains the following words:

: &lt;math&gt;\text{John} : N\ &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\text{see} : (S\backslash N)/N&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\text{did} : (S\backslash W)/S&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\text{who} : N \circ W&lt;/math&gt;

The proof for the sentence ''who did John see'' is therefore:

: &lt;math&gt;\dfrac{
	\vdash \text{who} : N \circ W
	\quad
	\dfrac{
		\text{x} : W \vdash \text{x} : W
		\quad
		\dfrac{
			\vdash \text{did} : (S\backslash W)/S
			\quad
			\dfrac{
				\vdash \text{John} : N
				\quad
				\dfrac{
					\text{y} : N \vdash \text{y} : N
					\quad
					\vdash \text{see} : (S\backslash N)/N
				}{
					\text{y} : N \vdash \text{see y} : S\backslash N
				}[/E]
			}{
				\text{y} : N \vdash \text{John see y} : S
			}[\backslash E]
		}{
			\text{y} : N \vdash \text{did John see y} : S\backslash W
		}[/E]
	}{
		\text{x} : W, \text{y} : N \vdash \text{x did John see y} : S
	}[\backslash E]
}{
	\vdash \text{who did John see} : S
}[\circ E]&lt;/math&gt;

(External flows are movements of value such as transfers of cash, securities or other instruments in or out of the portfolio, with no equal simultaneous movement of value in the opposite direction, and which are not income from the investments in the portfolio, such as interest, coupons or dividends.) To calculate the modified Dietz return, divide the gain or loss in value, net of external flows, by the average capital over the period of measurement. The result of the calculation is expressed as a percentage [[rate of return|return]] over the holding period. The average capital weights individual cash flows by the amount of time from when those cash flows occur until the end of the period.

This method has the practical advantage over [[internal rate of return]] (IRR) method that it does not require repeated trial and error to get a result.&lt;ref name="Feibel2003"&gt;{{cite book

|quote=One of these return calculation methods, the Modified Dietz method, is still the most common way of calculating periodic investment returns.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cash flows used in the formula are weighted based on the time they occurred in the period. For example, if they occurred in the beginning of the month they would have a higher weight than if they occurred at the end of the month. This is different from the [[simple Dietz method]], in which the cash flows are weighted equally regardless of when they occurred during the measurement period, which works on an assumption that the flows are distributed evenly throughout the period.

With the advance of technology, most systems can calculate a true time-weighted return by calculating a daily return and geometrically linking in order to get a monthly, quarterly, annual or any other period return. However, the modified Dietz method remains useful for performance attribution, because it still has the advantage of allowing modified Dietz returns on assets to be combined with weights in a portfolio, calculated according to average invested capital, and the weighted average gives the modified Dietz return on the portfolio. Time weighted returns do not allow this.

This method for return calculation is used in modern portfolio management.  It is one of the methodologies of calculating returns recommended by the Investment Performance Council (IPC) as part of their Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS).  The GIPS are intended to provide consistency to the way portfolio returns are calculated internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®) Guidance Statement on Calculation Methodology|url=http://www.gipsstandards.org/standards/guidance/documents/develop/calcmethod.pdf|format=pdf|publisher=IPC|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The method is named after Peter O. Dietz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

His approximation was therefore to generate money weighted rates of return for the period. Because there is a GIPS requirement to produce a valuation on a monthly basis at least, using modified Dietz with monthly valuations provides a series of individual monthly money-weighted rates with which can be compounded together to produce a good quality approximation for the longer time period time weighted rate of return&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dietz|first=Peter|date=May 1968|title=Measurement of Performance of Security Portfolios

==Formula==

The formula for the modified Dietz method is as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\cfrac{\text {gain or loss}}{\text {average  capital}}= \cfrac{ B - A - F}{ A + \sum_{i=1}^n W_i \times F_i}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the starting market value

:&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is the ending market value

:&lt;math&gt;F = \sum_{i=1}^n F_i&lt;/math&gt; is the net external inflow for the period (so contributions to a portfolio are treated as positive flows while withdrawals are negative flows)

and

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n W_i \times {F_i} = &lt;/math&gt; the sum of each flow  &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; multiplied by its weight &lt;math&gt;W_i&lt;/math&gt;

The weight &lt;math&gt;W_i&lt;/math&gt;  is the proportion of the time period between the point in time when the flow &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; occurs and the end of the period. Assuming that the flow happens at the end of the day, &lt;math&gt;W_i&lt;/math&gt;  can be calculated as

:&lt;math&gt; W_i = \frac{C-D_i}{C}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the number of calendar days during the return period being calculated, which equals end date minus start date (plus 1, unless you adopt the convention that the start date is the same as the end date of the previous period)
:&lt;math&gt;D_i&lt;/math&gt; is the number of days from the start of the return period until the day on which the flow &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; occurred.

This assumes that the flow happens at the end of the day. If the flow happens at the beginning of the day, the flow is in the portfolio for an additional day, so use the following formula for calculating the weight: 
:&lt;math&gt; W_i = \frac{C -D_i + 1}{C}&lt;/math&gt;

==Adjustments==
If either the start or the end value is zero, or both, the start and/or end dates need to be adjusted to cover the period over which the portfolio has content.

===Example===
Suppose we are calculating the 2016 calendar year return, and that the portfolio is empty until a transfer in of EUR 1m cash in a non-interest bearing account on Friday 30 December. By the end of the day on Saturday 31 December 2016, the exchange rate between euros and Hong Kong dollars has changed from 8.1 HKD per EUR to 8.181, which is a 1 percent increase in value, measured in Hong Kong dollar terms, so the right answer to the question of what is the return in Hong Kong dollars is intuitively 1 percent.

However, blindly applying the modified Dietz formula, using an end-of-day transaction timing assumption, the day-weighting on the inflow of 8.1m HKD on 30 December, one day before the end of the year, is 1/366, and the average capital is calculated as:

:{{nowrap begin}}{{link if exists|start value}} + [[Capital inflows|inflow]] &amp;times; {{link if exists|weight}} = 0 + 8.1m {{link if exists| HKD}} &amp;times; 1/366 = 22,131.15 {{link if exists| HKD}}{{nowrap end}}

and the gain is:

:{{nowrap begin}}{{link if exists|end value}} - {{link if exists|start value}} - {{link if exists|net inflow}} = 8,181,000 - 0 - 8,100,000 = 81,000 {{link if exists| HKD}}{{nowrap end}}

so the modified Dietz return is calculated as:

:{{nowrap begin}}{{sfrac|{{link if exists|gain or loss}}|{{link if exists|average capital}}}} = {{sfrac|81,000|22,131.15}} = 366 %{{nowrap end}}

So which is the correct return, 1 percent or 366 percent?

===Adjusted time interval===
The only sensible answer to the example above is that the holding period return is unambiguously 1 percent. This means the start date should be adjusted to the date of the initial external flow. Likewise, if the portfolio is empty at the end of the period, the end date should be adjusted to the final external flow. The end value is effectively the final external flow, not zero.

The return annualized using a simple method of multiplying-up 1 percent per day by the number of days in the year will give the answer 366 percent, but the holding period return is still 1 percent.

===Example corrected===
The example above is corrected if the start date is adjusted to the end of the day on 30 December, and the start value is now 8.1m HKD. There are no external flows thereafter.

The corrected gain or loss is the same as before:

:{{nowrap begin}}{{link if exists|end value}} - {{link if exists|start value}} = 8,181,000 - 8,100,000 = 81,000 {{link if exists| HKD}}{{nowrap end}}

but the corrected average capital is now:

:{{nowrap begin}}{{link if exists|start value}} + {{link if exists|weighted net inflows}} = 8.1m {{link if exists| HKD}}{{nowrap end}}

so the corrected modified Dietz return is now:

:{{nowrap begin}}{{sfrac|{{link if exists|gain or loss}}|{{link if exists|average capital}}}} = {{sfrac|81,000|8.1m}} = 1 %{{nowrap end}}

===Second example===
Suppose that a bond is bought for HKD 1,128,728 including accrued interest and commission on trade date 14 November, and sold again three days later on trade date 17 November for HKD 1,125,990 (again, net of accrued interest and commission). Assuming transactions take place at the start of the day, what is the modified Dietz holding-period return in HKD for this bond holding over the year to-date until the end-of-day on 17 November?

====Answer====
The answer is that firstly, the reference to the holding period year to-date until the end-of-day on 17 November includes both the purchase and the sale. This means the effective adjusted holding period is actually from the purchase at the start of the day on 14 November until it is sold three days later on 17 November. The adjusted start value is the net amount of the purchase, the end value is the net amount of the sale, and there are no other external flows.

:{{nowrap begin}}{{link if exists|start value}} = 1,128,728 {{link if exists| HKD}}{{nowrap end}}

:{{nowrap begin}}{{link if exists|end value}} = 1,125,990 {{link if exists| HKD}}{{nowrap end}}

There are no flows, so the gain or loss is:

:{{nowrap begin}}{{link if exists|end value}} - {{link if exists|start value}} = 1,125,990 - 1,128,728 = -2,738 {{link if exists| HKD}}{{nowrap end}}

and the average capital equals the start value, so the modified Dietz return is:

:{{nowrap begin}}{{sfrac|{{link if exists|gain or loss}}|{{link if exists|average capital}}}} = {{sfrac|-2,738|1,128,728}} = -0.24 % 2 d.p.{{nowrap end}}

===Contributions - when not to adjust the holding period===
This method of restricting the calculation to the actual holding period by applying an adjusted start or end date applies when the return is calculated on an investment in isolation. When the investment belongs inside a portfolio, and the weight of the investment in the portfolio, and the contribution of that return to that of the portfolio as a whole is required, it is necessary to compare like with like, in terms of a common holding period.

====Example====
Suppose that at the beginning of the year, a portfolio contains cash, of value $10,000, in an account which bears interest without any charges. At the beginning of the third quarter, $8,000 of that cash is invested in some US dollar shares (in company X). The investor applies a buy-and-hold strategy, and there are further transactions for the remainder of the year. At the end of the year, the shares have increased in value by 10% to $8,800, and $100 interest is capitalized into the cash account.

What is the return on the portfolio and the cash account over the year, and what are the contributions from the cash account and the shares? Furthermore, what is the return on the cash account?

=====Answer=====
The end value of the portfolio is $2,100 in cash, plus shares worth $8,800, which is in total $10,900. There has been a 9 percent increase in value since the beginning of the year. There are no external flows in or out of the portfolio over the year.

:{{nowrap begin}}{{link if exists|weighted flows}} = 0{{nowrap end}}

so

:{{nowrap begin}}{{link if exists|average capital}} = {{link if exists|start value}} = $10,000 {{nowrap end}}

so the return is:

:{{nowrap begin}}{{sfrac|{{link if exists|gain or loss}}|{{link if exists|average capital}}}} = {{sfrac|900|10,000}} = 9 %{{nowrap end}}

This 9% portfolio return breaks down between 8 percent contribution from the $800 earned on the shares and 1 percent contribution from the $100 interest earned on the cash account, but how more generally can we calculate contributions?

The first step is to calculate the average capital in each of the cash account and the shares over the full year period. These should sum to the $10,000 average capital of the portfolio as a whole. From the average capital of each of the two components of the portfolio, we can calculate weights. The weight of the cash account is the average capital of the cash account, divided by the average capital ($10,000) of the portfolio, and the weight of the shares is the average capital of the shares over the whole year, divided by the average capital of the portfolio.

For convenience, we will assume the time weight of the outflow of $8,000 cash to pay for the shares is exactly 1/4. This means that the four quarters of the year are treated as having equal length.

The average capital of the cash account is:

:{{nowrap begin}}{{link if exists|average capital}}{{nowrap end}}
::{{nowrap begin}}= {{link if exists|start value}} - {{link if exists|time weight}} &amp;times; {{link if exists|outflow amount}}{{nowrap end}}
::{{nowrap begin}}= 10,000 - {{sfrac|1|4}} &amp;times; $8,000{{nowrap end}}
::{{nowrap begin}}= 10,000 - $2,000{{nowrap end}}
::{{nowrap begin}}= $8,000{{nowrap end}}

The average capital of the shares over the last quarter requires no calculation, because there are no flows after the beginning of the last quarter. It is the $8,000 invested in the shares. However, the average capital in the shares over the whole year is something else. The start value of the shares at the beginning of the year was zero, and there was an inflow of $8,000 at the beginning of the last quarter, so:
:{{nowrap begin}}{{link if exists|average capital}}{{nowrap end}}
::{{nowrap begin}}= {{link if exists|start value}} - {{link if exists|time weight}} &amp;times; {{link if exists|outflow amount}}{{nowrap end}}
::{{nowrap begin}}= 0 + {{sfrac|1|4}} &amp;times; $8,000{{nowrap end}}
::{{nowrap begin}}= $2,000{{nowrap end}}

We can see immediately that the weight of the cash account in the portfolio over the year was:

:{{nowrap begin}}{{sfrac|{{link if exists|average capital in the cash account}}|{{link if exists|average capital in the portfolio}}}}{{nowrap end}}
::{{nowrap begin}}= {{sfrac|8,000|10,000}}{{nowrap end}}
::{{nowrap begin}}= 80 %{{nowrap end}}

and the weight of the shares was:

:{{nowrap begin}}{{sfrac|{{link if exists|average capital in shares}}|{{link if exists|average capital in the portfolio}}}}{{nowrap end}}
::{{nowrap begin}}= {{sfrac|2,000|10,000}}{{nowrap end}}
::{{nowrap begin}}= 20 %{{nowrap end}}

which sum to 100 percent.

We can calculate the return on the cash account, which was:

:{{nowrap begin}}{{sfrac|{{link if exists|gain or loss}}|{{link if exists|average capital}}}} = {{sfrac|100|8,000}} = 1.25 %{{nowrap end}}

The contribution to the portfolio return is:

:{{nowrap begin}}{{link if exists|weight}} &amp;times; [[Rate of return|return]] = 80 % &amp;times; 1.25 % = 1 %{{nowrap end}}

How about the contribution to the portfolio return from the shares?

The adjusted holding period return on the shares is 10 percent. If we multiply this by the 20 percent weight of the shares in the portfolio, the result is only 2 percent, but the correct contribution is 8 percent.

The answer is to use the return on the shares over the unadjusted full-year period to calculate the contribution:

:{{nowrap begin}}{{link if exists|Unadjusted period return}}{{nowrap end}}
::{{nowrap begin}}= {{sfrac|{{link if exists|gain or loss}}|{{link if exists|unadjusted period average capital}}}}{{nowrap end}}
::{{nowrap begin}}= {{sfrac|800|2,000}}{{nowrap end}}
::{{nowrap begin}}= 40 %{{nowrap end}}

Then the contribution from the shares to the portfolio return is:

:{{nowrap begin}}{{link if exists|weight}} &amp;times; {{link if exists|unadjusted period return}}{{nowrap end}}
::{{nowrap begin}}= 20% &amp;times; 40 % = 8 %{{nowrap end}}

This does not mean that the correct holding period return on the shares is 40 percent, but for calculation of the contribution, use the unadjusted period return, which is the 40 percent figure, not the actual 10 percent holding period return.

==Fees==
To measure returns net of fees, allow the value of the portfolio to be reduced by the amount of the fees. To calculate returns gross of fees, compensate for them by treating them as an external flow, and exclude accrued fees from valuations.

==Comparison with time-weighted return and internal rate of return==
The modified Dietz method has the practical advantage over the [[true time-weighted rate of return]] method, in that the calculation of a modified Dietz return does not require portfolio valuations at each point in time whenever an external flow occurs. The [[internal rate of return]] method shares this practical advantage with the modified Dietz method.

The modified Dietz method has the practical advantage over the [[internal rate of return]] method, in that there is a formula for the modified Dietz return, whereas iterative numerical methods are usually required to estimate the internal rate of return.

The modified Dietz method is based upon a simple rate of interest principle. It approximates the [[internal rate of return]] method, which applies a compounding principle, but if the flows and rates of return are large enough, the results of the Modified Dietz method will significantly diverge from the internal rate of return.

The modified Dietz return is the solution &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; to the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;B = A \times (1+R)+ \sum_{i=1}^n F_i \times (1+R \times \frac{T - t_i}{T})&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the start value

:&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is the end value

:&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the total length of time period

and

:&lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt; is the time between the start of the period and flow &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;

Compare this with the (unannualized) [[internal rate of return]] (IRR). The IRR (or more strictly speaking, an un-annualized holding period return version of the IRR) is a solution &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; to the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;B = A \times (1+R)+ \sum_{i=1}^n F_i \times (1+R)^ \frac{T - t_i}{T}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, suppose the value of a portfolio is $100 at the beginning of the first year, and $300 at the end of the second year, and there is an inflow of $50 at the end of the first year/beginning of the second year. (Suppose further that neither year is a leap year, so the two years are of equal length.)

To calculate the gain or loss over the two-year period,

:&lt;math&gt;\text {gain or loss} = B - A - F = 300 - 100 - 50 = $150\text{.}&lt;/math&gt;

To calculate the average capital over the two-year period,

:&lt;math&gt;\text {average capital} = A + \sum \text {weight} \times \text {flow} = 100 + 0.5 \times 50 = $125\text{,}&lt;/math&gt;

so the modified Dietz return is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\text {gain or loss}}{\text {average capital}} = \frac {150}{125} = 120\%&lt;/math&gt;

The (unannualized) internal rate of return in this example is 125%:

:&lt;math&gt;300 = 100 \times (1 + 125\%)+ 50 \times (1+125\%)^ \frac{2 - 1}{2} = 225 + 50 \times 150\% = 225 + 75&lt;/math&gt;

so in this case, the modified Dietz return is noticeably less than the unannualized IRR. This divergence between the modified Dietz return and the unannualized internal rate of return is due to a significant flow within the period, and the fact that the returns are large.

==Annual rate of return==
Note that the Modified Dietz return is a holding-period return, not an annual rate of return, unless the period happens to be one year. Annualisation, which is conversion of the holding-period return to an annual rate of return, is a separate process.

==The simple Dietz method==
Note also that the [[simple Dietz method]] is a special case of the Modified Dietz method, in which external flows are assumed to occur at the midpoint of the period, or equivalently, spread evenly throughout the period, whereas no such assumption is made when using the Modified Dietz method, and the timing of any external flows is taken into account.

==Money-weighted return==
The modified Dietz method is an example of a money (or dollar) weighted methodology. In particular, if the modified Dietz return on two portfolios are &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;,  measured over a common matching time interval, then the modified Dietz return on the two portfolios put together over the same time interval is the weighted average of the two returns:

:&lt;math&gt;W_1 \times R_1+W_2 \times R_2&lt;/math&gt;

where the weights of the portfolios depend on the average capital over the time interval:

:&lt;math&gt;W_i = \frac{\text{average capital}_i}{\text{average capital}_1+\text{average capital}_2}&lt;/math&gt;

==Linked return versus true time-weighted return==
An alternative to the modified Dietz method is to link geometrically the modified Dietz returns for shorter periods. The linked modified Dietz method is classed as a time-weighted method, but it does not produce the same results as the [[time-weighted return|true time weighted]] method, which requires valuations at the time of each cash flow.

==Issues==
===Problems with timing assumptions===
There are sometimes difficulties when calculating or decomposing portfolio returns, if all transactions are treated as occurring at a single time of day, such as the end of the day or beginning of the day. Whatever method is applied to calculate returns, an assumption that all transactions take place simultaneously at a single point in time each day can lead to errors.

For example, consider a scenario where a portfolio is empty at the start of a day, so that the start value A is zero. There is then an external inflow during a day of F = $100. By the close of the day, market prices have moved, and the end value is $99.

If all transactions are treated as occurring at the end of the day, then there is zero start value A, and zero value for average capital, because the day-weight on the inflow is zero, so no modified Dietz return can be calculated.

Some such problems are resolved if the modified Dietz method is further adjusted so as to put purchases at the open and sales at the close, but more sophisticated exception-handling produces better results.

There are sometimes other difficulties when decomposing portfolio returns, if all transactions are treated as occurring at a single point during the day.

For example, consider a fund opening with just $100 of a single stock that is sold for $110 during the day. During the same day, another stock is purchased for $110, closing with a value of $120.  The returns on each stock are 10% and 120/110 - 1 = 9.0909% (4 d.p.) and the portfolio return is 20%. The asset weights ''w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' (as opposed to the time weights ''W&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') required to get the returns for these two assets to roll up to the portfolio return are 1200% for the first stock and a negative 1100% for the second:

:w*10/100 + (1-w)*10/110 = 20/100    →   w = 12.

Such weights are absurd, because the second stock is not held short.

The problem only arises because the day is treated as a single, discrete time interval.

===Negative or zero average capital===
In normal circumstances, average capital is positive. When an intra-period outflow is large and early enough, average capital can be negative or zero. Negative average capital causes the Modified Dietz return to be negative when there is a profit, and positive when there is a loss. This resembles the behaviour of a liability or short position, even if the investment is not actually a liability or a short position. In cases where the average capital is zero, no Modified Dietz return can be calculated. If the average capital is close to zero, the Modified Dietz will be large (large and positive, or large and negative).

One partial workaround solution involves as a first step, to capture the exception, detecting for example when the start value (or first inflow) is positive, and the average capital is negative. Then in this case, use the simple return method, adjusting the end value for outflows. This is equivalent to the sum of constituent contributions, where the contributions are based on simple returns and weights depending on start values.

====Example====
For example, in a scenario where only part of the holdings are sold, for significantly more than the total starting value, relatively early in the period:

:At the start of Day 1, the number of shares is 100
:At the start of Day 1, the share price is 10 dollars
:Start value = 1,000 dollars
:At the end of Day 5, 80 shares are sold at 15 dollars per share
:At the end of Day 40, the remaining 20 shares are worth 12.50 dollars per share

The gain or loss is end value - start value + outflow:

:&lt;math&gt;20 \times 12.50 - 100 \times 10 + 80 \times 15&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= 250 - 1,000 + 1,200&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= 50&lt;/math&gt;

There is a gain, and the position is long, so we would intuitively expect a positive return.

The average capital in this case is:

:&lt;math&gt;\text {start value} - \text {time weight} \times \text {outflow on Day 5}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= 100 \times 10 - \frac {40 - 5}{40} \times 80 \times 15&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= 1,000 - \frac {7}{8} \times 1,200&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= 1,000 - 1,050&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= -50 \text { dollars}&lt;/math&gt;

The modified Dietz return in this case goes awry, because the average capital is negative, even though this is a long position. The Modified Dietz return in this case is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\text {gain or loss}}{\text {average capital}} = \frac {50}{-50} = -100 \%&lt;/math&gt;

Instead, we notice that the start value is positive, but the average capital is negative. Furthermore, there is no short sale. In other words, at all times, the number of shares held is positive. 

We then measure the simple return from the shares sold:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {15 - 10}{10} = 50 \%&lt;/math&gt;

and from the shares still held at the end:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {12.50 - 10}{10} = 25 \%&lt;/math&gt;

and combine these returns with the weights of these two portions of the shares within the starting position, which are:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {80}{100} = 80 \%&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac {20}{100} = 20 \%&lt;/math&gt; respectively. 

This gives the contributions to the overall return, which are:

:&lt;math&gt;50 \% \times 80 \% = 40 \%&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;25 \% \times 20 \% = 5 \%&lt;/math&gt; respectively.

The sum of these contributions is the return:

:&lt;math&gt;40 \% + 5 \% = 45 \%&lt;/math&gt;

This is equivalent to the simple return, adjusting the end value for outflows:

:&lt;math&gt;\text {Start value} = 1,000 \text { dollars}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text {Adjusted end value} = \text {end value} + \text {outflow}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= 20 \times 12.50 + 80 \times 15&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= 250 + 1,200&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= 1,450&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\text {Simple return} = \frac {\text {adjusted end value} - \text {start value}}{\text {start value}}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= \frac {1,450 - 1,000}{1,000}&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;= 45 \%&lt;/math&gt;

====Limitations====
This workaround has limitations. It is possible only if the holdings can be split up like this. 

It is not ideal, for two further reasons, which are that it does not cover all cases, and it is inconsistent with the Modified Dietz method. Combined with Modified Dietz contributions for other assets, the sum of constituent contributions will fail to add up to the overall return.

Another situation in which average capital can be negative is short selling. Instead of investing by buying shares, shares are borrowed and then sold. A decline in the share price results in a profit instead of a loss. The position is a liability instead of an asset. If the profit is positive, and the average capital is negative, the Modified Dietz return is negative, indicating that although the number of shares is unchanged, the absolute value of the liability has shrunk.

In the case of a purchase, followed by a sale of more shares than had been bought, resulting in a short position (a negative number of shares), the average capital can also be negative. What was an asset at the time of the purchase became a liability after the sale. The interpretation of the Modified Dietz return varies from one situation to another.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26348">[[Image:Divmod.svg|thumb|right|250px|{{colorbox|red}} Quotient ({{math|''q''}}) and {{colorbox|lightgreen}} remainder ({{math|''r''}}) as functions of dividend ({{math|''a''}}), using different algorithms]]
In [[computing]], the '''modulo''' operation finds the [[remainder]] after [[division (mathematics)|division]] of one number by another (sometimes called ''modulus'').

Given two positive numbers, {{math|''a''}} (the [[Division (mathematics)|dividend]]) and {{math|''n''}} (the [[divisor]]), {{math|''a''}} modulo {{math|''n''}} (abbreviated as {{math|''a'' mod ''n''}}) is the remainder of the [[Euclidean division]] of {{math|''a''}} by {{math|''n''}}. For example, the expression "5 mod 2" would evaluate to 1 because 5 divided by 2 leaves a [[quotient]] of 2 and a remainder of 1, while "9 mod 3" would evaluate to 0 because the division of 9 by 3 has a quotient of 3 and leaves a remainder of 0; there is nothing to subtract from 9 after multiplying 3 times 3. (Note that doing the division with a calculator will not show the result referred to here by this operation; the quotient will be expressed as a decimal fraction.)

Although typically performed with {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''n''}} both being integers, many computing systems allow other types of numeric operands. The range of numbers for an integer modulo of {{math|''n''}} is 0 to {{math|''n'' − 1}}. ({{math|''a''}} mod 1 is always 0; {{math|''a'' mod 0}} is undefined, possibly resulting in a [[division by zero]] error in programming languages.) See [[modular arithmetic]] for an older and related convention applied in [[number theory]].

When either {{math|''a''}} or {{math|''n''}} is negative, the naive definition breaks down and [[programming language]]s differ in how these values are defined.

In [[mathematics]], the result of the modulo operation is the remainder of the [[Euclidean division]]. However, other conventions are possible. Computers and calculators have various ways of storing and representing numbers; thus their definition of the modulo operation depends on the [[programming language]] or the underlying [[computer hardware|hardware]].

In nearly all computing systems, the [[quotient]] {{math|''q''}} and the remainder {{math|''r''}} of {{math|''a''}} divided by {{math|''n''}} satisfy
: {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
q \,&amp;\in \mathbb{Z} \\
a \,&amp;= n q + r \\
|r| \,&amp;&lt; |n|
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

However, this still leaves a sign ambiguity if the remainder is nonzero: two possible choices for the remainder occur, one negative and the other positive, and two possible choices for the quotient occur. Usually, in number theory, the positive remainder is always chosen, but programming languages choose depending on the language and the signs of {{math|''a''}} or {{math|''n''}}.{{ref|2}} Standard [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] and [[ALGOL 68]] give a positive remainder (or 0) even for negative divisors, and some programming languages, such as C90, leave it to the implementation when either of {{math|''n''}} or {{math|''a''}} is negative. See the table for details. {{math|''a''}} modulo 0 is undefined in most systems, although some do define it as {{math|''a''}}.

{{bulleted list
| Many implementations use ''truncated division'', where the quotient is defined by [[truncation]] {{math|''q'' {{=}} trunc({{sfrac|''a''|''n''}})}} and thus according to equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) the remainder would have ''same sign as the dividend''.  The quotient is rounded towards zero: equal to the first integer in the direction of zero from the exact rational quotient.
:&lt;math&gt;r = a - n \operatorname{trunc}\left(\frac{a}{n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; described ''floored division'' where the quotient is defined by the [[floor function]] {{math|''q'' {{=}} ⌊{{sfrac|''a''|''n''}}⌋}} and thus according to equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) the remainder would have the ''same sign as the divisor''.  Due to the floor function, the quotient is always rounded downwards, even if it is already negative.
:&lt;math&gt;r = a - n \left\lfloor\frac{a}{n}\right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;n &gt; 0 \Rightarrow q = \left\lfloor\frac{a}{n}\right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|sgn}} is the [[sign function]], and thus
: &lt;math&gt;r = a - |n| \left\lfloor \frac{a}{\left|n\right|} \right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;

| Common Lisp also defines round-division and ceiling-division where the quotient is given by {{math|''q'' {{=}} round({{sfrac|''a''|''n''}})}} and {{math|q {{=}} ⌈{{sfrac|''a''|''n''}}⌉}} respectively.

| [[IEEE 754-1985|IEEE 754]] defines a remainder function where the quotient is {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''n''}}}} rounded according to the [[IEEE 754-1985#Rounding floating-point numbers|round to nearest convention]].  Thus, the sign of the remainder is chosen to be ''nearest to zero''.

}}

As described by Leijen,
{{Quote|text=Boute argues that Euclidean division is superior to the other ones in terms of regularity and useful mathematical properties, although floored division, promoted by Knuth, is also a good definition.  Despite its widespread use, truncated division is shown to be inferior to the other definitions.|sign=Daan Leijen|source=''Division and Modulus for Computer Scientists''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

However, Boute concentrates on the properties of the modulo operation itself and does not rate the fact that the truncated division shows the symmetry {{math|(-''a'') div ''n'' {{=}} -(''a'' div ''n'')}} and {{math|''a'' div (-''n'') {{=}} -(''a'' div ''n'')}}, which is similar to the ordinary division. As neither floor division nor Euclidean division offer this symmetry, Boute's judgement is at least incomplete.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}{{OR|date=January 2018}}

==Common pitfalls==
When the result of a modulo operation has the sign of the dividend, it can lead to surprising mistakes.

For example, to test if an integer is odd, one might be inclined to test if the remainder by 2 is equal to 1:

&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
bool is_odd(int n) {
    return n % 2 == 1;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

But in a language where modulo has the sign of the dividend, that is incorrect, because when {{math|''n''}} (the dividend) is negative and odd, {{math|''n''}} mod 2 returns −1, and the function returns false.

One correct alternative is to test that it is not 0 (because remainder 0 is the same regardless of the signs):

&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
bool is_odd(int n) {
    return n % 2 != 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Or, by understanding in the first place that for any odd number, the modulo remainder may be either 1 or −1:

&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
bool is_odd(int n) {
    return n % 2 == 1 || n % 2 == -1;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Notation==
{{About|the binary ''mod'' operation|the ''(mod m)'' notation|congruence relation|section=yes}}

Some calculators have a {{math|mod()}} function button, and many programming languages have a similar function, expressed as {{math|mod(''a'', ''n'')}}, for example. Some also support expressions that use "%", "mod", or "Mod" as a modulo or remainder [[Operator (programming)|operator]], such as
:&lt;code&gt;a % n&lt;/code&gt;
or
:&lt;code&gt;a mod n&lt;/code&gt;
or equivalent, for environments lacking a {{math|mod()}} function (note that 'int' inherently produces the truncated value of {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''n''}}}})
:&lt;code&gt;a - (n * int(a/n))&lt;/code&gt;

==Performance issues==
Modulo operations might be implemented such that a division with a remainder is calculated each time. For special cases, on some hardware, faster alternatives exist. For example, the modulo of powers of 2 can alternatively be expressed as a [[Bitwise operation|bitwise]] AND operation:
:&lt;code&gt;x % 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; == x &amp; (2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; - 1)&lt;/code&gt;

Examples (assuming {{math|''x''}} is a positive integer):
:&lt;code&gt;x % 2 == x &amp; 1&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;x % 4 == x &amp; 3&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;x % 8 == x &amp; 7&lt;/code&gt;

In devices and software that implement bitwise operations more efficiently than modulo, these alternative forms can result in faster calculations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Adam |last= Horvath |url= http://blog.teamleadnet.com/2012/07/faster-division-and-modulo-operation.html |title= Faster division and modulo operation - the power of two |date= July 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Compiler optimization|Optimizing]] [[compiler]]s may recognize expressions of the form &lt;code&gt;expression % constant&lt;/code&gt; where &lt;code&gt;constant&lt;/code&gt; is a power of two and automatically implement them as &lt;code&gt;expression &amp; (constant-1)&lt;/code&gt;. This can allow writing clearer code without compromising performance. This optimization is not possible for languages in which the result of the modulo operation has the sign of the dividend (including C), unless the dividend is of an [[Signedness|unsigned]] integer type. This is because, if the dividend is negative, the modulo will be negative, whereas &lt;code&gt;expression &amp;amp; (constant-1)&lt;/code&gt; will always be positive.

==Equivalences==
Some modulo operations can be factored or expanded similarly to other mathematical operations.  This may be useful in [[cryptography]] proofs, such as the [[Diffie–Hellman key exchange]].
*Identity:
**{{math|(''a'' mod ''n'') mod ''n'' {{=}} ''a'' mod ''n''}}.
**{{math|''n''{{sup|''x''}} mod ''n'' {{=}} 0}} for all positive integer values of {{math|''x''}}.
** If {{math|''p''}} is a [[prime number]] which is not a [[divisor]] of {{math|''b''}}, then {{math|''ab''{{sup|''p''−1}} mod ''p'' {{=}} ''a'' mod ''p''}}, due to [[Fermat's little theorem]].
*Inverse:
**{{math|[(−''a'' mod ''n'') + (''a'' mod ''n'')] mod ''n'' {{=}} 0}}.
**{{math|''b''{{sup|−1}} mod ''n''}} denotes the [[modular multiplicative inverse]], which is defined if and only if {{math|''b''}} and {{math|''n''}} are [[relatively prime]], which is the case when the left hand side is defined: {{math|[(''b''{{sup|−1}} mod ''n'')(''b'' mod ''n'')] mod ''n'' {{=}} 1}}.
*Distributive:
**{{math|(''a'' + ''b'') mod ''n'' {{=}} [(''a'' mod ''n'') + (''b'' mod ''n'')] mod ''n''}}.
**{{math|''ab'' mod ''n'' {{=}} [(''a'' mod ''n'')(''b'' mod ''n'')] mod ''n''}}.
**{{math|''d'' mod (''abc'') {{=}} (''d'' mod ''a'') + ''a''[(''d'' \ ''a'') mod ''b''] + ''ab''[(''d'' \ ''a'' \ ''b'') mod ''c'']}}, where {{math|\}} is the operator for the quotient from [[Euclidean division]].
**{{math|''c'' mod (''a+b'') {{=}} (''c'' mod ''a'') + [''bc'' \ (''a''+''b'')] mod ''b'' - [''bc'' \ (''a'' + ''b'')] mod ''a''}}.
*Division (definition):  {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}} mod ''n'' {{=}} [(''a'' mod ''n'')(''b''{{sup|−1}} mod ''n'')] mod ''n''}}, when the right hand side is defined (that is when {{math|''b''}} and {{math|''n''}} are  [[coprime]]). Undefined otherwise. 
*Inverse multiplication:  {{math|[(''ab'' mod ''n'')(''b''{{sup|−1}} mod ''n'')] mod ''n'' {{=}} ''a'' mod ''n''}}.

In [[geometry]] and [[complex analysis]], a '''Möbius transformation''' of the [[complex plane]] is a [[rational function]] of the form

:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = \frac{a z + b}{c z + d}&lt;/math&gt;

of one [[complex number|complex]] variable ''z''; here the coefficients ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' are complex numbers satisfying ''ad'' − ''bc'' ≠ 0.

Geometrically, a Möbius transformation can be obtained by first performing [[stereographic projection]] from the plane to the [[sphere|unit two-sphere]], rotating and moving the sphere to a new location and orientation in space, and then performing stereographic projection (from the new position of the sphere) to the plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Arnold|Rogness|2008|loc=Möbius transformations revealed, Theorem 1 [http://www.ima.umn.edu/~arnold/papers/moebius.pdf]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These transformations preserve angles, map every straight line to a line or circle, and map every circle to a line or circle.

The Möbius transformations are the [[projective transformation]]s of the [[complex projective line]]. They form a [[group (mathematics)|group]] called the '''Möbius group''', which is the [[projective linear group]] PGL(2,'''C'''). Together with its [[subgroup]]s, it has numerous applications in mathematics and physics.

Möbius transformations are named in honor of [[August Ferdinand Möbius]]; they are also variously named '''[[homography|homographies]]''', '''homographic transformations''', '''linear fractional transformations''', '''bilinear transformations''', or '''fractional linear transformations'''.

== Overview ==
Möbius transformations are defined on the [[Riemann sphere|extended complex plane]] &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathbf{C}} = \mathbf{C}\cup\{\infty\}&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., the [[complex plane]] augmented by the [[point at infinity]]).

[[Stereographic projection]] identifies &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathbf{C}}&lt;/math&gt; with a sphere, which is then called the [[Riemann sphere]]; alternatively, &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathbf{C}}&lt;/math&gt; can be thought of as the complex [[projective line]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}\mathbf{P}^1&lt;/math&gt;.  The Möbius transformations are exactly the [[bijective]] [[conformal map|conformal]] maps from the Riemann sphere to itself, i.e., the [[automorphism group|automorphisms]] of the Riemann sphere as a [[complex manifold]]; alternatively, they are the automorphisms of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}\mathbf{P}^1&lt;/math&gt; as an algebraic variety.  Therefore, the set of all Möbius transformations forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under [[function composition|composition]].  This group is called the Möbius group, and is sometimes denoted &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Aut}(\widehat{\mathbf{C}})\,&lt;/math&gt;.

The Möbius group is [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the group of orientation-preserving [[isometry|isometries]] of [[hyperbolic space|hyperbolic 3-space]] and therefore plays an important role when studying [[hyperbolic 3-manifold]]s.

In [[physics]], the [[identity component]] of the [[Lorentz group]] acts on the [[celestial sphere]] in the same way that the Möbius group acts on the Riemann sphere. In fact, these two groups are isomorphic. An observer who accelerates to relativistic velocities will see the pattern of constellations as seen near the Earth continuously transform according to infinitesimal Möbius transformations. This observation is often taken as the starting point of [[twistor theory]].

Certain [[subgroup]]s of the Möbius group form the automorphism groups of the other [[simply-connected]] Riemann surfaces (the [[complex plane]] and the [[Hyperbolic space|hyperbolic plane]]). As such, Möbius transformations play an important role in the theory of [[Riemann surface]]s. The [[fundamental group]] of every Riemann surface is a [[discrete subgroup]] of the Möbius group (see [[Fuchsian group]] and [[Kleinian group]]).
A particularly important discrete subgroup of the Möbius group is the [[modular group]]; it is central to the theory of many [[fractal]]s, [[modular form]]s, [[elliptic curve]]s and [[Pellian equation]]s.

Möbius transformations can be more generally defined in spaces of dimension ''n''&gt;2 as the bijective conformal orientation-preserving maps from the [[n-sphere|''n''-sphere]] to the ''n''-sphere. Such a transformation is the most general form of conformal mapping of a domain. According to [[Liouville's theorem (conformal mappings)|Liouville's theorem]] a Möbius transformation can be expressed as a composition of translations, [[Similarity (geometry)|similarities]], orthogonal transformations and inversions.

== Definition ==
The general form of a Möbius transformation is given by
:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = \frac{a z + b}{c z + d}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' are any [[complex number]]s satisfying {{math|''ad'' − ''bc'' ≠ 0}}. If {{math|1=''ad'' = ''bc''}}, the rational function defined above is a constant since
:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = \frac{a z + b}{c z + d} = \frac{a(cz+d)}{c(cz+d)} - \frac{a d -bc}{c(c z + d)} = \frac{a}{c}&lt;/math&gt;
and is thus not considered a Möbius transformation.

In case {{math|''c'' ≠ 0}}, this definition is extended to the whole [[Riemann sphere]] by defining
:&lt;math&gt;f\left(\frac{-d}{c}\right) = \infin \text{ and } f(\infin) = \frac{a}{c}.&lt;/math&gt;

If {{math|1=''c'' = 0}}, we define
:&lt;math&gt;f(\infin) = \infin.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus a Möbius transformation is always a bijective [[holomorphic function]] from the Riemann sphere to the Riemann sphere.

The set of all Möbius transformations forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under [[function composition|composition]]. This group can be given the structure of a [[complex manifold]] in such a way that composition and inversion are [[holomorphic map]]s. The Möbius group is then a [[complex Lie group]]. The Möbius group is usually denoted &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Aut}(\widehat{\mathbf{C}})&lt;/math&gt; as it is the [[automorphism group]] of the Riemann sphere.

== Fixed points ==
Every non-identity Möbius transformation has two [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]] &lt;math&gt;\gamma_1, \gamma_2&lt;/math&gt; on the Riemann sphere. Note that the fixed points are counted here with [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]]; the parabolic transformations are those where the fixed points coincide. Either or both of these fixed points may be the point at infinity.

=== Determining the fixed points ===
The fixed points of the transformation
:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = \frac{az + b}{cz + d}&lt;/math&gt;
are obtained by solving the fixed point equation f(γ) = γ. For ''c'' ≠ 0, this has two roots obtained by expanding this equation to
:&lt;math&gt;c \gamma^2 - (a - d) \gamma - b = 0 \ ,&lt;/math&gt;
and applying the [[quadratic formula]]. The roots are
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{1,2} = \frac{(a - d) \pm \sqrt{(a-d)^2 + 4bc}}{2c} = \frac{(a - d) \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2c}&lt;/math&gt;
with discriminant
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta =(\operatorname{tr}\mathfrak{H})^2 - 4\operatorname{det}\mathfrak{H}=(a+d)^2 - 4(ad-bc)&lt;/math&gt;.
Parabolic transforms have coincidental fixed points due to zero discriminant. For ''c'' nonzero and nonzero discriminant the transform is elliptic or hyperbolic.

When ''c'' = 0, the quadratic equation degenerates into a linear equation and the transform is linear. This corresponds to the situation that one of the fixed points is the point at infinity. When ''a'' ≠ ''d'' the second fixed point is finite and is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma=-\frac{b}{a-d}.&lt;/math&gt;

In this case the transformation will be a simple transformation composed of [[translation (mathematics)|translation]]s, [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]s, and [[dilation (metric space)|dilation]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;z \mapsto \alpha z + \beta.\,&lt;/math&gt;

If ''c'' = 0 and ''a'' = ''d'', then both fixed points are at infinity, and the Möbius transformation corresponds to a pure translation:
:&lt;math&gt;z \mapsto z + \beta.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Topological proof ===
Topologically, the fact that (non-identity) Möbius transformations fix 2 points (with multiplicity) corresponds to the [[Euler characteristic]] of the sphere being 2:
:&lt;math&gt;\chi(\hat{\mathbf{C}})=2.&lt;/math&gt;

Firstly, the [[projective linear group]] PGL(2,''K'') is [[n-transitive|sharply 3-transitive]]&amp;nbsp;– for any two ordered triples of distinct points, there is a unique map that takes one triple to the other, just as for Möbius transforms, and by the same algebraic proof (essentially [[dimension counting]], as the group is 3-dimensional). Thus any map that fixes at least 3 points is the identity.

Next, one can see by identifying the  Möbius group with &lt;math&gt;PGL(2,\mathbb C)&lt;/math&gt; that any Möbius function is homotopic to the identity. Indeed, any member of the [[general linear group]] can be reduced to the identity map by Gauss-Jordan elimination, this shows that the projective linear group is path-connected as well, providing a homotopy to the identity map.The [[Lefschetz–Hopf theorem]] states that the sum of the indices (in this context, multiplicity) of the fixed points of a map with finitely many fixed points equals the [[Lefschetz number]] of the map, which in this case is the trace of the identity map on homology groups, which is simply the Euler characteristic.

By contrast, the projective linear group of the real projective line, PGL(2,'''R''') need not fix any points&amp;nbsp;– for example &lt;math&gt;(1+x)/(1-x)&lt;/math&gt; has no (real) fixed points: as a complex transformation it fixes ±''i''&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Geometrically this map is the [[stereographic projection]] of a rotation by 90° around ±''i'' with period 4, which takes &lt;math&gt;0 \mapsto 1 \mapsto \infty \mapsto -1 \mapsto 0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– while the map 2''x'' fixes the two points of 0 and ∞. This corresponds to the fact that the Euler characteristic of the circle (real projective line) is 0, and thus the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem says only that it must fix at least 0 points, but possibly more.

=== Normal form ===
Möbius transformations are also sometimes written in terms of their fixed points in so-called '''normal form'''. We first treat the non-parabolic case, for which there are two distinct fixed points.

''Non-parabolic case'':

Every non-parabolic transformation is [[conjugacy class|conjugate]] to a dilation/rotation, i.e. a transformation of the form

:&lt;math&gt;z \mapsto k z \, &lt;/math&gt;

(''k''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''C''') with fixed points at 0 and ∞. To see this define a map

:&lt;math&gt;g(z) = \frac{z - \gamma_1}{z - \gamma_2}&lt;/math&gt;

which sends the points (γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to (0, ∞). Here we assume that γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are distinct and finite. If one of them is already at infinity then ''g'' can be modified so as to fix infinity and send the other point to 0.

If ''f'' has distinct fixed points (γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) then the transformation &lt;math&gt;gfg^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; has fixed points at 0 and ∞ and is therefore a dilation: &lt;math&gt;gfg^{-1}(z) = kz&lt;/math&gt;. The fixed point equation for the transformation ''f'' can then be written
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{f(z)-\gamma_1}{f(z)-\gamma_2} = k \frac{z-\gamma_1}{z-\gamma_2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for ''f'' gives (in matrix form):

:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}(k; \gamma_1, \gamma_2) =
\begin{pmatrix}
\gamma_1 - k\gamma_2 &amp; (k - 1) \gamma_1\gamma_2 \\
1 - k                &amp;  k\gamma_1 - \gamma_2
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

or, if one of the fixed points is at infinity:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}(k; \gamma, \infty) =
\begin{pmatrix}
k &amp; (1 - k) \gamma \\
0 &amp;  1
\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

From the above expressions one can calculate the derivatives of ''f'' at the fixed points:

:&lt;math&gt;f'(\gamma_1)= k\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f'(\gamma_2)= 1/k.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Observe that, given an ordering of the fixed points, we can distinguish one of the multipliers (''k'') of ''f'' as the '''characteristic constant''' of ''f''. Reversing the order of the fixed points is equivalent to taking the inverse multiplier for the characteristic constant:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}(k; \gamma_1, \gamma_2) = \mathfrak{H}(1/k; \gamma_2, \gamma_1).&lt;/math&gt;

For loxodromic transformations, whenever |''k''| &gt; 1, one says that γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the '''repulsive''' fixed point, and γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the '''attractive''' fixed point. For |''k''| &lt; 1, the roles are reversed.

''Parabolic case'':

In the parabolic case there is only one fixed point γ. The transformation sending that point to ∞ is

:&lt;math&gt;g(z) = \frac{1}{z - \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

or the identity if γ is already at infinity. The transformation &lt;math&gt;gfg^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; fixes infinity and is therefore a translation:

:&lt;math&gt;gfg^{-1}(z) = z + \beta\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, β is called the '''translation length'''. The fixed point formula for a parabolic transformation is then

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{f(z)-\gamma} = \frac{1}{z-\gamma} + \beta.&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for ''f'' (in matrix form) gives

:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}(\beta; \gamma) =
\begin{pmatrix}
1+\gamma\beta    &amp; - \beta \gamma^2  \\
\beta            &amp;   1-\gamma \beta
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

or, if γ = ∞:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}(\beta; \infty) =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; \beta  \\
0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that β is ''not'' the characteristic constant of ''f'', which is always 1 for a parabolic transformation. From the above expressions one can calculate:
:&lt;math&gt;f'(\gamma) = 1.\,&lt;/math&gt;

== Poles of the transformation ==

The point &lt;math&gt;z_\infty = - \frac{d}{c}&lt;/math&gt; is called the pole of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt;; it is that point which is transformed to the point at infinity under &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt;.

The inverse pole &lt;math&gt;Z_\infty = \frac{a}{c}&lt;/math&gt; is that point to which the point at infinity is transformed.
The point midway between the two poles is always the same as the point midway between the two fixed points:

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_1 + \gamma_2 = z_\infty + Z_\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

These four points are the vertices of a parallelogram which is sometimes called the '''characteristic parallelogram''' of the transformation.

A transform &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt; can be specified with two fixed points γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the pole &lt;math&gt;z_\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H} =
\begin{pmatrix}
Z_\infty &amp; - \gamma_1 \gamma_2 \\
1        &amp; - z_\infty
\end{pmatrix}, \;\;
Z_\infty = \gamma_1 + \gamma_2 - z_\infty.
&lt;/math&gt;

This allows us to derive a formula for conversion between ''k'' and &lt;math&gt;z_\infty&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;\gamma_1, \gamma_2&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;z_\infty = \frac{k \gamma_1 - \gamma_2}{1 - k}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;k= \frac{\gamma_2 - z_\infty}{\gamma_1 - z_\infty}
= \frac{Z_\infty - \gamma_1}{Z_\infty - \gamma_2}
= \frac {a - c \gamma_1}{a - c \gamma_2},&lt;/math&gt;

which reduces down to
:&lt;math&gt;k = \frac{(a + d) + \sqrt {(a - d)^2 + 4 b c}}{(a + d) - \sqrt {(a - d)^2 + 4 b c}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The last expression coincides with one of the (mutually reciprocal) [[eigenvalue]] ratios &lt;math&gt; \lambda_1\over \lambda_2&lt;/math&gt; of the matrix
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H} =
\begin{pmatrix}
a &amp; b \\
c &amp; d
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
representing the transform (compare the discussion in the preceding section about the characteristic constant of a transformation). Its characteristic polynomial is equal to
:&lt;math&gt;
\det (\lambda I_2- \mathfrak{H})
=\lambda^2-\operatorname{tr} \mathfrak{H}\,\lambda+
\det \mathfrak{H}
=\lambda^2-(a+d)\lambda+(ad-bc)
&lt;/math&gt;
which has roots
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda_{i}=\frac{(a + d) \pm \sqrt {(a - d)^2 + 4 b c}}{2}=\frac{(a + d) \pm \sqrt {(a + d)^2 - 4(ad-b c)}}{2}=c\gamma_i+d \ .
&lt;/math&gt;

==Simple  Möbius transformations and composition ==

A Möbius transformation can be [[Function composition|composed]] as a sequence of simple transformations.

The following simple transformations are also Möbius transformations:

&lt;math&gt;  f(z) = z+b\quad (a=1,c = 0 ,d=1 ) &lt;/math&gt;
is a [[translation (geometry)|translation]]

&lt;math&gt;  f(z) = az \quad (b=0,c = 0 ,d=1 ) &lt;/math&gt;
is a combination of a ([[Homothetic transformation|homothety]] and a [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]])
If &lt;math&gt;  |a| =1 &lt;/math&gt; then it is a rotation, if &lt;math&gt;  a \in \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; then it is a homothety

&lt;math&gt;f(z)= 1/z \quad (a=0, b=1, c = 1 ,d=0 ) &lt;/math&gt; ([[inversive geometry|inversion]] and [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] with respect to the real axis)

=== Composition of simple transformations===

Let:

* &lt;math&gt;f_1(z)= z+d/c \quad&lt;/math&gt; ([[translation (geometry)|translation]] by ''d''/''c'')
* &lt;math&gt;f_2(z)= 1/z \quad&lt;/math&gt; ([[inversive geometry|inversion]] and [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] with respect to the real axis)
* &lt;math&gt;f_3(z)= \frac{bc-ad}{c^2} z \quad&lt;/math&gt; ([[Homothetic transformation|homothety]] and [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]])
* &lt;math&gt;f_4(z)= z+a/c \quad&lt;/math&gt; (translation by ''a''/''c'')

Then these functions can be [[Function composition|composed]], giving

:&lt;math&gt; f_4\circ f_3\circ f_2\circ f_1 (z)= f(z) = \frac{az+b}{cz+d} &lt;/math&gt;

This decomposition makes many properties of the Möbius transformation obvious.

== Elementary properties ==
A Möbius transformation is equivalent to a sequence of simpler transformations.
The composition  makes many properties of the Möbius transformation obvious.

=== Formula for the inverse transformation ===
The existence of the inverse Möbius transformation and its explicit formula are easily derived by the composition of the inverse functions of the simpler transformations. That is, define functions ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; such that each ''g&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the inverse of ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. Then the composition
: &lt;math&gt;g_1\circ g_2\circ g_3\circ g_4 (z) = f^{-1}(z) = \frac{dz-b}{-cz+a}&lt;/math&gt; gives a formula for the inverse.

=== Preservation of angles and generalized circles ===
From this decomposition, we see that Möbius transformations carry over all non-trivial properties of [[circle inversion]]. For example, the preservation of angles is reduced to proving that circle inversion preserves angles since the other types of transformations are dilation and [[isometries]] (translation, reflection, rotation), which trivially preserve angles.

Furthermore, Möbius transformations map [[generalized circle]]s to generalized circles since circle inversion has this property. A generalized circle is either a circle or a line, the latter being considered as a circle through the point at infinity. Note that a Möbius transformation does not necessarily map circles to circles and lines to lines: it can mix the two. Even if it maps a circle to another circle, it does not necessarily map the first circle's center to the second circle's center.

=== Cross-ratio preservation ===
[[Cross-ratio]]s are invariant under Möbius transformations. That is, if a Möbius transformation maps four distinct points &lt;math&gt;z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4&lt;/math&gt; to four distinct points &lt;math&gt;w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4&lt;/math&gt; respectively, then
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(z_1-z_3)(z_2-z_4)}{(z_2-z_3)(z_1-z_4)} =\frac{(w_1-w_3)(w_2-w_4)}{(w_2-w_3)(w_1-w_4)}. &lt;/math&gt;

If one of the points &lt;math&gt;z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4&lt;/math&gt; is the point at infinity, then the cross-ratio has to be defined by taking the appropriate limit; e.g. the cross-ratio of &lt;math&gt;z_1, z_2, z_3, \infin&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(z_1-z_3)}{(z_2-z_3)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The cross ratio of four different points is real if and only if there is a line or a circle passing through them. This is another way to show that Möbius transformations preserve generalized circles.

=== Conjugation ===
Two points ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are '''conjugate''' with respect to a generalized circle ''C'', if, given a generalized circle ''D'' passing through ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and cutting ''C'' in two points ''a'' and ''b'', {{nowrap|(''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; ''a'', ''b'')}} are in [[harmonic cross-ratio]] (i.e. their cross ratio is −1). This property does not depend on the choice of the circle ''D''. This property is also sometimes referred to as being '''symmetric''' with respect to a line or circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Olsen|first=John|title=The Geometry of Mobius Transformations |url=http://www.johno.dk/mathematics/moebius.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{mathworld|id=SymmetricPoints|title=Symmetric Points}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two points ''z'', ''z''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; are conjugate with respect to a line, if they are [[reflection symmetry|symmetric]] with respect to the line. Two points are conjugate with respect to a circle if they are exchanged by the [[inversive geometry|inversion]] with respect to this circle.

The point ''z''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; conjugate to ''z'' when ''L'' is the line determined by the vector based ''e&lt;sup&gt;iθ&lt;/sup&gt;'' at the point ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; can be explicitly given as
:&lt;math&gt;z^* = e^{2i\theta} \overline{z - z_0} + z_0.&lt;/math&gt;

The point ''z''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; conjugate to ''z'' when ''C'' is the circle of radius ''r'' centered ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; can be explicitly given as
:&lt;math&gt;z^* = \frac{r^2}{\overline{z - z_0}} + z_0&lt;/math&gt;

Since Möbius transformations preserve generalized circles and cross-ratios, they preserve also the conjugation.

== Projective matrix representations ==
With every [[invertible matrix|invertible]] complex 2-by-2 matrix
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak H = \begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
we can associate the Möbius transformation
:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = \frac{a z + b}{c z + d}.&lt;/math&gt;
The condition ''ad'' − ''bc'' ≠ 0 is equivalent to the condition that the [[determinant]] of above matrix be nonzero, i.e. that the matrix be invertible.

It is straightforward to check that then the [[matrix multiplication|product]] of two matrices will be associated with the composition of the two corresponding Möbius transformations. In other words, the map
:&lt;math&gt;\pi\colon \operatorname{GL}(2,\mathbf C) \to \operatorname{Aut}(\widehat{\mathbf C})&lt;/math&gt;
from the [[general linear group]] GL(2,'''C''') to the Möbius group, which sends the matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt; to the transformation ''f'', is a [[group homomorphism]].

Note that any matrix obtained by multiplying &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak H&lt;/math&gt; by a complex scalar λ determines the same transformation, so a Möbius transformation determines its matrix only [[up to]] scalar multiples. In other words: the [[kernel (group theory)|kernel]] of {{pi}} consists of all scalar multiples of the [[identity matrix]] I, and the [[first isomorphism theorem]] of group theory states that the [[quotient group]] GL(2,'''C''')/(('''C&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;{0}''')Id) is isomorphic to the Möbius group. This quotient group is known as the [[projective linear group]] and is usually denoted PGL(2,'''C''').
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Aut}(\widehat{\mathbf{C}}) \cong \operatorname{PGL}(2,\mathbf C).&lt;/math&gt;
The same identification of PGL(2,''K'') with the group of fractional linear transformations and with the group of projective linear automorphisms of the projective line holds over any field ''K'', a fact of algebraic interest, particularly for finite fields, though the case of the complex numbers has the greatest geometric interest.

The natural [[group action|action]] of PGL(2,'''C''') on the [[complex projective line]] '''CP'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is exactly the natural action of the Möbius group on the Riemann sphere, where the projective line '''CP'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and the Riemann sphere are identified as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;[z_1 : z_2]\leftrightarrow z_1/z_2.&lt;/math&gt;
Here [''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] are [[homogeneous coordinates]] on '''CP'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;; the point [1:0] corresponds to the point ∞ of the Riemann sphere.
By using homogeneous coordinates, many concrete calculations involving Möbius transformations can be simplified, since no case distinctions dealing with ∞ are required.

If one restricts &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt; to matrices of determinant one, the map {{pi}} restricts to a surjective map from the [[special linear group]] SL(2,'''C''') to the Möbius group; in the restricted setting the kernel is formed by plus and minus the identity, and the quotient group SL(2,'''C''')/{±''I''}, denoted by PSL(2,'''C'''), is therefore also isomorphic to the Möbius group:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Aut}(\widehat{\mathbf C}) \cong \operatorname{PSL}(2,\mathbf C).&lt;/math&gt;
From this we see that the Möbius group is a 3-dimensional complex Lie group (or a 6-dimensional real Lie group). It is a [[Semisimple Lie group|semisimple]] non-[[Compact group|compact]] Lie group.

Note that there are precisely two matrices with unit determinant which can be used to represent any given Möbius transformation. That is, SL(2,'''C''') is a [[Double covering group|double cover]] of PSL(2,'''C'''). Since SL(2,'''C''') is [[simply-connected]] it is the [[universal cover]] of the Möbius group. Therefore, the [[fundamental group]] of the Möbius group is '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Specifying a transformation by three points ===

Given a set of three distinct points ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; on the Riemann sphere and a second set of distinct points ''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''w''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, there exists precisely one Möbius transformation ''f''(''z'')  with ''f''(''z''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''i'' = 1,2,3. (In other words: the [[group action|action]] of the Möbius group on the Riemann sphere is ''sharply 3-transitive''.) There are several ways to determine ''f''(''z'') from the given sets of points.

==== Mapping first to 0, 1, ∞ ====
It is easy to check that the Möbius transformation

:&lt;math&gt;f_1(z)= \frac {(z-z_1)(z_2-z_3)}{(z-z_3)(z_2-z_1)}&lt;/math&gt;

with matrix
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}_1 = \begin{pmatrix}
z_2 - z_3 &amp; -z_1 (z_2 - z_3)\\
z_2-z_1 &amp; -z_3 (z_2-z_1)
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
maps ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to 0, 1, ∞, respectively. If one of the ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is ∞, then the proper formula for &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}_1&lt;/math&gt; is obtained from the above one by first dividing all entries by ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and then taking the limit ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; → ∞.

If &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}_2&lt;/math&gt; is similarly defined to map ''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''w''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to 0, 1, ∞, then the matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt; which maps ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1,2,3&lt;/sub&gt; to ''w''&lt;sub&gt;1,2,3&lt;/sub&gt; becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H} = \mathfrak{H}_2^{-1} \mathfrak{H}_1.&lt;/math&gt;

The stabilizer of {0, 1, ∞} (as an unordered set) is a subgroup known as the [[anharmonic group]].

==== Explicit determinant formula ====
The equation
:&lt;math&gt;w=\frac{az+b}{cz+d}&lt;/math&gt;
is equivalent to the equation of a standard [[hyperbola]]
:&lt;math&gt;\, c wz -az+dw -b=0 &lt;/math&gt;
in the (''z'',''w'')-plane. The problem of constructing a Möbius transformation &lt;math&gt; \mathfrak{H}(z) &lt;/math&gt; mapping a triple &lt;math&gt; (z_1, z_2, z_3 )&lt;/math&gt; to another triple &lt;math&gt;(w_1, w_2, w_3 )&lt;/math&gt; is thus equivalent to finding the coefficients ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' of the hyperbola passing through the points &lt;math&gt; (z_i, w_i ) &lt;/math&gt;. An explicit equation can be found by evaluating the [[determinant]]
:&lt;math&gt;\det \begin{pmatrix} zw &amp; z &amp; w &amp; 1 \\ z_1w_1 &amp; z_1 &amp; w_1 &amp; 1 \\   z_2w_2 &amp; z_2 &amp; w_2 &amp; 1 \\   z_3w_3 &amp; z_3 &amp; w_3 &amp; 1\end{pmatrix}\, &lt;/math&gt;
by means of a [[Laplace expansion]] along the first row. This results in the determinant formulae
:&lt;math&gt;a=\det \begin{pmatrix} z_1w_1 &amp; w_1 &amp; 1 \\   z_2w_2 &amp; w_2 &amp; 1 \\   z_3w_3 &amp; w_3 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}\, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b=\det \begin{pmatrix} z_1w_1 &amp; z_1 &amp; w_1 \\   z_2w_2 &amp; z_2 &amp; w_2 \\   z_3w_3 &amp; z_3 &amp; w_3 \end{pmatrix}\, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c=\det \begin{pmatrix} z_1 &amp; w_1 &amp; 1 \\   z_2 &amp; w_2 &amp; 1 \\   z_3 &amp; w_3 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}\, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;d=\det \begin{pmatrix} z_1w_1 &amp; z_1 &amp; 1 \\  z_2w_2 &amp; z_2 &amp; 1 \\   z_3w_3 &amp; z_3 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
for the coefficients ''a,b,c,d'' of the representing matrix &lt;math&gt;\, \mathfrak{H} =\begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b \\  c &amp; d \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;. The constructed matrix &lt;math&gt; \mathfrak{H} &lt;/math&gt; has determinant equal to &lt;math&gt; (z_1-z_2) (z_1-z_3)(z_2-z_3)(w_1-w_2) (w_1-w_3)(w_2-w_3) &lt;/math&gt; which does not vanish if the ''z&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' resp. ''w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are pairwise different thus the Möbius transformation is well-defined. If one of the points ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; or ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is ∞, then we first divide all four determinants by this variable and then take the limit as the variable approaches ∞.

== Subgroups of the Möbius group ==
If we require the coefficients ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' of a Möbius transformation to be real numbers with {{nowrap|''ad'' − ''bc'' {{=}} 1}}, we obtain a subgroup of the
Möbius group denoted as [[PSL2(R)|PSL(2,'''R''')]]. This is the group of those Möbius transformations that map the [[upper half-plane]] {{nowrap|''H'' {{=}} ''x'' + i''y'' : ''y'' &gt; 0}} to itself, and is equal to the group of all [[biholomorphic]] (or equivalently: [[bijective]], [[conformal map|conformal]] and orientation-preserving) maps {{nowrap|''H'' → ''H''}}. If a proper [[Riemannian metric|metric]] is introduced, the upper half-plane becomes a model of the [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]] ''H''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the [[Poincaré half-plane model]], and PSL(2,'''R''') is the group of all orientation-preserving isometries of ''H''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt; in this model.

The subgroup of all Möbius transformations that map the open disk {{nowrap|''D'' {{=}} ''z'' : {{abs|''z''}} &lt; 1}} to itself consists of all transformations of the form
:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = e^{i\phi} \frac{z + b}{\bar{b} z + 1}&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; ∈ '''R''', ''b'' ∈ '''C''' and |''b''| &lt; 1. This is equal to the group of all biholomorphic (or equivalently: bijective, angle-preserving and orientation-preserving) maps {{nowrap|''D'' → ''D''}}. By introducing a suitable metric, the open disk turns into another model of the hyperbolic plane, the [[Poincaré disk model]], and this group is the group of all orientation-preserving isometries of ''H''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt; in this model.

Since both of the above subgroups serve as isometry groups of ''H&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;'', they are isomorphic. A concrete isomorphism is given by [[inner automorphism|conjugation]] with the transformation
:&lt;math&gt;f(z)=\frac{z+i}{iz+1}&lt;/math&gt;
which bijectively maps the open unit disk to the upper half plane.

Alternatively, consider an open disk with radius ''r'', centered at ''ri''. The Poincaré disk model in this disk becomes identical to the upper-half-plane model as ''r'' approaches ∞.

A [[maximal compact subgroup]] of the Möbius group &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; is given by&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation|Tóth|2002|loc=Section 1.2, Rotations and Möbius Transformations, [https://books.google.com/books?id=i76mmyvDHYUC&amp;pg=PA22 p.&amp;nbsp;22]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_0 := \left\{z \mapsto \frac{uz - \bar v}{vz + \bar u} : |u|^2 + |v|^2 = 1\right\},&lt;/math&gt;
and corresponds under the isomorphism &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M} \cong \operatorname{PSL}(2,\mathbf{C})&lt;/math&gt; to the [[projective special unitary group]] PSU(2,'''C''') which is isomorphic to the [[special orthogonal group]] SO(3) of rotations in three dimensions, and can be interpreted as rotations of the Riemann sphere. Every finite subgroup is conjugate into this maximal compact group, and thus these correspond exactly to the polyhedral groups, the [[point groups in three dimensions]].

[[Icosahedral group]]s of Möbius transformations were used by [[Felix Klein]] to give an analytic solution to the [[quintic equation]] in {{Harvard citation|Klein|1888}}; a modern exposition is given in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation|Tóth|2002|loc=Section 1.6, Additional Topic: Klein's Theory of the Icosahedron, [https://books.google.com/books?id=i76mmyvDHYUC&amp;pg=PA66 p.&amp;nbsp;66]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If we require the coefficients ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' of a Möbius transformation to be [[integer]]s with ''ad'' − ''bc'' = 1, we obtain the [[modular group]] PSL(2,'''Z'''), a discrete subgroup of PSL(2,'''R''') important in the study of [[Lattice (order)|lattice]]s in the complex plane, [[elliptic function]]s and [[elliptic curve]]s. The discrete subgroups of PSL(2,'''R''') are known as [[Fuchsian group]]s; they are important in the study of [[Riemann surface]]s.

== Classification ==
[[File:Apollonian circles.svg|thumb|A hyperbolic transformation is shown.  Pre-images of the unit circle are [[circles of Apollonius]] with distance ratio ''c''/''a'' and foci at −''b''/''a'' and −''d''/''c'' . {{paragraph break}} For the same foci −''b''/''a'' and −''d''/''c'' the red circles map to rays through the origin.]]

In the following discussion we will always assume that the representing matrix &lt;math&gt; \mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt; is normalized such that &lt;math&gt; \det{\mathfrak{H}}=ad-bc=1 &lt;/math&gt;.

Non-identity Möbius transformations are commonly classified into four types, '''parabolic''', '''elliptic''', '''hyperbolic''' and '''loxodromic''', with the hyperbolic ones being a subclass of the loxodromic ones. The classification has both algebraic and geometric significance. Geometrically, the different types result in different transformations of the complex plane, as the figures below illustrate.

The four types can be distinguished by looking at the [[trace (matrix)|trace]] &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr}\,\mathfrak{H}=a+d&lt;/math&gt;. Note that the trace is invariant under [[conjugacy class|conjugation]], that is,

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr}\,\mathfrak{GHG}^{-1} = \operatorname{tr}\,\mathfrak{H},&lt;/math&gt;

and so every member of a conjugacy class will have the same trace. Every Möbius transformation can be written such that its representing matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt; has determinant one (by multiplying the entries with a suitable scalar). Two Möbius transformations &lt;math&gt; \mathfrak{H}, \mathfrak{H}'&lt;/math&gt; (both not equal to the identity transform) with &lt;math&gt; \det \mathfrak{H}=\det\mathfrak{H}'=1 &lt;/math&gt; are conjugate if and only if &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{tr}^2\,\mathfrak{H}= \operatorname{tr}^2\,\mathfrak{H}'.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Parabolic transforms ===
[[File:Smith chart explanation.svg|thumb|500px|right|The [[Smith chart]], used by [[electrical engineering|electrical engineers]] for analyzing [[transmission line]]s, is a visual depiction of the parabolic Möbius transformation {{nowrap begin}}''z''{{=}}(Γ+1)/(−Γ+1).{{nowrap end}} Each point on the Smith chart simultaneously represents both a value of ''z'' (bottom left), and the corresponding value of Γ (bottom right), for  &amp;#124;Γ &amp;#124;&amp;lt;1.]]
A non-identity Möbius transformation defined by a matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt; of determinant one is said to be ''parabolic'' if

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr}^2\mathfrak{H} = (a+d)^2 = 4&lt;/math&gt;

(so the trace is plus or minus 2; either can occur for a given transformation since &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt; is determined only up to sign). In fact one of the choices for &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt; has the same [[characteristic polynomial]] ''X''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;−2''X''+1 as the identity matrix, and is therefore [[unipotent]]. A Möbius transform is parabolic if and only if it has exactly one fixed point in the [[Riemann sphere|extended complex plane]] &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathbf{C}}=\mathbf{C}\cup\{\infty\}&lt;/math&gt;, which happens if and only if it can be defined by a matrix [[conjugacy class|conjugate to]]

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

which describes a translation in the complex plane.

The set of all parabolic Möbius transformations with a ''given'' fixed point in &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathbf{C}}&lt;/math&gt;, together with the identity, forms a [[group (mathematics)|subgroup]] isomorphic to the group of matrices

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; b \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}\mid b\in\mathbf C\right\};&lt;/math&gt;

this is an example of the [[unipotent|unipotent radical]] of a [[Borel subgroup]] (of the Möbius group, or of SL(2,'''C''') for the matrix group; the notion is defined for any [[reductive Lie group]]).

=== Characteristic constant ===
All non-parabolic transformations have two fixed points and are defined by a matrix conjugate to

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} \lambda &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda^{-1} \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

with the complex number λ not equal to 0, 1 or −1, corresponding to a dilation/rotation through multiplication by the complex number ''k'' = λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, called the '''characteristic constant''' or '''multiplier''' of the transformation.

=== Elliptic transforms ===
The transformation is said to be ''elliptic'' if it can be represented by a matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak H&lt;/math&gt; whose trace is [[real number|real]] with

:&lt;math&gt;0 \le \operatorname{tr}^2\mathfrak{H} &lt; 4.\,&lt;/math&gt;

A transform is elliptic if and only if |λ| = 1 and λ ≠ ±1. Writing &lt;math&gt;\lambda=e^{i\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, an elliptic transform is conjugate to
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} \cos\alpha &amp; -\sin\alpha \\
\sin\alpha &amp; \cos\alpha \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

with α real.

Note that for ''any'' &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt; with characteristic constant ''k'', the characteristic constant of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}^n&lt;/math&gt; is ''k&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''. Thus, all Möbius transformations of finite [[order (group theory)|order]] are elliptic transformations, namely exactly those where λ is a [[root of unity]], or, equivalently, where α is a [[Rational number|rational]] multiple of [[pi|{{pi}}]]. The simplest possibility of a fractional multiple means ''α'' = {{pi}}/2, which is also the unique case of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr}\mathfrak{H} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, is also denoted as a '''{{visible anchor|circular transform}}'''; this corresponds geometrically to rotation by 180° about two fixed points. This class is represented in matrix form as:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; -1 \\
1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
There are 3 representatives fixing {0, 1, ∞}, which are the three transpositions in the symmetry group of these 3 points: &lt;math&gt;1/z,&lt;/math&gt; which fixes 1 and swaps 0 with ''∞'' (rotation by 180° about the points 1 and −1), &lt;math&gt;1-z&lt;/math&gt;, which fixes ''∞'' and swaps 0 with 1 (rotation by 180° about the points 1/2 and ''∞''), and &lt;math&gt;z/(z - 1)&lt;/math&gt; which fixes 0 and swaps 1 with ''∞'' (rotation by 180° about the points 0 and 2).

=== Hyperbolic transforms ===
The transform is said to be ''hyperbolic'' if it can be represented by a matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak H&lt;/math&gt; whose trace is [[real number|real]] with

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr}^2\mathfrak{H} &gt; 4.\,&lt;/math&gt;

A transform is hyperbolic if and only if λ is real and positive.

=== Loxodromic transforms ===
The transform is said to be ''loxodromic'' if &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr}^2\mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt; is not in [0,4]. A transformation is loxodromic if and only if &lt;math&gt;|\lambda|\ne 1&lt;/math&gt;.

Historically, [[navigation]] by [[loxodrome]] or [[rhumb line]] refers to a path of constant [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]]; the resulting path is a [[logarithmic spiral]], similar in shape to the transformations of the complex plane that a loxodromic Möbius transformation makes. See the geometric figures below.

=== The real case and a note on terminology ===
Over the real numbers (if the coefficients must be real), there are no non-hyperbolic loxodromic transformations, and the classification is into elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic, as for real [[conic]]s. The terminology is due to considering half the absolute value of the trace, |tr|/2, as the [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] of the transformation&amp;nbsp;– division by 2 corrects for the dimension, so the identity has eccentricity 1 (tr/''n'' is sometimes used as an alternative for the trace for this reason), and absolute value corrects for the trace only being defined up to a factor of ±1 due to working in PSL. Alternatively one may use half the trace ''squared'' as a proxy for the eccentricity squared, as was done above; these classifications (but not the exact eccentricity values, since squaring and absolute values are different) agree for real traces but not complex traces. The same terminology is used for the [[SL2(R)#Classification of elements|classification of elements of SL(2, '''R''')]] (the 2-fold cover), and [[Eccentricity (mathematics)#Analogous classifications|analogous classifications]] are used elsewhere. Loxodromic transformations are an essentially complex phenomenon, and correspond to complex eccentricities.

== Geometric interpretation of the characteristic constant ==
The following picture depicts (after stereographic transformation from the sphere to the plane) the two fixed points of a Möbius transformation in the non-parabolic case:

[[File:Mobius Identity.jpeg]]

The characteristic constant can be expressed in terms of its [[Natural logarithm|logarithm]]:
:&lt;math&gt;e^{\rho + \alpha i} = k. \;&lt;/math&gt;
When expressed in this way, the real number ρ becomes an expansion factor. It indicates how repulsive the fixed point γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is, and how attractive γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is. The real number α is a rotation factor, indicating to what extent the transform rotates the plane anti-clockwise about γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and clockwise about γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Elliptic transformations ===
If ρ = 0, then the fixed points are neither attractive nor repulsive but indifferent, and the transformation is said to be ''elliptic''. These transformations tend to move all points in circles around the two fixed points. If one of the fixed points is at infinity, this is equivalent to doing an affine rotation around a point.

If we take the [[one-parameter subgroup]] generated by any elliptic Möbius transformation, we obtain a continuous transformation, such that every transformation in the subgroup fixes the ''same'' two points. All other points flow along a family of circles which is nested between the two fixed points on the Riemann sphere. In general, the two fixed points can be any two distinct points.

This has an important physical interpretation.
Imagine that some observer rotates with constant angular velocity about some axis. Then we can take the two fixed points to be the North and South poles of the celestial sphere. The appearance of the night sky is now transformed continuously in exactly the manner described by the one-parameter subgroup of elliptic transformations sharing the fixed points 0, ∞, and with the number α corresponding to the constant angular velocity of our observer.

Here are some figures illustrating the effect of an elliptic Möbius transformation on the Riemann sphere (after stereographic projection to the plane):

[[File:Mobius Small Neg Elliptical.jpeg]]

[[File:Mobius Large Pos Elliptical.jpeg]]

These pictures illustrate the effect of a single Möbius transformation. The one-parameter subgroup which it generates ''continuously'' moves points along the family of circular arcs suggested by the pictures.

=== Hyperbolic transformations ===

If α is zero (or a multiple of 2{{pi}}), then the transformation is said to be ''hyperbolic''. These transformations tend to move points along circular paths from one fixed point toward the other.

If we take the [[one-parameter group|one-parameter subgroup]] generated by any hyperbolic Möbius transformation, we obtain a continuous transformation, such that every transformation in the subgroup fixes the ''same'' two points. All other points flow along a certain family of circular arcs ''away'' from the first fixed point and ''toward'' the second fixed point. In general, the two fixed points may be any two distinct points on the Riemann sphere.

This too has an important physical interpretation. Imagine that an observer accelerates (with constant magnitude of acceleration) in the direction of the North pole on his celestial sphere. Then the appearance of the night sky is transformed in exactly the manner described by the one-parameter subgroup of hyperbolic transformations sharing the fixed points 0, ∞, with the real number ρ corresponding to the magnitude of his acceleration vector. The stars seem to move along longitudes, away from the South pole toward the North pole. (The longitudes appear as circular arcs under stereographic projection from the sphere to the plane.)

Here are some figures illustrating the effect of a hyperbolic Möbius transformation on the Riemann sphere (after stereographic projection to the plane):

[[File:Mobius Small Neg Hyperbolic.jpeg]]

[[File:Mobius Large Pos Hyperbolic.jpeg]]

These pictures resemble the field lines of a positive and a negative electrical charge located at the fixed points, because the circular flow lines subtend a constant angle between the two fixed points.

=== Loxodromic transformations ===

If both ρ and α are nonzero, then the transformation is said to be ''loxodromic''. These transformations tend to move all points in S-shaped paths from one fixed point to the other.

The word "[[loxodrome]]" is from the Greek: "λοξος (loxos), ''slanting'' + δρόμος (dromos), ''course''". When [[sailing]] on a constant [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]] – if you maintain a heading of (say) north-east, you will eventually wind up sailing around the [[north pole]] in a [[logarithmic spiral]]. On the [[mercator projection]] such a course is a straight line, as the north and south poles project to infinity. The angle that the loxodrome subtends relative to the lines of longitude (i.e. its slope, the "tightness" of the spiral) is the argument of ''k''. Of course, Möbius transformations may have their two fixed points anywhere, not just at the north and south poles. But any loxodromic transformation will be conjugate to a transform that moves all points along such loxodromes.

If we take the [[one-parameter group|one-parameter subgroup]] generated by any loxodromic Möbius transformation, we obtain a continuous transformation, such that every transformation in the subgroup fixes the ''same'' two points. All other points flow along a certain family of curves, ''away'' from the first fixed point and ''toward'' the second fixed point. Unlike the hyperbolic case, these curves are not circular arcs, but certain curves which under stereographic projection from the sphere to the plane appear as spiral curves which twist counterclockwise infinitely often around one fixed point and twist clockwise infinitely often around the other fixed point. In general, the two fixed points may be any two distinct points on the Riemann sphere.

You can probably guess the physical interpretation in the case when the two fixed points are 0, ∞: an observer who is both rotating (with constant angular velocity) about some axis and moving along the ''same'' axis, will see the appearance of the night sky transform according to the one-parameter subgroup of loxodromic transformations with fixed points 0, ∞, and with ρ, α determined respectively by the magnitude of the actual linear and angular velocities.

=== Stereographic projection ===
These images show Möbius transformations [[stereographic projection|stereographically projected]] onto the [[Riemann sphere]]. Note in particular that when projected onto a sphere, the special case of a fixed point at infinity looks no different from having the fixed points in an arbitrary location.

== Iterating a transformation ==

If a transformation &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt; has fixed points γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and characteristic constant ''k'', then &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}' = \mathfrak{H}^n&lt;/math&gt; will have &lt;math&gt;\gamma_1' = \gamma_1, \gamma_2' = \gamma_2, k' = k^n&lt;/math&gt;.

This can be used to [[iterate (math)|iterate]] a transformation, or to animate one by breaking it up into steps.

These images show three points (red, blue and black) continuously iterated under transformations with various characteristic constants.

And these images demonstrate what happens when you transform a circle under Hyperbolic, Elliptical, and Loxodromic transforms. Note that in the elliptical and loxodromic images, the α value is 1/10 .

&lt;!-- TODO. Mention the idea of a pencil of transformations. Link here
[[User:Pmurray_bigpond.com/Geometry of Complex Numbers]] --&gt;

== Poles of the transformation ==

The point
:&lt;math&gt;z_\infty = - \frac{d}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

is called the pole of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt;; it is that point which is transformed to the point at infinity under &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt;.

The inverse pole
:&lt;math&gt;Z_\infty = \frac{a}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

is that point to which the point at infinity is transformed.
The point midway between the two poles is always the same as the point midway between the two fixed points:

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_1 + \gamma_2 = z_\infty + Z_\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

These four points are the vertices of a parallelogram which is sometimes called the '''characteristic parallelogram''' of the transformation.

A transform &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt; can be specified with two fixed points γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the pole &lt;math&gt;z_\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H} =
\begin{pmatrix}
Z_\infty &amp; - \gamma_1 \gamma_2 \\
1        &amp; - z_\infty
\end{pmatrix}, \;\;
Z_\infty = \gamma_1 + \gamma_2 - z_\infty.
&lt;/math&gt;

This allows us to derive a formula for conversion between ''k'' and &lt;math&gt;z_\infty&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;\gamma_1, \gamma_2&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;z_\infty = \frac{k \gamma_1 - \gamma_2}{1 - k}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;k= \frac{\gamma_2 - z_\infty}{\gamma_1 - z_\infty}
= \frac{Z_\infty - \gamma_1}{Z_\infty - \gamma_2}
= \frac {a - c \gamma_1}{a - c \gamma_2},&lt;/math&gt;

which reduces down to
:&lt;math&gt;k = \frac{(a + d) + \sqrt {(a - d)^2 + 4 b c}}{(a + d) - \sqrt {(a - d)^2 + 4 b c}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The last expression coincides with one of the (mutually reciprocal) [[eigenvalue]] ratios &lt;math&gt; \lambda_1\over \lambda_2&lt;/math&gt; of the matrix
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H} =
\begin{pmatrix}
a &amp; b \\
c &amp; d
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
representing the transform (compare the discussion in the preceding section about the characteristic constant of a transformation). Its characteristic polynomial is equal to
:&lt;math&gt;
\det (\lambda I_2- \mathfrak{H})
=\lambda^2-\operatorname{tr} \mathfrak{H}\,\lambda+
\det \mathfrak{H}
=\lambda^2-(a+d)\lambda+(ad-bc)
&lt;/math&gt;
which has roots
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda_{i}=\frac{(a + d) \pm \sqrt {(a - d)^2 + 4 b c}}{2}=\frac{(a + d) \pm \sqrt {(a + d)^2 - 4(ad-b c)}}{2}=c\gamma_i+d \ .
&lt;/math&gt;

==Higher dimensions==
In higher dimensions, a '''Möbius transformation''' is a [[homeomorphism]] of &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathbb R^n}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[one-point compactification]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt;, which is a finite composition of [[Inversion in a sphere|inversions in spheres]] and [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflections]] in [[hyperplanes]].&lt;ref&gt;Iwaniec, Tadeusz and Martin, Gaven, The Liouville theorem, Analysis and topology, 339–361, World Sci. Publ., River Edge, NJ, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liouville's theorem (conformal mappings)|Liouville's theorem in conformal geometry]] states that in dimension at least three, all [[Conformal map|conformal]] transformations are Möbius transformations. Every Möbius transformation can be put in the form

&lt;math&gt;f(x) = b + \frac{\alpha A(x - a)}{|x - a|^\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a,b\in \mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an [[orthogonal matrix]], and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is 0 or 2. The group of Möbius transformations is also called the '''Möbius group'''.&lt;ref&gt;J.B. Wilker (1981) "Inversive Geometry", {{mr|id=667693}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The orientation-preserving Möbius transformations form the connected component of the identity in the Möbius group.  In dimension {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 2}}, the orientation-preserving Möbius transformations are exactly the maps of the Riemann sphere covered here.  The orientation-reversing ones are obtained from these by complex conjugation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Marcel|last=Berger|authorlink=Marcel Berger|title=Geometry II|page=18.10|year=1987|publisher=Springer (Universitext)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The domain of Möbius transformations, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathbb R^n}&lt;/math&gt;, is homeomorphic to the ''n''-dimensional sphere &lt;math&gt;S^n&lt;/math&gt;. The canonical isomorphism between these two spaces is the [[Cayley transform]], which is itself a Möbius transformation of &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathbb R^{n + 1}}&lt;/math&gt;. This identification means that Möbius transformations can also be thought of as conformal isomorphisms of &lt;math&gt;S^n&lt;/math&gt;. The ''n''-sphere, together with action of the Möbius group, is a geometric structure (in the sense of Klein's [[Erlangen program]]) called [[Conformal geometry#Möbius geometry|Möbius geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Maks|last1=Akivis|first2=Vladislav|last2=Goldberg|title=Conformal differential geometry and its generalizations|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

=== Lorentz transformation ===
{{main|Lorentz transformation}}
An isomorphism of the Möbius group with the [[Lorentz group]] was noted by several authors: Based on previous work of [[Felix Klein]] (1893, 1897)&lt;ref&gt;Felix Klein (1893), [https://archive.org/details/nichteuklidisch00liebgoog Nicht-Euklidische Geometrie], Autogr. Vorl., Göttingen; [[Robert Fricke]] &amp; Felix Klein (1897), [https://archive.org/details/vorlesungenber01fricuoft Autormorphe Funktionen I.], Teubner, Leipzig&lt;/ref&gt; on [[automorphic function]]s related to hyperbolic geometry and Möbius geometry, [[Gustav Herglotz]] (1909)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Herglotz, Gustav|year=1910|orig-year=1909|title=Über den vom Standpunkt des Relativitätsprinzips aus als starr zu bezeichnenden Körper|trans-title=Wikisource translation: [[s:Translation:On bodies that are to be designated as "rigid"|On bodies that are to be designated as "rigid" from the standpoint of the relativity principle]]|journal=Annalen der Physik|volume=336|issue=2 |pages=393–415|doi=10.1002/andp.19103360208|bibcode = 1910AnP...336..393H }}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that [[hyperbolic motion]]s (i.e. [[isometry|isometric]] [[automorphism]]s of a [[hyperbolic space]]) transforming the [[unit sphere]] into itself correspond to Lorentz transformations, by which Herglotz was able to classify the one-parameter Lorentz transformations into loxodromic, elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic groups. Other authors include [[Emil Artin]] (1957),&lt;ref&gt;Emil Artin (1957) ''[[Geometric Algebra]]'', page 204&lt;/ref&gt; [[H. S. M. Coxeter]] (1965),&lt;ref&gt;[[H. S. M. Coxeter]] (1967) "The Lorentz group and the group of homographies", in L. G. Kovacs &amp; B. H. Neumann (editors) ''Proceedings of the International Conference on The Theory of Groups held at Australian National University, Canberra, 10—20 August 1965'', [[Gordon and Breach]] Science Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Roger Penrose]] and [[Wolfgang Rindler]] (1984).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Spinors and Space-Time: Vol I, Two-Spinor Calculus and Relativistic Fields |last1=Penrose |first1=R. |last2=Rindler |first2=W. |pages=8–31 |year=1984 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-24527-3 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CzhhKkf1xJUC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Minkowski space]] consists of the four-dimensional real coordinate space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; consisting of the space of ordered quadruples (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) of real numbers, together with a [[quadratic form]]

:&lt;math&gt;Q(x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3) = x_0^2-x_1^2-x_2^2-x_3^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Borrowing terminology from [[special relativity]], points with ''Q''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 are considered ''timelike''; in addition, if ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, then the point is called ''future-pointing''. Points with ''Q''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0 are called ''spacelike''. The [[null cone]] ''S'' consists of those points where ''Q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0; the ''future null cone'' ''N''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; are those points on the null cone with ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0. The [[celestial sphere]] is then identified with the collection of rays in ''N''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; whose initial point is the origin of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. The collection of [[linear transformation]]s on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; with positive [[determinant]] preserving the quadratic form ''Q'' and preserving the time direction form the [[restricted Lorentz group]] SO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(1,3).

In connection with the geometry of the celestial sphere, the group of transformations SO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(1,3) is identified with the group PSL(2,'''C''') of Möbius transformations of the sphere. To each (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, associate the [[hermitian matrix]]

:&lt;math&gt;X=\begin{bmatrix}
x_0+x_1 &amp; x_2+ix_3\\
x_2-ix_3 &amp; x_0-x_1
\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[determinant]] of the matrix ''X'' is equal to ''Q''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The [[special linear group]] acts on the space of such matrices via

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;X\mapsto AXA^*&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

for each ''A'' ∈ SL(2,'''C'''), and this action of SL(2,'''C''') preserves the determinant of ''X'' because {{nowrap|1=det ''A'' = 1}}. Since the determinant of ''X'' is identified with the quadratic form ''Q'', SL(2,'''C''') acts by Lorentz transformations. On dimensional grounds, SL(2,'''C''') covers a neighborhood of the identity of SO(1,3). Since SL(2,'''C''') is connected, it covers the entire restricted Lorentz group SO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(1,3). Furthermore, since the [[kernel (group theory)|kernel]] of the action ({{EquationNote|1}}) is the subgroup {±''I''}, then passing to the [[quotient group]] gives the [[group isomorphism]]

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{PSL}(2,\mathbf{C})\cong SO^+(1,3).&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

Focusing now attention on the case when (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is null, the matrix ''X'' has zero determinant, and therefore splits as the [[outer product]] of a complex two-vector ξ with its complex conjugate:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;X = \xi\bar{\xi}^T=\xi\xi^*.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

The two-component vector ξ is acted upon by SL(2,'''C''') in a manner compatible with ({{EquationNote|1}}). It is now clear that the kernel of the representation of SL(2,'''C''') on hermitian matrices is {±''I''}.

The action of PSL(2,'''C''') on the celestial sphere may also be described geometrically using [[stereographic projection]]. Consider first the hyperplane in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; given by ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1. The celestial sphere may be identified with the sphere ''S''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; of intersection of the hyperplane with the future null cone ''N''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The stereographic projection from the north pole (1,0,0,1) of this sphere onto the plane ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 takes a point with coordinates (1,''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) with

:&lt;math&gt;x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2=1&lt;/math&gt;

to the point

:&lt;math&gt;\left(1, \frac{x_1}{1-x_3}, \frac{x_2}{1-x_3},0\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Introducing the [[complex number|complex]] coordinate

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta = \frac{x_1+ix_2}{1-x_3},&lt;/math&gt;

the inverse stereographic projection gives the following formula for a point (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) on ''S''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
x_1 &amp;= \frac{\zeta+\bar{\zeta}}{\zeta\bar{\zeta}+1}\\
x_2 &amp;= \frac{\zeta-\bar{\zeta}}{i(\zeta\bar{\zeta}+1)}\\
x_3 &amp;= \frac{\zeta\bar{\zeta}-1}{\zeta\bar{\zeta}+1}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

The action of SO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(1,3) on the points of ''N''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; does not preserve the hyperplane ''S''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, but acting on points in ''S''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and then rescaling so that the result is again in ''S''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; gives an action of SO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(1,3) on the sphere which goes over to an action on the complex variable ζ. In fact, this action is by fractional linear transformations, although this is not easily seen from this representation of the celestial sphere. Conversely, for any fractional linear transformation of ζ variable goes over to a unique Lorentz transformation on ''N''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, possibly after a suitable (uniquely determined) rescaling.

A more invariant description of the stereographic projection which allows the action to be more clearly seen is to consider the variable ζ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''z'':''w'' as a ratio of a pair of homogeneous coordinates for the complex projective line '''CP'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The stereographic projection goes over to a transformation from '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;{0} to ''N''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; which is homogeneous of degree two with respect to real scalings

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;(z,w)\mapsto (x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3)=(z\bar{z}+w\bar{w}, z\bar{w}+w\bar{z}, i^{-1}(z\bar{w}-w\bar{z}), z\bar{z}-w\bar{w})&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}

which agrees with ({{EquationNote|4}}) upon restriction to scales in which &lt;math&gt;z\bar{z}+w\bar{w}=1.&lt;/math&gt; The components of ({{EquationNote|5}}) are precisely those obtained from the outer product

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
x_0+x_1 &amp; x_2+ix_3\\
x_2-ix_3 &amp; x_0-x_1
\end{bmatrix} =
2\begin{bmatrix}
z\\ w
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\bar{z}&amp;\bar{w}
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

In summary, the action of the restricted Lorentz group SO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(1,3) agrees with that of the Möbius group PSL(2,'''C'''). This motivates the following definition. In dimension ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2, the '''Möbius group''' Möb(''n'') is the group of all orientation-preserving [[conformal geometry|conformal]] [[isometry|isometries]] of the round sphere ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to itself. By realizing the conformal sphere as the space of future-pointing rays of the null cone in the Minkowski space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;1,n+1&lt;/sup&gt;, there is an isomorphism of Möb(''n'') with the restricted Lorentz group SO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(1,''n''+1) of Lorentz transformations with positive determinant, preserving the direction of time.

Coxeter began instead with the equivalent quadratic form &lt;math&gt;Q(x_1,\ x_2,\ x_3 \ x_4) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 - x_4^2 .&lt;/math&gt;

He identified the Lorentz group with transformations for which {''x'' : Q(''x'') = -1} is [[invariant (mathematics)#Invariant set|stable]]. Then he interpreted the x's as [[homogeneous coordinates]]  and {''x'' : Q(''x'') = 0}, the [[null cone]], as the [[Cayley absolute]] for a hyperbolic space of points {''x'' : Q(''x'') &lt; 0}. Next, Coxeter introduced the variables
:&lt;math&gt;\xi = \frac {x_1}{x_4} , \ \eta = \frac {x_2}{x_4}, \ \zeta = \frac {x_3}{x_4} &lt;/math&gt;

so that the Lorentz-invariant quadric corresponds to the sphere &lt;math&gt;\xi^2 + \eta^2 + \zeta^2 = 1 .&lt;/math&gt; Coxeter notes that [[Felix Klein]] also wrote of this correspondence, applying stereographic projection from (0, 0, 1) to the complex plane &lt;math&gt;z = \frac{\xi + i \eta}{1 - \zeta}.&lt;/math&gt;
Coxeter used the fact that circles of the inversive plane represent planes of hyperbolic space, and the general homography is the product of inversions in two or four circles, corresponding to the general hyperbolic displacement which is the product of inversions in two or four planes.

=== Hyperbolic space ===
As seen above, the Möbius group PSL(2,'''C''') acts on Minkowski space as the group of those isometries that preserve the origin, the orientation of space and the direction of time. Restricting to the points where ''Q''=1 in the positive light cone, which form a model of [[hyperbolic space|hyperbolic 3-space]] ''H''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;3&lt;/sup&gt;, we see that the Möbius group acts on ''H''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;3&lt;/sup&gt; as a group of orientation-preserving isometries. In fact, the Möbius group is equal to the group of orientation-preserving isometries of hyperbolic 3-space.

If we use the [[Poincaré disk model|Poincaré ball model]], identifying the unit ball in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; with ''H''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;3&lt;/sup&gt;, then we can think of the Riemann sphere as the "conformal boundary" of ''H''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Every orientation-preserving isometry of ''H''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;3&lt;/sup&gt; gives rise to a Möbius transformation on the Riemann sphere and vice versa; this is the very first observation leading to the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]] conjectures in physics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34388">In [[mathematics]], '''Newton's identities''', also known as the '''Newton–Girard formulae''', give relations between two types of [[symmetric polynomial]]s, namely between [[Power sum symmetric polynomial|power sums]] and [[elementary symmetric polynomial]]s. Evaluated at the [[Root of a function|root]]s of a monic [[polynomial]] ''P'' in one variable, they allow expressing the sums of the ''k''-th [[power (mathematics)|power]]s of all roots of ''P'' (counted with their multiplicity) in terms of the coefficients of ''P'', without actually finding those roots. These identities were found by [[Isaac Newton]] around 1666, apparently in ignorance of earlier work (1629) by [[Albert Girard]].  They have applications in many areas of mathematics, including [[Galois theory]], [[invariant theory]], [[group theory]], [[combinatorics]], as well as further applications outside mathematics, including [[general relativity]].

== Mathematical statement ==

=== Formulation in terms of symmetric polynomials ===
Let ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; be variables, denote for ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1 by ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) the ''k''-th '''power sum''':

: &lt;math display="block"&gt;p_k(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=\sum\nolimits_{i=1}^nx_i^k = x_1^k+\cdots+x_n^k,&lt;/math&gt;

and for ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 denote by ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) the [[elementary symmetric polynomial]] (that is, the sum of all distinct products of ''k'' distinct variables), so

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  e_0(x_1, \ldots, x_n) &amp;= 1,\\
  e_1(x_1, \ldots, x_n) &amp;= x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n,\\
  e_2(x_1, \ldots, x_n) &amp;= \textstyle\sum_{1\leq i&lt;j\leq n}x_ix_j,\\
  e_n(x_1, \ldots, x_n) &amp;= x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n,\\
  e_k(x_1, \ldots, x_n) &amp;= 0, \quad\text{for}\ k&gt;n.\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Then Newton's identities can be stated as

: &lt;math&gt; ke_k(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = \sum_{i=1}^k(-1)^{i-1} e_{k - i} (x_1, \ldots, x_n) p_i(x_1, \ldots, x_n),&lt;/math&gt;

valid for all ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1 and ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1.

Also, one has

: &lt;math&gt; 0 = \sum_{i=k-n}^k(-1)^{i-1} e_{k - i} (x_1, \ldots, x_n) p_i(x_1, \ldots, x_n),&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1.

Concretely, one gets for the first few values of ''k'':

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
   e_1(x_1, \ldots, x_n) &amp;= p_1(x_1, \ldots, x_n),\\
  2e_2(x_1, \ldots, x_n) &amp;= e_1(x_1, \ldots, x_n)p_1(x_1, \ldots, x_n) - p_2(x_1, \ldots, x_n),\\
  3e_3(x_1, \ldots, x_n) &amp;= e_2(x_1, \ldots, x_n)p_1(x_1, \ldots, x_n) - e_1(x_1, \ldots, x_n)p_2(x_1, \ldots, x_n) + p_3(x_1, \ldots, x_n).\\ 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The form and validity of these equations do not depend on the number ''n'' of variables (although the point where the left-hand side becomes&amp;nbsp;0 does, namely after the ''n''-th identity), which makes it possible to state them as identities in the [[ring of symmetric functions]]. In that ring one has

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
   e_1 &amp;= p_1,\\
  2e_2 &amp;= e_1p_1-p_2,\\
  3e_3 &amp;= e_2p_1 - e_1p_2 + p_3,\\
  4e_4 &amp;= e_3p_1 - e_2p_2 + e_1p_3 - p_4,\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and so on; here the left-hand sides never become zero.
These equations allow to recursively express the ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; in terms of the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;; to be able to do the inverse, one may rewrite them as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  p_1 &amp;= e_1,\\
  p_2 &amp;= e_1p_1-2e_2,\\
  p_3 &amp;= e_1p_2 - e_2p_1 + 3e_3 ,\\
  p_4 &amp;= e_1p_3 - e_2p_2 + e_3p_1 - 4e_4, \\
      &amp; {}\ \ \vdots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In general, we have

: &lt;math&gt; p_k(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = (-1)^{k-1}ke_k(x_1,\ldots,x_n)+\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}(-1)^{k-1+i} e_{k - i} (x_1, \ldots, x_n) p_i(x_1, \ldots, x_n),&lt;/math&gt;

valid for all ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1 and ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1.

Also, one has

: &lt;math&gt; p_k(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = \sum_{i=k-n}^{k-1}(-1)^{k-1+i} e_{k - i} (x_1, \ldots, x_n) p_i(x_1, \ldots, x_n),&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1.

=== Application to the roots of a polynomial ===
The polynomial with roots ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; may be expanded as

:&lt;math&gt; \prod_{i=1}^n \left( x - x_i \right) = \sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^{k} e_{k} x^{n-k},&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[coefficients]] &lt;math&gt;e_k(x_1,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; are the symmetric polynomials defined above.
Given the ''power sums'' of the roots

:&lt;math&gt; p_k(x_1,\ldots,x_n)= \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^k,&lt;/math&gt;

the coefficients of the polynomial with roots &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt; may be expressed recursively in terms of the power sums as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  e_0 &amp;= 1,\\[4pt]
 -e_1 &amp;=-p_1,\\[4pt]
  e_2 &amp;= \frac{1}{2}(e_1 p_1 - p_2),\\[4pt]
 -e_3 &amp;=-\frac{1}{3}(e_2 p_1 - e_1 p_2 + p_3),\\[4pt]
  e_4 &amp;= \frac{1}{4}(e_3 p_1 - e_2 p_2 + e_1 p_3 - p_4), \\
      &amp; {} \  \  \vdots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Formulating polynomials in this way is useful in using the method of Delves and Lyness&lt;ref name=Delves_Lyness_1967&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Delves|first1=L. M.|title=A Numerical Method of Locating the Zeros of an Analytic Function|journal=Mathematics of Computation|date=1967|volume=21|pages=543–560|doi=10.2307/2004999}}&lt;/ref&gt; to find the zeros of an analytic function.

=== Application to the characteristic polynomial of a matrix ===

When the polynomial above is the [[characteristic polynomial]] of a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] ''A'' (in particular when ''A'' is the [[companion matrix]] of the polynomial), the roots &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; are the [[eigenvalue]]s of the matrix, counted with their algebraic multiplicity. For any positive integer ''k'', the matrix ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; has as eigenvalues the powers ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;, and each eigenvalue &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; of ''A'' contributes its multiplicity to that of the eigenvalue ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; of ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;. Then the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; are given by the elementary symmetric polynomials ''in those powers'' ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;. In particular, the sum of the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;, which is the ''k''-th power sum s&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; of the roots of the characteristic polynomial of ''A'', is given by its [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]]:

:&lt;math&gt;s_k = \operatorname{tr} ( A^k )\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The Newton identities now relate the traces of the powers ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; to the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of ''A''. Using them in reverse to express the elementary symmetric polynomials in terms of the power sums, they can be used to find the characteristic polynomial by computing only the powers ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; and their traces.

This computation requires computing the traces of matrix powers ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; and solving a triangular system of equations. Both can be done in complexity class [[NC (complexity)|NC]] (solving a triangular system can be done by divide-and-conquer). Therefore, characteristic polynomial of a matrix can be computed in NC. By the [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]], every matrix satisfies its characteristic polynomial, and [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem#Illustration for specific dimensions and practical applications|a simple transformation]] allows to find the [[adjugate matrix]] in NC.

Rearranging the computations into an efficient form leads to the ''[[Faddeev&amp;ndash;LeVerrier algorithm]]'' (1840), a fast parallel implementation of it is due to L. Csanky (1976). Its disadvantage is that it requires division by integers, so in general the field should have characteristic, 0.

=== Relation with Galois theory ===

For a given ''n'', the elementary symmetric polynomials ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) for ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,…, ''n'' form an algebraic basis for the space of symmetric polynomials in ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…. ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;: every polynomial expression in the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; that is invariant under all permutations of those variables is given by a [[polynomial]] expression in those elementary symmetric polynomials, and this expression is unique up to equivalence of polynomial expressions. This is a general fact known as the [[fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials]], and Newton's identities provide explicit formulae in the case of power sum symmetric polynomials. Applied to the monic polynomial &lt;math&gt;\textstyle t^n+\sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k} a_k t^{n-k}&lt;/math&gt; with all coefficients ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; considered as free parameters, this means that every symmetric polynomial expression ''S''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) in its roots can be expressed instead as a polynomial expression ''P''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) in terms of its coefficients only, in other words without requiring knowledge of the roots. This fact also follows from general considerations in [[Galois theory]] (one views the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; as elements of a base field with roots in an extension field whose Galois group permutes them according to the full symmetric group, and the field fixed under all elements of the Galois group is the base field).

The Newton identities also permit expressing the elementary symmetric polynomials in terms of the power sum symmetric polynomials, showing that any symmetric polynomial can also be expressed in the power sums. In fact the first ''n'' power sums also form an algebraic basis for the space of symmetric polynomials.

== Related identities ==

There are a number of (families of) identities that, while they should be distinguished from Newton's identities, are very closely related to them.

=== A variant using complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials ===

Denoting by ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; the [[complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial]] that is the sum of all [[monomial]]s of degree&amp;nbsp;''k'', the power sum polynomials also satisfy identities similar to Newton's identities, but not involving any minus signs. Expressed as identities of in the [[ring of symmetric functions]], they read

:&lt;math&gt;kh_k = \sum_{i=1}^kh_{k-i}p_i,&lt;/math&gt;

valid for all n&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1. Contrary to Newton's identities, the left-hand sides do not become zero for large&amp;nbsp;''k'', and the right-hand sides contain ever more non-zero terms. For the first few values of ''k'', one has

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
   h_1 &amp;= p_1,\\
  2h_2 &amp;= h_1p_1 + p_2,\\
  3h_3 &amp;= h_2p_1 + h_1p_2 + p_3.\\ 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These relations can be justified by an argument analogous to the one by comparing coefficients in power series given above, based in this case on the generating function identity

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^\infty h_k(X_1, \ldots, X_n)t^k = \prod_{i=1}^n\frac1{1 - X_it}.&lt;/math&gt;

Proofs of Newton's identities, like these given below, cannot be easily adapted to prove these variants of those identities.

=== Expressing elementary symmetric polynomials in terms of power sums ===

As mentioned, Newton's identities can be used to recursively express elementary symmetric polynomials in terms of power sums. Doing so requires the introduction of integer denominators, so it can be done in the ring Λ&lt;sub&gt;'''Q'''&lt;/sub&gt; of symmetric functions with rational coefficients:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  e_1 &amp;= p_1,\\
  e_2 &amp;= \textstyle\frac12p_1^2 - \frac12p_2 &amp;&amp;= \textstyle\frac12 ( p_1^2 - p_2 ),\\
  e_3 &amp;= \textstyle\frac16p_1^3 - \frac12p_1 p_2 + \frac13p_3 &amp;&amp;= \textstyle\frac{1}{6} ( p_1^3 - 3 p_1 p_2 + 2 p_3 ),\\
  e_4 &amp;= \textstyle\frac1{24}p_1^4 - \frac14p_1^2 p_2 + \frac18p_2^2 + \frac13p_1 p_3 - \frac14p_4 
        &amp;&amp;= \textstyle\frac1{24} ( p_1^4 - 6 p_1^2 p_2 + 3 p_2^2 + 8 p_1 p_3 - 6 p_4 ),\\
&amp;~~\vdots\\
  e_n &amp;= (-1)^n  \sum_{m_1 + 2m_2 + \cdots + nm_n = n \atop m_1 \ge 0, \ldots, m_n \ge 0} \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{(-p_i)^{m_i}}{m_i ! i^{m_i}} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and so forth&lt;ref&gt;N.b., the coefficients of the weighted product terms in the sum given by the identity above are related to the ''M2'' numbers in Section 26.4 of the [https://dlmf.nist.gov/26.4 DLMF] and/or the coefficients involved in the expansions of [[Faa di Bruno's formula]]&lt;/ref&gt;. The general formula can be conveniently expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;e_n = \frac{(-1)^n}{n!} B_{n}(- p_1, -1! p_2, - 2! p_3, \ldots,  - (n-1)! p_n ), &lt;/math&gt;

where the ''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the complete exponential [[Bell polynomial]]. This expression also leads to the following identity for generating functions:
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=0}^\infty e_n \,X^n = \exp\left(\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n} p_n \,X^n \right). &lt;/math&gt;
Applied to a monic polynomial, these formulae express the coefficients in terms of the power sums of the roots: replace each ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; by ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and each ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; by ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Expressing complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials in terms of power sums ===

The analogous relations involving complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials can be similarly developed, giving equations

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  h_1 &amp;= p_1,\\
  h_2 &amp;= \textstyle\frac12p_1^2 + \frac12p_2 &amp;&amp;= \textstyle\frac12 ( p_1^2 + p_2 ),\\
  h_3 &amp;= \textstyle\frac16p_1^3 + \frac12p_1 p_2 + \frac13p_3 &amp;&amp;= \textstyle\frac{1}{6} ( p_1^3 + 3 p_1 p_2 + 2 p_3 ),\\
  h_4 &amp;= \textstyle\frac1{24}p_1^4 + \frac14p_1^2 p_2 + \frac18p_2^2 + \frac13p_1 p_3 + \frac14p_4 
        &amp;&amp;= \textstyle\frac1{24} ( p_1^4 + 6 p_1^2 p_2 + 3 p_2^2 + 8 p_1 p_3 + 6 p_4 ),\\
&amp;~~\vdots\\
  h_n &amp;= \sum_{m_1 + 2m_2 + \cdots + nm_n = n \atop m_1\ge 0, \ldots, m_n\ge 0} \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{p_i^{m_i}}{m_i ! i^{m_i}}\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and so forth, in which there are only plus signs. In terms of the complete Bell polynomial,

:&lt;math&gt;h_n = \frac{1}{n!} B_{n}(p_1, 1! p_2, 2! p_3, \ldots,  (n-1)! p_n ). &lt;/math&gt;

These expressions correspond exactly to the [[cycle index]] polynomials of the [[symmetric group]]s, if one interprets the power sums ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; as indeterminates: the coefficient in the expression for ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; of any monomial ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;…''p''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is equal to the fraction of all permutations of ''k'' that have ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; fixed points, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cycles of length&amp;nbsp;2, …, and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; cycles of length ''l''. Explicitly, this coefficient can be written as &lt;math&gt;1/N&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;N=\prod_{i=1}^l(m_i!\,i^{m_i})&lt;/math&gt;; this ''N'' is the number permutations commuting with any given permutation&amp;nbsp;{{pi}} of the given cycle type. The expressions for the elementary symmetric functions have coefficients with the same absolute value, but a sign equal to the sign of&amp;nbsp;{{pi}}, namely (−1)&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+''m''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;+...&lt;/sup&gt;.

It can be proved by considering the following inductive step:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
mf(m; m_1, \ldots, m_n) &amp;= f(m-1; m_1 - 1, \ldots, m_n) + \cdots + f(m - n; m_1, \ldots, m_n - 1) \\
m_1\prod_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{i^{m_i} m_i!} + \cdots + nm_n \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{i^{m_i} m_i!} &amp;= m\prod_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{i^{m_i} m_i!}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Expressing power sums in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials ===

One may also use Newton's identities to express power sums in terms of symmetric polynomials, which does not introduce denominators:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  p_1 &amp;= e_1,\\
  p_2 &amp;= e_1^2 - 2 e_2,\\
  p_3 &amp;= e_1^3 - 3 e_2 e_1 + 3 e_3,\\
  p_4 &amp;= e_1^4 - 4 e_2 e_1^2 + 4 e_3 e_1 + 2 e_2^2 - 4 e_4,\\
  p_5 &amp;= e_1^5 - 5 e_2 e_1^3 + 5 e_3 e_1^2 + 5 e_2^2 e_1 - 5 e_4 e_1 - 5 e_3e_2 + 5 e_5,\\
  p_6 &amp;= e_1^6 - 6 e_2 e_1^4 + 6 e_3 e_1^3 + 9 e_2^2 e_1^2 - 6 e_4 e_1^2 - 12 e_3 e_2 e_1 + 6 e_5 e_1 - 2 e_2^3 + 3 e_3^2 + 6 e_4 e_2 - 6e_6.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The first four formulas were obtained by [[Albert Girard]] in 1629 (thus before Newton).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tignol|first1=Jean-Pierre|title=Galois' theory of algebraic equations|date=2004|publisher=World Scientific|location=River Edge, NJ|isbn=981-02-4541-6|pages=37–38|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general formula (for all non-negative integers ''m'') is:
:&lt;math&gt;p_m = \sum_{r_1 + 2r_2 + \cdots + mr_m = m \atop r_1\ge 0, \ldots, r_m\ge 0} (-1)^m \frac{m(r_1 + r_2 + \cdots + r_m - 1)!}{r_1!r_2! \cdots r_m!} \prod_{i=1}^m (-e_i)^{r_i}.&lt;/math&gt;

This can be conveniently stated in terms of [[Bell polynomials#Ordinary Bell polynomials|ordinary Bell polynomials]] as 
:&lt;math&gt;p_m = (-1)^m m \sum_{k=1}^m \frac{1}{k} \hat{B}_{m,k}(-e_1,\ldots,-e_{m-k+1}),&lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently as the [[generating function]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld |urlname=SymmetricPolynomial|title=Symmetric Polynomial}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{k-1} p_k \frac{t^k}{k} &amp; = \ln\left(1+e_1t+e_2t^2+e_3t^3+\cdots\right) \\ 
     &amp; = e_1 t - \frac{1}{2}\left(e_1^2-2e_2\right) t^2 + \frac{1}{3}\left(e_1^3-3e_1e_2+3e_3\right) t^3 + \cdots, 
\end{align} 
&lt;/math&gt;
which is analogous to the [[Bell polynomial]] ''exponential'' generating function given in the [[Newton%27s identities#Expressing elementary symmetric polynomials in terms of power sums|previous subsection]].

The multiple summation formula above can be proved by considering the following inductive step: 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  f(m;\; r_1,\ldots,r_n)
    = {} &amp; f(m - 1;\; r_1 - 1, \cdots, r_n) + \cdots + f(m - n;\; r_1, \ldots, r_n - 1)\\[8pt]
    = {} &amp; \frac{1}{(r_1 - 1)!\cdots r_n!}(m - 1)(r_1 + \cdots + r_n - 2)! + \cdots \\
         &amp; \cdots + \frac{1}{r_1!\cdots(r_n - 1)!}(m - n)(r_1 + \cdots + r_n - 2)!\\[8pt]
    = {} &amp; \frac{1}{r_1!\cdots r_n!}\left[r_1(m - 1) + \cdots + r_n(m-n)\right]\left[r_1 + \cdots + r_n - 2\right]!\\[8pt]
    = {} &amp; \frac{1}{r_1!\cdots r_n!}\left[m(r_1 + \cdots + r_n) - m\right]\left[r_1 + \cdots + r_n - 2\right]!\\[8pt]
    = {} &amp; \frac{m(r_1 + \cdots + r_n - 1)!}{r_1!\cdots r_n!}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Expressing power sums in terms of complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials ===

Finally one may use the variant identities involving complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials similarly to express power sums in term of them:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  p_1 &amp;= + h_1,\\
  p_2 &amp;= - h_1^2 + 2 h_2,\\
  p_3 &amp;= + h_1^3 - 3 h_2 h_1 + 3 h_3,\\
  p_4 &amp;= - h_1^4 + 4 h_2 h_1^2 - 4 h_3 h_1 - 2 h_2^2 + 4 h_4,\\
  p_5 &amp;= + h_1^5 - 5 h_2 h_1^3 + 5 h_2^2 h_1 + 5 h_3 h_1^2 - 5 h_3h_2 - 5 h_4 h_1 + 5 h_5,\\
  p_6 &amp;= - h_1^6 + 6 h_2 h_1^4 - 9 h_2^2 h_1^2 - 6 h_3 h_1^3 + 2 h_2^3 + 12 h_3 h_2 h_1 + 6 h_4 h_1^2 - 3 h_3^2 - 6 h_4 h_2 - 6 h_1 h_5 + 6h_6,\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and so on. Apart from the replacement of each ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; by the corresponding ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, the only change with respect to the previous family of identities is in the signs of the terms, which in this case depend just on the number of factors present: the sign of the monomial &lt;math&gt;\Pi_{i=1}^l h_i^{m_i}&lt;/math&gt; is −(−1)&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+''m''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;+…&lt;/sup&gt;. In particular the above description of the absolute value of the coefficients applies here as well.

The general formula (for all non-negative integers ''m'') is:
:&lt;math&gt;p_m = -\sum_{r_1 + 2r_2 + \cdots + mr_m = m \atop r_1\ge 0, \ldots, r_m \ge 0} \frac{m(r_1 + r_2 + \cdots + r_m - 1)!}{r_1!r_2!\cdots r_m!} \prod_{i=1}^m (-h_i)^{r_i}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Expressions as determinants ===

One can obtain explicit formulas for the above expressions in the form of determinants, by considering the first ''n'' of Newton's identities (or it counterparts for the complete homogeneous polynomials) as linear equations in which the elementary symmetric functions are known and the power sums are unknowns (or vice versa), and apply [[Cramer's rule]] to find the solution for the final unknown. For instance taking Newton's identities in the form 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
   e_1 &amp;= 1p_1,\\
  2e_2 &amp;= e_1p_1 - 1p_2,\\
  3e_3 &amp;= e_2p_1 - e_1p_2 + 1p_3,\\
       &amp; \,\,\,\vdots \\
  ne_n &amp;= e_{n-1}p_1 - e_{n-2} p_2 + \cdots + (-1)^ne_1p_{n - 1} + (-1)^{n - 1}p_n\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

we consider &lt;math&gt;p_1, -p_2, p_3, \ldots, (-1)^np_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_n&lt;/math&gt; as unknowns, and solve for the final one, giving
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  p_n ={} &amp;\begin{vmatrix}
    1         &amp;   0    &amp; \cdots &amp;        &amp; e_1 \\
    e_1       &amp;   1    &amp; 0      &amp; \cdots &amp; 2e_2 \\
    e_2       &amp; e_1    &amp; 1      &amp;        &amp; 3e_3 \\
    \vdots    &amp;        &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots\\
    e_{n - 1} &amp; \cdots &amp; e_2    &amp; e_1    &amp; ne_n
  \end{vmatrix}\begin{vmatrix}
        1     &amp; 0      &amp; \cdots &amp; \\
      e_1     &amp; 1      &amp; 0      &amp; \cdots  \\
      e_2     &amp; e_1    &amp; 1      &amp; \\
    \vdots    &amp;        &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots \\
    e_{n - 1} &amp; \cdots &amp; e_2 &amp; e_1 &amp; (-1)^{n-1}
  \end{vmatrix}^{-1} \\[7pt]
  = {(-1)^{n-1}} &amp;\begin{vmatrix}
    1         &amp; 0      &amp; \cdots &amp;        &amp; e_1 \\
    e_1       &amp; 1      &amp; 0      &amp; \cdots &amp; 2e_2 \\
    e_2       &amp; e_1    &amp; 1      &amp;        &amp; 3e_3 \\
    \vdots    &amp;        &amp; \ddots &amp;\ddots  &amp; \vdots \\
    e_{n - 1} &amp; \cdots &amp; e_2    &amp; e_1    &amp; ne_n
  \end{vmatrix} \\[7pt]
  ={} &amp;\begin{vmatrix}
    e_1    &amp; 1         &amp; 0      &amp; \cdots          \\
    2e_2   &amp; e_1       &amp; 1      &amp; 0      &amp; \cdots \\
    3e_3   &amp; e_2       &amp; e_1    &amp; 1               \\
    \vdots &amp;           &amp;        &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots \\
    ne_n   &amp; e_{n - 1} &amp; \cdots &amp;        &amp; e_1
  \end{vmatrix}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for &lt;math&gt;e_n&lt;/math&gt; instead of for &lt;math&gt;p_n&lt;/math&gt; is similar, as the analogous computations for the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials; in each case the details are slightly messier than the final results, which are (Macdonald 1979, p.&amp;nbsp;20):
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  e_n = \frac1{n!}&amp;\begin{vmatrix}
    p_1     &amp; 1       &amp; 0      &amp; \cdots       \\
    p_2     &amp; p_1     &amp; 2      &amp; 0      &amp; \cdots \\
    \vdots  &amp;         &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots       \\
    p_{n-1} &amp; p_{n-2} &amp; \cdots &amp; p_1    &amp; n-1 \\
    p_n     &amp; p_{n-1} &amp; \cdots &amp; p_2    &amp; p_1
  \end{vmatrix} \\[7pt]
  p_n  = (-1)^{n-1}&amp;\begin{vmatrix}
    h_1    &amp; 1       &amp; 0      &amp; \cdots          \\
    2h_2   &amp; h_1     &amp; 1      &amp; 0      &amp; \cdots \\
    3h_3   &amp; h_2     &amp; h_1    &amp; 1               \\
    \vdots &amp;         &amp;        &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots  \\
    nh_n   &amp; h_{n-1} &amp; \cdots &amp;        &amp; h_1
  \end{vmatrix} \\[7pt]
  h_n = \frac1{n!}&amp;\begin{vmatrix}
    p_1       &amp; -1      &amp; 0      &amp; \cdots         \\
    p_2       &amp; p_1     &amp; -2     &amp; 0      &amp; \cdots \\
    \vdots    &amp;         &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots         \\
    p_{n - 1} &amp; p_{n-2} &amp; \cdots &amp; p_1    &amp; 1 - n \\
    p_n       &amp; p_{n-1} &amp; \cdots &amp; p_2    &amp; p_1
  \end{vmatrix}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the use of determinants makes that the formula for &lt;math&gt;h_n&lt;/math&gt; has additional minus signs compared to the one for &lt;math&gt;e_n&lt;/math&gt;, while the situation for the expanded form given earlier is opposite. As remarked in (Littlewood 1950, p.&amp;nbsp;84) one can alternatively obtain the formula for &lt;math&gt;h_n&lt;/math&gt; by taking the [[Permanent (mathematics)|permanent]] of the matrix for &lt;math&gt;e_n&lt;/math&gt; instead of the determinant, and more generally an expression for any [[Schur polynomial]] can be obtained by taking the corresponding [[immanant]] of this matrix.

== Derivation of the identities ==

Each of Newton's identities can easily be checked by elementary algebra; however, their validity in general needs a proof. Here are some possible derivations.

=== From the special case ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k'' ===

One can obtain the ''k''-th Newton identity in ''k'' variables by substitution into

: &lt;math&gt; \prod_{i=1}^k (t - x_i) = \sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^{k-i} e_{k-i}(x_1,\ldots,x_k)t^i&lt;/math&gt;

as follows. Substituting ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''t'' gives

:&lt;math&gt;0= \sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^{k-i} e_{k-i}(x_1,\ldots,x_k){x_j}^i \quad\text{for }1\leq j\leq k&lt;/math&gt;

Summing over all ''j'' gives

:&lt;math&gt;0= (-1)^kke_k(x_1,\ldots,x_k)+\sum_{i=1}^k(-1)^{k-i} e_{k-i}(x_1,\ldots,x_k)p_i(x_1,\ldots,x_k),&lt;/math&gt;

where the terms for ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 were taken out of the sum because ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is (usually) not defined. This equation immediately gives the ''k''-th Newton identity in ''k'' variables. Since this is an identity of symmetric polynomials (homogeneous) of degree ''k'', its validity for any number of variables follows from its validity for ''k'' variables. Concretely, the identities in ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''k'' variables can be deduced by setting ''k''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''n'' variables to zero. The ''k''-th Newton identity in ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''k'' variables contains more terms on both sides of the equation than the one in ''k'' variables, but its validity will be assured if the coefficients of any monomial match. Because no individual monomial involves more than ''k'' of the variables, the monomial will survive the substitution of zero for some set of ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''k'' (other) variables, after which the equality of coefficients is one that arises in the ''k''-th Newton identity in ''k'' (suitably chosen) variables.

=== Comparing coefficients in series ===
Another derivation can be obtained by computations in the ring of [[formal power series]] ''R''{{brackets|''t''}},  where ''R'' is '''Z'''[''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;], the [[Polynomial ring#The polynomial ring in several variables|ring of polynomials]] in ''n'' variables ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; over the integers.

Starting again from the basic relation

: &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i=1}^n (t - x_i) = \sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^{k} a_k t^{n-k}&lt;/math&gt;

and "reversing the polynomials" by substituting 1/''t'' for ''t'' and then multiplying both sides by ''t''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to remove negative powers of ''t'', gives

: &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i=1}^n (1- x_it) = \sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^{k} a_k t^k.&lt;/math&gt;

(the above computation should be performed in the [[field of fractions]] of ''R''{{brackets|''t''}}; alternatively, the identity can be obtained simply by evaluating the product on the left side)

Swapping sides and expressing the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; as the elementary symmetric polynomials they stand for gives the identity

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^{k} e_k(x_1,\ldots,x_n) t^k=\prod_{i=1}^n (1- x_it).&lt;/math&gt;

One [[Formal derivative|formally differentiates]] both sides with respect to ''t'', and then (for convenience) multiplies by ''t'', to obtain

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^{k}k e_k(x_1,\ldots,x_n) t^k 
    &amp;=      t \sum_{i=1}^n \left[(-x_i) \prod\nolimits_{j \neq i}(1 - x_jt)\right]\\
    &amp;= -\left(\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_it}{1 - x_it}\right) \prod\nolimits_{j=1}^n (1 - x_jt)\\
    &amp;= -\left[\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^\infty(x_it)^j\right]\left[\sum_{\ell=0}^n (-1)^\ell e_\ell(x_1,\ldots,x_n) t^\ell\right]\\
    &amp;=  \left[\sum_{j=1}^\infty p_j(x_1, \ldots, x_n)t^j\right] \left[\sum_{\ell=0}^n (-1)^{\ell - 1} e_\ell(x_1, \ldots, x_n) t^\ell\right],\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where the polynomial on the right hand side was first rewritten as a [[rational function]] in order to be able to factor out a product out of the summation, then the fraction in the summand was developed as a series in ''t'', using the formula
 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{X}{1 -  X} =  X + X^2 + X^3 + X^4 + X^5 + \cdots,&lt;/math&gt;

and finally the coefficient of each ''t''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt; was collected, giving a power sum. (The series in ''t'' is a formal power series, but may alternatively be thought of as a series expansion for ''t'' sufficiently close to 0, for those more comfortable with that; in fact one is not interested in the function here, but only in the coefficients of the series.) Comparing coefficients of ''t''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; on both sides one obtains

:&lt;math&gt;(-1)^{k}k e_k(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = \sum_{j=1}^k (-1)^{k-j-1} p_j(x_1,\ldots,x_n)e_{k-j}(x_1,\ldots,x_n),&lt;/math&gt;

which gives the ''k''-th Newton identity.

=== As a telescopic sum of symmetric function identities ===
The following derivation, given essentially in (Mead, 1992), is formulated in the [[ring of symmetric functions]] for clarity (all identities are independent of the number of variables). Fix some ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0, and define the symmetric function ''r''(''i'') for 2&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''i''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''k'' as the sum of all distinct [[monomial]]s of degree ''k'' obtained by multiplying one variable raised to the power&amp;nbsp;''i'' with ''k''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''i'' distinct other variables (this is the [[monomial symmetric polynomial|monomial symmetric function]] ''m''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt; where γ is a hook shape (''i'',1,1,…,1)). In particular ''r''(''k'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;; for ''r''(1) the description would amount to that of ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, but this case was excluded since here monomials no longer have any distinguished variable. All products ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''e''&lt;sub&gt;''k''−''i''&lt;/sub&gt; can be expressed in terms of the ''r''(''j'') with the first and last case being somewhat special. One has
:&lt;math&gt;p_ie_{k-i}=r(i)+r(i+1)\quad\text{for }1&lt;i&lt;k&lt;/math&gt;
since each product of terms on the left involving distinct variables contributes to ''r''(''i''), while those where the variable from ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; already occurs among the variables of the term from ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''k''−''i''&lt;/sub&gt; contributes to ''r''(''i''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1), and all terms on the right are so obtained exactly once. For ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k'' one multiplies by ''e''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, giving trivially
:&lt;math&gt;p_ke_0=p_k=r(k).&lt;/math&gt;
Finally the product ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''e''&lt;sub&gt;''k''−1&lt;/sub&gt; for ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 gives contributions to ''r''(''i''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''r''(2) like for other values ''i''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''k'', but the remaining contributions produce ''k'' times each monomial of ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, since any one of the variables may come from the factor ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;; thus
:&lt;math&gt;p_1e_{k-1}=ke_k+r(2).&lt;/math&gt;
The ''k''-th Newton identity is now obtained by taking the alternating sum of these equations, in which all terms of the form ''r''(''i'') cancel out.

=== Combinatorial Proof ===
A short combinatorial proof of Newton's Identities is given in (Zeilberger, 1984)&lt;ref name=Zeilberger_1984&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zeilberger|first1=Doron |title=A Combinatorial Proof of Newton's Identities|journal=Discrete Mathematics|date=1984|volume=49|pages=319|doi=10.1016/0012-365X(84)90171-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The red parabolic cylinder corresponds to σ=2, whereas the yellow parabolic cylinder corresponds to τ=1.  The blue plane corresponds to ''z''=2.  These surfaces intersect at the point '''P''' (shown as a black sphere), which has [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] roughly (2, -1.5, 2).]]

In [[mathematics]], '''parabolic cylindrical coordinates''' are a three-dimensional [[orthogonal coordinates|orthogonal]] [[coordinate system]] that results from projecting the two-dimensional [[parabolic coordinates|parabolic coordinate system]] in the
perpendicular &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-direction.  Hence, the [[Coordinate system#Coordinate surface|coordinate surfaces]] are [[confocal]] [[parabola|parabolic]] cylinders. Parabolic cylindrical coordinates have found many applications, e.g., the [[potential theory]] of edges.

==Basic definition==

[[File:Parabolic coords.svg|thumb|right|250px|Parabolic coordinate system showing curves of constant &amp;sigma; and &amp;tau; the horizontal and vertical axes are the x and y coordinates respectively. These coordinates are projected along the z-axis, and so this diagram will hold for any value of the z coordinate.]]

The parabolic cylindrical coordinates {{math|(''σ'', ''τ'', ''z'')}} are defined in terms of the [[Cartesian coordinates]] {{math|(''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}} by:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}

x &amp;= \sigma \tau \\
y &amp;= \frac{1}{2} \left( \tau^2 - \sigma^2 \right) \\
z &amp;= z
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The surfaces of constant {{math|''σ''}} form confocal parabolic cylinders

:&lt;math&gt;
2 y = \frac{x^2}{\sigma^2} - \sigma^2
&lt;/math&gt;

that open towards {{math|+''y''}}, whereas the surfaces of constant {{math|''τ''}} form confocal parabolic cylinders

:&lt;math&gt;
2 y = -\frac{x^2}{\tau^2} + \tau^2
&lt;/math&gt;

that open in the opposite direction, i.e., towards {{math|−''y''}}.  The foci of all these parabolic cylinders are located along the line defined by {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''y'' {{=}} 0}}.  The radius {{math|''r''}} has a simple formula as well

:&lt;math&gt;
r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \sigma^2 + \tau^2 \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

that proves useful in solving the [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation]] in parabolic coordinates for the [[inverse-square law|inverse-square]] [[central force]] problem of [[mechanics]]; for further details, see the [[Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector]] article.

==Scale factors==

The scale factors for the parabolic cylindrical coordinates {{math|''σ''}} and {{math|''τ''}} are:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
h_\sigma &amp;= h_\tau = \sqrt{\sigma^2 + \tau^2} \\
h_z &amp;= 1
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Differential elements==

The infinitesimal element of volume is

:&lt;math&gt;dV = h_\sigma h_\tau h_z d\sigma d\tau dz = ( \sigma^2 + \tau^2 ) d\sigma \, d\tau \, dz 
&lt;/math&gt;

The differential displacement is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{l} = \sqrt{\sigma^2 + \tau^2} \, d\sigma \, \boldsymbol{\hat{\sigma}} + \sqrt{\sigma^2 + \tau^2} \, d\tau \, \boldsymbol{\hat{\tau}} + dz \, \mathbf{\hat{z}}&lt;/math&gt;

The differential normal area is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{S} = \sqrt{\sigma^2 + \tau^2}       \, d\tau   \, dz  \boldsymbol{\hat{\sigma}} + \sqrt{\sigma^2 + \tau^2}       \, d\sigma \, dz    \boldsymbol{\hat{\tau}} + \left(\sigma^2 + \tau^2\right) \, d\sigma \, d\tau \mathbf{\hat{z}}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Del==

Let {{math|''f''}} be a scalar field.  The [[gradient]] is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla f = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\sigma^{2} + \tau^{2}}} {\partial f \over \partial \sigma}\boldsymbol{\hat{\sigma}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{\sigma^{2} + \tau^{2}}} {\partial f \over \partial \tau}\boldsymbol{\hat{\tau}} + {\partial f \over \partial z}\mathbf{\hat{z}}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Laplacian]] is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 f = \frac{1}{\sigma^{2} + \tau^{2}}
\left(\frac{\partial^{2} f}{\partial \sigma^{2}} +
\frac{\partial^{2} f}{\partial \tau^{2}} \right) +
\frac{\partial^{2} f}{\partial z^{2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Let {{math|'''A'''}} be a vector field of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf A = A_\sigma \boldsymbol{\hat{\sigma}} + A_\tau \boldsymbol{\hat{\tau}} + A_\varphi \mathbf{\hat{z}}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[divergence]] is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf A = \frac{1}{\sigma^{2} + \tau^{2}}\left({\partial (\sqrt{\sigma^2+\tau^2} A_\sigma) \over \partial \sigma} + {\partial (\sqrt{\sigma^2+\tau^2} A_\tau) \over \partial \tau}\right) + {\partial A_z \over \partial z}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf A =
  \left(
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{\sigma^2 + \tau^2}} \frac{\partial A_z}{\partial \tau}
  - \frac{\partial A_\tau}{\partial z}
  \right) \boldsymbol{\hat{\sigma}}
- \left(
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{\sigma^2 + \tau^2}} \frac{\partial A_z}{\partial \sigma}
  - \frac{\partial A_\sigma}{\partial z}
  \right) \boldsymbol{\hat{\tau}}
+ \frac{1}{\sigma^2 + \tau^2} \left(
    \frac{\partial \left(\sqrt{\sigma^2 + \tau^2} A_\sigma \right)}{\partial \tau}
  - \frac{\partial \left(\sqrt{\sigma^2 + \tau^2} A_\tau \right)}{\partial \sigma}
  \right) \mathbf{\hat{z}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Other differential operators can be expressed in the coordinates {{math|(''σ'', ''τ'')}} by substituting the scale factors into the general formulae found in [[orthogonal coordinates]].

==Relationship to other coordinate systems==

Relationship to [[cylindrical coordinate]]s {{math|(''ρ'', ''φ'', ''z'')}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\rho\cos\varphi &amp;= \sigma \tau\\
\rho\sin\varphi &amp;= \frac{1}{2} \left( \tau^2 - \sigma^2 \right) \\
z &amp;= z \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Parabolic unit vectors expressed in terms of Cartesian unit vectors:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{\hat{\sigma}} &amp;= \frac{\tau \hat{\mathbf x} - \sigma \hat{\mathbf y}}{\sqrt{\tau^2+\sigma^2}} \\
\boldsymbol{\hat{\tau}} &amp;= \frac{\sigma \hat{\mathbf x} + \tau \hat{\mathbf y}}{\sqrt{\tau^2+\sigma^2}} \\
\mathbf{\hat{z}} &amp;= \mathbf{\hat{z}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== Parabolic cylinder harmonics ==

Since all of the surfaces of constant {{math|''σ''}}, {{math|''τ''}} and {{math|''z''}} are [[conicoid]]s, Laplace's equation is separable in parabolic cylindrical coordinates. Using the technique of the [[separation of variables]], a separated solution to Laplace's equation may be written:

:&lt;math&gt;V = S(\sigma) T(\tau) Z(z)&lt;/math&gt;

and Laplace's equation, divided by {{math|''V''}}, is written:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sigma^2 + \tau^2} \left[\frac{\ddot{S}}{S} + \frac{\ddot{T}}{T}\right] + \frac{\ddot{Z}}{Z} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Since the {{math|''Z''}} equation is separate from the rest, we may write

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\ddot{Z}}{Z}=-m^2&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''m''}} is constant. {{math|''Z''(''z'')}} has the solution:

:&lt;math&gt;Z_m(z)=A_1\,e^{imz}+A_2\,e^{-imz}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting {{math|−''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} for &lt;math&gt;\ddot{Z} / Z&lt;/math&gt;, Laplace's equation may now be written:

:&lt;math&gt;\left[\frac{\ddot{S}}{S} + \frac{\ddot{T}}{T}\right] = m^2 (\sigma^2 + \tau^2)&lt;/math&gt;

We may now separate the {{math|''S''}} and {{math|''T''}} functions and introduce another constant {{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} to obtain:

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{S} - (m^2\sigma^2 + n^2) S = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{T} - (m^2\tau^2 - n^2) T = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The solutions to these equations are the [[parabolic cylinder functions]]

:&lt;math&gt;S_{mn}(\sigma) = A_3 y_1(n^2 / 2m, \sigma \sqrt{2m}) + A_4 y_2(n^2 / 2m, \sigma \sqrt{2m})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T_{mn}(\tau)   = A_5 y_1(n^2 / 2m, i \tau \sqrt{2m}) + A_6 y_2(n^2 / 2m, i \tau \sqrt{2m})&lt;/math&gt;

The parabolic cylinder harmonics for {{math|(''m'', ''n'')}} are now the product of the solutions. The combination will reduce the number of constants and the general solution to Laplace's equation may be written:

:&lt;math&gt;V(\sigma, \tau, z) = \sum_{m, n} A_{mn} S_{mn} T_{mn} Z_m&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==

The classic applications of parabolic cylindrical coordinates are in solving [[partial differential equations]], e.g., [[Laplace's equation]] or the [[Helmholtz equation]], for which such coordinates allow a [[separation of variables]].  A typical example would be the [[electric field]] surrounding a flat semi-infinite conducting plate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3793">In [[mathematics]], the '''Poincaré–Bendixson theorem''' is a statement about the long-term behaviour of [[orbit (dynamics)|orbit]]s of [[continuous dynamical system]]s on the plane, cylinder, or two-sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Earl A. |last=Coddington |authorlink=Earl A.

==Theorem==
Given a [[differentiable real dynamical system]] defined on an [[open set|open]] subset of the plane, then every [[non-empty]] [[compact space|compact]] [[ω-limit set|''ω''-limit set]] of an [[orbit (dynamics)|orbit]], which contains only finitely many fixed points, is either&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Teschl| given = Gerald|authorlink=Gerald Teschl| title = Ordinary Differential Equations and Dynamical Systems| publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]]| place = [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]]| year = 2012| isbn= 978-0-8218-8328-0| url = http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~gerald/ftp/book-ode/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a [[Critical point (mathematics)|fixed point]],
* a [[periodic orbit]], or
* a [[connected set]] composed of a finite number of fixed points together with [[homoclinic orbit|homoclinic]] and [[heteroclinic orbit|heteroclinic]] orbits connecting these.

Moreover, there is at most one orbit connecting different fixed points in the same direction. However, there could be countably many homoclinic orbits connecting one fixed point.

A weaker version of the theorem was originally conceived by [[Henri Poincaré]], although he lacked a complete proof which was later given by  {{harvs|txt|first=Ivar |last= Bendixson|authorlink=Ivar Otto Bendixson|year=1901}}.

== Discussion ==
The condition that the dynamical system be on the plane is necessary to the theorem. On a [[torus]], for example, it is possible to have a recurrent non-periodic orbit.&lt;ref name=dheedene&gt;{{cite journal |last=D'Heedene |first=R.N. |date=1961 |title=A third order autonomous differential equation with almost periodic solutions |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022247X61900592 |journal=[[Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications]] |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=344–350 |doi=10.1016/0022-247X(61)90059-2 |access-date=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In particular, [[chaos theory|chaotic]] behaviour can only arise in continuous dynamical systems whose phase space has three or more dimensions. However the theorem does not apply to [[discrete dynamical system]]s, where chaotic behaviour can arise in two- or even one-dimensional systems.

==Applications==
One important implication is that a two-dimensional continuous dynamical system cannot give rise to a [[strange attractor]]. If a strange attractor '''C''' did exist in such a system, then it could be enclosed in a closed and bounded subset of the phase space. By making this subset small enough, any nearby stationary points could be excluded. But then the Poincaré–Bendixson theorem says that '''C''' is not a strange attractor at all—it is either a [[limit cycle]] or it converges to a limit cycle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3810">In [[mathematics]], '''pointwise convergence''' is one of various senses in which a [[sequence]] of functions can [[Limit (mathematics)|converge]] to a particular function. It is weaker than [[uniform convergence]], to which it is often compared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Rudin | first=Walter | authorlink = Walter Rudin | title=Principles of Mathematical Analysis | publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] | year=1976 | isbn=0-07-054235-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Munkres | first=James R. | authorlink=James Munkres | title=Topology | edition=2nd | publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] | year=2000 | isbn=0-13-181629-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Suppose &lt;math&gt;(f_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of [[function (mathematics)|functions]] sharing the same domain and [[codomain]]. The codomain  is most commonly the [[real number|reals]], but in general can be any [[metric space]]. The sequence &lt;math&gt;(f_n)&lt;/math&gt; '''converges pointwise''' to the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, often written as

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}f_n=f\  \mbox{pointwise},&lt;/math&gt;

if and only if

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}f_n(x)=f(x).&lt;/math&gt;

for every ''x'' in the domain. The function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is said to be the pointwise limit function of &lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt;.

==Properties==
This concept is often contrasted with [[uniform convergence]].  To say that

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}f_n=f\  \mbox{uniformly}&lt;/math&gt;

means that

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\,\sup\{\,\left|f_n(x)-f(x)\right|: x\in\mbox{the domain}\,\}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

That is a stronger statement than the assertion of pointwise convergence: every uniformly convergent sequence is pointwise convergent, to the same limiting function, but some pointwise convergent sequences are not uniformly convergent.  For example, if &lt;math&gt;f_n:[0,1)\rightarrow[0,1)&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of functions defined by &lt;math&gt;f_n(x)=x^n&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} f_n(x)=0&lt;/math&gt; pointwise on the interval [0,1), but not uniformly.

The pointwise limit of a sequence of continuous functions may be a discontinuous function, but only if the convergence is not uniform. For example,

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \cos (\pi x)^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;

takes the value 1 when ''x'' is an integer and 0 when ''x'' is not an integer, and so is discontinuous at every integer.

The values of the functions ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; need not be real numbers, but may be in any [[topological space]], in order that the concept of pointwise convergence make sense.  Uniform convergence, on the other hand, does not make sense for functions taking values in topological spaces generally, but makes sense for functions taking values in [[metric space]]s, and, more generally, in [[uniform space]]s.

==Topology==
Pointwise convergence is the same as convergence in the [[product topology]] on the space ''Y''&lt;sup&gt;''X''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''X'' is the domain and ''Y'' is the codomain.  If the codomain ''Y'' is [[compact set|compact]], then, by [[Tychonoff's theorem]], the space ''Y''&lt;sup&gt;''X''&lt;/sup&gt; is also compact.

==Almost everywhere convergence==
In [[measure theory]], one talks about ''almost everywhere convergence''  of a sequence of [[measurable function]]s defined on a [[measurable space]]. That means pointwise convergence [[almost everywhere]], i.e. on a subset of the domain whose complement has measure zero. [[Egorov's theorem]] states that pointwise convergence almost everywhere on a set of finite measure implies uniform convergence on a slightly smaller set.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2554">In [[proof theory]], '''proof nets''' are a geometrical method of representing proofs that
eliminates  two forms of ''bureaucracy'' that differentiates proofs: (A) irrelevant syntactical features of regular proof calculi such as the [[natural deduction]] calculus and the [[sequent calculus]], and (B) the order of rules applied in a derivation.  In this way, the formal properties of proof identity correspond more closely to the intuitively desirable properties.  Proof nets were introduced by [[Jean-Yves Girard]].

For instance, these two [[linear logic]] proofs are “morally” identical:

{| style="margin:0.5em auto"
|-
| style="text-align: center; padding-right: 40px" |
{| border="0"
|-
| {{math|{{tee}} &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;, &lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;, &lt;VAR&gt;C&lt;/VAR&gt;, &lt;VAR&gt;D&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|-
| style="border-top:2px solid black;" |
|-
| {{math|{{tee}} &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt; ⅋ &lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;, &lt;VAR&gt;C&lt;/VAR&gt;, &lt;VAR&gt;D&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|-
| style="border-top:2px solid black;" |
|-
| {{math|{{tee}} &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt; ⅋ &lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;, &lt;VAR&gt;C&lt;/VAR&gt; ⅋ &lt;VAR&gt;D&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|}
| style="text-align: center;" |
{| border="0"
|-
| {{math|{{tee}} &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;, &lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;, &lt;VAR&gt;C&lt;/VAR&gt;, &lt;VAR&gt;D&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|-
| style="border-top:2px solid black;" |
|-
| {{math|{{tee}} &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt;, &lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;, &lt;VAR&gt;C&lt;/VAR&gt; ⅋ &lt;VAR&gt;D&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|-
| style="border-top:2px solid black;" |
|-
| {{math|{{tee}} &lt;VAR&gt;A&lt;/VAR&gt; ⅋ &lt;VAR&gt;B&lt;/VAR&gt;, &lt;VAR&gt;C&lt;/VAR&gt; ⅋ &lt;VAR&gt;D&lt;/VAR&gt;}}
|}
|}

And their corresponding nets will be the same.

== Correctness criteria ==
Several correctness criteria are known to check if a sequential proof structure (i.e. something which seems to be a proof net) is actually a concrete proof structure (i.e. something which encodes a valid derivation in linear logic). The first such criterion is the [[long-trip criterion]]&lt;ref&gt;Girard, Jean-Yves. ''[http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/~girard/linear.pdf Linear logic]'', Theoretical Computer Science, Vol 50, no 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–102, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; which was described by [[Jean-Yves Girard]].

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Proof that {{mvar|e}} is irrational}}
The [[e (mathematical constant)|number ''e'']] was introduced by [[Jacob Bernoulli]] in 1683. More than half a century later, [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]], who had been a student of Jacob's younger brother [[Johann Bernoulli|Johann]], proved that ''e'' is [[Irrational number|irrational]]; that is, that it cannot be expressed as the quotient of two integers.

==Euler's proof==
Euler wrote the first proof of the fact that ''e'' is irrational in 1737 (but the text was only published seven years later).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Euler | first = Leonhard | year = 1744 | title = De fractionibus continuis dissertatio | url = http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/docs/originals/E071.pdf | journal = Commentarii academiae scientiarum Petropolitanae | volume = 9 | pages = 98–137 |trans-title=A dissertation on continued fractions}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Euler | first = Leonhard | title = An essay on continued fractions | journal = Mathematical Systems Theory | volume = 18 | pages = 295–398 | url = https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/handle/1811/32133 | publication-date = 1985 | doi=10.1007/bf01699475}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Sandifer | first1 = C. Edward | title = How Euler did it | chapter = Chapter 32: Who proved ''e'' is irrational? | publisher = [[Mathematical Association of America]] | pages = 185–190 | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-88385-563-8 | lccn = 2007927658}}&lt;/ref&gt; He computed the representation of ''e'' as a [[simple continued fraction]], which is

:&lt;math&gt;e = [2; 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, \ldots, 2n, 1, 1, \ldots]. &lt;/math&gt;

Since this continued fraction is infinite and every rational number has a terminating continued fraction, ''e'' is irrational. A short proof of the previous equality is known.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0601660.pdf A Short Proof of the Simple Continued Fraction Expansion of e]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Cohn | first = Henry | journal = [[American Mathematical Monthly]] | volume = 113 | issue = 1 | pages = 57–62 | publisher = [[Mathematical Association of America]] | year = 2006 | title = A short proof of the simple continued fraction expansion of ''e'' | jstor = 27641837 | doi=10.2307/27641837}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the simple continued fraction of ''e'' is not [[Periodic continued fraction|periodic]], this also proves that ''e'' is not a root of second degree polynomial with rational coefficients; in particular, ''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is irrational.

==Fourier's proof==
The most well-known proof is [[Joseph Fourier]]'s [[proof by contradiction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = de Stainville | first1 = Janot | year = 1815 | title = Mélanges d'Analyse Algébrique et de Géométrie |trans-title=A mixture of Algebraic Analysis and Geometry | publisher = Veuve Courcier | pages = 340–341}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is based upon the equality

: &lt;math&gt;e = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!}\cdot&lt;/math&gt;

Initially ''e'' is assumed to be a rational number of the form &lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;.  Note that ''b'' could not be equal to 1 as ''e'' is not an integer. It can be shown using the above equality that ''e'' is strictly between 2 and 3:

:&lt;math&gt;2 = 1 + \tfrac{1}{1!} &lt; e = 1 + \tfrac{1}{1!} + \tfrac{1}{2!} + \tfrac{1}{3!} + \cdots &lt; 1 +  \left (1 + \tfrac{1}{2} + \tfrac{1}{2^2} + \tfrac{1}{2^3} + \cdots \right ) = 3.&lt;/math&gt;

We then analyze a blown-up difference ''x'' of the series representing ''e'' and its strictly smaller {{nowrap|''b''&lt;sup&gt; th&lt;/sup&gt;}} partial sum, which approximates the limiting value ''e''.  By choosing the magnifying factor to be the [[factorial]] of&amp;nbsp;''b'', the fraction &lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; and the {{nowrap|''b''&lt;sup&gt; th&lt;/sup&gt;}} partial sum are turned into [[integer]]s, hence ''x'' must be a positive integer. However, the fast convergence of the series representation implies that the magnified approximation error  ''x'' is still strictly smaller than&amp;nbsp;1. From this contradiction we deduce that ''e'' is irrational.

Suppose that ''e'' is a [[rational number]]. Then there exist positive integers ''a'' and ''b'' such that ''e''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;. Define the number

:&lt;math&gt;x = b!\left(e - \sum_{n = 0}^{b} \frac{1}{n!}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

To see that if ''e'' is rational, then ''x'' is an integer, substitute ''e'' = &lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; into this definition to obtain

:&lt;math&gt;x = b!\left (\frac{a}{b} - \sum_{n = 0}^{b} \frac{1}{n!}\right) = a(b - 1)! - \sum_{n = 0}^{b} \frac{b!}{n!}.&lt;/math&gt;

The first term is an integer, and every fraction in the sum is actually an integer because ''n''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''b'' for each term. Therefore, ''x'' is an integer.

We now prove that {{nowrap|0 &lt; ''x'' &lt; 1}}. First, to prove that ''x'' is strictly positive, we insert the above series representation of ''e'' into the definition of ''x'' and obtain

:&lt;math&gt;x = b!\left(\sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!} - \sum_{n = 0}^{b} \frac{1}{n!}\right) = \sum_{n = b+1}^{\infty} \frac{b!}{n!}&gt;0,&lt;/math&gt;

because all the terms are strictly positive.

We now prove that ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1. For all terms with {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ ''b'' + 1}} we have the upper estimate

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{b!}{n!} =\frac1{(b+1)(b+2)\cdots(b+(n-b))} &lt;\frac1{(b+1)^{n-b}}.&lt;/math&gt;

This inequality is strict for every ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2. Changing the index of summation to ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;''b'' and using the formula for the [[Geometric series#Infinite geometric series|infinite geometric series]], we obtain

:&lt;math&gt; x =\sum_{n = b+1}^\infty \frac{b!}{n!}
&lt; \sum_{n=b+1}^\infty \frac1{(b+1)^{n-b}}
=\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac1{(b+1)^k}
=\frac{1}{b+1} \left (\frac1{1-\frac1{b+1}}\right )
= \frac{1}{b} \le 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Since there is no integer strictly between 0 and 1, we have reached a contradiction, and so ''e'' must be irrational. [[Q.E.D.]]

==Alternate proofs==
Another proof&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = MacDivitt | first1 = A. R. G. | last2 = Yanagisawa | first2 = Yukio | title = An elementary proof that ''e'' is irrational | journal = [[The Mathematical Gazette]] | volume = 71 | issue = 457 | pages = 217 | year = 1987 | publisher =[[Mathematical Association]] | place = London | jstor = 3616765 | doi=10.2307/3616765}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be obtained from the previous one by noting that

:&lt;math&gt;(b+1)x=1+\frac1{b+2}+\frac1{(b+2)(b+3)}+\cdots&lt;1+\frac1{b+1}+\frac1{(b+1)(b+2)}+\cdots=1+x,&lt;/math&gt;

and this inequality is equivalent to the assertion that ''bx''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1. This is impossible, of course, since ''b'' and ''x'' are natural numbers.

Still another proof &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Penesi | first = L. L. | year = 1953 | title = Elementary proof that ''e'' is irrational | journal = [[American Mathematical Monthly]] | publisher = [[Mathematical Association of America]] | volume = 60 | issue = 7 | pages = 474 | jstor = 2308411 | doi = 10.2307/2308411 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Apostol, T. (1974). Mathematical analysis (2nd ed., Addison-Wesley series in mathematics). Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt; can be obtained from the fact that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{e} =e^{-1}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{(-1)^n}{n!}\cdot&lt;/math&gt;

Define &lt;math&gt;s_{n}&lt;/math&gt; as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;s_{n}=\sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{(-1)^{k}}{k!}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then:

:&lt;math&gt; e^{-1}-s_{2n-1}=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k}}{k!} -\sum_{k=0}^{2n-1} \frac{(-1)^{k}}{k!} &lt;\frac{1}{(2n)!},&lt;/math&gt;

which implies:

:&lt;math&gt; 0&lt;(2n-1)! \left (e^{-1}-s_{2n-1} \right ) &lt; \frac{1}{2n} \leq \frac{1}{2} &lt;/math&gt; 

for any integer &lt;math&gt;n \geq 2.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that &lt;math&gt;(2n-1)!s_{2n-1}&lt;/math&gt; is always an integer. Assume &lt;math&gt;e^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is rational, so, &lt;math&gt;e^{-1}=\tfrac{p}{q}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;p, q&lt;/math&gt; are co-prime and &lt;math&gt;q \neq 0.&lt;/math&gt; It's possible to appropriately choose &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;(2n-1)!e^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is an integer i.e. &lt;math&gt;n \geq \tfrac{q+1}{2}.&lt;/math&gt; Hence, for this choice, the difference between &lt;math&gt;(2n-1)!e^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(2n-1)!s_{2n-1}&lt;/math&gt; would be an integer. But from the above inequality, that's impossible.So, &lt;math&gt;e^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is irrational. This means that &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is irrational.

==Generalizations==
In 1840, [[Joseph Liouville|Liouville]] published a proof of the fact that ''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is irrational&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Liouville | first = Joseph | journal = [[Journal de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées]] | title = Sur l'irrationalité du nombre ''e'' = 2,718… | series = 1 | volume = 5 | pages = 192 | year = 1840 | language = french}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a proof that ''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is not a root of a second degree polynomial with rational coefficients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Liouville | first = Joseph | journal = [[Journal de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées]] | title = Addition à la note sur l'irrationnalité du nombre ''e'' | series = 1 | volume = 5 | pages = 193–194 | year = 1840 | language = french}}&lt;/ref&gt; This last fact implies that ''e''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; is irrational. His proofs are similar to Fourier's proof of the irrationality of ''e''. In 1891, [[Adolf Hurwitz|Hurwitz]] explained how it is possible to prove along the same line of ideas that ''e'' is not a root of a third degree polynomial with rational coefficients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hurwitz | first1 = Adolf | year = 1933 | origyear = 1891 | title = Mathematische Werke | volume = 2 | language = german | chapter = Über die Kettenbruchentwicklung der Zahl ''e'' | publisher = [[Birkhäuser]] | location = Basel | pages = 129–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, ''e''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is irrational.

More generally, ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt; is irrational for any non-zero rational ''q''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Aigner | first1=Martin | author1-link = Martin Aigner | last2=Ziegler | first2=Günter M. | author2-link=Günter M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1657">In [[descriptive complexity]], a '''query''' is a mapping from structures of one [[signature (logic)|signature]] to structures of another vocabulary.  [[Neil Immerman]], in his book Descriptive Complexity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/853271745|title=Descriptive Complexity|last=Neil.|first=Immerman,|date=1999|publisher=Springer New York|isbn=9781461205395|location=New York, NY|oclc=853271745}}&lt;/ref&gt;, "use[s] the concept of query as the fundamental paradigm of computation" (p. 17).

Given signatures &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, we define the set of [[structure (mathematical logic)|structure]]s on each language, &lt;math&gt;\mbox{STRUC}[\sigma]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mbox{STRUC}[\tau]&lt;/math&gt;.  A query is then any mapping
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;math&gt;I : \mbox{STRUC}[\sigma] \to \mbox{STRUC}[\tau]&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Computational complexity theory]] can then be phrased in terms of the power of the mathematical logic necessary to express a given query.

==Order-independent queries==

A query is '''order-independent''' if the ordering of objects in the structure does not affect the results of the query.  In databases, these queries correspond to [[generic query|generic queries]] (Immerman 1999, p. 18).&lt;!-- This isn't a great reference for this information, since it's in the "background" section.  A reference that goes into more detail would be great.  --&gt;  A query is order-independent iff &lt;math&gt; I(\mathfrak{A}) \equiv I(\mathfrak{B})&lt;/math&gt; for any isomorphic structures &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

==History==

The formula was published by [[Stephen O. Rice]] in 1944,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rice |first=S. O.|authorlink=Stephen O. Rice|year=1944 |title=Mathematical analysis of random noise |journal=Bell System Tech. J. | volume=23| pages=282–332 |url=http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/bstj/vol23-1944/articles/bstj23-3-282.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; having previously been discussed in his 1936 note entitled "Singing Transmission Lines."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rainal | first1 = A. J. | title = Origin of Rice's formula | doi = 10.1109/18.21276 | journal = IEEE Transactions on Information Theory | volume = 34 | issue = 6 | pages = 1383–1387 | year = 1988 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Borovkov | first1 = K. | last2 = Last | first2 = G. | doi = 10.1239/jap/1339878791 | title = On Rice's formula for stationary multivariate piecewise smooth processes | journal = Journal of Applied Probability | volume = 49 | issue = 2 | pages = 351 | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = | arxiv = 1009.3885 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formula==

Write ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt; for the number of times the ergodic stationary stochastic process ''x''(''t'') takes the value ''u'' in a unit of time (i.e. ''t''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;[0,1]). Then Rice's formula states that

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbb E(D_u) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty |x'|p(u,x') \, \mathrm{d}x'&lt;/math&gt;

where ''p''(''x'',''x''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;) is the joint probability density of the ''x''(''t'') and its mean-square derivative ''x'''(''t'').&lt;ref name="barnett"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Zero-Crossings of Random Processes with Application to Estimation Detection | first = J. T. |last = Barnett | title=Nonuniform Sampling: Theory and Practice | editor-first=Farokh A.| editor-last= Marvasti|publisher= Springer | year = 2001 | isbn = 0306464454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the process ''x''(''t'') is a [[Gaussian process]] and ''u''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 then the formula simplifies significantly to give&lt;ref name="barnett" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ylvisaker | first1 = N.

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbb E(D_0) = \frac{1}{\pi} \sqrt{-\rho''(0)}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''ρ''&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; is the second derivative of the normalised autocorrelation of ''x''(''t'') at 0.

==Uses==

Rice's formula can be used to approximate an [[excursion probability]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first1=Robert J. |last1= Adler |first2= Jonathan E. |last2=Taylor| doi = 10.1007/978-0-387-48116-6_4 | chapter = Excursion Probabilities | title = Random Fields and Geometry | series = Springer Monographs in Mathematics | pages = 75–76 | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-387-48112-8 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbb P \left\{ \sup_{t\in[0,1]} X(t) \geq u \right\}&lt;/math&gt;
as for large values of ''u'' the probability that there is a level crossing is approximately the probability of reaching that level.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11668">'''Signed zero''' is [[zero]] with an associated [[Plus and minus signs|sign]]. In ordinary arithmetic, the number 0 does not have a sign, so that −0, +0 and 0 are identical. However, in [[computing]], some number representations allow for the existence of two zeros, often denoted by '''−0''' ('''negative zero''') and '''+0''' ('''positive zero'''), regarded as equal by the numerical comparison operations but with possible different behaviors in particular operations. This occurs in the ''sign and magnitude'' and ''ones' complement'' [[signed number representation]]s for integers, and in most [[floating-point number]] representations. The number 0 is usually encoded as +0, but can be represented by either +0 or −0.

The [[IEEE 754]] standard for floating-point arithmetic (presently used by most computers and programming languages that support floating point numbers) requires both +0 and −0. Real arithmetic with signed zeros can be considered a variant of the [[extended real number line]] such that 1/−0 = −[[infinity|∞]] and 1/+0 = +∞; [[Division (mathematics)|division]] is only [[Indeterminate form|undefined]] for [[Plus-minus sign|±]]0/±0 and ±∞/±∞.

Negatively signed zero echoes the [[mathematical analysis]] concept of approaching 0 from below as a [[one-sided limit]], which may be denoted by ''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;0&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, ''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;0−, or ''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;↑0.  The notation "−0" may be used informally to denote a small negative number that has been [[rounding|rounded]] to zero.  The concept of negative zero also has some theoretical applications in [[statistical mechanics]] and other disciplines.

It is claimed that the inclusion of signed zero in IEEE&amp;nbsp;754 makes it much easier to achieve numerical accuracy in some critical problems,&lt;ref&gt;[[William Kahan]], "Branch Cuts for Complex Elementary Functions, or Much Ado About Nothing's Sign Bit", in [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=59678 ''The State of the Art in Numerical Analysis''] (eds. Iserles and Powell), Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; in particular when computing with [[complex number|complex]] elementary functions.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Kahan]], [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/Math185/Derivative.pdf Derivatives in the Complex z-plane], p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the concept of signed zero runs contrary to the general assumption made in most mathematical fields that negative zero is the same thing as zero.  Representations that allow negative zero can be a source of errors in programs, if software developers do not take into account that while the two zero representations behave as equal under numeric comparisons, they yield different results in some operations.

==Representations==
The widely used [[two's complement]] encoding does not allow a negative zero.  In a 1+7-bit [[signed magnitude|sign-and-magnitude]] representation for integers, negative zero is represented by the bit string {{gaps|1000|0000}}. In an 8-bit [[one's complement]] representation, negative zero is represented by the bit string {{gaps|1111|1111}}. In all three encodings, positive zero is represented by {{gaps|0000|0000}}.

[[Image:IEEE 754 Single Negative Zero.svg|thumb|right|400px|Negative zero by IEEE 754 representation in [[binary32]] ]]
In [[IEEE floating-point standard|IEEE 754]] binary floating point numbers, zero values are represented by the biased exponent and [[significand]] both being zero. Negative zero has the sign bit set to one.  One may obtain negative zero as the result of certain computations, for instance as the result of [[arithmetic underflow]] on a negative number, or &lt;code&gt;−1.0×0.0&lt;/code&gt;, or simply as &lt;code&gt;−0.0&lt;/code&gt;.

In [[IEEE 754-2008|IEEE 754]] decimal floating point encoding, a negative zero is represented by an exponent being any valid exponent in the range for the encoding, the true significand being zero, and the sign bit being one.

==Properties and handling==
The IEEE 754 floating point standard specifies the behavior of positive zero and negative zero under various operations.  The outcome may depend on the current [[floating point#Rounding modes|IEEE rounding mode]] settings.

===Notation===
In systems that include both signed and unsigned zeros, the notation &lt;math&gt;0^+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0^-&lt;/math&gt; is sometimes used for signed zeros.

===Arithmetic===
Addition and multiplication are commutative, but there are some special rules that have to be followed, which mean the usual mathematical rules for algebraic simplification may not apply. The &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt; sign below shows the signed result of the operations.

The usual rule for signs is always followed when multiplying or dividing:

* &lt;math&gt;\frac{-0}{ \left| x \right| } = -0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; different from 0)
* &lt;math&gt;(-0) \cdot (-0) = +0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

There are special rules for adding or subtracting signed zero:

* &lt;math&gt;x + (\pm 0) = x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; different from 0)
* &lt;math&gt;(-0) + (-0) = (-0) - (+0) = -0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(+0) + (+0) = (+0) - (-0) = +0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;x - x = x + (-x) = +0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (for any finite &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, −0 when rounding toward negative)

Because of negative zero (and also when the rounding mode is upward or downward), the expressions {{nowrap|−(''x'' − ''y'')}} and {{nowrap|(−''x'') − (−''y'')}}, for floating-point variables ''x'' and ''y'', cannot be replaced by {{nowrap|''y'' − ''x''}}. However {{nowrap|(−0) + ''x''}} can be replaced by ''x'' with rounding to nearest (except when ''x'' can be a [[NaN#Signaling NaN|signaling NaN]]).

Some other special rules:

* &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-0} = -0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speleotrove.com/decimal/daops.html#refsqrt|title=Decimal Arithmetic: Arithmetic operations{{snd}}square-root|first=Mike|last=Cowlishaw|authorlink=Mike Cowlishaw|date=7 April 2009|publisher=speleotrove.com ([[IBM Corporation]])|accessdate=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{-0}{-\infty} = +0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;  (follows the sign rule for division)
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{\left|x\right|}{-0} = -\infty\,\!&lt;/math&gt;  (for non-zero &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, follows the sign rule for division)
* &lt;math&gt;{\pm 0} \times {\pm \infty} = \mbox{NaN}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; ([[Not a Number]] or interrupt for [[indeterminate form]])
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pm 0}{\pm 0} = \mbox{NaN}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Division of a non-zero number by zero sets the divide by zero [[flag (computing)|flag]], and an operation producing a NaN sets the invalid operation flag. An [[exception handling|exception handler]] is called if enabled for the corresponding flag.

===Comparisons===
According to the IEEE&amp;nbsp;754 standard, negative zero and positive zero should compare as equal with the usual (numerical) comparison operators, like the &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; operators of [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Java programming language|Java]].  In those languages, special programming tricks may be needed to distinguish the two values:

* [[Type punning]] the number to an integer type, so as to look at the sign bit in the bit pattern;
* using the ISO C &lt;code&gt;copysign()&lt;/code&gt; function (IEEE&amp;nbsp;754 copySign operation) to copy the sign of the zero to some non-zero number;
* using the ISO C &lt;code&gt;signbit()&lt;/code&gt; macro (IEEE&amp;nbsp;754 isSignMinus operation) that returns whether the sign bit of a number is set;
* taking the reciprocal of the zero to obtain either 1/(+0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+∞ or 1/(−0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−∞ (if the [[division by zero]] exception is not trapped).

Note: [[Cast (computer programming)|Casting]] to integral type will not always work, especially on two's complement systems.

However, some programming languages may provide alternative comparison operators that do distinguish the two zeros. This is the case, for example, of the &lt;tt&gt;equals&lt;/tt&gt; method in Java's &lt;code&gt;Double&lt;/code&gt; wrapper class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Double.html#equals%28java.lang.Object%29 http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Double.html#equals(java.lang.Object)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific uses==
Informally, one may use the notation "−0" for a negative value that was rounded to zero.  This notation may be useful when a negative sign is significant; for example, when tabulating [[Celsius]] temperatures, where a negative sign means ''below freezing''.

In statistical mechanics, one sometimes uses [[negative temperature]]s to describe systems with [[population inversion]], which can be considered to have a temperature greater than positive infinity, because the coefficient of energy in the population distribution function is &amp;minus;1/Temperature. In this context, a temperature of &amp;minus;0 is a (theoretical) temperature larger than any other negative temperature, corresponding to the (theoretical) maximum conceivable extent of population inversion, the opposite extreme to +0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Charles Kittel|Kittel, Charles]] and [[Herbert Kroemer]] | title=Thermal Physics (2nd ed.) | publisher=W. H. Freeman Company | year=1980 | isbn=0-7167-1088-9|page=462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27983">In mathematics, the '''uniformization theorem'''  says that every [[simply connected]] [[Riemann surface]] is [[Conformal equivalence|conformally equivalent]] to one of three Riemann surfaces: the open [[unit disk]], the [[complex plane]], or the [[Riemann sphere]]. In particular it implies that every Riemann surface admits a [[Riemannian metric]] of [[constant curvature]]. For compact Riemann surfaces, those with universal cover the unit disk are precisely the hyperbolic surfaces of genus greater than 1, all with non-abelian fundamental group; those with universal cover the complex plane are the Riemann surfaces of genus 1, namely the complex tori or [[elliptic curve]]s with fundamental group {{math|'''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}; and those with universal cover the Riemann sphere are those of genus zero, namely the Riemann sphere itself, with trivial fundamental group.

The uniformization theorem is a generalization of the [[Riemann mapping theorem]] from proper simply connected [[open set|open]] [[subset]]s of the plane to arbitrary simply connected Riemann surfaces. The uniformization theorem also has an equivalent statement in terms of closed Riemannian 2-manifolds: each such manifold has a conformally equivalent Riemannian metric with constant curvature.

Many classical proofs of the uniformization theorem rely on constructing a real-valued [[harmonic function]] on the simply connected Riemann surface, possibly with a singularity at one or two points and often corresponding to a form of [[Green's function]]. Four methods of constructing the harmonic function are widely employed: the [[Perron method]]; the [[Schwarz alternating method]]; [[Dirichlet's principle]]; and [[Hermann Weyl|Weyl]]'s method of orthogonal projection. In the context of closed Riemannian 2-manifolds, several modern proofs invoke nonlinear differential equations on the space of conformally equivalent metrics. These include the [[Beltrami equation]] from [[Teichmüller theory]] and an equivalent formulation in terms of [[harmonic map]]s; [[Liouville's equation]], already studied by Poincaré; and [[Ricci flow]] along with other nonlinear flows.

==History==

Felix {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Felix Klein|last=Klein|year=1883}} and Henri {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Henri Poincaré|last=Poincaré|year1=1882}} conjectured the uniformization theorem for (the Riemann surfaces of) algebraic curves. {{harvs|txt|first=Henri |last=Poincaré|year1=1883}} extended this to arbitrary multivalued analytic functions and gave informal arguments in its favor.  The first rigorous proofs of the general uniformization theorem were given by  {{Harvs|txt|last=Poincaré|authorlink=Henri Poincaré|year=1907}} and {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Paul Koebe|first=Paul |last=Koebe|year1=1907a|year2=1907b|year3=1907c}}. Paul Koebe later gave several more proofs and generalizations. The history is described in {{harvtxt|Gray|1994}}; a complete account of uniformization up to the 1907 papers of Koebe and Poincaré is given with detailed proofs in {{harvtxt|de Saint-Gervais|2016}} (the [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]]-type pseudonym of the group of fifteen mathematicians who jointly produced this publication).

==Classification of compact Riemann surfaces==

Every [[Riemann surface]] is the quotient of a free, proper and holomorphic action of a [[discrete group]] on its universal covering and this universal covering is holomorphically isomorphic (one also says: "conformally equivalent" or "biholomorphic") to one of the following:

#the [[Riemann sphere]]
#the complex plane
#the unit disk in the complex plane.

[[Radó's theorem (Riemann surfaces)|Rado's theorem]] shows that every Riemann surface is automatically [[second-countable space|second-countable]]. Although Rado's theorem is often used in proofs of the uniformization theorem, some proofs have been formulated so that Rado's theorem becomes a consequence. Second countability is automatic for compact Riemann surfaces.

==Classification of closed oriented Riemannian 2-manifolds==
On an oriented 2-manifold, a [[Riemannian metric]] induces a complex structure using the passage to [[isothermal coordinates]]. If the Riemannian metric is given locally as

:&lt;math&gt; ds^2 = E \, dx^2 + 2F \, dx \, dy + G \, dy^2,&lt;/math&gt;

then in the complex coordinate ''z'' = ''x'' + i''y'', it takes the form

:&lt;math&gt; ds^2 = \lambda| \, dz +\mu \, d\overline{z}|^2,&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt; \lambda={1\over 4} \left( E + G +2\sqrt{EG -F^2} \right), \,\,\, \mu=(E - G + 2iF)/4\lambda,&lt;/math&gt;

so that ''λ'' and ''μ'' are smooth with ''λ'' &gt; 0 and |''μ''| &lt; 1. In isothermal coordinates (''u'', ''v'') the metric should take the form

:&lt;math&gt; ds^2 = \rho (du^2 + dv^2)&lt;/math&gt;

with ''ρ'' &gt; 0 smooth. The complex coordinate ''w'' = ''u'' + i ''v'' satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;\rho \, |dw|^2 = \rho |w_z|^2 \left| dz + {w_{\overline {z}}\over w_z} \, d\overline{z}\right|^2,&lt;/math&gt;

so that the coordinates (''u'', ''v'') will be isothermal locally provided the [[Beltrami equation]]

:&lt;math&gt; {\partial w\over \partial \overline{z}} = \mu {\partial w\over \partial z}&lt;/math&gt;

has a locally diffeomorphic solution, i.e. a solution with non-vanishing Jacobian.

These conditions can be phrased equivalently in terms of the [[exterior derivative]] and the [[Hodge star operator]] {{math|∗}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|DeTurck|Kazdan|1981}}; {{harvnb|Taylor|1996|pp=377&amp;ndash;378}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{math|''u''}} and {{math|''v''}} will be isothermal coordinates if {{math|1=∗''du'' = ''dv''}}, where {{math|∗}} is defined
on differentials by {{math|1=∗(''p'' ''dx'' + ''q'' ''dy'') = −''q'' ''dx'' + ''p'' ''dy''}}.
Let {{math|1=∆ = ∗''d''∗''d''}} be the [[Laplace&amp;ndash;Beltrami operator]]. By standard elliptic theory, {{math|''u''}} can be chosen to be [[harmonic]] near a given point, i.e. {{math|1=Δ ''u'' = 0}},  with {{math|''du''}} non-vanishing. By the [[Poincaré lemma]] {{math|1= ''dv'' = ∗''du''}} has a local solution {{math|''v''}} exactly when {{math|1=''d''(∗''du'') = 0}}. This condition is equivalent to {{math|1=Δ ''u'' = 0}}, so can always be solved locally. Since {{math|''du''}} is non-zero and the square of the Hodge star operator is &amp;minus;1 on 1-forms, {{math|''du''}} and {{math|''dv''}} must be linearly independent, so that {{math|''u''}} and {{math|''v''}} give local isothermal coordinates.

The existence of isothermal coordinates can be proved by other methods, for example using the [[Beltrami equation#Solution in L2 for smooth Beltrami coefficients|general theory of the Beltrami equation]], as in {{harvtxt|Ahlfors|2006}}, or by direct elementary methods, as in {{harvtxt|Chern|1955}} and {{harvtxt|Jost|2006}}.

From this correspondence with compact Riemann surfaces, a classification of closed orientable Riemannian 2-manifolds follows. Each such is conformally equivalent to a unique closed 2-manifold of [[constant curvature]], so a [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient]] of one of the following by a [[Group action|free action]] of a [[discrete group|discrete subgroup]] of an [[isometry group]]:

#the [[sphere]] (curvature +1)
#the [[Euclidean plane]] (curvature 0)
#the [[Hyperbolic space|hyperbolic plane]] (curvature &amp;minus;1).
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Orange Sphere.png|genus 0
File:Orange Torus.png|genus 1
File:Orange Genus 2 Surface.png|genus 2
File:Orange Genus 3 Surface.png|genus 3
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The first case gives the 2-sphere, the unique 2-manifold with constant positive curvature and hence positive [[Euler characteristic]] (equal to 2). The second gives all flat 2-manifolds, i.e. the [[torus|tori]], which have Euler characteristic 0. The third case covers all 2-manifolds of constant negative curvature, i.e. the ''hyperbolic'' 2-manifolds all of which have negative Euler characteristic. The classification is consistent with the [[Gauss–Bonnet theorem]], which implies that for a closed surface with constant curvature, the sign of that curvature must match the sign of the Euler characteristic. The Euler characteristic is equal to 2 – 2''g'', where ''g'' is the genus of the 2-manifold, i.e. the number of "holes".

==Methods of proof==

===Hilbert space methods===
{{See also|Planar Riemann surface#Uniformization theorem}}
In 1913 Hermann Weyl published his classic textbook "Die Idee der Riemannschen Fläche" based on his Göttingen lectures from 1911 to 1912. It was the first book to present the theory of Riemann surfaces in a modern setting and through its three editions has remained influential. Dedicated to [[Felix Klein]], the first edition incorporated [[David Hilbert|Hilbert's]] treatment of the [[Dirichlet problem]] using [[Hilbert space]] techniques; [[L. E. J. Brouwer|Brouwer's]] contributions to topology; and [[Paul Koebe|Koebe's]] proof of the uniformization theorem and its subsequent improvements. Much later {{harvtxt|Weyl|1940}} developed his method of orthogonal projection which gave a streamlined approach to the Dirichlet problem, also based on Hilbert space; that theory, which included [[Weyl's lemma (Laplace equation)|Weyl's lemma]] on [[elliptic regularity]], was related to [[W. V. D. Hodge|Hodge's]] [[Hodge theory|theory of harmonic integrals]]; and both theories were subsumed into the modern theory of [[elliptic operator]]s and {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} [[Sobolev space]]s. In the third edition of his book from 1955, translated into English in {{harvtxt|Weyl|1964}}, Weyl adopted the modern definition of differential manifold, in preference to [[triangulation (topology)|triangulations]], but decided not to make use of his method of orthogonal projection. {{harvtxt|Springer|1957}} followed Weyl's account of the uniformisation theorem, but used the method of orthogonal projection to treat the Dirichlet problem. This approach will be outlined below. {{harvtxt|Kodaira|2007}} describes the approach in Weyl's book and also how to shorten it using the method of orthogonal projection. A related account can be found in {{harvtxt|Donaldson|2011}}.

===Nonlinear flows===
{{see also|Ricci flow#Relationship to uniformization and geometrization}}

In introducing the [[Ricci flow]], [[Richard S. Hamilton]] showed that the Ricci flow on a closed surface uniformizes the metric (i.e., the flow converges to a constant curvature metric).  However, his proof relied on the uniformization theorem. The missing step involved Ricci flow on the 2-sphere: a method for avoiding an appeal to the uniformization theorem (for genus 0) was provided by {{harvtxt|Chen|Lu|Tian|2006}};&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brendle|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a short self-contained account of Ricci flow on the 2-sphere was given in {{harvtxt|Andrews|Bryan|2010}}.

==Generalizations==

Koebe proved the '''general uniformization theorem''' that if a Riemann surface is homeomorphic to an open subset of the complex sphere (or equivalently if every Jordan curve separates it), then it is conformally equivalent to an open subset of the complex sphere.

In 3 dimensions, there are 8 geometries, called the [[Geometrization conjecture#The eight Thurston geometries|eight Thurston geometries]]. Not every 3-manifold admits a geometry, but Thurston's [[geometrization conjecture]] proved by [[Grigori Perelman]] states that every 3-manifold can be cut into pieces that are geometrizable.

The [[simultaneous uniformization theorem]] of [[Lipman Bers]] shows that it is possible to simultaneously uniformize two compact Riemann surfaces of the same genus &gt;1 with the same [[quasi-Fuchsian group]].

The [[measurable Riemann mapping theorem]] shows more generally that the map to an open subset of the complex sphere in the uniformization theorem can be chosen to be a [[quasiconformal map]] with any given bounded measurable Beltrami coefficient.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27720">The '''volume''' (W) and '''displacement''' (Δ) indicators have been discovered by [[Philippe Samyn]] in 1997 to help the search for the optimal geometry of architectural structures.

== The architectural structure ==
A resistant structure is anything amorphous or living, which supports the forces to which it is normally subjected without breaking. 
 
Characterised by its shape and its constituent materials, and three-dimensional by nature, the amorphous structure usually has a two-dimensional geometry, which is given a thickness, or a three-dimensional geometry (the three-dimensional structure). The latter is formed of a pair of two-dimensional structures on non-parallel planes or three-dimensional curved volumes as in the case for any living things, including a specific group: the shells (a three-dimensional surface with a thickness). An example of these is the structure of cars, boats or planes, or even human skulls, sea shells or the stem of a dandelion. 
 
The geometry of most "architectural" structures (such as buildings or bridges) is twodimensional and it is essential to study this aspect, whether for aesthetic, commodity-related or economic reasons. Several criteria are therefore taken into account in its definition.

== Objective ==
The study is limited to the quest of the geometry giving the structure of minimum volume.

The cost of a structure depends on the nature and the quantity of the materials used as well as the tools and human resources required for its production.

Although technological progress has reduced the cost of tools and the amount of human resources required, and despite the fact that computerised calculation tools can now be used to determine the dimension of a structure so that the load it bears at every point is within the admissible limits allowed by its constituent materials, it is also necessary for its geometry to be optimal. It is far from simple to find this optimal point because the choice available is so vast.

Furthermore, the resistance of the structure is not the only criterion to take into account. In many cases, it is also important to ensure that it will not undergo excessive deformation under static loads or that it does not vibrate to inconvenient or dangerous levels when subjected to dynamic loads.

Volume and displacement indocators, W and Δ, discovered by Philippe Samyn in August 1997, are useful tools in this regard. This approach does not take into account phenomena of elastic instability. Indeed, it can be shown that it is always possible to design a structure so that this effect becomes negligible.

== The indicators ==

The objective is to ascertain the optimal morphology for a two-dimensional structure with constant thickness, which:
* fits in a rectangle of pre-determined dimensions, longitudinal L and horizontal H, expressed in metres (m); 
* is made of one (or several) material(s) with a modulus of elasticity E, expressed in Pascals (Pa), and bearing a load at all points within its allowable stress(es) σ, expressed in Pascals (Pa);
* is resistant to the maximum loads to which it is subjected, in the form of a “resultant” F, expressed in Newtons (N).

Each form chosen corresponds to a volume of material V (in m³) and a maximum deformation δ (in m). 
Their calculation depends on the factors L, H, E, σ and F. These calculations are long and tedious, they cloud the objective of finding the optimal form.

It is, nevertheless, possible to overcome this problem by setting each factor to unity: while all other characteristics remain the same. Length L is therefore set to 1m, H to H/L, E and σ to 1Pa, and F to 1N.
This "reduced" structure has a volume of material W= σV/ FL (the volume indicator) and a maximum deformation Δ = Eδ / σL (the displacement indicator). Their main characteristic is that they are numbers without physical dimensions (dimensionless) and their value, for every morphology considered, depends only on the ratio L/H, i.e. the geometric slenderness ratio of the form.

This method can easily be applied to three-dimensional structures as illustrated in the following examples.

The theory related to the indicators has been taught since 2000, and among other institutions, at the department of Civil Engineering and of Architecture at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB ; section "material mechanics and constructions") leading to research and publications under the direction of Prof. Dr. Ir. Philippe Samyn (from 2000 to 2006); Prof. Dr. Ir. Willy Patrick De Wilde (from 2000 to 2011) and now Prof. Dr. Ir. Lincy Pyl.
 
The "reference book",&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Samyn, ''Étude de la morphologie des structures à l’aide des indicateurs de volume et de déplacement'', Académie royale de Belgique, Bruxelles, 2004, 482 p; www.samynandpartners.com (for online e-book), ({{ISBN|2-8031-0201-3}}).&lt;/ref&gt; since the reference thesis,&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Samyn, ''Étude comparée du volume et du déplacement de structures bidimensionnelles, sous charges verticales entre deux appuis vers un outil d'évaluation et de prédimensionnement des structures'', Tome I: Mémoire, 175 p.; Tome II: Annexes, 184 p.; Tome III: Figures, 197 p. (4th of July 1999) ; Tome IV: Epilogue, 33 p. + 14 figures (1st of December 1999). PhD Thesis in Applied Sciences, University of Liège.&lt;/ref&gt; reports the developments of the theory at Samyn and Partners as well as the VUB, up to 2004.

The theory is open to everyone who wants to contribute, W and Δ being to be calculated for any resistant structure as defined in paragraph 1 here above. 
 
Progresses in material sciences, robotics and three dimensional printing, lead to the creation of new structural forms lighter than anyone known today. 
 
The geometry of minimal surfaces of constant thickness in a homogeneous material is, for example, substantially modified when thickness and/or local alloable stress are varying.

== Macrostructure, structural element, microstructure and material ==

The macrostructures considered here may be composed of "structural elements" which material presents a "microstructure".

Whether searching to limit the stress or the deformation, macrostructure, structural element and microstructure have each, a weight ''Vρ'', when ''ρ'' is the volumic weight of materials, in N/m³, function of the sollicitations {''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;} (for "force" in général) applied to them, of their size {''L''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;} (for length or "size" in general) , of their shape {''G&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''} (for geometry or "shape" in general), and of their constituting material {''M&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''} (for "material" in general).
{{clear}}
: &lt;math&gt;V\rho \div \{F_0\}\{L_0\}\{G_e\}\{M_a\}&lt;/math&gt;
{{clear}}
It can also be expressed as shape and material ({''G&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''}{''M&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''}) defining the weight (''Vρ'') for the structure of a given size under given force ({''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}{''L''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}). 
{{clear}}
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{V\rho}{\{F_0\} \{L_0\}} \div \{G_e\} \{M_a\}&lt;/math&gt;
{{clear}}
In material mechanics and for the structural elements under a specific loading case, the factor  {''G&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''} corresponds to the "form factor" for elements of continuous section out of a solid material (without voids).

The constituting material might however present a microstructure with voids. This cellular structure enhances than the form factor, whatever the loading case.

The factor {''M&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''} caracterises a material which efficiency might be compared to another for a given loading case, and the independently of the form factor {''G&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''}.

The indicators ''W'' = ''σV''/''FL'' and Δ = ''δE''/''σL'' just defined, caracterise the macrostructures, while the same notations and symbols in small letters, ''w'' = ''σv''/''fl'' and Δ = ''δE''/''σl'', refer to the structural element.

The figure 1 gives the values of ''W'' and Δ for the structural element subject to traction, compression, bending and shear. The left column relates to the limitation of stress and the right column to the limitation of deformation. It shows the direct relation of ''W'' to {''G&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''}{''M&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''} as:
{{clear}}
: &lt;math&gt;V\rho \div \{F_0\}\{L_0\}\{G_e\}\{M_a\} \div V\sigma \cdot \rho/\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, thus &lt;math&gt;V\sigma \div \{F_0\}\{L_0\}\{G_e\}\{M_a\} \cdot \sigma/\rho .&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;W=\frac{\sigma V}{FL} \div \left[\frac{\{F_0\}} F\right] \left[\frac{\{L_0\}} L \right] \{G_e\}\{M_a\} \frac\sigma\rho,&lt;/math&gt;
or
: &lt;math&gt;W\div\{G_e\}\{M_a\}\sigma/\rho&lt;/math&gt; for given dimensions and loading case.

Then, as ''W'' and Δ depend only on &lt;math&gt;L/H&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;W=\frac{\sigma V}{FL}=\frac{\rho V}{FL}\frac{\sigma}{\rho}&lt;/math&gt;

and:

: &lt;math&gt; W \frac \rho \sigma =\frac{\rho V}{FL} \div \{G_e\} \{M_a\}, &lt;/math&gt;

which for a given loading case, is the specific weight of a macrostructure per unit of force and length, depending only from the geometry through ''L/H'', and the materials though ''σ''/''ρ''.

''Wρ''/''σ'' includes thus, the material factor {''M&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''} (''ρ''/''σ'' and ''ρ''/''E'' for tension and compression without buckling, ''ρ''/''E''&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; for compression limited by buckling, ''ρ''/''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2/3&lt;/sup&gt; and ''ρ''/''E''&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; for pure bending, ''ρ''{{sqrt|3/''σ''}} and ''ρ''/''G'' for pure shear) and the form factor {''G&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''}.

All other factor being equal, a cluster of tubes with a diameter ''H'' and a wall thickness ''e'',  compared to a solid bar of equal volume in a material caracterised by ''ρ'' , ''σ'' , ''E''  et ''G'' , presents an apparent density ''ρ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 4''k''(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k'')''ρ'' with ''k'' = ''e''/''H'', allowable stress  ''σ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 4''k''(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k'')''σ'',

The [[Young's modulus]] is &lt;math&gt;\ E_a=4k(1-k)E&lt;/math&gt; and the [[shear modulus]] is &lt;math&gt;\ G_a=4k(1-k)G&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus

: &lt;math&gt;\ \rho_a/E_a^{1/2}=2\sqrt{k-k^2}\rho/E^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;
and
: &lt;math&gt;\rho_a/\sigma_a^{2/3}=(4k-4k^2)^{1/3}\rho/\sigma^{2/3}&lt;/math&gt;

This explains the better performances of lighter materials for structural elements subject to compression or bending. 
 
This indicator allows to compare the efficiency of macrostructures including geometry and material.

It echos the work of M.F. Ashby: "Materials Selection in Mechanical Design" (1992).&lt;ref&gt;M.F. Ashby, ''Materials Selection in Mechanical Design'', 311 pages, 1997. Butterworth-Heinemann edition, division of Reed Educational and Professional Publishing Ltd. Oxford (first edition in 1992 by Pergamon Press Ltd), UK.&lt;/ref&gt; He analyses {''G&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''} and {''M&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''} separately as, for his studies, {''M&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''} relates to a large amount of the materials physical properties.

Different and complementary, it can also be placed alongside work carried out since 1969 by the Institut Für Leichte Flächentragwerke in Stuttgart under the direction of Frei Otto and now Werner SobekK, which refers to indices named ''Tra'' and ''Bic''.&lt;ref&gt;''Il Publikationen: Institut Für Leichte Flächentragwerke'', Universität Stuttgart, plaffenwaldring, 14, 70569 Stuttgart; (Current director: Prof. Dr. Ir. Werner Sobek). tel 00.49.711.685.35.99 – fax 00.49.711.685.37.89&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Tra'' is defined as the product of the length of the trajectory of the force ''F&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'', (causing the collapse of the structure) onto the supports by the intensity of this force, and the ''Bic'' is the relationship of the mass of the structure with ''Tra''.

Since ''ρ*''  is the density of the material (in kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), and  ''α'' is, like ''W'', a constant depending on the type of structure and the loading case: 

: &lt;math&gt;Bic=\rho^* V/Tra \text{ and } Tra=F_rL/\alpha; &lt;/math&gt;

therefore, with stress &lt;math&gt;\sigma_r&lt;/math&gt; reached under &lt;math&gt;F_r&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;Bic=\alpha\frac{\rho^* V}{F_r L} = \alpha \frac{\rho^*} \sigma \frac{F}{F_r}W&lt;/math&gt;

and as

: &lt;math&gt;\ \frac F {F_r} = \frac \sigma {\sigma_r}\ :\ Bic=\frac{\rho^*}{\sigma_r}\alpha W. &lt;/math&gt;

Unlike ''W'' , which is dimensionless, ''Bic'' is expressed in ''kg/Nm''. Therefore, depending on the material, an independent comparison of different morphologies is not possible. 
It is surprising to note that despite the abundance of their works, none of them mention or make any effort to study ''W'' and its relationship with ''L/H''.

It appears that only V. Quintas Ripoll&lt;ref&gt;Valentin Quintas Ripoll, Pro. Titular Dep. Estructuras de Edificación E.T.S Arquitectura.

== Validity limits of ''W'' and Δ ==

* In general, the second order effects have very little influence on ''W'',  but they can have a significant impact on Δ. ''W'' and Δ therefore also depend on ''E/σ''.

* The shearing force ''T'' may be crucial in the case of short and continuous elements, subject to bending so that ''W'' does not fall below a given value, regardless of the reduction of the slenderness ''L/H''. However, this limitation is very theoretical because it is always possible to remove it by transferring material from the flanges to the web of the section, close to the supports.

* The stress ''σ'' to which the structure can be subjected depends on the nature, the internal geometry, the production method and the implementation of the materials, as well as several other factors, including the dimensional accuracy of the actual construction, the nature of the connections of the components or their fire resistance, but also the skill with which the geometry of the structure is designed to cope with elastic instability. Pierre Latteur,&lt;ref&gt;P. Latteur, ''Optimisation des treillis, arcs, poutres et câbles sur base d'indicateurs morphologiques – Application aux structures soumises en partie ou en totalité au flambement'', Tome I: Thesis, 328 p.; Tome II: Thesis appendix, 12 p.; Tome III: Appendix to chapter 2, 432 p. (May 2000). Ph.D. Thesis in Applied Sciences, Vrije Universiteit Brussel.&lt;/ref&gt; who discovered the buckling indicator, studied the influence of elastic instability on ''W'' and Δ.
In this regard, it is important to note that the existence of anchoring points of an element in traction may reduce the apparent permissible stress to the same level as the reduction necessary to take into account a moderate level of elastic instability. 
The influence on ''W'' of the buckling of the compressed parts on one side and of the anchoring points at the extremities of an element in traction on the other side is analysed on pages 30 to 58 in the « reference book ».

* The allowable stress ''σ'' is also often reduced by the need to limit the displacement ''δ'' of the structure since it is not possible to significantly alter ''E'' for a given material.

* Considerations regarding fatigue, ductility and dynamic forces also limit the working stress.

* It is not always straightforward to establish the nature and the overall maximum intensity of the forces ''F''(including dead weight) to which the structure is subject, which again has a direct influence on the working stress.

* The connections of an element in compression or in traction are considered as hinged. Any clamping, even partial ones, introduce parasitic forces which add extra weight to the structure.

* For certain types of the structures, the volume of the connections adds to the net volume defined by ''W''. Its importance depends on the nature of the material and the context in which it is used; this needs to be determined on a case-by-case basis. 
It follows that initially, only ''W'' and Δ should be taken into account for the morphological design of a structure, assuming that it is ultra-dampened (i.e. its internal damping is greater than the critical damping), which makes it impervious to dynamic stress. 
The volume ''V'' of a structure is therefore directly proportional to the total intensity of the force ''F'' which is applied to it, to its length ''L'' and to the morphological factor ''W''; it is inversely proportional to the stress ''σ'' to which it can be subjected. Furthermore, the weight of a structure is proportional to the density ''ρ'' of the material from which it is constructed. However, its maximum displacement ''δ'' remains proportional to the span ''L'' and the morphological factor Δ, as well as the ratio between its working stress ''σ'' and the modulus of elasticity ''E''.

If it is a case of limiting the weight (or the volume) and the deformation of a structure for a given stress ''F'' and span ''L'', with all other aspects remaining unchanged, then the work of the structural engineer involves minimising ''W'' and ''ρ/σ'' on one side and Δ and ''σ/E'' ont the other.

== Accuracy of ''W'' and Δ ==

=== Theoretical accuracy ===
For the large majority of compressed elements, it is possible to limit the reduction of the working stress to 25% by taking into account elastic instability, providing that the designer focuses on ensuring an efficient geometric design from as early as the initial sketches. This means that the increase in their volume indicator can also be limited to 25% . The volume of the elements subject to pure traction is also only very rarely limited to the product of the net distance over which a force is applied by a section strained at the permissible stress. In other words, their real volume indicator is thus also higher than the one which results from the calculation of ''W''.  A bar under traction can be welded at its extremities; no extra material apart from the negligible welding material is added, but the rigidity introduce parasitic moments which absorb some of the permissible stress.

The bar can be articulated at its extremities and work at its permissible stress, but this requires close end sockets or attachment mechanisms whose volume is far from negligible, especially if the bar is short or highly stressed. As L.H. Cox demonstrated,&lt;ref&gt;L.H. Cox, ''The design of structures of least weight'', 135 p., 1965, Pergamon Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt; in this case, it is worth taking into account ''n'' bars each with a cross-section of Ω/''n'', strained by force ''F/n'' with 2''n'' sockets, instead of one bar with a cross-section Ω strained by a force ''F'' with 2 sockets, since the total volume of 2''n'' sockets in the first case is much less than that of 2 sockets in the second.

The anchoring of the extremities of a bar under traction can also be ensured by adherence, as is usually the case for the rebars in elements made of reinforced concrete. In this specific case, it is necessary to have an anchoring length at least 30 times the diameter of the bar. The bar then has a length ''L''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;60''H'' for a useful length ''L''; its theoretical volume indicator ''W'' = 1 becomes ''W'' = 1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;60''H''/''L''. Consequently, ''L''/''H'' must be greater than 240 (which is always theoretically possible) so that ''W'' does not increase by more than 25%. This observation also helps to show another reason for taking into account n bars with a crosssection Ω/''n'' instead of one bar with a cross-section&amp;nbsp;Ω.

Finally, connections consisting of bolts, dowels, pins or nails, especially in the case of wooden components, significantly reduce usable sections. For elements in traction, a reduction of 25% in the working stress or an increase of 25% in the volume is therefore also necessary in the majority of cases. Determining the volume and the displacement of a structure using the indicators ''W'' and Δ is therefore reliable theoretically, providing that:

* the working stress is reduced by at least 25% ;

* de dessiner les éléments comprimés et les assemblages avec discernement.

* great attention is paid to the design of compressed parts and connections. The overall proportions of an optimised structure, without taking buckling into account, are significantly altered when the compressed bars need to be shortened to take account of elastic instability. It becomes sensitive to the scale effect, leading to an extension of the overall proportion and increasing the weight of the structure. Inversely, a shortening of the overall proportions is necessary when the volume of the connections needs to be considered, since the influence of this volume reduces when the bars are lengthened. This shows the advantage of accurately designing not only the compressed parts, but also the connections, in order to avoid these flaws. One of Niki de Saint-Phalle’s light sculptures are therefore preferable to Giacometti’s slender but heavy structures !

=== Practical accuracy ===

The volume of the material of the structure, as determined using ''W'', can only be obtained accurately if the theoretical values of the relevant characteristic of the sections under strain ''σ'' can be measured in practice.
As shown in Figure 1 above, this characteristic is:

* ''Ω'' for an element under pure compression without buckling ;
* ''I'' for an element under pure compression with buckling (as well as for deformation under
pure bending) ;
* ''I''/''H'' for an element under simple bending.

It is always possible to obtain the precise value of these characteristics when the parts are made of moulded materials, such as reinforced concrete, or squared-off materials, such as wood or stone. However, this is not the case for laminated or extruded materials, produced on an industrial production line, such as steel or aluminium. It is important therefore to produce these elements with the smallest possible difference in size between two of them in order to avoid an unnecessary use of material. This use is consistent when the related deviation ''c'' between two successive values ''k&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; is constant, thus (''k''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) / ''k&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''c'' or ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = (''c''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) ''k&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = {{math|(''c''+1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} ''k''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

This is the principle of the geometric series known as the Renard Series (named after Colonel Renard who was the first to use them in calculating the diameter of cabling on aircraft) featured in the French standard NF X01-002.&lt;ref&gt;French National Association for Standardisation (Association Française de Normalisation/AFNOR), ''NFX 01-002  Guide pour le choix des séries de nombres normaux et des séries comportant des valeurs plus arrondies de nombres normaux'', 6 pages, December 1967, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; When all the necessary values are only very slightly greater than a series value, ''c'' represents the maximum increase and ''c''/2 the average increase of ''W''. Being universally used, the case of the steel profiles requires an in-depth examination (see the “reference book”; page 26 to 29). Consequently, the use of industrial steel profiles automatically leads to a significant increase of ''W'':

* by half of the theoretical inaccuracy for pure compression ;
* practically identical for bending or compression subject to buckling.

This situation is magnified when the number of profiles available is restricted, which may explain the use of forms which are not theoretically optimal but which tend to subject the available profiles to the permissible stress ''σ'' (such as, for example, pylons for high-voltage electric lines or variable height truss bridges). For structures subject to pure bending, this also explains the use of flat plates of variable lengths added to the flanges of these ''I'' profiles to obtain the inertia or resisting moment required, with the greatest degree of accuracy. Conversely, the significant variety in the tubes available enables a relative deviation value ''c'' which is both smaller and more constant. They also cover a much wider range in both the lower and higher characteristic values. Since their geometric performance is practically identical to that of the I profiles, tubes are the most appropriate industrial solution in order to practically eliminate any increase in the volume indicator ''W''. Nevertheless, practical issues of availability and corrosion may limit their use.

It is surprising to note that the minimum value is reached for a conical dome of variable thickness with an opening angle of 90° (''L''/''H'' = 2 ; ''W'' = 0,5!).

== Developments ==
Applications discussed in the « reference book » are:
* trusses,
* straight continuous beams,
* arches, cables and guyed structures,
* masts,
* gantries,
* membranes of revolution.

== Some examples of composite structures with minimum W ==
''W'' can easily be determined in order to optimise structures made up of a number of different construction elements (see « reference book » pages 100–106) as shown, for instance, for the wind turbine in Figure 8.
