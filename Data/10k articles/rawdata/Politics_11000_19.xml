The '''2017 United Nations Climate Change Conference''' ("COP23") was an international meeting of political leaders, non-state actors and activists to discuss environmental issues. It was held at [[UN Campus, Bonn|UN Campus]] in [[Bonn]] ([[Germany]]) from 6–17 November 2017.&lt;ref name=Carrington-2017.11.05&gt;Damian Carrington, [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/05/the-cop23-climate-change-summit-in-bonn-and-why-it-matters "The COP23 climate change summit in Bonn and why it matters "], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 5 November 2017 (page visited on 14 November 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The conference incorporated the 23rd [[Conference of the parties|Conference of the Parties]] to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC), the thirteenth meeting of the parties for the [[Kyoto Protocol]] ('''CMP13'''), and the second meeting of the parties for the [[Paris Agreement]] ('''CMA2''').

The purpose of the conference was to discuss and implement plans about combating climate change, including the details of how the [[Paris Agreement]] will work after it enters into force in 2020.&lt;ref name=Carrington-2017.11.05/&gt; The COP was presided over by the Prime Minister of [[Fiji]], [[Frank Bainimarama]], marking the first time a [[Small Island Developing States|small-island developing state]] assumed the presidency of the negotiations. The German government provided considerable support that amounted to more than €117 million ($135.5 million) for the construction of the conference facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/cop23-is-the-bonn-summit-worth-the-trouble/a-41296570|title=COP23: Is the Bonn summit worth the trouble?|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although COP23 focused primarily on technical details of the Paris Agreement, it was the first conference of the parties to take place after President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. would withdraw from the agreement.

COP23 concluded with what was called the 'Fiji Momentum for Implementation,' which outlined the steps that need to be taken in 2018 to make the Paris Agreement operational and launched the [[Talanoa Dialogue]] - a process designed to help countries enhance and implement their [[Intended Nationally Determined Contributions|Nationally Determined Contributions]] by 2020&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://unfccc.int/files/meetings/bonn_nov_2017/application/pdf/cp23_auv_fiji.pdf|title=Fiji Momentum for Implementation-UNFCCC|access-date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
{{See also|United Nations Climate Change conference}}

==Outcomes==

Significant progress was made on the so-called implementation guidelines  for the Paris Agreement – commonly known as the Paris Rulebook – which are the details that will determine how the Agreement will work in practice.&lt;ref name=carbon&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.carbonbrief.org/cop23-key-outcomes-agreed-un-climate-talks-bonn|title=COP23: Key outcomes agreed at the UN climate talks in Bonn|publisher=Carbon Brief|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; COP23 resulted in the Fiji Momentum for Implementation, which reinforced the need for urgent action and increased ambition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://unfccc.int/files/meetings/bonn_nov_2017/application/pdf/cp23_auv_fiji.pdf|title=Fiji Momentum for Implementation-UNFCCC|access-date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parties will need to finalise the Implementation Guidelines at [[COP24]].

At COP23, the Fijian Presidency announced its approach to the Talanoa Dialogue – know formerly as the Facilitative Dialogue. The Talanoa Dialogue is an inclusive and participatory process designed to allow countries to assess the progress made so far toward achieving the long-term of the Paris Agreement, and to help them increase the ambition of their [[Intended Nationally Determined Contributions|Nationally Determined Contributions]] by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/fijian-storytelling-can-save-world-says-un-gxx5t6zmr|title=Fijian storytelling can save world, says UN|publisher=The Times|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Talanoa Dalogue is a precursor to the global stocktakes that will take place every five years, beginning in 2023.

A rift began to emerge between [[Developed country|developed]] and [[Developing country|developing countries]] over pre-2020 action. On the first day of the conference, developing countries, including China and India, asked for an agenda item to discuss this issue, which refers to the emission cuts that developed countries are required to make prior to 2020 under the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. Developed countries resisted this request, arguing that this issue was best discussed in other forums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/environment/developmental-issues/stalemate-over-inclusion-of-pre-2020-issues-in-cop23-agenda-continues/articleshow/61618756.cms|title=Stalemate over inclusion of pre-2020 issues in COP23 agenda continues|publisher=The Economic Times of India|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, Parties agreed to hold additional stocktaking sessions in 2018 and 2019 to review progress on reducing emissions, as well as produce two assessments on climate finance in 2018 and 2020. Several European countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany and Spain, ratified the [[Doha Amendment]] during COP23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&amp;mtdsg_no=XXVII-7-c&amp;chapter=27&amp;clang=_en|title=Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol|publisher=The United Nations|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also during COP23, Syria announced that it would sign the Paris Agreement, leaving the United States as the only country that has rejected the pact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/syria-to-ratify-the-paris-agreement-leaving-the-us-alone/|title=Syria to ratify the Paris agreement, leaving the US alone|publisher=Politico EU|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developed and developing countries also agreed to hold an experts dialogue in 2018 on the controversial issue of loss and damage, which will explore options for mobilising expertise, technology and support for the victims of climate change and will inform the next review of the [[Warsaw International Mechanism]] in 2019.&lt;ref name=carbon /&gt;

Parties reached a historic decision on agriculture after six years of deadlock. The agreement established the ''Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture'' to develop and implement new strategies for mitigation and adaptation the agriculture sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://reliefweb.int/report/world/agriculture-takes-leap-forward-bonn-climate-talks|title=Agriculture takes a leap forward at Bonn Climate Talks|publisher=[[Relief Web]]|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parties also finalized the Gender Action Plan and the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform, both of which are designed to increase the participation of traditionally marginalized groups in the UN Climate Negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sdg.iisd.org/news/cop-23-adopts-decisions-on-adaptation-fund-gender-indigenous-peoples-and-local-communities/|title=COP 23 Adopts Decisions on Adaptation Fund, Gender, Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities|publisher=IISD|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of 30 countries including Britain, Canada and New Zealand launched of the Powering Past Coal Alliance with the aim to phase out coal from power generation by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-17/20-countries-have-signed-up-to-phase-out-coal-power-by-2030/9161056|title=Powering Past Coal Alliance: 20 countries sign up to phase out coal power by 2030|publisher=ABC News |accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.poweringpastcoal.org|title=Powering Past Coal Alliance {{!}} Working towards the global phase-out of coal power|website=Powering Past Coal Alliance|language=en|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate Action Zone==

While the formal negotiations took place in the World Conference Centre Bonn – called the Bula Zone – other non-state actors met in the global climate action zone – the Bonn Zone – located in temporary structures built in Rheinaue Park. The Zone was marked by Fiji’s Bula spirit and highlighted the groundswell of activity and innovation being undertaken by local governments, cities, businesses, investors, civil society, youth activists, and ordinary men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-accord-fiji/in-fiji-on-the-rhine-islanders-stress-climate-risks-idUSKBN1DA243|title=In 'Fiji-on-the-Rhine', islanders stress climate risks|publisher=Reuters |accessdate=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During COP23, the [[German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development]] (BMZ) launched the InsuResilience Global Partnership for Climate and Disaster Risk Finance and Insurance Solutions with the contribution of US$125 million. This aim of this initiative is to bring affordable insurance and other financial protection to millions of vulnerable people around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://reliefweb.int/report/world/insuresilience-provide-poor-more-financial-protection-against-climate-risks|title=‘InsuResilience’ to Provide the Poor with More Financial Protection Against Climate Risks|publisher=Relief Web |accessdate=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A delegation of sub-national leaders, led by Governor Jerry Brown of California and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, travelled to Bonn to present [[America’s Pledge]], which reports ongoing efforts to uphold the ongoing efforts the U.S.’s emissions reduction target, even after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/11/us-groups-honouring-paris-climate-pledges-despite-trump |title=US groups honouring Paris climate pledges despite Trump|publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Separately, Michael Bloomberg used pledged $50 million to expand his anti-coal US campaign into Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-bloomberg/bloomberg-gives-50-million-to-aid-shift-from-coal-worldwide-idUKKBN1D92NT |title=Bloomberg gives $50 million to aid shift from coal worldwide|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fijian COP23 Presidency also launched the Ocean Pathway Partnership, which will be co-chaired by Fiji and Sweden, in an effort the strengthen the link between global warming and the health of the world’s oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/344271/two-fiji-initiatives-pushed-through-at-cop23|title=Two Fiji initiatives pushed through at COP23|publisher=Radio New Zealand|accessdate=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Acorn''' is a farm based, anarchist, [[egalitarian]], [[intentional community]]&lt;ref name=tdp-apart&gt;{{cite web|title=Louisa seed company sets itself apart|url=http://www.dailyprogress.com/news/louisa-seed-company-sets-itself-apart/article_dadfda25-84cb-5867-918d-42ae33e49e09.html?TNNoMobile|website=The Daily Progress|publisher=BH Media Group Holdings, Inc.|accessdate=15 June 2014|ref=tdpa|date=22 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; located in rural [[Louisa County, Virginia|Louisa County]], [[Virginia]], [[United States]], and is a member of the [[Federation of Egalitarian Communities]]. Acorn was started in 1993 as a spin-off community of the older, larger [[Twin Oaks Community]].&lt;ref name="pubpat"&gt;{{cite news|title=Organic Seed v. Monsanto|url=http://www.pubpat.org/monsanto-seed-patents.htm|newspaper=Public Patent Foundation Website|date=Jan 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="richmondmag" /&gt; In the early 1990s the Twin Oaks population swelled to capacity, with there still being many more people who wished to join. The pressure of the large number of people desiring to live in the community encouraged Twin Oaks members to form another community nearby to accommodate more people. This effort resulted in, on a 75 acre farm 7 miles away from Twin Oaks, the formation of Acorn.

==Community==
Group meetings are held weekly and decisions are reached through [[consensus]]. Members share a strong sense of [[environmental awareness]], therefore they strive to live lightly on the land. Although structured in areas such as membership, policies are kept to a minimum; it is preferred that a calm [[anarchy]] prevail. Of the policies that are in place, the culture encourages personal responsibility rather than supervision. The community takes on issues on a case-by-case basis, keeping in mind that needs are varied amongst individuals.

The population and stability of Acorn has fluctuated significantly in its relatively short history.&lt;ref name=artinstitute&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sternfeld|first1=Joel|title=Acorn Community, Mineral, Virginia|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/186172|website=Art Institute of Chicago|accessdate=15 June 2014|ref=aioc|date=April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Financial crisis and interpersonal conflict have brought the community close to an end on a number of occasions. Having survived these difficult times, Acorn is now thriving (2013) as it enjoys a full membership of 30 members (currently its self-imposed maximum number) as well as the presence and participation of provisional members, interns and guests. There is also a waiting list of people who have been approved for membership and are waiting for space to become available.

Acorn supports itself through its non-[[GMO]] [[heirloom seed]] business, [[Southern Exposure Seed Exchange]].&lt;ref name=richmondmag&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robertson|first1=Gary|title=A Cultivated Community|url=http://www.richmondmagazine.com/articles/a-cultivated-community-06-18-2013.html?page=4|website=Richmond Magazine|accessdate=15 June 2014|ref=rmz|page=4|date=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The income from this business is held in common and used to support Acorn's members, as well as a number of other activities (such as maintenance of a fund to support the formation of other cooperative [[egalitarian]] communities). In this vein Acorn purchased a nearby property in 2013, in order to form and support the growth of a new community, which is named Sapling.

All members enjoy full medical, dental and optical care, as well as a monthly stipend.&lt;ref name="tdp-apart" /&gt;

Acorn has a highly flexible self-directed labor system in keeping with its philosophy of non-hierarchy and personal independence coupled with personal responsibility. The work of the seed business is done by a dynamic and flexible collection of members and guests who attend to the necessary work tasks based on the varying needs of the business as well as the abilities and inclinations of the participants. Being non-hierarchical, there are no bosses, owners, investors, managers or supervisors to direct the work. Therefore work occurs with minimal supervision. Priorities are identified, and results achieved, by the input of those participants who have the most insight into what is required for the task to be done; this is coupled with the agreement and assumption of responsibility of the other participants.

==Membership==
The farm works in large part due to the fact that the community carefully chooses who becomes a member by a process called Clearness. After spending three weeks visiting the community, prospective members get "clear" with every single member of the community by meeting individually for in depth conversations. Then all members meet to decide whether or not to accept that person as a provisional member. The decision, like all decisions at Acorn, is made through [[consensus]]. Thus, all members must agree to accept the person as a provisional member. Failing full consensus for acceptance, the applicant is not invited to join.

Once accepted, a person remains a provisional member for one year and then the full members decide whether or not to accept that person into full membership. Provisional membership is a trial membership and that person remains at Acorn so long as that person has the consent of all members to be there. If at any time full consent is withdrawn that person must leave.  Once that person is accepted as a full member, full consensus is required for the community to require that person to leave.

==Diet==
Member of the community rotate cooking responsibilities, though cooking is done mostly by those who are experienced in it.  The generally prepared meals often offer a meat dish, a number vegetarian dishes and maybe a vegan dish if vegans are present. The community raises and cares for chickens for meat and eggs; goats for meat and milk; and pigs for pork.  Two meals per day are prepared by rotating cooks from within the community and most members attend most meals.  The community does not buy factory farmed meat and purchases much of its food organically.  Acorn is also successful in rescuing food which was destined for dumpsters by working with the local food bank on redistributing their surplus produce and by working with food delivery services to rescue their surpluses.

==Community service==
Members of Acorn are involved in various community service activities.  These include Plant a Row (which grows food for local food pantry serving local disadvantaged persons) and [[Food Not Bombs]].  Acorn has also invested some money and considerable labor by volunteering to help two new local egalitarian communities [[Living energy farm|Living Energy Farm]] and Sapling.  The community also supports members who wish to pursue activism, especially as it relates to food safety and blocking the spread of [[GMO|GMOs]] including the [[March Against Monsanto]].

==Labor==
Acorn has a minimum work quota of 42 hours a week, which all adult members are expected to meet.  This is the minimum amount of work deemed acceptable, with most members working well over this amount. This quantity of work may seem excessive to some, but Acorn is a relatively new farm based community with a substantial amount of infrastructure waiting to be built out as well as a rapidly growing business that requires increasing input to meet that growth.

All work done by members is equally creditable. Almost anything that needs to be done is considered work. This includes traditionally recognized work such as office work, maintenance and farming. However, less traditionally recognized work such as [[childcare]], [[cooking]], [[housekeeping|cleaning]] and preparing for communal parties are equally labor creditable. As a result of this system, members feel they have significantly more free time than when they were working regular jobs. Based upon meeting the minimum amount of work expected, members enjoy four weeks of vacation per year. By working over the expected quota members can accumulate additional vacation time.

The labor system at Acorn is quite unstructured.&lt;ref name=huffpost-utopian&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pearson|first1=Catherine|title=Searching For Happiness In 'Utopia'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/24/utopian-communities_n_4906105.html|website=The Huffington Post|publisher=HuffPost News|accessdate=15 June 2014|ref=hpu|date=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this does not mean members simply do whatever they want and call it work. Keeping in mind the needs and goals of the community, as well as engaging in group and individual conversations, members identify and decide on relevant tasks that need to be accomplished. Individuals then step forward to take on the responsibility of accomplishing the work in a timely fashion.

==Monsanto lawsuit==
Acorn, with 82 other farmers and seed businesses, preemptively sued [[Monsanto]] Corporation to protect themselves from predatory lawsuits for [[GMO]] patent infringement. This suit is between [[Organic Seed Growers and Trade Association]] and Monsanto.  This class action suit was litigated by the [[Public Patent Foundation]] in response to Monsanto's multiple lawsuits against farmers who have been contaminated by their GMO seeds.&lt;ref name="pubpat" /&gt;

==Buildings==
Living is communal rather than individuals living in their own houses. Each member is provided with their own bedroom in one of the four living structures.

A new building which will provide much need space for Acorn's growing seed business is under construction (2013).  The building has a significant number of environmentally positive features which include low impact building materials, significant southern exposure, passive ventilation for cooling, timber frame construction technique and desiccant air conditioning for maintaining stored seed temperatures.  The estimated completion is Fall of 2014.

[[File:F-16D ACAT Aircraft.jpg|thumb|upright=1.14|The [[U.S. Air Force]]'s [[F-16]]D Ground Collision Avoidance Technology (GCAT) aircraft.]]

An '''airborne collision avoidance system''' ('''ACAS''', usually pronounced as ''ay-kas'') operates independently of ground-based equipment and [[air traffic control]] in warning pilots of the presence of other aircraft that may present a threat of collision. If the risk of collision is imminent, the system initiates a maneuver that will reduce the risk of collision. ACAS standards and recommended practices are mainly defined in annex 10, volume IV, of the  [[Convention on International Civil Aviation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurocontrol.int/msa/public/standard_page/ACAS_ICAO_Provisions.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421004027/http://www.eurocontrol.int/msa/public/standard_page/ACAS_ICAO_Provisions.html |archivedate=2010-04-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of the technology being applied to both military and general aviation today has been undergoing development by NASA and other partners since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA-Pioneered Automatic Ground-Collision Avoidance System Operational|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/Features/Auto-GCAS_Installed_in_USAF_F-16s.html|website=NASA website|accessdate=8 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinction is increasingly being made between ACAS and ASAS (airborne separation assurance system). ACAS is being used to describe short-range systems intended to prevent actual metal-on-metal collisions. In contrast, ASAS is being used to describe longer-range systems used to maintain standard ''en route'' separation between aircraft ({{convert|5|nmi|km}} horizontal and {{convert|1000|ft}} vertical).&lt;ref name="Free flight with airborne separation assurance" &gt;[Hoekstra, J.M. (2002). Free flight with airborne separation assurance. Report No. NLR-TP-2002-170. National Aerospace Laboratory NLR.]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2009, the only implementations that meets the ACAS II standards set by [[ICAO]] are Versions 7.0 and 7.1 of TCAS II ([[Traffic Collision Avoidance System]]) produced by three manufacturers: [[Rockwell Collins]], [[Honeywell]] and ACSS (Aviation Communication &amp; Surveillance Systems; an [[L-3 Communications]] and [[Thales Group|Thales Avionics]] company).

As of 1973, the United States [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) standard for transponder minimal operational performance, Technical Standard Order (TSO) C74c, contained errors which caused compatibility problems with [[air traffic control radar beacon system]] (ATCRBS) radar and Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) abilities to detect aircraft transponders. First called "The Terra Problem", there have since been individual FAA [[Airworthiness Directive]]s issued against various transponder manufacturers in an attempt to repair the operational deficiencies, to enable newer radars and TCAS systems to operate. Unfortunately, the defect is in the TSO,{{Clarify|date=November 2009}} and the individual corrective actions to transponders have led to significant differences in the logical behavior of transponders by make and mark, as proven by an FAA study of in-situ transponders. In 2009, a new version, TSO C74d&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TSO C74d Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS) Airborne Equipment|url=http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgTSO.nsf/0/15f9a125457291938625752300762aae/$FILE/TSO-C74d.pdf|publisher=Federal Aviation Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; was defined with tighter technical requirements. 

AIS-P is a modification which both corrects the transponder deficiencies (the transponder will respond to all varieties of radar and TCAS), then adds an Automatic Independent Surveillance with Privacy augmentation. The AIS-P protocol does not suffer from the saturation issue in high density traffic, does not interfere with the Air Traffic Control (ATC) radar system or TCAS, and conforms to the internationally approved Mode S data packet standard. It awaits member country submission to the ICAO as a requested approval.

Modern aircraft can use several types of '''collision avoidance systems''' to prevent unintentional contact with other aircraft, obstacles, or the ground:

[[File:Auto-GCAS saves F-16.webm|thumb|left|Footage from the head-up-display of a U.S. Air Force Arizona Air National Guard F-16 records a save by the aircraft’s Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System (Auto-GCAS) during a training mission, the fourth confirmed by the NASA-designed system. From an altitude of just over 17,000 ft, the pilot executes an 8.1g maneuver which causes the pilot to lose consciousness. After the aircraft enters a steepening dive in full afterburner for twenty seconds, Auto-GCAS intervenes with a recovery maneuver at 8,760 ft. 652 kt and nose-down almost 55 deg. below the horizon.]]
* Airborne [[Radar]] can detect the relative location of other aircraft, and has been in military use since [[World War II]], when it was introduced to help night fighters (such as the [[de Havilland Mosquito]] and [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]]) locate bombers.  While larger civil aircraft carry [[weather radar]], sensitive anti-collision radar is rare in non-military aircraft.
* [[Traffic collision avoidance system]] (TCAS), which actively interrogates the [[transponder]]s of other aircraft and negotiates collision-avoidance tactics with them in case of a threat.  TCAS systems are relatively expensive, and tend to appear only on larger aircraft.  They are effective in avoiding collisions only with other aircraft that are equipped with functioning transponders with altitude reporting.
* [[File:PCAS Xrx.jpg|thumb|right|Small PCAS device for use in light aircraft.]]a [[Portable Collision Avoidance System]] (PCAS) is a less expensive, passive version of TCAS designed for [[general aviation]] use.  PCAS systems do not actively interrogate the transponders of other aircraft, but listen passively to responses from other interrogations.  PCAS is subject to the same limitations as TCAS, although the cost for PCAS is significantly less.
* [[FLARM]] is a small-size, low-power device (commonly used in gliders or other light aircraft) which broadcasts its own position and speed vector (as obtained with an integrated GPS) over a license-free ISM band radio transmission. At the same time it listens to other devices based on the same standard. Intelligent motion prediction algorithms predict short-term conflicts and warn the pilot accordingly by acoustical and visual means. FLARM incorporates a high-precision [[Wide Area Augmentation System|WAAS]] 16-channel GPS receiver and an integrated low-power radio transceiver. Static obstacles are included in FLARM's database. No warning is given if an aircraft does not contain an additional FLARM device.
* a [[Ground proximity warning system]] (GPWS), or ''Ground collision warning system'' (GCWS), which uses a [[radar altimeter]] to detect proximity to the ground or unusual descent rates.  GPWS is common on civil airliners and larger [[general aviation]] aircraft.
* a [[Terrain awareness and warning system]] (TAWS) uses a digital terrain map, together with position information from a navigation system such as [[GPS]], to predict whether the aircraft's current flight path could put it in conflict with obstacles such as mountains or high towers, that would not be detected by GPWS (which uses the ground elevation directly beneath the aircraft).  One of the best examples of this type of technology is the Auto-GCAS (Ground Collision Avoidance System) and PARS (Pilot Activated Recovery System) that was installed on the entire USAF fleet of F-16's in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jedick|first1=Rocky|title=Ground Collision Avoidance System|url=http://goflightmedicine.com/gcat/|website=Go Flight Medicine|accessdate=16 Dec 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* [[Synthetic vision]] provides pilots with a computer-generated simulation of their outside environment for use in low or zero-visibility situations. Information used to present warnings is often taken from GPS, INS, or gyroscopic sensors.
* [[Obstacle Collision Avoidance System]] is a ground based system that uses a low powered radar mounted on or near the obstacle. The radar detects aircraft in the proximity of the obstacle and firstly warns aircraft via flashing medium intensity lights and secondly warns aircraft of the obstacle via a VHF broadcast. No additional equipment is required on board the aircraft.
Large, sophisticated aircraft may use several or all of these systems, while a small general aviation aircraft might have only PCAS or benefit from the OCAS system, or no collision-avoidance system at all (other than the pilot's situational awareness).

[[File:All_Writs_Act.ogv|thumb|"The All Writs Act", lecture by [[Jonathan Mayer]]]]
The '''All Writs Act''' is a [[Act of Congress|United States federal statute]], codified at {{UnitedStatesCode|28|1651}}, which authorizes the [[Federal judiciary of the United States|United States federal courts]] to "issue all [[writ]]s necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law."

The act in its original form was part of the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]]. The current form of the act was first passed in 1911&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/topn/A.html|title=TOPN: Table of Popular Names|work=Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the act has been amended several times since then,&lt;ref name="cornell"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1651-|title=28 U.S. Code § 1651 - Writs|work=Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it has not changed significantly in substance since 1789.&lt;ref&gt;Section 14 of the 1789 Act provided that all courts of the United States should "have power to issue writs of scire facias, habeas corpus, and all other writs not specially provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdiction, and agreeable to the principles and usages of law." [http://constitution.findlaw.com/article3/annotation06.html#t220 ''Findlaw''], Power to Issue Writs: The Act of 1789.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Act==
The text of the Act is:&lt;ref name="cornell"/&gt;

{{Quote|(a) The Supreme Court and all courts established by Act of Congress may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.

(b) An alternative writ or [[rule nisi]] may be issued by a justice or judge of a court which has jurisdiction.}}

==Conditions for use==

Application of the All Writs Act requires the fulfillment of four conditions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Portnoi |first=D. D. |url=http://www.nyulawreview.org/sites/default/files/pdf/NYULawReview-83-1-Portnoi.pdf |title=Resorting to Extraordinary Writs: How the All Writs Act Rises to Fill the Gaps in the Rights of Enemy Combatants |work=[[New York University Law Review]] |date=March 19, 2009 |pages=293–322 |accessdate=February 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The absence of alternative remedies—the act is only applicable when other judicial tools are not available.
* An independent basis for jurisdiction—the act authorizes writs in aid of jurisdiction, but does not in itself create any federal subject-matter jurisdiction.
* Necessary or appropriate in aid of jurisdiction—the writ must be necessary or appropriate to the particular case.
* Usages and principles of law—the statute requires courts to issue writs "agreeable to the usages and principles of law".

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] has ruled that federal administrative agencies can invoke the All Writs Act to preserve the status quo when a party within the agency's jurisdiction is about to take action that will prevent or impair the agency from carrying out its functions. In ''[[FTC v. Dean Foods Co.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;384 U.S. 597 (1966).&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court held that a court of appeals to which an appeal could be taken against an FTC order banning a merger could properly issue a preliminary injunction under the All Writs Act while the FTC determined the merger's legality, if the need for injunctive relief was "compelling". In that case the acquired company would cease to exist since the acquiring company was about to sell all acquired milk routes, its plants and equipment, and other assets, precluding its restoration as a viable independent company if the merger were subsequently ruled illegal. This would prevent a meaningful order from being entered in the case. The Court held that the All Writs Act extends to the potential jurisdiction of an appellate court where an appeal is not then pending, but may later be perfected.

In a later similar case, the [[Second Circuit]] denied relief, because an All Writs preliminary injunction should issue only if the FTC can show that "an effective remedial order, once the merger was implemented, would otherwise be virtually impossible, thus rendering the enforcement of any final decree of divestiture futile." The Second Circuit opined that the merger probably violated the antitrust laws but did not believe that effective relief would be "virtually impossible."&lt;ref&gt;''FTC v. PepsiCo, Inc.'', 477 F.2d 24 (2d Cir. 1973).&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court reached a similar result in a later case involving an agency's dismissal of an employee. The reason was that judicial review would not be defeated as in ''Dean Foods''.&lt;ref&gt;''Sampson v. Murray'', 415 U.S. 61, 77-78 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the [[D.C. Circuit]] relied on ''Dean Foods'' as authority for issuance of an All Writs order to compel the FCC to act on a petition that it had allegedly delayed for almost five years without acting on it.&lt;ref&gt;''Telecommunications Research &amp; Action Center v. FCC'', 750 F.2d 70 (D.C. Cir. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in ''[[United States v. New York Telephone Co.]]'' 434 U.S. 159  (1977) that the act provided authority for a U.S. District Court to order a telephone company to assist law enforcement officials in installing a device on a rotary phone in order to track the phone numbers dialed on that phone, which was reasonably believed to be used in furtherance of criminal activity.:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States v. New York Telephone Co. |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2167177984150747977&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=40000006|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Supreme Court of United States|accessdate=February 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

The [[U.S. Government]] has revived the All Writs Act in the 21st century, notably to gain access to password protected [[mobile phone]]s in domestic terrorism and narcotics investigations.

The government has been trying to use the All Writs Act since at least 2008 to force various companies to provide assistance in cracking their customers' phones.  The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] has confirmed at least 76 cases in 22 states where the government applied for an order under the All Writs Act. In addition, Apple has identified 12 pending cases in its court documents, and the ACLU has found one additional case in [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Raymundo |first1=Oscar |date=March 30, 2016 |title=Here's a map of where Apple and Google are fighting the All Writs Act nationwide |website=Macworld |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/3049994/security/heres-a-map-of-where-apple-and-google-are-fighting-the-all-writs-act-nationwide.html |accessdate=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here are some specific examples:

On October 31, 2014, a [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|U.S. District Court in New York]] authorized a writ directing a mobile phone manufacturer, whose identity was not disclosed, to assist an investigation of credit card fraud by bypassing a phone's password screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7012457256018582034 |accessdate=February 29, 2016| website=[[Google Scholar]]| publisher= United States District Court, S.D. New York| title=In Re Order Requiring [XXX], Inc. to Assist in the Execution of a Search Warrant ... by Unlocking a Cell Phone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 3, 2014, the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|Oakland Division of the U.S. Attorney's Office]] named [[Apple Inc.]] in papers invoking the Act, which were filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]]. Federal law enforcement sought to require Apple to extract data from a locked [[iPhone 5S]]&lt;!-- Do not change this to "iPhone 5C": This invocation took place in 2014 and is unrelated to the 2016 FBI–Apple encryption dispute concerning an iPhone 5C. --&gt; as part of a criminal case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Feds want Apple's help to defeat encrypted phones, new legal case shows |url= https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/12/feds-want-apples-help-to-defeat-encrypted-phones-new-legal-case-shows/ |work=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |last=Farivar |first=Cyrus |date=December 1, 2014 |accessdate=February 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |quote=Order requiring Apple, Inc. to assist in the execution of a search warrant |url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1372280-apple-oakland.html |litigants=United States of America v.

On February 16, 2016, the Act was invoked again in an order that Apple Inc. create a special version of its [[iOS]] operating system, with certain security features removed, for Federal law enforcement officers to use as part of an investigation into the [[2015 San Bernardino attack|2015 San Bernardino terrorist attack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |quote=In the matter of the search of an Apple iPhone seized during the execution of a search warrant on a black Lexus IS300, California license plate 35KGD203 |url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2714001-SB-Shooter-Order-Compelling-Apple-Asst-iPhone.html |litigants=United States of America v.

Apple claimed that complying with the order would make [[brute-force attack|brute force password attacks]] trivial for anyone with access to a phone using this software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-wants-apple-to-help-unlock-iphone-used-by-san-bernardino-shooter/2016/02/16/69b903ee-d4d9-11e5-9823-02b905009f99_story.html |title=Apple vows to resist FBI demand to crack iPhone linked to San Bernardino attacks |author=Ellen Nakashima |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=February 17, 2016 |accessdate=February 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple CEO [[Tim Cook]] in an [[open letter]] warned of the precedent that following the order would create.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Message to our Customers |url=https://www.apple.com/customer-letter/ |last=Cook |first=Tim |authorlink=Tim Cook |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |date=February 16, 2016 |accessdate=February 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] announced its support for Apple's position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EFF to Support Apple in Encryption Battle |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/02/eff-support-apple-encryption-battle |last=Opsahl |first=Kurt |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |date=February 16, 2016 |accessdate=February 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several public figures have joined the debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Neill|first1=Maggie|title=Apple vs. FBI: See who's taking sides|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/02/18/technology/apple-fbi-taking-sides/index.html|accessdate=February 19, 2016|work=[[CNN]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]]|date=February 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 20, 2017, the [[Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] stated that a decryption order issued under the Act did not violate the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] privilege against [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Self-incrimination|self-incrimination]] if the contents of a hard drive were a "foregone conclusion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=United States of America v.

In court filings, Apple has argued that [[United States Congress|Congress]] has established guidelines for what is required of private entities in such circumstances in the [[Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act|Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act of 1992]] (CALEA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2016/02/18/will-an-18th-century-law-force-apple-into-hacking-killers-phone/|title=Can an 18th-century law force Apple into hacking killer's phone?|date=February 18, 2016|work=[[New York Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DOJ has argued, both in October in Brooklyn and in filings on February 19, 2016, against Apple that CALEA does not apply to these cases, which involve "data at rest rather than in transit", an important distinction for determining whether CALEA applies, nor does it alter the authority granted the courts under the All Writs Act.  On February 29, 2016, Magistrate Judge James Orenstein issued an order denying the government's request in its effort to decrypt an iPhone for admission as evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/02/29/technology/document-Orenstein-Order.html|title=Magistrate Judge James Orenstein's Order|date=February 29, 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sen.

Despite its popular usage, '''anocracy''' lacks a precise definition.&lt;ref name="ReganBell2010"/&gt; Anocratic regimes are loosely defined as part democracy and part [[dictatorship]],&lt;ref name="GandhiVreeland2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Fearon |first1= James |last2= Laitan |first2= David |title= Ethnicity, Insurgency, and Civil War |journal= American Political Science Review |date= February 2003 |volume= 97}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as a "regime that mixes democratic with autocratic features".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Another definition classifies anocracy as "a regime that permits some means of participation through opposition group behavior but that has incomplete development of mechanisms to redress grievances".&lt;ref name="ReganBell2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Benson |first1=Michelle |last2=Kugler |first2=Jackek |title= Power Parity, Democracy, and Severity of Internal Violence |journal= Journal of Conflict Resolution |date= April 1998 |volume= 42 |issue= 2 |pages= 196–209 |doi= 10.1177/0022002798042002004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have also distinguished anocracies from autocracies and democracies in their capability to maintain authority, political dynamics, and policy agendas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Marshall |first1= Monty |last2= Gurr |first2= Ted |title= Peace and conflict 2003: A global study of armed conflicts, self-determination movements, and democracy. |journal= College Park: Center for International Development and Conflict Management, University of Maryland |date= 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, these regime types have democratic institutions that allow for nominal amounts of competition.&lt;ref name="GandhiVreeland2008"/&gt;

These regime types are particularly susceptible to outbreaks of armed conflict and unexpected or adverse changes in leadership.&lt;ref name="Marshall_Cole_2014"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Marshall |first1= Monty G. |last2= Cole |first2= Benjamin R. |title= Global Report 2014 - Conflict, Governance, and State Fragility |journal= Center for Systemic Peace |date= July 23, 2014 |url= http://www.systemicpeace.org/vlibrary/GlobalReport2014.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The operational definition of anocracy is extensively used by scholars Monty G. Marshall and Benjamin R. Cole at the [http://www.systemicpeace.org Center for Systemic Peace] and gains most of its dissemination through the [[polity data series]]. The data set aims to measure democracy in different states, and retains anocracy as one of its classification methods for regime type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Center for Systemic Peace |title= PolityProject |url= http://www.systemicpeace.org/polityproject.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, anocracy frequently appears in democratization literature that utilizes the polity-data set.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
In a closed anocracy, competitors are drawn from the élite. In an open anocracy, others compete too.&lt;ref name="Marshall_Cole_2014"/&gt;

The number of anocratic regimes has steadily increased over time, with the most notable jump occurring after the [[Post Cold War era|end of the Cold War]].&lt;ref name="Marshall_Cole_2014"/&gt; During the period from 1989 to 2013, the number of anocracies increased from 30 to 53.&lt;ref name="Polity4"/&gt;

==Traits of anocracy==

=== Human rights ===
Due to the instability of anocratic regimes, [[human rights]] violations are significantly higher within anocracies than democratic regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vreeland |first=James Raymond |date=2008 |title=The Effect of Political Regime on Civil War: Unpacking Anocracy. |journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=401–425 |jstor=27638616 |doi=10.1177/0022002708315594}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davenport_Armstrong_2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Landman2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Landman |first=Todd |date=July 2005 |title=The Political Science of Human Rights |journal=British Journal of Political Science |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=549–572 |jstor=4092244 | doi = 10.1017/s0007123405000293 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Maplecroft's 2014 Human Rights Risk Atlas, eight of the top ten worst human rights violating countries are anocracies.&lt;ref name="Maplecroft2014"&gt;{{cite web |title=Maplecroft 2014 Global Risk Analytics |website=Maplecroft |url=http://maplecroft.com/about/news/ccvi.html |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gates2014"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gates |first=Sara |date=4 December 2014 |title=The 10 Worst Countries For Human Rights |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/03/human-rights-risk-atlas-2014-violations-maplecroft_n_4374133.html |work=[[The Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the report categorized every current anocracy as "at risk" or at "extreme risk" of human rights offenses.&lt;ref name="Maplecroft2014" /&gt;

In their annual Freedom in the World report, [[Freedom House]] scored state’s violations of [[civil liberties]] on a seven-point scale, with a score of seven representing the highest percentage of violations.&lt;ref name="FITW2014"&gt;{{cite web |title=Freedom in the World 2014: Aggregate and Subcategory Scores |website=Freedom House |url=https://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world-aggregate-and-subcategory-scores#.VHJum1fF8o}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom House defined civil liberty violations as the infringement of freedom of expression, associational and organizational rights, rule of law, and individual rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Methodology |website=Freedom House |url=https://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world-2014/methodology#.VHJvwFfF8oZ}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most consolidated democracies received scores of one, almost all anocracies were scored between four and six, due to the high percentage of civil liberties violations within most anocratic regimes.&lt;ref name="FITW2014" /&gt;

=== Violence ===
Statistics show that anocracies are ten times more likely to experience intrastate conflict than democracies, and twice as likely as autocracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gehem |first=M. |last2=Marten |first2=P. |last3=Schellekens |first3=M. |date=2014 |title=Balancing on the Brink: Vulnerability of states in the Middle East and North Africa |location=Hague |publisher=The Hague Centre for Strategic Studies |volume=3 |issue=23 |url=http://www.hcss.nl/reports/download/146/2456/}}&lt;/ref&gt; One explanation for the increase in violence and conflict within anocracies is a theory known as More Murder in the Middle (MMM).&lt;ref name="Fien1995" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hendrix |first=Cullen S. |last2=Wong |first2=Wendy H. |date=July 2013 |title=When Is the Pen Truly Mighty?

According to the [[Political terror scale]] (PTS), a data set which ranks state sponsored violence on a five-point scale, almost every anocracy is ranked as having a score between three and five.&lt;ref name="politicalterrorscale.org"&gt;Gibney, M., Cornett, L., Wood, R., &amp; Haschke, P., (2012) Political Terror Scale 1976-2012. Retrieved from http://www.politicalterrorscale.org/&lt;/ref&gt; On the scale, a score of three indicates a state where "there is extensive political imprisonment, or a recent history of such imprisonment. Execution or other political murders and brutality may be common. Unlimited detention, with or without a trial, for political views is accepted."&lt;ref name="politicalterrorscale.org"/&gt; States are ranked as a four when, "civil and political rights violations have expanded to large numbers of the population. Murders, disappearances and torture are a common part of life. In spite of its generality, on this level terror affects those who interest themselves in politics or ideas."&lt;ref name="politicalterrorscale.org"/&gt; Scores of five are given to states where, "terror has expanded to the whole population. The leaders of these societies place no limits on the means or thoroughness with which they pursue personal or ideological goals."&lt;ref name="politicalterrorscale.org"/&gt; While only eleven states were given scores of five in the 2012 Political Terror Scale report, four of those states, [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Eritrea]], [[Somalia]], and [[Sudan]], were classified by the [[Polity data series]] as anocracies.&lt;ref name="Polity4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="politicalterrorscale.org"/&gt;

===Civil war===
There are differing views on whether or not anocracy leads to civil war. It is debated whether or not transitions between government regimes or political violence leads to civil war.

Civil war in unstable countries are usually the outcome of a country's inability to meet the population's demands.&lt;ref name="Marshall_Cole_2014"/&gt; The inability for the state to provide the needs of the population leads to factionalism within the country.&lt;ref name="Marshall_Cole_2014"/&gt; When the factions are not able to get what they want, then they take up arms against the state.&lt;ref name="Marshall_Cole_2014"/&gt;

Former democracies that transition to anocracy have a greater risk of being embroiled in civil conflict.&lt;ref name="ReganBell2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Regan |first1=Patrick |last2=Bell |first2=Sam |title=Changing Lanes or Stuck in the Middle: Why Are Anocracies More Prone to Civil Wars? |journal=Political Science Quarterly |date=December 2010 |volume=63 |issue=4 |pages=747–759 |doi=10.1177/1065912909336274}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population's awareness of what rights they had as a democratic society may compel them to fight to regain their rights and liberties. On the other hand, autocracies that transition into anocracies are less likely to break out in civil war.&lt;ref name="ReganBell2010" /&gt; Not all anocracies are unstable. There are many countries that are stable but are classified as anocracies, such as Russia and Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name="ReganBell2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Polity4" /&gt; It is the transitional qualities associated with some anocracies that are predicative of civil conflict.&lt;ref name="ReganBell2010" /&gt; The magnitude of the transition also affects the probability of a civil conflict. The higher magnitude of the transition, the higher likelihood of civil war.&lt;ref name="ReganBell2010" /&gt;

However, some international relations experts use the polity data series in the formulation of their hypothesis and study and this presents a problem because the Polity IV system uses violence and civil war as a factor in their computation of a country's polity score.&lt;ref name="GandhiVreeland2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gandhi |first1=Jennifer |last2=Vreeland |first2=James |title=Political Institutions and Civil War: Unpacking Anocracy |journal=Journal of Conflict Solutions |date=June 2008 |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=401–425 |doi=10.1177/0022002708315594}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two components, "the degree of institutionalization, or regulation, of political competition",&lt;ref name="GandhiVreeland2008" /&gt; and "the extent of government restriction on political competition",&lt;ref name="GandhiVreeland2008" /&gt; are problematic to use in any study involving Polity IV and civil war in anocratic governments. In the numeric rating system of one of these parts of Polity IV, unregulated, "may or may be characterized by violent conflict among partisan groups."&lt;ref name="GandhiVreeland2008" /&gt; The other component says "there are relatively stable and enduring political groups - but competition among them is intense, hostile, and frequently violent."&lt;ref name="GandhiVreeland2008" /&gt; The only thing that can be deduced concretely, is that political violence tends to lead to civil war.&lt;ref name="GandhiVreeland2008" /&gt; There is no solid evidence to support that political institutions in an anocracy leads to civil war.&lt;ref name="GandhiVreeland2008" /&gt;

=== Broadness and complexity===
While the first three characteristics capture the instability of anocracies, another feature of anocratic regimes is its broad descriptiveness. Anocracy describes a regime type with a mix of institutional characteristics that either constrains or promotes the democratic process, "encapsulating a complex category encompassing many institutional arrangements".&lt;ref name="ReganBell2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; While anocracies demonstrate some capacity for civil society and political participation, their autocratic and democratic counterparts show considerably more or less capabilities.&lt;ref name="ReganBell2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Thus, while scholars are easily able to identify democratic and autocratic regimes based on their respective characteristics, anocracies become a wider, "catchall" category for all other regimes.&lt;ref name="ReganBell2010"/&gt; Yet, despite its broadness and complexity, the convention is still used because of its relevance to civil instability as well as its usage in the Polity data series.&lt;ref name="ReganBell2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gates |first1=Scott |last2=Hegre |first2=Havard |last3=Jones |first3=Mark P. |title=Institutional inconsistency and political instability: Polity duration 1800-2000 |journal=American Journal of Political Science |date=2006 |volume=50 |pages=893–908 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00222.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cambodia]] is an example of anocracy because its government displays democratic and authoritarian aspects. Under the [[United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia]], Cambodia implemented an electoral system based on proportional representation, held legitimate elections, and instituted a parliamentary system of government.&lt;ref name="LIT Verlag Munster"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Croissant |first1=Aurel |last2=Martin |first2=Beate |title=Between Consolidation and Crisis: Elections and Democracy in Five Nations in Southeast Asia |date=2006 |publisher=LIT Verlag Munster}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution, created on 21 September 1993 indicated that Cambodia was a parliamentary government with a constitutional monarchy.&lt;ref name="LIT Verlag Munster"/&gt; Cambodia exhibited signs of a democratic state, especially with the presence of elections and a proportionally representative government. Following the [[1997 clashes in Cambodia|coup]] in 1997, the Cambodian government has taken more authoritarian measures to keep peace in the country.&lt;ref name="Is Cambodia at a tipping point"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Freeman |first1=Joe |title=Is Cambodia at a tipping point? |url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/10/world/asia/cambodia-protests-analysis/ |website=CNN.com |date=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protests have been suppressed violently by pro-government forces and many human rights activists and protester have been arrested by the Cambodian government.&lt;ref name="Is Cambodia at a tipping point"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cambodia: New Crackdown on Protesters |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/11/13/cambodia-new-crackdown-protesters |agency=Human Rights Watch |date=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sovuthy |first1=Khy |title=Protesters Call for Release of Detained Activists |url=http://www.cambodiadaily.com/news/protesters-call-for-release-of-detained-activists-72391/ |website=cambodiadaily.com |date=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cambodia shows signs of being an unstable government with abrupt changes in leadership, making it an anocratic. The initial elections led to [[FUNCINPEC]]'s victory under the leadership of [[Norodom Ranariddh|Prince Ranariddh]]. FUNCINPEC and the [[Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party]] won 68 out of 120 seats in the National Assembly.&lt;ref name="LIT Verlag Munster"/&gt; The [[Cambodian People's Party]], led by [[Hun Sen]], refused to accept the outcome. Although a coalitional government was created with Prince Ranariddh as the First Prime Minister and Sen as the Second Prime Minister, the deal failed as Sen led a coup d'état on July 5, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A coup in Cambodia |url=http://www.economist.com/node/370230 |agency=The Economist |date=10 July 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sen and the CPP have been in power ever since and the CPP recently won a general election against the [[Cambodia National Rescue Party]] led by [[Sam Rainsy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=After Cambodia's election |url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21583694-opposition-leader-vanishes-when-colleagues-need-him-most-stand?zid=309&amp;ah=80dcf288b8561b012f603b9fd9577f0e |agency=The Economist |date=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thailand====
[[Thailand]]'s history of leadership changes make it an anocratic state. Thailand has been undergoing constant political upheaval since 1993.&lt;ref name="LIT Verlag Munster"/&gt; Coups d'état and the purchase of political votes are the main causes for Thai political instability. Thailand experienced a period of political liberalization under [[Prem Tinsulanonda|General Prem Tinsulanonda]] who was an unelected Prime Minister during the 1980-1988 period.&lt;ref name="LIT Verlag Munster"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leifer |first1=Michael |title=Dictionary of the Modern Politics of Southeast Asia |date=13 May 2013 |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of coups ensued soon after. [[Suchinda Kraprayoon|General Suchinda Kraprayoon]] led a coup against [[Chatichai Choonhavan|Prime Minister Choonhavan]] on February 23, 1991.&lt;ref name="February 1991 Coup"&gt;{{cite web |title=February 1991 Coup |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/thailand/coup-1991.htm |website=Globalsecurity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Black May (1992)|Black May]] incident Suchinda was forced to resign and [[Anand Panyarachun]] was assigned the position of temporary prime minister.&lt;ref name="February 1991 Coup"/&gt; [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] won the 2001 elections and became Prime Minister of Thailand; he won again in 2005 but a [[2006 Thai coup d'état|coup]] led by the Thai military deposed Prime Minister Shinawatra in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Walker |first1=Peter |title=Thai military claims control after coup |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/sep/19/thailand |website=Theguardian.com |date=19 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a new [[2007 constitution of Thailand|constitution]] was adopted, [[Samak Sundaravej]] and his [[People's Power Party (Thailand)]] won the election on December 23, 2007 and Sundaravej became prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thaksin ally wins Thai election |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7158354.stm |website=news.bbc.co.uk |date=23 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to a conflict of interest, Sundaravej was ousted and [[Somchai Wongsawat]] was elected as the new prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Beech |first1=Hannah |title=Thai PM Ousted over Cookery Shows |url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1839758,00.html |website=Time.com |date=9 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thai MPs elect new prime minister |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7620257.stm |website=news.bbc.co.uk |date=17 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after his election, Prime Minister Wongsawat and the PPP was found to be guilty of electoral fraud and Wongsawat lost his position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weaver |first1=Matthew |title=Thailand prime minister to step down after court strips him of office |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/02/thailand-protests-somchai-wongsawat |website=theguardian.com |date=2 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abhisit Vejjajiva]]'s election as the next prime minister was met with [[2010 Thai political protests|opposition]] by "Red Shirts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=MacKinnon |first1=Ian |title=Thai opposition leader elected PM |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/15/thailand-pm-abhisit-vejjajiva |website=Theguardian.com |date=15 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 3, 2011, [[Yingluck Shinawatra]], belonging to the [[Pheu Thai Party]], was elected as prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A surprising new face |url=http://www.economist.com/node/18925843 |agency=The Economist |date=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following mass protests in 2013, Shinawatra was deposed by a military coup led by [[Prayut Chan-o-cha|General Chan-o-cha]], who is currently the prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hodal |first1=Kate |title=Former Thai prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra detained after coup |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/23/yingluck-shinawatra-detained-thailand-coup-military |website=Theguardian.com |date=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lefevre |first1=Amy Sawitta |title=Thai capital hit by biggest protests since deadly 2010 unrest |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/24/us-thailand-protest-idUSBRE9AN09Q20131124 |website=Reuters.com |date=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Burma====
[[Burma]], or the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, is classified as an anocracy because of adverse armed conflict, changes in leadership, and the part-democratic, part-authoritarian nature of its government. Burma had a representative democracy after it gained [[Independence Day (Burma)|independence]] from Britain. Soon after independence was achieved, there was an outbreak of various insurgencies and rebellions.&lt;ref name="FearonLaitan"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fearon |first1=James D. |last2=Laitin |first2=David D. |title=Burma |url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/ethnic/Random%20Narratives/BurmaRN1.2.pdf |format=pdf |website=Stanford |date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these insurgencies were caused by divides along ethnic lines.&lt;ref name="FearonLaitan" /&gt; One of the most prominent civil wars in Burma, the [[Kachin conflict]], restarted in 2011 and Burma is still embroiled in a civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Beech |first1=Hannah |title=Inside the Kachin War Against Burma |url=http://time.com/3598969/kachin-independence-army-kia-burma-myanmar-laiza/ |website=Time.com |date=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Whiteman |first1=Hilary |title=Why Kachin conflict threatens Myanmar peace |url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/23/world/asia/myanmar-burma-kachin-conflict/ |website=CNN.com |date=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burma has had a history of changes in government, usually through military coups. In 1962, General [[Ne Win]] enacted a military coup and created the [[Burma Socialist Programme Party]] which held power for 26 years.&lt;ref name="Understanding Myanmar"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bajoria |first1=Jayshree |title=Understanding Myanmar |url=http://www.cfr.org/human-rights/understanding-myanmar/p14385 |website=Cfr.org |date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 18, 1988, General [[Saw Maung]] led another military coup to return the government to the people and created the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), renamed [[State Peace and Development Council]].&lt;ref name="1988 Uprising and 1990 Election"&gt;{{cite web |title=1988 Uprising and 1990 Election |url=http://www.oxfordburmaalliance.org/1988-uprising--1990-elections.html |website=oxfordburmaalliance.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; After holding free and legitimate elections in May 1990, the [[National League for Democracy]] (NLD) won with [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] at its head.&lt;ref name="1988 Uprising and 1990 Election"/&gt; However, the military junta refused to give up power to the NLD.&lt;ref name="1988 Uprising and 1990 Election"/&gt;
The [[Union Solidarity and Development Party]] (USDP), backed by the military, won the 2010 elections and the military government was dissolved soon after.&lt;ref name="Understanding Myanmar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=Western states dismiss Burma's election |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-11707294 |website=bbc.com |date=8 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Burma junta disbanded as 'civilian' government sworn in |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/30/burma-civilian-governmnet-junta-disbanded |website=Theguardian.com |date=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Burmese government shows signs of having democratic as well as authoritarian features. Burma is a pseudo-democratic state because of the elections that have been held in 1990 and 2010.&lt;ref name="1988 Uprising and 1990 Election"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt; However, both these elections were problematic because the military did not transfer power to the winning party in 1990 and the 2010 elections were seen as illegitimate.&lt;ref name="1988 Uprising and 1990 Election"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=MacFarquhar |first1=Neil |title=U.N.

The Win regime was marked by extreme oppression and human rights abuses and as a result, Burmese civilians and students [[8888 Uprising|protested]] against the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Burma's 1988 protests |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7012158.stm |website=news.bbc.co.uk |date=25 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Ne Win Years: 1962-1988"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Ne Win Years: 1962-1988 |url=http://www.oxfordburmaalliance.org/1962-coup--ne-win-regime.html |website=oxfordburmaalliance.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Burmese government responded violently to the protests and the [[Tatmadaw]], or Myanmar Armed Forces, killed many of the protestors.&lt;ref name="The Ne Win Years: 1962-1988"/&gt; After the coup in 1988 by General Maung, the protests were violently suppressed again as Maung's government proceeded to implement martial law to bring peace and order.&lt;ref name="1988 Uprising and 1990 Election"/&gt;

=== Anocracy in Africa===
At the end of [[World War II]], European control over its colonial territories in [[Africa]] diminished.&lt;ref name="Marshall_Cole_2014"/&gt; During this period of [[decolonization]] in the 1950s and 1960s, many African states gained independence.&lt;ref name="Marshall_Cole_2014"/&gt; Although these newly independent African states could become either democratic or autocratic regimes, manageability issues made way for autocratic regimes to come into power.&lt;ref name="Marshall_Cole_2014"/&gt; Most underdeveloped African states that did become democracies in this time period failed within 10 years and transitioned to autocracies.&lt;ref name="Marshall_Cole_2014"/&gt; For about 30 years after 1960, the number of autocratic regimes in Africa rose from 17 to 41 as the number of democratic regimes stayed around five.&lt;ref name="Marshall_Cole_2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Democracy in Africa"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gylfason |first1=Thorvaldur |title=Democracy in Africa |url=http://www.voxeu.org/article/democracy-africa |website=www.voxeu.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the collapse of [[communism]] in Europe and the rise of [[democratization]] at the end of the [[Cold War]], Africa experienced a major political transformation.&lt;ref name="Democracy in Africa"/&gt; In the 1990s, the number of autocracies decreased to nine and the number of democracies increased to nine as many African countries remained stuck in an anocratic state.&lt;ref name="Marshall_Cole_2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Democracy in Africa"/&gt; By 2012, Africa had three autocracies, 17 democracies, and 30 anocracies.&lt;ref name="Democracy in Africa"/&gt; By 2013, the majority of African countries remained either open or closed anocracies.&lt;ref name="Marshall_Cole_2014"/&gt; As African states transition from autocracy to anocracy and anocracy to democracy, electoral conflicts and violence remains prevalent.&lt;ref name="Lexington Books"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Adebayo |first1=Akanmu G. |title=Managing Conflicts in Africa's Democratic Transitions |date=2012 |publisher=Lexington Books |pages=233–252 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0XCM1QgmVnMC&amp;pg=PA239&amp;lpg=PA239&amp;dq=africa+and+anocracy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JGTtw0s_T6&amp;sig=yqkp9FSbJwH-yFxx7CBDybqXo3g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Aw9XVMztCNC0oQSQp4CoBg&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=africa%20and%20anocracy&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nigeria====
With a polity score of four in 2014, [[Nigeria]] is categorized as an open anocracy, transitioning closer to democracy than autocracy.&lt;ref name="Polity4" /&gt; In recent years, Nigeria has displayed characteristics of anocratic regimes including political corruption and electoral riggings.&lt;ref name="Nigeria's Rigged Democracy"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Herskovits |first1=Jean |title=Nigeria's Rigged Democracy |journal=Foreign Affairs |date=Jul–Aug 2007 |volume=86 |issue=4 |pages=115–130 |jstor=20032419}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following years of military rule after gaining independence in 1960 to 1999 with excluding 1979-83, the 2007 general elections marked the first time in Nigerian history that political leadership could be passed from one civilian to another through the process of election.&lt;ref name="Nigeria's Rigged Democracy"/&gt; However, in late 2006, just months before the April 2007 general election, former president [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] used state institutions to try to defeat political opponents as he attempted to win his third straight presidential term.&lt;ref name="Nigeria's Rigged Democracy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maduekwe"&gt;{{cite news|last=Maduekwe |first=Ojo M. |title=Nigeria: Between Anocracy and Authoritarianism |url=http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/nigeria-between-anocracy-and-authoritarianism/186082/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141108051237/http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/nigeria-between-anocracy-and-authoritarianism/186082/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 November 2014 |agency=This Day |date=12 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the [https://efccnigeria.org/efcc/ Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC)], an institution created by Obasanjo's administration, the former president had some of his political enemies and their family members either arrested or detained.&lt;ref name="Maduekwe"/&gt; Despite the electoral conflicts, some Nigerians view their country as running on democratic principles because military power has been controlled by political elites for 15 years.&lt;ref name="Maduekwe"/&gt; However, the aforementioned electoral conflicts combined with state governors using legislative and judiciary power to repeatedly win elections suggests that Nigeria remains an anocracy.&lt;ref name="Maduekwe"/&gt; Former president [[Goodluck Jonathan]] was accused of abusing his power in an attempt to remain in office past 2015, despite claiming his presidency advocated democratic principles.&lt;ref name="Maduekwe"/&gt;

====Zimbabwe====
When [[Robert Mugabe]] gained presidency in 1980, [[Zimbabwe]] was listed as an open anocracy with a polity score of four.&lt;ref name="Polity4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Autocracy and Anocracy"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Schofield |first1=Norman |last2=Gallego |first2=Maria |title=Autocracy and Anocracy |url=https://polisci.wustl.edu/files/polisci/imce/17.xxxanocracies-sept7-final-2011.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1987, the country had almost fully transitioned to an authoritarian regime with a polity score of negative six, which made it a closed anocracy.&lt;ref name="Polity4" /&gt; After remaining on the border between an authoritarian regime and closed anocracy for over a decade, Zimbabwe's polity score increased in the early 2000s. Currently, Zimbabwe has a polity score of 4, making it an open anocracy.&lt;ref name="Polity4" /&gt; In recent years, Zimbabwe has moved toward becoming a more democratic regime, but electoral conflicts and human rights violations still exist leaving Zimbabwe as an anocratic regime.&lt;ref name="Autocracy and Anocracy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sibanda |first1=Nomore |title=Zimbabwe - careless of human rights |journal=International Union Rights |date=1997 |volume=4 |issue=4 |page=23 |jstor=41937098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Zimbabwe was a closed anocracy in the late 1990s, the country experienced major human rights violations.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; Labor strikes were common as employers did not listen to the demands of their employers and real wages fell by 60 percent from 1992 to 1997.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; The labor strikes that occurred in the late 1990s were declared illegal by the government of Zimbabwe and blame was put on poor, working class citizens.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; As labor laws continued hurting workers, health services declined and housing projects stagnated.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

Since becoming president in 1980, Mugabe has used a variety of tactics to remain in power that have led to major electoral conflicts over the years.&lt;ref name="Autocracy and Anocracy"/&gt; In the March 2008 presidential election, the electoral body reported that [[Morgan Tsvangirai]], the presidential candidate of the opposing party, received more votes than Mugabe.&lt;ref name="Autocracy and Anocracy"/&gt; However, because Tsvangirai received 48 percent of the vote and not full majority, it was announced that a runoff would take place. Using intimidation tactics, including murder threats, Mugabe and his party forced Tsvangirai to withdraw from the runoff and Mugabe remained in power.&lt;ref name="Autocracy and Anocracy"/&gt; A U.S. led [https://www.un.org/en/sc/ United Nations security council] to impose sanctions on Mugabe failed and talks about power-sharing between Mugabe and Tsvangirai ended soon after the runoff.&lt;ref name="Autocracy and Anocracy"/&gt; After opposing party candidate [[Lovemore Moyo]] won [[List of Speakers of the House of Assembly of Zimbabwe|Speaker of the Legislature]], a power-sharing coalition was finally set up in September 2008 in which Tsvangirai was named [[Prime Minister]].&lt;ref name="Autocracy and Anocracy"/&gt; Following this, the polity score of Zimbabwe increased from one to four by 2010.&lt;ref name="Polity4" /&gt; Yet, in 2013, Mugabe won his seventh straight presidential term and the election was criticized for being rigged to allow Mugabe to win.&lt;ref name="Autocracy and Anocracy"/&gt;

====Uganda====
In the 1990s, [[Uganda]] transitioned from an autocracy to a closed anocracy.&lt;ref name="Polity4" /&gt; Although Uganda saw a jump in its polity score in the mid-2000s, it has retained a polity score of negative two for the last decade.&lt;ref name="Polity4" /&gt; Uganda is populated by many ethnic groups with the [[Buganda]] group, the largest of these groups, making up 17 percent of the population.&lt;ref name="Uganda Country Profile"&gt;{{cite web|title=Uganda Country Profile |url=http://www.tulane.edu/~internut/Countries/Uganda/ugandaxx.html |website=www.tulane.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405031435/http://www.tulane.edu/~internut/Countries/Uganda/ugandaxx.html |archivedate=2015-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Uganda gained independence in 1962, incessant conflict has ensued between the approximately 17 ethnic groups, which has led to political instability.&lt;ref name="Uganda Country Profile"/&gt; Dictator [[Idi Amin]] was responsible for around 300,000 deaths under his rule from 1971-1979 and guerrilla warfare from 1980-1985 under [[Milton Obote]] killed 100,000 people.&lt;ref name="Uganda Country Profile"/&gt; Human rights abuses under both of these rulers led to even more deaths from 1971 to 1985.&lt;ref name="Uganda Country Profile"/&gt;

In the early 1990s, Uganda experienced large-scale violent dissent as the country experienced more rebellions and guerrilla warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carey |first1=Sabine C. |title=Rebellion in Africa: Disaggregating the Effect of Political Regimes |journal=Journal of Peace Research |date=January 2007 |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=47–64 |jstor=27640452|doi=10.1177/0022343307072176}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the warring, the government called for non-party presidential and legislative elections in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name="Uganda Country Profile"/&gt; A period of relative peace followed as a [[common law]] legal system was instituted in 1995. During this period, Uganda transitioned from an authoritarian regime to a closed anocracy.&lt;ref name="Polity4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Uganda Country Profile"/&gt; The political situation of Uganda has seen little improvement under the rule of [[Yoweri Museveni]] who has maintained power since 1986.&lt;ref name="Uganda Country Profile"/&gt; Museveni has retained power due to the fact that other political organizations in Uganda cannot sponsor candidates.&lt;ref name="Uganda Country Profile"/&gt; Only Museveni and his [[National Resistance Movement]] (NRM) can operate without any limitations leading to electoral conflicts and violence.&lt;ref name="Uganda Country Profile"/&gt;

====Somalia====
[[Somalia]] was labeled as an autocracy from 1969 to 2012 with a polity score of negative seven throughout the entire period.&lt;ref name="Polity4" /&gt; From 1969 to 1991 [[Siad Barre]] was the military dictator of the [[Somali Democratic Republic]].&lt;ref name="Somalia Profile"&gt;{{cite news |title=Somalia Profile |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-14094503 |agency=BBC |publisher=BBC News |date=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Barre was overthrown in 1991, two decades of chaos ensued as civil war broke out and rival warlords fought to gain power. The consistent fighting of tribal leaders and warlords made the country unable to deal with natural disasters, droughts, and famines causing a combined 500,000 deaths in the famines of 1992 and 2010-2012.&lt;ref name="Somalia Profile"/&gt;

After years of being split into fiefdoms, the main Somali warlords established an agreement to appoint a new president in 2004. However, this plan failed when Islamist insurgents, including the radical youth militia [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]] who had links to [[Al-Qaeda]], gained control over much of southern Somalia from 2006 to 2008.&lt;ref name="Somalia Profile"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bruton |first1=Bronwyn |title=In the Quicksands of Somalia: Where Doing Less Helps More |journal=Foreign Affairs |date=Nov–Dec 2009 |volume=88 |issue=6 |pages=79–94 |jstor=20699717}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the assistance of international peace keeping offensives and the Kenyan army, the Islamist insurgents were forced to withdraw in 2012.&lt;ref name="Somalia Profile"/&gt; In the same year, the first formal parliament in over 20 years was appointed in Somalia.&lt;ref name="Somalia Profile"/&gt; The newly formed parliament chose [[Hassan Sheikh Mohamud]] as the new president in September 2012. With international assistance, the Somali government has been able to rebuild itself and the country has been relatively more stable recently.&lt;ref name="Somalia Profile"/&gt; Since 2013, Somalia has retained a polity score of five and is listed as an open anocracy.&lt;ref name="Polity4" /&gt;

===Anocracy in Europe===

====Russia====
[[Russia]], as of 2016, is classified as an open anocracy on the [[Polity data series|Polity IV scale]], which means that it is between one and five in its score.&lt;ref name="GandhiVreeland2008" /&gt; Open anocracies hold democratic elections, but ones that are not very free, and the country does not grant some rights of{{clarify|date=July 2017}} the population.&lt;ref name="GandhiVreeland2008" /&gt;{{qn|date=July 2017}} The press is strictly monitored, as is incoming news from the outside world.&lt;ref name="GandhiVreeland2008" /&gt; Russia allegedly has all of these characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{cite news |last1= Lally |first1= Kathy |last2= Englund |first2= Will |title= In Russia, politics and nationalist pride are basis of Putin's anti-American turn |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/in-russia-politics-and-nationalist-pride-are-basis-of-putins-anti-american-turn/2013/09/14/2f43c392-1c86-11e3-80ac-96205cacb45a_story.html |website= Washingtonpost.com |date= 14 September 2013 | quote= After demonstrators protesting rigged elections took to the streets against him in December 2011, Putin began conjuring up ways to isolate these liberal, Western-leaning, middle-class Russians from the rest of the country, the theory goes.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in 2013 the then president of [[Ukraine]], [[Viktor Yanukovych]], conducted talks with the [[European Union]] about establishing closer ties. Instead, Yanukovych backed out of the prospective agreement and turned to Russia for some multibillion-dollar loans.&lt;ref name="cnn.com"&gt;{{cite news |last1= Smith-Spark |first1= Laura |last2= Magnay |first2= Diana |title= Ukraine's President Viktor Yanukovych defends handling of political crisis |url= http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/30/world/europe/ukraine-protests/index.html |website= CNN.com |date= 30 January 2014 | quote = After Yanukovych's U-turn in November on the planned EU trade deal, he and Putin agreed to a $15 billion deal for Russia to buy Ukrainian debt.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civil unrest broke out in the streets of Kiev, with the citizens showing their anger over the president spurning the EU. Yanukovych fled to Russia (February 2014) as the protests got out of hand. An interim government took office in early 2014, with new elections scheduled for later in 2014. A referendum held to determine if Crimea was to become part of Russia came under criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1= Vasilyeva |first1= Nataliya |title= Ukraine Breakaway Regions Hold Criticized Elections |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/02/ukraine-elections_n_6090456.html |website= Huffingtonpost.com |date= 2 November 2014}} {{dead link|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Questionable plebiscites are a characteristic of anocracy{{Citation needed|date= August 2016}}. In February 2014 the death toll in [[Kiev]] rose to almost 100 due to escalating clashes between demonstrators and security forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1= Kramer |first1= Andrew E. |last2= Higgins |first2= Andrew |title= Ukraine's Forces Escalate Attacks Against Protesters |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/21/world/europe/ukraine.html?_r=0 |website= nytimes.com |date= 20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, in combination with the government's loose hold on its subjects, and foreign interference makes Ukraine an example of a [[transitional state]], one that is in an anocratic stage.&lt;ref name="ReganBell2010" /&gt;

However, the duration of the period where the term (i.e. 'Anocracy') might be considered relevant to Ukraine did not last long, but, rather, there was a number of outbreaks and they fitted mostly into the Maidan period (i.e. from 30 November 2013 till 20 February 2014): notably, they concentrated around certain events that earmarked the intensification of the hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drotenko|first=Valerii|title=Euro-Maidan: Chronicles and context (up to 27.01.2014)|url=https://www.academia.edu/9632173/Euro-Maidan_Chronicles_and_context_up_to_27.01.2014_|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Otherwise, the Ukrainians as a nation have demonstrated sound ability to self-organization, self-discipline and absence of temptations to indulge in mass criminality, which normally accompanies such events. In contrary - the acting authorities of that period (Viktor [[Viktor Yanukovych|Yanukovych]] and his apparatus) were the ones to instigate and provoke criminality: from using notorious thugs (widely referred there to as [[Titushky|'titushki']]) to outright releasing criminals from the prisons in the neighbourhood of capital city Kyiv&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-protesters-take-control-of-kiev-seize-presidents-office/|title=Protesters seize Ukraine president's office, take control of Kiev|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; - with the aim to distabilize the overall situation and compromise the post-Maidan authorities.

Theoretically, the secession of territories ([[Crimea]] on the [[Donbass separatism|South and Donbass]] on the [[Eastern Ukraine|East]]) might be other tokens to justify the classification of Ukraine as anocracy. However, it has been proved that in both cases Russia stood behind the local separatists: vote on [[Crimean status referendum, 2014|Crimean referendum]] led to international condemnation and the public opinion might have been skewed [[Propaganda in post-Soviet Russia|by massive propaganda in Russian mass media]] (which dominated the peninsula's media landscape) as well as temporary vacuum of central power after [[Viktor Yanukovych|Yanukovych]] has fled the country; whereas the same has been attempted in the rest of South-East (e.g. [[Kharkiv]], [[Odessa|Odesa]], [[Kherson]], [[Dnipro]], etc.), but succeeded only in extreme South-Eastern part of [[Donetsk Oblast|Donetsk]] and [[Luhansk Oblast|Luhansk]] [[Oblasts of Ukraine|oblasts]] - and would have been inevitably ended without both open and implicit [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|Russian intervention and military aid]].

====Yugoslavia====
[[Yugoslavia]] was a large country in Europe until the 1990s. It was mostly held together in the latter half of the 20th century by [[Josip Broz Tito]],&lt;ref name="The Former Yugoslavia"&gt;{{cite web |last1= Rosenberg |first1= Matt |title= The Former Yugoslavia |url= http://geography.about.com/od/politicalgeography/a/fmryugoslavia.htm |website= geography.about.com | quote = Marshal Tito was able to keep Yugoslavia unified from the formation of the country from 1945 until his death in 1980.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a president strongman who ruled by force of personality.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Tensions rose between the different ethnic groups in Yugoslavia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1= Rosenberg |first1= Matt |title= The Former Yugoslavia |url= http://geography.about.com/od/politicalgeography/a/fmryugoslavia.htm |website= geography.about.com | quote = Following Tito's death in 1980, factions in Yugoslavia became agitated and demanded more autonomy.

&lt;/ref&gt; The destructive [[Yugoslav Wars]] in the 1990s cost many lives. The fragmentation of power in Yugoslavia, disputed elections, and the discontent of the differentiated ethnic political groups are the main factors resulting in Yugoslavia and its successor states{{which|date=July 2017}} being{{when|date=July 2017}} considered{{by whom|date=July 2017}} anocracies.&lt;ref name="What is Democratic Consolidation"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Schedler |first1= Andreas |title= What is Democratic Consolidation? |journal= Journal of Democracy |date= 1998 |volume= 9 |issue= 2 |pages= 91–107 |doi= 10.1353/jod.1998.0030}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political stagnation, and the non-civilian control of the military during the civil wars play a large part as well.&lt;ref&gt;

==Successful transitions==
Anocratic regimes are often implicitly mentioned in democratic transition literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Huntington |first1=Samuel |title=The Third Wave: Democratization in the Late Twentieth Century |date=1991 |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |location=Norman, OK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Diamond |first1=Larry |title=Developing Democracy: Toward Consolidation |date=1999 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Linz |first1=Juan |title=Transition to Democracy |journal=Washington Quarterly |date=Summer 1990 |volume=143 |issue=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous examples of regimes that have successfully transitioned to democracy from anocracy.

===Mexico===
[[Mexico]]'s transition from an anocratic to democratic regime occurred during the 1980s and 1990s on the electoral stage. This period was characterized by the rise of multiple parties, decline of power from the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]], and decentralization of power from the national level into municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lawson |first1=Chappell |title=Mexico's Unfinished Transition: Democratization and Authoritarian Enclaves in Mexico |journal=Mexican Studies |date=Summer 2000 |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=267–287 |doi=10.1525/msem.2000.16.2.03a00040}}&lt;/ref&gt; The democratization process produced competitive elections with less voting fraud, culminating with the [[Mexican general election, 1994|1994 presidential election]].&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Camp |first1=Roderic |title=The Oxford Handbook of Mexican Politics |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=198 Madison Avenue, New York, NY |isbn=978-0-19-537738-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cornelius |first1=Wayne |title=Mexico's Delayed Democratization |journal=Foreign Policy |date=Summer 1994 |volume=95 |pages=53–71 |doi=10.2307/1149423}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a documented increase in the role of media and journalism during this period, which led to the creation of various special interest groups, such as those representing the environment, indigenous rights, and women's rights.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"/&gt; However, violence continues to remain a characteristic of Mexico's local elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Negroponte |first1=Dianna Villiers |title=Political Violence Surrounding Mexico's Local Elections |url=http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2013/07/17-political-violence-mexico-local-elections-negroponte |website=Brookings Institution}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Zabluovsky |first1=Karla |title=Mexico's Election Violence Said to Be the Worst in Years |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/07/world/americas/mexicos-election-violence-is-said-to-be-worst-in-years.html |agency=New York Times |date=July 6, 2013 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wilkinson |first1=Tracy |title=Political violence casts shadow over upcoming Mexico Election |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jul/03/world/la-fg-mexico-election-violence-20130704 |agency=Los Angeles Times |date=July 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taiwan===
In the aftermath of World War II, Japan surrendered [[Taiwan]] to the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. The constitution that the Republic of China used to govern Taiwan guaranteed civil rights and elections, but was ignored in favor of rule under martial law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tien |first1=Hung-Mao |last2=Shiau |first2=Chyuan-Jeng |title=Taiwan's Democratization: A Summary |journal=World Affairs |date=Fall 1992 |volume=155 |issue=2 |pages=58–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taiwan's pro-democracy movement gained momentum during the early 1980s and coalesced into the formation of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] in 1986. Over the next decade, Taiwan attempted to restore the civil rights promised in its constitution, culminating with the Taiwan's first direct presidential election in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rigger |first1=Shelley |title=Democratic Transition and Consolidation in Taiwan |journal=Paper prepared for Taiwan's Future in the Asian Century: Toward a Strong, Prosperous, and Enduring Democracy Conference |date=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taiwan continues to move towards a consolidated democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Diamond |first1=Larry |title=How Democratic is Taiwan? Five Key Challenges for Democratic Development and Consolitation |url=https://web.stanford.edu/~ldiamond/papers/taiwan.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ghana===
In 1991, [[Ghana]] was listed as an autocratic regime with a polity score of negative seven. By the late 1990s and early 2000s, Ghana was an open anocracy. In 2005, Ghana successfully transitioned from an open anocracy to a democracy as it has retained a polity score of eight since 2006.&lt;ref name="Polity4" /&gt; A major part of Ghana's success can be attributed to its management of the electoral process in order to decrease electoral conflict.&lt;ref name="Lexington Books"/&gt; Since Ghana began having elections in 1992, strengthening government institutions such as a strong, independent electoral commission has decreased electoral conflict.&lt;ref name="Lexington Books"/&gt; The existence of civil society organizations and a media aimed at ensuring democratic principles have also helped manage electoral conflicts in Ghana. For example, Ghana's 2008 elections ended peacefully as political institutions were able to respond to electoral challenges and advance democratic principles and processes.&lt;ref name="Lexington Books"/&gt; However, some electoral conflicts remain on a small scale in Ghana such as ethnic vote blocking, vote buying, intimidation and hate speeches.&lt;ref name="Lexington Books"/&gt; Yet, even with these minor conflicts, Ghana has been able to transform from an anocracy to a democracy by decreasing electoral conflicts.&lt;ref name="Lexington Books"/&gt;

== Terminology ==

Use of the word "anocracy" in English dates back to at least 1950, when [[R. F. C. Hull]]'s reprinted translation of [[Martin Buber]]'s 1946 work ''Pfade in Utopia'' [''Paths in Utopia''] distinguished "''an''ocracy" ([[neoclassical compound]]: ἀκρατία ''akratia'') from "anarchy" - "not absence of government but absence of domination".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Buber | first = Martin | authorlink = Martin Buber | translator = R.

{{Campaignbox Fifth Coalition}}
The '''Armistice of Znaim''' was a ceasefire agreed between [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]] and [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]] on 12 July 1809 following the '''Battle of Znaim''', effectively ending hostilities between [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and [[First French Empire|France]] in the [[War of the Fifth Coalition]].

Following defeat at the [[Battle of Wagram]], Archduke Charles retreated north into [[Bohemia]] hoping to regroup his battered forces. The French army had also suffered in the battle and did not give immediate pursuit. But two days after the battle, Napoleon ordered his troops north intending to defeat the Austrians once and for all. The French eventually caught up the Austrians at Znaim (now [[Znojmo]], [[Czech Republic]]) on 10 July 1809. Realising they were in no position to give battle, the Austrians proposed a ceasefire as Archduke Charles went to begin peace negotiations with Napoleon. However, Marshal [[Auguste de Marmont]] refused to observe the ceasefire and committed his XI Corps of around 10,000 men into battle. With Marmont greatly outnumbered, [[André Masséna]] had no choice but to support him. By 11 July, Masséna's corps had joined Marmont's in battle but the Austrians had also reinforced their position around Znaim. After two days of futile fighting, with both sides suffering similar casualties and neither side gaining any advantage, Napoleon finally arrived with news of an armistice and ordered Marmont to end the battle.

Although the Battle of Znaim was the last action between Austria and France in the war, a formal peace was not agreed until the [[Treaty of Schönbrunn]] was signed on 14 October 1809, which finally ended the War of the Fifth Coalition.

==Prelude==
The immediate cause of the two-day Battle of Znaim was the decision of the Austrian commander in chief, Archduke Charles, to stage a rearguard action near the town of Znaim, about 80 kilometers north of [[Vienna]], in order to give his army time to withdraw its baggage train in safety toward [[Moravia]]. Marmont’s two combined French and [[Bavaria]]n corps were the first of Napoleon’s troops to arrive on the field following the course of the river [[Thaya]]. Believing that he faced only a rear guard, Marmont ordered his Bavarian troops to take the village of [[Dobšice (Znojmo District)|Tesswitz]] south of Znaim, while the rest of his troops attacked the village of [[Suchohrdly|Zuckerhandl]].&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Baker in ''The Encyclopedia of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars'' by Gregory Fremont-Barnes (main editor) (Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2006) 1111-1112.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle==
The Bavarians succeeded in storming Tesswitz but were then thrown out by Austrian reinforcements. Marmont renewed the Bavarian attack, and Tesswitz was retaken, only to be lost soon after. The village changed hands a number of times during the day, this contest constituting the heaviest fighting the Bavarians saw in the whole campaign. Marmont had hoped to swing his cavalry in behind the Austrian rear guard, but on reaching high ground above Tesswitz, they were faced with five enemy corps. The French cavalry was forced to withdraw in the face of a large body of Austrian cuirassiers.&lt;ref name="Baker1112"/&gt;

Marmont was now engaged by 40,000 Austrian troops and was heavily outnumbered. His men nevertheless managed to hold on to both Tesswitz and Zuckerhandl overnight. Archduke Charles withdrew his forces into a strong defensive position situated so as to hold the north bank of the Thaya and Znaim. Napoleon arrived at Tesswitz at 10:00 A.M., and despite the fact that he had brought with him reinforcements of cavalry and artillery, he believed that his force was too weak to launch a full-scale attack. His plan therefore was to employ Masséna’s corps to pin the Austrians throughout the day and to await the corps of marshals [[Louis-Nicolas Davout]] and [[Nicolas Oudinot]], which would be able to arrive early on the twelfth. Masséna launched his attack on the extreme right of the Austrian position during midmorning and quickly seized the main bridge across the Thaya south of Znaim. His troops took two small villages and then advanced directly on Znaim. Charles meanwhile reinforced the Austrian position with two grenadier brigades, which advanced during a thunderstorm and initially threw the French back.&lt;ref name="Baker1112"/&gt;

The situation was stabilized by a body of French cavalry at approximately 7:00 P.M., when French and Austrian staff officers rode along the opposing lines announcing a cease-fire, which led to the signature of an armistice on the twelfth. Znaim was to prove the last action of the 1809
campaign. The two sides signed a treaty of peace at the [[Schönbrunn Palace]] on 14 October.&lt;ref name="Baker1112"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1054">The German term '''Bürgerblock-Regierung''' (English: ''bourgeois bloc administration'') denotes a government coalition in the German [[Weimar Republic]]. It consisted of the [[German Democratic Party]], ''[[Centre Party (Germany)|Zentrum]]'', the [[Bavarian People's Party]], the [[German People's Party]] and the [[German National People's Party]] (or at least most of these parties).{{Clarify|date=May 2010}}

On 15. January 1925 the first occurrence of this coalition (led by [[Hans Luther]]) came into effect. On 29. January 1927 [[Wilhelm Marx]]'s cabinet brought the second occurrence of such a combination.

In the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]]  CDU/CSU/FDP coalitions are sometimes (rarely) referred to with this term. The usual denotation today is "centre-right government" or “bourgeois government” (in German "bürgerliche Regierung"), because the SPD is not part of this combination.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9198">'''Camp Nama''' was a military base in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]], originally built by the government of [[Saddam Hussein]], from which its name derives, and now used by Iraqi military forces.  Purportedly, the original Iraqi name has been repurposed by U.S. personnel involved with the facility as a [[backronym]] standing for "Nasty Ass Military Area".

== History ==

After the [[2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq]], the camp was taken over by elite American [[special operations]] forces.  The main purpose of the camp was to interrogate prisoners for information about [[Jordan]]ian [[terrorist]] [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]].  The ''[[New York Times]]'' reported on 19 March 2006, the three-year anniversary of the U.S. invasion, that the elite unit, known as [[Task Force 6-26]], used the facility to interrogate prisoners both before and after the [[Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse]] scandal.&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite journal

| title=Task Force 6-26: In Secret Unit's 'Black Room,' a Grim Portrait of U.S. Abuse| journal=New York Times
|date=19 March 2006}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the interrogation took place in "The Black Room," which used to be a torture chamber when Saddam's government ran the facility.  The camp was the target of repeated warnings and investigations from U.S. officials since August 2003.  There were placards around the camp that read "[[No Blood No Foul]]," a reference to the notion, described by a Pentagon official, that "If you don't make them bleed, they can't prosecute for it."

Allegations of abuse were first reported in the mainstream U.S. media in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;R. Jeffrey Smith and Josh White, "Soldier Who Reported Abuse Was Sent to Psychiatrist," ''Washington Post'' (5 March 2005) p. A15.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the more extensive ''New York Times'' report in 2006, which was "based on documents and interviews with more than a dozen people," the independent organization [[Human Rights Watch]] issued a report documenting detainee abuse in Iraq.  The report confirmed the charges about Camp Nama uncovered by the ''New York Times'', noting that "from 2003 to the present, numerous U.S. personnel and Iraqi detainees have reported serious mistreatment of detainees by the special task force, including beatings, exposure to extreme cold, threats of death, humiliation, and various forms of heavy interrogation. Many of these allegations have been contained in documents released to the American Civil Liberties Union and other human rights groups pursuant to Freedom of Information Act litigation."&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, ''"[http://hrw.org/reports/2006/us0706/ No Blood, No Foul": Soldiers' Accounts of Detainee Abuse in Iraq]'' 18:3 (July 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

The report included an extensive interview with one Sergeant, using the pseudonym "Jeff Perry", who worked as an interrogator with the task force running the detention center.  Sergeant "Perry" indicated that written authorizations were required for most abusive techniques, indicating that the use of these tactics was approved up the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There was an authorization template on a computer, a sheet that you would print out, or actually just type it in. And it was a checklist. And it was all already typed out for you, environmental controls, hot and cold, you know, strobe lights, music, so forth. Working dogs, which, when I was there, wasn’t being used. But you would just check what you want to use off, and if you planned on using a harsh interrogation you’d just get it signed off.

I never saw a sheet that wasn’t signed. It would be signed off by the commander, whoever that was, whether it was O3 [captain] or O6 [colonel], whoever was in charge at the time. ... When the O6 was there, yeah, he would sign off on that. ... He would sign off on that every time it was done.

Some interrogators would go and use these techniques without typing up one of those things just because it was a hassle, or he didn’t want to do it and knew it was going to be approved anyway, and you’re not gonna get in that much trouble if you get caught doing one of these things without a signature.

Techniques involving outright assault—hitting, slapping, and beating—were apparently not on the list, but were regularly used at Nama, indicating that the harsh methods that were approved often degenerated into even harsher treatment in practice.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Human Rights Watch's senior researcher on terrorism and counterterrorism commented, "These accounts rebut U.S. government claims that torture and abuse in Iraq was unauthorized and exceptional – on the contrary, it was condoned and commonly used."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/07/19/usint13767.htm U.S.: Soldiers Tell of Detainee Abuse in Iraq]." ''Human Rights Watch'' press release (23 July 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Investigation and inter-agency conflict ===

The reports of abuses inside Camp Nama were said to have outraged even seasoned CIA, FBI and DIA investigators accustomed to dealing with non-cooperative and hostile detainees, and to have provoked a culture clash between agencies and groups involved with the facility.  By early 2004, one of Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld's top aides, Under-Secretary for Defense Intelligence [[Stephen Cambone|Stephen A. Cambone]], ordered a subordinate, DIA head Vice Adm. [[Lowell E. Jacoby]] to "get to the bottom" of any misconduct.

By June 25, 2004, Admiral Jacoby wrote a two-page memo to Cambone, in which he described a series of complaints, including a May 2004 incident in which a DIA interrogator said he witnessed task force soldiers punch a detainee hard enough to require medical help. The DIA officer took photos of the injuries, but a supervisor confiscated them, the memo said.  The memo provoked an angry reaction from Mr. Cambone. "Get to the bottom of this immediately. This is not acceptable," Mr. Cambone said in a handwritten note on June 26, 2004, to his top deputy, Lt. Gen. [[William G. Boykin]]. "In particular, I want to know if this is part of a pattern of behavior by TF 6-26."

According to the ''New York Times'' article, General Boykin had earlier said (on March 17) through a spokesman that he told Mr. Cambone he had found no pattern of misconduct with the task force.  The article does not provide further detail on Boykin's response to the investigation after Cambone's and Jacoby's intervention in June, 2004.

=== Transfer to LSA Anaconda ===

According to the ''New York Times'' article, in the summer of 2004, Camp Nama closed and the unit moved to "a new headquarters in Balad, 45 miles north of Baghdad."  This would probably refer to Balad AB, also known as [[Logistics Support Area Anaconda]] and later as [[Joint Base Balad]].

Since the transfer the unit's operations are said to have been shrouded in even tighter secrecy.  According to [[Thomas E. Ricks (journalist)|Thomas E. Ricks]] of the ''[[Washington Post]]'', a new "detainee center" has indeed been established at Camp Balad, under the auspices of a new unit, the [[Joint Special Operations Task Force]]; entry is not permitted to normal Army Rangers personnel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.williambowles.info/spysrus/taskforce_121.html Sarah Meyer's notes on TF121]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prisoner abuse ===
British soldiers testified that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/01/camp-nama-iraq-human-rights-abuses |title=Camp Nama: British personnel reveal horrors of secret US base in Baghdad  |last1=Cobain |first1=Ian |date=April 1, 2013 |website=The Guardian |access-date=July 22, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Iraqi prisoners being held for prolonged periods in cells the size of large dog kennels.
* Prisoners being subjected to electric shocks.
* Prisoners being routinely hooded.
* Inmates being taken into a sound-proofed shipping container for interrogation, and emerging in a state of physical distress.

== Special areas ==

=== The Black Room ===
Detainees at the camp that were considered "high-value" were interrogated in "The Black Room," a dark mostly bare room with large metal hooks hanging from the ceiling.  The guards often used loud rock 'n' roll or rap music to torment prisoners during interrogations.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;

=== Motel 6 and Hotel California ===
The ''New York Times'' mentions other whimsically named sections of Camp Nama, including Motel 6, "a group of securely constructed wooden holding cells constructed by the United States Navy Seabees of Charlie Company NMCB-1 Air-Det. Conditions were cramped, forcing many prisoners to squat or crouch", in a block of 6-by-8 cubicles known as Hotel California. These holding cells were constructed to hold the leaders and Individuals responsible for terrorist acts and murders.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;

'''Cerna''' (''Heartwood'' in English) is a Galician political party. Cerna was founded in 2014 and has an ideology based in [[Galician nationalism]], [[direct democracy]], [[anticapitalism]], [[feminism]] and [[alter-globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cerna.org/index.html#novaTitulo |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025184908/http://www.cerna.org/index.html |archivedate=25 October 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cerna was created to organize the critical sector of [[Anova-Nationalist Brotherhood]] that focuses on highlighting the [[Galician nationalism|nationalist]] and [[Deliberative assembly|assembly]]-based character of the party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galiciahoxe.com/vivir-hoxe-galicia/gh/criticos-anova-constituense-nun-grupo-chamado-cerna-piden-un-cambio-radical/idEdicion-2014-06-29/idNoticia-877436/ Os críticos de Anova constitúense nun grupo chamado 'Cerna' e piden "un cambio radical".] [[Galicia Hoxe]], SANTIAGO.

==History==
At the 2014 National Assembly of [[Anova-Nationalist Brotherhood|Anova]], CERNA was allocated only 3 seats in the party's National Council.

SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA, 12 Oct. (EUROPA PRESS)]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the organization decided to leave [[Anova-Nationalist Brotherhood|ANOVA]], with 75% of its members supporting the split.

''“I am deeply grateful for the confidence that the board has placed in me as well as for the remarkable colleagues and community partners I have had the privilege to work with over the years. While I have very much enjoyed my role with Ulupono, it’s time for me to take a step back, and I am confident about Ulupono’s ability to continue to have catalytic impact for Hawai‘i. I look forward to continuing my work with a variety of organizations throughout the state to help further Hawai‘i’s sustainability and resilience.”''

'''Edith Elizabeth Downing''', (January 1857 - 3 October 1931) was an artist, sculptor and suffragette.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/person.php?id=smib1_1204301683|title=Miss Edith Elizabeth Downing|last=University of Glasgow History of Art and HATII|first=|date=2011|website=Mapping the Practice and Profession of Sculpture in Britain and Ireland 1851-1951|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Edith Elizabeth Downing was born in [[Cardiff]] in January 1857. She was one of four children of the coal merchant and shipping agent Edward Downing, having two sisters and a brother, Edward. Her sister Mary was also to become an artist, whilst Caroline was to join the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] with Edith.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of British Women Artists|last=Gray|first=Sara|publisher=Lutterworth Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Women's Suffrage Movement: A Reference Guide 1806-1928|last=Crawford|first=Elizabeth|publisher=University College London Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=London|pages=171–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; After attending [[Cheltenham College]], Edith spent most of her working life based in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She died in October 1931 in [[Surrey]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Career ==
Edith Downing began her artistic training at the [[South Kensington School of Art]], later attending the [[Slade School of Fine Art|Slade School of Art]] between 1892-1893.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She was primarily a sculptor producing busts and figures in bronze and marble but she also painted watercolours and made reliefs and decorative panels.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Downing first had her work exhibited at the [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy]] in 1891 and she continued to be a regular contributor here until the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Royal Academy of Arts; a complete dictionary of contributors and their work from its foundation in 1769 to 1904.|last=Graves|first=Algernon|publisher=H.

== Suffragette Activity ==
Edith Downing joined the Central Society for [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|Women's Suffrage]] in 1903 and the London Society for Women's Suffrage in 1906. By 1908, however, she had become frustrated by the "futility of quiet work" and joined the Chelsea branch of the more radical [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU) together with her sister Caroline.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In June 1910 Edith and Marion Wallace-Dunlop created a 'Prisoners Tableau' for the WSPU 'Prison to Citizenship' procession whilst in the following year the two collaborated on the '[[Women's Coronation Procession]]'. This latter procession was led by [[Flora Drummond]] on horseback and included Annan Bryce dressed as [[Joan of Arc]] and 700 women and girls clothed in white to represent suffragette prisoners.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In November 1911 Downing took part in several demonstrations including one in [[Parliament Square]] which led to clashes with police and another on the 23rd of the month when she broke a window of [[Somerset House]] and was sentenced to a week in jail.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; She was arrested again on 1 March 1912 for throwing a stone through the window of a fine art dealers in [[Regent Street]] whilst participating in a WSPU window breaking protest in the [[West End of London|West End]] of London. On this occasion she was sent to [[HM Prison Holloway|Holloway Prison]] where she joined fellow suffragettes on [[hunger strike]] and was [[Force-feeding|force fed]]. She was released at the end of June.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

An '''election address''' is the material sent out by a [[candidate]] during a political campaign.  Election Addresses are normally only sent out during the [[election]] period itself.  Other political leaflets are usually known by different names.

In UK [[United Kingdom general elections|parliamentary elections]], all candidates are entitled to have one '''election address''' delivered free, by [[Royal Mail]] to every voter in their constituency.

In [[political theory|political]] and [[sociology|sociological]] theory, the '''elite''' (French ''élite'', from [[Latin]] ''eligere'') are a small group of powerful people who hold a [[economic inequality|disproportionate amount of wealth]], [[privilege (social inequality)|privilege]], [[political power]], or skill in a society. Defined by the Cambridge Dictionary, the "elite" are "those people or organizations that are considered the best or most powerful compared to others of a similar type." &lt;ref&gt;https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/type&lt;/ref&gt;
==Identity and social structure==
American sociologist [[C. Wright Mills]] wrote of the "elite" in his 1957 book ''[[The Power Elite]]'' as "those political, economic, and military circles, which as an intricate set of overlapping small but dominant groups share decisions having at least national consequences. Insofar as national events are decided, the power elite are those who decide them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doob|first=Christopher|title=Social inequality and Social Stratification in US Society|year=2013|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mills states that the power elite members recognize other members' mutual exalted position in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doob|first=Christopher|title=Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society|year=2013|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=2013|isbn=978-0-205-79241-2|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; "As a rule, 'they accept one another, understand one another, marry one another, tend to work, and to think, if not together at least alike'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doob|first=Christopher|title=Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society|year=2013|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-205-79241-2|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mills|first=Charles W.|title=The Power Elite|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It is a well-regulated existence where education plays a critical role. Youthful upper-class members attend prominent preparatory schools, which not only open doors to such elite universities as [[Harvard]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[Yale]], and [[Princeton University|Princeton]], but also to the universities' highly exclusive clubs. These memberships in turn pave the way to the prominent social clubs located in all major cities and serving as sites for important business contacts".&lt;ref name="Doob 2013 38"&gt;{{cite book|last=Doob|first=Christopher|title=Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society|year=2013|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=Upper Saddle River, new Jersey|isbn=978-0-205-79241-2|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mills|first=Charles W.|title=The Power Elite|year=1956|pages=63–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elitist privilege==
According to Mills, men receive the education necessary for [[elitism|elitist]] privilege to obtain their background and contacts, allowing them to enter three branches of the power elite, which are;
*The Political Leadership: Mills contended that since the end of [[World War II]], corporate leaders had become more prominent in the political process, with a decline in central decision-making for professional politicians. 
*The Military Circle: In Mills' time a heightened concern about warfare existed, making top military leaders and such issues as defense funding and personnel recruitment very important. Most prominent corporate leaders and politicians were strong proponents of military spending. 
*The Corporate Elite: According to Mills, in the 1950s when the military emphasis was pronounced, it was corporate leaders working with prominent military officers who dominated the development of policies. These two groups tended to be mutually supportive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doob|first=Christopher|title=Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society|year=2013|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-205-79241-2|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mills|first=Charles W.|title=The Power Elite|year=1956|pages=274–276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mills, the governing elite in the United States primarily draws its members from political leaders, including the president, and a handful of key cabinet members, as well as close advisers, major corporate owners and directors, and high-ranking military officers.&lt;ref name="Powell"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Power elite|editor=Ritzer, George |editor2=Ryan, J. Michael|title=The Concise Encyclopedia of Sociology|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2007|isbn=978-1-4051-8353-6|page=466|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dz4wU64f_JYC&amp;pg=PA466|author1=Powell, Jason L.  |author2=Chamberlain, John M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups overlap and elites tend to circulate from one sector to another, consolidating power in the process.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Jason L. (2007) "power elite" in George Ritzer (ed.) ''The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology'',  Blackwell Publishing, 2007, pp. 3602-3603&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the [[ruling class]], a social formation based on heritage and social ties, the power elite is characterized by the organizational structures through which its wealth is acquired. According to Mills, the power elite rose from "the managerial reorganization of the propertied classes into the more or less unified stratum of the corporate rich".&lt;ref&gt;[[C. Wright Mills|Mills, Charles W]]. ''The Power Elite'', p 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Domhoff further clarified the differences in the two terms: "The upper class as a whole does not do the ruling. Instead, class rule is manifested through the activities of a wide variety of organizations and institutions...Leaders within the upper class join with high-level employees in the organizations they control to make up what will be called the power elite".&lt;ref&gt;[[G. William Domhoff|Domhoff, William G]], ''Who Rules America Now?'' (1997), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Marxist]] theoretician [[Nikolai Bukharin]] anticipated the [[elite theory]] in his 1929 work, ''Imperialism and World Economy'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kevin|first1=Carson|title=Kevin Carson Wikipedia|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Carson}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=December 2017}} "present-day state power is nothing but an entrepreneurs' company of tremendous power, headed even by the same persons that occupy the leading positions in the banking and syndicate offices".&lt;ref&gt;[[Nikolai Bukharin|Bukharin, Nikolai]]. ''Imperialism and World Economy'' (1929)
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Power elite ==
The ''power elite'' is a term used by American sociologist [[C. Wright Mills]] to describe a relatively small, loosely connected group of individuals who dominate American policy making. This group includes bureaucratic, corporate, intellectual, military, [[media mogul|media]], and government elites who control the principal institutions in the United States and whose opinions and actions influence the decisions of the policymakers.&lt;ref&gt;power elite. (n.d.). The American Heritage® New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy, Third Edition. Retrieved January 18, 2015, from Dictionary.com website: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/power%20elite&lt;/ref&gt;

The basis for membership of a power elite is institutional power, namely an influential position within a prominent private or public organization.&lt;ref name="Doob 2013 38" /&gt; A study of the French corporate elite has shown that social class continues to hold sway in determining who joins this elite group, with those from the upper-middle class tending to dominate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maclean|first=Mairi|last2=Harvey|first2=Charles|last3=Kling|first3=Gerhard|date=2014-06-01|title=Pathways to Power: Class, Hyper-Agency and the French Corporate Elite|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0170840613509919|journal=Organization Studies|language=en|volume=35|issue=6|pages=825–855|doi=10.1177/0170840613509919|issn=0170-8406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study (published in 2002) of power elites in the United States under President [[George W. Bush]] (in office 2001-2009) identified 7,314 institutional positions of power encompassing 5,778 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dye|first=Thomas
|title= Who's Running America? The Bush Restoration, 7th edition
| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0-ntAAAAMAAJ
| year= 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later study of U.S. society noted demographic characteristics of this elite group as follows:

; '''Age''' : Corporate leaders aged about 60; heads of [[foundation (nonprofit)|foundations]], law, education, and civic organizations aged around 62; government employees aged about 56.
; '''Gender''' : Men contribute roughly 80% in the political realm whereas women contribute roughly only 20% in the political realm. In the economic denomination, {{as of|October 2017|lc=on}}, only 32 (6.4%) of the fortune 500 CEOs are women.&lt;ref name="Fortune 500"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fortune 500 list|url=http://beta.fortune.com/fortune500/list|website=Fortune|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; '''Ethnicity''' : [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|White Anglo-Saxons]] dominate in the power elite, with [[Protestants]] representing about 80% of the top business leaders, and about 73% of members of Congress. {{as of|October 2017}}, only 4 of the fortune 500 CEOs are African American.&lt;ref name="Fortune 500" /&gt; In similarly low proportions, {{as of|October 2017|lc=on}}, 10 of the fortune 500 CEOs are [[Latino]], and 2% are Asian.&lt;ref name="Fortune 500" /&gt;
; '''Education''' : Nearly all the leaders have a college education, with almost half graduating with advanced degrees. About 54% of the big-business leaders, and 42% of the government elite graduated from just 12 prestigious [[universities]] with large [[Endowment fund|endowments]].
; '''Social clubs''' : Most holders of top positions in the power elite possess exclusive membership to one or more [[social clubs]]. About a third belong to a small number of especially prestigious clubs in major cities like [[London]], [[New York City]], [[Chicago]], [[Boston]], and [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impacts on economy==

In the 1970s an organized set of policies promoted reduced [[tax]]es, especially for the wealthy, and a steady erosion of the welfare safety net.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins and Eckert 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with legislation in the 1980s, the wealthy banking community successfully lobbied for reduced regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Francis 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wide range of financial and social capital accessible to the power elite gives their members heavy influence in economic and political decision making, allowing them to move toward attaining desired outcomes. Sociologist Christopher Doob gives a hypothetical alternative, stating that these elite individuals would consider themselves the overseers of the national economy. Also appreciating that it is not only a moral, but a practical necessity to focus beyond their group interests. Doing so would hopefully alleviate various destructive conditions affecting large numbers of less affluent citizens.&lt;ref name="Doob 2013 38"/&gt;

==Global politics and hegemony==
Mills determined that there is an "inner core" of the power elite involving individuals that are able to move from one seat of institutional power to another. They therefore, have a wide range of knowledge and interests in many influential organizations, and are, as Mills describes, "professional go-betweens of economic, political, and military affairs".&lt;ref&gt;[[C. Wright Mills|Mills, Charles W]]. ''The Power Elite'', p 288.&lt;/ref&gt; Relentless expansion of [[capitalism]] and the globalizing of economic and military power, binds leaders of the power elite into complex relationships with [[nation states]] that generate global-scale class divisions. Sociologist [[Manuel Castells]] writes in ''[[The Rise of the Network Society]]'' that contemporary globalization does not mean that "everything in the global economy is global".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Castells|first=Manuel|title=The Rise of the Network Society|year=1996|publisher=Blackwell Publishers Ltd.|location=Malden, MA|isbn=978-1557866172|pages=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, a global economy becomes characterized by fundamental social inequalities with respect to the "level of integration, competitive potential and share of the benefits from economic growth".&lt;ref name="CastellsManuel"&gt;{{cite book|last=Castells|first=Manuel|title=The Rise of the Network Society|year=1996|publisher=Blackwell Publishers Ltd.|location=Malden, MA|isbn=978-1557866172|pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castells cites a kind of "double movement"  where on one hand, "valuable segments of territories and people" become "linked in the global networks of value making and wealth appropriation", while, on the other, "everything and everyone" that is not valued by established networks gets "switched off...and ultimately discarded".&lt;ref name="CastellsManuel" /&gt; The wide-ranging effects of [[global capitalism]] ultimately affect everyone on the planet, as economies around the world come to depend on the functioning of global financial markets, technologies, trade and labor.

{{primarysources|date=July 2010}}
The '''European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection''' ('''EPCIP''') refers to the doctrine and programmes created to identify and protect [[critical infrastructure]] that, in case of fault, incident or attack, could seriously impact both the country where it is hosted and at least one other [[Member State of the European Union|European Member State]]. 

== History ==
The EPCIP came about as a result of a consultation in 2004 by the [[European Council]], seeking a programme to protect critical infrastructure through its 'Communication on Critical Infrastructure Protection in the Fight against Terrorism'. In December 2004 it endorsed the intention of the [[European Commission]] to propose a European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection (EPCIP) and agreed to the creation of a European Critical Infrastructure Warning Information Network (CIWIN). 
In December the European Commission issued its finalised design as a directive EU COM(2006) 786; this obliged all member states to adopt the components of the EPCIP into their national statutes. Not only did it apply to main area of the [[European Union]] but also to the wider [[European Economic Area]].

EPCIP also identified National Critical Infrastructure (NCI) where its disruption would only affect a single Member State. It set the responsibility for protecting items of NCI on its owner/operators and on the relevant Member State, and encouraged each Member State to establish its own National CIP programme.

'''Family policy councils''' are groups that work to influence government policy on families. Most are nonprofit and volunteer-based,{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} and most are within the [[United States]] or one particular state. However, several groups exist in the [[English language|English-speaking world]]. Family policy councils may conduct policy analysis, foster strategic leadership involvement, promote an informed citizenry, provide resources for families, and seek to influence public opinion.

Many family policy councils are [[Conservatism|conservative]], religious, state-level organizations dedicated to the promotion of their ideals on [[family values]]; many of these work closely with [[Focus on the Family]] and the [[Family Research Council]] and oppose same-sex marriage. Some also advocate on other issues, such as the Florida Family Policy Council against the teaching of [[evolution]] in public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.flfamily.org/uploadfile/2008%20-%20upload/Coalition%20Letter%20-%20Final.pdf |title=To the Members of the Florida Board of Education |publisher=Family Policy Council |date=February 7, 2008 |first= |last= |accessdate=2008-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320155751/http://www.flfamily.org/uploadfile/2008%20-%20upload/Coalition%20Letter%20-%20Final.pdf |archivedate=March 20, 2009 }} Letter from Florida Family Policy Council to the [[Florida Board of Education]]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also a number of more liberal family policy organizations that conduct similar operations to their conservative counterparts toward the promotion of rights and resources for different types of families, such as those formed by interracial parents, same-sex partners, and single parents.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

'''''Grass: History of Marijuana''''' is a 1999 Canadian [[documentary film]] directed by [[Ron Mann]], premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto Film Festival]], about the history of the [[United States]] government's war on [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] in the 20th century. The film was narrated by actor [[Woody Harrelson]].

==Overview==
[[Image:Map-of-US-state-cannabis-decriminalization-laws2.svg|thumb|left|260px|The film presents this map of US states with non-medical marijuana decriminalization laws. {{legend|green|State-level but not federal decriminalization of non-medical marijuana}} {{legend|gray|No federal or state level decriminalization of non-medical marijuana}}]]The film follows the history of US federal policies and social attitudes towards marijuana, beginning at the turn of the twentieth century. The history presented is broken up into parts, approximately the length of a decade, each of which is introduced by paraphrasing the official attitude towards marijuana at the time (e.g. "Marijuana will make you insane" or "Marijuana will make you addicted to heroin"), and closed by providing a figure for the amount of money spent during that period on the "[[War on Drugs|war on marijuana]]."

The film places much of the blame for marijuana criminalization on [[Harry J. Anslinger|Harry Anslinger]] (the first American drug czar) who promoted false information about marijuana to the American public as a means towards abolition. It later shows how the federal approach to criminalization became more firmly entrenched after [[Richard Nixon]] declared a "[[War on Drugs]]" and created the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] in 1973, and even more so a decade later and on, as [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Nancy Reagan]] introduced the "[[Just Say No]]" campaign and [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H.W. Bush]] accelerated the War on Drugs. The film ends during the [[Bill Clinton]] administration, which had accelerated spending even further on the War on Drugs.

''Grass'' is almost completely composed of archival footage, much of which is from [[public domain]] [[United States|U.S.]] [[propaganda film]]s and such feature films as ''[[Reefer Madness]]'' made available by the [[Prelinger Archives]]. [[Woody Harrelson]] agreed to narrate the film free-of-charge.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The art director and poster designer of the film was [[Paul Mavrides]].

==Critical reception==
The film was generally well received by critics, scoring 64 out of 100 in [[Metacritic]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/grass?q=Grass Grass (2000): Reviews&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and 71% 'fresh' on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1097829-grass/ Movie Reviews, Trailers, Pictures - Rotten Tomatoes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The film became a cult hit within the cannabis subculture.

The film has also won Canada's [[Genie Award]] for Best Documentary.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

'''''Finance'''''

In 1998 Belo-Osagie became the chairman of the board of directors of The [[United Bank for Africa|United Bank for Africa Plc]] (the "UBA"), one of the largest commercial banks in Nigeria. He resigned from this post in March 2004, in the wake of unsubstantiated allegations made by The [[Central Bank of Nigeria]] (the "CBN") that the UBA had been involved in unlicensed foreign exchange trading. As a result of these allegations, Belo-Osagie was immediately blacklisted by the CBN. In 2005, local reports suggested that the Nigerian [[Economic and Financial Crimes Commission]] had launched an investigation into Belo-Osagie's chairmanship of the UBA. No criminal charges were ever filed against him. On 24 May 2010 the CBN acknowledged its actions to have been unduly punitive, and removed Belo-Osagie from its blacklist with immediate effect.

The '''Hanfparade''' ({{lang-en|'''Hemp Parade'''}}) is a [[hemp]] legalization [[Demonstration (people)|demonstration]] in [[Berlin]]. It has taken place each year in August since 1997.

The traditional course of the parade floats make a prelude through the German capital. In a demonstration, thousands give [[hemp]] and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] their attention. At the end of the demonstration a closing speech takes place.

The parade offers a variety of hemp-related entertainment. The main stage offers mixes of speeches and live-music. National and international musicians entertain the visitors, which often includes high-ranking personalities from politics, culture, medicine and the legalization movement. In the speakers corner an open microphone waits for contributions.

The demonstrations so far have always been peaceful, which may be because the police rarely pursue offenses against cannabis possession laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2016==
The 20th anniversary of the Hanfparade took place on August 13, 2016. The motto was "Legalization is in the air".

==2010==
The next Hanfparade took place on Saturday August 7, 2010. It started at 1:00 p.m. with a speech between TV tower and railway station Alexanderplatz in Berlin under the slogan "Cannabis is (World) Culture". The Hanfparade requests that the entire hemp culture, both the art of using hemp as raw material, as food, as stimulant and as medicine, is allocated to the intangible cultural heritage of UNESCO and removed from the present authorities, which are focused solely on criminal prosecution.

==2009==
Hanfparade took place August 1, 2009 in Berlin. The motto was "For free choice". The demonstration started at Alexanderplatz and went to Brandenburger Tor.

==2008==
The 12th Hanfparade took place on August 2, 2008 from TV Tower at Alexanderplatz to  Leipziger Platz, next to Potsdamer Platz. The motto was "Youth protection, Consumer protection, Legalize".

==2007==
The 11th Hanfparade took place on August 25, 2007 in Berlin.&lt;ref name="hanfparade"&gt;[http://www.hanfparade.de Hanfparade website].&lt;/ref&gt;

==2006==
The 10th Hanfparade took place on August 5, 2006 in Berlin. It took place under the motto, "Legalization now! Reorient your opinion instead of giving billions away!" and led a march down [[Unter den Linden]] to the [[Brandenburg Gate|Brandenburger Tor]] from the [[Alexanderplatz]] across the Oranienburger. Intermediate demonstrations took place in front of [[Kunsthaus Tacheles]] and the British embassy. Approximately 1500 participants took part in the parade. At the Brandenburger Gate there was a hemp market with several hemp panels and hemp plants. The police managed to cut several thousand hemp plants down at the Brandenburger Gate, although the organizers had permission for it. At the conclusion of the demonstration there was a six-hour closing speech at the [[:de:Platz des 18. März|Platz des 18. März]].

==2005==
[[Image:Hanfparade2005.jpg|thumb|left|Banner of the Hanfparade 2005]]

The Hanfparade took place on August 13, 2005 in Berlin. It took place under the motto, "We are the hemp!"&amp;mdash;a play on the slogan ''"[[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|Wir sind das Volk!]]"'' used by the East Germans before the opening of the [[inner German border]]. The demonstration started at 12:00 at the city hall [[Rotes Rathaus]] accompanied by five parade floats and by the citizens of Berlin city center. The parade was again smaller than in the previous years with 1000 to 1200 participants. This was because (among other things) the closing speech was forbidden at short notice by the office responsible for green area.

The police enacted substantial controls and wrote 24 announcements because of offenses against the ''[[:de:Betäubungsmittelgesetz (Deutschland)|BtMG]]'' (German narcotic law).

==2004==
The Hanfparade took place on August 14, 2004 at the Alexanderplatz in Berlin at 12:00. About 3,500 people attended the demonstration, and at the meeting area about 8000 were present.

==2003==
The Hanfparade began  at 12:00 on August 23, 2003 with a 60-minute demonstration before the [[Federal Ministry of Finance (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Finance]] at the William route (between Leipziger road and Niederkirchnerstrasse) in Berlin. The parade of 13 floats ran peacefully. There were announcements however due to offenses against the Betäubungsmittelgesetz.

About 5,000 demonstrators, including [[Hans-Christian Ströbele]] (a [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green Party]] member of the German [[Bundestag]]), representatives of the Green Party Youths, [[The Left Party.PDS|The Left Party]] and the [[Grey Panthers Party of Germany|Grey Panthers Party]], participated in the demonstration.

==2002==
[[Image:Hanfparade2002.jpg|thumb|Hanfparade 2002]]

The 2002 Hanfparade included a march to the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]] with about 10,000 people. The participants motto was "For hemp use! Against hemp abuse! Education instead of prohibition!"

An excerpt from a speech of Hans Christian Ströbele was used in the song ''Gebt das Hanf frei!'' from [[Stefan Raab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2001==
"No war against plants" was the slogan of the 5th Hanfparade. The visitors celebrated with a party before marching on the Berlin City Hall. "I'm a stoner and it is good to be it!", people were saying.

==2000==
[[Image:Hanfparade2000.jpg|thumb|upright|Hanfparade 2000 at the Brandenburg Gate]]

For the [[millennium]] ''Hanfparade'' participants from all over the world demanded, "Legalize it globally." Only a storm could impair the good tendency of 10,000 of the participants somewhat.

==1999==
Hopes of a new and better millennium drove several tens of thousands of people to the hemp parade. Their motto was, "Into the future with hemp." For the first time, representatives of all parties except the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] spoke.

==1998==
In the election year, nearly 50,000 people flew into Berlin under the slogan, "The fight continues," they demanded the legalization of hemp from the new Federal Government.

==1997==
Ten thousand followed the call "of the Herumschweifenden Haschrebellen" and H.A.N.F., a registered association for the first country wide demonstration for hemp. With their route to the Brandenburger Gate they demanded "Legalization now!"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15975">The '''Herzegovina lobby''' or '''Herzegovinian lobby''' ([[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] and {{lang-hr|Hercegovački lobi}}) is a disputed term that emerged in [[Croatia]] in the 1990s{{sfn|Dodig|2005|p=144}} for the alleged disproportional influence of [[Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Croats]] from the [[Herzegovina]] region of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] on the politics of Croatia.{{sfn|Večernji list|1 July 2005}} At times it has been described it as a major factor in contemporary Croatian politics{{sfn|Toal|Dahlman|2011|p=63}} and the most powerful lobby in Croatia,{{sfn|Cvijetić|31 January 2000}} it is also viewed as a [[stereotype]],{{sfn|Katuranić|1995|p=267}} pejorative,{{sfn|Zarez|4 February 2010}} and nonexistent.{{sfn|Večernji list|1 July 2005}}

Proponents of the existence of such a lobby claim that it helped fund Croatia's war-time president [[Franjo Tuđman]], his [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) political party, and his involvement in the [[Bosnian War]], during which the lobby openly advocated annexing Herzegovina.{{sfn|Saideman|Ayres|2012|pp=64-6}} During the Bosnian War, Croats in Herzegovina, were more interested in unifying with Croatia than being a part of an independent [[Bosniak]]-dominated Bosnia and Herzegovina. Due to the strength of the Herzegovina lobby in [[Zagreb]], moderate Bosnian Croats were mostly ineffective in influencing Croatian foreign policy on Bosnia and Herzegovina. Many extremists from Herzegovina served in the Croatian police force and to participate in [[Log Revolution|skirmishes]] with Serbs.{{sfn|Saideman|Ayres|2012|pp=64-6}} By late 1991 about 20,000 Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina, mostly from the Herzegovina region, enlisted in the [[Croatian National Guard]].{{sfn|Hockenos|2003|pp=91-2}}

The Herzegovina lobby's bonding in Croatia began with Tuđman's ouster of [[Stjepan Kljuić]], the moderate and independent elected leader of the Bosnian branch of the HDZ, and replacement with [[Mate Boban]].{{sfn|Lampe|2000|p=376}}{{sfn|Gow|1997|p=82}}{{sfn|Toal|Dahlman|2011|p=68}} Boban, who favored Croatia to annex Croat-inhabited parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina,{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=343}}{{sfn|Tanner|2001|p=286}} was in charge of advancing the lobby's agenda in Bosnia and Herzegovina.{{sfn|Toal|Dahlman|2011|p=103}} A rift existed in the HDZ between Croats from ethnically mixed areas of central and northern Bosnia and those from Herzegovina.{{sfn|Hockenos|2003|p=92}} After Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina gained the ability to vote in Croatia's elections they played a growing role in the country's politics.{{sfn|Saideman|Ayres|2012|pp=64-6}} The approximately 365,000 Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina consistently voted for the HDZ.{{sfn|Bellamy|2003|p=73}} In the 1994 elections, the Croatian diaspora received twelve to fourteen of the 164 seats in the [[Croatian Parliament]], significantly larger than its share of Croatia's population.{{sfn|Saideman|Ayres|2012|pp=64-6}} The lobby was accused of behaving in a Mafia-like manner due to their corruption and violence in Croatia.{{sfn|Bellamy|2003|p=93}}

[[Gojko Šušak]], who believed in a [[Greater Croatia]],{{sfn|Toal|Dahlman|2011|p=63}} played a vital role in funding the HDZ.{{sfn|Søberg|2007|p=59}} He was considered the leader of the Herzegovina lobby{{sfn|Kifner|3 January 1994}}{{sfn|Hedl|16 November 2005}} and was "adept at tapping the purses of the tight-knit Herzegovinian community in the Americas, delivering millions of dollars worth of contributions to Tuđman's campaign." He provided the HDZ a critical advantage over the political opposition and for his efforts became the [[Croatian Minister of Defence]].{{sfn|Saideman|Ayres|2012|p=64}} Several other top positions within the HDZ government were also secured.{{sfn|Bellamy|2003|p=72}} In his position he protected and promoted generals from Herzegovina in the Croatian Army{{sfn|Lukić|2008|p=208}} and acted as a "conduit" of Croatian support for Croat separatism in Bosnia and Herzegovina.{{sfn|Hoare|2010|p=128}} At its peak the amount of money from Croatia that funded the [[Croatian Defence Council]] surpassed $500,000 per day.{{sfn|Ramet|2010|p=265}} After Šušak's death in 1998, [[Ivić Pašalić]] took over as head of the lobby.{{sfn|BBC|11 December 1999}} By 2000, about 300 million euros were transferred by the Croatian government into Herzegovina each year, mostly from the budget of the Ministries of Defence, Reconstruction, and Social Affairs.{{sfn|Grandits|2016|pp=107-8}}

The existence of such a lobby has been widely criticized and described as a [[conspiracy theory]],{{sfn|Sadkovich|2010|pp=247}} as it "never existed, but was created as a figment of someone's imagination and the belief that the politicians in Zagreb originating from Herzegovina aided their homeland."{{sfn|Večernji list|1 July 2005}} Croatian-American historian James J. Sadkovich wrote that "claims that the Croatian president was manipulated by Šušak and a "Herzegovina lobby" are as difficult to document as allegations that the Croatian diaspora made HDZ policy."{{sfn|Sadkovich|2007|pp=217}} After the international recognition of Croatia in January 1992, the Herzegovinian identity in some media worsened and stereotype views were promoted.{{sfn|Dodig|2005|p=144}} Political opponents of Tuđman spread animosity towards Herzegovina and Herzegovinians. After a failed coup by [[Stjepan Mesić]] and [[Josip Manolić]] in the HDZ in 1993, Manolić accused the "Herzegovina lobby" for everything wrong in the party.{{sfn|Lučić|2005|p=58-59}} Such views were fueled by the weekly [[Feral Tribune]] which denigrated Herzegovina in its texts.{{sfn|Lučić|2005|p=63}} The anti-Herzegovinian hysteria reached a culmination on the eve and aftermath of the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2000|2000 parliamentary election]].{{sfn|Večernji list|12 July 2006}} However, after 2000 the imposed stereotypes and usage of the term decreased.{{sfn|Dodig|2005|p=144}}

'''Insurgence Records''' is a Canadian-based [[independent record label]] founded in 2000. The street music label specializes in [[rock music]] subgenres associated with the [[skinhead]] [[subculture]], including [[Oi!]], [[street punk]] and [[hardcore punk|hardcore]]. Insurgence Records releases recordings from established acts and up-and-comers. 

The original compilation series that marked the formative years of the label, ''Class Pride World Wide'' sums up the label's pro-[[working class]] and [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] stance, as well as the label's role of providing a platform for the progressive aspects of the skinhead subculture. A partial list of bands on the label include: [[Angelic Upstarts]] (England), Bishops Green (Canada), The Bois (Singapore),  [[The Oppressed]] (Wales), The Prowlers (Canada), [[Razors in the Night]] (United States) and Stage Bottles (Germany)

'''Ixtoc-Alfa''' is a counter-terrorism base created by the [[Military of Mexico|Mexican Navy]] for the purpose of preventing terrorist attacks on the country's [[Gulf of Mexico]] oilfields. It was first opened on 22 December 2003. 

The base is located on the [[Campeche Bank]], a coastal shelf off the [[Yucatán Peninsula]].  The base currently has a [[Mil Mi-17|MI-17]] MBT helicopter, 90H Fast patrol Boats. A special group named ASIES also provides security for better coverage and quick response in case of sabotage or if there is an unidentified vessel in the area. The area is permanently patrolled by [[Sa'ar 4.5 class missile boat]] navy vessels. [[Grumman]] [[E-2 Hawkeye]] early-alert planes also add up to the task.

He entered [[Vanderbilt University]] in Nashville at the age of fifteen, graduating first in his class in 1909.&lt;ref name="illinois"/&gt; His philosophy professor was [[Collins Denny]], later a Bishop of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church, South]].&lt;ref name="thewary"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rubin |first= Louis Decimus |date=1978 |title=The Wary Fugitives: Four Poets and the South |location=Baton Rouge, Louisiana |publisher=Louisiana State University Press |pages=10–11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IpU-_00_ePsC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=%22Herbert+charles+Sanborn%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=g9jpENRg5u&amp;sig=l12WVVduc_mLW4pmnmzhu1-u0dw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAjgKahUKEwj4vLW3i4DIAhVCRxoKHZ23CcE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Herbert%20charles%20Sanborn%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ransom interrupted his studies for two years to teach sixth and seventh grades at the Taylorsville High School in [[Taylorsville, Mississippi]], followed by teaching [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] at the Haynes-McLean School in [[Lewisburg, Tennessee]].&lt;ref name="illinois"/&gt; After teaching one more year in Lewisburg, he was selected as a [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholar]].&lt;ref name="illinois"/&gt; He attended [[Christ Church, Oxford]], 1910–13, where he read [[Greats]].&lt;ref name="illinois"/&gt;

===Career===
He taught Latin for one year at the [[Hotchkiss School]] alongside [[Samuel Claggett Chew]] (1888–1960).&lt;ref name="illinois"/&gt; He was then appointed to the English department at [[Vanderbilt University]] in 1914. During the [[World War I|First World War]], he served as an [[artillery]] officer in [[France]].&lt;ref name="illinois"/&gt; After the war, he returned to Vanderbilt.&lt;ref name="illinois"/&gt; He was a founding member of the [[Fugitives (poets)|Fugitives]], a Southern literary group of sixteen writers that functioned primarily as a kind of poetry workshop and included [[Donald Davidson (poet)|Donald Davidson]], [[Allen Tate]], and [[Robert Penn Warren]]. Under their influence, Ransom, whose first interest had been philosophy (specifically [[John Dewey]] and American [[pragmatism]]) began writing poetry. His first volume of poems, ''Poems about God'' (1919), was praised by [[Robert Frost]] and [[Robert Graves]]. The Fugitive Group had a special interest in [[Modernist poetry]] and, under Ransom's editorship, started a short-lived but highly influential magazine, called ''The Fugitive'', which published American Modernist poets, mainly from the South (though they also published Northerners like [[Hart Crane]]). Out of all the Fugitive poets, Norton poetry editors Richard Ellmann and Robert O'Clair opined that, "[Ransom's poems were] among the most remarkable," characterizing his poetry as "quirky" and "at times eccentric."&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann, Richard and Robert O'Clair, eds. ''The Norton Anthology of Poetry''. Second Edition. New York: W. W. Norton Co., 1973. 467.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, alongside eleven other [[Southern Agrarians]], he published the conservative, [[agrarianism|Agrarian]] manifesto ''I'll Take My Stand: The South and the Agrarian Tradition'', which assailed the tide of [[industrialism]] that appeared to be sweeping away traditional Southern culture.&lt;ref&gt;Conkin, Paul K. The Southern Agrarians. Knoxville, TN: University of Tennessee Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; The Agrarians believed that the Southern tradition, rooted in the pre-Civil War agricultural model, was the answer to the South's economic and cultural problems. His contribution to ''I'll Take My Stand'' is his essay ''Reconstructed but Unregenerate'' which starts the book and lays out the Southern Agrarians' basic argument. In various essays influenced by his Agrarian beliefs, Ransom defended the manifesto's assertion that modern industrial capitalism was a dehumanizing force that the South should reject in favor of an agrarian economic model. However, by the late 1930s he began to distance himself from the movement, and in 1945, he publicly criticized it.&lt;ref&gt;Conkin, Paul K. ''The Southern Agrarians''. Knoxville, TN: University of Tennessee Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; He remained an active essayist until his death even though, by the 1970s, the popularity and influence of the New Critics had seriously diminished.

In 1937, he accepted a position at [[Kenyon College]] in [[Gambier, Ohio]].&lt;ref name="illinois"/&gt; He was the founding editor of the ''[[Kenyon Review]]'', and continued as editor until his retirement in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Daniel Young, ''Gentleman in a Dustcoat: A Biography of John Crowe Ransom,'' Louisiana State University Press, Southern Literary Studies Series, January 1977, pp. 428–30. {{ISBN|0-8071-0255-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, he was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]].

He has few peers among twentieth-century American university teachers of humanities; his distinguished students included [[Donald Davidson (poet)|Donald Davidson]], [[Randall Jarrell]], [[George Lanning]], [[Robert Lowell]], [[Andrew Nelson Lytle|Andrew Lytle]], [[Allen Tate]], [[Peter Matthew Hillsman Taylor|Peter Taylor]], [[Robie Macauley]], [[Robert Penn Warren]], [[E.L. Doctorow]], [[Cleanth Brooks]],  [[Richard M. Weaver]], [[James Wright (poet)|James Wright]], and [[Constantinos Patrides]] (himself a Rhodes Scholar, who dedicated his monograph on John Milton's ''[[Lycidas]]'' to Ransom's memory). His literary reputation is based chiefly on two collections of poetry, ''Chills and Fever'' (1924) and ''Two Gentlemen in Bonds'' (1927).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Daniel Young, ''John Crowe Ransom: an annotated bibliography,'' (Modern Critics and Critical Schools). Volume 3 of Garland, bibliographies of modern critics and critical schools. Volume 354 of Garland reference library of the humanities. Garland Publishing Co., 1982. {{ISBN|0-8240-9249-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/968552087|title=James Wright : a life in poetry|last=Jonathan,|first=Blunk,|isbn=9780374178598|edition=First |location=New York|oclc=968552087}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Believing he had no new themes upon which to write, his subsequent poetic activity consisted almost entirely of revising ("tinkering", he called it) his earlier poems.  Hence Ransom's reputation as a poet is based on the fewer than 160 poems he wrote and published between 1916 and 1927. In 1963, the poet/critic and former Ransom student [[Randall Jarrell]] published an essay in which he highly praised Ransom's poetry: &lt;blockquote&gt; In John Crowe Ransom's best poems every part is subordinated to the whole, and the whole is accomplished with astonishing exactness and thoroughness. Their economy, precision, and restraint gives the poems, sometimes, an original yet impersonal perfection. . .And sometimes their phrasing is magical--light as air, soft as dew, the real old-fashioned enchantment. The poems satisfy our nostalgia for the past, yet themselves have none. They are reports . .of our world's old war between power and love, between those who efficiently and practically know and those who are "content to feel/ What others understand." And these reports of battles are, somehow, bewitching. . .Ransom's poems profess their limitations so candidly, almost as a principle of style, that it is hardly necessary to say they are not poems of the largest scope or the greatest intensity. But they are some of the most original poems ever written, just as Ransom is one of the best, most original, and most sympathetic poets alive; it is easy to see that his poetry will always be cared for, since he has written poems that are perfectly realized and occasionally almost perfect."&lt;ref&gt;Jarrell, Randall. "Fifty Years of American Poetry." ''No Other Book: Selected Essays''. New York: HarperCollins, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Despite the brevity of his poetic career and output, Ransom won the [[Bollingen Prize for Poetry]] in 1951.  His 1963 ''Selected Poems'' received the [[National Book Award]] the following year.&lt;ref name=nba1964&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;(With essay by John Murillo from the Awards 60-year anniversary blog.)&lt;/ref&gt;

He primarily wrote short poems examining the ironic and unsentimental nature of life (with domestic life in the American South being a major theme). An example of his Southern style is his poem "Janet Waking", which "mixes modernist with old-fashioned country rhetoric." &lt;ref&gt;Tillinghast 1997&lt;/ref&gt; He was noted as a strict formalist, using both regular rhyme and meter in almost all of his poems. He also occasionally employed archaic diction. Ellman and O'Clair note that "[Ransom] defends [[Formalism (literature)|formalism]] because he sees in it a check on bluntness, on brutality. Without formalism, he insists, poets simply rape or murder their subjects."
&lt;ref&gt;Ellman, Richard and Robert O'Clair, eds. ''The Norton Anthology of Poetry''. Second Edition. New York: W. W. Norton Co., 1973. 467.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a leading figure of the school of literary criticism known as the [[New Criticism]], which gained its name from his 1941 volume of essays ''The New Criticism''. The New Critical theory, which dominated American literary thought throughout the middle 20th century, emphasized [[close reading]], and criticism based on the texts themselves rather than on non-textual bias or non-textual history. In his seminal 1937 essay, "Criticism, Inc." Ransom laid out his ideal form of literary criticism stating that, "criticism  must become more scientific, or precise and systematic." To this end, he argued that personal responses to literature, historical scholarship, linguistic scholarship, and what he termed "moral studies" should not influence literary criticism. He also argued that literary critics should regard a poem as an aesthetic object.&lt;ref&gt;Ransom, John Crowe. Criticism, Inc." The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism. Ed Vincent Leitch, et al. New York, W. W. Norton Co., 2001. 11108-1118.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the ideas he explained in this essay would become very important in the development of The New Criticism. "Criticism, Inc." and a number of Ransom's other theoretical essays set forth some of the guiding principles that the New Critics would build upon. Still, his former students, specifically [[Allen Tate]], [[Cleanth Brooks]], and [[Robert Penn Warren]], had a greater hand in developing many of the key concepts (like "close reading") that later came to define the New Criticism.

The '''Malaysia Makkal Sakti Party''' ({{lang-ms|Parti Makkal Sakti Malaysia}}; {{lang-ta|மலேசியா மக்கள் சக்தி கட்சி}}) ([[abbreviation|abbrev]]: '''MMSP''') is a political party in [[Malaysia]] that seeks to champion ethnic Malaysian-Indian issues. It is an unaffiliated offshoot of the apolitical [[HINDRAF|Hindu Rights Action Force]] (HINDRAF) movement formed by disgruntled former members and has copied HINDRAF's slogan of People's Power (மக்கள் சக்தி / Makkal Sakti) as the party name.&lt;ref name="offshoot"&gt;{{cite news |title=Makkal Sakti Party - Hindraf cries foul |url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/113631 |work=[[Malaysiakini]] |date=26 September 2009 |last=Fernandez |first=Joe |accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="disfruntled"&gt;{{cite news |title=Makkal Sakti versus Hindraf |url=https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/104691 |work=[[Malaysiakini]] |date=20 May 2009 |last=Veeranggan |first=Athi |accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="launch"&gt;{{cite news|title=Najib launches Malaysia Makkal Sakti Party |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2009/10/10/nation/20091010142842&amp;sec=nation |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |date=10 October 2009 |last=Loh |first=Foon Fong |accessdate=21 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804234450/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2009%2F10%2F10%2Fnation%2F20091010142842&amp;sec=nation |archivedate=4 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Executive}}
A '''minister''' is a [[politician]] who heads a [[Ministry (government department)|government department]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/minister|title=Minister|work=Oxford Dictionary|accessdate=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/es/diccionario/ingles/minister|title=Minister|work=Collins Dictionary|accessdate=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; making and implementing decisions on policies in conjunction with the other ministers. In some jurisdictions the [[head of government]] is also a minister and is designated the "[[prime minister]]", "premier", "chief minister", "Chancellor" or other title. 

In [[Commonwealth realm]] jurisdictions which use the [[Westminster system]] of government, ministers are usually required to be members of one of the houses of [[Parliament]] or [[legislature]], and are usually from the political party that controls a majority in the lower house of the legislature. In other jurisdictions — such as [[Belgium]], [[Mexico]], [[Netherlands]], [[Philippines]] — the holder of a cabinet-level post or other government official is not permitted to be a member of the legislature. Depending on the administrative arrangements in each jurisdiction, ministers are usually heads of a [[Ministry (government department)|government department]] and members of the government's ministry, [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] and perhaps of a committee of cabinet. Some ministers may be more senior than others, and some may hold the title "assistant minister" or "deputy minister". Some jurisdictions, with a large number of ministers, may designate ministers to be either in the inner or outer ministry or cabinet.

In some jurisdictions — such as [[Hong Kong]], the [[Philippines]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]] — holders of an equivalent cabinet-level post are called [[Secretary (title)|secretaries]] (e.g., the [[Home Secretary]] in the United Kingdom, [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] in the United States). Some holders of a cabinet-level post may have another title, such as "[[Attorney-General]]" or "[[Postmaster-General]]".

==Etymology==
The term "minister" also is used in diplomacy, for a diplomat of the [[Diplomatic rank|second class]], such as in the title  [[Minister Plenipotentiary]], ranking between an [[Ambassador]] and a [[Minister Resident]].

The term minister comes from [[Middle English]], deriving from the [[Old French]] word ''ministre'', originally ''minister'' in [[Latin]], meaning "servant, attendant", which itself was derived from the word 'minus' meaning "less".&lt;ref&gt;The word [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/minister Minister] Definition, dictionary.com dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}
In jurisdictions that use the [[Westminster system]] of government — such as the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]] — ministers or their equivalents are selected from the legislature, and usually from the political party that controls a majority in the lower house of the legislature. In jurisdictions with strict [[separation of powers]], ministers cannot be members of the legislature — such as [[Belgium]], [[Mexico]], [[Netherlands]], [[Philippines]], [[United States]] — and a legislator chosen to become a minister must resign from the legislature. 

Normally the leader of the [[majority party]] becomes the [[prime minister]], or an office of equivalent function, and selects the other ministers. In the Westminster system, these ministers continue to represent their [[constituency]] in parliament while being part of the government. Often, a person from the outside may be appointed minister, usually in order to bring special skills to the government. Such a person would not have to be part of the parliament while serving as minister, nor would he/she necessarily be a member of the party/parties in government.

==Types of ministers and name==
Various countries form ministries as [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]]s (see [[List of cabinets]]). Other cabinets are usually included in [[List of politics by country articles|''Politics of ..''-articles]]

* [[Lists of incumbents]] groups lists of ministers by country

Specific ministers include:

Some ministers may hold multiple portfolios and lead several ministries simultaneously, while multiple ministers with separate portfolios may oversee a single ministry, or may also share both ministerial and deputy-ministerial portfolios in different ministries. A cabinet minister may not be in charge of any ministry, and is then known as a "[[minister without portfolio]]".

[[File:Sdema.JPG|thumb|[[Shdema]]]]
[[File:Neve Michael, moshav.jpg|thumb|Moshav [[Neve Michael]]]]
'''Moshav''' ({{lang-he-n|מוֹשָׁב}}, plural {{Hebrew|מוֹשָׁבִים}} ''{{transl|he|moshavim}}'', lit. ''settlement, village'') is a type of [[Israel]]i town or settlement, in particular a type of [[cooperative]] [[agricultural]] [[community]] of individual farms [[settler|pioneer]]ed by the [[Labor Zionism|Labour Zionist]]s during the [[Second Aliyah|second wave of ''aliyah'']]. A resident or a member of a moshav can be called a "moshavnik" ({{Hebrew|מוֹשַׁבְנִיק}}).

The moshavim are similar to [[kibbutzim]] with an emphasis on community labour. They were designed as part of the Zionist state-building programme following the green revolution  [[Yishuv]] ("settlement") in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] during the early 20th century, but in contrast to the [[Collective farming|collective]] kibbutzim, farms in a moshav tended to be individually owned but of fixed and equal size. Workers produced [[agriculture|crops]] and [[good (accounting)|goods]] on their properties through individual and/or pooled [[labour (economics)|labour]] and [[Natural resource|resources]] and used [[Profit (economics)|profit]] and foodstuffs to provide for themselves. Moshavim are governed by an elected council ({{lang-he|ועד}}, ''va'ad'', lit. ''committee''). Community projects and facilities were financed by a special tax ({{lang-he|מס ועד}}, ''mas va'ad'', lit. ''committee tax''). This tax was equal for all households of the community, thus creating a system where good farmers were better off than bad ones, unlike in the communal kibbutzim where (at least theoretically) all members enjoyed the same living standard.

==Different types==
There are several variants, of which the most common are:

* ''Moshav ovdim'' ({{lang-he-n|מושב עובדים}}, lit. ''workers' moshav''), a workers' cooperative settlement. This is the more numerous (405) type and relies on cooperative purchasing of supplies and marketing of produce; the family or household is, however, the basic [[unit of production]] and consumption. 
* ''[[Moshav shitufi]]'' ({{lang-he-n|מושב שיתופי}}, lit. ''collective moshav''), a collective smallholders' settlement that combines the economic features of a [[kibbutz]] with the social features of a moshav. Farming is done collectively and profits are shared equally. This form is closer to the collectivity of the kibbutz: although consumption is family- or household-based, production and marketing are collective. Unlike the moshav ovdim, land is not allotted to households or individuals, but is collectively worked.

==History==
[[Image:נהלל_-_זאב_שטיין.jpg|thumb|right|Moshav [[Nahalal]] in [[Jezreel Valley]]]]
The first moshav, [[Nahalal]], was established in the [[Jezreel Valley]] (also known as the Valley of Esdraelon) on September 11, 1921. By 1986 about 156,700 Israelis lived and worked on 448 moshavim; the great majority of these are divided among eight federations.&lt;!-- Is there a federation link? --&gt;

Because the moshav organisation retained the family as the centre of social life, it was much more attractive to traditional [[Mizrahi Jews|Mizrahi]] immigrants in the 1950s and early 1960s; they eschewed bold experiments, like communal child-rearing or equality of the sexes, practiced by the more radical communal kibbutz. These so-called "immigrants' moshav" ({{lang-he|מושב עולים}}, ''moshav olim'') were one of the most-used and successful forms of absorption and integration of Oriental immigrants; it allowed them a much steadier ascent into the [[middle class]] than did life in some [[development town]]s.  For this reason, the moshav became largely a Mizrahi institution, whereas the [[kibbutz]] movement remained basically an [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] institution.

Since the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, both moshavim and kibbutzim have relied increasingly on outside—including [[Palestinians|Palestinian]]—labour. Financial instabilities in the early 1980s hit many moshavim hard, as did their high birth rate and the problem of absorbing all the children who might wish to remain in the community. By the late 1980s, moshav members increasingly came to be employed in non-agricultural sectors outside the community, so that some moshavim began to resemble [[suburb]]s or [[commuter town]]s whose residents commute to work. In general, moshavim never enjoyed the "political elite" status afforded to kibbutzim during the period of [[Israeli Labor Party]] dominance; correspondingly the moshavim did not endure the decline in prestige experienced by kibbutzim in the 1970s and 1980s, during the period of [[Likud]] dominance starting in 1977.

'''Musalaha''' ([[Hebrew]]: מוסאלחה, [[Arabic]]: مصالحة) is a [[non-profit organization]] that works towards reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians based on the Biblical principles of peace, justice, and love. The name ''Musalaha'' comes from the Arabic word for 'reconciliation'. The mission statement from their official website states: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"Musalaha is a non-profit organization that seeks to promote reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians as demonstrated in the life and teaching of Jesus. We seek to be an encouragement and facilitator of reconciliation, first among Palestinian Christians and Messianic Israelis, and then beyond to our respective communities."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It also states that Musalaha seeks "to facilitate bridge building among different segments of the Israeli and Palestinian societies according to biblical reconciliation principles." [http://www.musalaha.org]

Musalaha partners with a number of different organization around the world, such as Reconciliation Ministries in the United States,[http://www.bereconciled.org] and Amzi in Germany and Switzerland,[http://www.amzi.org/] as well with local Palestinian and Israeli organizations. Musalaha's Board members are all [[Messianic Jewish]] Israeli and [[Palestinian Christian]] leaders in [[Israel]] and the [[Palestinian Territories]].

==History of Musalaha==

Musalaha was founded in 1990, when unity among Israeli and Palestinian believers was especially lacking due to the ''[[First Intifada]]''. Dr. Salim J. Munayer, an Israeli-Palestinian from [[Lod]], relates how this lack of unity was recognized by leaders from both sides. In response they "founded Musalaha as a vehicle to bring people into the process of Biblical reconciliation".&lt;ref&gt;Salim J. Munayer, "On the Road to Reconciliation", taken from ''In the Footsteps of our Father Abraham'', Edited by Salim J. Munayer Ph.D. (Art Plus, 1993, 2002) pg. 81-82&lt;/ref&gt; Their vision was to create a neutral space for [[Messianic Jewish]] Israelis and [[Palestinian Christians]] to meet with each other, and receive training in reconciliation. &lt;br /&gt;Musalaha began by taking groups of Palestinians and Israelis on trips to the desert, which thanks to its isolation, is an ideal location for this type of encounter. Munayer articulated this vision when he said, "I would like to try taking groups of people from both sides out into the desert for three days. I believe that when they are away from their normal surroundings, in a situation where they must work together, we can begin to break down the barriers and build a trust relationship."&lt;ref&gt;Brother Andrew and Al Janssen, ''Light Force, The Only Hope for the Middle East'', (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 2004) pg. 127&lt;/ref&gt; From its small, grass-roots beginning, Musalaha has grown into a thriving, locally and internationally recognized entity, and has developed a large variety of reconciliation-based activities. &lt;br /&gt;While not ignoring the divisive political and theological issues such as Theology of the Land, Justice, [[Israeli settlements]], and [[Palestinian terrorist]] attacks, Musalaha seeks to bring both sides together and develop friendships, before undertaking the difficult task of discussing them. In the words of Salim J. Munayer,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"As we founded Musalaha we knew that we had to deal with those issues, but also understood that Musalaha had to find a safe forum where people could develop relationships, and then express, exchange, learn, and debate the issues that divide us. Many wanted to deal with the issues right away without understanding the importance of the process: that these issues will be dealt with in proper time and manner, in the context of developed relationships."&lt;ref&gt;Munayer, "On the Road to Reconciliation", from ''In the Footsteps of Our Father Abraham'', pg. 83&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;The strategy for developing these foundational relationships, according to Munayer, was to bring both sides together. "I came to the conclusion that the theology of reconciliation was the best theology to deal with all these issues, and that more than anything else, the Jewish and Palestinian believers needed to be brought together, face to face. Anything less would not work, because of the dehumanization and demonization going on from both sides."&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Baker "Forging Biblical Reconciliation Amid Conflict", taken from ''Seeking and Pursuing Peace: The Process, the Pain, and the Product'', Edited by Salim J. Munayer Ph.D. (Yanetz Ltd., 1998) pg. 131-132 [http://www.strategicnetwork.org/index.php?loc=kb&amp;view=v&amp;id=434&amp;fto=3&amp;/] First appeared in [http://www.compassdirect.org/en/display.php/ ''Compass Direct''], August 1, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the early supporters of Musalaha was [[Open Doors]] leader, [[Brother Andrew]]. He wrote of Musalaha, "Of all the ministries in Israel, I found myself drawn most to this one. It seemed the most ambitious but also the riskiest. It wasn't an idea promoted by foreign missionaries but was birthed in the local Christian community. It didn't just talk about the problem between Palestinians and Jews. It brought the two sides together and provided a means for them to reconcile."&lt;ref&gt;Brother Andrew and Al Janssen, ''Light Force'', pg. 126-128, 304&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Work of Nameer==

Nameer has developed a number of different projects, from desert encounters to conferences and training workshops, all designed to bring Israelis and Palestinians together. Officially, Nameer as an organization has no political stance or agenda, however in the words of Salim J. Munayer, &lt;blockquote&gt;
"It would be naive to say that Nameer doesn't have one [a political agenda], because here in Jerusalem we are all involved in politics, as much as breathing or eating. Everything we say and do has political implications...So we do have a political agenda. We want to see nations in the Middle East, and especially the Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs, being reconciled by the gospel. What does that mean? Simply, it means to be reconciled to each other."&lt;ref&gt;Baker, "Forging Biblical Reconciliation Amid Conflict", from ''Seeking and Pursuing Peace'', pg. 133&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In order to bring about this reconciliation, Nameer's list of activities has expanded from desert encounters, to include a variety of other projects. The goal is to expose Israelis and Palestinians of all ages to the message of reconciliation, and to equip them with the tools needed to make this vision a reality.

===Children===
The process of reconciliation is long and hard, however the earlier it is undertaken, the easier it is to make real progress. For children, learning to understand the "[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]" side comes quickly when they have exposure to each other.

Musalaha hosts an annual Children's Summer Camp. This camp is unique in that it brings together Israeli and Palestinian children (ages 9–12) in a friendly, neutral environment. For many of these young children, this camp is their first exposure to anyone from the other side and can be a very formative experience, and have a positive influence on their perceptions of each other.

===Youth===
Musalaha also focuses on developing the ethic of reconciliation among youth. They organize a Youth Desert Encounter once a year, for around 50 Israeli and Palestinian youth, where they receive training in reconciliation, and have a chance to build relationships with each other. It also involves other activities such as hiking and camel riding. The Youth Desert Encounter takes place locally, either in the [[Arabah]] or in the [[Negev]] regions of southern Israel.

===Young adults===
Another annual Musalaha event is Young Adult Desert Encounter, which takes place in [[Wadi Rum]] in Jordan. It is similar to the Youth Desert Encounter, however it usually involves discussion on a higher, more intense level as most of the participants are university students, and many on the Israeli side have already completed their mandatory military service. Musalaha views the young adults as an important demographic to reach, because they are the leaders of the future. The focus for this desert encounter remains reconciliation and relationship building.

===Women===
Musalaha has established a network of women's groups, that bring together Israeli and Palestinian women for fellowship, relationship-building, and reconciliation training. They have a number of annual conferences and seminars that focus on intensive reconciliation training. These women are also encouraged to undertake their own reconciliation activities, as well as humanitarian outreach projects. The focus on women stems from a recognition that they serve as agents of change in their communities, and have significant influence in their capacity as mothers and wives, as well as working members of both the Israeli and Palestinian societies.

===Community leaders===
The leaders of every community have a great amount of influence over others within their society. Musalaha actively seeks out these leaders, from Israeli and Palestinian communities, in order to train them in reconciliation. The assumption is that they will be effective in transforming the perspective of the people around them in a positive way. Numerous conferences and seminars are organized yearly for Community Leaders, and their families.

===Publication===
There are many articles and project reports available on the Musalaha website. Additionally, Musalaha has published a number of books:
*''In the Footsteps of our Father Abraham'', Edited by Salim J. Munayer (Jerusalem: Art Plus, 1993)&lt;br /&gt; This book is a collection of articles by both Messianic Jewish and Palestinian Christian leaders, on the topic of reconciliation, from its Biblical foundations, to its practical application. It also contains reflections and observations made by participants in different Musalaha events.
*''Seeking and Pursuing Peace: the Process, the Pain, and the Product'', Edited by Salim J. Munayer (Jerusalem: Yanetz Ltd., 1998)&lt;br /&gt; This book is a series of articles by Messianic Jewish and Palestinian Christian leaders, such as [[Naim Ateek]] and [[Arnold Fruchtenbaum]], as well as others, on the topic of peace and peacemaking. It also offers a section of articles on Musalaha events.
*''The Bible and the Land: An Encounter'', Edited By Lisa Loden, Peter Walker, and Michael Wood (Musalaha, 2000)&lt;br /&gt; This book is a collection of articles from a number of different contributors and perspectives, on the Theology of the Land.
*''Musalaha Worship, عبادة مصالحة, הלל מוסאלחה'', (Jerusalem: Musalaha, 2004)&lt;br /&gt; This book is a compilation of worship songs in Hebrew and Arabic, collected and published by Musalaha.
*''You Have Heard It Said, Events of Reconciliation'', Jonathan McRay (Eugene: Resource Publications/Wipf &amp; Stock, 2010)&lt;br /&gt; This is a collection of stories written about Israeli and Palestinian Musalaha participants.
*''Journey Through the Storm: Musalaha and the Process of Reconciliation'', Edited By Salim J. Munayer (Beit Jala: NOUR Design and Print Company, 2011)&lt;br /&gt; This book is a collection of articles, interviews and project reports from Musalaha over the last 20 years.

==Musalaha's location==
The Musalaha office is in southern [[Jerusalem]], in the [[Talpiyot]] neighborhood. Participants in  Musalaha activities and events come from all over [[Israel]], as well as from the [[Palestinian Territories]]. Their conferences and seminars take place at various locations around the country, however because it is often difficult to find a place where both Israelis and Palestinians are comfortable, and legally allowed to meet, Musalaha activities often take place in other regional locations such as Jordan, Cyprus, and in Europe.

==Musalaha's supporters==
As a non-profit, non-governmental organization, Musalaha depends on various charitable organizations worldwide that support its work.

'''New Mexico Health Insurance Exchange''', otherwise known as '''BeWellNM''', is the [[health insurance marketplace]] for the U.S. state of New Mexico. The exchange enables people and small businesses to purchase health insurance at federally subsidized rates. 

On Jan 15, 2015 Mike English reported on  [[Albuquerque Business First]] more than 40,000 health insurance signups. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/albuquerque/blog/morning-edition/2015/01/bewellnm-logs-more-than-40-000-health-insurance.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Health insurance exchanges were established as a part of the 2010 [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] to enable individuals to purchase health insurance in state-run marketplaces.&lt;ref name=lewis&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this legislation, states could choose to establish their own health insurance exchanges; if they choose not to do so, the federal government would run one for the state.&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt;

In 2014, actual enrollment for New Mexico will take place on [[Healthcare.gov]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8214">==Local government==
[[Toowoomba, Queensland|Toowoomba]], (governed by the Toowoomba Regional Council), throughout the last twenty years has seen the rapid growth of satellite towns and an expanding urban fringe in the surrounding localities of [[Crows Nest, Queensland|Crows Nest]], [[Cambooya, Queensland|Cambooya]], [[Cooyar, Queensland|Cooyar]] and [[Oakey, Queensland|Oakey]]. Urbanisation has changed the demographics of the Toowoomba Region significantly, displacing their centres of power to the Toowoomba urban fringe.

Former Toowoomba councillor Lyle Shelton called for the boundaries of the old Toowoomba City Council to be expanded to encompass the area some refer to as "Greater Toowoomba"{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}.  March 2008 saw the Toowoomba City Council replaced by the Toowoomba Regional Council.

=== Former Toowoomba City Council ===
The [[City of Toowoomba]] was a [[Local government in Australia|local government area]] in [[Queensland]], approximately {{convert|150|km|mi}} west of [[Brisbane]].

Elections were held every four years (previously every three years) with ballots for the mayoralty and the councillors being held simultaneously. Voting was [[compulsory voting|compulsory]] for all eligible electors. Councillors were elected from a single pool of candidates by a "First Past the Post" poll, Toowoomba having abandoned the system of wards (electorates).

As with other local governments in Queensland, Toowoomba City Council was bound by the ''Local Government Act 1993''. Under this act and other legislation, the state government had devolved the power to make local laws (previously by-laws) onto Toowoomba City Council.

Toowoomba City Council offered a variety of cultural services to the community, including the Municipal Library and the Toowoomba Art Gallery. The council restored and substantially funded the [[Empire Theatre, Toowoomba|Empire Theatre]].

The main offices for the council were at the [[Toowoomba City Hall]] complex clustered around the northwest corner of Ruthven and Herries Streets.

After former [[Premier of Queensland]], [[Peter Beattie]], announced his program of LGA amalgamations in 2007, Toowoomba City Council began the transition to becoming part of the [[Toowoomba Regional Council]]. The March 2008 local government elections marked the end of over a century as a city.

=== Toowoomba Regional Council ===

{{Main|Toowoomba Region}}

A council of 10 councillors and a Mayor are elected every four years, alongside other LGAs in Queensland.  There has been 3 local elections since amalgamation.  Cr Peter Taylor, from the Jondaryan (Oakey) Shire was re-elected as the Mayor to serve for the entire region.  From 2012, Deputy Mayor, Paul Antonio, won the mayoral election.  He subsequently won the 2016 election, therefore being the incumbent Mayor.

The ballots for the mayoralty and the councillors are held simultaneously. Voting is [[compulsory voting|compulsory]] for all eligible electors. Councillors are elected from a single pool of candidates by a "First Past the Post" poll, The system of wards (electorates) being recommended against by the Local Government Reform Commission.

==State politics==
The two seats that are drawn from Toowoomba City itself are [[Electoral district of Toowoomba North|Toowoomba North]] and [[Electoral district of Toowoomba South|Toowoomba South]]. Toowoomba South is a very [[safe seat]] for the [[Liberal National Party of Queensland|Liberal National Party]].  Former mayor, Di Thorley ran for the 2016 Toowoomba South by-election.  In the absence of a Labor candidate, she picked up momentum, especially from the more progressive voters, however, the LNP's David Janetzki won.

In the 2012 election, [[Kerry Shine]], a member of the [[Australian Labor Party (Queensland Branch)|Labor Party]], lost the seat of Toowoomba North to the LNP's Trevor Watts, a member of the [[Campbell Newman|Newman]] government.  Watts, retained the seat by a small majority in the 2016 election.  Unlike the rest of the city, Toowoomba North has been known to be considerably more left-leaning when electing members.

The seat of [[Electoral district of Condamine|Condamine]] is a rural seat that includes many western suburbs and localities, including Charlton, Wellcamp, Glenvale, Drayton etc.  This seat is also conservative, generally electing LNP and Katter's Australian party.  After [[Ray Hopper]] resigned from the seat to contest [[Electoral district of Nanango|Nanango]], Pat Weir from the LNP took the seat by a large majority in 2015.

===Historical seats===
* [[Electoral district of Drayton &amp; Toowoomba|Drayton &amp; Toowoomba]] 1860 – 1912
* [[Electoral district of Drayton|Drayton]] 1912 – 1927
* [[Electoral district of Toowoomba|Toowoomba]] 1912 – 1950
* [[Electoral district of East Toowoomba|East Toowoomba]] 1912 – 1950
* [[Electoral district of South Toowoomba|South Toowoomba]] 1950 – 1960

* [[Electoral district of Toowoomba West|Toowoomba West]] 1960 – 1972

* [[Electoral district of Toowoomba North|Toowoomba North]] 1972–present
* [[Electoral district of Condamine|Condamine]] 2009–present (Outskirts)

==Federal politics==
Toowoomba has formed the core of a Commonwealth electoral seat since [[Australian federation|Federation]]. Originally [[Division of Darling Downs|Darling Downs]], the seat was abolished and the new seat of [[Division of Groom|Groom]] was created in 1984, with the effect (largely) of renaming the seat. The seat has always been held by the non-Labor parties.

[[John McVeigh (politician)|John McVeigh]], a member of the [[Liberal National Party of Queensland|LNP]] has held the seat since 2016.  To contest the 2016 election, he resigned from his state seat of Toowoomba South.

The Toowoomba Region has a strong conservative influence in politics, particularly socially.  Groom is a very safe LNP seat, with McVeigh winning 65.31% of the two-party preferred vote.  Although suburbs between North Street and the Second Range Crossing show strengthening progressive influence, the rural parts of the seat are much too conservative to feasibly see a Labor member elected.

==Significant political events in Toowoomba==
During the 1989 [[Queensland]] State Elections, the Toowoomba-based [[Logos Foundation (Australia)|Logos Foundation]] caused controversy with a questionnaire  on "moral" issues sent to Candidates and the results published in newspaper advertisements.

In 2003 Aboriginal Activist [[Stephen Hagan]] created a stir over the name of the "E.S. Nigger Brown Stand"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/03/19/1016519809826.html Judge rejects bid on 'nigger' sign]&lt;/ref&gt; at a Toowoomba sports field. [[E S Brown]] was an Anglo-Australian, who was known as "Nigger Brown" during his career as a [[rugby league]] footballer. He has also challenged [[Coon cheese]] over claims that the name was racist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,24405098-421,00.html Anti-racism academic cheesed off with Coon]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 a [[white supremacist]] group calling itself the White Pride Coalition put up racist posters in Toowoomba and Crows Nest, harassed African (mostly [[Sudan]]ese) refugees living in Toowoomba and achieved national notoriety.

In 2005 Mayor [[Dianne Thorley|Di Thorley]] proposed a [[Toowoomba Water Futures referendum, 2006|controversial plan]] to recycle [[Water purification|purified]] [[Sewage treatment|treated sewage]] into one of the dams to be used for drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toowoombawater.com.au/ Toowoomba Water Futures]&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 July 2006 Toowoomba City Council conducted a poll regarding this controversial plan. The poll question was:

''Do you support the addition of purified recycled water to Toowoomba’s water supply via Cooby Dam as proposed by Water Futures –Toowoomba?''

A majority of 62% of voters opposed the plan.

'''Rete degli Studenti Medi''' is an Italian [[Secondary school|high-school]] [[students' union]], created 4 October 2008 from three other student associations active in Italy during the first years of the 21st century.:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=E il corteo degli studenti si spacca|url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/SoleOnLine4/Italia/2008/10/corteo-studenti-si-spacca_PRN.shtml|author=Eugenio Bruno|magazine=[[Il Sole 24 Ore]]|date=28 October 2008|accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Rete degli Studenti (ReDS), national association linked to the main Italian Trade union ([[Italian General Confederation of Labour|CGIL]]), was founded in 2007 after a division in the oldest Italian Students'Union ([[Unione degli Studenti|UdS]]) caused by the end of the cooperation between UdS and the [[Italian General Confederation of Labour|CGIL]];
*Idee Studentesche in Movimento (ISIM), link of local associations that had tried to get over the split between ReDS and UdS;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://freelist.it/pipermail/uds/attachments/20071127/3299bca2/attachment-0003.doc |title = Lettera aperta al Coordinamento Nazionale dell'Unione degli Studenti }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://freelist.it/pipermail/uds/attachments/20080621/f8dc96bb/attachment-0001.pdf |title = Lettera dell'Esecutivo Nazionale al Coordinamento Nazionale dell'Unione degli Studenti |date = 21 June 2008 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Studenti di Sinistra (SDS), students'association that supported the [[Democrats of the Left|DS Party]] (Italian Party of Democrats of the Left) before the birth of the Italian Democratic Party.

Rete degli Studenti Medi cooperates with UdU, the main Italian University Students'Union and with [[Italian General Confederation of Labour|CGIL]], the biggest Italian Trade Union, like UdS did before 2006 and ReDS before 2008.

Since 2016, it's a Candidate Association in the [[Organising Bureau of European School Student Unions|OBESSU]], and joins International campaigns and assemblies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.obessu.org/rete-degli-studenti-medi|title=Rete degli Studenti Medi {{!}} Obessu|website=www.obessu.org|access-date=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was part of the National movement "L'Onda" (The Wave) against cuts to the Italian Education System made by the [[Berlusconi IV Cabinet|Berlusconi's Government]] and organized lots of its rallies in all [[Regions of Italy|Italian Regions]], including the National Strike promoted with the CGIL, 14 November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Università, il decreto non-basta – tutti in piazza il 14 novembre|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2008/11/sezioni/scuola_e_universita/servizi/scuola-2009-7/nuova-settimana-protesta/nuova-settimana-protesta.html|magazine=[[La Repubblica (quotidiano)|La Repubblica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a new national High School Students'Union was developed at the "Student Free Camp", organized by ReDS and SDS, from 28 July 2008 to 5 August 2008 near [[Latina, Lazio|Latina]], with also the presence of ISIM members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author = Claudio Benvenuti |url = http://www.aprileonline.info/notizia.php?id=8887 |title = Difendiamo la nostra scuola |date = 5 September 2008 |deadurl = bot: unknown |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081009233116/http://www.aprileonline.info/notizia.php?id=8887 |archivedate = 9 October 2008 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://retedeglistudenti.it:8080/rds/home-page/rds/contenuti-home-page/student-free-camp/ |title = Student Free Camp!!! |date = 10 July 2008 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080804083454/http://retedeglistudenti.it:8080/rds/home-page/rds/contenuti-home-page/student-free-camp/ |archivedate = 4 August 2008 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rete degli Studenti Medi is part of the National Forum of the Most Representative Students'Associations that cooperates with the Italian Ministry for Education.

The association cooperates with High School Students'Unions from France (the [[Union Nationale Lycéenne|UNL]], the UNL-SD and the SGL), from [[Belgium]] (the CEF) from Ireland ([[Irish Second–Level Students' Union|ISSU]]) and from [[Denmark]] (EEO) that took part to the "Revolution Camp" the National camp of Rete degli Studenti Medi and UdU, in the editions 2016 and 2017 in [[Massa]], Tuscany and [[Montalto di Castro]], Lazio. The FMDL, National French Association of High School Students'centers, was at the Revolution Camp too, as the beginning of a cooperation about services and welfare in Italian and French High Schools. Rete degli Studenti Medi joined the National Assembly and the National Congress of the [[Union Nationale Lycéenne|UNL]] respectively in November 2015 and April 2016, and took part to the General Assembly of the [[Organising Bureau of European School Student Unions|OBESSU]] in Amsterdam, the 11 and 12 August 2016, starting the cooperation with other European Students'associations. For the first time as a Candidate Association, RSM had official delegates at the [[Organising Bureau of European School Student Unions|OBESSU]] Council of Members of December 2016 in [[Dublin]], Ireland, and at the [[Organising Bureau of European School Student Unions|OBESSU]] General Assembly 2017 in Berlin, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.revolutioncamp.it/2016/06/10/il-revolution-camp-si-fa-internazionale/ |title= Il Revolution Camp si fa internazionale! |date=10 June 2016 |website= Revolution Camp 2016 |access-date= 2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.obessu.org/obessu-general-assembly-2016-a-very-successful-event#more-8603 |title= OBESSU General Assembly 2016: a very successful event! {{!}} Obessu |website= www.obessu.org |access-date= 2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RSM is an official Member of [[Organising Bureau of European School Student Unions|OBESSU]] since the International Students'Day 2017, day of the Council of Members of [[Prague]] in which RSM Membership was approved by the other member school student unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.obessu.org/resources/news/international-students-day-and-council-of-members-such-a-great-combination/|title=OBESSU {{!}} International Students’ Day and Council of Members: such a great combination!|website=www.obessu.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rete degli Studenti Medi gave its solidarity to Danish student unions after a call of DGS (the General High School student union) against the university reform of 2017, and to [[Colombia]]n students of ANDES part of the peace process at the end of the civil war between [[FARC]] and the [[Government of Colombia|Government]] of [[Colombia]].

[[File:Mercatino del libro usato della Rete degli Studenti Medi a Palermo.jpg|thumb|Second-hand school books market of '''Rete degli Studenti Medi''', August 2016, [[Palermo]], Sicily .|375x375px]]

It organizes each year rallies and cultural events to celebrate 17 November, the [[International Students' Day|International Student Day]], joining international political platforms from the [[Organising Bureau of European School Student Unions|OBESSU]] and from [[European Students' Union|ESU]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.studenti.it/superiori/scuola/giornata-internazionale-studenti-17-novembre-2015-manifestazioni.php |title= 17 novembre, Giornata internazionale degli studenti: le manifestazioni |access-date= 2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The association promotes in many Italian cities the "Second Hand School Book Market", an event that takes place in Schools and in Cultural Centers, to allow Italian Students to buy School Books spending less, because the price of School Books in Italy is considered too high and it has negative effects on the inclusion of many Students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://palermo.repubblica.it/cronaca/2015/08/24/news/scuola_contro_il_caro_libri_i_mercatini_degli_studenti-121555431/|title=Scuola: contro il caro libri i mercatini degli studenti|date=24 August 2015|access-date=2016-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seguonews.it/attualita/al-via-il-mercatino-del-libro-usato-rete-studenti-medi-contro-il-caro-libri/|title=Al via il mercatino del libro usato, Rete Studenti Medi contro il caro libri {{!}} Seguo NewsSeguo News|website=www.seguonews.it|access-date=2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

21 May, the association joins the "Day of Memory and Commitment to commemorate all victims of [[Mafia]]s", with national rallies, for example in [[Bologna]] ([[Emilia-Romagna|Emilia Romagna]]) in 2015, in [[Messina]] (Sicily) in 2016, and [[Locri]] ([[Calabria]]) in 2017 and demonstrations organised by [[Libera.

Some of RSM Provincial Confederations organize cultural activities cooperating with [[Associazione Ricreativa e Culturale Italiana|Arci]], the biggest Italian cultural association, and there are also Circoli [[Associazione Ricreativa e Culturale Italiana|Arci]] (local [[Associazione Ricreativa e Culturale Italiana|Arci]] clubs) directly supported by RSM members, like in [[Treviso]], and [[Caltanissetta]].

The '''Scottish Unionist Party''' ('''SUP''') is a minor [[Scottish political parties|political party]] in Scotland. It is ideologically a [[Unionists (Scotland)|Unionist]] party, supporting the continuation of Scotland and Northern Ireland as a part of the United Kingdom. It is also anti-[[devolution]], advocating the abolition of the [[Scottish Parliament]].

==History==
The SUP was formed in 1986 by a number of members disillusioned with [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Second Thatcher ministry|government]]'s signing of the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]]. In its early years, the party found a great deal of support amongst members of the [[Scottish Orange Order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/organ/sorgan.htm|title= CAIN: Abstracts of Organisations – 'S'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many traditional supporters of the [[Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party]] and others felt that the signing of the treaty giving the [[Republic of Ireland]] a role in the government of [[Northern Ireland]] was a betrayal of the [[Unionism (Ireland)|Unionists]] in that part of the United Kingdom and the associated [[Protestant]] community.

==Electoral performance==
The SUP has contested a number of elections, including the [[Scottish Parliament]] elections in [[Scottish Parliamentary Election, 1999|1999]], [[Scottish Parliamentary Election, 2003|2003]], [[Scottish Parliamentary Election, 2007|2007]] and [[Scottish general election, 2011|2011]]. In 2003, the SUP contested only the [[Glasgow (Scottish Parliament region)|Glasgow]], [[Central Scotland (Scottish Parliament region)|Central Scotland]] and [[West of Scotland (Scottish Parliament region)|West of Scotland]] [[Additional Members System]] electoral regions, yet failed to poll enough votes to elect an [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]]. It also contested only six [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local council]] [[Ward (politics)|wards]] in 2003, all located in the west central belt where the traditional "Orange vote" resides. In one [[Glasgow]] city centre seat (Kingston), they achieved third place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Election Results 2003|url=http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/CouncillorsandCommittees/viewSelectedDocument.asp?c=P62AFQ0GT1T1NTDX|website=Glasgow City Council|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SUP also stood for two seats at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 General Election]], in [[Glasgow Springburn (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Springburn]] and [[Airdrie and Shotts (UK Parliament constituency)|Airdrie and Shotts]]. The party managed to retain its deposit in the former, and almost did so in the latter. This was not so surprising in Springburn, for there was no [[Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party|Conservative and Unionist]] candidate since it was the constituency in which the [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker]] was seeking re-election, but in Airdrie and Shotts, despite the presence of a Conservative and Unionist candidate, the SUP still managed to poll 4.5% of the vote. At the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 General Election]] the party fielded one candidate in [[Glasgow North East (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow North East]] again against the Speaker, managing to achieve 4.5% of the vote, almost retaining its deposit.

The party failed to win any seats in the 2007 Scottish Parliamentary Elections and the Scottish local elections held at the same time. According to the 2007 statement of accounts with the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] the party has 128 members, which is up by 10 on the previous year though income from memberships fell from [[Pound sterling|GBP]]&amp;nbsp;572 to GBP&amp;nbsp;365.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Scottish Unionist Party statement of accounts | publisher = [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] | url = http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/49057/Scottish-Unionist-Party-Statement-of-Accounts-2007_29311-21784__E__N__S__W__.pdf | format = pdf | accessdate = 13 April 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was deregistered by the Electoral Commission on 6 November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/63167/Renamed-or-Deregistered-Parties.pdf |title=List of Political Parties either renamed or deregistered since 2002 |date=16 December 2009 |work=Electoral Commission |accessdate=10 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206030211/http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/63167/Renamed-or-Deregistered-Parties.pdf |archivedate=6 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the party appeared to have revived in 2012, when it ran a slate of candidates in the [[Glasgow City Council election, 2012|Glasgow Council elections]], receiving 586 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishelections.org.uk/scotland/l12/glasgowcity.php|title=Scottish Elections|work=Scottish Elections}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also fielded 2 candidates in the [[South Lanarkshire Council election, 2012|South Lanarkshire Council elections]] where their candidates received an average of 3.2% of the vote in the 2 wards it stood in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishelections.org.uk/scotland/l12/southlanarkshire.php|title=Scottish Elections|work=Scottish Elections}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaigns==
The SUP campaigns against what it sees as [[Anti-Protestantism|Anti-Protestant]] and [[Scottish independence|Anti-Unionist]] government policies. The party is often strongly critical of mainstream parties that they view as failing to safeguard the [[Act of Union 1707]], including the major pro-Union parties in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.scottishunionistparty.co.uk/content/view/6/6/|title= The Scottish Unionist Party – So-called Unionists}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of its major policies are to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.scottishunionistparty.co.uk/content/view/13/8/|title= The Scottish Unionist Party – Campaign Issues}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Oppose any moves to amend the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which disallows the [[British monarchy|British monarch]] from marrying or being a practising [[Roman Catholic]].
* Abolish the [[devolved]] [[Scottish Parliament]].
* End the present system of [[state school|state funded]] [[Roman Catholic]] schools and work towards the creation of "multi-denominational" schools to cater to those of all faiths and none, in the belief that it will lead to greater social cohesion and an end to [[sectarianism]].
* Increase pensions and support for [[senior citizens]].
* Institute "[[zero tolerance]]" approaches to street crime, youth offences and drugs offences.

A '''private security company''' is a [[business corporation]], which provides armed and unarmed security services and expertise to private and public clients. Private security companies are defined by the [[U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics]] as companies primarily engaged in providing guard and patrol services, such as bodyguard, guard dog, parking security and [[security guard]] services. Many of them will even provide advanced [[special operations]] services if the client demands it. Examples of services provided by these companies include the prevention of unauthorized activity or entry, traffic regulation, access control, and fire and theft prevention and detection. These services can be broadly described as the protection of personnel and/or assets. Other security services such as roving patrol, bodyguard, and guard dog services are also included, but are a very small portion of the industry.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics NAICS 561612- ''The U.S. Producer Price In Security Guards and Patrol''&lt;/ref&gt; The private security industry is rapidly growing, currently there are 2 million full-time security workers in the United States and this number is expected to increase by 21% percent through 2020. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Growth &amp; Development of the Private Security Industry|url=http://www.firstsecurityservices.com/the-growth-development-of-the-private-security-industry/|publisher=First Security|accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Making the security industry a $100 billion a year industry, with projected growth to $200 billion by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/0122privatesecurity.html The Arizona Republic]: ''[http://lykosseguridad.com/ Private security guards] play key roles post-9/11'' 22 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States is the world's largest consumer of private military and security service and the private security industry in the US began seeing a huge increase in popularity in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Global Data &amp; Statistics {{!}} Private Security Monitor  {{!}} University of Denver|url = http://psm.du.edu/articles_reports_statistics/data_and_statistics.html#usdata|website = psm.du.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the U.S. security industry has already grown to be a 350 billion dollar market.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==General terms==
Employees of private security companies are generally referred to either as "[[security guard]]s" or "security officers", depending on the laws of the state or country they operate in. Security companies themselves are sometimes referred to as "security contractors", but this is not common due to confusion with [[private military company|private military contractors]], who operate under a different auspice.

'''Sentry Eagle''', the National Initiative Protection Program, is a compartmented program of the [[National Security Agency]]'s (NSA) Central Security Service (CSS) and the US Strategic Command Joint Functional Component Command - Network Warfare (JFCC-NW).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/10/10/core-secrets/ | title=Core Secrets: NSA Saboteurs in China and Germany| work=The Intercept | accessdate=11 October 2014 | author=Maass, Poitras}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its existence was revealed during the 2013 [[global surveillance disclosure]] by [[Edward Snowden]].

The program's efforts to protect America's cyberspace includes efforts to plan, synchronize, and attack an adversary's cyberspace through Computer Network Attack (CNA). The combination of those efforts are referred to as NSA/CSS's and JFCC-NW's core Computer Network Operations (CNO).

The CNO capabilities include SIGINT, Computer Network Exploitation (CNE), Information Assurance, Computer Network Defense (CND), Network Warfare, and Computer Network Attack (CNA).

Sentry Eagle includes six sub-programs:
* Sentry Hawk (for activities involving computer network exploitation, or spying)
* Sentry Falcon (computer network defense)
* Sentry Osprey (cooperation with the CIA and other intelligence agencies)
* Sentry Raven (breaking encryption systems)
* Sentry Condor (computer network operations and attacks)
* Sentry Owl (collaborations with private companies)

== Sentry Hawk ==

The Sentry Hawk program is a computer network exploitation program involving the [[CIA]] and [[FBI]]. The program attempts to exploit computers, computer peripherals, computer-controlled devices, computer networks or facilities housing them, and publicly accessible computing and networking infrastructure. Targets  include specific firewalls, operating systems, and software applications. The program operates with the benefit of partnerships with US commercial sector companies.

== Sentry Falcon ==

The Sentry Falcon program is a computer network defense program focused on attack attribution.

== Sentry Osprey ==

The Sentry Osprey program is a collaborative program with the CIA and the [[National Clandestine Service]] (NCS), FBI, and the [[Defense Clandestine Service]] of the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] to perform Target Exploitation (TAREX) of foreign communication infrastructure.

== Sentry Raven ==

The Sentry Raven program involves secret efforts to weaken commercial encryption systems and software in order to make them exploitable for [[SIGINT]]. The cryptosystems targeted include systems used by the US private sector and developed by US companies.

Sentry Raven involves the use of super computers and special purpose cryptanalytic hardware and software to break foreign ciphers. It also involves the spending of hundreds of millions of dollars on special purpose computer systems to attack US commercial encryption systems, including the exploitation of weaknesses places in them by cooperating companies or undercover agents within US companies.

== Sentry Condor ==

The Sentry Condor program involves the provision of cyber target identification and recognition material and tools and techniques that allow computer network attack on those targets.

== Sentry Owl ==

The Sentry Owl program involves the use of US industry personnel, or undercover NSA personnel at US and foreign employers, to enable SIGINT operations on US and foreign commercial communications products. The program includes contracts with US and foreign commercial entities to subvert the privacy features of their products for both foreign and domestic consumers (for both content and metadata).

The '''Solomon Mahlangu Freedom College''' (SOMAFCO), was an educational institution established by the exiled [[African National Congress]] (ANC) in 1978 at Mazimbu, [[Tanzania]]. Its purpose was to give the youth that had fled South Africa after the 1976 [[Soweto uprising]] and children of existing exiles a primary and secondary education, an alternative to traditional [[Bantu Education Act, 1953|Bantu education system]] they would have received at home. It would teach both an academic and vocational education. Farmlands would supply food to the institution and would also include a hospital. It was officially opened by [[Oliver Tambo]] in 1985.

== History ==
The ANC's would establish its educational centre in [[Morogoro]], Tanzania on land donated by the Tanzanian government during 1977, facilitated by Tanzanian [[Anna Abdallah]].&lt;ref name="Lodge"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lodge |first=Tom |date=1987 |title=State of Exile: The African National Congress of South Africa, 1976-86 |journal=Third World Quarterly |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=1–27 |jstor=3991845 |registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}&lt;ref name=Maaba/&gt;{{rp|291}} The land at Mazimba, consisted of some farm buildings on 600 acres.&lt;ref name="Lodge" /&gt;{{rp|11}} The school would be named after the [[Solomon Mahlangu]], a member of the ANC's military wing, [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] (MK) and an exile of the 1976 [[Soweto uprising]].&lt;ref name="Maaba"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Maaba |first=Brown Bavusile |title=Alternative Schooling for South Africans: Notes on the Solomon Mahlangu Freedom College in Tanzania, 1978-1992 |journal=The International Journal of African Historical Studies |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=289–308 |jstor=4129010 |date=2004 |registration=yes|doi=10.2307/4129010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|289}} Other names that had been suggested for the school before settled on the existing name where the Albert Luthuli Institute and the ANC Freedom School.&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt;{{rp|13}}

The complex was built by Oswald Dennis, an ANC civil engineer trained in [[East Germany]].&lt;ref name=Maaba/&gt;{{rp|290}} He would later be supported by architect Spenser Hodgson.&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt;{{rp|19}} Work started in July 1977, built by Tanzanian labourers and supervised by the ANC, while education began under trees or in the existing farm buildings.&lt;ref name=Maaba/&gt;{{rp|290}} Eventually around eighty percent of the workforce would be made of Tanzanians.&lt;ref name=Maaba/&gt;{{rp|290}} As this would be a boarding school, accommodation was required and so six units catering for 144 pupils were built, with eight students per room.&lt;ref name=Maaba/&gt;{{rp|290}} The first dormitory was completed for occupation in late 1979 by pupils and teachers.&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt;{{rp|20}} By 1980, the land had been cleared, existing houses on the land renovated, a temporary water supply and sewage system in place and the buildings linked to the local electricity network.&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt;{{rp|21}} Future plans called for more dormitories, houses, kitchen and dining rooms as well as a library.&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt;{{rp|22}}

Initially the plan for the facility was for a [[secondary school]] for exiles of the 1976 Soweto uprising and children of the pre-1976, but soon a [[Kindergarten|pre-primary school]] was established and by 1984 it would be formally called the [[Charlotte Maxeke]] Children's Centre.&lt;ref name="Donge"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=van Donge |first=Jan Kees |title=Review: Education in Exile: SOMAFCO, the ANC School in Tanzania 1978-1992 by Sean Morrow; Brown Maaba; Loyiso Pulumani |journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=501–2 |jstor=3876072 | date=September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|501}}&lt;ref name=Plaice/&gt;{{rp|276}}&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt;{{rp|11}} The centre started in the late 70's as a [[Day care|crèche]], first in the town itself before being moved back into a renovated house at SOMAFCO in 1981 as a crèche and [[Preschool|nursery school]].&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt;{{rp|42}} The centre would open in 1984, built by Oswald Dennis from money supplied by the [[Swedish Teachers' Union]].&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt;{{rp|42}}

By 1985 a [[primary school]] was formally established.&lt;ref name=Plaice/&gt;{{rp|276}}&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt;{{rp|42}} In 1980, New Zealanders Terry and Barbara Bell arrived in Tanzania to establish the primary school which operated out of one of the renovated houses though overcrowding meant some had to attend primary school in town.&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt;{{rp|51}} All teaching occurred in English.&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt;{{rp|52}} The Bell's left in 1982 after clashing over the style of the school management. Dennis and Hazel September took over the management of the primary school and the style of teaching changed to a more conventional one of grade and performance measures.&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt;{{rp|57}}

Food for the facility was supplied from the farms' land which would supply milk, eggs, pork, beef and maize.&lt;ref name=Maaba/&gt;{{rp|291}} Hans Jurgen's expertise as an agricultural consultant would provided by the [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency]].&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt;{{rp|23}} He would set about constructing a farm plan to make the facility self-sufficient by 1984 for 2,500 residents.&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt;{{rp|23–4}} Teachers and students were expected spend a time each week working on the farms.&lt;ref name="Lodge" /&gt;{{rp|13}} Security for the complex was provided by the [[Tanzania People's Defence Force]].&lt;ref name=Maaba/&gt;
{{rp|291}}

Medical issues were initially conducted by a clinic at the institution but when politics and personal issues took hold there in the early eighties and with the increase in the need to supply more sophisticated medical treatments, the ANC decided that a hospital should be built.&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt;{{rp|24–6}} Later called the ANC-Holland Solidarity Hospital, it was opened on 1 May 1984.&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt;{{rp|26}} A solidarity group in the [[Netherlands]] under Henk Odenk would finance it and the ANC was responsible for its construction.&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt;{{rp|27}}

The furniture factory was financed out of Finland and would open in 1980 and was called the Vuyisile Mini Furniture Factory, named after [[Vuyisile Mini]] an executed MK soldier.&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt;{{rp|26}} In addition to repairing broken furniture it would supply the building projects with doors, window frames and furniture.&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt;{{rp|27}}

== Teaching and curriculum ==
Teachers where recruited from three main sources.

The students were educated only in English, with both a traditional non-Bantu education and political education.&lt;ref name=Maaba/&gt;{{rp|292}} Subjects by the late 80's included English, Maths, History, Geography, Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Agricultural Science, Typing, Integrated Science, Technical drawing, Development of Societies, Literature and History of the Struggle.&lt;ref name=Maaba/&gt;{{rp|292}} The latter three were examined internally with the other subjects examined externally in the UK as [[General Certificate of Education|GCE]] O level examinations.&lt;ref name=Maaba/&gt;{{rp|292}} The secondary school consisted of six forms or grades and classes took place from Monday to Friday with a uniform worn though not strictly enforced.&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt;{{rp|63–4}} Corporal punishment though not officially allowed did occur from time to time and depended on the teacher concerned.&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt;{{rp|67}}

{{Socialism sidebar |Models}}

'''Soviet-type economic planning''' ('''STP''') is the specific model of [[centralized planning|centralized]] [[economic planning]] employed by [[Marxist-Leninist]] [[socialist state]]s modeled on the [[economy of the Soviet Union|economy]] of the [[Soviet Union]]. Although there was significant variation among these economies, Soviet-type planning and '''Soviet-type economies''' refers to the major structural characteristics common to these economies.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Soviet-type planning is a form of economic planning involving [[centralized]] investment decisions, administrative allocation of economic inputs, [[Material balance planning|material balances]] to reach equilibrium between available inputs and targeted outputs, and to some extent the use of [[linear optimization]] to optimize the plans.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Characteristics==

===Institutions===
The major institutions of Soviet-type planning in the Soviet Union included a planning agency ([[Gosplan]]), an organization for allocating state supplies among the various organizations and enterprises in the economy ([[Gossnab]]), and [[Enterprises in the Soviet Union|enterprises]] which were engaged in the production and delivery of goods and services in the economy. Enterprises comprised production associations and institutes that were linked together by the plans formulated by Gosplan.

===Material balances===
{{Main|Material balance planning}}
Material balance planning was the major function of Gosplan in the Soviet Union. This method of planning involved the accounting of  material supplies in natural units (as opposed to monetary terms), which are used to balance the supply of available inputs with targeted outputs. Material balancing involves taking a survey of available inputs and raw [[materials]] in the economy and then using a balance-sheet to balance them with output targets specified by industry to achieve a balance between supply and demand. This balance is used to formulate a plan for the national economy.&lt;ref&gt;''Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century'', 2003, by Gregory and Stuart. {{ISBN|0-618-26181-8}}. "Material Balance Planning", (P.127)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis of Soviet-type planning==
{{Economic systems sidebar |By model}}

There are two fundamental ways scholars have carried out an '''analysis of Soviet-type economic planning'''. The first involves adapting standard [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] economic models and theories to analyze the [[Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet economic system]]. This paradigm stresses the importance of [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto efficiency standard]].&lt;ref name=Rosefielde&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosefielde|first=Steven|title=The Russian Economy: From Lenin to Putin|year=2007|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, MA|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to this approach, scholars like Pawel Dembinski argue that neo-classical tools are somewhat inappropriate for evaluating Soviet-type planning because they attempt to quantify and measure phenomena specific to capitalist-based economies.&lt;ref name=Dembinski&gt;{{cite book |last=Dembinski|first=Pawel H.|title=The Logic of the Planned Economy: The Seeds of the Collapse|year=1991|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; They contend that, because standard economic models rely on assumptions not fulfilled in the Soviet system (especially the [[Rational choice theory|assumption of economic rationality]] underlying decision-making), the results obtained from a neo-classical analysis will distort the actual effects of STP. These other scholars proceed along a different course, trying to engage with STP on its own terms, investigating the philosophical, historical, and political influences that gave rise to STP, and evaluating its economic successes and failures (theoretical and actual) with reference to those contexts.

The [[USSR]] practiced some form of [[central planning]] beginning in 1918 with [[War Communism]] until it dissolved in 1991, although the type and extent of planning was of a different nature before imperative [[centralized planning]] was introduced in the 1930s. While there were many subtleties to the various forms of economic organization the USSR employed during this 70-year time period, enough features were shared that scholars have broadly examined advantages and disadvantages of Soviet-type economic planning. Soviet is not the same as [[economic planning]] in general – there are other theoretical models of economic planning, and modern [[mixed economies]] also practice economic planning to a certain extent, but they are not subject to all of the advantages and disadvantages enumerated here.

===Advantages===
From a neoclassical perspective, the advantages of STP are quite limited. One advantage of STP is the theoretical possibility to avoid [[inflation]].&lt;ref name=Jeffries&gt;{{cite book |last=Jeffries|first=Ian|title=A Guide to the Socialist Economies|year=1989|publisher=Routledge|location=London; New York|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Complete price stability is achievable, not only because the state plans all prices and quantities, but also because the state has complete control over [[money supply]] via the wages it pays as the sole employer. Therefore, to maintain a fixed currency value, all the state must do is balance the total value of goods available during a given planning period with the amount of wages it pays according to the following equation,&lt;ref&gt;Jeffries, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; represents the general retail price level, &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; accounts for the quantity of consumer goods and services, &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is total household income (wages paid), &lt;math&gt;\mathit{TP}&lt;/math&gt; is [[transfer payments]], &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is household saving, and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is direct household taxes:
&lt;math display=block&gt;P\times Q=Y+\mathit{TP}-S-T&lt;/math&gt;

However, the USSR arguably never realized this theoretical possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffries, 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt; It suffered from both open and repressed inflation throughout much of its history because of failure to balance the above equation.

Another advantage of economic planning from the neoclassical perspective is the ability to eliminate [[unemployment]] (with the exception of [[frictional unemployment]]) and [[business cycles]].&lt;ref name="Jeffries, 12"&gt;Jeffries, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the state is effectively the sole business proprietor and controls banking, it theoretically avoids classic financial frictions and consumer confidence challenges. Also, because the state makes labor compulsory and can run enterprises at a loss, full employment is a theoretical possibility even when capital stocks are too low to justify it in a market system. This was an advantage that the USSR arguably realized by 1930,&lt;ref name="Jeffries, 12"/&gt; although critics argue that sometimes certain segments of Soviet labor exhibited zero productivity, meaning that though workers were on employment rolls, they essentially sat idle because of capital deficiencies; ''i.e.'', there was employed unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;Rosefield, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those scholars who reject the neoclassical viewpoint consider the benefits of STP that the USSR itself adduced. One is the ability to control for [[externalities]] directly in the pricing mechanism.&lt;ref name="Dembinski, 70"&gt;Dembinski, 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Another is the total capture of value obtained in STP which is neglected in market economies.&lt;ref&gt;Dembinski, 69.&lt;/ref&gt; By this it is meant that while a worker might put in a certain amount of work to produce a good, a market might value that good at less than the cost of labor the worker put in, effectively negating the value of the work done. But, because in STP prices are set by the state, STP avoids this pitfall by never pricing an item below its labor value. While these do seem to be valid theoretical advantages to STP (especially under a [[Marxist]] framework),  it has been argued by some that STP as implemented by the USSR failed to achieve these theoretical possibilities.&lt;ref name="Dembinski, 70"/&gt;

Centrally-planned economies also provide a better quality of life than market economies at the same level of economic development in nearly all cases&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cereseto|first=Shirley|date=June 1986|title=Economic Development, Political-Economic System, and the Physical Quality of Life|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=Volume 76|issue=6|pages=661–666|pmc=1646771|pmid=3706593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disadvantages ===
{{POV-section|date=December 2017}}
From a neoclassical perspective, there were many disadvantages to STP. They can be divided into two categories: [[macroeconomic]] and [[microeconomic]].

Macroeconomic disadvantages included systemic [[undersupply]], the pursuit of [[full employment]] at a steep cost, price fixing’s devastating effect on agricultural [[incentives]], and the loss of the [[Money|advantages of money]] because STP eschews money’s classic role.&lt;ref&gt;Rosefielde, 19. Jeffries 7, 15, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Systemic undersupply was caused in STP because of the use of "[[material balances]]" (plans for the balanced production and consumption of goods and productive inputs), which are theoretically possible, but practically impossible to produce because planners cannot acquire enough [[perfect information|information]] to craft them accurately{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}. Additionally, planners had to aggregate many types of goods and inputs into a single material balance because it was impossible to create an individual balance for each of the approximately 24 million items produced and consumed in the USSR.&lt;ref name="Jeffries, 15"&gt;Jeffries, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; This system introduced a strong bias towards underproduction, resulting in a scarcity of consumer goods. Another disadvantage is that while STP does allow for the theoretically possibility of full employment, the USSR often achieved full employment by operating enterprises at a loss or leaving workers idle. Therefore, there was always a Pareto superior alternative available to the USSR rather than full employment, specifically, the option to close some enterprises and make transfer payments to the unemployed.&lt;ref&gt;Rosefielde, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The microeconomic disadvantages from a neoclassical perspective include:&lt;ref&gt;Jeffries, 8, 13-15, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Encouragement of [[Black market|black-market activity]] because of fixed resource allocation
* Low quality of Soviet goods induced by [[Trade barrier|shielding]] them from world markets 
* The neglect of consumer need because of the challenge in measuring good quality 
* The tendency of enterprise-level Soviet managers to understate productive capacity in fear of the "[[ratchet effect]]". This effect resulted from an enterprise overproducing in a given plan cycle. They would have to match their new level of higher production in the next cycle as the plan was ‘adjusted’ to fit the new data.
* An anti-innovation bias (also from fear of the [[ratchet effect]])
* "Storming" (''[[shturmovshchina]]'') which was the hurry to complete the plan at the end of a planning cycle resulting in poor production quality
* "Scattering" of resources (excessive spread, ''raspylenie sredstv''),  where too many projects (esp. construction) would have been started simultaneously and it took much longer to complete because of a lack of available inputs on time

Scholars who reject the neoclassical approach produce a shorter list of disadvantages, but because these disadvantages are valid even from the Soviet perspective, they are perhaps even more damning of STP than those listed above. These scholars consider STP’s inability to predict things like weather, trade, and technological advancement as an insurmountable drawback to the planning procedure.&lt;ref&gt;Dembinski, 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Without exhaustive knowledge of those things, planning would (and did) systemically misappropriate resources{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}. Also, STP’s use of coercive techniques (e.g. ratchet effect, [[Gulag|labor camps]], etc.), which are argued to be inherent to STP, on the one hand ensured the system's survival and on the other hand resulted in the [[information asymmetry|distorted information]] that made effective planning challenging if not impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Dembinski, 76, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; And lastly these scholars argue that the semantic limitations of language made it impossible for STP planners to communicate their desires to enterprises in sufficient detail for planning to fully direct economic outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Dembinski, 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Enterprises themselves under STP still made a variety of economic decisions autonomously. 

Other scholars have argued following the collapse of the USSR argued that a central deficiency of Soviet economic planning was that it was not premised on final consumer demand, and that such a system would be increasingly feasible with advances in information technology.&lt;ref&gt;Mandel, E. 1986. In Defence of Socialist Planning https://www.marxists.org/archive/mandel/1986/09/planning.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Cottrell and Cockshott. 1993. Socialist planning after the collapse of the Soviet Union
http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/socialism_book/soviet_planning.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these shortcomings, the USSR's growth in GDP per capita compared favorably with Western Europe. In 1913, prior to the revolution, the former USSR had a GDP per capita of  $1,488 in 1990 international dollars, which  grew 461% to  $6,871 by 1990. Moreover, following the fall of the USSR, this figure fell to $3,893 by 1998.  Western Europe, by comparison grew from a higher base of  $3,688 international dollars by a comparable 457% to $16,872 in the same period. It reached $17,921 by 1998. &lt;ref&gt;Maddison. 2001.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26199">A '''stadium subsidy''' is a type of government [[subsidy]] given to [[professional sports]] franchises to help finance the construction or renovation of a [[sports venue]].  Stadium subsidies can come in the form of tax-free [[municipal bonds]], cash payments, long-term tax exemptions, infrastructure improvements, and operating cost subsidies.  Funding for stadium subsidies can come from all levels of government and remains controversial among legislators and citizens.  There is an ongoing debate among economists and municipalities about the aggregate effects of hosting a professional athletic team. &lt;ref name="kianka2013a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawweb2009.law.villanova.edu/sportslaw/?p=1853|title=Subsidizing Billionaires: How Your Money is Being Used to Construct Professional Sports Stadiums|author=Kianka, Tim|date=6 March 2013|publisher=Jeffrey S.

==Background==

===In the United States===
Eighty years ago, stadium subsidies were essentially unheard of, with funding for professional sports stadiums coming from private sources. In 1951, [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] commissioner [[Ford Frick]] decided that league teams were bringing large amounts of revenue to their host cities from which owners weren't able to profit. He announced that cities would need to start supporting their teams by building and maintaining venues through public subsidy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sports Economics|last=Fort|first=Rodney D.|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2011|isbn=9780136066026|location=Boston|pages=408, 409}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, most new or renovated professional sports stadiums are financed at least partly through stadium subsidies. While Frick may have been a catalyst, this change has been primarily caused by the increase in bargaining power of professional sports teams at the expense of their host cities.  As the years have passed, [[municipalities]] have come to love their local professional sports teams.  

Recently there have been many studies that have suggested that there are a number of direct and indirect economic benefits associated with hosting a professional sports team, although each city experiences this to a different degree.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baade|first=Robert A.|last2=Dye|first2=Richard F.|date=1990-04-01|title=The Impact of Stadium and Professional Sports on Metropolitan Area Development|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2257.1990.tb00513.x/abstract|journal=Growth and Change|language=en|volume=21|issue=2|pages=1–14|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2257.1990.tb00513.x|issn=1468-2257}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coates|first=Dennis|date=2007-10-01|title=Stadiums and Arenas: Economic Development or Economic Redistribution?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1465-7287.2007.00073.x/abstract|journal=Contemporary Economic Policy|language=en|volume=25|issue=4|pages=565–577|doi=10.1111/j.1465-7287.2007.00073.x|issn=1465-7287}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even still, a survey conducted in 2017 found that "83% of economists polled believed that a subsidy's cost to the public outweighed the economic benefits".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wolla|first=Scott|date=May 2017|title=The Economics of Subsidizing Sports Stadiums|url=https://www.brookings.edu/articles/sports-jobs-taxes-are-new-stadiums-worth-the-cost/|journal=Page One Economics|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/sports-stadiums|title=Sports Stadiums|last=|first=|date=January 31, 2017|website=IMG Forum|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economics behind issuing billions of dollars to professional athletic organizations are still unclear, but cities have clearly showed that they are willing to assume the best, as recent years have seen an increase in the number of subsidies issues and the amount of money issued per subsidy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://deadspin.com/the-raiders-robbed-las-vegas-in-americas-worst-stadium-1795475973|title=The Raiders Robbed Las Vegas In America's Worst Stadium Deal|last=Brown|first=T.M.|work=Deadspin|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/falcons-new-home-is-just-the-latest-of-handouts-to-the-nfl/article/2633548|title=Falcons' new home is just the latest of handouts to the NFL|last=Kampis|first=Johnny|work=Washington Examiner|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Long|first=Judith Grant|date=May 1, 2005|title=The Real Cost of Funding for Major League Sports Facilities|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1527002504264614#articleCitationDownloadContainer|journal=Journal of Sports Economics|volume=6|pages=|via=SAGE Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty-seven of the 30 stadiums built between 1953 and 1970 received more than $450 million in total public funding for construction.&lt;ref&gt;Okner, B. “Subsidies of Stadiums and Arenas,” in ''Government and the Sports Business'', edited by R. G.Noll. Washington, DC: The Brookings Institution, 1974, 325–48.&lt;/ref&gt;  During this period, publicly funding a stadium grew in popularity as an effective incentive to attract professional sports teams to up and coming cities.  Famous examples include the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] leaving New York in exchange for [[Dodger Stadium|300 acres in Chavez Ravine]] and the [[History of the New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] moving to San Francisco for what would eventually become [[Candlestick Park]].&lt;ref name="phelps"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://scholarship.law.stjohns.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1178&amp;context=jcred | title=Stadium Construction for Professional Sports: Reversing the Inequities Through Tax Incentives | author=Phelps, Zachary A. | journal=Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development | year=2004 | volume=18 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Los Angeles Coliseum became the first fully publicly funded stadium in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.usc.edu/135433/usc-kicks-off-270-million-renovation-of-coliseum/|title=USC kicks off $270 million renovation of Coliseum - USC News|website=news.usc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, a market for subsidies has come into existence.  Sports teams have realized their ability to relocate at lower and lower costs to their private contributors.  Because local governments feel that keeping their sports teams around is critical to the success of their cities, they comply and grant teams subsidies. This creates a market for subsidies, where professional athletic organizations can shop between cities to see which municipality will provide them with the most resources.  Teams in the NFL have a major incentive to keep their stadium up to date, as the NFL allows teams to bid to host the Super Bowl and takes recent and planned renovations into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TjDiwwaN5VsC&amp;pg=PA1509#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Sports Management and Marketing|last=Swayne|first=Linda E.|date=2011|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9781412973823|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2003-09-22-ny-nj-superbowl_x.htm|title=USATODAY.com - N.Y./N.J.

=== In Europe ===
Public subsidies for major league sports stadiums and arenas are far less common in Europe than in the United States. The relationship between the local clubs and the cities that host them is typically much stronger than in the United States, with the team being more intrinsic to the cities' identity. Cities would be significantly more upset at the departure of their beloved local teams, and viable alternative cities already have their own clubs to whom their residents are loyal. As a result, the leagues in Europe have significantly less bargaining power. They will not threaten to relocate to another city if not provided with a subsidy, or at the very least the threat would not be credible&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/26160156|title=Sport, space, and the city|last=John.|first=Bale,|date=1993|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415080983|location=London|oclc=26160156}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is also worth noting that the NFL, the league in the United States whose stadiums have the highest percentage of public financing of the four major leagues, does not have an equivalent in Europe; American football is relatively unpopular.

==Types of Subsidies==
There are two primary ways that a city facilitates the construction of a stadium.  The first, and most commonly used method, is a direct subsidy.  This involves a city promising a certain amount of revenue to go towards the construction, maintenance, and renovation of a stadium.  Other times, the city will give tax breaks to teams or stadium owners in lieu of a direct cash transfer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Over a period of time, a reduction in the taxes paid against the stadium generally saves the organization building the stadium around the same amount as a subsidy would be worth.  

In the USA, the annual subsidies provided by the state for the construction of stadiums are in the range of billions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/30/news/companies/nfl-taxpayers/|title=NFL gets billions in subsidies from U.S. taxpayers|author=Isidore, Chris|date=2015-01-30|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ideas.time.com/2013/12/06/football-a-waste-of-taxpayers-money/|title=Football: A Waste of Taxpayers’ Money|author=Gillespie, Nick|date=2013-12-06|publisher=Time, Inc.|accessdate=2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2005 study of all sports stadiums and facilities in use by the four major leagues from 1990 to 2001 calculated a total public subsidy of approximately $17 billion, or approx. $24 billion in 2018 dollars. The average annual subsidy during that period was $1.6 billion ($2.2 billion in 2018) for all 99 facilities included in the study, with an average of $16.2 million ($22.8 million in 2018) per facility annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Long|first=Judith Grant|date=May 1, 2005|title=Full Count: The Real Cost of Public Funding For Major League Sports Facilities|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1527002504264614|journal=Journal Of Sports Economics|volume=6|pages=119-143|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 Bloomberg analysis estimates that tax exemptions annually cost the [[U.S. Treasury]] $146 million.&lt;ref name="bloomberg" /&gt;

==Benefits==
In granting stadium subsidies, governments claim that the new or improved stadiums will have positive [[Externality|enternalities]] for the city.  Proponents tout improvements to the local economy as the primary benefits.  Economists who debate the issue have separated the effects on a local economy into direct and indirect effects.  Direct benefits are those that exist as a result of the "rent, concessions, parking, advertising, suite rental, and other preferred seating rental", and direct expenses come from "wages and related expenses, utilities, repairs and maintenance, insurance," and the costs of building the facilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   Generally, these benefits vary widely.  The [[Baltimore Orioles|Balitmore Orioles]], for example, estimate that each game they host brings $3 million in economic benefits to the city.  Over the course of an entire baseball season, the [[Baltimore Orioles|Orioles]] will have 81 home games, which means that benefit gets multiplied to be around $243 million a season.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/articles/sports-jobs-taxes-are-new-stadiums-worth-the-cost/|title=Sports, Jobs, &amp; Taxes: Are New Stadiums Worth the Cost?|last=Noll|first=Andrew Zimbalist and Roger G.|date=|work=Brookings|access-date=2018-03-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For [[NFL]] teams the case is much different, as there are only 8 home games a season.  Over the lifetime of a stadium, which is often between 20-30 years, this benefit accumulates even more.  Essentially, this is the basis on which municipalities evaluate the benefit of a team.  [[File:Stadium economics public economics.png|thumb|395x395px|Visual Representation of the Social Marginal Benefit Calculation]]Supporters further argue that the stadiums attract tourism and businesses that lead to further spending and job creation, representing indirect benefits.  All of the increased spending causes a [[Local multiplier effect|multiplier effect]] that leads to more spending and job creation and eventually finances the subsidy through increased tax revenues from ticket and concessions sales, improved property values and more spending nearby the stadium.&lt;ref name="brookings1997"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zimbalist|first1=Andrew|last2=Noll|first2=Roger G|title=Sports, Jobs, &amp; Taxes: Are New Stadiums Worth the Cost?|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/1997/06/summer-taxes-noll|website=Brookings Institution|publisher=The Brookings Institution|accessdate=17 February 2016|date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases, there has even been an observed reduction in crime during a game, although the aggregate effect of professional sports on crime is disputable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laqueur|first=Hannah|last2=Copus|first2=Ryan|date=2014-04-25|title=Entertainment as Crime Prevention: Evidence from Chicago Sports Games|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2429551|language=en|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White, G. F., Katz, J., &amp; Scarborough, K. E. (1992). The impact of professional football games upon violent assaults on women. ''Violence and Victims, 7''(2), 157-71.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, there has recently been research that suggests that home games generate what is called a "sunny day benefit".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Rappaport, J., &amp; Wilkerson, C. (2001). What are the benefits of hosting a major league sports franchise? ''Economic Review - Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, 86''(1), 55-86. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://ccl.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/218422373?accountid=10141&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a measurable drop in local spending that occurs within a city on a rainy day, but with a professional sports team playing a game, spending increases significantly.  Jordan Rappaport, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas, estimates that this benefit is between $14 to $24 million dollars a year, which can be compounded over the life of a stadium.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan Rappaport &amp; Chad R. Wilkerson, 2001. "[https://ideas.repec.org/a/fip/fedker/y2001iqip55-86nv.86no.1.html What are the benefits of hosting a major league sports franchise?,]" Economic Review, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, issue Q I, pages 55-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates for stadium subsidies also claim less quantifiable [[positive externalities]], such as civic pride and [[Fan (person)|fan identification]], so that hosting a major sports team becomes something of a [[public good]].  Local sports fans enjoy the benefit even if they do not pay for it.&lt;ref name="brookings1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="owen"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.cas.unt.edu/~jhauge/teaching/sports/owen.pdf | title=The Intangible Benefits of Sports Teams | author=Owen, Jeffrey G. | journal=Public Finance and Management | year=2006 | volume=6 | issue=3 | pages=321–345}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When a city conducts a calculation to assess what they are willing to pay for a [[subsidy]], they use an economic model that attempts to quantify the various social benefits for each dollar invested.  This is done through a social [[marginal benefit]] evaluation, which takes the sums of all of the private benefits that result from investing, intended or not.   Economists consider all the economic effects of having a professional athletic team in a city, like the "sunny day" benefit, job creation, civic pride, increased tourism, decreases/increases in crime rates, etc.  The social [[marginal cost]] is equal to the sum of the private [[Marginal benefit|marginal benefits]].  The [[marginal cost]] is known only by the government, who deliberates with franchises to decide how much bringing a team to their city will cost.  The image to the right is a good visual representation of this analysis.  In this diagram, the city would like to acquire four teams, since at that point the social [[marginal benefit]] of recruiting a team still exceeds the [[marginal cost]].

==Criticisms==
[[File:Social marginal cost graph1.png|thumb|396x396px|Visual Representation of the Social Marginal Cost]]
Many criticisms exist regarding the use of stadium subsidies.  First, critics argue that new stadiums generate little to no new spending ([[consumption (economics)|consumption]]).  Instead, what fans spend in and around the stadium are substitutes for what they would otherwise spend on different entertainment options.  Thus, this argument contends, new stadiums do not cause economic growth or lead to increased aggregate income.  In fact, this suggests that money being substituted towards concessions, tickets, and merchandise actively harms the economy surrounding a stadium.&lt;ref name="fed2001"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.stlouisfed.org/Publications/Regional-Economist/April-2001/Should-Cities-Pay-for-Sports-Facilities | title=Should Cities Pay for Sports Facilities? | publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis | work=The Regional Economist | date=2001-04-01 | accessdate=2016-02-02 | author=Zaretsky, Adam M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Another criticism of stadium subsidies is that much of the money the new stadiums bring in does not stay in the local economy.  Instead of going to stadium employees and other sources that would benefit the local community, a lot of the money goes toward paying the organizations.&lt;ref name="fed2001" /&gt;  Those payments come from either the state or city government, where spending normally goes towards social welfare programs or salaries for government employees.  It has been argued that the [[opportunity cost]] of a subsidy for a sports team is far greater than the benefit, since the billions of dollars that are spent on a stadium could be better spent on schools, firehouses, public transportation, or police departments.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kianka2013a" /&gt;  

Critics also argue that the construction of new stadiums could cause citizens and businesses to leave a city because of [[eminent domain]] issues.  If a city is forced to take land from its citizens to build a new stadium, those who have lost land could become angry enough to leave the city.  If they are business owners, then they will likely take their businesses with them.  These trade-offs are a part of the [[marginal cost]] calculation the city does.  Much like the social [[marginal benefit]] calculation the city performed to find what benefits teams brought to the city, the social [[marginal cost]] calculation sums up all of the unintended negative effects from a particular spending plan.

A review of the empirical literature assessing the effects of subsidies for professional sports franchises and facilities reveals that most evidence goes against sports subsidies.  Specifically, subsidies cannot be  justified on the grounds of local economic development, income growth or job creation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="owen" /&gt;

'''Tabarca''' ({{IPA-ca|taˈbaɾka|langva}}, {{IPA-es|taˈβaɾka|lang}}) also known in [[Valencian language|Valencian]] as ''Nova Tabarca'' and ''Illa Plana'', and in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as ''Nueva Tabarca'' and ''Isla Plana'', is an [[islet]] located in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], close to the town of [[Santa Pola]], in the [[province of Alicante]], [[Valencian community]], [[Spain]]. Tabarca is the smallest permanently inhabited islet in Spain and it is currently known for its [[marine reserve]].

==Geography==
Despite being much more socially and economically related to the fishing port of Santa Pola, the tiny island of Tabarca is a part of the city of [[Alicante]]. Administratively, it is managed as a rural district of Alicante, jointly with el Palmeral, Aiguamarga and Urbanova.

The local census (2011) counted 68 inhabitants and its postal code is 03138.

The islet is {{convert|1750|m|0|abbr=on}} long, with a maximum breadth of {{convert|300|m|0|abbr=on}} and absolutely flat. Almost next to the main islet lie the islets of ''la Nau'', ''la Galera'' and ''la Cantera''. It lies approximately {{convert|8|nmi|km}} south-southeast from Alicante and {{convert|5|nmi|km|0}} east-southeast from Santa Pola.

Tourism is the main economical activity, especially during the summer. There are several boats connecting Tabarca with [[Alicante]], [[Santa Pola]] and [[Torrevieja]], with higher frequencies during summer time.

== History==
Before 1700, the island was known as ''Illa de Sant Pau'' ('Saint Paul's Island') or ''Illa Plana'' ('Flat Island'). Believed to be the island that [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]] disembarked on, the island was a refuge for [[Barbary pirates]] up to the end of the 18th century.

Its Tunisian fellow islet off the town of [[Tabarka]]  was a part of the [[Republic of Genoa]] till 1741 when it was conquered by the [[Bey]] of Tunis.  In 1760, [[Charles III of Spain]] ordered the fortification and repopulation of the Spanish island. A group of Genoese sailors shipwrecked near the coast of Tunisia, mostly coming from the islet off Tunisian Tabarka, were rescued and settled here. The islet was renamed Nova Tabarca ("New Tabarca" in both Valencian and Latin). Thus a settlement was created by royal edict on this uninhabited island which the North African corsaries had previously used as a platform for raids on the [[Levante, Spain|Levantine]] coast.
[[File:Tabarca. Plànol de la ciutat.png|thumb|300px|Plan of the city.]]
On their arrival, the Genoese were first moved to [[Alicante]], where they lived temporarily in the Jesuit School, empty after the  [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus#Spanish Empire and Naples|expulsion of the Jesuits from Spain]]. Finally, the Genoese were moved to the island together with a Spanish garrison. The military engineer Fernando Méndez Ras planned a fortified town and walls, bulwarks, warehouses and barracks were built. From 1770, the island was known as Nueva Tabarca ('New Tabarca').

Although the Genoese assimilated,  abandoning [[Genoese language|their language]] in favour first of [[Valencian]] and, later on, of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (both languages are currently spoken on the islet), the Genoese descent of the settlers can still be noticed today in the surnames of Italian origin common on the islet.

The island is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with [[Carloforte]], in the [[Sardinia]]n [[San Pietro Island]], which was also populated with Genoese from Tunisian Tabarka.

The gateways are still visible and so are the Governor's House (currently a hotel) and the church of St Peter and St Paul, concluded in 1779.

In 1850 the governor and the garrison were removed. At the end of the 19th century, the island had a population of around 1,000 people mainly devoted to fishing. Nowadays, the permanent population is around 50, making Tabarca the smallest permanently inhabited Spanish island, although this number is multiplied by ten during the tourist season in summer.

The main activity of the local population is fishing, with the catch brought to Santa Pola's fish market, but tourism becomes the most important resource during summer, specially in July and August.

== Ecology==
[[File:Playa Tabarca.jpg|thumb|A view of Tabarca beach.]]
Tabarca is a protected marine reserve called ''Reserva marina de la Isla de Tabarca'', declared a Zone of Special Protection for Birds by the EU, with a varied marine fauna (sea bass, grouper, conger eel, gilthead etc.). It is surrounded by very clear and unpolluted waters. The island is formed by materials of volcanic origin on top of which limestone and quaternary deposits have settled.

Tabarca was the last Spanish Mediterranean location where the critically endangered [[Mediterranean monk seal]] successfully bred before it became extinct in this part of its range in the 1960s. This proves the high quality of the waters around the island in terms of marine ecology. Therefore, waters around Tabarca were declared a [[Marine reserve]] in 1986, the first of its kind in Spain. This status was mainly granted due to its submarine [[posidonia]] prairie, which is the largest in the Spanish Mediterranean and has an extraordinary ecological value in terms of marine fauna and flora.

In order to both enhance the marine biodiversity and protect it from fishing, an [[artificial reef]] was laid near the island by the Marine Reserve authorities.

{{voting}}

In [[voting system|voting method]]s, '''tactical voting''' (or '''strategic voting''' or '''sophisticated voting''' or '''insincere voting''') occurs, in elections with more than two candidates, when a voter supports another candidate more strongly than their ''sincere preference'' in order to prevent an undesirable outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory of Voting |first=Robin | last=Farquharson |publisher=Blackwell (Yale U.P. in the U.S.) |year=1969 |isbn=0-631-12460-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in a simple [[Plurality voting method|plurality election]], a voter might sometimes gain a "better" outcome by voting for a less preferred but more generally popular candidate.

It has been shown by the [[Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem]] that any single-winner ranked voting method which is not dictatorial must be susceptible to tactical voting. However, the type of tactical voting and the extent to which it affects campaigns and election results can vary dramatically from one voting method to another.

&lt;!-- A false counter example to this that is often given is the [[random ballot]] voting method, which randomly selects the ballot of a single voter and uses this to determine the outcome.  This is strategy-free but it is dictatorial (albeit with the dictator being picked at random).  This counter-example is often used to imply that the G-S Theorem does not apply to non-deterministic voting methods.  That is not true, it does apply to probabilistic voting methods if they are non-dictatorial.
 --&gt;
== Types ==

=== Compromising ===
'''Compromising''' (sometimes "useful vote") is a type of tactical voting in which a voter insincerely ranks an alternative higher in the hope of getting it elected.  For example, in the [[first-past-the-post election system|first-past-the-post]] election, voters may vote for an option they perceive as having a greater chance of winning over an option they prefer (e.g., a [[conservative]] voter voting for an uncontroversial [[moderate]] candidate over a controversial right-wing candidate in order to help defeat a popular [[leftist]] candidate).  [[Duverger's law]] argues that, for this reason, first-past-the-post election methods will lead to [[two-party system]]s in most cases.  In those [[proportional representation]] methods that include a [[electoral threshold|minimum percentage]] of votes that a party must achieve to receive any seats, people might vote tactically for a minor party to prevent it from dropping below that percentage (which would make the votes it does receive useless for the larger political camp that party belongs to), or alternatively those who support the viewpoints of a minor party may vote for the larger party whose views are closest to those of the minor party.

=== Burying ===
'''Burying''' is a type of tactical voting in which a voter insincerely ranks an alternative lower in the hopes of defeating it.  For example, in the [[Borda count]] or in a [[Condorcet method]], a voter may insincerely rank a perceived strong alternative last in order to help their preferred alternative beat it.

=== Push-over ===
'''Push-over''' (also called '''mischief voting''') is a type of tactical voting in which a voter ranks a perceived weak alternative higher, but not in the hopes of getting it elected. This primarily occurs in [[Two-round system|runoff voting]] when a voter already believes that their favored candidate will make it to the next round – the voter then ranks an unpreferred, but easily beatable, candidate higher so that their preferred candidate can win later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voting with Bidirectional Elimination |url=http://economics.stanford.edu/files/Matthew%20Cook%20Honors%20Thesis.pdf |publisher=Voting with Bidirectional Elimination |accessdate=21 April 2012 |author=Matthew S. Cook |date=March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120014436/http://economics.stanford.edu/files/Matthew%20Cook%20Honors%20Thesis.pdf |archivedate=20 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[United States]], for instance, voters of one party sometimes [[Party Raiding|vote in the other party's primary]] to nominate a candidate who will be easy for their favorite to beat, especially after that favorite has secured their party's own nomination.

=== Bullet voting ===
[[Bullet voting]] is when a voter votes for just one candidate, despite having the option to vote for more than one due to a voting method such as [[approval voting]], [[plurality-at-large voting]], and [[Condorcet method|Condorcet methods]]. A voter helps their preferred candidate by not supplying votes to potential rivals. Since a voter helps their preferred candidate and does not support another candidate more strongly than their sincere preference, bullet voting is not a type of tactical voting{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}. Bullet voting is a type of [[sincere voting]]. This strategy is encouraged and seen as sometimes beneficial in the methods of [[limited voting]] and [[cumulative voting]].

== Examples in real elections ==

=== United States ===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
One high-profile example of tactical voting was the [[California gubernatorial election, 2002]].  During the Republican primaries, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] [[Richard Riordan]] (former mayor of [[Los Angeles]]) and [[Bill Simon (politician)|Bill Simon]] (a self-financed businessman) were vying for a chance to compete against the unpopular incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[Governor of California]], [[Gray Davis]].  Polls predicted that Riordan would defeat Davis, while Simon would not. At that time, the Republican primaries were [[open primary|open primaries]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} in which anyone could vote regardless of their own party affiliation.  Davis supporters were rumored to have voted for Simon because Riordan was perceived as a greater threat to Davis; this combined with a negative advertising campaign by Davis describing Riordan as a "big-city liberal", and Simon ultimately won the primary despite a last-minute business [[scandal]]. However, he lost the election against Davis.

=== United Kingdom ===
&lt;!-- 
In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 United Kingdom general election]] in [[Winchester]], [[Mark Oaten]] ([[Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]]) beat the incumbent [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP [[Gerry Malone]] with a majority of 2 votes. Malone successfully challenged the election in the High Court, which declared it void. A [[Winchester by-election, 1997|by-election]] was held which returned [[Mark Oaten]] as MP, this time with a larger majority of 21,556. This was due to the majority of Labour voters voting Liberal in the by-election. --&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 UK general election]], [[Democratic Left (United Kingdom)|Democratic Left]] helped [[Bruce Kent]] set up GROT (Get Rid Of Them) a tactical voter campaign whose sole aim was to help prevent the Conservative Party from gaining a 5th term in office.  This coalition was drawn from individuals in all the main opposition parties and many who were not aligned with any party. While it would be hard to prove that GROT swung the election itself, it did attract significant media attention and brought tactical voting into the mainstream for the first time in UK politics.  In 2001, the Democratic Left's successor organisation the [[New Politics Network]] organised a similar campaign. Since then tactical voting has become a real consideration in British politics as is reflected in by-elections and by the growth in sites such as [https://www.tactical2017.com/ tactical2017.com] who encourage tactical voting as a way of defusing the two party system and empowering the individual voter. For the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 UK general election]], http://voteswap.org was set up to help prevent the Conservative Party staying in government, by encouraging Green Party supporters to tactically vote for the Labour Party in listed marginal seats. In 2017 [https://www.swapmyvote.uk/ swapmyvote.uk] was formed to help supporters of all parties swap their votes with people in other constituencies.

In the 2006 local elections in London, tactical voting is being promoted by sites such as London Strategic Voter in a response to national and international issues.  The question of whether this approach acts to undermine local democracy is receiving much debate.

In Northern Ireland, it is widely believed that (predominantly Protestant) Unionist voters in Nationalist strongholds have voted for the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP) to prevent [[Sinn Féin]] from capturing such seats.  This conclusion was reached by comparing results to the demographics of constituencies and polling districts.

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 general election]] it is estimated that 6.5 million people (more than 20% of voters) voted tactically&lt;ref name="sky.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/general-election-2017-65-million-voted-tactically-on-8-june-10998890|title=General Election 2017: 6.5 million voted tactically on 8 June|author=|date=|website=sky.com|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; either as a way of preventing a "hard Brexit" or preventing another Conservative government led by the Tactical2017 campaign.&lt;ref name="sky.com"/&gt; Many Green Party candidates withdrew from the race in order to help the Labour Party&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/green-party-pulls-general-election-seat-ealing-help-labour-beat-tories-rupa-huq-a7701081.html|title=Green Party pulls out of crucial general election seat to help Labour beat the Tories|author=|date=25 April 2017|website=independent.co.uk|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; secure closely fought seats against the Conservatives. This ultimately lead to the Conservatives losing seats in the election even though they increased their overall vote share.&lt;ref&gt;https://designobserver.com/feature/flipping-the-script/39852&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
In the [[Ontario general election, 1999|1999 Ontario provincial election]], strategic voting was widely encouraged by opponents of the [[Ontario Progressive Conservative Party|Progressive Conservative]] government of [[Mike Harris]].  This failed to unseat Harris, and succeeded only in suppressing the [[Ontario New Democratic Party]] vote to a historic low.

In the [[Canadian general election, 2004|2004 federal election]] and to a lesser extent in the [[Canadian general election, 2006|2006 election]], strategic voting was a concern for the federal [[New Democratic Party]] (NDP).  In the 2004 election, the governing Liberal Party was able to convince many New Democratic voters to vote Liberal{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} in order to avoid a Conservative government.  In the 2006 elections, the Liberal Party attempted the same strategy, with Prime Minister [[Paul Martin]] asking New Democrats and Greens to vote for the Liberal Party in order to prevent a Conservative win.  The New Democratic Party leader [[Jack Layton]] would respond by asking voters to "lend" their votes to his party, suggesting that the Liberal Party would be bound to lose the election regardless of strategic voting.

During the [[Canadian general election, 2015|2015 federal election]], strategic voting was primarily against the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] government of [[Stephen Harper]] which had benefited from [[vote splitting]] among centrist and left-leaning parties in the [[Canadian federal election, 2011|2011 election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/ken-wu/strategetic-voting-green_b_8305938.html|title=Strategic Voting Must Include Casting Your Ballot for the Green Party|date=18 October 2015|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= Tremonti, Anna Maria (Host) |date=15 October 2015 |year= |title=Federal Election 2015: Strategic voters challenge democracy |trans-title= |medium=Radio broadcast |language= |url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-october-15-2015-1.3271954/federal-election-2015-strategic-voters-challenge-democracy-1.3271971 |access-date=22 February 2016 |time= |location= |publisher=[[CBC Radio]] |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the landslide victory of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] led by [[Justin Trudeau]] over Harper's Conservatives, observers noted that the increase in support for the Liberals at the expense of the NDP and [[Green Party of Canada|Green Party]] was partially due to strategic voting for Liberal candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Press|first1=Jordan|title=Canada Election Result Numbers Show Canadians Voted Strategically: Experts|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/10/20/canada-election-results-strategic-voting_n_8343104.html|accessdate=22 February 2016|work=Huffington Post|date=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hong Kong ===
In [[Hong Kong]], with its [[party-list proportional representation]] using [[largest remainder method]] with the [[Hare quota]], voters supporting candidates of the [[pro-democracy camp]] will organise to cast their votes to different tickets, so as to avoid votes being concentrated on one or a few candidates and wasted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hkupop.hku.hk/english/columns/columns56.html|title="Legislative Council Election Exit Poll Analysis Article Series" No.2|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hong Kong legislative election, 2016|2016 Hong Kong Legislative Election]], the practices of tactical voting were expanded by [[Benny Tai]]'s [[Project ThunderGo]]. The Anti-establishment camp gained 29 seats, which was a historical record.

=== Other countries ===
[[File:Anti-Macron stencil 2.jpg|thumb|right|Stenciling on a Parisian sidewalk ahead of the first round of the [[French presidential election, 2017|2017 French presidential election]] invoking "votez utile" (tactical voting) as a reason for voters to vote for [[François Fillon]] instead of [[Emmanuel Macron]]]]
[[Puerto Rico]]'s 2004 elections were affected by tactical voting. The [[New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico|New Progressive Party]]'s candidate was unpopular, except among the pro-statehood Right, because of large corruption schemes and privatization of public corporations.  To prevent him from winning, other factions supported the [[Partido Popular Democratico]]'s candidate. The elections were close; statehood advocates won a seat in the U.S. house of representatives and majorities in both legislative branches, but lost governance to [[Anibal Acevedo Vila]]. (In Puerto Rico you have the chance to vote by party or by candidate. Separatists voted under their ideology, but for the center party's candidate. This caused major turmoil.)  After a recount and a trial, [[Anibal Acevedo Vila]] was certified as governor of the commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

In [[Slovenian parliamentary election, 2011|2011 Slovenian parliamentary election]], 30% of voters voted tactically. Public polls predicted easy win for [[Janez Janša]], the candidate of the [[Slovenian Democratic Party]], however his opponent [[Zoran Janković (politician)|Zoran Janković]], the candidate of [[Positive Slovenia]] won. According to prominent Slovenian public opinion researchers, such proportions of tactical voting were not recorded anywhere else before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.times.si/slovenija/raziskovalci-o-anketah-zmagalo-takticno-glasovanje--eba9dab4dd-6810500f55.html |title=Raziskovalci o anketah: zmagalo taktično glasovanje |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Researchers on the Polls: Tactical Voting Won |publisher=Delo.si |date=12 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425082526/http://www.times.si/slovenija/raziskovalci-o-anketah-zmagalo-takticno-glasovanje--eba9dab4dd-6810500f55.html |archivedate=25 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rational voter model ==
Academic analysis of tactical voting is based on the rational voter model, derived from [[rational choice theory]].  In this model, voters are ''short-term instrumentally rational''.  That is, voters are only voting in order to make an impact on one election at a time (not, say, to build the political party for next election); voters have a set of sincere preferences, or utility rankings, by which to rate candidates; voters have some knowledge of each other's preferences; and voters understand how best to use tactical voting to their advantage.  The extent to which this model resembles real-life elections is the subject of considerable academic debate.

=== Myerson-Weber strategy ===
An example of a rational voter strategy is described by [[Roger Myerson|Myerson]] and Weber.&lt;ref&gt;Myerson, R. and Weber, R.J.(1993) A theory of Voting Equilibria. American Political Science Review Vol 87, No. 1. 102-114.&lt;/ref&gt;  The strategy is broadly applicable to a number of single-winner voting methods that are additive point methods, such as [[Plurality voting method|Plurality]], [[Borda count|Borda]], [[Approval voting|Approval]], and [[Range voting|Range]].  The strategy is optimal in the sense that the strategy will maximize the voter's [[Utility#Expected utility|expected utility]] when the number of voters is sufficiently large.

This rational voter model assumes that the voter's utility of the election result is dependent only on which candidate wins and not on any other aspect of the election, for example showing support for a losing candidate in the vote tallies.  The model also assumes the voter chooses how to vote individually and not in collaboration with other voters.

Given a set of ''k'' candidates and a voter let:

: ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = the number of points to be voted for candidate ''i''
: ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = the voter's gain in utility if candidate ''i'' wins the election
: ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; = the (voter's perceived) '''pivot probability''' that candidates ''i'' and ''j'' will be tied for the most total points to win the election.

Then the voter's '''prospective rating''' for a candidate ''i'' is defined as:

: &lt;math&gt;R_i = \sum_{j \neq i} \; p_{ij} \cdot (u_i - u_j)\,&lt;/math&gt;

The gain in expected utility for a given vote is given by:

: &lt;math&gt;G(p,v,u) = \sum_{i=1}^k \; v_i \cdot R_i\,&lt;/math&gt;

The gain in expected utility can be maximized by choosing a vote with suitable values of ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, depending on the voting method and the voter's prospective ratings for each candidate.  For specific voting methods, the gain can be maximized using the following rules:

* Plurality: Vote for the candidate with the highest prospective rating. This is to be distinguished from choosing the best of the frontrunners, which is a common but imprecise plurality tactic. The highest prospective rating can in fact belong to a weak candidate, even the weakest.
* Borda: Rank the candidates in decreasing order of prospective rating.
* Approval: Vote for all candidates that have a positive prospective rating; do not vote for any candidates that have a negative prospective rating.
* Range: Vote the maximum points for all candidates that have a positive prospective rating; vote the minimum allowed value for all candidates that have a negative prospective rating; vote any number of points for a candidate with a prospective rating of zero.

An important special case occurs when the voter has no information about how other voters will vote.  This is sometimes referred to as the '''zero information strategy'''.  In this special case, the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; pivot probabilities are all equal and the rules for the specific voting methods become:

* Plurality: Vote for the most preferred (highest utility) candidate.  This is the sincere plurality vote.
* Borda: Rank the candidates in decreasing order preference (decreasing order of utility).  This is the sincere ranking of the candidates.
* Approval: Calculate the average utility of all candidates.  Vote for all candidates that have a higher-than-average utility; do not vote for any candidates that have a lower-than-average utility.
* Range: Calculate the average utility of all candidates.  Vote the maximum points for all candidates that have a higher-than-average utility; vote the minimum points for all candidates that have a lower-than-average utility; vote any value for a candidate with a utility equal to the average.

Myerson and Weber also describe voting equilibria that require all voters use the optimal strategy and all voters share a common set of ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; pivot probabilities.  Because of these additional requirements, such equilibria may in practice be less widely applicable than the strategies.

== Pre-election influence ==

Because tactical voting relies heavily on voters' perception of how other voters intend to vote, campaigns in electoral methods that promote compromise frequently focus on affecting voter's perception of campaign viability.  Most campaigns craft refined media strategies to shape the way voters see their candidacy.  During this phase, there can be an analogous effect where campaign donors and activists may decide whether or not to support candidates tactically with their money and labor.

In [[rolling election]]s, or [[Two-round system|runoff votes]], where some voters have information about previous voters' preferences (e.g. presidential [[primary election|primaries]] in the [[United States]], [[France|French]] presidential elections), candidates put disproportionate resources into competing strongly in the first few stages, because those stages affect the reaction of later stages.

== Views on tactical voting ==
{{Original research|section|date=May 2011}}
Some people view tactical voting as providing misleading information. In this view, a ballot paper is asking the question "which of these candidates is the best?". This means that if one votes for a candidate who one does not believe is the best, then one is lying.
British Labour Party politician [[Anne Begg]] said of tactical voting:

: "Tactical voting is fine in theory and as an intellectual discussion in the drawing room or living rooms around the country, but when you actually get to polling day and you have to vote against your principles, then it is much harder to do." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1091208.stm|title=Electorate may vote tactically - Kennedy|author=|date=28 December 2000|publisher=|accessdate=5 April 2018|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tactical voting is commonly regarded{{by whom|date=April 2017}} as a problem, since it makes the actual ballot into a nontrivial [[Game theory|game]], where voters react and counter-react to what they expect other voters' strategies to be. A game such as this might even result in a worse alternative being chosen, because most of the voters used it as a strategic tool. However the existence of limited tactical voting can be thought to increase the quality of the candidates elected because it takes into account not just the "ranking" of the candidates but also the utilities.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

[[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] and the [[Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem]] prove that any useful single-winner voting method based on preference ranking is prone to some kind of manipulation. However, some{{who|date=April 2017}} use [[game theory]] to search for some kind of "minimally manipulatable" ([[incentive compatibility]]) voting schemes.

Game theory can also be used to analyze the pros and cons of different methods. For instance, under purely honest voting, [[Condorcet method]]-like methods tend to settle on compromise candidates, while [[Instant-runoff voting|Instant-Runoff Voting]] favors those candidates which have strong core support - who may often be more extremist.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} An electorate using one of these two methods but which (in the general or the specific case) preferred the characteristics of the other method could consciously use strategy to achieve a result more characteristic of the other method. Under Condorcet, they may be able to win by "burying" the compromise candidate (although this risks throwing the election to the opposing extreme); while under IRV, they could always "compromise". It could be argued that in this case the option to vote tactically or not actually helps the electorate express its will, not only on which candidate is better, but on whether compromise is desirable.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} (This never applies to "sneakier" tactics such as push-over.)

Tactical voting greatly complicates the comparative analysis of voting methods. If tactical voting were to become significant, the perceived "advantages" of a given voting method (that is, tending towards compromise or favoring core support) could turn into disadvantages - and, more surprisingly, vice versa.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

== Influence of voting method ==
Tactical voting is highly dependent on the voting method being used. A tactical vote which improves a voter's satisfaction under one method could make no change or lead to a less-satisfying result under another method.

Moreover, although by the Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem no deterministic single-winner voting method is immune to tactical voting in all cases, some methods' results are more resistant to tactical voting than others'. M. Badinski and R. Laraki, the inventors of the [[majority judgment]] method, performed an initial investigation of this question using a set of [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] simulated elections based on the results from a poll of the [[2007 French presidential election]] which they had carried out using rated ballots. Comparing [[range voting]], [[Borda count]], [[plurality voting]], [[approval voting]] with two different absolute approval thresholds, [[Condorcet voting]], and [[majority judgment]], they found that range voting had the highest (worst) strategic vulnerability, while their own method majority judgment had the lowest (best).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Balinski M. and R. Laraki (2007) «Election by Majority Judgement: Experimental Evidence». Cahier du Laboratoire d’Econométrie de l’Ecole Polytechnique 2007-28. Chapter in the book: «In Situ and Laboratory Experiments on Electoral Law Reform: French Presidential Elections», Edited by Bernard Dolez, Bernard Grofman and Annie Laurent. Springer, to appear in 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Further investigation would be needed to be sure that this result remained true with different sets of candidates.

== In particular methods ==
&lt;!-- this section should explain how to tactically vote in various methods, or at least what they're vulnerable to --&gt;

=== Plurality voting ===
{{See also|Plurality voting#Tactical_voting}}
Tactical voting by '''compromising''' is exceedingly common in [[plurality voting method|plurality]] elections. The most typical tactic is to assess which two candidates are frontrunners (most likely to win) and to vote for the preferred one of those two, even if a third candidate is preferred over both. [[Duverger's law]] argues that this kind of tactical voting, along with the [[spoiler effect]] which can arise when such tactics are not used, will be so common that any method based on plurality will eventually result in two-party domination. Although this "law" is just an empirical observation rather than a mathematical certainty, it is generally supported by the evidence.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Due to the especially deep impact of tactical voting in such a method, some argue that systems with three or more strong or persistent parties become in effect forms of [[disapproval voting]], where the expression of disapproval in order to keep an opponent out of office overwhelms the expression of approval to elect a desirable candidate.

=== Party-list Proportional Representation ===
The presence of an [[electoral threshold]] (typically at around 5% or 4%) can lead to voters voting tactically for a different party to their preferred political party (which may be more hardline or more moderate) in order to ensure that the party passes the threshold. An alliance of parties can fail to win a majority despite outpolling their rivals if one party in the alliance falls beneath the threshold. An example of this is the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 2009|2009 Norwegian election]] in which the right-wing opposition parties won more votes between them than the parties in the governing coalition, but the narrow failure of the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]] to cross the 4% threshold led to the governing coalition winning a majority.

This effect has sometimes been nicknamed "Comrade 4%" in Sweden, where the electoral threshold is 4%, particularly when referring to supporters of the [[Social Democrats (Sweden)|Social Democrats]] who vote tactically for the more hardline [[Left Party (Sweden)|Left Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald Granberg, Sören Holmberg (2010) «The Political System Matters: Social Psychology and Voting Behavior in Sweden and the United States (European Monographs in Social Psychology) ». Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newpol.org/content/sweden-when-voters-turn-right-right-turns-left|title=In Sweden, When the Voters Turn Right, the Right Turns Left  - New Politics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[German federal election, 2013|2013 German federal election]], the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] got only 4.8% of the votes so did not meet the 5% threshold. The party did not win any directly elected seats, so for the first time since 1949 was not represented in the [[Bundestag]].  Hence their ally the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] had to form a [[grand coalition]] with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]].

In several recent elections in New Zealand the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] has suggested that National supporters in certain electorates should vote for minor parties or candidates who can win an electorate seat and would support a National government.This culminated in the [[Tea tape scandal]] when a meeting in the [[Epsom (NZ electorate)|Epsom electorate]] in [[New Zealand general election, 2011|2011]] was taped. The meeting was to encourage National voters in the electorate to vote "strategically" for the [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] candidate; and it was suggested that [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] voters in the electorate should vote "strategically" for the National candidate as the Labour candidate could not win the seat but a National win in the seat would deprive National of an ally. The two major parties National and Labour always top up their electorate MPs with list MPs, so a National win in the seat would not increase the number of National MPs.

Even in countries with a low threshold such as the [[Netherlands]], tactical voting can still happen for other reasons. In the campaign for the [[Dutch general election, 2012|2012 Dutch election]], the [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]] had enjoyed good poll ratings, but many voters who preferred the Socialists voted instead for the more centrist [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] out of fear that a strong showing from the Socialists would lead to political deadlock. It was also suggested that a symmetrical effect on the right caused the [[Party for Freedom]] to lose support to the more centrist [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy|VVD]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-09-13/news/sns-rt-us-dutch-election-radicalsbre88c132-20120913_1_euro-zone-rutte-s-liberals-liberal-christian-democrat|title=Dutch vote ends resistible rise of radicals|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In elections which there are many party lists competing with only a few seats, such as [[Hong Kong Legislative Council]] election, the outcome will tend to be similar to that of [[single non-transferable vote]] (SNTV): only the first candidate in a list will win. In such elections parties will split the candidates into multiple lists, since competing using "remainder" votes in both lists is easier than having "full quota" votes plus "remainder" votes if the party puts their candidates in a single list, and a list reaching "full quota" vote is considered a [[wasted vote|waste]]. In such elections the behavior of voters is similar that of SNTV elections: voters will avoid a candidate reaching the "full quota", and spread their votes to other candidates that have potential to win.

=== Majority judgment ===
{{See also|Majority judgment#Satisfied_and_failed_criteria}}
In [[Majority judgment]], strategy is typically "semi-honest exaggeration." Voters exaggerate the difference between a certain pair of candidates but do not rank any less-preferred candidate over any more-preferred one. Even this form of exaggeration can only have an effect if the voter's honest rating for the intended winner is below that candidate's median rating or their honest rating for the intended loser is above it.

Typically, this would not be the case unless there were two similar candidates favored by the same set of voters. A strategic vote against a similar rival could result in a favored candidate winning; although if voters for both similar rivals used this strategy, it could cause a candidate favored by neither of these voter groups to win.

[[Michel Balinski|Balinski]] and Laraki argue that since under Majority judgment, many voters have no opportunity to use strategy, in a test using simulated elections based on polling data, this method is the most strategy-resistant of the ones that the authors studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/707923182|title=Majority judgment : measuring, ranking, and electing|last=L.|first=Balinski, M.|others=Laraki, Rida.|isbn=9780262015134|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=707923182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Approval voting ===
{{See also|Approval voting#Strategic_voting}}
Similarly, in [[approval voting]], unlike many other methods, strategy almost never involves ranking a less-preferred candidate over a more-preferred one.&lt;ref&gt;Such situations can only arise with more than 3 candidates. The only actual example known is a 6-way tie in which most voters only care which of three pairs of candidates the winner comes from, and a few voters only care which member of each pair wins. Smith, Warren [http://www.math.temple.edu/~wds/homepage/newgibbsat.pdf Completion of Gibbard–Satterthwaite impossibility theorem; range voting and voter honesty]{{dead link|date=March 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, strategy is in fact inevitable when a voter decides their "approval cutoff"; this is a variation of the '''compromising''' strategy. Overall, [[Steven Brams]] and [[Dudley R. Herschbach]] argued in a paper in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' magazine in 2001 that [[approval voting]] was the method least amenable to tactical perturbations. Meanwhile, Balinski and Laraki used rated ballots from a poll of the [[2007 French presidential election]] to show that, if unstrategic voters only approved candidates whom they considered "very good" or better, strategic voters would be able to sway the result frequently, but that if unstrategic voters approved all candidates they considered "good" or better, approval was the second most strategy-resistant method of the ones they studied.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Approval voting forces voters to face an initial voting tactical decision as to whether to vote for (or approve) of their second-choice candidate or not. The voter may want to retain expression of preference of their favorite candidate over their second choice. But that does not allow the same voter to express preference of their second choice over any other.  One simple situation in which Approval strategy is important is if there is a close election between two similar candidates A and B and one distinct one Z, in which Z has 49% support. If all of Z's supporters approve just him, in hopes of him getting just enough to win, then supporters of A are faced with a tactical choice of whether to approve A and B (getting one of their preferred choices but having no say in which) or approving just A (possibly helping choose her over B, but risking throwing the election to Z). B's supporters face the same dilemma.

=== Score voting ===
{{See also|Score voting#Strategy}}
In [[score voting]], strategic voters who expect all other voters to be strategic will '''exaggerate''' their true preferences and use the same quasi-'''compromising''' strategy as in approval voting, above. That is, they will give all candidates either the highest possible or the lowest possible rating. This presents an additional problem as compared to the approval method if some voters give honest "weak" votes with middle rankings and other voters give strategic approval votes. A strategic minority could overpower an honest majority. To minimize this problem, some score voting advocates {{Who|date=September 2009}} suggest measures such as education or ballot design to encourage uninformed voters to give more-extreme rankings. A different path to minimize this problem is to use median scores instead of total scores, as median scores are less amenable to exaggeration, as in [[majority judgment]].

However, if all voter factions have the same proportion of strategic and honest voters, simulations show that any significant proportion of honest voters will lead to results which tend to be more satisfying to voters than approval voting, and indeed, more satisfying than any other method with the same unbiased proportion of strategic voters.&lt;ref&gt;William Poundstone, ''Gaming the Vote'',  p238&lt;/ref&gt;

Tactical voters are faced with the initial tactic as to how highly to score their second-choice candidate. The voter may want to retain expression of a high preference of their favorite candidate over their second choice. But that does not allow the same voter to express a high preference of their second choice over any others.

In a simulation study using polling data collected under a majority judgment method, that method's designers found that score voting was more vulnerable to strategy than any other method they studied, including plurality.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=== Instant runoff voting ===
{{See also|Instant-runoff voting#Resistance_to_tactical_voting}}
[[Instant-runoff voting|Instant runoff voting]] is vulnerable to '''push-over''' and '''compromising''' strategies (although it is less vulnerable to '''compromising''' than the plurality method). '''Bullet voting''' is ineffective under Instant-runoff, since Instant-runoff satisfies the [[later-no-harm criterion]].

=== Condorcet ===
{{See also|Condorcet method#Potential_for_tactical_voting}}
[[Condorcet method]]s have a further-reduced incentive for the '''compromising strategy''', but they have some vulnerability to the '''burying strategy'''. The extent of this vulnerability depends on the particular Condorcet method. Some Condorcet methods arguably reduce the vulnerability to '''burying''' to the point where it is no longer a significant problem. All guaranteed Condorcet methods are vulnerable to the '''bullet voting strategy''', because they violate the [[later-no-harm criterion]].

=== Borda ===
{{See also|Borda count#Potential_for_tactical_manipulation}}
The [[Borda count]] has both a strong '''compromising''' incentive and a large vulnerability to '''burying'''. Here is a hypothetical example of both factors at the same time: if there are two candidates the most likely to win, the voter can maximize the impact on the contest between these candidates by ranking the candidate the voter likes more in first place, ranking the candidate whom they like less in last place. If neither candidate is the sincere first or last choice, the voter is using both the compromising and burying strategies at once. If many different groups voters use this strategy, this gives a paradoxical advantage to the candidate generally thought least likely to win.

=== Single transferable vote ===
{{See also|Single transferable vote#Tactics}}
The [[Single transferable vote]] has an incentive for '''free riding''', a form of '''compromising''' strategy sometimes used in proportional representation methods. If one's top-choice candidate is elected, only a fraction of one's vote will be transferred to one's next-favoured candidate. If one feels the favoured candidate is certain to be elected in any case, insincerely ranking the second candidate first guarantees them a full vote if needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m-schulze.9mail.de/schulze2.pdf|title=Free Riding and Vote Management under Proportional Representation by the Single Transferable Vote|first=Markus|last=Schulze|accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the greater the certainty of the first candidate being elected, the bigger their likely surplus, the higher the fraction of the vote that would be transferred to the next candidate, and hence the lower the proportionate benefit of tactical voting.

More sophisticated tactics may be practicable where the number of candidates, voters and/or seats to be filled is relatively small.

Some forms of STV allow tactical voters to gain an advantage by listing a candidate who is very likely to lose in first place, as a form of ''pushover''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.votingmatters.org.uk/ISSUE1/P3.HTM|title=Computer counting in STV elections|date=March 1994|last=Woodall|first=Douglas R.|accessdate=6 March 2011|publisher=McDougall Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Counting Single Transferable Votes|Meek's method]] essentially eliminates this strategy.

== Tactical unwind ==
The term "tactical unwind" is used by some political scientists and commentators to refer to the phenomenon when tactical voting takes place in one general election but in subsequent elections voters revert to their normal patterns.

He stressed that the white race was invented as "a ruling class social control formation."&lt;ref name="perryintro"&gt;{{cite book | last = Perry | first = Jeffrey B. | chapter = Introduction | editor-last = Allen | editor-first = Theodore W. | title = Class Struggle and the Origin of Racial Slavery: The Invention of the White Race | url = http://clogic.eserver.org/2006/allen.html |publisher= Center for the Study of Working Class Life, SUNY, Stony Brook | location = Stony Brook, NY |origyear=1975 |year=2006 | oclc = 244189582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An independent, working-class scholar, Allen did research for the next quarter century to expand and document his ideas, particularly on the relation of [[white supremacy]] to the working class. He published a two-volume work, ''The Invention of the White Race'' (1994 and 1997): "The Invention of the White Race," Vol. 1: "Racial Oppression and Social Control" (1994, 2012)&lt;ref name="Intervention_Vol_I"&gt;{{cite book | last = Allen | first = Theodore W. | title = The Invention of the White Race: Volume 1, Racial Oppression and Social Control | url = http://www.versobooks.com/books/1039-the-invention-of-the-white-race-volume-1 |publisher=Verso Books | location = London |origyear=1994 |year=2012| isbn = 9781844677696}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "The Invention of the White Race," Vol. 2: "The Origin of Racial Oppression in Anglo-America" (1997, 2012);&lt;ref name="Intervention_Vol_II"&gt;{{cite book | last = Allen | first = Theodore W. | title = The Invention of the White Race: Volume 2, The Origin of Racial Oppression in Anglo-America | url = http://www.versobooks.com/books/1048-the-invention-of-the-white-race-volume-2 |publisher=Verso Books | location = London |origyear=1997 |year=2012| isbn = 9781844677702}}&lt;/ref&gt; which explored racial oppression as a system of social control (in Volume 1) and the origin of racial oppression in Anglo-America (in Volume 2). It was republished by [[Verso Books]] in a new expanded edition in November 2012.&lt;ref name="Intervention_Vol_I" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Intervention_Vol_II" /&gt;

==Early life and education==
Theodore William Allen was born into a [[middle-class]] family in Indianapolis, Indiana. He had a sister Eula May and brother Tom; their parents were Thomas E.  Allen, a sales manager, and Almeda Earl Allen, a housewife. The family moved when he was a child to [[Paintsville, Kentucky]], and then to [[Huntington, West Virginia]], where he lived and, in his words, "was proletarianized" during the [[Great Depression]]. When Allen started working soon after high school (deciding that college did not do enough for independent thought), he quickly joined labor unions.&lt;ref name="perryintro"/&gt;

==Career==
Allen became an early activist and organizer in the labor movement. At age 17, he joined the [[American Federation of Musicians]] Local 362 and the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Haywood | first = Harry | authorlink = Harry Haywood | chapter = Introduction | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bHc44CrYKccC&amp;pg=PR21 | editor-first = Gwendolyn | editor-last = Midlo Hall | editorlink = Gwendolyn Midlo Hall | title = A Black Communist in the Freedom Struggle: The Life of Harry Haywood | page = xxi | publisher = University of Minnesota Press | location = Minneapolis | year = 2012 |origyear=1978 | isbn = 9780816679058 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Staudenmaier | first = Michael | chapter = "A Science of Navigation" | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uQSmXBV5R9YC&amp;pg=PA84 | title = Truth and Revolution: A History of the Sojourner Truth Organization 1968 - 1986 | page = 84 | publisher = AK Press | location = Oakland, California, Edinburgh, and Baltimore | year = 2012 | isbn = 9781849350976 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon was elected as a delegate to the Huntington Central Labor Union, AFL. He subsequently worked as a coal miner in West Virginia as a member of the United Mine Workers, serving as an organizer and president of one Local and later member of another. He also co-developed a trade union organizing program for the Marion County, West Virginia Industrial Union Council, [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]].&lt;ref name="perryintro"/&gt;

In the 1940s Allen moved to New York City, a center for labor activism and intellectual work. He did industrial economic research at the [[Labor Research Association]], based in the city. He taught economics at the [[Jefferson School of Social Science]], founded in New York by the Communist Party in 1944. Allen taught there into the 1950s, when the school closed, due to declining membership in the party and pressure from scrutiny by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) of Congress, which was conducting hearings during the [[McCarthy era]].

Allen also taught math at the Crown Heights Yeshiva in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]], where he lived, and the Grace Church School in New York.&lt;ref name="perryintro"/&gt; During his more than six decades in New York, Allen had a variety of jobs, from factory worker to retail clerk, mechanical design draftsman, postal mail handler (and member of the Local of the National Postal Mail Handlers Union), and librarian at the Brooklyn Public Library.&lt;ref name="perryintro"/&gt;

Beginning in 1965, he was published as an independent scholar. He conducted decades of research to develop his ideas about the labor, class and racial history of the United States.&lt;ref name="perryintro"/&gt;

==Writings==
In 1965 Allen published articles on the concept of [[white skin privilege]]&lt;ref&gt;Allen urged, in a 1965 John Brown Commemoration Committee "Call," that "[[White Americans]] who want government of the people, by the people, must begin by first repudiating their white skin privileges and the white 'gentleman's agreement' against the [[Negro]]."

After beginning his research on "white skin privilege" in 1965, Allen worked for the next decade to develop more research and writing on this topic. He published ''Class Struggle and the Origin of Racial Slavery: The Invention of the White Race'' (1975). During this time, he also taught as an adjunct history instructor for one semester at Essex County Community College in [[Newark, New Jersey]]. He was described by historian Jeffrey B. Perry as working "throughout his entire adult life ... for the emancipation of the working class and for socialism."&lt;ref name="perryintro"/&gt;

His work since the 1960s was intended to overturn explanations for [[white supremacy]] that relied on biology or attributed it to benefits gained by the working class. Allen emphasized that the "invention of the white race" was related to class struggle and to ruling class efforts to maintain social control.&lt;ref name="perryintro"/&gt;

Allen published outside the academic press and his work was highly influential, at a time of the [[civil rights movement]], when issues of race, ethnicity and culture were being studied and overturned. He also documented how later Irish immigrants to the U.S. became "white."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Allen | first = Theodore W. | title = The Invention of the White Race: Volume 1, Racial Oppression and Social Control | url = http://www.versobooks.com/books/1039-the-invention-of-the-white-race-volume-1 |publisher=Verso Books | location = London |origyear=1994 |year=2012| isbn = 9781844677696}} Chapters 6 through 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of "race" was also being overturned by work in anthropology, genetics, biology, history and other disciplines. By 1997, historian [[George M. Fredrickson]] of [[Stanford University]] wrote that "the proposition that race is 'a social and cultural construction,' has become an academic cliché,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Frederickson | first = George M. | title = America's Caste System: Will It Change? | journal = [[New York Review of Books]] | page = 68 | publisher =  | date = 23 October 1997 | url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1997/oct/23/americas-caste-system-will-it-change/ | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Allen was not satisfied with that proposition and he emphasized that "the 'white race' must be understood, not simply as a social construct (rather than an genetic phenomenon), but as a ruling class social control formation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Allen | first = Theodore W. | title = Summary of the Argument of "''The Invention of the White Race''" (Part One) | journal = Cultural Logic: Marxist Theory and Practice | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | publisher = Theodore W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1492">In the [[United States]], '''Tobacco quotas''' ([[poundage quotas]], and in some cases [[acreage allotment]]s) were a supply control feature of federal price support for tobacco. Burley tobacco was subject to marketing quotas and flue-cured tobacco was subject to marketing quotas and acreage allotments. [[Tobacco quota owners]] (owners of farmland to which quota is assigned) voted every three years on whether or not to continue with price support (through no-net-cost loans) and marketing quotas. Producers of several minor tobaccos (including Maryland (type 32), Pennsylvania cigar-filler (type 41), and Connecticut Valley cigar-binder (types
51-52)) had disapproved federal support. The national marketing quota (basic quota) was calculated according to a formula specified by law that included consideration of intended purchases by domestic manufacturers, average exports over the preceding three years, and reserve stock requirements. The effective quota was the basic quota plus and minus temporary adjustments for allowable previous year under and over marketings. The [[Fair and Equitable Tobacco Reform Act]] of 2004 (P.L. 108-357, Title VI) ended tobacco quotas for 2005 crop and subsequent years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10908">'''Walter T. Brown''' (b. Aug 1937) is a [[young Earth creationist]], who is the director of his own ministry called the Center for Scientific Creation. ''[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]'' considers him to be one of the leaders of the [[creation science]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://skepdic.com/creation.html |chapter=Creationism and creation science|title=The Skeptics Dictionary: A Collection of Strange Beliefs, Amusing Deceptions, and Dangerous Delusions|first=Robert Todd |last=Carroll|publisher= Wiley|edition= 1st|date=August 15, 2003 |isbn=0-471-27242-6|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposes a specific version of [[flood geology]] called the Hydroplate Theory. He is a retired army officer with a degree in mechanical engineering. 

== Biography ==
Brown has a [[Ph.D.]] in [[mechanical engineering]] from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], a B.S. from [[West Point]] and he served as an officer in the [[Military of the United States of America|United States military]] until he retired in 1980.&lt;ref name="online edition"&gt;"About the Author," ''Center for Scientific Creation'', ''In the Beginning: Compelling Evidence for Creation and the Flood (7th ed.)'' ([http://www.creationscience.com/onlinebook/ online edition]). Accessed 27 December 2007. {{ISBN|1-932307-22-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since retiring from the military in 1980, Brown has been the director of his "Center for Scientific Creation" and has done his own research, writing, and speaking on origins theory.&lt;ref name="online edition" /&gt; In 1998, Brown was appointed to a committee reviewing Arizona's state science standards. Evolution was retained in the Arizona state science standards after a final decision in August 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jinnetics.tripod.com/sp.html ''Evolution education now added to state high school standards''], Jayson Peters

==Hydroplate Theory==
In Brown's ''In the Beginning: Compelling Evidence for Creation and the Flood'' he suggests evidence against [[evolution]] and for [[creation science]] and [[flood geology]] (including [[hydroplates]]). It is divided into three sections, the first of which explores discoveries made by scientists that do not fit the theory of [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creationscience.com/onlinebook/LifeSciences8.html CreationScience.com{{spaced ndash}}5. Natural Selection]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2015}} The second section outlines various alternate explanations to geological and astronomical subjects such as the [[mid-oceanic ridge]] and [[comet]]s, which Brown states evolutionary science cannot explain. The final section presents a variety of other questions encountered in the [[creation-evolution controversy]].

In 1989, the Creation/Evolution journal of the National Center for Science Education published a critique of Brown's theory. [[Jim Lippard]], graduate student of philosophy begins with a criticism focusing primarily on fossil evidence of [[human evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series of articles does not discuss Brown's [[hydroplates|Hydroplate Theory]], apart from Brown's claim that Lippard "dismisses or ignores the bulk of the book and specifically addresses only a very small fraction of its substance."&lt;ref name="brownresp2 " /&gt;

[[Robert T. Pennock]] has described Brown's position as being typical, other than the unique feature of his hydroplates hypothesis, of young-earth creationist's explaining all major terrestrial features in terms of a [[Catastrophism|catastrophic]] [[Flood geology|Biblical flood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Reception==

Walt Brown has had contentious relations with other creationist organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[[talkorigins.org]] [http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/wbdebateoffer.html ''Walter Brown's Debate Offer'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=to&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/wbrown2.html ''More on Walter Brown's debate offer''], [[Jim Foley]], [[TalkOrigins]], September 30, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[Answers in Genesis]] has a standing offer to Brown to publish some of his material in their journals&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creationontheweb.com/content/view/2571/ ''Maintaining Creationist Integrity: A response to Kent Hovind''], [[Carl Wieland]], [[Ken Ham]] and [[Jonathan Sarfati]], [[Creation Ministries International]] [[website]], 11 October 2002
updated 16 December 2002 and 2 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; but Brown has declined.&lt;ref name=to/&gt; The [[old earth creationist]] organization [[Answers in Creation]] has published material rebutting Brown's hydroplate theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answersincreation.org/walter_brown_hydroplate_theory.htm ''Creation Science Rebuttals: Center for Scientific Creationism Walter Brown's Hydroplate Model''], [[Glenn R. Morton]], [[Answers in Creation]] [[website]], copyright 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Christian]] [[American Scientific Affiliation]] website features a video critical of Brown's video "God's Power and Scriptures Authority" by Steven H.

Brown has stated that no "[[evolutionist]]" will publicly debate with him,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/275993.aspx ''The Global Flood as You've Never Seen It''], [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] News, 30 November 2007.
