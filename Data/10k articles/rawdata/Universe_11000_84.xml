}}
A [[gas explosion]] in a residential area of [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]], the third-largest city in [[Argentina]], occurred on August 6, 2013. It was caused by a large gas leak; a nearby building collapsed, and others were at high risk of structural failure. Twenty-two people died, and sixty were injured. Several organizations helped secure the area, search for survivors and aid people who lost their homes. Shortly after the explosion, the time needed for reconstruction was estimated at six months.

The provincial judiciary launched an investigation into the cause of the explosion. Primary suspects were [[Litoral Gas]] (the natural-gas provider for Rosario) and an employee who carried out maintenance work at the building that day. Several public figures sent condolences, and most of the candidates for the [[Argentine legislative election, 2013|2013 primary elections]] suspended their political campaigns.

==The event==
The explosion occurred at 9:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. near the intersection of Oroño and Salta Streets in central [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]]. Initial reports confirmed eight people dead, sixty injured and fifteen missing; eight more deaths were later confirmed.&lt;ref name="explo"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1607985-explosion-edificio-rosario|title= Fuerte explosión en un edificio de Rosario: asciende a 12 el número de muertos y hay al menos 60 heridos|trans-title=Strong explosion in Rosario: the bodycount rises to 12 and there are at least 60 injuries|language= Spanish|date= August 6, 2013|publisher=La Nación|accessdate=September 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Searches the following day revealed twelve fatalities, ten of whom were identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1608306-discrepancias-y-dudas-en-torno-a-la-cantidad-de-muertos-que-dejo-la-explosion-del-edificio-e|title= Discrepancias y dudas en torno a la cantidad de muertos que dejó la explosión del edificio en Rosario|trans-title=Disagreements and doubts about the number of deaths left by the explosion of the building in Rosario|language= Spanish|date= August 7, 2013|publisher=La Nación|accessdate=September 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of people were missing; some were found dead among the debris, while others were rescued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1608630-a-mas-de-40-horas-de-la-explosion-buscan-a-11-desaparecidos-en-rosario|title= A más de 40 horas de la explosión, buscan a 11 desaparecidos en Rosario|trans-title=More than 40 hours after the explosion, 11 disappeared people are still being searched for|language= Spanish|author= Valeria Musse|date= August 8, 2013|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The search for survivors ended on August 13, with twenty-two people confirmed dead.&lt;ref name="veintiuno"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1610126-hallan-tres-cuerpos-mas-y-asciende-a-21-el-numero-de-victimas-en-rosario|title= Hallan tres cuerpos más y asciende a 21 el número de víctimas en Rosario|trans-title=Three more bodies are found, and the bodycount in Rosario rises to 21|language= Spanish|author= José Bordón|date= August 13, 2013|publisher=La Nación|accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.clarin.com/sociedad/explosion-reanudan-busqueda-desaparecidos_0_973102966.html|title= Encontraron dos cuerpos más y son 21 los muertos por la explosión|trans-title=Two more bodies were found, the deaths of the explosion are 32|language= Spanish|author= |date= August 12, 2013|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 65-year-old woman who had been injured died on October 8.&lt;ref name="veintidos"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.clarin.com/sociedad/Tragedia-Rosario-muertos-explosion_0_1007899257.html|title= Tragedia de Rosario: son 22 los muertos por la explosión|trans-title=Tragedy in Rosario: the deaths of the explosion are 22|language= Spanish|author= Mauro Aguilar|date= October 9, 2013|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=January 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The explosion was caused by a gas leak in a 30-year-old building. It severely damaged a nearby nine-story apartment building, causing it to collapse.&lt;ref name="explo"/&gt; [[Mónica Fein]], mayor of Rosario, asked residents to avoid the area because of the risk that more buildings might collapse, and to ease the work of disaster management personnel. The streets were covered with broken glass from damaged buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1607987-las-calles-estan-repletas-de-vidrio-dijo-una-vecina-del-edificio|title= 'Las calles están repletas de vidrio', dijo una vecina del edificio|trans-title='The streets are filled of glass', said a neighbor of the building|language= Spanish|author= |date= August 6, 2013|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gas and electricity were immediately disconnected, and the national government sent an [[Argentine Federal Police]] task force to the scene.&lt;ref name="explo"/&gt;

The natural gas supplier, [[Litoral Gas]], immediately began sealing the distribution pipe to the area.&lt;ref name="norec"/&gt; The Center for Ambulatory Medical Specialties of Rosario ({{lang-es|Centro de Especialidades Médicas Ambulatorias de Rosario}}) managed the information about the dead and injured, and tents were prepared for those left homeless.&lt;ref name="yajus" /&gt; Firefighters and other workers found people trapped on the upper floors of buildings and evacuated them over adjacent roofs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1608023-el-angustiante-rescate-de-los-afectados-por-la-explosion-en-rosario|title= El angustiante rescate de los afectados por la explosión en Rosario|trans-title=The sad rescue of the victims of the explosions in Rosario|language= Spanish|date= August 6, 2013|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=October 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the building was not destroyed by the explosion, a high risk of [[Structural integrity and failure|structural failure]] remained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1608024-un-escape-de-gas-la-causa-del-estallido-ocurrido-en-rosario|title= Un escape de gas, la causa del estallido ocurrido en Rosario|trans-title=A gas leak, the reason of the explosion in Rosario|language= Spanish|author= Juan R.

=={{anchor|Investigations}}Investigation==
Neighbors reported to the press that they had smelled a gas leak several hours before the explosion and had called Litoral Gas. Company director José María González said that the company had received no such calls, and thought that callers might have dialed the 911 emergency number instead.&lt;ref name="norec"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1608004-litoral-gas-dice-que-no-tuvieron-reclamos-en-el-call-center|title= Litoral Gas dice que no tuvieron reclamos en el call center|trans-title=Litoral Gas says they had no requests in the call center|language= Spanish|date= August 6, 2013|publisher=La Nación|accessdate=September 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutor Camporini reported at the trial that the building had experienced several gas leaks before the explosion.&lt;ref name="imputado"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1608598-el-gasista-fue-imputado-por-estrago-culposo-y-esta-muy-comprometido|title= El gasista fue imputado por estrago culposo y está muy comprometido|trans-title=The gas employee was accused and he's very complicated|language= Spanish|author= José Bordón|date= October 8, 2013|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosecutor Graciela Argüelles said that, according to the investigation, Litoral Gas ignored calls for help from García, who was not properly trained to manage such a situation. The judge suggested that documents seized from Litoral Gas might prove the existence of customer reports of a gas leak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1608841-litoral-gas-mas-comprometida-por-la-explosion-en-rosario|title= Litoral Gas, más comprometida por la explosión en Rosario|trans-title=Litoral Gas, more complicated by the explosion in Rosario|language= Spanish|author= José Bordón|date= August 9, 2013|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curto thought that the employees might not bear sole responsibility, and that the liability of Litoral Gas had to be investigated as well.&lt;ref name="cruces"/&gt;

Pablo Miño was released from prison, but Curto refused to release García, saying that Miño had [[extenuating circumstances]] which García did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1609061-explosion-en-rosario-liberan-al-ayudante-del-gasista|title= Explosión en Rosario: niegan la excarcelación del gasista y liberaron al ayudante|trans-title=Explosion in Rosario: release is refused to the gas employee, but granted to his assistant|language= Spanish|author= |date= August 9, 2013|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miño's job was to give García the required tools, not to do the maintenance. He was in the street, watching over the van, which was not properly parked and locked, and did not see García's work before the explosion. Curto stopped short of pronouncing Miño innocent at that early stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1609288-el-gasista-seguira-detenido-y-citan-a-declarar-a-los-directivos-de-la-empresa-litoral-gas|title= El gasista seguirá detenido y citan a declarar a los directivos de la empresa Litoral Gas|trans-title=The gas employee will stay under detention and the heads of Litoral Gas will be prosecuted|language= Spanish|author= José Bordón|date= August 10, 2013|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the case expanded beyond his jurisdiction, Curto [[Judicial disqualification|recused]] himself from the trial and was replaced by [[Javier Beltramone]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1611116-la-tragedia-de-rosario-se-quedo-sin-juez|title= La tragedia de Rosario se quedó sin juez|trans-title=The tragedy in Rosario is left without a judge|language= Spanish|author= |date= August 16, 2013|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; who released García from prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1611717-explosion-en-rosario-liberaron-al-gasista|title= Explosión en Rosario: el juez ordenó la liberación del gasista|trans-title=Explosion in Rosario: the judge ordered the liberation of the gas employee|language= Spanish|author= José Bordón|date= August 17, 2013|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Litoral Gas demanded Beltramone's recusal for expressing an opinion about the case to the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.clarin.com/sociedad/Apartan-juez-investigaba-tragedia-Rosario_0_1008499637.html|title= Apartan al juez que investigaba la tragedia de Rosario|trans-title=The judge investigating the tragedy in Rosario is demoted|language= Spanish|author= Andrés Actis|date= October 10, 2013|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appeal court agreed in a 2–1 vote to remove Beltramone, and the case was transferred to [[Patricia Bilotta]].&lt;ref name="Bilotta"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1627802-separan-al-juez-que-estaba-a-cargo-de-la-investigacion-de-la-explosion-en-rosario|title= Separan al juez que estaba a cargo de la investigación de la explosión en Rosario|trans-title=The judge who was dealing with the investigation of the explosion in Rosario has been removed|language= Spanish|author= José Bordón|date= October 10, 2013|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; García had claimed that he was following instructions received in the days before the explosion, so Bilotta summoned the technical officers of Litoral Gas to clarify that point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lacapital.com.ar/la-ciudad/Salta-2141-Quieren-establecer-si-el-gasista-notifico-a-Litoral-Gas--20131126-0031.html|title= Salta 2141: Quieren establecer si el gasista notificó a Litoral Gas|trans-title=Salta 2141: they want to establish if the gas employee notified Litoral Gas|language= Spanish|author= |date= November 26, 2013|publisher= La Capital|accessdate=February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Litoral Gas said that García had not received any instructions prior to the explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lacapital.com.ar/la-ciudad/Litoral-Gas-dijo-que-el-gasista-no-pidio-permiso-para-proceder-20131127-0032.html|title= Litoral Gas dijo que el gasista no pidió permiso para proceder|trans-title=Litoral Gas said that the gas employee did not ask for permission to proceed|language= Spanish|author= |date= November 27, 2013|publisher= La Capital|accessdate=February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Litoral Gas proposed an [[out-of-court settlement]] to the relatives of the victims, offering about 1200 US dollars per square meter of collapsed building, in addition to compensation for loss of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lacapital.com.ar/la-ciudad/Ahora-Litoral-Gas-les-propone-un-arreglo-economico-a-las-victimas-de-Salta-2141-20131129-0041.html|title= Ahora Litoral Gas les propone un arreglo económico a las víctimas de Salta 2141|trans-title=Now Litoral Gas proposes an economic agreement to the victims of Salta 2141|language= Spanish|author= |date= November 29, 2013|publisher= La Capital|accessdate=February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vice Governor [[Jorge Henn]] rejected it as immoral,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lacapital.com.ar/la-ciudad/El-vicegobernador-Henn-aseguro-que-lo-de-Litoral-Gas-es-inmoral-e-inescrupuloso-20131130-0029.html|title= El vicegobernador Henn aseguró que 'lo de Litoral Gas es inmoral e inescrupuloso'|trans-title=Vicegovernor Henn swore that 'Litoral Gas' proposal is immoral and unscrupulous'|language= Spanish|author= |date= November 30, 2013|publisher= La Capital|accessdate=February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most of the families also initially rejected the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lacapital.com.ar/la-ciudad/Familiares-de-victimas-de-Salta-2141-rechazan-un-ofrecimiento-economico-de-Litoral-Gas-20131128-0037.html|title= Familiares de víctimas de Salta 2141 rechazan un ofrecimiento económico de Litoral Gas|trans-title=Relatives of victims of Salta 2141 reject an economic offering from Litoral Gas|language= Spanish|author= |date= November 28, 2013|publisher= La Capital|accessdate=February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By May 2014, however, almost half of the families had accepted the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lacapital.com.ar/la-ciudad/Casi-la-mitad-de-los-afectados-por-la-explosion-en-Salta-2141-arreglo-con-Litoral-Gas-20140528-0023.html|title= Casi la mitad de los afectados por la explosión en Salta 2141 arregló con Litoral Gas|trans-title=Almost half of those affected by the explosion at Salta 2141 dealt with Litoral Gas|language= Spanish|author= Guillermo Zysman|date= May 28, 2014|publisher= La Capital|accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The explosion occurred shortly before the primary [[Argentine legislative election, 2013|2013 Argentine legislative elections]] on August 11. The governor of Santa Fe province, [[Antonio Bonfatti]], asked the political parties to end their campaigns to allow mourning for the victims of the explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1608063-tras-la-explosion-en-rosario-piden-suspender-la-campana-electoral|title= El gobernador de Santa Fe pidió suspender la campaña electoral|trans-title=The governor of Santa Fe asked to suspend the political campaign|language= Spanish|date= August 6, 2013|publisher=La Nación|accessdate=September 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Front for Victory]] and [[Progressive, Civic and Social Front]] candidates suspended their campaigns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1608140-el-frente-para-la-victoria-dio-por-terminada-su-campana-electoral-en-santa-fe-por-la-tragica|title= El Frente para la Victoria dio por terminada su campaña electoral en Santa Fe por la trágica explosión|trans-title=The Front for Victory considers their political campaign in Santa Fe ended because of the explosion|language= Spanish|date= August 6, 2013|publisher=La Nación|accessdate=September 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1608289-la-tragedia-dejo-en-suspenso-la-campana|title= La tragedia dejó en suspenso la campaña|trans-title=The tragedy suspended the campaign|language= Spanish|date= August 7, 2013|publisher=La Nación|accessdate=September 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the national government declared two days of [[National day of mourning|mourning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1608358-el-gobierno-declaro-duelo-de-dos-dias-por-la-explosion-de-rosario|title= El Gobierno declaró duelo de dos días por la explosión de Rosario|trans-title=The government issued a two-days mourning for the explosion in Rosario|language= Spanish|author= |date= August 7, 2013|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The period of mourning was observed by all candidates in Buenos Aires and most other provinces, who ended their political campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1608625-sin-actos-el-final-de-la-campana-quedo-tenido-por-la-tragedia-de-rosario|title= Sin actos, el final de la campaña quedó teñido por la tragedia de Rosario|trans-title=Without events, the end of the political campaign was stained by the tragedy in Rosario|language= Spanish|author= |date= August 8, 2013|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]], who had recently returned from a diplomatic visit to the [[United Nations]], visited the site of the explosion on August 7. She was berated by local residents;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1608374-cristina-kirchner-llego-a-rosario-para-recorrer-la-zona-de-la-tragica-explosion|title= Cristina Kirchner visitó la zona de la explosión en Rosario y recibió insultos de los vecinos|trans-title=Cristina Kirchner visited the area of the explosion in Rosario and received insults from the neighbors|language= Spanish|author= Diego Yañez Martínez|date= August 7, 2013|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; some were angry because her surprise visit halted work at the site, and others thought her presence was politically motivated.&lt;ref name="echada"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1608637-insultos-y-abucheos-a-cristina-cuando-visito-el-lugar-de-la-tragedia|title= Insultos y abucheos a Cristina cuando visitó el lugar de la tragedia|trans-title=Insults and booings for Cristina when she visited the place of the tragedy|language= Spanish|author= Valeria Musse|date= August 8, 2013|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president stayed briefly, visited the CEMAR and met Bonfatti.&lt;ref name="echada" /&gt; Kirchner's entourage was surrounded by members of [[La Cámpora]], who tried to prevent demonstrations against her and keep journalists and residents at bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1608558-cruces-entre-militantes-de-la-campora-y-vecinos-por-la-llegada-de-cristina-kirchner-a-rosari|title= Cruces entre militantes de La Cámpora y vecinos por la llegada de Cristina Kirchner a Rosario|trans-title=Clash between militants of La Cámpora and neighbors for the arrival of Cristina Kirchner to Rosario|language= Spanish|author= Diego Yañez Martínez|date= August 8, 2013|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weeks before the explosion, several [[social networking sites]] had scheduled a country-wide ''[[cacerolazo]]'' (a pot-banging protest demonstration), known as 8A, against Kirchner for August 8. The websites had already conducted successful ''cacerolazos'' ([[8N]] and [[18A]]). Despite the national mourning, the 8A protest went ahead as planned, with the added slogan "No more pointless deaths".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1608626-el-8-a-sigue-en-pie-con-la-consigna-no-mas-muertes-inutiles|title= El 8-A sigue en pie, con la consigna 'no más muertes inútiles'|trans-title=The 8-A still stands, with the slogan 'no more pointless deaths'|language= Spanish|author= Mariano Obarrio|date= August 8, 2013|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Candidate [[Ricardo Gil Lavedra]] thought the ''cacerolazo'' should have been canceled, as the campaigning was,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1608671-ricardo-gil-lavedra-hoy-no-deberia-hacerse-la-protesta-del-8a|title= Ricardo Gil Lavedra: 'Hoy no debería hacerse la protesta del 8A'|trans-title=Ricardo Gil Lavedra: 'The 8A protest should not be made today'|language= Spanish|author= |date= August 8, 2013|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but fellow candidate [[Rodolfo Terragno]] supported it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1608833-rodolfo-terragno-y-ricardo-gil-lavedra-respaldaron-el-cacerolazo|title= Rodolfo Terragno y Ricardo Gil Lavedra respaldaron el cacerolazo|trans-title=Rodolfo Terragno and Ricardo Gil Lavedra supported the cacerolazo|language= Spanish|author= DyN|date= August 8, 2013|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was attended by fewer people than previous ones in Buenos Aires and the rest of the country.&lt;ref name="ochoa"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1608973-con-una-protesta-menos-masiva-el-8-a-movilizo-a-los-caceroleros-mas-duros|title= Con una protesta menos masiva, el 8-A movilizó a los caceroleros más duros|trans-title=With a less massive protest, the 8-A movilized the strongest caceroleros|language= Spanish|author= Aurelio Tomás|date= August 9, 2013|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstration in Rosario was not a ''cacerolazo'', but a silent [[candlelight vigil]] attended by nearly a hundred people.&lt;ref name="ochoa" /&gt; There was a second demonstration in Rosario on August 22, proceeding from the [[National Flag Memorial (Argentina)|National Flag Memorial]] to the headquarters of Litoral Gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.clarin.com/sociedad/Hoy-hacen-marcha-silencio_0_979102344.html|title= Hoy hacen una marcha del silencio|trans-title=There's a silent demonstration today|language= Spanish|author= |date= August 22, 2013|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lacapital.com.ar/contenidos/2013/08/20/noticia_0054.html|title= La mamá de Laguia participará de la marcha 'para pedir justicia'|trans-title=The mother of Laguia will take part in the demonstration 'to ask for justice'|language= Spanish|author= |date= August 20, 2013|publisher= La Capital|accessdate=February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reconstruction==
Bonfatti announced that Santa Fe province would provide financial help to the victims of the explosion. Since most houses in the vicinity were damaged, affected families would receive a subsidy of $20,000 to rent homes during reconstruction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8122">'''Acceptance angle''' is the maximum angle at which incoming [[sunlight]] can be captured by a [[solar concentrator]]. Its value depends on the concentration of the optic and the [[refractive index]] in which the receiver is immersed. Maximizing the acceptance angle of a concentrator is desirable in practical systems and it may be achieved by using [[nonimaging optics]].

For concentrators that concentrate light in two dimensions, the acceptance angle may be different in the two directions.

==Definition==
[[Image:Acceptance Angle-Acceptance Angle.png|400px|thumb|right|Acceptance angle]]
The "acceptance angle" figure illustrates this concept.

The concentrator is a [[lens (optics)|lens]] with a receiver ''R''. The left section of the figure shows a set of parallel [[Ray (optics)|ray]]s incident on the concentrator at an angle ''&amp;alpha;''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''&amp;theta;'' to the [[optical axis]]. All rays end up on the receiver and, therefore, all light is captured. In the center, this figure shows another set of parallel rays, now incident on the concentrator at an angle ''&amp;alpha;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''&amp;theta;'' to the optical axis. For an ideal concentrator, all rays are still captured. However, on the right, this figure shows yet another set of parallel rays, now incident on the concentrator at an angle ''&amp;alpha;''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''&amp;theta;'' to the optical axis. All rays now miss the receiver and all light is lost. Therefore, for incidence angles ''&amp;alpha;''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''&amp;theta;'' all light is captured while for incidence angles ''&amp;alpha;''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''&amp;theta;'' all light is lost. The concentrator is then said to have an (half) acceptance angle ''&amp;theta;'', or a total acceptance angle 2''&amp;theta;'' (since it accepts light within an angle ±''&amp;theta;'' to the optical axis).

[[Image:Acceptance Angle-Transmission Curve.png|300px|thumb|left|Transmission curves]]
Ideally, a solar concentrator has a [[transmission curve]] ''c''&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; as shown in the "transmission curves" figure. Transmission (efficiency) is ''&amp;tau;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 for all incidence angles ''&amp;alpha;''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''&amp;theta;''&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; and ''&amp;tau;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 for all incidence angles ''&amp;alpha;''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''&amp;theta;''&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;.

In practice, real transmission curves are not perfect and they typically have a shape similar to that of curve ''c''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;, which is normalized so that ''&amp;tau;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 for ''&amp;alpha;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. In that case, the real acceptance angle ''&amp;theta;''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is typically defined as the angle for which transmission ''&amp;tau;'' drops to 90% of its maximum.&lt;ref name="FK"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Pablo |last=Benitez |title=High performance Fresnel-based photovoltaic concentrator |date=26 April 2010 |volume=18 |issue=S1 |journal=Optics Express |page=A25 |doi=10.1364/OE.18.000A25|display-authors=etal|bibcode=2010OExpr..18S..25B }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{-}}

For line-focus systems, such as a [[Parabolic trough | trough concentrator]] or a linear [[Fresnel lens]], the acceptance angle is one dimensional, and the concentration has only weak dependence on off-pointing perpendicular to the focus direction.  Point focus systems, on the other hand, are sensitive to off-pointing in both directions.  In the general case, the acceptance angle in one direction may be different from the other.

==Acceptance angle as a tolerance budget==

The acceptance angle ''&amp;theta;'' of a concentrator may be seen as a measure of how precisely it must [[Solar tracking|track]] the sun in the sky. The smaller the ''&amp;theta;'', the more precise the tracking needs to be or the concentrator will not capture the incoming sunlight. It is, therefore, a measure of the tolerance a concentrator has to tracking errors.

[[Image:Acceptance Angle-Optical Imperfections.png|300px|thumb|right|Optical imperfections]]
However, other errors also affect the acceptance angle. The "optical imperfections" figure shows this.

The left part of the figure shows a perfectly made lens with good optical surfaces ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capturing all light rays incident at an angle ''&amp;alpha;'' to the optical axis. However, real optics are never perfect and the right part of the figure shows the effect of a badly made bottom surface ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Instead of being smooth, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; now has undulations and some of the light rays that were captured before are now lost. This decreases the transmission of the concentrator for incidence angle ''&amp;alpha;'', decreasing the acceptance angle. Actually, any imperfection in the system such as:
*tracking inaccuracy
*imperfectly manufactured optics
*[[optical aberration]]s
*imperfectly assembled components
*movements of the system due to wind
*finite stiffness of the supporting structure
*deformation due to aging
*other imperfections in the system
contributes to a decrease in the acceptance angle of the concentrator. The acceptance angle may then be seen as a "tolerance budget" to be spent on all these imperfections. At the end, the concentrator must still have enough acceptance to capture sunlight which also has some angular dispersion ''&amp;theta;''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; when seen from earth. It is, therefore, very important to design a concentrator with the widest possible acceptance angle. That is possible using [[nonimaging optics]], which maximize the acceptance angle for a given concentration.

[[Image:Acceptance Angle-Angular Aperture Of Sunlight.png|300px|thumb|right|Angular aperture of sunlight]]
Figure "angular aperture of sunlight" on the right shows the effect of the angular dispersion of sunlight on the acceptance angle.

Sunlight is not a set of perfectly parallel rays (shown in blue), but it has a given angular aperture ''&amp;theta;''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;, as indicated by the green rays.  If the acceptance angle of the optic is wide enough, sunlight incident along the optical axis will be captured by the concentrator, as shown in the "angular aperture of sunlight" figure. However, for wider incidence angles ''&amp;alpha;'' some light may be lost, as shown on the right. Perfectly parallel rays (shown in blue) would be captured, but sunlight, due to its angular aperture, is partially lost.

Parallel rays and sunlight are therefore transmitted differently by a solar concentrator and the corresponding transmission curves are also different. Different acceptance angles may then be determined for parallel rays or for sunlight.

==Concentration acceptance product (CAP)==

For a given acceptance angle ''&amp;theta;'', for a point-focus concentrator, the maximum concentration possible, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, is given by

:&lt;math&gt;C_\mathrm{max} = \frac{n^2}{\sin^2\theta} &lt;/math&gt;,

where ''n'' is the refractive index of the [[medium (optics)|medium]] in which the receiver is immersed.&lt;ref name="IntroNio2e"&gt;{{cite book | first = Julio | last = Chaves | title = Introduction to Nonimaging Optics, Second Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e11ECgAAQBAJ | publisher = [[CRC Press]] |  year = 2015 | isbn = 978-1482206739}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, real concentrators either have a lower than ideal concentration for a given acceptance or they have a lower than ideal acceptance angle for a given concentration. This can be summarized in the expression

:&lt;math&gt;CAP =  \sqrt{C} \sin\theta \le n &lt;/math&gt;,

which defines a quantity CAP (concentration acceptance product), which must be smaller than the refractive index of the medium in which the receiver is immersed. 

For a linear-focue concentrator, the equation is not squared&lt;ref&gt;See: http://www.powerfromthesun.net/Book/chapter09/chapter09.html .  Note that in this derivation theta is the full angle, not the half-angle defined here.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C_\mathrm{max} = \frac{n}{\sin\theta} &lt;/math&gt;

The Concentration Acceptance Product is a consequence of the conservation of [[Etendue#Maximum concentration|etendue]].  The higher the CAP, the closer the concentrator is to the maximum possible in concentration and acceptance angle.

{{refimprove|date=December 2017}}
The dynamic stability of an aircraft refers to how the aircraft behaves after it has been disturbed following steady non-oscillating flight.&lt;ref&gt;Etkin, Bernard; Dynamics of Flight; 1982; {{ISBN|0-471-08936-2}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Longitudinal modes==
[[Oscillating]] motions can be described by two parameters, the period of time required for one complete oscillation, and the time required to damp to half-amplitude, or the time to double the [[amplitude]] for a dynamically unstable motion. The longitudinal motion consists of two distinct oscillations, a long-period oscillation called a [[phugoid]] mode and a short-period oscillation referred to as the short-period mode.

===Phugoid (longer period) oscillations===
{{main|Phugoid}}
The longer period mode, called the "phugoid mode" is the one in which there is a large-amplitude variation of air-speed, pitch angle, and altitude, but almost no angle-of-attack variation. The phugoid oscillation is really a slow interchange of [[kinetic energy]] (velocity) and [[potential energy]] (height) about some equilibrium energy level as the aircraft attempts to re-establish the equilibrium level-flight condition from which it had been disturbed. The motion is so slow that the effects of [[inertia]] forces and damping forces are very low. Although the damping is very weak, the period is so long that the pilot usually corrects for this motion without being aware that the oscillation even exists. Typically the period is 20–60 seconds. This oscillation can generally be controlled by the pilot.

===Short period oscillations===
With no special name, the shorter period mode is called simply the "short-period mode".  The short-period mode is a usually heavily damped oscillation with a period of only a few seconds. The motion is a rapid pitching of the aircraft about the center of gravity. The period is so short that the speed does not have time to change, so the oscillation is essentially an angle-of-attack variation. The time to damp the amplitude to one-half of its value is usually on the order of 1 second. Ability to quickly self damp when the stick is briefly displaced is one of the many criteria for general aircraft [[type certificate|certification]].

==Lateral-directional modes==
"Lateral-directional" modes involve rolling motions and yawing motions.  Motions in one of these axes almost always couples into the other so the modes are generally discussed as the "Lateral-Directional modes".&lt;ref&gt;"Lateral" is used although the rolling motions are about the ''longitudinal'' axis&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three types of possible lateral-directional dynamic motion: roll subsidence mode, spiral mode, and Dutch roll mode.

===Roll subsidence mode===
Roll subsidence mode is simply the damping of rolling motion.  There is no direct aerodynamic moment created tending to directly restore wings-level, i.e. there is no returning "spring force/moment" proportional to roll angle.  However, there is a damping moment (proportional to roll ''rate'') created by the slewing-about of long wings.  This prevents large roll rates from building up when roll-control inputs are made or it damps the roll ''rate'' (not the angle) to zero when there are no roll-control inputs.

Roll mode can be improved by [[Dihedral (aeronautics)|dihedral]] effects coming from design characteristics, such as high wings, dihedral angles or sweep angles.

===Dutch roll mode===
{{main|Dutch roll}}
The second lateral motion is an oscillatory combined roll and yaw motion called Dutch roll, perhaps because of its similarity to an ice-skating motion of the same name made by Dutch skaters; the origin of the name is unclear. The Dutch roll may be described as a yaw and roll to the right, followed by a recovery towards the equilibrium condition, then an overshooting of this condition and a yaw and roll to the left, then back past the equilibrium attitude, and so on. The period is usually on the order of 3–15 seconds, but it can vary from a few seconds for light aircraft to a minute or more for airliners. Damping is increased by large directional stability and small dihedral and decreased by small directional stability and large dihedral. Although usually stable in a normal aircraft, the motion may be so slightly damped that the effect is very unpleasant and undesirable. In swept-back wing aircraft, the Dutch roll is solved by installing a [[yaw damper]], in effect a special-purpose automatic pilot that damps out any yawing oscillation by applying rudder corrections. Some swept-wing aircraft have an unstable Dutch roll. If the Dutch roll is very lightly damped or unstable, the yaw damper becomes a safety requirement, rather than a pilot and passenger convenience. Dual yaw dampers are required and a failed yaw damper is cause for limiting flight to low altitudes, and possibly lower [[Mach number|Mach]] numbers, where the Dutch roll stability is improved.

=== Spiral divergence ===

Spiraling is inherent. Most aircraft trimmed for straight-and-level flight, if flown stick-fixed, will eventually develop a tightening spiral-dive.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, Courtland; Hage, Robert (1949). ''Airplane performance stability and control''. John Wiley and Sons. p. 431. {{ISBN|0-471-68046-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a spiral dive is entered unintentionally, the result can be fatal.

A spiral dive is not a spin; it starts, not with a stall or from torque but with a random, increasing roll and airspeed.  Without prompt intervention by the pilot, this can lead to structural failure of the [[airframe]], either as a result of excess [[Load factor (aeronautics)|aerodynamic loading]] or flight into terrain.  The aircraft initially gives little indication that anything has changed. The pilot's "down" sensation continues to be with respect to the bottom of the airplane, although the aircraft actually has increasingly rolled off the true vertical.  Under [[Visual flight rules|VFR]] conditions, the pilot corrects for this deviation from level automatically using the true horizon, while it is very small; but in IMC or dark conditions it can go unnoticed: the roll will increase and the lift, no longer vertical, is insufficient to support the airplane.  The nose drops and speed increases: the spiral dive has begun.

====The forces involved====

Say the roll is to the right.  A sideslip develops, resulting in a slip-flow which is right-to-left.  Now examine the resulting forces one at a time, calling any rightward influence yaw-in, leftward yaw-out, or roll-in or -out, whichever applies.  The slip-flow will:

* push the fin, rudder, and other side areas aft of c.g. to the left, causing a right yaw-in,
* push side areas ahead of the c.g. to the left, causing a left yaw-out,
* push the right wingtip up, the left down, a left roll-out owing to the dihedral angle,
* cause the left wing to go faster, the right wing slower, a roll-in,
* push the side areas of the aircraft above the c.g. to the left, a roll-out,
* push the side areas of the aircraft below the c.g. to the left, a roll-in,

Also, an aerodynamic force is imposed by the relative vertical positions of the fuselage and the wings, creating a roll-in leverage if the fuselage is above the wings, as in a low wing configuration; or roll-out if below, as in a high-wing configuration.

A propeller rotating under power will influence the airflow passing it. Its effect depends on throttle setting (high at high rpm, low at low) and the attitude of the aircraft.

Thus, a spiral dive results from the netting-out of many forces depending partly on the design of the aircraft, partly on its attitude, and partly on its throttle setting (a susceptible design will spiral dive under power but may not in the glide).

====Recovery ====

A diving aircraft has more kinetic energy (which varies as the square of speed) than when straight-and-level.  To get back to straight-and-level, the recovery must get rid of this excess energy safely.  The sequence is:  Power all off; level the wings to the horizon or, if horizon has been lost, to the instruments; reduce speed using gentle back-pressure on the controls until a desired speed is reached; level off and restore power. The pilot should be alert to a pitch up tendency as the aircraft is rolled to wings level.

[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 10736 Manually decontaminating cotton before processing at an Indian spinning mill.jpg|thumb|Manually decontaminating cotton before processing at an Indian spinning mill (2010)]]

'''Cotton''' is a soft, fluffy staple [[fiber]] that grows in a [[wikt:boll|boll]], or protective case, around the seeds of the cotton plants of the genus ''[[Gossypium]]'' in the mallow family ''[[Malvaceae]]''. The fiber is almost pure [[cellulose]]. Under natural conditions, the cotton bolls will increase the dispersal of the seeds.

The plant is a [[shrub]] native to tropical and subtropical regions around the world, including the Americas, Africa, Egypt and India. The greatest diversity of wild cotton species is found in Mexico, followed by Australia and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080625045134/http://www.ogtr.gov.au/pdf/ir/biologycotton08.pdf The Biology of ''Gossypium hirsutum'' L. and ''Gossypium barbadense'' L. (cotton)]. ogtr.gov.au&lt;/ref&gt; Cotton was independently domesticated in the Old and New Worlds.

The fiber is most often spun into [[yarn]] or thread and used to make a soft, [[breathable]] [[textile]]. The use of cotton for fabric is known to date to prehistoric times; fragments of cotton fabric  dated to the fifth millennium BC have been found in the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. 
Although cultivated since antiquity, it was the invention of the [[cotton gin]] that lowered the cost of production that led to its widespread use, and it is the most widely used [[natural fiber]] cloth in clothing today.

Current estimates for world production are about 25 million [[tonne]]s or 110 million bales annually, accounting for 2.5% of the world's arable land. China is the world's largest producer of cotton, but most of this is used domestically. The United States has been the largest exporter for many years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalfibres2009.org/en/fibres/cotton.html "Natural fibres: Cotton"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903094603/http://www.naturalfibres2009.org/en/fibres/cotton.html |date=3 September 2011 }}, International Year of Natural Fibres&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, cotton is usually measured in bales, which measure approximately {{convert|0.48|m3|ft3|abbr=off|sp=us}} and weigh {{convert|226.8|kg|lb|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;National Cotton Council of America, "[http://www.cotton.org/tech/bale/bale-description.cfm U.S. Cotton Bale Dimensions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006041034/http://www.cotton.org/tech/bale/bale-description.cfm |date=6 October 2013 }}" (accessed 5 October 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
There are four commercially grown species of cotton, all domesticated in antiquity:
*''[[Gossypium hirsutum]]''&amp;nbsp;– upland cotton, native to [[Central America]], Mexico, the Caribbean and southern Florida (90% of world production)
*''[[Gossypium barbadense]]''&amp;nbsp;– known as extra-long staple cotton, native to tropical South America (8% of world production)
*''[[Gossypium arboreum]]''&amp;nbsp;– tree cotton, native to India and Pakistan (less than 2%)
*''[[Gossypium herbaceum]]''&amp;nbsp;– Levant cotton, native to southern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula (less than 2%)

The two New World cotton species account for the vast majority of modern cotton production, but the two Old World species were widely used before the 1900s. While cotton fibers occur naturally in colors of white, brown, pink and green, fears of contaminating the genetics of white cotton have led many cotton-growing locations to ban the growing of colored cotton varieties.

==History==
{{main|History of cotton}}

===Early history===
====Indian subcontinent====
[[File:Indus Valley Civilization, Early Phase (3300-2600 BCE).png|thumb|[[Indus Valley Civilization]], Early Phase (3300-2600 BC)]]
The earliest evidence of cotton use in the [[Indian subcontinent]] has been found at the site of [[Mehrgarh]] and [[Rakhigarhi]] where cotton threads have been found preserved in copper beads; these finds have been dated to the [[Neolithic#South and East Asia|Neolithic]] (5th millennium BC).&lt;ref&gt;Jane McIntosh (2008) "The Ancient Indus Valley", Cotton has been cultivated in the subcontinent since the fifth millinium BCE. Based on archaeological evidence, preserved cotton fabric has been found in Harappa, Chanbu-daro in Pakistan Rakhigiri and Lothal in India. p.333&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1006/jasc.2001.0779| title = First Evidence of Cotton at Neolithic Mehrgarh, Pakistan: Analysis of Mineralized Fibres from a Copper Bead| journal = Journal of Archaeological Science| volume = 29| issue = 12| pages = 1393–1401| year = 2002| last1 = Moulherat | first1 = C. | last2 = Tengberg | first2 = M. | last3 = Haquet | first3 = J. R. M.

''A History of India''. Blackwell Publishing. {{ISBN|0-631-20546-2}}, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; The Indus cotton industry was well-developed and some methods used in cotton spinning and fabrication continued to be used until the industrialization of India.&lt;ref&gt;Wisseman &amp; Williams, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2000 and 1000 BC cotton became widespread across much of India.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, D.Q. (2008).

Kyoto: Indus Project, Research Institute for Humanity and Nature. {{ISBN|978-4-902325-16-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it has been found at the site of [[Hallus]] in [[Karnataka]] dating from around 1000 BC.&lt;ref name=ce/&gt;

====Americas====
Cotton bolls discovered in a cave near [[Tehuacán, Puebla|Tehuacán]], [[Mexico]], have at first been
dated to as early as 5500 BC, but this date has been challenged.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Sauer, ''Historical Geography of Crop Plants: A Select Roster'', Routledge (2017), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=moZHDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT115 p. 115]&lt;/ref&gt; More securely dated is the domestication of [[Gossypium hirsutum]] in Mexico between around 3400 and 2300 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huckell|first=Lisa W.|title=Plant Remains from the Pinaleño Cotton Cache, Arizona|journal=Kiva, the Journal of Southwest Anthropology and History|volume=59|issue=2|year=1993|jstor=30246122|pages=147–203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Peru]], cultivation of the indigenous cotton species ''[[Gossypium barbadense]]'' has been dated, from a find in Ancon, to c 4200 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rajpal|first1=Vijay Rani|title=Gene Pool Diversity and Crop Improvement, Volume 1|date=2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-27096-8|page=117|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FauFCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;ots=VDvti80rlB&amp;dq=oldest%20cotton%20in%20the%20world%20Tehuac%C3%A1n%20Valley%2C%20Mexico&amp;pg=PA117#v=onepage&amp;q=oldest%20cotton%20in%20the%20world%20Tehuac%C3%A1n%20Valley,%20Mexico&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the backbone of the development of coastal cultures such as the [[Norte Chico civilization|Norte Chico]], [[Moche (culture)|Moche]], and [[Nazca culture|Nazca]]. Cotton was grown upriver, made into nets, and traded with fishing villages along the coast for large supplies of fish. The Spanish who came to Mexico and Peru in the early 16th century found the people growing cotton and wearing clothing made of it.

====Arabia====
The Greeks and the Arabs were not familiar with cotton until the [[Wars of Alexander the Great]], as his contemporary [[Megasthenes]] told [[Seleucus I Nicator]] of "there being trees on which wool grows" in "Indica".{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} This may be a reference to "tree cotton", [[Gossypium arboreum]], which is a native of the Indian subcontinent.

According to the ''[[Columbia Encyclopedia]]'':&lt;ref name=ce&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140923071411/https://education.yahoo.com/reference/encyclopedia/entry/cotton "cotton"] in ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', Sixth Edition. 2001–07.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Cotton has been spun, woven, and dyed since prehistoric times. It clothed the people of ancient India, Egypt, and China. Hundreds of years before the Christian era, cotton textiles were woven in India with matchless skill, and their use spread to the Mediterranean countries.}}

====Iran====
In Iran ([[Persia]]), the history of cotton dates back to the [[Achaemenid]] era (5th century BC); however, there are few sources about the planting of cotton in pre-Islamic Iran. The planting of cotton was common in [[Merv]], [[Ray, Iran|Ray]] and [[Fārs Province|Pars]] of Iran. In [[Persian poetry|Persian poets]]' poems, especially [[Ferdowsi]]'s [[Shahname]], there are references to cotton ("panbe" in [[Persian language|Persian]]). [[Marco Polo]] (13th century) refers to the major products of Persia, including cotton. [[John Chardin]], a French traveler of the 17th century who visited [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid Persia]], spoke approvingly of the vast cotton farms of Persia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopaediaislamica.com/madkhal2.php?sid=2820 Encyclopaedia Islamica Foundation. بنیاد دائره المعارف اسلامی ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630080822/http://www.encyclopaediaislamica.com/madkhal2.php?sid=2820 |date=30 June 2009 }}, Retrieved on 28 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

====China====
During the [[Han dynasty]] (207 BC - 220 AD), cotton was grown by Chinese peoples in the southern Chinese province of [[Yunnan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H5VDA90eDUoC&amp;pg=PA410|title=Textiles of Southeast Asia: tradition, trade and transformation|author=Maxwell, Robyn J. |year=2003|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|edition=revised|isbn=0-7946-0104-9|page=410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Europe====
[[File:Mandeville cotton.jpg|thumb|Cotton plants as imagined and drawn by [[John Mandeville]] in the 14th century]]
During the late medieval period, cotton became known as an imported fiber in northern Europe, without any knowledge of how it was derived, other than that it was a plant. Because [[Herodotus]] had written in his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'', Book III, 106, that in India trees grew in the wild producing wool, it was assumed that the plant was a tree, rather than a shrub. This aspect is retained in the name for cotton in several Germanic languages, such as German ''[[wikt:Baumwolle|Baumwolle]]'', which translates as "tree wool" (''Baum'' means "tree"; ''Wolle'' means "wool"). Noting its similarities to wool, people in the region could only imagine that cotton must be produced by plant-borne sheep. [[John Mandeville]], writing in 1350, stated as fact that "There grew there [India] a wonderful tree which bore tiny lambs on the endes of its branches. These branches were so pliable that they bent down to allow the lambs to feed when they are hungry." (See [[Vegetable Lamb of Tartary]].)[[File:Vegetable lamb (Lee, 1887).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Vegetable Lamb of Tartary]]]]
Cotton manufacture was introduced to Europe during the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula]] [[Muslim conquest of Sicily|and Sicily]]. The knowledge of cotton weaving was spread to northern Italy in the 12th century, when [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Sicily was conquered by the Normans]], and consequently to the rest of Europe. The [[spinning wheel]], introduced to Europe circa 1350, improved the speed of cotton spinning.&lt;ref name=Middle&gt;{{cite web|title = Technology in the Middle Ages|author = Backer, Patricia|accessdate = 12 June 2011|work = History of Technology|url = http://www.engr.sjsu.edu/pabacker/history/middle.htm|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130508045210/http://www.engr.sjsu.edu/pabacker/history/middle.htm|archivedate = 8 May 2013|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 15th century, [[Venice]], [[Antwerp]], and [[Haarlem]] were important ports for cotton trade, and the sale and transportation of cotton fabrics had become very profitable.&lt;ref name=Facts&gt;{{cite web|title = cotton|author = Volti, Rudi|work = The Facts On File Encyclopedia of Science, Technology, and Society|year = 1999|url = http://www.fofweb.com/activelink2.asp?ItemID=WE49\&amp;iPin=ffests0220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Renaldis muslin woman.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|A woman in [[Dhaka]] clad in fine [[Muslin trade in Bengal|Bengali muslin]], 18th century.]]
Under the [[Mughal Empire]], which ruled in the [[Indian subcontinent]] from the early 16th century to the early 18th century, Indian cotton production increased, in terms of both raw cotton and cotton textiles. The Mughals introduced [[agrarian reform]]s such as a new revenue system that was biased in favour of higher value [[cash crops]] such as cotton and [[indigo]], providing state incentives to grow cash crops, in addition to rising market demand.&lt;ref name="richards"&gt;[[John F. Richards]] (1995), [https://books.google.com/books?id=HHyVh29gy4QC&amp;pg=PA190 ''The Mughal Empire'', page 190] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171220230104/https://books.google.com/books?id=HHyVh29gy4QC&amp;pg=PA190 |date=20 December 2017 }}, [[Cambridge University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest [[manufacturing]] industry in the Mughal Empire was cotton [[textile manufacturing]], which included the production of [[wiktionary:piece goods|piece goods]], [[calico]]s, and [[muslin]]s, available unbleached and in a variety of colours. The cotton [[textile industry]] was responsible for a large part of the empire's international trade.&lt;ref name="schmidt"&gt;Karl J. Schmidt (2015), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BqdzCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA100 ''An Atlas and Survey of South Asian History'', page 100] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171220230104/https://books.google.com/books?id=BqdzCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA100 |date=20 December 2017 }}, [[Routledge]]&lt;/ref&gt; India had a 25% share of the global textile trade in the early 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Angus Maddison]] (1995), ''Monitoring the World Economy, 1820-1992'', [[OECD]], p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Indian cotton [[textile]]s were the most important [[manufactured goods]] in world trade in the 18th century, consumed across the world from the [[Americas]] to [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="Parthasarathi"&gt;{{Citation |title=Why Europe Grew Rich and Asia Did Not: Global Economic Divergence, 1600–1850 |given=Prasannan |surname=Parthasarathi |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-139-49889-0 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important center of cotton production was the [[Bengal Subah]] province, particularly around its capital city of [[Dhaka]].&lt;ref name="Eaton"&gt;Richard Maxwell Eaton (1996), [https://books.google.com/books?id=gKhChF3yAOUC&amp;pg=PA202 ''The Rise of Islam and the Bengal Frontier, 1204-1760'', page 202] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627124201/http://books.google.com/books?id=gKhChF3yAOUC&amp;pg=PA202 |date=27 June 2014 }}, [[University of California Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[worm gear]] roller [[cotton gin]], which was invented in India during the early [[Delhi Sultanate]] era of the 13th&amp;ndash;14th centuries, came into use in the Mughal Empire some time around the 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;[[Irfan Habib]] (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=K8kO4J3mXUAC&amp;pg=PA53 ''Economic History of Medieval India, 1200-1500'', page 53], [[Pearson Education]]&lt;/ref&gt; and is still used in India through to the present day.&lt;ref name="LakGin"/&gt; Another innovation, the incorporation of the [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]] handle in the cotton gin, first appeared in India some time during the late Delhi Sultanate or the early Mughal Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[[Irfan Habib]] (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=K8kO4J3mXUAC&amp;pg=PA53 ''Economic History of Medieval India, 1200-1500'', pages 53-54], [[Pearson Education]]&lt;/ref&gt; The production of cotton, which may have largely been spun in the villages and then taken to towns in the form of yarn to be woven into cloth textiles, was advanced by the diffusion of the [[spinning wheel]] across India shortly before the Mughal era, lowering the costs of yarn and helping to increase demand for cotton. The diffusion of the spinning wheel, and the incorporation of the worm gear and crank handle into the roller cotton gin, led to greatly expanded Indian cotton textile production during the Mughal era.&lt;ref&gt;[[Irfan Habib]] (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=K8kO4J3mXUAC&amp;pg=PA54 ''Economic History of Medieval India, 1200-1500'', page 54], [[Pearson Education]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported that, with an Indian cotton gin, which is half machine and half tool, one man and one woman could clean 28 pounds of cotton per day. With a modified Forbes version, one man and a boy could produce 250 pounds per day. If oxen were used to power 16 of these machines, and a few people's labour was used to feed them, they could produce as much work as 750 people did formerly.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Marx]] (1867). Chapter 16: "Machinery and Large-Scale Industry." ''[[Das Kapital]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Egypt====
{{Main|History of Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty}}

In the early 19th century, a Frenchman named M. Jumel proposed to the great ruler of [[Egypt]], [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mohamed Ali Pasha]], that he could earn a substantial income by growing an extra-long staple Maho (''[[Gossypium barbadense]]'') cotton, in [[Lower Egypt]], for the French market. Mohamed Ali Pasha accepted the proposition and granted himself the monopoly on the sale and export of cotton in Egypt; and later dictated cotton should be grown in preference to other crops.

[[Egypt under Muhammad Ali]] in the early 19th century had the fifth most productive cotton industry in the world, in terms of the number of [[Spindle (textiles)|spindles]] per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Between Development and Underdevelopment: The Precocious Attempts at Industrialization of the Periphery, 1800-1870|author=Jean Batou|publisher=[[:fr:Librairie Droz|Librairie Droz]]|year=1991|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HjD4SCOE6IgC|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; The industry was initially driven by machinery that relied on traditional energy sources, such as [[animal power]], [[water wheel]]s, and [[windmill]]s, which were also the principal energy sources in Western Europe up until around 1870.&lt;ref name="batou193"&gt;{{cite book|title=Between Development and Underdevelopment: The Precocious Attempts at Industrialization of the Periphery, 1800-1870|author=Jean Batou|publisher=[[:fr:Librairie Droz|Librairie Droz]]|year=1991|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HjD4SCOE6IgC&amp;pg=PA193|pages=193–196}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was under Muhammad Ali in the early 19th century that [[steam engine]]s were introduced to the Egyptian cotton industry.&lt;ref name="batou193"/&gt;

By the time of the American Civil war annual exports had reached $16 million (120,000 bales), which rose to $56 million by 1864, primarily due to the loss of the Confederate supply on the world market. Exports continued to grow even after the reintroduction of US cotton, produced now by a paid workforce, and Egyptian exports reached 1.2 million bales a year by 1903.

===Britain===
====East India Company====
{{Main|Calico Acts|Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution}}

The [[English East India Company]] introduced the Britain to cheap [[Calico (textile)|calico]] and [[chintz]] cloth on the restoration of the monarchy in the 1660s. Initially imported as a novelty side line, from its spice trading posts in Asia, the cheap colourful cloth proved popular and overtook the EIC's spice trade by value in the late 17th century. The EIC embraced the demand, particularly for [[Calico (textile)|calico]], by expanding its factories in Asia and producing and importing cloth in bulk, creating competition for domestic woollen and linen textile producers. The impacted weavers, spinners, dyers, shepherds and farmers objected and the calico question became one of the major issues of National politics between the 1680s and the 1730s. Parliament began to see a decline in domestic textile sales, and an increase in imported textiles from places like [[China]] and [[India]]. Seeing the East India Company and their textile importation as a threat to domestic textile businesses, Parliament passed the 1700 Calico Act, blocking the importation of cotton cloth. As there was no punishment for continuing to sell cotton cloth, smuggling of the popular material became commonplace. In 1721, dissatisfied with the results of the first act, Parliament passed a stricter addition, this time prohibiting the sale of most cottons, imported and domestic (exempting only thread [[Fustian]] and raw cotton). The exemption of raw cotton from the prohibition initially saw 2 thousand bales of cotton imported annually, to become the basis of a new indigenous industry, initially producing [[Fustian]] for the domestic market, though more importantly triggering the development of a series of mechanised spinning and weaving technologies, to process the material. This mechanised production was concentrated in new [[cotton mill]]s, which slowly expanded till by the beginning of the 1770s seven thousand bales of cotton were imported annually, and pressure was put on Parliament, by the new mill owners, to remove the prohibition on the production and sale of pure cotton cloth, as they could easily compete with anything the EIC could import.

The acts were repealed in 1774, triggering a wave of investment in mill based cotton spinning and production, doubling the demand for raw cotton within a couple of years, and doubling it again every decade, into the 1840s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gupta|first1=Bishnupriya|title=COTTON TEXTILES AND THE GREAT DIVERGENCE: LANCASHIRE, INDIA AND SHIFTING COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE, 1600-1850|url=http://www.iisg.nl/hpw/papers/broadberry-gupta.pdf|website=International Institute of Social History|publisher=Department of Economics, University of Warwick|accessdate=5 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910075425/http://www.iisg.nl/hpw/papers/broadberry-gupta.pdf|archivedate=10 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian cotton textiles, particularly those from [[Bengal Subah|Bengal]], continued to maintain a competitive advantage up until the 19th century. In order to compete with India, Britain invested in labour-saving technical progress, while implementing [[protectionist]] policies such as bans and [[tariff]]s to restrict Indian imports.&lt;ref name="gupta"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Broadberry|first1=Stephen|last2=Gupta|first2=Bishnupriya|title=Cotton textiles and the great divergence: Lancashire, India and shifting competitive advantage, 1600-1850|url=http://www.iisg.nl/hpw/papers/broadberry-gupta.pdf|website=International Institute of Social History|publisher=Department of Economics, University of Warwick|accessdate=5 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910075425/http://www.iisg.nl/hpw/papers/broadberry-gupta.pdf|archivedate=10 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the East India Company's [[Company rule in India|rule in India]] contributed to its [[deindustrialization]], opening up a new market for British goods,&lt;ref name="gupta"/&gt; while the capital amassed from Bengal after its [[Battle of Plassey|1757 conquest]] was used to invest in British industries such as textile manufacturing and greatly increase British wealth.&lt;ref name="tong"&gt;Junie T.

====Industrial Revolution====
{{Main|Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution}}

The advent of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in Britain provided a great boost to cotton manufacture, as textiles emerged as Britain's leading export. In 1738, [[Lewis Paul]] and [[John Wyatt (inventor)|John Wyatt]], of [[Birmingham]], England, patented the roller spinning machine, as well as the flyer-and-bobbin system for drawing cotton to a more even thickness using two sets of rollers that traveled at different speeds. Later, the invention of the [[James Hargreaves]]' [[spinning jenny]] in 1764, [[Richard Arkwright]]'s [[spinning frame]] in 1769 and [[Samuel Crompton]]'s [[spinning mule]] in 1775 enabled British spinners to produce cotton yarn at much higher rates. From the late 18th century on, the British city of [[Manchester]] acquired the nickname ''"[[Cottonopolis]]"'' due to the cotton industry's omnipresence within the city, and Manchester's role as the heart of the global cotton trade.

Production capacity in Britain and the United States was improved by the invention of the modern [[cotton gin]] by the American [[Eli Whitney]] in 1793. Before the development of cotton gins, the cotton fibers had to be pulled from the seeds tediously by hand. By the late 1700s, a number of crude ginning machines had been developed. However, to produce a bale of cotton required over 600 hours of human labor,&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hughs | first1 = S. E. | last2 = Valco | first2 = T. D. | first3 = J. R. | last3 = Williford | year = 2008 | title = 100 Years of Cotton Production, Harvesting, and Ginning Systems | journal = Transactions of the ASABE | volume = 51 | issue = 4 | pages = 1187–98 | publisher =  | jstor =  | doi = 10.13031/2013.25234 | url = http://naldc.nal.usda.gov/catalog/23069 | format =  | accessdate =  | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150425105401/http://naldc.nal.usda.gov/catalog/23069 | archivedate = 25 April 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; making large-scale production uneconomical in the United States, even with the use of humans as slave labor. The gin that Whitney manufactured (the Holmes design) reduced the hours down to just a dozen or so per bale. Although Whitney patented his own design for a cotton gin, he manufactured a prior design from [[Henry Odgen Holmes]], for which Holmes filed a patent in 1796.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; Improving technology and increasing control of world markets allowed British traders to develop a commercial chain in which raw cotton fibers were (at first) purchased from [[British Empire|colonial]] [[plantations]], processed into cotton cloth in the mills of [[Lancashire]], and then exported on British ships to captive colonial markets in [[British West Africa|West Africa]], [[British Raj|India]], and China (via Shanghai and Hong Kong).

By the 1840s, India was no longer capable of supplying the vast quantities of cotton fibers needed by mechanized British factories, while shipping bulky, low-price cotton from India to Britain was time-consuming and expensive. This, coupled with the emergence of American cotton as a superior type (due to the longer, stronger fibers of the two domesticated Native American species, ''[[Gossypium hirsutum]]'' and ''[[Gossypium barbadense]]''), encouraged British traders to purchase cotton from [[Plantations in the American South|plantations in the United States]] and [[plantations]] in the [[Caribbean]]. By the mid-19th century, "[[King Cotton]]" had become the backbone of the [[antebellum South|southern American]] economy. In the United States, cultivating and harvesting cotton became the leading occupation of [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]].

During the [[American Civil War]], American cotton exports slumped due to a [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] [[blockade]] on [[Confederate States of America|Southern]] [[port]]s, and also because of a strategic decision by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] government to cut exports, hoping to force Britain to recognize the Confederacy or enter the war. This prompted the main purchasers of cotton, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and [[France]], to turn to [[Egypt]]ian cotton. British and French traders invested heavily in cotton plantations. The Egyptian government of [[Isma'il Pasha|Viceroy Isma'il]] took out substantial loans from European bankers and stock exchanges. After the American Civil War ended in 1865, British and French traders abandoned [[Egyptian cotton]] and returned to cheap American exports,{{citation needed|reason=I've seen this the other way round with the South suffering because British interests in Egypt persisted and they liked the product better|date=September 2012}} sending Egypt into a deficit spiral that led to the country declaring [[bankruptcy]] in 1876, a key factor behind Egypt's [[History of Egypt under the British|occupation by the British Empire in 1882]].

During this time, cotton cultivation in the [[British Empire]], especially Australia and India, greatly increased to replace the lost production of the American South. Through tariffs and other restrictions, the British government discouraged the production of cotton cloth in India; rather, the raw fiber was sent to England for processing. The Indian [[Gandhi, Mohandas K.|Mahatma Gandhi]] described the process:

#English people buy Indian cotton in the field, picked by Indian labor at seven cents a day, through an optional monopoly.
#This cotton is shipped on British ships, a three-week journey across the Indian Ocean, down the Red Sea, across the Mediterranean, through Gibraltar, across the Bay of Biscay and the Atlantic Ocean to London. One hundred per cent profit on this freight is regarded as small.
#The cotton is turned into cloth in Lancashire. You pay shilling wages instead of Indian pennies to your workers. The English worker not only has the advantage of better wages, but the steel companies of England get the profit of building the factories and machines. Wages; profits; all these are spent in England.
#The finished product is sent back to India at European shipping rates, once again on British ships. The captains, officers, sailors of these ships, whose wages must be paid, are English. The only Indians who profit are a few lascars who do the dirty work on the boats for a few cents a day.
#The cloth is finally sold back to the kings and landlords of India who got the money to buy this expensive cloth out of the poor peasants of India who worked at seven cents a day.&lt;ref&gt;(Fisher 1932 pp 154–156)&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

[[File:Parchman prison convict labor 1911.jpeg|thumb|[[Incarceration|Prisoner]]s farming cotton under the [[Trusty system (prison)|trusty system]] in [[Parchman Farm]], [[Mississippi]], 1911]]
In the United States, Southern cotton provided capital for the continuing development of the North. The cotton was largely produced through the labor of enslaved African Americans. It enriched both the Southern landowners and the Northern merchants. Much of the Southern cotton was trans-shipped through northern [[ports]]. In this era the slogan "Cotton is king" characterized the attitude of the South toward this [[monocrop]].

Cotton remained a key crop in the Southern economy after [[Emancipation Proclamation|emancipation]] and the end of the Civil War in 1865. Across the South, [[sharecropping]] evolved, in which landless black and white farmers worked land owned by others in return for a share of the profits. Some farmers rented the land and bore the production costs themselves. Until mechanical [[cotton picker]]s were developed, cotton farmers needed additional labor to hand-pick cotton. Picking cotton was a source of income for families across the South. Rural and small town school systems had split vacations so children could work in the fields during "cotton-picking."

It was not until the 1950s that reliable harvesting machinery was introduced (prior to this, cotton-harvesting machinery had been too clumsy to pick cotton without shredding the fibers). {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} During the first half of the 20th century, employment in the cotton industry fell, as machines began to replace laborers and the South's rural labor force dwindled during the [[World War]]s.

Cotton remains a major export of the [[southern United States]], and a majority of the world's annual cotton crop is of the long-staple American variety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Yafa, Stephen |title=Cotton: The Biography of a Revolutionary Fiber |publisher=Penguin (Non-Classics) |year=2004 |page=16 |isbn=0-14-303722-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Successful cultivation of cotton requires a long [[frost]]-free period, plenty of sunshine, and a moderate rainfall, usually from {{convert|60|to|120|cm|in|abbr=on}}{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}. [[Soil]]s usually need to be fairly heavy, although the level of [[nutrient]]s does not need to be exceptional. In general, these conditions are met within the seasonally dry tropics and subtropics in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, but a large proportion of the cotton grown today is cultivated in areas with less rainfall that obtain the water from irrigation. Production of the crop for a given year usually starts soon after harvesting the preceding autumn. Cotton is naturally a perennial but is grown as an annual to help control pests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cottonspinning.com/grow/plantingcottonseeds.html "Planting Cotton Seeds"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227062910/http://www.cottonspinning.com/grow/plantingcottonseeds.html |date=27 February 2015 }}. ''cottonspinning.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; Planting time in spring in the Northern hemisphere varies from the beginning of February to the beginning of June. The area of the United States known as the [[South Plains]] is the largest contiguous cotton-growing region in the world. While dryland (non-irrigated) cotton is successfully grown in this region, consistent yields are only produced with heavy reliance on [[irrigation]] water drawn from the [[Ogallala Aquifer]].
Since cotton is somewhat salt and drought tolerant, this makes it an attractive crop for arid and semiarid regions. As [[water resources]] get tighter around the world, economies that rely on it face difficulties and conflict, as well as potential environmental problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wegerich | first1 = K. | year = 2002 | title = Natural drought or human-made water scarcity in Uzbekistan? | url = http://www.preventionweb.net/english/professional/publications/v.php?id=1776 | journal = Central Asia and the Caucasus | volume = 2 | issue =  | pages = 154–162 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121027155313/http://www.preventionweb.net/english/professional/publications/v.php?id=1776 | archivedate = 27 October 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Keepers of the Spring|year=2004|isbn=1-55963-681-5|author=Pearce, Fred|publisher=Island Press|pages=109–122|chapter=9 "A Salty Hell"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.11.027| title = The water footprint of cotton consumption: An assessment of the impact of worldwide consumption of cotton products on the water resources in the cotton producing countries| journal = Ecological Economics| volume = 60| pages = 186–203| year = 2006| last1 = Chapagain | first1 = A.

===Genetic modification===
{{Main|Bt cotton}}
[[Genetically modified]] (GM) cotton was developed to reduce the heavy reliance on pesticides. The bacterium ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' (Bt) naturally produces a chemical harmful only to a small fraction of insects, most notably the larvae of [[Lepidoptera|moths and butterflies]], [[Coleoptera|beetles]], and [[Diptera|flies]], and harmless to other forms of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Are Bt crops safe?|url = http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nbt0903-1003|journal = Nature Biotechnology|date = 2003-01-01|volume = 21|issue = 9|doi = 10.1038/nbt0903-1003|first = Mike|last = Mendelsohn|first2 = John|last2 = Kough|first3 = Zigfridais|last3 = Vaituzis|first4 = Keith|last4 = Matthews|pmid=12949561|pages=1003–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Monarch larvae sensitivity to Bacillus thuringiensis- purified proteins and pollen|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/98/21/11925|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date = 2001-10-09|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 59744|pmid = 11559841|pages = 11925–11930|volume = 98|issue = 21|doi = 10.1073/pnas.211297698|first = Richard L.|last = Hellmich|first2 = Blair D.|last2 = Siegfried|first3 = Mark K.|last3 = Sears|first4 = Diane E.|last4 = Stanley-Horn|first5 = Michael J.|last5 = Daniels|first6 = Heather R.|last6 = Mattila|first7 = Terrence|last7 = Spencer|first8 = Keith G.|last8 = Bidne|first9 = Leslie C.|last9 = Lewis|bibcode = 2001PNAS...9811925H|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170820000014/http://www.pnas.org/content/98/21/11925|archivedate = 20 August 2017|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://entomology.umd.edu/uploads/4/4/1/3/44130801/bee_nto_paper.pdf|title = Effects of Bt corn pollen on honey bees: emphasis on protocol development|last = Rose|first = Robyn|date = July 2007|journal = Apidologie|doi = 10.1051/apido:2007022|last2 = Dively|first2 = Galen|publisher = Springer Netherlands|issue = 4|volume = 38|last3 = Pettis|first3 = Jeff|pages = 368–377|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150906131627/http://entomology.umd.edu/uploads/4/4/1/3/44130801/bee_nto_paper.pdf|archivedate = 6 September 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gene coding for Bt toxin has been inserted into cotton, causing cotton, called [[Bt cotton]], to produce this natural insecticide in its tissues. In many regions, the main pests in commercial cotton are [[lepidoptera]]n larvae, which are killed by the Bt protein in the transgenic cotton they eat. This eliminates the need to use large amounts of broad-spectrum insecticides to kill lepidopteran pests (some of which have developed [[pyrethroid]] resistance). This spares natural insect predators in the farm ecology and further contributes to noninsecticide pest management.

But Bt cotton is ineffective against many cotton pests, however, such as [[plant bug]]s, [[Halyomorpha halys|stink bug]]s, and [[aphid]]s; depending on circumstances it may still be desirable to use insecticides against these. A 2006 study done by Cornell researchers, the Center for Chinese Agricultural Policy and the Chinese Academy of Science on Bt cotton farming in China found that after seven years these secondary pests that were normally controlled by pesticide had increased, necessitating the use of pesticides at similar levels to non-Bt cotton and causing less profit for farmers because of the extra expense of GM seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Cornell University|date=25 July 2006|title=Seven-year glitch: Cornell warns that Chinese GM cotton farmers are losing money due to 'secondary' pests|author=Lang, Susan|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/July06/Bt.cotton.China.ssl.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012044920/http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/July06/Bt.cotton.China.ssl.html|archivedate=12 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2009 study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Stanford University and Rutgers University refuted this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = Z. | last2 = Lin | first2 = H. | last3 = Huang | first3 = J. | last4 = Hu | first4 = R. | last5 = Rozelle | first5 = S. | last6 = Pray | first6 = C. | doi = 10.1016/S1671-2927(09)60012-2 | title = Bt Cotton in China: Are Secondary Insect Infestations Offsetting the Benefits in Farmer Fields? | journal = Agricultural Sciences in China | volume = 8 | pages = 83–90 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; They concluded that the GM cotton effectively controlled bollworm. The secondary pests were mostly miridae (plant bugs) whose increase was related to local temperature and rainfall and only continued to increase in half the villages studied. Moreover, the increase in insecticide use for the control of these secondary insects was far smaller than the reduction in total insecticide use due to Bt cotton adoption.

==Pests and weeds==
{{Main|List of cotton diseases}}

The cotton industry relies heavily on chemicals, such as [[herbicide]]s, [[fertilizers]] and [[insecticides]], although a very small number of farmers are moving toward an [[Organic farming|organic]] model of production, and organic cotton products are now available for purchase at limited locations. These are popular for baby clothes and [[diapers]]. Under most definitions, organic products do not use [[genetic engineering]]. All natural cotton products are known to be both sustainable and hypoallergenic.

Historically, in North America, one of the most economically destructive pests in cotton production has been the [[boll weevil]]. Due to the [[US Department of Agriculture]]'s highly successful [[Boll Weevil Eradication Program]] (BWEP), this pest has been eliminated from cotton in most of the United States. This program, along with the introduction of genetically engineered [[Bacillus thuringiensis|Bt]] cotton (which contains a [[bacteria]]l gene that codes for a plant-produced [[protein]] that is toxic to a number of pests such as [[cotton bollworm (American)|cotton bollworm]] and [[pink bollworm]]), has allowed a reduction in the use of synthetic insecticides.

Other significant global pests of cotton include the pink bollworm, ''[[Pectinophora gossypiella]]''; the chili thrips, ''[[Scirtothrips dorsalis]]''; the cotton seed bug, ''[[Oxycarenus hyalinipennis]]''; the tarnish plant bug, ''[[Lygus lineolaris]]''; and the fall armyworm, ''[[Spodoptera frugiperda]]'', ''[[Xanthomonas citri subsp. malvacearum]]''.

==Harvesting==

[[File:Cotton picking in India.jpg|thumb|Cotton being picked by hand in [[India]], 2005.]]

Most cotton in the United States, Europe and Australia is harvested mechanically, either by a [[cotton picker]], a machine that removes the cotton from the boll without damaging the cotton plant, or by a cotton stripper, which strips the entire boll off the plant. Cotton strippers are used in regions where it is too windy to grow picker varieties of cotton, and usually after application of a chemical [[defoliant]] or the natural defoliation that occurs after a freeze. Cotton is a perennial crop in the tropics, and without defoliation or freezing, the plant will continue to grow.

Cotton continues to be picked by hand in [[developing country|developing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Craig Murray|Murray, Craig]] (2006). ''Murder in Samarkand&amp;nbsp;– A British Ambassador's Controversial Defiance of Tyranny in the War on Terror''. {{ISBN|978-1-84596-194-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition from synthetic fibers==
The era of manufactured fibers began with the development of [[rayon]] in France in the 1890s. Rayon is derived from a natural cellulose and cannot be considered synthetic, but requires extensive processing in a manufacturing process, and led the less expensive replacement of more naturally derived materials. A succession of new synthetic fibers were introduced by the chemicals industry in the following decades. [[Cellulose acetate|Acetate]] in fiber form was developed in 1924. [[Nylon]], the first fiber synthesized entirely from petrochemicals, was introduced as a sewing thread by DuPont in 1936, followed by DuPont's [[acrylic fiber|acrylic]] in 1944. Some garments were created from fabrics based on these fibers, such as women's [[hosiery]] from nylon, but it was not until the introduction of [[polyester]] into the fiber marketplace in the early 1950s that the market for cotton came under threat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teonline.com/fiber-history.html Fiber History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917085422/http://www.teonline.com/fiber-history.html |date=17 September 2008 }}. Teonline.com. Retrieved on 27 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid uptake of polyester garments in the 1960s caused economic hardship in cotton-exporting economies, especially in Central American countries, such as [[Nicaragua]], where cotton production had boomed tenfold between 1950 and 1965 with the advent of cheap chemical pesticides. Cotton production recovered in the 1970s, but crashed to pre-1960 levels in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett, Charles D.

==Uses==
{{Redirect|Cotton wool|the 2017 British film|Cotton Wool}}
Cotton is used to make a number of textile products. These include [[terrycloth]] for highly absorbent bath [[towel]]s and [[robe]]s; [[denim]] for [[Jeans|blue jeans]]; [[cambric]], popularly used in the manufacture of blue work shirts (from which we get the term "[[blue-collar]]"); and [[corduroy]], [[seersucker]], and cotton [[twill]]. [[Sock]]s, [[underwear]], and most [[T-shirt]]s are made from cotton. Bed sheets often are made from cotton. Cotton also is used to make yarn used in [[crochet]] and [[knitting]]. Fabric also can be made from recycled or recovered cotton that otherwise would be thrown away during the spinning, weaving, or cutting process. While many fabrics are made completely of cotton, some materials blend cotton with other fibers, including [[rayon]] and [[synthetic fiber]]s such as [[polyester]]. It can either be used in knitted or woven fabrics, as it can be blended with elastine to make a stretchier thread for knitted fabrics, and apparel such as stretch jeans. Cotton can be blended also with [[linen]] as Linen-cotton blends which give benefit of both plant materials which wrinkle resistant, lightweight,  breathable and can keep heat more effectively than only linen. These blends are thinner and lighter, but stronger than only cotton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reference.com/home-garden/difference-between-cotton-linen-40242bc2265acaef |title=What is the difference between cotton and linen? |accessdate=September 20, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017073804/https://www.reference.com/home-garden/difference-between-cotton-linen-40242bc2265acaef |archivedate=17 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the [[textile industry]], cotton is used in [[fishing net]]s, [[coffee filter]]s, [[tent]]s, explosives manufacture (see [[nitrocellulose]]), [[cotton paper]], and in [[bookbinding]]. The first Chinese [[papermaking|paper]] was made of cotton fiber.{{citation needed|reason=While cotton may have been a fraction of the material used in the first Chinese paper, it is most often stated to have been made predominantly from mulberry bast fibers|date=September 2015}} [[Fire hose]]s were once made of cotton.

The cottonseed which remains after the cotton is ginned is used to produce [[cottonseed oil]], which, after refining, can be consumed by humans like any other [[vegetable oil]]. The [[cottonseed meal]] that is left generally is fed to [[ruminant]] livestock; the [[gossypol]] remaining in the meal is toxic to [[monogastric]] animals. Cottonseed hulls can be added to dairy cattle rations for roughage. During the American slavery period, cotton root bark was used in [[folk remedies]] as an [[abortifacient]], that is, to induce a miscarriage. Gossypol was one of the many substances found in all parts of the cotton plant and it was described by the scientists as 'poisonous pigment'. It also appears to inhibit the development of sperm or even restrict the mobility of the sperm. Also, it is thought to interfere with the menstrual cycle by restricting the release of certain hormones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Resisting Reproduction: Reconsidering Slave Contraception in the Old South |author=Perrin, Liese M. |journal=Journal of American Studies |volume=35 |year=2001 |pages=255–274|doi=10.1017/S0021875801006612 |jstor=27556967 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cotton linters are fine, silky fibers which adhere to the seeds of the cotton plant after ginning. These curly fibers typically are less than {{convert|1/8|in|mm}} long. The term also may apply to the longer textile fiber staple lint as well as the shorter fuzzy fibers from some upland species. Linters are traditionally used in the manufacture of paper and as a raw material in the manufacture of [[cellulose]]. In the UK, linters are referred to as "cotton wool". This can also be a refined product (''absorbent cotton'' in U.S. usage) which has [[medical]], [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]] and many other practical uses. The first medical use of cotton wool was by [[Sampson Gamgee]] at the Queen's Hospital (later the General Hospital) in [[Birmingham]], England.

Shiny cotton is a processed version of the fiber that can be made into cloth resembling [[satin]] for shirts and suits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p6uAHnd1tXUC&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=Shiny+cotton+is+a+processed+version+of+the+fiber+that+can+be+made+into+cloth+resembling+satin+for+shirts+and+suits&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCt4yd15nYAhUS9mMKHfmTDqAQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Shiny%20cotton%20is%20a%20processed%20version%20of%20the%20fiber%20that%20can%20be%20made%20into%20cloth%20resembling%20satin%20for%20shirts%20and%20suits&amp;f=false|title=Winning With Futures: The Smart Way to Recognize Opportunities, Calculate Risk, and Maximize Profits|last=Thomsett|first=Michael C.|date=2008-11-05|publisher=AMACOM Div American Mgmt Assn|isbn=9780814409879|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171220230104/https://books.google.com/books?id=p6uAHnd1tXUC&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=Shiny+cotton+is+a+processed+version+of+the+fiber+that+can+be+made+into+cloth+resembling+satin+for+shirts+and+suits&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCt4yd15nYAhUS9mMKHfmTDqAQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Shiny%20cotton%20is%20a%20processed%20version%20of%20the%20fiber%20that%20can%20be%20made%20into%20cloth%20resembling%20satin%20for%20shirts%20and%20suits&amp;f=false|archivedate=20 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is hydrophobic (does not absorb water easily), which makes it unfit for use in bath and dish towels (although examples of these made from shiny cotton are seen).

Long staple (LS cotton) is cotton of a longer fibre length and therefore of higher quality, while [[Gossypium barbadense|Extra-long staple cotton]] (ELS cotton) has longer fibre length still and of even higher quality.

'''Cotton lisle''' is a finely-spun, tightly twisted type of cotton that is noted for being strong and durable. Lisle is composed of two strands that have each been twisted an extra twist per inch than ordinary yarns and combined to create a single thread. The yarn is spun so that it is compact and solid. This cotton is used mainly for underwear, stockings, and gloves. Colors applied to this yarn are noted for being more brilliant than colors applied to softer yarn. This type of thread was first made in the city of Lisle, France (now [[Lille]]), hence its name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/lisle Lisle Definition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915000508/http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/lisle |date=15 September 2015 }} Retrieved 3 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z8soAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA244&amp;lpg=PA244&amp;dq=lisle+cotton+history&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=011go2YzSi&amp;sig=L8ZHE0fvozds5hggAC5qqImYxU8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=lisle%20cotton%20history&amp;f=false Cole, George S.

==International trade==
[[File:CottonYield.png|thumb|Worldwide cotton production]]

The largest producers of cotton, currently (2009), are China and India, with annual production of about 34 million bales and 33.4 million bales, respectively; most of this production is consumed by their respective textile industries. The largest exporters of raw cotton are the United States, with sales of $4.9 billion, and Africa, with sales of $2.1 billion. The total international trade is estimated to be $12 billion. Africa's share of the cotton trade has doubled since 1980. Neither area has a significant domestic textile industry, textile manufacturing having moved to developing nations in Eastern and South Asia such as India and China. In Africa, cotton is grown by numerous small holders. Dunavant Enterprises, based in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], is the leading cotton broker in Africa, with hundreds of purchasing agents. It operates [[cotton gin]]s in Uganda, Mozambique, and Zambia. In Zambia, it often offers loans for seed and expenses to the 180,000 small farmers who grow cotton for it, as well as advice on farming methods. [[Cargill]] also purchases cotton in Africa for export.

The 25,000 cotton growers in the United States are heavily [[subsidy|subsidized]] at the rate of $2 billion per year although China now provides the highest overall level of cotton sector support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agritrade.cta.int/Agriculture/Commodities/Cotton/Executive-Brief-Update-2013-Cotton-sector "Executive Brief Update 2013: Cotton sector"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224045221/http://agritrade.cta.int/Agriculture/Commodities/Cotton/Executive-Brief-Update-2013-Cotton-sector |date=24 February 2014 }}. ''cta.int''.&lt;/ref&gt; The future of these subsidies is uncertain and has led to anticipatory expansion of cotton brokers' operations in Africa. Dunavant expanded in Africa by buying out local operations. This is only possible in former British colonies and Mozambique; former French colonies continue to maintain tight monopolies, inherited from their former colonialist masters, on cotton purchases at low fixed prices.&lt;ref&gt;Zachary, G. Pascal (14 January 2007) [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/14/business/yourmoney/14duna.html?n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FOrganizations%2FW%2FWorld%20Trade%20Organization%20&amp;_r=0 "Out of Africa: Cotton and Cash"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625071441/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/14/business/yourmoney/14duna.html?n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FOrganizations%2FW%2FWorld%20Trade%20Organization%20&amp;_r=0 |date=25 June 2017 }}.

===Fair trade===
Cotton is an enormously important commodity throughout the world. However, many farmers in developing countries receive a low price for their produce, or find it difficult to compete with developed countries.

This has led to an international dispute (see [[United States&amp;nbsp;– Brazil cotton dispute]]):

&lt;blockquote&gt;On 27 September 2002, Brazil requested consultations with the US regarding prohibited and actionable subsidies provided to US producers, users and/or exporters of upland cotton, as well as legislation, regulations, statutory instruments and amendments thereto providing such subsidies (including export credits), grants, and any other assistance to the US producers, users and exporters of upland cotton.&lt;ref&gt;United States&amp;nbsp;– Subsidies on Upland Cotton, [http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds267_e.htm World Trade Organization] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403032503/http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds267_e.htm |date=3 April 2013 }}. Retrieved 2 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 September 2004, the Panel Report recommended that the United States "withdraw" export credit guarantees and payments to domestic users and exporters, and "take appropriate steps to remove the adverse effects or withdraw" the mandatory price-contingent subsidy measures.&lt;ref&gt;United States&amp;nbsp;– Subsidies on Upland Cotton, [https://web.archive.org/web/20120520140128/http://docsonline.wto.org/DDFDocuments/t/WT/DS/267R.doc World Trade Organization]. Retrieved 2 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While Brazil was fighting the US through the WTO's Dispute Settlement Mechanism against a heavily subsidized cotton industry, a group of four least-developed African countries&amp;nbsp;– Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, and Mali&amp;nbsp;– also known as "Cotton-4" have been the leading protagonist for the reduction of US cotton subsidies through negotiations. The four introduced a "Sectoral Initiative in Favour of Cotton", presented by Burkina Faso's President Blaise Compaoré during the Trade Negotiations Committee on 10 June 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/agric_e/cotton_subcommittee_e.htm The Cotton Sub-Committee] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902015509/http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/agric_e/cotton_subcommittee_e.htm |date=2 September 2012 }}. World Trade Organization. Retrieved 3 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to concerns over subsidies, the cotton industries of some countries are criticized for employing child labor and damaging workers' health by exposure to pesticides used in production. The [[Environmental Justice Foundation]] has campaigned against the prevalent use of forced child and adult labor in cotton production in [[Uzbekistan]], the world's third largest cotton exporter.&lt;ref&gt;The Environmental Justice Foundation. [https://web.archive.org/web/20120815042003/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page93.html "Environmental Justice Foundation: Reports on Cotton"] retrieved 22 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The international production and trade situation has led to "[[fair trade]]" cotton clothing and footwear, joining a rapidly growing market for organic clothing, fair fashion or "ethical fashion". The fair trade system was initiated in 2005 with producers from [[Cameroon]], [[Mali]] and [[Senegal]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131123215524/http://r0.unctad.org/infocomm/anglais/cotton/market.htm#fair#fair Market: Cotton].

==Genome==
{{Technical|section=Cotton genome|date=January 2011}}
There is a public effort to sequence the genome of cotton. It was started in 2007 by a consortium of public researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Chen|first1=Z. J.|last2=Scheffler|first2=B.

A.|last29=Mehboob-Ur-Rahman|last30=Zafar|first30=Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their aim is to sequence the genome of cultivated, tetraploid cotton. "Tetraploid" means that its nucleus has two separate genomes, called A and D. The consortium agreed to first sequence the D-genome wild relative of cultivated cotton (''G. raimondii'', a Central American species) because it is small and has few repetitive elements. It has nearly one-third of the bases of tetraploid cotton, and each chromosome occurs only once.{{Clarify|date=January 2011}} Then, the A genome of ''G. arboreum'' would be sequenced. Its genome is roughly twice that of ''G. raimondii''. Part of the difference in size is due the amplification of ''retrotransposons'' (GORGE). After both diploid genomes are assembled, they would be used as models for sequencing the genomes of tetraploid cultivated species. Without knowing the diploid genomes, the euchromatic DNA sequences of AD genomes would co-assemble, and their repetitive elements would assemble independently into A and D sequences respectively. There would be no way to untangle the mess of AD sequences without comparing them to their diploid counterparts.

The public sector effort continues with the goal to create a high-quality, draft genome sequence from reads generated by all sources. The effort has generated Sanger reads of BACs, fosmids, and plasmids, as well as 454 reads. These later types of reads will be instrumental in assembling an initial draft of the D genome. In 2010, the companies [[Monsanto]] and [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]] completed enough Illumina sequencing to cover the D genome of ''G. raimondii'' about 50x.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Monsanto and Illumina Reach Key Milestone in Cotton Genome Sequencing|url = http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/monsanto-illumina-key-milestone-cotton-genome-sequencing.aspx|website = www.monsanto.com|access-date = 2016-01-31|last = APPDMZ\gyoung|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160201042838/http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/monsanto-illumina-key-milestone-cotton-genome-sequencing.aspx|archivedate = 1 February 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They announced that they would donate their raw reads to the public. This public relations effort gave them some recognition for sequencing the cotton genome. Once the D genome is assembled from all of this raw material, it will undoubtedly assist in the assembly of the AD genomes of cultivated varieties of cotton, but much work remains.

'''Damping capacity''' is the ability of a material to absorb energy by converting mechanical energy into heat. 

== Overview ==

A large damping capacity is desirable for materials used in structures where unwanted vibrations are induced during operation such as machine tool bases or crankshafts. Materials like brass and steel have small damping capacities allowing vibration energy to be transmitted through them without attenuation. An example of a material with a large damping capacity is [[gray cast iron]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DeGarmo|first=Paul|title=Materials and Processes in Manufacturing|year=2012|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9780470924679|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An understanding of this effect can be gained from observation of a stress-strain diagram with exaggerated features. The units of stress are force per unit area, while strain has units of length per length. Any area covered by integrating each instant of a loading and unloading cycle will then be in terms of force times length per volume, which is equivalent to energy per unit volume. This energy represents the amount of mechanical energy being converted to heat in a volume of material resulting in damping.

The '''Darkhovin Nuclear Power Plant''' (also known as ''Esteghlal Nuclear Power Plant'') is a planned [[nuclear power|nuclear]] [[Power station|power plant]] located about 70&amp;nbsp;kilometers south of [[Ahvaz]], [[Iran]] at the [[Karun]] river, as part of the [[nuclear program of Iran]]. One reactor is firmly planned. Some other projects on this site were cancelled.

== History ==
Before the [[Iranian Revolution]], [[Iran]] had signed a 2 billion dollar contract with French company [[Framatome]] to build two 910 MW [[pressurized water reactor]]s, at [[Darkhovin]]. After the Revolution, [[France]] withdrew from the project and the engineering components of the plant were withheld in France. The Iranian components were then used to build the units 5 and 6 of [[Gravelines Nuclear Power Station]] in France which went online in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf119_nucleariran.html&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the [[power station]] was halted during [[Iran–Iraq War]]. In 1992, Iran signed an agreement with [[China]] to build two 300 MW reactors at the site, which were to be completed within ten years and would have been similar to [[Chashma Nuclear Power Plant]] in Pakistan which is built by China.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iran-e-sabz.org/news/nuc1b.htm&lt;/ref&gt; But later on China withdrew from the project under [[United States]] pressure.&lt;ref&gt;http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/1998/issue2/jv2n2a7.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/iran/esfahan-nuke.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was subsequently taken up by Iran itself, as no other country was ready to cooperate in its construction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=162343&lt;/ref&gt; Iran started to indigenously design the reactor for Darkhovin Nuclear Power Plant basing the design on [[IR-40]] reactor using [[heavy water]]. The Iranian nuclear reactor design has a capacity of 360 MW. The plant was announced in 2008, originally scheduled to come online in 2016,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL0812863720080208&lt;/ref&gt; but construction has been delayed.&lt;ref name="Darkhovain on the PRIS of the IAEA"&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/cgi-bin/db.page.pl/pris.prdeta.htm?country=IR&amp;refno=9 Darkhovain on the PRIS of the IAEA]&lt;/ref&gt; There is currently no public information on how many reactors the [[power station]] is planned to house. The plant is going to be Iran's first indigenously designed and built nuclear power plant besides the [[research reactor]] of IR-40.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/352355/iran_press_official_provides_details_on_native_iranian_nuclear_plant/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iranwatch.org/wmd/wmd-nukemilestones.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ahwazstudies.org/content/view/2852/53/lang,english/ {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223075230/http://www.ahwazstudies.org/content/view/2852/53/lang%2Cenglish/ |date=2012-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
In 1976 novel of [[Paul Erdman]], ''Crash of '79'', Darkhovin Nuclear Power Plant is mentioned to have been completed by [[France]] and [[Mohammed Reza Pahlavi]] the then [[Shah]] of Iran uses the plant with the help from [[Israel]] and [[Switzerland]] to manufacture a dozen [[salted bomb]]s.

A '''dekatherm''' ('''dth''') is  a unit of [[energy]] used primarily to measure [[natural gas]], developed in about 1972 by the [[Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation]], a natural gas [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] company. It is equal to 10 [[therm]]s or 1,000,000 [[British thermal units]] (MMBtu) or 1.055 GJ.&lt;ref name="TurnerDoty2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wayne C. Turner|author2=Steve Doty|title=Energy Management Handbook: 8th Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T6lUCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT337|date=8 October 2013|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-304-52087-6|pages=337–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TurnerDoty2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wayne C.

Natural gas is a mixture of gases containing approximately 80% methane (CH4) and its heating value varies from about 975 Btu/cf (1.026 Mcf/dth) to 1100 Btu/cf (0.91 Mcf/dth) depending on the mix of different gases in the gas stream. Noncombustible carbon dioxide (CO2) lowers the heating value of natural gas.  Heavier hydrocarbons such as ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H8), and  butane (C4H10) increase its heating value.  Since customers who buy natural gas are actually buying heat, gas distribution companies who bill by volume routinely adjust their rates to compensate for this.&lt;ref name="Its1977"&gt;{{cite book|author=Its|title=Bulletin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ISYSAQAAMAAJ|year=1977|publisher=The Univ.|page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To simplify billing, Texas Eastern staff members coined the term decatherm (ten therms) and proposed using calorimeters to measure and bill gas delivered to customers in dekatherms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Proceedings|publisher=International Society of Hydrocarbon Measurement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X20iAQAAMAAJ|year=1982|page=394}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This would eliminate the constant calculation of rate adjustments to $/Mcf rates in order to assure that all customers received the same amount of heat per dollar. A settlement agreement reflecting the new billing procedure and settlement rates was filed in 1973.  The FPC{{clarify|date=February 2016}} issued an order approving the settlement agreement and the new tariff using dekatherms later that year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Public Utilities Reports|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MpQmAQAAMAAJ|year=1986|publisher=Lawyers Cooperative Publishing Company|page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other gas distribution companies also began to use this process.&lt;ref name="Poor's1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Standard &amp; Poor's|title=Standard and Poor's Smallcap Six Hundred Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nR4WAQAAMAAJ|year=1997|publisher=McGraw-Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the need for adjustments, many companies continue to use cubic feet rather than dekatherms to measure and bill natural gas.&lt;ref name="McAllister2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=E.W.

[[File:Dryer with smart load control switch.jpg|thumb|right|A clothes dryer using a [[Load control switch|demand response switch]] to reduce peak demand]]
[[File:Load diagram.png|thumb|Daily load diagram; Blue shows real load usage and green shows ideal load.]]
'''Demand response''' is a change in the power consumption of an [[electric utility]] customer to better match the demand for power with the supply. Until recently electric energy could not be easily stored, so utilities have traditionally matched demand and supply by  throttling the production rate of their [[power plant]]s, taking generating units on or off line, or importing power from other utilities. There are limits to what can be achieved on the supply side, because some generating units can take a long time to come up to full power, some units may be very expensive to operate, and demand can at times be greater than the capacity of all the available power plants put together. Demand response seeks to adjust the demand for power instead of adjusting the supply.

Utilities may signal demand requests to their customers in a variety of ways, including simple off-peak metering, in which power is cheaper at certain times of the day, and [[smart meter]]ing, in which explicit requests or changes in price can be communicated to customers.

The customer may adjust power demand by postponing some tasks that require large amounts of electric power, or may decide to pay a higher price for their electricity. Some customers may switch part of their consumption to alternate sources, such as on-site diesel generators.

In many respects, demand response can be put simply as a technology-enabled economic rationing system for electric power supply.  In demand response, voluntary rationing is accomplished by price incentives—offering lower net unit pricing in exchange for reduced power consumption in peak periods. The direct implication is that users of electric power capacity not reducing usage (load) during peak periods will pay "surge" unit prices, whether directly, or factored into general rates.

Involuntary rationing, if employed, would be accomplished via rolling blackouts during peak load periods. Practically speaking, summer heat waves and winter deep freezes might be characterized by planned power outages for consumers and businesses if voluntary rationing via incentives fail to reduce load adequately to match total power supply.

==Background==
According to the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]], demand response (DR) is defined as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Balijepalli|first=Murthy|author2=Pradhan, Khaparde|title=Review of Demand Response under Smart Grid Paradigm|journal=IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
“Changes in electric usage by end-use customers from their normal consumption patterns in response to changes in the price of electricity over time, or to incentive payments designed to induce lower electricity use at times of high wholesale market prices or when system reliability is jeopardized.” DR includes all intentional modifications to consumption patterns of electricity to induce customers that are intended to alter the timing, level of instantaneous demand, or the total electricity consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Albadi|first=M. H.|author2=E. F. El-Saadany|title=Demand Response in Electricity Markets: An Overview|journal=IEEE|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is expected that demand response programs will be designed to decrease electricity consumption or shift it from on-peak to off-peak periods depending on consumers’ 
preferences and lifestyles.&lt;ref&gt;Sianaki, O.A.; Masoum, M.A.S., "A fuzzy TOPSIS approach for home energy management in smart grid with considering householders' preferences," Innovative Smart Grid Technologies (ISGT), 2013 IEEE PES, vol., no., pp.1,6, 24-27 Feb. 2013, {{doi|10.1109/ISGT.2013.6497819}}, http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6497819&amp;isnumber=6497783&lt;/ref&gt; Demand Response can be defined as "a wide range of actions which can be taken at the customer side of the electricity meter in response to particular conditions within the electricity system (such as peak period network congestion or high prices)".&lt;ref&gt;Torriti, Jacopo (2016) "Peak energy demand and Demand Side Response" (Routledge): https://www.routledge.com/products/9781138016255&lt;/ref&gt; Demand response is a reduction in demand designed to reduce peak demand or avoid system emergencies. Hence, demand response can be a more cost-effective alternative than adding generation capabilities to meet the peak and or occasional demand spikes. The underlying objective of DR is to actively engage customers in modifying their consumption in response to pricing signals. The goal is to reflect supply expectations through consumer [[price signal]]s or controls and enable dynamic changes in consumption relative to price.&lt;ref&gt;Sianaki, O.A.; Hussain, O.; Dillon, T.; Tabesh, A.R., "Intelligent Decision Support System for Including Consumers' Preferences in Residential Energy Consumption in Smart Grid," Computational Intelligence, Modelling and Simulation (CIMSiM), 2010 Second International Conference on, vol., no., pp.154,159, 28-30 Sept. 2010 {{doi|10.1109/CIMSiM.2010.84;URL:}} http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5701838&amp;isnumber=5701812&lt;/ref&gt;

In electricity grids, DR is similar to [[Dynamic demand (electric power)|dynamic demand]] mechanisms to manage customer consumption of electricity in response to supply conditions, for example, having electricity customers reduce their consumption at critical times or in response to market prices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claverton-energy.com/download/42/] Description of French EJP demand reduction tariff&lt;/ref&gt; The difference is that demand response mechanisms respond to explicit requests to shut off, whereas dynamic demand devices passively shut off when stress in the grid is sensed. Demand response can involve actually curtailing power used or by starting on-site generation which may or may not be connected in parallel with the grid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claverton-energy.com/download/131/ Load management using diesel generators - talk at Open University - Dave Andrews Claverton Energy Group]&lt;/ref&gt; This is a quite different concept from [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], which means using less power to perform the same tasks, on a continuous basis or whenever that task is performed. At the same time, demand response is a component of smart energy demand, which also includes energy efficiency, home and building energy management, [[Distributed Energy Resources|distributed renewable resources]], and electric vehicle charging.&lt;ref name="IEEE Conference Publication 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=Electric vehicles connection to microgrid effects on peak demand with and without demand response | website=IEEE Conference Publication | date=2017-12-18 | url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7985237/ | access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bookSG"&gt;{{cite book|title=Smart Grid - Applicacions, Communications and Security|date=April 2012|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-1-1180-0439-5|url=http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118004396.html|editor1=Berger, Lars T. |editor2=Iniewski, Krzysztof }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current demand response schemes are implemented with large and small commercial as well as residential customers, often through the use of dedicated control systems to shed loads in response to a request by a utility or market price conditions. Services (lights, machines, air conditioning) are reduced according to a preplanned load prioritization scheme during the critical time frames. An alternative to load shedding is on-site generation of electricity to supplement the [[Electrical grid|power grid]]. Under conditions of tight electricity supply, demand response can significantly decrease the peak price and, in general, electricity price volatility.

Demand response is generally used to refer to mechanisms used to encourage consumers to reduce demand, thereby reducing the [[peak demand]] for electricity. Since electrical generation and transmission systems are generally sized to correspond to peak demand (plus margin for forecasting error and unforeseen events), lowering peak demand reduces overall plant and [[capital cost]] requirements. Depending on the configuration of generation capacity, however, demand response may also be used to increase demand (load) at times of high production and low demand. Some systems may thereby encourage [[energy storage]] to [[arbitrage]] between periods of low and high demand (or low and high prices).

There are three types of demand response - emergency demand response, economic demand response and ancillary services demand response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819194522/http://www.energydsm.com/demand-response|url=http://www.energydsm.com/demand-response|title=Description of the two types of demand response|archivedate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emergency demand response is employed to avoid involuntary service interruptions during times of supply scarcity.  Economic demand response is employed to allow electricity customers to curtail their consumption when the productivity or convenience of consuming that electricity is worth less to them than paying for the electricity.  Ancillary services demand response consists of a number of specialty services that are needed to ensure the secure operation of the transmission grid and which have traditionally been provided by generators.

==Smart grid application==
[[Smart grid]] applications improve the ability of electricity producers and consumers to communicate with one another and make decisions about how and when to produce and consume electrical power.&lt;ref name="bookSG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Siano|first1=Pierluigi|title=Demand response and smart grids - A survey|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|date=2014|volume=30|pages=461–478|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2013.10.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; This emerging technology will allow customers to shift from an event-based demand response where the utility requests the shedding of load, towards a more 24/7-based demand response where the customer sees incentives for controlling load all the time. Although this back-and-forth dialogue increases the opportunities for demand response, customers are still largely influenced by economic incentives and are reluctant to relinquish total control of their assets to utility companies.&lt;ref name=jrcSG&gt;{{cite web|title=Smart Grid Projects in Europe: Lessons learned and current developments|url=http://ses.jrc.ec.europa.eu/sites/ses.jrc.ec.europa.eu/files/documents/ld-na-25815-en-n_final_online_version_april_15_smart_grid_projects_in_europe_-_lessons_learned_and_current_developments_-2012_update.pdf|work=JRC Scientific and Policy Report|accessdate=3 May 2014|author1=Giordano V. |author2=Meletiou, A. |author3=Covrig, C. F. |author4=Mengolini, A. |author5=Ardelean, M. |author6=Fulli, G |author7=Jiménez, M. S. |author8=Filiou, C. |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One advantage of a smart grid application is time-based pricing. Customers who traditionally pay a fixed rate for consumed energy ([[kWh]]) and requested [[peak load]] can set their threshold and adjust their usage to take advantage of fluctuating prices. This may require the use of an energy management system to control appliances and equipment and can involve economies of scale. Another advantage, mainly for large customers with generation, is being able to closely monitor, shift, and balance load in a way that allows the customer to save peak load and not only save on kWh and kW/month but be able to trade what they have saved in an energy market. Again this involves sophisticated energy management systems, incentives, and a viable trading market.

Smart grid applications increase the opportunities for demand response by providing [[Real-time computing|real time]] data to producers and consumers, but the economic and environmental incentives remain the driving force behind the practice.

One of the most important means of demand response in the future smart grids is electric vehicles. Aggregation of this new source of energy, which is also a new source of uncertainty in the electrical systems, is critical to preserving the stability and quality of smart grids, consequently, the electric vehicle parking lots can be considered a demand response aggregation entity.&lt;ref&gt;Shafie-khah, Miadreza, et al. "[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=7328756&amp;isnumber=7593445 Optimal behavior of electric vehicle parking lots as demand response aggregation agents]." IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid 7.6 (2016): 2654-2665. doi: 10.1109/TSG.2015.2496796 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Electricity pricing==
[[File:Demand response.png|450px|thumb|right|Explanation of demand response effects on a quantity (Q) - price (P) graph. Under inelastic demand (D1) extremely high price (P1) may result on a strained [[electricity market]].&lt;br /&gt;If demand response measures are employed the demand becomes more elastic (D2). A much lower price will result in the market (P2).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is estimated&lt;ref name="IEA-billing-2003"&gt;[http://www.iea.org/textbase/speech/2003/phbilling.pdf The Power to Choose - Enhancing Demand Response in Liberalised Electricity Markets] Findings of [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] Demand Response Project, Presentation 2003&lt;/ref&gt; that a 5% lowering of demand would result in a 50% price reduction during the peak hours of the [[California electricity crisis]] in 2000/2001. The market also becomes more resilient to intentional withdrawal of offers from the supply side.]]
In most electric power systems, some or all consumers pay a fixed price per unit of electricity independent of the cost of production at the time of consumption. The consumer price may be established by the government or a regulator, and typically represents an average cost per [[unit of production]] over a given timeframe (for example, a year). Consumption therefore is not sensitive to the cost of production in the short term (e.g. on an hourly basis). In economic terms, consumers' usage of electricity is [[elasticity (economics)|inelastic]] in short time frames since the consumers do not face the actual price of production; if consumers were to face the short run costs of production they would be more inclined to change their use of electricity in reaction to those price signals.  A pure economist might extrapolate the concept to hypothesize that consumers served under these fixed-rate tariffs are endowed with theoretical "call options" on electricity, though in reality, like any other business, the customer is simply buying what is on offer at the agreed price.&lt;ref&gt;Borlick, Robert L., Pricing Negawatts - DR design flaws create perverse incentives, PUBLIC UTILITIES FORTNIGHTLY, August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  A customer in a department store buying a $10 item at 9.00 am might notice 10 sales staff on the floor but only one occupied serving him or her, while at 3.00 pm the customer could buy the same $10 article and notice all 10 sales staff occupied.  In a similar manner, the department store cost of sales at 9.00 am might therefore be 5-10 times that of its cost of sales at 3.00 pm, but it would be far-fetched to claim that the customer, by not paying significantly more for the article at 9.00 am than at 3.00 pm, had a 'call option' on the $10 article.

In virtually all power systems electricity is produced by generators that are dispatched in merit order, i.e., generators with the lowest marginal cost (lowest variable cost of production) are used first, followed by the next cheapest, etc., until the instantaneous electricity demand is satisfied. In most power systems the wholesale price of electricity will be equal to the marginal cost of the highest cost generator that is injecting energy, which will vary with the level of demand. Thus the variation in pricing can be significant: for example, in Ontario between August and September 2006, wholesale prices (in Canadian Dollars) paid to producers ranged from a peak of $318 per MW·h to a minimum of - (negative) $3.10 per MW·h.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieso.ca/imoweb/pubs/marketReports/monthly/2006aug.pdf Monthly Market Report - July 2006&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ieso.ca/imoweb/pubs/marketReports/monthly/2006sep.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not unusual for the price to vary by a factor of two to five due to the daily demand cycle.  A negative price indicates that producers were being charged to provide electricity to the grid (and consumers paying real-time pricing may have actually received a rebate for consuming electricity during this period).  This generally occurs at night when demand falls to a level where all generators are operating at their minimum output levels and some of them must be shut down.  The negative price is the inducement to bring about these shutdowns in a least-cost manner.&lt;ref name="Optimizing"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liasi|first1=Sahand|last2=Bathaee|first2=Seyed|title=Optimizing microgrid using demand response and electric vehicles connection to microgrid|journal=Smart Grid Conference (SGC)|date=20 December 2017|page=1–7|doi=10.1109/SGC.2017.8308873|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8308873/|accessdate=29 March 2018|isbn=978-1-5386-4279-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two [[Carnegie Mellon]] studies in 2006 looked at the importance of demand response for the electricity industry in general terms&lt;ref&gt;[http://wpweb2.tepper.cmu.edu/ceic/papers/ceic-07-01.asp CEIC Working Paper Abstract&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and with specific application of real-time pricing for consumers for the [[PJM Interconnection]] Regional Transmission authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wpweb2.tepper.cmu.edu/ceic/papers/ceic-07-02.asp CEIC Working Paper Abstract&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The latter study found that even small shifts in peak demand would have a large effect on savings to consumers and avoided costs for additional peak capacity: a 1% shift in peak demand would result in savings of 3.9%, billions of dollars at the system level. An approximately 10% reduction in peak demand (achievable depending on the [[elasticity of demand]]) would result in systems savings of between $8 to $28 billion.

In a discussion paper, Ahmad Faruqui, a principal with the [[Brattle Group]], estimates that a 5 percent reduction in US peak electricity demand could produce approximately $35 billion in cost savings over a 20-year period, exclusive of the cost of the metering and communications needed to implement the dynamic pricing needed to achieve these reductions.  While the net benefits would be significantly less than the claimed $35 billion, they would still be quite substantial.&lt;ref&gt;The Brattle Group, The Power of Five Percent, How Dynamic Pricing Can Save $35 Billion in Electricity Costs, May 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In Ontario, Canada, the Independent Electricity System Operator has noted that in 2006, peak demand exceeded 25,000 megawatts during only 32 system hours (less than 0.4% of the time), while maximum demand during the year was just over 27,000 megawatts. The ability to "shave" peak demand based on reliable commitments would therefore allow the province to reduce built capacity by approximately 2,000 megawatts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/columnists/article/243454|author=Tyler Hamilton|newspaper=The Toronto Star|title=A megawatt saved is a 'negawatt' earned|date=August 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electricity grids and peak demand response==
[[File:Stwlan.dam.jpg|thumb|The upper reservoir (Llyn Stwlan) and dam of the [[Ffestiniog Power Station|Ffestiniog Pumped Storage Scheme]] in north Wales]]
In an electricity grid, electricity consumption and production must balance at all times; any significant imbalance could cause grid instability or severe voltage fluctuations, and cause failures within the grid. Total generation capacity is therefore sized to correspond to total peak demand with some margin of error and allowance for contingencies (such as plants being off-line during peak demand periods). Operators will generally plan to use the least expensive generating capacity (in terms of [[marginal cost]]) at any given period, and use additional capacity from more expensive plants as demand increases. Demand response in most cases is targeted at reducing peak demand to reduce the risk of potential disturbances, avoid additional capital cost requirements for additional plants, and avoid use of more expensive and/or less efficient operating plants. Consumers of electricity will also pay higher prices if generation capacity is used from a higher-cost source of power generation.

Demand response may also be used to increase demand during periods of high supply and/or low demand. Some types of generating plant must be run at close to full capacity (such as nuclear), while other types may produce at negligible marginal cost (such as wind and solar). Since there is usually limited capacity to store energy, demand response may attempt to increase load during these periods to maintain grid stability. For example, in the province of Ontario in September 2006, there was a short period of time when electricity prices were negative for certain users. [[Energy storage]] such as [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] is a way to increase load during periods of low demand for use during later periods. Use of demand response to increase load is less common, but may be necessary or efficient in systems where there are large amounts of generating capacity that cannot be easily cycled down.

Some grids may use pricing mechanisms that are not real-time, but easier to implement (users pay higher prices during the day and lower prices at night, for example) to provide some of the benefits of the demand response mechanism with less demanding technological requirements. In the UK, [[Economy 7]] and similar schemes that attempt to shift demand associated with electric heating to overnight off-peak periods have been in operation since the 1970s. More recently, in 2006 Ontario began implementing a "smart meter" program that implements "time-of-use" (TOU) pricing, which tiers pricing according to on-peak, mid-peak and off-peak schedules. During the winter, on-peak is defined as morning and early evening, mid-peak as midday to late afternoon, and off-peak as nighttime; during the summer, the on-peak and mid-peak periods are reversed, reflecting air conditioning as the driver of summer demand. As of May 1, 2015, most Ontario electrical utilities have completed converting all customers to "smart meter" time-of-use billing with on-peak rates about 200% and mid-peak rates about 150% of the off-peak rate per kWh.

Australia has national standards for Demand Response (AS/NZS 4755 series), which has been implemented nation wide by electricity distributors for several decades, e.g. controlling storage water heaters, air conditioners and pool pumps. In 2016, how to manage electrical energy storage (e.g. batteries) has been added into the series of standards.

==Load shedding==
[[Electrical generation]] and transmission systems may not always meet peak demand requirements— the greatest amount of [[electricity]] required by all utility customers within a given region. In these situations, overall demand must be lowered, either by turning off service to some devices or cutting back the supply voltage ([[brownout (electricity)|brownout]]s), in order to prevent uncontrolled service disruptions such as [[power outage]]s (widespread blackouts) or equipment damage. Utilities may impose load shedding on service areas via [[rolling blackout]]s or by agreements with specific high-use industrial consumers to turn off equipment at times of system-wide peak demand.

==Incentives to shed loads==
Energy consumers need some incentive to respond to such a request from a [[demand response provider]] (see list of providers below). Demand response incentives can be formal or informal. For example, the utility might create a tariff-based incentive by passing along short-term increases in the price of electricity, or they might impose mandatory cutbacks during a heat wave for selected high-volume users, who are compensated for their participation. Other users may receive a rebate or other incentive based on firm commitments to reduce power during periods of high demand,&lt;ref&gt;[http://claverton-energy.com/energy-experts-wiki/EJP_-_load_reduction_in_France Description of French EJP tariff - Claverton Energy Group] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20120707075828/http://claverton-energy.com/energy-experts-wiki/EJP_-_load_reduction_in_France |date=July 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes referred to as ''[[negawatts]].''&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Commercial and industrial power users might impose load shedding on themselves, without a request from the utility. Some businesses generate their own power and wish to stay within their energy production capacity to avoid buying power from the grid. Some utilities have commercial tariff structures that set a customer's power costs for the month based on the customer's moment of highest use, or peak demand. This encourages users to flatten their demand for energy, known as [[energy demand management]], which sometimes requires cutting back services temporarily.

[[Smart meter]]ing has been implemented in some jurisdictions to provide real-time pricing for all types of users, as opposed to fixed-rate pricing throughout the demand period. In this application, users have a direct incentive to reduce their use at high-demand, high-price periods. Many users may not be able to effectively reduce their demand at various times, or the peak prices may be lower than the level required to induce a change in demand during short time periods (users have low [[price sensitivity]], or [[elasticity of demand]] is low). Automated control systems exist, which, although effective, may be too expensive to be feasible for some applications.

== Application for intermittent renewable distributed energy resources ==
The modern power grid is making a transition from the traditional vertically integrated utility structures to distributed systems as we begin to integrate higher penetrations of renewable energy generation. These sources of energy are often diffusely distributed and intermittent by nature. These features introduce problems in grid stability and efficiency which lead to limitations on the amount of these resources which can be effectively added to the grid. In a traditional vertically integrated grid, energy is provided by utility generators which are able to respond to changes in demand. Generation output by renewable resources is governed by environmental conditions and is generally not able to respond to changes in demand. Responsive control over non-critical loads which are connected to the grid has been shown to be an effective strategy which is able to mitigate harmful fluctuations introduced by these renewable resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reihani|first=Ehsan|last2=Thornton|first2=Matsu|last3=Reihani|first3=Ehsan|last4=Ghorbani|first4=Reza|year=2016|title=A novel approach using flexible scheduling and aggregation to optimize demand response in the developing interactive grid market architecture|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030626191631279X|journal=Applied Energy|volume=183|pages=445–455|via=Elsevier Science Direct|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.08.170}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way instead of letting the generation respond to changes in demand, we have the demand respond to changes in generation. This is the basis of demand response.    In order to implement demand response systems, we must be able to coordinate large numbers of distributed resources through sensors, actuators, and communications protocols. To be effective, the devices need to be economical, robust, and yet still effective at managing their tasks of control. In addition, a strong control mechanism must be created which is able to coordinate over large networks of devices to manage and optimize these distributed systems both from an economic standpoint and a security standpoint in grid stabilization.

In addition, the increased presence of variable renewable generation drives a greater need for authorities to procure more [[Ancillary services (electric power)|ancillary services]] (AS) for grid balance. One of these services is contingency reserve (CR), which is used to regulate the grid frequency in contingencies. Many [[Independent system operator|independent system operators]] (ISO) are structuring the rules of AS markets such that demand response (DR) can participate alongside traditional supply-side resources. The available capacity of the generators can be used more efficiently for power production which they were designed for and not CR, thereby cutting costs and reducing pollution. As the ratio of inverter-based generation compared to conventional generation increases, the mechanical inertia used to stabilize frequency decreases. When coupled with the sensitivity of inverter-based generation to transient frequencies, the provision of ancillary services from other sources than generators becomes increasingly important.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Motalleb|first=Mahdi|last2=Thornton|first2=Matsu|last3=Reihani|first3=Ehsan|last4=Ghorbani|first4=Reza|year=2016|title=A nascent market for contingency reserve services using demand response|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261916310182|journal=Applied Energy|volume=179|pages=985–995|via=Elsevier Science Direct|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.07.078}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Motalleb|first=Mahdi|last2=Thornton|first2=Matsu|last3=Reihani|first3=Ehsan|last4=Ghorbani|first4=Reza|year=2016|title=Providing frequency regulation reserve services using demand response scheduling|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196890416306276|journal=Energy Conversion and Management|volume=124|pages=439–452|via=Elsevier Science Direct|doi=10.1016/j.enconman.2016.07.049}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technologies for demand reduction==

Technologies are available, and more are under development, to automate the process of demand response. Such technologies detect the need for [[load shedding]], communicate the demand to participating users, automate load shedding, and verify compliance with demand-response programs. [[GridWise]] and [[EnergyWeb]] are two major federal initiatives in the United States to develop these technologies. Universities and private industry are also doing research and development in this arena. Scalable and comprehensive software solutions for DR enable business and industry growth.

Some utilities are considering and testing automated systems connected to industrial, commercial and residential users that can reduce consumption at times of peak demand, essentially delaying draw marginally. Although the amount of demand delayed may be small, the implications for the grid (including financial) may be substantial, since system stability planning often involves building capacity for extreme peak demand events, plus a margin of safety in reserve. Such events may only occur a few times per year.

The process may involve turning down or off certain appliances or sinks (and, when demand is unexpectedly low, potentially increasing usage). For example, heating may be turned down or [[air conditioning]] or [[refrigeration]] may be turned up (turning up to a higher temperature uses less electricity), delaying slightly the draw until a peak in usage has passed.&lt;ref name="TCL1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Safe Protocols for Generating Power Pulses with Heterogeneous Populations of Thermostatically Controlled Loads |author=N. A. Sinitsyn. S. Kundu, S. Backhaus |journal=[[Energy Conversion and Management]]|volume=67|year=2013|pages=297–308|arxiv=1211.0248|doi=10.1016/j.enconman.2012.11.021}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the city of Toronto, certain residential users can participate in a program (Peaksaver AC&lt;ref name="Peaksaver"&gt;[http://www.torontohydro.com/peaksaver Peaksaver]&lt;/ref&gt;) whereby the system operator can automatically control hot water heaters or air conditioning during peak demand; the grid benefits by delaying peak demand (allowing peaking plants time to cycle up or avoiding peak events), and the participant benefits by delaying consumption until after peak demand periods, when pricing should be lower. Although this is an experimental program, at scale these solutions have the potential to reduce peak demand considerably. The success of such programs depends on the development of appropriate technology, a suitable pricing system for electricity, and the cost of the underlying technology. Bonneville Power experimented with direct-control technologies in Washington and Oregon residences, and found that the avoided transmission investment would justify the cost of the technology.&lt;ref name="Ashland-Bonneville"&gt;[http://energypriorities.com/entries/2006/04/bpa_ashland_goodwatts.php Demand-Side Management Technology Avoids Grid Construction for Bonneville Power (Case Study)] April, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Other methods to implementing demand response approach the issue of subtly reducing duty cycles rather than implementing [[thermostat]] setbacks.&lt;ref name="SmartGridDC"&gt;[http://www.encycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Encycle-Savings-White-Paper.pdf Smart Grid: Taking our cue from nature]&lt;/ref&gt;  These can be implemented using customized building automation systems programming, or through swarm-logic methods coordinating multiple loads in a facility (e.g. Encycle's EnviroGrid controllers).&lt;ref name="BusinessWeek20090217"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/feb2009/tc20090216_083057.htm |title=Is Smart Energy Poised to Swarm California? |author=Katie Fehrenbacher |work=Businessweek.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221141541/http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/feb2009/tc20090216_083057.htm |archivedate=2009-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TechnologyReview20090204"&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/energy/22066/ MIT Technology Review: Managing Energy with Swarm Logic, Feb 04 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Encycle-EnviroGrid"&gt;[http://www.encycle.com/swarm-logic/ EnviroGrid Controllers employ Swarm Logic for Smart Grid Applications]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar approach can be implemented for managing air conditioning peak demand in summer peak regions. Pre-cooling or maintaining slightly higher thermostat setting can help with the peak demand reduction&lt;ref&gt;L. Liu, W. Miller, and G. Ledwich, "Community centre improvement to reduce air conditioning peak demand," presented at the 7th International Conference on Energy and Environment of Residential Buildings, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Qld, Australia, 2016. Available: http://eprints.qut.edu.au/101161/&lt;/ref&gt;.  

In 2008 it was announced that electric refrigerators will be sold in the UK sensing [[Dynamic demand (electric power)|dynamic demand]] which will delay or advance the cooling cycle based on monitoring grid frequency &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/bbc-talks-about-dynamic-demand-smart-fridges-and-smart-metering.html|title=BBC talks about Dynamic Demand (smart fridges) and Smart Metering.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they are not readily available as of 2018.

==Industrial customers==
Industrial customers are also providing demand response. Compared with commercial and residential loads, industrial loads have the following advantages:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Xiao|last2=Hug|first2=G.|last3=Kolter|first3=Z.|last4=Harjunkoski|first4=I.|date=2015-10-01|title=Industrial demand response by steel plants with spinning reserve provision|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=7335115|journal=North American Power Symposium (NAPS), 2015|pages=1–6|doi=10.1109/NAPS.2015.7335115|isbn=978-1-4673-7389-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; the magnitude of power consumption by an industrial manufacturing plant and the change in power it can provide are generally very large; besides, the industrial plants usually already have the infrastructures for control, communication and market participation, which enables the provision of demand response; moreover, some industrial plants such as the aluminum smelter&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Zhang|first=X.|last2=Hug|first2=G.|date=2014|chapter=Optimal regulation provision by aluminum smelters|chapter-url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6939343|title=2014 IEEE PES General Meeting: Conference &amp; Exposition|pages=1–5|doi=10.1109/PESGM.2014.6939343|isbn=978-1-4799-6415-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; are able to offer fast and accurate adjustments in their power consumption.

==Short-term inconvenience for long-term benefits==
Shedding loads during peak demand is important because it reduces the need for new power plants. To respond to high peak demand, utilities build very capital-intensive power plants and lines. Peak demand happens just a few times a year, so those assets run at a mere fraction of their capacity. Electric users pay for this idle capacity through the prices they pay for electricity. According to the Demand Response Smart Grid Coalition, 10%–20% of electricity costs in the United States are due to peak demand during only 100 hours of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128365808|title=How Smart Is The Smart Grid?|date=7 July 2010|work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; DR is a way for utilities to reduce the need for large capital expenditures, and thus keep rates lower overall; however, there is an economic limit to such reductions because consumers lose the productive or convenience value of the electricity not consumed. Thus, it is misleading to only look at the cost savings that demand response can produce without also considering what the consumer gives up in the process.

===Importance for the operation of electricity markets===
It is estimated&lt;ref name="IEA-billing-2003" /&gt; that a 5% lowering of demand would have resulted in a 50% price reduction during the peak hours of the [[California electricity crisis]] in 2000–2001. With consumers facing peak pricing and reducing their demand, the market should become more resilient to intentional withdrawal of offers from the supply side.

Residential and commercial electricity use often vary drastically during the day, and demand response attempts to reduce the variability based on pricing signals. There are three underlying tenets to these programs:
# Unused electrical production facilities represent a less efficient use of capital (little revenue is earned when not operating).
# Electric systems and grids typically scale total potential production to meet projected peak demand (with sufficient spare capacity to deal with unanticipated events).
# By "smoothing" demand to reduce peaks, less investment in operational reserve will be required, and existing facilities will operate more frequently.
In addition, significant peaks may only occur rarely, such as two or three times per year, requiring significant capital investments to meet infrequent events.

==US Energy Policy Act regarding demand response==
The [[United States]] [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]] has mandated the [[Secretary of Energy]] to submit to the [[US Congress]] "a report that identifies and quantifies the national benefits of demand response and makes a recommendation on achieving specific levels of such benefits by January 1, 2007." Such a report was published in February 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oe.energy.gov/DocumentsandMedia/congress_1252d.pdf Benefits of demand response in electricity markets and recommendations for achieving them] [[United States]] [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]] Report to the Congress, February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The report estimates that in 2004 potential demand response capability equaled about 20,500 megawatts ([[megawatt|MW]]), 3% of total U.S. peak demand, while actual delivered peak demand reduction was about 9,000 MW (1.3% of peak), leaving ample margin for improvement. It is further estimated that load management capability has fallen by 32% since 1996. Factors affecting this trend include fewer utilities offering load management services, declining enrollment in existing programs, the changing role and responsibility of utilities, and changing supply/demand balance.

To encourage the use and implementation of demand response in the United States, the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] (FERC) issued Order No. 745 in March 2011, which requires a certain level of compensation for providers of economic demand response that participate in wholesale power markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ferc.gov/media/news-releases/2011/2011-1/03-15-11.asp|title=FERC: News Release: FERC approves market-based demand response compensation rule|date=15 March 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order is highly controversial and has been opposed by a number of energy economists, including Professor [[William W. Hogan]] at [[Harvard University]]'s [[John F. Kennedy School of Government|Kennedy School]].  Professor Hogan asserts that the order overcompensates providers of demand response, thereby encouraging the curtailment of electricity whose economic value exceeds the cost of producing it.  Professor Hogan further asserts that Order No. 745 is anticompetitive and amounts to “…an application of regulatory authority to enforce a buyer’s cartel.”&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, William W., Implications for Consumers of the NOPR’s Proposal to Pay the LMP for All Demand Response, Statement submitted on behalf of the Electric Power Supply Association in FERC Docket No. RM10-17-000, May 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Several affected parties, including the State of California, have filed suit in federal court challenging the legality of Order 745.&lt;ref&gt;Electric Power Supply Association, et al, JOINT REQUEST FOR REHEARING OF THE ELECTRIC POWER SUPPLY ASSOCIATION, THE AMERICAN PUBLIC POWER ASSOCIATION, THE ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION ASSOCIATION AND THE NATIONAL RURAL ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE ASSOCIATION, FERC Docket No. RM10-17-001, April 14, 2011, California Public Utilities Commission, Demand Response Compensation in Organized Wholesale Energy Markets, Docket No. RM10-17-000, Request For Clarification or, in theAlternative, Request for Rehearing of the Public Utilities Commission of the State of California, April 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A debate regarding the economic efficiency and fairness of Order 745 appeared in a series of articles published in [[The Electricity Journal]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Falk, Paying For Demand Response at the Wholesale Level, ''The Electricity Journal'', November 2010, Vol. 23, Issue 9, pp. 13-18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Borlick, Paying For Demand Response at the Wholesale Level: The Small Consumer's Perspective, ''The Electricity Journal'', November 2011, Vol. 24, Issue 9, pp. 13-19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Constantine Gonatas, Areas of Congruence, Yes, But 'Pseudo-Agreement' on LMP, ''The Electricity Journal'', Jan./Feb. 2012, Vol. 25, Issue 1, pp. 1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 23, 2014, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals]] vacated Order 745 in its entirety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8932925879645846996|litigants=Electric Power Supply Ass'n v.

==Demand reduction and the use of diesel generators in the UK National Grid==
As of December 2009 UK National Grid had 2369&amp;nbsp;MW contracted to provide demand response, known as [[National Grid Reserve Service|STOR]], the demand side provides 839&amp;nbsp;MW (35%) from 89 sites. Of this 839&amp;nbsp;MW approximately 750&amp;nbsp;MW is back-up generation with the remaining being load reduction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.claverton-energy.com/commercial-opportunities-for-back-up-generation-and-load-reduction-via-national-grid-the-national-electricity-transmission-system-operator-netso-for-england-scotland-wales-and-offshore.html Commercial Opportunities for Back-Up Generation and Load Reduction via National Grid, the National Electricity Transmission System Operator (NETSO) for England, Scotland, Wales and Offshore&lt;/ref&gt; A paper based on extensive half-hourly demand profiles and observed electricity demand shifting for different commercial and industrial buildings in the UK shows that only a small minority engaged in load shifting and demand turn-down, while the majority of demand response is provided by stand-by generators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Grunewald |first=P.|author2=J.

A '''drawbridge mentality''' is the attitude of people who have migrated to a more exclusive or more "unspoilt" community and then campaign to preserve the tranquility of that community by opposing further inward migration by people or businesses and, possibly, any development or refurbishment, including plans put forward by those already located there.

The term can imply a selfish attitude and can be taken as an insult by people who have strong affection for their home locality and wish to protect it from any changes. It is closely related to the [[NIMBY]] attitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-07-16/local/me-16220_1_anaheim-hills | title=Orange County perspective: That Drawbridge Mentality | date=16 July 1994 | newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[drawbridge]] was historically the [[hinge]]d bridge at a [[Castle|castle's]] gates providing entry across a defensive [[moat]].  Raising the drawbridge to a vertical position was therefore one's means by which intruders could be shut out of the castle.

[[File:FISH 13 21.jpg|thumb|A fluorophore-labeled [[human cell]].]]

A '''fluorophore''' (or '''fluorochrome''', similarly to a [[chromophore]]) is a [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] [[chemical compound]] that can re-emit light upon light excitation. Fluorophores typically contain several combined [[aromaticity|aromatic]] groups, or planar or cyclic molecules with several [[pi bond|π bonds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Juan Carlos Stockert, Alfonso Blázquez-Castro|chapter=Chapter 3 Dyes and Fluorochromes|pages=61-95|title=Fluorescence Microscopy in Life Sciences|url=https://ebooks.benthamscience.com/book/9781681085180/|accessdate=24 December 2017|year=2017|publisher=Bentham Science Publishers|isbn=978-1-68108-519-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fluorophores are sometimes used alone, as a [[dye tracing|tracer]] in fluids, as a [[dye]] for [[staining]] of certain structures, as a substrate of [[enzyme]]s, or as a probe or indicator (when its fluorescence is affected by environmental aspects such as polarity or ions). More generally they are [[covalent bond|covalently bonded]] to a [[macromolecule]], serving as a marker (or dye, or tag, or reporter) for affine or bioactive reagents ([[antibodies]], peptides, nucleic acids). Fluorophores are notably used to stain tissues, cells, or materials in a variety of analytical methods, i.e., [[Fluorescence microscope|fluorescent imaging]] and [[fluorescence spectroscopy|spectroscopy]].

[[Fluorescein]], by its amine reactive isothiocyanate derivative [[Fluorescein isothiocyanate|FITC]], has been one of the most popular fluorophores. From antibody labeling, the applications have spread to nucleic acids thanks to (FAM ([[Carboxyfluorescein]]), TET,...). Other historically common fluorophores are derivatives of [[rhodamine]] (TRITC), [[coumarin]], and [[cyanine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rietdorf J |title=Microscopic Techniques | series = Advances in Biochemical Engineering / Biotechnology |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |date=2005 |pages= 246–9 |isbn=3-540-23698-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h9F_RGrIoicC&amp;pg=PA247 |accessdate=2008-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newer generations of fluorophores, many of which are proprietary, often perform better, being more photostable, brighter, and/or less [[pH]]-sensitive than traditional dyes with comparable excitation and emission.&lt;ref name=Pawley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lakowicz, JR |title=Principles of fluorescence spectroscopy |edition=3rd |publisher=Springer |date=2006 |page= 954 |isbn=978-0-387-31278-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fluorescence ==
The fluorophore absorbs light energy of a specific wavelength and re-emits light at a longer wavelength. The absorbed [[wavelength]]s, [[Quantum efficiency|energy transfer efficiency]], and time before emission depend on both the fluorophore structure and its chemical environment, as the molecule in its excited state interacts with surrounding molecules. Wavelengths of maximum absorption (≈ excitation) and emission (for example, Absorption/Emission = 485&amp;nbsp;nm/517&amp;nbsp;nm) are the typical terms used to refer to a given fluorophore, but the whole spectrum may be important to consider. The excitation wavelength spectrum may be a very narrow or broader band, or it may be all beyond a cutoff level. The emission spectrum is usually sharper than the excitation spectrum, and it is of a longer wavelength and correspondingly lower energy. Excitation energies range from [[ultraviolet]] through the [[visible spectrum]], and emission energies may continue from [[light|visible light]] into the [[near infrared]] region.

Main characteristics of fluorophores are :
* '''Maximum excitation and emission wavelength''' (expressed in [[nanometer]]s (nm)): corresponds to the peak in the excitation and emission spectra (usually one peak each),
* '''Molar absorption Coefficient''' ( in Molar&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;): links the quantity of absorbed light, at a given wavelength, to the concentration of fluorophore in solution.
* '''Quantum yield''': efficiency of the energy transferred from incident light to emitted fluorescence (= number of emitted photons per absorbed photons)
* '''Lifetime''' (in picoseconds): duration of the excited state of a fluorophore before returning to its ground state. It refers to the time taken for a population of excited fluorophores to decay to 1/e (≈0.368) of the original amount.
* '''Stokes shift''': difference between the maximum excitation and maximum emission wavelengths.

These characteristics drive other properties, including the photobleaching or photoresistance (loss of fluorescence upon continuous light excitation). Other parameters should be considered, as the polarity of the fluorophore molecule, the fluorophore size and shape (i.e. for [[Fluorescence anisotropy|polarization fluorescence]] pattern), and other factors can change the behavior of fluorophores.

Fluorophores can also be used to quench the fluorescence of other fluorescent dyes (see article [[Quenching (fluorescence)]]) or to relay their fluorescence at even longer wavelength (see article [[Förster resonance energy transfer|FRET]])

See more on [[Fluorescence#Equations|fluorescence principle]].

== Size (molecular weight) ==
Most fluorophores are organic [[small molecule]]s of 20 - 100 atoms (200 - 1000 [[Dalton (unit)|Dalton]] - the [[molecular weight]] may be higher depending on grafted modifications, and conjugated molecules), but there are also much larger natural fluorophores that are [[protein]]s: [[Green fluorescent protein]] (GFP) is 27 k[[Dalton (unit)|Da]] and several [[phycobiliprotein]]s (PE, APC...) are ≈240k[[Dalton (unit)|Da]].

Fluorescence particles are not considered fluorophores ([[quantum dot]]: 2-10&amp;nbsp;nm diameter, 100-100,000 atoms).

The size of the fluorophore might [[steric effects|steric]]ally hinder the tagged molecule, and affect the fluorescence polarity.

== Families ==

Fluorophore molecules could be either utilized alone, or serve as a fluorescent motif of a functional system. Based on molecular complexity and synthetic methods, fluorophore molecules could be generally classified into four categories: proteins and peptides, small organic compounds, synthetic oligomers and polymers, and multi-component systems.

[[Fluorescent protein]]s GFP (green), YFP (yellow) and RFP (red) can be attached to other specific proteins to form a [[fusion protein]], synthesized in cells after transfection of a suitable [[plasmid]] carrier.

'''Non-protein''' organic fluorophores belong to following major chemical families:
* [[Xanthene]] derivatives: [[fluorescein]], [[rhodamine]], [[Oregon green]], [[eosin]], and [[Texas red]]
* [[Cyanine]] derivatives: cyanine, [[Indocyanine green|indocarbocyanine]], [[oxacarbocyanine]], [[thiacarbocyanine]], and [[merocyanine]]
* [[Squaraine]] derivatives and ring-substituted squaraines, including Seta, SeTau, and Square dyes
* [[Naphthalene]] derivatives ([[Dansyl chloride|dansyl]] and [[6-Propionyl-2-Dimethylaminonaphthalene|prodan]] derivatives)
* [[Coumarin]] derivatives
* [[Furazan|oxadiazole]] derivatives: [[pyridyloxazole]], [[NBD-TMA|nitrobenzoxadiazole]] and [[benzoxadiazole]]
* [[Anthracene]] derivatives: [[anthraquinone]]s, including DRAQ5, DRAQ7 and CyTRAK Orange
* [[Pyrene]] derivatives: [[cascade blue]], etc.
* [[Oxazine]] derivatives: [[Nile red]], [[Nile blue]], [[cresyl violet]], [[oxazine 170]], etc.
* [[Acridine]] derivatives: [[proflavin]], [[acridine orange]], [[acridine yellow]], etc.
* [[Arylmethine]] derivatives: [[auramine]], [[crystal violet]], [[malachite green]]
* [[Tetrapyrrole]] derivatives: [[porphin]], [[phthalocyanine]], [[bilirubin]]

These fluorophores fluoresce thanks to delocalized electrons which can jump a band and stabilize the energy absorbed. [[Benzene]], one of the simplest aromatic hydrocarbons, for example, is excited at 254&amp;nbsp;nm and emits at 300&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://omlc.ogi.edu/spectra/PhotochemCAD/html/benzene.html Omlc.ogi.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; This discriminates fluorophores from quantum dots, which are fluorescent semiconductor [[nanoparticle]]s.

They can be attached to protein to specific functional groups, such as
- [[amino]] groups ([[Active ester]], [[Carboxylate]], [[Isothiocyanate]], [[hydrazine]])
- [[carboxyl]] groups ([[carbodiimide]])
- [[thiol]] ([[maleimide]], [[acetyl bromide]])
- [[azide]] (via [[click chemistry]] or non-specifically ([[glutaraldehyde]])).

Additionally, various functional groups can be present to alter its properties, such as solubility, or confer special properties, such as [[boronic acid]] which binds to sugars or multiple [[carboxyl group]]s to bind to certain cations. When the dye contains an electron-donating and an electron-accepting group at opposite ends of the aromatic system, this dye will probably be sensitive to the environment's polarity (solvatochromic), hence called environment-sensitive. Often dyes are used inside cells, which are impermeable to charged molecules, as a result of this the carboxyl groups are converted into an ester, which is removed by esterases inside the cells, e.g., [[fura-2AM]] and [[fluorescein-diacetate]].

== Applications ==
{{detail|Fluorescence in the life sciences}}

Fluorophores have particular importance in the field of [[biochemistry]] and [[protein]] studies, e.g., in [[immunofluorescence]] but also in cell analysis, e.g. [[immunohistochemistry]]&lt;ref name=Pawley&gt;{{cite book |author = Tsien RY|author2 = Waggoner A|editor=Pawley JB |chapter= Fluorophores for confocal microscopy | title=Handbook of biological confocal microscopy |publisher=Plenum Press |location=New York |date=1995 |pages=267–74 |isbn=0-306-44826-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=16Ft5k8RC-AC&amp;pg=PA267|accessdate=2008-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and [[small molecule sensors]].

== Uses outside the life sciences ==
Additionally fluorescent dyes find a wide use in industry, going under the name of "neon colours", such as
* multi-ton scale usages in textile dyeing and optical brighteners in [[laundry detergent]]s
* advanced [[cosmetics|cosmetic]] formulations; [[safety equipment]] and clothing
* [[organic light-emitting diode]]s (OLED)
* fine arts and design (posters and paintings)
* synergists for insecticides and experimental drugs
* used as a dye in [[highlighter]]s to give off a glow-like effect
* [[solar panel]]s (collect more light / wavelengths)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1280">In paper testing, '''folding endurance''' is defined as the logarithm (to the base of ten) of the number of [[double fold (paper testing)|double folds]] that are required to make a test piece break under standardized conditions:&lt;ref&gt;ISO 5626:1993 Paper &amp;ndash; Determination of folding endurance, 3.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''F'' = log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; ''d'',

where ''F'' is the folding endurance and ''d'' the number of double folds.

Folding endurance is especially applicable for papers used for maps, bank notes, archival documents, etc. The direction of the grain in relation to the folding line, the type of fibres used, the fibre contents, the calliper of the test piece, etc., as well as which type of folding tester that is used affect how many double folds a test piece can take.

Folding endurance must not be confused with the related term [[fold number]].

==Standards on folding endurance==
*ISO 5626: Paper &amp;ndash; Determination of folding endurance.
*TAPPI Test Method T 511: Folding endurance of paper (MIT tester).
*TAPPI Test Method T 423: Folding endurance of paper (Schopper type tester).

*[[Fold number]]

The '''High Energy Liquid Laser Area Defense System''' (HELLADS), is a [[Counter Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar|Counter-RAM]] system under development that will use a powerful (150&amp;nbsp;kW) [[laser]] to shoot down [[rockets]], [[missiles]], [[artillery]] shells and [[mortar (weapon)|mortars]]. The initial system will be demonstrated from a static ground-based installation, but in order to eventually be integrated on an aircraft, design requirements are maximum weight of 750&amp;nbsp;kg (1,650&amp;nbsp;lb) and maximum envelope of 2 cubic meters (70.6&amp;nbsp;feet&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).

Development is being funded by [[The Pentagon]]'s [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA).

==History==
Liquid lasers that have large cooling systems can fire continuous beams, while solid state laser beams are more intense but generally must be fired in pulses to stop them from overheating. (As long as the heat transfer requirements are met solid state lasers can run continuously.) In the past, both types of lasers were very bulky because of their need for these huge cooling systems. The only aircraft in which they could fit were the size of jumbo jets.

Need for such a system was reinforced during the [[2006 Lebanon War]]. Israel had participated in similar work in the past by funding the Mobile [[Tactical High Energy Laser]] (MTHEL). This system was tested on August 24, 2004, and was found to be effective at neutralizing mortar threats under an actual scenario. However, this test was administered with short, 20&amp;nbsp;km range missiles.

==Development==
For the first few years of the program the Photonics Division of [[General Atomics]] was the prime contractor. The design combined the high energy density of a [[solid-state laser]] with the thermal management of a [[Dye laser|liquid laser]]. Dubbed the "HEL weapon", the initial prototype demonstrated firing a mild one kilowatt (kW) beam. Phase 3 of the program in 2007 demonstrated 15&amp;nbsp;kW power in a laboratory setting, and at the end of 2008 under the General Atomics bid, Lockheed Martin was selected as the weapon system integrator.

In September 2007, DARPA contracted [[Textron]] Systems to supply an alternate laser module using its proprietary "ThinZag" ceramic solid-state technology. Unlike the GA/Lockheed partnership, Textron will also perform the system integration function for their device. DARPA planned a "shoot-off" between the two contenders in 2009 to determine which would be funded to continue the program to further phases.

The more powerful version will produce a 150-kW beam capable of knocking down [[missiles]] with the weight and size requirements for fitting onto [[fighter aircraft]] or a [[Humvee]]. In mid 2008, ''[[Jane's International Defence Review]]'' quoted the US military that the program is on schedule to meet this ground test. Phase 4 of the program, involving outdoor testing of a weapon-power laser against tactical targets, was planned for 2010.

A prototype was expected to be available by the end of 2012. DARPA planned to use the completed prototypes against targets at [[White Sands Missile Range]] in early 2013. This included ground testing against rockets, mortars, and surface-to-air missiles.&lt;ref&gt;Neal Ungerleider, [http://www.fastcompany.com/1823017/darpa-unveils-drone-slaying-war-laser "DARPA Unveils Drone-Slaying War Laser"], Fastcompany.com, March 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

DARPA planned for General Atomics to produce a second HELLADS system in January 2013 for use by the [[Office of Naval Research]] to test against targets "relevant to surface ships." The first example is committed to Air Force use and cannot be made available for the Navy. Fabrication of the system was planned to be completed in 2012, with power, thermal management, beam control, and command-and-control subsystem integration planned through 2013. The system has a weight goal of {{convert|5|kg|lb|abbr=on}} per kW of energy. Both services plan for demonstrations in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Warwick, [http://www.aviationweek.com/Blogs.aspx?plckBlogId=blog:27ec4a53-dcc8-42d0-bd3a-01329aef79a7&amp;plckPostId=Blog:27ec4a53-dcc8-42d0-bd3a-01329aef79a7Post:7cb0a0b1-7082-41f8-aabb-7ad70a08a420 "Navy to Test-Fire DARPA's Hellads Laser"], ''Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology'', 24 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

General Atomics revealed in April 2015 that its Gen 3 High Energy Laser (HEL) completed beam quality and power measurements tests. The Gen 3 laser has a number of upgrades that provide improved beam quality, increased electrical to optical efficiency, and reduced size and weight; the assembly is small at only {{convert|1.3|x|0.4|x|0.5|m|ft}}, and is powered by a compact [[Lithium-ion battery]] to demonstrate deployability on tactical platforms. Beam quality remained constant through the 30-second demonstration, proving that the beam quality of electrically-pumped lasers can be maintained above 50 kilowatts. General Atomics plans to have the laser module deployable on their [[General Atomics Avenger|Avenger]] [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] by 2018.&lt;ref&gt;John McHale, [http://mil-embedded.com/news/high-energy-laser-from-general-atomics-finishes-beam-quality-test/ "High energy laser from General Atomics finishes beam quality test"], Mil-embedded.com, 9 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstrating sufficient laser power and beam quality ended the program's laboratory development phase and achieved acceptance for field trials. Ground-based field testing will assess its effects against rockets, mortars, vehicles, and surrogate [[surface-to-air missile]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2015-05-21-2 "HELLADS Laser Achieves Acceptance For Field Testing"], DARPA, 21 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

HELLADS was to be tested during summer 2015 at White Sands. General Atomics has also proposed its Gen 3 HEL to the Navy after an ONR solicitation for a 150 kW laser weapon suitable for installation on [[Arleigh Burke-class destroyer|''Arleigh Burke''-class destroyers]], to be tested in 2018. The company has displayed the laser as a Tactical Laser Weapon Module which includes high-power-density lithium-ion batteries, liquid cooling, one or more laser unit cells, and optics to clean up and stabilize the beam before it enters the beam-director telescope; a unit cell produces a 75 kW beam, and modules can be combined to create beams of 150-300 kW in power with no beam combining like low-power fiber lasers. General Atomics also plans to offer the Gen 3 to the [[U.S. Army]] for their High Energy Laser Mobile Demonstrator (HEL-MD) when its power levels increase to 120 kW in the early 2020s.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Warwick, [http://aviationweek.com/technology/general-atomics-third-gen-electric-laser-weapon-now-ready "General Atomics: Third-Gen Electric Laser Weapon Now Ready"], ''Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology'', 20 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Here the structure is shown partly deployed with the rigid structural shape on the bottom and the coiled stowed shape on the top.]] --&gt;

'''High Strain Composite Structures (HSC Structures)''' are a class of [[composite material]] structures designed to perform in a high [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]] setting.  High strain composite structures transition from one shape to another upon the application of external forces.  A single HSC Structure component is designed to transition between at least two, but often more, dramatically different shapes.  At least one of the shapes is designed to function as a structure which can support external [[Structural load|loads]].

High strain composite structures usually consist of [[Fiber-reinforced plastic|fiber-reinforced polymers]] (FRP), which are designed to undergo relatively high material strain levels under the course of normal operating conditions in comparison to most FRP structural applications.  FRP materials are [[anisotropic]] and highly tailor-able which allows for unique effects upon deformation.  As a result, many HSC Structures are configured to possess one or more stable states (shapes at which the structure will remain without external constraints) which are tuned for a particular application.  HSC Structures with multiple stable states can also be classified as [[Bistable structure|bi-stable structures]].

HSC Structures are most often used in applications where low weight structures are desired that can also be stowed in a small volume.  Flexible composite structures are used within the aerospace industry for [[Deployable structure|deployable mechanisms]] such antennas or solar arrays on spacecraft.  Other applications focus on materials or structures in which multiple stable configurations are required.

== History ==
Metals commonly used in [[spring (device)|springs]] (e.g. high strength steel, aluminum and [[beryllium copper]] alloys) have been utilized in deformable aerospace structures for several decades with considerable success.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northropgrumman.com/BusinessVentures/AstroAerospace/Products/Documents/pageDocs/STEM_Hardware_Programs.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; They continue to be used in the majority of high strain deployable structure applications and excel where the greatest compaction ratios and [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|electrical conductivity]] are required. But metals suffer from having high densities, high coefficients of [[thermal expansion]], and lower strain capacities when compared to composite materials.  In recent decades, the increasing need for high performance deployable structures, coupled with the emergence of a robust [[composite material]]s industry, has increased the demand and utility for High Strain Composites Structures.  Today HSCs are used in a variety of niche aerospace applications, mostly in areas where extreme precision and low mass are required.

In early 2014 the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]] [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics#Technical committees|Spacecraft Structures Technical Committee]] recognized that the level of active research and development in High Strain Composites warranted an independent focus group&lt;ref&gt;https://info.aiaa.org/tac/adsg/SCSTC/Wiki/Home.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish high strain composites as a technical area with uniquely identifiable challenges, technologies, mechanics, test methods, and applications. The High Strains Composite Technical Subcommittee was formed to provide a forum and framework to support HSC technical challenges and successes, and will promote continued advances in the field.

== Space-Flight Heritage ==
The use of high strain [[deployable structure]]s dates back to the pioneering days of space exploration and has played a crucial role in enabling a robust spacefaring industry.

[[Image:Louisville-slugger-logo.jpg|thumb|The Louisville Slugger brand is made by Hillerich &amp; Bradsby]]

'''Hillerich &amp; Bradsby Company''' (H&amp;B) is a company located in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] that produces the famous '''Louisville Slugger''' [[baseball bat]]. The [[Louisville Slugger Museum &amp; Factory]] in downtown Louisville features a retrospective of the product and its use throughout baseball history. H&amp;B also makes [[baseball glove]]s, [[golf club (equipment)|golf club]]s, [[golf]] gloves and other equipment (under the ''PowerBilt'' brand).

In 2015, the company announced plans on March 23 to sell its Louisville Slugger division to sporting goods manufacturer [[Wilson Sporting Goods]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schneider|first1=Grace|title=Iconic bat maker Louisville Slugger sold|url=http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2015/03/23/wilson-sporting-goods-buys-louisville-slugger/25219147/|accessdate=March 24, 2015|work=[[The Courier-Journal]]|date=March 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Louisville Slugger exterior.jpg|left|thumb|The "Largest Bat in the World" outside the [[Louisville Slugger Museum &amp; Factory]]]]
J. F. Hillerich opened his woodworking shop in Louisville in 1855. During the 1880s, Hillerich hired his seventeen-year-old son, [[Bud Hillerich|John "Bud" Hillerich]]. Legend has it that Bud, who played [[baseball]] himself, slipped away from work one afternoon in {{baseball year|1884}} to watch Louisville's [[Major League Baseball|major league team]], the [[Louisville Eclipse]]. The team's star, [[Pete Browning|Pete "Louisville Slugger" Browning]], mired in a hitting slump, broke his bat.

Bud invited Browning to his father's shop to hand-craft him a new bat to his own specifications. Browning accepted the offer, and got three hits to immediately break out of his slump with his new bat the first day he used it. Browning told his teammates, which began a surge of professional ball players to the Hillerich woodworking shop.

J. F. Hillerich was uninterested in making bats; he saw the company future in stair railings, porch columns and swinging butter churns. In fact, for a brief time in the 1880s, he even turned away ball players. Bud, however, saw the potential in producing baseball bats, and the elder Hillerich eventually relented to his son.

The bats were sold under the name "Falls City Slugger" until Bud Hillerich took over his father's company in {{baseball year|1894}}, and the name "Louisville Slugger" was registered with the U.S. Patent Office. In {{baseball year|1905}}, [[Honus Wagner]] signed a deal with the company, becoming the first baseball player to officially endorse a bat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Surowiecki |first=James |url=http://www.newyorker.com/talk/financial/2009/12/21/091221ta_talk_surowiecki |title=The Tiger Woods scandal and celebrity endorsements |work=The New Yorker |date=December 21, 2009 |accessdate=September 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Bradsby, a salesman, became a partner in {{baseball year|1916}}, and the company's name changed to '''Hillerich and Bradsby'''. By {{baseball year|1923}}, H&amp;B was selling more bats than any other bat maker in the country, and legends like [[Ty Cobb]], [[Babe Ruth]] {{nowrap|(R-43),&lt;ref name=bruththn&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-PVLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8O0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5511%2C6126923 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=Babe Ruth changed design of bats to thinner handle |date=March 11, 1979 |page=C5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} and [[Lou Gehrig]] were all using them.

During [[World War II]], the company produced wooden [[rifle]] stocks and [[billy club]]s for the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bedingfield |first=Gary |title=Baseball in World War II |url=http://www.baseballinwartime.com/baseball_in_wwii/baseball_in_wwii.htm |website=Baseball in Wartime |accessdate=July 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, the company purchased Larimer and Norton, Inc., a [[Pennsylvania]] [[lumber]] company to ensure a supply of [[hardwood]] for their products.

In 1976, the company moved across the Ohio River, to [[Jeffersonville, Indiana]], to take advantage of the railroad line there. In the 1990s, the company returned south to Louisville.

==Threat to business==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
Most of Hillerich and Bradsby's wood bats are made from Northern [[Fraxinus americana|white ash]] grown in proprietary forests on the [[New York (state)|New York]]–[[Pennsylvania]] border. Ash trees in the United States are now under attack from the [[emerald ash borer]], an invasive insect species native to Asia and first detected in [[Michigan]] in 2002. While H&amp;B's forests are not yet infested by the beetle, the area being destroyed is growing and moving closer to them. The company is making plans to utilize other woods in the event North America's ash forests are totally destroyed.

==P72 baseball bat==

The P72 model bat was created in 1954 for professional baseball player [[Leslie Wayne Pinkham]].   It became one of baseball's most popular bats.  Baseball Hall of Famers [[Cal Ripken Jr.]] and [[Robin Yount]] are among the players who used the P72 over the years.  [[New York Yankees|New York Yankee]] [[Derek Jeter]] used the P72 for every at bat in his 20 MLB seasons, with over 12,500 plate appearances.    On September 25, 2014, in honor of Jeter's impending retirement, the P72 designation was retired, and the bat was renamed the DJ2 (Jeter wore #2).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/96195366/louisville-slugger174-retires-p72-bat-model-in-honor-of-derek-jeter/|title=Louisville Slugger® retires P72 bat model in honor of Derek Jeter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However descendants of Les Pinkam will still be allowed to get the bat with its P72 designation.

In addition to retiring the P72 model number, Louisville Slugger also promised to give the final 72 P72 bats produced to Jeter to raise funds for his Turn 2 Foundation.

==Branches of the company==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
There are three branches of Hillerich &amp; Bradsby:  Louisville Slugger, [[Bionic Gloves]], and [[Powerbilt Golf]].  Bionic Gloves were designed by a leading orthopedic surgeon, and are used in many sports and recreational activities.  Currently, there are 11 types of gloves: Golf, Gardening, Tennis, Fitness, Equestrian, Driving, Dress, Motorcycle, Racquetball, Baseball, and Drummer gloves.  Powerbilt Golf produces many types of golf clubs.  They recently introduced clubs that feature nitrogen charged technology.

==Sponsorship==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
Besides its products, H&amp;B attaches the Louisville Slugger name to other entities as a sponsor. The [[Cincinnati Reds]]' [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple A]] affiliate, the [[Louisville Bats]], play at [[Louisville Slugger Field]] in downtown Louisville. The Louisville Slugger name is also attached to awards for top power-hitters at both the high school and [[college baseball|college]] levels, and the [[Silver Slugger Award]] given annually to the [[Major League Baseball]] [[baseball positions|player]] with the best offensive output in each position. The Louisville Slugger Batting Champion award is given to the [[American Legion Baseball#Awards|American Legion]] "player with the highest batting average during national competition."

{{this|the area of frequent tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic Ocean|other areas of frequent tropical cyclone activity|Tropical cyclogenesis}}
'''Hurricane Alley''' is an area of warm water in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] stretching from the west coast of [[northern Africa]] to the east coast of [[Central America]] and [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] of the [[Southern United States]]. Many [[hurricane]]s form within this area.  The [[sea surface temperature]] of the Atlantic in Hurricane Alley has grown slightly warmer over the past decades&lt;ref name=alleyheatsup&gt;{{cite web|title=Hurricane Alley Heats Up|url=http://www.livescience.com/723-hurricane-alley-heats.html|publisher=LiveScience|accessdate=9 September 2008|author=Goudzari, Sara|date=May 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A particularly warm summer in 2005 led [[List of climate scientists|climate scientists]] to begin studying whether this trend would lead to an increase in [[tropical cyclone|hurricane]] activity.&lt;ref name=earthobs&gt;{{cite web|title=Hurricane Alley Heats Up|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=5742|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|accessdate=9 September 2008|date=August 9, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; See Effects of Climate Change below. 

==How hurricanes form==
{{main|Tropical cyclogenesis}}
[[File:Hurricane Alley.jpg|right|thumb|The warm waters of Hurricane Alley are depicted in orange]]

Hurricanes form over [[tropical]] waters in areas of high humidity, light winds, and warm sea surface temperatures. These areas which were described above are usually between the latitudes of 8° and 20° north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Hurricanes/|title=Hurricanes: The Greatest Storms on Earth|author1=Steve Graham|author2=Holli Riebeek|date=1 November 2006|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perfect temperature for a hurricane is approximately 26&amp;nbsp;°C. This temperature has been set as a standard. If the water is colder the hurricane will most likely weaken, but if the waters are warmer rapid growth can occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/HurricaneHeart/heart_2.php|title = Seeing into the Heart of a Hurricane|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Earth Observatory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area between 10° and 20°N create the most hurricanes in a given season because of the warmer temperatures. Hurricanes do not form outside this range because the [[Coriolis effect]] is not strong enough to create the tight circulation needed and above this range the temperatures are too cool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.srh.noaa.gov/srh/jetstream/tropics/tc.htm|title = NWS JetStream - Tropical Cyclone Introduction|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = National Weather Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; The waters are only at the necessary temperatures from July until Mid-October. In the Atlantic this is the height of the [[Atlantic hurricane season|season]]. 

Since hurricanes rely on [[sea surface temperature]], sometimes an active season in the beginning becomes quiet later. This is because the hurricanes are so strong that they churn the waters and bring colder waters up from the deep. This creates an area of the sea the size of the hurricane, which has cooler waters, which can be 5-10&amp;nbsp;°C lower than before the hurricane. When a new hurricane moves over the cooler waters they have no fuel to continue to thrive, so they weaken or even die out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/HurricaneHeart/heart_5.php|title = Seeing into the Heart of a Hurricane|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Earth Observatory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of climate change==
The relationship of "hurricane alley" to [[climate change]] is unclear. Recent scientific evidence suggests that hurricane intensity may be increasing due to warmer tropical sea surface temperature, but the connection to Atlantic hurricane frequency is less conclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.hurricanescience.org/science/science/climate/|title = Hurricanes and Climate|date = |accessdate = |website = Hurricanes: Science and Society|publisher = University of Rhode Island}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a debate as to whether climate change is causing more severe storms, but more research is needed into hurricane dynamics.

== Historical trends ==
According to an [[Azores High]] hypothesis of geographer Kam-biu Liu, an anti-phase pattern is expected to exist between the [[Gulf of Mexico]] coast and the [[Atlantic Seaboard|North American Atlantic coast]]. During the quiescent periods (3000–1400 BC, and 1000 AD to present), a more northeasterly position of the Azores High would result in more hurricanes being steered towards the Atlantic coast. During the hyperactive period (1400 BC to 1000 AD), more hurricanes were steered towards the Gulf coast as the Azores High was shifted to a more southwesterly position near the Caribbean.&lt;ref name="Liu1999"&gt;{{cite conference |first=Kam-biu |last=Liu |authorlink= |title=Millennial-scale variability in catastrophic hurricane landfalls along the Gulf of Mexico coast |conference=23d Conf. on Hurricanes and Tropical Meteorology |publisher=Amer. Meteor. Soc. |date=1999 |location=Dallas, TX |url= |pages=374–377 |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LiuFearn2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Liu |first=Kam-biu |authorlink= |author2=Fearn, Miriam L. |year=2000 |title=Reconstruction of Prehistoric Landfall Frequencies of Catastrophic Hurricanes in Northwestern Florida from Lake Sediment Records |journal=Quaternary Research |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=238–245 |doi=10.1006/qres.2000.2166 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode=2000QuRes..54..238L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a displacement of the Azores High is consistent with paleoclimatic evidence that shows an abrupt onset of a drier climate in [[Haiti]] around 3200 years BP,&lt;ref name="Higuera-Gundy1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Higuera-Gundy |first=Antonia |authorlink= |year=1999 |title=A 10,300 &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C yr Record of Climate and Vegetation Change from Haiti |journal=Quaternary Research |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=159–170 |doi=10.1006/qres.1999.2062  |url= |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode=1999QuRes..52..159H|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a change towards more humid conditions in the [[Great Plains]] during the late-[[Holocene]] as more moisture was pumped up the [[Mississippi Valley]] through the Gulf coast. Preliminary data from the northern Atlantic coast seem to support the Azores High hypothesis. A 3,000-year proxy record from a coastal lake in [[Cape Cod]] suggests that hurricane activity has increased significantly during the past 500–1,000 years, just as the Gulf coast was amid a quiescent period of the last millennium.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

This particular diagram illustrates possible engine cutoff locations, after the [[Sinking of the RMS Lusitania|''Lusitania'' disaster]] and others made it clear that this was an important safety feature.]]
A '''marine steam engine''' is a [[steam engine]] that is [[marine propulsion|used to power a ship or boat]]. This article deals mainly with marine steam engines of the [[reciprocating engine|reciprocating]] type, which were in use from the inception of the [[steamboat]] in the early 19th century to their last years of large-scale manufacture during [[World War II]]. Reciprocating steam engines were progressively replaced in marine applications during the 20th century by [[steam turbines]] and [[marine diesel engine]]s.

==History==
The first commercially successful steam engine was developed by [[Thomas Newcomen]] in 1712. The steam engine improvements brought forth by James Watt in the later half of the 18th century greatly improved steam engine efficiency and allowed more compact engine arrangements. Successful adaptation of the steam engine to marine applications in England would have to wait until almost a century later after Newcomen, when [[Scotland|Scottish]] engineer [[William Symington]] built the world's "first practical [[steamboat]]", the ''[[Charlotte Dundas]]'', in 1802.&lt;ref&gt;Fry, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1807, the American [[Robert Fulton]] built the world's first commercially successful steamboat, simply known as the ''[[North River Steamboat]]'', and powered by a Watt engine.

Following Fulton's success, steamboat technology developed rapidly on both sides of the [[Atlantic]]. Steamboats initially had a short range and were not particularly seaworthy due to their weight, low power, and tendency to break down, but they were employed successfully along rivers and canals, and for short journeys along the coast. The first successful transatlantic crossing by a steamship occurred in 1819 when {{SS|Savannah||2}} sailed from [[Savannah, Georgia]] to [[Liverpool, England]]. The first steamship to make regular transatlantic crossings was the [[sidewheel steamer]] {{SS|Great Western||2}} in 1838.&lt;ref&gt;Fry, pp. 37-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the 19th century progressed, marine steam engines and steamship technology developed alongside each other. [[Paddle steamer|Paddle propulsion]] gradually gave way to the [[screw propeller]], and the introduction of iron and later steel hulls to replace the traditional wooden hull allowed ships to grow ever larger, necessitating steam power plants that were increasingly complex and powerful.&lt;ref&gt;Fry, Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of marine steam engine==

A wide variety of reciprocating marine steam engines were developed over the course of the 19th century. The two main methods of classifying such engines are by ''connection mechanism'' and ''cylinder technology''.

Most early marine engines had the same cylinder technology (simple expansion, see below) but a number of different methods of supplying power to the [[crankshaft]] (i.e. connection mechanism) were in use. Thus, early marine engines are classified mostly according to their connection mechanism. Some common connection mechanisms were side-lever, steeple, walking beam and direct-acting (see following sections).

However, steam engines can also be classified according to cylinder technology (simple-expansion, compound, annular etc.). One can therefore find examples of engines classified under both methods. An engine can be a compound walking beam type, ''compound'' being the cylinder technology, and ''walking beam'' being the connection method. Over time, as most engines became direct-acting but cylinder technologies grew more complex, people began to classify engines solely according to cylinder technology.

More commonly encountered marine steam engine types are listed in the following sections. Note that not all these terms are exclusive to marine applications.

==Engines classified by connection mechanism==

===Side-lever===

The side-lever engine was the first type of steam engine widely adopted for marine use in [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=sennettoram_p2-4&gt;Sennett and Oram, pp. 2-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=murray_p4/&gt; In the early years of steam navigation (from c1815), the side-lever was the most common type of marine engine for inland waterway and coastal service in Europe, and it remained for many years the preferred engine for oceangoing service on both sides of the [[Atlantic]].&lt;ref name=fox_p119&gt;Fox, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

The side-lever was an adaptation of the earliest form of steam engine, the [[beam engine]]. The typical side-lever engine had a pair of heavy horizontal iron beams, known as side levers, that connected in the centre to the bottom of the engine with a pin. This connection allowed a limited arc for the levers to pivot in. These levers extended, on the cylinder side, to each side of the bottom of the vertical engine cylinder. A piston rod, connected vertically to the piston, extended out of the top of the cylinder. This rod attached to a horizontal crosshead, connected at each end to vertical rods (known as side-rods). These rods connected down to the levers on each side of the cylinder. This formed the connection of the levers to the piston on the cylinder side of the engine. The other side of the levers (the opposite end of the lever pivot to the cylinder) were connected to each other with a horizontal crosstail. This crosstail in turn connected to and operated a single [[connecting rod]], which turned the [[crankshaft]]. The rotation of the crankshaft was driven by the levers—which, at the cylinder side, were driven by the piston's vertical oscillation.&lt;ref name=sennetoram_p2-4&gt;Sennett and Oram, p. 2-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main disadvantage of the side-lever engine was that it was large and heavy.&lt;ref name=murray_p4&gt;Murray, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; For inland waterway and coastal service, lighter and more efficient designs soon replaced it. It remained the dominant engine type for oceangoing service through much of the first half of the 19th century however, due to its relatively low [[centre of gravity]], which gave ships more stability in heavy seas.&lt;ref name=fox_p119/&gt; It was also a common early engine type for warships,&lt;ref name=sennettoram_p3&gt;Sennet and Oram, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; since its relatively low height made it less susceptible to battle damage. From the first Royal Navy steam vessel in 1820 until 1840, 70 steam vessels entered service, the majority with side-lever engines, using boilers set to 4psi maximum pressure.&lt;ref name=sennettoram_p3/&gt; The low steam pressures dictated the large cylinder sizes for the side-lever engines, though the effective pressure on the piston was the difference between the boiler pressure and the vacuum in the condenser.

The side-lever engine was a [[paddlewheel]] engine and was not suitable for driving [[propeller|screw propellers]]. The last ship built for [[Transatlantic crossing|transatlantic]] service that had a side-lever engine was the [[Cunard Line]]'s paddle steamer {{RMS|Scotia}}, considered an anachronism when it entered service in 1862.&lt;ref name=maginnis_pxiv&gt;Maginnis, p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grasshopper===
[[File:Marine grasshopper engine.jpg|thumb|Diagram of a grasshopper engine]]

The '''grasshopper''' or 'half-lever'&lt;ref name="Rippon, 1998" &gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; engine was a variant of the side-lever engine. The grasshopper engine differs from the conventional side-lever in that the location of the lever pivot and connecting rod are more or less reversed, with the pivot located at one end of the lever instead of the centre, while the connecting rod is attached to the lever between the cylinder at one end and the pivot at the other.&lt;ref name=seaton_pp3-5&gt;Seaton, pp. 3-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chief advantages of the grasshopper engine were cheapness of construction and robustness, with the type said to require less maintenance than any other type of marine steam engine. Another advantage is that the engine could be easily started from any crank position. Like the conventional side-lever engine however, grasshopper engines were disadvantaged by their weight and size. They were mainly used in small watercraft such as [[riverboat]]s and [[tugboat|tugs]].&lt;ref name=seaton_pp3-5/&gt;

===Crosshead (square)===

The crosshead engine, also known as a '''square''', '''sawmill''' or '''A-frame''' engine, was a type of paddlewheel engine used in the United States. It was the most common type of engine in the early years of American steam navigation.&lt;ref name=hilton_p59&gt;Hilton, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The crosshead engine is described as having a vertical cylinder above the crankshaft, with the piston rod secured to a horizontal crosshead, from each end of which, on opposite sides of the cylinder, extended a connecting rod that rotated its own separate crankshaft.&lt;ref name=ward_p60&gt;Ward, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; The crosshead moved within vertical guides so that the assembly maintained the correct path as it moved.&lt;ref name=laxton_p334&gt;Laxton, p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt; The engine's alternative name—"A-frame"—presumably derived from the shape of the frames that supported these guides. Some crosshead engines had more than one cylinder, in which case the piston rods were usually all connected to the same crosshead. An unusual feature of early examples of this type of engine was the installation of [[flywheel]]s—geared to the crankshafts—which were thought necessary to ensure smooth operation. These gears were often noisy in operation.

Because the cylinder was above the crankshaft in this type of engine, it had a high center of gravity, and was therefore deemed unsuitable for oceangoing service.&lt;ref name=adams_p202&gt;Adams, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; This largely confined it to vessels built for inland waterways.&lt;ref name=ward_p60/&gt; As marine engines grew steadily larger and heavier through the 19th century, the high center of gravity of square crosshead engines became increasingly impractical, and by the 1840s, ship builders abandoned them  in favor of the walking beam engine.&lt;ref name=harvey_p55&gt;Harvey, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of this engine can cause confusion, as "crosshead" is also an alternative name for the steeple engine (below). Many sources thus prefer to refer to it by its informal name of "square" engine to avoid confusion. Additionally, the marine crosshead or square engine described in this section should not be confused with the term "[[Stroke ratio|square engine]]" as applied to [[internal combustion engine]]s, which in the latter case refers to an engine whose [[bore (engine)|bore]] is equal to its [[stroke (engine)|stroke]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Walking beam===

The walking beam, also known as a "vertical beam", "overhead beam", or simply "beam", was another early adaptation of the beam engine, but its use was confined almost entirely to the United States.&lt;ref name=thurston379&gt;Thurston, p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt; After its introduction, the walking beam quickly became the most popular engine type in America for inland waterway and coastal service, and the type proved to have remarkable longevity, with walking beam engines still being occasionally manufactured as late as the 1940s. In marine applications, the beam itself was generally reinforced with iron struts that gave it a characteristic diamond shape, although the supports on which the beam rested were often built of wood. The adjective "walking" was applied because the beam, which rose high above the ship's deck, could be seen operating, and its rocking motion was (somewhat fancifully) likened to a walking motion.

Walking beam engines were a type of paddlewheel engine and were rarely used for powering propellers. They were used primarily for ships and boats working in rivers, lakes and along  the coastline, but were a less popular choice for seagoing vessels because the great height of the engine made the vessel less stable in heavy seas.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; They were also of limited use militarily, because the engine was exposed to enemy fire and could thus be easily disabled. Their popularity in the United States was due primarily to the fact that the walking beam engine was well suited for the shallow-[[draft (hull)|draft]] boats that operated in America's shallow coastal and inland waterways.&lt;ref name=thurston379/&gt;

Walking beam engines remained popular with American shipping lines and excursion operations right into the early 20th century. Although the walking beam engine was technically obsolete in the later 19th century, it remained popular with excursion steamer passengers who expected to see the "walking beam" in motion. There were also technical reasons for retaining the walking beam engine in America, as it was easier to build, requiring less precision in its construction.  Wood could be used for the main frame of the engine, at a much lower cost than typical practice of using iron castings for more modern engine designs. Fuel was also much cheaper in America than in Europe, so the lower efficiency of the walking beam engine was less of a consideration. The [[Philadelphia]] shipbuilder Charles H. [[Cramp Shipbuilding|Cramp]] blamed America's general lack of competitiveness with the British shipbuilding industry in the mid-to-late 19th century upon the conservatism of American domestic shipbuilders and shipping line owners, who doggedly clung to outdated technologies like the walking beam and its associated paddlewheel long after they had been abandoned in other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Buell, pp. 92-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Steeple===
[[File:Steeple engine.jpg|thumb|upright|Steeple engine]]
The steeple engine, sometimes referred to as a "crosshead" engine, was an early attempt to break away from the beam concept common to both the walking beam and side-lever types, and come up with a smaller, lighter, more efficient design. In a steeple engine, the vertical oscillation of the piston is not converted to a horizontal rocking motion as in a beam engine, but is instead used to move an assembly, composed of a crosshead and two rods, through a vertical guide at the top of the engine, which in turn rotates the crankshaft connecting rod below.&lt;ref&gt;Hebert.&lt;/ref&gt; In early examples of the type, the crosshead assembly was rectangular in shape, but over time it was refined into an elongated triangle. The triangular assembly above the engine cylinder gives the engine its characteristic "steeple" shape, hence the name.

Steeple engines were tall like walking beam engines, but much narrower laterally, saving both space and weight. Because of their height and high centre of gravity, they were, like walking beams, considered less appropriate for oceangoing service, but they remained highly popular for several decades, especially in Europe, for inland waterway and coastal vessels.&lt;ref name=evers88&gt;Evers, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Steeple engines began to appear in steamships in the 1830s and the type was perfected in the early 1840s by the Scottish shipbuilder [[David Napier (marine engineer)|David Napier]].&lt;ref name=dumpleton83&gt;Dumpleton, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; The steeple engine was gradually superseded by the various types of direct-acting engine.

===Siamese===

The Siamese engine, also referred to as the "double cylinder" or "twin cylinder" engine, was another early alternative to the beam or side-lever engine. This type of engine had two identical, vertical engine cylinders arranged side-by-side, whose piston rods were attached to a common, T-shaped crosshead. The vertical arm of the crosshead extended down between the two cylinders and was attached at the bottom to both the crankshaft connecting rod and to a guide block that slid between the vertical sides of the cylinders, enabling the assembly to maintain the correct path as it moved.&lt;ref name=evers89&gt;Evers, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Siamese engine was invented by British engineer Joseph Maudslay (son of [[Henry Maudslay|Henry]]), but although he invented it after his oscillating engine (see below), it failed to achieve the same widespread acceptance, as it was only marginally smaller and lighter than the side-lever engines it was designed to replace.&lt;ref name=murray_p14/&gt; It was however used on a number of mid-century warships, including the first warship fitted with a screw propeller, {{HMS|Rattler|1843|6}}.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Direct acting===

There are two definitions of a direct-acting engine encountered in 19th-century literature. The earlier definition applies the term "direct-acting" to any type of engine other than a beam (i.e. walking beam, side-lever or grasshopper) engine. The later definition only uses the term for engines that apply power directly to the crankshaft via the piston rod and/or connecting rod.&lt;ref name=sennettoram_p12_note&gt;Sennett and Oram, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Unless otherwise noted, this article uses the later definition.

Unlike the side-lever or beam engine, a direct-acting engine could be readily adapted to power either paddlewheels or a propeller. As well as offering a lower profile, direct-acting engines had the advantage of being smaller and weighing considerably less than beam or side-lever engines. The [[Royal Navy]] found that on average a direct-acting engine (early definition) weighed 40% less and required an engine room only two thirds the size of that for a side-lever of equivalent power. One disadvantage of such engines is that they were more prone to wear and tear and thus required more maintenance.&lt;ref name=murray_p14&gt;Murray, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oscillating===
{{main|Oscillating cylinder steam engine}}
An oscillating engine was a type of direct-acting engine that was designed to achieve further reductions in engine size and weight. Oscillating engines had the piston rods connected directly to the crankshaft, dispensing with the need for connecting rods. To achieve this, the engine cylinders were not immobile as in most engines, but secured in the middle by trunnions that let the cylinders themselves pivot back and forth as the crankshaft rotated—hence the term, ''oscillating''.&lt;ref name=chatterton132&gt;Chatterton, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Steam was supplied and exhausted through the trunnions. The oscillating motion of the cylinder was usually used to line up ports in the trunnions to direct the steam feed and exhaust to the cylinder at the correct times. However, separate valves were often provided, controlled by the oscillating motion. This let the timing be varied to enable expansive working (as in the engine in the paddle ship PD ''Krippen''). This provides simplicity but still retains the advantages of compactness.

The first patented oscillating engine was built by Joseph Maudslay in 1827, but the type is considered to have been perfected by [[John Penn (engineer)|John Penn]]. Oscillating engines remained a popular type of marine engine for much of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=chatterton132/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Trunk===

The trunk engine, another type of direct-acting engine, was originally developed as a means of reducing an engine's height while retaining a long [[stroke (engine)|stroke]]. (A long stroke was considered important at this time because it reduced the strain on components.)

A trunk engine locates the connecting rod ''within'' a large-diameter hollow piston rod.  This "trunk" carries almost no load.  The interior of the trunk is open to outside air, and is wide enough to accommodate the side-to-side motion of the connecting rod, which links a [[gudgeon pin]] at the piston head to an outside crankshaft.

The walls of the trunk were either bolted to the piston or cast as one piece with it, and moved back and forth with it. The working portion of the cylinder is annular or ring-shaped, with the trunk passing through the centre of the cylinder itself.&lt;ref name=evers_pp90-91&gt;Evers, pp. 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sennettoram_pp7-8&gt;Sennett and Oram, pp. 7–8. See also the preceding section in this reference, entitled "Horizontal engines".&lt;/ref&gt;

Early examples of trunk engines had vertical cylinders. However, ship builders quickly realized that the type was compact enough to lay horizontally across the [[keel]]. In this configuration, it was very useful to navies, as it had a profile low enough to fit entirely below a ship's [[waterline]], as safe as possible from enemy fire. The type was generally produced for military service by John Penn.

Trunk engines were common on mid-19th century warships.&lt;ref name=sennettoram_pp7-8/&gt; They also powered commercial vessels, where—though valued for their compact size and low centre of gravity—they were expensive to operate. Trunk engines, however, did not work well with the higher [[boiler]] pressures that became prevalent in the latter half of the 19th century, and builders abandoned them for other solutions.&lt;ref name=sennettoram_pp7-8/&gt;

Trunk engines were normally large, but a small, mass-produced, high-revolution, high-pressure version  was  produced for the Crimean War. In being quite effective,  the type persisted in later gunboats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Osbon |first=G. A. |year=1965 |title=The Crimean gunboats.

===Vibrating lever===
[[File:USS Monadnock (1863) vibrating-lever engine.jpg|thumb|Vibrating-lever engine of {{USS|Monadnock|1863}} - front view]]
The vibrating lever, or '''half-trunk''' engine, was a development of the conventional trunk engine conceived by [[Sweden|Swedish]]-[[United States|American]] engineer [[John Ericsson]]. Ericsson needed a small, low-profile engine like the trunk engine to power the U.S. Federal government's [[monitor (warship)|monitors]], a type of warship developed during the [[American Civil War]] that had very little space for a conventional powerplant.&lt;ref name=artemisengine/&gt; The trunk engine itself was, however, unsuitable for this purpose, because the preponderance of weight was on the side of the engine that contaied the cylinder and trunk—a problem that designers could compensate for on the small monitor warships.

}}
Ericsson resolved this problem by placing two horizontal cylinders back-to-back in the middle of the engine, working two "vibrating levers", one on each side, which by means of shafts and additional levers rotated a centrally located crankshaft.&lt;ref name=artemisengine&gt;[http://www.pcez.com/~artemis/SLAengine.htm Steam Launch Artemis - Engine], ''www.pcez.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; Vibrating lever engines were later used in some other warships and merchant vessels, but their use was confined to ships built in the United States and in Ericsson's native country of Sweden,&lt;ref name=emoryrice4/&gt; and as they had few advantages over more conventional engines, were soon supplanted by other types.

===Back acting===

The back-acting engine, also known as the '''[[return connecting rod engine]]''', was another engine designed to have a very low profile. The back-acting engine was in effect a modified steeple engine, laid horizontally across the keel of a ship rather than standing vertically above it.&lt;ref name=emoryrice4&gt;[http://files.asme.org/ASMEORG/Communities/History/Landmarks/5539.pdf "Emory Rice T. V. Engine (1873)"], American Society of Mechanical Engineers, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of the triangular crosshead assembly found in a typical steeple engine however, the back-acting engine generally used a set of two or more elongated, parallel piston rods terminating in a crosshead to perform the same function. The term "back-acting" or "return connecting rod" derives from the fact that the connecting rod "returns" or comes back from the side of the engine opposite the engine cylinder to rotate a centrally located crankshaft.&lt;ref name=sennettoram_pp7,9&gt;Sennett and Oram, pp. 7,9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Back-acting engines were another type of engine popular in both warships and commercial vessels in the mid-19th century, but like many other engine types in this era of rapidly changing technology, they were eventually abandoned for other solutions. There is only one known surviving back-acting engine—that of the TV ''Emery Rice'' (formerly {{USS|Ranger|1876|6}}), now the centerpiece of a display at the [[American Merchant Marine Museum]].&lt;ref name=emeryrice_p6&gt;[http://files.asme.org/ASMEORG/Communities/History/Landmarks/5539.pdf Emery Rice T. V.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Vertical===

As steamships grew steadily in size and tonnage through the course of the 19th century, the need for low profile, low centre-of-gravity engines correspondingly declined. Freed increasingly from these design constraints, engineers were able to revert to simpler, more efficient and more easily maintained designs. The result was the growing dominance of the so-called "vertical" engine&lt;ref name=sennettoram_p12_note/&gt; (more correctly known as the '''vertical inverted direct acting''' engine).

In this type of engine, the cylinders are located directly above the crankshaft, with the piston rod/connecting rod assemblies forming a more or less straight line between the two.&lt;ref name=sennettoram_p12_note/&gt; The configuration is similar to that of a modern internal combustion engine (one notable difference being that the steam engine is double acting, see below, whereas almost all internal combustion engines generate power only in the downward stroke). Vertical engines are sometimes referred to as "hammer", "forge hammer" or "steam hammer" engines, due to their roughly similar appearance to another common 19th-century steam technology, the [[steam hammer]].&lt;ref name=evers81&gt;Evers, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vertical engines came to supersede almost every other type of marine steam engine toward the close of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=sennettoram_p12_note/&gt;&lt;ref name=evers81/&gt; Because they became so common, vertical engines are not usually referred to as such, but are instead referred to based upon their cylinder technology, i.e. as compound, triple-expansion, quadruple-expansion etc. It should be noted that the term "vertical" for this type of engine is imprecise, since technically any type of steam engine is "vertical" if the cylinder is vertically oriented. An engine someone describes as "vertical" might not be of the vertical inverted direct-acting type, unless they use the term "vertical" without qualification.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Engines classified by cylinder technology==

===Simple expansion===

A simple-expansion engine is a steam engine that expands the steam through only one stage, which is to say, all its cylinders are operated at the same pressure. Since this was by far the most common type of engine in the early period of marine engine development, the term "simple expansion" is rarely encountered. An engine is assumed to be simple-expansion unless otherwise stated.

===Compound===

A [[compound engine]] is a steam engine that operates cylinders through more than one stage, at different pressure levels. Compound engines were a method of improving efficiency. Until the development of compound engines, steam engines used the steam only once before they recycled it back to the boiler. A compound engine recycles the steam into one or more larger, lower-pressure second cylinders first, to use more of its heat energy. Compound engines could be configured to either increase a ship's economy or its speed. Broadly speaking, a compound engine can refer to a steam engine with any number of different-pressure cylinders—however, the term usually refers to engines that expand steam through only two stages, i.e., those that operate cylinders at only two different pressures (or "double-expansion" engines).&lt;ref name=thurston391-396&gt;Thurston, 391-396.&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that a compound engine (including multiple-expansion engines, see below) can have more than one ''set'' of variable-pressure cylinders. For example, an engine might have two cylinders operating at pressure x and two operating at pressure y, or one cylinder operating at pressure x and three operating at pressure y. What makes it compound (or double-expansion) as opposed to multiple-expansion is that there are only two ''pressures'', x and y.&lt;ref name=frychapterxi/&gt;

The first compound engine believed to have been installed in a ship was that fitted to [[Henry Eckford (1824)|''Henry Eckford'']] by the American engineer James P. Allaire in 1824. However, many sources attribute the "invention" of the marine compound engine to [[Glasgow]]'s [[John Elder (shipbuilder)|John Elder]] in the 1850s. Elder made improvements to the compound engine that made it safe and economical for ocean-crossing voyages for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;MacLehose, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thurston, pp. 393-396.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Triple or multiple expansion===

A [[triple-expansion engine]] is a compound engine that expands the steam in three stages—i.e. an engine with three cylinders at three different pressures. A quadruple-expansion engine expands the steam in four stages, and so on.&lt;ref name=frychapterxi&gt;Fry, Chapter XI.&lt;/ref&gt; The first successful commercial use was an engine built at [[Govan]] in [[Scotland]] by [[Alexander Carnegie Kirk|Alexander C. Kirk]] for the [[SS Aberdeen (1881)|SS ''Aberdeen'']] in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;Day, Lance and McNeil, Ian (Editors) 2013, [https://books.google.com/books?id=m8TsygLyfSMC&amp;pg=PA694&amp;lpg=PA694&amp;dq=the+aberdeen+1881+napiers&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fXgwCpa8Kn&amp;sig=A2yIROVbkJhIu-cUFElFlKDg-D4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=428AUqvXGurAyAHLloDAAQ&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20aberdeen%201881%20napiers&amp;f=false ''Biographical Dictionary of the History of Technology''] Routledge, {{ISBN|0-203-02829-5}} (P. 694)&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple-expansion engine manufacture continued well into the 20th century. All 2,700 [[Liberty ship]]s built by the United States during World War II were powered by triple-expansion engines, because the capacity of the US to manufacture marine steam turbines was entirely directed to the building of warships. The biggest manufacturer of triple-expansion engines during the war was the [[Joshua Hendy Iron Works]]. Toward the end of the war, turbine-powered [[Victory ship]]s were manufactured in increasing numbers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.asme.org/ASMEORG/Communities/History/Landmarks/5580.pdf Joshua Hendy Iron Works] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318164053/http://files.asme.org/ASMEORG/Communities/History/Landmarks/5580.pdf |date=2009-03-18 }} - American Society of Mechanical Engineers.&lt;/ref&gt;

The engine is 21 feet (6.4 meters) long and 19 feet (5.8 meters) tall and was designed to operate at 76 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] and propel a Liberty ship at about 11 knots (12.7&amp;nbsp;mph; 20.4&amp;nbsp;km/h).
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Annular===

An annular engine is an unusual type of engine that has an annular (ring-shaped) cylinder.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, pp.15-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of American pioneering engineer [[James P. Allaire]]'s early compound engines were of the annular type, with a smaller, high-pressure cylinder placed in the centre of a larger, ring-shaped low-pressure cylinder.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, pp. 376-377. See engine description for ''Buckeye State''.&lt;/ref&gt; Trunk engines were another type of annular engine. A third type of annular marine engine used the Siamese engine connecting mechanism—but instead of two separate cylinders, it had a single, annular-shaped cylinder wrapped around the vertical arm of the crosshead (see diagram under "Siamese" above).&lt;ref name=murray_pp15-16&gt;Murray, pp. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other terms==

Some other terms are encountered in marine engine literature of the period. These terms, listed below, are usually used in conjunction with one or more of the basic engine classification terms listed above.

===Simple===

A simple engine is an engine that operates with single expansion of steam, regardless of the number of cylinders fitted to the engine.  Up until about the mid-19th century, most ships had engines with only one cylinder, although some vessels had multiple cylinder simple engines, and/or more than one engine.

===Double acting===

A double acting engine is an engine where steam is applied to both sides of the piston. Earlier steam engines applied steam in only one direction, allowing momentum or gravity to return the piston to its starting place, but a double acting engine uses steam to force the piston in both directions, thus increasing rotational speed and power.&lt;ref&gt;Thurston, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the term "simple engine", the term "double acting" is less frequently encountered in the literature since almost all marine engines were of the double acting type.

===Vertical, horizontal, inclined, inverted===

These terms refer to the orientation of the engine cylinder. A vertical cylinder stands vertically with its piston rod operating above (or below) it. A vertical inverted engine is defined as a vertical cylinder arrangement, with the crankshaft mounted directly below the cylinder(s). With an inclined or horizontal type, the cylinder and piston are positioned at an incline or horizontally. An inclined inverted cylinder is an inverted cylinder operating at an incline. These terms are all generally used in conjunction with the engine types above. Thus, one may have a horizontal direct-acting engine, or an inclined compound double acting engine, etc.

Inclined and horizontal cylinders could be very useful in naval vessels as their orientation kept the engine profile as low as possible and thus less susceptible to damage.&lt;ref&gt;Murray. pp. 17-18.&lt;/ref&gt; They could also be used in a low profile ship or to keep a ship's centre of gravity lower. In addition, inclined or horizontal cylinders had the advantage of reducing the amount of vibration by comparison with a vertical cylinder.

===Geared===
A geared engine or "geared screw" turns the propeller at a different rate to that of the engine. Early marine propeller engines were geared upward, which is to say the propeller was geared to run at a higher rotational speed than the engine itself ran at.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fry, pp. 167-168.&lt;/ref&gt; As engines became faster and more powerful through the latter part of the 19th century, gearing was almost universally dispensed with, and the propeller ran at the same rotational speed as the engine.  This direct drive arrangement is mechanically most efficient, and reciprocating steam engines are well suited to the rotational speed most efficient for screw propellers.

National Solar Thermal Test Facility
During the late 1970s, rising fuel costs and the demand for a cleaner environment gave impetus to advance technology which used solar energy to create electricity.  Studies identified the central receiver concept as having high potential to generate electricity on a large scale.  The United States government initiated support through the [[National Science Foundation]] [[Research Applied to National Needs]] (RANN) program in 1972 which was eventually funded by the [[Energy Research and Development Administration]] and the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]].  Six central receiver pilot plants were constructed including the 5 MW (thermal) test facility at [[Sandia National Laboratories]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuntz, Patricia Falcone, Sandia National Laboratories, Livermore, "A Handbook for Solar Central Receiver Design."

This capability directly supports the SunShot goals by providing flux levels of greater than 250 W/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and total power in excess of 6 MWt. Each heliostat has two motors and two drives (one azimuth and one elevation), one 480 V power box, one electronics box, and one control box and associated cabling. The total reflective area on each heliostat is 37 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The reflectivity on the recently replaced facets is 96%.

===Solar tower===
[[Image:NSTTF SolarTower Sandia National Labs.jpg|thumb|right|The [[solar power tower]] field at Sandia National. Labs.]]
The tower is a 61&amp;nbsp;m (200&amp;nbsp;ft) high concrete structure with three test locations on the north side and the top of the tower. The tower can support testing for CSP experiments and large-scale, high-flux materials samples. The equipment in the tower includes a 100-ton capacity elevating module for lifting experiments to the top of the tower, internal cranes for receiver fabrication, water glycol cooling systems and air coolers to provide heat removal from experiments, air compressors, control valves, generators, uninterruptible power supplies, piping systems, and pressure-relief valves.

===Molten salt test loop===
The molten salt test loop directly supports the SunShot goals by providing development for thermal energy storage costs ≤$15/kWhth and by allowing greater collection efficiencies and higher-temperature operation for linear Fresnel and trough systems through utilization of molten salt HTF. The facility also provides a means of performing accelerated lifetime testing on components, thus reducing the risk of the technology. Though operating below 600&amp;nbsp;°C, many of the lessons learned at this facility will be directly applicable to molten salt systems operating in the SunShot temperature range ≥ 650&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energy.sandia.gov/?page_id=11934 |title=Sandia National Laboratories: Molten Salt Test Loop |publisher=Energy.sandia.gov |date=2012-10-08 |accessdate=2012-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218180903/http://energy.sandia.gov/?page_id=11934 |archivedate=2013-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dish test facility===
This area of the site allows industry partners to install full-scale solar dishes for long-term reliability testing and evaluation. There are currently ten dishes from [[Stirling Energy Systems]] and six [[Infinia]] dishes at this location. The site also includes two SNL-developed solar dishes that are available for research. Solar dishes can be used for the high-temperature portions of the SunShot goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energy.sandia.gov/?page_id=11958 |title=Sandia National Laboratories: Dish Test Facility |publisher=Energy.sandia.gov |date=2012-09-26 |accessdate=2012-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218181207/http://energy.sandia.gov/?page_id=11958 |archivedate=2013-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Renewable energy sources}}
The '''Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii Authority''' (NELHA) administers the Hawaii Ocean Science and Technology Park (HOST Park). NELHA was founded in 1974. At {{convert|870|acre}}, HOST Park is perhaps the largest single green economic development project in the world solely devoted to growing a green economy. NELHA also administers a small site, {{convert|4|acre}}, in Puna on the eastern side of the Island of Hawaii for geothermal research. The original mission was for research into the uses of [[Deep ocean water|Deep Ocean Water]] in [[Ocean thermal energy conversion]] (OTEC) [[renewable energy]] production and in [[aquaculture]]. It later added research into sustainable uses of natural energy sources such as [[solar energy]].
Its administration offices are located in the HOST Park [[Keahole Point]] in the [[Kona District, Hawaii|North Kona District]].
The entrance is on the [[Hawaii Belt Road]] at coordinates {{coord|19|42|58|N|156|02|01|W|display=title,inline|region:US-HI_type:landmark}}, just south of the [[Kona International Airport]].  The main administration office is in the 4 acre research campus at the end of the road along the coastline on Keahole Point.

The laboratory was founded in 1974 with {{convert|345|acre}}, associated with the [[University of Hawaii]]. Large pipelines pump cold sea water from a depth of {{convert|3000|ft}}. For three months in 1979, a small amount of electricity was generated. A larger plant was constructed in the &lt;ref name=april2009/&gt; Almost $250M was spent on Ocean thermal energy conversion, but by 1991, the research shifted to other areas. The adjacent Science and Technology Park was merged into the facility, expanding it to {{convert|877|acre}}. A [[neutrino]] detector was partially constructed in the 1990s called [[Project DUMAND]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phys.hawaii.edu/dmnd/dumand.html DUMAND web site] at the University of Hawaii&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, {{convert|50|acre}} were leased to a commercial company which filters and bottles the water for sale in Japan.&lt;ref name=dags&gt;[http://www.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/20090531/BUSINESS13/905310347 Natural Energy Lab ready for fresh start with DAGS] in [[Honolulu Advertiser]], May 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
The pipelines were broken in the October 15, [[2006 Kiholo Bay earthquake|2006 earthquake]], but one of the three has been repaired over two years later.
Makai Ocean Engineering, working with [[Lockheed Martin]], restarted OTEC research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.makai.com/p-otec.htm "Deep Pipelines for Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion"] on Makai Ocean Engineering web site&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aquaculture]], [[biofuel from algae]], [[solar thermal energy]], [[Solar concentrator|solar concentrating]] and [[wind power]] are some of the 40 tenants.&lt;ref name=april2009&gt;[http://www.westhawaiitoday.com/articles/2009/04/26/features/features01.txt Revisiting NELHA ] in [[West Hawaii Today]], April 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Experiment using an electronic neutron generator.jpg|thumb|Nuclear physicist at the [[Idaho National Laboratory]] sets up an experiment using an electronic neutron generator.]]
'''Neutron generators''' are [[neutron source]] devices which contain compact [[linear accelerator]]s and that produce [[neutron]]s by fusing [[isotopes of hydrogen]] together. The [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] reactions take place in these devices by accelerating either [[deuterium]], [[tritium]], or a mixture of these two isotopes into a metal [[hydride]] target which also contains deuterium, tritium or a mixture of these isotopes. Fusion of deuterium atoms (D + D) results in the formation of a He-3 ion and a neutron with a kinetic energy of approximately 2.5&amp;nbsp;[[MeV]]. Fusion of a deuterium and a tritium atom (D + T) results in the formation of a He-4 ion and a neutron with a kinetic energy of approximately 14.1&amp;nbsp;MeV. Neutron generators have applications in medicine, security, and materials analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reijonen|first=J|title=Compact Neutron Generators for Medical, Homeland Security, and Planetary Exploration|journal=Proceedings of 2005 Particle Accelerator Conference, Knoxville, Tennessee|pages=49–53|url=http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/AccelConf/p05/papers/foab001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of such small, relatively inexpensive systems have been built over the past five decades.

==Neutron generator theory and operation==
&lt;!-- Parts of this text, inserted by 119.154.44.9, are based on text from www.thermo.com.  It has been edited and referenced here. --&gt;Small neutron generators using the deuterium (D, hydrogen-2, &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H) tritium (T, hydrogen-3, &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H) fusion reactions are the most common accelerator based (as opposed to radioactive isotopes) neutron sources.  In these systems, neutrons are produced by creating ions of deuterium, tritium, or deuterium and tritium and accelerating these into a hydride target loaded with deuterium, tritium, or deuterium and tritium.  The DT reaction is used more than the DD reaction because the yield of the DT reaction is 50–100 times higher than that of the DD reaction.

D + T → n + &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He {{pad|2em}} E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = 14.1&amp;nbsp;MeV

D + D → n + &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He {{pad|2em}} E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.5&amp;nbsp;MeV

Neutrons produced by DD and DT reactions are emitted somewhat [[Anisotropy|anisotropically]] from the target, slightly biased in the forward (in the axis of the ion beam) direction. The anisotropy of the neutron emission from DD and DT reactions arises from the fact the reactions are [[Isotropy|isotropic]] in the [[Center-of-momentum frame|center of momentum coordinate system (COM)]] but this isotropy is lost in the transformation from the COM coordinate system to the [[laboratory frame of reference]]. In both frames of reference, the He nuclei recoil in the opposite direction to the emitted neutron consistent with the law of [[Momentum#Conservation|conservation of momentum]].

The gas pressure in the ion source region of the neutron tubes generally ranges between 0.1–0.01&amp;nbsp;[[torr|mm&amp;nbsp;Hg]]. The [[mean free path]] of electrons must be shorter than the discharge space to achieve ionization (lower limit for pressure) while the pressure must be kept low enough to avoid formation of discharges at the high extraction voltages applied between the electrodes. The pressure in the accelerating region, however, has to be much lower, as the mean free path of electrons must be longer to prevent formation of a discharge between the high voltage electrodes.&lt;ref name="ch8"&gt;{{ cite book |author1=van der Horst |author2=H. L. | year = 1964 | title = Gas-Discharge Tubes | chapter = VIIIc Neutron Generators | pages = 281–295 | publisher = Philips Technical Library | location = Eindhoven, Netherlands | series = Philips Technical Library | volume = 16 | oclc = 10391645 | id = UDC No. 621.387 
| url = http://www.coultersmithing.com/OldStuff/pdfs/Pch8.pdf| format = pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ion accelerator usually consists of several electrodes with cylindrical symmetry, acting as an [[einzel lens]]. The ion beam can thus be focused to a small point at the target. The accelerators typically require power supplies of 100 - 500 kV. They usually have several stages, with voltage between the stages not exceeding 200&amp;nbsp;kV to prevent [[field emission]].&lt;ref name="ch8"/&gt;

In comparison with radionuclide neutron sources, neutron tubes can produce much higher [[neutron flux]]es and consistent (monochromatic) neutron energy spectrums can be obtained. The neutron production rate can also be controlled.&lt;ref name="ch8"/&gt;

==Sealed neutron tubes==
&lt;!-- Parts of this text, inserted by 119.154.44.9, are based on text from www.thermo.com.  It has been edited and referenced here. --&gt;
The central part of a neutron generator is the particle accelerator itself, sometimes called a neutron tube.
Neutron tubes have several components including an ion source, ion optic elements, and a beam target; all of these are enclosed within a vacuum-tight enclosure. High voltage insulation between the ion optical elements of the tube is provided by glass and/or ceramic insulators. The neutron tube is, in turn, enclosed in a metal housing, the accelerator head, which is filled with a dielectric medium to insulate the high voltage elements of the tube from the operating area. The accelerator and ion source high voltages are provided by external power supplies. The control console allows the operator to adjust the operating parameters of the neutron tube. The power supplies and control equipment are normally located within 10–30 [[foot (unit)|feet]] of the accelerator head in laboratory instruments, but may be several [[kilometer]]s away in [[well logging]] instruments.

In comparison with their predecessors, sealed neutron tubes do not require [[vacuum pump]]s and gas sources for operation. They are therefore more mobile and compact, while also durable and reliable. For example, sealed neutron tubes have replaced radioactive [[Modulated neutron initiator|neutron initiators]], in supplying a pulse of neutrons to the imploding core of modern [[nuclear weapon]]s.

Examples of neutron tube ideas date as far back as the 1930s, pre-nuclear weapons era, by German scientists filing a 1938 German patent (March 1938, patent # 261,156) and obtaining a United States Patent (July 1941, USP#2,251,190); examples of present state of the art are given by developments such as the Neutristor,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Elizondo-Decanini, J.

[[File:Neutristor in its simplest form.JPG|thumb|Neutristor in an inexpensive vacuum sealed package ready for testing]]

==Ion sources==
{{main|Ion source}}
A good ion source should provide a strong [[ion beam]] without consuming much of the gas. For hydrogen isotopes, production of atomic ions is favored over molecular ions, as atomic ions have higher neutron yield on collision. The ions generated in the ion source are then extracted by an electric field into the accelerator region, and accelerated towards the target. The gas consumption is chiefly caused by the pressure difference between the ion generating and ion accelerating spaces that has to be maintained. Ion currents of 10&amp;nbsp;mA at gas consumptions of 40&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/hour are achievable.&lt;ref name="ch8"/&gt;

For a sealed neutron tube, the ideal ion source should use low gas pressure, give high ion current with large proportion of atomic ions, have low gas clean-up, use low power, have high reliability and high lifetime, its construction has to be simple and robust and its maintenance requirements have to be low.&lt;ref name="ch8"/&gt;

Gas can be efficiently stored in a replenisher, an electrically heated coil of zirconium wire. Its temperature determines the rate of absorption/desorption of hydrogen by the metal, which regulates the pressure in the enclosure.

===Cold cathode (Penning)===
&lt;!-- Parts of this text, inserted by 119.154.44.9, are based on text from www.thermo.com.  It has been edited and referenced here. --&gt;
The Penning source is a low gas pressure, [[cold cathode]] ion source which utilizes crossed electric and magnetic fields. The ion source anode is at a positive potential, either dc or pulsed, with respect to the source cathode. The ion source voltage is normally between 2 and 7 kilovolts. A magnetic field, oriented parallel to the source axis, is produced by a [[permanent magnet]]. A [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] is formed along the axis of the anode which traps electrons which, in turn, ionize gas in the source. The ions are extracted through the exit cathode. Under normal operation, the ion species produced by the Penning source are over 90% molecular ions. This disadvantage is however compensated for by the other advantages of the system.

One of the cathodes is a cup made of [[soft iron]], enclosing most of the discharge space. The bottom of the cup has a hole through which most of the generated ions are ejected by the magnetic field into the acceleration space. The soft iron shields the acceleration space from the magnetic field, to prevent a breakdown.&lt;ref name="ch8"/&gt;

Ions emerging from the exit cathode are accelerated through the potential difference between the exit cathode and the accelerator electrode. The schematic indicates that the exit cathode is at ground potential and the target is at high (negative) potential. This is the case in many sealed tube neutron generators. However, in cases when it is desired to deliver the maximum flux to a sample, it is desirable to operate the neutron tube with the target grounded and the source floating at high (positive) potential. The accelerator voltage is normally between 80 and 180 kilovolts.

The accelerating electrode has the shape of a long hollow cylinder. The ion beam has a slightly diverging angle (about 0.1 [[radian]]). The electrode shape and distance from target can be chosen so the entire target surface is bombarded with ions. Acceleration voltages of up to 200&amp;nbsp;kV are achievable.

The ions pass through the accelerating electrode and strike the target. When ions strike the target, 2–3 electrons per ion are produced by secondary emission. In order to prevent these secondary electrons from being accelerated back into the ion source, the accelerator electrode is biased negative with respect to the target. This voltage, called the suppressor voltage, must be at least 500 volts and may be as high as a few kilovolts. Loss of suppressor voltage will result in damage, possibly catastrophic, to the neutron tube.

Some neutron tubes incorporate an intermediate electrode, called the focus or extractor electrode, to control the size of the beam spot on the target.  The gas pressure in the source is regulated by heating or cooling the gas reservoir element.

===Radio frequency (RF)===
Ions can be created by electrons formed in high-frequency electromagnetic field. The discharge is formed in a tube located between electrodes, or inside a [[electromagnetic coil|coil]]. Over 90% proportion of atomic ions is achievable.&lt;ref name="ch8"/&gt;

==Targets==
&lt;!-- Parts of this text are based on text from www.thermo.com --&gt;
The targets used in neutron generators are [[thin film]]s of metal such as [[titanium]], [[scandium]], or [[zirconium]] which are deposited onto a [[silver]], [[copper]] or [[molybdenum]] substrate. Titanium, scandium, and zirconium form stable chemical compounds called [[metal hydride]]s when combined with hydrogen or its isotopes. These metal hydrides are made up of two [[hydrogen]] ([[deuterium]] or [[tritium]]) atoms per metal atom and allow the target to have extremely high densities of hydrogen. This is important to maximize the neutron yield of the neutron tube. The gas reservoir element also uses metal hydrides, e.g. [[uranium hydride]], as the active material.

Titanium is preferred to zirconium as it can withstand higher temperatures (200&amp;nbsp;°C), and gives higher neutron yield as it captures [[deuteron]]s better than zirconium. The maximum temperature allowed for the target, above which hydrogen isotopes undergo desorption and escape the material, limits the ion current per surface unit of the target; slightly divergent beams are therefore used. A 1&amp;nbsp;microampere ion beam accelerated at 200&amp;nbsp;kV to a titanium-tritium target can generate up to 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; neutrons per second. The neutron yield is mostly determined by the accelerating voltage and the ion current level.&lt;ref name="ch8"/&gt;

An example of a tritium target in use is a 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm thick silver disc with a 1&amp;nbsp;micrometer layer of titanium deposited on its surface; the titanium is then saturated with tritium.&lt;ref name="ch8"/&gt;

Metals with sufficiently low hydrogen diffusion can be turned into deuterium targets by bombardment of deuterons until the metal is saturated. Gold targets under such condition show four times higher efficiency than titanium. Even better results can be achieved with targets made of a thin film of a high-absorption high-diffusivity metal (e.g. titanium) on a substrate with low hydrogen diffusivity (e.g. silver), as the hydrogen is then concentrated on the top layer and can not diffuse away into the bulk of the material. Using a deuterium-tritium gas mixture, self-replenishing D-T targets can be made. The neutron yield of such targets is lower than of tritium-saturated targets in deuteron beams, but their advantage is much longer lifetime and constant level of neutron production. Self-replenishing targets are also tolerant to high-temperature [[bake-out]] of the tubes, as their saturation with hydrogen isotopes is performed after the bakeout and tube sealing.&lt;ref name="ch8"/&gt;

==High voltage power supplies==
One particularly interesting approach for generating the high voltage fields needed to accelerate ions in a neutron tube is to use a [[pyroelectric crystal]].  In April 2005 researchers at [[UCLA]] demonstrated the use of a thermally cycled [[pyroelectric]] crystal to generate high electric fields in a neutron generator application.  In February 2006 researchers at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] demonstrated the use of two oppositely poled crystals for this application.  Using these low-tech power supplies it is possible to generate a sufficiently high [[electric field]] gradient across an accelerating gap to accelerate deuterium ions into a deuterated target to produce the D&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;D fusion reaction.  These devices are similar in their operating principle to conventional sealed-tube neutron generators which typically use [[Cockcroft–Walton generator|Cockcroft–Walton]] type high voltage power supplies.  The novelty of this approach is in the simplicity of the high voltage source.  Unfortunately, the relatively low accelerating current that pyroelectric crystals can generate, together with the modest pulsing frequencies that can be achieved (a few cycles per minute) limits their near-term application in comparison with today's commercial products (see below).  Also see [[pyroelectric fusion]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scienceblog.com/cms/ny_team_confirms_ucla_tabletop_fusion_10017.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other technologies==

In addition to the conventional neutron generator design described above several other approaches exist to use electrical systems for producing neutrons.

===Inertial electrostatic confinement/fusor===
{{main|Fusor}}
Another type of innovative neutron generator is the [[inertial electrostatic confinement]] fusion device.  This neutron generator avoids using a solid target which will be sputter eroded causing metalization of insulating surfaces. Depletion of the reactant gas within the solid target is also avoided. Far greater operational lifetime is achieved. Originally called a fusor, it was invented by [[Philo Farnsworth]], the inventor of electronic [[television]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1661">The '''Ornithological Council''' is an association of [[ornithology|ornithological]] organisations based in the [[Americas]] involved in bird study and conservation. It was established by [[Richard C. Banks]] and incorporated in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1992 as a [[non-profit organization|nonprofit organization]]. Its original members comprised the [[American Ornithologists' Union]], [[Association of Field Ornithologists]], Colonial Waterbirds Society (now the [[Waterbird Society]]), [[Cooper Ornithological Society]], [[Pacific Seabird Group]], [[Raptor Research Foundation]] and [[Wilson Ornithological Society]].  Since then they have been joined by [[CIPAMEX]], the [[Neotropical Ornithological Society]], the [[Society of Canadian Ornithologists]] and the [[Society for the Conservation and Study of Caribbean Birds]].

The Council focuses not only on issues affect birds and their survival, but also the needs of ornithologists. It tries to resolve conflicts and promotes sound management and the sustainable use of natural resources.  Issues include funding for research and educational programs, government regulations and permits for research activities, decision-making in habitat and biodiversity management, the impacts of birds on fisheries, in agriculture and in urban areas, threatened species, the role of birds in ecosystems, and standards concerning the use and maintenance of live birds in research.

'''Petroleum politics''' have been an increasingly important aspect of [[diplomacy]] since the rise of the [[petroleum industry]] in the [[Middle East]] in the early 20th century.  As competition continues for a vital resource, the strategic calculations of major and minor countries alike place prominent emphasis on the pumping, refining, transport, sale and use of petroleum products. However, international climate policy and unconventional oil and gas developments may change the balance of power between petroleum exporting and importing countries with major negative implications expected for the exporting states.&lt;ref&gt;Indra Overland (2015) Future Petroleum Geopolitics: Consequences of Climate Policy and Unconventional Oil and Gas, in Jinyue Yan (ed.)

==Quota agreements==
The [[Achnacarry Agreement]] or "As-Is Agreement" was an early attempt to restrict petroleum production, signed in [[Scotland]] on 17 September 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first=J.H. | last=Bamberg | title=The History of the British Petroleum Company, Volume 2: The Anglo-Iranian Years, 1928-1954 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1994 | pages=528–34 | url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/energy/achnacarry.htm | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020185811/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/energy/achnacarry.htm | archivedate=2011-10-20 | df= }} Text of the 18 August 1928 draft of the Achnacarry Agreement.&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of the [[East Texas Oil Field]] in the 1930s led to a boom in production that caused prices to fall, leading the [[Railroad Commission of Texas]] to control production. The Commission retained ''de facto'' control of the market until the rise of [[OPEC]] in the 1970s.

The [[Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement]] of 1944 tried to extend these restrictions internationally but was opposed by the industry in the [[United States]] and so [[Franklin Roosevelt]] withdrew from the deal.

[[Venezuela]] was the first country to move towards the establishment of OPEC by approaching [[Iran]], [[Gabon]], [[Libya]], [[Kuwait]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] in 1949, but OPEC was not set up until 1960, when the United States forced import quotas on Venezuelan and [[Persian Gulf]] oil in order to support the Canadian and Mexican oil industries{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}. OPEC first wielded its power with the [[1973 oil crisis|1973 oil embargo]] against the United States and [[Western Europe]].

==Oil and international conflict==
{{Main|Petro-aggression}}
The term "petro-aggression" has been used to describe the tendency of oil-rich states to instigate international conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Colgan|first=Jeff|title=Petro-Aggression: When Oil Causes War|url=http://www.cambridge.org/9781107654976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=Feb 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many examples including: Iraq’s invasion of Iran and Kuwait; Libya’s repeated incursions into Chad in the 1970s and 1980s; Iran’s long-standing suspicion of Western powers.  Some scholars have also suggested that oil-rich states are frequently the targets of "resource wars."

==Peak oil==
{{Main|Peak oil|Hubbert peak theory}}
In 1956, a Shell geophysicist named [[M. King Hubbert]] accurately predicted that U.S. oil production would peak in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/life/feature/story/0,13026,1464050,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=The end of oil is closer than you think | first=John | last=Vidal | date=21 April 2005 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2006, former U.S. president [[Bill Clinton]] said in a speech,&lt;ref name="NameReport"&gt;{{cite web
|last =Clinton
|first=Bill
|title = Speech at the London Business School
|work =
|publisher =Energy Bulletin
|date = March 28, 2006

|accessdate = 2008-11-23}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

"We may be at a point of peak oil production. You may see $100 a barrel oil in the next two or three years, but what still is driving this globalization is the idea that is you cannot possibly get rich, stay rich and get richer if you don’t release more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. That was true in the industrial era; it is simply factually not true. What is true is that the old energy economy is well organized, financed and connected politically."

In a 1999 speech, [[Dick Cheney]], the US Vice President and former CEO of [[Halliburton]] (one of the world's largest energy services corporations), said,

"By some estimates there will be an average of two per cent annual growth in global oil demand over the years ahead along with conservatively a three per cent natural decline in production from existing reserves. That means by 2010 we will need on the order of an additional fifty million barrels a day. So where is the oil going to come from?....While many regions of the world offer great oil opportunities, the Middle East with two thirds of the world's oil and the lowest cost, is still where the prize ultimately lies, even though companies are anxious for greater access there, progress continues to be slow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petroleum.co.uk/speeches.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000414054656/http://www.petroleum.co.uk/speeches.htm|title=Institute of Petroleum - Dick Cheney's Autumn lunch speech|archivedate=14 April 2000|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheney went on to argue that the oil industry should become more active in politics:

"Oil is the only large industry whose leverage has not been all that effective in the political arena. Textiles, electronics, agriculture all seem often to be more influential. Our constituency is not only oilmen from Louisiana and Texas, but software writers in Massachusetts and specialty steel producers in Pennsylvania. I am struck that this industry is so strong technically and financially yet not as politically successful or influential as are often smaller industries. We need to earn credibility to have our views heard."

==Pipeline diplomacy in the Caspian Sea area==
{{See also|Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline}}

The [[Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline]] was built to transport crude oil and the [[South Caucasus Pipeline|Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum]] pipeline was built to transport natural gas from the western side ([[Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani sector]]) of the [[Caspian Sea]] to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] bypassing Russian pipelines and thus Russian control. Following the construction of the pipelines, the United States and the [[European Union]] proposed extending them by means of the proposed [[Trans-Caspian Oil Pipeline]] and the [[Trans-Caspian Gas Pipeline]] under the Caspian Sea to oil and gas fields on the eastern side ([[Kazakhstan]] and [[Turkmenistan]] sectors) of the Caspian Sea. In 2007, Russia signed agreements with Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan to connect their oil and gas fields to the Russian pipeline system effectively killing the undersea route.

China has completed the [[Kazakhstan–China oil pipeline]] from the Kazakhstan oil fields to the Chinese [[Alashankou-Dushanzi Crude Oil Pipeline]] in China. China is also working on the [[Kazakhstan-China gas pipeline]] from the Kazakhstan gas fields to the Chinese [[West-East Gas Pipeline]] in China.

==Politics of oil nationalization==
{{Main|Nationalization of oil supplies}}
Several countries have nationalised foreign-run oil businesses, often failing to compensate investors. [[Enrique Mosconi]], the director of the Argentine state owned oil company ''[[Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales]]'' (YPF, which was the first state owned oil company in the world, preceding the French ''[[Total S.A.|Compagnie française des pétroles]]'' (CFP, French Company of Petroleums), created in 1924 by the conservative [[Raymond Poincaré]]), advocated oil nationalization in the late 1920s among Latin American countries. The latter was achieved in Mexico during [[Lázaro Cárdenas]]'s rule, with the ''[[Expropiación petrolera]]''.

Similarly Venezuela nationalized its oil industry in 1976.

==Politics of alternative fuels==
[[Vinod Khosla]] (a well known investor in IT firms and alternative energy) has argued&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |type=Video podcast |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I46Mwj82pvI |title=Biofuels: Think Outside The Barrel |first=Vinod |last=Khosla |publisher=Google |date=29 March 2006 |accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the political interests of environmental advocates, agricultural businesses, energy security advocates (such as ex-CIA director James Woolsey) and automakers, are all aligned for the increased production of ethanol. He pointed out that from 2003 to 2006, [[ethanol fuel in Brazil]] replaced 40% of its gasoline consumption while flex fuel vehicles went from 3% of car sales to 70%.  Brazilian ethanol, which is produced using sugarcane, reduces greenhouse gases by 60-80% (20% for corn-produced ethanol). Khosla also said that ethanol was about 10% cheaper per given distance.  There are currently ethanol subsidies in the United States but they are all blender's credits, meaning the oil refineries receive the subsidies rather than the farmers. There are indirect subsidies due to subsidising farmers to produce corn. Vinod says after one of his presentations in [[Davos]], a senior Saudi oil official came up to him and threatened: "If biofuels start to take off, we will drop the price of oil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/people/displaystory.cfm?story_id=5655161 | work=The Economist | title=A healthier addiction | date=23 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Vinod has come up with a new recommendation that oil should be taxed if it drops below $40.00/barrel in order to counter price manipulation.

Ex-CIA director [[James Woolsey]] and U.S. Senator [[Richard Lugar]] are also vocal proponents of ethanol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://lugar.senate.gov/new_petroleum.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070131202836/http://lugar.senate.gov/new_petroleum.html |deadurl=yes |archivedate=31 January 2007 |title=The New Petroleum |first1=Richard G. |last1=Lugar |first2=R. James |last2=Woolsey |journal=Foreign Affairs |date=January–February 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Sweden announced plans to end its dependence on fossil fuels by the year 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sweden.gov.se/sb/d/3212/a/51058|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125083407/http://www.sweden.gov.se/sb/d/3212/a/51058|title=Sweden first to break dependence on oil! New programme presented|archivedate=25 November 2005|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geopolitics of oil money==

Multibillion-dollar inflows and outflows of petroleum money have worldwide [[macroeconomic]] consequences, and major oil exporters can gain substantial influence from their [[petrodollar recycling]] activities.

==Key oil producing countries==

===Canada===
As development in the [[Alberta oil sands]], [[deepwater drilling|deep sea drilling]] in the North Atlantic and the prospects of [[arctic oil]] continue to grow Canada increasingly grows as a global oil exporter. There are currently three major pipelines under proposal that would ship oil to the pacific, atlantic and gulf ports. These projects have stirred internal controversy, receiving fierce opposition from First Nations groups and environmentalists.

===Iran===
{{Main|Energy in Iran}}
Discovery of oil in 1908 at [[Masjed Soleiman]] in [[Iran]] initiated the quest for oil in the Middle East.  The [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]] (AIOC) was founded in 1909.
In 1951, Iran nationalized its oil fields initiating the [[Abadan Crisis]]. The United States of America and Great Britain thus punished Iran by arranging coup against its democratically elected prime minister, Mosaddeq, and brought the former Shah's son, a dictator, to power. In 1953 the US and GB arranged the arrest of the Prime Minister Mosaddeq.
Iran exports oil to China and Russia. ''See also: [[Ministry of Petroleum of Iran#oil subsidies|Iranian Oil Subsidies]]''

===Iraq===
{{Main|Rationale for the Iraq War}}
Iraq holds the world's second-largest [[proven oil reserves]], with increasing exploration expected to enlarge them beyond {{convert|200|Goilbbl|m3}} of "high-grade [[crude oil|crude]], extraordinarily cheap to produce."&lt;ref name="Global Policy Forum: Oil in Iraq"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.globalpolicy.org/political-issues-in-iraq/oil-in-iraq.html |title=Oil in Iraq |publisher=Global Policy Forum |accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Organizations such as the [[Global Policy Forum]] (GPF) have asserted that Iraq's oil is "the central feature of the political landscape" there, and that as a result of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 invasion]],"'friendly' companies expect to gain most of the lucrative oil deals that will be worth hundreds of billions of dollars in profits in the coming decades." According to GPF, U.S. influence over the 2005 [[Constitution of Iraq]] has made sure it "contains language that guarantees a major role for foreign companies."&lt;ref name="Global Policy Forum: Oil in Iraq"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/185/40632.html |title=Crude Designs |first=Greg |last=Muttitt |publisher=Global Policy Forum |date=November 2005 |accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
{{Main|Petroleum industry in Mexico}}
Mexico has a largely oil-based economy, being the seventh largest producer of petroleum. Though Mexico has gradually explored different types of electricity, oil is still crucial, recently generating 10% of revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/analysis.cfm?iso=MEX |title=Mexico |publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration |accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1938, all petroleum companies in Mexico were foreign based, often from the United States or Europe. The petroleum industry was [[Petroleum Nationalization in Mexico|nationalized]] in the late 1930s to early 1940s by then-president [[Lázaro Cárdenas]], creating [[PEMEX]]. Mexico's oil industry still remains heavily nationalized. Though oil production has fallen in recent years, Mexico still remains in seventh place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indexmundi.com/g/r.aspx?c=mx&amp;v=88|title=Oil - production - Country Comparison|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nigeria===
[[Petroleum in Nigeria]] was discovered in 1955 at [[Oloibiri]] in the Niger Delta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbendi.co.za/indy/oilg/ogus/af/ng/p0005.htm|title=Extraction of Crude Petroleum in Nigeria - Overview|work=MBendi.com|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High oil prices were the driving force behind [[Nigeria]]’s economic growth in 2005. The country’s real gross domestic product (GDP) grew approximately 4.5 percent in 2005 and was expected to grow by 6.2 percent in 2006. The Nigerian economy is heavily dependent on the oil sector, which accounts for 95 percent of government revenues. Even with the substantial oil wealth, Nigeria ranks as one of the poorest countries in the world, with a $1,000 per capita income and more than 70 percent of the population living in poverty. In October 2005, the 15-member Paris Club announced that it would cancel 60 percent of the debt owed by Nigeria. However, Nigeria must still pay $12.4 billion in arrears amongst meeting other conditions. In March 2006, phase two of the Paris Club agreement will include an additional 34 percent [[debt relief|debt cancellation]], while Nigeria will be responsible for paying back any remaining eligible debts to the lending nations. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), which recently praised the Nigerian government for adopting tighter fiscal policies, will be allowed to monitor Nigeria without having to disburse loans to the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/analysis.cfm?iso=NGA |title=Nigeria |publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) |accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
{{Expand section|date=December 2016}}
High-priced oil allowed the [[USSR]] to subsidize the struggling economies of the [[Soviet bloc]] for a time, and the loss of petrodollar income during the [[1980s oil glut]] contributed to the bloc's collapse in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Economics Behind the Fall of the Berlin Wall |first=Ryan |last=McMaken |publisher=[[Mises Institute]] |date=November 7, 2014 |accessdate=January 12, 2016 |url=https://mises.org/library/economics-behind-fall-berlin-wall |quote=High oil prices in the 1970s propped up the regime so well, that had it not been for Soviet oil sales, it's quite possible the regime would have collapsed a decade earlier.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saudi Arabia===
[[Saudi Arabia]] is an oil-based economy with strong government controls over major economic activities. It possesses both the world's largest known oil reserves, which are 25% of the world's proven reserves, and produces the largest amount of the world's oil. As of 2005, [[Ghawar field]] accounts for about half of Saudi Arabia's total oil production capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/analysis.cfm?iso=SAU |title=Saudi Arabia |publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) |accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saudi Arabia ranks as the largest exporter of petroleum, and plays a leading role in OPEC, its decisions to raise or cut production almost immediately impact world oil prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sa.html|title=The World Factbook|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is perhaps the best example of a contemporary energy superpower, in terms of having power and influence on the global stage (due to its energy reserves and production of not just oil, but natural gas as well). Saudi Arabia is often referred to as the world's only "oil superpower".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/BUSINESS/05/30/oil.monday/index.html |title=Saudi vows to keep oil flowing |date=30 May 2004 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Main|Energy policy of the United States#Petroleum|United States foreign policy in the Middle East}}
In 1998, about 40% of the energy consumed by the United States came from oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energy.cr.usgs.gov/energy/stats_ctry/Stat1.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010111092900/http://energy.cr.usgs.gov/energy/stats_ctry/Stat1.html |deadurl=yes |title=United States Energy and World Energy Production and Consumption Statistics |publisher=[[USGS]] |archivedate=11 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States is responsible for 25% of the world's oil consumption, while having only 3% of the world's proven oil reserves and less than 5% of the world's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrdc.org/air/energy/fensec.asp|title=Reduce Fossil Fuels|work=[[Natural Resources Defense Council|NRDC]]|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1980, [[Carter Doctrine|President Jimmy Carter explicitly declared]]: "An attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Carter |first=Jimmy |title=Third State of the Union Address |publisher=[[Jimmy Carter Presidential Library]] |date=23 January 1980 |url=http://www.jimmycarterlibrary.org/documents/speeches/su80jec.phtml |accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venezuela===
{{See also|Energy policy of Venezuela|Presidency of Hugo Chávez#2000–2001: Reelection}}
According to the Oil and Gas Journal (OGJ), [[Venezuela]] has {{convert|77.2|Goilbbl|m3}} of proven conventional oil reserves, the largest of any country in the Western Hemisphere. In addition it has non-conventional oil deposits similar in size to Canada's - at {{convert|1200|Goilbbl|m3}} approximately equal to the world's reserves of conventional oil. About {{convert|267|Goilbbl|m3}} of this may be producible at current prices using current technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldenergy.org/wec-geis/publications/default/tech_papers/17th_congress/3_1_04.asp |title=What Future for Extra Heavy Oil and Bitumen: The Orinoco Case |last=Bauquis |first=Pierre-René |date=1998 |archivedate=4 February 2007 |publisher=World Energy Council |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204040506/http://www.worldenergy.org/wec-geis/publications/default/tech_papers/17th_congress/3_1_04.asp |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Venezuela's [[Orinoco tar sands]] are less viscous than Canada's [[Athabasca oil sands]] – meaning they can be produced by more conventional means, but are buried deeper – meaning they cannot be extracted by [[surface mining]]. In an attempt to have these ''extra heavy'' oil reserves recognized by the international community, Venezuela has moved to add them to its conventional reserves to give nearly {{convert|350|Goilbbl|m3}} of total oil reserves. This would give it the largest oil reserves in the world, even ahead of Saudi Arabia.

Venezuela nationalized its oil industry in 1975–1976, creating [[Petróleos de Venezuela S.A.|Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PdVSA)]], the country's state-run oil and natural gas company. Along with being Venezuela's largest employer, PdVSA accounts for about one-third of the country’s GDP, 50 percent of the government’s revenue and 80 percent of Venezuela’s exports earnings. In recent years, under the influence of President Chavez, the Venezuelan government has reduced PdVSA’s previous autonomy and amended the rules regulating the country’s hydrocarbons sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/analysis.cfm?iso=VEN |title=Venezuela |publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) |accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, Venezuela opened its upstream oil sector to private investment. This collection of policies, called apertura, facilitated the creation of 32 operating service agreements (OSA) with 22 separate foreign oil companies, including international oil majors like Chevron, BP, Total, and Repsol-YPF.  [[Hugo Chávez]], the [[President of Venezuela]] sharply diverged from previous administrations' economic policies. PDVSA is now used as a cash-cow and as an employer-of-last-resort;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21536570|accessdate=6 January 2012|title=Brazil’s oil boom: Filling up the future|work=[[The Economist]]|quote=|date=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; foreign oil businesses were nationalised and the government refused to pay compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21542465|accessdate=6 January 2012|title=Politics this week |work=[[The Economist]]|quote=|date=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates of Venezuelan oil production vary. Venezuela claims its oil production is over {{convert|3|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}}, but oil industry analysts and the U.S. Energy Information Administration believe it to be much lower. In addition to other reporting irregularities{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}, much of its production is extra-heavy oil, which may or may not be included with conventional oil in the various production estimates. The U.S. Energy Information Agency estimated Venezuela's oil production in December 2006 was only {{convert|2.5|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}}, a 24% decline from its peak of 3.3 million in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/ipm/supply.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070618055955/http://www.eia.doe.gov/ipm/supply.html |archivedate=18 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |title=International Petroleum Monthly |date=May 2007 |publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, Venezuela has pushed the creation of [[Petrocaribe|regional oil initiatives for the Caribbean (Petrocaribe)]], the Andean region (Petroandino), and South America (Petrosur), and Latin America (Petroamerica). The initiatives include assistance for oil developments, investments in refining capacity, and preferential oil pricing. The most developed of these three is the Petrocaribe initiative, with 13 nations signing a preliminary agreement in 2005. Under Petrocaribe, Venezuela will offer crude oil and petroleum products to Caribbean nations under preferential terms and prices, with Jamaica as the first nation to sign on in August 2005.

''Petrowatch'' has been cited by the [[BBC]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murray|first1=Adrienne|title=Fuel price hike catches Indian commuters off guard|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13542102|website=BBC|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref name="China and India" /&gt; ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sharma|first1=Amol|title=BP to Make Big India Investment|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704476604576157930214553312|website=The Wall Street Journal|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Forbes India]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paul|first1=Cuckoo|title=Ajay Kalsi: A Self-Made Man Unafraid to Take Risks|url=http://forbesindia.com/article/richest-indians-11/ajay-kalsi-a-selfmade-man-unafraid-to-take-risks/30022/1|website=Forbes India|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Financial Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lamont|first1=James|title=Vedanta’s Cairn India deal hailed|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f43e2abc-1efd-11e1-ab49-00144feabdc0.html?siteedition=uk#axzz3eXu1AFUi|website=Financial Times|publisher=Pearson PLC|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for its coverage of the [[History of the oil industry in India|Indian oil industry]], the [[Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas]], the [[Directorate General of Hydrocarbons]], and the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board.

In addition ''Petrowatch'' has been cited several times by Japanese investment bank Nomura,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sharma|first1=Anil|last2=Adukia|first2=Ravi|title=India gas: Time to get back in|url=http://www.nomura.com/europe/resources/upload/India_gas_Time_to_get_back_in.pdf|website=Nomura|publisher=Nomura|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; most recently in its India Gas Report published in February 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sharma|first1=Anil|last2=Adukia|first2=Ravi|title=Agreement of LT LNG deferment a positive|url=http://www.petrowatch.com/coc/Nomura-India-Gas-Report-27-Feb-15.pdf|website=Petrowatch|publisher=Petrowatch|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; on Liquefied Natural Gas importer [[Petronet LNG]].

== VK Sibal and DGH controversy ==
In 2008 the [[Directorate General of Hydrocarbons]], the [[Upstream (petroleum industry)|upstream]] technical arm of the [[Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas]], complained about ''Petrowatch'' coverage of the NELP-VII licensing round for the auction of 57 exploration blocks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Award Process for NELP blocks|url=http://petroleum.nic.in/docs/awardprocess.pdf|website=Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas|publisher=Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the newsletter said attracting new companies to India would be difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DGH comments on article published in Petrowatch|url=http://www.petrowatch.com/coc/DGH-criticises-PW-dataroom-coverage-27-Mar-08.pdf|website=Petrowatch|publisher=Petrowatch|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 ''Petrowatch'' was engaged in a dispute with VK Sibal, director general of the DGH, during which Sibal advised Canadian explorer Canoro Resources and other foreign companies interested in the [[History of the oil industry in India|Indian oil industry]] to unsubscribe from the website immediately.&lt;ref name = "Sibal letter"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sibal|first1=V. K.|title=Sub: Article published in PETROWATCH dated 23.10.2009|url=http://www.petrowatch.com/coc/Indian-oil-regulator-VK-Sibal-criticises-Petrowatch-26-Oct-09.pdf|website=Petrowatch|publisher=Petrowatch|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his letter Sibal said ''Petrowatch'' falsely alleged that there had been a raid by India's [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] law enforcement agency on the DGH office and that ''Petrowatch'' was engaged in "crass yellow journalism" and publishing misleading information.&lt;ref name = "Sibal letter" /&gt;

In July 2011 Sibal was investigated by the CBI for his alleged favouritism towards [[Reliance Industries]] ahead of its $5.69bn development of the KG-D6 gasfield&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=A Staff|first1=Writer|title=Full coverage of the RIL-KG D6 basin controversy|url=http://www.livemint.com/Companies/3c1kqkpSDNaJrukopqbxaL/Full-coverage-of-the-RILKG-D6-basin-controversy.html|website=Livemint.com|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Krishna Godavari Basin]] on India's East Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Agencies|title=CBI registers FIR against former DG (Hydrocarbons) V K Sibal for ‘favouring’ private oil firms|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/latest-news/cbi-registers-fir-against-former-dg-hydrocarbons-v-k-sibal-for-favouring-private-oil-firms/|website=The Indian Express|publisher=The Indian Express|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leakgate 2015 ==
In February 2015 ''Petrowatch'' was implicated in the "Leakgate" controversy over the theft of classified government correspondence from the Indian oil ministry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shekhar|first1=Raj|title=Leakgate: Essar paid 45k/month for files|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Leakgate-Essar-paid-45k/month-for-files/articleshow/46995121.cms|website=The Times of India|publisher=The Times of India|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to an apology from the Indian financial daily ''[[Business Standard]]'' newspaper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mukul|first1=Jyoti|title=Two pence for Cabinet notes but information worth a million|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/two-pence-for-cabinet-notes-but-information-worth-a-million-115022100035_1.html|website=Business Standard|publisher=Business Standard|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; after it emerged that the newspaper had wrongly referred to Petrowatch.com as among paid websites that uploaded government documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Correction|url=http://www.petrowatch.com/coc/BS-Correction-24-Feb-15.jpg|website=Petrowatch|publisher=Petrowatch|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2011 ''Petrowatch'' articles on the leak and theft of confidential government documents by oil ministry personnel on behalf of corporate bodies and parallel oil and gas websites for as little as Rs500 ($10) for a cabinet note or Rs50,000/mth ($1000) for a regular stream of classified information had been largely ignored.&lt;ref name= "Frontline"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Venkatesan|first1=V.|title=Failed attempts at plugging leaks|url=http://www.frontline.in/cover-story/failed-attempts-at-plugging-leaks/article6951339.ece|website=Frontline|publisher=The Hindu Newspaper|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chaturvedi sends IB list of 16 suspects to CVC|url=http://www.petrowatch.com/synopsis.php?artId=10240|website=Petrowatch|publisher=Petrowatch|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Leakgate scandal, ''Petrowatch'' head of operations Vivek Mahajan published a code of conduct detailing its remit and the ethical news-gathering policy followed by its journalists.&lt;ref name="Code of Conduct"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mahajan|first1=Vivek|title=Code of Conduct|url=http://www.petrowatch.com/coc/CodeofConduct.pdf|website=Petrowatch|publisher=Petrowatch|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its code of conduct Petrowatch makes it clear that no one expects bribes from its reporters or staff or advises them to undertake
corrupt activity knowing that any such suggestion will be published for industry at large.&lt;ref name="Code of Conduct" /&gt;

'''Plasma transferred wire arc''' ('''PTWA''') '''thermal spraying''' is a [[thermal spraying]] process that deposits a coating on the internal surface of a cylindrical surface, or external surface of any geometry. It is predominantly known for its use in coating the [[cylinder bore]]s of an [[engine]], enabling the use of [[aluminum]] [[engine block]]s without the need for heavy [[cast iron]] sleeves.  A single conductive wire is used as "[[feedstock]]" for the system.  A supersonic plasma jet melts the wire, atomizes it and propels it onto the substrate.  The plasma jet is formed by a transferred arc between a non-consumable [[cathode]] and the wire.  After [[Spray (liquid drop)|atomization]], forced gas transports the stream of molten droplets onto the bore wall. The particles flatten when they impinge on the surface of the substrate, due to their high [[kinetic energy]]. The particles rapidly solidify upon contact and can form both crystalline and amorphus phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0257897208010451 | doi=10.1016/j.surfcoat.2008.11.010 | volume=203 | issue=10–11 | title=Plasma transferred arc composite coatings with self lubricating properties, based on Fe and Ti sulfides: Microstructure and tribological behavior | journal=Surface and Coatings Technology | pages=1384–1394| year=2009 | last1=Skarvelis | first1=P | last2=Papadimitriou | first2=G.D }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the possibility to produce multi-layer coatings. The stacked particles make up a highly wear-resistant coating. All conductive wires up to and including 0.0625" (1.6mm) can be used as feedstock material, including "cored" wires.  PTWA can be used to apply a coating to the wear surface of engine or transmission components to replace a [[Bushing (bearing)|bushing]] or bearing. For example, using PTWA to coat the bearing surface of a [[connecting rod]] offers a number of benefits including reductions in weight, cost, friction potential, and stress in the connecting rod.

The inventors of PTWA received the 2009 IPO National Inventor of the Year award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipo.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;Template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=22504 IPO Education Foundation Honors Top Inventors of 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; This technology was initially [[patent]]ed and developed by [[inventor]]s by [[Flame-Spray Industries, Inc.]]  The technology was subsequently improved upon by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and Flame-Spray Industries. PTWA is currently in use by [[Nissan]] in the [[Nissan GTR]],&lt;ref&gt;http://jalopnik.com/5467038/the-ford-engine-technology-good-enough-for-the-nissan-gt+r The Ford Engine Technology Good Enough For The Nissan GT-R&lt;/ref&gt; Ford is implementing it in the new [[Mustang GT|Mustang GT500 Shelby]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sae.org/mags/aei/7624 Ford launches plasma-sprayed cylinder bores on 2011 Shelby V8], February 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] and other manufacturers are using it for re-manufacturing.

Other applications for this process include the spraying of internal diameters of pipes.  Any conductive wire can be used as the feedstock material, including "cored" wire. [[Refractory metals]] as well as low melt materials are easily deposited.

The recent use of PTWA by Nissan and Ford has been to apply a [[Wear resistance|wear resistant]] coating on the internal surface of engine block cylinder bores. For [[hypoeutectic]] aluminum silicon alloy blocks, PTWA provides a great alternative to cast iron liners which are a higher cost and heavier.  PTWA also delivers increased displacement in the same size engine package and a potential for better [[heat transfer]].

PTWA coatings are also applied directly to cast iron engine blocks for [[re-manufacturing]]. PTWA coated test engines have been run for over 3 million combined miles of trouble free on-the-road performance.  The technology is currently in use at a number of major production facilities around the world. It is also being used to coat worn parts, to make them like-new in re-manufacturing facilities.

The '''precooled jet engine''' is a concept that enables [[jet engines]] with turbomachinery, as opposed to ramjets, to be used at high speeds. Precooling restores some or all of the performance degredation of the engine compressor (by preventing rotating stall/choking/reduced flow), as well as that of the complete gas generator (by maintainig a significant combustor temperature rise within a fixed turbine temperature limit), which would otherwise prevent flight with high ram temperatures.

For higher flight speeds precooling may feature a [[cryogenic fuel]]-cooled [[heat exchanger]] before the air enters the compressor. After gaining heat and vapourising in the heat exchanger, the fuel (e.g. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) burns in the [[combustor]]. Precooling using a heat exchanger has not been used in flight, but is predicted to have significantly high thrust and efficiency at speeds up to Mach 5.5. Precooled jet engine cycles were analyzed by Robert P. Carmichael in 1955.&lt;ref name="hydrogen history"/&gt;{{rp|138}} Pre-cooled engines avoid the need for an air [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]] because, unlike [[liquid air cycle engine]]s (LACE), pre-cooled engines cool the air without [[liquefy]]ing it.

For lower flight speeds precooling can be done with mass injection, known as WIPCC (water injection precompressor cooling)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nas.nasa.gov/assets/pdf/papers/Mehta_U_February2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This method has been used for short duration (due to limited coolant capacity) increases to an aircraft's normal maximum speed. "Operation Skyburner", which gained a world speed record with a [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]],&lt;ref&gt;"F-4 Phantom Modern Combat Aircraft 1", Bill Gunston, Ian Allan Ltd. 1977, {{ISBN|0 7110 0727 6}}, page 19&lt;/ref&gt; and the Mikoyan Ye-266 (Mig 25).&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/highspeedflight00swee/page/n1 page 129&lt;/ref&gt; both used a water/alcohol spray to cool the air ahead of the compressor.

Precooling (as well as combustion chamber water injection) is used at the lowest flight speeds, ie during take off, to increase thrust at high ambient temperatures. 

==Advantages and disadvantages of using precooler heat exchangers==

One main advantage of pre-cooling is (as predicted by the [[ideal gas law]]) for a given [[overall pressure ratio]], there is a significant reduction in compressor delivery temperature (T3), which delays reaching the T3 limit to a higher Mach number. Consequently, sea-level conditions ([[corrected flow]]) can be maintained after the pre-cooler over a very wide range of flight speeds, thus maximizing net thrust even at high speeds. The compressor and ducting after the inlet is subject to much lower and more consistent temperatures, and hence may be made of light alloys. This reduces the weight of the engine, which further improves the thrust/weight ratio.

Hydrogen is a suitable fuel because it is liquid at deeply cryogenic temperatures, and over its useful range has a very high total [[specific heat capacity]],&lt;ref name="hydrogen history"&gt;{{cite book |title= Liquid hydrogen as a propulsion fuel, 1945–1959 (NASA SP-4404) |first= John |last= Sloop |publisher= NASA |year= 1978 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19790008823.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|108}} including the latent heat of vapourisation, higher than water.

However, the low density of [[liquid hydrogen]] has negative effects on the rest of the vehicle, and the vehicle physically becomes very large,&lt;ref name="hydrogen history"/&gt;{{rp|108}} although the weight on the undercarriage and wing loading may remain low.

Hydrogen causes structural weakening in many materials, known as [[hydrogen embrittlement]].

The weight of the precooler adds to the weight of the engine, thereby reducing its [[thrust to weight ratio]].

Passing the intake air through the precooler adds to the inlet drag, thereby reducing the engine net thrust, and so reducing the thrust to weight ratio.

Depending on the amount of cooling required, despite its high thermal capacity, more hydrogen may be needed to cool the air than can be burnt with the cooled air.{{citation needed |reason= e.g. SABRE|date=October 2017}} In some cases, part of the excess hydrogen can be burnt in a ramjet with uncooled air to reduce this inefficiency.

Unlike a LACE engine, a precooled engine doesn't need to liquefy the oxygen, so the amount of cooling is reduced as there is no need to cover of fusion of the oxygen and a smaller total temperature drop is required. This in turn reduces the amount of hydrogen used as a heat-sink, but unable to be burnt. In addition a condenser isn't required, giving a weight saving.

==History of precooling using heat exchangers==

Robert P. Carmichael in 1955 devised several engine cycles that used liquid hydrogen to precool the inlet air to the engine before using it as fuel.&lt;ref name="hydrogen history"/&gt;{{rp|138}}

Interest in precooled engines saw an emergence in the UK in 1982, when [[Alan Bond (engineer)|Alan Bond]] created a precooled air breathing rocket engine design he called SATAN.{{citation needed |reason= I've seen sources that claim SATAN was the engine Bond devised _after_ HOTOL|date=October 2017}} The idea was developed as part of the [[HOTOL]] [[SSTO]] [[spaceplane]] project, and became the Rolls-Royce RB545. In 1989, after the HOTOL project was discontinued, some of the [[RB545]] engineers created a company, Reaction Engines Ltd, to develop the idea into the [[SABRE (rocket engine)|SABRE engine]], and the associated [[Skylon (spacecraft)|Skylon]] spaceplane.

In 1987, N Tanatsugu published "Analytical Study of Space Plane Powered by Air-Turbo Ramjet with Intake Air Cooler." part of Japan's [[Institute of Space and Astronautical Science|ISAS]] (now [[JAXA]]) study into an Air-Turbo Ramjet (ATR, later [[ATREX]] after the addition of an expander cycle) intended to power the first stage of a [[TSTO]] [[spaceplane]]. ATREX was superseded by the Preecooled Turbojet (PCTJ) and Hypersonic Turbojet studies. A liquid nitrogen precooled hydrogen burning test engine was flown at [[Mach number|Mach]] 2 at [[Taiki Aerospace Research Field]] in September 2010.&lt;ref name="HSTJ status 2011"&gt;{{cite conference |title= Development status of the hypersonic turbojet engine for Mach 5 flight in JAXA (IAC-11.C4.5.1) |authors= Kobayashi, H and Taguchi, H and Kojima, Takayuki and Harada, K and Okai, K and Hongoh, M and Arai, T and Sato, T |date= 6 October 2011 |conference= 62nd International Astronautical Congress 2011, IAC 2011 |location= Cape Town, South Africa |volume= 8 |pages= 6655–6659}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Punicic acid''' (also called '''trichosanic acid''') is a [[Polyunsaturated fat|polyunsaturated fatty acid]], 18:3 ''cis''-9, ''trans''-11, ''cis''-13. It is named for the [[pomegranate]], (''Punica granatum''), and is obtained from pomegranate seed oil. 
It is also found in the seed oils of [[snake gourd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cyberlipid|url= http://www.cyberlipid.org/fa/acid0003.htm| accessdate= 2007-01-11|title=POLYENOIC FATTY ACIDS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Punicic acid is a [[Polyunsaturated fatty acid#Conjugated fatty acids|conjugated linolenic acid]] or CLnA; i.e. it has three [[Conjugated system|conjugated double bonds]]. It is chemically similar to the [[conjugated linoleic acid]]s, or CLA, which have two. It has been erroneous classified as "n-5" or "omega-5" polyunsaturated fatty acid because the last double bond is located five carbons from the terminal "omega" carbon, but the "n-x" notation can only be applied to all ''cis'', methylene-interrupted polyunsaturated fatty acids.
In lab rats, punicic acid was converted to the CLA [[rumenic acid]] (9Z11E-CLA).&lt;ref name=Tsuzuki&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2443">A '''renewable energy sculpture''' is a sculpture that produces power from [[renewable source]]s, such as solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric or tidal.

[[File:Wind mast Menina by the artist Elena Paroucheva.jpg|thumb|"Menina", a [[wind turbine]] sculpture model by artist Elena Paroucheva]]
Such a sculpture is functionally both a [[renewable energy generator]] and an [[work of art|artwork]], fulfilling utilitarian, aesthetic, and cultural functions.  The idea of renewable energy sculptures has been pioneered by ecofuturist visionaries such as artists [[Patrice Stellest]], [[Sarah Hall (glass artist)|Sarah Hall]], [[Julian H. Scaff]], Patrick Marold, [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40367914 Elena Paroucheva], architects [[Laurie Chetwood]] and Nicholas Grimshaw, University of Illinois professor Bil Becket, and collaborations such as the Land Art Generator Initiative.  Echoing the philosophy of the [[environmental art]] movement as a whole, artists creating renewable energy sculpture believe that the aesthetics of the artworks are inextricably linked to their ecological function.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

[[File:Fauteuil racine Chine Quianlong musee arts asiatiques Nice.jpg|thumbnail|Chinese armchair made from roots. [[Qing dynasty]], [[Qianlong Emperor|Qianlong era]], 18th century]]
'''Root carving''' is a traditional [[Chinese art]] form. It consists of carving and polishing tree [[root]]s into various artistic creations.

==History==
Using roots to make necessities has been practiced since primitive society. Like other artistic crafts, art of roots produced from primitive labor. The earliest root carvings are “辟邪” and “角形器” showing up in the [[Warring States period]].

In the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] dynasties, root carving works not only prevailed in folk, but they were also cherished by the governing class. In the Tang dynasty, people laid emphasis on the natural forms of roots, cleverly taking advantage of the effect of corrosion and moth-eaten.

In the [[Song dynasty|Song]] and [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] dynasties, art of root carving not only developed in the court and folk, but also appeared in grottoes and temples. Roots were used to carve the statues of the [[Buddha]], always comparing favorably with the clay.

==Features==
[[File:Root carving in Haikou - 06.JPG|thumb|150px|A craftsman works on a piece in [[Haikou]] City, [[Hainan]] Province. His shop is located in an area beside East Lake, part of [[Haikou People's Park]]. The area contains dozens of small shops dedicated to producing root carvings.]]

Root carving preserves natural beauty.{{or-inline|date=December 2017}} Ancient artists created lifelike and vivid works by a special technique using expression based on the roots' natural forms. This kind of creation is not completely artificial, but created by both human beings and nature.

Root carving is different from [[engraving]]. It combines peculiarity with ingeniousness. Although its aesthetic principals share common ground with engraving, at the same time they are applied uniquely. The common ground is that they share expressive techniques of [[wood carving]], [[sculpture]], [[stone carving]] and so on, overcoming weaknesses by acquiring others strong points. The difference lies in the natural shape of roots. During the creative process, root carving mostly maintains the natural form of the root, adding some artificial polishing. In other words, root carving is guided by the inherent qualities of the root, rather than by shaping images merely through carving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.genpen.com/genyi/jieshao/9661.html |title=根雕艺术的特点 |publisher=News.genpen.com |date=2010-03-07 |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gzzhuhai.com/news-22.aspx |title=根雕艺术发展史 |publisher=Gzzhuhai.com |date=2011-06-23 |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Necessities==
{{peacock|date=May 2015}}
Creative effect achieved from the same material can vary from artist to artist. Within the field three factors are considered of major importance.

*Uniqueness of the root - To some degree, root carving is an act of discovery. Finding and working with a unique root is half of the task and requires experience and a keen aesthetic vision.{{or-inline|date=December 2017}}

*Cultural foundation - Rich cultural foundation, referring to the overall creative process, highlights the natural beauty of the root.{{or-inline|date=December 2017}}

*Craftsmanship - The natural beauty of roots can be realized from a fertile imagination and a high degree of composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pic.yesky.com/sucai/szwfj/shumumo/238/520738.shtml |title=根雕艺术（三）图1_树木果实_天极图片 |publisher=Pic.yesky.com |date=2010-12-05 |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pic.yesky.com/sucai/szwfj/shumumo/238/520738_2.shtml |title=根雕艺术（三）图2_树木果实_天极图片 |publisher=Pic.yesky.com |date=2010-12-05 |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hb.xinhuanet.com/zhuanti/200802/29/content_15455072.htm ]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jkpa.net/news_show.php?nid=740l |title=用树根雕塑人生-健康平安网 |publisher=Jkpa.net |date=2010-05-11 |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sh1800.net/hongmu/woodintro/960.htm |title=缅甸黄金樟树瘤 让根雕艺术焕发无穷魅力 树瘤- 红木知识、红木种类 |publisher=Sh1800.net |date=2011-08-23 |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tynet.gov.cn/HXTou/gdysnljm_4/ |title=根雕艺术你了解吗 - 头头外挂网 |publisher=Tynet.gov.cn |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ya.newssc.org/system/20110325/001211581.html |title=四川芦山第四届根雕艺术节开幕_四川新闻网-雅安频道 |publisher=Ya.newssc.org |date=2011-03-25 |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sznews.zjol.com.cn/sznews/ztpd/gdysz/index.shtml |title=嵊州新闻网-中国根雕艺术精品展 |publisher=Sznews.zjol.com.cn |date= |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.craaw.com/ljrw1.htm |title=根雕艺术概述 |publisher=Craaw.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''spoolbase''' is a shore-based facility used to facilitate [[continuous pipe laying]] for offshore [[oil industry|oil and gas production]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Metallurgist and materials technologist'', Institution of Metallurgists (Great Britain), 1980, Vol 12, p.491&lt;/ref&gt; The facility allows the welding of single or double joints (40' or 80') of steel pipe of 4" to 18" diameter, into predetermined lengths for spooling onto a [[reel lay vessel]].

Shore based spoolbases serve the oil and gas sector from locations in the USA, UK, Norway, Brazil, and Angola, and portable spoolbases may be set up in any location to suit local requirements.

'''Unconventional wind turbines''' are those that differ significantly from the most common types in use. {{As of|2012}}, the most common type of [[wind turbine]] is the three-bladed upwind [[horizontal-axis wind turbine]] (HAWT), where the turbine rotor is at the front of the [[Nacelle (wind turbine)|nacelle]] and facing the wind upstream of its supporting [[Wind turbine design#Tower|turbine tower]]. A second major unit type is also classified by its axis: the [[Vertical axis wind turbine|vertical-axis wind turbine]] (VAWT), with blades extending upwards that are supported by a rotating framework.

Due to the large growth of the [[wind power|wind power industry]] and the length of its historical development dating back to [[windmill]]s, many different [[wind turbine design]]s exist, are in current development, or have been proposed due to their unique features. The wide variety of designs reflects ongoing commercial, technological, and inventive interests in harvesting wind resources both more efficiently and to the greatest extent possible, with costs that may be either lower or greater than conventional three-bladed HAWT designs.

Some turbine designs that differ from the standard type have had limited commercial use, while others have only been demonstrated or are only theoretical concepts with no practical applications. Such unconventional designs cover a wide gamut of innovations, including different rotor types, basic functionalities, supporting structures and form-factors.

=== Twin-bladed rotor===
Nearly all modern wind turbines uses rotors with three blades, but some use only two blades. This was the type used at [[Kaiser-Wilhelm-Koog]], Germany, where a large experimental two-bladed unit—the [[Growian|GROWIAN]], or ''Große Windkraftanlage'' (big wind turbine)—operated from 1983 to 1987. Other prototypes and several wind turbine types were also manufactured by NedWind. The [[Eemmeerdijk Wind Park]] in [[Zeewolde|Zeewolde, Netherlands]] uses only two-bladed turbines. Wind turbines with two blades are manufactured by [[Nordic Windpower]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wind-turbine-models.com/turbine/330/nedwind-rhenen-bv/nw-43-500 NedWind Rhenen bV NW 43/500 (Turbine)], Nedwind website. Retrieved 27 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; such as model # N 1000, and by GC China Turbine Corp.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcchinaturbine.com/wind-turbines/about/ Why 2-Blade?], GC China Turbine Corporation website. Retrieved 27 January 2013.
&lt;/ref&gt; The [[NASA wind turbines]] (1975-1996) each had 2-blade rotors, producing the same energy at lower cost than three-blade rotor designs.

=== Downwind rotor===
Nearly all wind turbines are of an upwind design, meaning the rotor is in front of the nacelle when the wind is blowing. Some turbines are of a downwind design, meaning the rotor is behind the nacelle when the wind is blowing.
=== Ducted rotor===
Still something of a research project,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifb.uni-stuttgart.de/~doerner/diffuser.html Uni-Stuttgart.de website]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025011240/http://www.ifb.uni-stuttgart.de/~doerner/diffuser.html |date=October 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ducted rotor consists of a turbine inside a duct that flares out at the back. They are also referred as [[Diffuser-Augmented Wind Turbines]] (i.e. DAWT). The main advantage of the ducted rotor is that it can operate in a wide range of winds and generate a higher power per unit of rotor area. Another advantage is that the generator operates at a high rotation rate, so it doesn't require a bulky [[gearbox]], allowing the mechanical portion to be smaller and lighter. A disadvantage is that (apart from the gearbox) it is more complicated than the unducted rotor and the duct is usually quite heavy, which puts an added load on the tower. The [[Éolienne Bollée]] is an example of a DAWT.

=== Co-axial, multi-rotor===

Two or more rotors may be mounted to the same driveshaft, with their combined co-rotation together turning the same generator: fresh wind is brought to each rotor by sufficient spacing between rotors combined with an offset angle (alpha) from the wind direction. Wake vorticity is recovered as the top of a wake hits the bottom of the next rotor. Power has been multiplied several times using co-axial, multiple rotors in testing conducted by inventor and researcher Douglas Selsam, for the California Energy Commission in 2004. The first commercially available co-axial multi-rotor turbine is the patented dual-rotor American Twin Superturbine from Selsam Innovations in California, with 2 propellers separated by 12 feet. It is the most powerful {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=mid|-diameter}} turbine available, due to this extra rotor.  In 2015, Iowa State University aerospace engineers Hui Hu and Anupam Sharma were optimizing designs of multi-rotor systems, including a horizontal-axis co-axial dual-rotor model.  In addition to a conventional three-blade rotor, it has a smaller secondary three-blade rotor, covering the near-axis region usually inefficiently harvested.  They were considering the overall efficiency of the wind farm, and checking many variations beyond the one mentioned.  Preliminary results indicated 10-20% gains, less efficient than is claimed by existing counter-rotating designs but those are complex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.iastate.edu/news/2015/03/06/dualrotorturbines Iowa State engineers study the benefits of adding a second, smaller rotor to wind turbines.]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Contra rotating wind turbine.jpeg|thumb|Counter rotating wind turbine (dual rotor)]]

=== Counter-rotating horizontal-axis===
When a system expels or accelerates mass in one direction, the accelerated mass causes a proportional but opposite force on that system. The spinning blade of a single rotor wind turbine causes a significant amount of tangential or rotational air flow. The energy of this tangential air flow is wasted in a single-rotor propeller design. To use this wasted effort, the placement of a second rotor behind the first takes advantage of the disturbed airflow, and can gain up to 40% more energy from a given swept area as compared with a single rotor. Other advantages of contra-rotation include no gear boxes and auto-centering on the wind (no yaw motors/mechanism required). A patent application dated 1992 exists based on work done with the Trimblemill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/wo.jsp?wo=1992012343&amp;IA=WO1992012343&amp;DISPLAY=DESC (WO1992012343) Wind Turbine], Patentscope website, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the counter-rotating turbines are on the same side of the tower, the blades in front are angled forwards slightly so as to avoid hitting the rear ones. If the turbine blades are on opposite sides of the tower, it is best that the blades at the back be smaller than the blades at the front and set to stall at a higher wind speed. This allows the generator to function at a wider wind speed range than a single-turbine generator for a given tower. To reduce [[Sympathetic resonance|sympathetic vibrations]], the two turbines should turn at speeds with few common multiples, for example 7:3 speed ratio.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

When land or sea area for a second wind turbine does not come at a premium the 40% gain with a second rotor has to be compared with a 100% gain via the expense of a separate foundation and tower with cabling for the second turbine. {{As of|2005}}, no large practical counter-rotating HAWTs are commercially sold.

=== Furling tail and twisting blades===
In addition to variable pitch blades, furling tails and twisting blades are other improvements on wind turbines. Similar to the variable pitch blades, they may also greatly increase the efficiency of the turbine and be used in "do-it-yourself" construction&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rebelwolf.com/essn/ESSN-Aug2005.pdf Furling tail windturbines] (page 18) PDF&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Wind-mill style===
[[De Nolet]] is a wind turbine in Rotterdam disguised as a [[windmill]].

== Fuller ==

The "Fuller" wind turbine is a fully enclosed wind turbine that uses boundary layers instead of blades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/bladeless-wind-turbines/14977/ Fuller wind turbine]&lt;/ref&gt; Much like a [[Tesla turbine]].

The concept is similar to a stack of disks on a central shaft, separated by a small air gap. The surface tension of air through the small gaps creates friction, making the disks rotate around the shaft. Vanes help direct the air for improved performance, hence it is not totally bladeless.

== Aerial ==
[[File:Airborne wind generator-en.svg|thumb|Concept for an airborne wind generator]]
{{Main article|Airborne wind turbine|High-altitude wind power|Crosswind Kite Power}}

It has been demonstrated that wind turbines could be flown in high-speed winds using [[high altitude wind power]] tactics, taking advantage of the  winds at high altitudes. A system of automatically controlled tethered kites&lt;ref&gt;[http://kiteenergysystems.com Kite Energy Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; could also be used to capture energy from high-altitude winds.

== H-rotor ==
{{main article | Giromill }}
This is a vertical axis turbine, but it isn't favored because of its poor efficiency. One blade is pushed by the wind while the other is being pushed in the opposite direction. Consequently, only one blade is working at a time.{{citation needed|reason=The previous reference didn't support this paragraph; is this really accurate?|date=June 2015}}

== INVELOX ==
SheerWind's INVELOX technology was developed by Dr. Daryoush Allaei. The invention is really not a turbine, rather a wind capturing and delivery system to a turbine. In a sense, INVELOX is a wind injection system, much like a fuel injection system for cars. It works by accelerating the wind. A large intake captures wind, funnels it down using tapered pipes leading to a concentrator that ends in a Venturi section and finally wind exits from a diffuser. Turbine(s) are placed inside the Venturi section of the INVELOX. Inside the Venturi the dynamic pressure is very high while the static pressure is low. The Turbine converts dynamic pressure or kinetic energy to mechanical rotation and thereby to electrical power using a generator.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/508136/ducted-wind-turbines-an-energy-game-changer/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://sheerwind.com&lt;/ref&gt; The device has been constructed and tested, but also criticized for lack of efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cleantechnica.com/2014/07/08/invelox-ducted-turbine-latest-long-line-failures/ |title=Sheerwind Invelox: All Hype, No Substance|work=CleanTechnica |date=8 July 2014|accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{asof|2017}}, prototypes are being installed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://wwmt.com/news/local/strange-structure-at-fort-custer-harnesses-wind-power |title=Strange structure at Fort Custer harnesses wind power|work=WWMT |date=16 March 2016|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nedpowerswh.com/nieuws/ |title=Nieuws - NedpowerSWH|work=NedpowerSWH |accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another is inoperable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://ing.dk/artikel/vindturbinen-skulle-vaere-revolution-nu-staar-stille-191983 |title=Vindturbinen skulle være en revolution: Nu står den stille|work=[[Ingeniøren]] |date=18 January 2017|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Saphonian==

The Saphonian design produced by Tunisian startup Saphon Energy uses a dish to generate wind pressure and back-and-forth motion that drives a piston.&lt;ref&gt;http://newatlas.com/saphonian-bladeless-wind-turbine/24890/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kcet.org/redefine/bladeless-wind-turbine-too-good-to-be-true&lt;/ref&gt;

== Windbeam ==

Zephyr Energy Corporation’s patented Windbeam micro generator captures energy from airflow to recharge batteries and power electronic devices. The Windbeam’s novel design allows it to operate silently in wind speeds as low as 2&amp;nbsp;mph. The generator consists of a lightweight beam suspended by durable long-lasting springs within an outer frame. The beam oscillates rapidly when exposed to airflow due to the effects of multiple fluid flow phenomena. A linear alternator assembly converts the oscillating beam motion into usable electrical energy. A lack of bearings and gears eliminates frictional inefficiencies and noise. The generator can operate in low-light environments unsuitable for solar panels (e.g. HVAC ducts) and is inexpensive due to low cost components and simple construction. The scalable technology can be optimized to satisfy the energy requirements and design constraints of a given application.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zephyrenergy.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wind belt ==
{{Main article|windbelt}}

Invented by Shawn Frayne. A tensioned but flexible belt vibrates by the passing flow of air, due to aeroelastic flutter. A magnet, mounted at one end of the belt translates in and out of coiled windings producing electricity.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Logan.

== Vortex bladeless ==

The [[Vortex Bladeless]] device deliberately maximizes [[vortex shedding]], converting wind energy to fluttering of a lightweight vertical pole, then captures that energy with a generator at the bottom of the pole.

{{main article|Wind turbines on public display}}

Most wind turbines around the world belong to individuals or corporations who use them to generate electric power or to perform mechanical work. As such, wind turbines are primarily working devices. However, the large size and height above surroundings of modern industrial wind turbines, combined with their moving rotors, often makes them conspicuous. A few localities have exploited the attention-getting nature of wind turbines, either by putting visitor centers on their bases, or by providing viewing areas.&lt;ref name="wind_farm_tourism"&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/business/story.html?id=63a5438a-ae99-4b76-9629-b7b59d238932 | title = Canada wind farms blow away turbine tourists | publisher = [[Edmonton Journal]] | accessdate = 2008-09-06 | last = Young | date = 2007-08-03 | first = Kathryn | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090425064111/http://www2.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/business/story.html?id=63a5438a-ae99-4b76-9629-b7b59d238932 | archivedate = 2009-04-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The wind turbines themselves are generally of conventional horizontal-axis, three-bladed design, and generate power to feed electrical grids, but they also serve the unconventional roles of technology demonstration, public relations, and education.

== Rooftop wind-turbines ==

Wind-turbines can be installed on roofs of buildings, but this is less common than one might expect. Some examples include [[Marthalen Landi-Silo]] in Switzerland, [[Council House 2]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. Ridgeblade in the UK is like a vertical wind turbine on its side mounted on the apex of a pitched roof. While the Ridgeblade is still in the design stage another example like this, already available in France is the Aeolta AeroCube. [[Discovery Tower]] is an office building in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], that incorporates 10 wind turbines in its architecture.

The [[Museum of Science, Boston|Museum of Science]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] began constructing a rooftop Wind Turbine Lab in 2009.&lt;ref name="rooftop_turbine_lab"&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/06/new-us-rooftop-wind-turbine-lab | title = New US Rooftop Wind Turbine Lab | date = 2009-06-01 | accessdate = 2009-07-07 | publisher = Renewable Energy World }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lab is testing nine wind turbines from five different manufacturers. Rooftop wind turbines may suffer from turbulence, especially in cities, which reduces power output and accelerates turbine wear.&lt;ref name="home_turbines"&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article706123.ece | title = Home wind turbines dealt killer blow | publisher = [[The Sunday Times]] | first = Jonathan | last = Leake | date = 2006-04-16 | accessdate = 2009-07-13 | location = London }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lab seeks to address the general lack of performance data for urban wind turbines.&lt;ref name="rooftop_turbine_lab" /&gt;

Due to structural limitations of buildings, limited space in urban areas, and safety considerations, wind turbines mounted on buildings are usually small (with nameplate capacities in the low [[kilowatt]]s), rather than the [[megawatt]]-class wind turbines that are most economical for [[wind farm]]s. An exception is the [[Bahrain World Trade Centre]] with three 225&amp;nbsp;kW wind turbines mounted between twin skyscrapers.

In a simple [[resistive circuit]], a reduction in the [[voltage]] across the resistance will result in a reduction in the [[Electric power|power]] dissipated by the [[Electrical network|circuit]].

==Electric utilities==
[[Electric utilities]] have discovered that this basic principle can save utility companies, and their customers, a significant amount of money. Utilities are able to shave the peak of their power demand curves by reducing the voltage across their distribution system. When a utility reaches a point where power demand is expected to exceed supply, utilities only have two options. Either purchase power from another utility, usually at substantial prices, or reduce demand. Often utilities use load management systems to turn off customers' [[air conditioners]], [[water heater]]s, and pool pumps to reduce demand.  Voltage reduction has become another option for utilities to reduce demand&amp;mdash;typically unbeknownst to the customer. However, only the resistive portion of the load responds to the reduction in voltage to reduce aggregate demand. Loads such as [[incandescent lights]] and heater coils will use less power as the voltage is lowered. On the other hand, [[induction motor]] loads are unaffected by the reduction in voltage, because the current simply rises to account for no change or even a slight increase in power consumption.

Even some resistive loads provide only short-term benefits. A phenomenon known as load diversity plays a role in voltage reduction and can counteract its effects on occasion. The concept of load diversity can most easily be explained with an example. In your neighborhood, it is unlikely that all of the homes' water heaters are on at the same time. Particularly during non-hot water usage hours (morning and evening showers), when your hot water heater is on, your neighbor's may be off. Due to the distributed and noncoincident nature of these loads, the aggregate peak can remain relatively constant. However, if the voltage is reduced to all of the resistive elements in the water heaters, the elements will not be able to heat the water as quickly. While an immediate reduction in the power demand will be recognized upon initiating voltage reduction, over time water heaters will need to be on longer to achieve the thermostat-set water temperature. Thus, more water heaters will be on at the same time. This will cause the aggregate peak to increase substantially. Therefore, with respect to thermostat controlled resistive loads the benefits of voltage reduction can be short lived, and may occasionally end up increasing the aggregate load demand.

Conversely increasing the voltage may increase power demand from the resistive loads.  Again, the thermostat-controlled resistive loads will react differently, but it is clear that it will cost a customer more to turn on that incandescent reading lamp with higher voltage than it would at a lower voltage.

'''''World-Wide Volkswagen Corp v. Woodson''''', 444 U.S. 286 (1980), is a [[United States Supreme Court]] case involving strict [[products liability]], [[personal injury]] and various procedural issues and considerations. The 1980 opinion, written by [[Byron Raymond White|Justice Byron White]], is included in the first-year [[civil procedure]] [[curriculum]] at nearly every [[United States|American]] [[law school]] for its focus on [[personal jurisdiction]].

==Background==

===Accident===
Harry and Kay Robinson purchased a new [[Audi]] [[Audi 100|100 LS]] automobile from Seaway Volkswagen, Inc. in [[Massena (town), New York|Massena]], [[New York (state)|New York]], in 1976.&lt;ref name="law101"&gt;{{Cite news
  | title = Law 101: Everything You Need to Know about the American Legal System
  | publisher = ''Oxford University Post''
  | year = 2006

  | accessdate = 2008-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, as Kay Robinson passed through [[Oklahoma]] on [[Interstate 44]] en route to the Robinsons' new home in [[Arizona]], the Audi was struck from the rear by a drunk driver in a 1971 [[Ford Torino]]. The impact of the collision itself did not directly injure any of the Robinsons, but the crash resulted in the Audi's doors jamming shut and a puncture in the car's [[gas tank]]. A fire then severely burned the trapped Kay Robinson and her two children riding in the Audi, Eva and Sam.&lt;ref name="law101"/&gt;

===Lawsuit===
The Robinsons did not bring a suit against Lloyd Hull, the [[drunk driver]]. He had no [[insurance]] or [[assets]] and was therefore [[judgment proof]]. The Robinsons claimed that a product defect in the [[car]] led to the injuries they sustained&amp;mdash;specifically, the Audi's gas tank was located beneath the [[Trunk (automobile)|trunk]], in an area that the Robinsons claimed was susceptible to being punctured and igniting in a [[rear-end collision]]. They brought suit against the automobile’s [[manufacturer]] (Audi), its [[importer]] (Volkswagen of America), its regional [[distributor]] (World-Wide Volkswagen Corp.), and its [[retailer]] [[Car dealership|dealer]] (Seaway Volkswagen).&lt;ref name="law101"/&gt;

The Robinsons' Oklahoma attorney brought the lawsuit in state court in [[Creek County, Oklahoma]], the county in which the accident had occurred. Creek County was at that time known as home to some of the most plaintiff sympathetic juries in the country.&lt;ref name="law101"/&gt;  However, since the lawsuit met requirements for [[concurrent jurisdiction]] in both state and federal court, Audi and [[Volkswagen]] would have had the ability to ask for the case to be [[Removal jurisdiction|removed]] from state court in Creek County and taken directly to [[United States district court|federal court]]. One of the factors which governs concurrent jurisdiction is [[Diversity jurisdiction|diversity of citizenship]], or whether a defendant and plaintiff are from the same state. In the case of multiple defendants, if one defendants' state [[citizenship]] matches the plaintiff's, concurrent federal jurisdiction does not apply and the case cannot be removed to federal court unless the case concerns a matter of federal law. It has therefore been stated that the reason the Robinsons' attorney added the New York regional distributor and New York dealership as defendants was to prevent Audi and Volkswagen from being able to remove the case from what was generally seen as a Creek County pro-plaintiffs' jury to what would be a federal court jury in [[Tulsa]] that might be more sympathetic to the car manufacturers' case.&lt;ref name="law101"/&gt;  The Robinsons had not yet completed a move to Arizona, so they were still considered to be legal residents of New York.

The Robinsons first sued only [[Volkswagen of America]], World-Wide, and Seaway. They later amended the suit to include Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft ([[Volkswagen AG]]), the German parent company. A second amendment was included after they learned during formal discovery that Audi NSU Auto Union Aktiengesellschaft (Audi AG) was the manufacturing parent company rather than Volkswagen AG; they substituted Audi AG for Volkswagen AG.&lt;ref name="law101"/&gt;

When they were brought in as defendants in the case, World-Wide and Seaway claimed that Oklahoma’s exercise of personal or ''in personam'' jurisdiction over them would offend the limitations on states' jurisdiction imposed by the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of the United States]]; they asked to be removed from the suit. Audi and Volkswagen, which sold cars in the state of Oklahoma, did not attempt to assert that the Oklahoma state court had no jurisdiction over them.&lt;ref name="law101"/&gt;

==Issue==
Whether Seaway Volkswagen and Worldwide Volkswagen had sufficient [[minimum contacts]] with Oklahoma, such that these defendants would be subject to the jurisdiction of the Oklahoma state courts.

==Lower courts' decisions==

The United States Supreme Court excerpts the reasoning of the Oklahoma Supreme Court in affirming that Oklahoma's [[long-arm statute]] provides for jurisdiction over World Wide and Seaway. "...the product being sold and distributed by the petitioners [World-Wide and Seaway] is by its very design and purpose so mobile that petitioners can foresee its possible use in Oklahoma. This is especially true of the distributor [Seaway], who has the exclusive right to distribute such automobile in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. The evidence presented below demonstrated that goods sold and distributed by the petitioners were used in the State of Oklahoma, and under the facts we believe it reasonable to infer, given the retail value of the automobile, that the petitioners derive substantial income from automobiles which from time to time are used in the State of Oklahoma. This being the case, we hold that under the facts presented, the trial court was justified in concluding that the petitioners derive substantial revenue from goods used or consumed in this State."&lt;ref&gt; World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286 (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

The emphasis on "substantial revenue" comes from the relevant long-arm statute, since repealed, stating that a court can exercise jurisdiction over persons (corporate or natural) who cause injury in Oklahoma and derive, "...substantial revenue from goods used or consumed or services rendered, in this state..." 

The district court rejected World-Wide and Seaway's constitutional claim and reaffirmed that original ruling in denying petitioners’ motion for reconsideration.

==Supreme Court decision==
The United States Supreme Court reversed the decision of the federal appeals court and agreed with World-Wide and Seaway that Oklahoma did not have jurisdiction over them.

The Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment limits the power of a state court to exercise personal or ''in personam'' jurisdiction against a nonresident defendant.  A state court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident only so long as there exist "[[minimum contacts]]" between the defendant and the forum state.

The court stated that the concept of minimum contacts can be seen to perform two related but distinguishable functions. It protects the defendant against the burdens of litigating in a distant or inconvenient forum and it acts to ensure that the States, through their courts, do not reach out beyond the limits imposed on them by their status as coequal sovereigns in a federal system.

The 14th Amendment provides protection against inconvenient litigation, typically described in terms of “reasonableness” or “fairness”: “Does not offend ‘traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.” The relationship between the defendant and forum must be “reasonable.” The burden on the defendant is to be balanced against other factors, including the plaintiff’s interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief.

The due process clause “does not contemplate that a state may make binding a judgment in personam against an individual or corporate defendant with which the state has no contacts, ties or relations.” Even if the defendant would suffer minimal or no inconvenience from being forced to litigate before the tribunals of another state, even if the forum state has a strong interest in applying its law to the controversy, and even if the forum state is the most convenient location for litigation, the Due Process Clause may sometimes act to divest the state of its power to render a valid judgment.

The petitioners' contentions were deemed correct by the Supreme Court, which agreed that the two corporations did not have minimum contacts in Oklahoma, did not avail themselves of any of the privileges or benefits of Oklahoma law; Oklahoma therefore had no jurisdiction over the two companies.

The Robinson's counterclaim and Justice Brennan's dissenting opinion were based on foreseeability &amp;ndash; a car sold in New York is mobile, and therefore it was ''foreseeable'' by World-Wide and Seaway that a car sold by them could subsequently lead to an injury in Oklahoma. The majority opinion of the Supreme Court rejected this argument, saying that foreseeability alone could not provide the basis for personal jurisdiction over a defendant and the two petitioning companies had no other contacts with Oklahoma.&lt;ref name="law101"/&gt;

==Subsequent litigation==
With World-Wide and Seaway unable to be held as defendants in the Robinsons' case against Audi and Volkswagen, the case now had diversity of citizenship and was concurrently eligible for both state and federal court. Audi and Volkswagen removed the case from Creek County into [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma|federal district court]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], where a jury sided with the two car companies.&lt;ref name="law101"/&gt; The Tulsa jury indicated that they believed the speed of Lloyd Hull's car, rather than the Audi's gas tank, was responsible for the fire.&lt;ref name="law101"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2235">In [[combustion]], '''Zel'dovich–Liñán model''' is a two-step reaction model for the combustion processes, named after [[Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich]] and [[Amable Liñán]]. The model includes a chain-branching and a chain-breaking (or radical recombination) reaction. The model was first introduced by [[Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich|Zel'dovich]] in 1948&lt;ref&gt;Zeldovich, Y. B. (1948). K teorii rasprostraneniya plameni. Zhurnal Fizicheskoi Khimii, 22(1), 27-48.&lt;/ref&gt; and later analysed by [[Amable Liñán|Liñán]] using [[activation energy asymptotics]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Liñán, A. (1971).

where &lt;math&gt;\rm{F}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[fuel]], &lt;math&gt;\rm{X}&lt;/math&gt; is an intermediate [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]], &lt;math&gt;\rm{M}&lt;/math&gt; is the third body and &lt;math&gt;\rm{P}&lt;/math&gt; is the product. The first reaction is the chain-branching reaction, which is considered to be auto-catalytic (consumes no heat or releases no heat), with very large [[activation energy]] and the second reaction is the chain-breaking (or radical-recombination) reaction, where all of the heat in the combustion is released, with almost negligible [[activation energy]].&lt;ref&gt;Gubernov, V.

{{Infobox zinc}}

'''Zinc''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Zn''' and atomic number 30. It is the first element in [[group 12 element|group 12]] of the [[periodic table]]. In some respects zinc is chemically similar to [[magnesium]]: both elements exhibit only one normal oxidation state (+2), and the Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; [[ion]]s are of similar size. Zinc is the 24th most abundant [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|element in Earth's crust]] and has five stable [[isotope]]s. The most common zinc [[ore]] is [[sphalerite]] (zinc blende), a [[zinc sulfide]] mineral. The largest workable lodes are in Australia, Asia, and the United States. Zinc is refined by [[froth flotation]] of the [[ore]], [[Roasting (metallurgy)|roasting]], and final [[extractive metallurgy|extraction]] using [[electricity]] ([[electrowinning]]).

[[Brass]], an [[alloy]] of [[copper]] and zinc in various proportions, was used as early as the third millennium BC in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], [[Iraq]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Kalmykia]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and the second millennium BC in [[West India]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Iran]], [[Syria]], Iraq, and [[Israel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.safarmer.com/Indo-Eurasian/Brass2007.pdf|title=Of brass and bronze in prehistoric Southwest Asia|last=Thornton|first=C.

The element was probably named by the alchemist [[Paracelsus]] after the German word ''Zinke'' (prong, tooth). German chemist [[Andreas Sigismund Marggraf]] is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746. Work by [[Luigi Galvani]] and [[Alessandro Volta]] uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800. [[Corrosion]]-resistant [[galvanization|zinc plating]] of iron ([[hot-dip galvanizing]]) is the major application for zinc. Other applications are in electrical [[Zinc–carbon battery|batteries]], small non-structural castings, and alloys such as [[brass]]. A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used, such as [[zinc carbonate]] and [[zinc gluconate]] (as dietary supplements), [[zinc chloride]] (in deodorants), [[zinc pyrithione]] (anti-[[dandruff]] shampoos), [[zinc sulfide]] (in luminescent paints), and zinc methyl or [[zinc diethyl]] in the organic laboratory.

==Characteristics==

===Physical properties===
Zinc is a bluish-white, lustrous, [[diamagnetic]] metal,&lt;ref name="CRCp4-41"/&gt; though most common commercial grades of the metal have a dull finish.&lt;ref name="Heiserman1992p123"&gt;{{harvnb|Heiserman|1992|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is somewhat less dense than [[iron]] and has a hexagonal [[crystal structure]], with a distorted form of [[Close-packing of equal spheres|hexagonal close packing]], in which each atom has six nearest neighbors (at 265.9 pm) in its own plane and six others at a greater distance of 290.6 pm.&lt;ref&gt;Wells A.F.

Many [[alloy]]s contain zinc, including brass. Other metals long known to form binary alloys with zinc are [[aluminium]], [[antimony]], [[bismuth]], [[gold]], [[iron]], [[lead]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[silver]], [[tin]], [[magnesium]], [[cobalt]], [[nickel]], [[tellurium]], and [[sodium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Production and Properties of Zinc: A Treatise on the Occurrence and Distribution of Zinc Ore, the Commercial and Technical Conditions Affecting the Production of the Spelter, Its Chemical and Physical Properties and Uses in the Arts, Together with a Historical and Statistical Review of the Industry|last=Ingalls|first=Walter Renton|publisher=The Engineering and Mining Journal|date=1902|pages=142–6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RhNDAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although neither zinc nor [[zirconium]] are [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]], their alloy {{chem|ZrZn|2}} exhibits ferromagnetism below 35&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]].&lt;ref name="CRCp4-41"/&gt;

===Occurrence===
{{See also|:Category:Zinc minerals|l1=Zinc minerals}}
Zinc makes up about 75&amp;nbsp;[[Parts per million|ppm]]&amp;nbsp;(0.0075%) of [[Earth's crust]], making it the 24th most abundant element. Soil contains zinc in 5–770&amp;nbsp;ppm with an average 64&amp;nbsp;ppm.

[[Sulfide]]s formed as the crust solidified under the [[redox|reducing]] conditions of the early Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Greenwood1997p1202"&gt;{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|p=1202}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sphalerite]], which is a form of zinc sulfide, is the most heavily mined zinc-containing ore because its concentrate contains 60–62% zinc.&lt;ref name="Lehto1968p822"/&gt;

Other source minerals for zinc include [[smithsonite]] (zinc [[carbonate]]), [[hemimorphite]] (zinc [[silicate]]), [[wurtzite]] (another zinc sulfide), and sometimes [[hydrozincite]] (basic [[zinc carbonate]]).&lt;ref name="Emsley2001p502"/&gt; With the exception of wurtzite, all these other minerals were formed by weathering of the primordial zinc sulfides.&lt;ref name="Greenwood1997p1202"/&gt;

Since exploration and mine development is an ongoing process, the amount of zinc reserves is not a fixed number and sustainability of zinc ore supplies cannot be judged by simply extrapolating the combined mine life of today's zinc mines. This concept is well supported by data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which illustrates that although refined zinc production increased 80% between 1990 and 2010, the reserve lifetime for zinc has remained unchanged. About 346 million tonnes have been extracted throughout history to 2002, and scholars have estimated that about 109–305 million tonnes are in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gordon|first=R.

===Reactivity===
{{see also|Clemmensen reduction}}
Zinc has an [[electron configuration]] of [Ar]3d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;4s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and is a member of the [[group 12 element|group 12]] of the [[periodic table]]. It is a moderately reactive metal and strong [[reducing agent]].&lt;ref name=CRC2006p8-29&gt;{{harvnb|CRC|2006|pp='''8'''–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surface of the pure metal [[tarnish]]es quickly, eventually forming a protective [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivating]] layer of the basic [[Hydrozincite|zinc carbonate]], {{chem|Zn|5|(OH)|6|(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)|2}}, by reaction with atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher=CRC Press|date=1994|page=121|isbn=0-8247-9213-0|title=Corrosion Resistance of Zinc and Zinc Alloys| first=Frank C.|last=Porter}}&lt;/ref&gt; This layer helps prevent further reaction with air and water.

Zinc burns in air with a bright bluish-green flame, giving off fumes of [[zinc oxide]].&lt;ref name="Holl"/&gt; Zinc reacts readily with [[acid]]s, [[alkali]]s and other non-metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hinds|first=John Iredelle Dillard|title=Inorganic Chemistry: With the Elements of Physical and Theoretical Chemistry|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York|date=1908|edition=2nd|pages=506–508|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xMUMAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extremely pure zinc reacts only slowly at [[room temperature]] with acids.&lt;ref name="Holl"/&gt; Strong acids, such as [[hydrochloric acid|hydrochloric]] or [[sulfuric acid]], can remove the passivating layer and subsequent reaction with water releases hydrogen gas.&lt;ref name="Holl"/&gt;

The chemistry of zinc is dominated by the +2 oxidation state.

Zinc chemistry is similar to the chemistry of the late first-row transition metals, [[nickel]] and copper, though it has a filled d-shell and compounds are [[diamagnetic]] and mostly colorless.&lt;ref name="Greenwood1997p1206"/&gt; The [[ionic radii]] of zinc and magnesium happen to be nearly identical.

Zinc tends to form bonds with a greater degree of [[covalency]] and much more stable [[Complex (chemistry)|complexes]] with [[nitrogen|N]]- and [[sulfur|S]]- donors.&lt;ref name="Greenwood1997p1206"&gt;{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|p=1206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complexes of zinc are mostly 4- or 6- [[coordinate covalent bond|coordinate]] although 5-coordinate complexes are known.&lt;ref name="Holl"/&gt;

===Zinc(I) compounds===
Zinc(I) compounds are rare and need bulky ligands to stabilize the low oxidation state. Most zinc(I) compounds contain formally the [Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; core, which is analogous to the [Hg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dimeric cation present in [[mercury (element)|mercury]](I) compounds. The [[diamagnetism|diamagnetic]] nature of the ion confirms its dimeric structure. The first zinc(I) compound containing the Zn–Zn bond, [[Decamethyldizincocene|(η&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], is also the first [[metallocene|dimetallocene]].

Some alchemists called this zinc oxide ''lana philosophica'', Latin for "philosopher's wool", because it collected in wooly tufts, whereas others thought it looked like white snow and named it ''nix album''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Arny|first=Henry Vinecome|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gRNKAAAAMAAJ|title=Principles of Pharmacy|publisher=W.

The name of the metal was probably first documented by [[Paracelsus]], a Swiss-born German alchemist, who referred to the metal as "zincum" or "zinken" in his book ''Liber Mineralium II'', in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="iza" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Georgius Agricola de Re Metallica|first=Herbert Clark|last=Hoover|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|date=2003|page=409|isbn=0-7661-3197-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is probably derived from the German {{lang|de|zinke}}, and supposedly meant "tooth-like, pointed or jagged" (metallic zinc crystals have a needle-like appearance).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|last=Gerhartz|display-authors=etal |edition=5th|date=1996|isbn=3-527-20100-9|publisher=VHC|page=509|first=Wolfgang}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Zink'' could also imply "tin-like" because of its relation to German ''zinn'' meaning tin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Skeat, W.

Flemish [[metallurgist]] and [[alchemist]] [[P. M. de Respour]] reported that he had extracted metallic zinc from zinc oxide in 1668.&lt;ref name="Emsley2001p502"/&gt; By the start of the 18th century, [[Étienne François Geoffroy]] described how zinc oxide condenses as yellow crystals on bars of iron placed above zinc ore that is being smelted.&lt;ref name="Emsley2001p502"/&gt; In Britain, [[John Lane (metallurgist)|John Lane]] is said to have carried out experiments to smelt zinc, probably at [[Landore]], prior to his bankruptcy in 1726.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roberts|first=R.

In 1738 in Great Britain, [[William Champion (metallurgist)|William Champion]] patented a process to extract zinc from calamine in a vertical [[retort]] style smelter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Comyns|first=Alan E.|title=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Named Processes in Chemical Technology|edition=3rd|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0-8493-9163-6|date=2007|page=71|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Jlq-ckWvQSQC}}&lt;/ref&gt; His technique resembled that used at Zawar zinc mines in [[Rajasthan]], but no evidence suggests he visited the Orient.&lt;ref name=zinc-eng&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Rhys|last=Jenkins|title=The Zinc Industry in England: the early years up to 1850|journal=Transactions of the Newcomen Society|volume=25|date=1945|pages=41–52|doi=10.1179/tns.1945.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Champion's process was used through 1851.&lt;ref name="iza" /&gt;

German chemist [[Andreas Sigismund Marggraf|Andreas Marggraf]] normally gets credit for discovering pure metallic zinc, even though Swedish chemist Anton von Swab had distilled zinc from calamine four years previously.&lt;ref name="iza" /&gt; In his 1746 experiment, Marggraf heated a mixture of calamine and charcoal in a closed vessel without copper to obtain a metal.&lt;ref name="Weeks1933p21"/&gt; This procedure became commercially practical by 1752.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heiserman|1992|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galvani's friend, [[Alessandro Volta]], continued researching the effect and invented the [[Voltaic pile]] in 1800.&lt;ref name="ExcelPhysics"/&gt; The basic unit of Volta's pile was a simplified [[galvanic cell]], made of plates of copper and zinc separated by an [[electrolyte]] and connected by a conductor externally. The units were stacked in series to make the Voltaic cell, which produced electricity by directing [[electron]]s from the zinc to the copper and allowing the zinc to corrode.&lt;ref name="ExcelPhysics"/&gt;

The non-magnetic character of zinc and its lack of color in solution delayed discovery of its importance to biochemistry and nutrition.&lt;ref name=Cotton1999p626/&gt; This changed in 1940 when [[carbonic anhydrase]], an enzyme that scrubs carbon dioxide from blood, was shown to have zinc in its [[active site]].&lt;ref name=Cotton1999p626/&gt; The digestive enzyme [[carboxypeptidase]] became the second known zinc-containing enzyme in 1955.&lt;ref name=Cotton1999p626&gt;{{harvnb|Cotton|1999|p=626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide, 95% of new zinc is mined from [[sulfide|sulfidic]] ore deposits, in which sphalerite (ZnS) is nearly always mixed with the sulfides of copper, lead and iron.&lt;ref name="Zinchand"/&gt;&lt;!-- page 6 --&gt; Zinc mines are scattered throughout the world, with the main areas being China, Australia, and Peru. China produced 38% of the global zinc output in 2014.&lt;ref name=USGSMCS2015/&gt;

Zinc metal is produced using [[extractive metallurgy]].&lt;ref name="Rosenqvist1922"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles of Extractive Metallurgy|last=Rosenqvist|first=Terkel|pages=7, 16, 186|edition=2nd|date=1922|isbn=82-519-1922-3|publisher=Tapir Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- page 7 --&gt; The ore is finely ground, then put through [[froth flotation]] to separate minerals from [[gangue]] (on the property of [[hydrophobicity]]), to get a zinc sulfide ore concentrate&lt;ref name="Rosenqvist1922"/&gt;&lt;!-- page 186 --&gt; consisting of about 50% zinc, 32% sulfur, 13% iron, and 5% {{chem|SiO|2}}.&lt;ref name="Rosenqvist1922"/&gt;&lt;!-- page 16 --&gt;

:2 ZnS + 3 {{chem|O|2}} → 2 ZnO + 2 {{chem|SO|2}}

The sulfur dioxide is used for the production of sulfuric acid, which is necessary for the leaching process. If deposits of zinc carbonate, zinc silicate, or zinc spinel (like the [[Skorpion Zinc|Skorpion Deposit]] in Namibia) are used for zinc production, the roasting can be omitted.&lt;ref name="Skorpion"&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Economic Geology|date=2003|volume=98|issue=4|page=749|doi=10.2113/98.4.749|title=Geology of the Skorpion Supergene Zinc Deposit, Southern Namibia|first=Gregor|last=Borg|author2=Kärner, Katrin |author3=Buxton, Mike |author4=Armstrong, Richard |author5= van der Merwe, Schalk W. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For further processing two basic methods are used: [[pyrometallurgy]] or [[electrowinning]]. Pyrometallurgy reduces zinc oxide with [[carbon]] or [[carbon monoxide]] at {{convert|950|C|F|abbr=on}} into the metal, which is distilled as zinc vapor to separate it from other metals, which are not volatile at those temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bodsworth|first=Colin|title=The Extraction and Refining of Metals|page=148|date=1994|isbn=0-8493-4433-6|publisher=CRC Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The zinc vapor is collected in a condenser.&lt;ref name="Zinchand"/&gt; The equations below describe this process:&lt;ref name="Zinchand"/&gt;

:2 ZnO + C → 2 Zn + {{chem|CO|2}}
: ZnO + CO → Zn + {{chem|CO|2}}

In [[electrowinning]], zinc is leached from the ore concentrate by [[sulfuric acid]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hydrometallurgy in Extraction Processes|last=Gupta|first=C. K.|author2=Mukherjee, T. K. |page=62|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0-8493-6804-9|date=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:ZnO + {{chem|H|2|SO|4}} → {{chem|ZnSO|4}} + {{chem|H|2|O}}

:2 {{chem|ZnSO|4}} + 2 {{chem|H|2|O}} → 2 Zn + 2 {{chem|H|2|SO|4}} + {{chem|O|2}}

The sulfuric acid is regenerated and recycled to the leaching step.

When galvanised feedstock is fed to an [[electric arc furnace]], the zinc is recovered from the dust by a number of processes, predominately the [[Waelz process]] (90% as of 2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = Handbook of Recycling: State-of-the-art for Practitioners, Analysts, and Scientists|  editor-first = Ernst| editor-last =  Worrell| editor-first2= Markus|editor-last2= Reuter| date = 2014| chapter =9.

===Environmental impact===
Refinement of sulfidic zinc ores produces large volumes of sulfur dioxide and [[cadmium]] vapor. Smelter [[slag]] and other residues contain significant quantities of metals. About 1.1 million tonnes of metallic zinc and 130 thousand tonnes of lead were mined and smelted in the Belgian towns of [[Kelmis|La Calamine]] and [[Plombières]] between 1806 and 1882.&lt;ref name="Kucha"&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Environmental Geology|date=1996|volume=27|first=H.|last=Kucha|issue=1|author2=Martens, A.|author3=Ottenburgs, R.|author4=De Vos, W.|author5=Viaene, W.|title=Primary minerals of Zn-Pb mining and metallurgical dumps and their environmental behavior at Plombières, Belgium|doi=10.1007/BF00770598|pages=1–15|bibcode=1996EnGeo..27....1K}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dumps of the past mining operations leach zinc and cadmium, and the sediments of the [[Geul River]] contain non-trivial amounts of metals.&lt;ref name="Kucha"/&gt; About two thousand years ago, emissions of zinc from mining and smelting totaled 10 thousand tonnes a year. After increasing 10-fold from 1850, zinc emissions peaked at 3.4 million tonnes per year in the 1980s and declined to 2.7 million tonnes in the 1990s, although a 2005 study of the Arctic troposphere found that the concentrations there did not reflect the decline. Anthropogenic and natural emissions occur at a ratio of 20&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref name=Broadley2007/&gt;

Zinc is more reactive than iron or steel and thus will attract almost all local oxidation until it completely corrodes away.&lt;ref name=Stwertka1998p99&gt;{{harvnb|Stwertka|1998|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; A protective surface layer of oxide and carbonate ({{chem|Zn|5|(OH)|6|(CO|3|)|2|)}} forms as the zinc corrodes.&lt;ref name="Lehto1968p829"&gt;{{harvnb|Lehto|1968|p=829}}&lt;/ref&gt; This protection lasts even after the zinc layer is scratched but degrades through time as the zinc corrodes away.&lt;ref name="Lehto1968p829"/&gt; The zinc is applied electrochemically or as molten zinc by [[hot-dip galvanizing]] or spraying. Galvanization is used on chain-link fencing, guard rails, suspension bridges, lightposts, metal roofs, heat exchangers, and car bodies.&lt;ref name="Emsley2001p503"/&gt;

The relative reactivity of zinc and its ability to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient [[sacrificial anode]] in [[cathodic protection]] (CP). For example, cathodic protection of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting anodes made from zinc to the pipe.&lt;ref name="Lehto1968p829"/&gt; Zinc acts as the [[anode]] (negative terminus) by slowly corroding away as it passes electric current to the steel pipeline.&lt;ref name="Lehto1968p829"/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Electric current will naturally flow between zinc and steel but in some circumstances inert anodes are used with an external DC source.&lt;/ref&gt; Zinc is also used to cathodically protect metals that are exposed to sea water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A comparative study of the electrochemical behaviour of Algerian zinc and a zinc from a commercial sacrificial anode|last=Bounoughaz|first=M.|author2=Salhi, E.|author3=Benzine, K.|author4=Ghali E.|author5=Dalard F.|journal=Journal of Materials Science|volume =38|issue=6|pages=1139–1145|doi=10.1023/A:1022824813564|date=2003|bibcode = 2003JMatS..38.1139B }}&lt;/ref&gt; A zinc disc attached to a ship's iron rudder will slowly corrode while the rudder stays intact.&lt;ref name=Stwertka1998p99/&gt; Similarly, a zinc plug attached to a propeller or the metal protective guard for the keel of the ship provides temporary protection.

With a [[standard electrode potential]] (SEP) of −0.76 [[volt]]s, zinc is used as an anode material for batteries. (More reactive lithium (SEP −3.04 V) is used for anodes in [[Lithium battery|lithium batteries]] ).

===Alloys===
A widely used zinc alloy is brass, in which copper is alloyed with anywhere from 3% to 45% zinc, depending upon the type of brass.&lt;ref name="Lehto1968p829"/&gt; Brass is generally more [[ductile]] and stronger than copper, and has superior [[corrosion resistance]].&lt;ref name="Lehto1968p829"/&gt; These properties make it useful in communication equipment, hardware, musical instruments, and water valves.&lt;ref name="Lehto1968p829"/&gt;

[[File:Microstructure of rolled and annealed brass; magnification 400X.jpg|thumb|left|Cast brass microstructure at magnification 400x|alt=A mosaica pattern composed of components having various shapes and shades of brown.]]
Other widely used zinc alloys include [[nickel silver]], typewriter metal, soft and aluminium [[solder]], and commercial [[bronze]].&lt;ref name="CRCp4-41"/&gt; Zinc is also used in contemporary pipe organs as a substitute for the traditional lead/tin alloy in pipes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Douglas Earl|last=Bush|author2=Kassel, Richard |title=The Organ: An Encyclopedia|isbn=978-0-415-94174-7|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cgDJaeFFUPoC|publisher=Routledge|date=2006|page=679}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alloys of 85–88% zinc, 4–10% copper, and 2–8% aluminium find limited use in certain types of machine bearings.

Alloys of zinc with small amounts of copper, aluminium, and magnesium are useful in [[die casting]] as well as [[spin casting]], especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries.&lt;ref name="CRCp4-41"/&gt; These alloys are marketed under the name [[Zamak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eazall.com/diecastalloys.aspx|title=Diecasting Alloys|author=Eastern Alloys contributors|publisher=Eastern Alloys|accessdate=January 19, 2009|location=Maybrook, NY|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225003739/http://www.eazall.com/diecastalloys.aspx|archivedate=December 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is [[zinc aluminium]]. The low melting point together with the low [[viscosity]] of the alloy makes possible the production of small and intricate shapes.

Similar alloys with the addition of a small amount of lead can be cold-rolled into sheets. An alloy of 96% zinc and 4% aluminium is used to make stamping dies for low production run applications for which ferrous metal dies would be too expensive.&lt;ref name="samans"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Samans|first=Carl Hubert|title=Engineering Metals and Their Alloys|publisher=Macmillan Co.|date=1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; For building facades, roofing, and other applications for [[sheet metal]] formed by [[deep drawing]], [[roll forming]], or [[bending (metalworking)|bending]], zinc alloys with [[titanium]] and copper are used.&lt;ref name="ZincCorr"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=C-pAiedmqp8C|title=Corrosion Resistance of Zinc and Zinc Alloys|first=Frank|last=Porter|publisher =CRC Press|date=1994|isbn=978-0-8247-9213-8|chapter=Wrought Zinc|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unalloyed zinc is too brittle for these manufacturing processes.&lt;ref name="ZincCorr"/&gt;

In this reaction formation of diphenylzinc is accompanied by that of [[lithium chloride]], which if unchecked, catalyses the reaction without MIB involvement to the [[racemic]] [[alcohol]].

Zinc serves a purely structural role in [[zinc finger]]s, twists and clusters.&lt;ref name="Cotton1997p628"&gt;{{harvnb|Cotton|1999|p=628}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zinc fingers form parts of some [[transcription factor]]s, which are proteins that recognize [[DNA sequence|DNA base sequences]] during the replication and transcription of [[DNA]].

===Dietary recommendations===
The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for zinc in 2001. The current EARs for zinc for women and men ages 14 and up is 6.8 and 9.4&amp;nbsp;mg/day, respectively. The RDAs are 8 and 11&amp;nbsp;mg/day. RDAs are higher than EARs so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements. RDA for pregnancy is 11&amp;nbsp;mg/day. RDA for lactation is 12&amp;nbsp;mg/day. For infants up to 12 months the RDA is 3&amp;nbsp;mg/day. For children ages 1–13 years the RDA increases with age from 3 to 8&amp;nbsp;mg/day. As for safety, the IOM sets [[Tolerable upper intake level]]s (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of zinc the adult UL is 40&amp;nbsp;mg/day (lower for children). Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as [[Dietary Reference Intake]]s (DRIs).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nap.edu/read/10026/chapter/14/ "Zinc"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919234044/https://www.nap.edu/read/10026/chapter/14/ |date=September 19, 2017 }}, pp. 442–501 in ''Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin A, Vitamin K, Arsenic, Boron, Chromium, Copper, Iodine, Iron, Manganese, Molybdenum, Nickel, Silicon, Vanadium, and Zinc''. National Academy Press. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL are defined the same as in United States. For people ages 18 and older the PRI calculations are complex, as the EFSA has set higher and higher values as the [[phytate]] content of the diet increases. For women, PRIs increase from 7.5 to 12.7&amp;nbsp;mg/day as phytate intake increases from 300 to 1200&amp;nbsp;mg/day; for men the range is 9.4 to 16.3&amp;nbsp;mg/day. These PRIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Overview on Dietary Reference Values for the EU population as derived by the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies| year = 2017| url = https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/assets/DRV_Summary_tables_jan_17.pdf| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170828082247/https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/assets/DRV_Summary_tables_jan_17.pdf| archivedate = August 28, 2017| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EFSA reviewed the same safety question and set its UL at 25&amp;nbsp;mg/day, which is much lower than the U.S. value.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = Tolerable Upper Intake Levels For Vitamins And Minerals| publisher = European Food Safety Authority| year = 2006| url = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160316225123/http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf| archivedate = March 16, 2016| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV).

Animal products such as meat, fish, shellfish, fowl, eggs, and dairy contain zinc. The concentration of zinc in plants varies with the level in the soil. With adequate zinc in the soil, the food plants that contain the most zinc are wheat (germ and bran) and various seeds, including [[sesame]], [[poppy]], [[alfalfa]], [[celery]], and [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]].&lt;ref name="Ensminger1993"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ensminger|first=Audrey H.|author2=Konlande, James E. |title=Foods &amp; Nutrition Encyclopedia|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, Florida|date=1993|edition=2nd|pages=2368–2369|isbn=0-8493-8980-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XMA9gYIj-C4C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zinc is also found in [[bean]]s, [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[almond]]s, [[whole grain]]s, [[pumpkin seed]]s, [[sunflower seed]]s, and [[blackcurrant]].&lt;ref name="USDA_Zn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/Data/SR20/nutrlist/sr20w309.pdf |title=Zinc content of selected foods per common measure |accessdate=December 6, 2007 |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]] |work=USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Release 20 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305081926/http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/Data/SR20/nutrlist/sr20w309.pdf |archivedate=March 5, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plant [[phytate]]s are particularly found in pulses and cereals and interfere with zinc absorption.

===Deficiency===
{{Main|Zinc deficiency}}

Zinc deficiency is usually due to insufficient dietary intake, but can be associated with [[malabsorption]], [[acrodermatitis enteropathica]], chronic liver disease, chronic renal disease, sickle cell disease, diabetes, malignancy, and other chronic illnesses.&lt;ref name=Prasad2003/&gt; Groups at risk of zinc deficiency include the elderly, children in developing countries, and those with renal dysfunction.

In the United States, a federal survey of food consumption determined that for women and men over the age of 19, average consumption was 9.7 and 14.2&amp;nbsp;mg/day, respectively. For women, 17% consumed less than the EAR, for men 11%. The percentages below EAR increased with age.&lt;ref&gt;Moshfegh, Alanna; Goldman, Joseph; and Cleveland, Linda. (2005).

Substantial responses to zinc fertilization have been reported in these areas.&lt;ref name=Broadley2007/&gt; Plants that grow in soils that are zinc-deficient are more susceptible to disease. Zinc is added to the soil primarily through the weathering of rocks, but humans have added zinc through fossil fuel combustion, mine waste, phosphate fertilizers, pesticide ([[zinc phosphide]]), limestone, manure, sewage sludge, and particles from galvanized surfaces. Excess zinc is toxic to plants, although zinc toxicity is far less widespread.&lt;ref name=Broadley2007/&gt;

==Precautions==

===Toxicity===
Although zinc is an essential requirement for good health, excess zinc can be harmful. Excessive absorption of zinc suppresses copper and iron absorption.&lt;ref name=Fosmire1990/&gt; The free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to plants, invertebrates, and even vertebrate fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Contaminant Hazard Reviews |date=1993 |issue=10 |title=Zinc Hazard to Fish, Wildlife, and Invertebrates: A Synoptic Review |last=Eisler |first=Ronald |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service |location=Laurel, Maryland |url=http://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/infobase/eisler/chr_26_zinc.pdf |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306032807/http://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/infobase/eisler/chr_26_zinc.pdf |archivedate=March 6, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Free Ion Activity Model is well-established in the literature, and shows that just [[mole (unit)|micromolar]] amounts of the free ion kills some organisms. A recent example showed 6 micromolar killing 93% of all ''[[Daphnia]]'' in water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mechanisms of chronic waterborne Zn toxicity in Daphnia magna|first1=Brita T.

The free zinc ion is a powerful [[Lewis acid]] up to the point of being [[corrosive]]. Stomach acid contains [[hydrochloric acid]], in which metallic zinc dissolves readily to give corrosive zinc chloride.

Reports of anosmia were also observed in the 1930s when zinc preparations were used in a failed attempt to prevent [[polio]] infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=n24Pju7kHIYC&amp;pg=PA142|page=142|title=Conquest of viral diseases: a topical review of drugs and vaccines|author=Oxford, J.

The FDA said the loss of smell can be life-threatening because people with impaired smell cannot detect leaking gas or smoke, and cannot tell if food has spoiled before they eat it.&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jun/17/science/sci-zicam17|title=FDA says Zicam nasal products harm sense of smell|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=June 17, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621011505/http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jun/17/science/sci-zicam17|archivedate=June 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research suggests that the topical antimicrobial zinc pyrithione is a potent [[heat shock]] response inducer that may impair genomic integrity with induction of [[Poly ADP ribose polymerase|PARP]]-dependent energy crisis in cultured human [[keratinocyte]]s and [[melanocyte]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lamore SD |author2=Cabello CM |author3=Wondrak GT |title=The topical antimicrobial zinc pyrithione is a heat shock response inducer that causes DNA damage and PARP-dependent energy crisis in human skin cells |journal=Cell Stress Chaperones |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=309–22 |date=2010 |pmid=19809895 |doi=10.1007/s12192-009-0145-6 |pmc=2866994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poisoning===
In 1982, the [[United States Mint|US Mint]] began minting [[Cent (United States coin)|pennies]] coated in copper but containing primarily zinc. Zinc pennies pose a risk of zinc toxicosis, which can be fatal. One reported case of chronic ingestion of 425 pennies (over 1&amp;nbsp;kg of zinc) resulted in death due to gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal [[sepsis]]. Another patient who ingested 12&amp;nbsp;grams of zinc showed only [[lethargy]] and [[ataxia]] (gross lack of coordination of muscle movements).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Pennies and other small coins are sometimes ingested by dogs, requiring veterinary removal of the foreign objects. The zinc content of some coins can cause zinc toxicity, commonly fatal in dogs through severe [[hemolytic anemia]] and liver or kidney damage; vomiting and diarrhea are possible symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Zinc phosphide poisoning in dogs|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|volume=173|page=270|date=1978|pmid=689968|issue=3|last1=Stowe|first1=C.
