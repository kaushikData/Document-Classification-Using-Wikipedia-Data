'''Arsen Iqaltoeli''' or '''Arsen of Iqalto''' ({{lang-ka|არსენ იყალთოელი}}) (died c. 1127) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] churchman, calligrapher and religious author with noticeable role in the ecclesiastic life of Georgia in the reign of [[David IV of Georgia|David IV "the Builder"]] ([[reign|r.]] 1089—1125) with whom he collaborated in rearing the Georgian monastic academes. His formidable efforts at translating and compiling major doctrinal and polemical work from [[Greek language|Greek]] gave a novel impetus to the Georgian patristic and philosophical literature.&lt;ref name="Rayfield"&gt;[[Rayfield, Donald]] (2000), ''[[The Literature of Georgia: A History]]'', pp. 40, 90. [[Routledge]], {{ISBN|0-7007-1163-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Iqaltoeli is [[canonization|canonized]] by the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]], which commemorates him on February 6 (19).&lt;ref&gt;Machitadze, Archpriest Zakaria (2006), ''Lives of the Georgian Saints'', pp. 89-91. [[Herman of Alaska|St. Herman of Alaska Brotherhood]], {{ISBN|1-887904-10-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==

Arsen is apparently the same person as Arsen Vachesdze mentioned in several manuscripts. Furthermore, some Georgian scholars identify him with Arsen Beri (Arsenius "the Monk"; fl. 1100), the author of the metaphrastic revision of ''The Life of Saint Nino''. According to historic tradition Arsen was born in Iqalto in the province of Kakheti, east of Tbilisi, Georgia's modern capital. He was educated in Constantinople at the Mangana academy, the centre of Byzantine philosophical activity and classical learning, and served as a monk on the Black Mountain near [[Antioch]] under the tutelage of [[Ephrem Mtsire|Ephraim the Minor]]. Around 1114, Iqaltoeli, along with several other Georgian repatriate monks, responded to King David IV's call to join the reconstructed Georgian church. Along with [[Ioane Petritsi|John of Petrizos]], Iqaltoeli brought the Byzantine philosophical tradition to the newly founded Georgian academe at [[Gelati Monastery|Gelati]] and helped found a similar academy at Iqalto. Finally he established himself at the [[Shio-Mgvime monastery]] in Kakheti.&lt;ref name="Rayfield"/&gt;

Iqaltoeli probably played a key role in the debate between Armenian and Georgian churchmen organized by David IV in a futile attempt to reconcile doctrinal differences between the two churches in 1123. He outlived David and composed the king's [[epitaph]].&lt;ref name="Rayfield"/&gt;

Most of Iqaltoeli's work both abroad and in Georgia consists of translations of major doctrinal and polemical work, which he compiled as his massive ''Dogmatikon'', "a book of teachings", influenced by [[Aristotelianism]]. The most complete surviving manuscript of this work ([[Georgian National Center of Manuscripts|S-1463]]) dates to the 12th-13th century and includes sixteen key authors, such as [[Anastasius Sinaita]], [[John of Damascus]], [[Theodore Abucara]], [[Michael Psellos]], [[Cyril of Alexandria]], [[Nikitas Stithatos]], [[Pope Leo I|Pope Leo the Great]] and others.&lt;ref name="Rayfield"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khintibidze, Elguja (1996), ''Georgian-Byzantine Literary Contacts'', pp. 68-70. A.M. Hakkert, {{ISBN|90-256-0943-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this mode of [[science]] argue that unanticipated scientific breakthroughs are sometimes more valuable than the outcomes of agenda-driven research, heralding advances in [[genetics]] and [[stem cell]] biology as examples of unforeseen benefits of research that was originally seen as purely theoretical in scope. Because of the inherently uncertain [[return on investment]], blue-sky projects are politically and commercially unpopular and tend to lose funding to more reliably profitable or practical research.&lt;ref name="times 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article568223.ece|title=Politics clouds blue-sky science|work=The Times|date=September 19, 2005  | accessdate=April 26, 2010 | first=Mark | last=Henderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Support for blue skies research has varied over time, ultimately becoming subject to the political process, in countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foundation.org.uk/|title=To what extent should UK funding for science and innovation be focussed?|work=Foundation for Science and Technology  |accessdate=February 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and India. [[Vannevar Bush]]'s 1945 report, ''[https://www.nsf.gov/about/history/vbush1945.htm Science: The Endless Frontier]'', made the argument for the value of basic research in the postwar era, and was the basis for many appeals to the federal funding of basic research.&lt;ref name="smith 1997"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The 1957 launch of [[Sputnik]] prompted the United States [[Air Force Office of Scientific Research]] to sponsor blue skies research into the 1960s.&lt;ref name="jeffrey"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s, financial strains brought pressure on public expenditure on the sciences, first in the UK and the [[Netherlands]], and by the 1990s in [[Germany]] and the United States.&lt;ref name="smith 1997"/&gt;

In 1980, [[British Petroleum]] (known as BP after 2000) established a blue skies research initiative called the Venture Research Unit, headed by particle physicist [[Donald Braben]]. Braben controversially challenged [[peer review]] as the mechanism for establishing funding, emphasizing the selection of researchers whose proposals "could radically change the way we think about something important."&lt;ref name=" review 2004"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[Mark Walport]], director of the [[Wellcome Trust]] and former Professor of Medicine at [[Imperial College, London]] warned that excessive emphasis on agenda-driven research could jeopardise serendipitous advances in science:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Government is right to recognise the importance of science and technology, but I think it is a mistake to try to [[wikt:ringfence|ring-fence]] funds. There is a serious danger that we will spend money on projects that are less good. It is absolutely key that funding is used to support the best scientists with the best ideas.&lt;ref name="times 2005"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When UK [[research council]]s introduced a requirement that grant application include a 2-page statement on the economic impact of the proposed work, 20 scientists, including 1996 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Nobel laureate]] [[Harold Kroto]], wrote a public letter to ''[[Times Higher Education]]'' condemning the requirement and calling for peer reviewers to ignore the additional documentation.&lt;ref name="sciencemag blog"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grants and conferences==

[[The Royal Society]] grants up to 1 million [[pounds sterling]] annually in ''Theo Murphy Blue Skies awards'' to fund "research which is considered to be original and exciting but lacks a sufficient evidence base in the literature to be supported by traditional grant schemes."&lt;ref name="royal"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK-based [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] (EPSRC) operates a program called the IDEAS Factory, intended to promote "blue sky, curiosity-led research."&lt;ref name="nottingham"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The international [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) holds a "Blue Sky Forum" every decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/conferences/science2005/index-eng.htm|title=Blue Sky II 2006|work=Statistics Canada|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116125256/http://www.statcan.gc.ca/conferences/science2005/index-eng.htm|archivedate=2009-01-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subjects ==

Owing to its radical nature, blue sky science may challenge accepted [[Paradigm#Scientific paradigm|scientific paradigms]] and introduce entirely new fields of study.&lt;ref name="linden 2008"/&gt; It has been the inspiration for numerous works of [[science fiction]]. It has sometimes been concerned with topics such as unexplained phenomena and the impact of future technologies upon society, asking questions such as "How would a spacecraft traverse a [[black hole]] and where would it arrive upon leaving it?" and "Will the universe end, or will it just expand ever outwards for eternity?"{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13090">A '''causal theory of reference''' is a theory of how terms acquire specific [[reference|referents]] based on evidence. Such theories have been used to describe many referring terms, particularly logical terms, [[proper names]], and [[natural kind]] terms. In the case of names, for example, a causal theory of reference typically involves the following claims:

* a name's [[reference|referent]] is fixed by an original act of naming (also called a "dubbing" or, by [[Saul Kripke]], an "initial baptism"), whereupon the name becomes a [[rigid designator]] of that object.
* later uses of the name succeed in referring to the referent by being linked to that original act via a [[Causality|causal chain]].

Weaker versions of the position (perhaps not properly called "causal theories"), claim merely that, in many cases, events in the causal history of a speaker's use of the term, including when the term was first acquired, must be considered to correctly assign references to the speaker's words.

Causal theories of names became popular during the 1970s, under the influence of work by Saul Kripke and [[Keith Donnellan]]. Kripke and [[Hilary Putnam]] also defended an analogous causal account of [[natural kind]] terms.

== Kripke's causal account of names ==
In lectures later published as ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'', Kripke provided a rough outline of his causal theory of reference for names. Although he refused to explicitly endorse such a theory, he indicated that such an approach was far more promising than the then-popular [[descriptive theory of names]] introduced by [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], according to which names are in fact disguised [[definite descriptions]]. Kripke argued that in order to use a name successfully to refer to something, you do not have to be acquainted with a uniquely identifying description of that thing. Rather, your use of the name need only be caused (in an appropriate way) by the naming of that thing.

Such a causal process might proceed as follows: the parents of a newborn baby name it, pointing to the child and saying "we'll call her 'Jane'." Henceforth everyone calls her 'Jane'. With that act, the parents give the girl her name. The assembled family and friends now know that 'Jane' is a name which refers to Jane. This is referred to as Jane's dubbing, naming, or initial baptism.

However, not everyone who knows Jane and uses the name 'Jane' to refer to her was present at this naming. So how is it that when ''they'' use the name 'Jane', they are referring to Jane? The answer provided by causal theories is that there is a causal chain that passes from the original observers of Jane's naming to everyone else who uses her name. For example, maybe Jill was not at the naming, but Jill learns about Jane, and learns that her name is 'Jane', from Jane's mother, who ''was'' there. She then uses the name 'Jane' with the intention of referring to the child Jane's mother referred to. Jill can now use the name, and her use of it can in turn transmit the ability to refer to Jane to other speakers.

Philosophers such as [[Gareth Evans (philosopher)|Gareth Evans]] have insisted that the theory's account of the dubbing process needs to be broadened to include what are called 'multiple groundings'. After her initial baptism, uses of 'Jane' in the presence of Jane may, under the right circumstances, be considered to further ground the name ('Jane') in its referent (Jane). That is, if I am in direct contact with Jane, the reference for my utterance of the name 'Jane' may be fixed not simply by a causal chain through people who had encountered her earlier (when she was first named); it may also be indexically fixed to Jane at the moment of my utterance. Thus our modern day use of a name such as 'Christopher Columbus' can be thought of as referring to Columbus through a causal chain that terminates not simply in one instance of his naming, but rather in a series of grounding uses of the name that occurred throughout his life. Under certain circumstances of confusion, this can lead to the alteration of a name's referent (for one example of how this might happen, see [[Twin Earth thought experiment]]).

== Motivation ==
Causal theories of reference were born partially in response to the widespread acceptance of Russellian descriptive theories. Russell found that certain [[logic]]al [[contradiction]]s could be avoided if names were considered disguised [[definite description]]s (a similar view is often attributed to [[Gottlob Frege]], mostly on the strength of a footnoted comment in "[[On Sense and Reference]]", although many Frege scholars consider this attribution misguided).{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} On such an account, the name 'Aristotle' might be seen as meaning 'the student of Plato and teacher of Alexander the Great'. Later description theorists expanded upon this by suggesting that a name expressed not one particular description, but many (perhaps constituting all of one's essential knowledge of the individual named), or a weighted average of these descriptions.

Kripke found this account to be deeply flawed, for a number of reasons. Notably:

* We can successfully refer to individuals for whom we have ''no'' uniquely identifying description. (For example, a speaker can talk about Phillie Sophik even if one only knows him as 'some poet'.)
* We can successfully refer to individuals for whom the only identifying descriptions we have fail to refer as we believe them to. (Many speakers have no identifying beliefs about [[Christopher Columbus]] other than 'the first European in North America' or 'the first person to believe that the earth was round'. Both of these beliefs are incorrect. Nevertheless, when such a person says 'Christopher Columbus', we acknowledge that they are referring to Christopher Columbus, not to whatever individual satisfies one of those descriptions.)
* We use names to speak hypothetically about what ''could'' have happened to a person. A name functions as a [[rigid designator]], while a definite description does not. (One could say 'If Aristotle had died young, he would never have taught Alexander the Great.' But if 'the teacher of Alexander the Great' were a component of the ''meaning'' of 'Aristotle' then this would be nonsense.)

A causal theory avoids these difficulties. A name refers rigidly to the bearer to which it is causally connected, regardless of any particular facts about the bearer, and in all [[possible worlds]].

The same motivations apply to causal theories in regard to other sorts of terms. Putnam, for instance, attempted to establish that 'water' refers rigidly to the stuff that we do in fact call 'water', to the exclusion of any possible identical water-like substance for which we have no causal connection. These considerations motivate [[semantic externalism]]. Because speakers interact with a natural kind such as water regularly, and because there is generally no naming ceremony through which their names are formalized, the multiple groundings described above are even more essential to a causal account of such terms. A speaker whose environment changes may thus observe that the referents of his terms shift, as described in the [[Twin Earth thought experiment|Twin Earth]] and [[Swamp man]] [[thought experiment]]s.

== Variations&lt;!--'Causal-historical theory of reference', 'Causal-descriptive theory of reference', and 'Descriptive-causal theory of reference' redirect here--&gt; ==
Variations of the causal theory include:
* The '''causal-historical theory of reference'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is the original version of the causal theory. It was put forward by [[Keith Donnellan]] in 1972&lt;ref&gt;Donnellan, Keith. (1972). "Proper Names and Identifying Descriptions."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Saul Kripke]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, S. "A Puzzle about Belief", in A. Margalit (ed.), ''Meaning and Use'', Reidel, pp. 239–83 (1979).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/names/ Names (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; This view introduces the idea of reference-passing links in a causal-historical chain.&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt;
* The '''descriptive-causal theory of reference'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (also '''causal-descriptive theory of reference'''),&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref name=Psillos279&gt;[[Stathis Psillos]], ''Scientific Realism: How Science Tracks Truth'', Routledge, 1999, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; a view put forward by [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]]&lt;ref name=Psillos279/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gattei&gt;Stefano Gattei, ''Thomas Kuhn's 'Linguistic Turn' and the Legacy of Logical Empiricism: Incommensurability, Rationality and the Search for Truth'', Ashgate Publishing, 2012, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1984,&lt;ref&gt;D. K. Lewis (1984), "Putnam's Paradox." ''Australasian Journal of Philosophy'', '''62'''(3), 221–36; reprinted in D. Lewis (1999), ''Papers on metaphysics and epistemology'', Cambridge University Press, pp. 56–77.&lt;/ref&gt; introduces the idea that a minimal descriptive apparatus needs to be added to the causal relations between speaker and object.&lt;ref name=Gattei/&gt; (See also [[Structuralism (philosophy of science)#Further criticism|Criticism of structuralism]].)

== Criticism of the theory ==
[[Gareth Evans (philosopher)|Gareth Evans]] argued that the causal theory, or at least certain common and over-simple variants of it, have the consequence that, however remote or obscure the causal connection between someone's use of a proper name and the object it originally referred to, they still refer to that object when they use the name. (Imagine a name briefly overheard in a train or café.) The theory effectively ignores context and makes reference into a magic trick. Evans describes it as a "[[photograph]]" theory of reference.{{citation needed|reason=Evans' argument and quote are herein unsourced-no indication of where he argued this|date=April 2016}}

The links between different users of the name are particularly obscure. Each user must somehow pass the name on to the next, and must somehow "mean" the right individual as they do so (suppose "Socrates" is the name of a pet [[aardvark]]). Kripke himself notes the difficulty, [[John Searle]] makes much of it.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=September 2015}}

[[Mark Sainsbury (philosopher)|Mark Sainsbury]] argued&lt;ref&gt;Sainsbury, R.M., ''Departing From Frege: Essays in the Philosophy of Language'', Routledge, 2002, Essay XII.&lt;/ref&gt; for a causal theory similar to Kripke's, except that the baptised object is eliminated. A "baptism" may be a baptism of nothing, he argues: a name can be intelligibly introduced even if it names nothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Sainsbury|2001|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; The causal chain we associate with the use of proper names may begin merely with a "journalistic" source.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Sainsbury|2001|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The causal theory has a difficult time explaining the phenomenon of reference change. [[Gareth Evans (philosopher)|Gareth Evans]] cites the example of when [[Marco Polo]] unknowingly referred to the African Island as "Madagascar" when the natives actually used the term to refer to a part of the mainland. Evans claims that Polo clearly intended to use the term as the natives do, but somehow changed the meaning of the term "Madagascar" to refer to the island as it is known today. [[Michael Devitt]] claims that repeated groundings in an object can account for reference change. However, such a response leaves open the problem of cognitive significance that originally intrigued Russell and Frege.

East Asians are more likely than Americans to have intuitions about reference in line with descriptivist theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{

'''Charles Cotin''' or '''Abbé Cotin''' (1604 &amp;ndash; December 1681) was a French [[abbé]], [[philosopher]] and poet. He was made a member of the [[Académie française]] on 7 January 1655.

Cotin was born and died in Paris. He was a scholar of Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and Syriac, an advisor to [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], and renowned in his time for his sermons, poetry, and erudition. He frequented the Paris literary salons, particularly that of the [[Hôtel de Rambouillet]] as a friend of Mlle de Gournay, and his translation of the [[Song of Songs]] is more notable for its flavor of fashionable salons than of sacred poetry.

Cotin is remembered for his violent squabbles with [[Nicolas Boileau]] and [[Molière]], who gave him a stinging satiric immortality as the character Trissotin in ''[[Les Femmes savantes]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25517">'''Collective security''' can be understood as a security [[treaty|arrangement]], political, regional, or global, in which each state in the system accepts that the [[security]] of one is the concern of all, and therefore commits to a collective response to threats to, and breaches to peace. Collective security is more ambitious than systems of [[military alliance|alliance security]] or collective defense in that it seeks to encompass the totality of states within a region or indeed globally, and to address a wide range of possible threats. While collective security is an idea with a long history, its implementation in practice has proved problematic. Several prerequisites have to be met for it to have a chance of working. It is the theory or practice of states pledging to defend one another in order to deter aggression or to exterminate transgressor if international order has been breached.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/979008143|title=Global politics|last=Macmillan.|first=Palgrave|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137349262|oclc=979008143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early mentions===

Collective security is one of the most promising approaches for peace and a valuable device for [[Power (social and political)|power]] management on an [[international]] scale. [[Cardinal Richelieu]] proposed a scheme for collective security in 1629, which was partially reflected in the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]]. In the eighteenth century many proposals were made for collective security arrangements, especially in Europe.

The concept of a peaceful community of nations was outlined in 1795 in [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/kant/kant1.htm|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|publisher=Mount Holyoke College| title=Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch|accessdate=2008-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kant outlined the idea of a league of nations that would control conflict and promote peace between states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Western Thought:from Ancient Greece to the Twentieth Century|last1=Skirbekk|first1=Gunnar|authorlink1=Gunnar Skirbekk|last2=Gilje|first2=Nils|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|edition=illustrated|isbn=978-0-415-22073-6|page=288|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NoLAHXt4PRMC|accessdate=17 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he argues for the establishment of a peaceful world community not in a sense that there be a [[global government]] but in the hope that each state would declare itself as a free state that respects its citizens and welcomes foreign visitors as fellow rational beings. His key argument is that a union of free states would promote peaceful society worldwide: therefore, in his view, there can be a perpetual peace shaped by the international community rather than by a world government.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.constitution.org/kant/perpeace.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

International co-operation to promote collective security originated in the [[Concert of Europe]] that developed after the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in the nineteenth century in an attempt to maintain the ''status quo'' between European states and so avoid war.{{sfn|Reichard|2006|p=9}}{{sfn|Rapoport|1995|pp=498–500}}  This period also saw the development of international law with the first [[Geneva Conventions]] establishing laws about humanitarian relief during war and the international [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Conventions]] of 1899 and 1907 governing rules of war and the peaceful settlement of international disputes.{{sfn|Bouchet-Saulnier|Brav|Olivier|2007|pp=14–134}}{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=10}}

The forerunner of the League of Nations, the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] (IPU), was formed by peace activists [[William Randal Cremer]] and [[Frédéric Passy]] in 1889. The organization was international in scope with a third of the members of [[parliament]], in the 24 countries with parliaments, serving as members of the IPU by 1914. Its aims were to encourage governments to solve international disputes by peaceful means and arbitration and annual conferences were held to help governments refine the process of international arbitration. The IPU's structure consisted of a Council headed by a President which would later be reflected in the structure of the League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Before the League of Nations|publisher=The United Nations Office at Geneva|url=http://www.unog.ch/80256EE60057D930/(httpPages)/B5B92952225993B0C1256F2D00393560?OpenDocument|accessdate =2008-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the twentieth century two power blocs emerged through alliances between the European [[Great Powers]]. It was these alliances that came into effect at the [[Origins of World War I|start of the First World War]] in 1914, drawing all the major European powers into the war. This was the first major war in Europe between [[industrialized]] countries and the first time in Western Europe the results of [[industrialization]] (for example [[mass production]]) had been dedicated to war. The result of this [[industrial warfare]] was an unprecedented casualty level with eight and a half million members of [[armed services]] dead, an estimated 21 million wounded, and approximately 10 million civilian deaths.{{sfn|Bell|2007|pp=15–17}}{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=1–2}}

By the time the fighting ended in November 1918, the war had had a profound impact, affecting the social, political and economic systems of [[Europe]] and inflicting psychological and physical damage on the continent.{{sfn|Bell|2007|p=16}} Anti-war sentiment rose across the world; the First World War was described as "[[The war to end war|the war to end all wars]]",{{sfn|Archer|2001|p=14}}{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=1}} and its possible causes were vigorously investigated. The causes identified included [[arms race]]s, alliances, secret diplomacy, and the freedom of sovereign states to enter into war for their own benefit. The perceived remedies to these were seen as the creation of an international organization whose aim was to prevent future war through [[disarmament]], open diplomacy, international co-operation, restrictions on the right to wage wars, and penalties that made war unattractive to nations.{{sfn|Bell|2007|p=8}}

==Theory==
Collective security can be understood as a security arrangement in which all states cooperate collectively to provide security for all by the actions of all against any states within the groups which might challenge the existing order by using force. This contrasts with self-help strategies of engaging in war for purely immediate national interest. While collective security is possible, several prerequisites have to be met for it to work.

Collective Security also contrasts with [[Alliance|alliances]] in term of different forms. In Ph.D dissertation of Andreatta, collective security is based on the perspective of all together in a group against any one rather than on [[Unilateralism|unilateral]] idea of some against specific others.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andreatta|first=Filippo|date=Summer 1996|title=Collective security: Theory and practice of an institution for peace in the XX century.|url=|journal=Collective Security|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alliance has the form of two groups against each other as like states A+B+C against states Y+Z; however, collective security system takes form of conducting one agreement between A+B+C+Y+Z against any one of them. Moreover, it is also different from alliance since collective security is built to focus on internal regulation required universal membership while alliance is built to deter or reduce an outside threat as an exclusive institution. For alliance, states would see their allies as [[Absolute gain (international relations)|absolute gain]] and their enemies as [[Relative gain (international relations)|relative gains]] without [[legal obligation]]. In contrast, collective security follows the case of neutrality as the whole group would be required to punish the aggressor with the hope for it not to violate general norms, in which are beyond the states' control rather than by their self-interests. Opposite with short term interest of allies fighting for a common threat, collective security tends to use universal interests for [[global peace]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Sovereign nations eager to maintain the status quo, willingly cooperate, accepting a degree of vulnerability and in some cases of minor nations, also accede to the interests of the chief contributing nations organising the collective security. Collective Security is achieved by setting up an international cooperative organisation, under the auspices of international law and this gives rise to a form of international collective governance, albeit limited in scope and effectiveness. The collective security organisation then becomes an arena for diplomacy, balance of power and exercise of soft power. The use of hard power by states, unless legitimised by the Collective Security organisation, is considered illegitimate, reprehensible and needing remediation of some kind. The collective security organisation not only gives cheaper security, but also may be the only practicable means of security for smaller nations against more powerful threatening neighbours without the need of joining the camp of the nations balancing their neighbours.

The concept of "collective security" forwarded by men such as [[Michael Joseph Savage]], [[Martin Wight]], [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[Woodrow Wilson]], are deemed to apply interests in security in a broad manner, to "avoid grouping powers into opposing camps, and refusing to draw dividing lines that would leave anyone out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=NATO Transformed: The Alliance's New Roles in International Security|last=Yost|first=David S.|publisher=Leicester University Press|year=1977|location=London|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "collective security" has also been cited as a principle of the [[United Nations]], and the [[League of Nations]] before that. By employing a system of collective security, the UN hopes to dissuade any member state from acting in a manner likely to threaten peace, thereby avoiding any conflict.

Collective security selectively incorporates the concept of both [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] and [[global government]]. However, the term "Collective Security" is not the same as Balance of power, mentioned in [[Realism (international relations)|Realism theory]]. According to Adreatta, balance of power focuses on state's unilateral interests stoping aggression. Since states look at the world as having security dilemma due to the fear of relative gain, state does not want any state to become predominant causing a mutually restraining equilibrium. In other word, Balance of power between states opts for decentralization of power. States are separate actors who do not subordinate their [[autonomy]] or sovereignty to a central. "Singly or in combinations reflecting the coincidence of interests, States seek to influence the pattern of power distribution and to determine their own places within that pattern."&lt;ref&gt;I.L. Claude, Jr., "The Management of Power in the Changing United Nations", ''International Organization'', Vol. 15 (Spring 1961), pp. 219–221&lt;/ref&gt; The expectation of order and peace comes from the belief that competing powers will somehow balance and thereby cancel each other out to produce “deterrence through equilibration.”&lt;ref name="Claude_222"&gt;Claude, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, under collective security, states share the long term goal of global peace, reversing relationship between individual and community goals mentioned in Balance of Power theories. Balance of power fails to maintain stability led to break down of war as in the case of Napoleonic Wars and World Wars when states unilaterally decided to be unwilling or unable to fight. 

At the same time, the concept of global government is about centralization. Global government is a centralized institutional system that possesses the power use of force like a well established sovereign nation state. This concept strips states of their "standing as centers of power and policy, where issues of war and peace are concerned,"&lt;ref name="Claude_222" /&gt; and superimposing on them "an institution possessed of the authority and capability to maintain, by unchallengeable force so far as may be necessary, the order and stability of a global community."&lt;ref name="Claude_222" /&gt; Despite some different characteristics of balance of power theory, collective Collective security selectively incorporates both of the concepts, centralization and decentralization, which can broil down to a phrase: "order without government."&lt;ref&gt;I. L. Claude, Jr. "An Autopsy of Collective Security", ''Political Science Quarterly'', Vol. 90 (Winter 1975–76), p. 715&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, collective security seems to be more reliable alternative since it gathers power as a team to punish the aggressor, and it is an attempt to improve international relations and to provide solid rules under [[Anarchy|anarchy.]] 

===Basic assumptions===
Organski (1960) lists five basic assumptions underlying the theory of collective security:&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in Ghosh (1960), pg 89. Paraphrased.&lt;/ref&gt;

* In an armed conflict, member nation-states will be able to agree on which nation is the aggressor.
* All member nation-states are equally committed to contain and constrain the aggression, irrespective of its source or origin.
* All member nation-states have identical freedom of action and ability to join in proceedings against the aggressor.
* The cumulative power of the cooperating members of the alliance for collective security will be adequate and sufficient to overpower the might of the aggressor.
* In the light of the threat posed by the collective might of the nations of a collective security coalition, the aggressor nation will modify its policies, or if unwilling to do so, will be defeated.

===Prerequisites===
Morgenthau (1948) states that three prerequisites must be met for collective security to successfully prevent war:

* The collective security system must be able to assemble military force in strength greatly in excess to that assembled by the aggressor(s) thereby deterring the aggressor(s) from attempting to change the world order defended by the collective security system.
* Those nations, whose combined strength would be used for deterrence as mentioned in the first prerequisite, should have identical beliefs about the security of the world order that the collective is defending.
* Nations must be willing to subordinate their conflicting interests to the common good defined in terms of the common defense of all member-states.

===In the League of Nations===
After World War I, the first large scale attempt to provide collective security in modern times was the establishment of the [[League of Nations]] in 1919–20. The provisions of the League of Nations Covenant represented a weak system for decision-making and for collective action. According to Palmer and Perking, they pointed failure of United States in joining League of Nations and the rise of USSR outside the League as one of major reasons why it was failed under enforcement of collective security&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ebegbulem|first=Joseph C|date=2011|title=The Failure of Collective Security in the Post World Wars I and II International System|url=https://www2.hu-berlin.de/transcience/Vol2_Issue2_2011_23_29.pdf|journal=Journal of Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin|volume=2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Moreover, an example of the failure of the League of Nations' collective security is the [[Manchurian Crisis]], when [[Japan]] occupied part of [[China]] (which was a League member). After the invasion, members of the League passed a resolution calling for Japan to withdraw or face severe penalties. Given that every nation on the League of Nations council had veto power, Japan promptly vetoed the resolution, severely limiting the LN's ability to respond. After one year of deliberation, the League passed a resolution condemning the invasion without committing the League's members to any action against it. The Japanese replied by quitting the League.

[[Abyssinia Crisis|A similar process]] occurred in 1935, when [[Italy]] invaded [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] (now [[Ethiopia]]). Sanctions were passed, but Italy would have vetoed any stronger resolution. Additionally, Britain and France sought to court Italy's government as a potential deterrent to Hitler, given that Mussolini was not yet in what would become the Axis alliance of [[World War II]]. Thus, neither enforced any serious sanctions against the Italian government. Additionally, in this case and with the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, the absence of the United States from the League of Nations deprived it of another major power that could have used economic leverage against either of the aggressor states. Inaction by the League subjected it to criticisms that it was weak and concerned more with European issues (most leading members were European), and it did not deter Hitler from his plans to dominate Europe. Ethiopian Emperor [[Haile Selassie I]] continued to support collective security, as he assessed that impotence lay not in the principle but in its covenantors' commitment to honor its tenets.

One active and articulate exponent of collective security during the immediate pre-war years was the Soviet foreign minister, [[Maxim Litvinov]]. However, there are grounds for doubt about the depth of Soviet commitment to the principle as well as that of Western powers. After the [[Munich Agreement]] in September 1938 and the passivity of outside powers in the face of German occupation of the remainder of [[Czechoslovakia]] in March 1939, it was shown that the Western powers were not prepared to engage in collective security against aggression by the Axis powers together with the Soviet Union, Soviet foreign policy was revised and Litvinov was replaced as foreign minister in early May 1939 to facilitate the negotiations that led to the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] with Germany, signed by Litvinov's successor, [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], on August 23 of that year. The war in Europe broke out a week later, with the [[invasion of Poland]], starting on September 1, 1939. Thus, this could be seen that collective security does not always work due to the lack of commitment and unwillingness of states or International Community to act in concert (Mingst 1999).

=== Under United Nations and recent events ===
The 1945 [[United Nations Charter]], although containing stronger provisions for decision-making and collective military action than those of the League of Nations Covenant, does not represent a complete system of collective security, but rather a balance between collective action on the one hand and continued operation of the states system (including the continued special roles of great powers) on the other. States in UN collective security system are selective to support or oppose UN action in certain conflicts based on their self-interests. United Nations can be somehow seen as the platform for self-interest purposes for members in Security Council due to their Veto power and excessive assistance or aid. This has made those states to act unilaterally ignoring the approval, or flout orders of Security Council not to act unilaterally. The [[Iraq crisis]] is a clearer example as “Rather than seek the global interest of peace and security through stability in Iraq and the Middle East region, the domination oriented members amassed their vast economic, diplomatic and military resources, captured and brazenly subjugated Iraq to an unprecedented condominial regime serving their economic interest under Iraq Reconstruction Programme.” (Eke, 2007)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, lack of geographical spread of members in Security Council causes unbalancing on the role of maintenance global peace and security. The voices of small countries can be only heard, but not all policies were adopted in response to them unless they serves the great powers' interests.  

However, this does not mean collective security in the UN is completely fail. The role of the UN and collective security in general is evolving, given the rise of [[Civil war|internal state conflict]]s. Since the end of World War II, there have been 111 military conflicts worldwide, but only 9 of these have involved two or more states going to war with one another. The remainder have either been internal civil wars or civil wars where other [[nation]]s intervened in some manner. This means that collective security may have to evolve towards providing a means to ensure stability and a fair international resolution to those internal conflicts. Whether this will involve more powerful peacekeeping forces, or a larger role for the UN diplomatically, will likely be judged on a case-by-case basis. 

==Collective defense==
Collective defense is an arrangement, usually formalized by a treaty and an organization, among participant states that commit support in defense of a member state if it is attacked by another state outside the organization. [[NATO]] is the best known collective defense organization; its famous Article 5 calls on (but does not fully commit) member states to assist another member under attack. This article was invoked after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]] on the [[United States]], after which other NATO members provided assistance to the US [[War on Terror]] in [[Afghanistan]].

Collective defense has its roots in multiparty [[Political alliance|alliances]] and entails benefits as well as risks. On the one hand, by combining and pooling resources, it can reduce any single state's cost of providing fully for its security. Smaller members of NATO, for example, have leeway to invest a greater proportion of their budget on non-military priorities, such as education or health, since they can count on other members to come to their defense, if needed.

On the other hand, collective defense also involves risky commitments. Member states can become embroiled in costly wars benefiting neither the direct victim nor the aggressor. In [[World War I]], countries in the collective defense arrangement known as the [[Triple Entente]] ([[French Third Republic|France]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]]) were pulled into war quickly when Russia started full mobilization against [[Austria-Hungary]], whose ally [[German Empire|Germany]] subsequently declared war on Russia.

'''Contextualism''' describes a collection of views in [[philosophy]] which emphasize the ''context'' in which an action, [[utterance]], or expression occurs, and argues that, in some important respect, the action, utterance, or expression can only be understood relative to that context.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Price (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Contextualist views hold that philosophically controversial concepts, such as "meaning &lt;var&gt;P&lt;/var&gt;", "knowing that &lt;var&gt;P&lt;/var&gt;", "having a reason to &lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt;", and possibly even "being true" or "being right" only have meaning relative to a specified context. Some philosophers&lt;ref&gt;Feldman (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; hold that context-dependence may lead to [[relativism]];&lt;ref&gt;Mackie (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless, contextualist views are increasingly popular within philosophy.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In [[ethics]], "contextualist" views are often closely associated with [[situational ethics]], or with [[moral relativism]].&lt;ref&gt;Timmons (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[architectural theory]], contextualism is a theory of design wherein modern (not be confused with modernism) building types are harmonized with urban forms usual to a traditional city.&lt;ref&gt;Jencks, p. 78-79&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epistemology==

===Introduction===
In [[epistemology]], contextualism is the treatment of the word 'knows' as [[context-sensitive language|context-sensitive]].  Context-sensitive expressions are ones that "express different propositions relative to different contexts of use".&lt;ref&gt;Stanley (2005), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, some terms that are relatively uncontroversially considered context-sensitive are [[indexical]]s, such as 'I', 'here', and 'now'.  While the word 'I' has a constant [[linguistic meaning]] in all contexts of use, whom it refers to varies with context. Similarly, epistemic contextualists argue that the word 'knows' is context sensitive, expressing different relations in some different contexts.

Contextualism was introduced, in part, in order to undermine skeptical arguments that have this basic structure:
# I don't know that I am not in a skeptical scenario H (e.g., I'm not a brain in a vat)
# If I don't know that H is not the case, then I don't know an ordinary proposition O (e.g., I have hands)
# Conclusion: Therefore, I don't know O
Contextualist solution is not to deny any premise, nor to say that the argument does not follow, but link the truth value of (3) to the context, and say that we can refuse (3) in context—like everyday conversational context—where we have different requirements to say we know.

The main tenet of contextualist epistemology, no matter what account of knowledge it is wedded to, is that knowledge attributions are context-sensitive.  Then the truth values of out term "know" depend on the context in which it is used . We can realize that in the context in which the standards to claim truthfully knowledge are so high—e. e., in skeptical context—if we said something like 'I know that I have hands' then this statement would be false. Nevertheless,  if we utter the same proposition in an ordinary context—e.g., in a cafe with friends--, where lower standards are in place , the statement would be truth, even more, it's negation would be false. So, only when we participate in philosophical discourses of the skeptical sort, do we seem  to lose our knowledge. However, once we leave the skeptical context, we  can truthfully say we have knowledge.

That is, when we attribute knowledge to someone, the context in which we use the term 'knowledge' determines the standards relative to which "knowledge" is being attributed (or denied).  If we use it in everyday conversational contexts, the contextualist maintains, most of our claims to "know" things are true, despite skeptic's attempts to show we know little or nothing.  But if the term 'knowledge' is used when skeptical hypotheses are being discussed, we count as "knowing" very little, if anything.  Contextualists use this to explain why skeptical arguments can be persuasive, while at the same time protecting the correctness of our ordinary claims to "know" things.  It is important to note that this theory does not allow that someone can have knowledge at one moment and not the other, for this would hardly be a satisfying epistemological answer. What contextualism entails is that in one context an utterance of a knowledge attribution can be true, and in a context with higher standards for knowledge, the same statement can be false.  This happens in the same way that 'I' can correctly be used (by different people) to refer to different people at the same time.

What varies with context is how well-positioned a subject must be with respect to a proposition to count as "knowing" it.  Contextualism in epistemology then is a [[semantic]] thesis about how 'knows' works in English, not a theory of what knowledge, justification, or strength of epistemic position consists in.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley (2005), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; However, epistemologists combine contextualism with views about what knowledge is to address epistemological puzzles and issues, such as [[skepticism]], the [[Gettier problem]], and the [[Lottery paradox]].

Contextualist accounts of knowledge became increasingly popular toward the end of the 20th century, particularly as responses to the problem of [[skepticism]].  Contemporary contextualists include Michael Blome-Tillmann, [[Michael Williams (philosopher)|Michael Williams]], Stewart Cohen, [[Keith DeRose]], [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]], [[Gail Stine]], and George Mattey.

Thus, the standards for attributing knowledge to someone, the contexualist claims, vary from one user's context to the next. Thus, if I say "John knows that his car is in front of him", the utterance is true if and only if (1) John believes that his car is in front of him, (2) the car is in fact in front of him, and (3) John meets the epistemic standards that my (the speaker's) context selects. This is a loose contextualist account of knowledge, and there are many significantly different theories of knowledge that can fit this contextualist template and thereby come in a contextualist form.

For instance, an [[evidentialism|evidentialist]] account of knowledge can be an instance of contextualism if it's held that strength of justification is a contextually varying matter.  And one who accepts a [[Relevant alternatives theory|relevant alternative's]] account of knowledge can be a contextualist by holding that what range of alternatives are relevant is sensitive to conversational context. DeRose adopts a type of modal or "safety" (as it has since come to be known) account on which knowledge is a matter of one's belief as to whether or not p is the case matching the fact of the matter, not only in the actual world, but also in the sufficiently close possible worlds: Knowledge amounts to there being no "nearby" worlds in which one goes wrong with respect to p. But how close is sufficiently close? It's here that DeRose takes the modal account of knowledge in a contextualist direction, for the range of "epistemically relevant worlds" is what varies with context: In high standards contexts one's belief must match the fact of the matter through a much wider range of worlds than is relevant to low standards contexts.

===Example===
It is claimed that [[neurophilosophy]] has the goal of ''contextualizing''. "We must contextualize questions usually dealt with in the physical and epistemological domains into the context of the empirical domain, the domain of observation in third-person perspective." "Rather than approaching the metaphysical and epistemological issues [about the nature and features of brain and mind] from a mind-based (as in traditional philosophy) or brain-reductive (as in neuroscience) perspective, we therefore pursue a brain-based strategy and thus a non-reductive neurophilosophy." "The various arguments against the material or lphysicalistic view of consciousness...are directly compared with the empirical data and are thus put into the empirical, that is, neuroscientific context of consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;Northoff, Georg (2014) p. 351&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms===
However, contextualist epistemology has been criticized by several philosophers.  Contextualism is opposed to any general form of ''[[Invariantism]]'', which claims that knowledge is not context-sensitive (i.e. it is invariant).  More recent criticism has been in the form of rival theories, including ''Subject-Sensitive Invariantism'' (SSI), mainly due to the work of [[John Hawthorne]] (2004), and ''Interest-Relative Invariantism'' (IRI), due to [[Jason Stanley]] (2005).  SSI claims that it is the context of the subject of the knowledge attribution that determines the epistemic standards, whereas Contextualism maintains it is the attributor.  IRI, on the other hand, argues that it is the context of the practical interests of the subject of the knowledge attribution that determines the epistemic standards.  Stanley writes that bare IRI is "simply the claim that whether or not someone knows that ''p'' may be determined in part by practical facts about the subject's environment."&lt;ref&gt;Stanley (2005), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;  ("Contextualism" is a misnomer for either form of Invariantism, since "Contextualism" among epistemologists is considered to be restricted to a claim about the context-sensitivity of knowledge attributions (or the word "knows").  Thus, any view which maintains that something other than knowledge attributions are context-sensitive is not, strictly speaking, a form of Contextualism.) DeRose (2009) responds to recent attacks on contextualism, and argues that contextualism is superior to these recent rivals.

An alternative to contextualism called [[contrastivism]] has been proposed by [[Jonathan Schaffer]]. Contrastivism, like contextualism, uses semantic approaches to tackle the problem of skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;Schaffer (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experimental research===
Recent work in the new field of [[experimental philosophy]] has taken an empirical approach to testing the claims of contextualism and related views. This research has proceeded by conducting experiments in which ordinary non-philosophers are presented with vignettes which involve a knowledge ascription. Participants are then asked to report on the status of that knowledge ascription. The studies address contextualism by varying the context of the knowledge ascription, e.g., how important it is that the agent in the vignette has accurate knowledge.

In the studies completed up to this point, no support for contextualism has been found.&lt;ref&gt;See Feltz and Zarpentine (2010), May, Sinnott-Armstrong, Hull, and Zimmerman (2010), and Buckwatler (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; This critique of contextualism can be summed up as: stakes have no impact on evidence. More specifically, non-philosophical intuitions about knowledge attributions are not affected by the importance to the potential knower of the accuracy of that knowledge. Some may argue that these empirical studies for the most part have not been well designed for testing contextualism, which claims that the context of the attributor of "knowledge" affects the epistemic standards that govern their claims.  Because most of the empirical studies don't vary the stakes for the attributor, but for the subject being described, these studies are more relevant to the evaluation of John Hawthorne's "Subject-Sensitive Invariantism" or Jason Stanley's "Interest-Relative Invariantism"—views on which the stakes for the putative subject of knowledge can affect whether that subject knows—than they are of contextualism. However, Feltz &amp; Zarpentine (forthcoming) have tested the stakes for both the subject and the attributor, and the results are not in keeping with contextualism. Experimental work continues to be done on this topic.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Schaffer and Knobe (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18809">In the [[history of ideas]], the '''continuity thesis''' is the hypothesis that there was no radical discontinuity between the intellectual development of the [[Middle Ages]] and the developments in the [[Renaissance]] and [[early modern period]]. Thus the idea of an intellectual or scientific revolution following the Renaissance is, according to the continuity thesis, a myth. Some continuity theorists point to earlier intellectual revolutions occurring in the Middle Ages, usually referring to the European [[Renaissance of the 12th century]]&lt;ref name=Grant/&gt; as a sign of continuity. Despite the many points that have been brought up by proponents of the continuity thesis, a majority of scholars still support the traditional view of the [[Scientific Revolution]] occurring in the 16th and 17th centuries.&lt;ref name=Grant/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dear |first=Peter |edition=1st |title=Revolutionizing the Sciences: European Knowledge and Its Ambitions, 1500-1700 |location=Princeton, New Jersey |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |publication-date= Apr 2001 |isbn=0-691-08859-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Margolis |first=Howard |author-link=Howard Margolis |title=It Started with Copernicus: How Turning the World inside out Led to the Scientific Revolution |location=New York |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Education|McGraw-Hill]] |publication-date=25 Apr 2002 |isbn=0-07-138507-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Westfall |first=Richard S. |author-link=Richard S.

== Duhem ==
The idea of a continuity, rather than contrast between [[medieval]] and [[modern history|modern]] thought, begins with [[Pierre Duhem]], the French physicist and [[philosopher of science]].  It is set out in his ten volume work on the history of science, ''Le système du monde: histoire des doctrines cosmologiques de Platon à Copernic''. Unlike many former historians such as [[Voltaire]] and [[Condorcet]], who did not consider the Middle Ages to be of much intellectual importance {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, he tried to show that the [[Roman Catholic Church]] had helped foster the development of Western science. His work was prompted by his research into the origins of [[statics]], where he encountered the works of medieval mathematicians and philosophers such as [[Nicole Oresme]] and [[Roger Bacon]]. He consequently came to regard them as the founders of modern science, their having in his view anticipated many of the discoveries of [[Galileo]] and later thinkers. Duhem concluded that "the mechanics and physics of which modern times are justifiably proud proceed, by an uninterrupted series of scarcely perceptible improvements, from doctrines professed in the heart of the medieval schools."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Lindberg |editor-first1=David C. |editor-link1=David C.

"Preface". ''Les Origines de la statique'' '''1'''. Paris: A. Hermman. p. iv.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sarton==
Another notable supporter of the continuity thesis was [[George Sarton]] (1884–1956). In ''The History of Science and the New Humanism'' (1931), George Sarton put much stress on the historical continuity of science. Sarton further noted that the development of science stagnated during the Renaissance, due to [[Renaissance humanism]] putting more emphasis on [[wikt:form|form]] over [[fact]], [[grammar]] over substance, and the adoration of [[Ancient history|ancient]] authorities over [[Empiricism|empirical]] investigation. As a result, he stated that science had to be introduced to [[Western culture]] twice: first in the 12th century during the [[Latin translations of the 12th century|Arabic–Latin translation movement]], and again in the 17th century during what became known as the "Scientific Revolution". He said this was due to the first appearance of science being swept away by Renaissance humanism before science had to be re-introduced again in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cochrane |first=Eric |title=Science and Humanism in the Italian Renaissance |journal=The American Historical Review Cochrane |volume=81 |issue=5 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] for the [[American Historical Association]] |publication-date=Dec 1976 |page=1039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarton wrote in the ''Introduction to the History of Science'':

{{Quote|"It does not follow, as so many ignorant persons think, that the mediaeval activities were sterile. That would be just as foolish as to consider a pregnant woman sterile as long as the fruit of her womb was unborn. The Middle Ages were pregnant with many ideas which could not be delivered until much later. Modern science, we might say, was the fruition of mediaeval immaturity. [[Andreas Vesalius|Vesalius]], [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]], [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] were the happy inheritors who cashed in."&lt;ref name=sarton&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sarton |first=George |authorlink=George Sarton |title=Introduction to the History of Science |volume=3 |publisher=[[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|Williams &amp; Wilkins]] for [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]] |publication-date=1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}}}}

{{quote|"We shall not be far wrong in saying that it was [[William of Ockham|Occamism]] combined with [[Averroism]] which prepared the gradual dissolution of mediaeval continuity and the beginning of a new age."&lt;ref name=sarton /&gt;{{rp|91}}}}

== Franklin and Pasnau ==
More recently the Australian mathematician and historian of science [[James Franklin (philosopher)|James Franklin]] has argued that the idea of a European [[Renaissance]] is a myth.&lt;ref name="franklin"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Franklin |first=James |title=The Renaissance Myth |journal=Quadrant |volume=26 |issue=11 |date=Nov 1982 |pages=51–60 |issn=0033-5002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He characterizes the myth as the view that around the 15th century:
* There was a sudden dawning of a new outlook on the world after a thousand years of darkness
* Ancient learning was rediscovered
* New ideas about intellectual inquiry and freedom replaced reliance on authority
* Scientific investigation replaced the sterile disputes of the schools.&lt;ref name="franklin" /&gt;{{rp|60}}

He claims that the Renaissance was in fact a period when thought declined significantly, bringing to an end a period of advance in the [[High Middle Ages|late Middle Ages]], and that the [[Twelfth-century Renaissance|twelfth century]] was the "real, true, and unqualified renaissance". For example, the rediscovery of ancient knowledge, which the later Italian humanists claimed for themselves, was actually accomplished in the 12th century.&lt;ref name="franklin" /&gt;

Franklin cites many examples of scientific advances in the medieval period that predate or anticipate later 'discoveries'.  For example, the first advances in geometrical optics and mechanics were in the 12th century. The first steps in understanding motion, and continuous variation in general, occurred in the 14th century with the work of the scientists of the [[Oxford Calculators|Merton School]], at Oxford in the 1330s and 1340s. (Franklin notes that there is no phrase in ancient Greek or Latin equivalent to "kilometres per hour"). [[Nicole Oresme]], who wrote on theology and money, devoted much of his effort to science and mathematics and invented graphs, was the first to perform calculations involving probability, and the first to compare the workings of the universe to a clock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Grant |first=Edward |authorlink=Edward Grant |title= A Sourcebook in Medieval Science |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |location=Cambridge, MA |date=Jan 1974 |isbn=0-674-82360-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hannam |first=James |title=[[God's Philosophers]] |publisher=Icon Books |location=London |publication-date=6 Aug 2009 |isbn=978-1-84831-070-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin emphasises how much of later thought, not only in science, was built on a foundation of revived scholasticism, not Renaissance humanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Franklin |first=James |title=Science by conceptual analysis: the genius of the late scholastics |journal=Studia Neoaristotelica |volume=9 |issue=1 |date=2012 |pages=3–24 |issn=1214-8407 |doi=10.5840/studneoar2012911 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

But little of importance occurs in any other branches of science in the two centuries between Oresme and Copernicus.{{Says who|date=August 2015}} Like other historians of this period, Franklin attributes the decline to the plague of 1348–1350, ([[Black Death|the black death]]), which killed a third of the people in Europe. [[Johan Huizinga]]'s examination of this period, ''The Waning of the Middle Ages'',&lt;ref name="huizinga"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Huizinga |first=Johan |authorlink=Johan Huizinga |title=Herfsttij der middeleeuwen |trans-title=[[The Waning of the Middle Ages]] |edition=2nd |location=London |publisher=E. Arnold &amp; Co. |year=1924 |others=Translated by Frederik Hopman }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests a tendency towards elaborate [[semiotics|theory of signs]], which Franklin compares with the degeneracy of modern Marxism. He cites the late Renaissance naturalist [[Ulisse Aldrovandi|Aldrovandi]], who considered his account of the snake incomplete until he had treated it in its anatomical, heraldic, allegorical, medicinal, anecdotal, historical and mythical aspects.  He marks the 15th century as coinciding with the decline of literature. Chaucer died in 1400; the next writers that are widely read are Erasmus, More, Rabelais and Machiavelli, just after 1500.  "It is hard to think of any writer in English between Chaucer and Spenser who is now read even by the most enthusiastic students.  The gap is almost two hundred years."  He points to the development of [[astrology]] and [[alchemy]] in the heyday of the Renaissance.&lt;ref name="franklin"/&gt;

Franklin concedes that in painting the Renaissance really did excel, but that unfortunately the artistic skill of the Renaissance concealed its incompetence in anything else.  He cites [[Leonardo Da Vinci|Da Vinci]], who was supposed to be good at everything, but who on examination, "had nothing of importance to say on most subjects".  (A standard history of mathematics, according to Franklin ([[Eric Temple Bell|E. T. Bell]]'s ''The Development of Mathematics'', 1940), says that "Leonardo's published jottings on mathematics are trivial, even puerile, and show no mathematical talent whatever."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bell |first=E.T |authorlink=Eric Temple Bell |title=The Development of Mathematics |edition=Reprint 2nd |publisher=Dover Publications |location=New York |publication-date=2 September 1992 |series=Dover Books on Mathematics |isbn=0-486-27239-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) The invention of printing he compares to television, which produced "a flood of drivel catering to the lowest common denominator of the paying public, plus a quantity of propaganda paid for by the sponsors".&lt;ref name="franklin"/&gt;

The philosopher and historian Robert Pasnau makes a similar, but more extreme{{Says who|date=August 2015}} claim that "modernity came in the late twelfth century, with [[Averroes]]' magisterial revival of Aristotle and its almost immediate embrace by the Latin West."&lt;ref name="pasnau"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pasnau |first=Robert |title=A Theory of Secondary Qualities |journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research |volume=73 |issue=3 |date=Nov 2006 |pages=568–591 |issn=0031-8205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pasnau argues that in some branches of [[17th century philosophy]], the insights of the [[scholasticism|scholastic era]] fall into neglect and disrepute.  He disputes the modernist view of medieval thought as subservient to the views of Aristotle.  By contrast "scholastic philosophers agree among themselves no more than does any group of philosophers from any historical period."&lt;ref name="pasnau" /&gt;{{rp|561}}  Furthermore, the almost unknown period between 1400 and 1600 was not barren, but gave rise to vast quantities of material, much of which still survives.  This complicates any generalizations about the supposedly novel developments in the seventeenth-century.  He claims that the concerns of scholasticism are largely continuous with the central themes of the modern era, that [[early modern philosophy]], though different in tone and style, is a natural progression out of later medieval debates, and that a grasp of the scholastic background is essential to an understanding of the philosophy of [[Descartes]], [[John Locke|Locke]], and others.&lt;ref name="pasnau" /&gt;

== Graham and Saliba ==
In 1973, [[Angus Charles Graham|A. C. Graham]] criticized the notion of "modern science", arguing that "The question may also be raised whether [[Ptolemy]] or even [[Copernicus]] and [[Kepler]] were in principle any nearer to modern science than the [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese]] and the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], or indeed than the [[Babylonian astronomy|first astronomer]], whoever he may have been, who allowed observations to outweigh numerological considerations of symmetry in his calculations of the month and the year." In 1999, [[George Saliba]], in his review of Toby E. Huff's ''The Rise of Early Modern Science: Islam, China and the West'', also criticized the notion of "modern science", arguing how one would define terms like "modern science" or "modernity". After quoting Graham, Saliba notes that "the empirical emphasis placed by that very first astronomer on the value of his observations set the inescapable course to modern science. So where would the origins of modern science then lie?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=George |last=Saliba |author-link=George Saliba |date=Autumn 1999 |title=Seeking the Origins of Modern Science? |journal=Bulletin of the Royal Institute for Inter-Faith Studies |volume=1 |issue=2 |url=http://www.riifs.org/review_articles/review_v1no2_sliba.htm |accessdate=2008-01-25 |issn=1466-2361 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509062023/http://www.riifs.org/review_articles/review_v1no2_sliba.htm |archivedate=2008-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grant ==
In ''The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages'', [[Edward Grant]] argues that the origins of modern science lie in the Middle Ages and was due to a combination of four factors:&lt;ref name=Grant&gt;{{cite book |last=Grant |first=Edward |authorlink=Edward Grant |title=The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages: Their Religious, Institutional, and Intellectual Contexts |series=Cambridge History of Science |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge |publication-date=13 Oct 1996 |isbn=0-521-56137-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"Translations into [[Latin]] of [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] scientific texts in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries; the development of [[Medieval university|universities]], which were uniquely Western and used the translations as the basis of a science curriculum; the adjustments of [[Christianity]] to secular learning and the transformation of [[Aristotle]]'s natural philosophy."}}

==Hatfield==
Gary Hatfield, in his "Was the Scientific Revolution Really a Revolution of Science?", argues that while the "Scientific Revolution" of the 17th century did have several individual "revolutions", he does not consider the period to be a "scientific" revolution. Some of his reasons include science still being tied to [[metaphysics]] at the time, experimental [[physics]] not being separated from [[natural philosophy]] until the end of the 18th century, and comparable individual "revolutions" in different sciences continued occurring before and after the 17th century, such as the [[optical]] revolution of [[Michael Faraday|Faraday]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hatfield |first=Gary |chapter=Was the Scientific Revolution Really a Revolution in Science? |editor1-first=F. Jamil |editor1-last=Ragep |editor2-first=Sally P. |editor2-last=Ragep |editor3-last=Livesey |editor3-first=Steven John |publication-date=July 1996 |title=Tradition, Transmission, Transformation: Proceedings of Two Conferences on Pre-Modern Science Held at the University of Oklahoma  |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] |series=Collection de Travaux de l'Académie Internationale d'Histoire des Sciences |volume=37 |isbn=90-04-10119-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bala==
Another contrary view has been recently proposed by [[Arun Bala]] in his [[dialogue|dialogical]] history of the birth of modern science. Bala proposes that the changes involved in the Scientific Revolution — the [[Philosophy of mathematics|mathematical realist]] turn, the mechanical [[philosophy]], the [[atomism]], the central role assigned to the Sun in [[Copernican heliocentrism]] — have to be seen as rooted in [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] influences on Europe.  He sees specific influences in [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]]'s physical optical theory, [[History of science and technology in China|Chinese mechanical technologies]] leading to the perception of the world as a [[machine]], the [[Hindu-Arabic numeral system]], which carried implicitly a new mode of [[Atomism#Indian atomism|mathematical atomic thinking]], and the heliocentrism rooted in ancient Egyptian religious ideas associated with [[Hermeticism]]. Bala argues that by ignoring such [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] impacts we have been led to a [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] conception of the Scientific Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bala |first=Arun |title=The Dialogue of Civilizations in the Birth of Modern Science |location=New York |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |publication-date=15 Sep 2008 |isbn=1-4039-7468-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics note that lacking documentary evidence of transmission of specific scientific ideas, Bala's model will remain "a working hypothesis, not a conclusion".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sobol |first=Peter G |title=Book Review: The Dialogue of Civilizations in the Birth of Modern Science |journal=Isis |volume=98 |issue= 4 |pages=829–830 |publication-date=Dec 2007 |publisher= [[University of Chicago Press]] on behalf of [[History of Science Society]] |doi=10.1086/529293 |issn=0021-1753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:CorinneHeline.jpg|thumb|Corinne Heline (1872 -1975)]] --&gt;

'''Corinne Heline''' (August 18, 1882 in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] – July 26, 1975) was an American author, Christian [[Christian mysticism|mystic]], and [[occultist]] who published 28 books.

Born to the well-to-do Duke family, part of the aristocracy of the [[Old South]], she received a large inheritance at age 16 that allowed her to self-publish her works.

Heline received a classical and religious education. She was a lifelong student of the [[esoteric knowledge|ancient mysteries]]. [[Rosicrucian]] Initiate [[Max Heindel]] became her teacher at [[Mount Ecclesia]], where she met another [[New Age]] pioneer, [[Theodore Heline]], who became her husband in 1938 and undertook the publication of her mystical and occult writings.&lt;ref&gt;Heline, Corinne (1971). ''The Blessed Virgin Mary'' Back Cover. New Age Press, Black Mtn., NC. {{ISBN|0-87613-074-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her magnum opus ''The New Age Bible Interpretation'' (1954) in seven volumes was followed by many other works interpreting the ancient wisdom. She is known worldwide among students of [[esotericism]] and [[occultism]], and also in [[New Age]] circles as a pioneer, opening the way to vast new fields of investigation related to the coming [Age of Aquarius].&lt;ref&gt;Heline, Corinne (1971). ''The Blessed Virgin Mary'' Back Cover. New Age Press, Black Mtn., NC. {{ISBN|0-87613-074-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heline joined the New Age Bible and Philosophy Center at [[Santa Monica, California]], which took the [[motto]] "''Devoted to studies designed to aid the modern seeker to a spiritual reorientation in the Light of the Ancient Wisdom.''"

'''''Dasein''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈdaːzaɪn}}) is a [[German language|German]] word that means "being there" or "presence" (German: ''[[wikt:da#German|da]]'' "there"; ''[[wikt:sein#German|sein]]'' "being"), and is often translated into English with the word "existence". It is a fundamental concept in the [[existential philosophy]] of [[Martin Heidegger]], particularly in his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' ''[[Being and Time]]''. Heidegger uses the expression ''Dasein'' to refer to the experience of [[being]] that is peculiar to human beings. Thus it is a form of being that is aware of and must confront such issues as [[person]]hood, [[Death|mortality]] and the dilemma or paradox of living in relationship with other humans while being ultimately alone with oneself.

==Heidegger's re-interpretation==
In German, ''Dasein'' is the vernacular term for "existence", as in "I am pleased with my existence" (''Ich bin mit meinem Dasein zufrieden''). The term has been used by several philosophers before Heidegger, most notably [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], with the meaning of human "existence" or "presence". It is derived from ''da-sein'', which literally means ''being-there/there-being''&lt;ref name="Cultural Criticism 1995 p. 70"&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;—though Heidegger was adamant that this was an inappropriate translation of ''Dasein''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hubert Dreyfus|Dreyfus, H. L.]], ''Being-in-the-World: A Commentary on Heidegger's Being and Time'' ([[Cambridge, MA]]: [[MIT Press]], 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;
Dasein for Heidegger can be a way of being involved with and caring for the immediate world in which one lives, while always remaining aware of the contingent element of that involvement, of the priority of the world to the self, and of the evolving nature of the self itself.&lt;ref name="Cultural Criticism 1995 p. 70"/&gt;

The opposite of this authentic self is everyday and inauthentic Dasein, the forfeiture of one's individual meaning, destiny and lifespan, in favour of an (escapist) immersion in the public everyday world—the anonymous, identical world of the They and the Them.&lt;ref&gt;J. Collins/H. Selina, ''Heidegger for Beginners'' (1998) p. 64-81&lt;/ref&gt;

In harmony with [[Nietzsche]]'s critique of the [[subject (philosophy)#Nietzsche's critique of the subject|subject]], as something definable in terms of consciousness,  Heidegger distinguished Dasein from everyday consciousness in order to emphasize the critical importance "Being" has for our understanding and interpretation of the world, and so on.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"This entity which each of us is himself…we shall denote by the term “Dasein”" (Heidegger, trans. 1927/1962, p.27).&lt;ref name="Heidegger, M. 1962"&gt;Heidegger, M. (1962). ''[[Being and Time]]'', Translated by John Macquarrie &amp; Edward Robinson. London: S.C.M. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

"[Dasein is] that entity which in its Being has this very Being as an issue…" (Heidegger, trans. 1927/1962, p.68).&lt;ref name="Heidegger, M. 1962"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Heidegger sought to use the concept of ''Dasein'' to uncover the primal nature of "[[Being]]" (''Sein''), agreeing with Nietzsche and [[Wilhelm Dilthey|Dilthey]]&lt;ref&gt;J. Collins/H. Selina, ''Heidegger for Beginners'' (1998) p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; that ''Dasein'' is always a being engaged in the world: neither a subject, nor the objective world alone, but the coherence of [[Being-in-the-world]]. This ontological basis of Heidegger's work thus opposes the Cartesian "abstract agent" in favour of practical engagement with one's environment.&lt;ref&gt;J. Collins/H. Selina, ''Heidegger for Beginners'' (1998) p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; Dasein is revealed by projection into, and engagement with, a personal world&lt;ref&gt;H. Phillipse, ''Heidegger's Philosophy of Being'' (1999) p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;—a never-ending process of involvement with the world as mediated through the projects of the self.&lt;ref name="Cultural Criticism 1995 p. 70"/&gt;

Heidegger considered that language, everyday curiosity, [[logical system]]s, and common beliefs obscure ''Dasein's'' nature from itself.&lt;ref&gt;J. Collins/H. Selina, ''Heidegger for Beginners'' (1998) p. 69-70&lt;/ref&gt;  [[bad faith (existentialism)|Authentic choice]] means turning away from the collective world of Them, to face ''Dasein'', one's individuality, one's own limited life-span, one's own being.&lt;ref&gt;J. Collins/H. Selina, ''Heidegger for Beginners'' (1998) p. 81-9&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger thus intended the concept of ''Dasein'' to provide a stepping stone in the questioning of what it means to ''be''—to have one's own being, one's own death, one's own truth.&lt;ref&gt;E. Roudinesco, ''Jacques Lacan'' (2005) p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidegger also saw the question of ''Dasein'' as extending beyond the realms disclosed by positive science or in the history of [[metaphysics of presence|metaphysics]].  “Scientific research is not the only manner of Being which this entity can have, nor is it the one which lies closest. Moreover, Dasein itself has a special distinctiveness as compared with other entities; [...] it is ontically distinguished by the fact that, in its very Being, that Being is an issue for it.”&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, Martin. "The Ontological Priority of the Question of Being." Being and Time / Translated by John Macquarrie &amp; Edward Robinson. London: S.C.M., 1962. 32&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[Being and Time]]'' stressed the ontological difference between entities and the being ''of'' entities: “Being is always the Being of an entity.”&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, Martin. "The Ontological Priority of the Question of Being." Being and Time / Translated by John Macquarrie &amp; Edward Robinson. London: S.C.M., 1962. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Establishing this difference is the general motif running through ''Being and Time''.

Some scholars disagree with this interpretation, however, arguing that for Heidegger "''Dasein''" denoted a structured awareness or an institutional "way of life".&lt;ref&gt;See John Haugeland's article [http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/faculty/files/haugeland/Reading+Brandom+Reading+Heidegger.pdf "Reading Brandom Reading Heidegger"]&lt;/ref&gt; Others suggest that Heidegger's early insistence on the ontological priority of Dasein was muted in his post-war writings.&lt;ref&gt;H. Phillipse, ''Heidegger's Philosophy of Being'' (1999) p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin and inspiration ==
Some have argued for an origin of ''Dasein'' in [[Chinese philosophy]] and [[Japanese philosophy]]: according to [[Tomonobu Imamichi]], Heidegger's concept of ''Dasein'' was inspired—although Heidegger remained silent on this—by [[Okakura Kakuzo]]'s concept of ''das-in-der-Welt-sein'' (being-in-the-worldness, worldliness) expressed in ''[[The Book of Tea]]'' to describe [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]]'s [[Taoist]] philosophy, which Imamichi's teacher had offered to Heidegger in 1919, after having followed lessons with him the year before.&lt;ref name=Imamichi&gt;Tomonubu Imamichi, ''In Search of Wisdom. One Philosopher's Journey'', Tokyo, International House of Japan, 2004 (quoted by {{Interlanguage link multi|Anne Fagot-Largeault|fr}} at her [http://www.college-de-france.fr/default/EN/all/phi_sci/p1184676830986.htm lesson] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206183341/http://www.college-de-france.fr/default/EN/all/phi_sci/p1184676830986.htm |date=February 6, 2009 }} at the [[College of France]] of 7 December 2006) &lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Existenz (Jaspers)}}

== Karl Jaspers' ''Dasein'' and ''Existenz'' ==

For [[Karl Jaspers]], the term "''Dasein''" meant existence in its most minimal sense, the realm of objectivity and science, in opposition to what Jaspers called "''Existenz''", the realm of [[authenticity (philosophy)|authentic]] being. Due to the drastically different use of the term "''Dasein''" between the two philosophers, there is often some confusion in students who begin with either Heidegger or Jaspers and subsequently study the other.

In ''Philosophy'' (3 vols, 1932), Jaspers gave his view of the history of philosophy and introduced his major themes. Beginning with modern science and empiricism, Jaspers points out that as we question reality, we confront borders that an empirical (or scientific) method can simply not transcend. At this point, the individual faces a choice: sink into despair and resignation, or take a [[leap of faith]] toward what Jaspers calls "Transcendence". In making this leap, individuals confront their own limitless freedom, which Jaspers calls ''Existenz'', and can finally experience authentic existence.

== Other applications ==
[[Eero Tarasti]] considered ''Dasein'' very important in ''Existential Semiotics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Existential semiotics |series=Advances in semiotics |first=Eero |last=Tarasti |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=2000 |isbn=9780253337221 |pages=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Lacan]] turned in the 1950s to Heidegger's Dasein for his characterisation of the [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] as being-for-death:  (''être-pour-la-mort'').&lt;ref&gt;E. Roudinesco, ''Jacques Lacan'' (1999) p. 249-50&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, he saw the analysand as searching for authentic speech, as opposed to “the subject who loses his meaning in the objectifications of discourse...[which] will give him the wherewithal to forget his own existence and his own death”.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits'' (1997) p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred Schutz]] distinguished between direct and indirect social experience, emphasising that in the latter “My orientation is not towards the existence (''Dasein'') of a concrete individual Thou. It is not towards any subjective experiences now being constituted in all their uniqueness in another's mind”,&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Schutz, ''The Phenomenology of the Social World'' (1997) p. 183.  [[Nader El-Bizri]] uses the existential analytic of ''Dasein'' in an interpretation of the conception of the 'soul' (''nafs'') in [[Avicenna]]'s psychology that moves away from subjectivity towards what El-Bizri refers to as 'field-of-being' and 'soul-field'; see: [[Nader El-Bizri]], ''The Phenomenological Quest Between Avicenna and Heidegger'' (Albany: SUNY Press, 2014), 2nd print of the 2000 edition by Global Publications of the State University of New York, Binghamton, cf. p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Theodor W. Adorno]] criticised Heidegger's concept of Dasein as an idealistic retreat from historical reality.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks eds., ''The Jameson Reader'' (2005) p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Rorty]] considered that with Dasein, Heidegger was creating a conservative myth of being, complicit with the [[Romantic epistemology|Romantic]] elements of National Socialism.&lt;ref&gt;J. Collins/H. Selina, ''Heidegger for Beginners'' (1998) p. 170 and p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26655">[[File:Circular definition of musicality.png|thumb|[[Circular definition]] of "musicality"]]

A '''definition of music''' endeavors to give an accurate and concise explanation of music's basic attributes or essential nature and it involves a process of [[definition|defining]] what is meant by the term ''[[music]]''. Many authorities have suggested definitions, but defining music turns out to be more difficult than might first be imagined and there is ongoing debate. A number of explanations start with the notion of music as ''organized sound'' but they also highlight that this is perhaps too broad a definition and cite examples of organized sound that are not defined as music, such as [[human speech]], and sounds found in both [[Natural environment|natural]] and [[Industrial society|industrial]] environments {{harv|Kania|2014}}. The problem of defining music is further complicated by the influence of [[culture in music cognition]]. 

The ''Concise Oxford Dictionary'' defines music as "the art of combining vocal or instrumental sounds (or both) to produce beauty of form, harmony, and expression of emotion" {{harv|Concise Oxford Dictionary|1992}}. However, the music genres known as [[noise music]] and [[musique concrète]], for instance, challenge these ideas about what constitutes music's essential attributes by using sounds not widely considered as musical, like randomly produced electronic [[Distortion (music)|distortion]], [[Audio feedback|feedback]], [[Noise (radio)|static]], [[Phonaesthetics|cacophony]], and compositional processes using [[Indeterminacy (music)|indeterminacy]] ({{harvnb|Priest|2013|loc=132}}; {{harvnb|Hagerty|2007}}).

An oft cited notable example of the dilemma in defining music is a work entitled ''[[4'33'']]'' (1952) by the American composer [[John Cage]] (1912–1992). The written score has three movements and directs the performer(s) to appear on stage, indicate by gesture or other means when the piece begins, then make no sound and only mark sections and the end by gesture. What is heard are only whatever ambient sounds may occur in the room. Some argue this is not music because, for example, it contains no sounds that are conventionally considered "musical" and the composer and performer(s) exert no control over the organization of the sounds heard {{harv|Dodd|2013}}. Others argue it is music because the conventional definitions of musical sounds are unnecessarily and arbitrarily limited, and control over the organization of the sounds is achieved by the composer and performer(s) through their gestures that divide what is heard into specific sections and a comprehensible form {{harv|Gann|2010}}.


==Concepts of music==

Because of differing fundamental concepts of music, the languages of many cultures do not contain a word that can be accurately translated as "music," as that word is generally understood by Western cultures {{harv|Nettl|2005}}. [[Inuit]] and most [[North American Indian]] languages do not have a general term for music. Among the [[Aztecs]], the ancient [[Mexico|Mexican]] theory of rhetorics, poetry, dance, and instrumental music used the [[Nahuatl]] term ''In xochitl-in kwikatl'' to refer to a complex mix of music and other poetic verbal and non-verbal elements, and reserve the word ''Kwikakayotl'' (or cuicacayotl) only for the sung expressions {{harv|Leon-Portilla|2007|loc=11}}. In [[Africa]] there is no term for music in [[Tiv language|Tiv]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Efik language|Efik]], [[Berom language|Birom]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]], [[Idoma language|Idoma]], [[Eggon language|Eggon]] or [[Jarawa language (Nigeria)|Jarawa]]. Many other languages have terms which only partly cover what Western culture typically means by the term ''music'' ({{harvnb|Schafer|1996|loc=222-223}}). The [[Mapuche]] of [[Argentina]] do not have a word for ''music'', but they do have words for instrumental versus improvised forms (''kantun''), European and non-Mapuche music (''kantun winka''), ceremonial songs (''öl''), and ''tayil'' {{harv|Robertson–de Carbo|1976|loc=39}}.

While some languages in West Africa have no term for music, some West African languages accept the general concepts of music ({{harvnb|Nettl|1989|loc=48}}). ''Musiqi'' is the [[Persian language|Persian]] word for the science and art of music, ''muzik'' being the sound and performance of music ({{harvnb|Sakata|1983|loc=39}}), though some things European-influenced listeners would include, such as [[Quran]] chanting, are excluded.

==Music vs. noise==
[[Ben Watson (music writer)|Ben Watson]] points out that [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s ''[[Große Fuge|Grosse Fuge]]'' (1825) "sounded like noise" to his audience at the time. Indeed, Beethoven's publishers persuaded him to remove it from its original setting as the last movement of a string quartet. He did so, replacing it with a sparkling ''Allegro''. They subsequently published it separately {{harv|Watson|n.d.|loc=109–10}}.{{Clarify|date=October 2015}}&lt;!--Is this meant to differentiate "music" from "noise", or to assert that the two things may not be indistinguishable?--&gt; Musicologist [[Jean-Jacques Nattiez]] considers the difference between noise and music nebulous, explaining that "The border between music and noise is always culturally defined—which implies that, even within a single society, this border does not always pass through the same place; in short, there is rarely a consensus&amp;nbsp;... By all accounts there is no ''single'' and ''intercultural'' universal concept defining what music might be" {{harv|Nattiez|1990|loc=48, 55}}.

==Definitions==

===Organized sound===
{{See also|Musique concrete|Acousmatic music|Spectral music}} 
An often-cited definition of music is that it is "organized sound", a term originally coined by [[modernist]] composer [[Edgard Varèse]] {{harv|Goldman|1961|loc=133}} in reference to his own musical aesthetic. Varèse's concept of music as "organized sound" fits into his vision of "sound as living matter" and of "musical space as open rather than bounded" {{harv|Chou|1966a|loc=1&amp;ndash;4}}. He conceived the elements of his music in terms of "sound-masses", likening their organization to the natural phenomenon of [[crystallization]] {{harv|Chou|1966b|loc=157}}. Varèse thought that "to stubbornly conditioned ears, anything new in music has always been called [[Noise in music|noise]]", and he posed the question, "what is music but organized noises?" {{harv|Varèse and Chou|1966|loc=18}}.

The fifteenth edition of the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' states that "while there are no sounds that can be described as inherently unmusical, musicians in each culture have tended to restrict the range of sounds they will admit." A human organizing element is often felt to be implicit in music (sounds produced by non-human agents, such as waterfalls or birds, are often described as "musical", but perhaps less often as "music"). The composer [[R. Murray Schafer|R. Murray]] {{harvtxt|Schafer|1996|loc=284}} states that the sound of classical music "has decays; it is granular; it has attacks; it fluctuates, swollen with impurities—and all this creates a musicality that comes before any 'cultural' musicality." However, in the view of semiologist [[Jean-Jacques Nattiez]], "just as music is whatever people choose to recognize as such, noise is whatever is recognized as disturbing, unpleasant, or both" {{harv|Nattiez|1990|loc=47&amp;ndash;48}}. (See "[[Definition of music#Social construct|music as social construct]]" below.)'''''

====Language====
{{Main|Musical language}}
Levi R. Bryant defines music not as a language, but as a marked-based, problem-solving method such as mathematics {{harv|Ashby|2004|loc=4}}.

===Musical universals===
{{main|Elements of music}}
Most definitions of music include a reference to sound and a list of universals of music can be generated by stating the elements (or aspects) of sound: [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], [[timbre]], [[loudness]], [[duration (music)|duration]], spatial location and [[Texture (music)|texture]] ({{harvnb| Burton |2015|loc=22–28}}). However, in terms more specifically relating to music: following [[Wittgenstein]], cognitive psychologist [[Eleanor Rosch]] proposes that categories are not clean cut but that something may be more or less a member of a category {{harv|Rosch|1973|loc=328}}. As such the search for musical universals would fail and would not provide one with a valid definition {{harv|Levitin|2006|loc=136–39}}. This is primarily because other cultures have different understandings in relation to the sounds that English language writers refer to as music.

===Social construct===
{{main|Ethnomusicology}}
Many people do, however, share a general idea of music. The Websters definition of music is a typical example: "the science or art of ordering tones or sounds in succession, in combination, and in temporal relationships to produce a composition having unity and continuity" (''Webster's Collegiate Dictionary'', online edition).

===Subjective experience===
{{main|Aesthetics of music}}

This approach to the definition focuses not on the ''construction'' but on the ''experience'' of music. An extreme statement of the position has been articulated by the  Italian composer [[Luciano Berio]]: “Music is everything that one listens to with the intention of listening to music” {{harv|Berio, Dalmonte, and Varga|1985|loc=19}}. This approach permits the boundary between music and noise to change over time as the conventions of musical interpretation evolve within a culture, to be different in different cultures at any given moment, and to vary from person to person according to their experience and proclivities. It is further consistent with the subjective reality that even what would commonly be considered music is experienced as nonmusic if the mind is concentrating on other matters and thus not perceiving the sound's ''essence'' ''as music'' {{harv|Clifton|1983|loc=9}}.

==Specific definitions==

===Clifton===
In his 1983 book, ''Music as Heard'', which sets out from the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] position of [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty|Merleau-Ponty]], and [[Paul Ricoeur|Ricœur]], Thomas Clifton defines music as "an ordered arrangement of sounds and silences whose meaning is [[Presentationism|presentative]] rather than [[Denotation|denotative]]. . . . This definition distinguishes music, as an end in itself, from compositional technique, and from sounds as purely physical objects." More precisely, "music is the actualization of the possibility of any sound whatever to present to some human being a meaning which he experiences with his body—that is to say, with his mind, his feelings, his senses, his will, and his metabolism" {{harv|Clifton|1983|loc=1}}. It is therefore "a certain reciprocal relation established between a person, his behavior, and a sounding object" {{harv|Clifton|1983|loc=10}}.

Clifton accordingly differentiates music from non-music on the basis of the human behavior involved, rather than on either the nature of compositional technique or of sounds as purely physical objects. Consequently, the distinction becomes a question of what is meant by musical behavior: "a musically behaving person is one whose very being is absorbed in the significance of the sounds being experienced." However, "It is not altogether accurate to say that this person is listening ''to'' the sounds. First, the person is doing more than listening: he is perceiving, interpreting, judging, and feeling. Second, the preposition 'to' puts too much stress on the sounds as such. Thus, the musically behaving person experiences musical significance by means of, or through, the sounds" {{harv|Clifton|1983|loc=2}}.

In this framework, Clifton finds that there are two things that separate music from non-music: (1) musical meaning is presentative, and (2) music and non-music are distinguished in the idea of personal involvement. "It is the notion of personal involvement which lends significance to the word ''ordered'' in this definition of music" {{harv|Clifton|1983|loc=3–4}}. This is not to be understood, however, as a sanctification of extreme [[relativism]], since "it is precisely the 'subjective' aspect of experience which lured many writers earlier in this century down the path of sheer opinion-mongering. Later on this trend was reversed by a renewed interest in 'objective,' scientific, or otherwise non-introspective musical analysis. But we have good reason to believe that a musical experience is not a purely private thing, like [[seeing pink elephants]], and that reporting about such an experience need not be [[Subject (philosophy)|subjective]] in the sense of it being a mere matter of opinion" {{harv|Clifton|1983|loc=8–9}}.

Clifton's task, then, is to describe musical experience and the objects of this experience which, together, are called "phenomena," and the activity of describing phenomena is called "phenomenology" {{harv|Clifton|1983|loc=9}}. It is important to stress that this definition of music says nothing about aesthetic standards. &lt;blockquote&gt;Music is not a fact or a thing in the world, but a meaning constituted by human beings. . . . To talk about such experience in a meaningful way demands several things. First, we have to be willing to let the composition speak to us, to let it reveal its own order and significance. . . . Second, we have to be willing to question our assumptions about the nature and role of musical materials. . . . Last, and perhaps most important, we have to be ready to admit that describing a meaningful experience is itself meaningful. {{harv|Clifton|1983|loc=5–6}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Nattiez===
"Music, often an [[art]]/[[entertainment]], is a [[total social fact]] whose definitions vary according to [[era]] and [[culture]]," according to [[Jean Molino|Jean]] {{harvtxt|Molino|1975|loc=37}}. It is often contrasted with [[noise (environmental)|noise]]. According to musicologist [[Jean-Jacques Nattiez]]: "The border between music and noise is always culturally defined—which implies that, even within a single society, this border does not always pass through the same place; in short, there is rarely a consensus.... By all accounts there is no ''single'' and ''intercultural'' universal concept defining what music might be" {{harv|Nattiez|1990|loc=47&amp;ndash;8 and 55}}. Given the above demonstration that "there is no limit to the number or the genre of variables that might intervene in a definition of the musical," {{harv|Molino|1975|loc=42}} an organization of definitions and elements is necessary.

Nattiez (1990, 17) describes definitions according to a [[wikt:tripartite|tripartite]] semiological scheme similar to the following:
{|
|-
|colspan=3|Poietic Process
|colspan=2|Esthesic Process
|-
|Composer (Producer)
| →
|Sound (Trace)
| ←
|Listener (Receiver)
|}

There are three levels of description, the poietic, the neutral, and the esthesic:
*"&lt;!-- If musical semiology's sole contribution were replacing what everybody calls "composition" and "perception" with barbarou neologisms like 'poietic' and 'esthesic', then semiology would entail risibly small profits. There is, of course, more to it than that. --&gt; By 'poietic' I understand describing the ''link'' among the composer's intentions, his creative procedures, his mental schemas, and the ''result'' of this collection of strategies; that is, the components that go into the work's material embodiment. Poietic description thus also deals with a quite special form of hearing (Varese called it 'the interior ear'): what the composer hears while imagining the work's sonorous results, or while experimenting at the piano, or with tape."
*"By 'esthesic' I understand not merely the artificially attentive hearing of a musicologist, but the description of perceptive behaviors within a given population of listeners; that is how this or that aspect of sonorous reality is captured by their perceptive strategies" {{harv|Nattiez|1990|loc=90}}.
*The neutral level is that of the physical "trace", (Saussere's sound-image, a sonority, a score), created and interpreted by the esthesic level (which corresponds to a perceptive definition; the perceptive and/or "social" construction definitions below) and the poietic level (which corresponds to a creative, as in compositional, definition; the organizational and social construction definitions below).

Table describing types of definitions of music {{harv|Nattiez|1990|loc=46}}:
{| class="wikitable"
!
!poietic level&lt;br/&gt;(choice of the composer)
!neutral level&lt;br/&gt;(physical definition)
!esthesic level&lt;br/&gt;(perceptive judgment)
|-
! music
| musical sound
| sound of the&lt;br/&gt;harmonic&lt;br/&gt;spectrum
| agreeable sound
|-
! non-music
| noise&lt;br/&gt;(nonmusical)
| noise&lt;br/&gt;(complex sound)
| disagreeable&lt;br/&gt;noise
|}

Because of this range of definitions, the study of music comes in a wide variety of forms. There is the study of sound and [[oscillation|vibration]] or [[acoustics]], the cognitive study of music, the study of [[music theory]] and performance practice or music theory and [[ethnomusicology]] and the study of the reception and history of music, generally called [[musicology]].

===Xenakis===
Composer [[Iannis Xenakis]] in "Towards a Metamusic" (chapter 7 of ''Formalized Music'') defined music in the following way {{harv|Xenakis|1971|loc=181}}:
#It is a sort of comportment necessary for whoever thinks it and makes it.
#It is an individual [[pleroma]], a realization.
#It is a fixing in sound of imagined virtualities (cosmological, philosophical, . . ., arguments)
#It is normative, that is, unconsciously it is a model for being or for doing by sympathetic drive.
#It is catalytic: its mere presence permits internal psychic or mental transformations in the same way as the crystal ball of the hypnotist.
#It is the gratuitous play of a child.
#It is a mystical (but atheistic) asceticism. Consequently, expressions of sadness, joy, love and dramatic situations are only very limited particular instances.

[[File:Usmcmessnight.jpg|right|thumb|Mess Night at Camp Lejeune]]
[[File:Dining-in.jpg|right|thumb|Dining in at Fort Dix, New Jersey]]
'''Dining in''' is a formal [[military]] ceremony for members of a [[Company (military unit)|company]] or other [[Military organization|unit]], which includes a dinner, drinking, and other events to foster [[camaraderie]] and ''[[Morale|esprit de corps]]''.

The [[United States Army]], the [[United States Navy]], the [[United States Coast Guard]], and the [[United States Air Force]] refer to this event as a '''dining in''' or '''dining-in.''' The [[United States Marine Corps]] refers to it as '''mess night'''. Other names include '''regimental dinner''', '''guest night''', '''formal mess dinner''', and '''band night'''.&lt;ref name=MCO_P5060.20_ch24&gt;{{cite book|accessdate=

|chapter=Chapter 24: Mess Night
|title=Marine Corps Drill and Ceremonies Manual |series=MCO P5060.20
|publisher=United States Marine Corps
|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dining in is a formal event for all unit members, male and female; though some specialized mess nights can be officer- or enlisted-only. The unit [[chaplain]] is usually also invited, if an [[invocation]] is needed. A unit's dining-in consists of only the members of the unit, with the possible exception of the guest(s) of honor. An optional formal dinner, known as the '''dining-out''' may include spouses and other guests. The dining-out follows the same basic rules of the dining-in, but is often tailored to minimize some of the military traditions and be more approachable to civilian guests.

&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==
The practice of dining in is thought to have formally begun in 16th-century [[England]], in [[Monastery|monasteries]] and [[University|universities]]; though some records indicate that militaries have held formal dinners as far back as the [[Roman Legion]]s. The [[Viking]]s held formal ceremonies to honor and celebrate battles and heroes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.marines.mil/news/publications/Pages/MCO%20P5060.20%20W%20CH%201%20PT%204.aspx 
|series=MCO P5060.20
|title=Marine Corps Drill and Ceremonies Manual
|chapter=Appendix D: History, Customs and Courtesies, and Traditions of the Mess Night
}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 18th century, the [[British Army]] incorporated the practice of formal dining into their [[regiment]]al mess system. Customs and rules of the mess were soon institutionalized rules, known as the "[[Queen's Regulations]]". The mess night or "Dining in" became a tradition in all British regiments. The Americans, taking many of their traditions from the British military, held mess nights in the 18th and 19th century, but the tradition waned after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

Dining in took a temporary halt in the Navy and Marine Corps when [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Navy Secretary]] [[Josephus Daniels]] imposed prohibition of alcoholic drink, but soon the tradition was restored.  During [[World War II]], the custom was revived in the [[Military of the United States|U.S. military]], initially in the  [[US Army Air Forces]] [[8th Air Force]], which was based in Britain.  [[US Army Air Forces|AAF]]Officers were invited to participate in British military hosted Mess Nights and then were obligated to reciprocate.

==British traditions==

===Formal Functions===
A Formal function is one at which all mess members may be required to attend and Service Personnel are on official duty.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = JSP 456 Part 2 Volume 1 Chapter 6 Food Service Management|last = |first = |publisher = Ministry of Defence|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = 6-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entitlements for official functions are as follows:

=== Officers' Mess ===
12 Formal Functions per annum. Generally these are 2 x seasonal balls and 10 x other functions (e.g. Mess Dinners) as agreed by mess committees.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Warrant Officers’ &amp; Senior Rates/Sergeants’ Mess ===
6 Formal Functions per annum. Generally these are 2 x seasonal balls and 4 x other functions (e.g. Mess Dinners) as agreed by mess committees.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Loyal Toast ===
The [[Port wine|port]]
decanters are to be placed at pre-determined places and in front of the President and Vice President. The President and Vice President will remove the stoppers simultaneously and pass the decanters in a clockwise direction/to the left. Wine stewards are to follow the decanters round the table with a jug of water, filling the glass of any diner who declines port or madeira. The glasses of the President and Vice President will be filled last, after which they are to re-stop the decanters. All stewards may then be required to leave the dining room before the President calls upon the Vice President to propose the [[Loyal toast|Loyal Toast]]. It should be remembered that whilst the Army and RAF stand for the Loyal Toast, the RN remain seated. Also, whilst passing the port, the RN would ensure the decanter does not leave the table whilst in the RAF; it is passed from hand to hand without touching the table. In the Army, it will depend on the traditions of the Regiment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Army===
By the late 18th century, the British Army's "mess night" developed formal rules, as a result of troops being stationed in remote areas. Officers elected mess committees to conduct their meals. Towards the latter part of the 19th century, attending officers were expected to adhere to the rigid etiquette of  [[Victorian era|Victorian-era]] society.

In modern times it is sometimes known as a "regimental dinner".

===Royal Navy and Royal Marines===
[[Royal Navy]] officers have the privilege of remaining seated when toasting the Sovereign. Some sources state that this privilege was granted by [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]]. A popular story states that [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] was on board his namesake ship [[HMS Royal Charles (1655)|''Royal Charles'']] and had bumped his head on the low overhead of the [[wardroom]] when he stood up to reply a toast that had been drunk to him. He stated that henceforth, naval officers would never again rise to toast a British sovereign. In 1964, Queen [[Elizabeth II]] extended the privilege to the [[Royal Marines]] in honour of their 300th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Connell|first1=Royal W.|last2=Mack|first2=William P.|title=Naval Ceremonies, Customs, and Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wvKiBiWKrzMC&amp;printsec=frontcover|pages=105–6|publisher=[[Naval Institute Press]]|year=2004|location=[[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]]|isbn=9781557503305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The custom of "dining in" to welcome new officers and "dining out" to farewell retiring officers originated with the British, although the term came about much later. It has been discontinued in some countries such as the United States but is still practised by the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibowicz|first=Charles J.|title=Mess Night Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Vo62GFJlpoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|pages=22–23|year=2007|publisher=[[AuthorHouse]]|isbn=9781425984465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Toasts at Sea ====
The traditional toasts after dinner for ships at sea are shown below. On certain days, an alternative toast is available but the first one is most usual.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Sunday ‘Absent friends’ or ‘Absent friends and those at sea’ 

Monday ‘Our ship at sea’ or ‘Our native land’ 

Tuesday ‘Our Sailors’ 

Wednesday ‘Ourselves’ (as no one is likely to concern themselves with our welfare)’ or ‘Ourselves – Our swords’ 

Thursday ‘A bloody war or a sickly season’ 

Friday ‘A willing foe and sea room’ ‘Fox hunting and old port’ 

Saturday ‘Our Families’

==== Trafalgar Night ====
For [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]] Night Mess Dinners, the routine varies slightly from a normal dinner night. When the main course is about to be served, the Baron of Beef is first paraded around the table behind a drummer. Similarly, before commencing the service of the sweet, the Ships of the Line are also paraded around the table in a similar fashion to the Beef. The toasts used at dinner on Trafalgar Night are:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# [[Elizabeth II|Her Majesty the Queen]].
# The immortal memory of Admiral/[[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]] and his comrades.
# Our distinguished guests (if appropriate).

===Royal Air Force===
The [[Royal Air Force]] inherited many mess traditions from the [[British Army]] as a former corps. These customs were notably passed on the [[United States Army Air Forces|US Army Air Forces]] during [[World War II]] as British and American crew served alongside one another in close quarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wing dining out: History, heritage, tradition, legacy vital to Air Force way of life|url=http://www.warren.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123095990|publisher=[[Francis E. Warren Air Force Base|warren.af.mil]]|date=25 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. traditions==
Portions of the event tend to become quite humorous in nature, while others remain somber. [[Etiquette]] requires a diner to know what is appropriate at any given time.

The dining in follows established protocols. After a brief cocktail period of 30 to 45 minutes, the presiding officer, known as the "President of the Mess", announces, "Please be seated." The group will then retire to the dining area to be seated.

After tasting the [[meat]] (usually [[beef]]), the President will declare it "tasty and fit for human consumption", after which the meal will be served to the diners. After the [[dessert]] is finished, the President will invite the chief steward to bring forth [[wine]] and/or [[Punch (drink)|punch]] to be served, and [[Toast (honor)|toasting]] will begin. After the toasts have concluded, the floor will be opened to the levying of fines. The president and the guest of honor will have the opportunity to speak if they so desire. After this, the mess is often then returned to an open cocktail hour, and then the evening concludes with final honors.

==Formal toasts==
[[File:Navy-invite.jpg|right|thumb|U.S. Navy Mess Night Invitation, 1986]]
Formal toasts are the heart of the formal dining in. A junior officer, known as  "Mr/Madam Vice",  proposes a toast to the guests, at which the guests remain seated. After this, various parties will offer toasts to the [[Commander in Chief]], to the heads of state of a visiting or host nations, to their branch of service, to the units, and to the fallen members of the military.

|}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Notice that the United States does not have a king, queen, or Prime Minister, and that the commander in chief and President are the same person.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The final and most solemn toast is always to fallen comrades. Often this tribute is marked with a [[Missing man table|table setting dedicated to those military members killed, captured, or missing in action]].&lt;ref name=ALMAR020-07&gt;The Marine Corps mandates a tribute to fallen Marines: {{cite web|accessdate=

Some unusual forms of toasting are common to the U.S. and Canadian traditions. In the [[Toronto Scottish Regiment]], for example, a [[loyal toast]] to the regiment's Colonel-in-Chief (Currently the Prince of Wales) is performed standing with one foot on the chair and one foot on the dining table, facing a portrait of the C-in-C and drinking after the piper has played.&lt;ref name=Russell1980 /&gt; Others, particularly Scottish regiments,&lt;ref name=Lang1996 /&gt; perform toasts in the same way with one foot on a chair and one on the table.&lt;ref name=Gibowicz2007 /&gt; This is a frequent form of toasting in the United States Marine Corps as well.&lt;ref name=Gibowicz2007 /&gt; In the Scottish form, the glass is raised, lowered, brought out, and brought in, as the words of the toast, usually including some form of "Up", "Down", "To you", "To me", are recited, and finally drunk to the cry "Drink it up!" or similar.&lt;ref name=Lang1996 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gibowicz2007 /&gt;

=== Violations of etiquette and other traditions ===
Violations of the formal [[etiquette]] of the dining in are "punished", generally with fines. The following are examples of what could be considered "Violations of the Mess": 
* untimely arrival at proceedings
* smoking at the table before the lighting of the [[smoking lamp]]
* haggling over date of rank
* improper wear of uniform
** inverted [[cummerbund]] (Note that U.S. Army regulation ''requires'' that cummerbunds be worn ''upside down'': i.e. pleats down.)&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Dep't of Army, Reg. 670-1, Wear and Appearance of Army Uniforms and Insignia para 24-10b (3 Feb. 2005). “The cummerbund is worn … with pleats facing down.”&lt;/ref&gt;
** wearing a clip-on bow tie at an obvious [[List (watercraft)|list]]
* [[Error#Gaff|gaffes]]
** loud and obtrusive remarks in a foreign language
** [[foul language]]
** discussion on a controversial topic (politics, religion, and women are commonly forbidden topics)
* improper toasting procedure
** toasting with an uncharged (''empty'') glass
** rising to applaud particularly witty, succinct, sarcastic, or relevant toasts, unless following the example of the President
* leaving the dining room without permission from the President of the Mess
* carrying cocktails into the dining area before the conclusion of dinner
* haggling over penalties or fines imposed
* drawing a sword except in ceremony &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=

At some mess nights, violators of the mess are obliged to publicly drink from a [[grog]] bowl in front of the mess attendees. The grog is sometimes contained in a [[toilet]] bowl, consisting of various alcoholic beverages mixed together. As a more disgusting effect, the grog may also contain floating solids, such as meatballs, raw [[oysters]], or [[Tootsie Rolls]]. The tradition of drinking grog originated with the British Navy. [[Grog]] consisted of the regulation rum ration diluted with water to discourage binge drinking. In modern times, grog comes in two varieties: alcoholic and non-alcoholic, the latter of which may contain anything that will make it less appealing to the taste, including hot sauce. For additional effect, the drinker may be required to [[drinking from shoes|drink from a boot]].

In addition to visiting the grog bowl and paying fines, violators may be sentenced to sing songs, tell jokes, do pushups, or perform menial tasks to entertain the mess. In most cases, when a violator has been identified, he or she is given the opportunity to provide a rebuttal or defense for the violation, which rarely results in the violator being excused for the offense, and usually only results in more punishment.

Traditionally, all fines collected throughout the night are split amongst the stewards that served the attendees as a token of appreciation for their efforts. The fines can also be used to pay for the drinks consumed, while some units have used the Mess Night as a fund raiser (often to pay for a ball).

Members of the mess may also be singled out for some good-natured ribbing and teasing. In some units, members go out of their way to be picked on, often wearing obvious uniform violations, such as crowns, tiaras, eye-patches, bowties and cummerbunds of the wrong color, and other items that have no place on any military uniform (although it is common for US Artillerymen to wear red socks, suspenders and even bowties, in a nod to tradition at the expense of uniform regulations). Some will attempt to leave sabotaging evidence on or around others they wish to see fined, so care must be taken to not be the butt of a joke.

Navy and Marine traditions also include that no diner may leave the hall to use the restroom without permission until Mr. Vice suggests that the company "shed a tear for [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Admiral Nelson]]", a reference to the fact that his body was preserved in a barrel of [[brandy]] after his death at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]].

Most Messes attempt to furnish the night with military music and marches, with live bands if possible, or recorded music. Depending on how formal the ceremony is, the diners may be required to march to their seats.

In recent times, Marines have established a variant of the mess in a "field environment",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usmc1.us/usmc_mess_night.html |title=USMC Customs and Traditions: Marine Corps Mess Night |last=Bartlett |first=Lieutenant Colonel Merrill L. |date=November 1996 |publisher=usmc1.us |accessdate=19 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317021713/http://www.usmc1.us/usmc_mess_night.html |archivedate=17 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; substituting in [[mess dress]] for [[Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform|utilities]] and [[List of United States Marine Corps individual equipment|combat equipment]] (to include camouflage [[facepaint]]), canteen cups, and tentage, while still retaining the formal nature of the ceremony.

'''Eli Eduardo de Gortari''' ([[Mexico City|Mexico City, Federal District, Mexico]], April 28, 1918 – July 29, 1991) was a [[logic]]ian, [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] and [[engineering|engineer]].

== Biography ==

Elí de Gortari was a student of the Engineering School of the National Autonomous University of Mexico ([[UNAM]], Spanish acronym), matriculating in 1938. His goal was to become an engineer, which he achieved in two years. His commitment to public welfare led him to enroll in sanitation engineering, but he continued his studies of mathematics and philosophy. Eventually, in 1948, he would become a professor of philosophy of science. In 1949 he obtained a master's degree in philosophy and published a thesis "The Science of Logic" in the Soviet Union.

== Works ==

Among his published works are: ''The Science of Logic'' (1950); ''The Dialectic of Physics'' (1964); ''General Logic'' (1965); ''Introduction to Dialectic Logic'' (1956); ''Science in Mexican History'' (1963); ''Seven Essays on Modern Science'' (1969); ''The Dialectic Method'' (1970); ''Elements of Mathematical Logic'' (1983); ''Science and Consciousness in Mexico: 1767-1783'' (1973); ''Science Methods'' (1977); ''University Reform Today and Tomorrow'' (1987), where he recounts his battles as an education activist; and the  ''Dictionary of Logic'' (1988).

'''''Epistemological Letters''''' was a hand-typed, mimeographed "underground" newsletter about [[quantum physics]] that was distributed to a private mailing list, described by the physicist [[John Clauser]] as a "quantum subculture", between 1973 and 1984.&lt;ref name=Clauser2002p62&gt;[[John Clauser|Clauser, John F.]] (2002). "Early History of Bell's Theorem", in R. A. Bertlmann and A. Zeilinger (eds.). ''Quantum (Un)speakables: From Bell to Quantum Information''. Springer, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wiC0SEdQ454C&amp;pg=PA62 62].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For 1973–1984, see [http://www.abebooks.com/Epistemological-letters-Lettres-%C3%A9pist%C3%A9mologiques-18-issues/3815681832/bd "Epistemological letters"], Abe Books ([http://archive.is/3k2TN archived]), and [https://www.amazon.com/Epistemological-letters-Lettres-%C3%A9pist%C3%A9mologiques-issues/dp/B004HSBLLS "Epistemological letters"], Amazon. Andrew Whitaker gives the dates as 1974–1984; see {{harvnb|Whitaker|2012|p=145}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Distributed by a Swiss foundation, the newsletter was created because mainstream academic journals were reluctant to publish articles about the [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|philosophy of quantum mechanics]], especially anything that implied support for ideas such as [[Quantum nonlocality|action at a distance]].&lt;ref name=Kaiser121&gt;[[David Kaiser|Kaiser, David]] (2011). ''How the Hippies Saved Physics: Science, Counterculture, and the Quantum Revival''. New York and London: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, pp.&amp;nbsp;121–122; Kaiser, David (2010). "How the Hippies Saved Physics", Cambridge Science Festival, from [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lpf15w6voc&amp;t=37m35s 00:37:35].&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-six or thirty-seven issues of ''Epistemological Letters'' appeared, each between four and eighty-nine pages long.&lt;ref&gt;For 36 issues, see [http://www.abebooks.com/Epistemological-letters-Lettres-%C3%A9pist%C3%A9mologiques-18-issues/3815681832/bd "Epistemological letters"], Abe Books; for 37 issues and number of pages, see {{harvnb|Whitaker|2012|p=145}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Several well-known scientists published their work there, including the physicist [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]], the originator of [[Bell's theorem]].&lt;ref name=Kaiser121/&gt; According to Clauser, much of the early work on Bell's theorem was published only in ''Epistemological Letters''.&lt;ref name=Clauser2002p62/&gt;

==Interpretations of quantum physics==
{{further|Interpretations of quantum mechanics}}
According to the Irish physicist Andrew Whitaker, a powerful group of physicists centred on [[Niels Bohr]], [[Wolfgang Pauli]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]] made clear that "there was no place in physics&amp;nbsp;– no jobs in physics!&amp;nbsp;– for anybody who dared to question the [[Copenhagen interpretation]]" (Bohr's interpretation) of quantum theory.{{sfn|Whitaker|2012|pp=1–2}} John Clauser writes that any inquiry into the "wonders and peculiarities" of quantum mechanics and [[quantum entanglement]] that went outside the "party line" was prohibited, in what he argues amounted to an "evangelical crusade".&lt;ref name=Clauser2002p62/&gt; [[Samuel Abraham Goudsmit|Samuel Goudsmit]], editor of the prestigious ''[[Physical Review]]'' and ''[[Physical Review Letters]]'' until he retired in 1974,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bederson |first1=Benjamin |title=Essay: Samuel Abraham Goudsmit (1902–1978) |url=https://journals.aps.org/prl/edannounce/PhysRevLett.101.010002 |journal=Physical Review Letters|date=30 June 2008 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.010002}}&lt;/ref&gt; imposed a formal ban on the philosophical debate, issuing instructions to referees that they should feel free to reject material that even hinted at it.&lt;ref name=Kaiser121/&gt;

==Alternative publications==
Articles questioning the mainstream position were therefore distributed in alternative publications, and ''Epistemological Letters''  became one of the main conduits. The newsletter was sent out by the 
L'Institut de la Méthode of the Association Ferdinand Gonseth,&lt;ref name=Whitaker2012p145/&gt; which had been established in honour of the philosopher [[:fr:Ferdinand Gonseth|Ferdinand Gonseth]].&lt;ref name=Kaiser121/&gt; It described itself as "an open and informal journal allowing confrontation and ripening of ideas before publishing in some adequate journal."&lt;ref name=Whitaker2012p145/&gt; According to Clauser, it announced that the usual stigma against discussing certain ideas, such as [[Hidden variable theory|hidden-variable theories]], was to be absent.&lt;ref name=Clauser2002p62/&gt; The newsletter's editors included [[Abner Shimony]].&lt;ref name=Whitaker2012p145/&gt;

Several eminent physicists published their material in ''Epistemological Letters'', including John Bell, the originator of Bell's theorem.&lt;ref name=Kaiser121/&gt; Clauser writes that much of the early work on Bell's theorem was published only in ''Epistemological Letters''.&lt;ref name=Clauser2002p62/&gt; Bell's paper, "The Theory of Local Beables" (''beable'', as opposed to ''observable'', referring to something that exists independently of any observer), appeared there in March 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whitaker|2012|pp=181–182}}; [[John Stewart Bell|Bell, J. S.]] (1975).

"Colloquium on Bell's Theorem", ''Epistemological Letters'', 1081.&lt;/ref&gt; [[H. Dieter Zeh]] published a paper in the ''Letters'' on the [[many-minds interpretation]] of quantum mechanics in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[[H. Dieter Zeh|Zeh, H. Dieter]] (1981).

'''Folmer Wisti''' f . Visti Folmer Jensen (May 8, 1908, Vroue, Denmark – October 16, 2000) was a Danish director, associate professor and philologist. He was the first Slavic philologist from [[Aarhus University]]. Wisti was the instigator and leader of the [[Danish Cultural Institute]] (originally Danish Society) from 1940 to 1983. In 1974, he founded the Foundation for International Understanding, today known as the Folmer Wisti Foundation for International Understanding.

From 1976, he was also the organizer of conferences Europe of the regions as well as the information sheet, Regional Contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4lYLbUPCL-oC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=Folmer+Wisti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=r2ToVID3B4b0UqifgYgG&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Folmer%20Wisti&amp;f=false |title=National Relations: Public Diplomacy, National Identity and the Swedish ... - Nikolas Glover - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FOxsBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA88-IA4&amp;dq=Folmer+Wisti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=r2ToVID3B4b0UqifgYgG&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Folmer%20Wisti&amp;f=false |title=Denmark: A Social Laboratory: Independent Farmers and Co-Operatives, Folk ... - Peter Manniche - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date=2013-10-22 |accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frederick Grinnell''' (born 1945 in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]) is an American [[Cell biology|cell biologist]], also known for his work in  [[bioethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work= Science Progress |url=http://www.scienceprogress.org/2009/08/lab-bench-ethics/ |title=Lab Bench Ethics |publisher=ScienceProgress.org |date=2009-08-19 |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, he is the Robert McLemore Professor of Medical Science in the department of cell biology at [[UT Southwestern Medical Center]] in Dallas, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;http://profiles.utsouthwestern.edu/profile/12808/frederick-grinnell.html&lt;/ref&gt; He took his undergraduate degree in chemistry at [[Clark University]] (1966) and Ph.D. in biochemistry at [[Tufts University]] (1970). He joined the faculty at UT Southwestern in 1972 and founded the Ethics in Science and Medicine Program and Ethics Grand Rounds in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work= Southwestern Medicine Annual Review |url=http://www4.utsouthwestern.edu/FrederickGrinnell/SouthwesternMedicine2000.PDF |title=Exploring Ethics in Medicine |publisher=UT Southwestern |year=2000 |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grinnell's scientific work contributed to the discovery of the biological adhesion protein [[fibronectin]] and helped to establish the importance of fibronectin in [[wound repair]]. Subsequently, his laboratory helped popularize the use of wound exudate to analyze the human wound environment and made the discovery that [[chronic wound]]s contain degraded fibronectin and high levels of proteolytic enzymes. Subsequently, his research focused on the biomechanics of [[fibroblasts]] interacting with three dimensional [[collagen]] matrices.

In bioethics, Grinnell engages in cross-disciplinary work at the boundary between science and philosophy. His goal is to inform public policy and to advance science education and public understanding of science. He has published two books: ''The Scientific Attitude'' (now is in its 2nd edition)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guilford.com/cgi-bin/cartscript.cgi?page=pr/grinnell.htm&amp;dir=polphil&amp;cart_id=980751.20092 |title=Guilford Press:The Scientific Attitude, Second Edition |publisher=Guilford.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Everyday Practice of Science: Where Intuition and Passion Meet Objectivity and Logic''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/everyday-practice-of-science-9780199794652?q=grinnell&amp;lang=en&amp;cc=us |title=Oxford University Press: Everyday Practice of Science |publisher=OUP.com |date= |accessdate=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="155769">A '''fuzzy concept''' is a [[concept]] of which the boundaries of application can vary considerably according to context or conditions, instead of being fixed once and for all.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Haack]], ''Deviant logic, fuzzy logic: beyond the formalism''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; This means the concept is [[Vagueness|vague]] in some way, lacking a fixed, precise meaning, without however being unclear or meaningless altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dietz &amp; Sebastiano Moruzzi (eds.), ''Cuts and clouds. Vagueness, Its Nature, and Its Logic.'' Oxford University Press, 2009; Delia Graff &amp; Timothy Williamson (eds.), ''Vagueness''. London: Routledge, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; It has a definite meaning, which can be made more precise only through further elaboration and specification - including a closer definition of the context in which the concept is used. The study of the characteristics of fuzzy concepts and fuzzy language is called ''fuzzy semantics''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Timothy Williamson]], ''Vagueness''. London: Routledge, 1994, p. 124f; [[Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "Quantitative fuzzy semantics". ''Information Sciences'', Vol. 3, No. 2, April 1971, pp. 159-176.&lt;/ref&gt; The inverse of a "fuzzy concept" is a "crisp concept" (i.e. a precise concept). 

A fuzzy concept is understood by scientists as a concept which is "to an extent applicable" in a situation. That means the concept has ''gradations'' of significance or ''unsharp'' (variable) boundaries of application. A fuzzy statement is a statement which is true "to some extent", and that extent can often be represented by a scaled value. The best known example of a fuzzy concept around the world is an amber [[traffic light]], and indeed fuzzy concepts are widely used in traffic control systems.&lt;ref&gt;Sandeep Mehan &amp; Vandana Sharma, "Development of traffic light control system based on fuzzy logic".  ''ACAI '11 Proceedings of the International Conference on Advances in Computing and Artificial Intelligence 2011'', pp. 162–165.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used these days in a more general, popular sense - in contrast to its technical meaning - to refer to a concept which is "rather vague" for any kind of reason.

In the past, the very idea of reasoning with fuzzy concepts faced considerable resistance from academic elites. They did not want to endorse the use of imprecise concepts in research or argumentation. Yet although people might not be aware of it, the use of fuzzy concepts has risen gigantically in all walks of life from the 1970s onward. That is mainly due to advances in electronic engineering, fuzzy mathematics and digital computer programming. The new technology allows very complex inferences about "variations on a theme" to be anticipated and fixed in a program.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bart Kosko]], ''Fuzzy Thinking: The New Science of Fuzzy Logic.'' New York: Hyperion, 1993; [[Bart Kosko]], ''Heaven in a chip: fuzzy visions of society and science in the digital age''. New York: Three Rivers Press, 1999; Daniel McNeill &amp; Paul Freiberger, ''Fuzzy Logic: The Revolutionary Computer Technology that Is Changing Our World.'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1994. Charles Elkan, "The paradoxical success of fuzzy logic." ''IEEE Expert'', August 1994.[https://www.sfu.ca/~jeffpell/papers/ElkanIEEEdiscussion.pdf] A useful overview of the field is provided in: Radim Bělohlávek, [[Joseph W. Dauben]] &amp; [[George J. Klir]], ''Fuzzy Logic and Mathematics: A Historical Perspective''. Oxford University Press, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The new [[neuro-fuzzy]] computational methods make it possible, to identify, to measure and respond to fine gradations of significance, with great precision.&lt;ref&gt;A useful overview is provided in: Enrique Ruspini et al. ''Handbook of fuzzy computation''. Bristol &amp; Philadelphia: Institute of Physics Publishing, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; It means that practically useful concepts can be coded and applied to all kinds of tasks, even if, ordinarily, these concepts are never precisely defined. Nowadays engineers, statisticians and programmers often represent fuzzy concepts mathematically, using fuzzy logic, fuzzy values, fuzzy variables and fuzzy sets.&lt;ref&gt;Radim Behlohlavek &amp; George J. Klir (eds.), ''Concepts and fuzzy logic''. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Problems of vagueness and fuzziness have probably always existed in human experience.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Seising et al., ''On fuzziness: homage to Lotfi A. Zadeh'', Vol. 2. Heidelberg: Springer, 2013, p. 656; Ellen Christiaanse, "1.5 million years of information systems; from hunters-gatherers to the domestication of the networked computer". In: David Avison et al., ''The past and future of information systems: 1976-2006 and beyond''. New York: IFIP/Springer, 2006, pp. 165-176.&lt;/ref&gt; The boundary between different things can appear blurry. Sometimes people have to think, when they are not in the best frame of mind to do it, or, they have to talk about something out there, which just isn't sharply defined. Across time, however, philosophers and scientists began to reflect about those kinds of problems, in much more systematic ways.

===Sorites paradox===
The ancient [[Sorites paradox]] first raised the logical problem of how we could exactly define the threshold at which a change in quantitative gradation turns into a qualitative or categorical difference.&lt;ref&gt;Rosanna Keefe &amp; Peter Smith, ''Vagueness: a reader.'' Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; With some physical processes this threshold is relatively easy to identify. For example, water turns into steam at 100&amp;nbsp;°C or 212&amp;nbsp;°F (the boiling point depends partly on atmospheric pressure, which decreases at higher altitudes). 

With many other processes and gradations, however, the point of change is much more difficult to locate, and remains somewhat vague. Thus, the boundaries between qualitatively different things may be ''unsharp'': we know that there are boundaries, but we cannot define them exactly. 

According to the modern idea of the [[continuum fallacy]], the fact that a statement is to an extent vague, does not automatically mean that it is invalid. The problem then becomes one of how we could ascertain the kind of validity that the statement does have.

===Loki's wager===
The Nordic myth of [[Loki's wager]] suggested that concepts that lack precise meanings or precise boundaries of application cannot be usefully discussed at all.&lt;ref&gt;Massimo Pigliucci &amp; Maarten Boudry (eds.), ''Philosophy of Pseudoscience: Reconsidering the Demarcation Problem''. University of Chicago Press, 2013, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 20th century idea of "fuzzy concepts" proposes that "somewhat vague terms" can be operated with, since we can explicate and define the variability of their application, by assigning numbers to gradations of applicability. This idea sounds simple enough, but it had large implications.

===Precursors===
The intellectual origins of the species of fuzzy concepts as a logical category have been traced back to a diversity of famous and less well-known thinkers,&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Rescher]], ''Many-Valued Logic''. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; including (among many others) [[Eubulides]], [[Plato]], [[Cicero]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]],&lt;ref&gt;Angelica Nuzzo, "Vagueness and Meaning Variance in Hegel’s Logic". In: Angelica Nuzzo, ''Hegel and the analytical tradition''. New York: Continuum International Publishing Group, 2010, pp. 61-82.
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert L. Carneiro]], "The transition from quantity to quality; a neglected causal mechanism in accounting for social evolution". ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'' (''PNAS''), Vol. 97 No. 23, 7 November 2000, pp. 12926-12931.[http://www.pnas.org/content/97/23/12926.full.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Hugh MacColl]],&lt;ref&gt;S. Rahman &amp; J. Redmond, "Hugh MacColl and the Birth of Logical Pluralism". In: ''Handbook of History of Logic'', Vol. 4. Elsevier, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles S. Peirce]],&lt;ref&gt;Mihai Nadin, "The logic of vagueness", in: Eugene Freeman (ed.), ''The Relevance of Charles Peirce''. La Salle, Ill.: Open Court, 1983, pp. 154-166.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Black]],&lt;ref&gt;Max Black, "Vagueness: An exercise in logical analysis". ''Philosophy of Science'', Vol. 4, 1937, pp. 427–455. Max Black, "Reasoning with Loose Concepts".

In: Jan Łukasiewicz, ''Selected Works''. Amsterdam: North Holland Publishing Company, 1970, pp. 87-88.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emil Leon Post]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Emil Leon Post]], "Introduction to a general theory of elementary propositions". ''American Journal of Mathematics'', Vol. 43, No. 3, July 1921, p. 163-185.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Tarski]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Tarski]], ''Logic, semantics, metamathematics''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georg Cantor]], [[Nicolai A. Vasiliev]],&lt;ref&gt;Valentine Bazhanov, "The fate of one forgotten idea: N. A. Vasiliev and his imaginary logic." ''Studies in Soviet Thought'', Vol.39 No. 3, 1990, pp.333-341.[http://staff.ulsu.ru/bazhanov/russian/fatevas1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kurt Gödel]], [[Stanisław Jaśkowski]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Haack]] notes that [[Stanisław Jaśkowski]] provided axiomatizations of many-valued logics in:  Jaśkowski, "On the rules of supposition in formal logic". ''Studia Logica'' No. 1, 1934.[http://www.logik.ch/daten/jaskowski.pdf] See Susan Haack, ''Philosophy of Logics''. Cambridge University Press, 1978, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Donald Knuth]].&lt;ref&gt;Priyanka Kaushal, Neeraj Mohan and Parvinder S. Sandhu, "Relevancy of Fuzzy Concept in Mathematics". ''International Journal of Innovation, Management and Technology'', Vol. 1, No. 3, August 2010.[http://ijimt.org/papers/58-M450.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Across at least two and a half millennia, all of them had something to say about graded concepts with unsharp boundaries. This suggests at least that the awareness of the existence of concepts with "fuzzy" characteristics, in one form or another, has a very long history in human thought. Quite a few logicians and philosophers have also tried to ''analyze'' the characteristics of fuzzy concepts as a recognized species, sometimes with the aid of some kind of [[many-valued logic]] or [[substructural logic]].

An early attempt in the post-WW2 era to create a theory of sets where set membership is a matter of degree was made by Abraham Kaplan and Hermann Schott in 1951. They intended to apply the idea to empirical research. Kaplan and Schott measured the degree of membership of empirical classes using real numbers between 0 and 1, and they defined corresponding notions of intersection, union, complementation and subset.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Kaplan and Hermann F. Schott, "A calculus for empirical classes", ''Methodos'', Vol. 3, 1951, pp. 165–188.&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the time, their idea "fell on stony ground".&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Williamson, ''Vagueness''. London: Routledge, 1996, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. Barkley Rosser|J. Barkley Rosser Sr.]] published a treatise on many-valued logics in 1952, anticipating "many-valued sets".&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Barkley Rosser|J. Barkley Rosser Sr.]] and Atwell R. Turquette, ''Many-valued logics''. Amsterdam: North-Holland Publishing Company, 1952, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Another treatise was published in 1963 by Aleksandr A. Zinov'ev and others&lt;ref&gt;Aleksandr A. Zinov'ev, David Dinsmore Comey and Guido Küng, ''Philosophical problems of many-valued logic''. Dordrecht: D. Reidel, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, the American philosopher [[William Alston]] introduced the term "degree vagueness" to describe vagueness in an idea that results from the absence of a definite cut-off point along an implied scale (in contrast to "combinatory vagueness" caused by a term that has a number of logically independent conditions of application).&lt;ref&gt;William P. Alston, ''Philosophy of Language''. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall, 1964, p. 87; William P. Alston, “Vagueness,” in Paul Edwards (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', vol. 8. New York: Macmillan, first edition 1967, pp. 218–221; William P. Alston, ''A Realist Conception of Truth''. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1996 p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The German mathematician Dieter Klaua [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Klaua] published a German-language paper on fuzzy sets in 1965,&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Klaua. "Über einen Ansatz zur mehrwertigen Mengenlehre". ''Monatsberichte der Deutschen Akademie der Wissenschaften'' (Berlin), Vol. 7, pp. 859–867, 1965. Siegfried Gottwald, "An early approach toward graded identity and graded membership in set theory". ''Fuzzy Sets and Systems''. Vol. 161 Issue 18, September 2010, pp. 2369–2379.&lt;/ref&gt; but he used a different terminology (he referred to "many-valued sets", not "fuzzy sets").&lt;ref&gt;Siegfried Gottwald, "Shaping the logic of fuzzy set theory". In: Cintula, Petr et al. (eds.), ''Witnessed years. Essays in honour of Petr Hájek''. London: College Publications, 2009, pp. 193–208. [http://www.uni-leipzig.de/~logik/gottwald/Hajek09.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two popular introductions to many-valued logic in the late 1960s were by Robert J. Ackermann and [[Nicholas Rescher]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Robert John Ackermann, ''An introduction to many-valued logics''. London, Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1967; Nicholas Rescher, ''Many-Valued Logic''. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Rescher’s book includes a bibliography on fuzzy theory up to 1965, which was extended by Robert Wolf for 1966-1974.&lt;ref&gt; Robert G. Wolf, “A survey of many-valued logic (1966–1974)”, in: J. Michael Dunn and George Epstein (eds.), ''Modern Uses of Multiple-Valued Logic''. Dordrecht: D. Reidel, 1977, 167–323.&lt;/ref&gt; Haack provides references to significant works after 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Haack]], ''Deviant logic, fuzzy logic: beyond the formalism''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Bergmann provides a more recent (2008) introduction to fuzzy reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Merrie  Bergmann, ''An  Introduction  to  Many-Valued  and  Fuzzy  Logic: Semantics, Algebras, and Derivation Systems''. Cambridge University Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lotfi Zadeh===
Usually the Iranian-born American computer scientist [[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] (1921-2017) is credited with inventing the specific idea of a "fuzzy concept" in his seminal 1965 paper on fuzzy sets, because he gave a formal mathematical presentation of the phenomenon that was widely accepted by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "Fuzzy sets". In: ''Information and Control'', Vol. 8, June 1965, pp. 338–353.{{cite web|url=http://www-bisc.cs.berkeley.edu/Zadeh-1965.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127005930/http://www-bisc.cs.berkeley.edu/Zadeh-1965.pdf |archivedate=2007-11-27 |df= See also A.

''Nature'', 29 October 2014.[https://www.nature.com/news/the-top-100-papers-1.16224]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mid-1960s, many scholars have contributed to elaborating the theory of reasoning with graded concepts, and the research field continues to expand.&lt;ref&gt;Radim Bělohlávek, Joseph W. Dauben &amp; George J. Klir, ''Fuzzy Logic and Mathematics: A Historical Perspective''. Oxford University Press, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The ordinary scholarly definition of a concept as "fuzzy" has been in use from the 1970s onward.

===Criteria===
Radim Bělohlávek explains:

{{Quotation|"There exists strong evidence, established in the 1970s in the psychology of concepts... that human concepts have a graded structure in that whether or not a concept applies to a given object is a matter of degree, rather than a yes-or-no question, and that people are capable of working with the degrees in a consistent way. This finding is intuitively quite appealing, because people say "this product is more or less good" or "to a certain degree, he is a good athlete", implying the graded structure of concepts. In his classic paper, Zadeh called the concepts with a graded structure ''fuzzy concepts'' and argued that these concepts are a rule rather than an exception when it comes to how people communicate knowledge. Moreover, he argued that to model such concepts mathematically is important for the tasks of control, decision making, pattern recognition, and the like. Zadeh proposed the notion of a ''[[fuzzy set]]'' that gave birth to the field of ''[[fuzzy logic]]''..."&lt;ref&gt;Radim Bělohlávek, "What is a fuzzy concept lattice? II", in: Sergei O. Kuznetsov et al. (eds.), ''Rough sets, fuzzy sets, data mining and granular computing.'' Berlin: Springer Verlag, 2011, pp. 19–20.[http://belohlavek.inf.upol.cz/publications/BeVy_Wifcl.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Hence, a concept is generally regarded as "fuzzy" in a logical sense if:
*defining characteristics of the concept apply to it "to a certain degree or extent" (or, more unusually, "with a certain magnitude of likelihood").&lt;ref&gt;The vast majority of scientific or scholarly users of the idea of fuzzy concepts refer to scaled (graded)  characteristics, and not to the variations in the ''likelihoods'' of their applicability.&lt;/ref&gt;
*or, the boundaries of applicability (the truth-value) of a concept can vary in degrees, according to different conditions. 
*or, the fuzzy concept itself straightforwardly consists of a [[fuzzy set]], or a combination of such sets.

The fact that a concept is fuzzy does not prevent its use in logical reasoning; it merely affects the type of reasoning which can be applied (see [[fuzzy logic]]). If the concept has gradations of meaningful significance, it is necessary to specify and formalize what those gradations are, if they can make an important difference. Not all fuzzy concepts have the same logical structure, but they can often be formally described or reconstructed using fuzzy logic or other [[substructural logic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolaos Galatos, Peter Jipsen, Tomasz Kowalski &amp; Hiroakira Ono, ''Residuated lattices: an algebraic glimpse at [[substructural logics]].'' Elsevier Science, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of this approach is, that numerical notation enables a potentially ''infinite'' number of truth-values between complete truth and complete falsehood, and thus it enables - in theory, at least - the greatest precision in stating the degree of applicability of a logical rule.

===Probability===
[[Petr Hájek]], writing about the foundations of fuzzy logic, sharply distinguished between "fuzziness" and "uncertainty":

{{Quotation|"The sentence "The patient is young" is true to some degree – the lower the age of the patient (measured e.g. in years), the more the sentence is true. Truth of a fuzzy proposition is a matter of degree. I recommend to everybody interested in fuzzy logic that they sharply distinguish fuzziness from uncertainty as a degree of belief (e.g. probability). Compare the last proposition with the proposition "The patient will survive next week". This may well be considered as a crisp proposition which is either (absolutely) true or (absolutely) false; but we do not know which is the case. We may have some probability (chance, degree of belief) that the sentence is true; but probability is not a degree of truth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Petr Hájek]], ''Metamathematics of fuzzy logic''. Dordrecht: Springer, 1998, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[metrology]] (the science of measurement), it is acknowledged that for any measure we care to make, there exists an [[Measurement uncertainty|amount of uncertainty]] about its accuracy, but this degree of uncertainty is conventionally expressed with a magnitude of likelihood, and not as a degree of truth. In 1975, [[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] introduced a distinction between "Type 1 fuzzy sets" without uncertainty and "[[Type-2 fuzzy sets and systems|Type 2 fuzzy sets]]" with uncertainty, which has been widely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "The Concept of a Linguistic Variable and Its Application to Approximate Reasoning–1", ''Information Sciences'', Vol. 8, pp. 199–249, 1975. Jerry M. Mendel and Robert I. Bob John, "Type-2 Fuzzy Sets Made Simple." ''IEEE transactions on fuzzy systems'', Vol. 10, No. 2, April 2002, pp. 117-127. Jerry M. Mendel, "Advances in type-2 fuzzy sets and systems". In: ''Information Sciences'' 177, 2007, pp. 84–110.[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.466.477&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Simply put, in the former case, each fuzzy number is linked to a non-fuzzy (natural) number, while in the latter case, each fuzzy number is linked to another fuzzy number.

==Applications==
===Philosophy===
In philosophical [[logic]] and linguistics, fuzzy concepts are often regarded as vague concepts which in their application, or formally speaking, are neither completely true nor completely false, or which are partly true and partly false; they are ideas which require further elaboration, specification or qualification to understand their applicability (the conditions under which they truly make sense).&lt;ref&gt;[[Delia Graff Fara]], "Shifting Sands: An Interest Relative Theory of Vagueness". ''Philosophical Topics'', Vol. 28 No. 1, 2000, pp. 45-81.&lt;/ref&gt; The "fuzzy area" can also refer simply to a ''residual'' number of cases which cannot be allocated to a known and identifiable group, class or set if strict criteria are used.

===Sciences===
In [[mathematics]] and [[statistics]], a fuzzy variable (such as "the temperature", "hot" or "cold") is a value which could lie in a probable [[Range (mathematics)|range]] defined by some quantitative limits or [[parameters]], and which can be usefully described with imprecise categories (such as "high", "medium" or "low") using some kind of [[Level of measurement|scale]] or conceptual hierarchy.

===Fuzzy logic===
{{main|Fuzzy logic}}
In mathematics and [[computer science]], the gradations of applicable meaning of a fuzzy concept are described in terms of ''quantitative'' relationships defined by logical operators. Such an approach is sometimes called "degree-theoretic semantics" by logicians and philosophers,&lt;ref&gt;Roy T. Cook, ''A dictionary of philosophical logic''. Edinburgh University Press, 2009, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; but the more usual term is [[fuzzy logic]] or [[many-valued logic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Rescher]], ''Many-valued logic''. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; The novelty of fuzzy logic is, that it "breaks with the traditional principle that [[formal system|formalisation]] should correct and avoid, but not compromise with, vagueness".&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Haack]], ''Philosophy of Logics''. Cambridge University Press, 1978, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic idea of fuzzy logic is that a real number is assigned to each statement written in a language, within a range from 0 to 1, where 1 means that the statement is completely true, and 0 means that the statement is completely false, while values less than 1 but greater than 0 represent that the statements are "partly true", to a given, quantifiable extent. [[Susan Haack]] comments:

{{Quotation|"Whereas in classical set theory an object either is or is not a member of a given set, in fuzzy set theory membership is a matter of degree; the degree of membership of an object in a fuzzy set is represented by some real number between 0 and 1, with 0 denoting ''no'' membership and 1 ''full'' membership."&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Haack]], ''Philosophy of Logics''. Cambridge University Press, 1978, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

"Truth" in this mathematical context usually means simply that "something is the case", or that "something is applicable". This makes it possible to analyze a distribution of statements for their truth-content, identify data patterns, make inferences and predictions, and model how processes operate. 

[[Petr Hájek]] claimed that "fuzzy logic is not just some "applied logic", but may bring "new light to classical logical problems", and therefore might be well classified as a distinct branch of "philosophical logic" similar to e.g. [[Modal logic|modal logics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Petr Hájek]], "Ten questions and one problem on fuzzy logic". ''Annals of Pure and Applied Logic'', Vol. 96, Issues 1-3, March 1999, 157-165, at p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Machinery &amp; analytics===

Fuzzy logic offers computationally-oriented systems of concepts and methods, to formalize types of reasoning which are ordinarily approximate only, and not exact. In principle, this allows us to give a definite, precise answer to the question, "To what extent is something the case?", or, "To what extent is something applicable?". Via a series of switches, this kind of reasoning can be built into electronic devices. That was already happening before fuzzy logic was invented, but using fuzzy logic in modelling has become an important aid in design, which creates many new technical possibilities.

Fuzzy reasoning (i.e., reasoning with graded concepts) turns out to have many practical uses.&lt;ref&gt;Kazuo Tanaka, ''An Introduction to Fuzzy Logic for Practical Applications''.

Humberto Bustince et al. (eds.), ''Fuzzy Sets and Their Extensions: Representation, Aggregation and Models. Intelligent Systems from Decision Making to Data Mining, Web Intelligence and Computer Vision.''  Berlin: Springer, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It is nowadays widely used in:

It looks like fuzzy logic will eventually be applied in almost every aspect of life, even if people are not aware of it, and in that sense fuzzy logic is an astonishingly successful invention.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.goldengooseaward.org/awardees/fuzzy-logic "2017 Golden Goose Awardee: Fuzzy Logic, Clear Impact"]&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific and engineering literature on the subject is constantly increasing.

===Community===
Originally lot of research on fuzzy logic was done by Japanese pioneers inventing new machinery, electronic equipment and appliances (see also [[Fuzzy control system]]).&lt;ref&gt;Michio Sugeno (ed.), ''Industrial applications of fuzzy control''. Amsterdam: North Holland, 1992; Andrew Pollack, "Technology; Fuzzy Logic For Computers". ''New York Times'', 11 October 1984; Andrew Pollack, "Fuzzy Computer Theory: How to Mimic the Mind?" ''New York Times'', 2 April 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea became so popular in Japan, that the English word entered Japanese language (ファジィ概念). "Fuzzy theory" (ファジー理論) is a recognized field in Japanese scientific research.

Since that time, the movement has spread worldwide; nearly every country nowadays has its own fuzzy systems association, although some are larger and more developed than others. In some cases, the local body is a branch of an international one. In other cases, the fuzzy systems program falls under [[artificial intelligence]] or [[soft computing]].

===Achievements===
[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] estimated around 2014 that there were more than 50,000 fuzzy logic–related, patented inventions. He listed 28 journals at that time dealing with fuzzy reasoning, and 21 journal titles on [[soft computing]]. His searches found close to 100,000 publications with the word "fuzzy" in their titles, but perhaps there are even 300,000.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "Factual Information about the Impact of Fuzzy Logic". Berkeley Initiative in Soft Computing, at Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences Department, University of Berkeley, California, circa 2014.[http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~zadeh/stimfl.html] For more details about the global fuzzy logic community, see [http://users.abo.fi/rfuller/fuzs.html].&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018, [[Google Scholar]] found 2,870,000 titles which included the word "fuzzy". When he died on 11 September 2017 at age 96, Professor Zadeh had received more than 50 engineering and academic awards, in recognition of his work.&lt;ref&gt;Cade Metz, "Lotfi Zadeh, Father of Mathematical ‘Fuzzy Logic,’ Dies at 96." ''New York Times'', 11 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lattices and big data sets==
The technique of fuzzy concept lattices is increasingly used in programming for the formatting, relating and analysis of fuzzy data sets.

===Concept formalization===
According to the computer scientist Andrei Popescu at [[Middlesex University London]],&lt;ref&gt;Andrei Popescu, "A general approach to fuzzy concepts". ''Mathematical Logic Quarterly'' Vol. 50, No. 3, 2005, pp. 265–280.&lt;/ref&gt; a concept can be operationally defined to consist of: 
*an ''intent'', which is a description or specification stated in a language, 
*an ''extent'', which is the collection of all the objects to which the description refers, 
*a ''context'', which is stated by: (i) the universe of all possible objects, (ii) the universe of all possible attributes of objects, and (iii) the logical definition of the relation whereby an object possesses an attribute. 

Once the context is defined, we can specify relationships of sets of objects with sets of attributes which they do, or do not share.

===Fuzzy concept lattice===
Whether an object belongs to a concept, and whether an object does, or does not have an attribute, can often be a matter of degree. Thus, for example, "many attributes are fuzzy rather than crisp".&lt;ref&gt;Radim Bělohlávek and Vilem Vychodil, "What is a fuzzy concept lattice?" Department of Computer Science, Palacky University, Olomouc, 2005.[http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-162/paper2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; To overcome this issue, a numerical value is assigned to each attribute along a scale, and the results are placed in a table which links each assigned object-value within the given range to a numerical value denoting a given degree of applicability.

This is the basic idea of a "fuzzy concept lattice", which can also be graphed; different fuzzy concept lattices can be connected to each other as well (for example, in "[[fuzzy clustering|fuzzy conceptual clustering]]" techniques used to group data, originally invented by [http://dblp2.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/r/Ruspini:Enrique_H= Enrique H. Ruspini]). Fuzzy concept lattices are a useful programming tool for the exploratory analysis of [[big data]], for example in cases where sets of linked behavioural responses are broadly similar, but can nevertheless vary in important ways, within certain limits. It can help to find out what the structure and dimensions are, of a behaviour that occurs with an important but limited amount of variation in a large population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compasss.org/index.htm See further the COMPASSS site]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Big data===
Coding with fuzzy lattices can be useful, for instance, in the [[psephological]] analysis of [[big data]] about voter behaviour, where researchers want to explore the characteristics and associations involved in "somewhat vague" opinions; gradations in voter attitudes; and variability in voter behaviour (or personal characteristics) within a set of parameters.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Kreiss, ''Prototype Politics: Technology-Intensive Campaigning and the Data of Democracy''. Oxford University Press, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The basic programming techniques for this kind of fuzzy [[concept mapping]] and [[deep learning]] are by now well-established&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Mikael Collan, Mario Fedrizzi, [[Janusz Kacprzyk]], ''Fuzzy Technology: Present Applications and Future Challenges''. Heidelberg: Springer, 2016, p. 65f.; Daniel J. Lewis and Trevor P. Martin, "Managing Vagueness with Fuzzy in Hierarchical Big Data". ''Procedia Computer Science'', Volume 53, 2015, pages 19–28.[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915017780]&lt;/ref&gt; and big data analytics had a strong influence on the US elections of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Preimesberger, "Big-Data Analytics Plays Big Role in 2016 Election Campaigns". ''eWeek'', 24 September 2016.

[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/google-and-facebook-could-help-decide-2017-german-election-a-1120156.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Very large quantities of data can now be explored using computers with fuzzy logic programming&lt;ref&gt;For example, Kyle C. Longest and Stephen Vaisey, "Fuzzy: A program for Performing Qualitative Comparative Analyses (QCA) in Stata." ''Stata Journal'', Vol. 8 No. 1, 2008: pp. 79–104. Gregory Viot, "Fuzzy logic in C". ''Dr Dobb's journal'', 1 February 1993.[http://www.drdobbs.com/cpp/fuzzy-logic-in-c/184408940]&lt;/ref&gt; and open-source architectures such as [[Apache Hadoop]], [[Apache Spark]], and [[MongoDB]]. One author claimed in 2016 that it is now possible to obtain, link and analyze "400 data points" for each voter in a population, using [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] systems (a "data point" is a number linked to one or more categories, which represents a characteristic).&lt;ref&gt;Chris Preimesberger, "Big-Data Analytics Plays Big Role in 2016 Election Campaigns". ''eWeek'', 24 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[NBC News]] reported in 2016 that the Anglo-American firm [[Cambridge Analytica]] which profiled voters for [[Donald Trump]] ([[Steve Bannon]] was a board member)&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth P. Vogel, "The heiress quietly shaping Trump’s operation." ''Politico.com'', 21 November 2016.[http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/rebekah-mercer-donald-trump-231693]&lt;/ref&gt; did not have 400, but 4,000 data points for each of 230 million US adults.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Brannely, "Trump Campaign Pays Millions to Overseas Big Data Firm." NBC News, 4 November 2016.[http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/2016-election-day/trump-campaign-pays-millions-overseas-big-data-firm-n677321]&lt;/ref&gt; Cambridge Analytica's own website claimed that "up to 5,000 data points" were collected for each of 220 million Americans, a data set of more than 1 trillion bits of formatted data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Cambridge Analytica]] website |url=https://cambridgeanalytica.org/about |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216023554/https://cambridgeanalytica.org/about |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2016-02-16 |title=Cambridge Analytica – About Us}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' later claimed that Cambridge Analytica in fact had, according to its own company information, "up to 7,000 data points" on 240 million American voters.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Cadwalladr, "UK regulator orders Cambridge Analytica to release data on US voter". ''The Guardian'', 5 May 2018.[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/05/cambridge-analytica-uk-regulator-release-data-us-voter-david-carroll]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harvard University]] Professor [[Latanya Sweeney]] calculated, that if a U.S. company knows just your [[date of birth]], your [[ZIP code]] and [[sex]], the company has an 87% chance to identify you by name – simply by using linked data sets from various sources.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Tanner, "Nine Things You Don't Know About The Gathering Of Your Personal Data." ''Forbes Magazine'', 4 November 2014.[https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamtanner/2014/11/04/nine-things-you-dont-know-about-the-gathering-of-your-personal-data/#3faf581675b7]&lt;/ref&gt; With 4,000–7,000 data points instead of three, a very comprehensive personal profile becomes possible for almost every voter, and many behavioural patterns can be inferred by linking together different data sets. It also becomes possible to identify and measure gradations in personal characteristics which, in aggregate, have very large effects.

===Human judgement===
Some researchers argue that this kind of big data analysis has severe limitations, and that the analytical results can only be regarded as indicative, and not as definitive.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Lohr and Natasha Singernov, "How Data Failed Us in Calling an Election." ''[[New York Times]]'', 10 November 2016 [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/the-data-said-clinton-would-win-why-you-shouldnt-have-believed-it.html]&lt;/ref&gt; This was confirmed by [[Kellyanne Conway]], [[Donald Trump]]’s campaign advisor and counselor, who emphasized the importance of human judgement and common sense in drawing conclusions from fuzzy data.&lt;ref&gt;"How Trump won the presidency". Interview of Gerald F. Seib with [[Kellyanne Conway]], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' (WSJ CEO Council full interview video), 14 November 2016.[https://www.wsj.com/video/how-trump-won-the-presidency/969FC367-31B3-436F-8388-6C9CE7546AC7.html] See also: Jonathan Vanian, "How Bad Polling Data Fooled Everyone Except Donald Trump". ''Fortune'', 10 November 2016.[http://fortune.com/2016/11/10/donald-trump-data-analytics/]&lt;/ref&gt; Conway candidly admitted that much of her own research would "never see the light of day", because it was client confidential.&lt;ref&gt;"How Trump won the presidency". Interview of Gerald F. Seib with Kellyanne Conway, Wall Street Journal (WSJ CEO Council full interview video), 14 November 2016.[https://www.wsj.com/video/how-trump-won-the-presidency/969FC367-31B3-436F-8388-6C9CE7546AC7.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Another Trump adviser criticized Conway, claiming that she "produces an analysis that buries every terrible number and highlights every positive number"&lt;ref&gt;Ryan Lizza, "Kellyanne Conway’s political machinations", ''The New Yorker'', 17 October 2016.[http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/17/kellyanne-conways-political-machinations](see also [[alternative facts]])&lt;/ref&gt;
====Propaganda machine====
In a video interview published by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in March 2018, whistleblower [[Christopher Wylie]] called [[Cambridge Analytica]] a "full-service propaganda machine" rather than a bona fide data science company. Its own site revealed with "case studies" that it has been active in political campaigns in numerous different countries, influencing attitudes and opinions.&lt;ref&gt;Jina Moore, "Cambridge Analytica Had a Role in Kenya Election, Too". ''New York Times'', 20 March 2018.[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/world/africa/kenya-cambridge-analytica-election.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Wylie explained, that "we spent a million dollars harvesting tens of millions of [[Facebook]] profiles, and those profiles were used as the basis of the algorithms that became the foundation of Cambridge Analytica itself. The company itself was founded on using Facebook data".&lt;ref&gt;Carole Cadwalladr &amp; Emma Graham-Harrison, "Pressure mounts on Cambridge Analytica and Facebook over data scandal." ''[[The Guardian]]'', 18 March 2018.[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/18/cambridge-analytica-and-facebook-accused-of-misleading-mps-over-data-breach]&lt;/ref&gt; 
====Audit====
On 19 March 2018, [[Facebook]] announced it had hired the digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg to conduct a "comprehensive audit" of Cambridge Analytica, while Facebook shares plummeted 7 percent overnight (erasing roughly $40 billion in market capitalization).&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Shieber, "Facebook hired a forensics firm to investigate [[Cambridge Analytica]] as stock falls 7%." ''TC Techcrunch.com'', 19 March 2018.[https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/19/facebook-hired-a-forensics-firm-to-investigate-cambridge-analytica-as-stock-falls-7/]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cambridge Analytica]] had not just used the profiles of [[Facebook]] users to compile data sets. According to [[Christopher Wylie]]'s testimony, the company also harvested the data of each user's network of friends, leveraging the original data set. It then converted, combined and migrated its results into ''new'' data sets, which can in principle survive in some format, even if the original data sources are destroyed. It created and applied algorithms using data to which - critics argue - it could not have been entitled. This was denied by [[Cambridge Analytica]], which stated on its website that it legitimately "uses data to change audience behavior" among customers and voters (who ''choose'' to view and provide information). If advertisers can do that, why not a data company? Where should the line be drawn? Legally, it remained a "fuzzy" area.
====Legal issue====
The tricky legal issue then became, what kind of data [[Cambridge Analytica]] (or any similar company) is actually allowed to have and keep.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer Phade, "Who Should Profit From Selling Your Personal Data?". ''Futures Platform'', 27 March 2018.[https://www.futuresplatform.com/blog/your-data-and-profit-data-scraping]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Facebook]] itself became the subject of another [[U.S. Federal Trade Commission]] inquiry, to establish whether Facebook violated the terms of a 2011 consent decree governing its handing of user data (data which was allegedly transferred to Cambridge Analytica without Facebook's and user's knowledge).&lt;ref&gt;David McLaughlin, Ben Brody, and Billy House, "FTC Probing Facebook for Use of Personal Data, Source Says." ''Bloomberg'', 20 March 2018; Tony Romm and Craig Timberg, "FTC opens investigation into Facebook after Cambridge Analytica scrapes millions of users’ personal information." ''Washington Post'', 20 March 2018.[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/03/20/ftc-opens-investigation-into-facebook-after-cambridge-analytica-scrapes-millions-of-users-personal-information/]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' journalist Jessi Hempel commented in a CBNC panel discussion that "Now there is this fuzziness from the top of the company [i.e. Facebook] that I have never seen in the fifteen years that I have covered it."&lt;ref&gt;Sara Salinas, "Facebook hires firm to conduct a 'comprehensive audit' of Cambridge Analytica". ''CNBC news'', 19 March 2018 and squawkbox panel video [https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/19/facebook-to-conduct-a-comprehensive-audit-of-cambridge-analytica.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Data privacy====
Interrogating Facebook's CEO [[Mark Zuckerberg]] before the U.S. [[House Energy and Commerce Committee]] in April 2018, New Mexico Congressman Rep. [[Ben Ray Luján]] put it to him that the Facebook corporation might well have "29,000 data points" on each Facebook user. Zuckerberg claimed that he "did not really know". Lujan's figure was based on [[ProPublica]] research, which in fact suggested that Facebook may even have 52,000 data points for many Facebook users.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Carbone, "Facebook might have 29,000 data points on you, but Mark Zuckerberg doesn't really know." ''Fox News'', 11 April 2018.[http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2018/04/11/facebook-might-have-29000-data-points-on-but-mark-zuckerberg-doesnt-really-know.html] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA1S5A4Yuxc] Julia Angwin, Surya Mattu and Terry Parris Jr., "Facebook Doesn’t Tell Users Everything It Really Knows About Them." ''ProPublica'', 27 December 2016.[https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-doesnt-tell-users-everything-it-really-knows-about-them]&lt;/ref&gt; When Zuckerberg replied to his critics, he stated that because the revolutionary technology of Facebook (with 2.2 billion users worldwide) had ventured into previously unknown territory, it was unavoidable that mistakes would be made, despite the best of intentions. He justified himself saying that:

{{Quotation|"For the first ten or twelve years of the company, I viewed our responsibility primarily as building tools, that if we could put those tools in people's hands, then that would empower people to do good things. What we have learnt now... is that we need to take a more proactive role and a broader view of our responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;Zuckerberg's Senate hearings highlights video, 10 April 2018.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgI_KAkSyCw]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In July 2018, [[Facebook]] and [[Instagram]] barred access from [[Crimson Hexagon]], a company that advises corporations and governments using one trillion scraped social media posts, which it mined and processed with artificial intelligence and image analysis.&lt;ref&gt; Olivia Solon and Julia Carrie Wong, "Facebook suspends another analytics firm amid questions over surveillance." ''The Guardian'', 20 July 2018.[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/20/facebook-crimson-hexagon-analytics-data-surveillance]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Integrity====
It remained "fuzzy" what was more important to Zuckerberg: making money from user's information, or real corporate integrity in the use of personal information. Zuckerberg implied, that he believed that, on balance, Facebook had done ''more good than harm'', and that, if he had believed that wasn't the case, he would never have persevered with the business. Thus, "the good" was itself a fuzzy concept, because it was a matter of degree ("more good than bad"). He had to sell stuff, to keep the business growing. If people did not like Facebook, then they simply should not join it, or opt out, they have the choice.

After the ''[[New York Times]]'' broke the news on 17 March 2018, that copies of the Facebook data set scraped by Cambridge Analytica could still be downloaded from the Internet, Facebook was severely criticized by government representatives.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Rosenberg, Nicholas Confessore and Carole Cadwalladr, "How [[Donald Trump|Trump]] Consultants Exploited the Facebook Data of Millions". ''[[New York Times]]'', 17 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; When questioned, Zuckerberg admitted that "In general we collect data on people who are not signed up for Facebook for security purposes" with the aim "to help prevent malicious actors from collecting public information from Facebook users, such as names". &lt;ref&gt;Sarah Frier and Todd Shields, "Zuckerberg Says Facebook Collects Internet Data on Non-Users", ''Bloomberg'', 11 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 May 2018, it was reported that the [[Cambridge Analytica]] company was shutting down and was starting bankruptcy proceedings, after losing clients and facing escalating legal costs.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Ballhaus and Jenny Gross, "Cambridge Analytica Closing Operations Following Facebook Data Controversy". ''Wall Street Journal'', 2 May 2018; Munsif Vengattil, "Cambridge Analytica and parent SCL Elections shutting down." ''Reuters'', 2 May 2018.[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-faceboook-privacy/cambridge-analytica-and-parent-scl-elections-shutting-down-idUSKBN1I32L7]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[reputational risk|reputational damage]] which the company had suffered or caused, had become too great.

===Speed===
A traditional objection to big data is, that it cannot cope with rapid change: events move faster that the statistics can keep up with. Yet the technology now exists for corporations like [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[Google]] and [[Microsoft]] to pump cloud-based data streams from app-users straight into big data analytics programmes, in real time.&lt;ref&gt;Tableau.com, ''Big data: the top 8 trends for 2016''.&lt;/ref&gt; Provided that the right kinds of analytical concepts are used, it is now technically possible to draw definite and important conclusions about gradations of human and natural behaviour using very large fuzzy data sets – and increasingly it can be done very fast. Obviously this achievement has become highly topical in military technology, but military uses can also have spin-offs for medical applications.&lt;ref&gt;Michael O'Hagan, "From military to medical and commercial applications of neural networks and fuzzy logic: a modern "swords-into-plowshares" play." ''Proceedings of IEEE WESCON '93'' conference, San Francisco, 28-30 Sept. 1993. Republished in ''EEE Xplore'', 6 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
There have been many academic controversies about the meaning, relevance and utility of fuzzy concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Radim Bělohlávek, George J. Klir, Harold W. Lewis III, Eileen C. Way, "Concepts and fuzzy sets: Misunderstandings, misconceptions, and oversights". ''International Journal of Approximate Reasoning'', Vol. 51, July 2009), pp. 23–34.[http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0888613X09001327/1-s2.0-S0888613X09001327-main.pdf?_tid=7f4bada4-37bd-11e7-9bfe-00000aacb361&amp;acdnat=1494667448_9f6a0acd8f43577a7af214d56512b12a] Angel Garrido &amp; Piedad Yuste, "controversies about the introduction of non-classical logics". ''Brain'', Vol. 5, No. 1-4, 2014.[http://www.edusoft.ro/brain/index.php/brain/article/view/457]&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Fuzzy" label===
[[Lotfi A. Zadeh]] himself confessed that:

{{Quotation|"I knew that just by choosing the label ''fuzzy'' I was going to find myself in the midst of a controversy... If it weren't called ''fuzzy logic'', there probably wouldn't be articles on it on the front page of the ''New York Times''. So let us say it has a certain publicity value. Of course, many people don't like that publicity value, and when they see it in the ''New York Times'', it doesn't sit well with them."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel McNeill &amp; Paul Freiberger, ''Fuzzy Logic: The Revolutionary Computer Technology that Is Changing Our World.'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1994, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

However, the impact of the invention of fuzzy reasoning went far beyond names and labels. When Zadeh gave his acceptance speech in Japan for the 1989 Honda Foundation prize, which he received for inventing fuzzy theory, he stated that "The concept of a fuzzy set has had an upsetting effect on the established order."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel McNeill &amp; Paul Freiberger, ''Fuzzy Logic: The Revolutionary Computer Technology that Is Changing Our World.'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1994, p. 50. The Honda Foundation judged that Zadeh had taken an "active role in making the future of information society a more humane civilization", with a broad range of contributions in applied logic.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Do they exist===

Some philosophers and scientists have claimed that in reality "fuzzy" concepts do not exist.

====Frege====
According to ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'' by the logician [[Gottlob Frege]],

{{Quotation|"A definition of a concept... must be complete; it must unambiguously determine, as regards any object, whether or not it falls under the concept... the concept must have a sharp boundary... a concept that is not sharply defined is wrongly termed a concept. Such quasi-conceptual constructions cannot be recognized as concepts by logic. The [[Law of excluded middle|law of the excluded middle]] is really just another form of the requirement that the concept should have a sharp boundary."&lt;ref&gt;P. Geach and M. Black (eds.), ''Translations from the Philosophical Writings of Gottlob Frege'', 3rd edition. Blackwell, 1980, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

====Kálmán====
Similarly, [[Rudolf E. Kálmán]] stated in 1972 that "there is no such thing as a fuzzy concept... We do talk about fuzzy things but they are not scientific concepts".&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "Is there a need for fuzzy logic?", ''Information Sciences'', No. 178, 2008, p. 2753.&lt;/ref&gt;

The suggestion is that a concept, to qualify as a concept, must always be clear ''and'' precise, without any fuzziness. A vague notion would be at best a prologue to formulating a concept.&lt;ref&gt;For the debate between Zadeh and Kálmán, see: Lotfi A. Zadeh, "The birth and evolution of fuzzy logic". ''International Journal of General Systems'', Vol. 17, No. 2-3, 1990, pp. 95-105. See also: Yücel Yüksel, "On Zadeh’s 'The Birth and Evolution of Fuzzy Logic'". In: Eyke Hüllermeier, Rudolf Kruse &amp; Frank Hoffmann (eds.), ''Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems. Applications''. Proceedings of the 13th International Conference, IPMU 2010, Dortmund, Germany, June 28–July 2, 2010 (Communications in Computer and Information Science, vol 81), Part II. Berlin: Springer, 2010,  pp 350-355. &lt;/ref&gt;

====DIN and ISO standards====
There is no general agreement among philosophers and scientists about how the notion of a "[[concept]]" (and in particular, a scientific concept), should be defined.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang G. Stock, "Concepts and Semantic Relations in Information Science". In: ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology'' Vol. 61 No. 10, October 2010, pp. 1951–1969.[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220433962_Concepts_and_Semantic_Relations_in_Information_Science]; Eric Margolis &amp; Stephen Laurence, "Concepts". In: ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', 2011.[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concepts/#ProThe]&lt;/ref&gt; A concept could be defined as a mental representation, as a cognitive capacity, as an abstract object, etc. Edward E. Smith &amp; Douglas L. Medin stated that “there will likely be no crucial experiments or analyses that will establish one view of concepts as correct and rule out all others irrevocably.”&lt;ref&gt;Edward E. Smith &amp; Douglas L. Medin, ''Categories and concepts''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1981, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, scientists also quite often do use imprecise analogies in their models to help understanding an issue.&lt;ref&gt;Pawel Zeidler, ''Models and Metaphors as Research Tools in Science''. Zurich: Lit Verlag, 2013; L. Magnani, N. J. Nersessian &amp; P. Thagard (eds.), Model-based reasoning in scientific discovery. New York : Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, 1999; Jonathan Lawry, ''Modelling and reasoning with vague concepts''. New York: Springer, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; A concept can be clear enough, ''but not'' (or not sufficiently) precise.

Rather uniquely, terminology scientists at the German national standards institute (''Deutsches Institut für Normung'') provided an official standard definition of what a concept is (under the terminology standards DIN 2330 of 1957, completely revised in 1974 and last revised in 2013; and DIN 2342 of 1986, last revised in 2011).&lt;ref&gt;Go to [https://standards.globalspec.com/ Standards Library] for info.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the official German definition, a concept is a unit of thought which is created through abstraction for a set of objects, and which identifies shared (or related) characteristics of those objects.

The subsequent ISO definition is very similar. Under the ISO 1087 terminology standard of the [[International Standards Organization]] (first published in October 2000, and reviewed in 2005), a concept is defined as a unit of thought or an idea constituted through abstraction on the basis of properties common to a set of objects.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [https://www.iso.org/standard/20057.html] [https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:1087:-1:ed-1:v1:en] [http://wiki.julien-roche.fr/tiki-index.php?page=concept+3.2.1+version2+%28en%29&amp;structure=vocabulary]&lt;/ref&gt; It is acknowledged that although a concept usually has one definition or one meaning, it may have multiple designations, terms of expression, symbolizations or representations. Thus, for example, the same concept can have different names in different languages. Both verbs and nouns can express concepts. A concept can also be thought of as "a way of looking at the world".

===Corruption===
Reasoning with fuzzy concepts is often viewed as a kind of "logical corruption" or scientific perversion because, it is claimed, fuzzy reasoning rarely reaches a definite "yes" or a definite "no". A clear, precise and logically rigorous conceptualization is no longer a necessary prerequisite, for carrying out a procedure, a project, or an inquiry, since "somewhat vague ideas" can always be accommodated, formalized and programmed with the aid of fuzzy expressions. The purist idea is, that either a rule applies, or it does not apply. When a rule is said to apply only "to some extent", then in truth the rule does ''not'' apply. Thus, a compromise with vagueness or indefiniteness is, on this view, effectively a compromise with error - an error of conceptualization, an error in the inferential system, or an error in physically carrying out a task.
====Kahan====
The computer scientist [[William Kahan]] argued in 1975 that "the danger of fuzzy theory is that it will encourage the sort of imprecise thinking that has brought us so much trouble."&lt;ref&gt;Lotfi A. Zadeh, "The birth and evolution of fuzzy logic". ''International Journal of General Systems'', Vol. 17, No. 2-3, 1990, pp. 95-105, at p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; He said subsequently,

{{Quotation|"With traditional logic there is no guaranteed way to find that something is contradictory, but once it is found, you'd be obliged to do something. But with fuzzy sets, the existence of contradictory sets can't cause things to malfunction. Contradictory information doesn't lead to a clash. You just keep computing. (...) Life affords many instances of getting the right answer for the wrong reasons... It is in the nature of logic to confirm or deny. The fuzzy calculus blurs that. (...) Logic isn't following the rules of Aristotle blindly. It takes the kind of pain known to the runner. He knows he is doing something. When you are thinking about something hard, you'll feel a similar sort of pain. Fuzzy logic is marvellous. It insulates you from pain. It's the [[cocaine]] of science."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel McNeill &amp; Paul Freiberger, ''Fuzzy Logic: The Revolutionary Computer Technology that Is Changing Our World.'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1994, pp. 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt; }}
According to Kahan, statements of a degree of probability are usually verifiable. There are standard tests one can do. By contrast, there is no conclusive procedure which can decide the validity of assigning particular fuzzy truth values to a data set in the first instance. It is just assumed that a model or program will work, "if" particular fuzzy values are accepted and used, perhaps based on some statistical comparisons or try-outs.

====Bad design====
In programming, a problem can usually be solved in several different ways, not just one way, but an important issue is, which solution works best in the short term, and in the long term. Kahan implies, that fuzzy solutions may create more problems in the long term, than they solve in the short term. For example, if one starts off designing a procedure, not with well thought-out, precise concepts, but rather by using fuzzy or approximate expressions which conveniently patch up (or compensate for) badly formulated ideas, the ultimate result could be a complicated, malformed mess, that does not achieve the intended goal.

Had the reasoning and conceptualization been much sharper at the start, then the design of the procedure might have been much simpler, more efficient and effective - and fuzzy expressions or approximations would not be necessary, or required much less. Thus, by ''allowing'' the use of fuzzy or approximate expressions, one might actually foreclose more rigorous thinking about design, and one might build something that ultimately does not meet expectations. 

If (say) an entity X turns out to belong for 65% to category Y, and for 35% to category Z, how should X be allocated? One could plausibly decide to allocate X to Y, making a rule that, if an entity belongs for 65% or more to Y, it is to be treated as an instance of category Y, and never as an instance of category Z. One could, however, alternatively decide to change the definitions of the categorization system, to ensure that all entities such as X fall 100% in one category only. 

This kind of argument claims, that boundary problems can be resolved (or vastly reduced) simply by using better categorization or conceptualization methods. If we treat X "as if" it belongs 100% to Y, while in truth it only belongs 65% to Y, then arguably we are really misrepresenting things. If we keep doing that with a lot of related variables, we can greatly distort the true situation, and make it look like something that it isn't.

In a "fuzzy permissive" environment, it might become far too easy, to formalize and use a concept which is itself badly defined, and which could have been defined much better. In that environment, there is always a quantitative way out, for concepts that do not quite fit, or which don't quite do the job for which they are intended. The cumulative adverse effect of the discrepancies might, in the end, be much larger than ever anticipated.

====Counter-argument====
A typical reply to Kahan's objections is, that fuzzy reasoning never "rules out" ordinary binary logic, but instead ''presupposes'' ordinary true-or-false logic. [[Lotfi Zadeh]] stated that "fuzzy logic is not fuzzy. In large measure, fuzzy logic is precise."&lt;ref&gt;A. Dumitras, &amp; G. Moschytz, "Understanding Fuzzy Logic: An Interview with Lotfi Zadeh". ''IEEE signal processing magazine'', May 2007, pp. 102-105, at p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a precise logic of imprecision. Fuzzy logic is not a replacement of, or substitute for ordinary logic, but an enhancement of it, with many practical uses. Fuzzy thinking does oblige action, but primarily in response to a change in quantitative gradation, not in response to a contradiction.

One could say, for example, that ultimately one is ''either'' "alive" ''or'' "dead", which is perfectly true. Meantime though one is "living", which is also a significant truth - yet "living" is a fuzzy concept. It is true that fuzzy logic by itself usually cannot eliminate inadequate conceptualization or bad design. Yet it can at least make explicit, what exactly the variations are in the applicability of a concept which has unsharp boundaries.

If one always had perfectly crisp concepts available, perhaps no fuzzy expressions would be necessary. In reality though, one often does not have all the crisp concepts to start off with. One might not have them yet for a long time, or ever - or, several successive "fuzzy" approximations might be needed, to get there. 

At a deeper level, a "fuzzy permissive" environment may be desirable, precisely because it permits things to be actioned, that would never have been achieved, if there had been crystal clarity about all the consequences from the start, or if people insisted on absolute precision prior to doing anything. Scientists often try things out on the basis of "hunches", and processes like [[serendipity]] can play a role. 

Learning something new, or trying to create something new, is rarely a completely formal-logical or linear process, there are not only "knowns" and "unknowns" involved, but also "''partly'' known" phenomena, i.e. things which are known or unknown "to some degree". Even if, ideally, we would prefer to eliminate fuzzy ideas, we might need them initially to get there, further down the track. Any method of reasoning is a tool. If its application has bad results, it is not the tool itself that is to blame, but its inappropriate use. It would be better to educate people in the best ''use'' of the tool, if necessary with appropriate authorization, than to ''ban'' the tool pre-emptively, on the ground that it "could" or "might" be abused. Exceptions to this rule would include things like computer viruses and illegal weapons that can only cause great harm if they are used. There is no evidence though that fuzzy concepts as a species are intrinsically harmful, even if some bad concepts can cause harm if used in inappropriate contexts.

===Reducibility===

[[Susan Haack]] once claimed that a many-valued logic requires neither intermediate terms between true and false, nor a rejection of bivalence.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Haack, Philosophy of Logics. Cambridge University Press, 1978, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Her suggestion was, that the intermediate terms (i.e. the gradations of truth) can always be restated as conditional if-then statements, and by implication, that fuzzy logic is fully reducible to binary true-or-false logic. 

This interpretation is disputed, but even if it was correct, assigning a number to the applicability of a statement is often enormously more efficient than a long string of if-then statements that would have the same intended meaning. That point is obviously of great importance to computer programmers, educators and administrators seeking to code a process, activity, message or operation as simply as possible, according to logically consistent rules.

===Quantification===
It may be wonderful to have access to an unlimited number of distinctions to define what one means, but not all scholars would agree that any concept is equal to, or reducible to, a mathematical [[Set theory|set]].&lt;ref&gt;Susan L. Epstein, "Memory and concepts in reactive learning". ''Proceedings of the Canadian Workshop on Machine Learning 1992''[http://www.cs.hunter.cuny.edu/~epstein/papers/CSCSI92.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; Some phenomena are difficult or impossible to quantify and count, in particular if they lack discrete boundaries (for example, clouds).

====Formalization====
Qualities may not be fully reducible to quantities&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Mumford, "Quantities and Qualities", University of Nottingham blog post, September 30, 2012.[https://blogs.nottingham.ac.uk/artsmatters/2012/09/30/quantities-and-qualities/]&lt;/ref&gt; – if there are no qualities, it may become impossible to say what the numbers are numbers of, or what they refer to, except that they refer to other numbers or numerical expressions such as algebraic equations. A measure requires a counting unit defined by a category, but the definition of that category is essentially qualitative; a language which is used to communicate data is difficult to operate, without any qualitative distinctions and categories. We may, for example, transmit a text in binary code, but the binary code does not tell us directly what the text intends.

In creating a [[formal system|formalization]] or [[formal specification]] of a concept, for example for the purpose of measurement, administrative procedure or programming, part of the meaning of the concept may be changed or lost.&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Wachter, "How Measurement Fails Doctors and Teachers". ''New York Times'', 16 January 2016.[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/17/opinion/sunday/how-measurement-fails-doctors-and-teachers.html?_r=0]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if we deliberately program an event according to a concept, it might kill off the spontaneity, spirit, authenticity and motivational pattern which is ordinarily associated with that type of event.

[[Quantification (science)|Quantification]] is not an unproblematic process.&lt;ref&gt;“A well-known quotation usually attributed to Einstein is “Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.” I’d amend it to a less eloquent, more prosaic statement: unless we know how things are counted, we don’t know if it’s wise to count on the numbers. The problem isn’t with statistical tests themselves but with what we do before and after we run them. First, we count if we can, but counting depends a great deal on previous assumptions about categorization. (...) Second, after we’ve gathered some numbers relating to a phenomenon, we must reasonably aggregate them into some sort of recommendation or ranking. This is not easy. By appropriate choices of criteria, measurement protocols and weights, almost any desired outcome can be reached." - John Allen Paulos, "Metric Mania", in ''New York Times'', 10 May 2010.[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/16/magazine/16FOB-WWLN-t.html] Whether Einstein really did originate the quotation which Paulos mentions, is in dispute. The quote is also credited to William Bruce Cameron, ''Informal Sociology, a casual introduction to sociological thinking''. New York: Random House, 1963, p. 13.[http://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/05/26/everything-counts-einstein/]&lt;/ref&gt; To quantify a phenomenon, we may have to introduce special assumptions and definitions which disregard part of the phenomenon in its totality. 
*The economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] concluded that formalization "runs the risk of leaving behind the subjectmatter we are interested in" and "also runs the risk of increasing rather than decreasing the muddle."&lt;ref&gt;J.

Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2009, pp. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Measurement====
Programmers, statisticians or logicians are concerned in their work with the main operational or technical significance of a concept which is specifiable in objective, quantifiable terms. They are not primarily concerned with all kinds of imaginative frameworks associated with the concept, or with those aspects of the concept which seem to have no particular functional purpose – however entertaining they might be. However, some of the qualitative characteristics of the concept may not be quantifiable or measurable at all, at least not directly. The temptation exists to ignore them, or try to infer them from data results.

If, for example, we want to count the number of trees in a forest area with any precision, we have to define what counts as one tree, and perhaps distinguish them from saplings, split trees, dead trees, fallen trees etc. Soon enough it becomes apparent that the quantification of trees involves a degree of abstraction – we decide to disregard some timber, dead or alive, from the population of trees, in order to count those trees that conform to our chosen concept of a tree. We operate in fact with an abstract concept of what a tree is, which diverges to some extent from the true diversity of trees there are. 

Even so, there may be some trees, of which it is not very clear, whether they should be counted as a tree, or not; a certain amount of "fuzziness" in the concept of a tree may therefore remain. The implication is, that the seemingly "exact" number offered for the total quantity of trees in the forest may be much less exact than one might think - it is probably more an estimate or indication of magnitude, rather than an exact description.&lt;ref&gt;What statisticians then often try to do, is to create a model which can predict the magnitude of the difference between the true (accurate and exact) number and the computed number obtained, in this case the true number of trees. Such a model however still relies on imperfect or fallible definitions. Even if fuzzy values are used instead, it is likely that a definite and exact number can never be reached. At most one can say that the number is correct, if the definitions are accepted.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet - and this is the point - the imprecise measure can be very useful and sufficient for all intended purposes.

It is tempting to think, that if something can be measured, it must exist, and that if we cannot measure it, it does not exist. Neither might be true. Researchers try to measure such things as intelligence or gross domestic product, without much scientific agreement about what these things actually are, how they exist, and what the correct measures might be.

When one wants to count and quantify distinct objects using numbers, one needs to be able to distinguish between those separate objects, but if this is difficult or impossible, then, although this may not invalidate a quantitative procedure as such, quantification is not really possible in practice; at best, we may be able to assume or infer indirectly a certain distribution of quantities that must be there. In this sense, scientists often use [[Proxy (statistics)|proxy variables]] to substitute as measures for variables which are known (or thought) to be there, but which themselves cannot be observed or measured directly.

===Vague or fuzzy===
The exact relationship between vagueness and fuzziness is disputed.

====Philosophy====
Philosophers often regard fuzziness as a particular kind of vagueness,&lt;ref&gt;Susan Haack, ''Deviant logic, fuzzy logic - beyond the formalism.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and consider that "no specific assignment of semantic values to vague predicates, not even a fuzzy one, can fully satisfy our conception of what the extensions of vague predicates are like".&lt;ref&gt;Matti Eklund, "Vagueness and Second-Level Indeterminacy", in: Richard Dietz &amp; Sebastiano Moruzzi (eds.), ''Cuts and clouds. Vagueness, Its Nature, and Its Logic.'' Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Surveying recent literature on how to characterize vagueness, Matti Eklund states that appeal to lack of sharp boundaries, borderline cases and “sorites-susceptible" predicates are the three informal characterizations of vagueness which are most common in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Matti Eklund, "Characterizing Vagueness". ''Philosophy Compass'', 2, 2007, pp. 896-909.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Zadeh's argument====
However, [[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] claimed that "vagueness connotes insufficient [[specificity (statistics)|specificity]], whereas fuzziness connotes unsharpness of [[Class (set theory)|class boundaries]]". Thus, he argued, a sentence like "I will be back in a few minutes" is fuzzy ''but not'' vague, whereas a sentence such as "I will be back sometime", is fuzzy ''and'' vague. His suggestion was that fuzziness and vagueness are logically quite different qualities, rather than fuzziness being a type or subcategory of vagueness. Zadeh claimed that "inappropriate use of the term 'vague' is still a common practice in the literature of philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "What is fuzzy logic?". ''IFSA Newsletter'' (International Fuzzy Systems Association), Vol. 10, No. 1, March 2013, pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===

In the scholarly inquiry about [[ethics]] and [[meta-ethics]], vague or fuzzy concepts and borderline cases are standard topics of controversy. Central to ethics are theories of "value", what is "good" or "bad" for people and why that is, and the idea of "rule following" as a condition for moral integrity, consistency and non-arbitrary behaviour. 

Yet, if human valuations or moral rules are only vague or fuzzy, then they may not be able to orient or guide behaviour. It may become impossible to operationalize rules. Evaluations may not permit definite moral judgements, in that case. Hence, clarifying fuzzy moral notions is usually considered to be critical for the ethical endeavour as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Dougherty, "Vague value", in: ''Philosophy and phenomenological research'', Vol. 89, No. 2, September 2014, pp. 352–372 [https://philpapers.org/archive/DOUVV.pdf]; Tom Dougherty, "Vagueness and Indeterminacy in Ethics". In: Tristram McPherson &amp; David Plunkett, ''The Routledge Handbook of Metaethics''. Oxford: Routledge, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Excessive precision====
Nevertheless, [[Scott Soames]] has made the case that vagueness or fuzziness can be ''valuable'' to rule-makers, because "their use of it is valuable to the people to whom rules are addressed".&lt;ref&gt;Scott Soames, "The Value of Vagueness." Chapter 2 in: Andrei Marmor &amp; Scott Soames, ''Philosophical Foundations of Language in the Law''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013, pp. 26-43, at p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be more practical and effective to allow for some leeway (and personal responsibility) in the interpretation of how a rule should be applied - bearing in mind the overall purpose which the rule intends to achieve. 

If a rule or procedure is stipulated too exactly, it can sometimes have a result which is contrary to the aim which it was intended to help achieve. For example, "The [[Children and Young Persons Act 2008|Children and Young Persons Act]] could have specified a precise age below which a child may not be left unsupervised. But doing so would have incurred quite substantial forms of arbitrariness (for various reasons, and particularly because of the different capacities of children of the same age)".&lt;ref&gt;Scott Soames, "The Value of Vagueness." Chapter 2 in: Andrei Marmor &amp; Scott Soames, ''Philosophical Foundations of Language in the Law''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013, pp. 26-43, at p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rule conflict====
A related sort of problem is, that if the application of a legal concept is pursued too exactly and rigorously, it may have consequences that cause a serious conflict with ''another'' legal concept. This is not necessarily a matter of bad law-making. When a law is made, it may not be possible to anticipate all the cases and events to which it will apply later (even if 95% of possible cases are predictable). The longer a law is in force, the more likely it is, that people will run into problems with it, that were not foreseen when the law was made. 

So, the further implications of one rule may conflict with another rule. "Common sense" might not be able to resolve things. In that scenario, too much precision can get in the way of justice. Very likely a special court ruling wil have to set a norm. The general problem for jurists is, whether "the arbitrariness resulting from precision is worse than the arbitrariness resulting from the application of a vague standard".&lt;ref&gt;Scott Soames, "The Value of Vagueness." Chapter 2 in: Andrei Marmor &amp; Scott Soames, ''Philosophical Foundations of Language in the Law''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013, pp. 26-43, at p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mathematics===
The definitional disputes about fuzziness remain unresolved so far, mainly because, as anthropologists and psychologists have documented, different languages (or symbol systems) that have been created by people to signal meanings suggest different [[ontology|ontologies]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Korzybski]], ''Science and Sanity: An Introduction to Non-Aristotelian Systems and General Semantics'' (5th ed.). Forest Hills, N.Y.: Institute of General Semantics, 1995. [[Gregory Bateson]], ''Steps to an Ecology of Mind: Collected Essays in Anthropology, Psychiatry, Evolution, and Epistemology''. Chicago: University Of Chicago Press, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Put simply: it is not merely that describing "what is there" involves symbolic representations of some kind. How distinctions are drawn, influences perceptions of "what is there", and vice versa, perceptions of "what is there" influence how distinctions are drawn.&lt;ref&gt;Vassos Argyrou, "Anthropology of Magic". In: James D. Wright (ed.), ''International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioural Sciences''. Amsterdam: Elsevier, 2015, 2nd edition, Vol. 14, p. 438. Dominic Hyde, ''Vagueness, Logic and Ontology''. Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing Ltd, 2008. See also [[object-oriented ontology]].&lt;/ref&gt; This is an important reason why, as [[Alfred Korzybski]] noted, people frequently confuse the symbolic representation of reality, conveyed by languages and signs, with reality itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Korzybski]], ''Science and Sanity: An Introduction to Non-Aristotelian Systems and General Semantics'' (5th ed.). Forest Hills, N.Y.: Institute of General Semantics, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuzziness implies, that there exists a potentially ''infinite'' number of truth values between complete truth and complete falsehood. If that is the case, it creates the foundational issue of what, in the case, can justify or prove the existence of the categorical absolutes which are assumed by logical or quantitative inference. If there is an infinite number of shades of grey, how do we know what is totally black and white, and how could we identify that?
====Tegmark====
To illustrate the ontological issues, cosmologist [[Max Tegmark]] argues boldly that the universe consists of math: "If you accept the idea that both space itself, and all the stuff in space, have no properties at all except mathematical properties," then the idea that everything is mathematical "starts to sound a little bit less insane."&lt;ref&gt;Tanya Lewis, "What's the Universe Made Of? Math, Says Scientist." ''Live Science'', 30 January 2014.[http://www.livescience.com/42839-the-universe-is-math.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tegmark moves from the ''[[Epistemology|epistemic]]'' claim that mathematics is the only known symbol system which can in principle express absolutely everything, to the ''[[Methodology|methodological]]'' claim that everything is reducible to mathematical relationships, and then to the ''[[Ontology|ontological]]'' claim, that ultimately everything that exists is mathematical (the [[mathematical universe hypothesis]]). The argument is then reversed, so that ''because'' everything is mathematical in reality, mathematics is ''necessarily'' the ultimate universal symbol system.

The main criticisms of Tegmark's approach are that (1) the steps in this argument do not necessarily follow, (2) no conclusive proof or test is possible for the claim that such an exhaustive mathematical expression or reduction is feasible, and (3) it may be that a complete reduction to mathematics cannot be accomplished, without at least partly altering, negating or deleting a non-mathematical significance of phenomena, experienced perhaps as [[qualia]].&lt;ref&gt;See also Raphael van Riel &amp; Robert Van Gulick, "Scientific reduction". In: ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', 2014.[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-reduction/]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Zalta====
In his [[meta-mathematics|meta-mathematical]] [[metaphysics]], [[Edward N. Zalta]] has claimed that for every set of properties of a concrete object, there ''always'' exists ''exactly'' one abstract object that encodes ''exactly'' that set of properties and no others - a foundational assumption or [[axiom]] for his [[ontology]] of abstract objects&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward N. Zalta]], ''Abstract Objects. An introduction to axiomatic metaphysics''. Dordrecht: D. Reidel Publishing Company, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; By implication, for every fuzzy object there exists always at least one [[defuzzification|defuzzified]] concept which encodes it exactly. It is a modern interpretation of [[Plato]]'s [[Platonic epistemology|metaphysics of knowledge]],&lt;ref&gt;Norman Gulley, ''Plato's theory of knowledge''[1962]. Milton Park: Routledge, 2013, chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; which expresses confidence in the ability of science to conceptualize the world exactly.

====Platonism====
The Platonic-style interpretation was critiqued by [[Hartry H. Field]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hartry H. Field]], ''Science without numbers. A defense of nominalism.'' Second edition, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Balaguer argues that we do not really know whether mind-independent abstract objects exist or not; so far, we cannot prove whether [[Platonic realism]] is definitely true or false.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Balaguer, ''Platonism and Anti-Platonism in Mathematics''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Defending a cognitive realism, [[Scott Soames]] argues that the reason why this unsolvable conundrum has persisted, is because the ultimate constitution of the meaning of concepts and propositions was misconceived.

Traditionally, it was thought that concepts can be truly representational, because ultimately they are related to intrinsically representational Platonic complexes of [[Problem of universals|universals]] and [[particular]]s. However, once concepts and propositions are regarded as cognitive-event types, it is possible to claim that they are able to be representational, because they are constitutively related to intrinsically representational cognitive acts in the real world.&lt;ref&gt;"Unlike the platonic epistemology required by the classic Frege-Russell account... the epistemology of naturalized propositions sees acquaintance with, and knowledge of, propositions as rooted in acquaintance with, and knowledge of, acts and events that make up one's cognitive life" - Scott Soames, ''What is meaning?''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2010, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; As another philosopher put it, 
{{Quotation|"The question of how we can know the world around us is not entirely unlike the question of how it is that the food our environment provides happens to agree with our stomachs. Either can become a mystery if we forget that minds, like stomachs, originated in and have been conditioned by a pre-existent natural order."&lt;ref&gt;William Ashley, ''Marxism and moral concepts''. New York: Monthly Review Press, 1964, pp. 4-5. Similarly, [[Paul Lafargue]] had written in his essay "The Origin of Abstract Ideas" (1900) that "The brain has the property of thinking as the stomach has that of digesting. It cannot think but by the aid of ideas, which it fabricates with the materials furnished it by the natural environment and the social or artificial environment in which man evolves." [https://www.marxists.org/archive/lafargue/1898/xx/abstract.htm]
&lt;/ref&gt; }}
Along these lines, it could be argued that reality, and the human cognition of reality, will inevitably contain some fuzzy characteristics, which can be represented only by concepts which are themselves fuzzy to some or other extent.

==Social science and the media==
The idea of fuzzy concepts has also been applied in the philosophical, sociological and linguistic analysis of human behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;John Coates, ''The claims of common sense; Moore, Wittgenstein, Keynes and the social sciences''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1973 paper, [[George Lakoff]] analyzed hedges in the interpretation of the meaning of categories.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Lakoff]], "Hedges: A Study in Meaning Criteria and the Logic of Fuzzy Concepts."

A concept may be deliberately created by sociologists as an [[ideal type]] to understand something imaginatively, without any strong claim that it is a "true and complete description" or a "true and complete reflection" of whatever is being conceptualized.&lt;ref&gt;Edward A. Shils &amp; Henry A. Finch (eds.), ''Max Weber on the methodology of the social sciences''. Glencoe, Ill.: The Free Press, 1949, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In a more general sociological or journalistic sense, a "fuzzy concept" has come to mean a concept which is meaningful but inexact, implying that it does not exhaustively or completely define the meaning of the phenomenon to which it refers – often because it is too abstract. In this context, it is said that fuzzy concepts "lack clarity and are difficult to test or operationalize".&lt;ref&gt;Ann Markusen, "Fuzzy Concepts, Scanty Evidence, Policy Distance: The Case for Rigour and Policy Relevance in Critical Regional Studies." In: ''Regional Studies'', Volume 37, Issue 6-7, 2003, pp. 701–717.&lt;/ref&gt; To specify the relevant meaning more precisely, additional distinctions, conditions and/or qualifiers would be required.

A few examples can illustrate this kind of usage:
*a handbook of sociology states that "The theory of interaction rituals contains some gaps that need to be filled and some fuzzy concepts that need to be differentiated."&lt;ref&gt;Jörg Rössel and [[Randall Collins]], "Conflict theory and interaction rituals. The microfoundations of conflict theory." In: [[Jonathan H. Turner]] (ed.), ''Handbook of Sociological Theory''. New York: Springer, 2001, p. 527.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is, that if finer distinctions are introduced, then the fuzziness or vagueness would be eliminated. 
*a book on youth culture describes [[ethnicity]] as "a fuzzy concept that overlaps at times with concepts of race, minority, nationality and tribe".&lt;ref&gt;Carol Jenkins, "Ethnicity, culture, drugs and sex". In: Peter Aggleton, Andrew Ball and Purnima Mane (eds.), "Sex, Drugs and Young People: International Perspectives." London: Routledge, 2006, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, part of the fuzziness consists in the inability to distinguish precisely between a concept and a different, but closely related concept.
*a book on sociological theory argues that the [[Critical Theory]] of domination faces the problem that "reality itself has become a rather meaningless, fuzzy concept."&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Chaplin, ''Sociology and visual representation''. London: Routledge, 1994, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; The suggestion here is, that the variations in how theoretical concepts are applied have become so large, that the concepts could mean all kinds of things, and therefore are crucially vague (with the implication, that they are not useful any longer for that very reason).
*A history book states: "[[Sodomy]] was a vague and fuzzy concept in [[medieval]] and [[early modern Europe]], and was often associated with a variety of supposedly related moral and criminal offenses, including [[heresy]], [[witchcraft]], [[sedition]], and [[treason]]. St [[Thomas Acquinas]]... categorized sodomy with an assortment of sexual behaviours "from which generation [i.e. procreation] cannot follow".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Lynch (ed.), ''Christopher Marlowe: Edward II, with related texts''. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 2015, p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, because a concept is defined by what it excludes, it remains somewhat vague what items of activity it would specifically ''include''.

===Mass media===
The main reason why the term "fuzzy concept" is now often used in describing human behaviour, is that human interaction has many characteristics which are difficult to quantify and measure precisely (although we know that they have magnitudes and proportions), among other things because they are interactive and reflexive (the observers and the observed mutually influence the meaning of events).&lt;ref&gt;[[Loïc Wacquant]], "The fuzzy logic of practical sense." in: [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and [[Loïc Wacquant]], ''An invitation to reflexive sociology''. London: Polity Press, 1992, chapter I section 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Those human characteristics can be usefully expressed only in an ''approximate'' way (see [[reflexivity (social theory)]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ph. Manning "Fuzzy Description: Discovery and Invention in Sociology". In: ''History of the Human Sciences'', Vol. 7, No. 1, 1994, pp. 117–23.[http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1049&amp;context=clsoc_crim_facpub]&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspaper stories frequently contain fuzzy concepts, which are readily understood and used, even although they are far from exact. Thus, many of the meanings which people ordinarily use to negotiate their way through life in reality turn out to be "fuzzy concepts". While people often do need to be exact about some things (e.g. money or time), many areas of their lives involve expressions which are far from exact.

Sometimes the term is also used in a [[pejorative]] sense. For example, a [[New York Times]] journalist wrote that [[Prince Sihanouk]] "seems unable to differentiate between friends and enemies, a disturbing trait since it suggests that he stands for nothing beyond the fuzzy concept of peace and prosperity in Cambodia".&lt;ref&gt;Philip Shenon, "Their prince is back: Cambodians are baffled." ''New York Times'', 6 June 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applied social science===
The use of fuzzy logic in the social sciences and humanities has remained limited until recently. [[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] said in a 1994 interview that:

{{Quotation|"I expected people in the social sciences – economics, psychology, philosophy, linguistics, politics, sociology, religion and numerous other areas to pick up on it. It's been somewhat of a mystery to me why even to this day, so few social scientists have discovered how useful it could be."&lt;ref&gt;Betty Blair, "Interview with Lotfi Zadeh, Creator of Fuzzy Logic". ''Azerbaijan International'', Winter 1994, pp. 46–47.[http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/24_folder/24_articles/24_fuzzylogic.html]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Two decades later, after a digital [[information explosion]] due to the growing use of the internet and mobile phones worldwide,  fuzzy concepts and fuzzy logic are being widely applied in [[big data]] analysis of social, commercial and psychological phenomena. Many [[sociometry|sociometric]] and [[psychometrics|psychometric]] indicators are based partly on fuzzy concepts and fuzzy variables.

[[Jaakko Hintikka]] once claimed that "the logic of natural language we are in effect already using can serve as a "fuzzy logic" better than its trade name variant without any additional assumptions or constructions."&lt;ref&gt;[[Johan van Benthem (logician)|Johan van Benthem]] et al. (eds.), ''The age of alternative logics. Assessing philosophy of logic and mathematics today''. Dordrecht: Springer, 2006, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; That might help to explain why fuzzy logic has not been used much to formalize concepts in the "soft" social sciences. 

[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] rejected such an interpretation, on the ground that in many human endeavours as well as technologies it is highly important to define more exactly "to what extent" something is applicable or true, when it is known that its applicability can vary to some important extent among large populations. Reasoning which accepts and uses fuzzy concepts can be shown to be perfectly valid with the aid of fuzzy logic, because the degrees of applicability of a concept can be more precisely and efficiently defined with the aid of numerical notation.

Another possible explanation for the traditional lack of use of fuzzy logic by social scientists is simply that, beyond basic statistical analysis (using programs such as [[SPSS]] and [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]]) the mathematical knowledge of social scientists is often rather limited; they may not know how to formalize and code a fuzzy concept using the conventions of fuzzy logic. The standard software packages used provide only a limited capacity to analyze fuzzy data sets, if at all, and considerable skills are required. 

Yet Jaakko Hintikka may be correct, in the sense that it can be much more efficient to use natural language to denote a complex idea, than to formalize it in logical terms. The quest for formalization might introduce much more complexity, which is not wanted, and which detracts from communicating the relevant issue. Some concepts used in social science may be impossible to formalize exactly, even though they are quite useful and people understand their appropriate application quite well.

==Uncertainty==

Fuzzy concepts can generate [[uncertainty]] because they are imprecise (especially if they refer to a process in motion, or a process of transformation where something is "in the process of turning into something else"). In that case, they do not provide a clear orientation for action or decision-making ("what does X really mean, intend or imply?"); reducing fuzziness, perhaps by applying fuzzy logic,&lt;ref&gt;Kofi Kissi Dompere, ''Fuzziness and approximate reasoning; epistemics on uncertainty, expectation and risk in rational behaviour''. Berlin: Springer, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; might generate more certainty.

===Relevance===
However, this is not necessarily always so.&lt;ref&gt;Masao Mukaidono, ''Fuzzy logic for beginners''. Singapore: World Scientific Publishing, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; A concept, even although it is not fuzzy at all, and even though it is very exact, could equally well fail to capture the meaning of something adequately. That is, a concept can be very precise and exact, but not – or insufficiently – ''applicable'' or ''relevant'' in the situation to which it refers. In this sense, a definition can be "very precise", but "miss the point" altogether.

===Security===
A fuzzy concept may indeed provide ''more'' security, because it provides a meaning for something when an exact concept is unavailable – which is better than not being able to denote it at all. A concept such as [[God]], although not easily definable, for instance can provide security to the believer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karen Armstrong]], ''The Case for God''. New York: Anchor, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observer effect===
In physics, the [[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]] and [[Uncertainty principle|Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]]&lt;ref&gt;[[David Bohm]], ''Wholeness and the implicate order.'' London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul ARK paperback edition, 1983, p. 86f.&lt;/ref&gt; indicate that there is a physical limit to the amount of precision that is knowable, with regard to the movements of subatomic particles and waves. That is, features of physical reality exist, where we can know that they vary in magnitude, but of which we can never know or predict exactly how big or small the variations are. This insight suggests that, in some areas of our experience of the physical world, fuzziness is inevitable and can never be totally removed. Since the [[Universe|physical universe]] itself is incredibly large and diverse, it is not easy to imagine it, grasp it or describe it without using fuzzy concepts.

==Language==
Ordinary language, which uses symbolic conventions and associations which are often not logical, inherently contains many fuzzy concepts – "knowing what you mean" in this case depends partly on knowing the context (or being familiar with the way in which a term is normally used, or what it is associated with). 

This can be easily verified for instance by consulting a [[dictionary]], a [[thesaurus]] or an [[encyclopedia]] which show the multiple meanings of words, or by observing the behaviours involved in ordinary relationships which rely on mutually understood meanings (see also [[Imprecise language]]). [[Bertrand Russell]] regarded ordinary language (in contrast to logic) as intrinsically vague.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell. "Vagueness". In: ''Australasian Journal of Psychology and Philosophy'', Vol. 1, pp. 84–92, 1923. Reprinted in: ''Bertrand Russell Papers'', Vol. 9, pp. 147–54. Nadine Faulkner, "Russell and vagueness." ''Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies'', Summer 2003, pp. 43–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implicature===
To communicate, receive or convey a [[message]], an individual somehow has to bridge his own intended meaning and the meanings which are understood by others, i.e., the message has to be conveyed in a way that it will be socially understood, preferably in the intended manner. Thus, people might state: "you have to say it in a way that I understand". Even if the message is clear and precise, it may nevertheless not be received in the way it was intended.

Bridging meanings may be done instinctively, habitually or unconsciously, but it usually involves a choice of terms, assumptions or [[symbols]] whose meanings are not completely fixed, but which depend among other things on how the receivers of the message respond to it, or the [[context (language use)|context]]. In this sense, meaning is often "negotiated" or "interactive" (or, more cynically, manipulated). This gives rise to many fuzzy concepts.

The semantic challenge of conveying meanings to an audience was explored in detail, and analyzed logically, by the British philosopher [[Paul Grice]] - using, among other things, the concept of [[implicature]].&lt;ref&gt;A critique of Grice is provided by Wayne A. Davis, ''Implicature: intention, convention, and principle in the failure of Gricean theory.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998. An example of a specific application of Gricean theory is: Penelope Brown &amp; Stephen C. Levinson, ''Politeness: some universals in language use''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Implicature refers to what is ''suggested'' by a message to the recipient, without being either explicitly expressed or logically entailed by its content. The suggestion could be very clear to the recipient (perhaps a sort of code), but it could also be vague or fuzzy.

===Paradoxes===
Even using ordinary [[set theory]] and [[Principle of bivalence|binary logic]] to reason something out, logicians have discovered that it is possible to generate statements which are logically speaking not completely true or imply a [[paradox]],&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Hughes &amp; George Brecht, ''Vicious Circles and Infinity. An anthology of Paradoxes.'' Penguin Books, 1978. Nicholas Rescher, ''Epistemological Studies''. Frankfurt: Ontos Verlag, 2009, chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; even although in other respects they conform to logical rules (see [[Russell's paradox]]). [[David Hilbert]] concluded that the existence of such logical paradoxes tells us "that we must develop a meta-mathematical analysis of the notions of proof and of the axiomatic method; their importance is methodological as well as epistemological".
&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Cantini, "Paradoxes and Contemporary Logic", ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' 30 April 2012.[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradoxes-contemporary-logic/#RusCon]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
Various different aspects of human experience commonly generate concepts with fuzzy characteristics.
===Human vs. Computer===
The formation of fuzzy concepts is partly due to the fact that the human brain does not operate like a computer (see also [[Chinese room]]).&lt;ref&gt;See further Radim Bělohlávek &amp; George J. Klir (eds.) ''Concepts and Fuzzy Logic''. MIT Press, 2011. [[John R. Searle]], "Minds, brains and programs". ''The behavioral and brain sciences'', Vol. 3, No. 3, 1980, pp. 417–457. [[Robert Epstein]], "The empty brain", ''Aeon'', 18 May 2016.[https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-does-not-process-information-and-it-is-not-a-computer]&lt;/ref&gt;
*While ordinary computers use strict binary logic gates, the brain does not;  i.e., it is capable of making all kinds of neural associations according to all kinds of ordering principles (or fairly chaotically) in associative patterns which are not logical but nevertheless meaningful. For example, a work of art can be meaningful without being logical. A pattern can be regular, ordered and/or non-arbitrary, hence meaningful, without it being possible to describe it completely or exhaustively in formal-logical terms.
*Something can be meaningful although we cannot name it, or we might only be able to name it and nothing else.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Collins, ''Tacit &amp; explicit knowledge''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Human brains can also interpret the same phenomenon in several different but interacting frames of reference, at the same time, or in quick succession, without there necessarily being an explicit logical connection between the frames (see also [[framing effect]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]], "The framing of decisions and psychology of choice". ''Science'', Vol. 211, No. 4481, January 1981, pp. 453-458.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[fuzzy-trace theory]], partly inspired by [[Gestalt psychology]], human intuition is a non-arbitrary, reasonable and rational process of cognition; it literally "makes sense" (see also: [[Problem of multiple generality]]).&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Brainerd and V. F. Reyna, “Gist is the grist: fuzzy-trace theory and the new intuitionism”. ''Developmental Review'', Vol. 10, No. 1, March 1990, pp. 3-47, at p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning===
In part, fuzzy concepts arise also because [[learning]] or the growth of [[understanding]] involves a transition from a vague awareness, which cannot orient behaviour greatly, to clearer insight, which can orient behaviour. At the first encounter with an idea, the sense of the idea may be rather hazy. When more experience with the idea has occurred, a clearer and more precise grasp of the idea results, as well as a better understanding of how and when to use the idea (or not). 

In his study of [[implicit learning]], [[Arthur S. Reber]] affirms that there does not exist a very sharp boundary between the conscious and the unconscious, and "there are always going to be lots of fuzzy borderline cases of material that is marginally conscious and lots of elusive instances of functions and processes that seem to slip in and out of personal awareness".&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur S. Reber]], ''Implicit learning and tacit knowledge. An essay on the cognitive unconscious''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993, pp. 137-138.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Thus, an inevitable component of fuzziness exists and persists in human consciousness, because of continual variation of gradations in awareness, along a continuum from the [[conscious]], the [[preconscious]], and the [[subconscious]] to the [[unconscious mind|unconscious]]. The hypnotherapist [[Milton H. Erickson]] noted likewise that the conscious mind and the unconscious normally interact.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald A. Havens (ed.), ''The wisdom of Milton H. Erickson, Volume II: human behavior &amp; psychotherapy.'' New York: Irvington Publishers, 1992, chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limits===
Some psychologists and logicians argue that fuzzy concepts are a necessary consequence of the reality that any kind of distinction we might like to draw has ''limits of application''. At a certain level of generality, a distinction works fine. But if we pursued its application in a very exact and [[rigorous]] manner, or overextend its application, it appears that the distinction simply does not apply in some areas or contexts, or that we cannot fully specify how it should be drawn. An [[analogy]] might be, that zooming a [[telescope]], [[camera]], or [[microscope]] in and out, reveals that a pattern which is sharply focused at a certain distance becomes blurry at another distance, or disappears altogether.

===Complexity===
Faced with any large, complex and continually changing phenomenon, any short statement made about that phenomenon is likely to be "fuzzy", i.e., it is meaningful, but – strictly speaking – incorrect and imprecise.&lt;ref&gt;A. Cornelius Benjamin, "Science and vagueness". In: ''Philosophy of science'', Vol. 6 No. 4, 1939, pp. 422-431.&lt;/ref&gt; It will not really do full justice to the reality of what is happening with the phenomenon. A correct, precise statement would require a lot of elaborations and qualifiers. Nevertheless, the "fuzzy" description turns out to be a useful shorthand that saves a lot of time in communicating what is going on ("you know what I mean").

===Cognition===
In [[psychophysics]], it was discovered that the perceptual distinctions we draw in the mind are often more definite than they are in the real world. Thus, the brain actually tends to "sharpen up" or "enhance" our perceptions of differences in the external world. 
*Between black and white, we are able to detect only a limited number of shades of gray, or colour gradations (there are "[[Absolute threshold|detection thresholds]]").&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Knoblauch, "Color Vision", in: ''Steven's handbook of experimental psychology, Vol 1: sensation and perception'' (3rd ed.). New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2002, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Motion blur]] refers to the loss of detail when a person looks at a fast-moving object, or is moving fast while the eyes are focused on something stationary. In a movie reel, the human eye can detect a sequence of up to 10 or 12 still images per second. At around 18 to 26 frames per second, the brain will "see" the sequence of individual images as a moving scene.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Tarantola, "Why Frame Rate Matters". Gizmodo.com, 14 January 2015.[https://gizmodo.com/why-frame-rate-matters-1675153198]&lt;/ref&gt;

If there are more gradations and transitions in reality, than our conceptual or perceptual distinctions can capture, then it could be argued that how those distinctions will actually apply, must ''necessarily'' become vaguer at some point.

===Novelty===
In interacting with the external world, the human mind may often encounter new, or partly ''new phenomena or relationships'' which cannot (yet) be sharply defined given the background knowledge available, and by known distinctions, associations or generalizations.

{{Quotation|"Crisis management plans cannot be put 'on the fly' after the crisis occurs. At the outset, information is often [[vague]], even contradictory. Events move so quickly that decision makers experience a sense of loss of control. Often denial sets in, and managers unintentionally cut off information flow about the situation" - [[L. Paul Bremer]].&lt;ref&gt;[[L. Paul Bremer]], "Corporate governance and crisis management", in: ''Directors &amp; Boards'', Winter 2002&lt;/ref&gt; }}

===Chaos===
It also can be argued that fuzzy concepts are generated by a certain sort of [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] or way of working which evades definite distinctions, makes them impossible or inoperable, or which is in some way chaotic. To obtain concepts which are not fuzzy, it must be possible to [[Test method|test]] out their application in some way. But in the absence of any relevant clear distinctions, lacking an orderly environment, or when everything is "in a state of [[flux]]" or in transition, it may not be possible to do so, so that the amount of fuzziness increases.

==Everyday occurrence==

Fuzzy concepts often play a role in the creative process of forming new concepts to understand something. In the most primitive sense, this can be observed in infants who, through practical experience, learn to identify, distinguish and generalise the correct application of a concept, and relate it to other concepts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Piaget]] &amp; [[Bärbel Inhelder]], ''The Growth of Logical Thinking from Childhood to Adolescence''. New York: Basic Books, 1958; Philip J. Kelman &amp; Martha E. Arterberry, ''The cradle of knowledge: development of perception in infancy''. Cambridge, Mass.: The MIT Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, fuzzy concepts may also occur in scientific, journalistic, programming and philosophical activity, when a thinker is in the process of clarifying and defining a newly emerging concept which is based on distinctions which, for one reason or another, cannot (yet) be more exactly specified or validated. Fuzzy concepts are often used to denote [[Complexity|complex]] phenomena, or to describe something which is developing and changing, which might involve shedding some old meanings and acquiring new ones.

===Areas===
*In [[meteorology]], where changes and effects of complex interactions in the atmosphere are studied, the weather reports often use fuzzy expressions indicating a broad trend, likelihood or level. The main reason is that the forecast can rarely be totally exact for any given location.
*In [[biology]], protein complexes with multiple structural forms are called [[fuzzy complex]]es. The different conformations can result in different, even opposite functions. The conformational ensemble is modulated by the environmental conditions. Post-translational modifications or alternative splicing can also impact the ensemble and thereby the affinity or specificity of interactions. [[Genetic fuzzy systems]] use [[algorithms]] or [[genetic programming]] which simulate natural evolutionary processes, in order to understand their structures and parameters.
*In [[medical diagnosis]], the assessment of what the symptoms of a patient are often cannot be very exactly specified, since there are many possible qualitative and quantitative gradations in severity, incidence or frequency that could occur.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Seising, "On the absence of strict boundaries — Vagueness, haziness, and fuzziness in philosophy, science, and medicine". ''Applied Soft Computing'', Vol 8, 2008, pp. 1232–1242, at p. 1235.&lt;/ref&gt; Different symptoms may also overlap to some extent. These gradations can be difficult to measure, it may cost a lot of time and money, and so the medical professionals might use approximate "fuzzy" categories in their judgement of a medical condition or a patient's condition. Although it may not be exact, the diagnosis is often useful enough for treatment purposes. Fuzzy logic is increasingly employed in diagnostic and medical equipment capable of measuring gradations of a condition.&lt;ref&gt;Kazem Sadegh-Zadeh "The Fuzzy Revolution: Goodbye to the Aristotelian Weltanschauung". In: ''Artificial Intelligence in Medicine'', 21, 2001, pp. 18–19.[http://www.iiia.csic.es/~puyol/SEIAD2001/publicacions/sadegh.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[information services]] fuzzy concepts are frequently encountered because a customer or client asks a question about something which could be interpreted in different ways, or, a document is transmitted of a type or meaning which cannot be easily allocated to a known type or category, or to a known procedure. It might take considerable inquiry to "place" the information, or establish in what framework it should be understood.
*In [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] which aims to study the structure of subjective experience without preconceptions,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Priest, Theories of the mind. London: Penguin Books, 1991, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; an important insight is that how someone experiences something can be influenced ''both'' by the influence of the thing being experienced itself, but ''also'' by how the person responds to it.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hammond, Jane Howarth and Russell Keat, ''Understanding Phenomenology''. Oxford: Blackwell, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the actual experience the person has, is shaped by an "interactive object-subject relationship". To describe this experience, fuzzy categories are often necessary, since it is often impossible to predict or describe with great exactitude what the interaction will be, and how it is experienced.
*In [[translation]] work, fuzzy concepts are analyzed for the purpose of good translation. A concept in one language may not have quite the same meaning or significance in another language, or it may not be feasible to translate it literally, or at all.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelia Griebel, "Fuzzy concepts in translators’ minds". In: Valérie Dullion, ''Between specialised texts and institutional contexts – competence and choice in legal translation''. Amsterdam:  John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2017. (Special issue of ''Translation and Translanguaging in Multilingual Contexts'', Vol. 3, No. 1, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Some languages have concepts which do not exist in another language, raising the problem of how one would most easily render their meaning. In [[computer-assisted translation]], a technique called [[Fuzzy matching (computer-assisted translation)|fuzzy matching]] is used to find the most likely translation of a piece of text, using previous translated texts as a basis.
*In [[hypnotherapy]], fuzzy language is deliberately used for the purpose of trance induction. Hypnotic suggestions are often couched in a somewhat vague, general or ambiguous language requiring interpretation by the subject. The intention is to distract and shift the conscious awareness of the subject away from external reality to her own internal state. In response to the somewhat confusing signals she gets, the awareness of the subject spontaneously tends to withdraw inward, in search of understanding or escape.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald A. Havens (ed.), ''The wisdom of Milton H.  Erickson, Volume I: hypnosis and hypnotherapy''. New York: Irvington Publishers, 1992, p. 106. Joseph O'Connor &amp; John Seymour (ed.), ''Introducing neuro-linguistic programming''. London: Thorsons, 1995, p. 116f.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[business]] and [[economics]], it was discovered that "we are guided less by a correct exact knowledge of our self-interest than by a socially learned, evolved, intuitive grasp derived from mental shortcuts ([[Framing effect (psychology)|frames]], reference points, envy, addiction, temptation, fairness)".&lt;ref&gt;Francese Trillas, "Fuzzy logic and modern economics." In:  Rudolf Seising, Enric Trillas &amp; [[Janusz Kacprzyk]] (eds.), ''Towards the future of fuzzy logic''. Basel: Springer International Publishing, 2015, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, economic preferences are often ''fuzzy'' preferences, a highly important point for suppliers of products and services. Fuzzy set empirical methodologies are increasingly used by economic analysts to analyze the extent to which members of a population belong to a specific market category, because that can make a big difference to business results.
*In [[sexology]],  sex and gender are conceptualized by gender pluralists as a spectrum or continuum, or a set of scaled characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Surya Monro, ‘’Bisexuality’’. Houndmills, Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2015, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the idea that people are either heterosexual [[men]], heterosexual [[women]], [[gay]], [[lesbian]], [[bisexual]] or [[transsexual]] is far too simplistic; [[gender identity]] is a matter of degree, a graded concept, which for that very reason is a ''fuzzy'' concept with unsharp boundaries. For example, somebody who is "mainly" heterosexual, may occasionally have had non-heterosexual contacts, without this warranting a definite "bisexual" label. A great variety of sexual orientations are possible and can co-exist. In the course of history, typical male or female gender roles and gender characteristics can also gradually change, so that the extent to which they express "masculine" or "feminine" traits is, at any time, a matter of degree, i.e. fuzzy. 
*In [[politics]], it can be highly important and problematic how exactly a conceptual distinction is drawn, or indeed whether a distinction is drawn at all; distinctions used in administration may be deliberately sharpened, or kept fuzzy, due to some political motive or [[Political power|power]] relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bart Kosko]], "Yes, Candidates, There Is a Fuzzy Math". ''New York Times'', 7 November 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians may be deliberately vague about some things, and very clear and explicit about others; if there is information that proves their case, they become very precise, but if the information doesn't prove their case, they become vague or say nothing. 
*In [[statistical]] research, it is an aim to measure the magnitudes of phenomena. For this purpose, phenomena have to be grouped and categorized, so that distinct and discrete counting units can be defined. It must be possible to allocate all observations to mutually exclusive categories, so that they are properly quantifiable. Survey observations do not spontaneously transform themselves into countable data; they have to be identified, categorized and classified in such a way, that identical observations can be grouped together, and that observations are not counted twice or more.&lt;ref&gt;Russel Gordon &amp; David Bendien, "Standard classifications". ''New Zealand Statistics Review'', September 1993, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; A well-designed questionnaire ensures that the questions are interpreted in the same way by all respondents, and that the respondents are really able to answer them within the formats provided. Again, for this purpose, it is a requirement that the concepts being used are exactly and comprehensibly defined for all concerned, and not fuzzy.&lt;ref&gt;Paul C. Bauer et al., "Vague concepts in survey questions. A general problem illustrated with the left-right scale." SSRN Electronic Journal, April 2014.[http://pablobarbera.com/static/vague-concepts.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; There could be a margin of measurement error, but the amount of error must be kept within tolerable limits, and preferably its magnitude should be known.
*In [[theology]] an attempt is made to define more precisely the meaning of [[spirtuality|spiritual]] concepts, which refer to how human beings construct the meaning of human existence, and, often, the relationship people have with a [[supernatural]] world. Many spiritual concepts and beliefs are fuzzy, to the extent that, although abstract, they often have a highly personalized meaning, or involve personal interpretation of a type that is not easy to define in a cut-and-dried way. A similar situation occurs in [[psychotherapy]]. The Dutch theologian Kees de Groot has explored the imprecise notion that [[psychotherapy]] is like an "implicit [[religion]]", defined as a "fuzzy concept" (it all depends on what one means by "psychotherapy" and "religion").&lt;ref&gt;C.N. de Groot, "Sociology of religion looks at psychotherapy." ''Recherches sociologiques'' (Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium), Vol. 29, No. 2, 1998, pp. 3–17 at p. 4.[http://arno.uvt.nl/show.cgi?fid=76988]&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher of spirituality [[Ken Wilber]] argued that "nothing is 100% right or wrong", things merely "vary in their degree of incompleteness and dysfunction"; no one and nothing is 100% good or evil, each just varies "in their degree of ignorance and disconnection". This insight suggests, that ''all'' human valuations can be considered as graded concepts, where each qualitative judgement has at least implicitly a sense of quantitative proportion attached to it.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Manson, "The rise and fall of Ken Wilber", markmanson.net, 4 June 2012.[https://markmanson.net/ken-wilber]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the [[legal system]], it is essential that rules are interpreted and applied in a standard way, so that the same sorts of cases and the same sorts of circumstances are treated equally. Otherwise one would be accused of arbitrariness,&lt;ref&gt;That is, in applying rules, the rules are not consistently followed, and the pattern of their application therefore does not follow rules.&lt;/ref&gt; which would not serve the interests of justice. Consequently, lawmakers aim to devise definitions and categories which are sufficiently precise, so that they are not open to different interpretations. For this purpose, it is critically important to remove fuzziness, and differences of interpretation are typically resolved through a court ruling based on evidence. Alternatively, some other procedure is devised which permits the correct distinction to be discovered and made.&lt;ref&gt;For more information see e.g. Ralf Posche, "Ambiguity And Vagueness In Legal Interpretation", in: Lawrence M. Solan &amp; Peter M. Tiersma (eds.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Language and Law''. Oxford University Press, 2012, pp. 128-144.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Business administration|administration]], [[Archive|archiving]] and [[accounting]], fuzziness problems in interpretation and boundary problems can arise, because it is not clear to what category exactly a case, item, document, transaction or piece of data belongs. In principle, each case, event or item must be allocated to the correct category in a procedure, but it may be, that it is difficult to make the appropriate or relevant distinctions.&lt;ref&gt;David Henry, "Fuzzy Numbers', ''Bloomberg Businessweek'', 3 October 2004.[http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2004-10-03/fuzzy-numbers]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generalities===
It could be argued that many concepts used fairly universally in daily life (e.g. "love", "God", "health",  "social", "tolerance" etc.) are ''inherently or intrinsically'' fuzzy concepts, to the extent that their meaning can never be completely and exactly specified with logical operators or objective terms, and can have multiple interpretations, which are at least in part purely subjective. Yet despite this limitation, such concepts are not meaningless. People keep using the concepts, even if they are difficult to define precisely.

===Multiple meanings===
It may also be possible to specify one personal meaning for the concept, without however placing restrictions on a different use of the concept in other contexts (as when, for example, one says "this is what I mean by X" in contrast to other possible meanings). In ordinary speech, concepts may sometimes also be uttered purely randomly; for example a child may repeat the same idea in completely unrelated contexts, or an [[Expletive attributive|expletive]] term may be uttered arbitrarily. A feeling or sense is conveyed, without it being fully clear what it is about.

[[Happiness#definitions|Happiness]] may be an example of a word with variable meanings depending on context.

===Ambiguities===
Fuzzy concepts can be used deliberately to create [[ambiguity]] and [[vagueness]], as an evasive tactic, or to bridge what would otherwise be immediately recognized as a [[contradiction]] of terms. They might be used to indicate that there is definitely a connection between two things, without giving a complete specification of what the connection is, for some or other reason. This could be due to a failure or refusal to be more precise. But it could also could be a prologue to a more exact formulation of a concept, or to a better understanding of it.

==Efficiency==

Fuzzy concepts can be used as a practical method to describe something of which a complete description would be an unmanageably large undertaking, or very time-consuming; thus, a simplified indication of what is at issue is regarded as sufficient, although it is not exact.

===Popper===
There is also such a thing as an "economy of distinctions", meaning that it is not helpful or efficient to use more detailed definitions than are really necessary for a given purpose. In this sense, [[Karl Popper]] rejected [[pedant]]ry and commented that:

{{Quotation| "...it is always undesirable to make an effort to increase precision for its own sake — especially linguistic precision — since this usually leads to loss of clarity, and to a waste of time and effort on preliminaries which often turn out to be useless, because they are bypassed by the real advance of the subject: one should never try to be more precise than the problem situation demands. I might perhaps state my position as follows. Every increase in clarity is of intellectual value in itself; an increase in precision or exactness has only a pragmatic value as a means to some definite end..."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper, ''Unended quest: an intellectual autobiography''. London: Routledge, 2002, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The provision of "too many details" could be disorienting and confusing, instead of being enlightening, while a fuzzy term might be sufficient to provide an orientation. The reason for using fuzzy concepts can therefore be purely pragmatic, if it is not feasible or desirable (for practical purposes) to provide "all the details" about the meaning of a shared symbol or sign. Thus people might say "I realize this is not exact, but you know what I mean" – they assume practically that stating all the details is not required for the purpose of the communication.

===Fuzzy logic gambit===
[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] picked up this point, and drew attention to a "major misunderstanding" about applying fuzzy logic. It is true that the basic aim of fuzzy logic is to make what is imprecise more precise. Yet in many cases, fuzzy logic is used paradoxically to "imprecisiate what is precise", meaning that there is a deliberate tolerance for imprecision for the sake of simplicity of procedure and economy of expression. 

In such uses, there is a tolerance for imprecision, because making ideas more precise would be unnecessary and costly, while "imprecisiation reduces cost and enhances tractability" (tractability means "being easy to manage or operationalize"). Zadeh calls this approach the "Fuzzy Logic Gambit" (a gambit means giving up something now, to achieve a better position later).

In the Fuzzy Logic Gambit, "what is sacrificed is precision in [quantitative] value, but not precision in meaning", and more concretely, "imprecisiation in value is followed by precisiation in meaning". Zadeh cited as example [[Fuzzy control system|Takeshi Yamakawa]]'s programming for an [[inverted pendulum]], where differential equations are replaced by fuzzy if-then rules in which words are used in place of numbers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "What is fuzzy logic?". ''IFSA Newsletter'' (International Fuzzy Systems Association), Vol. 10, No. 1, March 2013. Takeshi Yamakawa "Stabilization of an Inverted Pendulum by a High-speed Fuzzy Logic Controller Hardware System". ''Fuzzy Sets and Systems'', Vol.32, pp. 161–180, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fuzzy vs. Boolean===
Common use of this sort of approach, particularly in programming, has led some logicians to regard fuzzy logic merely as an extension of [[Boolean logic]] (a [[two-valued logic]] or binary logic is simply replaced with a [[many-valued logic]]). 

However, Boolean concepts have a logical structure which differs from fuzzy concepts. An important feature in Boolean logic is, that an element of a set can also belong to any number of other sets; even so, the element ''either'' does, ''or'' does not belong to a set (or sets). By contrast, whether an element belongs to a fuzzy set is a matter of degree, and not always a definite yes-or-no question.

All the same, the Greek mathematician Costas Drossos suggests in various papers that, using a "non-standard" mathematical approach, we could also construct fuzzy sets with Boolean characteristics and Boolean sets with fuzzy characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. C. A. Drossos, "Foundations of fuzzy sets: A nonstandard approach". ''Fuzzy Sets and Systems'', Volume 37, Issue 3, 28 September 1990, pp. 287-307.&lt;/ref&gt; This would imply, that in practice the boundary between fuzzy sets and Boolean sets is itself fuzzy, rather than absolute. For a simplified example, we might be able to state, that a concept ''X'' is definitely applicable to a finite set of phenomena, and definitely not applicable to all other phenomena. Yet, within the finite set of relevant items, ''X'' might be ''fully'' applicable to one subset of the included phenomena, while it is applicable only “to some varying extent or degree” to another subset of phenomena which are also included in the set.

==Clarifying methods==
In [[mathematical logic]], [[computer programming]], [[philosophy]] and [[linguistics]] fuzzy concepts can be analyzed and defined more accurately or comprehensively, by describing or modelling the concepts using the terms of [[fuzzy logic]] or other [[substructural logic]]s. More generally, clarification techniques can be used such as:

*1. Contextualizing the concept by defining the setting or situation in which the concept is used, or how it is used appropriately  ([[Context (language use)|context]]).
*2. Identifying the [[intention]], [[purpose]], aim or goal associated with the concept ([[teleology]] and [[design]]).
*3. Comparing and contrasting the concept with related ideas in the present or the past ([[comparative]] and [[comparative research]]).
*4. Creating a [[Conceptual model|model]], likeness, [[analogy]], [[metaphor]], [[prototype]] or [[narrative]] which shows what the concept is about or how it is applied ([[isomorphism]] or [[simulation]]).
*5. ''Probing the [[Presupposition|assumptions]]'' on which a concept is based, or which are associated with its use ([[critical thought]], [[tacit assumption]]).
*6. ''[[Map (mathematics)|Map]]ping or [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]ing'' the applications of the concept using some basic [[parameters]], or using some diagrams or flow charts to understand the relationships between elements involved ([[Visualization (graphics)|visualization]] and [[concept map]]).&lt;ref&gt;Guy W. Mineau et al. (eds.), ''Conceptual graphs for knowledge representation''. Berlin: Springer, 1993. Tru Hoang Cao, ''Conceptual graphs and fuzzy logic''. Berlin: Springer, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
*7. Examining ‘’how likely’’ it is that the concept applies, statistically or intuitively ([[probability theory]]).
*8. Specifying relevant ''conditions'' to which the concept applies, as a procedure ([[computer programming]], [[formal concept analysis]]).
*9. [[Abstract and concrete|Concretizing]] the concept – finding specific examples, illustrations, details or cases to which it applies ([[Exemplification theory|exemplar]], [[exemplification]]).
*10. ''Reducing or restating'' fuzzy concepts in terms which are simpler or similar, and which are not fuzzy or less fuzzy ([[Computer algebra#Simplification|simplification]], [[dimensionality reduction]], [[plain language]], [[KISS principle]] or [[concision]]).
*11. Trying out a concept, by using it in interactions, practical work or in communication, and assessing the feedback to understand how the boundaries and distinctions of the concept are being drawn ([[trial and error]] or [[pilot experiment]]). 
*12. Engaging in a structured [[dialogue]] or repeated [[discussion]], to exchange ideas about how to get specific about what it means and how to clear it up ([[Scrum (software development)|scrum method]]).
*13. Allocating different applications of the concept to different but related ''sets'' ([[Boolean logic]]).
*14. Identifying ''operational rules'' defining the use of the concept, which can be stated in a language and which cover all or most cases ([[material conditional]]).
*15. [[Categorization|Classifying, categorizing, grouping]], or inventorizing all or most cases or uses to which the concept applies ([[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]], [[cluster analysis]] and [[typology (statistics)|typology]]).
[[File:Operationalization of Free and Fair Judiciary.png|thumb|400px|An [[operationalization]] diagram, one method of clarifing fuzzy concepts.]]
*16. Applying a ''[[meta-language]]'' which includes fuzzy concepts in a more inclusive categorical system which is not fuzzy ([[meta]]).
*17. Creating a ''[[Measurement|measure]] or [[Scale (social sciences)|scale]]'' of the degree to which the concept applies ([[metrology]]).
*18. Examining the ''distribution patterns'' or distributional frequency of (possibly different) uses of the concept ([[statistics]]).
*19. Specifying a series of [[logical operators]] or inferential system which captures all or most cases to which the concept applies ([[algorithm]]).
*20. ''Relating'' the fuzzy concept to other concepts which are not fuzzy or less fuzzy, or simply by ''replacing'' the fuzzy concept altogether with another, alternative concept which is not fuzzy yet "works the same way" ([[Proxy (statistics)|proxy]])
*21. Engaging in [[meditation]], or taking the proverbial "run around the block" to clarify the mind, and thus improve precision of thought about the definitional issue ([[self-care]]).

In this way, we can obtain a more exact understanding of the meaning and use of a fuzzy concept, and possibly decrease the amount of fuzziness. It may not be possible to specify all the possible meanings or applications of a concept completely and exhaustively, but if it is possible to capture the majority of them, statistically or otherwise, this may be useful enough for practical purposes.

==Defuzzification==
{{main|Defuzzification}}
A process of [[defuzzification]] is said to occur, when fuzzy concepts can be logically described in terms of [[fuzzy set]]s, or the relationships between fuzzy sets, which makes it possible to define variations in the meaning or applicability of concepts as ''quantities''. Effectively, qualitative differences are in that case described more precisely as quantitative variations, or quantitative variability. Assigning a numerical value then denotes the magnitude of variation along a scale from zero to one.

The difficulty that can occur in judging the fuzziness of a concept can be illustrated with the question ''"Is this one of those?"''. If it is not possible to clearly answer this question, that could be because "this" (the object) is itself fuzzy and evades definition, or because "one of those" (the concept of the object) is fuzzy and inadequately defined.

Thus, the source of fuzziness may be in (1) the nature of the reality being dealt with, (2) the concepts used to interpret it, or (3) the way in which the two are being related by a person.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Timothy Williamson, ''Vagueness''. London: Routledge, 1996, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be that the personal meanings which people attach to something are quite clear to the persons themselves, but that it is not possible to communicate those meanings to others except as fuzzy concepts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3145">'''Hypercyclic morphogenesis''' refers to the emergence of a higher order of self-reproducing structure or organization or hierarchy within a system, first introduced by [[J. Barkley Rosser, Jr.]] in 1991 (Chap. 12).  It involves combining the idea of the ''hypercycle'', an idea due to [[Manfred Eigen]] and [[Peter Schuster]] (1979) with that of ''[[morphogenesis]]'', an idea due to D’Arcy W.Thompson (1917).  The hypercycle involves the problem in biochemistry of molecules combining in a self-reacting group that is able to stay together, posited by Eigen and Schuster as the foundation for the emergence of multi-cellular organisms.  Thompson saw morphogenesis as a central part of the development of an organism as cell differentiation led to new organs appearing as it develops and grows.  [[Alan Turing]] (1952) would study the chemistry and mathematics involved in such a process, which would also be studied mathematically by [[René Thom]] (1972) in his formulation of [[catastrophe theory]].

	Rosser suggested applications in political economy such as the emergence of the European Union out of the conscious actions of the leaders of its constituent nation states (1992), or the appearance of a higher level in an urban hierarchy during economic development (1994).  It has been applied to the emergence of higher levels in an ecological hierarchy (Rosser, Folke, Günther, Isomäki, Perrings, and Puu, 1994), and it can be argued that the final stage of such a development for combined ecologic-economic systems would be the [[noosphere]] of Vladimir I. Vernadsky (1945).

'''Insect names''' have appeared '''in music''' from [[Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s ''[[Flight of the Bumblebee]]'' to such popular songs as "[[Jimmy Crack Corn|Blue-tailed Fly]]" and the folk song ''[[La Cucaracha]]'' which is about a [[cockroach]]. Insect groups mentioned include [[bee]]s, [[ant]]s, [[fly|flies]] and the various singing insects such as [[cicada]]s, [[Cricket (insect)|crickets]], and [[beetle]]s, while other songs refer to ''bugs'' in general.

==Overview==
{{see|List of insect-inspired songs}}

Insects including bees, cicadas, crickets and grasshoppers produce sounds, whether by flying or by [[stridulation]], attracting [[Insects in culture|human interest]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Morris, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Insect sounds have accordingly been the inspiration for a variety of forms of music. Among Western composers, [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] imitates the quick buzzing vibrato of the [[bumblebee]] in his famous ''[[Flight of the Bumblebee]]''; [[Edvard Grieg]] was inspired by flies in his ''Said the Gadfly to the Fly''.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thacker |first1=Sandy |title=Music for the Bug Season in Canada |url=http://music.cbc.ca/#!/blogs/2012/5/Grieg-to-Shostakovich-Music-that-bugs-me |publisher=CBC Music |accessdate=9 April 2016 |date=16 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301002442/http://music.cbc.ca/#!/blogs/2013/6/Rear-view-Mirror-Who-was-Suzanne-and-why-did-Leonard-Cohen-make-her-famous |archivedate=1 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular songs with an insect theme include "Glow-Worm", "Poor Butterfly", "La Cucaracha", "The Boll Weevil", and "The Blue-Tailed Fly". Operas like [[Puccini]]'s ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'' and Rousel's ''Le Festin de L’Araignée'' similarly reference arthropods.&lt;ref name=Hogue&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hogue |first1=Charles |title=Cultural Entomology |journal=Annual Review of Entomology |date=1987 |volume=32 |url=http://www.insects.org/ced1/cult_ent.html |accessdate=4 April 2016 |publisher=Insects.org|doi=10.1146/annurev.en.32.010187.001145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pop groups named after insects include [[Buddy Holly|Buddy Holly and]] [[The Crickets]], [[The Beatles]], [[Adam and the Ants]] and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Insects in Music, Art and Poetry |url=http://horticulture.oregonstate.edu/system/files/u1473/ent300-8.ppt |publisher=Oregon State University |accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; And some fictional crickets in Western popular culture, like [[Jiminy Cricket]] and [[Cri-Cri (character)|Cri-Cri]] have been known to sing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=k1BDUjmppucC&amp;pg=PA49|title=Learning from Mickey, Donald and Walt: Essays on Disney’s Edutainment Films|first=A.

==In popular music==&lt;!--in the broadest sense--&gt;

"[[Ants Marching]]" is a song by the [[Dave Matthews Band]].  The song features the themes of the monotony of everyday life being like ants marching endlessly to and fro.  Both the theme and the music of the song are beloved by fans, being played over 1,000 times live in concert.  Dave Matthews himself once declared, "This song is our anthem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What song defines the Dave Matthews Band?|url=http://www.antsmarching.org/forum/archive/index.php/t-154030.html|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Irish folk singer [[Sinéad Lohan]] included the song "Bee In The Bottle" on her 1995 album ''Who Do You Think I Am''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r372447|first=Tom|last=Demalon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In classical music==
[[File:Flight of the Bumblebee on Pipe Organ Pedals.webm|thumb|left|[[Carol Williams (organist)|Carol Williams]] performs "[[Flight of the Bumblebee]]" by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]].]]

[[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] wrote "[[Flight of the Bumblebee]]" as an orchestral [[wikt:interlude|interlude]] for his opera ''[[The Tale of Tsar Saltan (Rimsky-Korsakov)|The Tale of Tsar Saltan]]'', composed in 1899–1900. The piece closes Act III, Tableau 1, during which the magic Swan-Bird changes Prince Gvidon Saltanovich (the Tsar's son) into a [[bumblebee]] so that he can fly away to visit his father, who does not know that he is alive. The piece is one of the most recognizable in classical music. The fast pace of the music has given rise to its mass appeal, as well as making it difficult to play. Musicians have risen to the challenge by setting world records for the fastest performance on guitar, piano and violin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rimsky-Korsakov - The Flight of the Bumblebee (Homeschool Music Appreciation) |url=http://creatingwithwisdom.blogspot.com/2012/05/rimsky-korsakov-flight-of-bumblebee.html |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fotbbmotives.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Two [[leitmotif]]s occur in the piece, a simple basic theme and the rapid buzzing motif of the [[bumblebee]]'s flight. {{audio|Fotbbmotives1.mid|Play basic theme}} and {{audio|Fotbbmotives2.mid|Play buzzing motif}}]]

The Canadian violinist Eric Speed broke the record for the fastest performance of the ''Flight of the Bumblebee'' at the "Just For Laughs" festival in Montreal on 22 July 2011, playing the piece in 53 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="Eric Speed, Violinist, Flight of the Bumblebee, Nikon S9100, Montreal, 22 July 2011".|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0UCNOdWxI |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song has a direct connection to martial arts master [[Bruce Lee]], who starred on the radio program [[Green Hornet]]. "Flight" was the show's theme music, blended with a hornet buzz created on a Theremin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Green Hornet|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv2-Tz4wPCI|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play upon which the opera was based – written by [[Alexander Pushkin]] – originally had two more insect themes: the Flight of the Mosquito and the Flight of the Fly.  Neither was made into musical pieces.  One was made into an illustration for the original publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neff,|first=Lyle.|title=The Tale of Tsar Saltan: A Centenary Appreciation of Rimski-Korsakov's Second Puškin Opera|journal=The Pushkin Review | volume=2|year=1999|pages=89–133.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Béla Bartók]]'s bizarrely empathetic piece, ''From the Diary of a Fly, for piano (Mikrokosmos Vol. 6/142)'', attempts to depict the actions of a [[fly]] caught in a cobweb, from the fly's perspective—i.e., as related from his diary. The buzzing sounds signify the fly's desperation to escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From the Diary of a Fly, for piano (Mikrokosmos Vol. 6/142), Sz.107/6/142, BB 105/142|url=http://www.allmusic.com/composition/from-the-diary-of-a-fly-for-piano-mikrokosmos-vol-6-142-sz107-6-142-bb-105-142-mc0002665613|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The middle section of the Adagio religioso movement in Bartók's 1945 [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Bartók)|Piano Concerto No. 3]] contains imitations of natural sounds of [[insect]] and [[bird call]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Kovács, János, "Concerto for Piano and Orchestra No. 3"  Booklet note for Hungaroton HCD 31888-91 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Renaissance composer [[Josquin des Prez]], working in Italy, wrote a piece in the style of a [[frottola]] entitled ''El Grillo'' (The Cricket). It is among the most frequently sung of his works.&lt;ref&gt; Macey, Patrick. ''Bonfire Songs: Savonarola's Musical Legacy.'' Oxford: Clarendon Press. 1998. {{ISBN|0-19-816669-9}}.

[[File:2007 Sakura of Fukushima-e 007 rotated.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cherry blossoms]]  are a symbol of ''isagiyosa'' in the sense of embracing the transience of the world]]
In [[Japanese society]], particularly in historical [[Edo society|feudal Japan]], '''''isagiyosa''''' ({{lang|ja|潔さ}}, "purity") is a [[virtue]], translated with "resolute composure" or "[[manliness]]".{{fact|date=August 2015}} 
Isagiyosa is the capability of accepting death with composure and equanimity.{{citation needed|reason=vague|date=August 2015}} It stands besides other central virtues such as public-spiritedness (''kō no seishin''), loyalty (''seijitsusa''), diligence (''kinbensa'') and steadiness (''jimichisa'').

[[Cherry blossom]]s, because of their ephemeral nature, are a symbol of isagiyosa in the sense of embracing the transience of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Berenson, [[Neil deMause]], ''The complete illustrated guidebook to Prospect Park and the Brooklyn Botanic Garden'' (2001), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;  Honda (2001) maintains that these virtues are not Japanese in particular but form a [[moral code]] common to all [[Asia]]n agricultural societies.&lt;ref&gt;Honda Yoshihiko, 2001, ‘Taiwan de “Taiwanron” wa dô yomareta ka,’ Sekai 688: pp. 220-228, cited after  Ulrike Wöhr, ''Japan’s “Return to Asia”: History, Diversity, Gender'', “[http://www.japanesestudies.org.uk/ICAS2/Woehr.pdf Images of Asia in Japanese Mass Media, Popular Culture and Literature]”, Papers Presented at ICAS 2, Berlin, Germany, 9–12 August 2001ü .&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jaime Luciano Balmes y Urpiá''' ({{lang-ca|Jaume Llucià Antoni Balmes i Urpià}}; August 28, 1810{{spaced ndash}}July 9, 1848) was a philosopher, theologian, Catholic apologist, [[sociologist]] and Spanish political writer. Familiar with the doctrine of [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]], Balmes was an original philosopher who did not belong to any particular school or stream, to whom [[Pius XII]] qualified as the ''Prince of Modern Apologetics.''

== Biography ==
Balmes was born at [[Vic]], in the region of [[Catalonia]] in Spain and baptized the same day in the cathedral of that city with the name of Jaime Luciano Antonio. He died in the same city.

In 1817, Balmes began his studies at the seminary in [[Vic]]: three years of Latin grammar, three of [[Rhetoric]] and, from 1822, three of Philosophy. In 1825, in [[Solsona, Lleida|Solsona]], he received the tonsure from the Bishop of this city, Manuel Benito Tabernero.

From 1825 to 1826, Balmes studied courses of Theology, also in [[Vic]] Seminary. He studied four courses of Theology, thanks to a scholarship, in the College of San Carlos at the [[University of Cervera]].

For two years in 1830, because of the closure of the University of Cervera, Balmes continued studying in Vic, on his own. On June 8, 1833 he received his degree in theology.

On September 20, 1834, in the chapel of the episcopal palace of Vic, Balmes was ordained a priest by bishop don Pablo de Jesús Corcuera. He continued his studies in theology and of Canons, again at the University of Cervera. Finally, in 1835, he received the title of Doctor of Theology and Bachelor of Canons.

Balmes then made several attempts to teach in an official way at the [[University of Barcelona]] and not get engaged for some time in Vic tutoring. Finally, the City Council appoints him, in 1837, Professor of Mathematics, a position that he held for four years. In 1839, his mother Teresa Urpiá, died. In 1841, he moved to [[Barcelona]].

Then, Balmes began his creative activity and contributed to various newspapers and magazines: ''Peace'', ''Catholic [[Madrid]]'', ''Civilization''; and several pamphlets that attract readers attention.

From 1841, his creative genius "exploded" and he developed in a few highly active months his writings and his personality, that would be admired throughout Europe.

On September 7, 1844, he wrote and published "The true idea of value, or thoughts on the origin, the nature and variations of the prices" in which he solved the calue paradox, clearly introducing the notion of marginal use, Balmes asked himself, "Why a precious stone has a higher value than a piece of bread?"&lt;ref&gt;James Balmes, "Verdadera idea valor o reflexiones sobre el origin, naturaleza y variedad de los precios", in ''Obra Completas'', vol. 5, Madrid, BAC, 1949, pp. 615–624&lt;/ref&gt;

Having attacked the regent [[Espartero]], he was exiled. On his return, he founded and edited ''El Pensamiento de la Nación'', a [[Catholic]] and conservative weekly; however, his fame rests principally on ''El Protestantismo comparado con el Catolicismo en sus relaciones con la Civilización Europea'' (Protestantism and Catholicity compared in their Effects on the Civilization of Europe),&lt;ref&gt;3 vols., 1842–1844, 6th edition, 1879; English translation in 1849 and also in 1856 by [[Charles Ignatius White]].&lt;/ref&gt; an able defence of [[Catholic]]ism on the ground that it represents the spirit of obedience or order, as opposed to [[Protestant]]ism, the spirit of revolt or [[Anarchism|anarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Balmès, Jaime Luciano|volume=3|page=284}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is often cited as a counter argument to historical accounts that focus on the reputed central role of the [[Protestant]] thought to the development of modern society.

According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]:{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
:The best of his philosophical works, which are clear expositions of the scholastic system of thought, are the ''Filosofia Fundamental'' (Basic Philosophy),&lt;ref&gt;4 vols., 1846, Eng. trans. by H. F. Brownson, 2 vols. New York, 1856.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Curso de Filosofia Elemental'' (A Course of Elementary Philosophy),&lt;ref&gt;4 vols., 1847&lt;/ref&gt; which he translated into [[Latin]] for use in seminaries.

== Thought ==
Generally the philosophy of Balmes is understood merely as "philosophy of common sense", when in reality it is something much more complex. Both in '' Fundamental Philosophy '' and in '' Elementary Philosophy '' (being this second work more informative) is the subject of certainty.

Balmes divides the truth into three irreducible classes, although we speak of it as if it were only one. These are the subjective truths, the rational truths and the objective truths. The first type of truth, the subjective one, can be understood as a present reality for the subject, which is real but depends on the perception of the speaker. For example, affirming that one is cold or that one is thirsty are subjective truths. The second type, the rational one, is logical and mathematical truth, using any operation of this type as an example. Finally, the objective truth is understood as that which, although perceived by all, does not fall within the category of rational truth: to affirm that the sky is blue, or that there are trees in the forest.

The three types of truth are irreducible, and the methods of recruitment differ from one to the other. Therefore, it is necessary that the philosophy first of all consider what kind of truth we are looking for.

For Balmes there is no possibility of doubting everything: making such statement, we forget that there are a series of rules of thought that we admit as truths in order to be able to doubt. In a similar way to that posed by [[St Augustine of Hippo|St Augustine]] or [[René Descartes|Descartes]], to affirm that we doubt necessarily implies the certainty that we are doubting. In this way, doubt is also a certainty. An authentic radical skeptic is impossible, because there is no universal doubt.

Certainty is natural and intuitive like doubt, and prior to philosophy. Thus, the common and natural certainty also encompasses the Cartesian philosophical certainty. To reach this certainty, the so-called "criteria" are necessary, the means by which we can access the truth. There are a lot of criteria for having, also, several types of truths. However, Balmes prefers to distribute them in three: the criteria of conscience, those of evidence and those of common sense. These are the criteria for accessing the three types of truth. To define the corpus of Balmes's thought as "philosophy of common sense" is not so much due to his conception of common sense as inherent in philosophical work, but especially because of his definition of this sense as a criterion for reaching a certainty. At this point, it is worth noting the relationship of subjective truths with criteria of conscience, rational truths with those of evidence and finally, objective truths accessible through the criterion of so-called "common sense".

Therefore, Balmes argues that metaphysics should not be sustained only on one column, but on three that correspond to the three truths: thus, the principle of Cartesian consciousness, the '' [[cogito ergo sum]] '' is a truth subjective, while the [[principle of non-contradiction]] Aristotelian is truly rational. Finally, common sense, the intellectual instinct (perhaps it is "intellectual instinct" a more specific term than "common sense") presents the so-called objective truth. It is impossible to find a truth common to the three principles.

In this way, Balmes denies the exclusivity of the theories of philosophers: philosophy is the fullness of natural knowledge, and is rooted in being a man. To affirm, for example, that the "cogito" is the foundation of truth and philosophy is not in itself a wrong assertion, because it is true what it affirms, but false what it denies, because besides the "cogito" There are other possibilities of foundation. Balmes does not reduce this idea only to the field of philosophy, and extends it also to general human thought.

In this way, the fundamental thesis of Balmes is that there is no formula from which the universe can be detached. There is no truth from which all others arise. At this point, the three criteria can be defined more thoroughly.

=== Consciousness ===
Consciousness is what you notice on the inside, what you think and experience. Sensations would be useless if they were not experienced in consciousness. This criterion has several characteristics: the first is the subjective nature of consciousness, that is, our perception is that of the phenomenon, not that of reality, although for Balmes, subjectivity does not imply that the certainty achieved is not true. It also has the function of pointing or presenting. Consciousness does not put us in contact with external reality, nor with others (we can not perceive – yes suppose – the existence of consciousness in others), but it presents facts, it is an absolute that dispenses with relationships. Consciousness has no objectivity or light, it is pure presence.

When the language expresses the conscience, it betrays it, because something personal can not be expressed through something universal. Language is incapable of expressing pure consciousness, something that art can do, for example. Likewise, consciousness can not be wrong either, because we are not mistaken about the experience of it, although it can be fallible when it leaves its ground to go outside. There is no error in the internal phenomenon, but perhaps in its correspondence with the outside. Balmes, against the Cartesian animaina machina, defends that the animals also have conscience, but in his case it is reduced to the sensation, and not to the intellectualization of it. Thus, they possess only a direct consciousness, while humans -for our intellective capacity- also possess reflex consciousness, which is the capacity to reflect on the sensations of direct consciousness.

For Balmes, consciousness is the foundation of the other criteria, and all are necessarily born of it.

=== Evidence ===
Unlike consciousness, the evidence is not singular and contingent. The evidence has universality and a logical necessity. Balmes divides between two types of evidence, the immediate and the mediate: the first does not require proof, it is a priori knowledge, such as knowing that every object is equal to itself. On the other hand, mediate evidence requires demonstration.

The evidence does not capture a fact, but captures its relationships. It is captured that the idea of the predicate is in the subject (similar to the analytical judgment of [[Kant]]). All evidence is based on the principle of non-contradiction, and is reduced to the analytical. Forget the synthetic judgments that are not exclusively rational, do not consider that the criterion of evidence is accompanied by the senses. Therefore, for Balmes the analysis of consciousness is better than the analysis of evidence.

=== Intellectual instinct ===
The intellectual instinct gives us the correspondence between the idea and reality, it is not an animal instinct, but a rational instinct. Through this instinct we know that what we see exists, or at least that there is a representation of what we see. These kinds of truths are by definition broader than the intellectual truths of the evidence. The same truth can also be had by means of an intellectual rather than an instinct: to give an example, it can be known whether a business works or not through an economic study or through an intuition of common sense. Thus, in the common sense there is the unconscious -like the moral truths, or the sensations- or that which through the intellectual instinct we see as evident, for example the scientific truths. It is also through this instinct that we know demonstrable truths without having to prove them, or we consider truth as probability, that is, the awareness of contingency: to give an example, to be aware of the possibilities we have to win the lottery, or to achieve write something coherent by moving the pen randomly on the paper.

For Balmes, these are the three pillars of metaphysics. To better define this, there is an analysis of the '' [[cogito ergo sum]] '' Cartesian, according to which the affirmation of the "I think, therefore I exist" Cartesian is in principle a truth of conscience, later transformed into an intellectual truth of evidence, a logical syllogism whose reality is understood through intuition. Having founded the '' cogito '' on something intellectual, [[Descartes]] falls into the risk of reducing the '' cogito '' to something logical and intellectual. For this reason, for Balmes consciousness is the fundamental pillar of metaphysics, but for him transcends the "cogito" the clear and distinct Cartesian idea: consciousness is the pillar because it is where experience is lived and given sense.

'''Józef Kalasanty Szaniawski''' (1764 in [[Kalwaria Zebrzydowska]] – 16 May 1843 in [[Lwów]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[philosopher]] and [[politician]].

==Life==
During the [[Kościuszko Uprising]] (1794) Szaniawski was a [[Polish Jacobins|Polish Jacobin]]. After the suppression of the uprising, he emigrated to [[Paris]], where he was a member of the "Polish Deputation" (''Deputacja Polska''),&lt;ref&gt;"Szaniawski, Józef Kalasanty," ''Encyklopedia Powszechna PWN'' (PWN Universal Encyclopedia), vol. 4, p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; an independence organization that arose in Paris in 1795 (remaining active till 1796) and grouped representatives of the Polish émigré radical wing. The Polish Deputation hoped to bring about an armed uprising and social revolution in occupied Poland with the support of [[French Revolution|revolutionary France]].&lt;ref&gt;"Deputacja Polska," ''Encyklopedia Powszechna PWN'' (PWN Universal Encyclopedia), vol. 1, p. 581.&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish Deputation thereby came into conflict with the moderate [[Kościuszko Uprising|Kościuszko-Uprising]] émigré activists of the "Agency" (''Agencja''), founded in Paris in 1794, which opposed armed action in Poland, counting instead on France's diplomatic and military aid, and supporting [[Jan Henryk Dąbrowski|Henryk Dąbrowski]]'s [[Polish Legions (Napoleonic period)|Polish Legions]].&lt;ref&gt;"Agencja," ''Encyklopedia Powszechna PWN'' (PWN Universal Encyclopedia), vol. 1, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

On returning to [[Warsaw]] during the [[Prussia]]n occupation, Szaniawski co-edited ''Gazeta Warszawska'' (The Warsaw Gazette) and initiated "''Korespondencja w materiach obraz kraju i narodu polskiego rozjaśniających''" ("Correspondence on Matters Elucidating the Picture of Poland and the Polish People"). He became secretary of the [[Society of Friends of Learning]] and president of the [[Society for Elementary Textbooks]], and headed the [[censorship]].&lt;ref&gt;"Szaniawski, Józef Kalasanty," ''Encyklopedia Powszechna PWN'' (PWN Universal Encyclopedia), vol. 4, p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; A former student of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s in [[Königsberg]], he waged a campaign in favor of [[Kantism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], "Outline of the History of Philosophy in Poland," p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1802 to 1808 Szaniawski published his philosophical works in rapid succession. He expounded Kant's philosophy, but with a special purpose—to turn people's minds toward learning; and, in learning, to break with [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophy, which he condemned for dogmatic unbelief and morally damaging [[hedonism]]. He was the first to lead the campaign against the Enlightenment in Poland. He became an apostle of German philosophy and was the first to introduce it into Poland.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], "Outline of the History of Philosophy in Poland," p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Szaniawski especially urged the study of Kant; but, having accepted the fundamental points of the critical theory of knowledge, he still hesitated between Kant's metaphysical agnosticism and the new metaphysics of [[Idealism]]. He owed a particular debt to [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]]. Thus this one man introduced to Poland both the anti-metaphysical Kant and the post-Kantian metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], "Outline of the History of Philosophy in Poland," pp. 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

He introduced them, but later disavowed them. He had entered the [[civil service]] and rose quickly to high station, becoming [[attorney general]] of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] (1807–15), then secretary of the Provisional Government, then ''referendary'' of state under the [[Congress Poland]]. And a curious change came over him: not only did he lose interest in philosophy, but now he sought to restrain its development. When toward the end of his life, in 1842, he spoke about philosophy, it was only to represent all its theories as a pack of errors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], "Outline of the History of Philosophy in Poland," p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kanada''' ([[Sanskrit]]: कणाद, [[IAST]]: 'Kaṇāda), also known as '''Kashyapa''', '''Uluka''', '''Kananda''' and '''Kanabhuk''',{{Sfn|Sharma|2000|p=175}}{{Sfn|Riepe|1961|p=228 with footnote 12}} was an ancient [[India]]n natural scientist and philosopher who founded the [[Vaisheshika]] school of [[Indian philosophy]].{{Sfn| Bart Labuschagne| Timo Slootweg|2012|p=60, Quote: "Kanada, a Hindu sage who lived either around the 6th or 2nd century BCE, and who founded the philosophical school of Vaisheshika.}}{{Sfn|Jeaneane D. Fowler|2002|pp=98-99}}

Estimated to have lived sometime between 6th century to 2nd century BCE, little is known about his life.{{Sfn|Jeaneane D.

Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415173629}}, page 269&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J Ganeri (2012), The Self: Naturalism, Consciousness, and the First-Person Stance, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199652365}}&lt;/ref&gt; His traditional name "Kanada" means "atom eater",{{Sfn|Jeaneane D. Fowler|2002|p=99}} and he is known for developing the foundations of an atomistic naturalism Indian philosophy in the Sanskrit text ''[[Vaisheshika Sutra]]''.{{Sfn|Riepe|1961| pp=227-229}}&lt;ref name="Sinha"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/thevaiasesikasut00kanauoft/thevaiasesikasut00kanauoft_djvu.txt "The Vaisesika sutras of Kanada. Translated by Nandalal Sinha"] Full Text at archive.org&lt;/ref&gt; His text is also known as ''Kanada Sutras'', or Aphorisms of Kanada.{{Sfn|Riepe|1961|p=229}}&lt;ref name="Kak"&gt;Kak, S. 'Matter and Mind: The Vaisheshika Sutra of Kanada' (2016), Mount Meru Publishing, Mississauga, Ontario, {{ISBN|978-1-988207-13-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The school founded by Kanada attempted to explain the creation and existence of the universe by proposing an atomistic theory, applying logic and realism, and is among one of the earliest known systematic realist [[ontology]] in human history.{{Sfn|Jeaneane D. Fowler|2002|p=98}} Kanada suggested that everything can be subdivided, but this subdivision cannot go on forever, and there must be smallest entities (''parmanu'') that cannot be divided, that are eternal, that aggregate in different ways to yield complex substances and bodies with unique identity, a process that involves heat, and this is the basis for all material existence.{{Sfn|H. Margenau|2012|p=xxx-xxxi}}{{Sfn|Jeaneane D. Fowler|2002|pp=100-102}} He used these ideas with the concept of [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (soul, Self) to develop a non-theistic means to [[moksha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James G. Lochtefeld|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: N-Z|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g6FsB3psOTIC |year=2002|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-3180-4|pages=729–731}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Sharma|2000|p=177-186}} Kanada's ideas were influential on other schools of Hinduism, and over its history became closely associated with the [[Nyaya]] school of Hindu philosophy.{{Sfn|Jeaneane D. Fowler|2002|p=98}}

Kanada's system speaks of six properties ([[padārtha]]s) that are nameable and knowable. He claims that these are sufficient to describe everything in the universe, including observers. These six categories are dravya (substance), guna (quality), karman (motion), samanya (universal), visesa (particular), and samavaya (inherence). There are nine classes of substances (dravya), some of which are atomic, some non-atomic, and others that are all-pervasive.

Kanada was influential in Indian philosophies, and he appears in various texts by alternate names such as Kashyapa, Uluka, Kananda, Kanabhuk among others.{{Sfn|Sharma|2000|p=175}}{{Sfn|Riepe|1961|p=228 with footnote 12}} In [[Jainism]] literature, he is affectionately referred to as ''Sad-uluka'', which means "the Uluka who propounded the doctrine of six categories".{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|p=54}} His Vaisheshika philosophy similarly appears with alternate names, such as "Aulukya philosophy" derived from the nickname Uluka (literally owl, or grain eater in the night).{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|p=54}}{{refn|group=note|A legend in the Hindu tradition states that ascetic scholar Kanada would spend all day in his studies and in meditation, eat only once every night like an owl.{{Sfn|Jeaneane D. Fowler|2002|p=99}}}}

The ideas of Kanada span a wide range of fields, and they influenced not only philosophy, but possibly scholars in other fields such as Charaka who wrote a medical text that has survived as ''[[Charaka Samhita]]''.{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|pp=55-56}}

==Date==
The century in which Kanada lived is unclear and have been a subject of a long debate.{{Sfn|Jeaneane D. Fowler|2002|p=98}} In his review of 1961, Riepe states Kanada lived sometime before 300 CE, but convincing evidence to firmly put him in a certain century remains elusive.{{Sfn|Riepe|1961|pp=228-229}}

The ''Vaisheshika Sutras'' mention competing schools of Indian philosophy such as Samkhya and Mimamsa,{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|p=54}} but make no mention of Buddhism, which has led scholars in more recent publications to posit estimates of 6th to 2nd century BCE.{{Sfn| Bart Labuschagne| Timo Slootweg|2012|p=60, Quote: "Kanada, a Hindu sage who lived either around the 6th or 2nd century BCE, and who founded the philosophical school of Vaisheshika.}}{{Sfn|Jeaneane D.

Kanada and early Vaisheshika scholars were non-theistic.&lt;ref name="SiemensRoodt2008"/&gt; However, this was not unusual for his times since several major early versions of Hindu philosophies such as Samkhya, Nyaya, Mimamsa along with sub-schools of Yoga and Vedanta, as well as non-Vedic schools such as Jainism and Buddhism, were similarly non-theistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Surendranath Dasgupta|title= A History of Indian Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PoaMFmS1_lEC |year=1992|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0412-8 |pages=281–285 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roy W.

===Observations and theories===
In the fifth chapter of Vaisheshika Sutra, Kanada mentions various empirical observations and natural phenomena such as the falling of objects to ground, rising of fire and heat upwards, the growth of grass upwards, the nature of rainfall and thunderstorms, the flow of liquids, the movement towards a magnet among many others, asks why these things happen, then attempts to integrate his observations with his theories on atoms, molecules and their interaction. He classifies observed events into two: those caused by volition, and those caused by subject-object conjunctions.{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|p=57}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/thevaiasesikasut00kanauoft#page/296/mode/2up The Vaisesika Sutras of Kanada], pp. 152-166, Translated by Nandalal Sinha (note this translation is of the old disputed manuscript, not critical edition)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wells&gt;John Wells (2009), [http://darshanapress.com/The%20Vaisheshika%20Darshana.pdf The Vaisheshika Darshana], Darshana Press, Chapter 5 verses (main and appendix), critical edition&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box

[[Dharma]] is that through which there is the accomplishment of rising to the unsurpassed good. Because it is an exposition of that, it has the authority of [[Veda]]. – ''Vaisheshika Sutras 1.1-2''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(...) That there is only one individual (soul) is known from the absence of particularity when it comes to the emergence of understanding of happiness and suffering, (whereas) a multiplicity of individuals is inferred from their perseverance in dharma, and from the strength of their teaching. – ''Vaisheshika Sutras 3.16-18''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The true being is eternal, having no cause. Its indicator is its effect. The presence of the effect arises from the presence of its cause. – ''Vaisheshika Sutras 4.1-3''

Kanada came up with the idea that ''paramanu'' ([[atom]]) was an indestructible particle of matter. The atom is indivisible because it is a state at which no measurement can be attributed. He used invariance arguments to determine properties of the atoms. He also stated that ''anu'' can have two states — absolute rest and a state of motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ece.lsu.edu/kak/roopa51.pdf|title=Space, Time and Anu in Vaisheshika|author=Roopa Narayan|date= |work= |publisher= Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, USA|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adherents of the school of philosophy founded by Kanada considered the [[atom]] to be indestructible, and hence eternal. They believed atoms to be minute objects invisible to the naked eye which come into being and vanish in an instant. Vaiseshikas further held that atoms of same substance combined with each other to produce dvyanuka ([[diatomic molecule]]s) and tryanuka ([[triatomic molecule]]s). Kanada also put forward the idea that atoms could be combined in various ways to produce chemical changes in presence of other factors such as heat. He gave blackening of earthen pot and ripening of fruit as examples of this phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Kapoor"&gt;Kapoor, Subodh. The Indian Encyclopaedia, Volume 1. Cosmo Publications. P. 5643. {{ISBN|8177552570}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanada postulated four different kinds of atoms: two with mass, and two without.&lt;ref name="Kak"/&gt; Each substance is supposed to consist of all the four atoms.

Kanada's conception of the [[atom]] was likely independent from the similar concept among the ancient Greeks, because of the differences between the theories.&lt;ref name=edwardcraig199/&gt; For example, Kanada suggested that atoms as building blocks differ both qualitatively and quantitatively, while Greeks suggested that atoms differed only quantitatively but not qualitatively.&lt;ref name=edwardcraig199&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Craig|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Index|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8FWa85vgoTQC |year=1998|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-18715-2|pages=198–199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5400">'''KWIC''' is an acronym for '''Key Word In Context''', the most common format for [[concordance (publishing)|concordance]] lines. The term KWIC was first coined by [[Hans Peter Luhn]].&lt;ref&gt;Manning, C. D., Schütze, H.: "Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing", p.35. The MIT Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The system was based on a concept called ''keyword in titles'' which was first proposed for Manchester libraries in 1864 by [[Andrea Crestadoro]].&lt;ref name="index"&gt;{{cite book|title=Advanced Indexing and Abstracting Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIUkl7bLzYUC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=Andrea+Crestadoro#v=onepage&amp;q=Andrea%20Crestadoro&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''KWIC''' index is formed by sorting and aligning the words within an article title to allow each word (except the [[stop words]]) in titles to be searchable alphabetically in the index.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.janda.org/workshop/content%20analysis/kwic.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It was a useful indexing method for technical manuals before computerized [[full text search]] became common.

For example, a search query including all of the words in the title statement of this article ("KWIC is an acronym for Key Word In Context, the most common format for concordance lines") and the [[Wikipedia:Slogans|Wikipedia slogan]] in English ("the free encyclopedia"), searched against this very web page, might yield a KWIC index as follows. A KWIC index usually uses a wide layout to allow the display of maximum 'in context' information (not shown in the following example).

A KWIC index is a special case of a ''permuted index''.&lt;ref&gt;http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/lang/python/examples/kwic/web/theory.html&lt;/ref&gt; This term refers to the fact that it indexes all [[cyclic permutation]]s of the headings. Books composed of many short sections with their own descriptive headings, most notably collections of [[Manual page (Unix)|manual pages]], often ended with a '''permuted index''' section, allowing the reader to easily find a section by any word from its heading. This practice, also known as '''KWOC''' (“'''Key Word Out of Context'''”), is no longer common.

This format is extremely useful in that the keyword is easily identified together with its context. ... The Concordance of the Roman Missal is produced in both the KWIC and KWICn formats and is noteworthy in that each word form is listed as it appears in the text, that is, it is un-lemmatized."

'''Lakshana''' ({{lang-sa|लक्षण}} ''{{transl|sa|lakṣaṇa}}'') – derived from the combination of words ''lakshya'' and ''kshana'' – means 'indication' or 'symptom'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url=http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+lakshana&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also means 'an auspicious mark', 'attribute' or 'quality'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Courts of Pre-colonial South India|author=Jennifer Howes|publisher=Psychology Press|page=231|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aex_vpsu3gwC&amp;pg=PA231&amp;dq=Lakshana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CdThUsLJIYuu7AbS3YD4Bw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Lakshana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Tamil language, Lakshanam means "features". Sulakshana means good features.

==Grammatical implication==

In [[Varadarāja]]'s ''Laghukaumudi'' (St.210), on the following ''Paniniya Sukta'' I.i.62 on [[Sanskrit grammar]], which reads:

:प्रत्ययलोपे प्रत्ययलक्षणम् |

states that when [[elision]] (''lopa'') of an [[affix]] has taken place, the affix shall still exert its influence, and the operations dependent upon it will take place as if it were present. He explains that the word, ''Lakshana'', signifies that by which a thing is recognized, and the word, ''Lopa'' signifies the elision i.e. substitution of a blank, in which regard Sakalya had suggested certain optional substitutions as stated in Sukta VIII.iii.19. Vardaraja draws attention to Panini’s statement referred to at St.152 to the effect  that after whatsoever there is an affix (pratyaya) enjoined, let what begins therewith, in the form in which it appears when the affix follows it, be called an inflective base (anga) e.g. in the case of addressing two or more persons of the same name, say - Rama, the Ramas need not be addressed as ''Oh two Ramas'' but the '' -s'' is to be dropped without change in meaning (intention) and addressed as ''Oh Rama'' which would suffice the intended purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Laghukaumudi of Vardaraja|author=Vardaraja|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=15, 47, 65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NFm2t-GoUNgC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=anga+lakshana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_SjiUsXbCciN7QbMl4DIDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=anga%20lakshana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious and ethical implication==

''Vyasa-bhashya'' (VIII.13) explains that in the smallest particle of time or ''kshana'' the whole universe undergoes a change. Each moment or particle of time is only the manifestation of that change, and time does not have a separate existence. Appearance is called [[Dharma]], and the arrangement of objects or qualities is called ''Dharmin''; the change of appearance is called ''Dharma-parinama'' which has two aspects – ''Lakshana-parinama'' and ''Avastha-parinama'', which are not intrinsically different. ''Lakshana-parinama'' considers three stages of an appearance viz. a) the unmanifested when it exists in the future, b) the manifested moment of the present and c) the past when it has been manifested, lost to view but preserved and retained in all the onwards stages of evolution. ''Avastha-parinama'' is change of condition which is not materially different from ''Lakshana-parinama'' and hence its mode; it is on account of this that an object is called new or old, grown or decayed. It is the nature of the [[Guṇa]]s that there cannot remain even a moment without the evolutionary changes of ''dharma'', ''lakshana'' and ''avastha'', for movement is the characteristic of the ''gunas'' whose nature is the cause of constant movement, which changes the mind also experiences in accordance with its two qualities visible and invisible; the visible qualities are those whose changes can be noticed as conscious states or thought-products or precepts, whereas the invisible qualities are those whose changes can only be established by inference. There is an order in all successive changes ([[Vācaspati Miśra|Vacaspati]] in his ''Tattva–vaivasaradi'' (III.15).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yoga as Philosophy and Religion|author=Surendranath Dasgupta|publisher=Routledge|pages=71–75|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yXFHAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=Lakshana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tdThUtXEHomp7QaLx4CwDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Lakshana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dharma, which provides security, peace and well-being, is concerned equally to the individual and his other worldly interests and to the worldly interest of the individual, family and society. Dharma embraces man’s life as a whole. The two goals of man’s individual and collective existence signified by the words ''abhyudaya'' ('prosperity') and ''nihsreyasa'' ('necessaries') are attained by following a two-fold dharma – 1) ''Pravritti Lakshana Dharma'' ('religion of action') that is characterized by action and 2) ''Nivritti Lakshana Dharma'' ('religion of renunciation') which is characterized by freedom from action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hinduism and Secularism: A Critical Study|author=R.S.Mishra|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=69–70|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9fMBv6cvn94C&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=Lakshana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tdThUtXEHomp7QaLx4CwDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Lakshana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical implication==

[[Advaita Vedanta]] refers to the three meanings that all words and sentences carry – the primary or direct meaning, the implied meaning and the suggested meaning. The implied meaning, known as ''Lakshana'', is of three kinds – ''Jahallakshana'' which consists in discarding the direct meaning in favour of the indirect or implied meaning, ''Ajahallakshana'' in which the direct meaning is not completely given up and the real meaning is hinted, and ''Jahadjahallakshana'' which consists in giving up a part of the direct meaning and retaining the other part. Thus, the word "That" of the [[Mahavakyas|mahavakya]] – [[Tat Tvam Asi|tat tvam asi]] primarily refers to the [[Saguna Brahman]] or [[Ishvara]], and the word "Thou" primarily to the [[Jiva]], the individual soul. The direct sense points to the identity of between [[Ishvara]] and [[Jiva]]. The implied meaning reveals that Ishvara and Jiva are the result of ignorance and the imposition of the unreal on the real when "That" refers to the [[Nirguna Brahman]], the pure consciousness who is absolute and without attributes and "Thou" refers to self or [[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]], the pure consciousness which is the reality underlying the mind-body complex. It is according to the third ''Lakshana'' that the identity of Brahman and Atman is established, that these two words in their implicit sense point to the same reality, that ''Brahma-anubhava'' is the non-dual experience of the sole reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Authentic Human Destiny: The Paths Of Shankara Heidegger|author=Vensus A.George|publisher=CRVP|pages=55–59|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kO8-980xGk8C&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=Lakshana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tdThUtXEHomp7QaLx4CwDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Lakshana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The student of [[Indian classical music|classical music]] – after faithfully evaluating the effect of listening and observation as aids for [[Sādhanā|sadhana]] – strives to study the role of acquiring ''Lakshana Jnanam'' ('theoretical knowledge') as an aid to ''Lakshya Sadhana'' ('practical attainment') in order to uplift knowledge of music gained and realizing its practical utilities/applications. Mere theoretical knowledge, the ''arohana'' and ''avarohana'' of a [[raga]] is not ''Lakshana Jnanam'', for the body is first formed and only thereafter infused with life. Lakshya (target or aim to be accomplished) is based on ''[[Kalpana (imagination)|Kalpana]]'' ('imagination','inspiration') and ''Lakshana'' is like [[grammar]], the former is not clear without the latter. The knowledge of ''Lakshana'' is essential for ''Lakshya sadhana''.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Prognostic implication==

In matters pertaining to the prediction of future events, the word, ''Lakshana'', means a mark or an [[omen]]. In this system, eight different methods are employed:
* ''Anga'' ('Limbs') (''Anga [[Shastra]]''), which takes into account different parts of the body, 
* ''Svapna'' ('Dream'), by which ones press dreams,  
* ''Swar'' ('Sound') attaches importance to utterances by birds and animals,  
* ''Bhomi'' ('Attitude') refers to one’s behaviour, walk, posture etc.;  
* ''Vyanjana'' ('Birth-marks') refers to [[birthmarks]] such as moles, spots etc.;  
* ''Lakshana'' ('Omen'),  
* ''Utpath'' ('Catastrophe') refers to phenomena such as earth-quake, volcanic eruption etc.; and  
*  ''Antariksha'' ('Heavenly'), on the appearance of comets, circle round the Moon, etc. 
According to [[numerology]], numbers pregnant with more than one meaning and significance, indicate the course of future events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Miracles of Numerology|author=M.Katakkar|publisher=Jaico Publishing House|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YMczNcCnDcIC&amp;pg=PP34&amp;dq=anga+lakshana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_SjiUsXbCciN7QbMl4DIDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=anga%20lakshana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Anga Ranga'', a very ancient method, women are divided into four distinct classes of temperament that correspond to the four phases of liberation (''[[moksa]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Prenatal Kriya yoga|author=Camell Nair Ryt|publisher=AuthorHouse|page=xxviii|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=NUVPvA5oUX8C&amp;pg=PR28&amp;dq=Anga+Ranga&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lU7iUvriINDb7AaprID4CQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Anga%20Ranga&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[music]], the '''lament bass''' is a [[ostinato#Ground bass|ground bass]], built from a descending [[perfect fourth]] from [[tonic (music)|tonic]] to [[dominant (music)|dominant]], with each step [[harmony|harmonized]].&lt;ref name="B-L"&gt;Brover-Lubovsky, Bella (2008). ''Tonal Space in the Music of Antonio Vivaldi'', p.151-52. {{ISBN|978-0-253-35129-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[diatonic and chromatic|diatonic]] version is the upper [[tetrachord]] from the [[Aeolian mode|natural minor scale]],&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Mark R. (2010). ''A Chord in Time: The Evolution of the Augmented Sixth from Monteverdi to Mahler'', p.200. {{ISBN|978-0-7546-6385-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; known as the [[descending tetrachord|Phrygian tetrachord]], while the chromatic version, the [[chromatic fourth]], has all [[semitone]]s filled in. It is often used in music to denote [[tragedy]] or [[sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]].&lt;ref&gt;Brover-Lubovsky (2008), p.153. "In the eighteenth century...the lament bass almost automatically invoked somber affection, gravity, and oppressiveness."&lt;/ref&gt;

However, "A common misperception exists that the 'lament bass' of [[Italian opera|Venetian opera]] became so prevalent that it immediately swept away all other possible affective associations with this bass pattern...To cite but one example, Peter Holman, writing about [[Henry Purcell]], once characterized the minor tetrachord as 'the descending ground that was associated with love in seventeenth-century opera'."&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Shirley (2010). ''New Perspectives on Marc-Antoine Charpentier'', p.64. {{ISBN|978-0-7546-6579-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compositional form==
There exists a short, free musical form of the [[Romantic music|Romantic Era]], called '''complaint''' or "complainte" (Fr.) or lament.&lt;ref name="Dupre, Marcel 1937 p. 14"&gt;Dupre, Marcel (1937). ''Cours Complet d'Improvisation a l'Orgue: Exercices Preparees'', v. 1, p. 14, trans. John Fenstermaker. Paris: Alphonse Leduc.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is typically a set of harmonic [[Variation (music)|variations]] in [[Homophony|homophonic]] texture, wherein the bass descends through some tetrachord, possibly that of the previous paragraph, but usually one suggesting a [[Minor scale|minor mode]].  This tetrachord, treated as a very short [[ground bass]], is repeated again and again over the length of the composition.

This is a list of [[Rule of inference|rules of inference]], logical laws that relate to mathematical formulae.

==Introduction==

'''Rules of inference''' are syntactical '''transform''' rules which one can use to infer a conclusion from a premise to create an argument.  A set of rules can be used to infer any valid conclusion if it is complete, while never inferring an invalid conclusion, if it is sound. A sound and complete set of rules need not include every rule in the following list, as many of the rules are redundant, and can be proven with the other rules.

''Discharge rules'' permit inference from a subderivation based on a temporary assumption.  Below, the notation

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi \vdash \psi&lt;/math&gt;

indicates such a subderivation from the temporary assumption &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;.

==Rules for classical sentential calculus==
Sentential calculus is also known as [[propositional calculus]].

===Rules for negations===
;[[Reductio ad absurdum]] (or ''Negation Introduction''):
: &lt;math&gt;\varphi \vdash \psi&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\varphi \vdash \lnot \psi}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\lnot \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

;Reductio ad absurdum (related to the law of [[Law of excluded middle|excluded middle]]):
: &lt;math&gt;\lnot \varphi \vdash \psi&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\lnot \varphi \vdash \lnot \psi}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;

;[[Law of noncontradiction|Noncontradiction]] (or ''Negation Elimination''):
: &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\lnot \varphi}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;

;[[Double negative elimination|Double negation elimination]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\varphi \quad \quad \quad}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;

;[[Modus tollens]]:
: &lt;math&gt;\varphi \rightarrow \psi&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\lnot \psi \quad \quad \quad}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\lnot \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

===Rules for conjunctions===
;[[Conjunction introduction|Adjunction]] (or ''Conjunction Introduction''):

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\psi \quad \quad \ \ }&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\varphi \land \psi&lt;/math&gt;

;[[Simplification (logic)|Simplification]] (or ''Conjunction Elimination''):

: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\varphi \land \psi}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\varphi \land \psi}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;

===Rules for disjunctions===
;[[Disjunction introduction|Addition]] (or ''Disjunction Introduction''):
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\varphi \quad \quad \ \ }&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\varphi \lor \psi&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\psi \quad \quad \ \ }&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\varphi \lor \psi&lt;/math&gt;

;[[Disjunction elimination|Case analysis]] (or ''Proof by Cases'' or ''Argument by Cases'')
: &lt;math&gt;\varphi \rightarrow \chi&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\psi \rightarrow \chi&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\varphi \lor \psi}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;

;[[Disjunctive syllogism]]:
: &lt;math&gt;\varphi \lor \psi&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\lnot \varphi \quad \quad}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi \lor \psi&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\psi \rightarrow \xi&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\varphi \lor \psi}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\chi \lor \xi &lt;/math&gt;

===Rules for biconditionals===

;[[Biconditional introduction]]:
: &lt;math&gt;\varphi \rightarrow \psi&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\psi \rightarrow \varphi}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\varphi \leftrightarrow \psi&lt;/math&gt;

;Biconditional Elimination:
: &lt;math&gt;\varphi \leftrightarrow \psi&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\varphi \quad \quad}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi \leftrightarrow \psi&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\psi \quad \quad}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi \leftrightarrow \psi&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\lnot \varphi \quad \quad}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\lnot \psi&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi \leftrightarrow \psi&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\lnot \psi \quad \quad}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\lnot \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi \leftrightarrow \psi&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\psi \lor \varphi}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\psi \land \varphi &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi \leftrightarrow \psi&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\lnot \psi \lor \lnot \varphi}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\lnot \psi \land \lnot \varphi &lt;/math&gt;

==Rules of classical [[First-order logic|predicate calculus]]==

In the following rules, &lt;math&gt;\varphi(\beta / \alpha)&lt;/math&gt; is exactly like &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; except for having the term &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; everywhere &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; has the free variable &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

;[[Universal generalization|Universal Generalization]] (or [[Universal generalization|Universal Introduction]]):
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\varphi{(\beta / \alpha)}}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha\, \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

Restriction 1:  &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is a variable which does not occur in &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;br/&gt;
Restriction 2:  &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is not mentioned in any hypothesis or undischarged assumptions.

;[[Universal instantiation|Universal Instantiation]] (or [[Universal instantiation|Universal Elimination]]):
: &lt;math&gt; \forall \alpha\, \varphi&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\overline{\varphi{(\beta / \alpha)}}&lt;/math&gt;

Restriction:  No free occurrence of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; falls within the scope of a quantifier quantifying a variable occurring in &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;.

;[[Existential generalization|Existential Generalization]] (or [[Existential generalization|Existential Introduction]]):
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\varphi(\beta / \alpha)}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\exists \alpha\, \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

Restriction:  No free occurrence of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; falls within the scope of a quantifier quantifying a variable occurring in &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;.
 
;[[Existential instantiation|Existential Instantiation]] (or [[Existential instantiation|Existential Elimination]]):
: &lt;math&gt;\exists \alpha\, \varphi&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\varphi(\beta / \alpha) \vdash \psi}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;

Restriction 1:  &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is a variable which does not occur in &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;br/&gt;
Restriction 2:  There is no occurrence, free or bound, of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;br/&gt;
Restriction 3:  &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is not mentioned in any hypothesis or undischarged assumptions.

==Rules of [[substructural logic]]==
The following are special cases of universal generalization and existential elimination; these occur in substructrual logics, such as [[linear logic]].
 
;Rule of weakening (or [[monotonicity of entailment]]) (aka [[no-cloning theorem]])

: &lt;math&gt;\alpha\vdash\beta&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\overline{\alpha,\alpha\vdash\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

;Rule of contraction (or [[idempotency of entailment]]) (aka [[no-deleting theorem]])

: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\alpha,\alpha,\gamma\vdash\beta}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\alpha,\gamma\vdash\beta&lt;/math&gt;

==Table: Rules of Inference==
The rules above can be summed up in the following table.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth H. Rosen: ''Discrete Mathematics and its Applications'', Fifth Edition, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[Tautology (logic)|Tautology]]" column shows how to interpret the notation of a given rule.

All rules use the basic logic operators. A complete table of "logic operators" is shown by a [[truth table]], giving definitions of all the possible (16) truth functions of 2 [[Boolean algebra|boolean variables]] (''p'', ''q''):

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto 1em auto; text-align:center;"
|-
! ''p'' || ''q''
|
! &amp;nbsp;0&amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;  || &amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;

where T = true and F = false, and, the columns are the logical operators: '''0''', false, [[Contradiction]]; '''1''', NOR, [[Logical NOR]]; '''2''', [[Converse nonimplication]]; '''3''', '''¬p''', [[Negation]]; '''4''', [[Material nonimplication]]; '''5''', '''¬q''', Negation; '''6''', XOR, [[Exclusive disjunction]]; '''7''', NAND, [[Logical NAND]]; '''8''', AND, [[Logical conjunction]]; '''9''', XNOR, [[If and only if]], [[Logical biconditional]]; '''10''', '''q''', [[Projection function]]; '''11''', if/then, [[Material conditional|Logical implication]]; '''12''', '''p''', Projection function;  '''13''', then/if, [[Converse implication]]; '''14''', OR, [[Logical disjunction]]; '''15''', true, [[Tautology (logic)|Tautology]].

Each logic operator can be used in an assertion about variables and operations, showing a basic rule of inference. Examples:
* The column-14 operator (OR), shows ''Addition rule'': when ''p''=T (the hypothesis selects the first two lines of the table), we see (at column-14) that ''p''∨''q''=T.
*: We can see also that, with the same premise, another conclusions are valid: columns 12, 14 and 15 are T.
* The column-8 operator (AND), shows ''Simplification rule'': when ''p''∧''q''=T (first line of the table), we see that ''p''=T.
*: With this premise, we also conclude that ''q''=T, ''p''∨''q''=T, etc. as showed by columns 9-15.
* The column-11 operator (IF/THEN), shows ''Modus ponens rule'': when ''p''→''q''=T and ''p''=T only one line of the truth table (the first) satisfies these two conditions. On this line, ''q'' is also true. Therefore, whenever p → q is true and p is true, q must also be true.
Machines and well-trained people use this [[Lookup table|look at table approach]] to do basic inferences, and to check if other inferences (for the same premises) can be obtained.

===Example 1===
Let us consider the following assumptions: "If it rains today, then we will not go on a canoe today. If we do not go on a canoe trip today, then we will go on a canoe trip tomorrow. Therefore (Mathematical symbol for "therefore" is &lt;math&gt;\therefore&lt;/math&gt;), if it rains today, we will go on a canoe trip tomorrow".
To make use of the rules of inference in the above table we let &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; be the proposition "If it rains today", &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; be "We will not go on a canoe today" and let &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; be "We will go on a canoe trip tomorrow". Then this argument is of the form:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
p \rightarrow q\\
q \rightarrow r\\
\therefore \overline{p \rightarrow r} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Example 2===
Let us consider a more complex set of assumptions: "It is not sunny today and it is colder than yesterday". "We will go swimming only if it is sunny", "If we do not go swimming, then we will have a barbecue", and "If we will have a barbecue, then we will be home by sunset" lead to the conclusion "We will be home by sunset."
Proof by rules of inference: Let &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; be the proposition "It is sunny today", &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; the proposition "It is colder than yesterday", &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; the proposition "We will go swimming", &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; the proposition "We will have a barbecue", and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; the proposition "We will be home by sunset". Then the hypotheses become &lt;math&gt;\neg p \wedge q, r \rightarrow p, \neg r \rightarrow s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s \rightarrow t&lt;/math&gt;. Using our intuition we conjecture that the conclusion might be &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Using the Rules of Inference table we can prove the conjecture easily:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Step

|-
| 1.&lt;math&gt;\neg p \wedge q&lt;/math&gt;
| Hypothesis
|-
| 2. &lt;math&gt;\neg p&lt;/math&gt;

|-

|-
| 5. &lt;math&gt;\neg r \rightarrow s&lt;/math&gt;
| Hypothesis
|-
| 6. &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;
| Modus ponens using Step 4 and 5
|-
| 7. &lt;math&gt;s \rightarrow t&lt;/math&gt;
| Hypothesis
|-
| 8. &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;

'''Maqaam''' (also known as ''maqām'') or maqaamat (plural), translating to "''stations''" in Arabic, is the various stages a [[Sufism|Sufi]]'s soul must attain in its search for God.&lt;ref name= Gardet&gt;Gardet, L. "Ḥāl." Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition.  Edited by: P. Bearman; ,  Th. Bianquis; C.E. Bosworth; ,  E. van Donzel; and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2011. Brill Online.  Augustana. 2 April 2011 &lt;http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/entry?entry=islam_COM-0254&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The stations are derived from the most routine considerations a Sufi must deal with on a day-to-day basis and is essentially an embodiment of both mystical knowledge and Islamic law ([[Sharia]]). Although the number and order of maqaamat are not universal the majority agree on the following seven: Tawba, Wara', Zuhd, Faqr, Ṣabr, Tawakkul, and Riḍā.&lt;ref&gt;"maqām." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2011. Web. 7 Apr. 2011. &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/363635/maqam&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Sufis believe that these stations are the grounds of the spiritual life, and they are viewed as a mode through which the most elemental aspects of daily life begin to play a vital role in the overall attainment of oneness with God.&lt;ref name=Sells&gt;Sells, Michael Anthony. Early Islamic Mysticism: Sufi, Qur'an, Mi'Raj, Poetic and Theological Writings. New York: Paulist, 1996. 196-211. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is within the power of a Sufi to fulfill the obligations pertaining to the specific station, and keeping it until its full precision is comprehended.&lt;ref name=Nicholson&gt;Nicholson, Reynold, and al-Hujwiri. The Kashf Al-Mahjub: a Persian Treatise on Sufism. Lahore etc.: Zia-ul-Quran Publications, 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, it is only when one stage has been reached that the next stage may be attained. In order to reach a higher maqaam, one must continue to possess the maqaam below it and not become deprived of it. Each of the stations stand related to each other in a hierarchical order, so that even when they are transcended they remain a permanent possession of the one who attained them. Possession of a certain station means not only to experience it outworldly, but to be internally transformed by it and, in a sense, to embody the stage itself.&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Seyyed Hossein. Sufi Essays. New York: G. Allen and Unwin, 1972. 73-82. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tawba (''Repentance'')==

The first of the maqaamat is Tawba. Al-[[Ghazali]], a prolific Sufi theologian, wrote that Tawba is the repentance of a sin with the promise that it will not be repeated and that the sinner will return to God.&lt;ref name=Ghazzali&gt;Ghazzālī, and Fazl-ul Karim. Revival of Religious Learnings: Imam Ghazzali's Ihya Ulum-id-din. First ed. Vol. IV. New Delhi: Darul Ishaat, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Junayd Baghdadi]] emphasized the return to God by saying this station "is forgetting your fault". This is thought to mean that after realization occurs God will be in constant remembrance and overwhelm the mind.&lt;ref name=Sells/&gt; [[Ibn Arabi]], a Sufi mystic and philosopher who had tremendous influence on post 13th century Islamic thought, spent a great deal of time exploring what religious as well as spiritual authorities identified as being the three conditions of human tawba. The first condition is that of remorse for the violations that have been committed. The second is an immediate abandonment of the sin. The final condition is a firm resolve on the part of the sinner to never return to similar acts of disobedience. All of these conditions essentially convey the message that tawba, in its purest form, consists of forgetting one’s sin. Al-Arabi concluded that brooding over ones faults, after the fact, is not only a hindrance in the remembrance of God but also a subtle form of narcissism.&lt;ref name= Khalil&gt;Khalil, Atif. "Ibn Al-'Arabi on the Three Conditions of Tawba." Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations 17.4 (2006): 403-16. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wara' (''Watchfulness'')==
{{See also|Philokalia#Teachings|Conscientiousness|Discipline}}

People of the second maqaamat, Wara' translating to "''watchfulness''", are divided into three ranks. The first rank is of those who are adamant about avoiding that which lies between the prohibited (''harām'') and the permitted (''halāl''). In other words, they avoid grey area. This is thought to be the rank of common people. The second rank contains those who are cautious with anything concerning sin. This can only be known by the individual. These people are free from association with anything wrong. This is said to be the rank of the select. The third rank in watchfulness is being suspicious of anything that distracts you from God. This is said to be the rank of the very select.&lt;ref name=Sells/&gt;

==Zuhd (''Renunciation'')==

The station of Zuhd, translated "''renunciation''", concerns that which is permitted and is at hand, and the obligatory action of relinquishing all desire for that which is prohibited as well as that which is uncertain.  There exist three ranks of renouncers. The first consists of those who feel no joy at worldly things acquired or grief over worldly things missed. The second rank consists of those who have realized renunciation. These are the people who have discovered that in renunciation of material goods, there are goods for the self such as praise of others, honor, and tranquility that must also be renounced.&lt;ref name=Sells/&gt; The third rank consists of those who would renounce the thought of renunciation, and giving up the hope for heavenly reward or fear of hell.&lt;ref name=Shimmel&gt;Schimmel, Annemarie. Mystical Dimensions of Islam. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina, 1975. 109-30. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Faqr (''Poverty'')==

Faqr, translated as "''poverty''", is one of the central attitudes in a Sufi’s life. It was also one of the attributes of the Prophet. He claimed "poverty is my pride". In a spiritual sense, poverty is defined as the absence of desire for wealth or for the blessings of the otherworld. One of the aspects of one who has embodied the true essence of faqr, is that the mystic must never ask anything of anyone else.&lt;ref name=Shimmel/&gt; The reason for this is for one to ask someone else for anything they would be relying on a created being. To receive something from that same being would produce gratitude in the heart which would be geared toward the giver, not towards God.&lt;ref name=Faqr/&gt;&lt;ref name= Faqr&gt;Mohammad Najib-ur-Rehman, Khadim Sultan-ul-Faqr "What is Faqr" Sultan Bahoo: TheLife and Teachings, First Edition, 2015&lt;https://books.google.com/books?id=hlyMAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=what+is+faqr&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=what%20is%20faqr&amp;f=false&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ṣabr (''Patience'')==

Junayd describes the fifth station, "''patience''", as "The bearing of the burden for the sake of God Most High until the times of hardship have passed."&lt;ref name=Sells/&gt; Al-Ghazzali divides this station into different kinds of patience. The first is to have patience with physical pain. This can be caused by serious illness, an accident or even in the tasks of God's services. This patience is judged by laws of the religion.  The second kind deals with attraction to evil and greed, essentially concerning matters of self-control. He lists other kinds of patience such as that of battles, the appeasement of anger, of happiness and that of possessions.  The Prophet [[Muhammad]] described patience as the most difficult act of faith as well as the forbearing of hardship. Because the Prophet viewed patience as such a difficult act, it is widely followed on the path of a Sufi.&lt;ref name= Ghazzali/&gt;

==Tawakkul (''Trust'')==

Tawwakul, translated "''trust''" is a noble stage a Sufi must reach once he has learned patience, so that when something is denied to a mystic they trust it is in agreement with destiny. True faith is accompanied by tawwakul, a disposition that must be incessantly cultivated through pious practice and reflection.&lt;ref name= Sherine&gt;Sherine F. Hamdy. "Islam, Fatalism, and Medical Intervention: Lessons from Egypt on the Cultivation of Forbearance (Sabr) and Reliance on God (Tawakkul)." Anthropological Quarterly 82.1 (2009): 173-96. Print&lt;/ref&gt; This stage is characterized by complete trust in God and surrender to his will. It is agreed upon by some scholars that because the divine power is all-encompassing, complete trust in this power is mandatory. As such, the degree of tawwakul can vary in accordance to the amount of faith a person has. To place this trust in someone else leads to the greatest sin, [[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]] (''hidden associationism'').&lt;ref name=Shimmel/&gt; When every feeling and thought of a mystic is directed in perfect sincerity towards only God, the mystic is then considered to be the true essence of tawwakkul. Tawwakul is not a "passive" form of fatalism that counteracts human agency, rather it can be characterized as a disposition whose achievement requires active and persistent work on one’s self.&lt;ref name= Sherine/&gt;

==Riḍā (''Satisfaction'')==

Riḍā, the final station, is a word that only roughly translates to "''acceptance''" in English.  Along with this is also means taking pleasure in something or someone. Acceptance is said to be the greatest gate to God and is seen as heaven on earth. The station is divided into three parts. The first consists of those who attempt to silence their anxieties until they are able to accept their misfortunes, comforts, deprivations, or bounties. The second part are those who accept God and wish God to accept them. These people do not seek priority in their acceptance even if they view all blessings and misfortunes the same. The third are those who go beyond the second group by not looking for God's acceptance of them and theirs of God. Instead of this they accept that God has preordained all of his creations.&lt;ref name= Sells/&gt;

==Comparison to Ḥāl (''Spiritual State'')==

Hāl (pl. ahwāl), or [[Haal]], translated "''spiritual state''", appears many times within Sufi texts as the opposite and complement to maqaam.&lt;ref name= Gardet/&gt; As an early authority on Sufism, Ali bin Usman Al-Hujwiri in his book ''[[Kashf ul Mahjoob]]: a Persian Treatise on Sufism'', defines Hal as "something that descends from God into a man’s heart, without his being able to repel it when it comes, or to attract it as it goes, by his own effort."&lt;ref name=Nicholson/&gt; The maqaamat and the ahwal are clearly presented as two series of spiritual states, the first being something one must acquire and the second being something that must be received. To reach a new maqaam does not destroy the preceding maqaam. Hāl, on the contrary, is by its very nature "instantaneous", though not necessarily passive. The most prominent distinction made between the two spiritual states is that the ahwāl are essentially gifts from God, while the maqaamat are acquired through the exertion of effort. In the Ihya Ulum al-din (Revivification of the religious science) al-Ghazali defines Hāl in conjunction and in contrast with maqaam. He says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Qualifications (''wasf'') is called “station” (''maqaam'') if it is stable and endures and it is called “state of soul” (hāl) if it passes away and disappears without delay…What is not stable is called “state of soul” because it disappears to give its place to another state rapidly. This is true of all the qualifications of the heart.&lt;ref name=Ghazzali/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Michael Hillegas''' (April 22, 1729 – September 29, 1804) was the first [[Treasurer of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treas.gov/education/history/treasurers Treasurers of the United States] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513211935/http://www.treas.gov/education/history/treasurers/ |date=2008-05-13 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Hillegas was born in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pgs.org/culture.asp Pennsylvania German Culture and History]&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of Margaret Schiebenstock (1710 – July 21, 1770) and George Michael Hillegass (February 14, 1696 – October 30, 1749), an immigrant from [[Germany]]&lt;ref name="appletons"&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Hillegas, Michael|year=1892}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a well-to-do merchant involved in iron and sugar.  Soon Michael thus had the freedom and resources to participate in local politics. He married Henrietta Boude on May 10, 1753, at Christ Church in Philadelphia, and they went on to have many children. Hillegas was a member of the [[Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly]] from 1765 to 1775 and served as [[treasurer]] of the [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]] under [[Benjamin Franklin]] in 1774.

On July 29, 1775, Hillegas and fellow patriot [[George Clymer]] were appointed by the [[Continental Congress]] to share the office of Treasurer of the United Colonies.&lt;ref&gt;US Treasury website, [http://www.treas.gov/offices/treasurer/office-history.shtml History of the Treasurer's Office] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070508215131/http://www.treas.gov/offices/treasurer/office-history.shtml |date=2007-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Hillegas edited the Declaration of Independence, when the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] was signed, Clymer's signature appeared on the document.

After Clymer's resignation on August 6, 1776, Hillegas assumed sole ownership of the office, which he held throughout the remainder of the [[American Revolution]], using much of his own fortune to support the cause.  His son, Samuel Hillegas, was also given the authority to sign new currency, known as "Continentals." Hillegas also served briefly as quartermaster to the army and served on occasional commissions. On September 9, 1776, the Continental Congress officially changed the name of the country to the [[United States|United States of America]], but Hillegas's title did not officially change until March 1778. On September 11, 1789, Congress created the Treasury Department, and [[Alexander Hamilton]] took the oath of office as the first [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]]. On that same date, Hillegas tendered his resignation, and [[Samuel Meredith]] was appointed Treasurer.

Hillegas was also an early member of the [[American Philosophical Society]], along with Franklin. He died in Philadelphia and is buried near Franklin in [[Christ Church Burial Ground]].  Late in the 19th century, his descendants petitioned&lt;ref&gt;Rev. Michael Reed Minnich, ''A Memoir of the First Treasurer of the United States'', 1905.&lt;/ref&gt; to have his portrait appear on the ten-dollar [[gold certificate]] in the series issued in the years 1907 and 1922.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gold certificate#Series and varieties]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mind and Cosmos: Why the Materialist Neo-Darwinian Conception of Nature is Almost Certainly False''''' is a 2012 book by the philosopher [[Thomas Nagel]].

==Summary==
Nagel argues that the [[Materialism|materialist]] version of [[evolutionary biology]] is unable to account for the existence of [[mind]] and [[consciousness]], and is therefore at best incomplete. He writes that mind is a basic aspect of nature, and that any philosophy of nature that cannot account for it is fundamentally misguided.&lt;ref&gt;For the argument that mind is a basic aspect of nature, see {{harvnb|Nagel|2012|p=16ff}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the standard physico-chemical [[reductionist]] account of [[Abiogenesis|the emergence of life]] – that it emerged from a series of accidents, acted upon by the mechanism of [[natural selection]] – flies in the face of common sense.{{sfn|Nagel|2012|pp=5–6}}

Nagel's position is that principles of an entirely different kind may account for the emergence of life, and in particular conscious life, and that those principles may be [[Teleology|teleological]], rather than materialist or mechanistic. He stresses that his argument is not a religious one (he is an atheist), and that it is not based on the theory of [[intelligent design]] (ID), though he also writes that ID proponents such as [[Michael Behe]], [[Stephen C. Meyer]], and [[David Berlinski]] do not deserve the scorn with which their ideas have been met by the overwhelming majority of the scientific establishment.{{sfn|Nagel|2012|p=10}}

==Reception==

The book generated significant criticism, including from [[Steven Pinker]], [[Daniel Dennett]] and [[Elliott Sober]].&lt;ref name="chronicle"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chorost|first1=Michael|title=Where Thomas Nagel Went Wrong|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/Where-Thomas-Nagel-Went-Wrong/139129/|website=The Chronicle Review|publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sober, Elliot. (2012). [http://bostonreview.net/books-ideas/remarkable-facts "Remarkable Facts: Ending Science as We Know It"]. ''[[Boston Review]]''. Retrieved July 1, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Chorost]] wrote that Nagel raised valid criticisms but did not sufficiently engage with the large – though not dominant – body of scientific literature related to natural teleology. Chorost also suggests the book would have received less criticism had Nagel not endorsed criticisms raised by proponents of intelligent design, despite Nagel's not having endorsed intelligent design as a solution.&lt;ref name="chronicle"/&gt;

Physicist [[Sean M. Carroll]] negatively reviewed the book concluding "he advocates overthrowing things that are precisely defined, extremely robust, and impressively well-tested (the known laws of physics, natural selection) on the basis of ideas that are rather vague and much less well-supported (a conviction that consciousness can’t be explained physically, a demand for intelligibility, moral realism)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2013/08/22/mind-and-cosmos/ "Mind and Cosmos"]. Retrieved July 1, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mitahara'' is a Sanskrit combination word, from Mita (मित, moderate)&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+mita&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU mita] Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University&lt;/ref&gt; and Ahara (आहार, taking food, diet),&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=AhAra&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 AhAra] Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University&lt;/ref&gt; which together mean moderate diet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/aequery/index.html Moderate in eating] Apte English Sanskrit Dictionary (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S Gowens, Ayurvedic Cooking, {{ISBN|978-8179920558}}, pages 13-14&lt;/ref&gt; In Yoga and other ancient texts, it represents a concept linking nutrition to the health of one’s body and mind. It is considered a [[yamas]] or self-restraint virtue in some schools of Indian traditions,&lt;ref&gt;R.S. Bajpai, The Splendours And Dimensions Of Yoga, {{ISBN|81-7156-964-1}}, pages 74-75&lt;/ref&gt; where one refrains from either eating too much or eating too little quantity of food, and where one refrains from either eating too much or too little of certain qualities of food.&lt;ref name=srosen&gt;Steven Rosen (2011), Food for the Soul: Vegetarianism and Yoga Traditions, Praeger, {{ISBN|978-0-313-39703-5}}, pages 25-29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitihara, in What is Hinduism?

== Literature ==
{{Hinduism}}
Ancient and medieval era Indian literature on ''Mitahara'' are of two categories – one relates to philosophical discussion of moderate diet and proper nutrition,&lt;ref name=svatmaram /&gt; the other category relate to details about ''Aharatattva'' ([[dietetics]]).&lt;ref name=ray&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/CarakaSamhitaAScientificSynopsis/CarakaSamhita_priyadaranjanRay#page/n25/mode/2up Caraka Samhita] Ray and Gupta, National Institute of Sciences, India, pages 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; The former category include the Upanishads and Sutras that discuss why virtuous self-restraint is appropriate in matters of food, while the latter include [[Samhita]]s that discuss what and when certain foods are suitable. A few texts such as Hathayoga Pradipika combine both.&lt;ref name=tts /&gt;

=== The virtue of mitahara ===
''Mitahara'' is discussed in [[Shandilya Upanishad|Śāṇḍilya Upanishad]],&lt;ref name="KN Aiyar 1914 pages 173-176" /&gt; as well as by Svātmārāma.&lt;ref name=svatmaram&gt;{{cite book|title=The Hatha Yoga Pradipika|author=Svātmārāma|author2=Pancham Sinh |publisher = Forgotten Books|edition= 5|year=1997|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9sBFttVx6ukC|isbn=  978-1-60506-637-0|page=14|quote=&lt;br /&gt;Quote - अथ यम-नियमाः&lt;br /&gt; अहिंसा सत्यमस्तेयं बरह्यछर्यम कश्हमा धृतिः &lt;br /&gt; दयार्जवं मिताहारः शौछम छैव यमा दश}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lorenzen|first1=David|title=The Kāpālikas and Kālāmukhas|date=1972|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-01842-6|pages=186–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Merging with Śiva: Hinduism's contemporary metaphysics |last= Subramuniya |publisher= Himalayan Academy Publications|year= 2003|location= |isbn=  978-0-945497-99-8 |page=155 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JupkNVxfwHgC |accessdate=6 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the [[yamas]] (virtuous self restraints) discussed in ancient Indian texts. The other nine [[yamas]] are [[Ahiṃsā]] (अहिंसा): Nonviolence, [[Satya]] (सत्य): truthfulness, [[Asteya]] (अस्तेय): not stealing, [[Brahmacharya]] (ब्रह्मचर्य): celibacy and not cheating on one’s spouse, [[Forgiveness#Hinduism|Kṣamā]] (क्षमा): forgiveness,&lt;ref name=ss&gt;Stuart Sovatsky (1998), Words from the Soul: Time East/West Spirituality and Psychotherapeutic Narrative, State University of New York, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-3949-4}}, page 21&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dhrti|Dhṛti]] (धृति): fortitude, [[Compassion#Hinduism|Dayā]] (दया): compassion,&lt;ref name=ss /&gt; [[Ārjava]] (आर्जव): sincerity, non-hypocrisy, and [[Shaucha|Śauca]] (शौच): purity, cleanliness.

Some of the earliest ideas behind ''Mitahara'' trace to ancient era [[Taittiriya Upanishad]], which in various hymns discusses the importance of food to healthy living, to the cycle of life,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/taittiriyaupanis00sankiala#page/396/mode/2up Annamaya Kosa] Taittiriya Upanishad, Anuvaka II, pages 397-406&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to its role in one's body and its effect on Self ([[Brahman]], Atma, Spirit).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/taittiriyaupanis00sankiala#page/740/mode/2up Realization of Brahman] Taittiriya Upanishad, Anuvaka II &amp; VII, pages 740-789; This is extensively discussed in these chapters; Illustrative quote - "Life, verily, is food; the body the food-eater" (page 776)&lt;/ref&gt; The Upanishad, states Stiles,&lt;ref&gt;M Stiles (2008), Ayurvedic Yoga Therapy, Lotus Press, {{ISBN|978-0-940985-97-1}}, pages 56-57&lt;/ref&gt; notes “from food life springs forth, by food it is sustained, and in food it merges when life departs”.

The [[Bhagavad Gita]] includes verses on ‘‘mitahara’’ in Chapter 6. It states in verse 6.16 that a yogi must neither eat too much nor too little, neither sleep too much nor too little.&lt;ref name=pt&gt;Paul Turner (2013), FOOD YOGA – Nourishing Body, Mind &amp; Soul, 2nd Edition, {{ISBN|978-0-9850451-1-1}}, page 164&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding and regulating one’s established habits about eating, sleeping and recreation is suggested as essential to the practice of yoga in verse 6.17.&lt;ref name=pt /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Knapp, The Heart of Hinduism: The Eastern Path to Freedom, Empowerment and Illumination, {{ISBN|978-0-595-35075-9}}, page 284&lt;/ref&gt;

Another ancient text, in a South Indian language, ''[[Tirukkuṛaḷ]]'' states moderate diet as a virtuous life style. This text, written between 200 BC and 400 AD, and sometimes called the Tamil [[Veda]], discusses eating habits and its role in a healthy life (Mitahara), dedicating Chapter 95 of Book 7 to it.&lt;ref name=gutenberg /&gt; ''Tirukkuṛaḷ'' states in verses 943 through 945, “eat in moderation, when you feel hungry, foods that are agreeable to your body, refraining from foods that your body finds disagreeable”. Tiruvalluvar also emphasizes overeating has ill effects on health, in verse 946, as “the pleasures of health abide in the man who eats moderately. The pains of disease dwell with him who eats excessively.”&lt;ref name=gutenberg&gt;[http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/eng_95.htm Tirukkuṛaḷ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227204124/http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/eng_95.htm |date=2014-12-27 }} see Chapter 95, Book 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/tirukkural-tirukkural/oclc/777453934?referer=di&amp;ht=edition Tirukkuṛaḷ] Translated by V.V.R. Aiyar, Tirupparaithurai : Sri Ramakrishna Tapovanam (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval era Sanskrit texts such as Dasakumara Charita and [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]] discuss ''Mitahara''. For example, Hatha Yoga Pradipika verse 1.57 states the importance of ‘‘mitihara’’, as
{{quote|
&lt;nowiki&gt;ब्रह्मचारी मिताहारी तयागी योग-परायणः |  अब्दादूर्ध्वं भवेद्सिद्धो नात्र कार्या विछारणा ||&lt;/nowiki&gt;

A brahmachari, practicing mitahara (moderate diet) and [[tyaga]] (renunciation, solitude), devoted to yoga achieves success in his enquiry and effort within half a year.|Hathayoga Pradipika|1.57&lt;ref name=tts&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/hathayogapradipika/hatha_yoga_pradipika#page/n45/mode/2up Hathayoga Pradipika] Brahmananda, Adyar Library, The Theosophical Society, Madras India (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Verses 1.57 through 1.63 of the critical edition of Hathayoga Pradipika suggests that taste cravings should not drive one’s eating habits, rather the best diet is one that is tasty, nutritious and likable as well as sufficient to meet the needs of one’s body and for one’s inner self.&lt;ref name=ksj /&gt; It recommends that one must “eat only when one feels hungry” and “neither overeat nor eat to completely fill the capacity of one’s stomach; rather leave a quarter portion empty and fill three quarters with quality food and fresh water”.&lt;ref name=ksj&gt;KS Joshi, Speaking of Yoga and Nature-Cure Therapy, Sterling Publishers, {{ISBN|978-1-84557-045-3}}, page 65-66&lt;/ref&gt; Verses 1.59 to 1.61 of Hathayoga Pradipika suggests ‘‘mitahara’’ regimen of a yogi avoids foods with excessive amounts of sour, salt, bitterness, oil, spice burn, unripe vegetables, fermented foods or alcohol. The practice of ''Mitahara'', in Hathayoga Pradipika, includes avoiding stale, impure and [[Tamas (philosophy)|tamasic]] foods, and consuming moderate amounts of fresh, vital and [[Sattva|sattvic]] foods.&lt;ref name=srosen /&gt;

=== Dietectics and mitahara ===
[[Charaka Samhita]] and [[Sushruta Samhita]] are among the two largest surviving compendium on nutrition and diet that have survived from ancient and medieval periods of India.&lt;ref name=ray /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/englishtranslati00susruoft#page/n3/mode/2up Sushruta Samhita] KKL Bhishagratna, Vol 2, Calcutta&lt;/ref&gt; Caraka Samhita emphasizes the need to plan and understand the role of diet in health, across Chapters 5, 6, 25, 26 and 27. In verse 25.31, it states "wholesome diet promotes health and growth, unwholesome diet is the most important cause of diseases". In verses 25.38-39, Caraka Samhita classifies foods into groups based on its source and taste, then categorizes them into nutritive and harmful. In Chapters 26 and 27, it suggests that the same food can be nutritive in small amounts while harmful in large amounts or if cooked improperly or if eaten together with foods its lists. Food, claims Caraka Samhita, must be tailored to needs of one's body, state of one's health, climate, season, habits and personal palatability and needs.&lt;ref name=ray /&gt; In the spirit of Mitahara, in Chapter 5, it insists even light, easily digested and nutritious food should be consumed in moderation and should not be consumed in excess of bodily requirements. In Chapter 6, Caraka Samhita recommends that food should be tailored to the season, with rich and fatty foods being beneficial in winter, while light soups, fruits and acidulated drinks more suited for summers. In verses 6.6-7, it suggests that the diet should be planned and nourishing foods consumed in rotation, tailored to one's health condition and personal needs.&lt;ref name=ray /&gt;

As with Caraka Samhita, the other large compendium on health – Sushruta Samhita – includes many chapters on the role of diet and personal needs of an individual. In Chapter 10 of Sushruta Samhita, for example, the diet and nutrition for pregnant women, nursing mothers and young children are described.&lt;ref&gt;KKL Bhishagratna, [https://archive.org/stream/englishtranslati00susruoft#page/216/mode/2up Chapter X, Sushruta Samhita], Vol 2, Calcutta, page 216-238&lt;/ref&gt; It recommends milk, butter, fluid foods, fruits, vegetables and fibrous diets for expecting mothers along with soups made from ''jangala'' (wild) meat.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/englishtranslati00susruoft#page/216/mode/2up Sushruta Samhita] KKL Bhishagratna, Vol 2, Calcutta, page 217&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, vegetarian diets are preferred and recommended in the Samhitas; however, for those recovering from injuries, growing children, those who do high levels of physical exercise, and expecting mothers, Sutrasthanam's Chapter 20 and other texts recommend carefully prepared meat. Sushruta Samhita also recommends a rotation and balance in foods consumed, in moderation. For this purposes, it classifies foods by various characteristics, such as taste. In Chapter 42 of Sutrasthanam, for example, it lists six tastes – ''madhura'' (sweet), ''amla'' (acidic), ''lavana'' (saline), ''katuka'' (pungent), ''tikta'' (bitter) and ''kashaya'' (astringent). It then lists various sources of foods that deliver these tastes and recommends that all six tastes (flavors) be consumed in moderation and routinely, as a habit for good health.&lt;ref&gt;KKL Bhishagratna, [https://archive.org/stream/englishtranslati01susruoft#page/384/mode/2up Sutrasthanam, Chapter XLII] Sushruta Samhita, Vol 1, Calcutta, page 385-393&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related concepts ==
The concept of ''Mitahara'' is discussed in over 30 different ancient and medieval era texts of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=svb&gt;SV Bharti (2001), Yoga Sutras of Patanjali: With the Exposition of Vyasa, Motilal Banarsidas, {{ISBN|978-8120818255}}, Appendix I, pages 672-680&lt;/ref&gt; However, some texts use a different word and concept for the idea of "moderate diet and paying attention to what one eats and drinks". For example, Shivayoga Dipika uses the term ''Niyatāshana'' (planned, regulated eating), while Dattatreya Samhita uses ''Laghrāhāra'' (eating lightly, small portions of diverse foods).&lt;ref name=svb /&gt;

'''Niall Shanks''' (January 18, 1959 — July 13, 2011) was an English Canadian [[philosopher]] and critic of [[intelligent design]].

==Career==

Shanks was born in [[Cheshire]], [[England]], was educated at [[Rossall School]], and later at the [[University of Leeds]] and the [[University of Liverpool]].  Shanks left England for Canada in 1981 and earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Alberta]], [[Canada]] in 1987. Shanks moved to the United States in 1987. For a number of years Shanks was a member of the Department of Philosophy at [[East Tennessee State University]], where he also held positions in the Department of Biological Sciences and the Department of Physics and Astronomy.  He then moved to [[Wichita State University]] where he was the Curtis D. Gridley Professor in the History and Philosophy of Science.&lt;ref name="Wichita"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=y_xTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1zkNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2809,3756121&amp;dq=niall+shanks&amp;hl=en Prominent defender of evolution joins Wichita State University Staff]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shanks served a term as President (2008-9) of the Southwest and Rocky Mountain Division of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]; He was vice-president and board member of [[Americans For Medical Advancement]] for ten years; and an honorary Board Member of [[Internet Infidels]].  In 1993 he served a term as President of the Tennessee Philosophical Association. He died on 13 July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/news/2011/09/niall-shanks-dies-006857 Niall Shanks dies]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shanks' early research interests were focused on issues in the philosophical foundations of quantum mechanics.  He later wrote about the case against Intelligent Design and actively defended evolution. Beginning in the 1990s he explored the implications of evolutionary biology for biomedical research and was actively involved in this until his death.  Shanks was also interested in the history of medicine and the role played by medicine in the scientific revolutions of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

==Research==

'''''Quantum Theory''''': Shanks early work was focused on so-called [[hidden-variables theory]] of non-relativistic elementary [[quantum mechanics]], and the problem of the construction of classical models (models exhibiting the properties of determinateness and determinism) for quantum measurement statistics.  Shanks argued that the various no-hidden-variables proofs rested on questionable assumptions which a classical modeler could plausibly deny.  Shanks would later argue that local deterministic models were indeed possible for the puzzling quantum spin correlation statistics that were used to characterize [[Bell's Theorem]] (a modern incarnation of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox [[EPR paradox]]).  Shanks essay, ''Quantum Mechanics and Determinism'', (Philosophical Quarterly,1993, vol. 43, 170:20-37) summarizes his arguments in an accessible manner.  At this point in time, working with W. David Sharp, Shanks examined some puzzles concerning ''counterfactual interpretations'' of quantum mechanics.  This work culminated in the ''Sharp and Shanks proof'' that counterfactual interpretations of quantum spin measurements could not be reconciled with the validated predictions of quantum mechanics (see W.D. Sharp and N. Shanks, 1993, ''The Rise and Fall of Time-Symmetrized Quantum Mechanics'', Philosophy of Science, vol. 60:488-499).

'''''Animals, Science and Animal Science''''': Shanks has explored the role played by animal experimentation in the contexts of [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]] during the [[renaissance]].  He has argued that animal experimentation provided a crucial driving force behind the method of analysis and synthesis that would come to play a central role in the emergence of the physico-chemical sciences in the 17th and 18th centuries.  According to Shanks, the development of modern science flows from ''physik'' (i.e., medicine) to ''physics'', and not the reverse as is commonly supposed.  Physics would ultimately come to have profound implications for physiology, and these matters are explored by Shanks in his work on the writings of the great 19th century French physiologist, [[Claude Bernard]].  In the course of his explorations of the implications of the study of animals for the modern scientific view of the world, Shanks has explored the issue of animal consciousness and the question as to what, if anything, science can teach us about the mental lives of animals.  Shanks has argued that there is no straightforward fact of the matter to settle disputes between those who have a very generous view of the mental lives of animals (for example, in some versions of  [[cognitive ethology]] derived from the work of [[Donald Griffin]]), and those who favor minimalistic cognitive estimates (for example, some species of [[behaviorism]]).  Shanks has argued that disputes about these matters hinge not on appeals to the facts, but rather on disputes about what the relevant facts are, and where these disputes do not themselves admit of a straightforward factual resolution.

'''''Creationism''''': Shanks was a staunch defender of [[evolutionary biology]] and a vehement opponent of [[creationism]] (and its recent incarnation in the form of [[intelligent design]] theology).&lt;ref name="Wichita"/&gt;  Shanks argued that the [[intelligent design movement]] is rooted in bad science, bad theology and a radical right-wing social agenda.  His views may be found in his book, ''God, The Devil and Darwin''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/books/who-made-us-what-do-you-think/2005/10/01/1127804692244.html?page=2 Who made us? What do you think?]&lt;/ref&gt; Shanks conducted numerous public debates with creationists and advocates of intelligent design, including [[Duane Gish]], [[William Dembski]], [[Paul Nelson (creationist)]] and [[Michael Behe]].&lt;ref name="Wichita"/&gt;   Shanks is an advocate of methodological [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] and has argued against drawing [[supernatural]] conclusions on the basis of either biological [[complexity]] or puzzles in [[cosmology]] concerning the [[fine-tuned universe]].  In addition to evolution, Shanks emphasized the role played by [[self-organization]] in a purely naturalistic account of biological and cosmological phenomena.

'''''Evolution and Medicine''''': Shanks made contributions to debates on topics in what may be broadly characterized as [[evolutionary medicine]].  It is now generally recognized{{Citation needed|reason=source needed|date=July 2013}} that the implications evolutionary biology for medicine must be taken into account if modern medical inquiry is to be placed on a sound theoretical foundation.  The great population geneticist [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] once remarked that "[[nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution]]."  This is especially true of modern medicine.  Shanks has argued that evolutionary biology is highly important when considering the so-called ''prediction problem'' in biomedical research.  It has become common scientific practice in research in [[toxicology]], [[drug development]], [[pathology]] and [[therapeutics]] to explore human biomedical phenomena by performing experiments on nonhuman animals and then extrapolating the results to humans (animals play many roles in biomedical research, but one important role is as predictors of human biomedical phenomena).  Shanks claims that a prediction problem exists due to the fact that humans and their nonhuman models have taken divergent evolutionary trajectories, and are thus not qualitatively identical systems (once compensation has been made for purely quantitative differences in body weight, for example).  Put bluntly, the prediction problem boils down to this: if mice are not men writ small, under what conditions do we expect experimental results on mice to have informational value for human biomedical phenomena?  Two of Shanks' essays have generated some interest in this puzzle (see ''Evolution and Medicine: The Long Reach of Dr. Darwin'', http://www.peh-med.com/content/2/1/4, written with Rebecca Pyles, Ph.D., and ''Are Animal Models Predictive for Humans'', http://www.peh-med.com/content/4/1/2, written with Ray Greek, MD., and Jean Greek, DVM).

'''Orthogenesis''', also known as '''orthogenetic evolution''', '''progressive evolution''', '''evolutionary progress''', or '''progressionism''', is the biological [[hypothesis]] that [[organism]]s have an innate tendency to [[evolution|evolve]] in a definite direction [[teleology|towards some goal (teleology)]] due to some internal mechanism or "driving force".{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pages=268–270}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Ernst Mayr |author=Mayr, Ernst |date=1988 |title=Toward a New Philosophy of Biology: Observations of an Evolutionist |publisher=Harvard University Press |page=499 |isbn=0-674-89666-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ruse|1996|pages=526–539}} According to the theory, the [[largest-scale trends in evolution]] have an absolute goal such as [[Evolution of biological complexity|increasing biological complexity]]. Prominent historical figures who have championed some form of evolutionary progress include [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], [[Teilhard de Chardin|Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], and [[Henri Bergson]].

The term ''orthogenesis'' was introduced by [[Wilhelm Haacke]] in 1893 and popularized by [[Theodor Eimer]] five years later. Proponents of orthogenesis had rejected the theory of [[natural selection]] as the organizing mechanism in [[evolution]] for a rectilinear model of directed evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ulett, Mark A. |date=2014 |title=Making the case for orthogenesis: The popularization of definitely directed evolution (1890–1926) |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences |volume=45 |pages=124–132 |doi=10.1016/j.shpsc.2013.11.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the emergence of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]], in which [[genetics]] was integrated with evolution, orthogenesis and other [[alternatives to Darwinism]] were largely abandoned by biologists, but the notion that evolution represents progress is still widely shared. The evolutionary biologist [[Ernst Mayr]] made the term effectively taboo in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1948, by stating that it implied "some supernatural force".{{sfn|Ruse|1996|page=447}}&lt;ref name=Mayr1948&gt;Letter from [[Ernst Mayr]] to R. H. Flower, ''Evolution'' papers, 23 January 1948&lt;/ref&gt; The American paleontologist [[George Gaylord Simpson]] (1953) attacked orthogenesis, linking it with [[vitalism]] by describing it as "the mysterious inner force".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=George Gaylord Simpson |author=Simpson, George Gaylord |date=1953 |title=Life of the Past: An Introduction to Paleontology |publisher=Yale University Press |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern supporters include [[E. O. Wilson]] and [[Simon Conway Morris]], while museum displays and textbook illustrations continue to give the impression of progress in evolution.

The philosopher of biology [[Michael Ruse]] notes that in popular culture evolution and progress are synonyms, while the unintentionally misleading image of the ''[[March of Progress]]'', from apes to modern humans, has been widely imitated.

The term orthogenesis (from Ancient Greek ὀρθός orthós, "straight", and γένεσις génesis, "origin") was first used by the biologist [[Wilhelm Haacke]] in 1893.&lt;ref name=LevitOlsson2006/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gould 2002"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |author=Gould, Stephen Jay |date=2002 |title=[[The Structure of Evolutionary Theory]] |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=351–352 |isbn=978-0-674-00613-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodor Eimer]] was the first to give the word a definition; he defined orthogenesis as "the general law according to which evolutionary development takes place in a noticeable direction, above all in specialized groups".&lt;ref name="Lane 1996"&gt;{{cite book |author=Lane, David H. |date=1996 |title=The Phenomenon of Teilhard: Prophet for a New Age |publisher=Mercer University Press |pages=60–64 |isbn=0-86554-498-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, the zoologist [[Michael F. Guyer]] wrote:

{{quote|[Orthogenesis] has meant many different things to many different people, ranging from a mystical [[inner perfecting principle]], to merely a general trend in development due to the natural constitutional restrictions of the germinal materials, or to the physical limitations imposed by a narrow environment. In most modern statements of the theory, the idea of continuous and progressive change in one or more characters, due according to some to internal factors, according to others to external causes-evolution in a "straight line" seems to be the central idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Guyer, Michael F. |date=1922 |jstor=2456504 |title=Orthogenesis and Serological Phenomena |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=56 |issue=643 |pages=116–133 |doi=10.1086/279852}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Susan R. Schrepfer in 1983:

{{quote|Orthogenesis meant literally "straight origins", or "straight line evolution". The term varied in meaning from the overtly vitalistic and theological to the mechanical. It ranged from theories of mystical forces to mere descriptions of a general trend in development due to natural limitations of either the germinal material or the environment&amp;nbsp;... By 1910, however most who subscribed to orthogenesis hypothesized some physical rather than metaphysical determinant of orderly change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schrepfer, Susan R. |date=1983 |title=Fight to Save the Redwoods: A History of the Environmental Reform, 1917–1978 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |pages=81–82 |isbn=978-0-299-08854-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1988, [[Francisco J. Ayala]] defined progress as "systematic change in a feature belonging to all the members of a sequence in such a way that posterior members of the sequence exhibit an improvement of that feature". He argued that there are two elements in this definition, directional change and improvement according to some standard. Whether a directional change constitutes an improvement is not a scientific question; therefore Ayala suggested that science should focus on the question of whether there is directional change, without regard to whether the change is "improvement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ayala, Francisco J. |authorlink=Francisco J. Ayala |year=1988 |title=Can progress be defined as a biological concept? |work=Evolutionary Progress |editor=Nitecki, M. |pages=75–96 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-58693-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be compared to [[Stephen Jay Gould]]'s suggestion of "replacing the idea of progress with an operational notion of directionality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gould, Stephen Jay |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |date=1997 |title=Full House: The Spread of Excellence from Plato to Darwin |publisher=Harmony |isbn=0-609-80140-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, [[Peter J. Bowler]] defined orthogenesis as:

{{quote|Literally, the term means evolution in a straight line, generally assumed to be evolution that is held to a regular course by forces internal to the organism. Orthogenesis assumes that variation is not random but is directed [[Teleology in biology|towards fixed goals]]. Selection is thus powerless, and the species is carried automatically in the direction marked out by internal factors controlling variation.{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pages=268–270}}}}

In 1996, [[Michael Ruse]] defined orthogenesis as "the view that evolution has a kind of momentum of its own that carries organisms along certain tracks".{{sfn|Ruse|1996|page=261}}

===Mediaeval===
The possibility of progress is embedded in the mediaeval [[great chain of being]], with a linear sequence of forms from lowest to highest. The concept, indeed, had its roots in [[Aristotle's biology]], from insects that produced only a grub, to fish that laid eggs, and on up to animals with blood and live birth. The mediaeval chain, as in [[Ramon Lull]]'s ''Ladder of Ascent and Descent of the Mind'', 1305, added steps or levels above humans, with orders of angels reaching up to God at the top.{{sfn|Ruse|1996|pp=21–23}}

===Pre-Darwinian===
The orthogenesis hypothesis had a significant following in the 19th century when evolutionary mechanisms such as [[Lamarckism]] were being proposed. The French zoologist [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] (1744–1829) himself accepted the idea, and it had a central role in his theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics, the hypothesized mechanism of which resembled the "mysterious inner force" of orthogenesis.&lt;ref name="Gould 2001"/&gt; Orthogenesis was particularly accepted by paleontologists who saw in their fossils a directional change, and in [[invertebrate paleontology]] thought there was a gradual and constant directional change.  Those who accepted orthogenesis in this way, however, did not necessarily accept that the mechanism that drove orthogenesis was [[teleology|teleological]] (had a definite goal). [[Charles Darwin]] himself rarely used the term "evolution" now so commonly used to describe his theory, because the term was strongly associated with orthogenesis, as had been common usage since at least 1647.&lt;ref name=Gould1977&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |author=Gould, Stephen Jay |date=1977 |url=http://wordorigins.org/wordore.htm |title=Darwin's Dilemma: The Odyssey of Evolution |work=Ever Since Darwin: Reflections in Natural History |publisher=[[W.

Ruse observed that "Progress ''(sic, his capitalisation)'' became essentially a nineteenth-century belief.

The Russian biologist [[Karl Ernst von Baer]] (1792–1876) argued for an orthogenetic force in nature, reasoning in a review of Darwin's 1859 ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' that "Forces which are not directed—so-called blind forces—can never produce order."&lt;ref name=Brown2001&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Keven|last2=Von Kitzing|first2=Eberhard|title=Evolution and Bahá'í Belief: ʻAbduʼl-Bahá's Response to Nineteenth-century Darwinism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=egDAfpkONRsC&amp;pg=PA159|year=2001|publisher=Kalimat Press|isbn=978-1-890688-08-0|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Barbieri, Marcello |date=2013 |title=Biosemiotics: Information, Codes and Signs in Living Systems |publisher=Nova Science Publishers |page=7 |isbn=978-1-60021-612-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jacobsen, Eric Paul |date=2005 |title=From Cosmology to Ecology: The Monist World-view in Germany from 1770 to 1930 |page=100 |publisher=Peter Lang |isbn=978-0-8204-7231-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1864, the Swiss anatomist [[Albert von Kölliker]] (1817–1905) presented his orthogenetic theory, ''[[heterogenesis]]'', arguing for wholly separate lines of descent with no common ancestor.&lt;ref name=Vucinich1988&gt;{{cite book |author=Vucinich, Alexander |date=1988 |title=Darwin in Russian Thought |publisher=University of California Press |page=137 |isbn=978-0-520-06283-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1884, the Swiss botanist [[Carl Nägeli]] (1817–1891) proposed a version of orthogenesis involving an "inner perfecting principle". [[Gregor Mendel]] died that same year; Nägeli, who proposed that an "[[idioplasm]]" transmitted inherited characteristics, dissuaded Mendel from continuing to work on plant genetics.&lt;ref name=Mawer2006&gt;{{cite book |author=Mawer, Simon |authorlink=Simon Mawer |title=Gregor Mendel: planting the seeds of genetics |date=2006 |publisher=Harry N.

In 1898, after studying [[butterfly]] coloration, [[Theodor Eimer&lt;!--mild overlink, seems helpful here--&gt;]] (1843–1898) introduced the term orthogenesis with a widely read book, ''On Orthogenesis: And the Impotence of Natural Selection in Species Formation''.

He used examples such as the [[evolution]] of the [[horse]] to argue that evolution had proceeded in a regular single direction that was difficult to explain by random variation. Gould described Eimer as a [[materialist]] who rejected any [[vitalist]] or [[teleological]] approach to orthogenesis, arguing that Eimer's criticism of natural selection was common amongst many evolutionists of his generation; they were searching for alternative mechanisms, as they had come to believe that natural selection could not create new [[species]].&lt;ref name=Gould2002&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |author=Gould, Stephen Jay |date=2002 |title=The Structure of Evolutionary Theory |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=355–364 |isbn=978-0-674-00613-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nineteenth and twentieth century===
{{see|Eclipse of Darwinism}}

Numerous versions of orthogenesis (see table) have been proposed. Debate centred on whether such theories were scientific, or whether orthogenesis was inherently vitalistic or essentially theological.&lt;ref name=Simpson1964/&gt; For example, biologists such as Maynard M. Metcalf (1914), [[John Merle Coulter]] (1915), [[David Starr Jordan]] (1920) and Charles B. Lipman (1922) claimed evidence for orthogenesis in [[bacteria]], [[fish]] populations and [[plant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Metcalf Maynard M | year = 1913 | title = Adaptation Through Natural Selection and Orthogenesis | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 47 | issue = 554| pages = 65–71 | jstor=2455865 | doi=10.1086/279329}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Merle Coulter]].

In 1950, the German paleontologist [[Otto Schindewolf]] argued that variation tends to move in a predetermined direction. He believed this was purely mechanistic, denying any kind of [[vitalism]], but that evolution occurs due to a periodic cycle of evolutionary processes dictated by factors internal to the organism.&lt;ref name=Kwa2011&gt;{{cite book |author=Kwa, Chunglin |date=2011 |title=Styles of Knowing: A New History of Science from Ancient Times to the Present |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |page=237 |isbn=978-0-8229-6151-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dimichele William A | year = 1995 | title = Basic Questions in Paleontology: Geologic Time, Organic Evolution, and Biological Systematics, by Otto H.

In 1964 [[George Gaylord Simpson]] argued that orthogenetic theories such as those promulgated by Du Noüy and Sinnott were essentially theology rather than biology.&lt;ref name=Simpson1964&gt;{{cite book |author=Simpson, George Gaylord |authorlink=George Gaylord Simpson |date=1964 |title="Evolutionary Theology: The New Mysticism" |work=This View of Life: The World of an Evolutionist |publisher=Harcourt, Brace &amp; World |pages=213–233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though evolution is not progressive, it does sometimes proceed in a linear way, reinforcing characteristics in certain lineages, but such examples are entirely consistent with the modern neo-Darwinian theory of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jepsen, Glenn L.  |date=1949 |title=Selection.

[[File:Alternatives to Darwinism.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Alternatives to evolution by natural selection|Multiple explanations have been offered]] since the 19th century for how evolution took place, given that many scientists initially had objections to natural selection. Many of these theories led (solid blue arrows) to some form of orthogenesis, with or without invoking [[theistic evolution|divine control]] (dotted blue arrows) directly or indirectly. For example, evolutionists like [[Edward Drinker Cope]] believed in a combination of theistic evolution, Lamarckism, vitalism, and orthogenesis,{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=261-262}} represented by a sequence of arrows on the left of the diagram. The development of modern Darwinism is indicated by dashed orange arrows.]]

The various [[Alternatives to evolution by natural selection|alternatives to Darwinian evolution]] by natural selection were not necessarily mutually exclusive. The evolutionary philosophy of the American palaeontologist [[Edward Drinker Cope]] is a case in point. Cope, a religious man, began his career denying the possibility of evolution. In the 1860s, he accepted that evolution could occur, but, influenced by Agassiz, rejected natural selection. Cope accepted instead the theory of recapitulation of evolutionary history during the growth of the embryo - that [[ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny]], which Agassiz believed showed a divine plan leading straight up to man, in a pattern revealed both in [[embryology]] and [[palaeontology]]. Cope did not go so far, seeing that evolution created a branching tree of forms, as Darwin had suggested. Each evolutionary step was however non-random: the direction was determined in advance and had a regular pattern (orthogenesis), and steps were not adaptive but part of a divine plan (theistic evolution). This left unanswered the question of why each step should occur, and Cope switched his theory to accommodate functional adaptation for each change. Still rejecting natural selection as the cause of adaptation, Cope turned to Lamarckism to provide the force guiding evolution. Finally, Cope supposed that Lamarckian use and disuse operated by causing a vitalist growth-force substance, "bathmism", to be concentrated in the areas of the body being most intensively used; in turn, it made these areas develop at the expense of the rest. Cope's complex set of beliefs thus assembled five evolutionary philosophies: recapitulationism, orthogenesis, theistic evolution, Lamarckism, and vitalism.{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=261-262}} Other palaeontologists and field naturalists continued to hold beliefs combining orthogenesis and Lamarckism until the modern synthesis in the 1930s.{{sfn|Bowler|1989|p=264}}

The stronger versions of the orthogenetic hypothesis began to lose popularity when it became clear that they were inconsistent with the patterns found by [[paleontology|paleontologists]] in the [[fossil record]], which were non-rectilinear (richly branching) with many complications. The hypothesis was abandoned by the mainstream of evolutionists when no mechanism could be found that would account for the process, and the theory of evolution by natural selection came to prevail.&lt;ref name=Mayr1982&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Ernst Mayr |author=Mayr, Ernst |date=1982 |title=The Growth of Biological Thought: Diversity, Evolution, and Inheritance |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=530–531 |isbn=0-674-36446-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian of biology Edward J. Larson commented that

{{quote|At theoretical and philosophical levels, Lamarckism and orthogenesis seemed to solve too many problems to be dismissed out of hand—yet biologists could never reliably document them happening in nature or in the laboratory.

The [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of the 1930s and 1940s, in which the [[genetics|genetic]] mechanisms of evolution were incorporated, appeared to refute the hypothesis for good. As more was understood about these mechanisms it came to be held that there was no naturalistic way in which the newly discovered mechanism of [[heredity]] could be far-sighted or have a memory of past trends. Orthogenesis was seen to lie outside the [[methodological naturalism]] of the sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |author=Gould, Stephen Jay |title=[[The Structure of Evolutionary Theory]] |date=2002 |pages=Chapter 7, section "Synthesis as Restriction" |isbn=0-674-00613-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Levinton, Jeffrey S. |date=2001 |title=Genetics, Paleontology, and Macroevolution |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=14–16 |isbn=0-521-80317-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Montgomery, Georgina M.|author2=Largent, Mark A. |date=2015 |title=A Companion to the History of American Science  |publisher=Wiley |page=218 |isbn=978-1-4051-5625-7 |quote=With the integration of Mendelian genetics and population genetics into evolutionary theory in the 1930s a new generation of biologists applied mathematical techniques to investigate how changes in the frequency of genes in populations combined with natural selection could produce species change.

[[File:Ernst Mayr PLoS.jpg|thumb|[[Ernst Mayr]] considered orthogenesis effectively taboo in 1948.{{sfn|Ruse|1996|page=447}}]]

By 1948, the evolutionary biologist [[Ernst Mayr]], as editor of the journal ''Evolution'', made the use of the term ''orthogenesis'' taboo: "It might be well to abstain from use of the word 'orthogenesis' .. since so many of the geneticists seem to be of the opinion that the use of the term implies some supernatural force."{{sfn|Ruse|1996|page=447}}&lt;ref name=Mayr1948/&gt; With the rise of [[evolutionary developmental biology]] in the late 20th-early 21st centuries, however, which is open to an expanded concept of heredity that incorporates the physics of [[self-organization]], ideas of constraint and preferred directions of morphological change have made a reappearance in evolutionary theory.&lt;ref&gt;see, for example, {{cite book |editor1-link=Gerd Müller (theoretical biologist)|editor1=Müller, Gerd B.|editor2-link=Stuart Newman|editor2=Newman, Stuart A.|title=[[Origination of Organismal Form]] |date=2003 |publisher=Bradford |isbn=0-262-13419-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher of biology [[Michael Ruse]] wrote that "some of the most significant of today's evolutionists are progressionists, and that because of this we find (absolute) progressionism alive and well in their work."{{sfn|Ruse|1996|p=536}} He argued that progressionism has harmed the status of [[evolutionary biology]] as a mature, professional science.{{sfn|Ruse|1996|p=530}} Presentations of evolution remain characteristically progressionist, with humans at the top of the "Tower of Time" in the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in [[Washington D.C.]], while ''[[Scientific American]]'' magazine could illustrate the history of life leading progressively from mammals to dinosaurs to primates and finally man. Ruse noted that at the popular level, progress and evolution are simply synonyms, as they were in the nineteenth century, though confidence in the value of cultural and technological progress has declined.{{sfn|Ruse|1996|pages=526–539}}

===In popular culture===

{{further|March of Progress}}

In popular culture, progressionist images of evolution are widespread. The historian Jennifer Tucker, writing in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', notes that [[Thomas Henry Huxley]]'s 1863 illustration comparing the skeletons of apes and humans "has become an iconic and instantly recognizable visual shorthand for evolution."&lt;ref name="Tucker2012"/&gt; She calls its history extraordinary, saying that it is "one of the most intriguing, and most misleading, drawings in the modern history of science." Nobody, Tucker observes, supposes that the "monkey-to-man" sequence accurately depicts Darwinian evolution. ''The Origin of Species'' had only one illustration, a diagrams showing that random events create a process of branching evolution, a view that Tucker notes is broadly acceptable to modern biologists. But Huxley's image recalled the great chain of being, implying with the force of a visual image a "logical, evenly paced progression" leading up to ''Homo sapiens'', a view denounced by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] in ''[[Wonderful Life (book)|Wonderful Life]]''.&lt;ref name="Tucker2012"/&gt;

[[File:Man is But a Worm.jpg|thumb|upright|''Man is But a Worm'' by [[Edward Linley Sambourne]], ''Punch's Almanack'' for 1882]]

Popular perception, however, had seized upon the idea of linear progress. [[Edward Linley Sambourne]]'s ''Man is But a Worm'', drawn for ''Punch's Almanack'', mocked the idea of any evolutionary link between humans and animals, with a sequence from chaos to earthworm to apes, primitive men, a Victorian beau, and Darwin in a pose that according to Tucker recalls [[Michelangelo]]'s figure of [[Adam]] in his fresco adorning the ceiling of the [[Sistine Chapel]]. This was followed by a flood of variations on the evolution-as-progress theme, including ''The New Yorker'''s 1925 "The Rise and Fall of Man", the sequence running from a chimpanzee to [[Neanderthal man]], [[Socrates]], and finally the lawyer [[William Jennings Bryan]] who argued for the anti-evolutionist prosecution in the [[Scopes Trial]] on the State of Tennessee law limiting the teaching of evolution.  Tucker noted that [[Rudolph Franz Zallinger]]'s 1965 "[[March of Progress|The Road to Homo Sapiens]]" fold-out illustration in [[F. Clark Howell]]'s ''Early Man'', showing a sequence of 14 walking figures ending with modern man, fitted the palaeoanthropological discoveries "not into a branching Darwinian scheme, but into the framework of the original Huxley diagram." Howell ruefully commented that the "powerful and emotional" graphic had overwhelmed his Darwinian text.&lt;ref name="Tucker2012"/&gt;

===Sliding between meanings===

Scientists, Ruse argues, continue to slide easily from one notion of progress to another: even committed Darwinians like [[Richard Dawkins]] embed the idea of cultural progress in a theory of cultural units, [[meme]]s, that act much like genes.{{sfn|Ruse|1996|pages=526–539}} Dawkins can speak of "progressive rather than random&amp;nbsp;... trends in evolution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dawkins, Richard |author2=Krebs, J. R. |authorlink1=Richard Dawkins |authorlink2=John Krebs, Baron Krebs |title=Arms races between and within species |date=1979 |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |volume=205 |pages=489–511 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1979.0081|bibcode=1979RSPSB.205..489D }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ruse|1996|page=466}} Dawkins and [[John Krebs, Baron Krebs|John Krebs]] deny the "earlier [Darwinian] prejudice"{{sfn|Ruse|1996|page=468}} that there is anything "inherently progressive about evolution",{{sfn|Dawkins|1986|page=178}}{{sfn|Ruse|1996|page=468}} but the feeling of progress comes from evolutionary [[arms race]]s which remain in Dawkins's words "by far the most satisfactory explanation for the existence of the advanced and complex machinery that animals and plants possess".{{sfn|Dawkins|1986|page=181}}{{sfn|Ruse|1996|page=468}}

Ruse concludes his detailed analysis of the idea of ''Progress'', meaning a progressionist philosophy, in evolutionary biology by stating that evolutionary thought came out of that philosophy. Before Darwin, Ruse argues, evolution was just a [[pseudoscience]]; Darwin made it respectable, but "only as popular science". "There it remained frozen, for nearly another hundred years",{{sfn|Ruse|1996|pages=526–539}} until mathematicians such as Fisher{{sfn|Ruse|1996|pages=292–295}} provided "both [[population genetics|models]] and status", enabling evolutionary biologists to construct the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of the 1930s and 1940s. That made biology a professional science, at the price of ejecting the notion of progress. That, Ruse argues, was a significant cost to "people [biologists] still firmly committed to Progress" as a philosophy.{{sfn|Ruse|1996|pages=526–539}}

==Facilitated variation==

{{main|Facilitated variation}}

Biology has largely rejected the idea that evolution is guided in any way,{{sfn|Bowler|1989|page=270}}{{sfn|Larson|2004|page=127}} but the evolution of some features is indeed [[facilitated variation|facilitated]] by the genes of the [[developmental-genetic toolkit]] studied in [[evolutionary developmental biology]]. An example is the development of wing pattern in some species of ''[[Heliconius]]'' butterfly, which have [[parallel evolution|independently evolved]] similar patterns. These butterflies are [[Müllerian mimicry|Müllerian mimics]] of each other, so natural selection is the driving force, but their wing patterns, which arose in separate evolutionary events, are controlled by the same genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Baxter, S.W. |author2=Papa, R. |author3=Chamberlain, N. |author4=Humphray, S.J. |author5=Joron, M. |author6=Morrison, C. |author7=ffrench-Constant, R.H. |author8=McMillan, W.O. |author9=Jiggins, C.D. |year=2008 |title=Convergent Evolution in the Genetic Basis of Mullerian Mimicry in Heliconius Butterflies |journal=Genetics |volume=180 |issue=3 |pages=1567–1577 | pmid=18791259 |pmc=2581958 | doi=10.1534/genetics.107.082982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Vajrayana}}
The '''pointing-out instruction''' (''ngo sprod'') is the direct introduction to the [[rigpa|nature of mind]] in the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] lineages of  [[Mahamudra|Mahāmudrā]] and [[Dzogchen]]. In these traditions, a "root guru"{{refn|group=note|(S. ''mūlaguru'', {{bo|w=rtsa-ba'i bla-ma}} [[THL Simplified Phonetic Transcription]] ''tsawé lama''}} gives the "pointing-out instruction" in such a way that the disciple successfully recognizes the "nature of mind."

The tradition of conferring such instructions outside the context of formal [[empowerment (Vajrayana)|empowerment]] ({{lang-sa|abhiṣeka}}) is unique to the [[Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]] lineages. Whether or not such instructions are valid without the formal empowerment has historically been a point of contention with the more conservative [[Gelug]] and [[Sakya]] lineages.  The pointing-out instruction is often equated with the fourth formal vajrayana empowerment.

==Terminology==

In the Mahāmudrā tradition, pointing-out instruction ({{bo|w=ngo sprod kyi gdams pa}} ''ngotrö kyi dampa'') is also referred to as "pointing out the nature of mind" ({{bo|w=sems kyi ngo sprod}} ''sem kyi ngotrö''), "pointing out transmission", or "introduction to the nature of mind".&lt;ref name="hayward106"&gt;Hayward (2008) p.106&lt;/ref&gt; In the Dzogchen tradition, the pointing out instructions are often called the “introduction to awareness” (''rig pa'i ngo sprod'', pronounced "rigpay notro")&lt;ref&gt;The Tibetan Tradition of the Great Perfection by Jean-Luc Achard (CNRS, Paris) pg 4 [https://www.scribd.com/doc/24054221/Achard-Jean-Luc-The-Tibetan-Tradition-of-the-Great-Perfection]&lt;/ref&gt; or "sems khrid," pronounced "sem tri".&lt;ref&gt;Germano, David F. (1994). "Architecture and Absence in the Secret Tantric History of rDzogs Chen". In The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, vol. 17.2, p 228 {{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/27399589/Architecture-and-Abscence-in-the-Secret-Tantric-History-of-the-Great-Perfection |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007232626/https://www.scribd.com/doc/27399589/Architecture-and-Abscence-in-the-Secret-Tantric-History-of-the-Great-Perfection |archivedate=2014-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Senior [[Shambhala Buddhism|Shambhala Buddhist]] teacher Jeremy Hayward describes this as 
{{quote|[A] direct pointing out of the nature of mind, that is mind's simplicity and universality—all appearances arise within the mind and in that sense there is nothing ''other'' than mind, yet mind itself is emptiness, openness beyond concept."&lt;ref name="hayward106" /&gt;}}

In the Mahāmudrā tradition, the mind pointed out is called "ordinary mind" ({{bo|w=tha mal gyi shes pa}} ''tamel gyi shépa'', Sanskrit: *''prākṛita-jñana'').&lt;ref&gt;''Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism'' by Chögyam Trungpa. Shambhala Publications: 2008 {{ISBN|978-1-59030-639-0}} Page 68&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche]] explains, 
{{quote|From the Mahamudra point of view, the nature of our mind is completely enlightened right from the beginning, and it is known as ordinary mind. In this context, 'ordinary' does not refer to mundane consciousness—a mind that  is totally caught up in this world of [[Saṃsāra|Samsara]]. Ordinary mind refers to Mind that is not fabricated in any way. It is the natural or fundamental state of our mind, totally free from all conceptual elaborations. It is the best part of Mind. When we experience this ordinary Mind, we experience buddha Mind. It does not matter how our mind is manifesting. Whether our thoughts and emotions are positive, negative, or neutral—that mind, in its essence, is totally free from all dualistic fixations.&lt;ref&gt;"Pointing Out Ordinary Mind" by Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche. in ''Buddhadharma: The Practitioner's Quarterly''. Fall 2009 [http://www.thebuddhadharma.com/web-archive/2009/9/1/pointing-out-ordinary-mind.html]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the Dzogchen tradition, knowledge of the basis pointed out is called ''[[rigpa]]'' ({{bo|w=rig pa}}, Sanskrit: *''vidya'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rigpa.org/en/about-rigpa.html Description of the word's meaning by Sogyal Rinpoche] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501132909/http://www.rigpa.org/en/about-rigpa.html |date=2012-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the pointing-out instruction is referred to as "the empowerment of vajra wisdom,"&lt;ref&gt;''Wild Awakening: The Heart of Mahamudra and Dzogchen'' by Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche Shambhala: 2003. {{ISBN|1-59030-096-3}} pg34&lt;/ref&gt; "vajrayana transmission" or "esoteric transmission," although these terms can also be applied to formal abhiṣeka as well.

==Mahāmudrā==
As scholar David Jackson describes, the particular Kagyu tradition of pointing-out instruction outside the tantras was popularized, if not originated, by [[Gampopa]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the special Great Seal (''phyag rgya chen po: mahāmudrā'') teachings for which sGam-po-pa was best known was his so-called "introduction to the [nature of] Mind" (''sems kyi ngo sprod''), by which the disciple was led to confront and directly recognize the nature of his or her mind. sGam-po-pa is said to have given such Great Seal instructions sometimes not as secret Vajrayana precepts in connection with initiation and special yogic practices, but rather as a Sūtra-based Great Seal instruction, or even as a doctrine going beyond both Sūtra and Tantra. Later critics such as Sa-skya Paṇḍita (or Sa-paṇ, as he was known for short) maintained, however, that all true Great Seal instructions were Mantrayana teachings that necessitated full, formal Tantric initiation into a maṇḍala. These masters denied in general the existence of any Sūtra-based or non-Tantric Great Seal, and in particular they considered the existence of any Mahāyāna doctrine outside the classes of Pāramitāyāna and Mantrayāna to be impossible.&lt;ref&gt;''Enlightenment By A Single: Means Tibetan Controversies on the "Self-Sufficient White Remedy" (dkar po chig thub)'' by David Jackson. VERLAG DER OSTERREICHISCHEN AKADEMIE DER WISSENSCHAFFEN. Vienna: 1994 {{ISBN|3-7001-2162-8}} pg &lt;sup&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/23509786/Enlightenment-by-a-Single-Means-Tibetan-Controversies-on-the-Self-Sufficient-White-Remedy]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jackson reports that, according to a number of Kagyu historians, Gampopa put particular emphasis on pointing out the nature of Mind. Jackson writes 
{{quote|rJe sGam-po-pa had discovered within himself the treasure of innate wisdom, and for him it was also essential to try to convey it to others. And convey it he did, on a scale never before attempted within his lineage. To do so, he bent the traditional rules restricting how certain Vajrayana teachings could be transmitted. He did this out of compassion for his students, in order to establish them in what was most important: profound meditative practice and insight."&lt;ref&gt;Jackson pg 14&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There is evidence that this practice derived from (unacknowledged) [[Zen#Ch.C3.A1n in China|Chan]] influence, a controversial issue in Tibet. As scholar Matthew Kapstein writes, the 
{{quote|... much contested doctrine sometimes called the 'mahamudra of the sutra tradition' (mdo-lugs phyag-chen) [...] was said to bring about direct insight into the ultimate nature of Mind, owing to the impact of an 'introduction' (ngo-sprod; see chapter 10) conferred by one's teacher, without the disciple's having first traversed the entire sequence of tantric initiation and yogic practice [...] &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Gampopa and other Kagyüpa teachers&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; certainly wished to avoid suggesting that what they were teaching was a rehashing of the Chinese Chan doctrine, which after all had been condemned in the Kadampa tradition of the eleventh-century teacher Potowa (1027 or 1031–1105), a tradition with which Gampopa was himself closely affiliated.&lt;br&gt;This ploy, however, was not fully successful. Sakya Paṇḍita (1182–1251), for one, recognized very clearly that the Kagyüpa teaching drew some of its inspiration from such sources, and so he castigated its 'sutra tradition of the mahamudra' as what he termed, with apparent derision, 'Chinese Great Perfection' (''Rgya-nag rdzogs-chen'')."&lt;ref&gt;"The Tibetan Assimilation of Buddhism: Conversion, Contestation, and Memory" by Matthew T. Kapstein. Oxford University Press, USA {{ISBN|0-19-513122-3}} pg 77&lt;/ref&gt;}}

How much of a departure this in fact represented from the Indian model has been a subject of ongoing research. As scholar Klaus-Dieter Mathes has found:
{{quote|Certain aspects of the Bka´ brgyud teachings on mahāmudrā, such as the possibility of a sudden liberating realization or the possibility that a beginner may attain mahāmudrā even without Tantric initiation, became a highly controversial issue in the 13th century. For Sa skya Paṇḍita (1182–1251), such teachings represented a new development stemming from a Sino-Tibetan influence on Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen (1079–1153). Later Bka´ brgyud pas defended their not specifically Tantric or sūtra mahāmudrā tradition by adducing Indian sources such as the Tattvadaśakaṭīkā or the Tattvāvatāra. These belong to a genre of literature which the Seventh Karmapa Chos grags rgya mtsho (1454–1506) called “Indian mahāmudrā-Works” (phyag chen rgya gzhung) [...] Dr. Mathes investigated the practice described in these mahāmudrā works and found that it is not necessarily Tantric. In Saraha´s dohās it is simply the realization of Mind´s co-emergent nature with the help of a genuine guru. [[Maitripa|Maitrīpa]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Maitripa&lt;/ref&gt; (ca. 1007– ca. 1085) uses the term mahāmudrā for precisely such an approach, thus employing an originally Tantric term for something that is not a specifically Tantric practice. It is thus legitimate for later Bka´ brgyud pas to speak of Saraha´s mahāmudrā tradition as being originally independent of the Sūtras and the Tantras. For Maitrīpa, the direct realization of emptiness (or the co-emergent) is the bridging link between the Sūtras and the Tantras, and it is thanks to this bridge that Mahāmudrā can be linked to the Sūtras and the Tantras. In the Sūtras it takes the form of the practice of non-abiding and becoming mentally disengaged, while in the Tantras it occupies a special position among the four mudrās.&lt;ref&gt;"Indian Mahāmudrā-Works” in the Early Bka’ brgyud pa." Centre for Tantric Studies website. {{cite web |url=http://www.tantric-studies.org/projects/indian-mahamudra-in-early-kagyu/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820095822/http://www.tantric-studies.org/projects/indian-mahamudra-in-early-kagyu/ |archivedate=2008-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to scholar Trungram Gyaltrul Rinpoche Sherpa, introduction (''ngo sprod'') 
{{quote|... is explained by Gampopa as being of five types:&lt;br&gt;1) introduction of appearance as mind through the analogy of sleep and dream,&lt;br&gt;2) introduction of the inseparability of appearance and emptiness through the analogy of water and ice,&lt;br&gt;3) introduction of mind-as-such as empty through the analogy of empty sky,&lt;br&gt;4) introduction of multiplicity as being one taste through the analogy of the taste of a cake of raw sugar."&lt;ref&gt;"Gampopa, the Monk and the Yogi: His Life and Teachings." by Trungram Gyaltrul Rinpoche Sherpa. PhD dissertation, Harvard:2004 pg 175&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Trungram notes that Gampopa uses 
{{quote|"terms we find in the Mahāmudrā instruction of Saraha, Maitrīpa, and sometimes Tillipa. But his actual instruction is marked by one major difference: Gampopa ignores the methodical mantric path we find in his predecessors" and "taught openly in public, without testing the spiritual capacity of his students [...] the permissibility of teaching Gampopa's Mahāmudrā to the masses . . . lead us to view his publicly taught Mahāmudrā as a sutra teaching."&lt;ref&gt;Trungram pg 176&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The mahāmudrā tradition also includes a "fourfold pointing-out instructions" (pointing out the nature of Mind on the basis of appearances) presented by Karmapa [[Wangchuk Dorje]] in his three texts on mahāmudrā.

==Dzogchen==
{{see also|Direct Introduction}}
In the Dzogchen tradition, the pointing out instructions are more often called the “introduction to awareness” (''rig pa'i ngo sprod'', pronounced "rigpay notro")&lt;ref&gt;"The Tibetan Tradition of the Great Perfection" by Jean-Luc Achard (CNRS, Paris) pg 4&lt;sup&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/24054221/Achard-Jean-Luc-The-Tibetan-Tradition-of-the-Great-Perfection]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or "direct introduction" (Tibetan: ངོ་སྤྲོད་སྤྲས་པ, Wylie: ''ngo sprod spras pa'', literally "directly encountering one's own state"). The "Empowerment of Awareness" ({{bo|w=rig pa'i rtsal dbang}}, pronounced "rigpay sall wahng") is a technical term employed within the Dzogchen lineages for a particular lineage of empowerment propagated by [[Jigme Lingpa]]. This empowerment consists of the direct introduction of the student to the intrinsic nature of their own mind-essence, [[rigpa]], by their empowering master.&lt;ref name="DharmaFellowship"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dharmafellowship.org/biographies/historicalsaints/pramodavajra.htm |title=Biographies: Pramodavajra, Regent of the Divine|accessdate=2007-11-15 |work=Dharma Fellowship of His Holiness the Gwayala Karmapa|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albion Moonlight Butters notes, 
{{quote|Students of ''rDzogs chen'' are repeatedly reminded of the inherent perfection of the beginningless beginning. The primary purpose of the guru's pointing out instructions--be they verbal or symbolic or telepathic--is to provide a taste of this, to introduce the student to his or her own natural awareness. From there, one needs only to sustain that way of being (''gnas lugs''), deepening the experience until all things have that unitary taste (''ro gcig'').&lt;ref&gt;The Doxographical Genius of Kunmkhyen kLong chen rab 'byams pa. by Albion Moonlight Butters. PhD dissertation, Columbia: 2006 pg 267&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Sogyal Rinpoche]] describes the pointing out instructions given by Patrul Rinpoche to Nyoshul Lungtok:
:Nyoshul Lungtok, who later became one of the greatest Dzogchen masters of recent times, followed his teacher Patrul Rinpoche for about eighteen years. During all that time, they were almost inseparable. Nyoshul Lungtok studied and practiced extremely diligently, and accumulated a wealth of purification, merit, and practice; he was ready to recognize the Rigpa, but had not yet had the final introduction. Then, one famous evening, Patrul Rinpoche gave him the introduction. It happened when they were staying together in one of the hermitages high up in the mountains above Dzogchen Monastery. It was a very beautiful night. The dark blue sky was clear and the stars shone brilliantly. The sound of their solitude was heightened by the distant barking of a dog from the monastery below. Patrul Rinpoche was lying stretched out on the ground, doing a special Dzogchen practice. He called Nyoshul Lungtok over to him, saying: "Did you say you do not know the essence of Mind?" Nyoshul Lungtok guessed from his tone that this was a special moment and nodded expectantly.

:"There's nothing to it really," Patrul Rinpoche said casually, and added, "My son, come and lie down over here: be like your old father." Nyoshul Lungtok stretched out by his side. Then Patrul Rinpoche asked him, "Do you see the stars up there in the sky?"
:"Yes."
:"Do you hear the dogs barking in Dzogchen Monastery?"
:"Yes."
:"Do you hear what I'm saying to you?"
:"Yes."
:"Well, the nature of Dzogchen is this: simply this."
:Nyoshul Lungtok tells us what happened then: "At that instant, I arrived at a certainty of realization from within. I had been liberated from the fetters of 'it is' and 'it is not.' I had realized the primordial wisdom, the naked union of emptiness and intrinsic awareness. I was introduced to this realization by his blessing, as the great Indian master Saraha said: He in whose heart the words of the master have entered, Sees the truth like a treasure in his own palm."&lt;ref&gt;The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying: Revised and Updated Edition. by Sogyal Rinpoche (Author), Patrick D. Gaffney (Editor), Andrew Harvey (Editor) HarperOne: 1994. {{ISBN|0-06-250834-2}} pg. 160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Effectivity==
According to Dzogchen master [[Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche]], 
{{quote|Once one has received the pointing-out instruction there is the chance of either recognizing it or not."&lt;ref&gt;Interview for ''Vajradhatu Sun'', 1985&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.rangjung.com/authors/tulku_urgyen_rinpoche-interview.htm]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bruce Newman, a long-time student of Tulku Urgyen's son, [[Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche]], describes the possible responses of the student to the pointing out instruction:

:So at this point one of two things may have happened: You've had some experience that you think or hope is the experience, or you haven't. If you haven't, you can report, "Rinpoche, I've been trying to meditate on what you said when you said, 'Mind is empty.' But nothing has happened. I don't understand{{mdash}}I have no idea what you're talking about! Can you give me one word of advice on how to proceed?" Then you take that advice and start all over. A word of caution: he may not answer you straight away. He might say that you have to do some other practice, such as the preliminary practices, to clear away obstacles to your understanding. Complete these practices to his satisfaction then report back for further clarification and instruction, for however long it takes. At this point you'll know that your practice is proceeding in the right direction.

:If you had some experience, report back for confirmation. Don't assume you've understood. There are countless ways to get it wrong, and if you do, it will make the rest of your practice wobbly, since it will based on a wrong view. It would be like building a house on a rotten foundation.

:When you report back, you can say, "Rinpoche, in your teaching you said that Mind was empty. Since then I've been trying to meditate on your words and I've had the following experience..." It's very difficult to put these kinds of experiences into words, but please try; it's really worth the effort. Study helps here{{mdash}}it provides you with the vocabulary to explain yourself. So you might ask, "Is this really it?" He might ask you several questions, often to discern whether you're talking about a real experience or mostly mixing it up with what you've read or heard. If he says "no," "not quite," etc., then you go back to the beginning. If it's a definite "yes," then ask for further clarification, some instruction on how to proceed. Even if you have recognized and your teacher has unequivocally confirmed your recognition, there's still much more to learn. First are the techniques for repeating and stabilizing the recognition. (This is, of course, many lifetimes of work!) Second, there will be doubts, and you'll have experiences you're not sure how to categorize. "Was that last experience really rigpa? Perhaps it wasn't empty enough." This can go on for a long time. The doubting and questioning can start to become problematic after a while, but it's very necessary in the beginning to make sure you have it right.&lt;ref&gt;''A Beginner's Guide To Tibetan Buddhism'' by Bruce Newman. Snow Lion Publications. 1559392118&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.snowlionpub.com/pages/N66_5.html]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Orgyen Tobgyal Rinpoche, few contemporary disciples are capable of recognition, even when receiving pointing out instructions from superior masters:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Once I witnessed Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche give the pointing out instruction to a gathering of more than one thousand people in Taiwan. He still gave the real thing nakedly and directly, leaving nothing out. This must exemplify what they call the 'expression of compassionate capacity,' for he rose to the occasion out of the power of his realization. He said, 'The oral instruction is like a candle: you can see while you hold it, and when you give it away you have no more light. But since all of you have taken the trouble to come here, expecting to hear me speak, I feel that I cannot refuse giving you the pointing-out instruction.' Then he gave the instruction in coming face to face with your own nature. Even if the great Khyentse, Kongtrül or Longchenpa were doing so, it wouldn't surpass his instruction. Yet I later met only a few there who truly recognized their own nature. Even among Rinpoche's Western students there were some very close disciples who definitely should have recognized their buddha nature. They probably had some vague glimpse of recognition; yet they use empty words, and ignore the consequences of their actions. I have yet to meet one who has fully realized his teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Kyabje Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche: Essays and interviews by ten lamas surrounding the passing of a great master&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.gomde.dk/pages/interviews/turgyen/9-lamas.htm#8 Spoken by Orgyen Tobgyal Rinpoche]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche characterizes recognition as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Receiving pointing-out instructions is similar to watching a movie preview. Unless we see the preview, we have no idea what the movie will be about. So a preview is an excellent way to be introduced to what a particular movie might be like. We might see the preview and then decide to skip the film{{mdash}}that is up to us. No one is going to force us to sit through the whole movie.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Similarly, we get a preview of the Mahamudra experience when we receive the pointing-out instructions from our guru. They give us a glimpse or flash experience of Mahamudra. They give us a sense of direction and motivate us to go further; however, it is up to us to extend our exploration so that we eventually come to a genuine realization of Mahamudra. Without this flash experience, we would have no way to be exposed to the nature of Mind so directly, so nakedly. That flash is a transmission of the lineage, a wonderful blessing through which we are introduced to the deeper experience and realization of the Mahamudra path. This shows how necessary it is to rely on the lineage transmission and to be connected to a genuine lineage master. Without the pure and genuine lineage, without a qualified lineage master, we would have no way to experience such a preview, such a flash experience.&lt;ref&gt;"Pointing Out Ordinary Mind" by Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche. in ''Buddhadharma: The Practitioner's Quarterly''. Fall 2009&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.thebuddhadharma.com/issues/2009/fall/ordinary.php]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Secrecy==
This conspicuous aspect of Vajrayana Buddhism is [[esoteric]].  In this context esoteric means that the transmission of certain accelerating factors only occurs directly from teacher to student during an initiation and cannot be simply learned from a book. The term [[adhisthana]] (literally "blessing") refers to the spiritual energy that is received in the [[mindstream]] of the aspirant when successful transmission takes place.

Many techniques are also commonly said to be secret, but some Vajrayana teachers have responded that the secrecy itself is not important but only a side-effect of the reality that the techniques have no validity outside the teacher-student lineage.  As these techniques are said to be highly effective, when not practiced properly, the practitioner can be harmed physically and mentally. In order to avoid these kind of dangers, the practice is kept secret.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

According to the Dalai Lama in the "Tradition of Mahamudra":&lt;ref&gt;[http://studybuddhism.com/web/en/archives/e-books/published_books/gelug_kagyu_mahamudra/pt4/mm_15.html Gelug-Kagyu Tradition of Mahamudra]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Kagyu system refers to those who manifest clear light mind by relying on the methods for penetrating vital points of the external and internal body as those who progress through graded stages of methods. Such practitioners manifest clear light mind by progressing through stages. Those with sharp faculties, however, may be practitioners for whom everything happens at once. The Nyingma tradition of dzogchen also distinguishes between these two types of practitioners. Those who manifest rigpa, pure awareness, by training through stages involving various practices with the energy-winds, tummo, and so forth are those who progress through graded stages, while those for whom everything happens at once achieve the same by relying solely on meditation on a nonconceptual state of mental consciousness without the practices of the energy channels and energy-winds.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to one Kagyu text, the method of practice of those for whom everything happens at once is powerful medicine. But it is deadly poison for those who progress through graded stages. In other words, the method of practice of meditating solely on the nonconceptual state of the mind is suited only for those of sharpest faculties. For those who are not of their level, such practice brings only harm, no benefit. For them the medicine acts like a poison.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Kaydrub Norzang-gyatso, in ''A Lamp for Clarifying Mahamudra to Establish the Single Intention of the Kagyu and Gelug Traditions'', has explained that those for whom everything happens at once are persons who have trained extensively through stages either in previous lives or earlier in this life. As a result, meditation on the nonconceptual state of the mind, without need to rely on any further meditation on penetrating vital points of the vajra-body, alone causes clear light mind to manifest so that everything happens at once. Such meditation does this by acting as a circumstance for triggering the ripening of potentials built up from previous practice with energy-winds and so forth, so that they automatically enter, abide and dissolve in the central energy-channel. If a practitioner has not built up these potentials, then no matter how intensively he or she may focus in a nonconceptual state of mind, this person is unable to manifest clear light mind or pure awareness. They lack sufficient causes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Polyculturalism is an ideological approach to the consequences of intercultural engagements within a geographical area which emphasises similarities between, and the enduring interconnectedness of, groups which self-identify as distinct, thus blurring the boundaries which may be perceived by members of those groups.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal&amp;Levy2010"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1751-2409.2010.01022.x|title=The Colorblind, Multicultural, and Polycultural Ideological Approaches to Improving Intergroup Attitudes and Relations|journal=Social Issues and Policy Review|volume=4|pages=215–246|year=2010|last1=Rosenthal|first1=Lisa|last2=Levy|first2=Sheri R}}&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from [[multiculturalism]] which instead emphasises the separateness of the identities of self-identifying cultural groups with an aim of preserving and celebrating their differences in spite of interactions between them. Supporters of polyculturalism oppose multiculturalism, arguing that the latter's emphasis on difference and separateness is divisive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hikevipadan.blogspot.com//%7B%7Bfull%7D%7D|title=Polyculturalism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sbs.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/topics/life/culture/article/2017/06/07/if-multiculturalism-isnt-working-why-not-embrace-polyculturalism%7B%7Bfull%7D%7D|title=Latest News &amp; Opinion on Culture &amp; Social Affairs - SBS Life|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and harmful to social cohesion.&lt;ref name="JP&amp;MA2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Podur|first1=Justin|last2=Albert|first2=Michael|date=15 July 2003|title=Revolutionizing Culture Part One|url=https://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/10125|journal=Podur ZMag|volume=|issue=|pages=|doi=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611094904/https://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/10125|archive-date=11 Jun 2008|access-date=17 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept of polyculturalism was first proposed by [[Robin Kelley]] and [[Vijay Prashad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/cultures-fuse-and-connect-so-we-should-embrace-polyculturalism-78876|title=Cultures fuse and connect, so we should embrace polyculturalism|first=Nick|last=Haslam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Links to Other Areas of Thought==
Research has shown that belief in polyculturalism is linked to cultural intelligence (CQ) in [[Australia]] and [[China]].&lt;ref name="BP2017"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2017.08.006|title=Belief in polyculturalism and cultural intelligence: Individual- and country-level differences|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=119|pages=307–310|year=2017|last1=Bernardo|first1=Allan B.I|last2=Presbitero|first2=Alfred}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows that polyculturists are less likely to demonstrate [[sexism|sexist]] attitudes.&lt;ref name="RLM2017"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0361684313510152 |pmid=25530662 |pmc=4266561 |title=Polyculturalism and Sexist Attitudes |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=519–534 |year=2014 |last1=Rosenthal |first1=Lisa |last2=Levy |first2=Sheri R |last3=Militano |first3=Maria }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has shown that polyculturalism has a positive relationship with cross-cultural attitudes in both the [[Philippines]] and the [[United States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijintrel.2012.12.005 |title=Polyculturalism and attitudes towards people from other countries |journal=International Journal of Intercultural Relations |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=335–344 |year=2013 |last1=Bernardo |first1=Allan B.I |last2=Rosenthal |first2=Lisa |last3=Levy |first3=Sheri R }}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Comparison of Cultural Ideologies==

{{refimprove-section|date=August 2018}}
{{Expand section|date=August 2018}}

Like advocates of [[multiculturalism]], proponents of polyculturalism encourage individuals to learn about different cultures, especially those they may come into contact with in their own areas.&lt;ref name="JK" /&gt; However whereas multiculturalism advocates for toleration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040823095427/http://www.semcoop.com/detail/0807050105%7B%7Bfull%7D%7D|title=Wayback Machine|date=23 August 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; between members of distictly different cultures groups, polyculturalism is less rigid and acknowledges that individual shape their own identities and may choose to change&lt;ref name="JP&amp;MA2003" /&gt; so as to express their culture in a different way to their own ancestors, either by adding elements of other cultures to it or by eliminating aspects of it.&lt;ref name="JK" /&gt;

Polyculturalism rejects the concept of race as a [[social construct]] with no scientific basis,&lt;ref name="JK"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Korber |first1=John |last2= |first2= |date= |title=Polyculturalism |url=http://members.aol.com/Jakajk/Oneworld.html |journal=One World One People |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014230838/http://members.aol.com/Jakajk/Oneworld.html |archive-date=14 Oct 2008 |access-date=17 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; however it recognises the concept of ethnicity&lt;ref name="AG"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gibbons |first1=Andrea |last2= |first2= |date= |title=Vijay Prashad: Polyculturalism and Kung Fu |url=http://writingcities.com/2016/09/27/vijay-prashad-polyculturalism-kung-fu/ |dead-url= |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, considering ethno-nationalism a barrier which must be transcended in the pursuit of a dynamic community culture.

Critics of [[multiculturalism]] argue that it entrenches [[identity politics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0026490 |pmid=22250894 |title=The relation between polyculturalism and intergroup attitudes among racially and ethnically diverse adults |journal=Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=1–16 |year=2012 |last1=Rosenthal |first1=Lisa |last2=Levy |first2=Sheri R }}&lt;/ref&gt; while polyculturalism aims to forge a common new identity&lt;ref name="sbs.com.au"/&gt;

Polyculturalism acknowledges that cultures are dynamic, interactive and impure while [[multiculturalism]] treats them as static, isolated and complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Haslam |first1=Nick |title=Cultures fuse and connect, so we should embrace polyculturalism |url=https://theconversation.com/cultures-fuse-and-connect-so-we-should-embrace-polyculturalism-78876 |website=The Conversation |accessdate=25 August 2018 |language=en |date=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contains special characters}}
'''''Samayasāra''''' (''The Nature of the Self'') is a famous [[Jain text]] composed by ''[[Kundakunda|Acharya Kundakunda]]'' in 439 verses.{{sfn|Jaini|1991|p=33}} Its ten chapters discuss the nature of ''[[Jīva (Jainism)|Jīva]]'' (pure self/soul), its attachment to [[Karma in Jainism|Karma]] and [[Moksha (Jainism)|Moksha]] (liberation). ''Samayasāra'' expounds the Jain concepts like ''[[Karma in Jainism|Karma]]'', ''[[Asrava]]'' (influx of ''karmas''), [[Bandha (Jainism)|Bandha]] (Bondage), ''[[Samvara]]'' (stoppage), ''[[Nirjara]]'' (shedding) and [[Moksha (Jainism)|Moksha]] (complete annihilation of ''karmas'').

Jainism says that shedding ''karmas'' i.e. getting rid of ''karmas'' leads to ''Moksha'' (liberation, salvation). ''Samayasāra'', in its ''Nirjara'' (shedding) chapter describes that shedding of ''karmas'' happens when a person observes both pleasant and unpleasant sensations without any ''Raag'' (attachment) and ''dveśa'' (aversion).

==Contents==

=== Invocation ===
The first verse ([[aphorism]]) of the ''Samayasāra'' is an invocation: {{quote|O bhavyas (potential aspirants to liberation)! Making obeisance to all the Siddhas, established in the fifth state of existence that is eternal, immutable, and incomparable (perfection par excellence), I will articulate this Samayaprābhrita, which has been propounded by the all-knowing Masters of Scripture.{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=1}}}}

===The Soul===
{{Main|Jīva (Jainism)}}
According to ''Samayasāra'', the real self is only that soul which has achieved [[ratnatraya]] i.e. Samyak Darshan, Samyak Gyan and Samyak Charitra. These state when soul achieves purity is [[Arihant (Jainism)|Arihant]] and [[Siddha]].{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=3}} It can be achieved by victory over five senses.

===The Soul and the Non-Soul===

===The Doer and the Karma===

===Merit and Demerit===

===Influx of Karmas===

===Stoppage of Karmas===

According to ''Samayasāra'':{{quote|The Self, by his own enterprise, protecting himself from virtuous as well as wicked activities that cause merit and demerit, and stationing himself in right faith and knowledge, detached from body and desires etc., devoid of external and internal attachments, contemplates on the Self, through his own Self, and does not reflect upon the karmas and the quasi-karmic matter (''nokarma''); the Self with such distinctive qualities experiences oneness with the Self. Such a Self, contemplating on the Self, becomes of the nature of right faith and knowledge, and being immersed in the Self, attains, in a short span of time, status of the Pure Self that is free from all ''karmas''.|''Samayasāra'' (187-189){{sfn|Jain|2012|p=91}}}}

===Shedding of Karmas===

===Bondage of Karmas===

===The Liberation===

===The All-pure Knowledge===

==Commentaries==
It has a number of commentaries on it including Atmakhyati of Acharya [[Amritchandra]] and Natak Samayasar of [[Banarasidas]].

[[Image:Judith Leyster Serenade.jpg|right|thumb|[[Serenade by Leyster|''Serenade'']] by [[Judith Leyster]].]]
In [[music]], a '''serenade''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|ɛr|ə|ˈ|n|eɪ|d}}; also sometimes called '''''serenata''''', from the [[:it:Serenata (musica)|Italian]]) is a [[musical composition]] and/or [[performance]] delivered in [[honor]] of someone or something. Serenades are typically calm, light pieces of music. The term comes from the [[Italian language|Italian]] word {{wiktit|serenata}}, which itself derives from the [[Latin]] {{wiktla|serenus}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Hubert Unverricht &amp; Cliff Eisen. “Serenade”. Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. 8 December 2009. | url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/25454|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early serenade music==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}
In the oldest usage, which survives in informal form to the present day, a serenade is a musical greeting performed for a lover, friend, person of rank or other person to be honored. The classic usage would be from a lover to his lady love through a window. It was considered an evening piece, one to be performed on a quiet and pleasant evening, as opposed to an [[aubade]], which would be performed in the morning. The custom of serenading in this manner began in the [[Medieval music|Medieval]] era, and the word "serenade" as commonly used in current [[English language|English]] is related to this custom. Music performed followed no one particular form, except that it was typically sung by one person accompanying himself on a portable instrument, most likely a guitar, lute or other plucked instrument. Works of this type also appeared in later eras, but usually in a context that referred specifically to a past time, such as [[aria]]s in an [[opera]] (there is a famous example in [[Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]''). [[Carl Maria von Weber]] composed his serenade for voice and guitar, "Horch'! Leise horch', Geliebte!" (1809).

==Baroque era==
[[File:Nellie Bly-6m-in-Mexico-14.jpg|thumb|A young woman being serenaded by a man in the street below]]
In the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] era, a '''''serenata'''''—which the form was called since it occurred most frequently in Italy and Vienna—was a typically celebratory or eulogistic dramatic [[cantata]] for two or more singers and orchestra, performed outdoors in the evening by artificial light.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Talbot, "Serenata", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (musicologist)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Some composers of this type of serenade include [[Alessandro Stradella]], [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], [[Johann Joseph Fux]], [[Johann Mattheson]], and [[Antonio Caldara]]. Often these were large-scale works performed with minimal staging, intermediate between a ''cantata'' and an [[opera]]. The main difference between a ''cantata'' and a serenata, around 1700, was that the ''serenata'' was performed outdoors and therefore could use instruments which would be too loud in a small room (for example, [[Natural trumpet|trumpet]]s, [[Natural horn|horns]], and [[drum]]s).{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Classical and Romantic eras==
The most important and prevalent type of serenade in music history is a work for large instrumental ensemble in multiple movements, related to the [[divertimento]], and mainly being composed in the [[Classical music era|Classical]] and [[Romantic music|Romantic]] periods, though a few examples exist from the 20th century. Usually the character of the work is lighter than other multiple-movement works for large ensemble (for example the [[symphony]]), with tunefulness being more important than thematic development or dramatic intensity. Most of these works are from [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Bohemia]].

Among the most famous examples of the serenade from the 18th century are those by [[Mozart]], whose serenades typically comprise between four and ten movements. His serenades were often purely instrumental pieces, written for special occasions such as those commissioned for wedding ceremonies. Famous serenades by Mozart include the ''Haffner'' Serenade, the ''[[Serenade No. 6 (Mozart)|Serenata notturna]]'', and one of his most famous works, ''[[Eine Kleine Nachtmusik]].'' The last two of these, had they been written earlier in the century, would have been atypical for using only [[string instrument]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Unverricht and Cliff Eisen, “Serenade”, ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (musicologist)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers).&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 19th century, the serenade had transformed into a concert work, and was less associated with outdoor performance for honorary occasions. Composers began to write serenades for other ensembles. The two serenades by [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] are rather like light symphonies, perhaps more closely related to suites, except that they use an ensemble such as Mozart would have recognized: a small orchestra (in the case of the Serenade No. 2, an orchestra entirely without [[violin]]s). [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]], [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], [[Josef Suk (composer)|Josef Suk]], [[Edward Elgar]], and others wrote serenades for strings only, as did [[Hugo Wolf]], who wrote one for string quartet (the ''[[Italian Serenade (Wolf)|Italian Serenade]]''). Other composers to write serenades in a Romantic style include [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], [[Hector Berlioz]], [[Franz Schubert]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Max Reger]], [[Ethel Smyth]] and [[Jean Sibelius]].

==20th century==
Some examples of serenades in the 20th century include the ''[[Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings]]'' by [[Benjamin Britten]], the [[Serenade (Stravinsky)|Serenade in A]] for [[piano]] by [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]], the Serenade for [[baritone]] and [[septet]], Op. 24 by [[Arnold Schoenberg]], and the movement entitled "Serenade" in [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]]'s last string quartet, [[String Quartet No. 15 (Shostakovich)|No. 15]] (1974). [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] wrote a ''[[Serenade to Music]]'' (for 16 solo voices and orchestra) that premiered in 1938, while [[Leonard Bernstein]] composed his ''[[Serenade after Plato's "Symposium"]]'' (for solo violin, strings harp and percussion) in 1954. These modern serenades are freely explored adaptations to the serenade's original formal layout and instrumentation.

==Form==
A serenade is commonly of a multi-movement structure, ranging anywhere from four to up to ten movements. They usually are constructed with a fast opening movement, followed by middle slow movements that alternate with fast ones and close with a fast presto or [[Allegro (music)|allegro]] movement. There are strong influences from chamber music, and serenades can be subtly inserted into a chamber music program. A serenade can be considered somewhere in between a suite and a symphony, but is usually of a light and romantic nature—casual and without too many overly dramatic moments.&lt;ref&gt;Lynan, Peter. “Serenade.” ''The Oxford Companion to Music''. Ed. Alison Latham. Oxford Music Online. 8 December 2009. http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t114/e6099&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2920">{{nihongo|'''Taizō-in'''|退蔵院}} is the oldest sub-temple ({{nihongo|''tatchū''|塔頭}}) of the [[Myōshin-ji]] [[Rinzai]] [[Zen]] [[Buddhist]] temple, situated in the northwest of [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]]. It was founded by Zen priest [[Muinsoin]] in 1404.   The original temple buildings were burned during the [[Ōnin War]] (1467-1477), and were later rebuilt.  

Taizō-in is well known for its two gardens.  The main garden, Motonobu-no-niwa, is a traditional Japanese [[Japanese rock garden|dry landscape garden]] (''karesansui''), containing several angular rocks suggesting the cliffs of the island of [[Hōrai]], with smaller stones suggesting a stream.  The planting is mostly [[evergreen]], including [[camellia]], [[pine]], and [[Japanese umbrella pine]].  It covers 50 [[tsubo]] (170 m²) and was designed to integrate a [[borrowing of scenery ("shakkei")]] of a view of [[Narabigaoka Hill]] in the distance.  It is thought to be the final work of [[Muromachi]] painter [[Kanō Motonobu]] (狩野 元信), reproducing one of his paintings in three dimensions.

A new pond garden, or yoko-en, was designed by [[Kinsaku Nakane]] in 1963-1966.  The new garden is large enough for visitors to walk in, and contains [[azalea]]s and a stream that cascades along the main axis, directly toward the main viewing position.  The stream flows around rocks, gradually widening until it empties into a pool in front of the viewer.

[[Image:Hyônen zu by Josetsu.jpg|thumb|right|''Catching catfish with a gourd'' (Hyonen zu) by Josetsu]]

Taizō-in holds one of Japan's oldest ink paintings, {{nihongo|''Catching catfish with a gourd''|紙本墨画淡彩瓢鮎図|shihon bokuga tansai hyōnenzu}}, c.1413, by {{nihongo|[[Josetsu]]|如拙}}, which is a [[National Treasures of Japan|National Treasure of Japan]].  It is identified as a turning point in [[Muromachi]] painting, and represents a Zen [[koan]].

'''''The Ethics of Immigration''''' is a September 2013 book by the philosopher [[Joseph Carens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Ethics of Immigration (Oxford Political Theory)|date = September 19, 2013|last = Carens|first = Joseph|publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]|isbn = 0199933839}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure of the book==

The first eight chapters of the book argue for a robust system of migrant rights and equal treatment of migrants and natives, while conceding the legitimacy of nation-states and their discretionary control over migration. The ninth and tenth chapter discuss illegal immigrants, family reunification, and refugees. The eleventh chapter argues for [[open border]]s, and challenges the presumption of discretionary control over migration, while still staying within the framework of legitimacy of nation-states.&lt;ref name=bertram/&gt;

==Reception==

===Interviews and self-promotion===

[[Dylan Matthews]] interviewed Carens on his book for the ''Wonkblog'' section of the ''[[Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/11/29/what-gives-us-a-right-to-deport-people-joseph-carens-on-the-ethics-of-immigration/|title = What gives us a right to deport people?

{{Tibetan Buddhism}}

'''Tsikey Chokling Rinpoche'''&lt;ref&gt;Urgyen, Tulku (2007), Blazing Splendor, Rangjung Yeshe Publications, p. xii, 362-3; {{ISBN|978-962-7341-56-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a teacher, writer, religious ritual master,  and meditation master of the [[Nyingma]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].

There are four schools of Tibetan Buddhism which originated in the country of Tibet. The Nyingma school is the oldest of the four schools and stems from circa 800 A.D. when the master known as Guru Rinpoche came to Tibet and established Samye Monastery there. Numerous reincarnation lineages were created over the next few hundred years as an individual would want to  continue the work of his life in a future life by being reincarnated and recognized by his students or teachers and trained again and then continue his work. This is most well known with the monk and political and religious teacher known as  the [[Dalai Lama]].

Tsikey Chokling Rinpoche has been recognized by the Karmapa as the fourth reincarnation of the 19th-century "treasure-discoverer" ([[tertön]]) [[Chokgyur Lingpa]] and is a holder of his [[Chokling Tersar]] lineage of teachings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shedrub.org/teacherpage.php?tid=3 Ka-Nying Shedrup Ling Website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311043930/http://www.shedrub.org/teacherpage.php?tid=3 |date=2015-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lama Kunsang, Lama Pemo, Marie Aubele and Jonathan C. Bell (Apr 16, 2012), History Of The Karmapas: The Odyssey Of The Tibetan Masters With The Black Crown, p. 269; {{ISBN|9781559393904}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently the master of [[Vajrayana]] ceremonies at [[Ka-Nying Shedrup Ling]] monastery and of several other monasteries in [[Nepal]]. He also oversees monasteries, nunneries, and practice centers in [[Tibet]], [[India]], [[Bhutan]], and [[Sikkim]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shedrub.org Shedrub Development Mandala http://www.shedrub.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lionsroar.com/tsikey-chokling-rinpoche-teaching-across-north-america-and-europe/ Lion's Roar, Publication by Shambhala Sun Publications, online article from June 7, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; He has published two books.&lt;ref&gt;Rinpoche, Chokling (2008), The Great Gate: A Guidebook to the Guru's Heart Practice, Dispeller of All Obstacles, Rangjung Yeshe Publications. {{ISBN|962-7341-04-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rinpoche, Chokling (2001), Lotus Ocean: Seeds of the Sublime Dharma, Rangjung Yeshe Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rangjung.com/books/lotus-ocean.htm Lotus Ocean from Rangjung Yeshe Publications]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rangjung.com/authors/Tsikey_Chokling_Rinpoche_interview.htm Tsikey Chokling Rinpoche's Interview for Rabsel Tibetan Buddhist Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tricycle.com/feature/keys-happiness Tricycle Magazine Interview with his son, Phakchok Rinpoche, mentioning Tsikey Chokling Rinpoche]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche]], Tibetan [[Dzogchen]] meditation teacher to many students, including the [[16th Karmapa]], is the father of Tsikey Chokling Rinpoche.&lt;ref&gt;Doctor, Andreas (2013), Tibetan Treasure Literature: Revelation, Tradition, and Accomplishment in Visionary Buddhism, Snow Lion Publications, p. 12; {{ISBN|978-1559392365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Urgyen Tulku (2006), Quintessential Dzogchen: Confusion Dawns as Wisdom, Rangjung Yeshe Publications, p. 281-282, {{ISBN|9627341584}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cglf.org/our-lineage/kyabje-tsikey-chokling-rinpoche Biography of Tsikey Chokling Rinpoche]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marcia Binder Schmidt (2002), The Dzogchen Primer: Embracing The Spiritual Path According To The Great Perfection.

== Activities ==
Tsikey Chokling Rinpoche through his foundation, The [[Chokgyur Lingpa Foundation]], supports both many different projects including religious, humanitarian, and educational projects through the Monastic Education Fund. The healthcare projects are aimed at providing treatments throughout Nepal where needed, as well as longer-term healthcare improvement, through the Vajra Varahi Healthcare Clinic, the annual Dental and Medical Camps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cglf.org/projects Chokgyur Lingpa Foundation: Projects] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130830004233/http://cglf.org/projects |date=2013-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation hosts publication teams through Lhasey Lotsawa Translations &amp; Publications, a growing team of translators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lhaseylotsawa.org/ Lhasey Lotsawa Translations &amp; Publications]&lt;/ref&gt; Committed to making more of the Dharma accessible to fellow students worldwide, the mission is to produce authentic and accessible translations in many languages.

The Chokgyur Lingpa Foundation is also building Zangdok Palri (a model of [[Padmasambhava]]'s [[pure land]], Copper-Colored Mountain) in Vajravarahi, outside [[Kathmandu]], [[Nepal]]. The Chokgyur Lingpa Foundation has a growing number of organizations around the world as well as students in many countries, more than fifty, including Malaysia, United States, Poland, Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Taiwan, Thailand, Germany, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Austria, Scotland, Great Britain and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cglf.org The Chokgyur Lingpa Foundation www.cglf.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Chokling Rinpoche is on the board of the non-profit organization Rangjung Yeshe Shenpen, also based in Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shenpennepal.org/ Shenpen Nepal http://www.shenpennepal.org/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earthquake and Rebuilding ==

On Saturday, March 25, 2015, Nepal suffered a major earthquake that registered 7.8 on the Richter scale. This was the largest earthquake for at least 80 years. Large and numerous aftershocks by the hundreds followed in the weeks following that earthquake. Many thousands of people died and hundreds of thousands were left homeless and in need of medical care. Under the direction of Tsikey Chokling Rinpoche and [[Phakchok Rinpoche]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rangjung.com/authors/Phakchok_Rinpoche.htm Rangjung Yeshe Publications] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140811182836/http://www.rangjung.com/authors/Phakchok_Rinpoche.htm |date=2014-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mvtimes.com/2014/05/13/highly-regarded-buddhist-teacher-to-speak/&lt;/ref&gt; and senior monks, everyone associated with Tsikey Chokling Rinpoche, his monastery, and his foundation in Nepal have organized to help rebuild Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/blogs/americanbuddhist/2015/05/an-update-from-buddhists-working-on-the-ground-in-nepal.html "An Update from Buddhists working on the ground in Nepal" Patheos.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailystar.com/news/local_news/group-pitches-in-for-nepal-quake-victims/article_09b22a37-0e7e-5425-ac72-478cf27e343f.html "Group pitches in for Nepal quake victims" The Daily Star (Oneonta, NY)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scituate.wickedlocal.com/article/20150508/NEWS/150507347 "Scituate High grad helping in Nepal after quake" The Scituate Mariner]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/article1551808.ece "Victims saved by Lana’s first aid" The Sunday Times (UK)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.savetibet.org/the-impact-of-the-nepal-earthquake-in-tibet/ "The impact of the Nepal earthquake in Tibet" The International Campaign Tibet]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7348">'''''Upeksha''''' in [[Sanskrit]] or '''''[[Upekkha]]''''' in [[Pali]] means [[equanimity]], non-attachment, even-mindedness or letting go. ''Upeksha'' does not mean indifference. It is the fourth element of true love and has as its seed the wisdom of equality that removes all boundaries, discrimination and prejudices while leading to the sublime unity where there is no self and no other; without ''Upeksha'', love becomes possessive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Teachings on Love|author=Thich Nhat Hanh|publisher=Readhowyouwant.com|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5K6o6IitGogC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=Upeksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wyELUaKpNIXZrQeS14GQBQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Upeksha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equanimity or ''Upeksha'' grows out of mindfulness, then one becomes master of every situation no matter what the situation is without it one cannot take anything in one’s stride; its significance is that one really lives unconditionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Zen Therapy|author=David Brazier|publisher=Constable and Robinson Ltd.|page=90|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SQ6cR_3IyWMC&amp;pg=PT90&amp;dq=Upeksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wyELUaKpNIXZrQeS14GQBQ&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The understanding that our happiness and that of others is inseparable moves us directly into the fourth ''[[Brahmavihara]]'', ''Upeksha''. Equanimity of ''Upeksha'' carries the ability to take a large view and to look over the whole situation not bound by one side or the other, its near-enemy is in-difference which is difficult to recognise because it masquerades on the surface as even-mindedness; indifference causes retreat to a form of denial like repression, don’t care-can’t be bothered attitude. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Teaching, Learning and Loving|author=Daniel Patrick Liston|publisher=Routledge|page=175|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i_dJ6xrnGaQC&amp;pg=PA175&amp;dq=Upeksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IyoLUbbULIfqkAWy3YDQCQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Upeksha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Yoga]], ''maîtri'', ''karuna'', ''mudita'' and ''upeksha'' are only different aspects of universal sympathy, which remove all perversities in our nature and unite us with our fellow-men. This is the positive aspect of the mind with reference to abstinence from injuring (''[[ahimsa]]'') which will cleanse the mind and make it fit for ''[[Śraddhā]]'' etc., prepare it to become steady with a view to attaining true discriminative knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yoga as Philosophy and Religion|author=Surendra Nath Dasgupta|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|page=137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=osW7uQU2E-IC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=Upeksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wyELUaKpNIXZrQeS14GQBQ&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Upeksha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a ''karmasthana'' that holds a very high place in ''[[sadhana]]''. Like equality in [[Bhagavad Gita]], ''upeksha'' of the [[Buddhists]] operates on many levels, and ten kinds of upeksha are enumerated; it is the equality called the six-limbed upeksha which renounces all the creaturely reactions of the six senses when anything agreeable or disagreeable presents itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Meditations:Yoga, Gods, Religions|author=Ram Swarup|publisher=Voice of India|page=19,60|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pqzWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Upeksha&amp;dq=Upeksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IyoLUbbULIfqkAWy3YDQCQ&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAjgK}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samadhi]] may also involve the cultivation of the four states called [[Brahmavihara]]s which four states are - "goodwill" (''maîtri''), "compassion" (''karuna''), "sympathetic joy" (''mudita'') and "equanimity" (''upeksha''). Practised to perfection these states take one to pure the mind-states on the plane of formlessness that are proximate to the apex of existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of  Asian Philosophy|author=Oliver Leaman|publisher=Taylor and Francis|page=536|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=snU6hyIVMawC&amp;pg=PA536&amp;dq=Upeksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IyoLUbbULIfqkAWy3YDQCQ&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Upeksha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Upeksha'' as a power includes freedom from all kinds of desires and birth because it has no preference for one thing more than the other. It is opposed to individuality. This power manifests as ten kinds which are  – ''Sadangopeksha'' (when there is neither pleasure nor displeasure), ''Brahma-wiharopeksha'' (when the mind is equally affected towards all beings), ''Bowdyangopeksha'' (when the mind is equally affected towards all thoughts), ''Wiryopeksha'' (when the mind is equally affected by the same force of determination), ''Sankharopeksha'' (when the mind is equally affected towards all kinds of wisdom), ''Wedanopeksha'' (when the mind is sensible to neither pleasure nor pain), ''Widarsanopeksha'' (when the mind is not affected by what is seen), ''Tatramadyastopeksha'' (when all modes of upeksha are applied together), ''Dhyanopeksha'' (when the impermanency of sensible-objects is regarded with an even mind)and ''Parisudi-upeksha'' (when the mind is equally affected towards all that is necessary to secure freedom from the cleaving to existence). All upekshas may be possessed by one and the same person but the second cannot be possessed without the first.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Manual of Buddhism, in its Modern Development|author=Robert Spence Hardy|page=505|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w3cOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA505&amp;dq=Upeksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MzILUeiLMI_KrAfH94GQCg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Upeksha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Theosophists, ''maitri'', ''karuna'', ''mudita'' and ''upeksha'' are the four qualities of a ''[[Jivanmukta]]'' who favours ''Sishya'' ("disciple") who attains ''[[Moksha|mukti]]'', ''Bhakta'' ("devotee") who gains his noble ends, ''Udasina'' ("indifferent person") who begins to cherish love for virtuous deeds and ''Pathaka'' (a "sinner") whose sins are purged, and whose ''lakshanas'' are ''akkrodha'' ("absence of hatred"), ''arogya'' ("sound health"), ''jitendriyathawam'' ("conquest of passions"), ''daya'' (kindness), ''kshama'' (forbearance), ''janapriyathawa'' (popularity), ''alobha'' ("absence of avarice"), ''dathruthawa'' (generosity), ''abhaya'' (courage) and ''nairmalaya'' (cleanliness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Theosophist October 1886 to April 1187|page=119|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WcqKzRYREm8C&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=Upeksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WmALUeGJHI2GrAf0l4C4Aw&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Upeksha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir William Mitchell''' (27 March 1861 &amp;ndash; 24 June 1962) was Professor of English Language, Literature, Mental and [[Moral Philosophy]] at the [[University of Adelaide]] from 1894–1922, Vice-Chancellor 1916–1942 and Chancellor 1942–1948.&lt;ref name="Davies2003p92"&gt;{{Harvnb|Davies|2003|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell was an enthusiast for literary societies, and was in 1883 a foundation member of the [[South Australian Literary Societies' Union]], served as its president in 1901, and remained a staunch supporter of the Union in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article41639469 |title=Record Debating Season For Literary Union |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)]] |location=South Australia |date=28 April 1937 |accessdate=29 June 2018 |page=25 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell wrote about issues overlapping [[philosophy of mind]] and [[science]], [[neurology]], [[Introduction to quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] and [[philosophical]] [[psychology]].

His work is the subject of a book by W. Martin Davies, ''The philosophy of Sir William Mitchell, 1861–1962 : a mind's own place'' (2003) {{ISBN|0-7734-6733-5}}.

He is also the benefactor of [http://www.adelaide.edu.au/prizes/humss/humanities/prof_sir_william_mitchell_level_II.html The Professor Sir William Mitchell Prize for Philosophy, Level II], and gives his name to the [[Electoral district of Mitchell (South Australia)|South Australian Electoral District of Mitchell]].

On 18 January 1900 William Mitchell married Marjory Erlistoun Barr Smith (1868 – 3 August 1913), fourth daughter of [[Robert Barr Smith]]. Their daughter Joanna "Nan" Mitchell (1900– ) married Major David Thompson, of Farnham House, [[Farnham Royal]]. Buckinghamshire c. 1 May 1925.

Mitchell was knighted in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/mitchell/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World peace''', or '''peace on Earth''', is the concept of an [[ideal (ethics)|ideal]] state of happiness, [[freedom (political)|freedom]] and [[peace]] within and among all people and nations on earth. This idea of world [[non-violence]] is one motivation for people and nations to willingly cooperate, either voluntarily or by virtue of a system of governance that objects it will be solved by cookie 
love and peace. Different cultures, religions, philosophies and organisations have varying concepts on how such a state would come about.

Various religious and secular organisations have the stated aim of achieving world peace through addressing human rights, technology, education, engineering, medicine or [[diplomat|diplomacy]] used as an end to all forms of fighting. Since 1945, the [[United Nations]] and the 5 [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent members]] of its [[Security Council]] (the US, Russia, China, France and the UK) have operated under the aim to resolve conflicts without war or declarations of war. Nonetheless, nations have entered numerous military conflicts since then.

==World peace theories==
{{Main|Peace and conflict studies}}
Many theories as to how world peace could be achieved have been proposed. Several of these are listed below.

===Peace through strength===
{{Main|Peace through strength}}

The term is traced back to the Roman Emperor [[Hadrian]] (reigned AD 117 – 138) but the concept is as old as the recorded history. The Egyptian god [[Ptah]] says that [[Ramses II]]'s (1279–1213 BC) "strength" causes every country "to crave peace":
{{quote|
I have set for thee the might, victory and strength of thy mighty sword in every land ... I assign them to thy mighty sword ... I have thy terror in every heart ... I have set thy fear in every country, thy fear encircles the mountains, and the chiefs tremble at the mention of thee...; they come to thee, crying out together, to crave peace from thee.&lt;ref&gt;''Ancient Records of Egypt. Historical Documents from the Earliest Times to the Persian Conquest'', (ed. [[James Henry Breasted]], London: Nabu Press, 1988), vol III:408, p 179-180.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In 1943, at the peak of [[World War II]], the founder of the [[Paneuropean Union]], [[Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi]], argued that after the War the United States is bound to take "command of the skies" to ensure the lasting world peace:
{{quote|
But the inauguration of such a glorious century of peace demands from us abandonment of old conceptions of peace. The new Angel of Peace must no longer be pictured as a charming but helpless lady with an olive branch in her hand, but like the Goddess of Justice with a balance in her left and a sword in her right; or like the Archangel Michael, with a fiery sword and wings of steel, fighting the devil to restore and protect the peace of heaven.&lt;ref&gt;''Crusade for Pan-Europe'', (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1943), p 299, 305.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In fact, near the entrance to the headquarters of the [[Strategic Air Command|SAC]] at Offutt Air Base stands a large sign with a SAC emblem and its motto: "Peace is our profession."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Thomas S. Power]], ''Design for Survival'', (New York: Coward McCann, 1964), p 139.&lt;/ref&gt; The motto "was a staggering paradox that was also completely accurate."&lt;ref&gt;Phillip S. Meilinger, ''Bomber: The Formation and Early History of Strategic Air Command'', (Alabama: Air University Press, 2012), p XVIII.&lt;/ref&gt; One SAC Bomber—[[Convair B-36 Peacemaker|Convair B-36]]—is called ''Peacemaker'' and one inter-continental missile-[[LGM-118 Peacekeeper|LGM-118]]-''Peacekeeper''.

In 2016, former US Secretary of Defense [[Ash Carter]] envisaged that the rebalance to the Asia-Pacific will make the region "peaceful" through "strength": 
{{quote|
You, and your fellow soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines will solidify the rebalance, you will make this network work, and you will help the Asia-Pacific ... realize a principled and peaceful and prosperous future.  And play the role only America can play ... You'll do so with strength.&lt;ref&gt;"The Future of the Rebalance: Enabling Security in the Vital &amp; Dynamic Asia-Pacific," (Secretary of Defense Speech, September 29, 2016, Washington: Department of Defense), https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/959937/remarks-on-the-future-of-the-rebalance-enabling-security-in-the-vital-dynamic-a?source=GovDelivery&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Introduction to US National Security and Defense Strategies of 2018 states: The US force posture combined with the allies will "preserve peace through strength." The document proceeds to detail what "achieving peace through strength requires."&lt;ref&gt;US National Secusrity and Defense Strategies, (Washington: Department of Defense, 2018), p 1, 6, https://www.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/2018-National-Defense-Strategy-Summary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Associated with ''peace through strength'' are concepts of ''preponderance of power'' (as opposed to [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]]), [[hegemonic stability theory]], ''unipolar stability'', and imperial peace (such as [[Pax Romana]], [[Pax Britannica]], or [[Pax Americana]]).

===Marxism: World peace via world revolution===

World peace would be a consequence of the anarchist communist world. According to the dialectic materialist theory of Karl Marx, the humanity is divided in just 2 classes in capitalism, the proletarians -that do not possess the means of production- and the bourgeoisie -that possesses the means of production-, once that the communist revolution, that shall abolish the private propriety of the means of production, have happened, humanity will not be divided anymore and a lot of changes will happen. Through a period called socialism the dictatorship of the proletarians will take charge of getting rid of the last vestiges of capitalism, and help to make the revolution worldwide. Once the private propriety have been abolished worldwide, the state will not longer be useful and will disappear, because the government only exists to protect the dominant class, effectively dominating with violence and fear the submitted class, but there will not be classes anymore, and therefore none will require to dominate anyone. Instead organisations of workers will manage the production of things, but no organisation will have any military power, neither police force or prisons.

The main principle of Marx's theory is that the material conditions limit the spiritual conditions. People will not be violent but respecting, peaceful and altruistic, because the material conditions will finally allow them to be so. They do not longer need to live just aiming to earn money, but they live to develop themselves spiritually. With the material problems solved, and everyone receiving education and being provided  the appropriate circumstances for their intellectual development, there will not any problem, and society will work getting from each one what one has the capacity to give, and providing to each one what one need.

[[Leon Trotsky]] argued that a proletariat [[world revolution]] would lead to world peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1914/war/ | first = Leon | last = Trotsky | title = War and the International | year = 1914 | publisher = Marxists}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratic peace theory===
Proponents of the [[democratic peace theory]] claim that strong empirical evidence exists that democracies never or rarely wage war against each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/ray.htm |publisher=M Tholyoke |title=International relations |contribution=Ray |place=USA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217032515/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/ray.htm |archivedate=17 February 2008 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/politics/faculty/smith/dempeace.PDF |format=[[PDF]] |publisher=New York University |place=USA |last=Smith |title=Politics |contribution=Democracy &amp; peace}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://www.academia.edu/2486355/Dyadic_Democratic_Peace_Strikes_Back_Reconstructing_the_Social_Constructivist_Approach_After_the_Monadic_Renaissance |title=Dyadic Democratic Peace Strikes Back |accessdate=31 July 2013 |author=Müller, Harald and Jonas Wolff |booktitle=5th Pan-European International Relations ConferenceThe Hague |date=September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20051101fareviewessay84611/john-m-owen-iv/iraq-and-the-democratic-peace.html |work=ForeignAffairs.org |date=1 November 2005 |title=Fareview essay |first=John M, IV |last=Owen |id="Iraq and the democratic peace" |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051221155722/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20051101fareviewessay84611/john-m-owen-iv/iraq-and-the-democratic-peace.html |archivedate=21 December 2005 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are, however, several [[List of wars between democracies|wars between democracies]] that have taken place, historically.

===Capitalism peace theory===
In her essay "The Roots of War", [[Ayn Rand]] held that the major wars of history were started by the more controlled economies of the time against the freer ones and that capitalism gave mankind the longest period of peace in history—a period during which there were no wars involving the entire civilized world—from the end of the Napoleonic wars in 1815 to the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, with the exceptions of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870), the [[Spanish–American War]] (1898), and the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865), which notably occurred in perhaps the most liberal economy in the world at the beginning of the industrial revolution.

===Cobdenism===
Proponents of [[Cobdenism]] claim that by removing tariffs and creating international [[free trade]] wars would become impossible, because free trade prevents a nation from becoming [[self-sufficient]], which is a requirement for long wars.

However, free trade does not prevent a nation from establishing some sort of emergency plan to become temporarily self-sufficient in case of war or that a nation could simply acquire what it needs from a different nation. A good example of this is [[World War I]], during which both Britain and Germany became partially self-sufficient. This is particularly important because Germany had no plan for creating a [[war economy]].

More generally, free trade—while not making wars impossible—can make wars, and restrictions on trade caused by wars, very costly for international companies with production, research, and sales in many different nations. Thus, a powerful lobby—unless there are only national companies—will argue against wars.

===Mutual assured destruction===
[[Mutual assured destruction]] is a [[doctrine]] of military strategy in which a full-scale use of [[nuclear weapons]] by two opposing sides would effectively result in the destruction of both belligerents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/history/cold-war/strategy/strategy-mutual-assured-destruction.htm | publisher = Nuclear files | title = Strategy | contribution = Mutual Assured Destruction}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Col. Alan J | last = Parrington | publisher = Air Force | place = USA | url = http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj97/win97/parrin.html | contribution = Mutually Assured Destruction Revisited, Strategic Doctrine in Question | title = Airpower Journal | date = Winter 1997 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150620055606/http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj97/win97/parrin.html | archivedate = 20 June 2015 | df = dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the policy of mutual assured destruction during the Cold War attributed this to the increase in the lethality of war to the point where it no longer offers the possibility of a net gain for either side, thereby making wars pointless.

===United Nations Charter and international law===
After World War II, the United Nations was established by the [[United Nations Charter]] to "save successive generations from the scourge of war which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind" (Preamble). The [[Preamble to the United Nations Charter]] also aims to further the adoption of fundamental human rights, to respect obligations to [[sources of international law]] as well as to unite the strength of independent countries in order to maintain international peace and [[international security|security]]. All treaties on [[international human rights law]] make reference to or consider "the principles proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations, recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and "peace in the world".

===Declaration of Peace and Cessation of War===
Declaration of Peace and Cessation of War (DPCW) with 10 article and 38 clauses is an international legal framework drafted by HWPL International Law Peace Committee, composed of international law experts from 15 countries. DPCW is proclaimed as a law for peace, which promotes the engagement of civil society actors, by provoking their advocacy and promoting voluntary practices of democratic values, as peace is considered difficult to be achieved only by the voices of the elites or with current institutions. 

The Preambles of DPCW are:1. Prohibit the threat or use of force; 2. Reduce war potential and repurpose weapons to benefit humanity; 3. Develop friendly relations and prohibit acts of aggression; 4. Prohibit coercion against internationally recognised state boundaries; 5. Ensure the right to self-determination of peoples of states; 6. Settle international disputes through peaceful means; 7. Acknowledge the right to self-defence; 8. Foster religious freedom; 9. Promote peaceful coexistence amongst religious and ethnic groups; 10. Spread a culture of peace.&lt;ref&gt;http://hwpl.kr/en/initiative/lawForPeace&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the global movement of support from civil society, increasing awareness and support of DPCW from former and current heads of states, civil society actors and government representatives from different countries are received such that the legal document to be submitted and introduced into the UN. 

===Globalization===
[[Gordon B. Hinckley]] saw a trend in national politics by which [[city-states]] and [[nation-states]] have unified and suggests that the international arena will eventually follow suit. Many countries such as China, Italy, the United States, Australia, Germany, India and Britain have unified into single nation-states with others like the [[European Union]] following suit, suggesting that further [[globalization]] will bring about a [[world state]].

===Self-organized peace===
World peace has been depicted as a consequence of local, self-determined behaviors that inhibit the institutionalization of power and ensuing violence.  The solution is not so much based on an agreed agenda, or an investment in higher authority whether divine or political, but rather a [[Self-organization|self-organized]] network of mutually supportive mechanisms, resulting in a viable politico-economic social fabric. The principal technique for inducing convergence is [[thought experiment]], namely [[backcasting]], enabling anyone to participate no matter what cultural background, religious doctrine, political affiliation or age demographic. Similar collaborative mechanisms are emerging from the Internet around [[open-source model|open-source]] projects, including Wikipedia, and the evolution of other [[social media]].

===Economic norms theory===
[[Michael Mousseau|Economic norms theory]] links economic conditions with institutions of governance and conflict, distinguishing personal [[clientelism|clientelist]] economies from impersonal market-oriented ones, identifying the latter with permanent peace within and between nations.&lt;ref name = "Mousseau 2009"&gt;{{Citation | first = Michael | last = Mousseau | contribution = The Social Market Roots of Democratic Peace | title = International Security | volume = 33 | number = 4 | date = Spring 2009 | pages = 52–86}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Michael | last = Mousseau | author-mask = 8 | contribution = Market Civilization and its Clash with Terror | title = International Security | volume = 27 | number = 3 | date = Winter 2002–2003 | pages = 5–29}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through most of human history societies have been based on personal relations: individuals in groups know each other and exchange favors. Today in most lower-income societies hierarchies of groups distribute wealth based on personal relationships among group leaders, a process often linked with clientelism and corruption. [[Michael Mousseau]] argues that in this kind of socio-economy conflict is always present, latent or overt, because individuals depend on their groups for physical and economic security and are thus loyal to their groups rather than their states, and because groups are in a constant state of conflict over access to state coffers. Through processes of [[bounded rationality]], people are conditioned towards strong in-group identities and are easily swayed to fear outsiders, psychological predispositions that make possible sectarian violence, genocide, and terrorism.&lt;ref name = "Mousseau 2003"&gt;{{Citation | first = Michael |last= Mousseau |author-mask = 8 | year = 2003 |title= The Nexus of Market Society, Liberal Preferences, and Democratic Peace: Interdisciplinary Theory and Evidence | journal= International Studies Quarterly | volume= 47 |number= 4 |pages= 483–510 | doi=10.1046/j.0020-8833.2003.00276.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Market-oriented socio-economies are integrated not with personal ties but the impersonal force of the market where most individuals are economically dependent on trusting strangers in contracts enforced by the state.  This creates loyalty to a state that enforces the rule of law and contracts impartially and reliably and provides equal protection in the freedom to contract – that is, liberal democracy.  Wars cannot happen within or between nations with market-integrated economies because war requires the harming of others, and in these kinds of economies everyone is always economically better off when others in the market are also better off, not worse off. Rather than fight, citizens in market-oriented socio-economies care deeply about everyone's rights and welfare, so they demand economic growth at home and economic cooperation and human rights abroad.  In fact, nations with market-oriented socio-economies tend to agree on global issues&lt;ref name = "Mousseau 2003" /&gt; and not a single fatality has occurred in any dispute between them.&lt;ref name = "Mousseau 2009" /&gt;

Economic norms theory should not be confused with classical liberal theory. The latter assumes that markets are natural and that freer markets promote wealth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Milton Friedman|Friedman, Milton]]. 1970. ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]''. Chicago : University of Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Economic norms theory shows how market-contracting is a learned norm, and state spending, regulation, and redistribution are necessary to ensure that almost everyone can participate in the "social market" economy, which is in everyone's interests. One proposed mechanism for world peace involves consumer purchasing of renewable and equitable local food and power sources involving [[artificial photosynthesis]] ushering in a period of social and ecological harmony known as the [[Sustainocene]].

==International Day of Peace==
The [[International Day of Peace]], sometimes called World Peace Day, is observed annually on 21 September. It is dedicated to peace, and specifically the absence of war and violence, and can be celebrated by a temporary ceasefire in a combat zone. The International Day of Peace was established in 1981 by the United Nations General Assembly. Two decades later, in 2001, the General Assembly unanimously voted to designate the day as a day of preventing violence and a cease-fire. The celebration of this day is recognized by many nations and people. In 2013, for the first time, the day has been dedicated to [[peace education]], i.e. by the key preventive means to reduce war sustainably.

==Religious views==
[[File:Mt._Ecclesia-3.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|A long-standing suggestion for World Peace Meditation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rosicrucian.com/zineen/pamen050.htm Suggestion For World Peace Meditation]. [[Mount Ecclesia]], CA, USA&lt;/ref&gt; along with annual purposeful devotional dates,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rosicrucian.com/docs/dates2017s_eng.pdf World Peace Meditation: 2017 Devotional Services Dates and Times]. Mount Ecclesia, CA, USA&lt;/ref&gt; as faithfully performed by a [[fraternal organization]] whose founder taught, in the 1910s, that "'''[[Peace education|Peace is a matter of education]]''', and impossible of achievement until we have learned to deal charitably, justly, and openly with one another, as nations as well as [[individual]]s."&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Heindel|Heindel, Max]]. ''Letters to Students'': LETTER NO. 92, July 1918. [[Rosicrucian Fellowship|TRF]], CA, USA (various editions/publishers)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Many religions and religious leaders have expressed a desire for an end to violence.

===Bahá'í Faith===
{{Main|Bahá'í Faith and the unity of humanity}}
The central aim of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] is the establishment of the unity of the peoples of the world. [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, stated in no uncertain terms, "the fundamental purpose animating the Faith of God and His Religion is to safeguard the interests and promote the unity of the human race ..." In His writings, Bahá'u'lláh described two distinct stages of world peace – a lesser peace and a most great peace.

The lesser peace is essentially a collective security agreement between the nations of the world. In this arrangement, nations agree to protect one another by rising up against an aggressor nation, should it seek the usurpation of territory or the destruction of its neighbors. The lesser peace is limited in scope and is concerned with the establishment of basic order and the universal recognition of national borders and the sovereignty of nations. Bahá'ís believe that the lesser peace is taking place largely through the operation of the Divine Will, and that Bahá'í influence on the process is relatively minor.

The most great peace is the eventual end goal of the lesser peace and is envisioned as a time of spiritual and social unity – a time when the peoples of the world genuinely identify with and care for one another, rather than simply tolerating one other's existence. The Bahá'ís view this process as taking place largely as a result of the spread of Bahá'í teachings, principles and practices throughout the world. The larger world peace process and its foundational elements are addressed in the document ''[[The Promise of World Peace]]'', written by the [[Universal House of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=P. |year=1999 |title=A Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford, UK |isbn=1-85168-184-1 |pages=363–364 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
{{Main|Buddhism}}
Many [[Buddhist]]s believe that world peace can only be achieved if we first establish [[peace]] within our minds. The idea is that [[anger]] and other negative states of [[mind]] are the cause of wars and fighting. Buddhists believe people can live in [[peace]] and [[harmony]] only if we abandon negative emotions such as anger in our minds and cultivate positive emotions such as love and [[compassion]].  As with all [[Dharmic religions]] (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism), [[ahimsa]] (avoidance of violence) is a central concept.

[[Peace pagoda]]s are monuments that are built to symbolize and inspire world peace and have been central to the peace movement throughout the years. These are typically of Buddhist origin, being built by the Japanese Buddhist organisation [[Nipponzan Myohoji]]. They exist around the world in cities such as London, Vienna, New Delhi, Tokyo and [[Lumbini]].

===Christianity===
{{Main|Christian pacifism}}
The basic Christian ideal specifies that [[peace]] can only come by the Word and love of God, which is perfectly demonstrated in the life of Christ:

{{quote|Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.|{{bibleref|John|14:27|NIV}}}}

As christologically interpreted from {{bibleref|Isaiah|2|NIV}}, whereupon the  "Word of the Lord" is established on the earth, the material human-political result will be 'nation not taking up sword against nation; nor will they train for war anymore'. Christian world peace necessitates the living of a proactive life replete with all good works in direct light of the Word of God. The details of such a life can be observed in the Gospels, especially the historically renowned Sermon on the Mount, where [[forgiveness|forgiving]] those who do wrong things against oneself is advocated among other pious precepts.

However, not all Christians expect a lasting world peace on this earth:

{{quote|Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to turn a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law—a man's enemies will be the members of his own household.|{{bibleverse|Matt|10:34–36|NIV}}}}

Many Christians believe that world peace is expected to be manifest upon the "new earth" that is promised in Christian scripture such as {{bibleref|Revelation|21|NIV}}.

The [[Roman Catholic]] religious conception of "[[Consecration of Russia]]", related to the Church's high-priority [[Our Lady of Fátima|Fátima]] [[Marian apparitions]], promises ''world peace'' as a result of this process being fulfilled.

===Hinduism===
{{Main|Hinduism}}
Traditionally, [[Hinduism]] has adopted an ancient [[Sanskrit]] phrase ''[[Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam|Vasudha eka kutumbakam]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindudharmaforums.com/showthread.php?t=969&amp;page=3|title=Dharmic Wisdom Quotes – Page 3|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which translates as "The world is one family." The essence of this concept is the observation that only base minds see dichotomies and divisions. The more we seek wisdom, the more we become inclusive and free our internal spirit from worldly illusions or ''[[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]''. World peace is hence only achieved through internal means—by liberating ourselves from artificial boundaries that separate us all.  As with all [[Dharmic religions]] (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism), [[ahimsa]] (avoidance of violence) is a central concept.

===Islam===
{{Main|Islamic Peace}}

According to [[Islamic eschatology]], the whole world will be united under the leadership of prophet [[Jesus in Islam|Isa ]] in his [[second coming]].&lt;ref&gt;Bukhari, Kitab Ahadith al-Ambiya; Bab: Nuzul 'Isa Ibn Maryam; Muslim, Bab: Bayan Nuzul 'Isa; Tirmidhi, Abwab-al-Fitan; Bab Fi Nuzul 'Isa; Musnad Ahmad, Marwiyat Abu Huraira.http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/M_fop/fop11.htm&lt;/ref&gt; At that time love, justice and peace will be so abundant that the world will be in likeness of [[paradise]].

===Judaism===
{{Main|Judaism}}

The concept of ''[[Tikkun olam]]'' (Repairing the World) is central to modern [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. ''Tikkun olam'' is accomplished through various means, such as ritualistically performing God's commandments, charity and social justice, as well as through example persuading the rest of the world to behave morally. According to some views, Tikkun Olam would result in the beginning of the Messianic Age. It has been said that in every generation, a person is born with the potential to be the spiritual [[Mashiach|Messiah]]. If the time is right for the Messianic Age within that person's lifetime, then that person will be the mashiach. But if that person dies before he completes the mission of the Messiah, then that person is not the Messiah (Mashiach).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/mashiach.htm|title=Judaism 101: Mashiach: The Messiah|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, in [[Jewish messianism]] it is considered that at some future time a ''Messiah'' (literally "a King appointed by God") will rise up to bring all Jews back to the [[Land of Israel]], followed by everlasting global peace and prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;Rambam, [[Mishneh Torah]], Hilkhot Melachim, ch. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; This idea originates from passages in the [[Old Testament]] and the [[Talmud]].
{{quote|And he shall judge between the nations and reprove many peoples, and they shall beat their [[Swords to ploughshares|swords into plowshares]] and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift the sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore.|{{bibleref|Isaiah|2:4|JPR}}}}

===Jainism===
{{Main|Jainism}}
[[Ahimsa in Jainism|Compassion for all life, human and non-human]], is central to [[Jainism]].They have adopted the wordings of Lord Mahvira [[Jiyo aur Jeeno Do]] Human life is valued as a unique, rare opportunity to reach enlightenment; to kill any person, no matter what crime he may have committed, is considered unimaginably abhorrent. It is a religion that requires monks and laity, from all its sects and traditions, to be vegetarian. Some Indian regions, such as Gujarat, have been strongly influenced by Jains and often the majority of the local Hindus of every denomination have also become vegetarian.&lt;ref&gt;Titze, Kurt, Jainism: A Pictorial Guide to the Religion of Non-Violence, Mohtilal Banarsidass, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Famous quote on world peace as per Jainism by a 19th-century Indian legend, [[Virchand Gandhi]]: "May peace rule the universe; may peace rule in kingdoms and empires; may peace rule in states and in the lands of the potentates; may peace rule in the house of friends and may peace also rule in the house of enemies."&lt;ref&gt;Useful instructions, In Matter religious, moral and others by Motilal M. Munishi, 1904&lt;/ref&gt; As with all [[Dharmic religions]] (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism), [[ahimsa]] (avoidance of violence) is a central concept.

===Sikhism===
{{Main|Sikhism}}
Peace comes from God.  Meditation, the means of communicating with God, is unfruitful without the noble character of a devotee, there can be no worship without performing good deeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Angela|title=Movement and Change|year=1997|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=9780174370673|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guru Nanak stressed now ''[[kirat karō]]'': that a Sikh should balance work, worship, and charity, and should defend the rights of all creatures, and in particular, fellow human beings. They are encouraged to have a ''[[chaṛdī kalā]]'', or ''optimistic'' – ''resilience'', view of life. Sikh teachings also stress the concept of sharing—''[[vaṇḍ chakkō]]''—through the distribution of free food at Sikh [[gurdwara]]s (''[[Langar (Sikhism)|laṅgar]]''), giving charitable donations, and working for the good of the community and others (''[[Selfless service|sēvā]]''). Sikhs believe that no matter what race, sex, or religion one is, all are equal in God's eyes. Men and women are equal and share the same rights, and women can lead in prayers. As with all [[Dharmic religions]] (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism), [[ahimsa]] (avoidance of violence) is a central concept.

==Economic implications==
A report in June 2015 on the [[Global Peace Index]] highlighted that the impact of violence on the global economy reached US$14.3&amp;nbsp;trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-33161837|title=Global conflicts 'cost 13% of world GDP'|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also found that the economic cost of violence is 13.4% of world GDP, equal to the total economic output of Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Spain and the UK combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/16/global-cost-conflict-reaches-14tn-says-report|title=Global cost of conflict reaches $14.3tn, says report|author=Mark Anderson|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
