'''1P-ETH-LAD''' ('''1-propionyl-6-ethyl-6-nor-lysergic acid diethyamide''') is an [[structural analog|analog]] of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]]. 1P-ETH-LAD is a [[psychedelic drug]] similar to LSD. Research has shown formation of [[ETH-LAD]] from 1P-ETH-LAD incubated in human serum, suggesting that it functions as a [[prodrug]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/dta.2196| pmid = 28342178| title = Return of the lysergamides.

Like ETH-LAD, this drug has been reported to be significantly more potent than LSD itself, and is reported to largely mimic ETH-LAD's psychedelic effects.

1P-ETH-LAD has little history of human usage before January 2016.

== Legal issues ==
* United States: 1P-ETH-LAD may be considered illegal in the U.S. for human consumption under the [[Federal Analogue Act]].

* United Kingdom: It is illegal to produce, supply, or import this substance under the [[Psychoactive Substances Act 2016|Psychoactive Substance Act]], which came into effect on May 26th, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Psychoactive Substances Act 2016 (Legislation.gov.uk) | http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/2/contents/enacted&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5462">The '''AIMA prophecy''' was a [[prophecy]] current during the reign of the [[Byzantine emperor]], [[Manuel I Komnenos]] ({{reign|1143|1180}}) and at the same time an example of a medieval [[contrived acronym]]. 

It claimed to foretell that the initial letters of the names of the emperors of the [[Komnenos]] dynasty would spell ''aima'' (αἶμα), the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for "blood". The emperors of the dynasty had been, in order, [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexios I Komnenos]] ({{reign|1081|1118}}) ([[alpha]]), [[John II Komnenos|Ioannes II Komnenos]] ({{reign|1118|1143}}) ([[iota]]), and Manuel I ([[mu (letter)|mu]]) (whose succession was unexpected since he was the fourth son of Ioannes). Because of his belief that his successor's name would have to start with the letter alpha, Manuel had the name Alexios bestowed on [[Béla III of Hungary|Béla]], the fiancé of his daughter [[Maria Komnene (Porphyrogenita)|Maria]] and his designated heir from 1168 to 1169, when his second wife bore Manuel a son, who was named again in accordance with the prophecy as [[Alexios II Komnenos]] ({{reign|1180|1183}}), rather than Ioannes after his paternal grandfather, as was customary among the Byzantines.{{sfn|Magdalino|2002|p=200}} Manuel also gave the name to at least one and perhaps two of his own illegitimate sons.

The reign of Alexios II lasted only three years, before he was deposed and killed by his cousin, [[Andronikos I Komnenos]] ({{reign|1183|1185}}), with whom, apparently, the AIMA sequence began again. In accordance with this, Andronikos would be succeeded in turn by an emperor whose name began with the letter iota. For that reason, he bypassed his firstborn son [[Manuel Komnenos (son of Andronikos I)|Manuel Komnenos]] in favour of the younger [[John Komnenos (son of Andronikos I)|Ioannes]], who was crowned co-emperor in 1184.{{sfn|Varzos|1984b|pp=521, 529–530}}  Andronikos also feared his throne would be usurped by another cousin, [[Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus]]. [[Stephen Hagiochristophorites]], the [[Logothete of the Drome]], suspected a different Isaac, [[Isaac II Angelos]] ({{reign|1185|1195|1203|1204}}), who had been seen in [[Constantinople]]. On September 11, 1185 Hagiochristophorites visited Isaac Angelos at his hideout. Isaac Angelos slew Hagiochristophorites with his sword and fled to [[Hagia Sophia]] seeking sanctuary. In the ensuing uprising, Isaac was crowned emperor, while Andronikos was overthrown and killed a few days later.

The AIMA line continued, however, from Andronikos' eldest son Manuel to his own descendants—the only male-line branch of the Komnenoi to survive the 12th century—the "Grand Komnenoi" [[emperors of Trebizond]]: Andronikos I, Ioannes as co-emperor, Manuel, who would have been the legitimate successor, and Manuel's son [[Alexios I of Trebizond|Alexios I Megas Komnenos]] ({{reign|1204|1222}}), founder of the [[Empire of Trebizond]]. The sequence re-appears again with [[Andronikos I of Trebizond|Andronikos I Gidos]] ({{reign|1222|1235}}), [[John I of Trebizond|Ioannes I Axouchos]] ({{reign|1235|1238}}), [[Manuel I of Trebizond|Manuel Megas Komnenos]] ({{reign|1238|1263}}), and [[Andronikos II of Trebizond|Andronikos II Megas Komnenos]] ({{reign|1263|1266}}).{{sfn|Varzos|1984b|p=527}}

M., &amp; Burrows, C. A.

==Etymology==
The word ''Ahimsa''—sometimes spelled as ''Ahinsa''&lt;ref name="Sanskrit dictionary"&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0125-ahalyA.jpg Sanskrit dictionary reference]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Standing, E. M. (1924). THE SUPER‐VEGETARIANS. New Blackfriars, 5(50), pages 103–108&lt;/ref&gt;—is derived from the Sanskrit root ''hiṃs'' – to strike; ''hiṃsā'' is injury or harm, ''a-hiṃsā'' is the opposite of this, i.e. ''non harming'' or ''[[nonviolence]]''.&lt;ref name="Sanskrit dictionary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shukavak N.

Nonviolence or ''Ahimsa'' is one of the cardinal virtues&lt;ref name=evpc/&gt; and an important tenet of [[Jainism]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]].

It has also been related to the notion that any violence has [[Karma|karmic]] consequences.

==Hinduism==

===Ancient Vedic texts===
Ahimsa as an ethical concept evolved in Vedic texts.&lt;ref name=chapple1990/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walli, Koshelya: ''The Conception of Ahimsa in Indian Thought'', Varanasi 1974, p. 113–145.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest scripts indirectly mention Ahimsa, but do not emphasise it. Over time, the Hindu scripts revise ritual practices and the concept of Ahimsa is increasingly refined and emphasised, ultimately Ahimsa becomes the highest virtue by the late Vedic era (about 500 BC). For example, hymn 10.22.25 in the Rig Veda uses the words [[Satya]] (truthfulness) and Ahimsa in a prayer to deity Indra;&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit: अस्मे ता त इन्द्र सन्तु '''सत्याहिंस'''न्तीरुपस्पृशः । विद्याम यासां भुजो धेनूनां न वज्रिवः ॥१३॥ [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१०.२२ Rigveda 10.22] Wikisource;&lt;br&gt;English: Unto Tähtinen (1964), Non-violence as an Ethical Principle, Turun Yliopisto, Finland, PhD Thesis, pages 23–25; {{oclc|4288274}};&lt;br&gt;For other occurrence of Ahimsa in Rigveda, see [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_५.६४ Rigveda 5.64.3], [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१.१४१ Rigveda 1.141.5];&lt;/ref&gt; later, the [[Yajurveda|Yajur Veda]] dated to be between 1000 BC and 600 BC, states, "may all beings look at me with a friendly eye, may I do likewise, and may we look at each other with the eyes of a friend".&lt;ref name=chapple1990/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/himalayanacademy/sacredhinduliterature/lws/lws_ch-39.html To do no harm] Project Gutenberg, see translation for Yajurveda 36.18 VE;&lt;br&gt;For other occurrences of Ahimsa in Vedic literature, see [https://archive.org/stream/vedicconcordance00bloouoft#page/150/mode/2up A Vedic Concordance] [[Maurice Bloomfield]], Harvard University Press, page 151&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Ahimsa'' appears in the text [[Taittiriya Shakha]] of the [[Yajurveda]] (TS 5.2.8.7), where it refers to non-injury to the sacrificer himself.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs several times in the ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana]]'' in the sense of "non-injury".&lt;ref&gt;Shatapatha Brahmana 2.3.4.30; 2.5.1.14; 6.3.1.26; 6.3.1.39.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ahimsa doctrine is a late Vedic era development in Brahmanical culture.&lt;ref name="houben 1999"&gt;Henk M. Bodewitz in Jan E. M. Houben, K. R. van Kooij, ed., ''Violence denied: violence, non-violence and the rationalisation of violence in "South Asian" cultural history.'' BRILL, 1999 page 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest reference to the idea of non-violence to animals ("pashu-Ahimsa"), apparently in a moral sense, is in the Kapisthala Katha Samhita of the Yajurveda (KapS 31.11), which may have been written in about the 8th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowker states the word appears but is uncommon in the principal Upanishads.&lt;ref&gt;John Bowker, ''Problems of suffering in religions of the world.'' Cambridge University Press, 1975, page 233.&lt;/ref&gt; Kaneda gives examples of the word ''Ahimsa'' in these Upanishads.&lt;ref name=kaneda2008&gt;Kaneda, T. (2008). Shanti, peacefulness of mind. C. Eppert &amp; H. Wang (Eds.), Cross cultural studies in curriculum: Eastern thought, educational insights, pages 171–192, {{ISBN|978-0-8058-5673-6}}, Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars&lt;ref name=arapura&gt;John Arapura in K. R. Sundararajan and Bithika Mukerji Ed. (1997), Hindu spirituality: Postclassical and modern, {{ISBN|978-81-208-1937-5}}; see Chapter 20, pages 392–417&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Izawa, A. (2008). Empathy for Pain in Vedic Ritual. Journal of the International College for Advanced Buddhist Studies, 12, 78&lt;/ref&gt; suggest ''Ahimsa'' as an ethical concept that started evolving in the Vedas, becoming an increasingly central concept in Upanishads.

The [[Chāndogya Upaniṣad]], dated to the 8th or 7th century BCE, one of the oldest [[Upanishads]], has the earliest evidence for the [[Vedas|Vedic era]] use of the word ''Ahimsa'' in the sense familiar in Hinduism (a code of conduct). It bars violence against "all creatures" (''sarvabhuta'') and the practitioner of Ahimsa is said to escape from the cycle of [[Reincarnation|rebirths]] (CU 8.15.1).&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 2–5; English translation: Schmidt p. 631.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars state that this 8th or 7th-century BCE mention may have been an influence of Jainism on Vedic Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;M.K Sridhar and Puruṣottama Bilimoria (2007), ''Indian Ethics: Classical traditions and contemporary challenges,'' Editors: Puruṣottama Bilimoria, Joseph Prabhu, Renuka M. Sharma, Ashgate Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-3301-3}}, page 315&lt;/ref&gt; Others scholar state that this relationship is speculative, and though Jainism is an ancient tradition the oldest traceable texts of Jainism tradition are from many centuries after the Vedic era ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffery D. Long|title=Jainism: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JmRlAgAAQBAJ|year=2009|publisher=I. B.

Chāndogya Upaniṣad also names Ahimsa, along with Satyavacanam (truthfulness), Arjavam (sincerity), [[Dāna|Danam]] (charity), [[Tapas (Sanskrit)|Tapo]] (penance/meditation), as one of five essential virtues (CU 3.17.4).&lt;ref name=arapura/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ravindra Kumar (2008), Non-violence and Its Philosophy, {{ISBN|978-81-7933-159-0}}, see page 11–14&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sandilya [[Upanishad]] lists ten forbearances: ''Ahimsa'', ''Satya'', ''Asteya'', ''Brahmacharya'', ''Daya'', ''Arjava'', ''Kshama'', ''Dhriti'', ''Mitahara'' and ''Saucha''.&lt;ref&gt;Swami, P. (2000). Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Upaniṣads: SZ (Vol. 3). Sarup &amp; Sons; see pages 630–631&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ballantyne, J. R., &amp; Yogīndra, S. (1850). A Lecture on the Vedánta: Embracing the Text of the Vedánta-sára. Presbyterian mission press.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kaneda,&lt;ref name=kaneda2008/&gt; the term Ahimsa is an important spiritual doctrine shared by Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. It literally means 'non-injury' and 'non-killing'. It implies the total avoidance of harming of any kind of living creatures not only by deeds, but also by words and in thoughts.

===The Epics===
The [[Mahabharata]], one of the epics of Hinduism, has multiple mentions of the phrase ''Ahimsa Paramo Dharma'' (अहिंसा परमॊ धर्मः), which literally means: non-violence is the highest moral virtue. For example, [[Mahaprasthanika Parva]] has the verse:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/mbs/mbs13117.htm Mahabharata 13.117.37–38]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
अहिंसा परमॊ धर्मस तथाहिंसा परॊ दमः।
अहिंसा परमं दानम अहिंसा परमस तपः।
अहिंसा परमॊ यज्ञस तथाहिस्मा परं बलम।
अहिंसा परमं मित्रम अहिंसा परमं सुखम।
अहिंसा परमं सत्यम अहिंसा परमं शरुतम॥
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The above passage from Mahabharata emphasises the cardinal importance of Ahimsa in Hinduism, and literally means:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Ahimsa is the highest [[virtue]], Ahimsa is the highest self-control, 
Ahimsa is the greatest gift, Ahimsa is the best suffering, 
Ahimsa is the highest sacrifice, Ahimsa is the finest strength, 
Ahimsa is the greatest friend, Ahimsa is the greatest happiness, 
Ahimsa is the highest truth, and Ahimsa is the greatest teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Chapple, C. (1990). Ecological Nonviolence and the Hindu Tradition. In Perspectives on Nonviolence (pp. 168–177). Springer New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduismtoday.com/pdf_downloads/what_is_hinduism/Sec6/WIH_Sec6_Chapter45.pdf Ahimsa: To do no harm] Subramuniyaswami, What is Hinduism?, Chapter 45, Pages 359–361&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Some other examples where the phrase ''Ahimsa Paramo Dharma'' are discussed include [[Adi Parva]], [[Vana Parva]] and [[Anushasana Parva]]. The [[Bhagavad Gita]], among other things, discusses the doubts and questions about appropriate response when one faces systematic violence or war. These verses develop the concepts of lawful violence in self-defence and the [[Just war theory|theories of just war]]. However, there is no consensus on this interpretation. Gandhi, for example, considers this debate about non-violence and lawful violence as a mere metaphor for the internal war within each human being, when he or she faces moral questions.&lt;ref name=fischer1954/&gt;

===Self-defence, criminal law, and war===
The classical texts of Hinduism devote numerous chapters discussing what people who practice the virtue of Ahimsa, can and must do when they are faced with war, violent threat or need to sentence someone convicted of a crime. These discussions have led to theories of just war, theories of reasonable self-defence and theories of proportionate punishment.&lt;ref name=balkaran2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=klos1996&gt;[[Klaus K. Klostermaier]] (1996), in Harvey Leonard Dyck and Peter Brock (Ed), The Pacifist Impulse in Historical Perspective, see ''Chapter on Himsa and Ahimsa Traditions in Hinduism'', {{ISBN|978-0-8020-0777-3}}, University of Toronto Press, pages 230–234&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthashastra]] discusses, among other things, why and what constitutes proportionate response and punishment.&lt;ref name=robinson2003&gt;Paul F. Robinson (2003), Just War in Comparative Perspective, {{ISBN|0-7546-3587-2}}, Ashgate Publishing, see pages 114–125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coates, B. E. (2008). Modern India's Strategic Advantage to the United States: Her Twin Strengths in Himsa and Ahimsa. Comparative Strategy, 27(2), pages 133–147&lt;/ref&gt;

;War
The precepts of Ahimsa under Hinduism require that war must be avoided, with sincere and truthful dialogue. Force must be the last resort. If war becomes necessary, its cause must be just, its purpose virtuous, its objective to restrain the wicked, its aim peace, its method lawful.&lt;ref name=balkaran2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=robinson2003/&gt; War can only be started and stopped by a legitimate authority. Weapons used must be proportionate to the opponent and the aim of war, not indiscriminate tools of destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Subedi, S. P. (2003). The Concept in Hinduism of 'Just War'. Journal of Conflict and Security Law, 8(2), pages 339–361&lt;/ref&gt; All strategies and weapons used in the war must be to defeat the opponent, not designed to cause misery to the opponent; for example, use of arrows is allowed, but use of arrows smeared with painful poison is not allowed. Warriors must use judgment in the battlefield. Cruelty to the opponent during war is forbidden. Wounded, unarmed opponent warriors must not be attacked or killed, they must be brought to your realm and given medical treatment.&lt;ref name=robinson2003/&gt; Children, women and civilians must not be injured. While the war is in progress, sincere dialogue for peace must continue.&lt;ref name=balkaran2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=klos1996/&gt;

;Self-defence
In matters of self-defence, different interpretations of ancient Hindu texts have been offered. For example, Tähtinen suggests self-defence is appropriate, criminals are not protected by the rule of Ahimsa, and Hindu scriptures support the use of violence against an armed attacker.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 96, 98–101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 12.15.55; Manu Smriti 8.349–350; Matsya Purana 226.116.&lt;/ref&gt; Ahimsa is not meant to imply pacifism.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 91–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternate theories of self-defence, inspired by Ahimsa, build principles similar to theories of just war. [[Aikido]], pioneered in Japan, illustrates one such principles of self-defence. [[Morihei Ueshiba]], the founder of Aikido, described his inspiration as Ahimsa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportspa.com.ba/images/dec2011/full/rad8.pdf The Role of Teachers in Martial Arts] Nebojša Vasic, University of Zenica (2011); Sport SPA Vol. 8, Issue 2: 47–51; see page 46, 2nd column&lt;/ref&gt; According to this interpretation of Ahimsa in self-defence, one must not assume that the world is free of aggression. One must presume that some people will, out of ignorance, error or fear, attack other persons or intrude into their space, physically or verbally. The aim of self-defence, suggested Ueshiba, must be to neutralise the aggression of the attacker, and avoid the conflict. The best defence is one where the victim is protected, as well as the attacker is respected and not injured if possible. Under Ahimsa and Aikido, there are no enemies, and appropriate self-defence focuses on neutralising the immaturity, assumptions and aggressive strivings of the attacker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aiki-extensions.org/pubs/conflict-body_text.pdf SOCIAL CONFLICT, AGGRESSION, AND THE BODY IN EURO-AMERICAN AND ASIAN SOCIAL THOUGHT] Donald Levine, University of Chicago (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ueshiba, Kisshōmaru (2004), ''The Art of Aikido: Principles and Essential Techniques'', Kodansha International, {{ISBN|4-7700-2945-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Criminal law
Tähtinen concludes that Hindus have no misgivings about death penalty; their position is that evil-doers who deserve death should be killed, and that a king in particular is obliged to punish criminals and should not hesitate to kill them, even if they happen to be his own brothers and sons.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 96, 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars&lt;ref name=klos1996/&gt;&lt;ref name=robinson2003/&gt; conclude that the scriptures of Hinduism suggest sentences for any crime must be fair, proportional and not cruel.

;Pacifism
There is no consensus on [[pacifism]] among modern Hindu scholars. The conflict between pacifistic interpretations of Ahimsa and the theories of [[just war]] prescribed by the Gita has been resolved by some scholars such as [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]], as being an allegory,&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, Mohandas K., ''The Bhagavad Gita According to Gandhi'' Berkeley Hills Books, Berkeley 2000&lt;/ref&gt; wherein the battlefield is the soul and Arjuna, the war is within each human being, where human's higher impulses struggle against his own evil impulses.&lt;ref name=fischer1954&gt;Fischer, Louis: ''Gandhi: His Life and Message to the World'' Mentor, New York 1954, pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-human life===
The Hindu precept of 'cause no injury' applies to animals and all life forms. This precept isn't found in the oldest verses of Vedas, but increasingly becomes one of the central ideas between 500 BC and 400 AD.&lt;ref name=chapple16&gt;Christopher Chapple (1993), Nonviolence to Animals, Earth, and Self in Asian Traditions, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-1498-1}}, pages 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W Norman Brown (February 1964), [http://www.epw.in/system/files/pdf/1964_16/5-6-7/the_sanctity_of_the_cow_in_hinduism.pdf ''The sanctity of the cow in Hinduism''], The Economic Weekly, pages 245–255&lt;/ref&gt; In the oldest texts, numerous ritual sacrifices of animals, including cows and horses, are highlighted and hardly any mention is made of Ahimsa to non-human life.&lt;ref&gt;D.N. Jha (2002), ''The Myth of the Holy Cow'', {{ISBN|1-85984-676-9}}, Verso&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven Rosen (2004), Holy Cow: The Hare Krishna Contribution to Vegetarianism and Animal Rights, {{ISBN|1-59056-066-3}}, pages 19–39&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindu texts dated to 1st millennium BC, initially mention meat as food, then evolve to suggestions that only meat obtained through ritual sacrifice can be eaten, thereafter evolving to the stance that one should eat no meat because it hurts animals, with verses describing the noble life as one that lives on flowers, roots and fruits alone.&lt;ref name=chapple16/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Baudhayana]] Dharmasutra 2.4.7; 2.6.2; 2.11.15; 2.12.8; 3.1.13; 3.3.6; [[Apastamba]] Dharmasutra 1.17.15; 1.17.19; 2.17.26–2.18.3; Vasistha Dharmasutra 14.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later texts of Hinduism declare Ahimsa one of the primary virtues, declare any killing or harming any life as against ''dharma'' (moral life). Finally, the discussion in Upanishads and Hindu Epics&lt;ref&gt;Manu Smriti 5.30, 5.32, 5.39 and 5.44; Mahabharata 3.199 (3.207), 3.199.5 (3.207.5), 3.199.19–29 (3.207.19), 3.199.23–24 (3.207.23–24), 13.116.15–18, 14.28; Ramayana 1-2-8:19&lt;/ref&gt; shifts to whether a human being can ever live his or her life without harming animal and plant life in some way; which and when plants or animal meat may be eaten, whether violence against animals causes human beings to become less compassionate, and if and how one may exert least harm to non-human life consistent with ahimsa precept, given the constraints of life and human needs.&lt;ref&gt;Alsdorf pp. 592–593.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 13.115.59–60; 13.116.15–18.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mahabharata permits hunting by warriors, but opposes it in the case of hermits who must be strictly non-violent. [[Sushruta Samhita]], a Hindu text written in the 3rd or 4th century, in Chapter XLVI suggests proper diet as a means of treating certain illnesses, and recommends various fishes and meats for different ailments and for pregnant women,&lt;ref&gt;Kaviraj Kunja Lal Bhishagratna (1907), An English Translation of the Sushruta Samhita, Volume I, Part 2; see Chapter starting on page 469; for discussion on meats and fishes, see page 480 and onwards&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sutrasthana 46.89; Sharirasthana 3.25.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Charaka Samhita]] describes meat as superior to all other kinds of food for convalescents.&lt;ref&gt;Sutrasthana 27.87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Across the texts of Hinduism, there is a profusion of ideas about the virtue of Ahimsa when applied to non-human life, but without a universal consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 3.199.11–12 (3.199 is 3.207 elsewhere); 13.115; 13.116.26; 13.148.17; Bhagavata Purana (11.5.13–14), and the Chandogya Upanishad (8.15.1).&lt;/ref&gt; Alsdorf claims the debate and disagreements between supporters of vegetarian lifestyle and meat eaters was significant. Even suggested exceptions – ritual slaughter and hunting – were challenged by advocates of Ahimsa.&lt;ref&gt;Alsdorf pp. 572–577 (for the Manusmṛti) and pp. 585–597 (for the Mahabharata); Tähtinen pp. 34–36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Mahabharata and the Manusmṛti (5.27–55) contain lengthy discussions about the legitimacy of ritual slaughter.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m12/m12b095.htm Mahabharata 12.260] (12.260 is 12.268 according to another count); 13.115–116; 14.28.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Mahabharata both sides present various arguments to substantiate their viewpoints. Moreover, a hunter defends his profession in a long discourse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03207.htm Mahabharata 3.199] (3.199 is 3.207 according to another count).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the arguments proposed in favor of non-violence to animals refer to the bliss one feels, the rewards it entails before or after death, the danger and harm it prevents, as well as to the karmic consequences of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 39–43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alsdorf p. 589–590; Schmidt pp. 634–635, 640–643; Tähtinen pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Hindu texts discuss Ahimsa and non-animal life. They discourage wanton destruction of nature including of wild and cultivated plants. Hermits ([[sannyasa|sannyasin]]s) were urged to live on a [[fruitarian]] diet so as to avoid the destruction of plants.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt pp. 637–639; Manusmriti 10.63, 11.145&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rod Preece, Animals and Nature: Cultural Myths, Cultural Realities, {{ISBN|978-0-7748-0725-8}}, University of British Columbia Press, pages 212–217&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars&lt;ref&gt;Chapple, C.

Hindu Traditions and Nature: Survey Article. Worldviews: Global Religions, Culture, and Ecology, 10(1), 5–39&lt;/ref&gt; claim the principles of ecological non-violence is innate in the Hindu tradition, and its conceptual fountain has been Ahimsa as their cardinal virtue.

The classical literature of Hinduism exists in many Indian languages. For example, the ''[[Tirukkural]],'' written between 200 BC and 400 AD, and sometimes called the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[Veda]], is one of the most cherished classics on Hinduism written in a South Indian language. The Kural dedicates Chapters 26, 32 and 33 of [[Aram (Kural book)|Book I]] to the virtue of Ahimsa, namely, [[vegetarianism]], [[non-violence|non-harming]], and [[non-killing]], respectively. The Kural says that Ahimsa applies to all life forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projectmadurai.org/pm_etexts/pdf/pm0153.pdf Tirukkural] Translated by Rev G.U. Pope, Rev W.H.

===Modern times===
[[File:Portrait Gandhi.jpg|thumb|[[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]] promoted the principle of Ahimsa very successfully by applying it to all spheres of life, particularly to politics.]]

In the 19th and 20th centuries, prominent figures of Indian spirituality such as [[Shrimad Rajchandra|Shrimad Rajchandraji]]&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=8P0KAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=shrimad+rajchandra+and+gandhiji&amp;dq=shrimad+rajchandra+and+gandhiji&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_7uC9uMjaAhVLqY8KHU3wAbYQ6AEIPTAF &lt;/ref&gt; and [[Swami Vivekananda]]&lt;ref&gt;''Religious Vegetarianism'', ed. [[Kerry S. Walters]] and Lisa Portmess, Albany 2001, p. 50–52.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasised the importance of Ahimsa.

[[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] promoted the principle of Ahimsa, very successful by applying it to all spheres of life, particularly to politics ([[Swaraj]]).&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 116–124.&lt;/ref&gt; His non-violent resistance movement [[satyagraha]] had an immense impact on India, impressed public opinion in Western countries, and influenced the leaders of various [[civil and political rights]] movements such as the American civil rights movement's [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and [[James Bevel]]. In Gandhi's thought, Ahimsa precludes not only the act of inflicting a physical injury, but also mental states like evil thoughts and hatred, unkind behavior such as harsh words, dishonesty and lying, all of which he saw as manifestations of violence incompatible with Ahimsa.&lt;ref name="XXII-XLVII 1986, p. 11-12"&gt;Walli pp. XXII-XLVII; Borman, William: ''Gandhi and Non-Violence'', Albany 1986, p. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi believed Ahimsa to be a creative energy force, encompassing all interactions leading one's self to find satya, "Divine Truth".&lt;ref&gt;Jackson pp. 39–54. Religion East &amp; West. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sri Aurobindo]] criticised the Gandhian concept of Ahimsa as unrealistic and not universally applicable; he adopted a pragmatic non-pacifist position, saying that the justification of violence depends on the specific circumstances of the given situation.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 115–116.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gandhi stated that he viewed "Ahimsa is in Hinduism, it is in Christianity as well as in Islam."&lt;ref name=par/&gt; He added, "Nonviolence is common to all religions, but it has found the highest expression and application in Hinduism (I do not regard Jainism or Buddhism as separate from Hinduism)."&lt;ref name=par/&gt; When questioned whether violence and non-violence is both taught in Quran, he stated, "I have heard it from many Muslim friends that the Koran teaches the use of non-violence. (...&amp;nbsp;The) argument about non-violence in the Holy Koran is an interpolation, not necessary for my thesis."&lt;ref name=par&gt;Prabhu and Rao (1966), [http://gandhiashramsevagram.org/pdf-books/mind-of-mahatma-gandhi.pdf The Mind of Mahatma Gandhi], Encyclopedia of Gandhi's Thoughts, p. 120–121&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mgarat&gt;Gandhi, Mahatma. 1962.

A historical and philosophical study of Ahimsa was instrumental in the shaping of [[Albert Schweitzer]]'s principle of "reverence for life". Schweitzer praised Indian philosophical and religious traditions for ethics of Ahimsa as, "the laying down of the commandment not to kill and not to damage is one of the greatest events in the spiritual history of humankind", but suggested that "not-killing and not-harming" is not always practically possible as in self-defence, nor ethical as in chronic starving during a famine case.&lt;ref&gt;Schweitzer, Albert: [https://archive.org/stream/indianthoughtsan027860mbp#page/n95/mode/2up Indian Thought and its Development], London 1956, pages 82–83&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yoga===
Ahimsa is imperative for practitioners of [[Patañjali]]'s eight limb [[Raja yoga]] system. It is included in the first limb and is the first of five [[Yamas]] (self restraints) which, together with the second limb, make up the code of ethical conduct in Yoga philosophy.&lt;ref name=pyogas3t&gt;

On Âsanas] THE HAṬHA YOGA PRADIPIKA&lt;/ref&gt;
The significance of Ahimsa as the very first restraint in the very first limb of Yoga (Yamas), is that it defines the necessary foundation for progress through Yoga. It is a precursor to Asana, implying that success in Yogasana can be had only if the self is purified in [[Manasa, vacha, karmana|thought, word and deed]] through the self-restraint of Ahimsa.

==Jainism==
{{Main article|Ahimsa in Jainism}}
{{See also|Jain vegetarianism}}
[[File:Ahimsa.svg|thumb|right|The hand with a wheel on the palm symbolises the Jain Vow of Ahimsa. The word in the middle is "Ahimsa". The wheel represents the [[dharmacakra]] which stands for the resolve to halt the cycle of reincarnation through relentless pursuit of truth and non-violence.]]
In Jainism, the understanding and implementation of ''Ahimsā'' is more radical, scrupulous, and comprehensive than in any other religion.&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw, pp. 154–160; Jindal, pp. 74–90; Tähtinen p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Killing any living being out of passions is considered ''hiṃsā'' (to injure) and abstaining from such an act is ''ahimsā'' (noninjury).{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=34}} The vow of ahimsā is considered the foremost among the 'five vows of Jainism'. Other vows like truth (satya) are meant for safeguarding the vow of ahimsā.{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=33}} In the practice of Ahimsa, the requirements are less strict for the lay persons ([[sravakas]]) who have undertaken ''anuvrata'' (Smaller Vows) than for the [[Jain monasticism|Jain monastics]] who are bound by the [[Mahavrata]] "Great Vows".&lt;ref&gt;Dundas pp. 158–159, 189–192; Laidlaw pp. 173–175, 179; ''Religious Vegetarianism'', ed. [[Kerry S. Walters]] and Lisa Portmess, Albany 2001, p. 43–46 (translation of the First Great Vow).&lt;/ref&gt; The statement ''{{IAST|ahimsā paramo dharmaḥ}}'' is often found inscribed on the walls of the [[Jain temple]]s.&lt;ref name=pauldundas160&gt;Dundas, Paul: ''The Jains'', second edition, London 2002, p. 160; Wiley, Kristi L.: ''Ahimsa and Compassion in Jainism'', in: ''Studies in Jaina History and Culture'', ed. Peter Flügel, London 2006, p. 438; Laidlaw pp. 153–154.&lt;/ref&gt; Like in Hinduism, the aim is to prevent the accumulation of harmful karma.&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw pp. 26–30, 191–195.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Mahavira]] revived and reorganised the Jain faith in the 6th or 5th century BCE,&lt;ref&gt;Dundas p. 24 suggests the 5th century; the traditional dating of Mahavira's death is 527 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt; Ahimsa was already an established, strictly observed rule.&lt;ref&gt;Goyal, S.R.: ''A History of Indian Buddhism'', Meerut 1987, p. 83–85.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rishabhanatha]] (Ādinātha), the first Jain [[Tirthankara]], whom modern Western historians consider to be a historical figure, followed by [[Parshvanatha]] (Pārśvanātha)&lt;ref&gt;Dundas pp. 19, 30; Tähtinen p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; the twenty-third [[Tirthankara]] lived in about the 8th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas p. 30 suggests the 8th or 7th century; the traditional chronology places him in the late 9th or early 8th century.&lt;/ref&gt; He founded the community to which Mahavira's parents belonged.&lt;ref&gt;[[Acaranga Sutra]] 2.15.&lt;/ref&gt; Ahimsa was already part of the "Fourfold Restraint" (''Caujjama''), the vows taken by Parshva's followers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sthananga Sutra]] 266; Tähtinen p. 132; Goyal p. 83–84, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; In the times of Mahavira and in the following centuries, Jains were at odds with both Buddhists and followers of the Vedic religion or Hindus, whom they accused of negligence and inconsistency in the implementation of Ahimsa.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas pp. 160, 234, 241; Wiley p. 448; Granoff, Phyllis: ''The Violence of Non-Violence: A Study of Some Jain Responses to Non-Jain Religious Practices'', in: ''Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies'' 15 (1992) pp. 1–43; Tähtinen pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Jain tradition either [[lacto vegetarianism]] or [[veganism]] is mandatory.&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jain concept of Ahimsa is characterised by several aspects. It does not make any exception for ritual sacrificers and professional warrior-hunters. Killing of animals for food is absolutely ruled out.&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw pp. 166–167; Tähtinen p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Jains also make considerable efforts not to injure plants in everyday life as far as possible. Though they admit that plants must be destroyed for the sake of food, they accept such violence only inasmuch as it is indispensable for human survival, and there are special instructions for preventing unnecessary violence against plants.&lt;ref&gt;Lodha, R.M.: ''Conservation of Vegetation and Jain Philosophy'', in: ''Medieval Jainism: Culture and Environment'', New Delhi 1990, p. 137–141; Tähtinen p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Jains go out of their way so as not to hurt even small insects and other minuscule animals.&lt;ref&gt;Jindal p. 89; Laidlaw pp. 54, 154–155, 180.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Jains often do not go out at night, when they are more likely to step upon an insect. In their view, injury caused by carelessness is like injury caused by deliberate action.&lt;ref&gt;Sutrakrtangasutram 1.8.3; Uttaradhyayanasutra 10; Tattvarthasutra 7.8; Dundas pp. 161–162.&lt;/ref&gt; Eating honey is strictly outlawed, as it would amount to violence against the bees.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hemacandra]]: ''Yogashastra'' 3.37; Laidlaw pp. 166–167.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Jains abstain from farming because it inevitably entails unintentional killing or injuring of many small animals, such as worms and insects,&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; but agriculture is not forbidden in general and there are Jain farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Sangave, Vilas Adinath: ''Jaina Community. A Social Survey'', second edition, Bombay 1980, p. 259; Dundas p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretically, all life forms are said to deserve full protection from all kinds of injury, but Jains recognise a hierarchy of life. Mobile beings are given higher protection than immobile ones. For the mobile beings, they distinguish between one-sensed, two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed and five-sensed ones; a one-sensed animal has touch as its only sensory modality. The more senses a being has, the more they care about non-injuring it. Among the five-sensed beings, the precept of non-injury and non-violence to the rational ones (humans) is strongest in Jain Ahimsa.&lt;ref&gt;Jindal pp. 89, 125–133 (detailed exposition of the classification system); Tähtinen pp. 17, 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jain theology, it does not matter how correct or defensible the violence may be, one must not kill any being, and "non-violence is one's highest religious duty".{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=160}}{{sfn|Markham|Lohr|2009|p=71}}

[[Mahatma Gandhi]], who was greatly influenced by Jainism, said:{{sfn|Rudolph|Rudolph|1984|p=171}}
{{quote|No religion in the World has explained the principle of ''Ahiṃsā'' so deeply and systematically as is discussed with its applicability in every human life in Jainism. As and when the benevolent principle of ''Ahiṃsā'' or non-violence will be ascribed for practice by the people of the world to achieve their end of life in this world and beyond, Jainism is sure to have the uppermost status and Mahāvīra is sure to be respected as the greatest authority on ''Ahiṃsā''.{{cn|date=November 2018}}}}

==Buddhism==
&lt;!--"Buddhist devotion#Chanting" is linking here.--&gt;
{{further information|Noble Eightfold Path|Buddhist ethics#Killing, causing others to kill|Buddhism and violence|Engaged Buddhism}}
In Buddhist texts ''Ahimsa'' (or its [[Pāli]] cognate {{IAST|avihiṃsā}}) is part of the [[Five Precepts]] ({{IAST|Pañcasīla}}), the first of which has been to abstain from killing. This precept of Ahimsa is applicable to both the Buddhist layperson and the monk community.&lt;ref name="Williams2005p398"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Williams |title=Buddhism: Critical Concepts in Religious Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pgrZnmKUKtgC |year=2005|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-33226-2 |page=398 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bodhi Bhikkhu|title=Great Disciples of the Buddha: Their Lives, Their Works, Their Legacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=teUGAAAAYAAJ |year=1997|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=978-0-86171-128-4 |pages=387 with footnote 12}};&lt;br&gt;Sarao, p. 49; Goyal p. 143; Tähtinen p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamotte, Etienne 1988, p. 54-55"&gt;Lamotte, pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ahimsa precept is not a commandment and transgressions did not invite religious sanctions for laypersons, but their power has been in the Buddhist belief in karmic consequences and their impact in afterlife during rebirth.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|p=187}} Killing, in Buddhist belief, could lead to rebirth in the hellish realm, and for a longer time in more severe conditions if the murder victim was a monk.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|p=187}} Saving animals from slaughter for meat is believed to be a way to acquire merit for better rebirth. These moral precepts have been voluntarily self-enforced in lay Buddhist culture through the associated belief in karma and rebirth.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|pp=187–191}} The Buddhist texts not only recommended Ahimsa, but suggest avoiding trading goods that contribute to or are a result of violence:

{{Quote|
These five trades, O monks, should not be taken up by a lay follower: trading with weapons, trading in living beings, trading in meat, trading in intoxicants, trading in poison.
|Anguttara Nikaya V.177|Translated by Martine Batchelor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martine Batchelor|title=The Spirit of the Buddha|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fL3mykqlOJcC&amp;pg=PT59 |year=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-17500-4 |page=59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Unlike lay Buddhists, transgressions by monks do invite sanctions.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|p=192}} Full expulsion of a monk from ''sangha'' follows instances of killing, just like any other serious offense against the monastic ''nikaya'' code of conduct.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|p=192}}

===War===
Violent ways of punishing criminals and prisoners of war was not explicitly condemned in Buddhism,&lt;ref&gt;Sarao p. 53; Tähtinen pp. 95, 102.&lt;/ref&gt; but peaceful ways of conflict resolution and punishment with the least amount of injury were encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 95, 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurt A. Raaflaub, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FMxgef2VJEwC&amp;pg=PA61 ''War and Peace in the Ancient World.''] Blackwell Publishing, 2007, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; The early texts condemn the mental states that lead to violent behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonviolence is an overriding theme within the [[Pali Canon]].&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; While the early texts condemn killing in the strongest terms, and portray the ideal queen/king as a pacifist, such a queen/king is nonetheless flanked by an army.&lt;ref name="Tessa Bartholomeusz 2002, page 41"&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that the Buddha's teaching on nonviolence was not interpreted or put into practice in an uncompromisingly pacifist or anti-military-service way by early Buddhists.&lt;ref name="Tessa Bartholomeusz 2002, page 41"/&gt; The early texts assume war to be a fact of life, and well-skilled warriors are viewed as necessary for defensive warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; In Pali texts, injunctions to abstain from violence and involvement with military affairs are directed at members of the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]; later Mahayana texts, which often generalise monastic norms to laity, require this of lay people as well.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart McFarlane in Peter Harvey, ed., ''Buddhism.'' Continuum, 2001, pages 195–196.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early texts do not contain just-war ideology as such.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that a [[suttas|sutta]] in the ''Gamani Samyuttam'' rules out all military service. In this passage, a soldier asks the Buddha if it is true that, as she/he has been told, soldiers slain in battle are reborn in a heavenly realm. The Buddha reluctantly replies that if she/he is killed in battle while her/his mind is seized with the intention to kill, she/he will undergo an unpleasant rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, pp. 125–126. Full texts of the sutta:[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn42/sn42.003.than.html].&lt;/ref&gt; In the early texts, a person's mental state at the time of death is generally viewed as having a great impact on the next birth.&lt;ref&gt;Rune E.A. Johansson, ''The Dynamic Psychology of Early Buddhism.'' Curzon Press 1979, page 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Buddhists point to other early texts as justifying defensive war.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, pp. 40–53. Some examples are the ''Cakkavati Sihanada Sutta'', the ''Kosala Samyutta'', the ''Ratthapala Sutta'', and the ''Sinha Sutta''. See also page 125. See also Trevor Ling, ''Buddhism, Imperialism, and War.'' George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd, 1979, pages 136–137.&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the ''Kosala Samyutta'', in which King [[Pasenadi]], a righteous king favored by the Buddha, learns of an impending attack on his kingdom. He arms himself in defence, and leads his army into battle to protect his kingdom from attack. He lost this battle but won the war. King Pasenadi eventually defeated King [[Ajatasattu]] and captured him alive. He thought that, although this King of [[Magadha]] has transgressed against his kingdom, he had not transgressed against him personally, and Ajatasattu was still his nephew. He released Ajatasattu and did not harm him.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi, Bhikkhu (trans.) (2000). ''The Connected Discourses of the Buddha: A New Translation of the Samyutta Nikaya''. Boston: Wisdom Publications. {{ISBN|0-86171-331-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return, the Buddha said (among other things) that Pasenadi "is a friend of virtue, acquainted with virtue, intimate with virtue", while the opposite is said of the aggressor, King Ajatasattu.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, pp. 49, 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Theravada commentaries, there are five requisite factors that must all be fulfilled for an act to be both an act of killing and to be karmically negative. These are: (1) the presence of a living being, human or animal; (2) the knowledge that the being is a living being; (3) the intent to kill; (4) the act of killing by some means; and (5) the resulting death.&lt;ref&gt;Hammalawa Saddhatissa, ''Buddhist Ethics.'' Wisdom Publications, 1997, pages 60, 159, see also Bartholomeusz page 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Buddhists have argued on this basis that the act of killing is complicated, and its ethicization is predicated upon intent.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that in defensive postures, for example, the primary intention of a soldier is not to kill, but to defend against aggression, and the act of killing in that situation would have minimal negative karmic repercussions.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, pp. 44, 121–122, 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar]], there is circumstantial evidence encouraging Ahimsa, from the Buddha's doctrine, ''"Love all, so that you may not wish to kill any."'' Gautama Buddha distinguished between a principle and a rule. He did not make Ahimsa a matter of rule, but suggested it as a matter of principle. This gives Buddhists freedom to act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_buddha/04_02.html#03_02 The Buddha and His Dhamma]. Columbia.edu.

'''''Angels in the Outfield''''' is a 1994 American [[family film|family]] [[Sports film|sports]] [[fantasy film|fantasy]] [[Comedy-drama|comedy-drama film]] that is a [[remake]] of the 1951 film [[Angels in the Outfield (1951 film)|of the same name]]. The film stars [[Danny Glover]], [[Tony Danza]] and [[Christopher Lloyd]] (the two latter actors previously worked together on ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]''), and features several future stars, including [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] (in the lead), [[Adrien Brody]], [[Matthew McConaughey]], and [[Neal McDonough]]. It spawned two [[direct-to-video]] sequels, ''[[Angels in the Endzone]]'' and ''[[Angels in the Infield]]''. The film was released less than a month before the [[1994–95 Major League Baseball strike|1994 MLB Baseball Players Strike]], which forced the league to cancel the playoffs and the World Series.

== Plot ==
Young foster child Roger and his friend J.P. love to sneak into baseball games of the hopelessly dreadful [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|California Angels]].

Still in limited contact with his widower father, Roger asks when they will be a family again. His father replies sarcastically, "I'd say when the Angels win the pennant." Taking his father's words literally, Roger prays for God to help the Angels win. After he prays, a star, unseen by Roger, twinkles in the sky.

Then, in a game against the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] which Roger and J.P. attend, he sees a group of [[angels]] led by Al helping the team. Although Roger can see them quite clearly, everyone else can only explain the seemingly impossible acts as freak occurrences.

Roger's unique ability to see which players are receiving help from angels leads their skeptical manager, George Knox to keep him around as a [[good luck charm]] and consultant, including ending the use of profanity as a nod to the original film. Due to the much needed help, the Angels start to win games and make a surprising second-half surge to the top of their [[division (sport)|division]]. Meanwhile, Roger's father permanently gives up [[child custody|custody]] of his son, believing it's in Roger's best interest.

As Roger laments his loss, J.P. accidentally reveals to antagonistic sports broadcaster Ranch Wilder that Roger has the ability to see angels, and that George has been winning through the advice Roger's given him. Hoping to destroy George due to a longtime rivalry between the two, Ranch informs the press of this and their owner Hank Murphy threatens to relieve George of his management responsibilities. Roger comes clean to his caretaker Maggie Nelson about his special ability and at a press conference they and the entire team defend George in front of the press. Moved by their faith, Murphy allows George to remain as manager of the Angels.

During the championship game none of the angels show up to help the team. Later on, Al explains that championships must be played without help from the angels and that he was there just checking on pitcher Mel Clark who will be one of them soon as he has been a chain smoker. Mel starts struggling, and is getting tired after throwing 159 pitches. When George goes out to the mound, everyone thinks he's going in to take Mel out, but instead, George gives him some motivation, and with encouragement from Roger, the team, and finally, the entire stadium audience as well as owner Murphy and the broadcasters.

The Angels ultimately win the final game of the regular season without the help of the angels and clinch the division pennant over the rival [[Chicago White Sox]], thanks to Mel. Murphy dismisses Ranch because of his denigration of the team. The film ends with George adopting both Roger and J.P. as he wants to try be a father. J.P. sees Al at the window and says "I knew it could happen." Al circles around the house and says "We're always watching" and flying off into the stars, which re-enact a baseball game.

==Reception==
The film has a rating of 35% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 20 reviews, with an [[Weighted arithmetic mean|average rating]] of 4.2/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1055833-angels_in_the_outfield |title=Angels in the Outfield (1994) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=October 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the original film, which focused on the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] as the team in heavenly need, the 1994 remake focuses on the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|California Angels]], who did not exist when the original film was released in 1951.  Some scenes in the original film were shot at [[Wrigley Field (Los Angeles)]], home of the original [[Los Angeles Angels (PCL)]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]].  The [[Walt Disney Company]], which distributed it, was a minority owner of the Angels at the time. The film did, however, premiere at the Pirates' home stadium at the time, [[Three Rivers Stadium]] in [[Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/movies/20030124video0124fnp3.asp| accessdate=August 21, 2009| title=Multi Media: Adrien Brody going darker and deeper| date=January 24, 2003| first=Barbara| last=Vancheri| publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=t2lGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zugMAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=danny%20glover%20pittsburgh&amp;pg=6319%2C2844707&lt;/ref&gt; The premiere would be the only reference to the Pirates, due to the two teams playing in separate leagues (Angels in the [[American League]], Pirates in the [[National League]]) and the film being released three years before the start of [[interleague play]]. The two teams would finally meet head-to-head for the first time in 2002 in Anaheim.

===Box office===
The film opened at #4 at the North American box office, making $8,916,463 [[USD]] in its opening weekend. It went on to gross $50.2 million at the box office domestically.

In [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]], '''aparigraha''' ({{lang-sa|अपरिग्रह}}) is the [[virtue]] of [[Non-possession|non-possessiveness]], non-grasping or non-greediness.&lt;ref name=artidhand&gt;Arti Dhand (2002), The dharma of ethics, the ethics of dharma: Quizzing the ideals of Hinduism, Journal of Religious Ethics, 30(3), pages 347-372&lt;/ref&gt;

Aparigrah is the opposite of ''parigrah'', and refers to keeping the desire for possessions to what is necessary or important, depending on one's life stage and context. The [[precept]] of ''aparigraha'' is a self-restraint ([[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]]) from the type of [[greed]] and avarice where one's own material gain or happiness comes by hurting, killing or destroying other human beings, life forms or nature.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Lauricella (2013), Judging by the way animals are treated: Gandhi as a manifestation of Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras, Gandhi Marg Quarterly, 35(4): 655–674&lt;/ref&gt;

Aparigraha is related to and in part a motivator of [[dāna]] (proper charity), both from giver's and receiver's perspective.&lt;ref&gt;SC Jain (2012), Spiritual Guidance in Achieving and Sustaining Organizational Excellence, Purushartha: A Journal of Management Ethics and Spirituality, 4(2): 1-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N Kazanas (2013), Vedic Tradition and Civilization, in On India: Self-Image and Counter-image (Editor: AN Balslev), SAGE Publications, {{ISBN|978-8132110927}}, pages 27-41&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and meaning==
Aparigraha is a [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] in Sanskrit, made of "''a-''" and "''parigrah''". The prefix "''a-''" means "non-", so "''&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;parigrah''" is the opposite of "''parigrah''", so ''aparigraha'' is speech and actions that oppose and negate ''parigraha.''

The word ''parigrah'' means ‘to amass’, ‘to crave’, ‘to seek’, ‘to seize’, and ‘to receive or accept’ material possessions or gifts from others.&lt;ref name=kjain/&gt; The word also includes the idea of doing good with the expectation of benefit or reward, not just for the sake of merely doing good. Parigraha includes the results as well as the intent; in other words, it means the attitudes of craving, possessiveness, and hoarding, but also the things that have been acquired because of those attitudes.&lt;ref name=kjain&gt;K Jain, Indologica Taurinensia, Vol. 30, Issue 11, pages 139-146&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of aparigraha as one of the means to liberate the soul from the cycle of birth and death was first laid down by first ''[[tirthankara]]'' in [[Jainism]], [[Rishabhanatha|Rishabhdeva]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=-YnWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=aparigraha+Rishabhdev&amp;dq=aparigraha+Rishabhdev&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiEuaq_ofnaAhUVTI8KHUgCDagQ6AEIQjAG&lt;/ref&gt;

Monier-Williams states that the word ''"parigraha"'' has roots in the Vedic texts as well, referring to fencing an altar, enclosing something, assuming or putting on a dress or receiving something.&lt;ref name=mmwparigraha&gt;Sir Monier Monier-Williams, ''Parigraha'', A Sanskrit-English Dictionary: Etymologically and Philologically Arranged with Special Reference to Cognate Indo-European Languages, Oxford University Press (Reprinted: Motilal Banarsidass), {{ISBN|978-8120831056}}, page 593&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Brahmana]]s and later texts, the term contextually means accepting or taking a gift, acquiring, possessing, claiming, controlling something such a property, or assistance, or constraining force on others.&lt;ref name=mmwparigraha/&gt; In some texts, the root reflects the state of marriage or having a family.&lt;ref name=mmwparigraha/&gt;

The virtue of aparigraha means taking what is truly necessary and no more. In Yoga school of Hinduism, this concept of virtue has also been translated as "abstaining from accepting gifts",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/yogasutr.htm The Yoga Sutras of Pantanjali] Verse 2.30&lt;/ref&gt; "not expecting, asking, or accepting inappropriate gifts from any person", and "not applying for gifts which are not to be accepted".&lt;ref name=jw&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/yogasystemofpata00wooduoft#page/178/mode/2up The yoga system of Patanjali] James Wood (Translator), Harvard University Press, pages 178-182&lt;/ref&gt; The concept includes in its scope non-covetousness,&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, Mathur et al (2010), New Horizons in Indian Management, {{ISBN|978-8178357119}}, page 280&lt;/ref&gt; and non-[[compulsive hoarding|possessiveness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Guiding Yoga's Light: Yoga Lessons for Yoga Teachers | author = Nancy Gerstein | page = 140 | year = 2005 | publisher = Pendragon | isbn = 978-0-9722809-8-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor states, aparigraha includes the psychological state of "letting go and the releasing of control, transgressions, fears" and living a content life unfettered by anxieties.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Taylor (2008), End-of-Life Yoga Therapy: Exploring Life and Death, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF YOGA THERAPY, No. 18, pages 97-103&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jainism==
{{Jainism}}
Aparigraha is one of the virtues in [[Jainism]]. It is also one of the five vows that both householders (''[[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|Śrāvaka]]'') and ascetics must observe. This Jain vow is the principle of limiting one’s possessions (''parimita-parigraha'') and limiting one’s desires (''iccha-parimana'').&lt;ref name=kjain/&gt;

In Jainism, worldly wealth accumulation is considered as a potential source of rising greed, jealousy, selfishness and desires.&lt;ref name=valueeduc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/jainism/living/aparigraha.shtml Aparigraha - non-acquisition], Jainism, BBC Religions&lt;/ref&gt; Giving up emotional attachments, sensual pleasures and material possession is a means of liberation, in Jain philosophy.&lt;ref name=mjwcr&gt;Mark Juergensmeyer and Wade Clark Roof (Editors), Encyclopedia of Global Religion, SAGE Publications, {{ISBN|978-0761927297}}, page 609&lt;/ref&gt; Eating enough to survive is considered more noble than eating for indulgence.&lt;ref name=valueeduc/&gt; Similarly, all consumption is more appropriate if it is essential to one's survival, and inappropriate if it is a form of hoarding, show off or for ego. Non-possession and non-attachment are a form of virtue, and these are recommended particularly in later stages of one's life.&lt;ref name=valueeduc&gt;MR Mehta (in Editor: P. Kapur), Value Education, Volume 1, {{ISBN|81-7835-566-3}}, pages 329-330&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahiṃsā]], Aparigraha is the second most important virtue in Jainism.&lt;ref name=mjwcr/&gt;
==Hinduism==
{{Hinduism}}
In the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga Sūtras]] (II.30), ''aparigraha'' is listed as the fifth [[Yamas]] or code of self-restraint, after with  [[Ahimsa]] (nonviolence), [[Satya]] (non-falsehoods, truthfulness), [[Asteya]] (not stealing), and [[Brahmacharya]] (sexual chastity in one's feelings and actions).&lt;ref name=jw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georg Feuerstein and Jeanine Miller (1997), The Essence of Yoga, {{ISBN|978-0892817382}}, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
अहिंसासत्यास्तेय ब्रह्मचर्यापरिग्रहाः यमाः ॥३०॥

Non-violence, Non-falsehood, Non-stealing, Non-cheating (celibacy, chastity), and Non-possessiveness are the five Yamas. (30)
|Patanjali|Yoga Sutra 2.30&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashtangayoga.info/source-texts/yoga-sutra-patanjali/chapter-2/ Yoga Sutra], Sadhana Pada, [[sutra]] 30&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Aparigraha is thus one of the five essential restraints (''yamas'', "the don'ts") in Hinduism, that with five essential practices (''niyamas'', "the dos") are suggested for right, virtuous, enlightened living. While Yoga Sutras distills the ten ''yamas'' and ''niyamas'', these virtues appear, in various discussions, in Vedic texts.&lt;ref&gt;Mathew Clarke (2014), Handbook of Research on Development and Religion, Elgar Reference, {{ISBN|978-0857933577}}, page 83&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of ethical theory in Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Hornett (2013), Ancient Ethics and Contemporary Systems: The Yamas, the Niyamas and the forms of Organization, in Leadership through the Classics (Editor: Prastacos et al), Springer, {{ISBN|978-3642324444}}, Chapter 5, pages 63-69&lt;/ref&gt;

James Wood states,&lt;ref name=jw/&gt; ''aparigraha'' is the virtue of abstaining from appropriating objects because one understands the disadvantages in "acquiring them, keeping them, losing them, being attached to them, or in harming them". Patanjali suggests that greed and coveting material wealth increases greed and possessiveness, a cycle that distracts from good reasons for activity that should motivate a person, and ultimately to a state where a person seeks material wealth without effort and by harming, hurting or impoverishing someone else, or some living creature.&lt;ref name=jw/&gt; Yoga Sutra's sutra 2.39 states,&lt;ref&gt;[https://yogainternational.com/article/view/non-possessiveness-let-go-of-what-keeps-you-from-moving-forward Non-Possessiveness: Let Go of What Keeps You From Moving Forward] Irene Petryszak, Yoga International (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Restraint from possessiveness and greed, or ''aparigraha'', leads one away from harmful and injurious greed, refraining from harming others, and towards the spiritual state of good activity and understanding one's motives and origins.&lt;ref name=jw/&gt;&lt;ref name=jw2/&gt; The virtue of non-coveting, non-possessing is a means of [[Sādhanā]], path of spiritual existence.&lt;ref name=jw2/&gt; In outer world, ''aparigraha'' manifests as non-possessiveness with simple living; while in psychological terms, it is a state of non-attachment, non-craving and one that envelops the sense of contentment.&lt;ref&gt;KM George (2014), Toward a Eucharistic Missiology, International Review of Mission, 103(2), 309-318&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to charity and conservation==
Some&lt;ref&gt;Shonil A. Bhagwat, Yoga and Sustainability, The Journal of Yoga, Fall/Winter 2008, Volume 7, Number 1, pages 1-14&lt;/ref&gt; suggest ''aparigraha'' implies the concepts of charity (dāna) and conservation. Taking and wasting more of nature, or from others, is inconsistent with the ethical precept of aparigraha.&lt;ref&gt;C. Betal (2008), CONSERVATION OF ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT THROUGH YOGIC LIFESTYLE, Journal of Environmental Research And Development Vol, 2(4), pages 905-911&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DK Taneja (2014), Yoga and health, Indian Journal of Community Medicine, 39(2), pages 68-73&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars&lt;ref name=mjwcr/&gt; suggest ''aparigraha'' allies with ideas that inspire environmental and ecological sustainability. Aparigraha suggests the reduction of waste and adds a spiritual dimension to preventing destructive consumption of ecosystems and nature.

==Difference from Asteya ==
[[Asteya]] is also one of the five vows taken by [[Jain]] ascetic monks to attain liberation.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=abLZNdYxay8C&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=Jainism+asteya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjp8Mb9ovnaAhVL6Y8KHTyVCHkQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Jainism%20asteya&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; It is the virtue of non-stealing and not wanting to appropriate, or take by force or deceit or exploitation, by deeds or words or thoughts, what is owned by and belongs to someone else.&lt;ref&gt;Donna Farhi (2011), Yoga Mind, Body &amp; Spirit: A Return to Wholeness, MacMillan, {{ISBN|978-0805059700}}, pages 10-11&lt;/ref&gt; Aparigraha, in contrast, is the virtue of non-possessiveness and non-clinging to one's own property, non-accepting any gifts or particularly improper gifts offered by others, and of non-avarice, non-craving in the motivation of one's deeds, words and thoughts.&lt;ref name=jw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Frawley, Yoga and the Sacred Fire: Self-Realization and Planetary Transformation, Motilal Banarsidas, {{ISBN|978-8120827462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1657">'''Asher ben David''' was a [[Hachmei Provence|Provençal Kabbalist]] born in [[Vauvert|Posquières]], who flourished about the middle of the thirteenth century. He was the son (some say, grandson) of [[Abraham ben David|Abraham ben David of Posquières]], and a pupil of his uncle [[Isaac the Blind]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1924-asher-ben-david article] in Jewish Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

Asher ben David is one of the earliest cabalistic writers. He was the author of ''Perush Shelosh Esreh Middot'' or (''Commentary on the [[Thirteen Attributes of Mercy|Thirteen Attributes]] of God''), and his most important work, the ''Sefer ha-Yiḥud'' (''The Book of Unity'', an explanation of the Tetragrammaton and the ''[[sefirot]]''), which is the first Kabbalistic treatise to be preserved integrally. He identifies, on the one hand, the ten Sefirot with the ten spheres of the philosophers, and, on the other, explains the thirteen attributes of God as derivations of the three middle Sefirot: (love, justice, mercy), which he designates as fundamental principles.

According to [[Gershom Sholem]] Asher ben David is the main transmitter of Kabbalistic doctrines to the Catalan rabbinic schools, and in particular the [[School of Girona]], in the early thirteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Scholem, ''Origins of the Kabbalah'', Princeton, 1987, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The middle country of [[reed bed]]s''}} is, in [[Japanese mythology]], the world between [[Takamagahara]] ([[Heaven]]) and [[Yomi]] ([[Hell]]). In time, the term became another word for the country or the location of [[Japan]]. The term can be used interchangeably with '''Toyoashihara no Nakatsukuni''' (豊葦原中国). There is a great dispute among historians about where exactly in Japan the term originally referred to.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Perhaps the term was considered appropriate to describe Japan because the land was damp and covered with [[Reed bed|reeds]] (ashi) in ancient times. The meaning of naka (middle) in the word nakatsukuni is based upon the world view of ancient peoples, where nakatsukuni indicates the real world or country between [[Takamagahara]] in the heavens and [[Yomi|Yomi no kuni]] in the netherworld.

[[Symbol]]s used in [[astrology]] overlap with those used in [[astronomy]] because of the historical overlap between the two subjects. Frequently used symbols include signs of the [[zodiac]] and for the [[classical planet]]s. These have their origin in medieval Byzantiny, but in their current form are a product of the European [[Renaissance astrology|Renaissance]]. Other symbols for [[astrological aspect]]s are used in various astrological traditions.

==History and origin==

Symbols for the [[classical planet]]s, zodiac signs, aspects, lots, and the lunar nodes appear in the medieval Byzantine codices in which many ancient horoscopes were preserved.&lt;ref name=neugebauer-1975&gt;{{cite book

"It is now possible to trace the medieval symbols for at least four of the five planets to forms that occur in some of the latest papyrus horoscopes ([ [[Oxyrhynchus Papyri|P.Oxy.]] ] 4272, 4274, 4275 [...]). That for Jupiter is an obvious monogram derived from the initial letter of the Greek name. Saturn's has a similar derivation [...] but underwent simplification. The ideal form of Mars' symbol is uncertain, and perhaps not related to the later circle with an arrow through it. Mercury's is a stylized caduceus."&lt;/ref&gt; The symbols for Jupiter and Saturn are identified as monograms of the initial letters of the corresponding Greek names, and the symbol for Mercury is a stylized [[caduceus]].&lt;ref name=jones-1999 /&gt; A. S. D. Maunder finds antecedents of the planetary symbols in earlier sources, used to represent the gods associated with the classical planets.

Symbols for Uranus and Neptune were created shortly after their discovery. For Uranus, two variant symbols are seen. One symbol, [[File:Uranus symbol.svg|15px|Uranus]], invented by [[Johann Gottfried Koehler|J. G. Köhler]] and refined by [[Johann Elert Bode|Bode]], was intended to represent the newly discovered metal [[platinum]]; since platinum, sometimes confused with white gold, was found by chemists mixed with iron, the symbol for platinum combines the alchemical symbols for [[iron]], ♂, and [[gold]], ☉.&lt;ref name=bode-uranus&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another symbol, [[File:Uranus's astrological symbol.svg|15px|Uranus]], was suggested by Lalande in 1784. In a letter to Herschel, Lalande described it as "un globe surmonté par la première lettre de votre nom" ("a globe surmounted by the first letter of your name").&lt;ref name="Francisca"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Francisca Herschel|date=1917|title=The meaning of the symbol H+o for the planet Uranus|bibcode=1917Obs....40..306H|work=The Observatory}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2007-08-05--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After Neptune was discovered, the Bureau des Longitudes proposed the name Neptune and the familiar trident for the planet's symbol.&lt;ref name=gould-neptune&gt;{{cite book

The astrological symbols for the first three objects discovered at the beginning of the 19th century —[[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[2 Pallas|Pallas]], and [[3 Juno|Juno]]—were also created after their discovery. Firstly, they were listed as planets, and half a century later, renamed as Asteroids. Shortly after [[Giuseppe Piazzi]]'s discovery of [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], a group of astronomers ratified the name, proposed by the discoverer, and chose the sickle as a symbol of the planet.&lt;ref name=bode-1801&gt;{{cite book

Olbers, having previously discovered and named one new planet (as the asteroids were then classified), gave Gauss the honor of naming his newest discovery. Gauss decided to name the planet for the goddess [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], and also specified that the symbol should be the altar of the goddess with the [[Sacred fire of Vesta|sacred fire]] burning on it.&lt;ref name=mcbeh-v15&gt;{{cite book

[[Pluto]], like Uranus, has multiple symbols in use. One symbol, a [[monogram]] of the letters ''PL'' (which could be interpreted to stand for Pluto or for astronomer [[Percival Lowell]]), was announced with the name of the new planet by the discoverers on May 1, 1930.&lt;ref name=popular-astronomy&gt;{{cite journal

| page = 415
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another symbol, which was popularized in Paul Clancy's astrological publications, is based on the symbol for Mercury, with the circle and arc of Mercury trading positions. This symbol is described by [[Dane Rudhyar]] as "suggest[ing] the planetary character of the Pluto mind by the circle, floating above the open cup."  Although, this meaning is readily debatable due to Blavatskian origins, rather than a properly traditional understanding, such as may be found in the hermetic sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The symbol for the [[centaur (minor planet)|centaur]] [[2060 Chiron|Chiron]], a key with the letter K (for discoverer [[Charles T. Kowal]]) was proposed by astrologer Al Morrison, who presented the symbol as "an inspiration shared amongst Al H. Morrison, Joelle K.D. Mahoney, and Marlene Bassoff."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Aspects===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5636">The '''Awareness Course''' is the education programme of the [[Awareness Foundation]]. The course has been described  as helping "Christians develop an informed response to the religious and cultural diversity around them by being centered in their faith and secure in their identity."&lt;ref&gt;St. Paul's K Street, Washington: http://www.stpauls-kst.com/node/61{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is co-written by retired bishop [[Michael Marshall (bishop)|Michael Marshall]] and [[Nadim Nassar]], who is the only Syrian priest in the [[Church of England]].

The Awareness Course has been taught in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States of America]], [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] in the [[Middle East]] and in [[Hong Kong]]. Denominations offering the Awareness Course include  the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Church of England]], the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], the [[Greek Orthodox Church]], [[Presbyterian]], [[Methodist]] and [[Baptist]] churches, Middle Eastern Evangelical churches, and several charismatic evangelical churches in the UK. Teachers are known as "course leaders" and their role is primarily that of a facilitator and motivator rather than lecturer.

== Modules ==
The Awareness Course comprises a number of course modules or varying lengths:

1. 8 Session DVD Module

Eight sessions designed to last 60 to 90 minutes each depending on the Course Leader. Every  session includes two 12 to 16 minute videos presented by Nadim Nassar. The videos are professionally produced and the videos for The Diversity Code feature guest speakers from other Christian traditions (e.g. charismatic evangelical) and Jewish and Islamic scholars.

a. The Diversity Code

Today, diversity is a major issue for us all.  The Diversity Code uses a series of ‘Biblical Case Studies’ to reveal the wonderful examples for dealing positively with diversity that Jesus set throughout His life and teachings, as did St Paul. The course also studies the lessons learned by the early Church as she struggled to accept her universal mission.

2. 5 Session Module (Suitable For Lent)

Five sessions designed to last 60 minutes each. Every  session includes one 15 minute video presented by Nadim Nassar. The videos are professionally produced and the videos feature guest speakers from other Christian traditions (e.g. charismatic evangelical) and Jewish and Islamic scholars.

a. Living in a Global Village

This shorter course examines how participants can affirm their faith in the midst of a new, globalised world. The sessions cover topics such as hospitality &amp; generosity in faith, preaching the Gospel by living it in our daily lives, and how we can celebrate difference and diversity without having to compromise our faith. Originally marketed as a Lent course, Living in a Global Village is described as being "suitable for any time of the year".

3. Day/Half-Day Workshop

Designed to last either a complete day or half a day according to the Course Leader’s wishes. The workshop includes four 15 minute videos presented by Nadim Nassar. The videos are professionally produced and the videos feature guest speakers from other Christian traditions (e.g. charismatic evangelical) and Jewish and Islamic scholars.

a. Speak Out!

This workshop is subtitled, ‘How to articulate our faith, and why’. To live an abundant life, Christians must reclaim their faith and be able to relate its meaning and its joys to others. Participants study why we should openly and respectfully share our faith, and how we can do so positively with people of other faiths and none. The Foundation say that 'Speak Out!' is intended to "help people of faith to understand the need for us to be able to speak about our faith to others, especially in today's increasingly fragmented world, and to guide people in how to speak out whilst retaining respect for people of other faiths, or none."

“Christians must be able to speak out with authority about their faith and how it applies to the real issues of the day,” says Nadim Nassar, the Director of the Awareness Foundation and author of the course materials.

The workshop, which features powerful videos with speakers from the three Abrahamic faiths, enables participants over half a day to understand the importance of their own role in spreading the message that faith matters, and that the true values of the Abrahamic faiths are love, forgiveness, respect and understanding.

== Course materials ==
Each module is  packaged as DVD which contains the teaching videos, a course leader's book (approximately 32 pages) plus study sheets for those attending the course. These modules are available without charge within the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Awareness Course on the Awareness Foundation's website: {{cite web|url=http://www.awareness-foundation.co.uk/index.php/course |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928072143/http://www.awareness-foundation.co.uk/index.php/course |archivedate=2013-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personnel ==
[[Michael Marshall (bishop)|Michael Marshall]] is President of the Awareness Foundation and [[Nadim Nassar]] is director. They are co-founders of the Awareness Foundation and co-authors of the Awareness Course. The director of the Awareness Course is the foundation's operations director, St John Wright, who has been with the Awareness Foundation since 2004; he is the son of British jazz guitarist [[Denny Wright]].

'''Azad Peroz''', known in Arabic sources as '''Azad Firuz''', was a [[Sasanian]] nobleman who served as the governor of [[Eastern Arabia|Bahrain]] during the reign of [[Khosrow II]] (590-628). The Arabs gave him the nickname of "''Mukabir''" (the mutilating), because he cut the hands and feet of other people.&lt;ref name="iranicaonline.org"&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/azad-firuz-governor-of-bahrain ''ĀZĀD FĪRŪZ'', (A. Tafażżolī), '''Encyclopaedia Iranica''']&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of a man named Gushnasp.

According to a tradition, a caravan of gifts sent by the Sasanian governor [[Vahriz]] to Khosrow II was attacked by the Banu Yarbu tribe. Khosrow II then ordered the governor of Bahrain, Azad Peroz, to punish the tribe. To do that, Azad Peroz invited the Banu Yarbu tribe to the Moshakkar Castle in [[Al Hajar Mountains|Hajar]], where he killed everyone except the boys, who were sent in captivity to [[Estakhr]].

During the [[Spread of Islam|rise of Islam]], Azad Peroz converted to the religion and later died during the reign of [[Caliph]] [[Umar]].&lt;ref name="iranicaonline.org"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="128481">The '''Bahá'í Faith and Native Americans''' has a history reaching back to the lifetime of [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] and has multiplied its relationships across the Americas. Individuals have joined the religion and institutions have been founded to serve Native Americans and conversely have Native Americans serve on Bahá'í institutions.

By 1963 Bahá'í sources claim members of some 83 tribes of Native Americans had joined the religion.&lt;ref name="stats"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Bahá'í Faith: 1844–1963: Information Statistical and Comparative, Including the Achievements of the Ten Year International Bahá'í Teaching &amp; Consolidation Plan 1953–1963 |publisher = [[Hand of the Cause|Hands of the Cause]] Residing in the Holy Land |year=1963 |location=Haifa, Israel | page = 19 | url = http://bahai-library.com/handscause_statistics_1953-63&amp;chapter=1#22 | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In North America diversification is an ever-present theme in Bahá'í history. Native American Indians have been attracted to the [[Bahá'í Faith]] in increasing numbers since the 1940s; currently there are several thousand Indian and [[Eskimo]] Bahá'ís, especially in rural Alaska and among the [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] and [[Lakota people|Lakota]] peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | editor-last = Miller |editor-first =Timothy | last =Stockman | first = Robert H. | title = America's alternative religions |contribution = The American Baha'i Community in the Nineties | contribution-url=http://bahai-library.com/stockman_american_community_nineties | publisher = SUNY Press |year= 1995 |location=Albany, NY, USA| pages = | url =https://books.google.com/?id=og_u0Re1uwUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA243#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false| isbn = 978-0-7914-2397-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Central and South American indigenous there are also substantial populations of native Bahá'ís.

==Native religion==

===Acceptance of spiritual founders===
[[Shoghi Effendi]], head of the religion 1921–1957, stated: "The fundamental principle enunciated by [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the followers of his Faith firmly believe, is that religious truth is not absolute but relative, that Divine Revelation is a continuous and progressive process, that all the great religions of the world are divine in origin, that their basic principles are in complete harmony, that their aims and purposes are one and the same, that their teachings are but facets of one truth, that their functions are complementary, that they differ only in the nonessential aspects of their doctrines, and that their missions represent successive stages in the spiritual evolution of human society."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Effendi |first=Shoghi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |title=The Promised Day Is Come |publisher=US Bahá'í Publishing Trust |year=1980 |edition=revised  |page=v |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/PDC/pdc-1.html#gr1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In principle, a Bahá'í can certainly affirm that Messengers of God have indeed been sent to all peoples, according to Bahá'í belief, but that there is simply no conclusive way to attest legendary culture heroes individually. Under no circumstances does this prevent a real appreciation of such legends, and of the spiritual and cultural values enshrined in them. Thus, Bahá'í authorities may consider adding the ''category'' of (rather than ''names'' of) Messengers of God to First Nations, or Messengers of God to Indigenous Peoples. The problem now is no longer the principle, but rather the question of ''names''.&lt;ref name="Buck"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buck |first=Christopher |title=Native Messengers of God in Canada? A test case for Baha'i universalism |journal=The Bahá'í Studies Review |volume= |issue= |pages=97–132 |publisher=Association for Bahá'í Studies English-Speaking Europe |location=London |year=1996 |url=https://www.msu.edu/~buckc/Buck_PDFs/Buck_Native_1996.pdf |accessdate=2009-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719111713/https://www.msu.edu/~buckc/Buck_PDFs/Buck_Native_1996.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Canada took a position of advocacy on behalf of [[First Nations]] Canadians in its formal submission to the [[Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples]] in the fall of 1993 on behalf of indigenous people (not in relation to their religion, per se.)&lt;ref name="Buck"/&gt; Bahá'í [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]] to regions with aboriginal peoples have extended [[Bahá'í Faith and the unity of religion|Bahá'í universalism]] in religion to a recognition of the richness and authenticity of native cultural values. Individual Bahá'ís are free to express their own understanding, but this does not imply endorsement by the institutions of the religion though such recognition has been supported by local Bahá'í policy validating the concept of First Nations [[Manifestations of God]]. Explicit recognition of individual native messengers of God has yet to be formalised in Bahá'í doctrine. The quote from an authenticated source most directly reflecting on the issue is:

{{quote|In ancient times the people of America were, through their northern regions, close to Asia, that is, separated from Asia by a strait. For this reason, it hath been said that crossing had occurred. There are other signs which indicate communication.

As to places whose people were not informed of the appearance of Prophets, such people are excused. In the Qur'án it hath been revealed: 'We will not chastise them if they had not been sent a Messenger' (Q. 17:15).

Undoubtedly in those regions the Call of God must have been raised in ancient times, but it hath been forgotten now.&lt;ref name="Buck"/&gt;}}

In this particular context, the expression "Call of God" ({{lang|fa|nidá-yi iláhí}}) is a transparent, according to Christopher Buck,&lt;ref name="Buck"/&gt; reference to Prophets of God and who give [[revelation]]. Scholars like Susan Maneck&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newsgroup | title = Review of Christopher Buck's "Native Messengers of God in Canada?: A test case for Bahá'í universalism" | author = Susan Maneck | date = September 4, 2003 | newsgroup =''Baha'i Studies'' |url=http://www.mail-archive.com/bahai-st@list.jccc.net/msg00432.html | accessdate = 2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and William Collins&lt;ref name="collins"&gt;{{Cite journal | last =Collins | first = William P. | title = Commentary on Christopher Buck's "Native Messengers of God in Canada?: A test case for Bahá'í universalism" | journal = The Bahá'í Studies Review | volume = 08 | issue = 1998 | pages = | publisher = | location = | year = 1998 | url =http://bahai-library.com/bsr/bsr08/831_commentaries.htm | issn = |accessdate = 2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; have taken note of the strength of this quote. However the language is not specific. The [[Universal House of Justice]] notes that "The Bahá'í Teachings do not explicitly confirm, nor do they rule out, the possibility that Messengers of God have appeared in the Americas. In the absence of a clear Text the Universal House of Justice has no basis for issuing the kind of statement you propose which would confirm, "in principle, that God sent Manifestations to the indigenous peoples of the Americas.""&lt;ref name="Buck"/&gt; Nevertheless the figure of Deganawida, [[The Great Peacemaker]], is mentioned as a leading example in scholarly research;&lt;ref name="Buck"/&gt;&lt;ref name="collins"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gomez"&gt;{{Cite conference | first = Aram | last = Gomez | title = The Tree of Peace and the Coming of Bahá'u'llah | booktitle =Irfan Colloquia | pages = | conference = `Irfán Colloquium |date = March 25–27, 1994 | location = Bahá'í National Center: Wilmette, Illinois, US | url =http://irfancolloquia.org/2/gomez_tree | accessdate = 2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; others mentioned by individuals include [[Quetzalcoatl]] and [[Viracocha]].&lt;ref name="Buck2"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Buck | first = Christopher | title = Bahá'í Universalism &amp; Native Prophets| journal = Studies in the Bábí and Bahá'í Religions| volume = 13; Reason and Revelation: New Directions in Bahá'í Thought| editor-last = Fazel | editor-first = Seena | editor2-last = Danesh| editor2-first = John | pages = 172–201 | publisher = Kalimát Press | location =Los Angeles | year = 2002 | url =http://christopherbuck.com/Buck_PDFs/Buck_Native-Prophets_2002.pdf | issn = | accessdate = 2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Ruhe]], a former member of the Universal House of Justice, has written mentioning his own view of Deganawida as a Prophet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ruhe |first = David S. | title = A New Evolution: Religious Bonding for World Unity | journal = Journal of Bahá'í Studies | volume = 06 | issue = 4 | pages =45–57 | publisher = the Association for Bahá'í Studies&amp;nbsp;– North America | location = | year = 1995 | url = http://www.bahai-studies.ca/journal/past-issues | issn = | accessdate = 2010-05-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100527001611/http://www.bahai-studies.ca/journal/past-issues| archivedate= 27 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since no individual or institution can add to Bahá'í scripture it is impossible to add a specific name to a list of accepted [[Manifestation of God|Manifestations of God]] that would be binding on all Bahá'ís and Bahá'í institutions.&lt;ref name="Buck"/&gt; However individuals and institutions may accept for their own purposes that various cultural heroes may have been in fact a [[Manifestation of God]] and Bahá'ís and institutions of the religion can accept the fact that sacred Indian tradition has mentioned specific names for individuals acting in the role of a [[Prophet]].&lt;ref name="Addison&amp;Buck"&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Addison | first = Donald Francis | last2 = Buck | first2 = Christopher | title = Messengers of God in North America Revisited: An Exegesis of "Abdu'l-Bahá's Tablet to Amír Khán | journal = Online Journal of Bahá'í Studies | volume = 01 | pages = 180–270 | publisher =Association for Bahá'í Studies English-Speaking Europe | location = London | year = 2007 | url =http://bahaistudies.net/onlinejournal/OJBS_1_Buck_Addison_MessengersofGod.pdf | ISSN= 1177-8547 | accessdate = 2009-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretation of prophecy===
In 1986 North American Bahá'í Lee Brown gave a talk at the 1986 Bahá'í ''Continental Indigenous Council'' held at [[Tanana Valley]] Fairgrounds, [[Fairbanks]], Alaska, which was recorded&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Brown | first = Lee | title = Native American Indian prophecies&amp;nbsp;– Lee Brown | work = | publisher = | year = 1986 | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKQ9mkyTSqk | accessdate = 2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and transcribed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = Lee | last = Brown | title = North American Indian Prophecies |booktitle = Continental Indigenous Council | publisher = Bahá'í Academic Library Online | year = 1986 | url =http://bahai-library.com/brown_american_indian_prophecies | accessdate = 2009-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;—it includes his interpretation of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], especially [[Hopi]], prophecies. Brown also appeared with Martha Many Grey Horses on a Bahá'í program discussing these prophecies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode | title = Native American Indian prophecies&amp;nbsp;– Lee Brown and Martha Many Grey Horses | episodelink = | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8LUogwVDk4 | series = The Spiritual Revolution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Guaymi]] Bahá'ís have stated there are prophecies from their own tribe's religion that they interpret to relate to the Bahá'í Faith. The prophecies of the [[Chilam Balam]] have been examined as well.&lt;ref name="Buck2"/&gt;

There has been comment among prominent Bahá'ís about the [[White Buffalo Calf Woman]] and the appearance of the [[white buffalo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Contacting the indigenous==

===First contact===
The first dated contact between the Bahá'í Faith and Indigenous Americans was second hand through the life of [[Honoré Jackson]] who had been involved in a [[First Nations]] protest movement in Canada circa the early 1880s and then in the later 1890s joined the religion but after some efforts in Canada in the New York area he was not much heard of after circa 1910.&lt;ref name=Vanden&gt;{{cite book|author=Will C. van den Hoonaard|title=The Origins of the Bahá’í Community of Canada, 1898-1948|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ntLfAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18|date=30 October 2010|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press|isbn=978-1-55458-706-3|pages=18–35, 43–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===`Abdu'l-Bahá===
In 1912 then head of the religion [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] took a [[`Abdu'l-Bahá's journeys to the West|journey to the West]] from what was then Palestine. On one leg of his trips as he was leaving Canada, on the way back to the States, and he traveled through several villages.&lt;ref name=Vanden/&gt; As the train passed through the town of [[Belleville, Ontario]], a four-year-old [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] boy, Jimmy Loft, was sitting on a fence as the train passed. `Abdu'l-Bahá took that moment to stand up and, facing the window, smile and wave. Loft was so surprised he toppled off the fence. In May 1948 he became one of the first native American Bahá'ís of Canada.

====Talk at the Maxwell's Home in Montreal====
During his [[`Abdu'l-Bahá's journeys to the West|tour of North America]], `Abdu'l-Bahá gave a talk on September 2, 1912 in the Montreal home of [[William Sutherland Maxwell]] (later named a [[Hand of the Cause]] by [[Shoghi Effendi]] in 1951)  and [[May Maxwell]], the parents of [[Rúhíyyih Khanum|Mary Maxwell]], the future Amatu'l-Bahá Rúhíyyih Khánum, wife of Shoghi Effendi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=[['Abdu'l-Baha]] |first= |date=1982 |title=Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by Abdu'l Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912  | url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/PUP/ |chapter-url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/PUP/pup-101.html | chapter= 2 September 1912, Talk at Home of Mr. and Mrs. William Sutherland Maxwell, 716 Pine Avenue West, Montreal, Canada | location= |publisher=Bahai Publishing Trust, 2nd Edition |isbn=978-0877431725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Consider this Canadian country during the early history of Montreal when the land was in its wild, uncultivated and natural condition. The soil was unproductive, rocky and almost uninhabitable—vast forests stretching in every direction. What invisible power caused this great metropolis to spring up amid such savage and forbidding conditions? It was the human mind. Therefore, nature and the effect of nature's laws were imperfect. The mind of man remedied and removed this imperfect condition, until now we behold a great city instead of a savage unbroken wilderness. Before the coming of Columbus America itself was a wild, uncultivated expanse of primeval forest, mountains and rivers—a very world of nature. Now it has become the world of man. It was dark, forbidding and savage; now it has become illumined with a great civilization and prosperity. Instead of forests, we behold productive farms, beautiful gardens and prolific orchards. Instead of thorns and useless vegetation, we find flowers, domestic animals and fields awaiting harvest. If the world of nature were perfect, the condition of this great country would have been left unchanged.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Tablet to Amr Khan====
A tablet of Abdu'l-Bahá's undated but certainly before his death in 1921 and probably after 1892, is called the Tablet to Amr Khan, in which he acknowledges that "the Call of God" must have arisen in the Americas though its spiritual affect had been forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

====`Abdu'l-Bahá's Tablets of the Divine Plan====
`Abdu'l-Bahá also wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book ''[[Tablets of the Divine Plan]]''. The sixth of the tablets was the first to mention [[Latin America]]n regions and was written on April 8, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919—after the end of the [[World War I|First World War]] and the [[Spanish flu]]. The sixth tablet was translated and presented by [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] on April 4, 1919, and published in ''[[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]]'' magazine on December 12, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Abbas |first1=`Abdu'l-Bahá |others=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab, trans. and comments. | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 |url=http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt; After mentioning the need for the message of the religion to visit the Latin American countries `Abdu'l-Bahá continued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Attach great importance to the indigenous population of America. For these souls may be likened unto the ancient inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula, who, prior to the Mission of Muḥammad, were like unto savages. When the light of Muḥammad shone forth in their midst, however, they became so radiant as to illumine the world. Likewise, these Indians, should they be educated and guided, there can be no doubt that they will become so illumined as to enlighten the whole world ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = `Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink = `Abdu'l-Bahá |origyear = 1916-17 |year = 1991 |title = Tablets of the Divine Plan |edition = Paperback |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, IL |isbn = 0-87743-233-3 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/TDP/tdp-14.html.iso8859-1#gr7 |page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

French representing the national assembly and [[Luther Standing Bear]] offered a prayer and spoke on peace. Other speakers included Robert Theiss, Joseph R. Scherer, Emmett R. Smith, J. Kam Machida, W. J. Clarendon, [[Nipo Strongheart]], and Willard P. Hatch and a farewell by Shahnaz Waite.

[[Shoghi Effendi]], who was named `Abdu'l-Bahá's successor, wrote a [[Telegraphy|cable]] on May 1, 1936 to the [[Bahá'í administration#National|Bahá'í Annual Convention]] of the United States and Canada, and asked for the systematic implementation of `Abdu'l-Bahá's vision to begin and its first large focus was the entire southern American region and its peoples.&lt;ref name="alamb"/&gt; In his cable he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Appeal to assembled delegates ponder historic appeal voiced by 'Abdu'l-Bahá in ''Tablets of the Divine Plan''. Urge earnest deliberation with incoming National Assembly to insure its complete fulfillment. First century of Bahá'í Era drawing to a close. Humanity entering outer fringes most perilous stage its existence. Opportunities of present hour unimaginably precious. Would to God every State within American Republic and every Republic in American continent might ere termination of this glorious century embrace the light of the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh and establish structural basis of His World Order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Shoghi |last = Effendi |authorlink = Shoghi Effendi |year = 1947 |title = Messages to America |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Committee |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |oclc= 5806374 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/MA/ma-16.html.iso8859-1?query=Appeal%7Cto%7Cassembled%7Cdelegates%7Cponder%7Chistoric&amp;action=highlight#gr2 | pages = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the May 1st cable, another cable from Shoghi Effendi came on May 19 calling for permanent [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]] to be established in all the countries of Latin America. The Bahá'í [[National Spiritual Assembly]] of the United States and Canada was appointed the Inter-America Committee to take charge of the preparations. During the 1937 Bahá'í North American Convention, Shoghi Effendi cabled advising the convention to prolong their deliberations to permit the delegates and the National Assembly to consult on a plan that would enable Bahá'ís to go to Latin America as well as to include the completion of the outer structure of the [[Bahá'í House of Worship]] in Wilmette, Illinois.&lt;ref name="alamb"/&gt; In 1937 the ''First Seven Year Plan'' (1937–44), which was an international plan designed by Shoghi Effendi, gave the American Bahá'ís the goal of establishing the Bahá'í Faith in every country in Latin America. With the spread of American Bahá'ís communities and assemblies began to form in 1938 across Latin America.&lt;ref name="alamb"/&gt;

Across the Americas by 1947 the Bahá'í Faith had contacted peoples among the Eskimos of Alaska and Greenland, the Cree Indians of Prairie Provinces, Canada, the Cherokee Indians in North Carolina, the Oneida Indians in Wisconsin, the Omaha Indians in Nebraska, the Seminole Indians in Florida, the Mexican Indians in Mexico, the Indians of the San Blas Islands, the Indians of Chichicastenango in Guatemala, the Mayans in Yucatán, the Patagonian Indians in Argentina, the Indians of La Paz in Bolivia and the Inca Indians in Peru.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/compilation_teaching_aboriginal_indigenous Teaching Among Aboriginal and Indigenous People by Shoghi Effendi] Compiled by Research Department of the Universal House of Justice, Published in Compilation of Compilations Volume 3 pages 203-225&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/writings/shoghieffendi/mbw/sec-71.html All-America Intercontinental Conference-- Second Message] Messages To The Bahá'í World: 1950-1957, pages 146-156&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944 Gerardo Vega, of Costa Rica, was the first Latin-American native to pioneer when he began work in Panama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = A New Baha'i Era Begins | journal = Bahá'í News |date=November 1944 | number = 171 |pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regional committees overseeing various countries of Latin and South America were appointed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Inter-America News Regional Committees |journal=Bahá'í News |date=August 1946 |number=186 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Retrospectively a stated purpose for the committee was to facilitate a shift in the balance of roles from North American guidance and Latin cooperation to Latin guidance and North American cooperation.&lt;ref name="http"/&gt; Back in North America, the first all-Indian assembly in the Americas was first established in 1948 on the [[Omaha Indian Reservation]] at [[Macy, Nebraska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last =Francis |first=N.

By 1961 a number of developments had been achieved.&lt;ref name="19th"/&gt; There was the election of the Bolivian national assembly—representative of a community the vast majority of whom were of the [[Aymara ethnic group|Aymara people]]. Some thirteen hundred of these Indians, in over one hundred localities had joined the religion and over twenty local assemblies in Bolivia had been elected. There were elections of Indian assemblies in Ecuador, Guatemala and Mexico—regions of the former Incas, Mayas, and Aztecs and the formation four assemblies representative of Canadian Indians in the Yukon, Alberta and Saskatchewan. At that time there were over forty Indian and Eskimo tribes represented in the Bahá'í Community throughout the Western Hemisphere—more than double the number in 1957. In 1961 each country of a regional assembly of southern South America elected its own National Spiritual Assembly.&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt; In 1961 the [[Hands of the Cause]] of the Americas took special note of the spread of the religion among the Indians across the continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Hands of the Western Hemisphere Recount signs of victory among American Indians| journal = Bahá'í News |date=March 1961 |issue=360 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paraguay's national convention was witnessed by Hand of the Cause, Dr. Ramatu'llah Muhajir. At the convention Dr. Muhajir and the delegates drew up plans for reaching the Indian populations as well as ways to reinforce the communities that already existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Latin American Conventions Elect First NSA's; Paraguay | journal = Bahá'í News |date=July 1961 | number = 353 |pages=4, 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still in 1961 the National Spiritual Assembly of Panama sent two official representatives, Edna Moses and Donald R. Witzel, to a congress of natives on the [[San Blas Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = San Bias Indian Congress Invites Baha'i Representation | journal = Bahá'í News |date=August 1961 | number = 365 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bahá'ís presented an outline of the religion. A chief countered that other religionists had presented their religions as a means to divide the people from their tribal religion.

Before 1963 the first two all-Indian Local Spiritual Assemblies in South America were Huanuni and then Vilcollo, Bolivia—by 1963 there were twenty five such assemblies in Bolivia and about 1000 Baha'is among the Bolivian Indian peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/uhj_ministry_custodians Ministry of the Custodians An Account of the Stewardship of the Hands of the Cause 1957-63] by Universal House of Justice, pp. 84, 140, 189&lt;/ref&gt; A team formed to promulgate the religion—a chief of the [[Peigan 147|Peigan Reserve]], also chair of its first Bahá'í assembly, and an elected member of the Band Council for the Peigan Band of the [[Blackfoot]] and John Hellson, a Bahá'í formerly of Cornwall, England, now of Alberta, who is an adopted member of the [[Mohawk nation]]. Together they carried letters of introduction to the chiefs of all the [[Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation]] in Ontario and Quebec and were welcomed with a special ceremony on some of the Reserves. Their itinerary included Reserves of [[Snuneymuxw First Nation|Nanaimo]] and [[X̱wemelch'stn|Capilano]] of British Columbia, [[Ohsweken]], [[Kettle Point 44, Ontario|Kettle Point]], [[Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory, Ontario|Tyendinaga]], and [[Curve Lake First Nation 35, Ontario|Curve Lake]] of Ontario, and [[Kahnawake]], Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Indian-White Teaching Team Visits Canadian Indian Reserves| journal = Bahá'í News |date=August 1961 | number = 365 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1963 there was a small group in Pedro Juan Caballero in Costa Rica and some of whom were from the "Caygüa", who were possibly the [[Kadiweu people]].&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt; In the United States, following initial presences among several Indian nations in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1990 the first assembly entirely composed of indigenous people in Brazil was elected from the [[Mura people]] in [[Beruri]], Brazil.&lt;ref name="basic"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Cameron, G. |author2=Momen, W. |year= 1996 |title= A Basic Bahá'í Chronology |publisher= George Ronald |location=Oxford, UK |isbn= 0-85398-404-2 |pages =259, 272, 410, 445, 451, 467, 469}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 Elizabeth Dahe, a long-time Bahá'í and [[Hopi]] elder, invited the other Hopi elders to gather and meet [[Kevin Locke (musician)|Kevin Locke]] who presented the claims of the Bahá'í Faith directly to 100 Hopi elders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Hopi Elders Gather to Hear the Message of Bahá'u'lláh | newspaper = Bahá'í International News Service | number = 324 |date = September 15, 1994 | url = http://www.bcca.org/bahaivision/docs/hopi2.html |accessdate = 2009-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'ís claim nearly half of the Chilean Bahá'í community is of the indigenous Mapuche people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis |first=Connee |title=The Mapuche People of Chile |work=The Chilean Temple Initiative |publisher=The National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States |year=2007 |url=http://www.chilean-temple.org/content/view/17/27/ |accessdate=2008-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725164050/http://www.chilean-temple.org/content/view/17/27/ |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural relationships and challenges===

The cultural norms in the Bahá'í Faith have gone through major transitions.&lt;ref name="Christchurch"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Momen | first = Moojan | editor-last = McGlinn | editor-first = Sen | title = Soundings: Essays in Bahá'í Theology | publisher = : Open Circle Publishing | chapter =Is the Baha'i Faith a World Religion? | chapterurl =http://bahai-library.com/momen_bahai_world_religion | year = 1989 | location = Christchurch, NZ | pages = 55–64 | url = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first occurred at about the turn of the 20th century when the religion became known beyond its mainly Muslim Middle-Eastern population and spread to Christian North America and Europe. The foundations of this achievement had been laid from the earliest days of the new religion when [[Bahá'u'lláh]] in two of his writings from the Baghdad period addressed Christian issues. Then towards the end of the nineteenth century, the famous Bahá'í scholar, [[Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl]], extended these foundations by writing extensively on Bahá'í approaches to the New and Old Testaments. This was followed by the conversion of numerous Jews, in Iran, and Christians, in Syria and Egypt, to the religion. It was Syrian Christian converts in particular who were largely responsible for taking the Bahá'í Faith to Christian North America, from where there was further spread to Europe and Australia. See also [[`Abdu'l-Bahá's journeys to the West]]. The second major breakthrough started post-World War II when the religion began to spread rapidly in the villages of the Third World. Some idea of the extent of this comparatively sudden change can be gleaned from the fact that prior to 1954, approximately 94% of the world Bahá'í population consisted of Iranians. By 1989, that figure is about 7% while Bahá'ís from the non-Muslim Third World represent some 90% of the Bahá'ís.&lt;ref name="Christchurch"/&gt;

In Latin and South America the religion spread in the 1940s following specific plans of promulgating the religion.&lt;ref name="alamb"/&gt; A stated purpose for the coordinating committees appointed to oversee the process was to facilitate a shift in the balance of roles from North American leading guidance and Latin cooperation to Latin leading guidance and North American cooperation.&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Historical Background of the Panama Temple| journal = Bahá'í News |date=April 1972 | number = 493 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process was well underway by 1950 and was to be enforced about 1953. However a period of "re-activating" core communities was necessary in 1950, while other communities failed to re-elect their institutions initially&lt;ref name="re-activate"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Notes on Latin America | journal = Bahá'í News |date=May 1951 | number = 243 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the regional committees continued operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Latin-American News | journal = Bahá'í News |date=April 1950 | number = 230 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless regional National Spiritual Assemblies for the region were elected in 1950&lt;ref name="statement"&gt;{{cite web| title= Comunidad Bahá'í en Chile| publisher= National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Chile| url= http://data.bahai.cl/bahaichile/webnuevo/com_chile/com_chile.htm| accessdate= 2008-03-03| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080316042132/http://data.bahai.cl/bahaichile/webnuevo/com_chile/com_chile.htm#| archivedate= 2008-03-16| deadurl= yes| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1951.&lt;ref name="communidad"&gt;{{cite web | title = La Comunidad Bahá'í en Costa Rica | work = Official Website of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Costa Rica | publisher =Comunidad de Bahá'í de Costa Rica|url=http://www.bahaicr.org/cr.htm | accessdate = 2009-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1961 most Latin and South American countries had their own national assembly.&lt;ref name="Custodians"&gt;{{cite book|author= Rabbani, Ruhiyyih (Ed.) |authorlink=Rúhíyyih Khanum |year= 1992 |title= The Ministry of the Custodians 1957-1963 |publisher= Bahá'í World Centre | pages = 256 |isbn= 0-85398-350-X |url= http://bahai-library.com/uhj_ministry_custodians&amp;chapter=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Africa there was widespread conversions to the religion following the 1950s.&lt;ref name="UofC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview Of World Religions |work=General Essay on the Religions of Sub-Saharan Africa |publisher=Division of Religion and Philosophy, [[University of Cumbria]] |url=http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/sub/geness.html |accessdate=2008-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209082606/http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/sub/geness.html |archivedate=2007-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was emphasized that western pioneers be self-effacing and focus their efforts not on the colonial leadership but on the native Africans&lt;ref name="BN283"&gt;{{cite journal | title = United States Africa Teaching Committee; Goals for this year | journal = Bahá'í News |date=June 1954 | number = 283 | pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; - and that the pioneers must show by actions the sincerity of their sense of service to the Africans in bringing the religion and then the Africans who understand their new religion are to be given freedom to rise up and spread the religion according to their own sensibilities and the pioneers to disperse or step into the background.&lt;ref name="BN283"/&gt; [[Enoch Olinga]] is specifically mentioned as an example of this process unfolding as he arose out of Uganda and repeated the quick growth of the religion.

Unlike the spread of Christianity within Indian country in the United States, the Bahá'í Faith has never been associated with a fortification of colonial occupation, Euro-American assimilation, or forced conversions of Native Americans. Indeed in 1960 [[Hand of the Cause]] [[Rúhíyyih Khánum]] asked for forgiveness for the injustices her race had done and praised their great past.&lt;ref name="Addison&amp;Buck"/&gt; And in 1963 anthropologist [[Alice Beck Kehoe]], a well known researcher of Native Americans, observed that 
"[The Bahá'í Faith] does not deny the validity of native Indian beliefs, [and] ... appeals to many Indians who are seeking a religion that is neither exclusively Indian nor dominated by white values and customs."&lt;ref name="Addison&amp;Buck"/&gt; However another researcher observed in 2007: "Most white Canadians and Americans have no clue with respect to how constantly they reinforce their own cultural assumptions, right or wrong, and pile them upon Indians, never willing or even interested in hearing our own Native view. I agree that the Bahá'ís in Canada and the U.S. have made some good headway in the honoring and validating native spiritual prophecies and principles. However, much more transformation along the lines of intercultural interactions within the Bahá'í international community needs to take place. In particular, I am referring specifically to most (but not all) of our non-Native Bahá'ís who find it impossible to break through the inner barriers of their own Euro-American culture."&lt;ref name="Addison&amp;Buck"/&gt;

Patterns of encounters between non-Aboriginal Baha'is and Aboriginal people in British Columbia were studied and the result demonstrated a middle ground between romanticization and violent confrontation was possible, though not fully realized. However, in the words of an historian the encounter with the religion "has nevertheless served as a potent source of empowerment for Aboriginal adherents."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis | last = Horton |first = Chelsea Dawn |title = "As ye have faith so shall your powers and blessings be": The Aboriginal-Bahá'í Encounter in British Columbia |publisher =Dept. of History, Simon Fraser University (Masters of Arts Thesis) |year = 2005| url =http://summit.sfu.ca/item/9262 | accessdate = 2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditions of the people weren't left and again served to solidify community.

===Bahá'í radio===

In early 1973, Raul Pavon leased Radio Turismo station and initiated fourteen hours of daily broadcasts. None involved had backgrounding in running a radio station. Initial success was based on playing local and national music genre. In July 1973 the national assembly added the goal of a radio station to its budget and a committee to create programing. Programming was developed and aired in eight cities between 15-minute segments up to hour-long bilingual (Spanish-Quichua) programs of [[Prayer in the Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í prayers]], and drawing from [[Bahá'í literature]] as well as information of its world-wide community. In 1975, training workshops were organized for scriptwriters. Other trainings continued in 1976. By 1976 the committee had produced 1286 hours of programming at a cost of approximately $2000 as well as documentation to support sister projects. A low-power [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] radio station which was finally granted in 1977. There were challenges of coordination and staffing to overcome. Outside trainers or professional staff were able to come in 1977, 1978, and 1980. A commission was developed, typically including a body composed of an indigenous person, a "white" person, technical experts, senior Bahá'ís and a veteran of the station, with a balance of majority of local people while also one member to be literate and capable of dealing with the administration of the commission.

With regular feedback from experienced institutions operating out of the [[Bahá'í World Centre]], progress was maintained and Dr. David Ruhe, then a member of the [[Universal House of Justice]], visited in 1980 and acted as liaison between the radio station and the Audio-Visual Department at the Bahá'í administrative offices.&lt;ref name="Kurt"/&gt; In 1980 almost the entire staff traveled to Peru to make extensive presentations to the international Bahá'í media conference in [[Puno]] where the second Bahá'í Radio station would be set up. It was not until 1981 that a suitable director was able to take up service by combining the qualities of being a Bahá'í, an experienced radio professional, and an Ecuadoran and able to volunteer. In addition to Quinteros, six other indigenous had systematically begun to serve at the station as full-time staff as well as larger numbers of part-time staff amounting to some 200 persons including indigenous youth in the first four years of the operation of the station. Indigenous staff were able to conduct workshops for other indigenous staff, in Spanish and Quichua, for the first time in 1981. Staff for projects in Bolivia, Chile and Peru participated in successive training and Ecuadoran staff traveled to Peru and Bolivia to assist in those projects. The Commission wrote to the Chilean Bahá'ís about the development of their radio station that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The most important and indispensable thing is to maintain a happy, loving, spirited team-family. Try to have as high a percentage as possible of your staff native. At least 75%. It is far better to let a native do something wrong than not to give him the opportunity by having a foreigner do it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By 1983 training of staff at Radio Bahá'í Ecuador was almost entirely in the hands of indigenous staff.&lt;ref name="Kurt"/&gt; There has also been training at the [[Amoz Gibson Training Center]] for Bahá'í Media in Puerto Rico operated by CIRBAL ([[Centro para Intercambio Radiofonico Bahá'í de America Latina]].)

===Native American Bahá'í Institute===
[[File:BahaiPrayerHogan.JPEG|thumb|A prayer [[hogan]] at the Native American Bahá'í Institute]]
In 1978 some 60 Native Bahá'ís and their pioneer friends (40 of whom were from Navajo-Hopi land) attended the U.S. Bahá'í National Convention at the invitation of the U.S. National Spiritual Assembly to honor the achievement of winning the first goal of the 5-Year-Plan—the establishment of 25 Local Spiritual Assemblies on Indian Reservations. They wanted to build a "Bahá'í place" on the Navajo Reservation, and they wanted the Convention to show their support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = About NABI—Its History | work = Official Website of the Native American Bahá'í Institute | publisher = National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United States | year = 2009 | url = http://www.nativeamericanbi.org/about.asp

Two years later, the [[Houck, Arizona|Houck]], Arizona property was secured and the institute became manifest. Named the Native American Bahá'í Institute (NABI) by the National Spiritual Assembly, NABI was designated an agency of the National Spiritual Assembly thereby becoming one of the five permanent school and institutes. Over the years it has been focused upon various goals. Since 1998, it has been designated a Regional Training Institute by the National Spiritual Assembly, and has been immersed in advancing the goals of the Training Institute process among Native Americans.

===The Trail of Light and Native Bahá'í Councils===

====Great Council Fire====
In late February 1963 Native Bahá'ís and others gathered for a "Great Council Fire" which was attended by [[Hand of the Cause]] [[Dhikru'llah Khadem]] at a time when members of some 34 American tribes were represented within the religion and twenty six were present.&lt;ref name=BNApril1963/&gt;&lt;ref name="bahai-news.info"/&gt;

====First Native Bahá´í Council of North America====
During the international convention for the election of the [[Universal House of Justice]] in Haifa in April 1978 a meeting was held with representatives of the other circumpolar national Bahá'í communities: Finland, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Denmark (on behalf of Greenland), and Canada. It was decided then to form a ''Continental Indigenous Council'' committee under the supervision of the National Spiritual Assembly of Alaska, and a four-member Eskimo-Indian team was formed to travel for 45 days in 10 European countries during the summer. The Indian members of the team were Scott Tyler of the United States and Melba Loft of Canada; the Eskimos were Ida Bergamaschi and Maynard Eakan of Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Alaska - A Baha'i community grows, matures; | journal = Bahá'í News |date=October 1981 | number = 607 |ISSN=0195-9212 |pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for the Trail of Light occurred during preparations for the first Baha'i Native Council, held in 1978 on the [[Yakama Indian Reservation]] in Washington State when the national assemblies of Canada, Alaska and the United States were discussing the event. Another inspiration for the Trail of Light was the concept of promulgating the religion among the indigenous peoples in the [[Pacific Rim]] that was described by the [[Hand of the Cause]] [[Rahmátu'llah Muhájir]] in 1978. The Trail of Light, also known as ''Camino del Sol'', was defined as a process whereby native Bahá'ís engaged with diverse native peoples about a number of issues including promulgating their religion as well as organizing councils for the people and encouraged discovery of mutual cultural links across the native peoples. The first ''Trail of Light'' traveling trip by 22 members of the religion occurred spontaneously immediately after the council.&lt;ref name="BN594-Trail"&gt;{{cite journal | title = 'Trail of Light' Native American teaching effort follows North American Baha'i Native Council | journal = Bahá'í News |date=September 1980 | number = 594 |ISSN=0195-9212 |pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second Native Bahá'í Council of North America====
In 1980 an estimated 1,000 native American members of the religion and their guests gathered for the second American Bahá'í Native Council at a [[pow-wow]] along with [[Hand of the Cause]] [[Dhikru'llah Khadem]] and [[Amoz Gibson]], with long contact with Indian populations&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/francis_gibson_biography Amoz Everett Gibson the First Black Member of the Universal House of Justice] by Richard Francis, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and then a member of the Universal House of Justice. The event was sponsored by the Bahá'í Continental Indigenous Council which was composed of three indigenous believers from each of the national assemblies of North America.&lt;ref name="BN594-Council"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Native Council - Nearly 400 indigenous believers in North America attend historic gathering at Mother Temple of West | journal = Bahá'í News |date=September 1980 | number = 594 |ISSN=0195-9212 |pages=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the council meeting, a three-day training and deepening program developed plans and teams of Bahá'ís to travel to different regions to promulgate the religion among the native Americans. These teams of Native American Bahá'ís from Alaska, Canada and the 48 contiguous United States represented 10 tribes under the name ''Trail of Light''.&lt;ref name="BN620"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Latin America; 'Trail of Light' sets many hearts ablaze | journal = Bahá'í News |date=November 1982 | number = 620 |ISSN=0195-9212 |pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One team visited six native villages in Alaska from July 18 to August 1.&lt;ref name="BN594-Trail"/&gt; Team members were Tina Salomon, an [[Osage Nation|Osage]]-[[Cherokee]] from [[Sparks, Nevada]]; Mary Jane Tevuk, an [[Inupiat people|Inupiat]] Eskimo from [[Nome, Alaska]]; Regina Steffes, a [[Navajo people|Navajo]]-[[Oneida tribe|Oneida]] from [[Fontana, California]]; and team captain [[Chester Kahn]], a Navajo from [[Houck, Arizona]] (later a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States); Bill Ekomiak, an [[Inuit]] Eskimo from [[Daysland]], [[Alberta]], Canada; Johan Lyberth, an Inuit Eskimo from [[Nuuk]], Greenland.

A second team visited Indian Reserves and cities in Northern [[Saskatchewan]], Canada,&lt;ref name="BN594-Trail"/&gt; included Henry Bainbridge, a Navajo from [[Teec Nos Pos, Arizona]]; Ernestine Moore, a [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]]-[[Washoe people|Washoe]] from [[Reno, Nevada]]; Maynard Eakan, an Inupiaq Eskimo from [[Anchorage, Alaska]], and member of the National Spiritual Assembly of Alaska; Shirley Lindstrom, a [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] from [[Mayo, Yukon]], Canada; team captain Noni Nelson, a [[Métis people (Canada)|Metis]] from [[Enderby, British Columbia]], Canada; Peter Singyke, an [[Inupiaq]] from Anchorage, Alaska; Rita Blumenstein, an [[Aleut people|Aleut]]-[[Athabascan]]-[[Yupik Eskimo]] from [[Palmer, Alaska]]; Dennis Bainbridge, age 9, a Navajo from Teec-Nos-Pos, Arizona.

One of the teams split in two and traveled from the north to the south starting mid June and traveled among the people in Mexico, Belize, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama.&lt;ref name="BN620"/&gt; While in Panama they gathered with more than 1,000 [[Guaymi]] Bahá'ís joined by Costa Rican Guaymi, Talamanca, and [[Teribe]] representatives and they agreed on founding a Native Council for the Panamanian and Costa Rican tribes.&lt;ref name="BN620"/&gt; The Trail of Light team then continued through [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Peru]] and finally [[Ecuador]].&lt;ref name="BN620"/&gt; In Ecuador the team was presented to the audience at a conference in May 1982 dedicated to the anniversary of the death of [[Bahiyyih Khánum]]. Representatives of 24 of the 29 national assemblies in Latin America and the Caribbean, and members of 21 Indian tribes from Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, the United States and Venezuela were present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The World; Guatemala | journal = Bahá'í News |date=May 1984 | number = 638 |ISSN=0195-9212 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Third Council of North America====
In August 1982 the third North American Native Council was held gathering Hand of the Cause [[Rúhíyyih Khanum]] and four hundred forty-six Bahá'ís and their guests from 10 countries and representing 60 Indian tribes on the [[Blood Indian Reserve]] in southwestern Alberta, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Canada - Third North American Native Council | journal = Bahá'í News |date=May 1984 | number = 620 |ISSN=0195-9212 |pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this conference, Rúhíyyih Khanum traveled across Canada and into Greenland and Iceland visiting civic leaders and Bahá'í communities. She met people from [[Fountain, British Columbia|Fountain Reserve]] and [[Thunderbird Reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Canada; Rúhíyyih Khanum's historic journey | journal = Bahá'í News |date=March 1983 | number = 624 |ISSN=0195-9212 |pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the close of the tour in September the team presented an Indian ceremonial blanket to Rúhíyyih Khanum who responded by joining them in a dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = International Conferences Montreal: Charting course toward victory | journal = Bahá'í News |date=November 1982 | number = 620 |ISSN=0195-9212 |pages=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Follow-up meetings after the Trail travelers came through occurred in November in Alaska&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The world; Alaska| journal = Bahá'í News |date=April 1983 | number = 625 |ISSN=0195-9212 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and December in Honduras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The world; Many enrolled in 2 Honduras campaigns| journal = Bahá'í News |date=March 1983 | number = 624 |ISSN=0195-9212 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 a reprise of the ''Trail of Light'' was undertaken when an international team of five Bahá'ís spent 17 days in [[Guatemala]]; they were a [[Mapuche]] Indian from Chile, a Quechua from Peru, a [[Bribri]] from Costa Rica, and two Guaymis from Panama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Quito: Riding the 'high tide' of victory | journal = Bahá'í News |date=October 1982 | number = 619 |ISSN=0195-9212 |pages=3–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1984-5 continuation of the ''Trail of Light'' process brought Costa Rican indigenous Bahá'ís into [[Veracruz]] Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = 'Trail of Light' visits indigenous peoples | journal = Bahá'í News |date=April 1985 | number = 649 |ISSN=0195-9212 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the religion grew among the Guaymi, they in turn offered service in 1985-6 with the Trail of Light project included indigenous Guaymí Bahá'ís of Panama traveling with the [[Venezuela]]n indigenous &lt;!-- note ref says "Kariña" and the closest I can come in Wikipedia is the inclusion of "karina -Carib" on the Carib language page so Kariña could be a word someone uses for a Carib speaking group --&gt;[[Carib language|Carib speaking]] and [[Wayuu|Guajira]] Bahá'ís through the Venezuelan states of [[Bolívar (state)|Bolívar]], [[Amazonas (Venezuelan state)|Amazonas]] and [[Zulia]] sharing their religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Historia de la Fe Bahá'í en Venezuela |work=La Fe Bahá'í en Venezuela |publisher=National Spiritual Assembly of Venezuela |url=http://www.bci.org/venezuela/historiven.shtml |accessdate=2008-07-05 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080621164709/http://www.bci.org/venezuela/historiven.shtml| archivedate= 21 June 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bahá'í Guaymí Cultural Centre was built in the Chiriqui district (which was split in 1997 to create the Ngöbe-Buglé district) and used as a seat for the Panamanian Ministry of Education's literacy efforts in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Bahá'í |last=International Community |author-link=Bahá'í International Community |contribution=Report on the Status of Women in the Baha'i Community |contribution-url=http://statements.bahai.org/pdf/90-0613.pdf |title = Response to a questionnaire received from the United Nations Division for the Advancement of Women |date=May 1990 |place=Vienna, Austria |publisher=Bahá'í International Community |id=BIC-Document Number: 90-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 Trail of Light began its work in Colombia.&lt;ref name="teachingandprojects.com"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Alaska - A Baha'i community grows, matures | journal = Bahá'í News |date=November 1985 |number = 656 |ISSN=0195-9212 |pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the participants were two youth from the Guaymi tribe in Panama; six members from the Guajiros, the Colombo-Venezuelan tribe, and two youth from the Paez, a tribe in southern Colombia. The traveled to the Guajira region and re-affirmed the religion among the Bahá'ís there and the group performed dances which inspired the Guajiros to offer their own dance, the Chichamaya. The group was invited to the local high school where the Guaymis shared the story of the impact of the religion among their people (see [[Bahá'í Faith in Panama]]). The group was then invited to the elementary school. From Guajira the group headed to [[Valledupar]] and then on to the homeland of the [[Arhuaco]] tribe in the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]]. There the group met with the leadership, the Mamos, or elders of the community for permission to present the message they had come to give. Various of the group presented to the Mamos including the Guaymi and their interpretation of their own prophecies. An elder shared that the Arhuaco had a similar prophecy. The Trail of Light group was allowed to make their presentations and exchanges of dances and talks followed. From there the group traveled to see the [[Yukpa]] (Yuko) tribe. With the Yuko the group was able to hold a unity feast and shared dances and stayed for three days before heading home.

====1988 Council====
The 1988 North American Native Council as sponsored by the [[Spiritual Assembly|National Assembly]] of the Bahá'ís of the United States and the group met with members of the assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Indians consult at Indigenous Council| journal = Bahá'í News |date=September 1988 | number = 690 |ISSN=0195-9212 |pages=6–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the U.S. National Assembly hosted a reception for the Tribal Council chairman and Councils of North and South Dakota and also met with the Cheyenne River Tribal Council and the Looking Horse family which keeps the original sacred pipe of the Lakota. [[Hooper Dunbar]], a member of the Universal House of Justice, attended. The council opened recalling a vision -[[Ghost dance#Jack Wilson.27s vision|Jack Wilson's vision]] - that [[Sitting Bull]] attempted to call for but was killed before it could come about. See also [[Ghost Dance]] and [[Wounded Knee Massacre]].

Desert Rose began in 1988 in Tucson with the four-day Desert Rose Bahá'í School initiated by [[Hand of the Cause]] [[William Sears (Bahá'í)|William Sears]] and his wife, Marguerite, along with a core group of dedicated friends. When Mr. Sears died in 1992, Marguerite continued Desert Rose Bahá'í School, but, with the knowledge and encouragement of the Universal House of Justice, decided to expand the four-day school into a permanent institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = History and Evolution | work = Official Website of the Desert Rose Baha'i Institute | publisher = The Desert Rose Bahá'í Institute | date = | url =http://www.drbi.org/about/history-evolution | accessdate = 2009-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Against a backdrop of serious social disruption and violence across Colombia Bahá'ís turned to service to the people living in the countryside. In 1974 [[FUNDAEC]]{{refn|FUNDAEC is different from [[FUNDESCU]] though there are many similarities. FUNDAEC is the Colombian NGO based on Bahá'í consultations with Colombians starting in the 1970s and developed a number of projects like a secondary curriculum centered on skill development for living in the countryside and minimized [[urbanization]] for example. FUNDESCU is an older (from the 1950s) NGO in Panama based on Bahá'í consultations with Panamanian Indians and developed a system of schools serving largely remote areas. An agricultural project was attempted in the 1990s and was in fact based on cooperation between the Panamanian and Colombian NGOs but it failed from differences.&lt;ref name=Rhodenbaugh&gt;{{cite thesis | last = Rhodenbaugh | first = Molly Marie | title = The Ngöbe Baha'is of Panama (MA Thesis in Anthropology) | publisher = [[Texas Tech University]] |date=August 1999 |url=http://etd.lib.ttu.edu/theses/available/etd-10272008-31295016514407/unrestricted/31295016514407.pdf | pages=119–123 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815213017/http://etd.lib.ttu.edu/theses/available/etd-10272008-31295016514407/unrestricted/31295016514407.pdf |archive-date=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} was founded by group of professors at the [[University of Valle]].&lt;ref name="Club"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Baha'i-inspired educational system for the poor of the world honored by the Club of Budapest | newspaper = Bahá'í World News Service | location = Frankfurt, Germany | publisher =Bahá'í International Community | date = 22 December 2002 | url =http://news.bahai.org/story/185 | accessdate = 2010-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Gustavo Correa]], director of FUNDAEC, it was originally inspired by a quotation from [[Bahá'u'lláh]] - "Baha'u'llah talks about man as 'a mine rich in gems of inestimable value.'

The first Indian of Bolivia formally joined the religion in 1956 which soon spread widely among that subculture.&lt;ref name="Canton"&gt;{{cite journal |title = Canton Huanuni Indian Assembly Formed In Bolivia |journal = Bahá'í News |date=February 1958 |number = 323 |pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The election of the Bolivian national assembly in 1961 - representative of a community the majority of whom were of the [[Aymara ethnic group|Aymara people]]&lt;ref name="Custodians"/&gt; - were (in alphabetical order by last name): Estanislao Alverez, recording secretary, Athas Costas, Sabino Ortega (first Indian teacher), Andres Jachakovo (this first Indian adherent in Bolivia), vice-chairman, Yolanda de Lopez, secretary, Daniel Mauricio (founder of first Baha'i school), Massoud Khamsi, chairman, Alberto Saldias, treasurer, and Alberto Rocabado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title =Eight members of the first National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Bolivia|journal = Bahá'í News |date=July 1961 | number = 364 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1963 there were hundreds of local assemblies.&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt; Andres was appointed as an Auxiliary Board member in 1969 after serving on the national assembly since 1961 and often living for periods of times in different Indian communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Bolivia; Recently appointed Auxiliary Board members ... |journal = Bahá'í News |date=May 1970 |number = 470|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1960s the focus on service through [[socio-economic development]] began to work in a context of sustainable growth of the religion - many projects were developed including the 'Yachay Wasi' Bahá'í Tutorial Center which was to train the teachers for one hundred tutorial schools to be established in the country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Social/economic development; Number of projects growing rapidly; Bolivia | journal = Bahá'í News |date=March 1986 |number = 660 |page=8 |ISSN=0195-9212}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Bahá'í radio]] station with indigenous support staffing following developments in Ecuador&lt;ref name="Kurt"/&gt; - its call letters are CP-220&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = The following - courtesy of the International Bahá'í Audio-Visual Centre ... | journal = Bahá'í News |date=May 1987 |number=659 |ISSN=0195-9212 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; - and [[Nur University (Bolivia)|Nur University]].

===In Panama===

{{main|Bahá'í Faith in Panama}}
A Bahá'í Radio station on [[AM broadcasting]] from [[Boca del Monte]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=E. Escoffery |first = Carlos |title = Radiodifusión AM, Provincia de Chiriquí, República de Panamá |work=Radiodifusión en la República de Panamá |publisher = Carlos E.

In Panama's remote indigenous villages Bahá'í volunteers run ten primary schools where the government does not provide access to a school. Later a [[FUNDESCU]]{{refn|FUNDESCU is different from [[FUNDAEC]] though there are many similarities. FUNDAEC is the Colombian NGO based on Bahá'í consultations with Colombians starting in the 1970s and developed a number of projects like a secondary curriculum centered on skill development for living in the countryside and minimized[[urbanization]] for example. FUNDESCU is an older (from the 1950s) NGO in Panama based on Bahá'í consultations with Panamanian Indians and developed a system of schools serving largely remote areas. An agricultural project was attempted in the 1990s and was in fact based on cooperation between the Panamanian and Colombian NGOs but it failed from differences.&lt;ref name=Rhodenbaugh/&gt;}} stipend of $50 per month was made available for 13 teachers and the Ministry of Education added funds for a 14th. As subsistence farmers, the villagers have no money or food to offer. Instead they take turns providing firewood for an outdoor kitchen or build small wood-framed shelters with corrugated zinc panels and a narrow wooden platform for a bed. The teachers and administrators do not seek to convert the students. Some of the villagers are Bahá'ís, some are Catholics, some Evangelicals, and some follow the native [[Mama Tata]] religion. In all, about half the students are Bahá'ís (about 150). Nevertheless there is a strong moral component to the program including a weekly class on "Virtues and Values." Over the years, some training for the teachers has been provided but many have not finished the twelfth grade including some women who have faced difficulties getting even that much education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Gottlieb |first=Randie |title=In Panama's remote indigenous villages, Baha'i volunteers provide much needed educational services |newspaper=Bahá'í World News Service |date = 2003-01-03 |url=http://news.bahai.org/story/186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Gottlieb |first = Randie |title=Victorino's Story - The establishment and rise of the first indigenous academic schools in the Ngäbe-Buglé Region of Chiriqui, Panama |journal = Bahá'í Journal of the Bahá'í Community of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland |volume = 19 |issue = 06 |date= November–December 2002 | url = http://bahai-library.com/pdf/bjuk/bjuk_2002_v19_n6_nov-dec_9_Victorinos_Story.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Benchō'''|弁長||extra=June 20, 1162 &amp;ndash; March 16, 1238}}, is considered the second patriarch of the main [[Chinzei]] branch of the [[Jōdo-shū]] sect of Japanese Buddhism, after [[Hōnen]]. He is often called by another name: ''Shōkōbō Benchō'' (聖光房弁長) or just ''Shōkō''. According to biographies, he first ordained as a priest of the [[Tendai]] sect at the age of fourteen, and entered [[Enryaku-ji]] temple in 1183. He first met Hōnen in 1197. Later, after Hōnen and many of his followers were exiled in 1207, Shōkō was exiled on the island of [[Kyūshū]] and taught the practice of the [[nembutsu]] there.

Unlike other disciples of Hōnen, Shōkō favored studying the more traditional Buddhist paths along with the Pure Land path. He also criticized the interpretations by other disciples of Hōnen, particularly [[Kōsai]] and [[Shōkū]], who emphasized the [[nembutsu]] over other practices. However, unlike [[Chōsai]], his teachings still emphasized repeated recitations of the nembutsu as the primary practice in Jōdo-shū. In the spectrum of followers of Hōnen, Benchō balances faith in the [[nembutsu]] with acceptance of other practices leading to rebirth in the [[Pure Land]] of [[Amitābha|Amida]] Buddha.

After Hōnen died, Benchō attempted to counter divergences in Hōnen's teachings among other disciples by writing a treatise titled {{Nihongo|''Matsudai Nenbutsu Jushuin''|末代念仏授手印|"Handprint for the Transmission of the Nembutsu to Future Generations"}}, which contained a full account of the teachings that Benchō heard directly from Hōnen. He also wrote ''The Way of Practice for Birth by the Nembutsu'' (''nembutsu ojo shugyomon'') to counter teachings from other disciples of Hōnen, particularly [[Kōsai]] and the "single-nembutsu" movement.

Benchō died in 1238 and was succeeded by the third patriarch, Ryōchū (良忠, 1199–1287), who formally established [[Chinzei]] branch.

β-'''Carboline''' (9''H''-[[pyridine|pyrido]][3,4-''b''][[indole]]), also known as '''norharmane''', is a nitrogen containing [[heterocycle]]. It is also the prototype of a class of [[Chemical compound|compounds]] known as β-carbolines.

==Pharmacology==
β-Carboline [[alkaloid]]s are widespread in [[plants]] and [[animal]]s, and frequently act as [[benzodiazepine]] [[inverse agonist]]s. As components of the liana ''[[Banisteriopsis caapi]]'', the β-carbolines [[harmine]], [[harmaline]], and [[tetrahydroharmine]] play a pivotal role in the pharmacology of the indigenous [[psychedelic drug]] [[ayahuasca]] by preventing the breakdown of [[dimethyltryptamine]] in the gut by reversibly inhibiting [[monoamine oxidase]], thus making it psychoactive upon oral administration. Some β-carbolines, notably [[tryptoline]] and [[pinoline]], may be formed naturally in the human body. The latter is possibly implicated along with [[melatonin]] in the role of the [[pineal gland]] in regulating the [[Circadian cycle|sleep-wake cycle]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} β-carboline is a [[benzodiazepine receptor]] [[inverse agonist]] and can therefore have convulsive, [[anxiogenic]] and memory enhancing effects.&lt;ref name="pmid17334612"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Venault P, Chapouthier G | title = From the behavioral pharmacology of beta-carbolines to seizures, anxiety, and memory | journal = ScientificWorldJournal | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 204–23 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17334612 | doi = 10.1100/tsw.2007.48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[9-Methyl-β-carboline]]s appear to induce [[DNA repair#DNA damage|DNA damage]] when exposed to [[Ultraviolet|ultra-violet light]].&lt;ref name="pmid23842892"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vignoni M, Rasse-Suriani FA, Butzbach K, Erra-Balsells R, Epe B, Cabrerizo FM | title = Mechanisms of DNA damage by photoexcited 9-methyl-β-carbolines | journal = Org Biomol Chem | year = 2013 | pmid = 23842892 | doi = 10.1039/c3ob40344k | volume=11 | pages=5300–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
β-Carboline belongs to the group of [[indole alkaloids]] and consist of [[pyridine]] ring that is fused to an [[indole]] skeleton.&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Plants: Ethnopharmacology and its Applications''.  Ratsch, Christian. Park Street Press c. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The structure of β-carboline is similar to that of [[tryptamine]], with the [[ethylamine]] chain re-connected to the [[indole]] ring via an extra [[carbon]] atom, to produce a three-ringed structure. The biosynthesis of  β-carbolines is believed to follow this route from analogous tryptamines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3762/bjoc.7.164 | title = Manganese dioxide mediated one-pot synthesis of methyl 9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole-1-carboxylate: Concise synthesis of alangiobussinine | year = 2011 | last1 = Baiget | first1 = Jessica | last2 = Llona-Minguez | first2 = Sabin | last3 = Lang | first3 = Stuart | last4 = MacKay | first4 = Simon P | last5 = Suckling | first5 = Colin J | last6 = Sutcliffe | first6 = Oliver B | journal = Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry | volume = 7 | pages = 1407–11 | pmid = 22043251 | pmc = 3201054}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different levels of [[saturation (chemistry)|saturation]] are possible in the third ring, which is indicated here in the [[structural formula]]  by colouring the optionally double bonds red and blue:

[[File:Bhaktivedanta Manor crop.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|Bhaktivedanta Manor temple]]

'''Bhaktivedanta Manor''' is a [[Gaudiya Vaishnava]] temple set in the [[Hertfordshire]] countryside of [[England]], in the village of [[Aldenham]] near [[Watford]]. The Manor is owned and run by the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] (ISKCON), better known as the Hare Krishna movement. It is ISKCON's largest property in the United Kingdom, and one of the most frequently visited [[Radha Krishna]] temples in [[Europe]]. It stands in {{convert|70|acre|m2}} of landscaped grounds, consisting of lawns, [[flower garden]]s, a children's playground, an artificial lake that attracts many [[water fowl]], and a substantial [[car park]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The house is [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed Grade II]] on the [[National Heritage List for England]].&lt;ref name=NHLE&gt;{{NHLE|num=1173081|desc=Bhaktivedanta Manor|access-date=5 January 2016|mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously known as Piggott's Manor, the property was donated to the Hare Krishna movement in February 1973 by former [[The Beatles|Beatle]] [[George Harrison]], after the [[Radha Krishna Temple]] in central London had become inadequate to house the growing number of devotees. The donation included 17 acres of land, following which the estate was extended through the acquisition of neighbouring properties. Harrison had a close relationship with ISKCON's founder-[[acharya]], [[A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]],&lt;ref&gt;Carol Clerk, "George Harrison 1943–2001", ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'', February 2002, p. 51; available at [http://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/george-harrison-2 Rock's Backpages] (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, pp. 268, 306.&lt;/ref&gt; and visited him at the Manor on several occasions.

Beginning in 1981, ISKCON was engaged in a campaign to save Bhaktivedanta Manor from closure as a public temple, as the popularity of the site led to increased traffic through Aldenham. After a series of court hearings and appeals, the [[Department of the Environment (United Kingdom)|Department of the Environment]] granted permission for the building of a road bypassing the village in 1996. With the improved access, the Manor hosts up to 60,000 visitors for annual religious festivals such as [[Krishna Janmashtami|Janmashtami]].

==ISKCON ownership==
[[File:Bhaktivedanta Manor - 33.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Shrine to [[A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]], at Bhaktivedanta Manor]]
By 1972, three years after its founding, ISKCON's [[Radha Krishna Temple]] at Bury Place, in central London, was proving too small to accommodate the growing number of devotees there.&lt;ref&gt;Dwyer and Cole, pp. 31, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of the movement had much to do with former [[The Beatles|Beatle]] [[George Harrison]],&lt;ref&gt;Lavezzoli, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; who had helped establish the temple,&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, pp. 267–69, 439.&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to endorsing [[Krishna Conscious]] principles in his 1970 solo album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Tillery, pp. 88–90, 151.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first British devotees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhaktivedantamanor.co.uk/home/?page_id=9 |title=George Harrison and Hare Krishna |publisher= bhaktivedantamanor.co.uk |accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dhananjaya Das, recalls Prabhupada suggesting that he ask Harrison if he would care to help with their predicament, to which the musician replied: "I would be very much honoured."&lt;ref&gt;Dhananjaya Das, in "Bhaktivedanta Manor Memories – The Definitive History"; event occurs between 1:20 and 2:14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrison began looking for a new premises but then left the search to Dhananjaya and others, aware that property owners were immediately raising their asking price due to the involvement of a celebrity musician.&lt;ref name="Dwyer &amp; Cole p 32"&gt;Dwyer and Cole, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Dhananjaya came upon Piggott's Manor in the Hertfordshire village of Aldenham, north-west of London;&lt;ref name="Dwyer &amp; Cole p 32" /&gt; he recalls that the owner had been considering using the house and 17 acres&lt;ref name="Clayson p 306"&gt;Clayson, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt; of grounds as a [[Nursing home care|nursing home]].&lt;ref&gt;Dhananjaya Das, in "Bhaktivedanta Manor Memories – The Definitive History"; event occurs between 2:16 and 2:28.&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison purchased the property in February 1973 and donated it to ISKCON's London chapter.&lt;ref&gt;Tillery, p. 111, 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Prabhupada on a morning walk in Germany 1974.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.65|Prabhupada in Germany in 1974]]
The devotees endured financial hardship during their early years at the Manor, due to the substantial costs involved in maintaining the large property.&lt;ref name="Dwyer &amp; Cole p 32" /&gt; A habitual international traveller, Prabhupada visited Bhaktivedanta Manor in the summer of 1973&lt;ref name="Greene pp 198-99" /&gt; and was delighted with the new UK base.&lt;ref&gt;Dwyer and Cole, pp. 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt; During their meeting there in August, he told Harrison: "You have given us this shelter, and Krishna will give ''you'' shelter – at his lotus feet."&lt;ref name="Greene pp 198-99"&gt;Greene, pp. 198–99.&lt;/ref&gt; Prabhupada later referred to Harrison as ISKCON's "archangel" for this and other gifts to the movement;&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; in November 1977, while on his deathbed in the [[Krishna Balaram Mandir|Vrindavan temple]], the acharya removed a ring from his hand and instructed devotees to deliver it to Harrison.&lt;ref&gt;Tillery, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greene, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Prabhupada's final trip outside India, over August and September 1977, was a visit to the UK centres at Bury Place and Aldenham.&lt;ref&gt;Dwyer and Cole, pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; While staying at the Manor, he became too sick to undertake a planned tour of the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Goswami, p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; and instead returned to Bombay before being transported to Vrindavan.&lt;ref&gt;Dwyer and Cole, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrison said he envisaged that the Manor would be a "guide to Krishna consciousness"&lt;ref name="Gibson"&gt;Gibson, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and "A place where people could get a taste of the splendor of devotional service to the Supreme Lord".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Giuliano|first=Geoffrey|title=Dark Horse: The Life and Art of George Harrison|edition=rev.|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=New York|year=1997|isbn=0-306-80747-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coinciding with the 40th anniversary of Bhaktivedanta Manor in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/george-harrison/70554 |title=George Harrison memorial garden opens to the public |publisher=[[NME|nme.com]] |date=28 May 2013 |accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The George Harrison Memorial Garden" was officially opened to the public.

==Campaign to save the temple==
By the late 1970s, Bhaktivedanta Manor had become a popular visiting place for London's large [[Hinduism|Hindu]] population,&lt;ref&gt;Dwyer and Cole, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly since, unlike in areas of the UK such as the [[Midlands (England)|Midlands]], it was a rare example of a local temple for Krishna worship. The 1979 and 1980 [[Krishna Janmashtami|Janmashtami]] festivals attracted up to 15,000 visitors per day, resulting in increased road traffic through Aldenham and complaints to [[Hertsmere Borough Council]].&lt;ref name="HUDOC" /&gt; Having originally permitted ISKCON to use the site as a [[theological college]], in line with the educational function that the property served under St Bart's ownership,&lt;ref name="HUDOC" /&gt; Hertsmere Council moved to ban all religious festivals at Bhaktivedanta Manor in 1981.&lt;ref name="Campaign"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhaktivedantamanor.co.uk/home/?page_id=7 |title=Campaign to save the Manor |publisher= bhaktivedantamanor.co.uk |accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISKCON subsequently acquired a property near [[Worcester]] – [[Croome Court]] – which became the movement's UK headquarters temporarily, including the site of its school.&lt;ref&gt;Dwyer and Cole, pp. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt; An agreement between the council and the ISKCON devotees, made in January 1983, then allowed for six days each year where the number of people attending Bhaktivedanta Manor could exceed 1000. Financial difficulties forced the closure of the Croome Court base in July 1984, however,&lt;ref name="HUDOC"&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=666712&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 "ISKCON and 8 Others v. the United Kingdom"] (8 March 1994).

During 1985, the devotees tried to buy adjoining land to make road access to the Manor that would bypass the village.&lt;ref name="Campaign" /&gt; Meanwhile, the council received many more local complaints, leading it to issue an enforcement notice in January 1987 to have the temple closed to the public, citing a breach of the 1000-person daily limit.&lt;ref name="HUDOC" /&gt; The temple submitted an appeal to the UK's [[Department of the Environment (United Kingdom)|Department of the Environment]].&lt;ref name="Campaign" /&gt; A series of government inquiries over 1987–89 recognised the importance of Aldenham's position within the [[Letchmore Heath]] Conservation Area,&lt;ref name="HUDOC" /&gt; and in 1990 the [[Secretary of State for the Environment|Secretary of State]] announced that Bhaktivedanta Manor would have to close as a temple. Appeals to the British [[High Court of Justice|High Court]], the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] and the [[European Court for Human Rights]] – the latter heard as ''[[ISKCON and 8 Others v. United Kingdom]]''&lt;ref name="HUDOC" /&gt; – all similarly failed, and a date of 16 March 1994 was set for the closure.&lt;ref name="Campaign" /&gt; In the months leading up to the deadline, the devotees bought the neighbouring land, and submitted a development proposal to Hertsmere Council, with a view to making a road that would bring all traffic into the Manor from the [[A41 road|A41]], on the opposite (west) side of the property from the village.&lt;ref&gt;Dwyer and Cole, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; On the day of the proposed closure, a crowd estimated at 36,000 marched on the British government's offices at [[Westminster]] in protest,&lt;ref name="Mahadevan/B&amp;E Times"&gt;{{cite web|author= Mahadevan, Janaki |url=http://www.borehamwoodtimes.co.uk/film_nostalgia/history/1671280.print/ |title=Temple shines through trying times |work=[[Borehamwood and Elstree Times|Borehamwood &amp; Elstree Times]] |date=6 September 2007 |accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the council deliberated over the application for a new road.&lt;ref name="Campaign" /&gt;

The Hertsmere councillors declined the proposal, leading to further campaigning by the devotees&lt;ref name="Mahadevan/B&amp;E Times" /&gt; and, in early 1996, another appeal to the Department of the Environment. By this point, ISKCON's cause had attracted support from the [[BBC]] and members of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|national Parliament]].&lt;ref name="Campaign" /&gt; Six months after the appeal was lodged, the Department of the Environment granted permission for the proposed road,&lt;ref&gt;Dwyer and Cole, pp. 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt; with the Secretary of State concluding:

[[File:Bhaktivedanta Manor - 35.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Livestock grazing in the property's designated cow sanctuary]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Bhaktivedanta Manor] is unique in the UK because there is no comparable alternative place for teaching, worship and meditation; and the level of provision of these religious facilities is to an exceptionally high standard. Furthermore, the close association of the Hare Krishna movement's founder with the Manor makes it a special, if not unique place …&lt;ref name="Campaign" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The road was duly built, through what was now a 70-acre property, bypassing the village of Aldenham.&lt;ref&gt;Dwyer and Cole, pp. 45, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1998, visitors to the Janmashtami festival numbered 60,000 – a figure described by the local ''[[Borehamwood and Elstree Times|Borehamwood &amp; Elstree Times]]'' in 2007 as "the average number of people" attending the festival each year.&lt;ref name="Mahadevan/B&amp;E Times" /&gt; According to a 2013 [[BBC News]] report, the grounds of Bhaktivedanta Manor now include "a theological college, [[organic farm]], herb gardens, a cow sanctuary, [[primary school]] and kitchens providing meals for the homeless".&lt;ref name="BBC 2013"&gt;{{cite web|author= Taneja, Poonam |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-21938027 |title='George Harrison' Bhaktivedanta Manor Hindu temple at 40 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=27 March 2013 |accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inside the temple==
All activity at Bhaktivedanta Manor focuses around the temple room with its altar of carved wood and gilt containing three domed shrines. The first houses deity forms of [[Radha]] and [[Krishna]], named "Radha Gokulananda". The second houses [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Gaura]]-[[Nityananda|Nitai]] deities, and the third, [[Sita]], [[Rama]], his brother [[Lakshmana]] and [[Hanuman]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sita|Nepalese princess or Hindu goddess Sita's Idol placed in Bhaktidevanta mandor, London]]&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the property comprises a shop selling souvenirs and devotional paraphernalia, a bakery, a farm with working oxen, college facilities, [[ashrams]], a primary school, and a small theatre. The latter is used for performances of the dramatic arts illustrating [[bhakti]] [[yoga]] and stories about [[Krishna]]. The theatre is frequently used as a venue for [[Vaishnava]] religious festivals, Hindu family gatherings, general open days and civil weddings.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2893">'''Claude-Charles Dallet ''' (1829–1878) was a Catholic missionary who is best known for his work ''The History of the Church of Korea'' (''Histoire de l'Église de Corée'').

Charles Dallet was born in [[Langres]], France, on 18 October 1829. He joined the [[Paris Foreign Missions Society]] in 1850 and was ordained on 5 June 1852. Shortly after, he was sent to [[Mysore]], in southern India.  He was appointed as the [[Apostolic vicariate|Apostolic Vicar]] in [[Bangalore]] in 1857. In 1859, he published there, in English, a work titled ''Controversial Catechism, or short answers to the objections of Protestants against the true religion''.

He spent the years 1860 to 1863 in France, recovering from [[epilepsy]]. During this period, he supervised the casting of type fonts for the Telagu and Kanara languages, which he took with him when he returned to Bangalore in 1863, using them for some publications in vernacular languages under his editorship. In 1867, he got ill again and returned to France.

In 1870 he was sent to [[Quebec]] on a speaking tour. He stayed for a time at [[Laval University]] in Quebec. It was there that he classified manuscripts regarding the [[Catholic Church]] in Korea—largely the work of the martyred bishop [[Marie-Nicolas-Antoine Daveluy|Antoine Daveluy]]—which provided the material for his ''Histoire de l'Église de Corée'' (1874, two volumes). In 1877, Dallet went back to India, this time passing Russia, Manchuria, China and Japan. From Japan he stopped at [[Cochin China]]. While in [[Tongkin]], he died of [[dysentery]] on 25 April 1878.

Cannabis is a legal recreational and medical drug in several countries and US states and there have been several effects of the drug being legalized.

==Region==

=== Canada ===

===United States===
[[File:LA Convention Draws Businesses Cashing in Cannabis Industry.webm|thumb|right|200px|News report from [[Voice of America]] about businesses related to cannabis in the United States. Aired 23 September 2015]]A 2017 study found that the introduction of medical marijuana laws caused a reduction in violent crime in Americans states that border Mexico: "The reduction in crime is strongest for countries close to the border (less than 350km), and for crimes that relate to drug trafficking. In addition, we find that MMLs in inland states lead to a reduction in crime in the nearest border state. Our results are consistent with the theory that decriminalization of the production and distribution of marijuana leads to a reduction in violent crime in markets that are traditionally controlled by Mexican drug trafficking organisations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gavrilova|first=Evelina|last2=Kamada|first2=Takuma|last3=Zoutman|first3=Floris|title=Is Legal Pot Crippling Mexican Drug Trafficking Organizations?

Since legalization, public health and law enforcement officials in Colorado have grappled with a number of issues, serving as a model for policy problems that come with legalization. Marijuana-related hospital visits have nearly doubled between 2011, prior to legalization, and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sheriffs.org/sites/default/files/2016%20FINAL%20Legalization%20of%20Marijuana%20in%20Colorado%20The%20Impact.pdf|title=The Legalization of Marijuana in Colorado: The Impact|last=|first=|date=|work=Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Top public health administrators in Colorado have cited the increased potency of today's infused products, often referred to as "edibles", as a cause for concern.

====Oregon====
Oregon legalized Cannabis in November 2014. Effects have included an increase in cannabis-related calls to the Oregon state poison center,&lt;ref name="oregon.gov"&gt;https://public.health.oregon.gov/PreventionWellness/marijuana/Documents/oha-8509-marijuana-report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; an increase in perception among youth that Marijuana use is harmful,&lt;ref name="oregon.gov"/&gt; a decrease in arrest rates for cannabis related offenses,&lt;ref name="oregon.gov"/&gt; stores sold $250 million in cannabis products which resulted in $70  million in state tax revenue (higher than a predicted $36 million in revenue),&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ijr.com/2015/07/361976-many-effects-legalizing-marijuana-washington-state/|title=One Year Later, Here Are the Effects Legalizing Marijuana Has Had in Washington State|first=Conor|last=Swanberg|date=7 July 2015|publisher=|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 10% decrease in violent crime, and 13% drop in murder rate.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The [[constitution]] provides for [[freedom of religion]], and the government generally respected this right in practice. Government policy continued to contribute to the generally free practice of religion. There were no reports of [[societal abuses]] or [[religious discrimination|discrimination]] based on religious belief or practice.

==Religious demography==
{{main|Religion in Cape Verde}}

[[Cape Verde]] is an [[archipelago]] consisting of 10 islands, 9 of which are inhabited. It has an area of {{convert|1557|sqmi|km2}} and a population of 458,000, according to the [[National Statistics Institute]]. More than 85 percent of the population is nominally [[Roman Catholic]], according to an informal [[Opinion poll|poll]] taken by local churches. The largest [[Protestant]] denomination is the [[Church of the Nazarene]]. Other groups include the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons), the [[Assemblies of God]], the [[Universal Church of the Kingdom of God]], and various other Pentecostal and evangelical groups. There are small [[Bahá'í]] communities and a small but growing [[Muslim]] community. The number of [[atheist]]s is estimated at less than 1 percent of the population.

There is no association between religious differences and ethnic or political affiliations; however, the Catholic hierarchy is sympathetic to the Movement for Democracy (MPD) party, which ruled the country from 1991 to 2001. While many Catholics once were hostile toward the Party for the Independence of Cape Verde (PAICV), which became the governing party in 2001, some have become supporters of the PAICV due to conflict within the MPD party and dissatisfaction over the latter's performance.

There were foreign [[missionary]] groups operating in the country.

==Status of religious freedom==
===Legal and policy framework===
The constitution provides for [[freedom of religion]], and the government generally respected this right in practice. The government at all levels sought to protect this right in full and did not tolerate its abuse, either by governmental or private actors.

The constitution protects the right of individuals to choose and change their religion and to interpret their religious beliefs for themselves.

The Penal Code, which entered into force in 2004, states that violations of religious freedom are [[crime]]s subject to a penalty of between 3 months' and 3 years' imprisonment.

There is no state religion. The constitution provides for the separation of church and state and prohibits the state from imposing any religious beliefs and practices.

The Catholic Church enjoys a privileged status in national life. For example, the government provides the Catholic Church with free [[television]] [[broadcast]] time for religious services. Also, the government observes the Christian holy days of [[Ash Wednesday]], [[Good Friday]], [[Easter]], [[All Saints' Day]], and [[Christmas]] as official holidays. Furthermore, each municipality has a holiday to honor its patron saint. The government does not observe any other religious holidays.

The constitution provides for [[freedom of association]]. All associations, whether religious or secular, must register with the Ministry of Justice to be recognized as legal entities.

Registration is mandatory under the constitution and the law of associations. There are no special incentives for registering and failure to do so has not resulted in penalty or prosecution. One disadvantage of not registering is the inability of unregistered groups to apply for government or private [[loan]]s and benefits as an association.

To register, a religious group must submit to the Ministry of Justice a copy of its charter and statutes, signed by the members of the group. The constitution sets forth the criteria for all associations, including religious ones, and states that the association may not be military or armed; may not be aimed at promoting [[violence]], [[racism]], [[xenophobia]], or [[dictatorship]]; and may not be in violation of the [[penal law]]. Failure to register with the Ministry of Justice does not result in any restriction on religious belief or practice.

===Restrictions on religious freedom===
Government policy and practice contributed to the generally free practice of religion.

There were no reports of religious prisoners or [[detainee]]s in the country.

===Forced religious conversion===
There were no reports of forced religious conversion, including of minor [[U.S. citizen]]s who had been abducted or illegally removed from the United States, or of the refusal to allow such citizens to be returned to the United States.

==Societal abuses and discrimination==
There were no reports of societal abuses or [[discrimination]] based on religious belief or practice.

'''Saint Gwen Teirbron''' (French: '''Blanche'''; Latin: '''Alba Trimammis''' or '''Candida'''; possibly English: '''Wite''') was a [[Breton people|Breton]] holy woman and wife of [[Saint Fragan]] who supposedly lived in the [[5th century|5th]] or [[6th century]]. Her epithet is [[Welsh language|Welsh]] for '(of the) three breasts'.

==Veneration==
Popular devotion interpreted Gwen's unusual physical and spiritual fecundity by God's gift to her of a third breast. Her iconography followed suit. Gwen is invoked for women's fertility. She is commemorated on 3 October in the Catholic Church (although this has been transferred from Saint Candidus of Rome), and on 18 July ([[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|NS]]) by the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad in Australia.&lt;ref name="Russian"&gt;Canberra Parish of the Russian Orthodox Church (Abroad).  [http://www.stjohnthebaptist.org.au/saints/day.php?month=11&amp;day=5&amp;mode=xhtml Brief Lives of Saints], 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible identification==
She is interpreted by Dyfed Lloyd Evans as having been a [[Euhemerism|euhemerized]] [[mother goddess]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celtnet.org.uk/gods_g/gwen.html Nemeton: Gwen Teir Bron]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hajong Hinduism''' or '''Hajong folk religion''', also called '''Dyaoism''', is the form of Hinduism practiced by the [[Hajong people]] of Northeast [[India]], they are the fourth largest ethnicity in the Indian state of [[Meghalaya]].&lt;ref&gt;Hajong, B. (2002). ''The Hajongs and their struggle.'' Assam, Janata Press. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly associated with the Hajong people and represents a distinct form of Hindu worship incorporating tribal animism. 
Hajong Hinduism is the mixture of [[Hinduism]] and the [[animism|animistic]] beliefs of the Hajong people. This sect of Hinduism includes worship of gods and deities of Hindu origin, demigods and spirits, all referred to as '''Dyao'''.

==History==
The Hajong people have been practicing Hinduism since a long time. It is not known when the process of Hinduisation started. During the pre-Hindu period, among the Hajongs [[animism]] was the indigenous religion. As it was not seen to conflict with the rites of [[nature worship]], Hinduism started to blend in with animism.

==Gods==
{{main article|List of Hajong deities}}
[[File:Tradtional Hajong granary called Chang Ghor.jpg|thumb|A traditional Hajong Granary has no doors in order to prevent the goddess of wealth and fortune, Lukkhi Dyao, from running away.]]
[[File:Hajong-deity.jpg|thumb|Kâtkâ Dyao, the god of war and masculinity, the Hajong equivalent of [[Kartikeya]].]]
[[Shiva]] (Shib Dyao), [[Vishnu]] (Bisnu Dyao) and [[Durga]] (Durgâ Dyao) or [[Kali]] (Kali Dyao) are the [[God|supreme god]]s. Other Hindu deities like [[Lakshmi]] (Lukkhi Dyao), [[Sarasvati]] (Sorosuti Dyao), [[Krishna]] (Krisno Dyao), [[Ganesha]] (Gones Dyao) are worshipped by the Hajongs. Along with the Hindu deities a number of traditional  deities are worshipped by the Hajong Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;Hajong, B. (2002). ''The Hajongs and their struggle.'' Assam, Janata Press. p. 34-39.&lt;/ref&gt; Minor deities include disease causing spirits, river spirits and animal spirits. Hajongs are agrarian people, near the paddy fields animals like monkeys, elephants and foxes are offered rice and side dishes associated with each animal. The bastu group of deities also include a horse and an elephant.

==Clergy==
There are two types of priests who performs the worship of the Dyaos.

===Udhikâri===
The Hajong equivalent of the Hindu [[Brahmin]]. They are Vegetarians and perform the wedding ceremonies. But now they are largely replaced by Bengali Brahmins.

===Dyaoshi or Nungtang===
The are the [[shaman|shamans]] who perform all the worship of the village to appease the deities. A Dyaoshi is selected by Hil jaga or Barun jaga.&lt;ref&gt;Hajong, B. (2002). ''The Hajongs and their struggle.'' Assam, Janata Press. p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festivals==
There are a number of Hindu and traditional festivals observed by the Hajong people. [[Pusnâ]] is a majour [[harvest festival]]. A traditional festival is celebrated to honour the Bastu, Paabni and other group of deities. It is conducted by a ''Dyaoshi'' or ''Nungtang'', a Hajong shaman. Bastu pujâ does not involve idol worship and is celebrated in a particular location outside the village premises. Another festival is called ''chormaga'' in Mymensingh and ''chorkhila'' in India. Chorkhila is celebrated during the month of October in South-West Garohills Districts of Meghalaya. During this festival, group of young people go around from house to house in the village, or from village to village, playing music and performing folklores, sometimes stories from the [[Ramayana]].  The parties receive some rice or money in return for their performance. Since every person, young and old, comes out to watch the play, this is considered a chance to check out prospective brides and grooms.&lt;ref&gt;Hajong, B. (2002). ''The Hajongs and their struggle.'' Assam, Janata Press. p. 44-45.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hajongs also celebrate their pre monsoon harvest festival known as 'Biswâ'. Kani pujâ, Kâtkâ pujâ, are also performed.

[[File:Traditional-Hajong-altar-for-honoring-wedding-deities.jpg|thumb|Temporary altars are set up to pay homage to the deities of heaven and earth during wedding ceremonies.]]

Hajong people also practise some of their traditional religious rituals. The Hajongs believe in some evil spirits like Machang Dyao, Jarang Dyao, Bhut, Muilâ Dyao, Jugni Dyao, Daini etc. They adore and worship different gods and goddess like Kali, Durga, Lakshmi, Saraswati, Kamakhya, Manasa, Basanti and others. Kartik puja among the Hajongs are known as Kâtkâ pujâ and Manasa puja is known as Kani Dyao puja. The day of Lakshmi puja is referred to as 'Kujâi Ghor' .&lt;ref&gt;Hajong, B. (2002). ''The Hajongs and their struggle.'' Assam, Janata Press. p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; In Bastu Pujâ  tortoises and pigeons are sacrificed for Bastu.&lt;ref&gt;Hajong, B. (2002). ''The Hajongs and their struggle.'' Assam, Janata Press. p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hayley Cropper''' (also '''Harry  Patterson''' and '''Hayley Patterson''') is a [[Television in the United Kingdom|fictional character]] from the [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[soap opera]], ''[[Coronation Street]]'', played by [[Julie Hesmondhalgh]]. The character first appeared in the episode first broadcast on 26 January 1998. Hayley was the first [[transgender]] character in a British soap opera and was the first permanent transgender character in the world of serialised drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albertatrans.org/history.shtml|year=2007|title=Transgender: A History|publisher=AlbertaTrans.org|accessdate=2008-12-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026103058/http://www.albertatrans.org/history.shtml|archivedate=26 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is perhaps best known for her marriage to [[Roy Cropper]] ([[David Neilson]]).

Hesmondhalgh won numerous awards for her portrayal of Hayley, but announced her departure from the show on 11 January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a485647/coronation-street-details-of-character-departure-revealed.html|title='Coronation Street': Details of character departure revealed?|publisher=Digital Spy|author=Soaps News by Kate Goodacre|date=30 May 2013|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her final scenes were filmed on 18 November 2013 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soapsquawk.co.uk/news/julie-hesmondhalgh-films-final-scenes-.php#results|title=Julie Hesmondhalgh Films Final Scenes|publisher=Soaps Squawk|date=18 November 2013|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and aired on 22 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/sitenews/a130011/soaplands-joiners-movers-and-leavers.html|title=Soapland's joiners, movers and leavers|publisher=Digital Spy Soaps Site News|date=25 November 2013|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode, Hayley takes her own life, after living with [[terminal illness|terminal]] [[pancreatic cancer]]. Hesmondhalgh has insisted that it was not a "right to die" storyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2014/01/20/coronation-streets-julie-hesmondhalgh-hayleys-death-is-not-a-right-to-die-storyline-4270063|title=Coronation Street’s Julie Hesmondhalgh: Hayley’s death is not a ‘right to die’ storyline|publisher=Metro.co.uk|date=20 January 2014|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayley's funeral aired on 31 January 2014.

Hesmondhalgh's portrayal of Hayley, and her on-screen chemistry with fellow actor [[David Neilson]], encouraged the writers to allow the character to evolve from a brief love interest for Roy to a popular long-term character. Hayley would go on to spend 16 years on ''Coronation Street'', always seeing the good in people and nurturing [[Fiz Brown]] ([[Jennie McAlpine]]) and [[Becky McDonald]] ([[Katherine Kelly (actress)|Katherine Kelly]]) from troubled young women to kind, caring, individuals.  In her later years, Hayley formed an unlikely, yet notably close, friendship with [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]) and although it was obvious the pair were from completely different walks of life, they came to respect and care for each other.

==Storylines==

Hayley Patterson was a shy shop supervisor at Firman's Freezers. Her friend and colleague [[Alma Halliwell|Alma Baldwin]] ([[Amanda Barrie]]) introduced her to [[Roy Cropper]] ([[David Neilson]]) and they became friends — until Hayley told him that she was a pre-operative [[male-to-female transsexual]] and used to be called Harold. Roy cannot cope and initially rejects her but realizes that their friendship is more important than Hayley's secret. After affirming their mutual attraction, Hayley goes to Amsterdam for private [[sex reassignment surgery]]. When she returns to Weatherfield, she starts work at Underworld. Hayley chooses not to disclose her transgender status but her secret is revealed when Alma's husband and factory boss [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike]] discovers a Tax Office error, showing her birth name, Harold. Mike sacks her as a result and although the factory staff and Street residents initially taunt her, she gets her job back and most Street residents gradually accept her.

In 2001, Roy and Hayley decide to become foster parents. Their first child is teenager [[Fiz Brown]] ([[Jennie McAlpine]]), who returns to care after falsely claiming that Roy hit her. Fiz returns later that year and becomes good friends with Roy and Hayley. Hayley and Roy then foster a young boy, [[Wayne Hayes]] (Gary Damer), but go on the run with him, wanting to protect him from his abusive stepfather. They are arrested for kidnap and Hayley is held on remand for objecting to her bail conditions but is released when Wayne's mother makes a statement about her marriage. This prevents Roy and Hayley fostering, or working with, any more young people.

In 2003, while Hayley is away, nursing her sick aunt, scheming [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]) bets [[Bev Unwin]] ([[Susie Blake]]) that she can bed the man supposedly least likely to be unfaithful — Roy. Tracy drugs Roy at [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]] ([[Chris Gascoyne]]) and [[Shelley Unwin]]'s ([[Sally Lindsay]]) wedding reception and claims to have slept with him. Roy is desperate to keep this from Hayley but breaks down and admits everything. Upon confronting Tracy, the Croppers are stunned when Tracy tells them that she is pregnant with Roy's baby and plans to have a termination if the Croppers do not want to adopt it. Roy and Hayley see an opportunity to raise a child and pay Tracy £25,000. The Croppers' relationship becomes increasingly strained, including a suicide attempt by Roy, but they pull through. Roy gets suspicious when Tracy goes on holiday for 3 weeks and realizing how easy it would be for Tracy to disappear with the cash and the baby, Roy insists she marry him (giving him parental responsibility of the baby) or the deal is off. She agrees and they marry. After the baby is born, Tracy admits to Peter that [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street character)|Steve McDonald]] ([[Simon Gregson]]) is the father (they had a one-night stand shortly before she spent the night with Roy). The baby's true paternity is revealed at Steve's wedding to [[Karen McDonald|Karen]] ([[Suranne Jones]]), when Tracy demands baby [[Amy Barlow|Patience]] be returned to her and the Croppers, heartbroken, do so and Tracy repays the cash Roy and Hayley. Steve and Karen marry, despite Tracy's bombshell, and Karen gets her revenge by gatecrashing the christening. Patience Cropper is renamed Amy Barlow and the Croppers are her godparents.

Following the death of her aunt Monica in September 2007, Hayley discovers she has a son, [[Christian Gatley]] ([[Andrew Turner (actor)|Andrew Turner]]). She hires a private investigator to track him down and introduces herself as his aunt. Roy confronts Hayley when he sees money has withdrawn from their joint bank account and she tells Roy everything. Disapproving of lies, Roy insists Hayley tell Christian the truth about how they are related and Hayley does but Christian does not react well and storms off. When Hayley finds him later, Christian is still angry and punches her when she refuses to leave him alone. On her return to the café, she makes it clear that she blames Roy and this causes problems. They decide to go camping in a bid to mend their issues. Following this, in October 2007, Hayley leaves the Street to go on volunteer work in [[Mozambique]] for a year.

Hayley returns in November 2008; it is clear that she is not entirely happy, appearing evasive and she tells Roy that she wants to return to her charity work, as she has fallen for Olaf, the project team leader. When catching up with Tilly, another volunteer, she learns Olaf is not the man she thought he was and decides to stay with Roy. She decides not to return to ''Underworld'' and wants to become a social worker but her police record (for the abduction of Wayne in 2001), rules her ineligible to work with children. She works in the café and then becomes supervisor at the factory in 2009.

In May 2010, Hayley and Roy argue when she suggests that they have a lavish wedding, now that [[gender recognition act|the law has changed]] and their union can now be officially recognized. Roy agrees but he is more concerned with inheritance law, upsetting Hayley, so she moves in with friend [[Anna Windass]] ([[Debbie Rush]]). On 1 June 2010, [[List of Coronation Street characters (2010)#Robbie Sloan|Robbie Sloan]] ([[James Fleet]]) tricks Hayley to go to the factory, telling her that [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]) has had an accident, when in reality Robbie has tied Carla to a chair and duct taped her mouth shut. Once there, Hayley sees Carla bound and gagged but Robbie pulls out a gun on her before she can escape, and ties her to a chair too. Killer [[Tony Gordon]] ([[Gray O'Brien]]) arrives, takes the gag off Carla's mouth and threatens them, revealing that Hayley is there as revenge against Roy, who convinced Tony to confess his crimes to the police, and says he will kill her and Carla. After [[Maria Connor]] ([[Samia Ghadie]]) accidentally interrupts and raises the alarm, Roy rushes to ''Underworld'' but can not help her, while Carla pleads with Tony to let Hayley go – Tony eventually relents and throws Hayley out. She is taken care of by paramedics and she and Roy tell one another they love each other before watching the factory blow up, after Tony sets fire to the building, killing himself but Carla manages to untie herself and escapes.

Later that week, Roy proposes to Hayley and she accepts. [[Mary Taylor (Coronation Street)|Mary Taylor]] ([[Patti Clare]]) intervenes in the wedding preparations and after weeks of muscling in, Hayley and Roy tell her they do not want her to be a part of the wedding, despite Hayley wearing her vintage wedding dress. On 30 August 2010, the train carriage that Hayley and bridesmaids Fiz and [[Becky McDonald|Becky]] ([[Katherine Kelly (actress)|Katherine Kelly]]) decouples from the steam train that is transporting the groom and wedding guests to the venue, due to Mary's meddling. However, they do get to the venue on time and Hayley marries Roy. In June 2011, Roy's mother [[Sylvia Goodwin]] ([[Stephanie Cole]]) – who moved in with the Croppers' earlier in the year – is suspicious when, after expressing a longing for grandchildren, finds out Hayley cannot have children. After rummaging through her things, she finds a prescription for some hormone tablets and assumes Hayley is menopausal until Tracy tells her that Hayley used to be a man. Sylvia is initially outraged but, as of July 2011, appears to be coming round and accepts Hayley for who she is.

Hayley is heartbroken when Becky decides to leave Weatherfield in January 2012 but gets a call a few months later, telling her that she is engaged to her new boyfriend. Later in the year, Roy and Hayley visit [[Palm Springs, California]] to visit Sylvia and her companion [[Milton Fanshaw]] ([[Robert Vaughn]]). Roy returns without Hayley, who is caring for Sylvia as she isn't well. Hayley returns later that year and supports Roy when they discover that his father died in May 2013. Strange happenings begin occurring in the café and Roy thinks [[Beth Tinker]] ([[Lisa George]]) and her family are responsible. [[Deirdre Barlow]] ([[Anne Kirkbride]]) finds Roy sleepwalking on the Red Rec and returns him to Hayley and Sylvia. They watch the CCTV footage and it proves that Roy is behind all of the rearranged furniture. Hayley decides that Roy should see a doctor and tells him she will have the same tests done, which Roy finds comfort in. Hayley is called back to the Medical Centre the following week and the doctor tells Hayley that she has abnormal liver function and needs an ultrasound scan for further investigation. Hayley confides in Sylvia on the day of her scan but swears her to secrecy. The doctor tells Hayley that there is a blockage in her [[bile duct]] and Hayley tells Sylvia that she may have cancer and breaks down in her arms. The following week, Carla insists on going with Hayley for a CT scan where Hayley is diagnosed with stage-two [[pancreatic cancer]]. She is told she needs an operation and chemotherapy to get rid of the cancer. Later, Hayley breaks down at work and Carla comforts her. Hayley realizes that she has to tell Roy so goes home and tells Roy and Sylvia. When Sylvia leaves Roy and Hayley alone, Roy holds Hayley's hand and starts pestering Hayley to drink herbal tea, so she confides in Carla again. Hayley goes for the operation to unblock her bile duct, accompanied by Roy. Hayley does well and is invited to [[Audrey Roberts]]' ([[Sue Nicholls]]) birthday party at the Bistro. Hayley and Sylvia go but is devastated when Roy tells everyone that she has pancreatic cancer. Upset, Hayley runs home and is followed by Sylvia. Later, Roy tells her that he wishes he could halve her pain and Hayley tells him that she could die and the pair embrace passionately. When [[Leanne Battersby]] ([[Jane Danson]]) and her half-sister [[Eva Price]] ([[Catherine Tyldesley]]), argue at the factory, Leanne pushes Eva into Hayley, so Carla throws Leanne out. Hayley gets fed up with people being sympathetic so she and Roy go on holiday before her operation to remove her tumour. Carla gives Hayley have the time off and Mary lends them her motor home. Hayley and Roy return a couple of weeks later and learn that Sylvia has gone to live with her sister, Roy's aunt Jean.

Roy organizes a romantic dinner for their third wedding anniversary but Hayley is upset as she completely forgot. Roy then assures Hayley that he is not angry, and she confides in Carla before going to the hospital, preparing for her operation. Roy and Hayley are told that the operation – if successful – should last six hours. Hayley goes down to theatre at 13:05 and gives Roy her wedding ring to look after. Roy is devastated when the consultant tells Roy and Hayley that her cancer is terminal. He says she could live up to about six months to a year. Devastated but philosophical, Hayley begins to make a [[wikt:Special:Search/bucket list|bucket list]] of everything that she wants to do before she dies, one of which is teaching Roy how to drive. Hayley has a nightmare about being "Harold" again, making her regret the way things ended with her son, Christian. She decides to tell Fiz about Christian, confusing Roy but he comes round to the idea of Hayley contacting Christian, so she leaves a message on his mobile. While waiting for him to call back, she focuses on throwing a birthday party for Roy in The Rovers. She goes with Roy to his driving lesson, which was a disaster. Hayley gets a message from Christian, wanting to meet in a café in Bury. Roy goes with Hayley but Christian sends her a text, saying that he cannot go through with it. Roy and Hayley take Fiz's daughter, [[Hope Stape|Hope]], and [[Tyrone Dobbs]]' ([[Alan Halsall]]) baby girl [[List of Coronation Street characters (2012)#Ruby Dobbs|Ruby]] to the park, Christian arrives and asks Anna where Hayley is. He decides to call her but she left her phone behind. Christian decides to wait and they talk but Hayley decides to take Roy and Christian to The Rovers, where Christian reveals that he is married and has two children, Sam and Maisie. Hayley says she would love to meet them but Christian wants to wait until they are 16 years of age, upsetting Hayley. Christian repeatedly makes inappropriate remarks unintentionally so Roy shouts at him, before taking Hayley home. Hayley insists that they attend a cancer support group, where they meet [[List of Coronation Street characters (2013)#Jane Rayner|Jane Rayner]] ([[Heather Bleasdale]]) and her husband [[List of Coronation Street characters (2013)#Jeff Rayner|Jeff]] ([[Jim Millea]]). Hayley is inspired by Jane's strength and confidence, despite dying from pancreatic cancer, but Roy tells Hayley that he found her highly inappropriate and inconsiderate. Hayley is delighted to learn that Roy has booked a day off so they can go to Blackpool. They have a wonderful time but their joy is cut short when they are told that Jane has been rushed to a hospice.

The couple visit, and Hayley is shocked to see how dazed Jane is after taking morphine. Hayley and Roy then sit down as talk about Hayley's final days, where she tells Roy that she intends to end her own life when the cancer spreads. This causes an argument and Hayley moves in with Fiz and Tyrone. The following day, Hayley collapses and Fiz calls an ambulance to take Hayley to hospital. Roy and Fiz go too. At the hospital, the consultant explains that Hayley has an infection and needs to stay overnight. While Hayley is recovering, Roy accidentally tells Anna about her suicide wish. When she comes home, she is stunned to find Roy, [[Owen Armstrong]] ([[Ian Puleston-Davies]]) and [[Gary Windass]] ([[Mikey North]]) re-decorating their bedroom. Hayley secretly does not like the new wallpaper but keeps quiet so she does not upset Roy. Hayley insists on visiting Jane in the hospice and Jeff reveals that Jane has died. Hayley is devastated and furious with Roy. The pair argue again about the way Hayley wants to die. A few days later, Roy and Hayley attend Jane's funeral and meet her young sons, Zac and Henry. Hayley tries to comfort Henry as he is not coping. After the funeral, Roy tells Hayley that he thinks he can accept her suicide plot. Hayley is delighted but Roy tells Anna that he lied and feels he has betrayed her. Roy decides not to tell Hayley his true feelings and they listen to music together after a stressful day. Hayley later breaks down in Roy's arms, saying that she does not want to die and does not want to leave him. Hayley is delighted when asked by Carla to make her wedding dress. The dress is a success and Roy and Hayley attend Carla and Peter's wedding. While there, Christian returns to the street and winds Fiz up about Hayley so she tells him that Hayley has cancer in an angry outburst. On getting home, Hayley is stunned to see Christian and tells him that she is too tired but will see him another time. The following day, Christian visits again and is stunned when Christian says she can see the children. Hayley is thrilled but Christian demands Hayley give him money in return as he is in a lot of debt. Christian brings Sam and Maisie to the café and Maisie is intrigued by Roy's train collection, while Hayley and Christian talk upstairs. Hayley is shocked when Christian turns violent and starts pushing her for the money. She subsequently writes him a cheque. Maisie, however, tells her that she hopes she gets better soon and that she would love to come again. Fiz takes Hayley and Roy to The Rovers and Hayley tells them that she gave Christian the money. In December, Roy and Hayley go to a hospital appointment where she tells the nurse that her pain is getting worse and she is prescribed with stronger painkillers.

Hayley and Roy enjoy their last Christmas together. They buy each other gifts and want to be alone, but the day is interrupted by visits from friends and neighbours. Hayley enjoys their company, but after Fiz and Tyrone arrive with their young children, Hayley finds herself falling asleep. After a nap, Hayley is determined to go to The Rovers for a Christmas drink, but Roy wants her to take it easy. Later that week, Roy and Hayley go to a hospital appointment following her scan and learn that the cancer is a lot more aggressive than anticipated, meaning Hayley only has weeks left to live. Hayley takes her frustration out on the Christmas tree, wrecking Hope's decoration. The following day, Hayley tells Roy to let a few people know that she only has weeks left but does not want visitors. Roy breaks the news to Anna, Fiz, Tyrone, Peter, Carla, [[Rita Sullivan|Rita Tanner]] ([[Barbara Knox]]) and [[Dennis Tanner]] ([[Philip Lowrie]]). Carla is determined to visit Hayley and she is glad that Carla came. She confides in her, telling her that she is frightened of dying. When Carla returns home, she breaks down after seeing Hayley in such a state. In her final week, Tyrone takes Hayley to the salon for a makeover although Roy wanted her to stay at home and rest. On 20 January 2014, she tells Roy she wants to die that day and whilst Roy is in The Kabin, Hayley irons his best shirt for her funeral. [[Norris Cole (Coronation Street)|Norris Cole]] ([[Malcolm Hebden]]) notices that Roy is even more unhappy than usual, and asks if he is alright, but he claims to be fine. Roy arrives back at the café and is confronted by [[List of Coronation Street characters#Gloria Price|Gloria Price]] ([[Sue Johnston]]) with "customer feedback". Hayley begins to write letters for Tyrone and Fiz's children, but stops when she realizes Hope and Ruby will not remember her, as they are too young. Roy tries one last time to stop Hayley but she is adamant. Roy makes sure that she is comfortable and selects a piece of music that they both like. Hayley tells Roy that he must not touch the glass containing the lethal cocktail. Prepared to drink the cocktail, Hayley is interrupted by Tyrone who is looking for Ruby's toy. Roy plays "[[The Lark Ascending]]" by [[Vaughan Williams]], and sits on the bed with Hayley. After one last moment together, she drinks the cocktail. Worried something is not right, Anna closes the café and sits downstairs and Carla knocks on the door, demanding to see Hayley. Anna lets her in and tries to stop Carla knocking on the flat door, but she does. There is no answer, so Anna eventually unlocks the door with her spare key and they enter the flat together. Calling out, Anna and Carla go to the bedroom and, to their shock, find a deceased Hayley on the bed, with Roy's arm around her. Hayley is later cremated following a humanist funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2542983/Corrie-assisted-suicide-never-Critics-accuse-soap-stoking-fake-controversy-husband-Roy-did-not-help-character-end-life.html|title=Coronation Street and the assisted suicide that never was: Critics accuse soap of stoking fake controversy after cancer victim Hayley ends her life WITHOUT any help from Roy|date=20 January 2014|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character creation==

===Casting===
Initially, it was intended that Hayley would only appear for two months, it was thought that this would help increase ratings as well as show a new side to  [[Roy Cropper]] ([[David Neilson]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pfc.org.uk/node/23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906112226/http://www.pfc.org.uk/node/23 |archivedate=2010-09-06 | title=Coronation Street: The Advisor's Tale|publisher=Press For Change |accessdate=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actor Julie Hesmondhalgh first came to the attention of the casting director while dressed in drag in a production of 'Much Ado About Nothing'. Hesmondhalgh only knew she was auditioning to play a "fun" character, so arrived "all [[Bet Lynch]], in my leopard skin and red lippy". When she learned Hayley would be transgender, she was nervous, but "then it dawned on me that this was actually my ’dream job’ and I desperately wanted it." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pfc.org.uk/node/26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517133939/http://www.pfc.org.uk/node/26 |archivedate=2009-05-17 |title=When Julie Met Hayley: Interview with Julie Hesmondhalgh |publisher=Press For Change |date= |accessdate=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.transgenderzone.com/?page_id=2487 When Julie Met Hayley: The Original Interview with Julie Hesmondhalgh with Beaumont Magazine Columnist Samantha Johnson]. Transgender Zone 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The character of Hayley Cropper is around four years older than Hesmondhalgh.

===Personality and identity===
What's on TV describes the character as quiet, and kind-hearted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/soaps/coronation_street/whos_who/hayley_cropper Who's Who – Hayley Cropper] What's on TV, Retrieved 2008-12-16&lt;/ref&gt; For a short period of time, after the actor took a one-year break from the show, the producers decided to change her ways.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myparkmag.co.uk/articles/hayley-croppers-corrie-return.html Hayley Cropper's Corrie Return]. My Park Magazine (27 August 2008) Retrieved on 2008-12-16. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013010319/http://www.myparkmag.co.uk/articles/hayley-croppers-corrie-return.html |date=13 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief period of resettlement, she resumed her more familiar temperament of being generally supportive and friendly to the other characters.

==Character development==

===Relationships===
Hayley's only romantic relationship was with Roy Cropper. The characters were first friends and they started a relationship, until Hayley revealed her past history. Roy initially rejected her, but missed their friendship and three months later, followed her to Amsterdam where she was living on a houseboat, recuperating from her surgery. He persuaded her that they should work on their relationship, and as a result, she returned to Weatherfield where she became a machinist in [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]]'s ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]) lingerie factory, ''Underworld''.

Roy later proposed to Hayley at a fancy-dress disco on [[St. Valentine's Day]] 1999. At that time, they could not legally marry, since Hayley was still seen as a male in the eyes of the law. Eventually, they found a female vicar who would help them, and they were united in a blessing ceremony held in ''Roy's Rolls'' on 23 April 1999. As a wedding present to Roy, Hayley officially changed her name by [[deed poll]] to Hayley Anne Cropper.

Since the passing of the [[Gender Recognition Act 2004]] in [[UK law]], it has been possible for transgender people to change their birth certificates and marry legally. In 2010, following a discussion of the ramifications of their not being legally married, Roy and Hayley decided to make it official. It was revealed that Hayley had applied for, and received, her new birth certificate, and so, after some disagreements about the cost and motives for marriage, the plans were made for the wedding. The couple finally married on 30 August 2010 at a stately home in Cheshire, and almost everyone but the bride arrived by steam train.

Their relationship was tested by various storylines including [[Tracy Barlow]]'s ([[Kate Ford]]) deceit, Hayley's secret son and Hayley's absence from the street. Briefly, upon her return, there was a difficult situation where she had developed a crush on one of her co-workers in Africa (further reading below). They eventually worked out their differences.

===Pancreatic cancer and suicide===
On 11 January 2013, it was announced that Hesmondhalgh would leave ''Coronation Street'' at the end of her contract.&lt;ref name="Goodbye"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/coronationstreet/news/julie-hesmondhalgh-to-leave/|title=Goodbye Hayley|publisher=[[itv.com]]|date= 11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actress recorded her final scenes on 18 November 2013, being screened on 20 January 2014, and the producers came up with a dramatic exit storyline for her character.&lt;ref name="Goodbye"/&gt; Hesmondhalgh revealed that she wanted to pursue new projects, saying "I've had the most wonderful and happy time in the life changing 15/16 years I've been in Corrie, and I owe so much to the show and the special team that make it happen. The decision to hang up Hayley's red anorak was a tough one, but doing the play at the Royal Exchange last year made me realise that there's life in the old dog yet (!) and that there are other things I want to try."&lt;ref name="Goodbye"/&gt; Hayley's exit storyline saw her diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer. On 20 January 2014, Hayley died in Roy's arms after drinking a lethal cocktail. The episode attracted 9.7 million viewers - the show's highest figure in almost a year.

==Reception==

For her portrayal of Hayley, Hesmondhalgh was nominated in the category of "Most Popular Actress" at the 1999 [[National Television Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/486003.stm |title=Entertainment &amp;#124; TV stars prepare for battle |publisher=BBC News |date=1999-10-26 |accessdate=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance of a transgender woman in a mainstream soap opera attracted initial opposition from some members of the public, as expressed in calls to the Granada duty office, and letters written to magazines and newspapers. A minority of people expressed their concern at having such "bizarreness" brought into their homes on a prime-time show. Transgender groups were also largely unhappy with the storyline, and found Hayley's original character traits, as written, cliched and ill-informed. [[Press for Change]], the transgender campaign and information group, were particularly concerned with the direction of the storyline, but after the first two months a trans advisor connected to Press for Change, [[Annie Wallace]],  was regularly consulted for eighteen months by scriptwriters and the actor, and trans groups appeared happier with the stories and scripts that resulted from this liaison. In an interview with Hesmondhalgh in August 2015, it was revealed that in tribute to Wallace, the writers gave Hayley's middle name as Anne, and gave her the same birthday, as well as a mutual love for rock music, especially [[Queen (band)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Real-life Hayley Cropper speaks publicly for the first time|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/hayley-cropper-inspiration-annie-wallace-9928638|website=Manchester Evening News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace is now an actress in her own right, and appears as the character [[Sally St. Claire]] in the [[Channel 4]] soap opera, ''[[Hollyoaks]]''.

Transgender campaigners were initially upset that a [[cissexual|cisgender]] woman had been chosen for the part but later praised Hesmondhalgh's dedication and sensitivity. Hayley was, for many viewers, the first transgender woman whose story they had seen unfold on TV. Hesmondhalgh has become an outspoken activist for trans rights, including becoming the first Friend of campaign group [[Trans Media Watch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transmediawatch.org/supporters.html|year=2011|title=Trans Media Watch – Supporters|publisher=Trans Media Watch|accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as Hayley, she has heralded a new level of acceptance among people across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/article/42317-transgender-portrayals-in-film|date=16 April 2006|title=Transgender portrayals in film|publisher=The Skinny|accessdate=2008-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official LGBT History Month website includes Hayley as one of the important famous LGBT people in their history, even though she is a fictional character.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lgbthistorymonth.org.uk/history/hayleycropper.htm Biographies of famous LGBT people] lgbthistorymonth.org.uk, (October 2005) Retrieved on 2008-12-16&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 January 2014, Hesmondhalgh won "Best Serial Drama Performance" at the [[National Television Awards]]. Also in 2014, Hesmondhalgh was nominated for the "Best Actress" award at [[The British Soap Awards#2014 winners|The British Soap Awards]]. As well as being nominated for the "Best Actress" award, Hesmondhalgh's final appearance, entitled "Hayley's Death", was nominated for the "Best Single Episode" award, as well. Hesmondhalgh won both of these awards. Hesmondhalgh also won "Best On-screen partnership" and "Best Storyline" - both alongside David Neilson - at the ceremony.

===Political impact===
''Coronation Street''{{'s}} handling of transgender issues, the uncertainty of whether her partner would accept her gender identity and the inability of transgender people to adopt children or marry, has been praised by transgender groups. An [[Early Day Motion]] was also tabled in Parliament by [[Lynne Jones]], MP, praising the story team and researchers, and Julie Hesmondhalgh for her portrayal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/197239.stm |title=UK Politics &amp;#124; MP praises 'The Street' |publisher=BBC News |date=1998-10-20 |accessdate=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the screening of the "wedding" in 1999, the Labour Government announced that a Parliamentary Working Group was being created to assess how the United Kingdom could grant trans people the legal rights for which they had fought for decades. The result of this was the tabling, in 2004, of the [[Gender Recognition Act 2004|Gender Recognition Act]], granting trans people full legal status in their acquired sex. It has been said that the character of Hayley deserves partial credit for bringing the issues faced by trans people to public attention in a sympathetic manner, rather than the sensationalist coverage that had previously existed{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}. It is also alleged that the resultant public support for this fictional character went in favour of the Bill.

{{Hinduism}}
{{main article|Deva (Hinduism)|Devi}}
Deities in Hinduism are referred to as [[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]] (masculine) and [[Devi]] (feminine).&lt;ref name=monierdevi&gt;Monier Monier-Williams, A Sanskrit-English Dictionary" Etymologically and Philologically Arranged to cognate Indo-European Languages, Motilal Banarsidass, page 496&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Stratton Hawley and Donna Marie Wulff (1998), Devi: Goddesses of India, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814912}}, page 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William K Mahony (1997), The Artful Universe: An Introduction to the Vedic Religious Imagination, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791435809}}, page 18&lt;/ref&gt; The root of these terms mean "heavenly, divine, anything of excellence".&lt;ref name=monier&gt;Monier Monier-Williams, A Sanskrit-English Dictionary" Etymologically and Philologically Arranged to cognate Indo-European Languages, Motilal Banarsidass, page 492&lt;/ref&gt; According to Douglas Harper, the etymological roots of ''Deva'' mean "a shining one," from *div- "to shine," and it is a cognate with Greek dios "divine" and [[Zeus]], and Latin deus (Old Latin deivos).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=deva&amp;searchmode=none Deva] Etymology Dictionary, Douglas Harper (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the earliest Vedic literature, all [[supernatural being]]s are called [[Asura]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Wash Edward Hale (1999), Ásura in Early Vedic Religion, Motilal Barnarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120800618}}, pages 5-11, 22, 99-102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monier Monier-Williams, A Sanskrit-English Dictionary" Etymologically and Philologically Arranged to cognate Indo-European Languages, Motilal Banarsidass, page 121&lt;/ref&gt; By the late Vedic period (~500 BC), benevolent supernatural beings are referred to as ''Deva-Asuras''. In post-Vedic texts, such as the [[Puranas]] and the [[Itihasas]] of Hinduism, the Devas represent the good, and the Asuras the bad.&lt;ref name=nickgier/&gt;&lt;ref name=fowlergita/&gt; In some medieval Indian literature, ''Devas'' are also referred to as '''Suras''' and contrasted with their equally powerful, but malevolent [[half-brother]]s referred to as the Asuras.&lt;ref name=ang&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/40167/asura/40167rellinks/Related-Links Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindu deities are part of Indian mythology, both Devas and Devis feature in one of many cosmological theories in [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;Don Handelman (2013), One God, Two Goddesses, Three Studies of South Indian Cosmology, Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004256156}}, pages 23-29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Doniger (1988), Textual Sources for the Study of Hinduism, Manchester University Press, {{ISBN|978-0719018664}}, page 67&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characteristics of Vedic era deities===
In Vedic literature, Devas and Devis represent the forces of nature and some represent moral values (such as the [[Aditya]]s, [[Varuna]], and [[Mitra]]), each symbolizing the epitome of a specialized knowledge, creative energy, exalted and magical powers (''Siddhis'').&lt;ref&gt;George Williams (2008), A Handbook of Hindu Mythology, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195332612}}, pages 24-33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=binagupta&gt;Bina Gupta (2011), An Introduction to Indian Philosophy, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415800037}}, pages 21-25&lt;/ref&gt;

The most referred to Devas in the [[Rig Veda]] are [[Indra]], [[Agni]] (fire) and [[Soma (deity)|Soma]], with "fire deity" called the friend of all humanity, it and Soma being the two celebrated in a [[yajna]] fire ritual that marks major Hindu ceremonies. [[Savitr]], [[Vishnu]], [[Rudra]] (later given the exclusive epithet of [[Shiva]]), and [[Prajapati]] (later [[Brahma]]) are gods and hence Devas.&lt;ref name=hajime26&gt;Hajime Nakamura (1998), A Comparative History of Ideas, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120810044}}, pages 26-33&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vedas]] describes a number of significant Devis such as [[Ushas]] (dawn), [[Prithvi]] (earth), [[Aditi]] (cosmic moral order), [[Saraswati]] (river, knowledge), [[Vāc]] (sound), [[Nirṛti]] (destruction), [[Ratri]] (night), [[Aranyani]] (forest), and bounty goddesses such as Dinsana, Raka, Puramdhi, Parendi, Bharati, Mahi among others are mentioned in the ''[[Rigveda]]''.&lt;ref name=kinsley717&gt;David Kinsley (2005), Hindu Goddesses: Vision of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-8120803947}}, pages 6-17, 55-64&lt;/ref&gt; Sri, also called Lakshmi, appears in late Vedic texts dated to be pre-Buddhist, but verses dedicated to her do not suggest that her characteristics were fully developed in the Vedic era.&lt;ref name=kinsley18&gt;David Kinsley (2005), Hindu Goddesses: Vision of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-8120803947}}, pages 18, 19&lt;/ref&gt; All gods and goddesses are distinguished in the Vedic times, but in the post-Vedic texts (~500 BC to 200 AD), and particularly in the early medieval era literature, they are ultimately seen as aspects or manifestations of one [[Brahman]], the Supreme power.&lt;ref name=kinsley18/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher John Fuller (2004), The Camphor Flame: Popular Hinduism and Society in India, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691120485}}, page 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Ananda Coomaraswamy states that Devas and Asuras in the Vedic lore are similar to [[Twelve Olympians|Angels-Theoi-Gods]] and [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] of Greek mythology, both are powerful but have different orientations and inclinations, the Devas representing the powers of Light and the Asuras representing the powers of Darkness in Hindu mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Wash Edward Hale (1999), Ásura in Early Vedic Religion, Motilal Barnarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120800618}}, page 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ananda Coomaraswamy (1935), Angel and Titan: An Essay in Vedic Ontology, Journal of the American Oriental Society, volume 55, pages 373-374&lt;/ref&gt; According to Coomaraswamy's interpretation of Devas and Asuras, both these natures exist in each human being, the tyrant and the angel is within each being, the best and the worst within each person struggles before choices and one's own nature, and the Hindu formulation of Devas and Asuras is an eternal dance between these within each person.&lt;ref&gt;Ananda Coomaraswamy (1935), Angel and Titan: An Essay in Vedic Ontology, Journal of the American Oriental Society, volume 55, pages 373-418&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gier&gt;Nicholas Gier (1995), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1399510 Hindu Titanism], Philosophy East and West, Volume 45, Number 1, pages 76, see also 73-96&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|
The Devas and Asuras, Angels and Titans, powers of Light and powers of Darkness in Rigveda, although distinct and opposite in operation, are in essence consubstantial, their distinction being a matter not of essence but of orientation, revolution or transformation. In this case, the Titan is potentially an Angel, the Angel still by nature a Titan; the Darkness in ''actu'' is Light, the Light in ''potentia'' Darkness; whence the designations Asura and Deva may be applied to one and the same Person according to the mode of operation, as in Rigveda 1.163.3, "Trita art thou (Agni) by interior operation".

===Characteristics of medieval era deities===
In the [[Puranas]] and the [[Itihasas]] with the embedded Bhagavad Gita, the Devas represent the good, and the Asuras the bad.&lt;ref name="nickgier"/&gt;&lt;ref name=fowlergita/&gt; According to the [[Bhagavad Gita]] (16.6-16.7), all beings in the universe have both the divine qualities (''daivi sampad'') and the demonic qualities (''asuri sampad'') within each.&lt;ref name=fowlergita/&gt;&lt;ref name=chrischapple/&gt; The sixteenth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita states that pure god-like saints are rare and pure demon-like evil are rare among human beings, and the bulk of humanity is multi-charactered with a few or many faults.&lt;ref name=fowlergita/&gt; According to Jeaneane Fowler, the Gita states that desires, aversions, greed, needs, emotions in various forms "are facets of ordinary lives", and it is only when they turn to lust, hate, cravings, arrogance, conceit, anger, harshness, hypocrisy, violence, cruelty and such negativity- and destruction-inclined that natural human inclinations metamorphose into something demonic (Asura).&lt;ref name="fowlergita"/&gt;&lt;ref name=chrischapple&gt;Christopher K Chapple (2010), The Bhagavad Gita: Twenty-fifth–Anniversary Edition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-1438428420}}, pages 610-629&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seal Surin.png|thumb|[[Indra]] is a Vedic era deity, found in south and southeast Asia. Above Indra is part of the seal of a [[Thailand]] state.]]

===Symbolism===
Edelmann states that gods and anti-gods of Hinduism are symbolism for spiritual concepts. For example, god Indra (a Deva) and the antigod Virocana (an Asura) question a sage for insights into the knowledge of the self.&lt;ref name=edelmann14/&gt; Virocana leaves with the first given answer, believing now he can use the knowledge as a weapon. In contrast, Indra keeps pressing the sage, churning the ideas, and learning about means to inner happiness and power. Edelmann suggests that the Deva-Asura dichotomies in Hindu mythology may be seen as "narrative depictions of tendencies within our selves".&lt;ref name=edelmann14&gt;Jonathan Edelmann (2013), Hindu Theology as Churning the Latent, Journal of the American Academy of Religion, Volume 81, Issue 2, pages 439-441&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu deities in Vedic era, states Mahoney, are those artists with "powerfully inward transformative, effective and creative mental powers".&lt;ref&gt;William K Mahony (1997), The Artful Universe: An Introduction to the Vedic Religious Imagination, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791435809}}, pages 17, 27, 32&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hindu mythology, everyone starts as an Asura, born of the same father. "Asuras who remain Asura" share the character of powerful beings craving for more power, more wealth, ego, anger, unprincipled nature, force and violence.&lt;ref name=gierasurach/&gt;&lt;ref name=stellaray/&gt; The "Asuras who become Devas" in contrast are driven by an inner voice, seek understanding and meaning, prefer moderation, principled behavior, aligned with ''[[Ṛta]]'' and ''[[Dharma]]'', knowledge and harmony.&lt;ref name=gierasurach&gt;Nicholas Gier (1995), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1399510 Hindu Titanism], Philosophy East and West, Volume 45, Number 1, pages 76-80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stellaray&gt;Stella Kramrisch and Raymond Burnier (1986), The Hindu Temple, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120802230}}, pages 75-78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William K Mahony (1997), The Artful Universe: An Introduction to the Vedic Religious Imagination, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791435809}}, pages 50, 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;

The god (Deva) and antigod (Asura), states Edelmann, are also symbolically the contradictory forces that motivate each individual and people, and thus Deva-Asura dichotomy is a spiritual concept rather than mere genealogical category or species of being.&lt;ref name=edelmann13/&gt; In the Bhāgavata Purana, saints and gods are born in families of Asuras, such as [[Mahabali]] and [[Prahlada]], conveying the symbolism that motivations, beliefs and actions rather than one's birth and family circumstances define whether one is Deva-like or Asura-like.&lt;ref name=edelmann13&gt;Jonathan Edelmann (2013), Hindu Theology as Churning the Latent, Journal of the American Academy of Religion, Volume 81, Issue 2, pages 440-442&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ishvara==
{{main article|Ishvara}}
[[File:Surya Majapahit Diagram.svg|thumb|Ishvara is, along with Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma, one of the 17 deities commonly found in Indonesian [[Surya Majapahit]] Hindu arts and records. However, Ishvara represents different concept in various Hindu philosophies.]]
Another Hindu term that is sometimes translated as deity is [[Ishvara]], or alternatively various deities are described, state Sorajjakool et al., as "the personifications of various aspects of one and the same Ishvara".&lt;ref&gt;Siroj Sorajjakool, Mark Carr and Julius Nam (2009), World Religions, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0789038135}}, page 38&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Ishvara'' has a wide range of meanings that depend on the era and the school of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=mmwizvara&gt;Monier Williams, Sanskrit-English dictionary, [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/mwquery/ Izvara], Sanskrit Digital Lexicon, University of Cologne, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Ishvara", The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A–M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 306&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=riepe&gt;Dale Riepe (1961, Reprinted 1996), Naturalistic Tradition in Indian Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812932}}, pages 177-184, 208-215&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient texts of Indian philosophy, ''Ishvara'' means supreme soul, [[Brahman]] (Highest Reality), ruler, king or husband depending on the context.&lt;ref name=mmwizvara/&gt; In medieval era texts, ''Ishvara'' means God, Supreme Being, personal god, or special Self depending on the school of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=mirceaelaide73&gt;Mircea Eliade (2009), Yoga: Immortality and Freedom, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691142036}}, pages 73-76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=riepe/&gt;&lt;ref name=ianw&gt;Ian Whicher, The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana, State University of New York press, {{ISBN|978-0791438152}}, pages 82-86&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the six systems of [[Hindu philosophy]], [[Samkhya]] and [[Mimamsa]] do not consider the concept of ''Ishvara'', i.e., a supreme being, relevant. [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]], [[Vaisheshika]], [[Vedanta]] and [[Nyaya]] schools of Hinduism discuss Ishvara, but assign different meanings.

Early Nyaya school scholars considered the hypothesis of a deity as a creator God with the power to grant blessings, boons and fruits; but these early Nyaya scholars then rejected this hypothesis, and were non-theistic or atheists.&lt;ref name="John Clayton 2010 page 150"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G Oberhammer (1965), Zum problem des Gottesbeweises in der Indischen Philosophie, Numen, 12: 1-34&lt;/ref&gt; Later scholars of Nyaya school reconsidered this question and offered counter arguments for what is Ishvara and various arguments to prove the existence of omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent deity (God).&lt;ref name=fxc&gt;Francis X. Clooney (2010), Hindu God, Christian God: How Reason Helps Break Down the Boundaries, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199738724}}, pages 18-19, 35-39&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaisheshika school of Hinduism, as founded by Kanada in 1st millennium BC, neither required nor relied on creator deity.&lt;ref name=klausk&gt;Klaus Klostermaier (2007), A Survey of Hinduism, Third Edition, State University of New York, {{ISBN|978-0791470824}}, page 337&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Goel (1984), Indian philosophy: Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika and modern science, Sterling, {{ISBN|978-0865902787}}, pages 149-151&lt;/ref&gt; Later Vaisheshika school adopted the concept of ''Ishvara'', states [[Klaus Klostermaier]], but as an eternal God who co-exists in the universe with eternal substances and atoms, but He "winds up the clock, and lets it run its course".&lt;ref name=klausk/&gt;

This concept of Brahman is not the same as the monotheistic separate God found in Abrahamic religions, where God is considered, states Brodd, as "creator of the world, above and independent of human existence", while in Hinduism "God, the universe, human beings and all else is essentially one thing" and everything is connected oneness, the same god is in every human being as [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]], the eternal Self.&lt;ref name=brodd43&gt;Jeffrey Brodd (2003), World Religions: A Voyage of Discovery, Saint Mary's Press, {{ISBN|978-0884897255}}, page 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher John Fuller (2004), The Camphor Flame: Popular Hinduism and Society in India, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691120485}}, pages 30-31, '''Quote:''' "Crucial in Hindu polytheism is the relationship between the deities and humanity. Unlike Jewish, Christian and Islamic monotheism, predicated on the otherness of God and either his total separation from man and his singular incarnation, Hinduism postulates no absolute distinction between deities and human beings. The idea that all deities are truly one is, moreover, easily extended to proclaim that all human beings are in reality also forms of one supreme deity - Brahman, the Absolute of philosophical Hinduism. In practice, this abstract monist doctrine rarely belongs to an ordinary Hindu's statements, but examples of permeability between the divine and human can be easily found in popular Hinduism in many unremarkable contexts".&lt;/ref&gt;

Hinduism has an ancient and extensive iconography tradition, particularly in the form of ''Murti'' ([[Sanskrit]]: मूर्ति, IAST: Mūrti), or ''Vigraha'' or ''Pratima''.&lt;ref name="pratima Hinduism"/&gt; A ''Murti'' is itself not the god in [[Hinduism]], but it is an image of god and represents emotional and religious value.&lt;ref name=fowler41&gt;Jeaneane D Fowler (1996), Hinduism: Beliefs and Practices, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723608}}, pages 41-45&lt;/ref&gt; A literal translation of ''Murti'' as idol is incorrect, states Jeaneane Fowler, when idol is understood as superstitious end in itself.&lt;ref name=fowler41/&gt; Just like the photograph of a person is not the real person, a ''Murti'' is an image in Hinduism but not the real thing, but in both cases the image reminds of something of emotional and real value to the viewer.&lt;ref name=fowler41/&gt; When a person worships a ''Murti'', it is assumed to be a manifestation of the essence or spirit of the deity, the worshipper's spiritual ideas and needs are meditated through it, yet the idea of ultimate reality or [[Brahman]] is not confined in it.&lt;ref name=fowler41/&gt;

A Murti of a Hindu deity is typically made by carving stone, wood working, metal casting or through pottery. Medieval era texts describing their proper proportions, positions and gestures include the [[Puranas]], [[Agama (Hinduism)|Agamas]] and [[Samhita]]s particularly the [[Shilpa Shastras]].&lt;ref name="klausklost264"/&gt; The expressions in a ''Murti'' vary in diverse Hindu traditions, ranging from ''Ugra'' symbolism to express destruction, fear and violence (Durga, Kali), as well as ''Saumya'' symbolism to express joy, knowledge and harmony (Saraswati, Lakshmi). Saumya images are most common in [[Hindu temple]]s.&lt;ref name=grao17&gt;Gopinath Rao, [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924071128825#page/n61/mode/2up Elements of Hindu Iconography] Madras, Cornell University Archives, pages 17-39&lt;/ref&gt; Other Murti forms found in Hinduism include the [[Linga]].&lt;ref name=stella179&gt;Stella Kramrisch (1994), The Presence of Siva, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691019307}}, pages 179-187&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hinduism, deities and their icons may be hosted in a [[Hindu temple]], within a home or as an amulet. The worship performed by Hindus is known by a number of regional names, such as ''Puja''.&lt;ref name=lochtefeldpuja/&gt; This practice in front of a [[murti]] may be elaborate in large temples, or be a simple song or mantra muttered in home, or offering made to sunrise or river or symbolic anicon of a deity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flood|first=Gavin D.|title=The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2002|isbn=978-0-631-21535-6|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Courtright (1985), in ''Gods of Flesh/Gods of Stone'' (Joanne Punzo Waghorne, Norman Cutler, and Vasudha Narayanan, eds), {{ISBN|978-0231107778}}, Columbia University Press, see Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Galepuja"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gale Encyclopedia of Religion|pages=7493–7495|editor=Lindsay Jones|publisher=Thompson Gale|year=2005|volume=11|isbn=0-02-865980-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological evidence of deity worship in Hindu temples trace ''Puja'' rituals to [[Gupta Empire]] era (~4th century AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael D. |last=Willis |authorlink= |title=The Archaeology of Hindu Ritual |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year= 2009 |chapter= 2: 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael D. |last=Willis  |title=The Formation of Temple Ritual in the Gupta Period: pūjā and pañcamahāyajña | publisher= Gerd Mevissen |year=2008 |url= https://www.academia.edu/2069840/The_Formation_of_Temple_Ritual_in_the_Gupta_Period_puja_and_pancamahayajna}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hindu temples, various pujas may be performed daily at various times of the day; in other temples, it may be occasional.&lt;ref name=ebp&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/483030/puja Puja], Encyclopædia Britannica (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hgb&gt;Hiro G.

Major deities have inspired a vast genre of literature such as the [[Puranas]] and [[Agama (Hinduism)|Agama]] texts as well their own Hindu traditions, but with shared [[mythology]], ritual grammar, [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]], [[axiology]] and polycentrism.&lt;ref name=juliuslipner371/&gt;&lt;ref name=frazierintrop2/&gt; Vishnu and his avatars are at the foundation of [[Vaishnavism]], Shiva for [[Shaivism]], Devi for [[Shaktism]], and some Hindu traditions such as Smarta traditions who revere multiple major deities (five) as henotheistic manifestations of [[Brahman]] (absolute metaphysical Reality).&lt;ref name=lawrence78&gt;David Lawrence (2012), The Routledge Companion to Theism (Editors: Charles Taliaferro, Victoria S. Harrison and Stewart Goetz), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415881647}}, pages 78-79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guy Beck (2005), Alternative Krishnas: Regional and Vernacular Variations on a Hindu Deity, SUNY Press, {{ISBN|978-0791464151}}, pages 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Editors of Hinduism Today|title=What is Hinduism?|last=Editors of Hinduism Today|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9XC9bwMMPcwC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;f=false|work=Himalayan Academy Publications|accessdate=16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are diverse deities in Hinduism, states Lawrence, "Exclusivism – which maintains that only one's own deity is real" is rare in Hinduism.&lt;ref name=lawrence78/&gt; [[Julius J. Lipner|Julius Lipner]], and other scholars, state that pluralism and "polycentrism" – where other deities are recognized and revered by members of different "denominations", has been the Hindu ethos and way of life.&lt;ref name=juliuslipner371/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew J Nicholson (2013), Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231149877}}, pages 167-168&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trimurti and Tridevi===
{{main article|Trimurti|Tridevi}}
[[File:The Hindu Gods Vishnu, Shiva, and Brahma LACMA M.86.337 (1 of 12).jpg|350px|thumb|A 10th century triad – Vishnu, Shiva and Brahma – from [[Bihar]].]]
The concept of Triad (or ''Trimurti'', ''Trinity'') makes a relatively late appearance in Hindu literature, or in the second half of 1st millennium BC.&lt;ref name=jangondatrim&gt;Jan Gonda (1969), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40457085 The Hindu Trinity], Anthropos, 63/64, 1/2, pages 212-226&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of triad, playing three roles in the cosmic affairs, is typically associated with Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva (also called ''Mahesh''); however, this is not the only triad in Hindu literature.&lt;ref name=baileytrim&gt;GM Bailey (1979), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3269716 Trifunctional Elements in the Mythology of the Hindu Trimūrti], Numen, Vol. 26, Fasc. 2, pages 152-163&lt;/ref&gt; Other triads include ''Tridevi'', of three goddesses – Lakshmi, Saraswati and Durga in the text [[Devi Mahatmya]], in the Shakta tradition, who further assert that Devi is the [[Brahman]] (Ultimate Reality) and it is her energy that empowers Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.&lt;ref name=jangondatrim/&gt; The other triads, formulated as deities in ancient Indian literature, include Sun (creator), Air (sustainer) and Fire (destroyer); Prana (creator), Food (sustainer) and Time (destroyer).&lt;ref name=jangondatrim/&gt; These triads, states [[Jan Gonda]], are in some mythologies grouped together without forming a Trinity, and in other times represented as equal, a unity and manifestations of one Brahman.&lt;ref name=jangondatrim/&gt; In the Puranas, for example, this idea of threefold "hypostatization" is expressed as follows,

{{Quote|
They [Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva] exist through each other, and uphold each other; they are parts of one another; they subsist through one another; they are not for a moment separated; they never abandon one another.
|[[Vayu Purana]]|5.17, Translated by Jan Gonda&lt;ref name=jangondatrim/&gt;}}

The triad appears in [[Maitrayaniya Upanishad]], for the first time in recognized roles known ever since, where they are deployed to present the concept of three [[Guṇa]] – the innate nature, tendencies and inner forces found within every being and everything, whose balance transform and keeps changing the individual and the world.&lt;ref name=baileytrim/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James G. Lochtefeld, Guna, in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M, Vol. 1, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|9780823931798}}, page 265&lt;/ref&gt; It is in the medieval Puranic texts, ''Trimurti'' concepts appears in various context, from rituals to spiritual concepts.&lt;ref name=jangondatrim/&gt; The Bhagavad Gita, in verses 9.18, 10.21-23 and 11.15, asserts that the triad or trinity is manifestation of one Brahman, which Krishna affirms himself to be.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf V D'Souza (1996), The Bhagavadgītā and St. John of the Cross, Gregorian University, {{ISBN|978-8876526992}}, pages 340-342&lt;/ref&gt; However, suggests Bailey, the mythology of triad is "not the influence nor the most important one" in Hindu traditions, rather the ideologies and spiritual concepts develop on their own foundations.&lt;ref name=baileytrim/&gt;

===Avatars of Hindu deities===

{{main article|Avatar|Dashavatara}}
Hindu mythology has nurtured the concept of Avatar, which represents the descent of a deity on earth.&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeld72&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M, The Rosen Publishing Group, {{ISBN|978-0-8239-3180-4}}, pages 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sheth98"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1353/pew.2002.0005|last=Sheth|first=Noel|date=Jan 2002|title=Hindu Avatāra and Christian Incarnation: A Comparison| journal=Philosophy East and West|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press |volume=52|issue=1 (Jan. 2002)|pages=98–125|jstor=1400135}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept is commonly translated as "[[incarnation]]",&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeld72/&gt; and is an "appearance" or "manifestation".&lt;ref name="Matchett"&gt;{{cite book|last=Matchett|first=Freda|title=Krishna, Lord or Avatara?: the relationship between Krishna and Vishnu|publisher=9780700712816|year=2001|page=4 | isbn=978-0-7007-1281-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Hugh Partridge]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=7lEFyGiP5r8C&amp;pg=PA148&amp;f=false Introduction to World Religions], pg. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of Avatar is most developed in [[Vaishnavism]] tradition, and associated with [[Vishnu]], particularly with [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinsley|first=David|title=Gale's Encyclopedia of Religion|editor=Lindsay Jones|publisher=Thomson Gale|year=2005|edition=Second|volume=2|pages=707–708|isbn=0-02-865735-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryant18"&gt;{{cite book| last=Bryant| first=Edwin Francis|title=Krishna: A Sourcebook| publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2007| page=18 | isbn=978-0-19-514891-6| url=https://books.google.com/?id=0z02cZe8PU8C&amp;pg=PT32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vishnu takes numerous avatars in Hindu mythology. He becomes female, during the [[Samudra manthan]], in the form of [[Mohini]], to resolve a conflict between the Devas and [[Asura]]s. His male avatars include [[Matsya]], [[Kurma]], [[Varaha]], [[Narasimha]], [[Vamana]], [[Parashurama]], [[Rama]], [[Krishna]], [[Gautama Buddha in Hinduism|Buddha]], and [[Kalki]].&lt;ref name="Bryant18"/&gt; Various texts, particularly the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', discuss the idea of Avatar of Vishnu appearing to restore the cosmic balance whenever the power of evil becomes excessive and causes persistent oppression in the world.&lt;ref name="Sheth98"/&gt;

In [[Shaktism]] traditions, the concept appears in its legends as the various manifestations of [[Devi]], the Divine Mother principal in Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Hawley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawley|first=John Stratton|author2=Vasudha Narayanan|title=The life of Hinduism|publisher=University of California Press|year=2006|page=174|isbn=978-0-520-24914-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7DLj1tYmoTQC&amp;pg=PA174}}&lt;/ref&gt; The avatars of Devi or Parvati include [[Durga]] and [[Kali]], who are particularly revered in eastern states of [[India]], as well as Tantra traditions.&lt;ref&gt;David Kinsley (1988), Hindu Goddesses: Vision of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|0-520063392}}, pages 45-48, 96-97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sally Kempton (2013), Awakening Shakti: The Transformative Power of the Goddesses of Yoga, {{ISBN|978-1604078916}}, pages 165-167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jansen134&gt;Eva Rudy Jansen, The Book of Hindu Imagery: Gods, Manifestations and Their Meaning, Holland: Binkey Kok, {{ISBN|978-9074597074}}, pages 133-134, 41&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty one avatars of Shiva are also described in [[Shaivism]] texts, but unlike Vaishnava traditions, Shaiva traditions have focussed directly on Shiva rather than the Avatar concept.&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeld72/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="691">'''Jai Shri Ram''' means "Hail Lord Rama" or "Victory to Lord [[Rama]]", Hindu deity and the seventh [[Avatar]] of Lord [[Vishnu]]. Religious Hindus consider chanting Jai Shri Ram is a way to get rid of fear, sorrow stress, anxieties and also chanting gives Power and liberation from the cycle of birth and death who chants like genuine crying of a child for mother. [[Lord Rama]] has done various roles in [[Ramayana]] (an ancient Indian epic poem) for human beings as to know how to live and do the Karma without attachment to the world (i.e. actionlessness through action).

{{Judaism}}
'''Jewish atheism''' refers to the [[atheism]] of people who are [[Zera Yisrael|ethnically]] and (at least to some extent) [[Cultural Judaism|culturally Jewish]]. Because [[Jewish identity]] encompasses [[ethnic identity|ethnic]] as well as [[religious identity|religious]] components, the term "Jewish atheism" does not inherently entail a contradiction.

Based on [[Jewish law]]'s emphasis on [[matrilineal descent]], even religiously conservative [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] authorities would accept an atheist born to a Jewish mother as [[Who is a Jew?|fully Jewish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=45132|title=What Makes a Jew "Jewish"?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 study found that half of all [[American Jews]] have doubts about the [[existence of God]], compared to 10–15% of other American religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/religion/story/2011-09-26/jew-atheist-god/50553958/1 |title=Judaism without God? Yes, say American atheists |newspaper=USA Today |first=Kimberly |last=Winston |date=September 26, 2011 |accessdate=July 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organized Jewish life==
There has been a phenomenon of atheistic and secular Jewish organizations, mostly in the past century, from the Jewish socialist [[General Jewish Labor Union|Bund]] in early twentieth-century Poland to the modern Congress of Secular Jewish Organizations and the [[Society for Humanistic Judaism]] in the United States. Many Jewish atheists feel comfortable within any of the three major non-Orthodox Jewish denominations ([[Reform Judaism|Reform]], [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]], and [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]]). This presents less of a contradiction than might first seem apparent, given Judaism's emphasis on practice over belief, with even mainstream guides to Judaism suggesting that belief in God is not a necessary prerequisite to Jewish observance.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: [http://www.myjewishlearning.com/ideas_belief/god/Overview_About_God/God_MustBel_Sept.htm Daniel Septimus, ''Must a Jew Believe in God?''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225020143/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/ideas_belief/god/Overview_About_God/God_MustBel_Sept.htm |date=2008-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Orthodox Judaism]] regards the acceptance of the "Yoke of Heaven" (the sovereignty of the [[God in Judaism|God of Israel]] in the world and the divine origin of the [[Torah]]) as a fundamental obligation for Jews. Even among non-Orthodox Jews, espousing atheism remains problematic outside of the Congress of Secular Jewish Organizations and the [[Society for Humanistic Judaism]]. The Reform movement, for example, has rejected efforts at affiliation by atheistic temples.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9406EEDF1E3AF930A25755C0A962958260 "Reform Jews Reject a Temple Without God", ''New York Times'', June 13, 1994.]&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of atheists in all denominations of modern Judaism, from Secular Humanistic Judaism to Orthodoxy, has been noted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://onfaith.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/georgetown/2007/11/paul_beattys_2001_novel_tuff.html |title=In Praise of Jewish Atheism |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313045320/http://onfaith.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/georgetown/2007/11/paul_beattys_2001_novel_tuff.html |archivedate=March 13, 2012 |work=The Washington Post |first=Jacques |last=Berlinerblau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish theology==
Liberal Jewish theology makes few if any [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] claims and is thus compatible with atheism on an ontological level. The founder of [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], [[Mordechai Kaplan]], espoused a naturalistic definition of God, while some post-[[Holocaust]] theology has also eschewed a [[personal god]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Mordechai Kaplan, ''The Meaning of God in Modern Jewish Religion'' (New York: Behrman’s Jewish book house, 1937); Richard Rubenstein, ''After Auschwitz: Radical Theology and Contemporary Judaism'' (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1966).{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish philosopher Howard Wettstein has advanced a non-metaphysical approach to religious commitment, according to which metaphysical theism-atheism is not the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Wettstein, ''The Significance of Religious Experience'' (Oxford University Press, 2012){{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harold Schulweis]], a Conservative [[rabbi]] trained in the Reconstructionist tradition, has argued that Jewish theology should move from a focus on God to an emphasis on "godliness." This "predicate theology", while continuing to use theistic language, again makes few metaphysical claims that non-believers would find objectionable.&lt;ref&gt;See Harold M. Schulweis. ''Evil and the Morality of God'' (Cincinnati: Hebrew Union College Press, 1984);{{page needed|date=December 2014}} ''For Those Who Can't Believe : Overcoming the Obstacles to Faith'' (Harper Perennial, 1995).{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some Jewish atheists remain deeply uncomfortable with the use of any kind of theistic language. For such Jews traditional practice and symbolism can still retain powerful meaning. They may continue to engage in Jewish rituals such as the lighting of [[Shabbat]] candles and find meaning in many aspects of [[Jewish culture]] and religion. For example, to an atheist Jew, the [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]] might represent the power of the Jewish spirit or stand as a symbol of the fight against assimilation. No mention of a divine force in Jewish history would be accepted literally; the [[Torah]] may be viewed as a common mythology of the Jewish people, not a faith document or correct history.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

=={{anchor|Secular}}Secular Jewish culture==
{{see also|Jewish secularism}}
Many Jewish atheists would reject even this level of ritualized and symbolic identification, instead embracing a thoroughgoing secularism and basing their Jewishness entirely in ethnicity and [[secular Jewish culture]]. Possibilities for secular Jewishness include an identification with Jewish history and peoplehood, immersion in Jewish literature (including such non-religious Jewish authors as [[Philip Roth]] and [[Amos Oz]]), the consumption of [[Jewish food]], the use of [[Jewish humor]], and an attachment to Jewish languages such as [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] or [[Judeo-Spanish|Ladino]]. A high percentage of Israeli Jews identify themselves as secular, rejecting the practice of the Jewish religion (see [[Religion in Israel]]). While some non-believers of Jewish ancestry do not consider themselves Jews, preferring to define themselves solely as atheists, some would argue that Judaism is arguably a culture and tradition that can be embraced without religious faith, despite Jewish culture revolving around [[Abrahamic conceptions of God]].&lt;ref&gt;An example of an atheist rejecting Jewish identification is cited in [http://www.zeek.net/jen_0501.shtml "Hipster Antisemitism," ''Zeek'', January 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable people==
{{See also|List of Jewish atheists}}
Historically, many well-known Jews have rejected a belief in deities. Some have denied the existence of a traditional deity while continuing to use religious language. In 1656 the seventeenth-century Jewish philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]] was excommunicated by Amsterdam's Sephardic synagogue after advancing a [[Pantheism|pantheist]] notion of God that, according to some observers, is both compatible with and paved the way for modern atheism.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Hitchens, ed., ''The Portable Atheist'' (Philadelphia: Da Capo Press, 2007), 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Deeply influenced by Spinoza, [[Albert Einstein]] used theistic language and identified strongly as a Jew, while rejecting the notion of a personal god.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.momentmag.com/moment/issues/2007/04/200704-EinsteinSidebar.html "The Religious Non-believer: Einstein and his God", ''Moment'', April 2007.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007054520/http://momentmag.com/moment/issues/2007/04/200704-EinsteinSidebar.html |date=2010-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The astrophysicist [[Carl Sagan]] was born into a Jewish family and was a non-theist.&lt;ref&gt;Sagan, Carl (February 12, 1986). "Chapter 23". Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science. Ballantine Books. p. 330. {{ISBN|0-345-33689-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Marx]] was born into an ethnically Jewish family but raised as a [[Lutheran]], and is among the most notable and influential atheist thinkers of modern history; he developed dialectical and [[historical materialism]] which became the basis for his critique of [[capitalism]] and his theories of [[scientific socialism]]. Marx became a major influence among other prominent Jewish intellectuals including [[Moses Hess]]. In one of his most cited comments on religion he stated: "Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the [[opium of the people]]".

Many other famous Jews have wholeheartedly embraced atheism, rejecting religiosity altogether. [[Sigmund Freud]] penned ''[[The Future of an Illusion]]'', in which he both eschewed religious belief and outlined its origins and prospects. At the same time he urged a Jewish colleague to raise his son within the Jewish religion, arguing that "If you do not let your son grow up as a Jew, you will deprive him of those sources of energy which cannot be replaced by anything else."&lt;ref&gt;David S. Ariel, ''What Do Jews Believe?'' (New York: Shocken Books, 1995), 248.&lt;/ref&gt; The anarchist [[Emma Goldman]] was born to an Orthodox Jewish family and rejected belief in God, while the Israeli prime minister [[Golda Meir]], when asked if she believed in God, answered "I believe in the Jewish people, and the Jewish people believe in God."&lt;ref&gt;See Emma Goldman, "The Philosophy of Atheism," in Christopher Hitchens, ed., ''The Portable Atheist'' (Philadelphia: Da Capo Press, 2007), 129–33; Golda Meir is quoted by Jonathan Rosen in [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04E4D9173DF937A25751C1A9659C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all  "So Was It Odd of God?", ''The New York Times'', December 14, 2003.]&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the French Jewish philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] stated somewhat cryptically, "I rightly pass for an atheist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chronicle.com/free/2004/10/2004101102n.htm |title=Jacques Derrida, Thinker Who Influenced and Infuriated a Range of Humanistic Fields, Dies at 74 |publisher=Chronicle of Higher Education |author=Scott Mclemee |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060206100532/http://chronicle.com/free/2004/10/2004101102n.htm |archivedate=February 6, 2006 |date=October 11, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the world of entertainment, [[Woody Allen]] has made a career out of the tension between his Jewishness and religious doubt ("Not only is there no God, but try getting a plumber on weekends").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quotationspage.com/quotes/Woody_Allen/|title=Woody Allen Quotes - The Quotations Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Silverman (activist)|David Silverman]], president of the [[American Atheists]] since 2010, swore after his bar mitzvah that he would never again lie about not being an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NQOnjswuFI|title=Dave Silverman "I'm an Atheist (And So Are You); Why I've Changed My Mind on Jewish Atheism"|first=|last=Freethought Arizona|date=12 December 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Judy Chicago''' (born '''Judith Sylvia Cohen'''; July 20, 1939) is an American [[feminist art]]ist, art educator,&lt;ref&gt;Chicago, Judy. (2014). ''Institutional Time.'' The Monacelli Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and writer known for her large collaborative [[art installation]] pieces about birth and creation images, which examine the role of women in history and culture. By the 1970s, Chicago had founded the first [[feminist art]] program in the United States. Chicago's work incorporates a variety of artistic skills, such as [[needlework]], counterbalanced with labor-intensive skills such as [[welding]] and [[pyrotechnics]]. Chicago's most well known work is ''[[The Dinner Party]]'', which is permanently installed in the [[Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art]] at the [[Brooklyn Museum]]. ''The Dinner Party'' celebrates the accomplishments of women throughout history and is widely regarded as the first epic feminist artwork. Other notable art projects by Chicago include ''[[International Honor Quilt]]'', ''The Birth Project,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Birth-Project-Judy-Chicago/dp/0385187106|title=The Birth Project|last=Chicago|first=Judy|date=1985-03-05|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=9780385187107|edition=First|location=Place of publication not identified|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Powerplay,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Judy-Chicago-PowerPlay/dp/0983931232|title=Judy Chicago PowerPlay|last=Chicago|first=Judy|last2=Gallery|first2=David Richard|last3=Katz|first3=Jonathan D.|date=2012|isbn=9780983931232|location=Santa Fe, NM}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Holocaust Project.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Holocaust-Project-Darkness-Into-Light/dp/0670842125|title=Holocaust Project: From Darkness Into Light|last=Chicago|first=Judy|last2=Woodman|first2=Donald|date=1993-10-01|publisher=Viking|isbn=9780670842124|edition= 1st|location=New York, N.Y., U.S.A u.a|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early personal life==

Judy Chicago was born Judith Sylvia Cohen&lt;ref name="A305"&gt;Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 305&lt;/ref&gt; in 1939, to Arthur and May Cohen, in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. Her father came from a twenty-three generation lineage of [[rabbi]]s, including the [[Vilna Gaon]]. Unlike his family predecessors, Arthur became a [[labor organization|labor organizer]] and a [[Marxist]].&lt;ref name="F279"/&gt; He worked nights at a post office and took care of Chicago during the day, while May, who was a former dancer, worked as a [[medical secretary]].&lt;ref name="A305"/&gt;&lt;ref name="F279"/&gt; Arthur's active participation in the [[American Communist Party]], liberal views towards women and support of worker's rights strongly influenced Chicago's ways of thinking and belief.&lt;ref name="A306"&gt;Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 306&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[McCarthyism]] era in the 1950s, Arthur was investigated, which made it difficult for him to find work and caused the family much turmoil.&lt;ref name="F279"/&gt; In 1945, while Chicago was alone at home with her infant brother, Ben, an [[FBI]] agent visited their house. The agent began to ask the six-year-old Chicago questions about her father and his friends, but the agent was interrupted upon the return of May to the house.&lt;ref name="A306"/&gt; Arthur's health declined, and he died in 1953 from [[peritonitis]]. May would not discuss his death with her children and did not allow them to attend the funeral. Chicago did not come to terms with his death until she was an adult; in the early 1960s she was hospitalized for almost a month with a bleeding ulcer attributed to unresolved [[grief]].&lt;ref name="F279"&gt;Felder and Rosen, 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

May loved the arts, and instilled her passion for them in her children, as evident in Chicago's future as an artist, and brother Ben's eventual career as a [[pottery|potter]]. At age of three, Chicago began to draw and was sent to the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] to attend classes.&lt;ref name="F279"/&gt;&lt;ref name="W5"&gt;Wydler and Lippard, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; By the age of 5, Chicago knew that she "never wanted to do anything but make art"&lt;ref name="W5"/&gt; and started attending classes at the Art Institute of Chicago.&lt;ref name="The Guardian" /&gt;  She applied but was denied admission to the Art Institute,&lt;ref name="A306"/&gt; and instead attended [[UCLA]] on a scholarship.&lt;ref name="F279"/&gt;

==Education and early career==

While at UCLA, she became politically active, designing posters for the UCLA [[NAACP]]  chapter and eventually became its corresponding secretary.&lt;ref name="A306"/&gt; In June 1959, she met and became romantically linked with Jerry Gerowitz. She left school and moved in with him, for the first time having her own studio space. The couple [[hitch hike]]d to New York in 1959, just as Chicago's mother and brother moved to Los Angeles to be closer to her.&lt;ref name="A308"&gt;Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 308&lt;/ref&gt; The couple lived in [[Greenwich Village]] for a time, before returning in 1960 from Los Angeles to Chicago so she could finish her degree. Chicago married Gerowitz in 1961.&lt;ref name="A311"&gt;Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 311&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated with a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] in 1962 and was a member of the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]]. Gerowitz died in a car crash in 1963, devastating Chicago and causing her to suffer from an [[identity crisis]] until later that decade. She received her [[Master of Fine Arts]] from UCLA in 1964.&lt;ref name="F279"/&gt;

While in grad school, Chicago's created a series that was [[abstract art|abstract]], yet easily recognized as male and female [[sexual organs]]. These early works were called ''Bigamy,'' and represented the death of her husband. One depicted an abstract [[human penis|penis]], which was "stopped in flight" before it could unite with a [[vagina|vaginal form]]. Her professors, who were mainly men, were dismayed over these works.&lt;ref name="A311"/&gt; Despite the use of sexual organs in her work, Chicago refrained from using gender politics or identity as themes.

In 1965, Chicago displayed work in her first solo show, at the Rolf Nelson Gallery in Los Angeles; Chicago was one of only four female artists to take part in the show.&lt;ref name="Illustrated Career History"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chicago|first=Judy|title=Illustrated Career History|url=http://www.judychicago.com/about/career-history.php|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227074456/http://www.judychicago.com/about/career-history.php|archivedate=2014-02-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, Chicago was asked why she did not participate in the "California Women in the Arts" exhibition at the [[Lytton Center]], to which she answered, "I won't show in any group defined as Woman, Jewish, or California. Someday when we all grow up there will be no labels." Chicago began working in [[ice sculpture]], which represented "a metaphor for the preciousness of life," another reference towards her husband's death.&lt;ref name="A314"&gt;Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 314&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pasadenalifesaversstudy.jpg|thumb|right|''Study for Pasadena Lifesavers,'' prismacolor, 1968.]]

In 1969, the [[Pasadena Art Museum]] exhibited a series of Chicago's spherical acrylic plastic dome sculptures and drawings in an "experimental" gallery. ''[[Art in America]]'' noted that Chicago's work was at the forefront of the [[conceptual art]] movement, and the ''Los Angeles Times'' described the work as showing no signs of "theoretical New York type art."&lt;ref name="A314"/&gt; Chicago would describe her early artwork as [[minimalist]] and as her trying to be "one of the boys".&lt;ref name="L455"&gt;Lewis and Lewis, 455.&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago would also experiment with [[performance art]], using [[fireworks]] and [[pyrotechnics]] to create "atmospheres", which involved flashes of coloured smoke being manipulated outdoors. Through this work she attempted to "feminize" and "soften" the landscape.&lt;ref name="A315"&gt;Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 315&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, Chicago also began exploring her own sexuality in her work. She created the ''Pasadena Lifesavers,'' which was a series of abstract paintings that placed [[acrylic paint]] on [[Plexiglas]]. The works blended colors to create an illusion that the shapes "turn, dissolve, open, close, vibrate, gesture, wiggle," representing her own discovery that "I was [[orgasm|multi-orgasmic]]." Chicago credited ''Pasadena Lifesavers,'' as being the major turning point in her work in relation to women's sexuality and representation.&lt;ref name="A315"/&gt;

===From Cohen to Gerowitz to Chicago: Name change===

As Chicago made a name for herself as an artist and came to know herself as a woman, she no longer felt connected to her last name, Cohen. This was due to the late grief of the death of her father and the lost connection to her name through marriage, Judith Gerowitz, after her husband's death. She decided she wanted to change her last name to something independent of being connected to a man by marriage or heritage.&lt;ref name="F279"/&gt; During this time, she married sculptor [[Lloyd Hamrol]], in 1965. (They divorced in 1979.)&lt;ref name="F280"&gt;Felder and Rosen, 280.&lt;/ref&gt; Gallery owner [[Rolf Nelson]] nicknamed her "Judy Chicago"&lt;ref name="F279"/&gt; because of her strong personality and thick [[Chicago accent]]. She decided this would be her new name, and sought to change it legally. She changed her last name from an ethnically charged, Gerowitz, to an ethnically neutral Chicago. In doing so, she freed herself from a certain social identity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jewish Identity in Modern Art History|last=Soussloff|first=Catherine|publisher=U of California Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago was described as being "appalled" by the fact that she had to have her new husband's signature on the paperwork to change her name legally.&lt;ref name="F280"/&gt; To celebrate the name change, she posed for the exhibition invitation dressed like a [[boxer]], wearing a [[sweatshirt]] with her new last name on it.&lt;ref name="A315"/&gt; She also posted a banner across the gallery at her 1970 solo show at [[California State University, Fullerton|California State University at Fullerton]], that read: "Judy Gerowitz hereby divests herself of all names imposed upon her through male social dominance and chooses her own name, Judy Chicago."&lt;ref name="F280"/&gt; An advertisement with the same statement was also placed in ''[[Artforum]]'s'' October 1970 issue.&lt;ref name=Levin2007p139&gt;[[#SrcLevin2007|Levin, ''Becoming Judy Chicago; A Biography of the Artist'', p. 139]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic career==

===The feminist art movement and the 1970s===
In 1970, Chicago decided to teach full-time at [[Fresno State College]], hoping to teach women the skills needed to express the female perspective in their work.&lt;ref name="A317"&gt;Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 317&lt;/ref&gt; At Fresno, she planned a class that would consist only of women, and she decided to teach off campus to escape "the presence and hence, the expectations of men."&lt;ref name="A318"&gt;Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 318&lt;/ref&gt; She taught the first women's art class in the fall of 1970 at Fresno State College. It became the [[Feminist Art Program]], a full 15-unit program, in the spring of 1971. This was the first feminist art program in the United States. Fifteen students studied under Chicago at Fresno State College: Dori Atlantis, Susan Boud, Gail Escola, [[Vanalyne Green]], [[Suzanne Lacy]], Cay Lang, [[Karen LeCocq]], Jan Lester, [[Chris Rush]], Judy Schaefer, Henrietta Sparkman, [[Faith Wilding]], Shawnee Wollenman, [[Nancy Youdelman]], and Cheryl Zurilgen. Together, as the Feminist Art Program, these women rented and refurbished an off-campus studio at 1275 Maple Avenue in downtown Fresno. Here they collaborated on art, held reading groups, and discussion groups about their life experiences which then influenced their art. All of the students and Chicago contributed $25 per month to rent the space and to pay for materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/851420315|title=Institutional time : a critique of studio art education|last=1939-|first=Chicago, Judy,|isbn=9781580933667|oclc=851420315}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Judy Chicago and [[Miriam Schapiro]] reestablished the [[Feminist Art Program]] at [[California Institute of the Arts]]. After Chicago left for Cal Arts, the class at Fresno State College was continued by Rita Yokoi from 1971 to 1973, and then by [[Joyce Aiken]] in 1973, until her retirement in 1992.{{refn|Aiken opened the all-women's [[co-op]] [[Gallery 25]] with her students, developed the Fresno Art Museum's Council of 100 and the Distinguished Women Artist Series, which helped develop programming and exhibitions about women at the museum.&lt;ref name="Fresno1"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Dr. Laura Meyer |author2=Nancy Youdelman | year= | title=A Studio of Their Own: The Legacy of the Fresno Feminist Art Experiment | work=A Studio of their Own | publisher= | url=http://www.astudiooftheirown.org/legacy.html | accessdate=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}}

Chicago is considered one of the "first-generation feminist artists," a group that also includes [[Mary Beth Edelson]], [[Carolee Schneeman]], and [[Rachel Rosenthal]]. They were part of the [[Feminist art movement]] in Europe and the [[Feminist art movement in the United States|United States]] in the early 1970s to develop feminist writing and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Thomas Patin and Jennifer McLerran | title=Artwords: A Glossary of Contemporary Art Theory |location=Westport, CT | publisher=Greenwood | year=1997 |page=55 | url=https://www.questia.com/read/27960870 |accessdate=8 January 2014 }} via [[Questia]] (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicago became a teacher at the [[California Institute for the Arts]], and was a leader for their Feminist Art Program. In 1972, the program created [[Womanhouse]], alongside [[Miriam Schapiro]], which was the first art exhibition space to display a female point of view in art.&lt;ref name="F280"/&gt; With [[Arlene Raven]] and [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville]], Chicago co-founded the Los Angeles [[Woman's Building]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="AAA"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year= | title=Woman's Building records, 1970-1992 | work=[[Archives of American Art]] | publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] | url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/womans-building-records-6347/more#biohist | accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This art school and exhibition space was in a structure named after a pavilion at the 1893 World's Colombian Exhibition that featured art made by women from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfmoma.org/artist/Judy_Chicago#biography|title=Judy Chicago|website=SFMOMA|language=en|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This housed the Feminist Studio Workshop, described by the founders as "an experimental program in female education in the arts.  Our purpose is to develop a new concept of art, a new kind of artist and a new art community built from the lives, feelings, and needs of women."&lt;ref name="L455"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moravec|first=Michelle|title=Looking For Lyotard, Beyond the Genre of Feminist Manifesto|journal=Trespassing|date=2013|volume=1|issue=2|url=http://trespassingjournal.com/Issue2/TPJ_I2_Moravec_Article.pdf|accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Chicago began creating spray-painted canvas, primarily abstract, with [[geometric]] forms on them. These works evolved, using the same medium, to become more centered around the meaning of the "feminine". Chicago was strongly influenced by [[Gerda Lerner]], whose writings convinced her that women who continued to be unaware and ignorant of [[women's history]] would continue to struggle independently and collectively.&lt;ref name="F280"/&gt;

===Womanhouse===
{{main|Womanhouse}}
Womanhouse was a project that involved Judy Chicago and [[Miriam Schapiro]]. It began in the fall of 1971. They wanted to start the year with a large scale collaborative project that involved woman artists who spent much of their time talking about their problems as women. They used those problems as fuel and dealt with them while working on the project. Judy thought that female students often approach art-making with an unwillingness to push their limits due to their lack of familiarity with tools and processes, and an inability to see themselves as working people. 
"The aim of the Feminist Art Program is to help women restructure their personalities to be more consistent with their desires to be artists and to help them build their art-making out of their experiences as women."&lt;ref name=Schapiro&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schapiro|first1=Miriam|last2=Chicago|first2=Judy|title=Womanhouse catalog essay|url=http://www.suzyspence.com/womanhouse/Womanhousecatalogessay.pdf|publisher=Womanhouse|accessdate=7 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611044304/http://www.suzyspence.com/womanhouse/Womanhousecatalogessay.pdf|archive-date=11 June 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Womanhouse is a "true" dramatic representation of woman's experience beginning in childhood, encompassing the struggles at home, with housework, menstruation, marriage, etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1975, Chicago's first book, ''Through the Flower'', was published; it "chronicled her struggles to find her own identity as a woman artist."&lt;ref name="Illustrated Career History" /&gt;

===''The Dinner Party''===
[[File:Judy Chicago The Dinner Party.JPG|thumb|right|''[[The Dinner Party]]'' as installed at the [[Brooklyn Museum]].]]
{{Main|The Dinner Party}}

Chicago decided to take Lerner's lesson to heart and took action to teach women about ''their'' history. This action would become Chicago's [[masterpiece]], ''[[The Dinner Party]]'', now in the collection of the [[Brooklyn Museum]].&lt;ref name="BM1"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year= | title=The Dinner Party | work=Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art | publisher=Brooklyn Museum | url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/index.php | accessdate=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took her five years and cost about $250,000 to complete.&lt;ref name="The Guardian" /&gt; First, Chicago conceived the project in her [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] studio: a large triangle, which measures 48-feet by 43-feet by 36-feet, consisting of 39 [[place setting]]s.&lt;ref name="F280"/&gt; Each place setting commemorates a historical or mythical female figure, such as artists, goddesses, activists and martyrs. The project came into fruition with the assistance of over 400 people, mainly women, who volunteered to assist in [[needlework]], creating sculptures and other aspects of the process.&lt;ref name="F281"&gt;Felder and Rosen, 281.&lt;/ref&gt; When ''The Dinner Party'' was first constructed it was a traveling exhibition. Through the Flower, her non-profit organization, was originally created to cover the expense of the creation and travel of the artwork. Jane Gerhard dedicated a book to Judy Chicago and ''The Dinner Party'', entitled "The Dinner Party: Judy Chicago and The Power of Popular Feminism, 1970-2007".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.throughtheflower.org|title=Through the Flower and Judy Chicago|website=www.throughtheflower.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were many art critics including Hilton Kramer from The New York Times, who were unimpressed by her work.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/insider/judy-chicago-dinner-part-art-reviews-times.html&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Kramer felt Judy's intended vision was not conveyed through this piece and "it looked like an outrageous libel on the female imagination".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; Although art critics, felt her work lacked depth and the dinner party was just "vaginas on plates", it was popular and captivated the general public. Chicago was able to debut her work in 6 countries on 3 different continents. She was able to reach over a million people through her artwork. Her piece of work may not have agreed with critics but was able to captivate the public with her feminist message and honor the 39 historical figures and 999 other women featured in her work.

===''Birth Project'' and ''PowerPlay''===

From 1980 until 1985, Chicago created ''Birth Project''. It took five years to create. The piece used images of [[childbirth]] to celebrate woman's role as mother. Chicago was inspired to create this collective work because of the lack of imagery and representation of birth in the art world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/08/style/judy-chicago-women-s-lives-and-art.html|title=JUDY CHICAGO: WOMEN'S LIVES AND ART|last=Bennetts|first=Leslie|date=1985-04-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-11|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The installation reinterpreted the [[Genesis creation narrative]], which focused on the idea that a male [[god]] created a male human, [[Adam]], without the involvement of a woman.&lt;ref name="F281"/&gt; Chicago described the piece as revealing a "primordial female self hidden among the recesses of my soul...the birthing woman is part of the dawn of creation."&lt;ref name="W5"/&gt; 150 needleworkers from the United States, [[Canada]] and [[New Zealand]] assisted in the project, working on 100 panels, by [[quilting]], [[macrame]], [[embroidery]] and other techniques. The size of the piece means it is rarely displayed in its entirety. The majority of the pieces from ''Birth Project'' are held in the collection of the [[Albuquerque Museum]].&lt;ref name="F281"/&gt;

Chicago was not personally interested in motherhood. While she admired the women who chose this path, she did not find it right for herself. As recently as 2012, she said, "There was no way on this earth I could have had children and the career I've had."&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cooke|first=Rachel|title=The art of Judy Chicago|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/nov/04/judy-chicago-art-feminism-britain|accessdate=15 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''Birth Project'', Chicago returned to independent studio work. She created ''PowerPlay,'' a series of drawings, [[weaving]]s, paintings, [[cast paper]] and bronze [[reliefs]]. Through the series, Chicago replaced the male [[gaze]] with a feminist one, exploring the construct of masculinity and how power has affected men.&lt;ref name="JVL"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2012 | title=Judy Chicago | work= | publisher=Jewish Virtual Library | url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/jchicago.html | accessdate=15 Jan 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A new kind of collaboration and ''The Holocaust Project''===

In the mid-1980s Chicago's interests "shifted beyond 'issues of female identity' to an exploration of masculine power and powerlessness in the context of the Holocaust."&lt;ref name="Jewish Renaissance"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Judy Chicago in the UK | author=Galit Mana | journal=[[Jewish Renaissance]] |date=October 2012 | volume=12 | issue=1 | pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago's ''The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light'' (1985–93)&lt;ref name="Jewish Renaissance"/&gt; is a collaboration with her husband, photographer [[Donald Woodman]], whom she married on [[New Year's Eve]] 1985. Although Chicago's previous husbands were both [[Jewish]], it wasn't until she met Woodman that she began to explore her own Jewish heritage.  Chicago met poet Harvey Mudd, who had written an [[epic poem]] about the [[Holocaust]]. Chicago was interested in illustrating the poem, but decided to create her own work instead, using her own art, visual and written. Chicago worked alongside her husband to complete the piece, which took eight years to finish.&lt;ref name="F281"/&gt; The piece, which documents victims of the Holocaust, was created during a time of personal loss in Chicago's life: the death of her brother Ben, from [[Lou Gehrig's disease]], and the death of her mother from [[cancer]].&lt;ref name="F282"&gt;Felder and Rosen, 282.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicago used the tragic event of the Holocaust as a prism through which to explore victimization, oppression, injustice, and human cruelty.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; To seek inspiration for the project, Chicago and Woodman watched the documentary ''[[Shoah (film)|Shoah]]'', which comprises interviews with Holocaust survivors at  [[Nazi concentration camps]] and other relevant Holocaust sites.&lt;ref name="F282"/&gt; They also explored photo archives and written pieces about the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="W6"/&gt; They spent several months touring concentration camps and visited [[Israel]].&lt;ref name="Jewish Renaissance"/&gt; Chicago brought other issues into the work, such as [[environmentalism]], [[Native American genocide]],&lt;ref name="W5"/&gt; and the [[Vietnam War]]. With these subjects Chicago sought to relate contemporary issues to the moral dilemma behind the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="F282"/&gt; This aspect of the work caused controversy within the Jewish community, due to the comparison of the Holocaust to these other historical and contemporary concerns.&lt;ref name="W5"/&gt; ''The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light'' consists of sixteen large scale works made of a variety of mediums including: [[tapestry]], [[stained glass]], metal work, wood work, photography, painting, and the [[sewing]] of [[Audrey Cowan]]. The exhibit ends with a piece that displays a Jewish couple at [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]. The piece comprises 3000 square feet, providing a full exhibition experience for the viewer.&lt;ref name="F282"/&gt; ''The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light'' was exhibited for the first time in October 1993 at the [[Spertus Museum]] in Chicago.&lt;ref name="F282"/&gt; Most of the work from the piece is held at the [[Holocaust Center (Pittsburgh)|Holocaust Center]] in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="F284"&gt;Felder and Rosen, 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next six years, Chicago created works that explored the experiences of concentration camp victims.&lt;ref name="Jewish Renaissance"/&gt; Galit Mana of ''Jewish Renaissance'' magazine notes, "This shift in focus led Chicago to work on other projects with an emphasis on Jewish tradition", including ''Voices from the Song of Songs'' (1997), where Chicago "introduces feminism and female sexuality into her representation of strong biblical female characters."&lt;ref name="Jewish Renaissance"/&gt;

===Current work and life===

In 1985, Chicago was remarried, to photographer Donald Woodman. To celebrate the couple's 25th wedding anniversary, Chicago created a "Renewal Ketubah" in 2010.&lt;ref name="Illustrated Career History" /&gt;

In 1994, Judy Chicago started "Resolutions: A Stitch in Time" which took 6 years to complete. The public audience later got to see this project at the Museum of Art and Design in New York in 2000.&lt;ref name="Judy Chicago"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/judy-chicago-9246631|title=Judy Chicago|website=Biography.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Chicago and Woodman moved into the historic [[Belen Hotel]], an historic railroad hotel in [[Belen, New Mexico]] which Woodman had spent three years converting into a home.&lt;ref name="Judy Chicago"/&gt;

Chicago's archives are held at the [[Schlesinger Library]] at [[Radcliffe College]], and her collection of women's history and culture books are held in the collection of the [[University of New Mexico]]. In 1999, Chicago received the UCLA Alumni Professional Achievement Award, and has been awarded [[honorary degree]]s from [[Lehigh University]], [[Smith College]], [[Duke University]]&lt;ref name="JWE"&gt;{{cite web | author=Debra Wacks | year=2012 | title=Judy Chicago | work= | publisher=Jewish Women's Archives | url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/chicago-judy | accessdate=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Russell Sage College]].&lt;ref name="F284"/&gt; In 2004, Chicago received a Visionary Woman Award from [[Moore College of Art &amp; Design]].&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;{{cite web|title=Visionary Woman Awards|url=http://www.moore.edu/support_moore/visionary_woman_awards|work=Support Moore|publisher=Moore College of Art &amp; Design|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chicago was named a [[National Women's History Project]] honoree for [[Women's History Month]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="NWHP"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2008 | title=Judy Chicago | work=2008 Honorees | publisher=National Women's History Month Project | url=http://nwhp.org/whm/chicago_bio.php | accessdate=15 Jan 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago donated her collection of feminist art educational materials to [[Penn State University]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Judy Chicago Art Education Collection {{!}} Penn State|url = http://judychicago.arted.psu.edu/|website = judychicago.arted.psu.edu|accessdate = 2015-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; She lives in [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref name="PSU"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2011 | title=Penn State Receives Judy Chicago Feminist Art Education Collections | work=Local News | publisher=Gant Daily | url=http://gantdaily.com/2011/06/12/penn-state-receives-judy-chicago-feminist-art-education-collections/ | accessdate=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 2011, Chicago returned to Los Angeles for the opening of the "Concurrents" exhibition at the [[Getty Museum]]. For the exhibition, she returned to the [[Pomona College]] football field, where in the late 1960s she had held a firework-based installation, and performed the piece again.&lt;ref name="LAT1"&gt;{{cite web | author=Jori Finkel | year=2011 | title=Q&amp;A Judy Chicago | work=Censorship | publisher=Los Angeles Times | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/oct/30/entertainment/la-ca-pst-judy-chicago-and-rebecca-mcgrew-2-20111030 | accessdate=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicago had two solo exhibitions in the [[United Kingdom]] in 2012, one in [[London]] and another in [[Liverpool]].&lt;ref name="Jewish Renaissance"/&gt; The Liverpool exhibition included the launch of Chicago's book about [[Virginia Woolf]]. Once a peripheral part of her artistic expression, Chicago now considers writing to be well integrated into her career.&lt;ref name="Jewish Renaissance"/&gt; That year, she was also awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Palm Springs Art Fair.&lt;ref name="Judy Chicago"/&gt;

Chicago strives to push herself, exploring new directions for her art; she even attended car-body school to learn to air-brush and has recently begun to work in glass.&lt;ref name="The Guardian" /&gt; Taking such risks is easier to do when one lives by Chicago's philosophy: "I'm not career driven. [[Damien Hirst]]'s dots sold, so he made thousands of dots. I would, like, never do that! It wouldn't even occur to me."&lt;ref name="The Guardian" /&gt; Chicago's subject matter, however, has broadened from the focus of ''The Dinner Party''. In the words of the artist: "I guess you could say that my eyes were lifted from my vagina."&lt;ref name="The Guardian" /&gt;

Chicago has permanent collections in numerous museums around the world. Those include, [[The British Museum]], [[The Brooklyn Museum]], The [[Getty Trust]], The [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]], [[New Mexico Museum of Art]], [[The National Gallery of Art]], [[The National Museum of Women in the Arts]], The [[Penn Academy of the Fine Arts]], and The [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artstor.org/content/judy-chicago|title=Judy Chicago {{!}} Artstor|website=www.artstor.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her interview with [[Gloria Steinem]], Chicago spoke of her "goal as an artist", stating that it "…has been to create images in which the female experience is the path to the universal, as opposed to learning everything through the male gaze."&lt;ref&gt;"Judy Chicago" by Gloria Steinem, December/January 2018 issue of "Interview", pp. 28-31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and work==
Chicago trained herself in "macho arts," taking classes in auto body work, [[boat building]], and pyrotechnics. Through auto body work she learned [[spray painting]] techniques and the skill to fuse color and surface to any type of media, which would become a signature of her later work. The skills learned through boat building would be used in her sculpture work, and pyrotechnics would be used to create [[fireworks]] for performance pieces. These skills allowed Chicago to bring [[fiberglass]] and [[metal]] into her sculpture, and eventually she would become an apprentice under [[Mim Silinsky]] to learn the art of porcelain painting, which would be used to create works in ''The Dinner Party''. Chicago also added the skill of [[stained glass]] to her artistic tool belt, which she used for ''The Holocaust Project''.&lt;ref name="F280"/&gt; Photography became more present in Chicago's work as her relationship with photographer Donald Woodman developed.&lt;ref name="W6"&gt;Wylder and Lippard, 6&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2003, Chicago has been working with [[glass]].&lt;ref name="PSU"/&gt;

Collaboration is a major aspect of Chicago's installation works. ''The Dinner Party'', ''The Birth Project'' and ''The Holocaust Project'' were all completed as a collaborative process with Chicago and hundreds of volunteer participants. Volunteer artisans skills vary, often connected to "stereotypical" women's arts such as [[textile arts]].&lt;ref name="F280"/&gt;&lt;ref name="F282"/&gt; Chicago makes a point to acknowledge her assistants as collaborators, a task at which other artists have notably failed.&lt;ref name="The Guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gerhard|first1=Jane|title=The Dinner Party: Judy Chicago and the power of popular feminism. 1970-2007|date=2013|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens, Georgia|isbn=0-8203-3675-0|pages=2, 228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Through the Flower==

In 1978, Chicago founded [[Through the Flower]], a non-profit feminist art organization. The organization seeks to educate the public about the importance of art and how it can be used as a tool to emphasize women's achievements. Through the Flower also serves as the maintainer of Chicago's works, having handled the storage of ''The Dinner Party,'' before it found a permanent home at the Brooklyn Museum. The organization also maintained The Dinner Party Curriculum, which serves as a "living curriculum" for education about feminist art ideas and [[pedagogy]]. The online aspect of the curriculum was donated to [[Penn State University]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="PSU"/&gt;

==Teaching career==

Judy Chicago became aware of the sexism that was rampant in modern art institutions, museums, and schools while getting her undergraduate and graduate degree at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] in the 1960s. Ironically, she didn’t challenge this observation as an undergrad. In fact, she did quite the opposite by trying to match -- both in her artwork and in her personal style --  what she thought of as masculinity in the artistic styles and habits of her male counterparts. Not only did she begin to work with heavy industrial materials, but she also smoked cigars, dressed “masculine”, and attended motorcycle shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chicago|first=Judy|last2=Meyer|first2=Laura|date=1995-12-28|title=Judy Chicago, Feminist Artist and Educator|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1300/j015v17n01_13|journal=Women &amp; Therapy|volume=17|issue=1-2|pages=125–140|doi=10.1300/j015v17n01_13|issn=0270-3149}}&lt;/ref&gt; This awareness continued to grow as she recognized how society did not see women as professional artists in the same way they recognized men. Angered by this, Chicago channeled this energy and used it to strengthen her feminist values as a person and teacher. While most teachers based their lessons on technique, visual forms, and color, the foundation for Chicago’s teachings were on the content and social significance of the art, especially in [[feminism]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keifer-Boyd|first=Karen|date=January 2007|title=From Content to Form: Judy Chicago's Pedagogy with Reflections by Judy Chicago|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00393541.2007.11650096|journal=Studies in Art Education|volume=48|issue=2|pages=134–154|doi=10.1080/00393541.2007.11650096|issn=0039-3541}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stemming from the male-dominated art community Chicago studied with for so many years, she valued art based on research, social or political views, and/or experience. She wanted her students to grow into their art professions without having to sacrifice what womanhood meant to them. Chicago developed an art education methodology in which "female-centered content," such as menstruation and giving birth, is encouraged by the teacher as "[[The personal is political|personal is political]]" content for art.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago, Judy, (n.d.). ''Art Practice/Art Pedagogy'', Judy Chicago Art Education Collection, Penn State, Box 11, Folder 6, page 1 at http://judychicago.arted.psu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Art-Practice-Art-PedagogyTranscript-and-Slide-Presentation-Boxx-11-6.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago advocates the teacher as facilitator by actively listening to students in order to guide content searches and the translation of content into art. She refers to her teaching methodology as "participatory art [[pedagogy]]."&lt;ref&gt;Keifer-Boyd, K. (2007). From content to form: Judy Chicago's pedagogy with reflections by Judy Chicago. Studies in Art Education: A Journal of Issues and Research in Art Education, 48(2), 133-153.&lt;/ref&gt;

The art created in the [[Feminist Art Program]] and [[Womanhouse]] introduced perspectives and content about women’s lives that had been taboo topics in society, including the art world.&lt;ref&gt;Fields, Jill (Ed.).

''The Dinner Party: Judy Chicago and the power of popular feminism. 1970-2007''. Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 Chicago developed the [[Feminist Art Program]] at California State University, Fresno, and has implemented other teaching projects that conclude with an art exhibition by students such as [[Womanhouse]] with [[Miriam Schapiro]] at CalArts, and ''SINsation'' in 1999 at Indiana University, ''From Theory to Practice: A Journey of Discovery'' at Duke University in 2000, ''At Home: A Kentucky Project with Judy Chicago and Donald Woodman'' at Western Kentucky University in 2002, ''Envisioning the Future'' at California Polytechnic State University and Pomona Arts Colony in 2004, and ''Evoke/Invoke/Provoke'' at Vanderbilt University in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago, Judy. (2014)  Institutional Time: A Critique of Studio Art Education. New York, NY: Monacelli Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Several students involved in Judy Chicago’s teaching projects established successful careers as artists, including [[Suzanne Lacy]], [[Faith Wilding]], and [[Nancy Youdelman]].

In the early 2000s, Chicago organized her teaching style into three parts preparation, process, and art-making.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Each has a specific purpose and is crucial. During the preparation phase, students identify a deep personal concern and then research that issue. In the process phase, students gather together in a group to discuss the materials they plan on using and the content of their work. Finally, in the art-making phase, students find materials, sketch, critique, and produce art.

The '''Leningrad Codex''' (Latin: ''Codex Leningradensis'', the "[[codex]] of [[Leningrad]]") is the oldest ''complete'' manuscript of the [[Hebrew Bible]] in Hebrew, using the [[Masoretic Text]] and [[Tiberian vocalization]].&lt;ref&gt;There are older manuscripts of translations into other languages, such as the [[Codex Amiatinus]] in Latin.&lt;/ref&gt; It is dated 1008 CE (or possibly 1009) according to its [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]].&lt;ref&gt;Foreword by Gérard E. Weil to ''[[Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia]]'', 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Aleppo Codex]], against which the Leningrad Codex was corrected, is several decades older, but parts of it have been missing since 1947, making the Leningrad Codex the oldest complete codex of the Tiberian mesorah that has survived intact to this day.

In modern times, the Leningrad Codex is significant as the Hebrew text reproduced in ''[[Biblia Hebraica (Kittel)|Biblia Hebraica]]'' (1937) and ''[[Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia]]'' (1977). It also serves as a primary source for the recovery of details in the missing parts of the Aleppo Codex.

==Name==
The Leningrad Codex (a codex is a handwritten book as opposed to a [[scroll]]) is so named because it has been housed at the [[National Library of Russia]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] since 1863. In 1924, after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], Petrograd (formerly Saint Petersburg) was renamed Leningrad, and, because the codex was used as the basic text for the Biblia Hebraica since 1937, it became internationally known as the "Leningrad Codex". Although in 1991, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the city's original name was restored to St Petersburg, the National Library of Russia requested that "Leningrad" be retained in the name of the codex. Nonetheless, the Codex is occasionally referred to as the Codex Petersburgensis or Petropolitanus, or the St. Petersburg Codex. This is ambiguous as, since 1876, these appellations refer to a different biblical codex (MS. Heb B 3) which is even older (916 CE), but contains only the later Prophets.

==Contents==
The biblical text as found in the codex contains the Hebrew letter-text along with Tiberian [[niqqud|vowels]] and [[cantillation]] signs. In addition, there are [[masoretic notes]] in the margins. There are also various technical supplements dealing with textual and linguistic details, many of which are painted in geometrical forms. The codex is written on parchment and bound in leather.

The Leningrad Codex, in extraordinarily pristine condition after a millennium, also provides an example of medieval Jewish art. Sixteen of the pages contain decorative geometric patterns that illuminate passages from the text. The [[carpet page]] shows a star with the names of the scribes on the edges and a blessing written in the middle.

The order of the books in the Leningrad Codex follows the Tiberian textual tradition, which is also that of the later tradition of [[Sephardic]] biblical manuscripts. This order for the books differs markedly from that of most printed Hebrew bibles for the books of the [[Ketuvim]]. In the Leningrad Codex, the order of the Ketuvim is: Chronicles, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ruth, Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, Lamentations, Esther, Daniel, Ezra-Nehemiah. The full order of the books is given below.

==History==
[[File:LeningradCodex text.jpg|thumb|Leningrad Codex text sample, portions of Exodus 15:21-16:3]]

According to its [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]], the [[codex]] was copied in [[Cairo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stuhlman|first1=Daniel D.|title=The Leningrad Codex|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~ddstuhlman/crc10.htm|publisher=Librarian's Lobby|accessdate=13 October 2014|date=1 March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; from manuscripts written by [[Aaron ben Moses ben Asher]]. It has been claimed to be a product of the Asher scriptorium itself; however, there is no evidence that Asher ever saw it. Unusual for a masoretic codex, the same man (Samuel ben Jacob) wrote the consonants, the vowels and the Masoretic notes. In its vocalization system (vowel points and [[cantillation]]) it is considered by scholars to be the most faithful representative of ben Asher's tradition apart from the Aleppo Codex (edited by ben Asher himself). Its letter-text is not superb, however, and contradicts its own masoretic apparatus in many hundreds of places.&lt;ref&gt;On the vocalization and letter-text of the Leningrad Codex see Israel Yeivin, ''The Aleppo Codex of the Bible: A Study of its Vocalization and Accentuation (Jerusalem: Magnes, 1968) pp. 357-359 (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous alterations and erasures, and it was suggested by [[Moshe Goshen-Gottstein]] that an existing text not following Asher's rules was heavily amended so as to make it conform to these rules.

The codex is now preserved in the [[National Library of Russia]], accessioned as "Firkovich B 19 A". Its former owner, the [[Crimean Karaite]] collector [[Abraham Firkovich]], left no indication in his writings where he had acquired the codex, which was taken to Odessa in 1838 and later transferred to the Imperial Library in St Petersburg.

==Modern editions==
===Biblia Hebraica===
In 1935, the Leningrad Codex was lent to the Old Testament Seminar of the University of Leipzig for two years while [[Paul E. Kahle]] supervised its transcription for the Hebrew text of the third edition of ''[[Biblia Hebraica (Kittel)|Biblia Hebraica]]'' (BHK), published in Stuttgart, 1937. The codex was also used for ''[[Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia]]'' (BHS) in 1977, and is being used for [[Biblia Hebraica Quinta]] (BHQ).

As an original work by Tiberian masoretes, the Leningrad Codex was older by several centuries than the other Hebrew manuscripts which had been used for all previous editions of printed Hebrew bibles until [[Biblia Hebraica (disambiguation)|Biblia Hebraica]].

The Westminster Leningrad Codex is an online digital version of the Leningrad Codex maintained by the J. Alan Groves Center for Advanced Biblical Research at the [[Westminster Theological Seminary]]. This is a verified version of the Michigan-Claremont text, transcribed from BHS at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1981-1982 under the direction of H. Van Dyke Parunak (of the University of Michigan) and Richard E. Whitaker (of the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity, Claremont Graduate University) with funding from the Packard Foundation and the University of Michigan,&lt;ref&gt;Introductory notes to the Bibleworks WTT text, www.bibleworks.com&lt;/ref&gt; with further proofreading and corrections. The online version includes transcription notes and tools for analyzing syntax.

===Jewish editions===
The Leningrad Codex also served as the basis for two important modern Jewish editions of the Hebrew Bible ([[Tanakh]]):
*The [[Aron Dotan|Dotan]] edition, which was distributed to soldiers in mass quantities as the official [[Tanakh]] of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] throughout the 1990s.
*The [[New Jewish Publication Society of America Version|''JPS Hebrew-English Tanakh'']] (Philadelphia, 1999) and the various volumes of the JPS Torah Commentary and JPS Bible Commentary.

For minute masoretic details, however, Israeli and Jewish scholars have shown a marked preference for modern Hebrew editions based upon the Aleppo Codex. These editions use the Leningrad Codex as the most important source (but not the only one) for the reconstruction of parts of the Aleppo Codex that have been missing since 1947.

The following is a list of current [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] religious institutes. Most are [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], however [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic]] institutes are included.

The list given here includes not only examples of pontifical-right institutes but also some that are only of [[Diocese|diocesan]] right. It includes even some [[association of the faithful|associations]] formed with a view to ''becoming'' religious institutes but not yet canonically erected even on the diocesan level.

The list does not distinguish between institutes that historically would be classified either as "[[Catholic religious order|orders]]" or as "[[Congregation (Catholic)#Type of religious institute|congregations]]".

Institutes are listed alphabetically by their ''common'' names, not their ''official'' ones. For example, the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], officially called the Society of Jesus, would be listed under 'J' rather than under 'S.' If an institute's official name is used more often than a nickname, it will be listed as such.

[[File:Diablefaucheur.jpg|right|thumbnail|''The Mowing Devil'' pamphlet.]]
'''''The Mowing-Devil: or, Strange News out of Hartford-shire''''' is the title of an English [[woodcut]] [[pamphlet]] published in 1678. The pamphlet tells of a farmer in [[Hertfordshire]] who, refusing to pay the price demanded by a labourer to mow his field, swore he would rather the [[Devil]] mowed it instead.

According to the pamphlet, that night his field appeared to be in flame. The next morning, the field was found to be perfectly mowed, "that no mortal man was able to do the like".

This pamphlet, and the accompanying illustration, is often cited by crop circle researchers as among the first recorded cases of  [[crop circles]].&lt;ref name="Aug2009_Cosmosmagazine_MowingDevil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/node/3114/full|title=Grand delusions|last=Monaghan|first=Lauren|date=August 2009|publisher=[[Cosmos (magazine)|Cosmos]]|accessdate=18 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Crop circle researcher Jim Schnabel does not consider it to be a historical precedent because it describes the stalks as being cut, while modern crop circles involve the corn being bent.&lt;ref name=dutch&gt;{{cite book |title= Reframing Dutch Culture: Between Otherness and Authenticity |series= Progress in European Ethnology |author1= Peter Jan Margry |author2= Herman Roodenburg |edition= illustrated |publisher= [[Ashgate Publishing]] |year= 2007 |pages= 150–1 |isbn= 9780754647058 |ref= {{harvid|Margry &amp; Roodenburg|2007}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Musalla complex''' (also called Musallah Complex, Musalla of Gawhar Shad) is a large former Islamic religious complex located in Herat city in western Afghanistan. The 15th century complex is in ruins today. The complex ruins consist of the five huge 55 metre (180 feet) [[Musalla Minarets of Herat|Musallah Minarets of Herat]], mausoleums of Mir Ali Sher Navai, Hussein Baiqara and the ruins of a large [[mosque]] and Islamic [[madrasa]] school buildings. The complex was begun in 1417 by Queen [[Goharshad Begum]], the wife of Timurid ruler [[Shah Rukh]] who established Herat as the capital of the [[Timurid Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[[ArchNet]], Masjid-i Jami'-i Gawhar Shad, Herat, Afghanistan, https://archnet.org/sites/3935/media_contents/40280&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
It is thought that a madrasa was built in 1417 and a mosque was then built in 1426.&lt;ref&gt;[[ArchNet]], Masjid-i Jami'-i Gawhar Shad, Herat, Afghanistan, https://archnet.org/sites/3935/media_contents/40280&lt;/ref&gt; Sultan Husain's Madrasa was most likely built around 1493 (898 A.H.). The site contains examples of Timurid architecture although it has been heavily damaged, first by artillery fire in 1863, then during the [[Panjdeh incident]] of 1885 when most of the ruins were razed in an attempt to prevent its use as a base by the invading Russian army. Finally, an earthquake in 1932 destroyed two of the mosque's four minarets.&lt;ref&gt;[[ArchNet]], Masjid-i Jami'-i Gawhar Shad, Herat, Afghanistan, https://archnet.org/sites/3935/media_contents/40280&lt;/ref&gt;

The site rose to the attention of Europeans when it was visited and photographed in the 1930s by the travel writers [[Robert Byron]] and [[Annemarie Schwarzenbach]]. Byron's book, [[The Road to Oxiana]] mentions the minarets and discusses Timurid history.

== Preservation ==
Some emergency preservation work was carried out at the site in 2001 which included building protective walls around the Gawhar Shad Mausoleum and Sultan Husain Madrasa, repairing the remaining minaret of Gawhar Shad's Madrasa, and replanting the mausoleum garden.&lt;ref&gt;[[ArchNet]], Masjid-i Jami'-i Gawhar Shad, Herat, Afghanistan, https://archnet.org/sites/3935/media_contents/40280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://archnet.org/sites/3935/media_contents/40280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.touristspots.org/mousallah-complex-in-herat-afghanistan/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1059997.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adventuretravelphotos.com/?Action=_VC&amp;id=77029&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Chinese folk religion}}
'''Northeast China folk religion'''{{refn|group=note|The general description in [[Chinese language]] is 東北民間宗教 ''Dōngběi mínjiān zōngjiào'' or 東北民間信仰 ''Dōngběi mínjiān xìnyǎng''.}} is the variety of [[Chinese folk religion]] of [[northeast China]], characterised by distinctive cults original to [[Hebei]] and [[Shandong]], transplanted and adapted by the [[Han Chinese]] settlers of [[Liaoning]], [[Jilin]] and [[Heilongjiang]] (the three provinces comprising [[Manchuria]]) since the [[Qing dynasty]].{{sfnb|Deng|2014|p=19}} It is characterised by terminology, deities and practices that are different from those of central and southern Chinese folk religion. Many of these patterns derive from the interaction of Han religion with [[Manchu shamanism]].{{sfnb|Liu|2007}}

Prominence is given to the worship of [[animal worship|zoomorphic deities]], of a "[[totemism|totemic]]" significance.{{sfnb|Deng|2014|p=1}}{{sfnb|Liu|2007}} In the region the terms ''[[shen (Chinese religion)|shen]]'' 神 ("god") and ''[[xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' 仙 ("immortal being") are synonymous. Figures of ritual specialists or [[shamans]]{{refn|group=note|Shamans are variously called:
* Simply ''dìzǐ'' 弟子, "disciples (of the gods)";{{sfnb|Deng|2014|p=1}}
* ''Dàxiān er'' 大仙兒, "children of the great gods";
* ''Tiào dàshén'' 跳大神, "dancers of the great gods".{{sfnb|Liu|2007}}}} perform various [[ritual]] functions for groups of believers and local communities, including ''chūmǎxiān'' (出馬仙 "riding for the immortals"),{{sfnb|Deng|2014|p=17}} dances, [[healing]], [[exorcism]], [[divination]], and communication with [[ancestor]]s.{{sfnb|Deng|2014|p=2}}

==History==
[[File:Roadside shrine in Manchuria.jpg|thumb|A roadside shrine in Manchuria. (1888)]]
The formation of northeast China's folk religion and shamanism can be traced back to the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644-1911), when a large number of [[Han Chinese]] settled in the northeast of China mixing with [[Manchu people|Manchus]].{{sfnb|Deng|2014|p=45}} Either in the Qing period, and in the later [[Republic of China (1912-1949)]] and subsequent People's Republic, the worship of zoomorphic deities and the practice of ''chumaxian'' had bad relationship with the governments,{{sfnb|Deng|2014|pp=45-46}} which considered it "feudal superstition" (封建迷信 ''fēngjiàn míxìn''){{sfnb|Deng|2014|p=3}} and banned through different decrees.{{sfnb|Deng|2014|pp=46-49}}

The popular worship of animal gods began to resurface in the 1980s, and soon also the ''chumaxian'' practice was revived.{{sfnb|Deng|2014|pp=50-51}} In the 2010s there have been attempts to protect ''chumaxian'' under the policy of "intangible cultural heritage".{{sfnb|Deng|2014|p=52}}

===Japanese scholarship and Shinto similarities===
[[Image:---File---蒙疆神社.JPG|thumb|Shinto shrine in [[Zhangjiakou]], [[Hebei]], [[China]], in the 1950s, when it was already abandoned. The shrine was founded by the Japanese during World War II, and incorporated Mongol Genghis Khan worship.]]
The study of northeast China's folk religion owes much to the scholarly enterprise that the [[Japanese people|Japanese]] conducted on the subject during the period of ''[[Manchukuo]]'' (1932–1945) that they established after they [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|occupied Manchuria]].{{sfnb|DuBois|2006|p=53}} Unlike [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese-occupied Korea]] and [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|occupied Taiwan]], Manchuria was conceived as an autonomous nation, not to be assimilated into [[Japan]], but rather to be modeled after the latter's social and religious structure keeping an independent identity.{{sfnb|DuBois|2006|pp=56-57}}

Ōmachi Tokuzo (1909-1970), a pupil of Yanagita Kunio (the founder of academic ethnography in Japan), conducted field research on local religion in Manchuria through the war years.{{sfnb|DuBois|2006|p=59}} He later acted as the head of the Society for the Study of Manchurian Customs, producing an impressive body of research on local religion in Manchuria and north China.{{sfnb|DuBois|2006|p=61}} Ōmachi identified the rural village, each with a [[Tudishen]] shrine, as the fundamental unit of northeast China's local religion and of the religious character of the [[Han Chinese]] race.{{sfnb|DuBois|2006|pp=62-63}} He also studies local Chinese goddess worship and the great similarity and integration of the Han and the Manchus.{{sfnb|DuBois|2006|pp=63-64}} Ōmachi does not appear to have supported the institution of [[Shinto shrines]] in Manchurian villages, which in Korea and Taiwan were intended for the spiritual transformation of the locals into Japanese citizens by their integration into Shinto communities.{{sfnb|DuBois|2006|p=64}}

Another scholar, Tokunaga Takeshi, sought to demonstrate the spiritual unity of Japan, Manchuria and China by highlighting the similarities between ancient religious structures of the three nations:{{sfnb|DuBois|2006|p=65}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;Japanese ancient shrines are of the ''kannabi'' (popularly known as [[Mt. Fuji]]-style) shape. There are many of these in Manchuria, as well ... [The artifacts] develop from the same agrarian culture and philosophy as Japanese Shinto (''kannagara no michi'') ... Modern [Chinese] matron temples have these elements, as well. Therefore, since the temples were built later, it is thought that matron worship was grafted onto this earlier pattern of belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Okumura|first=Yoshinobu|title=Manshu nyannyan ko|trans-title=Study of Niangniang Temples in Manchuria|location=Shinkyo (Changchun)|year=1940|pages=242–245}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other scholars studied the similarities between local and Japanese shamanisms.{{sfnb|DuBois|2006|p=65}} The ''Manchukuo'' generally promoted a racially centered spiritual revival, that is an [[ethnic religion]] for each of the races inhabiting Manchuria.{{sfnb|DuBois|2006|p=68}} For example, under the suggestions of Ogasawara Shozo that the [[Mongols in China|Mongols]] "need(ed) a new religion, specifically a new god" they promoted the worship of [[Genghis Khan]] that continues today in northern China. The Shinto shrine of Kalgan (now [[Zhangjiakou]], [[Hebei]]) incorporated Genghis Khan worship and was opened to local Mongols.{{sfnb|DuBois|2006|p=69}}

==Characteristics==
[[File:万福鼎.JPG|thumb|"Myriad Prosperities' Cauldron" (万福鼎 ''Wànfú Dǐng''), with the name of the [[Sanxing (deities)|"Prosperity God" or "Fortune God"]] (福星 ''Fúxīng'') inscribed ten thousand times, in [[Jinzhou]], [[Dalian]], Liaoning.]]

===Deities===
{{Main|Wudaxian}}
Besides common Chinese deities such as ''[[Guan Yu|Guāndì]]'' (关帝 "''[[Divus]]'' Guan", the god of war),{{sfnb|Kang|2006|p=49}} people of north China and Manchuria have distinctive [[animal worship|zoomorphic deities]],{{sfnb|Deng|2014|p=22}} and the [[Chinese mother goddess worship|worship of clusters of goddesses]] is popular. The gods are ordained in hierarchies, a pattern inherited from the Chinese [[Confucianism|Confucian]] lineage system.{{sfnb|Deng|2014|p=22}} [[Fox spirit|Fox deities]] have a very important position,{{sfnb|Deng|2014|p=21}} with evident parallels in the [[Japan]]ese cult of [[Inari Ōkami]].{{sfnb|Kang|2006|pp=199-200}} Usually at the head of the pantheon are placed the "Great Lord of the Three Foxes" (胡三太爷 ''Húsān Tàiyé'') and the "Great Lady of the Three Foxes" (胡三太奶 ''Húsān Tàinǎi'').{{sfnb|Deng|2014|p=75}}

The Five Great Immortals (五大仙 ''Wǔdàxiān'') are deities who reproduce [[cosmology|cosmological]] structures of common [[Chinese theology]]. The cult generally includes: ① ''[[Huxian|Húxiān]]'' (狐仙=胡仙 "Fox Immortal") or ''Húshén'' (狐神 "Fox God"), the most important deity in northeast China;{{sfnb|Kang|2006|pp=45-50}} ② ''Huángxiān'' (黃仙 literally "Yellow Immortal") the Weasel God, who holds the position of the [[Yellow Deity]] of Chinese theology; ③ ''Shéxiān'' (蛇仙 literally "Snake Immortal"), also called ''Liǔxiān'' (柳仙 "Immortal Liu") or ''Mǎngxiān'' (蟒仙 "Python (or Boa) Immortal"), who can represent the [[Dragon God]], [[Fuxi]] and [[Nüwa]]; ④ ''Báixiān'' (白仙 "White Immortal") is the Hedgehog God; and ⑤ ''Hēixiān'' (黑仙 "Black Immortal") who can be the ''Wūyāxiān'' (乌鸦仙 "Crow Immortal") or the ''Huīxiān'' (灰仙 "Rat Immortal").

While the Fox God and the Weasel God always remain the two prominent members of the cult of the zoomorphic deities, the other positions vary in some regions including the Tiger, the Wolf, the Hare and the Turtle Gods.{{sfnb|Kang|2006|p=48}} Other areas host the worship of the Leopard, the Mole, the Toad and the Rabbit Gods.{{sfnb|Liu|2007}} In certain counties of [[Hebei]] they are reduced to four (四大仙 ''Sìdàxiān'') including the Fox, the Weasel, the Hedgehog and the Snake Gods.{{sfnb|Kang|2006|p=48}}

Common Chinese deities are associated to the cult of the zoomorphic gods. For instance, ''[[Huáng Dàxiān]]'' (黄大仙 "Great Yellow Immortal") is popular in north and northeast China, although he has no relation to [[Taoism]] as in southeastern China,{{sfnb|Wang|2013}} and is rather identified as the Weasel God.

Local terminology distinguishes the animal gods as the middle way between the ''shàngfáng shénxiān'' (上房神仙 "everlasting gods") gods of the greater [[cosmos]] important in Taoism, that are only worshipped and do not take possession of shamans; and the ''yīnxiān'' (陰仙 "underworld gods"), deceased beings who became gods through self-cultivation ([[ancestor]]s and [[progenitor]]s).{{sfnb|Deng|2014|p=29}} In northeastern Taoism, besides the Fox Gods, the pantheon is headed by a goddess, the "Black Mother" (黑媽媽 ''Hēi māmā'').

===Shamanism===
Northeastern shamans consider themselves to be "disciples" (''dìzǐ'' 弟子) of the gods rather than mere channels of communication between the gods and the human world.{{sfnb|Deng|2014|p=2}} Another name used to refer to these ritual masters is ''xiāngtóu'' (香頭 "incense heads").{{sfnb|Li|2011}} Their practice is generally called ''chumaxian'' (出马仙), which means "the gods who take action" or more literally "riding for the immortals", a definition which implies that the gods and their disciples act as an organic whole, and in their action, form and content they express themselves together.{{sfnb|Deng|2014|p=3}}

There are two types of possession that the northeastern shamans experience in terms of consciousness: ''quánméng'' (全蒙 "complete unconsciousness", in which the disciple is not aware of what happens and what the god says) and ''bànméng'' (半蒙 "semi-unconsciousness", in which the disciple is aware of what happens during the possession).{{sfnb|Deng|2014|p=32}}

They also practise a communication with ancestors through an [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstatic]] experience called ''guòyīn'' (过阴 "passing to the underworld").{{sfnb|Deng|2014|p=8}} This is part of the practices of both ''chumaxian'' and related communal rites of broader Chinese local religion.{{sfnb|Deng|2014|p=8}}

Northeastern [[Chinese shamanism]] shares similarities with southern Chinese mediumship (''[[tongji (spirit medium)|jitong]]''), Japanese [[Shinto]] practices, and various other shamanisms in the region ([[Tungusic peoples|Tungus]] and [[Manchu shamanism]], [[Mongolian shamanism]], [[Korean shamanism]], broader [[Siberian shamanism]]).{{sfnb|Deng|2014|p=13}} Historically it is the result of the encounter of [[Han Chinese]] and [[Manchu people|Manchu]] cultures, especially the Han cult of the fox{{sfnb|Kang|2006}}{{sfnb|Huntington|2013}} and Manchu "wild ritual" (''wuwate'', Chinese: ''yějì'' 野祭).{{sfnb|Deng|2014|pp=13-18}}

Northeastern Chinese shamans are predominantly women, like the shamans of Northeast Asian shamanism, while southern Chinese mediums are almost exclusively men.{{sfnb|Deng|2014|p=13}} Moreover, while northeastern shamans are usually independent from formal religious institutions, southern medium specialists often collaborate with [[Taoist priest]]s.{{sfnb|Deng|2014|p=13}} Another distinction is that while southern mediums can acquire their role through training, and they are possessed mostly by Taoist and strictly Chinese gods, northeastern shamans are "chosen" or "ordained" by gods themselves (through ''mo'', "sickness"){{sfnb|Deng|2014|p=23}} as in other shamanic traditions, and their gods are animal totems.{{sfnb|Deng|2014|p=14}} When a future disciple is chosen, she experiences ''mo'' ("sickness").{{sfnb|Deng|2014|p=23}}

===Places of worship and shaman halls===
In northeast China terminology for religious places and groups may follow the [[Chinese temple|common Chinese model]], with ''miao'' (庙) defining any "sacred precinct" dedicated to a god. However, a different terminology exists and temples may be called ''xiāntáng'' (仙堂 "hall of the immortals"){{sfnb|Deng|2014|p=2}} or ''tángzi'' (堂子), the latter name inherited from the temples of the ''bolongzi'' (Chinese: ''jiājì'' 家祭, "ancestral ritual") of Manchu shamanism.{{sfnb|Deng|2014|p=20}} Shamans also hold "immediate halls" of worship (''lìtáng'' 立堂) in their houses.{{sfnb|Deng|2014|p=27}}

===Folk religious sects===
[[File:Shanrendao.svg|thumb|100px|Coloured symbol of Shanrendao theory.]]
Since [[Chinese Buddhism]] and professional [[Taoism]] were never well developed in northeast China, the religious life of the region has been heavily influenced by networks of [[Chinese salvationist religions|folk salvationist sects]] and [[Confucian churches]], characterised by a congregational structure and a scriptural core.{{sfnb|DuBois|2006|p=70}} During the Japanese occupation they weren't studied, but their role as a moral catalyser for the Han race was emphasised.{{sfnb|DuBois|2006|p=72}}

The [[Yiguandao]] (一貫道 "Consistent Way") had a strong presence in the area,{{sfnb|DuBois|2006|p=72}} but were especially the [[Guiyidao]] (皈依道 "Way of the Return to the One") and the [[Shanrendao]] (善人道 "Way of the Virtuous Man", which social body was known as the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue) to have millions of followers in Manchuria alone.{{sfnb|Ownby|2008|ps=. § 23: "... the Daodehui eight million in Manchukuo alone (a quarter of the total population) in 1936-1937."}} Shanrendao remains widespread even after the Maoist period and the [[Cultural Revolution]], and headquarters of the Church of the Way and its Virtue have been re-established in [[Beijing]] in the 2010s. In more recent decades northeast China has also seen the rise of the [[Falun Gong]], which was founded in the 1990s in [[Jilin]].

During the period of ''Manchukuo'' also many [[Japanese new religions]], or independent [[Shinto sects and schools|Shinto sects]], proselytised in Manchuria establishing hundreds of congregations. Most of the missions belonged to the [[Omoto teaching]], the [[Tenri teaching]] and the [[Konko teaching]] of Shinto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stalker|first=Nancy K.|year=2008|title=Prophet Motive: Deguchi Onisaburō, Oomoto, and the Rise of New Religions in Imperial Japan|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9IcxT_DsxN4C|isbn=0824832264|ref=harv}} p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; The Omoto teaching is the Japanese near equivalent of Guiyidao, as the two religions have common roots and history.

A '''priest in charge''' or '''priest-in-charge''' (previously also '''curate-in-charge''') in the [[Church of England]] is a [[priest]] in charge of a [[parish]] who is not its [[Incumbent (ecclesiastical)#The temporalities|incumbent]]. Such priests are not legally responsible for the [[church (building)|church]]es and [[glebe]], but simply hold a licence rather than the [[Fee simple|freehold]] and are not appointed by [[advowson]].

The appointment of priests in charge rather than [[incumbent (ecclesiastical)|incumbents]] (one who does receive the temporalities of an incumbent) is sometimes done when parish reorganisation is taking place or to give the [[bishop]] greater control over the deployment of [[clergy]].

Legally, priests in charge are ''[[curate|temporary curates]]'', as they have only spiritual responsibilities. Even though they lead the ministry in their parishes, their legal status is little different from assistant curates. However, the term ''priest in charge'' has come to be used because the term ''curate'' often refers to an ''assistant curate'', who is usually a priest recently ordained who is not in charge of a parish — although it is quite possible for a priest previously beneficed to return to a curacy, sometimes as a matter of choice. The [[stipend]] of a priest in charge is often the equivalent to that of an incumbent, and so they are sometimes referred to as having ''incumbent status''.

Incumbents include [[Vicar (Anglicanism)|vicar]]s and [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]]s.

In the [[Church of Ireland]], priests in charge are referred to as ''bishop's curates''.

[[File:RassLeelabyBenchu.jpg| thumb|300px| Rass Lila by Krishna, in [[Prem Mandir Vrindavan]]]]
[[File:Krishna and Radha dancing the Rasalila, Jaipur, 19th century.jpg|thumb|[[Krishna]] and [[Radha]] dancing the Rasalila, a 19th-century painting, Rajasthan]]

The '''Rass lila''' ([[IAST]] ''{{IAST|rāsa-līlā}}'') ({{lang-hi|रास लीला}}) or '''Rass dance''' is part of the traditional story of [[Krishna]] described in Hindu scriptures such as the [[Bhagavata Purana]] and literature such as the [[Gita Govinda]], where he dances with [[Radha]] and her [[Gopi|sakhis]]. The [[Indian classical dance]] of [[Kathak]] evolved from the 'Raslila of [[Braj]] and Manipuri Classical Dance' ([[Vrindavan|Vrindavana]]) also known as ''Natwari Nritya'', which was revived in 1960s by the Kathak dancer, [[Uma Sharma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Indian theatre: traditions of performance|last=Richmond |first=Farley P. |authorlink= |author2=Darius L. Swann|author3=Phillip B. Zarrilli|year=1993 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=81-208-0981-5|page=197 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3HIh7oPkvAMC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=Uma+Sharma&amp;lr=&amp;cd=12#v=onepage&amp;q=Uma%20Sharma&amp;f=false |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term, ''[[Rasa (aesthetics)|rasa]]'' meaning "aesthetics" and ''[[lila (Hinduism)|lila]]'' meaning "act," "play" or "dance" is a concept from [[Hinduism]], which roughly translates to "play (lila) of aesthetics (rasa)," or more broadly as '''"Dance of Divine Love".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | author = Schweig, G.M.

 | title = Dance of divine love: The Rasa Lila of Krishna from the Bhagavata Purana, India's classic sacred love story.
 | publisher = Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Oxford
 | isbn = 0-691-11446-3
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rasa lila takes place one night when the [[Gopi]]s of [[Vrindavan|Vrindavana]], upon hearing the sound of Krishna's [[Bansuri|flute]], sneak away from their households and families to the forest to dance with Krishna throughout the night, which Krishna supernaturally stretches to the length of one [[Kalpa (aeon)|Night of Brahma]], a [[Hindu Cycle Of The Universe|Hindu unit of time]] lasting approximately 4.32 billion years. In the Krishna [[Bhakti]] traditions, the rasa-lila is considered to be one of the highest and most esoteric of Krishna's pastimes. In these traditions, romantic love between human beings in the [[Maya (illusion)#Maya in Hindu philosophy|material world]] is seen as merely a diminished, illusionary reflection of the soul’s original, ecstatic spiritual love for Krishna, God, in the [[goloka|spiritual world]].

In the Bhagavata Purana it is stated that whoever faithfully hears or describes the Rasa lila attains Krishna's ''pure loving devotion'' ([[Suddha-bhakti]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://vedabase.net/sb/10/33/39/en2 Bhag-P 10.33.39] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618004341/http://vedabase.net/sb/10/33/39/en2 |date=2008-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as a child plays at its own will with its reflection in a mirror, even so with the help of His Yogamāyā Bhagavān Śrī Kṛṣṇa  sported with the Gopīs, who were like many shadows of His own form.&lt;ref name="golove"&gt;{{cite book | title=Gopīs' Love for Śrī Kṛṣṇa| last=Hanumanprasad| first=Poddar| year=1941| publisher=Gita Press| location=Gorakhpur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Apart from the definition above, the term also comes from the Sanskrit words ''[[wikt:rasa|rasa]]'' and ''[[wikt:lila|lila]]'', with '''''rasa'' meaning “juice”, “nectar”, "emotion" or "sweet taste" and ''lila'' meaning "act"'''.By taking this etymologic breakdown of the word literally, "Rasa Lila" means the “sweet act” (of [[Krishna]]). It is often freely rendered as "the dance of love".

==Performance==
Rasa lila has been a popular theme in [[Kathak]], [[Bharatanatyam]], [[Odissi]], [[Meitei people|Meitei]], and [[Kuchipudi]] items. Rasa Lila is a popular form of folk theatre in the regions of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], [[Vrindavan|Vrindavana]] in [[Uttar Pradesh]], especially during the festivals of
[[Krishna Janmashtami]] and [[Holi]], and amongst various followers of [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]] in the region. Raas Leela (Raax Mahotsav)  is also observed as one of the State Festivals of [[Assam]] which usually is celebrated during Late November or Early December. During Raas Mahotsava, several thousand devotees visit the holy temples and [[Xatra]]s of Assam every year. The Raas Mahotsav of Majuli, Nalbari and Of Howly deserve a special mention in this regard.

[[File:Rasa Lila in Manipuri dance style.jpg|right|350px|thumb|''Rasa Lila'' in Manipuri classical Indian dance style]]
In the tradition of [[Vaishnavism of Manipur]] ''Rasa Lila'' is depicted within [[Manipuri dance|Manipuri classical Indian dance]], and revolves around the same story of the love between Krishna and the cowherd girls and tells the divine love story of Krishna, [[svayam bhagavan]] and [[Radha]], his divine beloved. This form of dance was started by [[Bhagya Chandra]] in 1779 and in some parts of India is still performed every year on [[Krishna Janmashtami]] (the festival to celebrate Krishna's ''birthday''). According to different traditions, the rasa-lila is performed either by boys and girls, or by girls only. The dance is performed holding ''dandi'' (sticks) and is often accompanied with folk songs and [[Bhajan|devotional music]].

The Traditional Rasa Lila performances in Vrindavan are famous throughout the Vaisnava world as an experience of the spiritual world. Rasa Lila performance was started by Swami Sri Uddhavaghamanda Devacharya in the early 15th Century CE at Vamshivata in Vrindavan, [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]]. He was a prominent saint of the [[Nimbarka Sampradaya]], and disciple of the world-renowned Swami Sri Harivyasa Devacarya. The Vani literature of Vraja is the transcription of the songs that were heard by Swami Harivyasa Devacarya and his Guru, Swami Shri Shribhatta as they meditated on the Nitya Lila of Shri [[Radha]] [[Krishna]]. These songs describe the eternal spiritual abode of Shri [[Radha]] [[Krishna]], the Sakhis and Nitya Vrindavana Dham - or Nikunja Dham.

As many new devotees of that time could not understand the Vraja language, Swami Uddavaghamanda Devacarya trained his [[Brahmacharya|Brahmachari]] students to play the parts that appeared in the songs in order to get a visual representation of the Lila that was being described. Many were sceptical of this, and attempted to thwart the first enactment. However, at the conclusion of the first Rasa Lila, tradition has it, the Lord Himself appeared and gave the actors his own Crown, and decreed that whenever a qualified actor was to take the part of the Lord, from the moment he put on the crown on his head, it should be understood that he represents the Lila potency of God, and treated with due respect. Shri Radha and Krsna shall be known as Shri Radha Rasavihari.

Since then, the traditional form has remained that actors who are young Brahmacharis will join a group led by the Swami of that group. The music remains the typical [[Dhrupad]]a style of the Vraja Acharyas who penned the songs they heard to the accompaniment of [[Sitar]] and [[Pakhavaj|Pakhawaj]] and the songs are sung in Vraja Language, a parent to modern [[Hindi]].

Recently, many people have changed the traditional music to popular music. Yet there are a dedicated few who seek to preserve the traditional form of devotional art known as Rasa Lila.

[[Botswana]] is a Christian majority nation, and allows freedom of religious practice.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; A country of an estimated 2.26 million people in 2015,&lt;ref name="World Bank Group 2016"&gt;{{cite web | title=Botswana | website=World Bank Group | date=2016-09-19 | url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/botswana | author = World Bank Group | accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christianity arrived in Botswana in mid 1870s, with the colonial rule. The conversion process was relatively quick than neighboring southern African countries, because regional hereditary tribal chiefs locally called ''[[Kgosi|Dikgosi]]'' converted to Christianity, which triggered the entire group they led to convert as well.&lt;ref name="SwartzTaylor2013p67"/&gt; The ''Dikgosi'' converted in the belief that the Christian missionaries would help them source guns to resist Afrikaner trekkers from south as well help resist imperialist white foreigners.&lt;ref name="SwartzTaylor2013p67"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sharlene Swartz|author2=Monica Taylor|title=Moral Education in Sub-Saharan Africa: Culture, Economics, Conflict and AIDS|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xcbhAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-98249-4|pages=67–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars place the initial contacts between Christian missionaries and Bechuanaland (old name of Botswana) a few decades earlier.&lt;ref name="Shillington163"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin Shillington|title=Encyclopedia of African History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=umyHqvAErOAC&amp;pg=PA163 |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-45670-2|pages=163–164, 129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the arrival of Christianity in Botswana, the missionaries established Bible schools and attempted to end old practices such as ''Bogwera'' (the tribe's traditional initiation ceremony into manhood) and ''Bojale'' (a girl's initiation ceremony into womanhood after she reached puberty), both of which were traditionally linked to the social acceptance of someone readiness to marry as well the right to inherit property. These practices continued to be in vogue in private, despite missionary efforts to end them.&lt;ref name="SwartzTaylor2013p67"/&gt; The Christian missionaries, particularly the [[London Missionary Society]], was politically involved as interpreters between the tribal chiefs and the colonial administrators.&lt;ref name="Bongmba2015p389"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elias Kifon Bongmba|title=Routledge Companion to Christianity in Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9pZACwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA389|year=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-50577-7|pages=389–390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Location Botswana AU Africa.svg|thumb|left|160px|Botswana.]]
After Botswana gained independence in 1966 from the colonial rule, senior Christian mission officials and [[Reverend]]s served as the first Speaker of the National Assembly and as officials in the new government.&lt;ref name="Bongmba2015p389"/&gt; In 1970s, its new leaders reviewed the Christian colonial curriculum in schools, revised it in order to restore traditional values based on pre-Christian religious ideas, such as ''Kagisanyo'' and ''Botho'', respectively harmony and humanism.&lt;ref name="SwartzTaylor2013p67"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shillington163"/&gt; Bogwera and Bojale were re-introduced.&lt;ref name="SwartzTaylor2013p67"/&gt; The new leaders also adopted a policy of religious tolerance and freedom, an approach towards religion in Botswana that continues in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; However, the school curriculum remains largely as before with Christian terminology and ideologies.&lt;ref name="SwartzTaylor2013p67"/&gt;

An estimated 70 percent of Botswana citizens in 2001 identified themselves as [[Christians]].&lt;ref name=report&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90083.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007: Botswana]. United States [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor]] (September 14, 2007). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, a Botswana government published report listed 63 percent of its citizens were Christians of various denominations, about 27 percent said their religion as “God,” about 8 percent claimed to have no religion, 2 percent were adherents of the traditional indigenous religion Badimo, and all other religious groups (Buddhism, Hindu, Islam, Judaism, others) in total were less than 1 percent of Botswana population.&lt;ref name="U.S. Department of State2016"&gt;{{cite web | title=International Religious Freedom Report for 2015, Country Report: Botswana | author=U.S. Department of State | year=2016| url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm | accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the others category, Muslims were 0.4% and Hindus were 0.3% of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pew Research Center|publisher= PRG, Washington DC|title = Religious Composition by Country: Global Religious Landscape |url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2012/12/globalReligion-tables.pdf|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The constitution of Botswana protects the freedom of religion, allows missionaries and proselytizers to work freely after they register with the government, but forced conversion is against the law. There is no state religion in Botswana.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;&lt;ref name="U.S. Department of State2016"/&gt;

Botswana recognizes only Christian holidays as public holidays. The nationwide religious observations include Good Friday, Easter Monday, Ascension Day, and Christmas.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;&lt;ref name="U.S. Department of State2016"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2035">'''Rustam III''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: رستم), was the ruler of the [[Bavand dynasty]] from 1117 to 1118. He was the son and successor of [[Qarin III]]. 

Rustam III, shortly after his accession of the Bavandid throne, was challenged by his uncle [[Ali I (Bavandid ruler)|Ali I]], who claimed the Bavandid throne for himself. The [[Seljuq Empire|Seljuq]] Sultan [[Muhammad I (Seljuq sultan)|Muhammad I]], then requested the two Bavandid rivals to appear in the Seljuq court of [[Isfahan]]. Rustam, however, refused, but later changed his mind and went to Isfahan, where he shortly fell ill and died. According to some sources, Rustam was poisoned by his stepmother, the sister of Muhammad I, who wanted to marry Ali I. Ali I then ascended the Bavandid throne.

The {{nihongo|'''Sanzu River'''|三途の川|Sanzu-no-kawa|lead=yes}}, or River of Three Crossings, is a [[Japanese Buddhist]] tradition and religious belief similar to the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] concept of the [[River Styx]]. It is believed that the dead must cross the river on the way to the afterlife, a belief reflected in [[Japanese funeral]]s when six coins are placed in the casket with the dead.

The Sanzu River is popularly believed to be in [[Mount Osore]], a suitably desolate and remote part of [[Aomori Prefecture]] in northern Japan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1826">The '''Servants of Jesus and Mary''' ('''Servi Jesu et Mariae''' - SJM) are a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Congregation (Catholic)|Congregation]] which was founded in 1988 by [[Andreas Hönisch]], a former [[Jesuit]], expelled by his congregation due to his traditional views of the Catholic doctrine and pedagogy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thenewliturgicalmovement.blogspot.com/2008/01/fr-andreas-hnisch-sjm.html Fr Andreas Hönisch SJM - updated] Gregor Kollmorgen, New Liturgical Movement, 27 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first members were the German [[Catholic Scouts of Europe]]. Until today the pastoral care of European scout groups and youth work is one of the main priorities of the congregation. The first priests were trained at formed at the seminary of the [[Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter]] and to the seminary of the [[Diocese of Fulda]], but now they have their own [[seminary]] in [[Blindenmarkt]] in [[Lower Austria]].

On 16 July 1994, cardinal [[Antonio Innocenti]] recognised Servi Jesu et Mariae as a Congregation of Papal Law, attached to the Pontifical Commission [[Ecclesia Dei]]. According to themselves they try to fulfill the preconciliar life of the [[Society of Jesus]]. In accordance with that goal they celebrate the ancient [[Tridentine Mass]], but also use the current [[missal]] of [[Pope Paul VI]]. Since 2014, Paul Schindele heads the congregation.

'''Sewadar''' is a [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] word for a volunteer who offers his/her services to a [[Gurdwara]] or to the [[Sikhism|Sikh]] community free of charge. It is a term used to refer to a person who performs [[Selfless service|sewa]] (work, service or assistance of any kind) without looking for any physical or spiritual reward or any payment of any kind. A sewadar helps purely because of his/her dedication to Guru/God and as part of his/her duty to the wider community. People of every religion are included in this service.

[[File:Scolanova Synagogue.jpg|thumb|right|[[Scolanova Synagogue]], [[Trani]], Italy]]
[[File:Synagogue Florence Italy.JPG|thumb|right|[[Great Synagogue of Florence]]]]
A '''synagogue''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|n|ə|g|ɒ|g}}; from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|συναγωγή}}, ''{{transl|grc|synagogē}}'', 'assembly', {{lang-he-n|בית כנסת}} ''{{transl|he|bet kenesset}}'', 'house of assembly' or {{Hebrew|בית תפילה}} ''{{transl|he|bet tefila}}'', "house of prayer", [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]: {{lang|yi|שול}} ''shul'', [[Ladino language|Ladino]]: {{lang|lad|אסנוגה}} ''{{transl|lad|esnoga}}'' or {{lang|lad|קהל}} ''{{transl|lad|kahal}}''), is a [[Jews|Jewish]] or [[Samaritan]] [[house of worship]].

Synagogues have a large place for prayer (the main [[sanctuary]]) and may also have smaller rooms for study and sometimes a social hall and offices. Some have a separate room for [[Torah study]], called the {{Hebrew|בית מדרש}} ''[[beth midrash]]'' "house of study".

Synagogues are consecrated spaces used for the purpose of prayer, [[Tanakh]] (the entire [[Hebrew Bible]], including the [[Torah]]) reading, study and assembly; however, a synagogue is not necessary for [[Jewish prayer|worship]]. [[Halakha]] holds that communal Jewish worship can be carried out wherever ten Jews (a [[minyan]]) assemble. Worship can also be carried out alone or with fewer than ten people assembled together. However, halakha considers certain prayers as communal prayers and therefore they may be recited only by a minyan. In terms of its specific ritual and liturgical functions, the synagogue does not replace the long-since destroyed [[Temple in Jerusalem]].

==Terminology==
[[Israelis]] use the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term ''{{transl|he|beyt knesset}}'' "house of assembly". [[Ashkenazi Jews]] have traditionally used the [[Yiddish]] term ''{{transl|yi|shul}}'' (cognate with the [[German language|German]] {{lang|de|Schule}}, 'school') in everyday speech. [[Sephardi Jews]] and [[Romaniote Jews]] generally use the term ''kal'' (from the Hebrew ''Ḳahal'', meaning "community"). [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Spanish Jews]] call the synagogue a {{lang|es|sinagoga}} and Portuguese Jews call it an {{lang|pt|esnoga}}. [[Persian Jews]] and some [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite Jews]] also use the term ''[[kenesa]]'', which is derived from [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], and some [[Mizrahi Jews]] use ''kenis''.  Some [[Reform Judaism|Reform]], [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]], and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] Jews use the word "temple". The [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''synagogue'' is used in [[English language|English]] ([[German language|German]], [[French language|French]] and most [[Romance languages|Romance]] languages) to cover the preceding possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewfaq.org/shul.htm Judaism 101: Synagogues, Shuls and Temples]. Jewfaq.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Although synagogues existed a long time before the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 CE, communal worship in the time while the Temple still stood centered around the ''[[korban]]ot'' ("sacrificial offerings") brought by the ''[[kohen|kohanim]]'' ("priests") in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. The all-day [[Yom Kippur]] service, in fact, was an event in which the congregation both observed the movements of the ''kohen gadol'' ("the high priest") as he offered the day's sacrifices and prayed for his success.

During the [[Babylonian captivity]] (586–537&amp;nbsp;BCE){{citation needed|date=July 2018}} the men of the [[Great Assembly]]{{dubious|No proof it ever existed, possible date of creation hardly reaches that far back, no source quoted. Rubbish.|date=July 2018}} formalized and standardized the language of the Jewish prayers. Prior to that people prayed as they saw fit, with each individual praying in his or her own way, and there were no standard prayers that were recited.

[[Johanan ben Zakai]], one of the leaders at the end of the Second Temple era, promulgated the idea of creating individual houses of worship in whatever locale Jews found themselves. This contributed to the continuity of the Jewish people by maintaining a unique identity and a portable way of worship despite the destruction of the Temple, according to many historians.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Synagogues in the sense of purpose-built spaces for worship, or rooms originally constructed for some other purpose but reserved for formal, communal prayer, however, existed long before the destruction of the Second Temple.&lt;ref name="pohick"&gt;{{cite web |author=Donald D. Binder |url=http://www.pohick.org/sts/index.html |title=Second Temple Synagogues}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2017}} The earliest archaeological evidence for the existence of very early synagogues comes from Egypt, where stone synagogue dedication inscriptions dating from the 3rd century BCE prove that synagogues existed by that date.&lt;ref name="pohick2"&gt;{{cite web |author=Donald D. Binder |url=http://www.pohick.org/sts/egypt.html |title=Egypt}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2017}} More than a dozen Jewish (and possibly [[Samaritan]]) Second Temple era synagogues have been identified by archaeologists in [[Israel]] and other countries belonging to the [[Hellenistic]] world.&lt;ref name="pohick"/&gt;

Any Jew or group of Jews can build a synagogue. Synagogues have been constructed by ancient Jewish kings, by wealthy patrons, as part of a wide range of human institutions including secular educational institutions, governments, and hotels, by the entire community of Jews living in a particular place, or by sub-groups of Jews arrayed according to occupation, ethnicity (i.e. the Sephardic, Polish or Persian Jews of a town), style of religious observance (i.e., a Reform or an Orthodox synagogue), or by the followers of a particular rabbi.
[[File:Purim 2018.jpg|thumb|Reading from an open Torah scroll]]

It has been theorized that the synagogue became a place of worship in the region upon the destruction of the Second Temple during the [[First Jewish–Roman War]]; however, others speculate that there had been places of prayer, apart from the Temple, during the Hellenistic period. The popularization of prayer over sacrifice during the years prior to the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schiffman|first1=Lawrence|title=From Text to Tradition: A History of Second Temple and Rabbinic Judaism|date=March 1991|publisher=Ktav Pub Inc|isbn=0881253723|page=159|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; had prepared the Jews for life in the diaspora, where prayer would serve as the focus of Jewish worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schiffman|first1=Lawrence|title=From Text to Tradition: A History of Second Temple and Rabbinic Judaism|date=March 1991|publisher=Ktav Pub Inc|isbn=0881253723|page=164|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the possibility{{dubious|Nobody seriously negates their pre-70 CE existance. Only the purpose changed.|date=July 2018}} of synagogue-like spaces prior to the First Jewish–Roman War, the synagogue emerged as a stronghold for Jewish worship upon the destruction of the Temple. For Jews living in the wake of the Revolt, the synagogue functioned as a "portable system of worship". Within the synagogue, Jews worshipped by way of prayer rather than sacrifices, which had previously served as the main form of worship within the Second Temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Schiffman |first= Lawrence |title= From Text to Tradition: A History of Second Temple and Rabbinic Judaism |date= March 1991 |publisher= Ktav Pub Inc. |isbn= 0881253723 |page=164 |edition= 1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Samaritan synagogues==
===Name and history===
The Samaritan house of worship is also called a synagogue.&lt;ref name="Pummer"/&gt; During the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE, during the Hellenistic period, the Greek word used in the [[Diaspora]] by Samaritans and Jews was the same: ''proseucheµ'' (literally, a place of prayer); a later,  3rd or 4th century CE inscription, uses a similar Greek term: ''eukteµrion'' (prayer house).&lt;ref name="Pummer"/&gt; The oldest Samaritan synagogue discovered so far is from [[Delos]] in the [[Aegean Islands]], with an inscription dated between 250 and 175 BCE, while most Samaritan synagogues excavated in the wider [[Land of Israel]] and ancient [[Samaria]] in particular, were built during the 4th-7th centuries, at the very end of the Roman and throughout the Byzantine period.&lt;ref name="Pummer"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Pummer |first= Reinhard |title= How to Tell a Samaritan Synagogue from a Jewish Synagogue |journal= Biblical Archaeology Review |date= |volume= May/June 1998 |issue= 24:03 |via= Center for Online Judaic Studies, cojs.org |url= http://cojs.org/how_to_tell_a_samaritan_synagogue_from_a_jewish_synagogue-_reinhard_pummer-_bar_24-03-_may-jun_1998/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distinguishing elements===
The elements which distinguish Samaritan synagogues from contemporary Jewish ones are:
* '''Alphabet''': the use of the [[Samaritan script]]&lt;ref name="Pummer"/&gt;
* '''Orthography'''. When the Samaritan script is used, there are some Hebrew words which would be spelled in a way typical only for the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]], for instance "forever" is written 'lmw instead of l'lm.&lt;ref name="Pummer"/&gt; When Greek is the language used in inscriptions, typically, Samaritans may contract two [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] words into one, such ''har'' (mountain) and Gerizim becoming, in Greek, ''Argarizein''.&lt;ref name="Pummer"/&gt;
* '''Orientation''': the facade, or entrance of the Samaritan synagogue, is typically facing towards [[Mount Gerizim]], which is the most holy site to Samaritans, while Jewish synagogues would be oriented towards Jerusalem and the Temple Mount.&lt;ref name="Pummer"/&gt;
* '''Decoration''': the mosaic floor and other architectural elements or artifacts are sometimes decorated with typical symbols.&lt;ref name="Pummer"/&gt; As the Samaritans have historically adhered more strictly to the [[Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image|commandment forbidding the creation of any "graven image"]], they would not use any depictions of man or beast.&lt;ref name="Pummer"/&gt; Representations of the signs of the zodiac, of human figures or even Greek deities such as the god [[Helios]], as seen in Byzantine-period Jewish synagogues, would be unimaginable in Samaritan buildings of any period.&lt;ref name="Pummer"/&gt;

:A representation of Mount Gerizim is a clear indication of Samaritan identity.&lt;ref name="Pummer"/&gt; On the other hand, although the existence of a Samaritan temple on Mount Gerizim is both mentioned by Josephus and confirmed by archaeological excavation at its summit, the temple's early destruction in the 2nd century BCE led to its memory disappearing from Samaritan tradition, so that no temple-related items would be found in Samaritan synagogue depictions.&lt;ref name="Pummer"/&gt; Religious implements, such as are also known from ancient Jewish synagogue mosaics ([[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]], [[shofar]], [[shewbread]] table, [[trumpet]]s, incense shovels, and specifically the facade of what looks like a temple or a Torah shrine) are also present in Samaritan ones, but the objects are always related to the desert [[Tabernacle]], the [[Ark of the Covenant]] within the Tabernacle, or the [[Synagogue#Torah Ark|Torah shrine]] in the synagogue itself.&lt;ref name="Pummer"/&gt; Samaritans believe that at the end of time the Tabernacle and its utensils will be recovered from the place they were buried on Mount Gerizim and as such play an important role in Samaritan beliefs.&lt;ref name="Pummer"/&gt; Since the same artists, such as mosaicists, worked for all ethno-religious communities of the time, some depictions might be identical in Samaritan and Jewish synagogues, Christian churches and pagan temples, but their significance would differ.&lt;ref name="Pummer"/&gt;

:Missing from Samaritan synagogue floors would be images often found in Jewish ones: the [[lulav]] (palm-branch) and [[etrog]] (lemon-like fruit) have a different ritual use by Samaritans celebrating [[Sukkot]], and do not appear on mosaic floors.&lt;ref name="Pummer"/&gt;

* '''Ritual baths near the synagogue after 70 CE''': Jews abandoned the habit of building [[Mikveh|mikva'ot]] next to their houses of worship after the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|70 CE destruction]] of the [[Jerusalem Temple]], but Samaritans continued with the practice.&lt;ref name="Pummer"/&gt;

===Archaeological finds===
Ancient Samaritan synagogues are mentioned by literary sources or have been found by archaeologists in the Diaspora, in the wider Holy Land, and specifically in Samaria.&lt;ref name="Pummer"/&gt;

====Diaspora====
* Delos: a Samaritan inscription has been dated to between 250 and 175 BCE.&lt;ref name="Pummer"/&gt;
* [[Rome]] and [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]]: ancient literature offers hints that Samaritan synagogues may have existed in these cities between the fourth and sixth centuries CE.&lt;ref name="Pummer"/&gt;
* [[Thessaloniki]] and [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]: short inscriptions found there and using the Samaritan and Greek alphabet may originate from Samaritan synagogues.&lt;ref name="Pummer"/&gt;

====The wider Holy Land====
* [[Sha'alvim]] synagogue, discovered in Judea, northwest of Jerusalem. Probably built in the 4th or 5th century CE and destroyed in the 5th or 6th.&lt;ref name="Pummer"/&gt;
* [[Tell Qasile]] synagogue, built at the beginning of the 7th century CE&lt;ref name="Pummer"/&gt;
* [[Beth Shean]], "Synagogue A". A room added to an existing building in the late 6th or early 7th century CE served as a Samaritan synagogue.&lt;ref name="Pummer"/&gt;

====Samaria====
* El-Khirbe synagogue, discovered c. 3&amp;nbsp;km from [[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebaste]], was built in the 4th century CE and remained in use into the Early Islamic period, with a break during the late 5th-early 6th century&lt;ref name="Pummer"/&gt;
* Khirbet Samara synagogue, c. 20&amp;nbsp;km northwest of [[Nablus]] and built in the 4th century CE&lt;ref name="Pummer"/&gt;
* Zur Natan synagogue, c. 29&amp;nbsp;km west of Nablus and built in the 5th century CE&lt;ref name="Pummer"/&gt;

==Jewish-Christian synagogue-churches==
During the first Christian centuries, [[Jewish Christian|Jewish-Christians]] used houses of worship known in academic literature as [[synagogue-church]]es. Scholars have claimed to have identified such houses of worship of the Jews who had accepted [[Jesus]] as the [[Messiah]] in Jerusalem&lt;ref name="Skarsaune"&gt;{{cite book |first= Oskar |last= Skarsaune |title= In the Shadow of the Temple: Jewish Influences on Early Christianity |page= 186 |year= 2008 |publisher= IVP Academic |isbn= |quote= 9780830828449 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IAlQTo4H4F4C&amp;pg=PA186 |accessdate= 1 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nazareth]].&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite book |first= Joan E. |last= Taylor |title= Christians and the Holy Places: The Myth of Jewish-Christian Origins |page= 338 |year= 1993 |publisher= Clarendon Press |isbn= 9780198147855 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KWAXbCNxH6YC&amp;pg=PA265 |accessdate= 1 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |first= Chad Fife |last= Emmett |year=1995 |title= Beyond the Basilica: Christians and Muslims in Nazareth |page= 22 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=afhIuqc8-BMC&amp;pg=PA22 |issue=237 |publisher= [[University of Chicago Press]] |series= University of Chicago Geography Research Papers (Book 237) |isbn= 978-0-226-20711-7 |accessdate= 1 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architectural design==
[[File:Exterior of kaifeng synagogue.JPG|thumb|right|Aerial view of the synagogue of the [[Kaifeng Jews|Kaifeng Jewish community]] in China.]]
{{Main|Synagogue architecture}}
There is no set [[blueprint]] for synagogues and the architectural shapes and interior designs of synagogues vary greatly. In fact, the influence from other local religious buildings can often be seen in synagogue arches, domes and towers.

Historically, synagogues were built in the prevailing architectural style of their time and place. Thus, the synagogue in [[Kaifeng|Kaifeng, China]] looked very like Chinese temples of that region and era, with its outer wall and open garden in which several buildings were arranged. The styles of the earliest synagogues resembled the temples of other cults of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. The surviving synagogues of medieval Spain are embellished with [[mudéjar]] plasterwork. The surviving medieval synagogues in [[Budapest]] and [[Prague]] are typical [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] structures.

With the emancipation of Jews in Western European countries, which not only enabled Jews to enter fields of enterprise from which they were formerly barred, but gave them the right to build synagogues without needing special permissions, synagogue architecture blossomed. Large Jewish communities wished to show not only their wealth but also their newly acquired status as citizens by constructing magnificent synagogues. These were built across Western Europe and in the United States in all of the historicist or revival styles then in fashion. Thus there were [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]], [[Neo-Byzantine]], [[Romanesque Revival]], [[Moorish Revival]], [[Gothic Revival]], and [[Greek Revival]]. There are [[Egyptian Revival]] synagogues and even one [[Mayan Revival]] synagogue. In the 19th century and early 20th century heyday of historicist architecture, however, most historicist synagogues, even the most magnificent ones, did not attempt a pure style, or even any particular style, and are best described as eclectic.

In the post-war era, synagogue architecture abandoned historicist styles for modernism.

==Interior elements==
===Bimah (platform)===
All synagogues contain a ''[[Bema#Judaism|Bimah]]'', a raised platform where the table of the rabbi is found.

A large, raised, reader's platform called the {{lang|he-Latn|[[Bema#Judaism|bimah]]}} ({{Hebrew|בימה}}) by Ashkenazim and {{lang|he-Latn|teḇah}} (= reading dais) by Sephardim, where the Torah scroll is placed to be read is a feature of all synagogues. In Sephardi synagogues it is also used as the prayer leader's reading desk.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Table or lectern===
In Ashkenazi synagogues, the [[Torah]] was read on a reader's table located in the center of the room, while the leader of the prayer service, the [[hazzan]], stood at his own lectern or table, facing the Ark. In Sephardic synagogues, the table for reading the Torah (reading dais) was commonly placed at the opposite side of the room from the Torah Ark, leaving the center of the floor empty for the use of a ceremonial procession carrying the Torah between the Ark and the reading table.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Most contemporary synagogues feature a lectern for the rabbi.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Torah Ark===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
The Torah Ark, called in Hebrew {{Hebrew|ארון קודש}} ''Aron Kodesh'' or 'holy chest', and alternatively called the ''heikhal''—{{Hebrew|היכל}} or 'temple' by [[Sephardim|Sephardic Jews]], is a cabinet in which the [[Torah]] scrolls are kept.

The ark in a synagogue is almost always positioned in such a way such that those who face it are facing towards [[Jerusalem]]. Thus, sanctuary seating plans in the Western world generally face [[Mizrah|east]], while those east of Israel face west. Sanctuaries in Israel face towards Jerusalem. Occasionally synagogues face other directions for structural reasons; in such cases, some individuals might turn to face Jerusalem when standing for prayers, but the congregation as a whole does not.

The Ark is reminiscent of the [[Ark of the Covenant]], which held the tablets inscribed with the [[Ten Commandments]]. This is the holiest spot in a synagogue, equivalent to the [[Holy of Holies]]. The Ark is often closed with an ornate curtain, the {{lang|he-Latn|[[parochet]]}} {{Hebrew|פרוכת}}, which hangs outside or inside the ark doors.

===Eternal Light===
[[File:Ner tamid.jpg|thumb|A ner tamid hanging over the [[ark (synagogue)|ark]] in a synagogue]]
Other traditional features include a continually lit lamp or lantern, usually electric in contemporary synagogues, called the {{lang|he-Latn|[[ner tamid]]}} ({{Hebrew|נר תמיד}}), the "Eternal Light", used as a way to honor the Divine Presence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/365933/jewish/Ner-Tamid-The-Eternal-Light.htm "Ner Tamid: The Eternal Light."] ''Chabad''.  28 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inner decoration===
A synagogue may be decorated with artwork, but in the Rabbinic and Orthodox tradition, three-dimensional sculptures and depictions of the human body are not allowed as these are considered akin to idolatry.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Seating===
Originally, synagogues were made devoid of much furniture, the Jewish congregants in [[Spain]], the [[Maghreb]] (North Africa), [[Babylonia]], the [[Land of Israel]] and [[Yemen]] having a custom to sit upon the floor, which had been strewn with mats and cushions, rather than upon chairs or benches. In other European towns and cities, however, Jewish congregants would sit upon chairs and benches.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maimonides]], [[Mishne Torah]] (''Hil. Tefillah'' 11:4), who wrote: "Synagogues and houses of study must be treated with respect. They are swept and sprinkled to lay the dust. In Spain and in the Maghreb (North Africa), in Babylon and in the Holy Land, it is customary to kindle lamps in the synagogues and to spread mats on the floor on which the worshipers sit. In the land of Edom (i.e. Christian countries) they sit in synagogues upon chairs."&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the custom has spread in all places to sit upon chairs and benches.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Until the 19th century, in an [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] synagogue, all seats most often faced the Torah Ark. In a [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] synagogue, seats were usually arranged around the perimeter of the sanctuary, but when the worshipers stood up to pray, everyone faced the Ark.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Special seats===
Many current synagogues have an elaborate chair named for the prophet [[Elijah]], which is only sat upon during the ceremony of [[Brit milah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Zaklikowski |first1=David |title=The Chair of Elijah and Welcoming the Baby |url=https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/144123/jewish/The-Chair-of-Elijah-and-Welcoming-the-Baby.htm#footnote5a144123 |website=Chabad.org |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient synagogues, a special chair placed on the wall facing Jerusalem and next to the Torah Shrine was reserved for the prominent members of the congregation and for important guests.&lt;ref name="Moses"&gt;The Interactive Bible, [http://www.bible.ca/synagogues/Moses-Seat-Metaphor-Pride-reader-leader-judge-Architectural-ancient-Synagogue-pre-70AD-standardized-typology-design-incorporated-adopted-similarities-into-church.htm  ''Synagogue Moses' Seat: Metaphor of Pride'']&lt;/ref&gt; This might be what [[Jesus]] referred to as the "seat of Moses" or "chair of Moses" ({{Bibleref2|Matthew 23:2-3}}), or is mentioned as the "chief seats in the synagogues" elsewhere in the [[Gospels]] ({{Bibleref2|Luke 11:43, 20:46; Matthew 23:6}} etc.).&lt;ref name="Moses"/&gt; Such a stone-carved and inscribed seat was discovered at archaeological excavations in the synagogue at [[Chorazin]] in [[Galilee]] and dates from the 4th–6th century;&lt;ref&gt;[[Israel Museum]], [http://museum.imj.org.il/imagine/galleries/viewItemE.asp?case=6&amp;itemNum=536019  Elaborate seat, Chorazin synagogue]&lt;/ref&gt; another one was discovered at the [[Delos Synagogue]], complete with a footstool, reminiscent of {{Bibleref2|James 2:1–6}}: "... you say to the poor man, “You stand over there, or sit down by my footstool.”"&lt;ref name="Moses"/&gt;

==Rules for attendees==
===Taking off one's shoes===
In [[Yemen]], the Jewish custom was to take-off one's shoes immediately prior to entering the synagogue, a custom that had been observed by Jews in other places in earlier times.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yosef Qafih|Joseph Kafih]], ''Jewish Life in Sanà'', [[Ben-Zvi Institute]]: Jerusalem 1982, p. 64 (note 3) {{ISBN|965-17-0137-4}}. There, Rabbi Kafih recalls the following story in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] (''Baba Metzi'a'' 2:8): “Yehudah, the son of [[Judah ha-Nasi|Rebbe]], entered a synagogue and left his sandals [outside], and they were stolen. He then said, 'Had I not gone to the synagogue, my sandals would not have gone-off.'” The custom of never entering a synagogue while wearing one's shoes is also mentioned in the [[Cairo Geniza]] manuscripts: "While he is yet outside, let him take-off his shoes or sandals from his feet and then enter barefoot, since such is the way of servants to walk barefoot before their lords... We have a minor sanctuary, and we are required to behave with sanctity and fear [in it], as it says: ''And you shall fear my hallowed place''." (v. ''Halakhot Eretz Yisrael min ha-Geniza'' [''The Halacha of the Land of Israel from the Geniza''], ed. Mordechai Margaliot, [[Mossad Harav Kook]]: Jerusalem 1973, pp. 131–132; Taylor-Schechter New Series 135, [[Cambridge University Library]] / Oxford MS. 2700).&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the custom of removing one's shoes is no longer practised in Israel.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Gender separation===
{{main|mechitza}}
Orthodox synagogues feature a partition ({{lang|he-Latn|[[mechitza]]}}) dividing the men's and women's seating areas, or a separate women's section located on a balcony.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Denominational differences==
===Reform Judaism===
[[File:Emanu-elNYjeh.JPG|thumb|[[Congregation Emanu-El of New York]]]]
The German-Jewish Reform movement, which arose in the early 19th century, made many changes to the traditional look of the synagogue, keeping with its desire to simultaneously stay Jewish yet be accepted by the host culture.

The first Reform synagogue, which opened in [[Hamburg]] in 1811, introduced changes that made the synagogue look more like a church. These included: the installation of an [[Organ (music)|organ]] to accompany the prayers (even on [[Shabbat]], when musical instruments are proscribed by [[halakha]]), a choir to accompany the hazzan, and vestments for the synagogue rabbi to wear.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Ken Spiro. [http://www.aish.com/literacy/jewishhistory/Crash_Course_in_Jewish_History_Part_54_-_Reform_Movement.asp "Crash Course in Jewish History Part 54 - Reform Movement"], Aish.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In following decades, the central reader's table, the [[Bema#Judaism|Bimah]], was moved to the front of the Reform sanctuary—previously unheard-of in Orthodox synagogues.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Gender separation was also removed.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Synagogue as community center==
Synagogues often take on a broader role in modern Jewish communities and may include additional facilities such as a catering hall, kosher kitchen, [[religious school]], [[library]], [[day care center]] and a smaller chapel for daily services.

==Synagogue offshoots==
Since many Orthodox and some non-Orthodox Jews prefer to collect a minyan (a quorum of ten) rather than pray alone, they commonly assemble at pre-arranged times in offices, living rooms, or other spaces when these are more convenient than formal synagogue buildings. A room or building that is used this way can become a dedicated small synagogue or prayer room. Among Ashkenazi Jews they are traditionally called {{lang|yi-Latn|[[shtiebel]]}} ({{lang|yi|שטיבל}}, pl. {{lang|yi-Latn|shtiebelekh}} or {{lang|yi-Latn|shtiebels}}, Yiddish for "little house"), and are found in Orthodox communities worldwide.

Another type of communal prayer group, favored by some contemporary Jews, is the ''[[Chavurah]]'' (חבורה, pl. ''chavurot'', חבורות), or prayer fellowship. These groups meet at a regular place and time, either in a private home or in a synagogue or other institutional space. In [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], the [[Pharisees]] lived near each other in ''chavurot'' and dined together to ensure that none of the food was unfit for consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan F. Segal]], ''Rebecca's Children: Judaism and Christianity in the Roman World'', [[Harvard University Press]], 1986, 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

The synagogue chamber, with its surviving paintings, is reconstructed in the National Museum in Damascus.
* The [[Old Synagogue (Erfurt)|Old Synagogue]] in [[Erfurt]], Germany, parts of which date to c.1100, is the oldest intact synagogue building in Europe. It is now used as a museum of local Jewish history.
* The [[Paradesi Synagogue]] is the oldest synagogue in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], located in Kochi, [[Kerala]], in India. It was built in 1568 by the Malabar Yehudan people or [[Cochin Jews|Cochin Jewish]] community in the Kingdom of Cochin. Paradesi is a word used in several Indian languages, and the literal meaning of the term is "foreigners", applied to the synagogue because it was historically used by "White Jews", a mixture of Jews from Cranganore, the Middle East, and European exiles. It is also referred to as the Cochin Jewish Synagogue or the Mattancherry Synagogue. The synagogue is located in the quarter of Old Cochin known as Jew Town and is the only one of the seven synagogues in the area still in use.
* [[Jew's Court]], Steep Hill, [[Lincoln, England]], is arguably the oldest synagogue in Europe in current use.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8819">The '''syncretistic controversy''' was the theological debate provoked by the efforts of [[Georg Calixt]] and his supporters to secure a basis on which the [[Lutheran]]s could make overtures to the [[Roman Catholic]] and the [[Reformed]] Churches. It lasted from 1640 to 1686. 

==Acquaintance to different religious bodies==
Calixt, a professor at [[University of Helmstedt|Helmstedt]], had through his travels in [[England]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Italy]], and [[France]], through his acquaintance with the different Churches and their representatives, and through his extensive study, developed a more friendly attitude towards the different religious bodies than the majority of his contemporary Lutheran theologians.

==Doctrinal minimalism==
While the latter firmly adhered to the "pure doctrine," Calixt tended not to regard doctrine as the one thing necessary for a Christian; while in doctrine itself he did not regard everything as equally certain and important. Consequently, he advocated unity between those who agreed on the fundamental minimum, with liberty as to all less fundamental points. In regard to Catholicism, he would have (as [[Melanchthon]] once would have) conceded to the [[pope]] a primacy human in origin, and he also admitted that one might call the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] a sacrifice.

==Academic theology==
On the side of Calixt stood the theological faculties of [[University of Helmstedt|Helmstedt]], [[Rinteln]], and [[University of Königsberg|Königsberg]]; opposed to him stood those of [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]], [[University of Jena|Jena]], [[University of Strasbourg|Strasburg]], [[University of Giessen|Giessen]], [[University of Marburg|Marburg]], and [[University of Greifswald|Greifswald]]. [[Abraham Calov]] in especial opposed Calixt. 

==Elector of Saxony==
The [[Elector of Saxony]], for political reasons, opposed the [[Reformed Church]], because the other two secular [[Prince-elector|elector]]s (Palatine and Brandenburg) were "[[reformed]]," and were getting more and more the advantage of him. In 1649 he sent to the three dukes of Brunswick, who maintained Helmstedt as their common university, a communication in which he voiced all the objections of his Lutheran professors, and complained that Calixt wished to extract the elements of truth from all religions, fuse all into an entirely new religion, and so provoke a violent schism. 

==Professor at Wittenberg==
In 1650, Calov became a professor at Wittenberg, and he signalized his entrance into office with a vehement attack on the Syncretists in Helmstedt. An outburst of polemical writings followed. In 1650 the dukes of Brunswick answered the Elector of Saxony that the discord should not be allowed to increase, and proposed a meeting of the political councillors. Saxony, however, did not favour this suggestion. An attempt to convene a meeting of theologians was not more successful. The theologians of Wittenberg and Leipzig now elaborated a new formula, condemning  ninety-eight heresies of the Helmstedt theologians. This formula (consensus) was to be signed by everyone who wished to remain in the Lutheran Church. Outside Wittenberg and Leipzig, however, it was not accepted, and Calixt's death in 1656 ushered in five years of almost undisturbed peace.

==Strife in Hesse-Kassel==
The strife broke out afresh in [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]], where [[Landgrave]] [[William VI, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel|William VI]] sought to effect a union between his [[Lutheran]] and [[Reformed]] subjects, or at least to lessen their mutual hatred. In 1661 he had a [[Colloquy of Cassel|colloquy held in Kassel]] between the Lutheran theologians of the [[Rinteln|University of Rinteln]] and the Reformed theologians of the [[University of Marburg]]. Enraged at this revival of the syncretism of Calixt, the Wittenberg theologians in vehement terms called on the Rinteln professors to make their submission, whereupon the latter answered with a detailed defence. Another long series of polemical treatises followed. 

==Disputes between Evangelical bodies==
In [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] the "Great Elector" ([[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg |Frederick William I]]) forbade (1663) preachers to speak of the disputes between the Evangelical bodies. A long colloquy in Berlin (September 1662 to May 1663) led only to fresh discord. The Elector, however, grew impatient with a lack of success at his conferences. He put an end to them in 1664 and published another "syncretistic" edict. Since the edict disallowed the [[Formula of Concord]], one of the Lutheran Confessions as contained in the ''[[Book of Concord]]'' of 1580, many Lutheran clergy could not bring themselves to comply with the edict.

==Observing the syncretistic edict==
Whoever refused to sign the form declaring his intention to observe this regulation was deprived of his position, including [[Paul Gerhardt]], a pastor and noted hymnwriter. The citizens of Berlin petitioned to have him restored, and owing to their repeated requests an exception to the edict was made for Gerhardt, although his conscience did not allow him to retain a post which, appeared to him, could only be held on condition of a tacit repudiation of the [[Formula of Concord]]. For over a year he lived in Berlin without fixed employment. During this time his wife also died, leaving him with only one surviving child. Ironically, the edict was withdrawn a few months later, although by this time his patroness, Electress Louisa Henrietta had died and so he was still without a position.

==Allegations of heresy==
The attempts of the Wittenberg theologians to declare Calixt and his school un-Lutheran and [[Heresy|heretical]] were now met by Calixt's son, Friedrich Ulrich Calixt, The latter defended the theology of his father, but also tried to show that his doctrine did not so very much differ from that of his opponents. Wittenberg found its new champion in [[Ægidius Strauch]], who attacked Calixt with all the resources of learning, polemics, sophistry, wit, cynicism, and abuse. The Helmstedt side was defended by the celebrated scholar and statesman, [[Hermann Conring]]. The Saxon princes now recognized the danger that the attempt to carry through the "Consensus" as a formula of belief might lead to a fresh schism in the [[Lutheran Church]], and might thus render its position difficult in the face of the Catholics. 

==Old Lutheran confession==
The proposals of Calov and his party to continue the refutation and to compel the Brunswick theologians to bind themselves under obligation to the old Lutheran confession therefore remained unimplemented. On the contrary, the Saxon theologians were forbidden to continue the strife in writing. Negotiations for peace then resulted, with Duke [[Ernst I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Altenburg|Ernst the Pious]] of [[Saxe-Gotha]]  especially active towards this end, and the project of establishing a permanent college of theologians to decide theological disputes was entertained. 

==Negotiation with the courts==
However, the negotiations with the courts of Brunswick, Mecklenburg, Denmark, and Sweden remained as fruitless as those with the theological faculties, except that peace was maintained until 1675. [[Abraham Calovius|Calov]] then renewed hostilities. He now attacked not only Calixt, but also and particularly the moderate [[John Musæus]] of Jena. Calov succeeded in having the whole [[University of Jena]] (and after a long resistance Musæus himself) compelled to renounce syncretism. But this was his last victory. The elector renewed his prohibition against polemical writings. 

==Renewed attacks on syncretists==
Calov seemed to give way, since in 1683 he asked whether, in the view of the danger which France then constituted for Germany, a Calixtinic Syncretism with "[[Papist]]s" and the [[Reformed]] were still condemnable, and whether in deference to the [[Elector of Brandenburg]] and the dukes of Brunswick, the strife should not be buried by an amnesty, or whether, on the contrary, the war against syncretism should be continued. He later returned to his attack on the syncretists, but died in 1686, and with his death the strife ended. 

==Reduced religious hatred==
The Syncretist Strife had the result of lessening religious hatred and of promoting mutual forbearance. [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] thus benefited, as [[Protestant]]s came to better understand and appreciate it. In Protestant theology it prepared the way for the sentimental theology of [[Pietism]] to become more popular than [[Lutheran orthodoxy|orthodoxy]].

'''''The American Israelite''''' is an English-language [[Jews|Jewish]] weekly newspaper published in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].  Founded in 1854 as '''''The Israelite''''' and assuming its present name in 1874, it is the second longest-running Jewish newspaper in the world, after the London based ''[[The Jewish Chronicle|Jewish Chronicle]]'' (founded in 1841).&lt;ref name="cinc-mag"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2-0CAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA30 | title=Wise Man | author=Irwin, Julie | magazine=[[Cincinnati Magazine]] | date=March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.newspapers.library.in.gov/73-years-of-the-jewish-post/|title=73 Years of The Jewish Post|date=2015-11-09|work=Hoosier State Chronicles: Indiana's Digital Newspaper Program|access-date=2018-07-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paper's founder, Rabbi [[Isaac Mayer Wise]], and publisher, Edward Bloch and his [[Bloch Publishing Company]], were both very influential figures in American Jewish life.
During the 19th century, ''The American Israelite'' became the leading organ for [[Reform Judaism]] in America.  During the early 20th century, it helped geographically dispersed American Jews, especially in the West and the South of the country, keep in touch with Jewish affairs and their religious identity.

== Founding and early history ==
The first Jewish newspaper published in Cincinnati was the English-language ''The  Israelite'', established on July 15, 1854.&lt;ref name="ai-web"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.americanisraelite.com/ | title=American Israelite: Current Issue | publisher=The American Israelite | accessdate=August 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also among the first Jewish publications in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FB0713F7385A11728DDDAA0894D1405B8088F1D3 | title=Charles E. Bloch, Long a Publisher | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=September 3, 1940 | page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was founded by Rabbi [[Isaac Mayer Wise]], who became known as the father of [[Reform Judaism]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=ISJL2006TI/&gt;  Its initial issues were published by Charles F. Schmidt.&lt;ref name="Bloch"/&gt; The paper lost $600 in its first year, and although Wise repaid the publisher out of his own funds, Schmidt terminated the relationship.&lt;ref name="Bloch"/&gt; Edward Bloch and his [[Bloch Publishing Company]] began to publish the paper with the issue of July 27, 1855.&lt;ref name="Bloch"&gt;{{cite book | first=Robert | last=Singerman | chapterurl=http://www.blochpub.com/early_history | chapter=Bloch &amp; Company: Pioneer Jewish Publishing House in the West | title= Jewish Book Annual, Volume 52, 1994–1995 | pages= 110–130 | year=1994 | editor-first=Jacob | editor-last=Kabakoff | publisher=[[Jewish Book Council]] | isbn=1-885838-02-6 | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloch, who was Wise's brother-in-law, subsequently became known as the dean of American Jewish publishers.

From the start, the newspaper's motto was ''' יהי אור ''' "Let There Be Light," and still is.&lt;ref name="ai-web"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isaac-profile"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1898/04/03/102070815.pdf | title=Isaac M. Wise | author=May, Max B. | newspaper=[[The New York Times Magazine]] | date=April 3, 1898 | page=SM11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its two goals were to propagate the principles of Reform Judaism and to keep American Jews, who often lived in small towns singly or in communities of two or three families, in touch with Jewish affairs and their religious identity.&lt;ref name="jencyc-ai"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=A&amp;artid=1388 | title=American Israelite, The | author=Wise, Leo | work=[[Jewish Encyclopedia]] | publisher=[[Funk and Wagnalls]] | date=1901–1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication, along with ''Die Deborah'', a German-language supplement that Wise started the following year, soon attracted a large circulation and was influential in helping the nascent Reform movement spread throughout North America.&lt;ref name="isaac-obit"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1900/03/27/102582424.pdf | title=Career of Rabbi Wise. | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=March 27, 1900 | page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Both Wise and the paper had a reach beyond Cincinnati, and especially to the growing Jewish communities in the American Midwest and South.&lt;ref name="cinc-mag"/&gt;
In 1858, for instance, the members of [[Temple Israel (Memphis, Tennessee)|Congregation B'nai Israel]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] advertised for their first rabbi in ''The Israelite'', at the same time they advertised for a kosher butcher.&lt;ref name=ISJL2006TI&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.isjl.org/history/archive/tn/HistoryofTempleIsrael.htm | title=History of Temple Israel | publisher=[[Goldring / Woldenberg Institute of Southern Jewish Life]] | work=Encyclopedia of Southern Jewish Communities | location=Jackson, Mississippi | year=2006 | accessdate=July 22, 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5txukApmR?url=http://www.isjl.org/history/archive/tn/HistoryofTempleIsrael.htm | archivedate=November 3, 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Israelite 1859-09-163.png|thumb|right|upright|175px|September 16, 1859, front page of ''The Israelite'']]

Despite its spread, the early years of ''The Israelite'' were a financial struggle.  Most subscribers did not pay their bills, the [[Panic of 1857]] adversely affected it, and the paper lost half its subscribers in the South during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Bloch"/&gt;  Bloch travelled east several times in the late 1850s in order to solicit subscriptions and advertising.&lt;ref name="Bloch"/&gt;  Wise's admitted sloppiness in monetary matters did not help either.&lt;ref name="Bloch"/&gt;  Nevertheless, the newspaper and Bloch stayed out of bankruptcy and relocated to larger offices twice during this period.&lt;ref name="Bloch"/&gt;

Wise, a prolific writer, published in the editorial columns of ''The Israelite'' numerous studies on various subjects of Jewish interest.
Besides being the leading organ for American Reform Judaism, it also forcefully defended the civil and religious rights of all Jews.&lt;ref name="centcinc"/&gt;
Wise tirelessly expounded his call to the "ministers and other Israelites" of the United States, urging them to form a union which might put an end to the prevalent religious anarchy.&lt;ref name="jencyc-w"/&gt;  In 1873, twenty-five years after he had first broached the idea, the [[Union of American Hebrew Congregations]] was organized at Cincinnati.&lt;ref name="jencyc-w"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=214&amp;letter=W | title=Wise, Isaac Mayer | author=Adler, Cyrus | author2=Philipson, David | work=[[Jewish Encyclopedia]] | publisher=[[Funk and Wagnalls]] | date=1901–1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another campaign he presented in the columns of ''The Israelite'' was the desire for an educational institution, and this eventually led to success in 1875 when the [[Hebrew Union College]] opened its doors for the reception of students.&lt;ref name="jencyc-w"/&gt;
Wise also wrote a number of novels, which appeared first as serials in the ''Israelite''.

== New name and continued influence ==
''The Israelite'' was renamed ''The American Israelite'' beginning with the issue of July 3, 1874.&lt;ref name="Bloch"/&gt;  The goal was to make the name more in consonance with the ideas it represented.&lt;ref name="jencyc-ai"/&gt;  Despite the change, the paper continued to cover and advocate for not only American Jews but also Jews around the world.&lt;ref name="isaac-profile"/&gt;  By 1879, a typical issue had eight pages 28-by-42-inches in size, and a subscription cost $4, or $5 if the ''Die Deborah'' four-page supplement was included.&lt;ref name="and-1879"&gt;{{cite book | title=Geo. P. Rowell &amp; Co.'s American Newspaper Directory | year=1879 | publisher=Geo. P. Rowell &amp; Co. | location=New York | page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=oIrQAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA266 266]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Wise's son Leo Wise, who had become business manager for the paper in 1875,&lt;ref name="jencyc-ai"/&gt; took over as its publisher from 1883 to 1884, and then he did so again, permanently, in 1888 (due apparently to some kind of rupture between Leo Wise and Bloch).&lt;ref name="Bloch"/&gt; A sister publication, ''The Chicago Israelite'', was started in 1885.&lt;ref name="Bloch"/&gt;  The papers stressed their reputation in trade publications, stating "None but clean advertisements of reputable houses accepted."&lt;ref name="and-1900"/&gt;

Leo Wise gradually took over the principle editorial functions from his father,&lt;ref name="jencyc-ai"/&gt; but Rabbi Wise remained active on the paper until his death on March 26, 1900,&lt;ref name="isaac-profile"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isaac-obit"/&gt; writing an editorial for it just a few days before.&lt;ref name="centcinc"&gt;{{cite book | title=Centennial History of Cincinnati and Representative Citizens, Volume 1 |first=Charles Theodore  | last=Greve | publisher=Biographical Publishing Company | location=Chicago | year=1904 | page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=eJxABLtxX60C&amp;pg=PA946 946]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ownership then passed to Leo Wise.&lt;ref name="leo-obit"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10A1EF6355F1A7A93CAAB178AD85F478385F9 | title=Leo Wise Dies at 84; Cincinnati Editor | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=January 28, 1933 | page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1900, ''The American Israelite'', in combination with ''The Chicago Israelite'', claimed a circulation of other 35,000, about 12,000 in Ohio and Illinois and the balance spread across almost every other state as well as Canada and Mexico.&lt;ref name="and-1900"&gt;{{cite book | title=American Newspaper Directory | year=1900 | publisher=Geo.

Other noted contributors to the paper in this era included Rabbi [[Moses Mielziner]] and Jewish history scholar [[Gotthard Deutsch]], as well as other prominent rabbis and Jewish thinkers within the country.  The paper gave extensive coverage to the goings-on of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations and the Hebrew Union College (and was sometimes viewed as a publication of them), as well as notices of various rabbinical conferences.&lt;ref name="jencyc-ai"/&gt;

''Die Deborah'' was discontinued after Isaac Wise's death, then resumed for a while.&lt;ref name="jencyc-ai"/&gt;
''The Chicago Israelite'' ceased publication in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0004_0_04235.html | title=Chicago | work=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] | publisher=American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subsequent history ==
Leo Wise was succeeded as editor and publisher of ''The American Israelite'' in 1928 by his half-brother, Rabbi [[Jonah Wise]] of New York, who remained in that city&lt;ref name="nyt-jonah"/&gt; and who himself became a long-time leader of American Reform Judaism.

The Jonah Wise arrangement did not last long, and in 1930, journalist Henry C. Segal bought the paper and became its editor and publisher for more than five decades, until his death in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/20/us/henry-c-segal.html | title=Henry C.

Contributors to the newspaper in the late 1980s and early 1990s included writer Don Canaan.&lt;ref name="aja-canaan"/&gt; His four-part series published in 1988, "Jews in Ohio's Prisons: Does Anyone Care?", won the award for best weekly journalism from the [[Ohio State Bar Association]].&lt;ref name="aja-canaan"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://collections.americanjewisharchives.org/ms/ms0708/ms0708.html | title=A Finding Aid to the Don Canaan Papers. 1986-2013. | publisher=[[The Jacob Rader Marcus Center of the American Jewish Archives]] | accessdate=February 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1990s, the paper was focusing on local Jewish news.&lt;ref name="cinc-mag-96"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ax8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA43 | title=Lies, Damned Lies | author=Tate, Skip | magazine=[[Cincinnati Magazine]] | date=October 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1995, ''The American Israelite'' was sued for $2 million by an Ohio lawyer for calling him and his son anti-Semitic.&lt;ref name="cinc-mag-96"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-45363531.html | title=American Israelite Sued for $2 Million | author=Canaan, Don | agency=[[United Press International]] | date=February 28, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Urantia Book''''' (sometimes called '''''The Urantia Papers''''' or '''''The Fifth Epochal Revelation''''') is a [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and [[Philosophy|philosophical]] book that originated in [[Chicago]] some time between 1924 and 1955. The authorship remains a matter of speculation. It has received various degrees of interest ranging from praise to criticism for its religious and science content, its unusual length, and its lack of a known author.

The text introduces the word "Urantia" as the name of the planet [[Earth]] and states that its intent is to "present enlarged concepts and advanced truth."{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=138}}{{sfn|The Urantia Book|1955|p=1}} The book aims to unite religion, science and philosophy,{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=129}} and its enormous amount of material about science is unique among literature claimed to be presented by celestial beings.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=181}} Among other topics, the book discusses the [[origin of life|origin]] and [[meaning of life]], humankind's place in the [[universe]], the relationship between [[God]] and people, and the life of [[Jesus]].

The [[Urantia Foundation]], a U.S.-based [[non-profit group]], first published ''The Urantia Book'' in 1955. In 2001, a jury found that the English-language book's copyright was no longer valid in the United States after 1983.&lt;ref name="Michael2003" /&gt; The English text became a [[public domain]] work in the United States,{{sfn|Lewis|2007|p=208}} and in 2006 the international copyright expired.{{efn|Urantia Foundation acknowledges on their website that under the [[Berne Convention]] the international copyright expired January 1, 2006.&lt;ref name="UrantiaFoundCopyright" /&gt;}}

== Background ==

=== Authorship ===
[[File:William S Sadler 1914.jpg|thumb|right|[[William S. Sadler]]]]
[[File:Lena Sadler - SadlerLenaBill.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lena Sadler|Lena K. Sadler]]]]
The exact circumstances of the origin of ''The Urantia Book'' are unknown. The book and its publishers do not name a human author. Instead, it is written as if directly presented by numerous celestial beings appointed to the task of providing an "epochal" religious revelation.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=11}}{{sfn|Lewis|2003|pp=129–30}}

As early as 1911, [[William S. Sadler]] and his wife [[Lena Sadler]], physicians in Chicago and well known in the community, are said to have been approached by a neighbor who was concerned because she would occasionally find her husband in a deep sleep and breathing abnormally.{{sfn|Lewis|2007|p=200}}{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=115}} She reported that she was unable to wake him at these times. The Sadlers came to observe the episodes, and over time, the individual produced verbal communications that claimed to be from "student visitor" spiritual beings.{{sfn|Lewis|2007|p=201}}{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=115}} This changed sometime in early 1925{{sfn|Lewis|2007|p=201}} with a "voluminous handwritten document," which from then on became the regular method of purported communication.{{sfn|Lewis|2007|p=201}}{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=116}} The individual was never identified publicly but has been described as "a hard-boiled business man, member of the board of trade and stock exchange."{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=115}}

The Sadlers were both respected physicians, and William Sadler was a [[debunker]] of [[paranormal]] claims, who is portrayed as not believing in the [[supernatural]].{{sfn|Gooch|2002|pp=4–6}} In 1929, he published a book called ''The Mind at Mischief'', in which he explained the fraudulent methods of [[mediumship|mediums]] and how self-deception leads to [[psychic]] claims. He wrote in an appendix that there were two cases that he had not explained to his satisfaction:{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=6}}&lt;ref name="Sadler1929" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The other exception has to do with a rather peculiar case of psychic phenomena, one which I find myself unable to classify.&amp;nbsp;... I was brought in contact with it, in the summer of 1911, and I have had it under my observation more or less ever since, having been present at probably 250 of the night sessions, many of which have been attended by a stenographer who made voluminous notes. A thorough study of this case has convinced me that it is not one of ordinary trance.&amp;nbsp;... This man is utterly unconscious, wholly oblivious to what takes place, and, unless told about it subsequently, never knows that he has been used as a sort of clearing house for the coming and going of alleged extra-planetary personalities.&amp;nbsp;... [[Psychoanalysis]], [[Hypnosis|hypnotism]], intensive comparison, fail to show that the written or spoken messages of this individual have origin in his own mind. Much of the material secured through this subject is quite contrary to his habits of thought, to the way in which he has been taught, and to his entire philosophy. In fact, of much that we have secured, we have failed to find anything of its nature in existence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1923, a group of Sadler's friends, former patients, and colleagues began meeting for Sunday philosophical and religious discussions, but became interested in the strange communications when Sadler mentioned the case at their fourth meeting and read samples at their request.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=116}}{{sfn|Lewis|2007|p=201}} Shortly afterwards, a communication reportedly was received about which this group would be allowed to devise questions and that answers would be given by celestial beings through the "contact personality."

Sadler presented this development to the group, and they generated hundreds of questions without full seriousness, but their claim is that it resulted in the appearance of answers in the form of fully written papers.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|pp=30–1}} They became more impressed with the quality of the answers and continued to ask questions, until all papers now collected together as ''The Urantia Book'' were obtained. The group was known as the Forum, and was formalized as a closed group of 30 members in 1925 who pledged not to discuss the material with others.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=31}} Over time, some participants left and others joined, leading to a total membership of 486 people over the years from diverse backgrounds and a mix of interest levels.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=123}}{{efn|One Forum member and early believer was the Arctic explorer [[Sir Hubert Wilkins]], whose $1,000 check was the first money to go toward the book's publication costs.&lt;ref name="Nasht2006" /&gt;}} A smaller group of five individuals called the Contact Commission, including the Sadlers, was responsible for gathering the questions from the Forum, acting as the custodians of the handwritten manuscripts that were presented as answers, and arranging for proofreading and typing of the material.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|pp=401–2}} Bill Sadler, Jr. is noted to have composed the table of contents that is published with the book.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=399}}

The Sadlers and others involved, now all deceased, claimed that the papers of the book were physically materialized from 1925 until 1935 in a way that was not understood even by them, with the first two parts being completed in 1934 and the third and fourth in 1935.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|pp=123–4}} The last Forum gathering was in 1942.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|pp=123–4}}

After the last of Part IV was obtained in 1935, an additional period of time supposedly took place where requests for clarifications resulted in revisions. Sadler and his son William (Bill) Sadler, Jr. at one point wrote a draft introduction and were told that they could not add their introduction. The Foreword was then "received."

The communications purportedly continued for another two decades while members of the Forum studied the book in depth, and according to Sadler and others, permission to publish it was given to them in 1955. The [[Urantia Foundation]] was formed in 1950 as a tax-exempt educational society in Illinois,{{sfn|Mather &amp; Nichols|1993|p=295}} and through privately raised funds, the book was published on October 12, 1955.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=34}}

Only the members of the Contact Commission witnessed the activities of the "sleeping subject", and only they knew his identity.{{sfn|Lewis|2007|p=200}} The individual is claimed to have been kept anonymous in order to prevent undesirable future veneration or reverence for him.{{sfn|Lewis|2007|p=202}} [[Martin Gardner]] states that an explanation concerning the origin of the book more plausible than celestial beings is that the Contact Commission, particularly William Sadler, was responsible. Gardner's conclusion is that a man named Wilfred Kellogg was the sleeping subject and authored the work from his subconscious mind, with William Sadler subsequently editing and authoring parts.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|pp=129–30}} [[Brad Gooch]] believes Sadler wrote the book, possibly with help from others on the Contact Commission.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=56}} A statistical analysis using the [[Frederick Mosteller|Mosteller]] and Wallace methods of [[stylometry]] indicates at least nine authors were involved, and by comparatively analyzing the book against ''The Mind at Mischief'', does not indicate authorship or extensive editing by Sadler, without ruling out the possibility of limited edits.{{sfn|Lewis|2007|pp=208–9}}

=== Copyright status ===
In 1991, after having compiled an index of ''The Urantia Book'' and distributed free copies via computer disk and printouts, Kristen Maaherra was sued by the Urantia Foundation for violating their copyright on the book.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=398}} In 1995, Maaherra won a Summary Judgment declaring the Urantia Foundation's copyright renewal invalid.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=408}} Upon appeal, the judgment was reversed and awarded to the Urantia Foundation.&lt;ref name="Maaherra1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cotter2003" /&gt;

Four years later, in 1999, Harry McMullan III and the Michael Foundation published a book, ''Jesus–A New Revelation'', which included verbatim 76 of the 196 papers included in ''The Urantia Book''.  McMullan and the Michael Foundation subsequently sought a legal declaration that the Urantia Foundation's US copyright in ''The Urantia Book'' was either invalid or, alternatively, that the copyright had not been infringed upon.  Urantia Foundation's copyright was held to have expired in 1983 because the book was deemed to have been neither a composite work nor a commissioned work for hire.  These two arguments having been rejected, a U.S. court held that, since the Conduit had died prior to 1983, only the Conduit's heirs would have been eligible to renew the copyright in 1983 and, since they had not done so, the Urantia Foundation's copyright on the book had expired and the book had therefore passed into the public domain.  This decision was upheld on appeal.&lt;ref name="Michael2003" /&gt;

== Overview ==
&lt;!-- per [[WP:MOST#Punctuation]], do not place punctuation within quotation marks of titles unless the punctuation is part of the title --&gt;
''The Urantia Book'' is approximately 2,000 pages long, and consists of a body of 196 "papers" divided in four parts, and an introductory foreword:
* Part I, titled "The Central and Superuniverses", addresses what the authors consider the highest levels of creation, including the [[eternity|eternal]] and [[Infinity|infinite]] "Universal Father", his Trinity associates, and the "Isle of Paradise".
* Part II, "The Local Universe", describes the origin, administration, and personalities of the local universe of "Nebadon", the part of the cosmos where Earth resides. It presents narratives on the inhabitants of local universes and their work as it is coordinated with a scheme of spiritual ascension and progression of different orders of beings, including humans, [[angel]]s, and others.
* Part III, "The History of Urantia", compiles a broad history of the Earth, presenting a purported explanation of the origin, evolution, and destiny of the world and its inhabitants. Topics include [[Adam and Eve]], [[Melchizedek]], essays on the concept of the Thought Adjuster, "Religion in Human Experience", and "Personality Survival".
* Part IV, "The Life and Teachings of Jesus", is the largest part at 775 pages, and is often noted as the most accessible{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=12}} and most impressive,{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=312}} narrating a detailed biography of Jesus that includes his childhood, teenage years, family life, and public ministry, as well as the events that led to his [[crucifixion]], death, and resurrection. Its papers continue about appearances after he rose, [[Pentecost]] and, finally, "The Faith of Jesus".

=== Nature of God ===
According to ''The Urantia Book'', God is the creator and upholder of all reality{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=139}}—an [[omniscience|omniscient]], [[omnipresence|omnipresent]], [[omnipotence|omnipotent]], [[infinity|infinite]], and [[eternity|eternal]] spirit personality.{{sfn|The Urantia Book|1955|loc=Paper 3}} The most fundamental teaching about God in the book is that he is a Father.{{sfn|The Urantia Book|1955|p=618}}{{sfn|The Urantia Book|1955|p= 2097}}  "The face which the Infinite turns toward all universe personalities is the face of a Father, the Universal Father of love."{{sfn|The Urantia Book|1955|p=1153}}

God, according to the book, is one Deity who functions on a range of different levels of reality, both personal and impersonal. God is taught to exist in a [[Trinity]] of three perfectly individualized persons who are co-equal: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit.{{sfn|Mather &amp; Nichols|1993|p=219}} These persons are referred to by additional titles in the book, primarily as the "Universal Father," "Eternal Son," and "Infinite Spirit."{{sfn|Mather &amp; Nichols|1993|p=219}}{{sfn|House|2000|p=260}} While stating that the concept of one God in three persons is difficult to fully understand, the book says that the idea: "...in no manner violates the truth of the divine unity. The three personalities of Paradise Deity are, in all universe reality reactions and in all creature relations, as one."{{sfn|The Urantia Book|1955|p=31}}

The Father, Son, and Spirit are considered "existential" persons of Deity, those in existence from the eternal past to the eternal future.{{sfn|House|2000|p=259}}  In addition, three persons of Deity are described who are "experiential", or incomplete and in the process of actualizing:  God the Supreme; God the Ultimate; and God the Absolute.{{sfn|House|2000|p=259}}  Of these three, God the Supreme, or "the Supreme Being," is given the most explanation, as the person of Deity evolving in time and space to unify finite reality and the infinite. The persons of God the Ultimate and God the Absolute are considered to be remote from the possibility of comprehension and are covered on a limited basis.

Many types of celestial beings are enumerated in the book, and one of particular note is a joint "offspring" of the Universal Father and Eternal Son called a "Creator Son".{{sfn|House|2000|pp=261–2}}{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=141}} A divine Creator Son is considered the highest personification of the Universal Father and Eternal Son that is possible for people to know and: "...is, to all practical intents and purposes, God."{{sfn|The Urantia Book|1955|p=66}} [[Jesus]] of [[Nazareth]] is identified as a Creator Son who [[incarnation|incarnated]] on Earth,{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=141}} and the central theme of the book's section recounting his life and teachings is that the religion he preached is the highest known to the world.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=31}}

The final paper states:{{sfn|The Urantia Book|1955|p=2090}}

{{quote|To "follow Jesus" means to personally share his religious faith and to enter into the spirit of the Master's life of unselfish service for man. One of the most important things in human living is to find out what Jesus believed, to discover his ideals, and to strive for the achievement of his exalted life purpose. Of all human knowledge, that which is of greatest value is to know the religious life of Jesus and how he lived it.}}

=== God and the individual ===
God is described as the Father of each individual, and through the direct gift of a fragment of his eternal spirit, called a '''Thought Adjuster''', is said to be able to guide the individual toward an increased understanding of him.{{sfn|House|2000|p=271}}{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=9}}  The Thought Adjuster is a central teaching of the book{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=235}} and is also referred to as a "Mystery Monitor" and "indwelling presence,"{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=235}} as well as a "divine spark."{{sfn|The Urantia Book|1955|p=1459}} The idea is compared within the book to the [[Hindu]] [[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]] and the ancient [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[Egyptian soul|ka]]. In relation to biblical traditions, the Thought Adjuster is said to be the meaning behind the phrases "being made in God's image" and the "kingdom of God is within you":{{sfn|The Urantia Book|1955|p=1193}}

{{quote|The Adjuster is the mark of divinity, the presence of God. The "image of God" does not refer to physical likeness nor to the circumscribed limitations of material creature endowment but rather to the gift of the spirit presence of the Universal Father in the supernal bestowal of the Thought Adjusters upon the humble creatures of the universes.}}

Each person is said to receive one such fragment at the time of his or her first independent [[morality|moral]] decision, on average around the age of five years and 10 months.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=235}}{{sfn|House|2000|p=271}} The Adjuster then serves noncoercively as a divine partner in the mind of the individual for the rest of life, and to the extent that a person consents with their [[free will]] to want to find God, it leads the person toward more mature, spiritualized thinking. A person's Thought Adjuster is described as distinct from either the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] or the [[conscience]]. In ''The Urantia Book''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s teachings, the degree to which a human mind chooses to accept its Adjuster's guidance becomes the degree to which a person's soul "grows" and becomes a reality that can then survive death. The soul is in essence an embryonic spiritual development,{{sfn|House|2000|p=272}} one parental factor being the divine Adjuster and the other being the human will.{{sfn|The Urantia Book|1955|p=70}}

The book says: "But you yourself are mostly unconscious of this inner ministry.  You are quite incapable of distinguishing the product of your own material intellect from that of the conjoint activities of your soul and the Adjuster."{{sfn|The Urantia Book|1955|p=1207}} The book is strongly [[fideism|fideistic]] and teaches that neither science nor logic will ever be able to prove or disprove the existence of God, arguing that faith is necessary to become conscious of God's presence in human experience, the Thought Adjuster.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=31}}{{sfn|Lewis|2007|p=206}}

Persistently embracing [[sin]] is considered the same as rejecting the leadings of the Adjuster, rejecting the [[will (philosophy)|will]] of God. Constant selfishness and sinful choosing lead eventually to iniquity and full identification with unrighteousness, and since unrighteousness is unreal, it results in the eventual annihilation of the individual's identity.{{sfn|House|2000|p=276}}{{sfn|The Urantia Book|1955|p=37}} Personalities like this become "as if they never were." The book says that: "...in the last analysis, such sin-identified individuals have destroyed themselves by becoming wholly unreal through their embrace of iniquity."{{sfn|The Urantia Book|1955|p=37}} The concepts of [[Hell]] and [[reincarnation]] are not taught.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=166}}{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=10}}

The book says that a person ultimately is destined to fuse with his or her divine fragment and become one inseparable entity with it as the final goal of faith.{{sfn|House|2000|p=274}} Uniting with the Adjuster fragment is the "reward of the ages," the moment when a human personality has successfully and unalterably won eternal life,{{sfn|House|2000|p=274}} described as typically taking place in the afterlife, but also a possibility during earthly life.{{sfn|The Urantia Book|1955|loc=Paper 112}} The result during human life is a "fusion flash," with the material body consumed in a fiery light and the soul "translated" to the afterlife. The Hebrew prophet [[Elijah]] being taken to heaven without death in "chariots of fire" is said to be a rare example in recorded history of a person who translated instead of experiencing death.

After a person fuses with his or her fragment of God, "then will begin your real life, the ascending life, to which your present mortal state is but the vestibule."{{sfn|House|2000|p=274}} A person continues as an ascending citizen in the universe and travels through numerous worlds on a long pilgrimage of growth and learning that eventually leads to God and residence on Paradise.{{sfn|House|2000|p=275}}{{sfn|Gardner|1995|pp=14–7}} Mortals who reach this stage are called "finaliters."{{sfn|House|2000|p=274}} The book goes on to discuss the potential destinies of these "glorified mortals."

The book regards human life on earth as a "short and intense test,"{{sfn|The Urantia Book|1955|p=158}} and the afterlife as a continuation of training that begins in material life.{{sfn|House|2000|p=272}} The "religion of Jesus" is considered to be practiced by way of loving God the Father, thereby learning to love each person the way Jesus loves people; that is, recognizing the "fatherhood of God and its correlated truth, the brotherhood of man,"{{sfn|House|2000|p=273}} resulting in unselfish service to others.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=132}}{{sfn|The Urantia Book|1955|p=2083}}

=== Cosmology ===
The book describes that at the center of the cosmos is the stationary Isle of Paradise—the dwelling place of [[God]]—with Paradise being surrounded by "Havona," an eternal universe containing a billion perfect worlds, around which seven incomplete and evolutionary "superuniverses" circle.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=12}}{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=140}}

The word "universe" in the book is used to denote a number of different scales of organization.  A "superuniverse" is roughly the size of a [[galaxy]] or group of galaxies, and the seven superuniverses along with Paradise-Havona are together designated as the "grand universe." A "local universe" is a portion of a superuniverse, with 100,000 local universes being in each superuniverse.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=12}}  Beyond the seven superuniverses, uninhabited "outer space levels" are described.  The term "master universe" refers to what in modern usage would be the total universe—all existing [[matter]] and space taken as a whole.

Urantia is said to be located in a remote local universe named "Nebadon," which itself is part of superuniverse number seven, "Orvonton." The physical size of a local universe is not directly stated, but each is said to have up to 10 million inhabited worlds.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=12}}

=== History and future of the world ===
The book's extensive teachings about the history of the world include its physical development about 4.5 billion years ago, the gradual changes in conditions that allowed life to develop, and long ages of organic evolution that started with microscopic marine life and led to plant and animal life in the oceans, later on land. The emergence of humans is presented as having occurred about a million years ago from a branch of superior [[primate]]s originating from a [[lemur]] ancestor. The first humans are said to have been male and female twins called Andon and Fonta, born "993,419 years prior to 1934."{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=21}}{{sfn|House|2000|p=270}}

''The Urantia Book'' teaches not only biological evolution,{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=129}} but that human society and spiritual understandings evolve by slow progression, subject both to periods of rapid improvement and the possibility of retrogression. Progress is said to follow a divine plan that includes periodic gifts of revelation and ministry by heavenly teachers, which eventually will lead to an ideal world status of "light and life" in the far distant future.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=130}}

Although there is the ideal and divine plan of progression, it is said to be fostered and administered by various orders of celestial beings who are not always perfect. Urantia is said to be a markedly "confused and disordered" planet that is "greatly retarded in all phases of intellectual progress and spiritual attainment" compared to more typical inhabited worlds, due to an unusually severe history of rebellion and default by its spiritual supervisors.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|pp=140–1}}{{sfn|The Urantia Book|1955|p=578}}

== Comparisons ==

=== Comparison to Christianity ===
More than one third of the content of ''The Urantia Book'' is devoted to a narrative of the life and teachings of Jesus, and the [[Judeo-Christian tradition]] is given an importance exceeding any other.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=131}}{{sfn|House|2000|p=254}}{{sfn|Godwin|1998|p=351}} The book's teachings claim to be a clarification and expansion of Christian belief.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=143}} However, numerous differences are noted between its teachings and commonly accepted Christian doctrines.{{sfn|House|2000|p=254}}{{sfn|Gardner|1995|pp=24–32}}

[[Jesus]] is held in high regard by ''The Urantia Book,'' as he is in the New Testament of the [[Bible]].{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=131}}  The following are attributed to him in both texts:
* He was both human and divine,{{sfn|House|2000|p=263}} the Son of God incarnate who was born to [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], whose husband was [[Joseph the Betrothed|Joseph]].{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=142}}
* He performed many of the miracles described in the Bible, such as the resurrection of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]], the turning of water into wine, the feeding of the five thousand, and numerous healings of the blind, diseased, and infirm.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=28}}
* He taught twelve apostles, most of whom went on to spread his teachings.
* He was crucified, and on the third day after his death, rose from the dead.
* He will return to the world again some day.

Some differences with Christianity include:
* Jesus' crucifixion is not considered an [[atonement in Christianity|atonement]] for the sins of humanity.{{sfn|House|2000|p=273}} The crucifixion is taught to be an outcome of the fears of religious leaders of the day, who regarded his teachings as a threat to their positions of authority.
* Jesus is considered the human incarnation of "Michael of Nebadon," one of more than 700,000 "Paradise Sons" of God, or "Creator Sons." Jesus is not considered the second person of the [[Trinity]] as he is in Christianity. The book refers to the Eternal Son as the second person of the Trinity.{{sfn|House|2000|p=262}}
* Jesus was born on Earth through natural means of conception instead of a [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]].{{sfn|House|2000|p=264}}
* Jesus did not walk on water or perform some of the miracles that are attributed to him in the Bible.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|pp=27–9}}

=== Comparison to Seventh-day Adventism ===
Gardner notes similarities between [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventism]] and the teachings of ''The Urantia Book'', and sees this as evidence that William Sadler and Wilfred Kellogg had a role in editing or writing the book, since they both were one-time believers in Adventism.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|pp=225–6}} For instance, two basic Adventist beliefs that distinguish it from mainline Christianity are the doctrines of [[soul sleep]]ing and [[annihilationism]], both of which ''The Urantia Book'' also supports.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|pp=226–33}}{{sfn|House|2000|p=272}} Lewis notes that from the perspective of the book being a "revelation," it could be claimed the "celestial beings" simply found areas of Adventist belief to be accurate and therefore presented and expanded on them.{{sfn|Lewis|2007|p=210}} While the book supports aspects of Adventism, it also is mixed with teachings that are heresies to Adventists.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|pp=225–6}}

=== Other comparisons ===
The book can be seen as belonging in the genre of spiritual literature that includes ''[[A Course in Miracles]]'' and ''[[Conversations with God]]''.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|pp=17–8}} Gardner compares it with ''[[Oahspe]]'', noting that though ''Oahspe'' is "vastly inferior to the UB both in ideas and style of writing," they are similar in claiming to have been written by celestial beings channelled through a human conduit, teaching that there is "one ultimate God who oversees a vast bureaucracy of lesser deities" while both outline an elaborate cosmology.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|pp=161–78}} The book's claimed supernatural origin has been compared to similar claims of the [[Book of Mormon]], [[Science and Health]], the [[Quran]], and the [[Bible]],{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=15}}{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=10}} with belief in it not being seen as necessarily a greater leap in reason.{{sfn|Lewis|2007|p=210}}{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=15}}

Comparisons with facets of various world religions are incorporated in the book, including Buddhism, Islam, Taoism, Judaism, Hinduism, Shinto, and Confucianism. For example, Paper 131, "The World's Religions" discusses the aspects of these religions that are in common with what the book claims is the "religion of Jesus." The stance of the book is that there "is not a Urantia religion that could not profitably study and assimilate the best of the truths contained in every other faith."{{sfn|The Urantia Book|1955|p=1012}}

== Consideration as literature ==
''The Urantia Book'' has been enjoyed by some as a form of [[science fiction]], [[historical fiction]] or [[fantasy]]. ''The Urantia Book'' is noted for its high level of internal consistency and an advanced writing style. Skeptic Martin Gardner, in a book otherwise highly critical of ''The Urantia Book'', writes that it is "highly imaginative" and that the "cosmology outrivals in fantasy the cosmology of any science-fiction work known to me."{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=12}} Gooch says that for nonbelievers, the book is a mixture of being "fascinating, inspiring, compelling, haunting, entertaining, annoying, incomprehensible, and always wordy."{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=23}}

Parts I, II, and III are chiefly written in expository language. The papers are informational, matter-of-fact, and instructional. Part IV of the book is written as a biography of Jesus' life, and some feel it is a rich narrative with well-developed characters, high attention to detail, woven sub-plots, and realistic dialogue. Considered as literature, Part IV is favorably compared to retellings of Jesus' life, such as ''[[The Gospel According to Jesus Christ]]'' by [[José Saramago]] and ''[[Behold the Man (novel)|Behold the Man]]'' by [[Michael Moorcock]]. Martin Gardner considers Part IV to be an especially "well-written, impressive work," and says, "Either it is accurate in its history, coming directly from higher beings in position to know, or it is a work of fertile imagination by someone who knew the New Testament by heart and who was also steeped in knowledge of the times when Jesus lived."{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=312}} His assessment is that the narrative is consistent with human authorship.

== Critical views ==

=== Criticisms of claims as a revelation ===
The authors refer to the book as the fifth revelation of "epochal significance" to humankind, the fourth epochal revelation having been the life of Jesus.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|pp=21–2}} The claim of revelation in ''The Urantia Book'' has been criticized for various reasons. Skeptics such as [[Martin Gardner]] say it is a product of human efforts rather than a revelation because some of its science is flawed. Because the book does not support certain tenets of Christianity, such as the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement doctrine]], while at the same time presenting an account of parts of Jesus' life absent in the Bible, others with a Christian viewpoint have argued it cannot be genuine.{{sfn|House|2000|p=254}}&lt;ref name="Larson2004" /&gt; Gooch notes that while its "somewhat dated, elegant" prose could be read as fiction, due to its claim of divine inspiration "the book invites reactions far more scathing than [it] ... might otherwise merit."{{sfn|Gooch|2002|pp=21–2}}

=== Criticism of its science ===
In Paper 101, "The Real Nature of Religion," the authors write:{{sfn|The Urantia Book|1955|p=[[s:Page:The Urantia Book, 1st Edition.djvu/1175|1109]]}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;We full well know that, while the historic facts and religious truths of this series of revelatory presentations will stand on the records of the ages to come, within a few short years many of our statements regarding the physical sciences will stand in need of revision in consequence of additional scientific developments and new discoveries. These new developments we even now foresee, but we are forbidden to include such humanly undiscovered facts in the revelatory records. Let it be made clear that revelations are not necessarily inspired. The cosmology of these revelations is ''not inspired''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Skeptics like [[Martin Gardner]] see the science in ''The Urantia Book'' as clear reflections of the views that prevailed at the time the book is said to have originated.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|loc=Chapters 10–11}} The claim by the authors, that no unknown scientific discoveries could be imparted, is seen as a ruse to allow mistakes to be dismissed later.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=224}} That presentation of post-1955 scientific knowledge is avoided is taken to be evidence it was written by humans and not by celestial beings with superior knowledge.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|loc=Chapters 10–11}}

Examples of criticisms regarding the science in ''The Urantia Book'' include:
* The described formation of the [[solar system]] is consistent with the [[Chamberlin-Moulton planetesimal hypothesis]],{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=168}} which though popular in the early part of the 20th century, was discarded by the 1940s after major flaws were noted.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|pp=187–8}} The currently accepted scientific explanation for the origin of the solar system is based on the [[solar nebula|nebular hypothesis]].{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=168}}
* According to the book's descriptions, the universe is hundreds of billions of years old and periodically expands and contracts — "respires" — at 2-billion-year intervals. Recent observations suggest that the true [[age of the universe]] is approximately 13.7 billion years.&lt;ref name="Weintraub2010" /&gt; The book does not support the [[big bang]] theory.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=186}}
* A fundamental particle called an "ultimaton" is proposed, with an [[electron]] being composed of 100 ultimatons. The particle is not known to be described anywhere else and the concept is not supported by modern [[particle physics]].{{sfn|Gardner|1995|pp=211–2}}
* The [[Andromeda Galaxy]] is claimed to be "almost one million" light years away, repeating the understandings of the 1920s,{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=196}} but the galaxy is now understood to be [[Andromeda Galaxy#Recent distance estimate|2.5 million light years away]].
* The book repeats the mistaken idea that planets close to a sun will gradually spin slower until one hemisphere is left always turned to the sun due to [[tidal locking]], citing [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] as an example. Scientists at the time of the book's origin thought one side of Mercury always faced the sun, just as one side of the [[Moon]] always faces the Earth. In 1965, [[radio astronomy|radio astronomers]] discovered however that Mercury rotates fast enough for all sides to see exposure to the sun.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=186}} Scientists further established that Mercury is locked in this spin rate in a stable resonance of 3 spins for every 2 orbits, and it is not slowing and so will never have one side left always turned to the sun.{{sfn|Correia|2004|p=848}}
* Some [[species]] are said to have [[Saltation (biology)|evolved suddenly]] from single [[mutation]]s without transitional species.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=195}} The theory originated with [[Dutch people|Dutch]] botanist [[Hugo De Vries]] but was short-lived and is not now supported.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|pp=297–8}}
* The book erroneously says that a solar eclipse was predicted in 1808 by the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] prophet [[Tenskwatawa]].  The eclipse actually was predicted in late April 1806 and occurred on June 16, 1806.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|pp=209–10}} In 2009, Urantia Foundation acknowledged the error and revised the book.{{efn|Per text standardization performed by Urantia Foundation to reconcile changes made to the text since 1955 and fix other errors they considered to be typos.&lt;ref name="TextStandarization" /&gt;}}
* Controversial statements about human races can be found in the book.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=24}} Gardner believes that William S. Sadler, who wrote some [[eugenics|eugenicist]] works, had a hand in editing or writing the book, and that this is how the ideas were included.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|pp=283–96}}

While some adherents of the book believe that all of the information in ''The Urantia Book'' including its science is literally true, others accept the book's caveats and do not believe that the science is fully accurate.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|pp=182–4}}{{sfn|Gardner|1995|pp=222–3}}

Meredith Sprunger, a [[liberal religion|liberal]] believer in ''The Urantia Book'' and retired minister of the [[United Church of Christ]], wrote that research "has revealed that virtually all of the scientific material found in the UB was the accepted scientific knowledge of the period in which the book was written, was held by some scientists of that time, or was about to be discovered or recognized."{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=222}}&lt;ref name="Sprunger" /&gt; He further argued against its literal infallibility and said that fundamentalism over the book is "just as untenable as Biblical fundamentalism."{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=222}}

Other believers maintain that the book has prophetically anticipated scientific advances already. They believe more of its science — if not all of it — will be proven correct in the future. Gardner evaluated many of these claims as of 1995 and found them unconvincing.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|loc=Chapters 10–11}} Some arise because the book is said to have been written by the revelators by 1935, but then was not published until 1955. Discoveries from science during the two intervening decades can be perceived as prophetic by believers, while skeptics think such facts were added prior to publication.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|pp=185–6}} For instance, the catalytic role that [[carbon]] plays in the sun's nuclear reactions is described in the book, though [[Hans Bethe]]'s announcement of the discovery was not made until 1938.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=206}}

The only apparent anticipation of science the book has made, in Gardner's opinion, is that it says the magnetic sense that [[homing pigeons]] possess is "not wholly wanting as a conscious possession by mankind." In 1980, a British zoologist, Robin Baker, published evidence that humans have a limited magnetic sense.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=201}}

[[Mark McMenamin]], a professor of [[geology]], quotes a section of the book describing a billion-year-old supercontinent that subsequently split apart, forming ocean basins where early marine life developed. He says, "This amazing passage, written in the 1930s, anticipates scientific results that did not actually appear in the scientific literature until many decades later." McMenamin also states, "Of course I am being selective here in my choice of quotations, and there are reams of scientifically untenable material in ''The Urantia Book''."&lt;ref name="McMenamin2000" /&gt;

=== Use of other published material without attribution ===
''The Urantia Book'' states in its Foreword that more than one thousand "human concepts representing the highest and most advanced planetary knowledge of spiritual values and universe meanings"{{sfn|The Urantia Book|1955|p=[[s:Page:The Urantia Book, 1st Edition.djvu/83|17]]}} were selected in preparing the papers. The authors say that they were required to "give preference to the highest existing human concepts pertaining to the subjects to be presented" and would "resort to pure revelation only when the concept of presentation has had no adequate previous expression by the human mind." One of the authors wrote in Part IV: "I well know that those concepts which have had origin in the human mind will prove more acceptable and helpful to all other human minds."{{sfn|The Urantia Book|1955|p=[[s:Page:The Urantia Book, 1st Edition.djvu/1409|1343]]}}

In recent years, students of the papers have found that the free use of other sources appears to be true.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|loc=Chapter 16}}{{sfn|Gooch|2002|pp=48–57}} None of the material allegedly used from other sources is directly cited or referenced within the book.

In 1992, a reader of ''The Urantia Book'', Matthew Block, self-published a paper that showed ''The Urantia Book'' utilized material from 15 other books.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=321}} All of the source authors identified in Block's paper were published in English between 1905 and 1943 by U.S. publishers and are typically scholarly or academic works that contain concepts and wording similar to what is found in ''The Urantia Book''.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|loc=Chapter 16}} Block has since claimed to have discovered over 125 source texts that were incorporated into the papers.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=48}}

The use of outside source materials was studied separately by Gardner and Gooch, and they concluded that the book did plagiarize many of the sources noted by Block.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=325}}{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=57}}

For instance, Gardner and Block note that Paper 85 appears to have been taken from the first eight chapters of ''Origin and Evolution of Religion'' by [[Edward Washburn Hopkins]], published by [[Yale University Press]] in 1923.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|pp=343–6}} Each section of the paper corresponds to a chapter in the book, with several passages possibly used as direct material and further material used in Papers 86-90 and 92. (In addition to the book's "heavy indebtedness to Hopkins," Gardner discovered that Hopkins was a major reference in an earlier book authored by Sadler, adding to Gardner's view that it is more likely Sadler had a hand in writing or editing ''The Urantia Book'' than that celestial beings wrote it.) Likewise, much of ''The Urantia Book'' material relating to the evolution of mankind appears to have been directly taken from [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]], ''Man Rises to Parnassus: Critical Epochs in the Prehistory of Man'' published by [[Princeton University Press]] in 1928.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|pp=54–5}}

In one example cited by Block and confirmed by Gardner and Gooch, the original author discusses the periodicity of the chemical elements and concludes that the harmony in the construction of the atom suggests some unspecified plan of organization. The authors of ''The Urantia Book'' assert that this harmony is evidence of the [[intelligent design]] of the universe. W. F. G. Swann writes on page 64 of ''The Architecture of the Universe'' (italics indicate edits as compared to ''The Urantia Book'', bolding indicates deletions):{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=349}}{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=55}}
{{quote|Starting from any one '''of them [i.e., chemical''' element'''s],''' ''and'' noting some property such '''as the melting point, for example,''' ''the property would change as we went along the row,'' but ''as we continued it would gradually come back to the condition very similar to that which we started'' ... The eighth element ''was in many respects like'' the first, the ninth '''like''' the second, '''the tenth like the third,''' and so on. Such a ''slate of affairs'' point[s] '''''not only''''' to ''a varied internal structure, but also to a certain harmony in that variation suggestive of some organized plan in building the atom.''}}

Contrast with ''The Urantia Book''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s version:
{{quote|Starting from any one element, ''after'' noting some ''one'' property, such ''a quality will exchange for six consecutive elements,'' but ''on reaching the eighth, it tends to reappear, that is,'' the eighth ''chemically active'' element ''resembles'' the first, the ninth the second, and so on. Such a ''fact of the physical world unmistakably'' points to ''the sevenfold constitution of ancestral energy and is indicative of the fundamental reality of the sevenfold diversity of the creations of time and space.''}}

Block and other believers do not see the use of the source materials as plagiarism, but express a view instead that the quality of the way the material was borrowed is consistent with authorship by celestial beings and that study of the sources leads to an even deeper understanding of ''The Urantia Book''.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=355}}{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=379}} Gooch, a professor of English, assessed that the use of the sources "does reveal to us an author with a busy genius for metaphysical invention and poetic turns of phrase whose scam was at worst benign and at most visionary."{{sfn|Gooch|2002|pp=56–7}} Asked by Gardner what he thought of these plagiarisms, Sprunger responded in a letter by saying that if humans wrote the book the plagiarisms would indeed be disturbing but not if it was written by supermortals.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=362}}

== Influence ==

=== Adherents ===
It is difficult to gauge how many adherents there may be as there are multiple organization to census. Informal study groups "tend to sprout, ripen, then vanish or splinter" and have not been counted reliably.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=14}} Readers sometimes join study groups after reading on their own for years or decades, others join them soon after developing an interest in the book, while "for most, worship remains as individual as the act of reading."{{sfn|Gooch|2002|pp=14–5}} Disagreements over the legal ownership of the book, its interpretation, and the reception of new revelations have led to some splintering, though these disagreements appear to have been settled to the satisfaction of most adherents.&lt;ref name="Partridge2004" /&gt; The movement generally incorporates a nonsectarian view, contending that individuals with different religious backgrounds can receive the book's teachings as an enrichment rather than as a contradiction of their faiths.&lt;ref name="Melton1990" /&gt;

The movement inspired by ''The Urantia Book'' has not developed clergy or institutions such as churches, or temples.{{sfn|Gooch|2002}}&lt;ref name="Partridge2004" /&gt;

Sarah Lewis notes that, "The Urantia Revelation is not securing legitimacy through historically known and accepted means to any great degree, nor is it even using common language that would increase the likelihood of understanding and therefore acceptance. It introduces new concepts and a new language, and this does not make acceptance any easier." She assesses that the movement is uncontroversial compared to other ones, "lacking the zealous proselytizing found within many other groups," and that it is therefore likely to remain small and unaffected by opposing views.{{sfn|Lewis|2007|p=211}}

Urantia Foundation advocated a "slow growth" policy in the past and had not significantly marketed the book.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=395}} Sales by Urantia Foundation went from 7,000 in 1990 to 24,700 in 1997, and steadily increased to nearly 38,000 in 2000, an "upturn that seems to represent a genuine trend rather than just some spike on a sales chart,"{{sfn|Gooch|2002|p=13}} however in 2011 the Foundation reported worldwide annual sales of 16,000 copies and over 60,000 downloads from various sites. Since the book was determined to be in the [[public domain]] in 2001, other organizations, such as The Urantia Book Fellowship under the publishing name Uversa Press, have also published the book. Copies of ''The Urantia Book'' are on the Internet in various formats and it has been adapted to more recent platforms such as the [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]] and the [[App Store (iOS)|iOS App Store]]. Several audio books of the text are also on the Internet.

The International Urantia Association had twenty-six reader associations worldwide as of 2002, and the Urantia Book Fellowship (formerly the Urantia Brotherhood, founded in 1955 with Urantia Foundation as the original social fraternal organization of believers) claimed roughly twelve hundred official members, with the highest concentrations in the West of the United States and the [[Sun Belt]], especially California, Colorado, Florida, and Texas.{{sfn|Gooch|2002|pp=13–4}} It appears an increasing number of people are forming study groups, participating in Internet discussion groups, and hosting or visiting websites about it.{{sfn|Gooch|2002}}{{Page needed|date=October 2017}}

=== Independent channelers ===
The Teaching Mission is a group of Urantia [[Mediumship#Channeling|channellers]]. According to [[Richard Landes]], "The [[Urantia Foundation|foundation]] considers them self-deluded, but they have created a schism that continues to disrupt the movement."&lt;ref name="Landes2000" /&gt;

Vern Grimsley was a "dynamic speaker" who founded a Urantian outreach organization called Family of God in the 1970s, which was initially supported by others in the movement, including the Urantia Foundation.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|pp=361–3}} Beginning in the early 1980s, Grimsley claimed he began hearing voices that were from the same higher beings who wrote ''The Urantia Book'', and that the voices warned of an impending world war followed by a nuclear holocaust.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|pp=361–3}} While some in the movement believed him, others including the Urantia Foundation concluded Grimsley's messages were spurious, former friends eventually began to shun him, and in later years he is said to have lived in obscurity.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|pp=361–3}}

=== In popular culture ===
* [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] based his seven-opera cycle ''[[Licht]]'' on the cosmology of ''The Urantia Book''.{{sfn|Godwin|1998|p=350}}&lt;ref name="Robin2011" /&gt;
* [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] (1954–1990), American blues-rock guitarist: "Stevie often brought along the book of Urantia and read Lindi passages from the strange publication."&lt;ref name="PatoskiCrawford1994" /&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2017}}
* [[Jimi Hendrix]] (1942–1970) "Jimi also had with him the Book of Urantia, an alternative Bible... Jimi carried this book with him everywhere--along with his Bob Dylan songbook--and told friends he had learned much from its pages."&lt;ref name="Cross2005" /&gt;
* [[Jaco Pastorius]] (1951–1957) wrote the song 'Havona' while he was still playing in the [[jazz fusion]] band [[Weather Report]] during the late 1970s (the song features on the album [[Heavy Weather (album)|Heavy Weather]])
* [[Jerry Garcia]] was a reader of ''The Urantia Book'' and claimed it was "one of his favorite esoteric works"&lt;ref name="McNally2002" /&gt;
* [[Kerry Livgren]] is quoted: "In 1977, I discovered a book that convinced me I had reached the end of my quest. It was called ''The Urantia Book'' ...."&lt;ref name="Hagberg2006" /&gt;
* [[Pato Banton]] Reggae artist and toaster explained in several interviews how the discovery of the Urantia book answered many questions he had sustained during a fifteen-year spiritual quest, and how he discovered his personal relationship with God through it.&lt;ref&gt;https://soundcloud.com/urantia-book-radio/pato-banton-how-i-found-the-urantia-book-produced-by-urantia-now&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbols ==
[[File:Urantia three-concentric-blue-circles-on-white symbol.svg|left|80px|Paradise Trinity]]
One symbol described in ''The Urantia Book'' consists of three concentric [[Azure (color)|azure]] circles on a white background. The circles are said to symbolize God's triune nature of Father, Son, and Spirit. When the Creator Son Michael, later incarnated on Earth as Jesus, went to war with Lucifer 200,000 years ago, he used the concentric circles on his banner. Lucifer's emblem was a solid black circle in the center of a red one.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=12}}

Urantia Foundation, the original publisher, placed the concentric circles on the cover of ''The Urantia Book'' and has a United States trademark. The circles are used to indicate other organizations affiliated with the foundation.
The Urantia Association International, one of the main readership organizations in the movement, has been licensed by Urantia Foundation to use the three azure concentric circles on a white background.

The symbol is also used in various altered forms. The Urantia Book Fellowship, an independent reader organization established in 1955, uses a similar symbol.

'''Zalmoxis''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ζάλμοξις}})&lt;ref&gt;also known as '''Salmoxis''' (Σάλμοξις), '''Zalmoxes''' (Ζάλμοξες), '''Zamolxis''' (Ζάμολξις), '''Samolxis''' (Σάμολξις), '''Zamolxes''' (Ζάμολξες), or '''Zamolxe''' (Ζάμολξε)&lt;/ref&gt; 
is a supposed divinity of the [[Getae]] and [[Dacians]] (a people of the lower [[Danube]]), mentioned by [[Herodotus]] in his [[Histories (Herodotus)#Book IV (Melpomene)|''Histories'' Book IV, 93–96]], written before 425 BC.&lt;ref name="classics.mit.edu"&gt;http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.mb.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jordanes|Jordanes's]] ''[[Getica]]'', he was a learned philosopher, before whom two other learned men existed, by the names of [[Zeuta]] and [[Deceneus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.ucalgary.ca/~vandersp/Courses/texts/jordgeti.html|title=THE ORIGIN AND DEEDS OF THE GOTHS|author=|date=|website=people.ucalgary.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, theories and debate on the Zalmoxis religion by such scholars as [[Mircea Eliade]] are influenced by considerations of [[Romanian nationalism]] as well by pure historical interest. 

==Herodotus==
Herodotus writes about Zalmoxis in book 4 of his ''Histories'':&lt;ref name="classics.mit.edu"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;93. ...the Getae are the bravest of the Thracians and the most just.	
94. They believe they are immortal forever living in the following sense: they think they do not die and that the one who dies joins Zalmoxis, a divine being; some call this same divine being Gebeleizis. Every four years, they send a messenger to Zalmoxis, who is chosen by chance. They ask him to tell Zalmoxis what they want on that occasion. The mission is performed in the following way: men standing there for that purpose hold three spears; other people take the one who is sent to Zalmoxis by his hands and feet and fling him in the air on the spears. If he dies pierced, they think that the divinity is going to help them; if he does not die, it is he who is accused and they declare that he is a bad person. And, after he has been charged, they send another one. The messenger is told the requests while he is still alive. The same Thracians, on other occasions, when he thunders and lightens, shoot with arrows up in the air against the sky and menace the divinity because they think there is no god other than their own.&lt;/blockquote&gt;	

Herodotus asserts that Zalmoxis was originally a human being, a slave who converted the [[Thracians]] to his beliefs. The Greeks of the Hellespont and the Black Sea tell that Zalmoxis was a slave of [[Pythagoras]], son of Mnesarchos, on the island of [[Samos]]. After being liberated, he gathered huge wealth and, once rich, went back to his homeland. Thracians lived simple hard lives. Zalmoxis had lived among the wisest of Greeks, such as Pythagoras, and had been initiated into Ionian life and the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]]. He built a banquet hall, and received the chiefs and his fellow countrymen at a banquet. He taught that neither his guests nor their descendants would ever die, but instead would go to a place where they would live forever in a complete happiness. He then dug an underground residence. When it was finished, he disappeared from Thrace, living for three years in his underground residence. The Thracians missed him and wept fearing him dead. The fourth year, he came back among them and thus they believed what Zalmoxis had told them.

Zalmoxis may have lived much earlier than Pythagoras and was rumored either to be a divine being or from the country of the Getae.

Scholars have several different theories about this account by Herodotus the disappearance and return of Zalmoxis:
* Herodotus is mocking the barbarian beliefs of the Getae.
* Zalmoxis created a ritual of passage. This theory is mainly supported by [[Mircea Eliade]], who wrote the first coherent interpretation of the Zalmoxis myth.
* Zalmoxis is related to Pythagoras, stating that he founded a mystical cult. This theory may be found in Eliade's work.
* Zalmoxis is a Christ-like figure who dies and is resurrected. This position was defended by Jean (Ioan) Coman, a professor of [[patristics]] and [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox priest]], who was a friend of Mircea Eliade and published in Eliade's journal ''Zalmoxis'', which appeared in the 1930s.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

This last theory precisely parallels the legend of the universal king [[Fróði|Frode]] given in both ''Ynglingsaga'' and ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' of [[Saxo Grammaticus]], particularly ''Ynglingsaga'' 12 and Saxo 5.16.3, in which Frode disappears into the earth for three years after his death.

It is difficult to define the time when a cult to Zalmoxis may have existed. It is only certain that it antecedes Herodotus. Some scholars have suggested that the archaic doctrine of Zalmoxis points to a heritage from before the times of Indo-Europeans, but this is difficult, if not impossible, to demonstrate.&lt;ref name="name67"&gt;Sorin Paliga. "La divinité suprême des Thraco-Daces", in ''Dialogues d’histoire ancienne (Persée revue)''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]] says in the dialogue ''[[Charmides (dialogue)|Charmides]]''  (lines 156 D – 157 B) that Zalmoxis was also a great physician who took a [[holistic health|holistic]] approach to healing body and soul (psyche), being thus used by Plato for his own philosophical conceptions.

==Religion of the Getae==
[[Strabo]] in his ''Geography'' mentions a certain [[Deceneus]] (Dékainéos) whom he calls a γόητα "magician".&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, ''Geography'', book 7, 3, 1–11&lt;/ref&gt; According to Strabo, king [[Burebista]] (82–44 BC) hired Deceneus, who had been in Egypt, to "tame" his people. As a sign of the people's obedience, they consented to destroy all their wines as ordered by Deceneus. The "reform of Deceneus" is the interpretation by the 6th-century bishop and historian [[Jordanes]], who includes the Getae in his history of the Goths (as assumed ancestors of the Goths). Jordanes describes how Deceneus taught the Getae philosophy and physics. Even if it is more probable that Jordanes interjected his own philosophical knowledge into the text, many modern Romanian authors consider that Deceneus was a priest who reformed the religion of the Getae, changing the worship of Zalmoxis into a popular religion and imposing strict religious rules, such as the restriction of wine consumption. Jean Coman deems this prohibition as the origin of the dietary restrictions followed by the modern Orthodox Church during Lent.

According to [[Iamblichus]] (280-333 AD), "for instructing the Getae in these things, and for having written laws for them, Zalmoxis was by them considered as the greatest of the gods."&lt;ref&gt;Rousell, Patrick (ed.) [http://www.completepythagoras.net/volume1/iamblichus/30.html The Complete Pythagoras]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] is said, in the brief epitome of his ''Magicus'' given by Diogenes Laertes, to have compared Zalmoxis with the [[Phoenicia]]n Okhon and [[Ancient Libya|Libya]]n [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]]. Some authors{{who|date=November 2015}} assume Zalmoxis was another name of [[Sabazius]], the Thracian [[Dionysus]], or [[Zeus]]. Sabazius appears in Jordanes as Gebelezis.  Leaving aside the suffixes ''-zius/-zis'', the root ''Saba-'' = ''Gebele-'',{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} suggesting a relationship of the name of the goddess Cybele, as "Cybele's Zeus". [[Mnaseas|Mnaseas of Patrae]] identified Zalmoxis with [[Cronus|Cronos]], as does [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]], who has "{{lang|grc|Σάλμοξις ὁ Κρόνος}}".{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In [[Plato]]'s writings, Zalmoxis is mentioned as skilled in the arts of incantation. Zalmoxis gave his name to a particular type of singing and dancing (Hesych).&lt;ref name="Znamenski"&gt;Znamenski, Andrei A. ''Shamanism''&lt;/ref&gt; His realm as a god is not very clear, as some considered him to be a sky-god, a god of the dead, or a god of the Mysteries.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

[[Lactantius]] (an early Christian author, c. 240–320 AD), referring to the religion of the Getae, provides an approximate translation of [[Julian the Apostate]]'s purported quotation of [[Trajan]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We have conquered even these Getai (Dacians), the most warlike of all people that have ever existed, not only because of the strength in their bodies, but, also due to the teachings of Zalmoxis who is among their most hailed. He has told them that in their hearts they do not die, but change their location and, due to this, they go to their deaths happier than on any other journey."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Zalmoxian religion==
[[File:Zalmoxis Aleksandrovo.jpg|thumb|A tomb painting at the Aleksandrovska Grobnitsa ([[Bulgaria]]), which possibly depicts Zalmoxis.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Wagner [http://www.eurasischesmagazin.de/artikel/Thrakien-und-die-Thraker-alles-was-man-wissen-muss/20040805 Die Thraker] Eurasisches Magazin, 30 August 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kalin Dimitrov [http://chain.eu/?m3=16347 Thracian tomb of Aleksandrovo], Cultural Heritage Activities and Institutes Network, 12 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The "Zalmoxian religion" is the subject of a scholarly debate that has continued since the beginning of the 20th century. According to some scholars, such as Vasile Pârvan, Jean Coman, R. Pettazzon, E. Rohde and Sorin Paliga, since ancient sources do not mention any god of the Getae other than Zalmoxis, the Getae were monotheistic.&lt;ref name="name67"/&gt; However, Herodotus is the only ancient author who explicitly states that the Getae had only one divinity. The sending of a messenger to Zalmoxis and the fact that Getae shot arrows towards the sky have prompted some authors to believe Zalmoxis was a sky god, but his journey into a cavern has led others to suggest that he was a chthonic divinity.

A third group of scholars believe that the Getae, like other Indo-European peoples, were polytheistic. They draw on ancient authors such as [[Diodorus Siculus]], who states that the Getae worshipped [[Hestia]] as well as Zalmoxis.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, Book 1, c. 94: "...among the people known as the Getae who represent themselves to be immortal, Zalmoxis asserted the same of their common goddess Hestia..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
A number of etymologies have been given for the name.  In his ''Vita Pythagorae'', [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyrius]] (3rd century) says that he was so named because he had been wrapped in a bearskin at birth, and ''zalmon'' is the Thracian word for "hide" ({{lang|grc|τὴν γὰρ δορὰν οἱ Θρᾷκες ζαλμὸν καλοῦσιν}}). [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]] (ca. 5th century) has ''zemelen'' (ζέμελεν) as a [[Phrygian language|Phrygian]] word for "foreign slave".

The correct spelling of the name is also uncertain. Manuscripts of Herodotus' ''Historiae'' have all four spellings, viz. ''Zalmoxis'', ''Salmoxis'', ''Zamolxis'', ''Samolxis'', with a majority of manuscripts favouring ''Salmoxis''. Later authors show a preference for ''Zamolxis''. Hesychius quotes Herodotus, using ''Zalmoxis''.

The ''-m-l-'' variant is favoured by those wishing to derive the name from a conjectured Thracian word for "earth", ''*zamol''. Comparisons have also been made with the name of Zemelo and [[Žemyna|Žemelė]], the [[Phrygia]]n and [[Lithuania]]n goddess of the earth, and with the Lithuanian [[chthonic]] god [[Žemėpatis|Žemeliūkštis]].  The Lithuanian word ''Žalmuo'' means "corn shoot" or "fresh grass". ''Žalmokšnis'' is another possible form of it.

The ''-l-m-'' variant is admitted to be the older form and the correct form by the majority of Thracologists, as this is the form found in the older Herodotus manuscripts and other ancient sources. The ''-l-m-'' form is further attested in Daco-Thracian in ''Zalmodegikos'', the name of a Getic King; and in Thracian ''zalmon'', 'hide', and ''zelmis'', 'hide' (PIE ''*kel-'', 'to cover'; cf. English ''helm'').

The other name for Zalmoxis, Gebeleizis, is also spelled Belaizis and Belaixis in Herodotus manuscripts.

According to Mircea Eliade:
{{quotation|"The fact that Romanian folk mythology around their prophet Elijah contains many elements of a god of the storm proves at least that Gebeleizis was still active in the moment when Dacia was christianised, whatever his name was in this era. It can also admits that subsequently a religious syncretism, encouraged by the high priest and the priestly class, ended up on confusing Gebeleizis with Zalmoxis"}}

{{Citation needed span|Since the Getae-Dacian religious system was monotheistic [[aniconism]] centered around the god Zalmoxis, it is less likely that the believers in his resurrection would use a name meaning "hide" / "foreign slave", as the hostile ancient Greek non-believers related about him.|date=April 2017}}{{Original research inline|date=April 2017}}&lt;!-- statement was added in December 2009 in [[Special:Diff/333203296|this edit]] --&gt;

==In popular culture==
The [[Sfinx (band)|Romanian rock band Sfinx]] worked from around 1975 through 1978 on ''Zalmoxe'', a [[progressive rock]] [[Long play|LP]], with lyrics by poet Alexandru Basarab (actually a [[pen name]] for Adrian Hoajă), which retold the story of Zalmoxis.

The dinosaur ''[[Zalmoxes]]'' is named after the deity.
