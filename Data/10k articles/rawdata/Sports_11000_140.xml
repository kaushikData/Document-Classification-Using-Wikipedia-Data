[[File:Matten13.jpg|thumb|300px|Material to exercise the balance agility for children]]
'''Agility''' or ''nimbleness'' is the ability to  change the body's [[list of human positions|position]] efficiently, and requires the integration of isolated movement skills using a combination of [[balance (ability)|balance]], [[coordination (physiology)|coordination]], [[speed]], [[reflexes]], [[physical strength|strength]], and [[endurance]]. Agility is the ability to change the direction of the body in an efficient and effective manner and to achieve this requires a combination of
* balance – the ability to maintain equilibrium when stationary or moving (i.e. not to fall over) through the coordinated actions of our sensory functions (eyes, ears and the proprioceptive organs in our joints);
* static balance – the ability to retain the centre of mass above the base of support in a stationary position;
* dynamic balance – the ability to maintain balance with body movement;
* speed - the ability to move all or part of the body quickly;
* strength - the ability of a muscle or muscle group to overcome a resistance; and lastly,
* coordination – the ability to control the movement of the body in co-operation with the body's sensory functions (e.g., in catching a ball [ball, hand, and eye coordination]).

In sports, agility is often defined in terms of an individual sport, due to it being an integration of many components each used differently (specific to all of sorts of different sports). Sheppard and Young (2006) defined agility as a "rapid whole body movement with change of velocity or direction in response to a stimulus".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Agility literature review: classifications, training and testing |author1=J. M. Sheppard |author2=WB Young |journal=Journal of Sports Sciences |date=September 2006 |volume=24 |issue=9 |pages=919-932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agility is also an important attribute in many [[role playing games]], both video games such as [[Pokémon (video game series)|Pokémon]], and tabletop games such as ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]''. Agility may affect the character's ability to evade an enemy's attack or land their own, or pickpocket and pick locks.

'''Byblos Club''' is a multi [[sports]] club based in [[Byblos]], [[Lebanon]]. The franchise was established in 1981, and such notable stars played as [[Jay Youngblood]], [[Michael Fraser]], [[Bassel Bawji]], [[Ali Mahmoud]], [[Rodrigue Akl]], [[Ratko Varda]], [[Steven Burtt]], [[Joseph Vogel]], [[Ziad Abbas]], [[William Pharis]], [[Ndudi Ebi]], and [[Ekenechukwu Ibekwe]] have played for the club throughout its young history.

==Franchise history==
In 2009, Byblos won the Lebanese [[basketball]] Division 3 and qualified for the Division 2. In the following year, Byblos won the Division 2 championship and qualified for the first time for the [[Lebanese Basketball League]] as  part of the [[2010–11 Lebanese Basketball League]] Division 1.

During the 2014-15 FLB Div.A season Byblos Club was named '''UBA''' ('''Union Byblos Amchit''') since [[Amchit Club]]'s basketball team was part of Byblos Club during that season for obligatory financial reasons. The season saw the signing of coach [[Nenad Vucinic]] and the resigning of [[Jay Youngblood]]. UBA finished the season with 8 win and 6 losses, finishing the league in third. During the playoffs they faced the struggling [[Tadamon Zouk]] in a 3-0 swipe, in semi-finals they faced the Lebanese powerhouse Sagesse Beirut, during the playoffs UBA signed [[Ratko Varda]], UBA shocked the Lebanese basketball by swiping Sagesse 4-0 and face Riyadi Beirut in the finals for the first time in their history. the series ended 4-1 to Riyadi Beirut.

The 2015-16 season saw Amchit Basketball club parted ways with Byblos and they were relegated to division 4. Byblos resigned coach Nenad Vucinic and Jay Youngblood, Ali Barada, Ali Kenaan and added [[Steven Burtt]], [[Sherwood Brown]], and [[Bassel Bawji]]. The final game of the Lebanese basketball cup was taking place in Al Chiyah stadium, and Byblos managed to defeat Sagesse to win their first ever trophy while in the first division. The game’s final score was 86-71, with Byblos making a run at the beginning of the fourth quarter to seal the win. Steve Burtt was no doubt the game’s best player, scoring 29 points and leading his team to a second title this season following the Henri Chalhoub Cup!

Byblos and Sagesse faced each other in the cup final, just like they met a week ago in the Henri Chalhoub Tournament Final where Byblos won the game, Byblos defeated Sagesse for the cup and they faced Al Riyadi for super cup against the Lebanese champions. Byblos won the game.

Byblos finished the season 8–7. They entered the playoffs for the sixth straight year. However, they were defeated 3–2 in the quarterfinals of the playoffs by Mouttahed Tripoli, led by Omar Ayoubi.

2016-17 season Byblos finished the season strong with a 13–5 record. In the playoffs, Byblos beat Tadamon Zouk in the quarterfinals of the playoffs and then they faced the defending champions, the Riyadi, who were eliminated 3-1.

The '''circulatory system''', also called the '''cardiovascular system''' or the '''vascular system''', is an [[Biological system|organ system]] that permits [[blood]] to circulate and transport [[nutrient]]s (such as [[amino acids]] and [[electrolytes]]), [[oxygen]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[hormone]]s, and [[blood cell]]s to and from the [[Cell (biology)|cells]] in the body to provide nourishment and help in [[immune system|fighting diseases]],  [[Thermoregulation|stabilize temperature]] and [[pH]], and maintain [[homeostasis]].

The circulatory system includes the [[lymphatic system]], which circulates [[lymph]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{DorlandsDict|nine/000951445|circulatory system}}&lt;/ref&gt; The passage of lymph for example takes much longer than that of blood.&lt;ref name="CRU"&gt;{{cite web|title=Let's beat cancer sooner|url=https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/|publisher=Cancer Research UK|accessdate=April 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blood is a fluid consisting of [[blood plasma|plasma]], [[red blood cell]]s, [[white blood cell]]s, and [[platelets]] that is circulated by the [[heart]] through the vertebrate vascular system, carrying oxygen and nutrients to and waste materials away from all body tissues. Lymph is essentially recycled excess blood plasma after it has been [[capillary filtration|filtered]] from the [[interstitial fluid]] (between cells) and returned to the lymphatic system. The cardiovascular (from Latin words meaning "heart" and "vessel") system comprises the blood, heart, and [[blood vessel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|eight/000105264|cardiovascular system}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lymph, [[lymph node]]s, and [[lymphatic vessel|lymph vessels]] form the lymphatic system, which returns filtered blood plasma from the interstitial fluid (between cells) as lymph.

The circulatory system of the blood is seen as having two components, a systemic circulation and a pulmonary circulation.&lt;ref name="PubMed"&gt;{{cite journal|title=How does the blood circulatory system work?|journal=PubMed Health|date=1 August 2016|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0072434/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While humans, as well as other [[vertebrates]], have a closed cardiovascular system (meaning that the blood never leaves the network of [[arteries]], [[veins]] and [[capillaries]]), some [[invertebrate]] groups have an open cardiovascular system. The lymphatic system, on the other hand, is an open system providing an accessory route for excess interstitial fluid to be returned to the blood.&lt;ref name="Sherwood, Lauralee 2011 401"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sherwood, Lauralee |title=Human Physiology: From Cells to Systems |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I9qH3eZ1pP0C&amp;pg=PT401 |year=2011 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-1-133-10893-1 |pages=401–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more primitive, [[diploblastic]] animal [[phylum|phyla]] lack circulatory systems.

Many diseases affect the circulatory system. This includes [[cardiovascular disease]], affecting the cardiovascular system, and [[lymphatic disease]] affecting the lymphatic system.  [[Cardiologist]]s are medical professionals which specialise in the heart, and [[cardiothoracic surgeon]]s specialise in operating on the heart and its surrounding areas. [[Vascular surgeon]]s focus on other parts of the circulatory system.

==Structure==

===Cardiovascular system===
{{anchor|Human cardiovascular system}}
{{multiple image|align=right|image1=Vein_art_near.png|width1=235|image2=Artery.png|width2=250|caption1=Depiction of the heart, major veins and arteries constructed from body scans.|caption2=Cross section of a human artery}}
[[File:Sankey_diagram_human_circulatory_system.svg|thumb|150px|Relative percentages of cardiac output delivered to major organ systems]]

The essential components of the human cardiovascular system are the [[heart]], [[blood]] and [[blood vessel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{MeshName|Cardiovascular+System}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes the [[pulmonary circulation]], a "loop" through the [[lung]]s where blood is oxygenated; and the systemic circulation, a "loop" through the rest of the body to provide [[oxygenate]]d blood. The systemic circulation can also be seen to function in two parts–a ''macrocirculation'' and a [[microcirculation]]. An average adult contains five to six quarts (roughly 4.7 to 5.7 liters) of blood, accounting for approximately 7% of their total body weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pratt|first=Rebecca|title=Cardiovascular System: Blood|url=https://app.anatomyone.com/systemic/cardiovascular-system/blood|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224023239/https://app.anatomyone.com/systemic/cardiovascular-system/blood|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2017-02-24|work=AnatomyOne|publisher=Amirsys, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blood consists of [[blood plasma|plasma]], [[red blood cells]], [[white blood cells]], and [[platelets]]. Also, the [[digestive system]] works with the circulatory system to provide the nutrients the system needs to keep the [[heart]] pumping.&lt;ref name="Guyton"&gt;{{cite book|title=Guyton Textbook of Medical Physiology|edition=10|author1=Guyton, Arthur  |author2=Hall, John |year=2000|isbn= 072168677X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cardiovascular systems of humans are closed, meaning that the blood never leaves the network of [[blood vessels]]. In contrast, oxygen and nutrients diffuse across the blood vessel layers and enter  [[interstitial fluid]], which carries oxygen and nutrients to the target cells, and carbon dioxide and wastes in the opposite direction. The other component of the circulatory system, the [[lymphatic system]], is open.

====Arteries====

{{See also|Arterial tree}}
Oxygenated blood enters the systemic circulation when leaving the [[left ventricle]], through the [[aortic valve|aortic semilunar valve]]. The first part of the systemic circulation is the [[aorta]], a massive and thick-walled artery. The aorta arches and gives branches supplying the upper part of the body after passing through the aortic opening of the diaphragm at the level of thoracic ten vertebra, it enters the abdomen. Later it descends down and supplies branches to abdomen, pelvis, perineum and the lower limbs. The walls of aorta are elastic. This elasticity helps to maintain the [[blood pressure]] throughout the body. When the aorta receives almost five litres of blood from the heart, it recoils and is responsible for pulsating blood pressure. Moreover, as aorta branches into smaller arteries, their elasticity goes on decreasing and their compliance goes on increasing.

====Capillaries====

Arteries branch into small passages called [[arteriole]]s and then into the [[Capillary|capillaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/hlw/printall-index.html | title =What Are the Lungs? | author =''[[National Institutes of Health]]'' | publisher =nih.gov | date = | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20141004200807/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/hlw/printall-index.html | archivedate =2014-10-04 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The capillaries merge to bring blood into the venous system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://faculty.clintoncc.suny.edu/faculty/michael.gregory/files/bio%20100/Bio%20100%20Lectures/Organ%20Systems/Circulatory%20System/Circulatory%20System.htm | title =The Circulatory System | author =''[[State University of New York]]'' | publisher =suny.edu | date =February 3, 2014 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://archive.is/20140203084650/http://faculty.clintoncc.suny.edu/faculty/michael.gregory/files/bio%20100/Bio%20100%20Lectures/Organ%20Systems/Circulatory%20System/Circulatory%20System.htm | archivedate =February 3, 2014 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Veins====

After their passage through body tissues, capillaries merge once again into [[venule]]s, which continue to merge into [[veins]]. The venous system finally coalesces into two major veins: the [[superior vena cava]] (roughly speaking draining the areas above the heart) and the [[inferior vena cava]] (roughly speaking from areas below the heart). These two great vessels empty into the [[right atrium]] of the [[heart]].

====Coronary vessels====

{{Main|Coronary circulation}}
The heart itself is supplied with oxygen and nutrients through a small "loop" of the systemic circulation and derives very little from the blood contained within the four chambers.

====Portal veins====
{{Main |Portal vein}}

The general rule is that arteries from the heart branch out into capillaries, which collect into veins leading back to the heart. [[Portal vein]]s are a slight exception to this. In humans the only significant example is the [[hepatic portal vein]] which combines from capillaries around the [[gastrointestinal tract]] where the blood absorbs the various products of digestion; rather than leading directly back to the heart, the hepatic portal vein branches into a second capillary system in the [[liver]].

====Heart====
{{Main|Heart}}
[[File:Diagram of the human heart (cropped).svg|250px|thumb|right|View from the front]]
The heart pumps oxygenated blood to the body and deoxygenated blood to the lungs. In the human [[heart]] there is one [[atrium (heart)|atrium]] and one [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]] for each circulation, and with both a systemic and a pulmonary circulation there are four chambers in total: [[left atrium]], [[left ventricle]], [[right atrium]] and [[right ventricle]]. The right atrium is the upper chamber of the right side of the heart. The blood that is returned to the right atrium is deoxygenated (poor in oxygen) and passed into the right ventricle to be pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs for re-oxygenation and removal of carbon dioxide. The left atrium receives newly oxygenated blood from the lungs as well as the pulmonary vein which is passed into the strong left ventricle to be pumped through the aorta to the different organs of the body.

The [[coronary circulation]] system provides a blood supply to the [[myocardium|heart muscle]] itself. The coronary circulation begins near the origin of the [[aorta]] by two [[coronary arteries]]: the [[right coronary artery]] and the [[left coronary artery]]. After nourishing the heart muscle, blood returns through the coronary veins into the [[coronary sinus]] and from this one into the right atrium. Back flow of blood through its opening during [[atrial systole]] is prevented by the [[Thebesian valve]]. The [[smallest cardiac veins]] drain directly into the heart chambers.&lt;ref name="Guyton"/&gt;
{{Clear}}

====Lungs====
[[File:2119 Pulmonary Circuit.jpg|thumb|370px|right|The pulmonary circulation as it passes from the heart. Showing both the [[pulmonary artery|pulmonary]] and [[bronchial artery|bronchial arteries]].]]
{{Main|Pulmonary circulation}}
The [[pulmonary circulation|circulatory system of the lungs]] is the portion of the cardiovascular system in which [[oxygen]]-depleted [[blood]] is pumped away from the heart, via the [[pulmonary artery]], to the [[lungs]] and returned, oxygenated, to the heart via the [[pulmonary vein]].

Oxygen deprived blood from the superior and inferior [[vena cava]] enters the right atrium of the heart and flows through the [[tricuspid valve]] (right atrioventricular valve) into the right ventricle, from which it is then pumped through the [[pulmonary semilunar valve]] into the pulmonary artery to the lungs. [[Gas exchange]] occurs in the lungs, whereby {{CO2|link=yes}} is released from the blood, and oxygen is absorbed. The pulmonary vein returns the now oxygen-rich blood to the [[left atrium]].&lt;ref name="Guyton"/&gt;

A separate system known as the [[bronchial circulation]] supplies blood to the tissue of the larger airways of the lung.

====Systemic circulation====
[[File:2101 Blood Flow Through the Heart.jpg|thumb|left|350px|The systemic circulation and capillary networks shown and also as separate from the pulmonary circulation]]
Systemic circulation is the portion of the cardiovascular system which transports oxygenated blood away from the heart through the aorta from the left ventricle where the blood has been previously deposited from pulmonary circulation, to the rest of the body, and returns oxygen-depleted blood back to the heart.&lt;ref name="Guyton"/&gt;

====Brain====
{{Main|Cerebral circulation}}
The brain has a dual blood supply that comes from arteries at its front and back. These are called the "anterior" and "posterior" circulation respectively. The anterior circulation arises from the [[internal carotid artery|internal carotid arteries]] and supplies the front of the brain. The posterior circulation arises from the [[vertebral artery|vertebral arteries]], and supplies the back of the brain and [[brainstem]]. The circulation from the front and the back join together ([[anastomise]]) at the [[Circle of Willis]].

====Kidneys====
The [[renal circulation]] receives around 20% of the cardiac output. It branches from the [[abdominal aorta]] and returns blood to the ascending [[vena cava]]. It is the blood supply to the [[kidney]]s, and contains many specialized blood vessels.

===Lymphatic system===
{{Main|Lymphatic system}}
The [[lymphatic system]] is part of the circulatory system. It is a network of [[lymphatic vessel]]s and [[lymph capillaries]], [[lymph nodes]] and [[lymphatic organs|organs]], and [[lymphatic tissues]] and circulating [[lymph]]. One of its major functions is to carry the lymph, draining and returning [[interstitial fluid]] back towards the heart for return to the cardiovascular system, by emptying into the [[lymphatic duct]]s. Its other main function is in the [[adaptive immune system]].&lt;ref name=Alberts&gt;{{cite book | last1= Alberts |first1=B. |last2=Johnson |first2=A. |last3=Lewis |first3=J. |last4=Raff |first4=M. |last5=Roberts |first5=K. |last6= Walters |first6=P. | title = Molecular Biology of the Cell |edition =4th | publisher = Garland Science| year = 2002 | location = New York and London | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&amp;rid=mboc4.TOC&amp;depth=2 | isbn = 0-8153-3218-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
{{Main|Fetal circulation}}

The development of the circulatory system starts with [[vasculogenesis]] in the [[embryo]]. The human arterial and venous systems develop from different areas in the embryo. The arterial system develops mainly from the [[aortic arches]], six pairs of arches which develop on the upper part of the embryo. The venous system arises from three bilateral veins during weeks 4&amp;nbsp;– 8 of [[Human embryogenesis|embryogenesis]]. [[Fetal circulation]] begins within the 8th week of development. Fetal circulation does not include the lungs, which are bypassed via the [[truncus arteriosus]]. Before birth the [[fetus]] obtains [[oxygen]] (and [[nutrient]]s) from the mother through the [[placenta]] and the [[umbilical cord]].&lt;ref name="Whitaker"&gt;{{cite book |last=Whitaker |first=Kent |chapter=Fetal Circulation |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=R3WK8XyAHYgC&amp;pg=PA18 |title=Comprehensive Perinatal and Pediatric Respiratory Care |publisher=Delmar Thomson Learning |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-7668-1373-1 |pages=18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heart===
{{Main|Heart development}}

===Arteries===
{{Main|Aortic arches}}
The human arterial system originates from the aortic arches and from the [[dorsal aortae]] starting from week 4 of embryonic life. The first and second aortic arches regress and forms only the [[maxillary artery|maxillary arteries]] and [[stapedial artery|stapedial arteries]] respectively. The arterial system itself arises from aortic arches 3, 4 and 6 (aortic arch 5 completely regresses).

The dorsal aortae, present on the [[:wikt:dorsal|dorsal]] side of the embryo, are initially present on both sides of the embryo. They later fuse to form the basis for the [[aorta]] itself. Approximately thirty smaller arteries branch from this at the back and sides. These branches form the [[intercostal arteries]], arteries of the arms and legs, lumbar arteries and the lateral sacral arteries. Branches to the sides of the aorta will form the definitive [[renal artery|renal]], [[Inferior suprarenal artery|suprarenal]] and [[gonadal artery|gonadal arteries]]. Finally, branches at the front of the aorta consist of the [[vitelline arteries]] and [[umbilical arteries]]. The vitelline arteries form the [[celiac artery|celiac]], [[superior mesenteric artery|superior]] and [[inferior mesenteric artery|inferior mesenteric arteries]] of the gastrointestinal tract. After birth, the umbilical arteries will form the [[internal iliac artery|internal iliac arteries]].

===Veins===

The human venous system develops mainly from the [[vitelline vein]]s, the [[umbilical vein]]s and the [[Posterior cardinal vein|cardinal veins]], all of which empty into the [[sinus venosus]].

==Function==
===Cardiovascular system===
[[File:Erytrocyte deoxy to oxy v0.7.gif|thumb|Animation of a typical human red blood cell cycle in the circulatory system. This animation occurs at a faster rate (~20 seconds of the average [[Red blood cell#Human erythrocytes|60-second cycle]]) and shows the red blood cell deforming as it enters capillaries, as well as the bars changing color as the cell alternates in states of oxygenation along the circulatory system.]]
{{Main|Blood#Oxygen transport}}
About 98.5% of the [[oxygen]] in a sample of arterial blood in a healthy human, breathing air at sea-level pressure, is chemically combined with [[hemoglobin]] molecules. About 1.5% is physically dissolved in the other blood liquids and not connected to hemoglobin. The hemoglobin molecule is the primary transporter of oxygen in [[mammal]]s and many other species.

===Lymphatic system===
{{Main|Lymphatic system#Function}}

==Clinical significance==
{{anchor|Health and disease}}
Many diseases affect the circulatory system. These include a number of [[cardiovascular disease]]s, affecting the cardiovascular system, and [[lymphatic disease]]s affecting the lymphatic system.  [[Cardiologist]]s are medical professionals which specialise in the heart, and [[cardiothoracic surgeon]]s specialise in operating on the heart and its surrounding areas. [[Vascular surgeon]]s focus on other parts of the circulatory system.

===Cardiovascular disease===
{{Main|Cardiovascular disease}}
Diseases affecting the cardiovascular system are called [[cardiovascular disease]].

Many of these diseases are called "[[lifestyle disease]]s" because they develop over time and are related to a person's exercise habits, diet, whether they smoke, and other lifestyle choices a person makes. [[Atherosclerosis]] is the precursor to many of these diseases. It is where small [[atheroma|atheromatous plaque]]s build up in the walls of medium and large arteries. This may eventually grow or rupture to occlude the arteries. It is also a risk factor for [[acute coronary syndrome]]s, which are diseases which are characterised by a sudden deficit of oxygenated blood to the heart tissue. Atherosclerosis is also associated with problems such as [[aneurysm]] formation or splitting ("dissection") of arteries.

Another major cardiovascular disease involves the creation of a [[thrombus|clot, called a "thrombus"]]. These can originate in veins or arteries. [[Deep venous thrombosis]], which mostly occurs in the legs, is one cause of clots in the veins of the legs, particularly when a person has been stationary for a long time. These clots may [[embolus|embolise]], meaning travel to another location in the body. The results of this may include [[pulmonary embolus]], [[transient ischaemic attack]]s, or [[stroke]].

Cardiovascular diseases may also be congenital in nature, such as [[Congenital heart defect|heart defects]] or [[persistent fetal circulation]], where the circulatory changes that are supposed to happen after birth do not. Not all congenital changes to the circulatory system are associated with diseases, a large number are [[anatomical variation]]s.

===Investigations===
[[File:Arteria-lusoria MRA MIP.gif|thumb|[[Magnetic resonance angiography]] of [[aberrant subclavian artery]]]]
The function and health of the circulatory system and its parts are measured in a variety of manual and automated ways. These include simple methods such as those that are part of the [[cardiovascular examination]], including the taking of a person's [[pulse]] as an indicator of a person's [[heart rate]], the taking of [[blood pressure]] through a [[sphygmomanometer]] or the use of a [[stethoscope]] to listen to the heart for [[cardiac murmur|murmur]]s which may indicate problems with the [[heart valve|heart's valves]]. An [[electrocardiogram]] can also be used to evaluate the way in which electricity is conducted through the heart.

Other more invasive means can also be used. A [[cannula]] or [[catheter]] inserted into an artery may be used to measure [[pulse pressure]] or [[pulmonary wedge pressure]]s. Angiography, which involves injecting a dye into an artery to visualise an arterial tree, can be used in the heart ([[coronary angiography]]) or brain. At the same time as the arteries are visualised, blockages or narrowings may be fixed through the insertion of [[stent]]s, and active bleeds may be managed by the insertion of coils. An MRI may be used to image arteries, called an [[magnetic resonance angiography|MRI angiogram]]. For evaluation of the blood supply to the lungs a [[CT pulmonary angiogram]] may be used.

[[Medical ultrasound#Angiology (vascular)|Vascular ultrasonography]] include for example:
*[[Intravascular ultrasound]]
*[[Ultrasonography of deep venous thrombosis]]
*[[Ultrasonography of chronic venous insufficiency of the legs]]

===Surgery===
{{expand section|date=March 2015}}
There are a number of surgical procedures performed on the circulatory system:
* [[Coronary artery bypass surgery]]
* [[Coronary stent]] used in [[angioplasty]]
* [[Vascular surgery]]
* [[Vein stripping]]
* Cosmetic procedures

Cardiovascular procedures are more likely to be performed in an inpatient setting than in an ambulatory care setting; in the United States, only 28% of cardiovascular surgeries were performed in the ambulatory care setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Wier LM, Steiner CA, Owens PL | title = Surgeries in Hospital-Owned Outpatient Facilities, 2012 | work = HCUP Statistical Brief #188 | publisher = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality | location = Rockville, MD | date = April 17, 2015 | url =http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb188-Surgeries-Hospital-Outpatient-Facilities-2012.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While humans, as well as other [[vertebrates]], have a closed cardiovascular system (meaning that the blood never leaves the network of [[arteries]], [[veins]] and [[capillaries]]), some [[invertebrate]] groups have an open cardiovascular system. The lymphatic system, on the other hand, is an open system providing an accessory route for excess interstitial fluid to be returned to the blood.&lt;ref name="Sherwood, Lauralee 2011 401"/&gt; The more primitive, [[diploblastic]] animal [[phylum|phyla]] lack circulatory systems.

The blood vascular system first appeared probably in an ancestor of the [[triploblasts]] over 600 million years ago, overcoming the time-distance constraints of diffusion, while [[endothelium]] evolved in an ancestral [[vertebrate]] some 540–510 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Monahan‐Earley, R., Dvorak, A. M., &amp; Aird, W. C. (2013). Evolutionary origins of the blood vascular system and endothelium. ''Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis'' 11 (s1): 46-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open circulatory system===
{{See also|Hemolymph}}
[[File:Open Circulatroy.gif|thumb|The open circulatory system of the grasshopper – made up of a heart, vessels and hemolymph. The hemolymph is pumped through the heart, into the aorta, dispersed into the head and throughout the hemocoel, then back through the ostia in the heart and the process repeated.]]

In [[arthropod]]s, the open circulatory system is a system in which a fluid in a cavity called the hemocoel bathes the organs directly with oxygen and nutrients and there is no distinction between [[blood]] and [[interstitial fluid]]; this combined fluid is called [[hemolymph]] or haemolymph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bailey|first=Regina|title=Circulatory System|url=http://biology.about.com/od/organsystems/a/circulatorysystem.htm|work=biology.about.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Muscular movements by the animal during [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]] can facilitate hemolymph movement, but diverting flow from one area to another is limited. When the [[heart]] relaxes, blood is drawn back toward the heart through open-ended pores (ostia).

Hemolymph fills all of the interior hemocoel of the body and surrounds all [[cell (biology)|cell]]s. Hemolymph is composed of [[water]], [[inorganic chemistry|inorganic]] [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]]s (mostly [[sodium]], [[chlorine]], [[potassium]], [[magnesium]], and [[calcium]]), and [[organic chemistry|organic compounds]] (mostly [[carbohydrate]]s, [[protein]]s, and [[lipid]]s). The primary oxygen transporter molecule is [[hemocyanin]].

There are free-floating cells, the [[hemocyte]]s, within the hemolymph. They play a role in the arthropod [[immune system]].

[[File:Pseudoceros bifurcus - Blue Pseudoceros Flatworm.jpg|thumb|left|Flatworms, such as this ''[[Pseudoceros bifurcus]]'', lack specialized circulatory organs]]

===Closed circulatory system===
[[File:Two chamber heart.svg|thumb|left|Two-chambered heart of a fish]]

The circulatory systems of all [[vertebrate]]s, as well as of [[annelid]]s (for example, [[earthworm]]s) and [[cephalopod]]s ([[squid]]s, [[octopus]]es and relatives) are ''closed'', just as in humans. Still, the systems of [[fish]], [[amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s, and [[bird]]s show various stages of the [[evolution]] of the circulatory system.&lt;ref&gt;Simões-Costa MS, et al. 2005. The evolutionary origin of cardiac chambers. ''Dev. Biol.'' 277: 1–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fish, the system has only one circuit, with the blood being pumped through the capillaries of the [[gill]]s and on to the capillaries of the body tissues. This is known as ''single cycle'' circulation. The heart of fish is, therefore, only a single pump (consisting of two chambers).

In amphibians and most reptiles, a double circulatory system is used, but the heart is not always completely separated into two pumps. Amphibians have a three-chambered heart.

In reptiles, the [[ventricular septum]] of the heart is incomplete and the [[pulmonary artery]] is equipped with a [[sphincter muscle]]. This allows a second possible route of blood flow. Instead of blood flowing through the pulmonary artery to the lungs, the sphincter may be contracted to divert this blood flow through the incomplete ventricular septum into the [[left ventricle]] and out through the [[aorta]]. This means the blood flows from the capillaries to the heart and back to the capillaries instead of to the lungs. This process is useful to [[ectothermic]] (cold-blooded) animals in the regulation of their body temperature.

Birds, mammals, and [[crocodilia]]ns show complete separation of the heart into two pumps, for a total of four heart chambers; it is thought that the four-chambered heart of birds and crocodilians evolved independently from that of mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Crocodilian Hearts | date=October 24, 2008 | accessdate=October 3, 2015 | website=National Center for Science Education | url=http://ncse.com/creationism/analysis/crocodilian-hearts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===No circulatory system===
Circulatory systems are absent in some animals, including [[flatworm]]s. Their [[body cavity]] has no lining or enclosed fluid. Instead a muscular [[pharynx]] leads to an extensively branched [[digestive system]] that facilitates direct [[diffusion]] of nutrients to all cells. The flatworm's dorso-ventrally flattened body shape also restricts the distance of any cell from the digestive system or the exterior of the organism. [[Oxygen]] can diffuse from the surrounding [[water]] into the cells, and [[carbon dioxide]] can diffuse out. Consequently, every cell is able to obtain nutrients, water and oxygen without the need of a transport system.

Some animals, such as [[jellyfish]], have more extensive branching from their [[gastrovascular cavity]] (which functions as both a place of digestion and a form of circulation), this branching allows for bodily fluids to reach the outer layers, since the digestion begins in the inner layers.

"Epitome", fol.14a. HMD Collection, WZ 240 V575dhZ 1543.]]
The earliest known writings on the circulatory system are found in the [[Ebers Papyrus]] (16th century BCE), an [[Ancient Egyptian medicine|ancient Egyptian medical papyrus]] containing over 700 prescriptions and remedies, both physical and spiritual. In the [[papyrus]], it acknowledges the connection of the heart to the arteries. The Egyptians thought air came in through the mouth and into the lungs and heart. From the heart, the air travelled to every member through the arteries. Although this concept of the circulatory system is only partially correct, it represents one of the earliest accounts of scientific thought.

In the 6th century BCE, the knowledge of circulation of vital fluids through the body was known to the [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] physician [[Sushruta]] in [[History of India|ancient India]].&lt;ref name=Dwivedi&amp;Dwivedi07/&gt; He also seems to have possessed knowledge of the [[arteries]], described as 'channels' by Dwivedi &amp; Dwivedi (2007).&lt;ref name=Dwivedi&amp;Dwivedi07&gt;Dwivedi, Girish &amp; Dwivedi, Shridhar (2007).

However their function was not properly understood then. Because blood pools in the veins after death, arteries look empty. Ancient anatomists assumed they were filled with air and that they were for transport of air.

The [[Ancient Greek Medicine|Greek physician]], [[Herophilus]], distinguished veins from arteries but thought that the [[pulse]] was a property of arteries themselves. Greek anatomist [[Erasistratus]] observed that arteries that were cut during life bleed. He ascribed the fact to the phenomenon that air escaping from an artery is replaced with blood that entered by very small vessels between veins and arteries. Thus he apparently postulated capillaries but with reversed flow of blood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scienceclarified.com/Al-As/Anatomy.html Anatomy&amp;nbsp;– History of anatomy]. Scienceclarified.com. Retrieved 2013-09-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2nd century AD [[Rome]], the [[Ancient Greek Medicine|Greek]] physician [[Galen]] knew that blood vessels carried blood and identified venous (dark red) and arterial (brighter and thinner) blood, each with distinct and separate functions. Growth and energy were derived from venous blood created in the liver from chyle, while arterial blood gave vitality by containing pneuma (air) and originated in the heart. Blood flowed from both creating organs to all parts of the body where it was consumed and there was no return of blood to the heart or liver. The heart did not pump blood around, the heart's motion sucked blood in during diastole and the blood moved by the pulsation of the arteries themselves.

Galen believed that the arterial blood was created by venous blood passing from the left ventricle to the right by passing through 'pores' in the interventricular septum, air passed from the lungs via the pulmonary artery to the left side of the heart. As the arterial blood was created 'sooty' vapors were created and passed to the lungs also via the pulmonary artery to be exhaled.

In 1025, ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'' by the [[Ancient Iranian Medicine|Persian physician]], [[Avicenna]], "erroneously accepted the Greek notion regarding the existence of a hole in the ventricular septum by which the blood traveled between the ventricles." Despite this, Avicenna "correctly wrote on the [[cardiac cycle]]s and valvular function", and "had a vision of blood circulation" in his ''Treatise on Pulse''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Thus, expansion : pause : contraction : pause. [...] The pulse is a movement in the heart and arteries ... which takes the form of alternate expansion and contraction."&lt;ref name=Hajar&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hajar, Rachel|year=1999|title=The Greco-Islamic Pulse|journal=Heart Views|volume=1|issue=4|pages=136–140 [138]|url=http://www.arjournals.info/jourarticle.php?art_id=20237|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109102450/http://www.arjournals.info/jourarticle.php?art_id=20237|archivedate=2014-01-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1242, the [[Medicine in medieval Islam|Arabian physician]], [[Ibn al-Nafis]], became the first person to accurately describe the process of [[pulmonary circulation]], for which he is sometimes considered the father of [[Cardiovascular physiology|circulatory physiology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reflections | first1 = Chairman's | year = 2004 | title = Traditional Medicine Among Gulf Arabs, Part II: Blood-letting | url = http://www.hmc.org.qa/heartviews/VOL5NO2/special_section.htm | journal = Heart Views | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 74–85 [80] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070911211305/http://www.hmc.org.qa/heartviews/VOL5NO2/special_section.htm | archivedate = 2007-09-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2010}} Ibn al-Nafis stated in his ''Commentary on Anatomy in Avicenna's Canon'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...the blood from the right chamber of the heart must arrive at the left chamber but there is no direct pathway between them. The thick septum of the heart is not perforated and does not have visible pores as some people thought or invisible pores as Galen thought. The blood from the right chamber must flow through the vena arteriosa ([[pulmonary artery]]) to the lungs, spread through its substances, be mingled there with air, pass through the arteria venosa ([[pulmonary vein]]) to reach the left chamber of the heart and there form the vital spirit..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition, Ibn al-Nafis had an insight into what would become a larger theory of the [[capillary]] circulation. He stated that "there must be small communications or pores (''manafidh'' in Arabic) between the pulmonary artery and vein," a prediction that preceded the discovery of the capillary system by more than 400 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn al-Nafis' theory, however, was confined to blood transit in the lungs and did not extend to the entire body.

[[Michael Servetus]] was the first European to describe the function of pulmonary circulation, although his achievement was not widely recognized at the time, for a few reasons. He firstly described it in the "Manuscript of Paris"&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez Etxeberria, Patxi (2011) ''Amor a la verdad, el&amp;nbsp;– vida y obra de Miguel servet'' [''The love for truth. Life and work of Michael Servetus''].

And later he published  this description, but in a theological treatise, ''Christianismi Restitutio'', not in a book on medicine. Only three copies of the book survived but these remained hidden for decades, the rest were burned  shortly after its publication in 1553 because of persecution of Servetus by religious authorities.

Better known discovery of pulmonary circulation was by [[Vesalius]]'s successor at [[University of Padua|Padua]], [[Realdo Colombo]], in 1559.

[[File:William Harvey ( 1578-1657) Venenbild.jpg|thumb|Image of veins from [[William Harvey]]'s ''Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus'', 1628]]

Finally, [[William Harvey]], a pupil of [[Hieronymus Fabricius]] (who had earlier described the valves of the veins without recognizing their function), performed a sequence of experiments, and published ''Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus'' in 1628, which "demonstrated that there had to be a direct connection between the venous and arterial systems throughout the body, and not just the lungs. Most importantly, he argued that the beat of the heart produced a continuous circulation of blood through minute connections at the extremities of the body. This is a conceptual leap that was quite different from Ibn al-Nafis' refinement of the anatomy and bloodflow in the heart and lungs."&lt;ref&gt;Pormann, Peter E. and Smith, E. Savage (2007) ''Medieval Islamic medicine'' Georgetown University, Washington DC, p. 48, {{ISBN|1589011619}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This work, with its essentially correct exposition, slowly convinced the medical world. However, Harvey was not able to identify the capillary system connecting arteries and veins; these were later discovered by [[Marcello Malpighi]] in 1661.

In 1956, [[André Frédéric Cournand]], [[Werner Forssmann]] and [[Dickinson W. Richards]] were awarded the [[List of Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] in Medicine "for their discoveries concerning [[heart catheterization]] and pathological changes in the circulatory system."&lt;ref&gt;

In his Nobel lecture, Forssmann credits Harvey as birthing cardiology with the publication of his book in 1628.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1956/forssmann-lecture.html|title=The Role of Heart Catheterization and Angiocardiography in the Development of Modern Medicine|accessdate=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conrad Earnest''' (born December 20, 1957) is a retired American [[Association football|soccer]] [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] and well respected [[exercise physiologist]]. He spent two seasons in the [[American Soccer League (1933-1983)|American Soccer League]].

Earnest began playing soccer at the age of 16. Within two years he earned high school All New York State/All-American status.  He began playing collegiate soccer at [[Ulster County Community College]] winning the Junior College National Championship in his second year. Earnest then attended the [[University of Akron]]. During his time at Akron, Earnest was twice awarded NCAA Division I player of the week honors.

Following college, he played in the [[American Soccer League (1933-1983)|American Soccer League]] with the [[New York Eagles]] and the [[Cleveland Cobras]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gozips.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10800&amp;ATCLID=323406 Zips in the Pros] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522092348/http://www.gozips.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10800&amp;ATCLID=323406 |date=2011-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He later returned to the University of Akron where he earned his master's degree in exercise science.  He completed his education after receiving a Ph.D.in Exercise Physiology from [[Texas Woman's University]].  After working for several years at the [[Cooper Institute]] in Dallas, Texas, he became the Director of Exercise Biology&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbrc.edu/About_Us/The_Explorers/Faculty_Bio.asp?EmployeeID=3336]&lt;/ref&gt; at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

Overall, the focus of his scientific research centers on the benefits of exercise in clinical patients at risk for or present with various metabolic diseases. In addition, he has published a variety of studies examining the use of nutritional supplements aimed at improving sports performance, as well as different health outcomes. With respect to the high performance athlete, Earnest has published several notable papers with colleagues from Spain examining the physiologic characteristics of professional cyclists competing in the three-week Grand Tours of cycling: The [[Tour de France]], [[Giro d'Italia]], and the [[Vuelta a España]].

'''Craven Park''' (known as '''KCOM Craven Park''' for sponsorship reasons) and also referred to as '''New Craven Park''' is the home of [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] R.F.C. It is situated on Preston Road in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[East Riding of Yorkshire]], England.

==History==
Hull Kingston Rovers moved to the new ground in 1989 from the [[Old Craven Park]] which was sited on Holderness Road.&lt;ref name="Ground guide – Lightstream Stadium"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loverugbyleague.com/club/hull-kr/ground-guide/|title=Ground guide – Lightstream Stadium|publisher=Love Rugby League.com|accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was the former home to the [[Hull Vikings]] [[Motorcycle speedway|speedway]] team, but they left when the ground was refurbished for Hull Kingston Rovers use in the [[Super League]]. The first match was played against [[Blackpool Borough|Trafford Borough]] packing in a full capacity 8,500 crowd to watch. Rovers convincingly started the new era, and in that season were crowned Division Two champions.&lt;ref name="Club Honours"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hullkr.co.uk/club/honours|title=Club Honours|publisher=Hull Kingston Rovers|accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the ground and pitch were substantially improved as the club sought a return to the top flight of English [[rugby league]]. Plans for Hull Kingston Rovers to move from Craven Park to a new purpose-built rugby league stadium to be constructed at a new, unconfirmed site were suggested in 2007, but shortly after this, Hull City Council, in partnership with Kingston Community Developments Limited and [[Hull Kingston Rovers]], announced that terms for lease agreements had been reached to support the long-term future of Craven Park. These terms enabled investment and development of the stadium to move forward.

The initial phase of redeveloping Craven Park was the lease purchase of a temporary seated stand which replaced the use of the inadequate south terrace for visiting away fans. Hull Kingston Rovers' second season in [[Super League]] coincided with work beginning on the extension of the standing terraced East Stand. This extension increased the capacity of the stand by 1,120 bringing its overall capacity to 4,750. A similar extension to the opposite end of the stand was completed in 2009.

A new purpose built South Stand is likely to house away supporters. This would allow the new North Stand to be used by home fans. A new South Stand is likely to have a capacity of around 2,500 with facilities that will take the club forward. Designs are yet to be announced, but it is likely to be a terraced stand. An extension to the East Stand and a new purpose built South Stand will take the grounds capacity to 14,500, which would see Craven Park become the 5th largest ground in Super League.

On Good Friday 2018 a new Craven Park attendance record was set, beating the previous record of just under 12,000 against Leeds Rhinos. 12,090 packed into the stadium to witness cross city rivals Hull FC beat the Robins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/43560136|title=Super League: Hull KR 22-30 Hull FC|date=30 March 2018|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colin Hutton North Stand===

[[File:Colin Hutton North Stand.jpg|thumb|Colin Hutton North Stand.]]
'''Capacity- 2,600 (seated)'''&lt;br /&gt;
The North Stand was originally a temporary stand that was erected after the ground ceased being used as an athletic venue. In 2013, the new £8 million Colin Hutton North Stand opened for the [[2013 Rugby League World Cup]] game between [[Papua New Guinea national rugby league team|Papua New Guinea]] and [[France national rugby league team|France]]. The North Stand also deliver an Enterprise Business Centre and Training Centre. There are 42 fully furnished offices which make up the Enterprise Units, all of which are located on different floors within the North Stand.

===Roger Millward West Stand===

'''Capacity- 5,000 (seated)'''&lt;br /&gt;
The West Stand includes the main seated stand a small terraced area below executive boxes, which holds around 500 fans. The stand houses the stadium's main changing rooms that were redeveloped before the 2014 season to improve the size and facilities of the changing room. Inside the stand there is the Robins Nest &amp; Harry Poole bar for home and away fans. This is a restaurant with pitch side views and exclusive player and coach interviews after a match. The stand also houses the TV gantry.

===Joinery Depot East Stand===

'''Capacity- (standing)'''&lt;br /&gt;
The East Stand is considered the [[Spion Kop (stadiums)|Kop]] end of the ground and is covered terrace that runs almost the full length of the pitch. The right side was extended in 2008, and the left side is due for future expansion, although no date has been given.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/hull-kr-east-stand-extension-ready-start/story-11944716-detail/story.html|title=Hull KR: East stand extension ready to start|date=22 April 2010|work=Hull Daily Mail|accessdate=5 February 2017}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Capacity-  (standing)'''&lt;br /&gt;
There is currently a small stand in the south end of the ground that goes around where the greyhound track was. While the stand has fallen out of usage, it is opened up for games with high attendance, for example, derby games. Future plans are to build a permanent stand behind the sticks for away fans.

==Naming rights==
On 25 January 2014, Hull Kingston Rovers announced that it had secured a new stadium naming rights partnership with local communications provider, [[KCOM Group|KC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/Hull-KR-Craven-Park-KC-Lightstream-Stadium/story-20495047-detail/story.html|title=Hull KR: Craven Park becomes KC Lightstream Stadium|date=24 January 2014|work=Hull Daily Mail|accessdate=25 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140126153239/http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/Hull-KR-Craven-Park-KC-Lightstream-Stadium/story-20495047-detail/story.html|archivedate=26 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under a five-year agreement, Craven Park was renamed the '''KC Lightstream Stadium''' (following re-branding, it became the '''KCOM Lightstream Stadium'''), not to be confused with the ''[[KCOM Stadium]]'' in the west of the city. On 3 February 2017, it was renamed again, and is now known as '''KCOM Craven Park'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/hull-kr-s-lightstream-stadium-to-be-renamed-kcom-craven-park/story-30107101-detail/story.html|title=Hull KR's Lightstream Stadium to be renamed KCOM Craven Park|date=2 February 2017|work=Hull Daily Mail|accessdate=3 February 2017}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Multisport Club Association''' ('''EMCA''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/sport/events/2014/documents/eusf-agenda.pdf Monday, 1 December 2014 / Session 6: Multi-sport clubs] [[European Commission]]&lt;/ref&gt; is a sports organization representing the interests of [[multisport club]]s in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.it/universiadi-mondo/industria-sport-verso-una_b_5190060.html Industria &amp; Sport: verso una nuova stagione europea?] [[The Huffington Post#International editions|L'Huffington Post]] {{it}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created with an initiative of the multisport club [[S.S. Lazio]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://brusselsdiplomatic.com/2013/01/09/ss-lazio-brings-top-multisports-clubs-together-at-iic-bruxelles/ SS LAZIO BRINGS TOP MULTISPORTS CLUBS TOGETHER AT IIC BRUXELLES] brusselsdiplomatic.com&lt;/ref&gt;

EMCA is also a partner of the House of Sport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fesi-sport.org/content/grand-opening-house-sport-%E2%80%93-joining-forces-winning-big Grand opening of the House of Sport – Joining forces for winning big!] [[Federation of the European Sporting Goods Industry|FESI]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
The aim is the development and dissemination of sports, as a mean of psycho-physical and moral integrity, promoting the activities of the affiliated sports clubs operating on European scale and organizing projects, erasmus trips and events for the exchange of good practice, sports promotion, maintenance of the human body in shape and entertainment youth activities. Particular attention is given at the fight against doping, intolerance and violence, access to sport for people with disabilities, social inclusion of immigrants and gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.multisportclubs.eu/about/|title=About EMCA - EMCA|work=EMCA|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the European sport system a significant role is played by multisport clubs, who – through their multiple involvement on a large variety of sports – understand better than anyone else the different social dimensions, impacts and needs of sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.multisportclubs.eu/|title=European Multisport Club Association - EMCA|website=EMCA|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Projects'''

EMCA organizes projects in association with erasmus trips, to promote, the Olympic Spirit, spread of values and civic behaviour, importance of physical activity, voluntary activities,  integration of young refugees, multisport approach of young athletes and to report fraud, bribery, abuse, bullying and manipulated illegal sport betting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.multisportclubs.eu/emca-projects/|title=Projects - EMCA|work=EMCA|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, particular interest represents the acquisition of new knowledge and skills, through teaching and education, for multisport coaches' development, helping kids choose the most suitable sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.multisportclubs.eu/emcastudia/|title=EMCA Studia - EMCA|work=EMCA|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, Obetz purchased the [[Columbus Motor Speedway]]. Obetz developed it into a community asset to host concerts, farmers’ markets, trade shows, sporting events including rugby, festivals, and other community activities. This 50 acre, $15 million project was completed in the fall of 2017. The first event was held on May 6, 2017, for the first home game of the Machine against the [[Rochester Rattlers]].&lt;ref name="machine"&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Ohio Machine Announce New Stadium, Obetz Fortress Field |url=https://www.theohiomachine.com/articles/ohio-machine-announce-new-stadium-obetz-fortress-field |location=Obetz, Ohio |publisher=The Ohio Machine |date=November 17, 2016 |access-date=2017-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fortress Obetz also hosted the high school football game between [[Hamilton Township High School|Hamilton Township]] and [[Groveport Madison High School|Groveport Madison]] on August 31, 2017.

In its inaugural year (2017), Fortress Obetz held events such as the annual [[Obetz, Ohio|Obetz Zucchinifest]] and Fashion Meets Music Festival.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="597">A '''give-and-go''', or '''one-two''', is a fundamental maneuver in many [[team sports]] which involves two players passing the [[Ball#Different_types_of_balls|ball]] or [[hockey puck|puck]] back and forth.  The player who has the ball or puck passes to a teammate and then repositions in order to receive a return pass and a scoring opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/give-and-go give-and-go - definition] at the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Indian cricket team]] made its [[Test cricket]] debut in 1931 and has since advanced to be among the top four test teams in the [[ICC Test Championship|ICC rankings]] in each of 2005 to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;ICC website: [http://icc-cricket.yahoo.com/rankings/rankings-test-2005.html 2005] [http://icc-cricket.yahoo.com/rankings/rankings-test-2006.html 2006] [http://icc-cricket.yahoo.com/rankings/rankings-test-2007.html 2007] [http://icc-cricket.yahoo.com/rankings/rankings-test-2008.html 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; The team won the [[One Day International|ODI]] [[Cricket World Cup]] in [[1983 Cricket World Cup|1983]] and [[2011 Cricket World Cup|2011]]. In other major International victories, Team India won the inaugural [[ICC World Twenty20|Twenty20 World Cup]] in [[2007 ICC World Twenty20|2007]] and [[ICC Champions Trophy]] in [[2013 ICC Champions Trophy|2013]].

==Pre-independence==

[[Image:Ranjitsinh.jpeg|thumb|120px|right|Kumar Shri Ranjitsinhji was an Indian who played for the English cricket team]]
A few Indians played as members of the [[English cricket team]] while India was under [[British India|British rule]], including [[Ranjitsinhji]] and [[KS Duleepsinhji]], but India made its debut as a Test-cricket-playing-nation in England in 1932 led by [[CK Nayudu]], well before [[Partition of India|Indian independence]]. The team performed well, with [[Mohammad Nissar]] taking 5-93 and 1-42 in the match against England.&lt;!--non-cricket playing nation's readers wont understand 5-93 and 1-42.  for conceding 93 etc, or wikilink to where this pattern of score is explained.--&gt; The match was given test status despite being only 3 days in length. England, batting first, scored 258 with Nissar cleaning up the openers and tailenders. However the Indian team failed to capitalize on their bowling performance, all out for 189 with [[CK Nayudu]] the top scorer with 40 runs. England went on to score 275 and set India a target of 346, which always seemed out of the visitor's grasp. India were all out for 187 and lost by 158 runs.

The team's first series as an independent country was in 1948 against [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] at [[Brisbane]]. Australia were led by [[Sir Don Bradman]] while India was led by [[Lala Amarnath]]. The Australians returned home, winning the 5 Test series with the score 4-0.

==Post Independence==
India's first ever Test victory came against England at [[Chennai|Madras]] in 1952. India's first series victory was against [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]] later the same year. In 1954, India drew a 5-Test series with Pakistan 0-0, the batting strength from India had come from [[Polly Umrigar]] and [[Vijay Manjrekar]] while the prime bowler was [[Subhash Gupte]] with 21 wickets in the series. India's first series against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] in 1956 created a comprehensive series victory for India, winning the 5-Test series 2-0. [[MH Mankad]] was excellent in his batting, averaging 105.2 in the series while scoring 526 runs. Once again, S.M. Gupte held India's bowling together, with 34 wickets. The remainder of the 1950s did not show as good results as the start: India lost a 3-Test series to Australia (2-0), lost a 5-Test series against the [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies]] (3-0),

The team's performances again began to improve in the 1960s, starting with their first series win over England in 1961-62. During this time, India's strong record at home started to develop, in which the team won a series against New Zealand in 1965-66 and drew series against Pakistan, Australia and England. In 1967-68, India won their first series outside the subcontinent against New Zealand.

[[Sunil Gavaskar]] made his debut for India in the West Indies in 1970-71 and immediately made an impact, scoring a total of 774 runs for the series and helping India to a 1-0 series win, their first ever win over the West Indies. Together with established players like [[Bishen Bedi]], [[Srinivas Venkataraghavan]], [[Erapalli Prasanna]] and [[Bhagwat Chandrasekhar]], Gavaskar formed the nucleus of arguably India's strongest Test team up to that point in time. India's win over the West Indies was followed by home and away wins over England in 1971 and 1972-73.

During the 1980s, other players like [[Mohammed Azharuddin]], [[Ravi Shastri]], [[Laxman Sivaramakrishnan]], [[Sanjay Manjrekar]], [[Krish Srikkanth]] and [[Maninder Singh (cricketer)|Maninder Singh]] emerged. India won the [[Cricket World Cup]] in 1983, defeating [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies]] in an exciting final. In 1985, India won the World Championship of Cricket in Australia. The Test series victory in 1986 in England remained, for nearly 19 years, the last Test series win outside [[Indian subcontinent|subcontinent]]. Sunil Gavaskar became the first batsman to accumulate 10,000 runs in Test cricket, and went on to register a record 34 centuries, surpassed only recently by [[Sachin Tendulkar]]. [[Kapil Dev]], a genuine all-rounder, became the highest wicket taker in Test cricket, surpassing [[Richard Hadlee]] to take a total of 434 wickets, a record which has since been broken by [[Courtney Walsh]], [[Shane Warne]] and [[Muttiah Muralitharan]] and has also been surpassed by fellow Indian [[Anil Kumble]].
[[Image:Sachin at Castrol Golden Spanner Awards.jpg|thumb|Sachin Tendulkar, India's leading run-scorer in Test and ODI cricket.]]
The emergence of Sachin Tendulkar and [[Anil Kumble]] in 1989 and 1990 was to herald an era of Indian cricket that was dominated by stars and individual brilliance. Sachin Tendulkar became arguably the best batsman in the world, along with [[Brian Lara]] of the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] and in 1998, Sir Donald Bradman himself remarked that Tendulkar batting style was similar to his. [[Mohammed Azharuddin]], who captained India for most of the 1990s, proved a captain whose main strength, if not his motivational skills, was an ability to stay cool under pressure. Azharuddin's artistic batting however declined during the later years of his captaincy, and his best innings during this time were mostly when playing at home. The [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabadi]] stylist's career ended after 99 Tests when he was banned for life after being implicated in the [[match-fixing]] scandal. Under his captaincy, the Indian team became virtually unbeatable at home, with big wins against teams such as England, Sri Lanka, South Africa and Australia. Their performances abroad, however, left a lot to be desired.

Towards the end of 1999, the Indian team was in flux. Although they had performed well in the [[1999 Cricket World Cup|1999 World Cup]], the winter was marked by a disastrous tour to Australia which exposed the Indian team's weaknesses when playing abroad, marked with a loss of form of most of the batsmen, except Tendulkar and the newly emerged [[VVS Laxman]]. After Tendulkar quit captaincy and Azharuddin was banned for match-fixing, Saurav Ganguly took over as captain, and the New Zealander [[John Wright (cricketer)|John Wright]] became coach.

Ganguly's captaincy heralded a new era in Indian cricket. It began in the famous series against Australia in 2001, when [[Steve Waugh]]'s strong team was defeated 2-1 in a Test series after having taken a 1-0 lead at [[Mumbai]]. The series is best known for a remarkable turnaround by the Indian team in the [[Kolkata]] Test, when VVS Laxman, Rahul Dravid and [[Harbhajan Singh]]'s performance took India to victory after they had [[follow-on|followed on]]. This series marked a turning point in the Indian team's fortunes, and provided the team with the boost they dearly needed. This was followed by stellar performances by the team when playing abroad, with Test victories coming in Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka, West Indies, England, Australia, and a famous series victory against arch-rivals Pakistan in 2004. The series in England in 2002 is billed as Rahul Dravid's series, as he became the top scorer for the Indians, with centuries coming at [[Trent Bridge]] in [[Nottingham]], [[Headingley Stadium|Headingley]] in [[Leeds]] and a famous 217 at the [[The Oval|Oval]] in [[London]]. This was followed by a sensational win in Australia at [[Adelaide]] in 2003, where Dravid, VVS Laxman and [[Ajit Agarkar]] scripted a come-from-behind victory after the team had conceded 556 runs in the first innings. The series win in Pakistan that followed was marked by [[Virender Sehwag]] becoming the first Indian to score a triple century in Test cricket. Along with Sehwag, players like [[Yuvraj Singh]] and [[Mohammed Kaif]] emerged, making the Indian batting order one of the strongest in the world in both forms of the game*. Their performances helped reduced India's dependence on their top guns in one-day cricket, and a 7-batsman policy contributed to India's successes in the limited-overs game, culminating in their reaching the final of the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]]. In the bowling department, India unearthed a plethora of fast-bowling talent, with [[Zaheer Khan]], [[Ashish Nehra]], and later [[Irfan Pathan]] and [[L Balaji]] leading the pack. The veteran Anil Kumble became the highest wicket-taker for India after surpassing Kapil Dev, and also passed the 500-mark in March 2006. His bowling performances abroad improved considerably, and he played a major part in India's overseas performances in England, Australia and Pakistan. Harbhajan Singh also provided him great company in the spin department, and at home the two bowling in tandem became a familiar sight.

* [[Rahul Dravid]], [[Sachin Tendulkar]] and [[Virender Sehwag]] were selected to play for the [[2005 ICC Super Series|ICC World XI]] in the 2005 "[[ICC Super Series|SuperTest]]" against Australia.

In 2005, Indian cricket was again shrouded in controversy. After a somewhat slow season marked by a dip in team performance following the famous Pakistan series ended, the coaching job passed from John Wright to the Australian [[Greg Chappell]]. Saurav Ganguly, whose batting form had taken a beating in that year, was involved in a spat with Chappell over whether he should be continuing as captain to reduce pressure on him. This was followed by Ganguly being dropped from the team and Rahul Dravid taking over as captain. While Tendulkar, Sehwag and Dravid formed the mainstay of the Indian batting, the coming of age of players like Yuvraj Singh and Mohammad Kaif led to the emergence of younger stars like [[Suresh Raina]] and [[MS Dhoni]]. India, however have always struggled in the pace department with the only prominent pace bowler ever coming was [[Zaheer Khan]]

Dravid's captaincy was cut short in the ill-fated 2007 World Cup, where India were out of the league stage following an embarrassing loss to Bangladesh. This was followed by Mahendra Singh Dhoni taking over the reins. Under MS Dhoni, India won the inaugural T20 World cup. It also began an era of India's dominance in world cricket in both tests and ODIs, culminating in a victory in the 2011 Cricket World Cup and a 4-0 whitewash of Australia in a home test series.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc_cricket_worldcup2011/engine/current/match/433606.html&lt;/ref&gt;  It also saw Indian batsmen scoring the only 200s ever, first Sachin Tendulkar then Virender Sehwag and then  [[Rohit Sharma]] on three occasions. Dhoni has been widely acknowledged as the most successful Indian captain ever. However, following a drubbing in a test series down under in late 2014, he retired from tests.

==International Tournaments==
{{see also|India at the Cricket World Cup}}
Since advancing to full Test Status and the creation of more and more international cricket tournaments, India has slowly become involved in a number of Cricketing tournament's including the [[Cricket World Cup]], [[ICC Champions Trophy]] and [[Asia Cup]]. India's first two [[Cricket World Cup]]s were largely failures, and the team failed to progress beyond the first round. But India upset the West Indies in the final of the [[1983 Cricket World Cup]] to claim the Prudential Cricket World Cup for the first time, captained by Kapil Dev. India and the West Indies had cruised through the preliminary rounds in Group B, while England and Pakistan emerged the victors from Group A. Most considered India to be the underdogs in the group stages, and their win against West Indies was categorized as similar to Zimbabwe's win over Australia in the same World Cup. They were, in fact, quoted as having odds of 66 to 1 before the beginning of the tournament.

India's performance in the remaining world cups has been considerably consistent. In the [[1987 Cricket World Cup]], the team advanced to the semi-finals as favourites, they did the same in 1996, both times they suffered upset defeats in the semi-finals. India was less strong in the [[1999 Cricket World Cup]], and did not make it past the Super Six section. However they impressed all in the [[2003 Cricket World Cup|2003 Cup]], only losing two games (both against reigning champions [[Australia]]) and advancing to the finals before taking a loss.

In the year after their World Cup victory, (1984) India continued its new-found dominance over One Day Cricket with a comprehensive win over arch-rivals [[Pakistan cricket team|Pakistan]] in the final. They went on to secure more victories over their Asian rivals, winning the 1984 [[Asia Cup]] with a victory over [[Sri Lankan cricket team|Sri Lanka]] in the finals. It won its third consecutive Asia Cup with a victory over Sri Lanka in 1990. It continued its strong streak in 1995, again beating Sri Lanka in the final. However, in 1997, a confident Sri Lanka riding on their first-ever World Cup victory swept past a weaker Indian side, breaking the 4-tournament winning streak.

==Recent history==
India's traditional strengths have always been its line-up of [[spin bowling|spin bowlers]] and [[batsman|batsmen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://content-www1.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/260862.html|title = India can find the right balance before the world cup|work = Jamie Alter|publisher = http://www.cricinfo.com/|accessdate = 14 October 2006}} Gavaskar: ''I would imagine that the spinners have always been our strength''&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, it has a very strong batting lineup with [[Rahul Dravid]], [[Sachin Tendulkar]] and [[Virender Sehwag]] all being selected to play for the [[2005 ICC Super Series|ICC World XI]] in the 2005 "[[ICC Super Series|SuperTest]]" against Australia. In previous times, India was unique in that it was the only country to regularly field three spinners in one team, whereas one is the norm, and of the fifteen players to have taken more than 100 wickets, only four were pace bowlers from the last 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in recent years, Indian pace bowling has improved, with the emerging talents of [[Irfan Pathan]], [[Munaf Patel]] and [[Sreesanth]] and many more playing in the national team.

[[Image:Wankhede-1.JPG|thumb|The Indian cricket team in action in the Wankhede Stadium]]
Historically, the Indian team has not performed as well overseas as it has in India. Since the year 2000, the Indian team underwent major improvements under the guidance of coach [[John Wright (cricketer)|John Wright]] and captain [[Saurav Ganguly]]. The team drew a Test series with Australia in [[Australia]], which is usually considered a tough tour. It was followed by a historic Test and ODI series win against arch-rivals Pakistan while playing in Pakistan.

India has had a very good record against Australia and, before the 2004/05 tour, never being defeated by Australia in a Test Series in India since 1969. This was the reason for [[Australian national cricket captains|Australian captain]] [[Steve Waugh]] labelling India as the "Final Frontier".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/NATIONAL/IND/NEWS/STEVEWAUGH_COLUMN.html|title = Steve Waugh Column|work = Steve Waugh|publisher = http://www.cricinfo.com/|accessdate = 21 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The famous 2001 Australian tour of India saw [[Harbhajan Singh]] become the first Indian to take a Test hat-trick and started a good run for the team, as India beat Australia 2-1. India also came runners up to Australia in the final of the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]].

Since 2004, India had not been doing as well in One-day Internationals. The players who took India to great heights over the past ten years such as Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Anil Kumble grew older and did not maintain their form and fitness. Following the series loss to Australia, India collapsed on the final day in the Third Test in [[Bangalore]] in early 2005 against Pakistan to squander a series victory, and then lost four consecutive ODIs against Pakistan. This was exacerbated by the suspension handed to captain Ganguly for slow over-rates. [[Greg Chappell]] took over from John Wright as the new coach of the Indian cricket team following the series, and replaced Kumble and [[V. V. S. Laxman]] from the ODI team with younger players. India's unconvincing ODI form continued, scraping past a West Indian team depleted by industrial action in the [[2005 Indian Oil Cup]] and a similarly depleted Zimbabwean team only to be defeated twice in the finals by New Zealand, continuing a poor ODI finals record.

The tension resulted in a fallout between Chappell and Ganguly lead to a confidential email sent by Chappell to the BCCI being leaked, in which he condemned the leadership and performance of Ganguly. After a series of high-profile board meetings and public jousting including some players, [[Rahul Dravid]] was installed as the captain, triggering a revival in the team's fortunes. The Indians subsequently defeated Sri Lanka 6-1 in a home series. An important part about this series was the discovery of the young talent of the team, including [[Mahendra Singh Dhoni]], [[Suresh Raina]], [[Gautam Gambhir]] and [[Irfan Pathan]]. The team also beat the Sri Lankans in the Test series 2-0 to displace England from its position in second place in the ICC Test rankings, but India slipped back by losing the high-profile&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.hinduonnet.com/2005/03/02/stories/2005030204681900.htm|title = TWI gets production rights for India-Pakistan series|work = The Hindu - Sport|publisher = http://www.hinduonnet.com/|accessdate = 14 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; series to [[Pakistan]]. Indian team continued its good form in ODIs, beating [[Pakistan]] 4-1 in Pakistan. India achieved the world-record of winning 17 successive matches chasing the total. India convincingly won [[England]]'s tour of [[India]] winning the series 5-1. After leveling the DLF Cup series 1-1 in [[Abu Dhabi]], [[India]] travelled to [[West Indies]] where they lost the ODI series 1-4 to a weak West Indies team which was ranked 8th in the ICC ODI Ranking. The series loss again questioned the Indian team's ability to play away from the Sub-continent and the chances of the Indian team to win the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.hinduonnet.com/2005/03/02/stories/2005030204681900.htm|title = India can find right balance before World Cup|work = Jamie Alter|publisher = http://www.cricinfo.com/|accessdate = 14 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian team later clinched the Test series against West Indies 1-0, the first Indian series win in the Caribbean since 1989. For the statistics of [[Indian national cricket team|Indian cricket team]] after [[2011 Cricket World Cup|2011 world cup]], watch [[Indian cricket performance from 2011|Indian cricket from 2011]]. Recently the Indian Cricket team has beaten the Australian cricket team with an impressive 2-1 victory in the 2017 Border-Gavaskar trophy, also it beat Bangladesh in the one-off test which was also Bangladesh's maiden tour of India. Before, India beat England by 4-0 in the 2016-17 Antony De Mello Trophy in the 5 match test series.

In June 2017, [[India national cricket team|India]] toured England for the [[2017 ICC Champions Trophy]] where the [[Virat Kohli]] led mighty team lost to [[Pakistan]] in the final by 180 runs. Later India toured the [[West Indies national cricket team|Windies]] where the team won the [[One Day International|ODI]] series by 3-1 but lost the [[Twenty20 International|T20I]] series. By defeating [[Sri Lanka]] by 9-0 in all three formats, India became the first team to cleansweep Sri Lanka in [[One Day International|ODI]] series in their home soil.

In January 2018, [[Virat Kohli]] led Indian team toured South Africa where they lost the Test series by 1-2. But the Team showed some extravagant skills and defeated the mighty South African team and clinched the [[One Day International|ODI]] series by 5-1 and [[Twenty20 International|T20I]] series by 2-1. By the series win, India became the second Asian country to defeat South Africa in [[One Day International|ODI]] and [[Twenty20 International|T20I]] series on their home soil after [[Pakistan]].

The '''Honda Center''' (formerly known as the '''Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim''') is an [[indoor arena]] located in [[Anaheim, California]]. The arena is home to the [[Anaheim Ducks]] of the [[National Hockey League]].

Originally named the '''Anaheim Arena''' during construction, it was completed in 1993 at a cost of US$123 million. [[Arrowhead Water]] paid $15 million for the [[naming rights]] over 10 years in October 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ovguide.com/honda-center-9202a8c04000641f8000000000343c75 ovguide.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In the short period of time between the enfranchisement of the [[Anaheim Ducks|Mighty Ducks]] and the naming rights deal with Arrowhead, Disney referred to the Arena as the '''Pond of Anaheim'''.&lt;ref&gt;In the 1993–94 Mighty Ducks of Anaheim media guide, Disney and the Ducks organization referred to the arena as the "Pond of Anaheim." This was prior to the naming rights deal with Arrowhead Water. [[Amazon Standard Identification Number|ASIN]]: B001EBD3BM&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2006, [[Honda]] paid $60 million for the naming rights for over 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jul/20/sports/sp-pond20 | work=Los Angeles Times | first1=Bill | last1=Shaikin | first2=Greg | last2=Johnson | date=July 20, 2006 | title=Pond to Get a New Name}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:New Scoreboard at Honda Center.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The New Scoreboard at Honda Center as seen from Section 438 during the 2016 Stanley Cup Play-offs on April 27, 2016]]  
The arena opened on June 19, 1993, with a [[Barry Manilow]] concert as its first event. Since then, it has been host to a number of events, such as the [[2003 Stanley Cup Finals|2003]] and [[2007 Stanley Cup Finals]]. On June 6, 2007, the Anaheim Ducks defeated the [[Ottawa Senators]], 6–2, in game five of the Final at Honda Center to clinch the franchise's first Stanley Cup championship.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

Honda Center has hosted several [[List of UFC events|UFC events]], starting with [[UFC 59]] in 2006. It hosted the [[2005 IBF World Championships]] for badminton in 2005.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

From 1994 to 1998, it served as a second home for the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Los Angeles Clippers]]. It was the home arena for the [[Anaheim Bullfrogs]] of [[Roller Hockey International]] from 1994 to 1999 and for the [[Anaheim Piranhas]] of the [[Arena Football League]] from 1996 to 1997.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

This arena has also hosted a [[Professional Bull Riders|PBR]] Bud Light Cup (later [[Built Ford Tough Series]]) event annually since 1998. Since 1994, the arena has hosted the annual [[John R. Wooden Classic]].{{fact|date=June 2018}}

In 2011, the arena began hosting the [[Big West Conference]] Men's and Women's Basketball tournaments.  The arena has also hosted the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament six times, as the West Regional site – [[1998 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1998]], [[2001 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2001]], [[2003 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2003]], [[2008 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2008]], [[2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2011]], [[2014 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2014]] and [[2016 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2016]]. It even hosted the Frozen Four, the semifinals and final of the [[NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship]], in 1999, underscoring the popularity of hockey in the region.

On December 6, 2000, music legend [[Tina Turner]] played her last concert at the arena for the record breaking [[Twenty Four Seven Tour]], but after popular demand, Turner returned to the arena before a sellout crowd on October 14, 2008, for her [[Tina!: 50th Anniversary Tour]].

The Honda Center lies northeast across [[California State Route 57]] from [[Angel Stadium of Anaheim|Angel Stadium]] (where [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]] play) and roughly {{convert|3|mi}} from [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland Park]]. It is also across the street from [[Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center]] with service by [[Amtrak]] (''[[Pacific Surfliner]]''), [[Metrolink (Southern California)|Metrolink]] (''[[Orange County Line]]''), [[Anaheim Resort Transit]], [[Orange County Transportation Authority]] and private transportation companies.

The arena seats up 17,174 for its primary tenant, the Ducks. It takes only five hours to convert Honda Center from a sporting arena to an 8,400-seat amphitheater. There are 84 [[luxury box|luxury suites]] in the building, which has hosted 17.5 million people, as of 2003. In 2005, the arena became the first in the U.S. to have two full levels of 360° ribbon displays installed. [[Daktronics]] of [[Brookings, South Dakota]], designed, manufactured and installed the {{convert|1800|ft|m}} of full-color [[LED]] technology. Outside the venue, the marquee was upgraded with two large video displays measuring {{convert|8|ft|m}} high by {{convert|21|ft|m}}, and a new marquee was built with more [[LED]] video displays.&lt;ref name=displays&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daktronics.com/en-us/photos/details?pn=WP-15256 |title=Daktronics Photo Gallery: Honda Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Broadcom]] chairman [[Henry Samueli]] owns the company that operates the arena, Anaheim Arena Management, LLC, and the arena's primary tenant, the Ducks, giving him great flexibility in scheduling events and recruiting new tenants. Samueli hopes to bring an [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] team to the arena.

The '''Lou Gehrig Memorial Award''' is given annually to a [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) player who best exhibits the character and integrity of [[Lou Gehrig]], both [[Sportsmanship|on the field]] and off it.&lt;ref name=PDT&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lou Gehrig Memorial Award|url=http://www.phideltatheta.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=27|accessdate=November 6, 2012|publisher=Phi Delta Theta International Site}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award was created by the [[Phi Delta Theta]] fraternity in honor of Gehrig, who was a member of the fraternity at [[Columbia University]]. It was first presented in {{baseball year|1955}}, fourteen years after Gehrig's death.

{{for|[[Labrinth]]'s brother|MckNasty}}
'''McNasty''' refers to a style of slam dunk in the American sport [[Slamball]]. The move consists of a player launching himself from the outside [[trampoline]], rotating 360-degrees and putting the ball between their legs before dunking the ball. The move was originated and made popular by [[Slamball]] phenom Sean "inches" Jackson, of the Mob, who used the dunk in the 2002 [[Slamball]] dunk contest. A variation known as the reverse McNasty was also used in the contest.

'''Memorial Stadium''' is a [[multi-use stadium]] located in [[Asheville, North Carolina]]. The stadium was completed in 1925 to serve as a regional athletic and special events facility. Memorial Stadium is not to be confused with the similarly named [[Asheville High School]] Memorial Stadium.

Memorial Stadium's entrance was originally intended to serve as a memorial to [[Western North Carolina]]'s war veterans but the memorial was never entirely completed. Recently plans have been set afoot to complete the memorial. As part of a large scale renovation of the facility which included the installation of a new [[artificial turf]] playing surface, there are plans to move a [[World War II]] memorial onto the site.

Memorial Stadium is currently home to the Asheville Grizzlies - a semi-pro [[American football|football]] team in the Central Carolina Football League - and Asheville City Soccer Club, who compete in the [[National Premier Soccer League]].

Memorial Stadium sits adjacent to [[McCormick Field]], home of the [[South Atlantic League]]'s [[Asheville Tourists]].

{{Refimprove|date=May 2013}}
[[File:Junko-Kitahama Apnea-Monofin cropped.jpg|thumb|A freediver using a monofin]]
[[File:Herbert Nitsch at the Cyprus BIOS 2004 Freediving Open Classic.JPG|thumb|[[Herbert Nitsch]] wearing a monofin at the Cyprus BIOS 2004 Freediving Open Classic]]

A '''monofin''' is a type of [[swimfin]] typically used in [[underwater sports]] such as [[finswimming]],  [[free-diving]] and [[underwater orienteering]]. It consists of a single or linked [[control surface (fluid dynamics)|surface]]s attached to both of the diver's feet. The diver's appearance is then reminiscent of a [[mermaid]] or [[merman]].

The arrival of the monofin in the early 1970s led to the breaking of all finswimming world records by the end of the decade due to the improved performance possible when used instead of two ordinary swimfins.&lt;ref name=luigiferraro&gt;{{cite web|title=Finswimming|url=http://www.luigiferraro.it/en/finswimming|publisher=Official site dedicated to Luigi Ferraro|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
To differentiate between the use of monofins and conventional fins, the latter are sometimes referred to as '''stereo fins''' or '''bi-fins'''.

The monofin swimmer extends arms forward, locking hands together, locking the head between the biceps. The undulating movement starts in the shoulders, with maximum amplitude towards the hips, the legs almost don't bend to transfer the movement to the monofin. This technique is called the '''dolphin kick'''. 

By slowly oscillating the surface of the monofin when submerged, divers can generate large amounts of [[thrust]] even with small or slow movements. This preserves [[energy]] which helps when breathholding ([[apnea]]).

==History and production==
Monofins were introduced in 1972 by a [[USSR|Soviet]]{{cn|date=July 2015}} finswimming club and have been used for finswimming competitions since, allowing monofin swimmers to reach speeds of 12 km/h.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Dolphin-Inspired Man-Made Fin Works Swimmingly|url= http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/dolphin-inspired-man-made-fin/|publisher= Scientific American|accessdate= 17 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional [[List_of_world_records_in_finswimming#Men|monofin 50 m apnea world record]] is as fast as 13 km/h.

===Construction===
[[File:Skorjenkoflosse.jpg|thumb|Monofin]]
Monofins can be made of [[glass fiber]], [[carbon fiber]] or [[aluminum]] and [[rubber]]. The diver's [[muscle]] power, swimming style, and the type of aquatic activity the monofin is used for determining the choice of size, stiffness, and materials.

Most monofins consist of a single, wide, glass or carbon fiber reinforced composite blade with graded flexibility attached to the diver by two rubber foot pockets. The leading edge may be thickened and faired. The blade flexibility is generally controlled by tapering the amount of fibre and thickness of the blade to make the trailing edge thinner and more flexible. 

The [[Lunocet]] is a later type of monofin which uses bio-mimicry of dolphin flukes in an attempt to improve efficiency. It uses cycling shoes to connect to the diver for comfortable wear and power transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimateswimfin.com/|title=Buy the Best Monofin - Lunocet - comfortable freediving, apnea &amp; apnee |work=ultimateswimfin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Please do not promote Lunocet without a scam warning. He took $400 from me, but never delivered even though he called me after a year waiting with an upgrade offer. I then checked the website for trading standards in his State and saw that he had scammed many other people too. His publicity is good and high profile users evidently get deliveries. Ordinary mortals will just lose their money.

'''Olympic Stadium'''&lt;ref name="permanentcapacity"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://parcolympique.qc.ca/en/what-to-do/olympic-stadium/|title=The Stadium|website=Part olympique|accessdate=May 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-fr|Stade olympique}}) is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in Canada, located at [[Olympic Park, Montreal|Olympic Park]] in the [[Hochelaga-Maisonneuve]] district of [[Montreal]]. Built in the mid-1970s as the [[Olympic Stadium|main venue]] for the [[1976 Summer Olympics]], it is nicknamed "The Big O", a reference to both its name and to the [[doughnut]]-shape of the permanent component of the stadium's roof. It is also called "The Big Owe" to reference the astronomical cost of the stadium and the 1976 Olympics as a whole.&lt;ref name="CBC-StadiumDebtPaid"/&gt;

The stadium is the largest by seating capacity in Canada. After the Olympics, [[artificial turf]] was installed and it became the home of Montreal's professional [[Major League Baseball|baseball]] and [[Canadian Football League|football]] teams. The [[Montreal Alouettes]] of the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] returned to their previous home of [[Percival Molson Memorial Stadium|Molson Stadium]] in [[1998 Montreal Alouettes season|1998]] for regular season games, but continued to use Olympic Stadium for playoff and [[Grey Cup]] games until 2014 when they returned to [[Percival Molson Memorial Stadium|Molson Stadium]] for all of their games. Following the [[2004 Montreal Expos season|2004]] baseball season, the [[Montreal Expos|Expos]] relocated to Washington, D.C. to become the [[Washington Nationals]]. The stadium currently serves as a [[multipurpose stadium|multipurpose facility]] for special events (e.g. concerts, trade shows) with a permanent [[seating capacity]] of 56,040.&lt;ref name="permanentcapacity"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stadiumdb"&gt;[http://stadiumdb.com/stadiums/can/olympic_stadium_montreal Olympic Stadium]. stadiumdb.com. Retrieved April 28, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The capacity is expandable with temporary seating. The [[Montreal Impact]] of [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) use the venue on occasion, when demand for tickets justifies the large capacity or when the weather restricts outdoor play at nearby [[Saputo Stadium]] in the spring months.

The stadium has not had a main tenant since the Expos left in 2004.  Despite decades of use, the stadium's history of numerous structural and financial problems has largely branded it a [[white elephant]].

Incorporated into the north base of the stadium is the Montreal Tower, the world's tallest [[inclined tower]] at {{convert|175|m}}. The stadium and [[Olympic Park, Montreal|Olympic Park]] grounds border [[Maisonneuve Park]], which includes the [[Montreal Botanical Garden]], adjacent to the west across [[Sherbrooke Street|Rue Sherbrooke]] ([[Quebec Route 138|Route 138]]).

==History==

===Background and architecture===
As early as 1963, [[Mayor of Montreal|Montreal Mayor]] [[Jean Drapeau]] sought to build a covered stadium in Montreal.&lt;ref name=SABROlympicStadium&gt;Costello, Rory. [http://sabr.org/bioproj/park/477659 Olympic Stadium (Montreal)]. [[Society for American Baseball Research]], 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  A covered stadium was thought to be all but essential for Drapeau's other goal of bringing a Major League Baseball team to Montreal, given the cold weather that can affect the city in April, October and sometimes even September.  In 1967, soon after the [[National League]] granted Montreal an expansion franchise for 1969, Drapeau wrote a letter promising that any prospective Montreal team would be playing in a covered stadium by 1971.  However, even as powerful as he was, he did not have the power to make such a guarantee on his own authority.  Just as [[Charles Bronfman]], who was slated to become the franchise's first owner, was ready to walk away, Drapeau had his staffers draw up a proposal for a stadium.  It was enough to persuade Bronfman to continue with the effort.&lt;ref name=Keri/&gt;

[[File:Montreal Olympic Stadium tower with cables for retractable roof.jpg|thumb|left|Tower with cables for retractable roof]]
The stadium was designed by French architect [[Roger Taillibert]] to be an elaborate facility featuring a [[retractable roof]],&lt;ref name=boatdrs&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JhUyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yaQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5430%2C4071162 |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |title=Big O architect to do roof study |date=June 10, 1981 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was to be opened and closed by cables suspended from a huge {{convert|175|m|ft|sigfig=3|adj=on}} tower – the tallest inclined structure in the world, and the [[List of tallest buildings in Montreal|sixth tallest]] structure in Montreal. The design of the stadium resembles that of the Australian Pavilion at [[Expo '70]] in [[Osaka, Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Glenn |url=http://en.japantourist.jp/view/yokkaichi-s-platypus-pavilion |title=Yokkaichi's Platypus Pavilion &amp;#124; Mie &amp;#124; Japan Tourist, by Chris Glenn |publisher=En.japantourist.jp |date=November 30, 2011 |accessdate=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon after Montreal was awarded the 1976 Games, Drapeau struck a secret deal with Taillibert to build the stadium.  It only came to light in 1972.&lt;ref name=Keri/&gt;

The [[Olympic Pool (Montreal)|Olympic swimming pool]] is located under this tower. An Olympic [[velodrome]] (since converted to the [[Montreal Biodome]], an indoor nature museum) was situated at the base of the tower in a building similar in design to the swimming pool. The building was built as the [[Olympic Stadium|main stadium]] for the 1976 Summer Olympic Games. The stadium was host to various events including the [[Olympic Games#Ceremonies|opening and closing ceremonies]], [[Athletics at the 1976 Summer Olympics|athletics]], [[Football at the 1976 Summer Olympics|football]] finals, and the team jumping [[Equestrian at the 1976 Summer Olympics|equestrian]] events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1976/1976v2.pdf 1976 Summer Olympics official report.] Volume 2. pp. 42–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

The building's design is cited as a masterpiece of Organic Modern architecture.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Rémillard, 196.&lt;/ref&gt; Taillibert based the building on plant and animal forms, aiming to include vertebral structures with sinews or tentacles, while still following the basic plans of [[Modern architecture]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Construction===
[[Image:Le Stade Olympique de Montréal Nuit Arriere Edit 1.jpg|thumb|left|Back view at night]]
The stadium was originally slated to be finished in 1972, but the grand opening was cancelled due to a strike by construction workers. The ''Conseil des métiers de la construction'' union headed by [[André Desjardins|André "Dédé" Desjardins]] kept the construction site in "anarchic disorder" until the Quebec Premier [[Robert Bourassa]] bought him off in a secret deal.&lt;ref name="Taillibert: blame Ottawa, Quebec"&gt;{{cite web

What irony!"&lt;ref name="Taillibert: blame Ottawa, Quebec"/&gt; Further delays ensued due to the stadium's unusual design and Taillibert's unwillingess to back down from his original vision of the stadium even in the face of escalating costs for raw materials.  It did not help that the original project manager, Trudeau et Associés, seemed to be incapable of handling some of the most basic construction tasks. The Quebec provincial government finally lost patience with the delays and cost overruns in 1974, and threw Taillibert off the project.&lt;ref name=Keri/&gt;

Additionally, the project was plagued by circumstances beyond anyone's control. Work slowed to a snail's pace for a third of the year due to Montreal's typically brutal winters. As a result, the stadium and tower remained unfinished at the opening of the 1976 Olympic Games.&lt;ref name=Keri/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/montreals-billion-dollar-big-owe-what-went-wrong-in-76/article1152036/|title=Montreal's billion-dollar 'Big Owe': What went wrong in '76?|last=Peritz|first=Ingrid|date=January 17, 2009|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|accessdate=January 19, 2009|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The roof materials languished in a warehouse in [[Marseille]] until 1982, and the tower and roof were not completed until 1987.&lt;ref name=SABROlympicStadium/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/buildingbig/wonder/structure/olympic_stadium.html|title=Building big: Databank: Olympic Stadium|publisher=WGBH|accessdate=July 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would be another year before the 66-tonne, {{convert|5500|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} [[Kevlar]] roof could retract. Even then, it could not be used in winds above {{convert|40|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. Ultimately, it was only opened and closed 88 times.&lt;ref name=SABROlympicStadium/&gt;

===Observatory===
[[image:Montreal Olympic stadium funicular view..jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.5|North-east view from elevator lower deck compartment]]
When construction on the stadium's tower resumed after the 1976 Olympics, a multi-storey observatory was added to the plan, accessible via a [[inclined elevator]], opened in 1987, that travels {{convert|266|m|}} along the curved tower's spine. The elevator cabin ascends from base of the tower to upper deck in less than two minutes at a rate of {{convert|2.8|m/s|mph|abbr=on}}, with space for 76 persons per trip and a capacity of 500 persons per hour. The cabin is designed to remain level throughout its trip, while providing a panoramic view to its passengers.

The elevator faces north-east, offering a view to the north, south and east. It overlooks the Olympic Village, the Biodome, the Botanical Gardens and Saputo Stadium.  The Olympic Park, the stadium's suspended roof and downtown Montreal can be viewed from the south-west facing Observatory at the top of the tower.

===Stadium financing===
[[Image:Aerial view of Olympic Stadium (Montreal) as seen at night.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view at night]]
Despite initial projections in 1970 that the stadium would cost only [[Canadian dollar|C$]]134&amp;nbsp;million to construct, strikes and construction delays served to escalate these costs. By the time the stadium opened (in an unfinished form), the total costs had risen to C$1.1&amp;nbsp;billion.

The Quebec government introduced a special tobacco tax in May 1976 to help recoup its investment. By 2006, the amount contributed to the stadium's owner, the Olympic Installations Board (OIB) ([[French language|fr]]: Régie des Installations Olympiques), accounted for 8% of the tax revenue earned from cigarette sales. The 1976 special tobacco tax act stipulated that once the stadium was paid off, ownership of the facility would be returned to the City of Montreal.

In mid-November 2006, the stadium's costs were finally paid in full, more than 30 years after it opened.&lt;ref name="CBC-StadiumDebtPaid"&gt;{{cite news|author=CBC News |title=Quebec's Big Owe stadium debt is over |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=December 19, 2006 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/montreal/story/2006/12/19/qc-olympicstadium.html |accessdate=June 25, 2008 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103103426/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/montreal/story/2006/12/19/qc-olympicstadium.html |archivedate=January 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The total expenditure (including repairs, renovations, construction, [[interest]], and inflation) amounted to C$1.61&amp;nbsp;billion, making it—at the time all costs were paid off—the second most expensive stadium ever built (after [[Wembley Stadium]] in London).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/08/06/expensive-stadiums-worldwide-forbeslife-cx_ae_0806sports_slide_10.html?partner=sinatw | work=Forbes |title=In Depth: World's Most Expensive Stadiums | first=Andrew | last=Egan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite initial plans to complete payment in October 2006, an indoor smoking ban introduced in May 2006 curtailed the revenue gathered by the tobacco tax.&lt;ref name="CBC-StadiumDebtPaid"/&gt; By 2014, the stadium's expense ranking had fallen to fifth, with the construction of costlier venues like [[MetLife Stadium]], [[AT&amp;T Stadium]], and [[Yankee Stadium|the new Yankee Stadium]]. Perceived by many to be a white elephant, the stadium has also been dubbed ''The Big Owe'' due to its astronomical cost.

The stadium has generated on average $20 million in revenue each year since 1977. It is estimated that a large-scale event such as the Grey Cup can generate as much as $50 million in revenue.&lt;ref name="rio.intercollab.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rio.intercollab.com/servlet/file?id=66|title=Rio.intercollab.com|publisher=|accessdate=November 23, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713044910/http://rio.intercollab.com/servlet/file?id=66|archivedate=July 13, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continuing problems===
Although the tower and retractable roof were not completed in time for the 1976 Olympics, construction on the tower resumed in the 1980s. During this period, however, a large fire set the tower ablaze, causing damage and forcing a scheduled [[Montreal Expos|Expos]] home game to be postponed. In 1986, a large chunk of the tower fell onto the playing field prior to another Expos game August 29 vs. San Diego Padres forcing a doubleheader on August 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1986/B08301MON1986.htm|title=Retrosheet Boxscore: Montreal Expos 10, San Diego Padres 1 (1)|publisher=|accessdate=May 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="espn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/s/2003/0422/1542317.html |title=ESPN.com: MLB – Merron: What a disaster! |publisher=Static.espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--cite covers this section to its lower tag--&gt;

In January 1985, approval was given by the Quebec government to complete the project and install a retractable roof, financed by an Olympic cigarette tax in the province.&lt;ref name=albotgr &gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IkolAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qqUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1389%2C1079304 |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |last=Drolet |first=Daniel |title=At last: Big O to get a retractable roof |date=January 24, 1985 |page=A-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tower construction and installation of the orange-coloured [[Kevlar]] roof were completed by April 1987,&lt;ref name=osripaey&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pEMyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=buYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5580%2C3665483 |newspaper=Lawrence (KS) Journal World |agency=Associated Press |title=Olympic Stadium roof in place after 11 years |date=April 15, 1987 |page=5B}}&lt;/ref&gt; a decade later than planned.

As part of various renovations made in 1991 to improve the stadium's suitability as a baseball venue, 12,000 seats were eliminated, most of them in distant portions of the outfield, and home plate was moved closer to the stands.
[[File:Batting practice at Olympic Stadium in 2015.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Olympic Stadium's blue roof and new scoreboard installed in 2015]]
On September 8 of that year, support beams snapped and caused a {{convert|55|LT|ST t|adj=on|lk=on}} concrete slab to fall onto an exterior walkway. No one was injured, but the Expos had to move their final 13 home games of that season to the opponents' cities.  The Expos hinted that the 1992 season was at risk unless the stadium was certified safe.  In early November, engineers found the stadium was structurally sound.  However, it took longer to certify the roof as safe because it had been badly ripped in a June windstorm.&lt;ref name=SABROlympicStadium/&gt; For the 1992 season, it was decided to keep the roof closed at all times. The Kevlar roof was removed in May 1998, making the stadium open-air for the 1998 season. Later in 1998, a $26&amp;nbsp;million non-retractable opaque blue roof was installed.

In 1999, a {{convert|350|m2|sqft|-1|abbr=on}} portion of the roof collapsed on January 18, dumping ice and snow on workers that were setting up for the annual [[Montreal Auto Show]].&lt;ref name="espn" /&gt;&lt;ref name=scrtcias&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=11FWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9-sDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6874%2C4979213 |newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard |agency=wire services |title=Snow causes roof to cave in at Olympic Stadium |date=January 19, 1999 |page=5D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The auto show and a boat show the following month were canceled,&lt;ref name=osofrmo&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8SlUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_I0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2649%2C1387875 |newspaper=Boca Raton News |agency=Associated Press |title=Olympic Stadium out for month |date=January 20, 1999 |page=4B}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the auto show left the venue for good (since then, the Montreal Auto Show has usually been held at the [[Palais des congrès de Montréal]]). Repaired once again, the roof was modified to better withstand winter conditions: the OIB installed a network of pipes to circulate heated water under the roof to allow for snow melting. Despite these corrective measures, the stadium floor remained closed from December to March.&lt;ref name="Gazette-ClosedWinter"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Canwest News Service |title=Impact begin search for location for winter game |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |date=October 2, 2008 |url=https://nationalpost.com/sports/story.html?id=856303 }}{{dead link|date=August 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Birdair, the fabric provider and designer of the roof, was later sued for the roof failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/1999/08/30/bigo990830.html |title=Olympic stadium suing U.S. roofers |date=November 10, 2000 |publisher=CBC News |accessdate=July 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511124704/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/1999/08/30/bigo990830.html |archivedate=May 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The installer of the roof, Danny's Construction, having suffered tremendous cost overruns along with its subcontractor Montacier, due to changes in the plans and specifications and delays, was terminated during the construction, and Birdair completed the project. Danny's Construction sued Birdair in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nce.co.uk/dome-supplier-faces-montreal-compensation-battle/831802.article|title=Dome supplier faces Montreal compensation battle|last=Parker|first=Dave|date=January 28, 1999|publisher=New Civil Engineer|accessdate=July 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010, after a lengthy trial, the Quebec Superior Court awarded a judgement in favour of Danny's Construction and dismissed Birdair's countersuit.&lt;ref&gt;La Presse, Actualites, Samedi 13 Fevrier 2010, p. A9&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium's condition suffered considerably in the early 21st century. During the Expos' final years in Montreal, it was coated with grime, and much of the concrete was chipped, stained, and soiled.

===Plans for a third roof===

In 2009, the stadium received approval to remain open in the winter, provided weather conditions are favourable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://montrealgazette.com/there+snow/1156453/story.html|title=It's a go for the Big O (if there's no snow)|last=Riga|first=Andrew|date=January 9, 2009|work=Montreal Gazette|publisher=Canwest|accessdate=January 9, 2009}}{{dead link|date=April 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Olympic Installations Board issued a report stating that the roof was unsafe during heavy rainfall or more than {{convert|8|cm}} of snow, and that it rips 50 to 60 times a year. The city fire department warned in August 2009 that without corrective measures, including a new roof, it may order the stadium closed. Events cannot be held if more than {{convert|3|cm}} of snow are predicted 24 hours in advance, such as caused postponement of the Montreal Impact home opener soccer match in March 2014.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014|reason=both the volume and specific case should be referenced since it's 8cm of snow above.}} A contract for a new permanent steel roof was awarded in 2004, with an estimated $300 million price tag.

[[Image:AlouettesStadeOlympique.jpg|thumb|right|The Alouettes in action in 2010]]
The [[Canadian Football League]]'s [[Montreal Alouettes]] became the stadium's first major post-Olympic tenant when they moved their home games there halfway through the [[1976 CFL season|1976 season]].  Capacity was reduced from its Olympic capacity of 72,000 to 58,500, but leapt to 66,308 when the natural grass was replaced with [[AstroTurf]] ahead of the [[1977 CFL season|1977 season]].&lt;ref name=SABROlympicStadium/&gt;  The Alouettes remained there through [[1986 CFL season|1986]], the franchise's final season of operations; the team would shut down shortly after the start of the [[1987 CFL season|1987 season]]. A revived Alouettes franchise returned for the [[1996 CFL season|1996]] and [[1997 CFL season|1997 season]]s, but then moved to the [[Percival Molson Memorial Stadium|Percival Molson Stadium]] in 1998, only using the larger Olympic Stadium for select regular-season and home playoff games. As of 2008, the franchise uses Olympic Stadium for playoff games only. Due to the increased popularity of the Alouettes and the small capacity of Percival Molson Stadium, the team considered returning to Olympic Stadium on a full-time basis, but instead renovated Percival Molson Stadium to increase its capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Olympic Stadium has hosted the [[Grey Cup]] a total of six times, most recently in 2008 when the [[Calgary Stampeders]] defeated the hometown Alouettes. The stadium holds the record for nine of the ten [[CFL attendance|largest crowds in CFL history]], which include five regular-season and four Grey Cup games. A single-game record crowd numbering 69,083 attended a game played on September 6, 1977 between the Alouettes and [[Toronto Argonauts]].&lt;ref name="RIO-stats"&gt;{{cite web

===Baseball===
[[Image:Stade Olympique Roof.JPG|thumb|right|Detail of the roof including the foul lines]]
In 1977, the stadium replaced [[Jarry Park Stadium]] as the home ballpark of the [[National League]]'s [[Montreal Expos]]. As a part of the team's franchise grant, a domed stadium was supposed to be in place for the 1972 baseball season. However, due to the delays in constructing Olympic Stadium, until 1977, the Expos annually sought and received a waiver to remain at Jarry.  As late as January 1977, it was thought the Expos would have to play at least part of the 1977 season at Jarry as well.  The [[Parti Québécois]]' landslide victory in the [[Quebec general election, 1976|1976 provincial elections]] caused the Expos to break off lease talks.  However, an agreement was reached in February, and an official announcement came in March.&lt;ref name=SABROlympicStadium/&gt;

The Expos regularly played 81 home games every season until [[2003 Montreal Expos season|2003]], when they played 22 home games in [[Puerto Rico]] at [[Hiram Bithorn Stadium]] in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]]. The Expos played 59 home games at Olympic Stadium in each of their final two seasons of 2003 and 2004; the franchise moved south to Washington, D.C. for the [[2005 Washington Nationals season|2005 season]] and became the [[Washington Nationals]].

Olympic Stadium's first-ever baseball game was played on April 15, 1977. In front of 57,592, the Expos lost 7–2 to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]. However, the Expos had to use a hacksaw to cut open the locks because the OIB did not have a master key.&lt;ref name=SABROlympicStadium/&gt; The Expos played five home playoff games in 1981; two in the [[1981 National League Division Series|NLDS]] against the Phillies, and three in the [[1981 National League Championship Series|NLCS]] against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], who went on to win the [[1981 World Series|World Series]]. On October 19, the Expos lost the decisive fifth game, 2–1, to the Dodgers on [[Rick Monday]]'s ninth-inning [[home run]]. In 1982, the [[1982 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|Major League Baseball All-Star Game]] was played at Olympic Stadium in front of 59,057—a stadium record for baseball. On September 29, 2004, the Expos played their last game in Montreal, losing 9–1 to the [[Florida Marlins]] before 31,395.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/the-expos-last-home-game-an-oral-history|title=The Expos' last home game: An oral history – Sportsnet.ca|work=Sportsnet.ca|accessdate=May 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Toronto Blue Jays vs. New York Mets in Montreal.JPG|thumb|right|700px|Olympic Stadium panoramic during an MLB preseason game in 2014]]

Olympic Stadium proved to be somewhat problematic as a baseball venue. As in all multipurpose stadiums, the lower seating tier was set further back than in baseball-specific parks to accommodate the football field. However, since [[Canadian football]] fields are longer and wider than [[American football]] fields, Olympic Stadium's lower tier was set back even further than comparable seats at American multipurpose stadiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/worstballparks/010503.html |title=ESPN.com – Page2 – The List: Worst ballparks |publisher=Espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=April 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upper deck was one of the highest in the majors; as was the case with most of its multipurpose counterparts, most of the upper-deck seats, particularly those in the outfield, were too far away to be of any use during the regular season.

The Expos felt considerable chagrin that they were not consulted on the stadium's location, design, or construction even though they were slated to be its primary tenants.  Nonetheless, for most of their tenure they put considerable effort into making the atmosphere friendlier for baseball.  During the 1970s and early 1980s, fans arriving at the stadium from the [[Montreal Metro|Metro]] were greeted by an [[oom-pah]] band playing "[[The Happy Wanderer]]."  Whenever an opposing pitcher tried to hold a runner at first rather than pitch, the sound system would cluck at him like a chicken.&lt;ref name=Keri/&gt;

Before the [[1991 Montreal Expos season|1991 season]], the OIB began a major overhaul on the stadium's baseball configuration. The lower deck in center field was removed to make room for a larger scoreboard with replay capability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andrewclem.com/Baseball/OlympicStadium.html Clem's Baseball Blog] entry on Olympic Stadium&lt;/ref&gt;  That scoreboard was installed ahead of the [[1992 Montreal Expos season|1992 season]].  Also ahead of the 1992 season, the running track was removed, home plate was moved closer to the stands and new seats closer to the field were installed.  Several distant sections of permanent seating beyond the outfield fence were closed, replaced with bleacher seats directly behind the fence. The total seating capacity for baseball was reduced from a high of around 60,400 to 46,000.

The Expos were very successful in the stadium for a time, with above National League median attendance in 1977 and from 1979 to 1983. The Expos outdrew the [[New York Mets]] from 1977 to 1983, and 1994 to 1996, as well as the [[New York Yankees]] in 1982 and 1983.&lt;ref name="BR-ExposAttendance"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium's playing conditions left much to be desired. For most of the Expos' tenure, the playing surface was an extremely thin [[AstroTurf]] carpet, with only equally thin padding between it and the concrete floor. It was so hard on players' knees that visiting teams frequently ran at a nearby park. Longtime Expos trainer Ron McClain begged for a replacement, but the OIB was unwilling to spend the $1 million needed for a new surface. Before the roof finally arrived, players had to contend with huge patches of ice in early April or late September.  Additionally, for most of the Expos' tenure, the padding on the fence was so thin that fielders risked severe injury by going after long fly balls.  However, the OIB was also unwilling to replace the padding. By the 1990s, several free agents specifically demanded that the Expos be taken out of consideration due to the poor playing conditions.&lt;ref name=Keri&gt;{{cite book|last=Keri|first=Jonah|title= Up, Up and Away|publisher=[[Random House|Random House Canada]]|location=[[Toronto]]|year=2014|isbn=9780307361356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1990s, owner [[Claude Brochu]] concluded that Olympic Stadium was not suitable as a baseball venue, and actively campaigned for a replacement.&lt;ref name=Keri/&gt;  Brochu sold the team to [[Jeffrey Loria]] in 2000, who was equally dissatisfied with Olympic Stadium; he bluntly stated, "We cannot stay here."  However, [[Premier of Quebec|Quebec Premier]] [[Lucien Bouchard]] refused to authorize public funding deemed necessary for a replacement, in part because Olympic Stadium still had not been paid for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Curt |authorlink=Curt Smith (author)|title=Storied Stadiums|year=2001|publisher=Carroll &amp; Company|location=New York City|isbn=0-7867-1187-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Longest home runs====
[[Willie Stargell]] of the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] hit the longest home run at Olympic Stadium on May 20, 1978, driving the ball into the second deck in right field for an estimated distance of 535 feet. The yellow seat that marked the location where the ball landed has been removed from the 300 level. The seat is now preserved at the [[Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame]]. Stargell also hit a notable home run at the Expos' original Montreal home, Jarry Park, which landed in a swimming pool beyond the right field fence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On April 4, 1988, the Expos' Opening Day, [[Darryl Strawberry]] of the [[New York Mets]] hit a ball off a speaker which hangs off a concrete ring at Olympic Stadium, estimated to have traveled 525 feet.

[[Henry Rodríguez (outfielder)|"Oh Henry" Rodríguez]] hit a ball on June 15, 1997, that bounced off the concrete ring in right field, caromed up to hit the roof, and came down, hitting a speaker. The distance traveled by this ball is also estimated at 525 feet.

The longest home run hit to left field was [[Vladimir Guerrero]]'s blast on July 28, 2003, that hit an advertising sign directly below the left field upper deck. The ad was later replaced with a sign reading "VLAD 502".&lt;ref name="ExposGuide2004"&gt;{{cite book

The Olympic Stadium was the home of the [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|NASL]]'s [[Montreal Manic]] soccer team from 1981 to 1983. A 1981 playoff game against the [[Chicago Sting]] attracted a crowd of over 58,000. Several games of the [[2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup|2007]] [[FIFA]] [[FIFA U-20 World Cup|Under 20 World Cup]] were played at Olympic Stadium and drew the largest crowds of the tournament, including two sell-outs of 55,800.

Olympic Stadium hosted a [[CONCACAF Champions League]] quarter-final game pitting the [[Montreal Impact (1992–2011)|original Montreal Impact]] – who played primarily in the adjacent [[Saputo Stadium]] – against [[Club Santos Laguna]] of the [[Liga MX]] (Mexico First Division) on February 25, 2009.

==Facts and figures==
*At {{convert|165|m|abbr=on}}, the Olympic Stadium is the world's tallest [[Inclined tower|inclined structure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parcolympique.qc.ca/en/the-park/the-montreal-tower/|title=The Montréal Tower|publisher=|accessdate=May 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517160325/http://parcolympique.qc.ca/en/the-park/the-montreal-tower/|archive-date=May 17, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Well over its original budget, the stadium ended up costing $770&amp;nbsp;million to construct. By 2006, the final cost had risen to $1.47&amp;nbsp;billion when calculating in repairs, modifications and interest paid out. It took 30&amp;nbsp;years to finally pay off the cost, leading to its nickname of "The Big Owe" (a play on "The Big O").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/s/2003/0422/1542254.html |title=Montreal's house of horrors |first=Jeff |last=Merron |work=[[ESPN.com]] |date=April 22, 2003 |accessdate=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The roof is only {{convert|52|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} above the field of play. As a result, a number of [[batted ball|pop-ups]] and long home runs hit the roof over the years, necessitating the painting of orange lines on the roof to separate foul balls from fair balls.
*During their years playing in Olympic Stadium the Expos were one of only two teams not to employ the traditional yellow-painted foul poles with the [[New York Mets]] being the other; Olympic's poles were painted red while the Mets' home, [[Shea Stadium]] (and later [[Citi Field]]), used orange poles.
*The Olympic Stadium holds the record for a soccer game attendance in Canada. At the 1976 Summer Olympics [[Football at the 1976 Summer Olympics|soccer final]], 72,000 people witnessed [[East Germany national football team|East Germany]]'s 3–1 win over [[Poland national football team|Poland]].
*A yellow seat on the 300 level commemorated a {{convert|534|ft|m|adj=on}} home run by [[Willie Stargell]] of the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]. It has since been moved to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame.
*The Montreal games of the [[2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup]] were held at Olympic Stadium on a removable Team Pro EF RD surface that was purchased specifically for the tournament.&lt;ref name="Gazette-FIFAU20-surface"&gt;{{cite web

The '''Pierre Werner Cricket Ground''', also known as the '''Walferdange Cricket Ground''', is a [[cricket]] [[cricket ground|ground]] in [[Walferdange]], in central [[Luxembourg]]. It is the premier cricket venue in Luxembourg, being the home ground of the country's top club, the [[Optimists Cricket Club]], which plays in the Belgian Cricket League, and of the [[Luxembourgian cricket team|Luxembourg national team]].

The ground was opened in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110626144407/http://www.cricketeurope2.net/docs/ECC/BROCHURES/2011Division2.pdf ICC European Championship, 2011, Division 2 brochure, p12] Retrieved 7 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 the ground was given its present name to commemorate [[Pierre Werner]] (1913–2002), formerly [[Prime Minister of Luxembourg]] and honorary president of Optimists Cricket Club.&lt;ref&gt;''Wisden Cricketers' Almanack'', 2003 edition, p 1569.&lt;/ref&gt; The ground was established on land donated by the [[Walferdange|Walferdange commune]], adjacent to the [[Alzette]] river.&lt;ref name="loc"/&gt;

The ground has hosted matches between the [[Luxembourg national cricket team|Luxembourg national team]] and various other teams, including the [[Belgium national cricket team|Belgium national team]] and the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/111/5555_misc.html Other matches played on Pierre Werner Cricket Ground, Walferdange] - CricketArchive. Retrieved 27 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The heavy use of the ground is illustrated by the programme in 2003, when it "was in use almost every day between mid-April and early October". That year two internationals against France and one against Belgium were played on the ground (though one of the games against France was rained off).&lt;ref&gt;''Wisden Cricketers' Almanack'', 2004 edition, p 1440.&lt;/ref&gt; A six-a-side tournament was hosted in 2007.

The ground is the only outdoor venue regularly used for [[cricket in Luxembourg]], with the only other venue being Robert Schuman Oval, located 300m over the French border in [[Évrange]].&lt;ref name="lux"&gt;[http://www.cricket.lu/grounds.html Grounds] - Luxembourg Cricket Federation&lt;/ref&gt; The ground's pitch is artificial matting on concrete.&lt;ref name="lux"/&gt;

The ground hosts a one-week junior training academy each July. In 2010 this was attended by forty boys and girls of all ages, who were coached by a Level 3 coach from the UK and benefited from the ground's "excellent facilities".&lt;ref&gt;''Wisden Cricketers' Almanack'', 2011 edition, p 1185.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Al-Seeb Club''' ({{lang-ar|نادي السيب}}; also known locally as ''Sayyid Al-Nawadi'', or "Master of the Clubs", or just plainly as '''Al-Seeb''') is an [[Football clubs of Oman|Omani sports club]] based in [[Seeb|Al-Seeb]], [[Oman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.national-football-teams.com/club/2971/2013_1/Al_Seeb.html | title = Al-Seeb | publisher = national-football-teams.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club is currently playing in the [[Oman Professional League]], top division of [[Oman Football Association]]. Their home ground is [[Al-Seeb Stadium]]. The stadium is government owned, but they also own their own personal stadium and sports equipment, as well as their own training facilities.

==History==
Al-Seeb Club was founded on 3 January 1972 after merging four different small teams (Watan, Butolah, Hilal and Fida) in [[Seeb|Al-Seeb]] area. The four teams agreed after several meetings in between to unite together and form Al-Seeb. The club was officially registered on 26 June 2002.

Shihab Bin Tariq is the leader and chairman of Al-Seeb since 1982. He joined the club in 1975 after completing his university studies and then started with the club playing for the [[volleyball]] first team. He also participated in other games such as [[Soccer|football]], [[basketball]] and [[table tennis]]. His father was also a sportsperson as he was a [[Field hockey|hockey]] player and a [[swimmer]].

==Being a multisport club==
Although being mainly known for their football, Al-Seeb Club like many other clubs in Oman, have not only football in their list, but also [[field hockey|hockey]], [[volleyball]], [[Team handball|handball]], [[basketball]], [[badminton]] and [[squash (sport)|squash]]. They also have a youth football team competing in the Omani Youth league.

==Crest and colours==
Al-Seeb Club have been known since establishment to wear a full [[yellow]] or [[green]] (Away) [[Kit (association football)|kit]] (usually a darker shade of yellow or green). They have also had many different sponsors over the years. As of now, [[Adidas]] provides them with kits.

The '''Soap Box Derby''' is a youth [[soapbox car]] racing program which has been run in the [[United States]] since 1934. World Championship finals are held each July at [[Derby Downs]] in [[Akron, Ohio]]. Cars competing in this and related events are unpowered, relying completely upon [[gravity]] to move.

==History==
In the wake of the first car races, local youth auto races took place in the US at a very early stage. In 1914 the motion picture  [[Kid Auto Races at Venice]] starring [[Charlie Chaplin]] was shown in the cinemas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0004189 The Internet Movie Database] November 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 [[Myron Scott]], a photographer for [[Dayton, Ohio]], newspaper Dayton Daily News, put together an impromptu race for 19 boys. There was so much interest that Scott arranged a bigger race, with prize money for August 19. "An amazing crowd of 362 kids showed up with homemade cars built of orange crates, sheet tin, wagon and baby-buggy wheels...."&lt;ref name=aasbd/&gt;

The following year, the first All-American race was held on August 19, 1934.  The national winner was Robert Turner of [[Muncie, Indiana]], who made his car from the wood of a saloon bar.&lt;ref name=aasbd&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.aasbd.org/history.aspx|publisher=All-American Soap Box Derby|accessdate=August 19, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904021221/http://www.aasbd.org/history.aspx|archive-date=September 4, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tarch&gt;{{cite web|last=Archdeacon|first=Tom|title=HISTORY OF THE SOAP BOX DERBY IN DAYTON|url=http://www.daytonareasportshistory.com/more/SoapBoxDerbyHistoryDaytonAreaSportsHistory.htm|work=[[Dayton Daily News]]|accessdate=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, the race was moved from Dayton to Akron because of its central location and hilly terrain.&lt;ref name=mb-dn-96&gt;{{cite news|last=Bailey|first=Mary|title=The All-American Soap Box Derby|url=http://apps.detnews.com/apps/history/index.php?id=96|accessdate=August 19, 2011|newspaper=[[The Detroit News]]|date=August 25, 1996|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130121121008/http://apps.detnews.com/apps/history/index.php?id=96|archive-date=January 21, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}} With multiple historical photos.&lt;/ref&gt; An accident in 1935 captured the public's interest, and boosted the event's profile.  A car went off the track and struck [[NBC]]'s top commentator and sportscaster [[Graham McNamee]] while he was broadcasting live on the air.  Despite a concussion and other injuries (which resulted in a two-week hospital stay), McNamee described the collision to his listeners and finished his broadcast.

In 1936, Akron civic leaders recognized the need for a permanent track site for the youth racing classic, and through the efforts of the [[Works Progress Administration|Works Progress Administration (WPA)]], [[Derby Downs]] became a reality.

In 1946, the town of [[Mission, British Columbia]], acquired the rights to the Western Canada Soapbox Derby Championships and the [[Mission Regional Chamber of Commerce]], previously named the Mission City &amp; District [[Board of Trade]], organized the event annually until 1973.&lt;ref name="Mission on the Fraser"&gt;Cherrington, John (1974). ''Mission on the Fraser, Patterns of a small city's progress'', p. 33,172. Mitchell Press, Vancouver, BC, Canada. ISBN B0006CL344&lt;/ref&gt;

During the All American Soapbox Derby's heyday in the 1950s and 1960s, when [[Chevrolet]] was a sponsor and famous TV and movie stars made guest appearances, as many as 70,000 people gathered in August to eat snow cones and cheer hundreds of youthful racer/builders (boys only in early years) ages 11–15 who were the champions of local races around the nation and from several foreign countries.  In 1947, actor [[James Stewart]] was appearing in the Broadway play ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]''; in order to attend the event, he cancelled a weekend's worth of performances and refunds were issued to ticketholders.  At its peak, the Derby was one of the top five sporting events in terms of attendance. [[John DeLorean]] ended the 35-year Chevrolet sponsorship in 1972, claiming that the Derby was outdated and too expensive to hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mark J.|last=Price|title=Local history: Auto executive John DeLorean cut Chevrolet's ties with Soap Box Derby in 1972 and expected it to fail |url=http://www.ohio.com/lifestyle/history/local-history-auto-executive-john-delorean-cut-chevrolet-s-ties-with-soap-box-derby-in-1972-and-expected-it-to-fail-1.780843#|work=[[Akron Beacon Journal]]|date=July 16, 2017|access-date=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1993, the All-American Soap Box derby began the Rally World Championship. The Rally derby is a grand prix style of race in which each district, ten in all, sends back a number of champions based on number of racers and races in each district.

Today there are broader categories that extend the age range to younger racers and permit adults to assist in construction. This is especially helpful for younger children who cannot use [[power tools]], as well as to provide an outlet for adults.

==Modern soapbox racing==

[[File:Modern Derby Cars.JPG|thumb|Modern Derby Cars]]

Using standardized wheels with precision [[ball bearing]]s, modern [[gravity]]-powered racers start at a ramp on top of a hill, attaining speeds of up to 35 miles per hour.  Rally races and qualifying races in cities around the world use advanced timing systems that measure the time difference between the competing cars to the thousandth of a second to determine the winner of a heat. Each heat of a race lasts less than 30 seconds. Most races are double elimination races in which a racer that loses a heat can work their way through the Challenger's Bracket in an attempt to win the overall race. The annual World Championship race in Akron, however, is a single elimination race which uses overhead photography, triggered by a timing system, to determine the winner of each heat. Approximately 500 racers compete in two or three heats to determine a World Champion in each divisions.

There are three racing divisions in most locals and at the All-American competition. The Stock division is designed to give the first-time builder a learning experience. Boys and girls, ages 7 through 13, compete in simplified cars built from kits purchased from the All-American. These kits assist the Derby novice by providing a step-by-step layout for construction of a basic lean forward style car. The Super Stock Car division, ages 10 through 17, gives the competitor an opportunity to expand their knowledge and build a more advanced model. Both of these beginner levels make use of kits and shells available from the All-American. These entry levels of racing are popular in race communities across the country, as youngsters are exposed to the Derby program for the first time.

The Masters division offers boys and girls, ages 10 through 20, an advanced class of racer in which to try their creativity and design skills. Masters entrants may purchase a Scottie Masters Kit with a fiberglass body from the All-American Soap Box Derby.

==Ultimate Speed Challenge==
[[File:Winning 2011 AAUSC Car.jpg|thumb|Winning 2011 AAUSC Car]]
[[File:AAUSC winners and record holders.JPG|thumb|AAUSC winners and record holders]]

The Ultimate Speed Challenge &lt;ref name="aasbd.org"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110212105549/http://www.aasbd.org/media/13681/usc_2011_history.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt; is an All American Soap Box Derby sanctioned racing format that was developed in 2004 to preserve the tradition of innovation, creativity, and craftsmanship in the design of a gravity powered racing vehicle while generating intrigue, excitement, and engaging the audience at the annual All-American Soap Box Derby competition.  The goal of the event is to attract creative entries designed to reach speeds never before attainable on the historic Akron hill. The competition consists of three timed runs (one run in each lane), down Akron’s {{convert|989|ft|adj=on}} hill. The car and team that achieve the fastest single run is declared the winner. The timed runs are completed during the All American Soap Box Derby race week.

The open rules of the Ultimate speed Challenge have led to a variety of interesting car designs.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wr-racing.com/id39.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-01-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114145814/http://www.wr-racing.com/id39.html |archive-date=2011-11-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wr-racing.com/id21.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-01-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114145642/http://www.wr-racing.com/id21.html |archive-date=2011-11-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Winning times have improved as wheel technology has advanced and the integration between the cars and wheels has improved via the use of wheel fairings.  Wheels play a key role in a car's success in the race. Wheel optimization has included a trend towards a smaller diameter (to reduce inertial effects and aerodynamic drag), the use of custom rubber or urethane tires (to reduce rolling resistance), and the use of solvents to swell the tires (also reducing rolling resistance).   There is some overlap in technology between this race and other gravity racing events, including the [[Carnegie Mellon University traditions|buggy races]] race at Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmubuggy.org/gallery/Ultimate-Speed/separated-at-birth-2010 |title=separated at birth &amp;#124; CMU Buggy Alumni Association |publisher=Cmubuggy.org |date= |accessdate=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, during the inaugural run of the Ultimate Speed Challenge, the fastest time was achieved by a car designed and built by the Pearson family, driven by Alicia Kimball, and utilizing high performance pneumatic tires. The winning time achieved on the {{convert|989|ft|adj=on}} track was 27.190 seconds.

Jerry Pearson returned to defend the title with driver Nicki Henry in the 2005 Ultimate Speed Challenge beating the 2004 record time and breaking the 27.00 second barrier with an elapsed time of 26.953 seconds. Second place went to the DC Derbaticians with a time of 27.085 while third went to Talon Racing of Florida with a time of 27.320.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aasbd.net/webdev/aasbd68/heatsheets/UltimateSpeed.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828234125/http://aasbd.net/webdev/aasbd68/heatsheets/UltimateSpeed.pdf |archivedate=2008-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Wargo, from California, put together the 2006 Ultimate Speed Challenge winning team with driver Jenny Rodway.  Jenny set a new track record of 26.934 seconds.  Jenny's record stood for 3 years as  revisions to the track and ramps after the 2006 race caused winning times to rise in subsequent races.  Team Pearson finished 2nd with a time of 26.999 seconds and team Thomas finished 3rd with a time of 27.065.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aasbd.net/webdev/aasbd69/results/Ultimate%20Speed.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828235623/http://aasbd.net/webdev/aasbd69/results/Ultimate%20Speed.pdf |archivedate=2008-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Team Eliminator, composed of crew chief and designer Jack Barr and driver Lynnel McClellan, achieved victory with a time of 27.160 in the 70th (2007) All-American Soap Box Derby Ultimate Speed Challenge. Jenn Rodway finished 2nd with a time of 27.334 while Hilary Pearson finished 3rd with a time of 27.367.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aasbd.net/webdev/aasbd70/images/resultsusc.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703193535/http://aasbd.net/webdev/aasbd70/images/resultsusc.pdf |archivedate=2008-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jack Barr returned in 2008 with driver Krista Osborne for a repeat team win with a 27.009 second run.  Crew chief Tom Schurr and driver Cory Schurr place second with a time of 27.023 while crew chief Mike Albertoni and driver Danielle Hughes were 3rd after posting a time of 27.072.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aasbd.net/webdev/aasbd71/hs-ultimate.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424001313/http://aasbd.net/webdev/aasbd71/hs-ultimate.htm |archivedate=2012-04-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 72nd (2009) AASBD Ultimate Speed Challenge, Derek Fitzgerald's Zero-Error Racing team, with driver Jamie Berndt, took advantage of a freshly paved track,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130102153716/http://zeroerror.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=1707&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=13122 ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130102190031/http://zeroerror.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=1707&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=13196 ]&lt;/ref&gt;  and set a new record time of 26.924 seconds.  Cory Schurr placed second with a time of 26.987.  Laura Overmyer of clean sheet racing finished third with a time of 27.003.

In 2010, Mark Overmyer’s Clean Sheet/Sigma Nu team (CSSN) and driver Jim Overmyer set the track record at 26.861 seconds in the first heat of the opening round. Several minutes later, driver Sheri Lazowski, also of CSSN, lowered the record to 26.844 seconds, resulting in victory by 0.005 seconds over 2nd-place finisher Jamie Berndt of Zero Error. Competition was tight in 2010, with the top 3 cars finishing within a span of 0.017 seconds.&lt;ref name="aasbd.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aasbd.net/webdev/aasbd73/index.html |title=ISBD |publisher=Aasbd.net |date= |accessdate=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, advancements in wheel technology and car design, coupled with ideal track conditions, lead to significantly lower times in the Ultimate Speed Challenge.  Driver Kayla Albertoni and crew chief Mike Albertoni broke the record in heat 2 or the opening round with a 26.765, taking 0.079 seconds off the 2010 record.     One heat later, driver Jim Overmyer and crew chief Mark Estes of team CSSN racing lowered the record a further 0.133 with a 26.632 run.  Jim improved to 26.613 in round 2 to secure 2nd place.  In heat 5, of the opening round, driver Kristi Murphy and crew chief Pat Murphy secured 3rd place with a run of 26.677.   In the next heat,  driver Sheri Lazowski and crew chief Mark Overmyer (of CSSN racing) took the victory with a blistering run of 26.585 seconds.  Sheri's record time was 0.259 seconds under her 2010 record and 0.339 seconds below the 2009 record.  Her improvement in 2011 is the largest year-to-year change in the record in the history of the AAUSC race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aarace.com/aaraceweek/index.cfm/74th-all-american-soap-box-derby-race-results/ |title=HugeDomains.com - AaRace.com is for sale |publisher=Aa Race |date= |accessdate=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aasbd.org/media/13681/aausc_2011_history.pdf ]{{dead link|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By winning in both 2010 and 2011, Sheri became the first repeat USC winner.

In 2012, revised starting ramps and a re-sealed track with a softer road surface, led to significant increases in finishing times.  The 2012 winner, Laura Overmyer of CSSN racing, with crew chief Mark Estes, posted a winning time of 26.655 seconds, 0.070 seconds slower than the track record set by her team the prior year.  Kristi Murphy, of Zero Error racing, finished in 2nd with a time of 26.769, 0.114 seconds back. Jamie Berndt, also of Zero Error racing, finished in 3rd place with a time of 26.827.  Competition was not as close as in recent years, with the top 3 cars covering a span of 0.172 seconds.  This is roughly double the span in 2009 and 2011 and 10 times the span in 2010.  The 2012 results mark the 3rd consecutive win by CSSN racing and the 4th consecutive win by wheel expert Duane Delaney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_GkWl6S9MJMN2lvZ3U5M19ma28/edit?pli=1# |title=2012 Ultimate Speed Challenge Heat Results.pdf - Google Drive |publisher=Docs.google.com |date= |accessdate=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aasbd.org/media/24408/usc_2013_history.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821091811/http://www.aasbd.org/media/24408/usc_2013_history.pdf |archivedate=2013-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 race was run under wet conditions which necessitated a format change. Each car was given a single run from lane 2 to determine the winner.  The running  order was randomly determined.   CSSN Racing's Anne Taylor with crew chief Jerry Pearson won with a time of 26.929.  Jillian Brinberg and crew chief Mark Estes, also of CSSN Racing,  finished 2nd with a time of 26.978.  Catherine Carney with crew chief Lee Carney finished 3rd with a time of 27.162.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aaraceweek.com/?page_id=616 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130731143934/http://aaraceweek.com/?page_id=616 |archivedate=2013-07-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, CSSN's Anne Taylor with crew chief Jerry Pearson won with a time of 26.613. Anne's time improves on the prior best time for the new gate configuration but falls short of the 2011 record.  This marks Anne's 2nd consecutive win and the 5th consecutive win for CSSN racing in this event. CSSN's Tucker McClaran with crew chief Mark Estes finished second with a time of 26.667. Catherine Carney with crew chief Lee Carney finished 3rd with a time of 26.750.

==Scandals==

===1973 scandal===
[[Image:Soap Box magnet11.jpg|thumb|200px|right|1973 Boulder, Colorado Disqualified Racer]]
[[Image:magnet12.jpg|thumb|170px|right|Electromagnet Electrical Wiring within Headrest]]
In 1973, 14-year-old Jimmy Gronen of [[Boulder, Colorado]] was stripped of his title two days after winning the national race.  Suspicions were running high even before the finals, and Gronen was actually booed by many spectators.

The unusual dimensions of Gronen's margins of victory and heat times tipped off derby officials to illegal circumstances surrounding Gronen's racer. Subsequent [[X-ray]] examination of his car revealed an [[electromagnet]] in the nose.  When activated at the starting line, the electromagnet pulled the car forward by attracting it to the [[steel]] paddle used to start the race. Gronen activated the electromagnet by leaning his helmet against the backrest of his seat, which activated its power source.  This became very evident as Gronen's heat times progressively slowed down as the race wore on, because the electromagnet lost strength each time it was activated. Usually, heat times get faster each time a racer completes a heat. Videotape of the race also showed a suspiciously sudden lead for Gronen just a few feet after each heat began. The margin of victory for a race heat is normally no more than {{convert|1|to|3|ft}}. Gronen's early heat victories were in the {{convert|20|to|30|ft}} range. (Aluminum insulator plates were added to the starting ramps in 1974 to render an electromagnetic system useless.) &lt;ref&gt;"Anything to Win: The All-American Soap Box Derby Scandal" (episode 6 of the GSN documentary series)&lt;/ref&gt;

Midway through the 1973 race, Derby officials also replaced Gronen's wheels after chemicals were found to be applied to the wheels' rubber. The chemicals caused the tire rubber to swell, which reduced the rolling resistance of the tire.

In the final heat, Gronen finished narrowly ahead of Bret Yarborough.  Within two days, Yarborough was declared the 1973 champion.

Gronen's uncle and [[legal guardian]] at the time, wealthy engineer Robert Lange, was [[Indictment|indicted]] for contributing to the [[Juvenile delinquent|delinquency of a minor]] and paid a $2,000 settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eric Dexheimer |url=http://www.westword.com/2004-08-05/news/uphill-racer/2/ |title=Uphill Racer |publisher=Westword |date=2004-08-05 |accessdate=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lange's son and Jimmy Gronen's cousin Bob Lange, Jr., had won the previous 1972 Derby using a car considered indistinguishable from the vehicle used by Gronen.

==Types of injuries ==

=== Lateral epicondylitis ===
{{main|Tennis elbow}}
[[File:ECR-brevis.png|left|thumb|320x320px|Coloured in purple: the Extensor Carpi Radialis Brevis muscle]]
Lateral epicondylitis is an overuse injury that frequently occur in tennis. It is also known as [[tennis elbow]]. This injury categorise as tendon injury where it occur in the forearm muscle called the extensor carpic radialis brevis ([[ECRB]]).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Lateral epicondylitis in tennis: update on aetiology, biomechanics and treatment|url = http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/41/11/816|journal = British Journal of Sports Medicine|date = 2007-11-01|issn =  1473-0480|pmc = 2465303|pmid = 17616547|pages = 816–819|volume = 41|issue = 11|doi = 10.1136/bjsm.2007.036723|first = Thomas De|last = Smedt|first2 = Andy de|last2 = Jong|first3 = Wim Van|last3 = Leemput|first4 = Dossche|last4 = Lieven|first5 = Francis Van|last5 = Glabbeek}}&lt;/ref&gt; The injury is regularly developed in the recreational players.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Experienced players are less likely to develop lateral epicondylitis than the inexperienced players due to poorer technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The effect of tennis racket grip size on forearm muscle firing patterns. |date = 1992|journal = Am J Sports Med|doi =10.1177/0363546506290185 |pmid = |access-date = |volume = 34|pages = 1977–83. | last1 = Hatch | first1 = George F. | last2 = Pink | first2 = Marilyn M. | last3 = Mohr | first3 = Karen J. | last4 = Sethi | first4 = Paul M. | last5 = Jobe | first5 = Frank W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 	Tennis elbow or lateral epicondylalgia is a common injury that occurs in 40-50% of tennis players. It is more prominent at the lower levels of play and usually comes from any incorrect use of the wrist or grip on the forehand or one-handed backhand strokes[18].  Players at higher levels often have more relaxed grips and have a larger racquet extension out to the ball after they make contact, where professionals have less emphasis on the arm and more on the use of every part of the body in order exert the natural power behind the ball, lower level players don’t get the training to discover how to use their whole body for a tennis stroke and are often reduced to using their arms in order to exert all of the power therefore putting heavy strain on the arm[18]. Holding the grip tightly will put more tension on the arm therefore when going for a swing the muscles will be absorbing all of the shock from the initial contact of the ball[19]. Symptoms of tennis elbow include the slow pain which occurs around the elbow. Simple tasks such as shaking hands or moving the wrist with force, like lifting weights or doing push ups, will worsen the pain[21]. Tennis Elbow  has actually shown that inflammatory tendons are only part of the early stages or acute stages with a treatment of anti-inflammatory or steroids being appropriate uses for this symptom[20]. Most players respond well to simple rest, but other means of treatment include physical therapy, strength training, and electrical stimulation[18]. Some players make alterations to their racquet such as increasing grip size which will ultimately prevent any unwanted movement of the wrist when extending out and finishing the tennis stroke[19].

=== Shoulder ===
[[Sports injury|Shoulder injury]] is other common types of injury in tennis. Shoulder injury caused by the repetitive use of shoulder&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Shoulder injuries in tennis players|url = http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/40/5/435|journal = British Journal of Sports Medicine|date = 2006-05-01|issn = 1473-0480|pmc = 2577490|pmid = 16632575|pages = 435–440|volume = 40|issue = 5|doi = 10.1136/bjsm.2005.023218|first = H. van der|last = Hoeven|first2 = W.

In order to relieve pain in the lower back people are often told to rest it, but not for more than two days because of its potential damage to the bones, connecting tissue, and cardiovascular system. Once the back pain has dispersed stretching is recommended in order to prevent the stiffness from the initial pain, with examples being the [[squatting position]] or spinal extensions. In order to prevent future lower back injuries strength training to the abdominal muscles is necessary because with a stronger abdomen it will protect the back from excessive intervertebral disk strain. The straight crunch, the Oblique crunch, and balance exercises with the gym ball are some of the workouts for abdominal strengthening, but the exercises should be done with caution because if done incorrectly the strain on the back will be amplified. After the injury is dealt with, players of any level return to the court, the higher level players will often go through a thorough stretching period before any matches so they can assure  that they won’t hurt their back or any other part of their body[22].

=== Blister ===
[[Blister]] can be described as a patch that appears on the skin filled with a clear fluid and sometimes filled with blood. During physical activities, the continuous force of friction, cutting, squeezing and scratching which cause the separation of the epidermal cell layer, as a result the blister is formed.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sock Systems to Prevent Foot Blisters and the Impact on Overuse Injuries of the Knee Joint|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.7205/MILMED-D-01-8508|journal = Military Medicine|date = 2009-01-01|volume = 174|issue = 2|doi = 10.7205/milmed-d-01-8508|first = Damien|last = Van Tiggelen|first2 = Simon|last2 = Wickes|first3 = Pascal|last3 = Coorevits|first4 = Mich|last4 = Dumalin|first5 = Erik|last5 = Witvrouw|pages=183–189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blister (foot) occurs frequently among marathon runners, walk racers, backpackers and in hiking.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In tennis, blister development site often occur on the hand or around the fingers because often time the skin is consistently rubbing against the [[Racket (sports equipment)|tennis racquet]].

The '''Tour de Korea''' is an annual professional [[road bicycle racing]] [[race stage|stage race]] held in [[South Korea]] since 2001 as part of the [[UCI Asia Tour]]. It as rated by the International Cycling Union (UCI) as a 2.2 category race, then promoted to 2.1 category in 2014. The race is organized by the [[Korea Cycling Federation]].

==History==
The tour gained international attention when [[Lance Armstrong]], a seven-time [[Tour de France]] winner, participated in 2007.  Armstrong, having retired from cycling at that time, did not compete.  For the sake of publicity, he rode one lap around the course of the first stage on his mountain bicycle.

Tour de Korea is the only international cycling competition in South Korea. The predecessor to Tour de Korea was stopped in 1997 due to financial strains. Tour de Korea is divided into two divisions: Elite for invitees and competitive cyclists, and a "Special race" for cycling club teams. The prize money for the 2011 tour totaled 200&amp;nbsp;million [[South Korean won|Won]].

The tour course is {{convert|1500|km|mi}} long, making it the longest cycling competition in Asia.

The tour comprises exclusively point-to-point road race stages.  Unlike the major tours in Europe, such as the [[Tour de France]] and [[Giro d'Italia]], there are no [[time trials]] or [[team time trials]]. The tour was planned this way reportedly because the promoters wanted to minimize time and effort spent in recording and sorting race results.
